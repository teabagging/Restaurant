My second favorite dish is a duck soup special they have called Bun Mang Vit. They make it a couple of times a month but it is a comforting clear broth. Another favorite is the Goi Cuon (Summer Rolls) appetizer and the Banh Cuon (thinly rolled rice crepe with  pork and wood ear mushrooms). These are consistently good.

After reading a few reviews, I settled on Brickhouse Pizza.  The question now was \\"What kind of Pizza?\\".  Well, normally, I'm a pepperoni pizza kind of guy.  However, on this particular night, from this particular establishment, I was looking for something different...something more.  Based on the review written by Casey W., I decided  to try the Buffalo Chicken Pizza.  I have to admit that I was *slightly* concerned when i didn't find this specific pizza on the official online menu for Brickhouse.  I figured that I would just roll with it, order it and if the order-taker didn't question what I was ordering, it would be a lock.  Needless to say, it was a lock.  \\n\\nDelivery was fast, and worth every minute.  This buffalo chicken pizza was unlike anything that I have had before.  First, the chicken is deep fried and sliced into strips, and then drizzled with a delicious buffalo sauce.  The chicken was perfectly cooked, the buffalo sauce had the right amount of heat and they don't over-do it.  And to make this pizza not only memorable, but unforgettable, they top it off with dollops of Ricotta cheese.  Just delicious.  The only slightly negative thing that I have to say is that they forgot our Blue Cheese dressing, but to be honest, I didn't even think about it until I was about halfway into my third piece.  I think the combo of the buffalo and ricotta made the need for blue cheese nearly non-existent.\\n\\nHighly recommended, I will be craving this pizza until the next time I have one."},{"name":"Mixtura","address":"300 Beacon St","city":"Somerville","stars":"4","text":"Started with a delicious fresh fruit and honey smoothie, dug into a traditional Peruvian sandwich, finished it off with a tasty rice pudding.\\nEverything was fresh and tasted homemade.

The atmosphere is absolutely wonderful - dim lighting, lacquered wooden tables, laid back, a floor to ceiling wall display of wines and a well stocked bar full of ambiance. The service was wonderful, friendly & attentive but not overbearing. We couldn't decide on a bottle of wine (half off on a Wednesday night!) so our server opened two different bottles to give us a taste before we decided. The red blend she had initially recommended was the winner. We tried three small plates. The prawns (gambas) were perfectly cooked and seasoned and nom nom nom delicious, and the tortilla espa√±ola - with it's yummy layers of potatoes and creamy eggs - was perhaps the best I've had since my trip to Spain. The brussels with chorizo were tasty in terms of flavor but the texture was a bit off, too boiled tasting, I would have preferred them roasted & a bit charred. But I nitpick.

It's a hot soaking pool, espresso bar, movie theatre, restaurant, and hotel all in one, nestled inside a vintage school house. All of the unique character from the original building is still present with the original hardwood floors, large windows, and architectural features - with some quirky new paintings sprinkled around the walls. It's very inviting as you walk in and cozy- it makes you want to stick around and see what this old school house has in store. \\n\\nWe enjoyed eating at the restaurant. We sat at the bar, ordered a whiskey flight and a wine flight (for very reasonable prices!) and shared a burger and Cajun tots. We also had a fresh salad and a delicious Hunter's stew. The strew was honestly the best part of the food. The rest of the food was okay, especially for the price and the ingredients used. \\n\\nAfterwards we decided to enjoy a nice long soak in the outside soaking pool. It's $5/hr (very reasonable) and they take your ID card and give you a pool card - you have to return it in order to get your IDs back. The water was warm, with one side of the pool having jet bubbles, and the other side calm. The pool had bench seating so it was nice to sit and relax. It's a secluded soaking pool and visitors are surrounded by palm trees and other vegetation. It's very beautiful, and very relaxing, especially after a nice lunch. When we visited (in the middle of the day on a Wednesday) moms and their toddlers were playing and floating in the pool, but the later in the afternoon it got the small pool started to fill up with older adults. The changing room area was a little dirty and was in need of a good scrub, but nothing detestable. \\n\\nIt was a fun and relaxing midday outing. However, I didn't give it 5 stars because the help, both at the restaurant and at the front desk, were not very helpful, polite, or seemed to be excited about their jobs. Working in such a cool building, with so much to offer, you'd think they'd be a little more excited. \\n\\nI would recommend this to families, single folk, young professionals, and mature adults. There is something to enjoy for everyone, especially in such a unique building with interesting history."},{"name":"Blitz Pearl","address":"110 NW 10th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"3","text":"the food and drank were good.  plus there was sports on the tube and things were getting crazy!"},{"name":"Santouka Harvard Square","address":"1 Bow St","city":"Cambridge","stars":"4","text":"Had the Shoyu Ramen with Egg and it was so delicious.

I've been fairly regular here for about 20 years. As time goes on I realize just how fortunate we are to have this good buffet, esp if you use their prepaid coupons.\\n\\n  I have been burned by so many coupons before but this place has lasted all these years that I have no fears in buying them here, plus its so simple and easy.  The more you buy the cheaper they get. If you pay cash its cheaper than credit by 2 1/2 to 3% or so.\\n\\n  What you do is just walk in, eat and  leave a coupon on the table!\\nThe coupon pays for the buffet lunch, any drink, tax AND TIP. Simple. If with friends\\nno need to dig out cash.  If your treating it makes it easier to treat and they wont know what you paid unless they know you bought coupons and how many you bought.\\n \\n  For the drink its soft drinks, teas, and Lassi. No alcohol is served here. Mango lassi is what most people seem to get that order the lassi. Its very good but high in sugar.\\n\\nPrices for the coupons...\\n\\n4   coupons   cash $9.75 each      credit $10.00\\n10                           $9.20                        $9.50\\n20                           $8.75                        $9.10\\n100                         $8.00                        $8.30\\n\\nWithin the last year they have made most of their stainless containers of food double containers so the offering are almost double as before for the same price.\\n\\nIn the buffet there is first the soup canteen, often a lentil soup. Soups here are often a bit thicker than many.  Thats more lentil and less water!  They are very very good too..people go back for more soup here, where in many buffets they dont finish the soup. At many other places its not good enough to finish. \\n\\nThere is a basket of nan bread, but the servers often come by with hot nan too.\\n\\nThen there is the rice, today there was a white and a yellow rice with onion.\\n\\nAfter that was 11 different bins of vegetables or meats.  Usually there is at least 3 with meat.\\nI love the chicken in a curry or the butter chicken. Sometimes hard to tell them apart. Im not so fond of the dry red chicken tikka I guess it is, thats often too dry no matter where you get it.  The beef chuncks are ok, but the vegetables and other dishes are all yummy!  \\n\\nNow there are buffets in town that are a lot larger in size and visually look very appealing. The layout is smaller here, but in time you will notice the quality here is better. The owner is the cook.\\n\\nThere is a small buffet with sweets and sauces and spices. \\n\\nReally for the price, especially if you use the coupons, its really hard to beat. Parking is also EASY as there is a HUGE lot right out front with tons of parking ALWAYS.\\n\\nAnd remember BUFFET and these coupons are LUNCH ONLY, and no alcohol is served."},{"name":"Naked Pizza","address":"1331 Beacon St","city":"Brookline","stars":"3","text":"If you are doing GF and DF, i'd recommend extra sauce\\nSuper yummy.

It is not acceptable to serve one person's food and leave the other person waiting for upwards of 20(!) minutes. It's also not acceptable to keep both people waiting for upwards of 40(!) minutes before either of them gets food. My husband and I have had both experiences consistently enough with orders right off the menu (no special requests or substitutions) when the restaurant hasn't been slammed with customers, that we regretfully cross Tatsu off our go-to list. Eventually the 40+ minute wait was explained to us: whoever was supposed to turn on one of the pieces of cooking equipment that morning hadn't, so we were waiting for it to come up to temperature. But there's been no explanation for repeatedly leaving me the awkward choice of either the two of us siting there watching as one of our food gets cold, or one of us eating while the other watches hungrily, then the first one twiddling thumbs while the second one eats (while the parking meter's ticking).  Good food--and it is really good food--is not enough to excuse unco√∂rdinated, thoughtlessly awkward service like this. \\n\\nTo be clear, it is not the waitstaff's fault; they are attentive and courteous and professional.

The lobster meat is prepared in large chunks, which is great, but there isn't much of it.  It's also mixed with a bit of mayo and some other ingredients (I think celery was in there if I recall) to make Lobster Salad (indeed).  The roll was terrible as it was too dry.  I didn't even want to finish the bread and just ate the rest of the lobster out of the roll with a fork.    All in all, the lobster roll here ranked 2nd out of the four I tried while in Boston, and that's only slightly ahead of Boston Chowder Company because it's served hot and with a bit less mayo.

She then continued to go back and forth with me, I then said I'll take a refund, she then stated its not that serious while quickly refunding my money....I took my business elsewhere. I will return because I know everyone isn't the same but when I'm spending my money I want what order along with great customer service.

Bizarre.\\n\\nNow let's to get the meat of it.  The food was salty, greasy, and hurt my love handles.  The first course was tomato soup, with like an herb in the middle.  I just wanted one of our waiters to clean it up as soon as they put it down.  The initial taste just made me feel queasy.\\n\\nThe second course was just a lump of meet.  They put, like, a lot of sauce on. The tots made me happy at first, but then I grew to be annoyed with them.

I got Duck as my entree. The duck itself was great along with the sauce. The things with it however weren't great. Under-cooked brussel sprouts, tasteless butternut squash, and andouille sausage. The sausage was not needed in the dish at all. If you go, I recommend something other than this dish. For dessert, I got raspberry creme brulee, which was delicious.

In every ramen shop, I always order their bestsellers; In Jinya, it happened to be the Cha Cha Cha. Very garlicky--which I didn't mind and it did not disappoint.\\n\\nThe only reason why I can't give them a five-star rating is because I can't change my noodle, or so it says. On the menu, it clearly stated no noodle substitution. I wanted thin noodles, but I never really clarified or asked our waiter what that statement meant.

We've had ramen in a few places in Atlanta, but obviously nothing can really compare to Japan. \\n\\nWe came in on a Sunday at 2:30 pm and the place was packed. That was a good sign, even the outdoor seating in 90 degree weather was pretty full another good sign. The hostess grabbed our name and number and gave us our wait time (30 min for a party of 2). The inside of the restaurant is rather small, there's about 5 bar style seating facing the parking lot and another 7-8 seats at the ramen bar. Along the opposite wall there's 7-8 two seater tables that can be pushed together for parties bigger than 2. The restaurant itself is not built to seat parties more than 4 comfortably (which by coincidence is like every ramen bar in japan). the waiting area is non existent so expect to stand outside. Anything else and u may get run over by incoming patrons or the staff that are tending to the outdoor seating area. \\n\\nWhen we were finally sat we quickly placed our orders. My Wife had the Cha Cha Ramen and I had the spicy chicken. We also split an order of the takoyaki balls and mochi ice cream for desert. The food came out within 10 min. The takoyaki balls were good. we got 6 in an order for $6.95. Strangely they sat on a bed of egg salad? that was a first but the flavor itself was good. It seemed to be a bit more batter than octopus but i was already expecting that going into it. Next came the ramen. I have to say that the spicy chicken ramen was pretty darn close to the quality i had in japan. the broth was rich and flavorful and the noodles were just right with enough \\"elasticity\\" with each bite. I do wish the portion was a bit bigger. I also tried my wife's cha cha ramen. I really wanted to like it but i was not a fan. she didn't get the garlic press as shown in the pictures which is fine but i think the broth was not as good as mine. The pork broth in the cha cha ramen came with much more fat content which i thought would give an even deeper/richer flavor but it ended up being kind of bland. Perhaps it needed the additional garlic? There was also quite of bit of bean sprouts with her bowl of ramen. The bean sprouts gave the whole bowl of ramen a heavy bean sprout taste. Its not necessarily bad but in my opnion its way too much bean sprout flavor. Her thicker noodles were done well however so no complaints there. Finally we ended our meal with the mochi green tea ice cream. It was typical packaged mochi ice cream you would probably get in the supermarket. The mochi outside was hard vs. the soft and elastic feel of fresh mochi. The green tea ice cream was good but i probably wouldn't order that again. \\n\\nOverall i'll be back to try their other ramen but my wife wasn't happy with her's. I think we just need to find which ones they do well and not so well and just order the right ones. The service seems to have improved from other experiences noted on here. our server was quick and attentive so no complaints there. I do wish they didn't scream \\"Ra-shai\\" every time they sat someone down. The hostesses do it but its clear that the staff are too busy to respond or don't care enough to reply vs. ippudo in NYC.

I had the Tea Time Mule (sweet and not overpowering, my favorite) and the Birds of Paradise (strong, strong, strong and delicious once you let the ice melt a little bit).

I have been here a number of occasions, most recently during New Year's Day when the food was actually decent, but the service a bit lacking.\\n\\nFast forward to Chinese New Year's Eve - with nearly every Chinese restaurant in town filled to the gills, this was the only place that didn't have too many people. We ordered a set for 2-3 people that was in the neighbourhood of $40 and included a large hot pot (gam ja tang/pork neckbone soup), one seafood pancake, and a few bowls of rice. It's hardly what I would call a deal given the price and was a real disappointment given the food. The hotspot arrived with only two large neckbones, and enough onions + leeks to attract an ogre (it was literally 80% of the soup's contents). The potatoes that were in the soup were raw, a bit odd since most of the time they're at least parboiled to get them going in the soup. Soup itself had very little flavour, even after simmering for a while. At least the seafood pancake was decent, if not a bit thick and lacking toppings. The set also came with appetizers, which definitely looked like they have been sitting around for a few days. The radish kimchi was basically just grated radish tinted with kimchi juice, the bean sprout appetizer looked grey and limp, and the kimchi. Lordy, the kimchi was a travesty - how can you mess up kimchi? Absolutely bland, no seasoning, and did not pack the characteristic punch kimchi usually does. Many, many thumbs down. \\n\\nWe also ordered some BBQ, which we elected to have the kitchen cook instead of doing it at our table. Huge mistake - the beef bulgogi was flavourful, but overcooked, and the pork belly we got was equally rubbery. It had a nice miso marinade which was great, but I found myself giving my jaw a total workout. The food overall was a huge letdown, and I knew we could've gone to any of the other Korean restaurants in Richmond and gotten a better meal. \\n\\nWhere this place seriously fails is in the service department. They're definitely understaffed (only 3 servers for a pretty big space). We had asked for some ice water and appetizers early on in our meal, and did not get the water until we were almost done - and this was despite repeated attempts to flag down a server and repeated (polite) requests for water. We kept asking one particular server for water and we eventually figured to ask another guy when we realized the original server wouldn't get the water for us (he kept forgetting). Even the new guy kept forgetting! We felt like we were being deliberately ignored, which was made more apparent when I was waving my hand in the air and made eye contact with the first server in this whole debacle, and he averted his gaze completely! I should add that it wasn't particularly busy - there were only about 6-7 other tables aside from us, which 3 servers imo should be more than capable of taking care of. \\n\\nYou know service is bad when you're compelled to get up from your seat to serve yourself - everything from getting water, to looking for take-home containers. We were so fed up at this point that we just decided to pay at the front instead of waiting for a server to get our bill.\\n\\nThis place only has its location going for it.

When they finally found a place in the area one of them offered to take me.  It was his first time at this place, but, he was very excited to try it and to take me.\\n\\nHe ordered a variety of tapas, sticks and main dishes to sample.  While everything was edible, nothing really stood out for either of us as one of those wow, what a great dish moments.\\n\\nSo for tapas, we had chicken wings and eggplant.  These, honestly, were probably the two best things we had all evening.  I'm not an eggplant fan, but, this was well done.  The chicken wings had good flavor and crispness--while they were cooked, other diners might be concerned with the amount of redness still on the bone, but this is how chicken wings should be cooked.\\n\\nFor sticks, the tendon, and lamb were probably the best.  Middle of the road would be the chicken skin and beef, and the worst were the chicken and kidney.  None of them were amazing and at no point did either of us think we would want more.  The reasons for not liking some of them: Chicken skin had good pieces (nice and crisp skin) but also pieces of skin that had too much non-crispiness; the beef was too lean for how it was served (well done); the kidney had a strong flavor, and the chicken had a slight gaminess to it.\\n\\nFor entrees a coconut chicken and a fish for two was ordered.  The coconut chicken was a little overcooked (read: dry), but the flavor overall was decent.  The fish was visually very impressive, but lacked deep flavor.\\n\\nOn a plus note, they do have a bar, and staff was attentive and on point the entire evening.  The place had a good number of guests with the majority looking to be college students (they do offer a 10% discount for students).  \\n\\nWill we be back?  Not certain.

Which in itself is pretty impressive - being an upscale restaurant, where patrons sometimes like to linger over a four course meal for a couple hours, I would think turnaround could be a challenge. They definitely have the seating for it. . . it's located in an industrialish space near one of the postal centers and past some small businesses off of Ralph McGill. There's also not one but two hostesses perched at the front to take the incoming flow of traffic. The space has ridiculously high ceilings and touches like vastly oversized flowers in vases and revolving artwork on display. The kitchen that sits directly in the middle of the main dining area is a bit like watching Iron Chef, but in real life. There's also a patio, which (weather permitting) could be a pretty romantic spot. \\n\\nThe menu changes quite frequently, and I can only image the amount of planning that goes into this. Very cool that you'll get to experience something new every time you visit, but it could be a sad moment if you find a dish you love since it'll likely be gone next time you visit. \\n\\nAnd a note for the ladies: bust out your highest, most uncomfortable shoes here. The valet line is literally right at the entrance of the restaurant. . . you could probably get away with walking like 28 steps or so (unless you have to make a trip to the bathroom). \\n\\nIf you're looking for somewhere quiet to have a serious discussion or take your Auntie Susan who has an aversion to loudness, this won't be ideal.

That was the most delicious thing to put on my tofu omelet. Our waiter was extremely helpful in figuring out what to get. By my third water, I was nipping, so I got the almond milk hot chocolate.

Been 15 years at least since I would venture into the nightmare know as I 75/85 connector they Downtown. That monster ate up half of my 1980's  commuting to GSU. Our cross country trip from SF to CHS was the perfect excuse. My new husband from SF is a Mary Mac's virgin so I was excited to be THE one to accompany him. \\n\\nSo knowing we would be back at least until a Georgia Tech game later that fall  - we ordered like it was the Last Supper! I'm kinda' embarrassed but here goes...\\n\\nOur lovely waitress \\"Zeka\\" kindly brought the virgin his complimentary \\"Pot Likker\\" and cornbread. He promptly spat out the muffin and said ugh something foreign's in my cornbread. I explained to this city boy it was pork cracklin! So then he gobbled the muffin in one bite. \\n\\nFor appetizers we had the Brunswick Stew - I told him it was pretty authentic and they used fresh squirrel and rabbit in their recipe. He didn't flinch and loved every spoonful.  Seriously they don't really - it's just chicken and pork lots of corn and tomatoes and perfect seasonings. I ordered a side of the fried okra which I thought would be in a small dish but it was an overflowing salad plate. I tried hard to eat it all but we couldn't muster knowing he other food we still had coming. Husband likes okra and was happy to know it's acceptable to eat them with ketchup. \\n\\nGood thing we were at a 4 top table 'cause truly we ordered for an entire family. We both got an extra side which made for 6 total! I love all the vegetables they offer - makes me cringe when I go somewhere and the menu list rice and gravy or Mac and cheese as one of their \\"vegetables. \\n\\nSo, TJ had the 4 piece fried chicken which I'd really forgotten how delicate the crispy skin was.  I nearly cried it was so perfect. I went for the chicken pie which in addition to plenty of chicken had a bunch of yummy peas and carrots tucked inside. \\n\\nWe had two orders of collards because this girl never shares collards. I love MM's as much as I love the ones I cook but they're better here since it doesn't make your kitchen smell so skinny. So many meat & 3 spots add sugar I guess to make them palatable for non-collard waters. I want salty, hammy, with just enough fat in the broth to give it some body. \\n\\nI also had my staple rice and brown gravy. It's not MM's if I don't have my rice and gravy. Also the green beans which are cooked in chicken or ham stock. (I learned that from Mrs Lupos cookbook years ago. Never use water in cooking vegetables but use a big ol' aseptic box of Swanson's bone broth.) TJ shared his yams (not the sweet potato souffl√©) but yams are generally too sweet for me so I passed but I did eat half of his butter peas. \\n\\nNearly forgot the super fresh creamed corn! It's deserving of its own paragraph anyway. \\n\\nI admit we didn't eat everything - we were pretty measured. And, he wanted room for the peanut butter pie with the Oreo crust and whipped cream. Not liking sweets too much,  I'm skeptical of any desserts. This pie was the exception though - great mix of chocolate, the salty nutty peanut butter and just a tiny bit of sweetened whipped cream. He liked that happy ending and like Goldilocks, I thought it was JUST perfect! \\n\\nThe food was every bit good as I remember. Makes me laugh - some of these Yelp reviews that say Mary Mac's food is bland and then the writer proceeds to order Mac and cheese and potatoes and/or rice and/or French fries. Ummm... yes your food's bland ' cause you ordered nothing but starches, dong dong!\\n\\nI did see the saddest most pitiful site ever at the table next to me. Took this family 15 - 20 minutes to jot their orders down (that they had to write their own orders was perplexing in itself - the Kids curiously handled their pencils and I'm sure quietly wished they could text their order straight to the kitchen.) When it finally arrived, the two college-aged children both had chicken strips, French fries and applesauce!! seriously folks - there are About 30 sides that your mama will likely never cook for you at home!!! And that's what you ordered? Young folks need to get out of their food comfort zones. What a missed opportunity.\\n\\nThat was wordy for sure but I love that place and the mismatched tables and chairs, the vinyl table cloths and melamine plates and monkey dishes. I sure hope they've kept the ones I ate from back in the day. So much heart and charm in this institution.

I searched up things to do there and what to eat. I remember reading this particular guide online, and the picture that was used to represent the city was a maple doughnut with bacon on it. My first thought: WTF?\\n\\nAnd it's funny because the article mentioned nothing about Voodoo Doughnut. I had to search around on other websites to realize that the maple bacon doughnut was a popular thing at Voodoo.\\n\\nThe length of the line outside of Voodoo was daunting at first, but I've stood in longer lines (I texted my best friend and said that this had better be the best tasting doughnut I've ever had). After about half an hour, I finally reached the front of the line, and scanned the menu for the proper name of the doughnut with bacon on it. \\n\\nAfter I bought the doughnut, I went and sat on one of the benches outside of the shop and took pictures of it. It was lovely! The two slices of bacon on it looked perfectly cooked, and the brown maple icing was enticing. When I ate the thing, I thought it was so good at first (although my arteries probably felt differently), but my taste buds quickly decided that the doughnut was too sweet. The icing to bacon ratio is slightly off. I wish I had more of the saltiness of the bacon to balance out the sweetness of the icing. The doughnut itself was soft and tasty, so that was good. The last bite of the doughnut had no bacon on it, so it was just this sickeningly sweet thing.\\n\\nWas the doughnut worth the wait? Yes. Yes, it was. Was it the best doughnut I've ever had? No. But that's ok because they didn't promise that.\\n\\nBTW, this is a cash only place, and there's a sign outside that says no pennies (not sure if this is legit or not)... so keep your jars of pennies at home!"},{"name":"Voodoo Doughnut - Old Town","address":"22 SW 3rd Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"Donuts were okay.

The crust is speckled with char and it very thin and crisp. The char adds flavor and makes it extra yummy. The toppings were fresh and generous on both pizzas. I think if you are hungry, one pizza per person works. The crust is so thin that it isn't necessarily as filling as a thicker crust pizza would be. We also tried two desserts which were the salted caramel panna cotta and the hazelnut chocolate budino. I preferred the budino, which is like a pudding consistency, because I'm not a really big fan of the salty/sweet desserts (but the panna cotta is tasty if you do like salty/sweet desserts).

The cornbread proved a bit dry, and the regular yeast roll was pretty good too.\\n\\nNow, on to the experience. The place is sort of old-fashioned, in that they hand everyone at the table a menu and then a small piece of paper where you're expected to write down your own  order. What kind of bread, appetizer, first course, second course,  dessert, drink. \\n\\nIt's very much southern food: chicken, fried foods, and carbs galore. I got roast chicken with gravy, stuffing, and cranberry sauce. Each entree came with two small sides, and from that list, I decided on broccoli souffle (very greasy, only ate about half), and the mac and cheese (noodles so overcooked that they were almost mushy).

I remember back when we first moved into the area in the mid-'90s my parents coming up to visit, and we all went out to Hall Street Grill.  The food was excellent.  I still remember the elephant garlic, cambozola cheese and tomato chutney on crisp crostini appetizer I had there 20 years back.  In fact, we loved it so much, we have been making it as an appetizer at home for years now.  \\n\\nSo, when a Groupon appeared for a Four-course dinner for two for $56 (normally $100) we decided we'd be doing that tonight.\\n\\nFriday night, 7:00.  We arrived with reservations to a packed house and even more-packed parking lot.  We were seated relatively quickly, maybe 10 minutes which we didn't think was bad given how busy they appeared to be.\\n\\nTonight's four course meal was a starter \\"to share\\" of Coconut-crusted Fried Prawns.  Then a course of Caesar Salad or Clam Chowder.  Dinner course was a choice of New York Strip or macadamia-crusted Mahi Mahi.  Dessert was a Creme Brulee to share.\\n\\nBread arrived.  This was definitely not fresh-baked.  We suspect it was a baguette from yesterday, and was quite dry.  The compound butter had an odd sweet flavor from what we think were caramelized onions.  Had the bread been fresh this could have been an excellent combination.\\n\\nFirst course: A rectangular plate of prawns.  I always find it fascinating when a restaurant brings a \\"plate to share\\" with an odd number of elements.  This one had five prawns.  So, who gets two and who gets three?  Someone's going home unequal.  Thankfully, Wife N hates coconut so I got all five, and the crisis was averted.  They were decent.  The shrimp were perfectly cooked, and the coconut crust was pretty nice.  \\n\\nSecond course: We went one-and-one, with Wife N having the Caesar and I the clam chowder.  Trying each others' plates we agreed that the Caesar was honestly below average.  It was the \\"creamy\\" style but really didn't have a lot of flavor.  No lemon nor anchovies in it gave it a great big hole where the acid and salt should have been.  The dressing was mostly flavorless save for one bite where I think I got all the garlic--that was the best bite I had.  The clam chowder was inoffensive--it had clams and tasted okay, but was far from the best I've had; very average.\\n\\nDinner course:  Wife N went for the Strip.  I had the fish.  The steak looked really big, probably eight inches long, and I'm thinking in the range of around 12 ozs.  We wanted it medium rare, so we ordered it rare (a trick we've come to use anywhere we order steak not from a top-tier steak house because no one knows how to actually cook a steak medium rare on command).  It came perfectly mid rare. Unfortunately, that was about the only \\"win\\" with this steak.  It was incredibly gristly; almost every cut found itself navigating around un-severable bands of sinew.  The steak was just okay.  The flavor was fine, but this was clearly not a great cut and not good butchering of that cut.  My Mahi Mahi was cooked to perfection, and was reasonably flavorful.  It sat on a bed of parsnip puree, and had a lovely fruit salsa on top.  Not a bad plate.\\n\\nThe dessert, Creme brulee, was fantastic.  This was easily the hit of the night.  The custard had perfect texture, was even all the way through (a sign of good baking technique) and the crackly caramelized top was perfect, not burned or under-browned.\\n\\nThe \\"regular\\" price of this meal, had it not been on a Groupon, was $50 a person.  After presenting the discount, our check came to $19 (evidently, they charge an automatic 18% gratuity which is both annoying and insulting, given that I tend to tip above that anyway).  Groupon price $56 (44% off).  \\n\\nOn the whole, we were disappointed with how Hall Street has gone downhill over the years.  The food was over-priced (even with the discount), poorly prepared and just lacked anything that would have made it a memorable meal.  Their regular menu items are in the $20-35/plate range, which place Hall Street Grill squarely in the upscale-dining range.  I need to remind myself that any time a Groupon appears for a venue that's been around for 20+ years, it should be seen as a warning sign.  On our way out we noticed the signs that said as of the end of the month, they will no longer be serving lunch, and will be Happy Hour and Dinner only. \\n\\nLittle bit of sadness as I left there this evening.

Affixed to the regular menu are the After-5 Chef Specials. I was in the mood for a glass of red wine and a nice seafood dish. MY attention was immediately captuted by the Crab & Avocado Crusted Salmon. The cashier, who took my order was less than friendly and looked as if she wanted to be somewhere else, but she promptly took my order, poured my glass of wine, and assigned me a number to sit on my table, so the food runner would know where to deliver the appropriate order.\\n\\nWell, I must say the salmon was some of the best tasting salmon I have had in a  long time. My plate featured two nice sized salmon fillets , topped with a shredded crab/avocado stuffing. My side item was garlic mashed potatoes. Also, I was given the choice of a croissant or tuscan bread to accompany my meal. I chose the croissant, which was hot, fresh and glazed with a sort of honey butter. The food was exxxxxxtra tasty, even though the salmon was a little over cooked, but I got over it. I think it would also be helpful to know that the mashed potatoes were garnished with chives/green onions.

They were extremely full when we arrived (7:30pm on a Friday night), so I was initially quite happy to give them the benefit of the doubt when service was a little slow.\\n\\nInitially.\\n\\nTwenty minutes after we were seated, the waiter came by to take our drinks order.  Twenty minutes after he took our order, drinks and the bread came out.  REALLY??  Forty minutes to give a table some bread?!  it was some sort of foccacia that was overly salted, with a tray of some mixed herbs and very strange olives that you're meant to pour the olive oil onto.  The flavors just didn't work.  And this was the bread.  (The waiter also got my drink order incorrect but promptly fixed it, quipping \\"well I'll just have to drink this one!\\" as he took the glass away.  It might explain some things if he did  . . . I'll also state briefly that he was completely unfamiliar with the menu.)\\n\\nMy appetizer was the Mirabella salad: \\"fresh mixed field greens with goat cheese, walnuts and cherry tomatoes,\\" for $8.95.  I don't mean to pick, but that's exactly what it was: Someone emptied a bag of lettuce onto a plate, threw on 6 or 7 cherry tomatoes, some walnuts, and hunks of goat cheese.  The dressing was that thick, vinegarette-type that has too much sugar and corn starch, straight from some bottle.  It wasn't awful, but it wasn't great.  It was a solid, $3.50 salad.  My parents got the crab cakes (OK, slightly dry, the onion rings underneath were what really made the dish), and mussels (nothing to write home about.)\\n\\nThe kicker was my entree - Three Cheese Ravioli.  This is my only explanation for what must have happened:  The pasta chef had been sick for a week and after depleting all their precious reserves, Pescatore, out of bare, desperate necessity, replenished their stores in the discount section at Stop & Shop.  I mean, I hope that's what happened because for food of this quality to be standard at their restaurant would be scary.  These ravioli SUCKED.  They were obviously cheap, frozen pasta - not \\"homemade.\\"  The sauce was too acidic, and also obviously canned.  My father's food - Fusilli Amalfi - was OK but he also was unimpressed with the pasta.  The one redeeming dish was my mother's, the special (I think it was bass.)  She loved it and says it was perfectly done.  That dish saved Pescatore from the one star rating.\\n\\nFor dessert my father and I both had the tiramisu.  It tasted OK, but was really soggy and oversaturated - probably plated four or 5 hours ago and sitting in the fridge since then.\\n\\nSo here's the summary: There was one very good dish out of 8.  Service was poor.  The wait - for everything except the initial table (we'd made reservations) was unbelievable.  I could have gone to Stop & Shop and recreated my exact menu with better quality ingredients in a quarter of the time for $15.  But the special was great.  So, take your chances!

Get some oysters (delicious) and a shrimp cocktail (refreshing) to go along with our beers and drinks.  1 hour later we are still waiting.\\n\\nNow we are torn: do we leave and go finish off with entrees somewhere else that can seat and serve us?  Or do we wait, as it's already been an hour and it can't be that much longer.  We ask the hostess.  She says to just wait 2 minutes.  It is still 30 more minutes before we get seated and by then we are all agitated.  \\n\\nThe food was OK, the clam chowder amazing (creamy yummy and flavorful) and the lobster ravioli (also creamy and full of flavor and some good chunks of lobster) the appetizer portion was perfect for what I was needing.

Our waitress was completely unprofessional and needs to be retrained or find a new job. \\n\\nI ordered the pulled pork sandwich with Cajun tatter tots, food comes out to the table with these domes on the plates, so you are expecting something awesome right?

The pizza was nasty and had an overwhelming amount of Gorgonzola on it. The waitress must hate her job because she did a fine job of bashing the cooks made several comments to our table about how lazy they were.

He had eaten there before, and was enthusiastic, so we gave it a green light.  A friend we'll call Table-Getter arrived about thirty minutes before us and was informed of a forty-five minute wait.  He was directed first to the full bar where he stood a bit, then to the front deck to sit and wait on his table, and was also rather snippishly told to move from both places.  Team, if you want people to sit somewhere, you need to make it clear where they can actually sit.  For your reference it's the metal patio chairs out by the chiminea.\\n\\nWe arrived with birthday friend in tow, and were seated almost immediately.  Despite our place-holder's estimated forty-five minute wait, the party was seated in thirty minutes.  I should pause here and talk about the decor that looks like June Cleaver's kitchen.  It's totes adorbs.  Inviting, warm, and comfortable.\\n\\nFor the food, be aware that it's mostly meant to be shared.  \\n\\nWe ordered the labneh, fried oysters, and potato chips for appetizers.  The labneh was a runaway hit - the boy hates beets but loves the smooth, earthy taste with that zest of lemon zing of this dish.  And the 'everything crackers'?  Addictive.  The potato chips were clearly made in house and the pairing with the pimento cheese was unusual, but this can be safely skipped.  I normally object on principle to wasting perfectly good oysters by battering them and frying them, but I have to admit - they were delicious.  Don't skip dipping the perfectly crunchy morsel in that dressing (made of jalepeno, lemon, and coriander of all things), either.  Votes held the oysters a step below the labneh, which was the clear winner.\\n\\nOur next round were the crab toast and the soft egg toast.  We found the crab toast to be a little lackluster (the crab is served cold on the warm toast) but still tasty.  We'll probably skip the crab toast next time and go straight to the soft egg toast, because oh my Cthulu it is amazeballs.  What a beautiful medley of flavors on such a contrasting set of textures and just OH MY.  The table agreed that the soft egg toast won that round unanimously.\\n\\nWe opted for the charred octopus, hanger steak, and chicken thighs next.  I found the octopus to be boring even when I made sure to get a little bit of everything in a bite, and I'm usually the guy who LOVES octopus.  The hanger steak was excellently prepared and well flavored (chimichurri sauce, as is common  now in Austin with hanger and flank steak), but a bit chewier than I like.  The chicken thighs were quite tasty, but you gotta understand that Scotch Bonnets are right next to the more commonly known habenero peppers on the Scoville scale, so they are SPICY AS FUCK.  Not in an \\"you can't take a bite of this or you will die\\" kind of way, but it's definitely not for the faint of heart, slow burn or no slow burn.  There wasn't a clear winner this round, but the chicken thighs probably lead in points with the hanger steak a close second.\\n\\nOn veggies, we had the roasted parsnip, the Brussell sprouts, and frites.  The sprouts were good - chargrilled and served with a apple-bacon marmalade glaze - but not particularly standout from other similar dishes around town.  The parnsip split the table in half - I loved it and so did Table-Getter, but Boy and Birthday-Guy  hated it,and Spicy-Food was indecisive.  A literal split vote even with five people.  It's the incredible sweetness of the apple-butter that turned them off, but to Table-Getter and I, it was precisely that sweetness that was needed to balance the bitter and stark flavor of the parsnip and pickled mustard seeds.  An exercise in balance.  The frites were, well, fries - quite as good as the truffle fries at 2ND Kitchen, and possibly our new favorite in town.\\n\\nWe considered getting something off the Specialties part of the menu, but frankly, the we were stuffed.  We'll get back to try the rest soon, though.\\n\\nThe waiter comped Birthday-Guy a \\"Birthday Cake Ice Cream Sandwich\\", which is an ice cream sandwich that tastes EXACTLY like a birthday cake tastes.  Which is both amazing, slightly curious, and creepy as hell.  What do they do, extract birthday cake essence from uneaten birthday cakes and infuse it into the milk?  Creepy.  But yummy.\\n\\nThe boys all had drinks, but I stuck with a nice pinot noir for once.  They were quite impressed by the drinks but I don't remember what they ordered.\\n\\nThis is, without question, our favorite place in town.  We spent the entire meal talking about the food we were eating and we LOVED it.  Dishes were plated perfectly, service wasn't amazing but they're new so we can forgive it, and in the end, the bill was about $50 each (without booze).  That's damn cheap as far as I'm concerned.\\n\\nI'd give it six stars if I could, for realsies.

They have several locations throughout Oregon as well as a few others around the US. Given that we've visited their stores in LA and Denver, it was time to visit their original location. \\n\\nVoodoo Doughnuts is located in the heart of downtown Portland, Oregon. Parking is available on the streets, local parking garages, or in pay for the day lots. You'll notice a line outside of the store with pink metal barriers set up to guide people inside. It's a small shop so only a small number of people can be inside at one time. Also, the entrance and exit doors are adjacent to each other and so people often experience difficulties when trying to leave the store. The exit is usually blocked by people who are standing in line and employees are not that great at keeping that doorway clear.\\n\\nWhen we made our way inside, we saw all of the familiar items on the menu. They were all visually appealing with all kinds of creative toppings and ingredients. I love how this location has a bit more than their LA shop because you could see the full range of what they really have.\\n\\nWhen it was time to order, I honed In on my favorite doughnut, bubblegum! The sprinkles taste just like bubblegum and it comes with a piece of gum placed in the center of the doughnut. Now Voodoo is famous for their C&B doughnut that is shaped like the lower region of the male anatomy. Being an elementary school teacher, I will not state the actual name of  the doughnut but the abbreviation should give you a big hint as to what it's actually called.\\n\\nAnyway, as my husband placed his order for two C&B doughnuts, they told us that they ran out of them. They said that they only had the vegan  version of this dessert. So when they went to get the doughnuts from the back, they came back and said that they only have one vegan C&B left. Since we wanted two C&B doughnuts, they said that they could sell us the other one that was revolving around in the glass display case. I asked if it was fresh and they said, \\"Not really, but we'll give it to you for free.\\" We  were cool with that because we ended up with one vegan doughnut and the other one that had been on display for a bit. I can't attest for how the C&B tasted because we picked them up for family members who live in the area.\\n\\nIn general, I absolutely love the creativity behind this establishment. They are definitely ahead of the game when it comes to marketing. Their line always stretches out the door and it's because of customer loyalty and the novelty of this place.

I was stuffed for HOURS later. And I left plenty of biscuit on the plate - it was just too much. The chicken was moist and flavorful, but the skin fell off the meat. Not a major issue. There wasn't enough gravy. And I am saying that as a person who doesn't even really like gravy. Ha! They made me like gravy. You really need more gravy for the amount of biscuit. I am sure that if I wanted more that they could have done so. In fact, Christian told me that if you ever unhappy with your meal to please talk to someone and request something new. They will gladly swap it out. That is very comforting. \\n\\nAbout the environment, this place is totally funky in a good way. The atmosphere is wonderful. Love the decor and vibe.

Once he came back and told us that they were (around) $9 , I decided to order a salad as well. The annoying part is that I got a nice big salad, but when the frittata came out, it also came with a decent size portion of the same salad. A good server would have mentioned that the main course came with a side salad so that I wouldn't waste my money ordering one.

The waitress brought the bill which was over 50 dollars and it seemed unfair to pay for something I didn't eat, the manager came over apologised took the bill and said he'd remove the scallops from it. Next thing I know a guy named Joe who introduced himself as the owner started making me feel horrible for saying the food was not good, I was not able to get much in as he become very belligerent and threatening saying how i disrespected him, apparently making my gf feel very uncomfortable as other customers stared in shock is not disrespectful what so ever. I would make a formal complaint but this guy would not care! You do not talk to customers the way asthis owner did, he had the nerve to say how dare I watch him bust his balls and tell him the food was horrible, he began to say there was nothing wrong with the food at all and maybe I didn't know what I was talking about.

The only thing I felt bad about was the waitress not getting her tip, she came over and apologized for the owner and said she was completely embarrassed.

I notified them that, I was told $5 but the parking attendant said \\"well now it's $10,\\" with no explanation! I asked to see the supervisor, he lied and said he was the supervisor.

Nowhere near what I would do for this sandwich.\\n\\nTheir cheesecake is the best I've had in Austin.

Now what!  We were really looking forward to some southern food...  so - yelp to the rescue...  find some southern food nearby with no line out the door.\\n\\nSo we ended up at Mary Mac's.   Surprisingly - no one waiting, yet there was a 30 minute wait!  It looked as though the whole back room of the place was hosting a private party, so I suppose thats why we had to wait.   \\n\\nThe place is conveniently located, but parking is awful - we found a perfect meter spot, but $2 for 1 hour in a meter!?? are you kidding me??  Who carries that many quarters around??  Atlanta, I want to love you - but you drive me crazy sometimes.  So after searching around for some place to give us change for a couple dollars, we finally sat down for dinner.  \\n\\nThe menu is great - you can order any typical southern dish...  and you write down your order on a little order sheet.   I believe these people make their stuff from scratch, too -  kind of like a meat & three, but better.  My boyfriend got the meatloaf and it was amazing!  I got fried chicken tenders (I know, cop out - but I didn't feel like dealing with chicken bones), and they tasted like they'd been sitting under a heat lamp.  Not crispy and kinda rubbery.  Not very appetizing (which is why I subtracted 1 star - sorry, you're not allowed to screw up something so simple) My other complaint with this place was we were starving, so we ordered an appetizer...  which came out promptly and was delicious (fried green tomatoes) but then 1 minutes later, our entrees came out!  WTF!  Give us some time to eat our appetizer before you inundate us with food!  So it was hard to even enjoy the appetizer.  I understand restaurants being ready and having food ready to go, but seriously.. hold off 10 minutes.  It will make a HUGE difference in people's impression of a restaurant.   But one more praise for the place... the squash casserole was delicious.  One of the best I've had.  So, three stars you get...  for the few great things, and the few irritating things.

My dinner companion had been served her filet without the asparagus which they later brought once it was brought to attention. For plates priced $30 and up in a busy restaurant, I'd expect some sort of expediting should be taking place in the kitchen. The food was good, it wasn't magical but it was good. \\n\\nWe had the tuna appetizer and although the fish was tasty, I had some really stringy tuna...the white fatty part should be trimmed off and it was so stringy and still connected to all the little pieces of fish and hard to eat without cutting. I had a grouper special that was pan seared with some spice rub over a salad of arugula, farro, cucumbers and carrots with a vinaigrette that had a little truffle in it.

It has Bangladeshi versions of vegetable and chicken samosas, and vegetable pakoras (aka deep fried balls of deliciousness). The shrimp poori is also one of my favorites. you get a big puff of bread that you deflate and put an onion/shrimp mixture in, roll up like a burrito, and chow down!\\n\\nBoth the Mulligatawny and Halim soups are killer. They are lentil based so they are really savory. The Halim has more heat than the Mulligatawny so make sure to have some water handy! \\n\\nMy two favorite entrees are the Korma and the Tikka Masala. You can choose your meat for each (chicken, lamb, shrimp, paneer - aka cheese, or goat!) and go to town! Basmati rice acts as your base and you spoon the sauce and meat on top. Tikka Masala is a tomato based ride to flavor town that is like the best tomato soup you ever had but as a rich cream sauce that's much thicker. Korma is a sweet yellow dish which has plump raisins that give it just that hint of sweetness. I recommend this one with shrimp - the flavors really compliment nicely.\\n\\nAnother bonus - it's BYOB but they don't have a corking fee. Wine, beer, liquor, whatever suits your fancy. They will take stuff that needs to be kept cold to their fridge in the back so it's perfect when you need it.\\n\\nJust writing this review is making my mouth water. Definitely a must visit!

Meals are about $10 - $15. The restaurant was spacious and the decor was traditional - nothing special, just clean and comfortable. The service was outstanding - very friendly and welcoming. A friend and I, Midwesterners, wanted a Southern food experience - Mary Mac's fit the bill. After we were seated, we received a basket of breads - corn bread, yeast bread and sweet bread. We started our meals with \\" potlicker\\" soup with cornbread. Our entrees were fried chicken with cheese gravy and pork slices with gravy and stuffing.Each entree was accompanied by two sides- we ordered the fried green tomatoes, tomato pie, mac and cheese (a specialty) and dumplings. Certainly, we could not finish everything we ordered - there was a lot of food. We shared the food so we could sample it all. Surprisingly to me, I liked the tomato pie and the fried green tomatoes best. Overall, the food was a little too fried, a little too gravied and a little too bread-y for my \\"northerner\\" tastes, but as a sampler of Southern food, it was good.

I'll throw that out there first. There were like 8 or 9 of us, so we ordered like 4 of the family dinner combos (which are ridiculously great deals for the amount of food that you get). We were able to try a wide variety of offerings from their menu including spring rolls, crab rangoon, roast pork, fried shrimp, sweet and sour chicken, sesame chicken, general's chicken, mushroom chicken, mongolian beef, pork fried rice, hot and sour soup, and egg flower soup. Out of all of this food there was not a single moment where i took a bite of something and thought to myself, \\"wow, that's tasty.\\" But all pompousness aside, there were legitimate issues with some of this stuff. The roast pork was overcooked, dry, and tasted like it had been sitting out for more than a few hours. The fried shrimp had way too much batter, which soaked up too much grease, and ultimately made it awful to eat. None of the chicken dishes were exciting. Fried nuggets covered in sweet dark syrup. I mean, they weren't bad; just very boring. My biggest problem with what we were served was that the pork fried rice was not fried rice at all. Like, they literally microwaved white rice and poured soy sauce on it, then put chopped roast pork on top. I wish i was kidding. I don't claim to be an expert on fried rice, but I am Chinese myself and grew up eating the stuff, and i worked in a restaurant that made really good fried rice (amongst a lot of other things) for 3.5 years, and i can definitively say, the fried rice at Happy House was shit.\\n\\nAll that being said, there are redeeming qualities to this place. The back bar. Very friendly bartenders. Jello shots. $1 pints of the mysterious Happy House Lager. A juke box. Video poker. A pool table. Arcade games. Like 7 or 8 televisions. I love the back bar.

I had both options.  The vegetarian ones are better in my opinion.  Not  spicy with a subtle sweetness (characteristic of bengali cuisine) . The pakoras tasted homemade.  Not overly greasy.  I also ordered the chicken tikka naan. Which at $5 was a rip off, with only specs of chicken in it.  The naan itself though was actually soft, fluffy and delicious!

My roommates got the biscuits and sausage gravy and the steak and eggs. My eggs Benedict was good, nothing that screams I want to come back here again for it, but wouldn't be opposed to it. The home fries that came with it were well seasoned and soft! The French toast is deeelish!! Don't even need the maple syrup on top because the whipped cream is sweet enough. It's always nice to have just a little sweet with the savory breakfast. I tried my roommates dishes and the biscuits and sausage gravy was good, but probably too much of the same thing.

Instead, I received a few shavings of the Townsman salami and a few shavings of another meat, three tiny biscuits (they were appropriately fluffly), and some pickled vegetables.  Nada mas (no more).  For $$$, that was not worth it but most importantly, the taste kick was absent.  Possibly because the shavings of meat were so invisibly thin.

Once my party had all arrived, we were seated in the back of the restaurant by the patio door. \\nThe problems started with the seating. There was bench seating, which was fine, but on the opposite side of the table, were low benches instead of chairs. My gf is 5'11\\" and after taking a seat on the bench, she looked like a midget as the table came just below her chest. \\nWe were promptly greeted by our waiter Christopher. Water glasses were poured and we started out with apps of the salmon chips and hush puppies. While everyone raves about the salmon chips, they were good, but not deserving of the accolades. The salmon was a tad fishy and should have been smoked more. The fish was choppy and the chips could have used more cream on the bottom layer. The hushpuppies were good, but not your average breaded bites; instead, they were filled balls of cheese with a kick.\\nFor our meals we ordered the scallops and gouda grits, chicken, mac and cheese, and \\"lump crab cake\\". The scallops were good and the chicken was great, but the mac and cheese lacked any and all seasoning and the supposed lump crab cake was terrible! Their was noticeably no lump as the crab meat had the consistency of canned tuna fish and filled with way too many herbs, so it basically tasted like an herb ball with sauce.\\nFor dessert, we ordered the bananas foster and brown butter cake. I dine all over the world at a minimum of 4 days a week and this was the worst dessert that I have had in a very long time. For starters, bananas fosters normally is sliced bananas with a noticeably bruleed covering and maybe a little sauce. Two's version came in an ice cream dish...really?! With sliced bananas at the bottom, covered in a lot of sauce, complete with a dollop of canned reddy whip and a maraschino cherry on top! Um....maybe that's cute for a 5 year old, but not a grown ass adult. We promptly sent it back as in addition to everything wrong about it, it tasted like an apple crisp.The brown butter cake was just decent, albeit a little dry and flat. In 39 years, I can count on one hand the amount of times that I have disliked my dessert and Two Urban Licks just rounded out a full hand.\\nI almost forgot....we did not know that the door to the patio was actually accessible since it was like 30 degrees out, but we found out the hard way....about 4 times.

You walk in, and you see possibly 6 employees behind the counter, each slowly doing some mindless task. Each will look up at the counter and see you, and all will go back to what they are doing. Eventually, one dejected soul will sigh and walk to the counter to take your order. No receipts are ever offered, or given when using a card. You then take your number and walk to find a table to sit at. ALWAYS, there are AT LEAST 50% of the tables dirty. Sometimes all but one table was filthy. So, you sit down at one of the few clean ones and wait. All in all, the bagels are good, the food is consistently decent. But, the help is terrible. Customer service is terrible. How can there be no concept of this? There are 6 people on the clock, probably making mininum wage, but honestly, could the owner try to hire employees that have the slightest concept of customer service? And consider paying them a bit more than minimum wage? You will get better help, and would eliminate at least one slow employee. As it stands, 90% of your staff dosen't smile, can't work with customers very well, and can't manage \\nkeeping an eye on things that need intermittent attention. For example, send someone out to clean off the freekin' tables every 20 minutes?? Take out the trash? Sweep the floor? Say thank you to customers as they leave? 90% of these employees that have been hired care more about having tattoos on their arms, and shopping at the coolest thrift stores, than to actually have an understanding of representing their employer, and his business. After all, the customer is what keeps the employer in business, and the employer pays the employee to serve the customer.

Andina is not like that- the food is actually well thought out and of adequate portions despite being small. \\n\\nFor my last meal in Portland, I tried the Causa Mixta Nikkei and the Cebiche Mixto (labeled \\"Mixto Chorrillano\\" on their menu. ) That causa was nothing short of glorious.The seafood was just out of this world and perfectly seasoned and flavored. The texture worked well together with the stringy texture of crab, with the light crunch of the prawn, and the tender yet firm potato. The cebiche was also nothing short of excellent with very fresh seafood. \\n\\nThe service was impeccable with an attentive, yet not pretentious and overbearing. \\nThey also have a dedicated vegetarian menu which is PHENOMENAL in a place that serves high caliber omni food. If you have a vegan SO in your life that you don't neglect, you probably are familiar with the constant compromise of trying to find a restaurant that is decent that appeals to both omnis and vegans. \\n\\nWhat really made it a night was having an after dinner cup of Stumptown coffee served with lump sugar and a delectable alfajore before my red eye flight to DC.

Friday night i was downtown and trying to think of somewhere to eat and then i see it \\"Frank\\" on the side of their building and i was reminded of this amazing looking menu.  I convince my friend this is the place.  I've studied their menu a few times and i know of the jackalope and know that it sounds amazing.  I also know they have poutine and i mean, what's not to like about fries, brown gravy and cheese?  So we started with a large poutine to share and it was quite fabulous.  The gravy really made the dish stand out to me.  It was so savory and tasted like fresh homemade beef gravy.  For the main course i was torn, Jackalope or a daily creation Duck Rogers?  The Duck Rogers was duck and pork sausage stuffed with gruyere on a roll with a mango-habanero aoli with fried shallots and cotija cheese.  I ended up going with the Duck Rogers.  It didn't disappoint at all.  The aoli was really spicy.  I just wished there were more shallots and cotija cheese.  It was delicious but i feel there could've been more balance.  Their cocktails are amazing as well.  I had the Militia Manhattan (bacon infused maker's mark) and it was perfectly balanced.  I've had maker's manhattan's and they've been pretty strong and not balanced.  This was great!  I later on had their Ranch House Lemonade with Woodford Reserve, Lemon Juice, ginger syrup and blood orange juice.  Holy shit was that refreshing!  Not bad on the pocketbook either.

The interior is beautiful and they did a great job with the layout, decor and ceiling sound proofing panels. It's an architectural detail a lot of restaurants overlook. It's great to dine in a busy, crowded restaurant and not have to shout at your dinner companions or your waiter.\\n\\nBased on the reviews below, we arrived around 5:30 p.m. on a Thursday and was seated right away. Our timing was perfect as we learned the wait was 90 minutes less than one hour later. \\n\\nThe cocktails were great. The margaritas and spruce goose were very good. They did forget a few of our cocktails and we had to wait a very long time for them. The waiter did comp them because they took so long, but he also gave a long winded excuse that they had a long wait and the one bartender was overwhelmed. Based on the reviews below and the crowd at this place from day one, they should consider hiring more than one bartender. \\n\\nThe food was hit or miss. The chicken thighs were delightful, tender and juicy. The mussels were super, also delicious, but they could have increased the portion by a mere 20% and it would have been enough for a dinner entree. The brussel sprouts and endive were also very good, but both were way too sweet. The labneh had great flavors, but the presentation was challenging. The ratio of crackers to hummus was off and it was virtually impossible to scrap up the tiny drizzles of hummus. \\n\\nThe toast was laughable. I know everybody is goo goo gaa gaa about the whole toast craze, but seriously--$9 for a tiny piece of toast with barely 1.5 TBSP of crab on it moved Laundrette down the list of someplace I'd consider returning to try again to yet another pretentious, over-hyped, all style and no substance place to be seen in Austin. \\n\\nThe service was mediocre. Our waiter pretty much ignored us with the exception of telling us about the cocktail bottleneck. Even though he raced by our table many times to tend to other tables, we had to embarrassingly flag him down for a few simple requests. The rest of the team was very aggressive in terms of clearing our plates. A few times we had to stop them because we were not finished. I also noticed that a lot of the people working there looked unhappy. Perhaps we weren't as entertaining or interesting as the sea of over-tanned, short-shorted, big-haired babes that flooded the restaurant after us. \\n\\nI'd rather spend my $150 at Central Market and make  a couple of kickass dinners then waste money so I can tell all my friends that \\"Yes, oh yes, I ate at Launderette.

The price for what you get, the bargain, the value... is off-kilter a bit in my opinion.\\n\\nI like this place a lot , as I've said before. I really want to be here and to eat their nice concoctions and I want them to succeed. \\n\\nThe people are still nice although a little more closed off then before when I last reviewed. I didnt' recognize anyone other than Daniel and Tyler was at the bar. \\n\\nWhen they were just opening, they were humble and just starting out and approachable. Now they are maybe slightly smug, a bit reserved, maybe elitist if that is even correct? This most recent time I chatted with Daniel, the owner, he could barely pull himself away from his iPhone just to say hello. He apologized for it but being in the wireless field, I know how much it means just to put the damn phone away for a minute when talking face to face. Granted, we don't know each other outside of his restaurant but in the past we always talked shop and such and at least seemed to enjoy each others company.\\n\\nI have been for their regular lunch during the weekday and have enjoyed it very much except for the value. The price is too high.\\n\\nOn my last visit I went for their Sunday brunch. I ordered the french toast which was very tasty but the toast in question was two 1/4 inch slices cut in angles. I imagined 1/2 inch or more, \\"Texas Toast\\" sort of toast, ya know?\\n\\nAnyway... The food is still good, the staff is still friendly enough... it's just the price that is hard to swallow now.

I guess there was only one table where our party could be accommodated, and the party who was seated there before us overstayed their welcome by over an hour.  The host/manager were very apologetic and kept us apprised, but it was nonetheless frustrating.  We had two pregnant ladies in our group who were hungry!  When we finally were seated, there were (comped) appetizers already on the table, which was nice, but felt like too small of a gesture for how long we had waited.

For the two times I have been here, it was packed both times, regardless of dinner time or late afternoon lunch. This is a popular restaurant, with its prime location. \\n\\nAfter you are seated, the staffs will treat you in an slightly overwhelming way, as they are almost overly friendly. Different staffs will constantly walk to your table and ask if you are being taken care of or if you need anything. At least 4 different waiters/waitresses stopped by our table when we were still reading through the menu, it felt like they were rushing us almost in a sense, or maybe they were just trying to be as efficient as possible since there were people waiting. \\n\\nThe dishes came up way quicker than I expected, especially the takoyaki, soon after we finished it, the ramens followed right up. Those were the best takoyaki I have ever had. The fillings were creamy but not heavy, and the sauce was just on the spot. The sauce was not overly acidic but you still taste a slight hit of acidity, went perfect as a combination with the takoyaki. The ramen sounds however on the other hand, was quite good, but not as good at the ones from the Santouka in Mitsuwa Marketplace down in NJ. The broth was not as enriched in flavor which made the ramen a bit lacking in flavors. The rice bowl that came with the ramen as a combo was largely lacking toppings (depending on your choice, such as pork or salmon). Felt like I was eating plain rice after half way through.

I really kept optimistic throughout the whole thing. My rating is for the overall experience and food:\\n\\nIt started out great! I was excited to take advantage of their free Uber ride since I was staying in downtown. I was meeting my friend there for our reservation at 8pm. The staff said they would call me before then to arrange the ride. At 8:05 I got a call asking where I needed to be picked up from, and then how many people were going. I said just myself and that I was meeting my friend there. He then informed me that the uber rides were only for two or more passengers. Um...ok? Thanks for telling me after. What's the difference? You're still getting the same amount of patrons. Anyways, I asked what we could do and he said I should, \\"take a taxi.\\" Yes, I would've done that 20 minutes prior had I not been waiting for your Uber ride. This should've been the first sign. I digress. \\n\\nUpon my arrival for our newly adjusted reservation of 8:30, we waited another 10 minutes for some guy to, \\"clear off that table\\" which wasn't the table we were sat at...?\\n\\nFinally we get to our table. Great ambiance. Nice music selection. No waiter. Another 15 minutes later and finally we have a drink and app order in. Lobster wontons were amazing. We had finished our appetizer order, still another wait for service. Finally we place our order for entrees. I'll start with mine: rack of lamb w/ blue cheese. Delicious. Very flavorful. Decent sized portions. \\n\\nMy friend ordered the tuna. She doesn't like sushi - she thought it was cooked. This was a mistake on both parts. I don't think she fully understood, but also the waiter never really mentioned it and the menu didn't lead to it being done rare. So when that dish came out, she definitely wasn't going to eat it. We told the waiter, he said they couldn't do anything. We asked if we could substitute it with something cheaper like chicken. Then he got flustered and brought over a manger (nice guy) who explained to me how the tuna was their \\"prime\\" dish and that they couldn't change anything. The dish had to come like that apparently. He led us to believe that there was nothing he could do till I gave him the look of, \\"were not going to eat it.\\" Then he said he would have to go talk to, \\"Calvin\\" (lol). The same guy came back with the menu and asked what she would like, finally rendering the issue resolved. What if I ordered a bottle of wine, did the taste and didn't want that selection? Would they refuse to give me a different selection? Probably. Anyways, my friend ended up getting something standard - fried chicken which was good.\\n\\nOk let's get to the part that pissed me off the most. He brings the $81 check (tuna was taken off and replaced with chicken), my friend gives me $20 to help pay of the bill. So I put my credit card and the other $20 in the bill holder. He takes the check, runs my card, and comes back with the check that I need to sign and thanks us very much. I open the holder to see my card was charged the $81 - he took the $20 as tip without even asking. Um...people tip after their card has been rung, not before! Horrible training of their servers - give me a break! UGH. Whatever. At this point I just wanted to get the F out of there. \\n\\nOverall, decent (but slightly overpriced, especially for Atlanta) food. But SO many layers and hoops to jump through to make it happen that it's just not worth it.

The only negative about our seats was that we were in between two other tables and could hear everything. No privacy whatsoever. \\nThe biggest disappointment was in the actual food. We ordered the calamari for appetizer - it was the largest portion of calamari I've ever seen... the amount did not make up for the taste- very heavy and greasy. We couldn't finish even half of it. The free bread was probably the best part of our meal- it was scrumptious. The kale salad was mediocre at best. The brisket was okay, but not worth what we paid for it. We much prefer the brisket at Fox Bro's for half the cost. And finally, we were very disappointed in our dessert- the apple crisp.. and that's saying a lot, as it is pretty hard to disappoint us with desserts. \\nThe service was good but very slow.

This is what a small-town restaurant should feel like. Westerville is a cutesy little town and you immediately walk into the side of this alley right off the main street (sure you can go in the front, but the locals go in through the side). You're greeted by 2-3 teenage girls, sit down and look up and you see a portrait of the owner's family. Look around the restaurant, you should be able to see Mom cooking, Dad at the cash register, and the kids serving or cooking. A+ family effort\\n\\n#2. It's a cheesy \\"neighborhood\\" Italian restaurant. Sure, I love good high class, fancy Italian once in a while, but most of the time, I want to go in for good pasta, lasagna, pizza or chicken parm and I don't wan to spend $20 a dish on a Wed night. \\n\\n#3. You're given breadsticks with decadent homemade red sauce. Maybe it's out of a jar, who knows, but man this sure tastes homemade... like Mom was in there at 8am cooking a 50 quart pot of this stuff and letting it reduce all day.\\n\\n#4. We have been a couple of times and tried the \\"usual\\" dishes of chicken parm, lasagna, pizza etc. Then one day a waiter recommended the spaghetti. That's the day my life changed in regards to how spaghetti and meatballs should be made. \\n\\n#5. The spaghetti and meatball(s). Okay, who over the age of 16 goes into a neighborhood Italian restaurant and orders the spaghetti? I believed the waiter and I was met with home-made fresh pasta (not the damn stuff from the box) and the most delectable and tender meatballs I have ever tasted. What stinks is that they only serve one with the basic dish. We have been back probably a dozen or so times and every single time this is what I order, but I add two meatballs. It's enough for dinner and then lunch. \\n\\n#6. Since it's a neighborhood restaurant, my wife and I get out eating like gluttons for maybe $30-40. That price also buys enough food for lunch the next day. Very reasonably priced... not too cheap or not too expensive.\\n\\nNow in fairness, I have been a time or two when something was a little greasy. I also have been once when the parm sandwich was really waaaay over seasoned. This is something to expect in a local mom & pop shop. This certainly won't stop me from giving 5-stars... this rating is for the overall experience... including the fact that it makes me happy to give my hard earned $$ to a family who is working so hard to make a local establishment work as opposed to a national chain.\\n\\nI just wish it wasn't a 20 min drive away or else we'd eat here more often!!"},{"name":"Hair of the Dog Brewery and Tasting Room","address":"61 SE Yamhill St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"I L.O.V.E. the brisket!!!!

There was no wait, sat right down at an open table. Best tip: head to this place on a weekday if you can, because - as the other reviews mention (and the servers confirmed) - waits can be up to 2hrs on a weekend. \\n\\nBut for good reason.\\n\\nIt's the only restaurant in Portland outside of the one at Ikea (that I'm aware of) where you can get Scandinavian food. And the food itself seems pretty authentic - lots of smoked salmon and trout, potato pancakes and crepes - all with polysyllabic, unpronounceable names like aebleskiver and ugnspannkaka  The food is also beautifully plated - simple and clean (much like Ikea furniture), without excess. The eggs are cooked in a square pan, so they come out square-shaped, which scores points in my book.\\n\\nI ordered the Lefse, which is basically a potato crepe with a savory filling that apparently varies on a day to day basis. The morning I went, it was smoked trout, bacon and arugula - all of which were good but the combination was on the overly salty side. Fortunately, the potato crepe itself was relatively bland, which mitigated some of that saltiness. It was served with a salad of arugula, topped with bacon and candied cherries - which I didn't really care for. The combination of the sweet cherries with the bacon and the bitterness of the arugula confused my tastebuds.\\n\\nI wanted to try the aebleskiver (their danish pancakes), but knew I wouldn't be able to eat an entire order. Fortunately, the server pointed out that they also have a half order (not on the menu), which I went with. The aebleskiver are probably better described as spherical crepes. Think doughnut holes, made of a soft crepe batter. The half order order came with four of them, served with lingonberry jam and a really awesome lemon curd on the side. They were unique, interesting, different - though I can't say I was totally blown away. I had one, and it was good - and also good enough.\\n\\nThey serve lunch at this location (and dinner at their North Portland location), with interesting items, including salmon cakes and a club sandwich made with smoked salmon. Naturally, swedish meatballs are also on the menu. \\n\\nI think the experience alone is worth the trip. The place is just (and I use this word rarely, if ever) adorable, and clean, and it does feel like walking into a quaint, family-run cafe in Sweden. And there are enough unique menu items here to keep me coming back."},{"name":"Bouldin Creek Cafe","address":"1900 S 1st St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"If you're a vegan/ vegetarian looking for an amazing breakfast bouldin creek is for sure the place to go!

She returned to the phone line and relayed the word from the cook no they need to be deep fryed or they wont taste right.

Upon arrival we were told it would be a 20-30 minute wait, and told we could wait in the bar area. We decided to sit at the bar and order a drink while we waited. At first the bartenders were nice and attentive but then that shifted as they got busier --my Mom was asked if she wanted another glass of wine but I was not asked about another IPA. We ventured back to the hostess stand because it had been 30 minutes, and when we inquired about the wait time were told they were experiencing delays -- understandable in such a busy place. Upon being seated, our waitress was straight and to the point -- no real interaction or personality. We ordered water while we looked over the menu -- we both ended up ordering lobster entrees. I had to stop another employee to ask for a wine list, and then never was asked by our waitress about an additional beverage with dinner.  Considering the various wait times and slow service I was noticing I am glad I didn't because the wine might have arrived after the meal. We waited about 30 minutes between our soup/salad for our dinner, during which time our waitress barely made an appearance in our section of the restaurant. We finished our meal, and proceeded to wait about 10 minutes for someone to clear our table and no one was filling water glasses. We could hear the people at the booth behind us complain about not receiving their appetizers or their side dishes and the people at the table next to us complain about the slow service -- they arrived before us and their food arrived after ours. At one point during our wait/meal a waitress from another section came over and put her head down on the backside of our booth -- it was awkward and unprofessional. We ordered dessert to split, and ended up with 2 desserts -- we only were charged for 1, our waitress stated if you want to eat the second one (Boston cream pie) you can if not just leave it. The apple cobbler a la mode was delicious, the Boston cream pie not so much.

How often do you experience the opposite where the waiter is rushing you so he can flip the table.   We were in and out in about 1.5 hours and found it to be a normal service pace.   I also got the impression that Merza has seen some of those comments.   When I got my check and saw him at the register on the phone, I just walked up there to pay the check out process was taking too long.   He apologized for the slow process and said he wanted us to enjoy and sample the dessert.

We tried the cheese and shrimp and both were delightful although there is more of the shrimp appetizer (4) than the goat cheese (2).  We tried the Coconut Chicken soup and the Shrimp Yo Yom soups and both were excellent.  The coconut chicken is a slightly creamy soup with a ginger flavor while the Shrimp soup is broth based.  The entrees are about $11-14.  The Crispy beef was outstanding, Airwing chicken with lobster mac & cheese received raves, and chicken stir fry excellent.  All portions were very generous and fantastic!  We all left at least a third on our plates and were too full for dessert - which is a crime because their desserts look amazing!  We'll have to make a special return trip!  Wow! Wow!! Wow this is a great place!!!\\n\\nTIPS:  Dinner is their busiest time so I would make a reservation to assure a table.

I brought my boyfriend here for his birthday. When the GPS brought us to the place we were a little questionable at first. It's hidden. It looks like a place where garages & warehouses are. There were teeny signs telling us that the restaurant was in the plaza and tiny signs directing us to the complimentary valet area. The restaurant didn't have a big sign. I was like \\"are we in the right place\\"? Lol. Because sometimes Siri does make you go the wrong way. But nope! We were in the right spot! The valet guy was friendly and took my car. We walked in and oh the inside was nice! The kitchen is right in the middle of the place behind glass, so you can watch them cook. However, my boyfriend and I had a table by the window/garage door, so we didn't really watch. But we did have the best seats in the house! Our view was gorgeous! We had got there as the sun was setting and saw the view of Atlanta. So pretty. The buss boy told us on warm days they open the garage doors, so it's kind of like you're outside, but not really. Our waitress, Holly was sweet and very attentive. I ordered the calamari which didn't have the marinara sauce like most restaurants do. It had more of a sweet sauce similar to yum yum sauce from hibachi restaurants. After a while it was too sweet for my liking so my boyfriend are the rest. It actually had A LOT of calamari for my appetizer dish. More than most places. My boyfriend ordered the empanadas, which our waitress said was popular. That was way smaller than my calamari dish. However it was delicious! Cooked to perfection with just the right amount of pico de gallo and cheese. For my entree I ordered the chicken. BEST CHICKEN EVER. Not dry, but tender. The sweet brown sauce was DELICIOUS! It came with a side of Mac and cheese, which complimented the chicken well. My boyfriend got the brisket, he was in love with it. Lol. It was very tender and the vegetables on the side were seasoned well also. He got a free birthday dessert -- chocolate ice cream, brownie, and salted caramel with nuts on top.

The only cheeses served were Parmesan and Gruyere (really? When I order something like this I want to be introduced to something new. Parmesan especially seems really inappropriate for a cheese board, neither cheese is French, and they're FAR too similar to pair well), and while I couldn't keep my hands off the Spanish chorizo, the other two meats - Pancetta and another cured ham - tasted so similar as to be nearly indistinguishable. If anyone from Blue Dahlia ever reads this, PLEASE give this item some love. The rest of our food was good but, again, not especially original and not well-executed enough to be worth returning for. The flourless chocolate cake was excellent though."},{"name":"Poor Calvin's","address":"510 Piedmont Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4.5","text":"Visiting Atlanta for my birthday with my sisters and wanted to go to a fun nice place. I did my research online and on Yelp and thought this would be great as the reviews were really good.\\n\\nWith high expectations, I wasnt surprised that the place was crowded, but we had reservations and were seated immediately. The wait staff were all friendly and very good.\\n\\nWe ordered 3 entrees for 4 people and was so happy we did that! The portions are very generous and even with three entrees we couldn't finish our food.\\n\\nThe lobster fried rice was my personal favorite. I can see why it is highly recommended. Yum. The soft shell crab was a piece of art - gorgeous to look at and  so tasty. Lastly we ordered the seafood melange and while very good, it was my least favorite. Personally I think it was a wee bit short on seafood.\\n\\nEven though we were stuffed, our dessert shelf was empty in our stomachs so we ordered the peach cobbler bites with goat cheese served with pecan ice cream. The bites we're great, but thought the goat cheese added nothing to the dish.\\n\\nDefinitely worth going. Expect lots of people and noise. We were unfortunately seated in the front room on a cold evening and felt the chill all night."},{"name":"Dynamic Dish","address":"427 Edgewood Ave SE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Perhaps I came with absurdly high expectations, but I can't deny my disappointment with Dynamic Dish. The food itself was beautiful and sophisticated, and the restaurant was spotless and sleek. Overall, it was the cost for what I got that killed me. \\n\\nI ordered the salad of the day for $13.95. It was grilled oyster mushrooms over arugula and sunflower seeds, and although the portion was adequate, I was still ravenous. Although it was good, I felt that it was missing a pungent cheese and/or fruit. Because I was still pretty hungry, I ended up ordering a small cup of the roasted yellow pepper and celeriac soup, and it was delicious. The cup was very small, about 6 oz., and I was shocked it was $6. And just like that.... I spent over $20 on what I consider a very light lunch! \\n\\nMy mom ordered the sandwich and salad combo for $8.95, and we found this to be a reasonable price. The gruyere and caramelized onion sandwich was good, but my mom pointed out that I also make the same thing at home that tastes just as good, if not better (she didn't just say that because she's my mom!). I think some fresh herbs would have contributed to a more memorable flavor. The side salad was tasty and aesthetically pleasing, as well. The quality of their ingredients is superior to other soup/salad/sandwich places, but not so much that I would choose to go here rather than Souper Jenny (where, for $12, I get a huge bowl of soup, a salad, a roll, a cookie, and a soda).\\n\\nI agree with some of the other reviews - the service is a bit chilly and distant. When I requested my dressing on the side, I got a silent stare that said it all. No comment, no nod, just extended eye contact. My salad did come out with the dressing on the side, but I really wasn't sure if it would or not.\\n\\nAlthough the restaurant is in a pretty bad area, it attracts an upscale lunch crowd. The tables near the window make for interesting people-watching; I saw at least 4 or 5 people breeze by on HoverRounds with bags of trash dragging behind them. There are only about 35 seats in the whole place (and about 4 tables total), so I definitely recommend making reservations for dinner. Parking is scarce, but I found the mother lode of parking spots on the street behind the restaurant that runs parallel to Edgewood (not sure of the name). I probably wouldn't recommend leaving valuables in your car...\\n\\nI really love the concept behind this place, and I'm a huge advocate of fresh, healthy food. Although I'm not vegetarian, I rarely cook meat at home and believe Dynamic Dish does a great job of inventing creative, inspired dishes that would make a carnivore feel that he or she isn't missing out on anything. I hope that other places with a similar idea pop up here in Atlanta, and hopefully competitors would trigger DD to lower their prices!\\n\\nI haven't given up on DD - I will be back, and I do want to try pizza night. I did enjoy the food, but unless I strike it big, I won't be able to afford to make this one of my regular lunch stops."},{"name":"Reale's Italian Cafe","address":"13450 N Hwy 183, Ste 230","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"I came here for takeout the other day.

I was disappointed by the food here, but there's a couple things you can tweak that can make it better\\n\\nThe xlb - they are technically well made, and you nailed the hardest part of a good xlb, the thin skin and appropriate amount of soup.   Unfortunately the soup base kills it.  No flavor.   Super easy thing to fix.  It would be great if you offered a crab and pork version which generally has more flavor.\\n\\nThe beef chow fun.  Usually my favorite comfort food dish.  The version here had some really nice veggies, and you can tell the beef is of better quality then usual.   However the beef lacked flavor. The beef needs more sweetness (I don't mean American Chinese food sweet).

The lot is way too small to accomodate the amount of people in the restaurant, and the sidestreet adjacent to it is crammed with parked cars.\\n\\n- There was a line to order almost out the door, and people take FOREVER to order.

Since there were only two of us, that's what we did. I recommend sitting at the bar for a date- it forces you to sit close to the other person, but not that close because the bar stools aren't placed that close together. \\n\\nService at the bar was really good. 3 people tending were enough to make sure we got everything we needed fast and weren't forgotten about.\\n\\nWe shared a seasonal beer on tap (good, not great), and both ordered custom burgers. I hate the way a burger weighs me down after I eat it, so I opted for a turkey patty which was suprisingly awesome. Probably the most delicious turkey burger I ever had. I decided to be creative with the toppings (Carolina coleslaw and chipotle ranch sauce in addition to the usual lettuce, tomato, onion) and it didn't turn out so well.\\n\\nSweet potato fries were much different than most places'- a little oversalted, and not sweet. I'm pretty meh about them.\\n\\nThe ambience was relaxed, even if it felt slightly awkward. Maybe that's because it was obviously a date spot. Maybe like a second or third date spot. Upside was that they play ridiculous movies on a projector in the back and behind the bar. I thought I was watching a ridiculous, sci-fi inspired kung fu movie from the 70s, but the chimpanzees clued me in that it was one of the installments of the old Planet of the Apes.\\n\\nAll in all, it was a nice meal.

For all you can eat, there is a limit of 1 order of calamari per customer (pretty good, but it was mostly breading).\\n\\nShort story: Food was ok but the service was horrible. They should change the name from Sushi Me to Sushi Meh. You can choose to sit at a booth or counter where the rotating sushi is at.\\n\\nLong story: Our group of 5 was seated immediately by the host as soon as we entered (2 other small groups were there too). They were adamant that people in a group order the same way (either everyone orders all you can eat or pay by plate). But our server was ever so kind as to let that slide. She also reminded us that we had to decide if we were going to participate in the AYCE before placing our order. On the menu it states that you are not allowed to change your mind mid meal (makes sense). Then she left to give us time to decide. A good 5-10 minutes roll by and we are ready to order, but she is chatting with a fellow server all the way in the back of the restaurant and it is impossible to wave her down since she is not even glancing our way. Finally she comes over and takes our order. My boyfriend and I try to make the most of our money and order 6 orders of ikura along with a few other dishes. The sushi chef starts handing out some of our other dishes and then he says \\"sorry, we don't have ikura\\" and when we ask if they are just sold out or if they canceled the item, he says he's not sure. We start to panic because unlimited ikura was the main reason why we chose AYCE! We flagged our waitress and asked her if it was possible to pay for individual dishes instead since they didn't have what we wanted to eat. She hesitated and said that they are not supposed to do that because they could get in trouble. First of all, she didn't let us know that they were out of what we ordered. And secondly, it's not like we wanted to change it just because we felt like it. In the end, she begrudgingly complied with our request. The cashier also charged our friend $2 more because she insisted that he did not give her enough. I have worked retail before and if there is any doubt about the cash, we would balance out the drawer to be sure. But without proof, she stood her ground and my friend was forced to give another $2.

I ordered a side of the Vegan Grits and my wife got an order of chicken sausage. I absolutely loved the pancakes! They were a wonderful consistency, flavorful, and a nice size. The grits were good also as they had just enough flavor as a supplement to the pancakes. Coming from Maryland/DC, we were both thrilled to see the price of our bill.

Well, ok, not entirely true - our reservation was for 9:30pm so we KINDA knew... though didn't anticipate parade traffic and 4 detours later that it would be past 10pm before we would arrive at our booth... and probably another 30 minutes or so before we got down to the business of ordering. It just wasn't first priority! \\n\\nFirst priority was the company sharing our booth... me, the BF, and my lovely Lisa J., who I hadn't seen in damn near 10 yrs. Some things will change... fine lines in the corners of our eyes... spotting a few more grays atop our heads... and an inability to stay up much past midnight without first having a 20-30 minute \\"power nap\\"... some things, however - remain as they were... my sweet, smiling friend and her fantastically infectious giggle... the only laugh I know capable of clearing dark skies inna second. Yep, I mean it. I see the skies part and the sun embrace every time I hear her giggle.\\n\\nSo it was here at Andina that we decided to have our grand reunion! ...which would be, for me, inna word - fantastic. \\n\\n\\nOur server exhibited patience as we tried to play a decade's worth of catch up... Between mere glances at the menu, I think she waited a good 20 minutes or so before we decided on much of anything! The only menu item we were quick with was a pitcher of red sangria! The sangria was delicious... the right amount of sweet and tart and well-balanced fruits... it was absolutely delightful... and at only $19 for a pitcher... really, Andina? I love you so.   \\n\\nAfter looking through the menu, we decided to order tapas style so we could thoroughly enjoy a well-rounded meal of different textures and tastes.  Here is what we ordered -\\n\\nESPARRAGOS PERUANOS... fresh asparagus brushed with olive oil and grilled... the char marks were perfect on the asparagus, though it was a little too heavily salted for my liking. \\n\\nPALTA RELLENA DE CANGREJO Y LANGOSTINOS... avocado stuffed with crab and prawns ... oh GOODNESS! This was an absolute delight... the avocado was fresh... the crab and prawn mixture tasted equally fresh... and the little hardboiled (quail?) egg on the side was yummy! Almost too cute to eat, but I did it. In under 2 seconds. \\n\\nCONCHAS A LA PARILLA... grilled diver scallops with a garlic lime butter sauce and crispy onions. We ordered the medium plate because the small consists of one diver scallop and the medium - two. I enjoyed the scallop but not so much the crispy onions... they were aiight...I'm not as partial to soy sauce, though and definitely tasted that in the flavor of the scallop. \\n\\nMy absolute favorite was the CAUSA - straight from their website: \\"a traditional preparation of freshly mashed potatoes infused with key lime juice and pressed into a cake with assorted fillings\\"; for the filling we chose MIXTA NIKKEI, a spicy tuna and crab salad with a crispy shrimp atop. Oh MAN, it was soooo good... the combination of the mashed potatoes and spicy tuna & crab was delicious!! I would definitely order this again in a second! LARGE plate, please!!! \\n\\nANTICUCHO DE POLLO... For a small plate, these marinated chicken kebobs were plentiful and very juicy...and the salsa they were served with was spicy and sweet... the perfect compliment.\\n\\nCHORIZO... dry cured sausage...  this was my least favorite of the dishes we shared... too greasy... and the taste... well, put it this way... I half expected Randy \\"Macho Man\\" Savage to appear from the other side of our booth and scream \\"SNAP INTO A SLIM JIM!\\" I just didn't dig it. \\n\\nWe finished dinner by sharing dessert -- PLATO DE CREMA QUEMADA!!!... which was three small pots of cr√®me brule with a distinctive Peruvian twist... passion fruit, green tea, and I forget the one in the middle. The green tea was my absolute favorite... the middle one (that I forget) was also yummy. The passion fruit was a little too tart for me... but definitely memorable. \\n\\nAll in all, an amazing dinner... I would DEFINITELY frequent if I lived in Portland... and best of all... because we ordered tapas... dinner was less than $100 and that's including the pitcher of sangria and dessert.

I added some hot sauce, but they didn't really need it. The waitress was very attentive and knowledgable about the dishes. I do wish I'd tried something a little more interesting, but I was in the mood for a great burger and I was not let down. My boyfriend ALSO got a burger, but he had the brunch burger. That one had an egg and bacon on it. He loved it and gobbled it down. My boyfriends father had the dungeness crab melt and he seemed happy with it. My bf's mother had the pulled pork fritatta. It looked delicious, and apparently it was. She was very happy that the waitress had recommended it. My bf's sister had the pork hash, it had a clever name but I cannot remember it. She LOVED it and ate the entire thing. Everyone was a little jealous of her great choice.\\nThe restaurant is laid out a bit confusingly, you have to seemingly walk through the kitchen to get to where we had been seated.

The bar area looks really cool and I'm hoping to look into the possibility of a happy hour.\\nOverall, I would come here again for brunch and possibly happy hour, if they have one, but looking at their regular meal, it's a bit too spendy for a regular dinner day.

I think it's only right that I update my review for Top of the Hub. Since visiting for the first few times years ago, I feel like things have changed (or maybe my palate has just developed more). The food... is pretty good, but it's not great on its own. If you draped curtains over the windows and took away the breathtaking view it would hardly be worth a visit. Without anything else considered, I'd give the food 3 to 3 1/2 stars depending on my mood.\\n\\nAdding the incredible view to the equation definitely helps sway me in the \\"me likey\\" direction. Service is very nice as well. I recently had lunch here with a large party and we were all very pleased with the view and the service. Overall, the guests were happy with their meals, but it just didn't quite live up to my memories and high expectations.\\n\\nAll in all, I still think Top of the Hub is a fine spot to visit, a great place to bring out of town guests, or a date. If you've never been, the view is certainly worth your time. But a better meal overall can be found on solid ground not too far away. I have mixed feelings.

I have a few marked concerns, but all in all - it is one of my faves.  \\nThe lemonade/ sweet tea is NOT fresh.  Whenever you go, there are some little fruit fly bugs all around the place.  NOT a sign of freshness.  When you taste it (yeah, why would you try, but I REALLY don't like to drink soda much), it is bitter and has an acidic taste.  This means that it is BAD...  I worked in fast food back in the day & know that sweet tea made in store has a shelf life of only a few hours.  I've e-mailed corporate about this, but haven't seen much change in this store.\\nThe avocado crab salmon is my FAVE!  I've had a few other things, but I always come back to that.  That said - the amount of crab that they use hardly justifies them mentioning that there is crab in it.  Quite disappointing.\\nThe wheatberry rice is what HOOKED me!  I LOVED it when I first came to the store.  But, they are SO inconsistent with it!  One time I went, they didn't have it.  Its like a signature dish!  They admitted that they didn't have anyone who knew how to make it.  Don't you have SPECS?  Wha...  OK - whatever.  Then, I go back a few weeks later and I guess they forgot they didn't know how to make it and had someone try anyway.  It was a nasty, mushy mess.  My tongue was offended.  I told someone that I wasn't pleased, it wasn't right & she insisted that is what it ALWAYS tasted like.  Honey, I've NEVER seen you in here before, but I know that what I almost considered my fave food tasted like - not this!\\nI am a mushroom lover.  I could eat them for EVERY meal.

The dishes we ordered were creative and palate pleasing. It's southern comfort food with an Asian twist. We had a wonderful experience and even got to meet and have a lovely chat with the creative force, that is Chef Calvin. We promised to return to try the chef's  special dinning experience where Calvin would create one of a kind dishes for you. We have yet to do so...but it's on the list.\\n\\nWe came this time for brunch. And though very busy, Poor Calvin did not disappoint.\\n\\n\\nStarters:\\n\\n--chicken & pork dumpling with ginger soy sauce: I have had my share of dim sum and dumpling but bravo to Chef Calvin for making a simple traditional dish very much his own. It's light, zesty and delicious. The sauce is what did it for me. I can't believe I'm raving about dumpling! I could easily eat 10 serving of this dish. Chef Calvin, you should take on dim sum as your next project. It would be spectacular to see your take and twist on it. \\n\\n--shrimp tom yum soup: yum yum indeed. \\n\\nEntrees:\\n\\n--Fried chicken & sweet potato waffles: Calvin's fried chicken has a kick to it. It's a little spicy enough just to register and resonate, but not so much that you forget the dish and are only able to focus on the fact it is spicy. It's a heavy dish but combined with fresh fruits and a bit of kale, it is balanced.\\n\\n--Egg Benedict with crab cakes, kale mash potatoes and lobster sauce: I've had much better & fresher crab cake. Individually, the eggs & crabs were just ok. The kale mash potatoes stood on its own. However, it was the chunk of lobster and the savory sauce that was able to tie everything together & save this dish for me. My waiter spilled the egg on the table. But he brought me a new egg on a separate plate. I'm not sure if that made a difference on my overall tasting experience of this dish.\\n\\nAmbience: beautiful deco & interior. The windows give the restaurant the illusion there's more space than it has. \\n\\nParking: is limited. They're only about 8-10 spaces so with 30 minutes of the restaurant opening, they are all filled. There's a sign for valet parking on a different street but we couldn't find it. 2 streets over, the area is a bit shady. We circled back and parked on the street right beside the restaurant.\\n\\nService: friendly & attentive overall. \\n\\nHowever, during my spilling egg incident it did disappoint me that my waiter stood frozen in place. It was bound to happen & I find no fault in the egg spilling in itself. The dish is piled on like a tree top house. It is pretty to look at but I imagine it is difficult to carry & walk about. As my waiter brought the dish safe & sound to my table, one unbalanced breath and splash, the egg felt over. He apologized profusely but stood indecisive for a long moment. \\"Should I scoop up the egg and put it back on the plate?\\" 10 seconds rule? He must have thought. To my horror he looks as if he was trying to do just that. Thanks goodness our nice server appeared and quickly instruct him to \\"get the egg off the table into another plate & bring the dish back to the kitchen.\\" My husband offered to take the dish as is, but just please bring a new egg. There was no point in wasting a perfectly good dish overall. The waiter must be new and unsure of what to do. It was just a very long awkward moment watching him make a decision. I thought it should have been a given...don't even have a split second thought about trying to put the egg back on the dish."},{"name":"Top of the Hub","address":"800 Boylston St, Ste 52","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"I think I would have rather paid for the Skywalk than what we got.

The first time I was here on a Saturday night, it wasn't as lively as I expected a restaurant to be on a weekend. There was a decent amount of people but it wasn't packed. On the left side when you enter,  that side is where they play live music, which costs maybe $10/$13? (Don't recall) to seat there. That is where the majority of the customers were but we sat on the other side which is near the bar, and it was pretty empty. The decor is nice and it's overall quite a smallish restaurant with a intimate feeling so more perfect for dates than groups or with a family, even though we saw a table with a child present.\\n\\nAnyway, the male waiter was pretty friendly. We had a grilled chicken kebab with fries and that was pretty tasty, perfect amount of  tangy Middle Eastern seasonings. We had the spinach and cheese phyllo dough thing(forgot the name,lol) and it was just OK; not enough cheese in it so it tasted like spinach but some parts had more cheese,  which is inconsistent. We also had falafel which for me was the winner, it was crispy on the outside and softer on the inside. It tasted like authentic falafel. The tahini sauce that came with it was pretty forgetful though. I had a blue drink and it was delicious, I believe it was the Istanblue. We had baklava for dessert which was 3 small piece but it was good, not the best I had but not too sweet. It could have been a more generous portion. Overall, portions were decent. The first experience overall was good, I would say a \\"B' average.\\n\\nThe second time I went, which was on a  early Friday night and it was pretty empty. Besides us, there were maybe several other guests. My bf and I had a young female server, she was OK but she seemed bored and exuded low energy. However, she didn't bother us too much but she did make sure to fill our drinks regularly. My bf ordered the lamb entree with veggies with rice pilaf and a appetizer of lamb sausage wrapped in grape leaves. I tasted his lamb sausage wrapped with grape leaves and while cooked perfectly and tender, it was very bland. The rice was buttery but no spices or flavors that was reminiscent of Middle Eastern cuisine but tasted like generic American rice. Wait time for food was pretty fast, likely because it wasn't busy.\\n\\nI ordered the steak entree with veggie and fries and falafel as my appetizer. The falafel was  over cooked, thus it made it a bit dry on the inside. The spices/seasonings were also not as strong as the first time I was here. My steak was cooked perfectly, still tender but not rare yet it was bland.  But on one of my steak pieces, I could actually tasted the hot spices. So, very inconsistent in seasoning the meat. The veggies were delicious although they could have used more seasoning. Fries were delicious but  fries are pretty hard to mess up,lol. I also had a pink drink called Taste of Bekka?

The chocolate cake, first bite I didn't like it but then it started tasting decent/kinda good. Both desserts weren't too sweet.\\nI would give this 2nd experience a \\"C\\" but my bf rated the overall experience as a 1/1/2 and he said he wouldn't come back.

Decor is pretty but they need to be consistent with seasoning their foods and quite frankly, they need to start seasoning their foods with authentic spices. Make people feel like they're having the real deal!  Because the food was bland, I felt like I was eating generic American cuisine.\\nSo, for what you are getting, in terms of quality, it is a bit over priced.

I'm no longer standing on my chair screaming, \\"USA! USA!\\" Needless to say, my meal last night at The Optimist left me an enormous pessimist. In fact, it was the worst meal I've ever shelled out one hundred bones for. Putting my credit card down, I felt duped and knew that I could get much better meals in Atlanta for much less money.\\n\\nIf you're reading this review, well then you have certainly heard about The Optimist. You've heard about its gorgeous dining room and inviting bar(s). You've heard about the masterfully appointed lighting and stylishly tasteful touches. And all of these things are absolutely, in the fullest sense, true - the design team for this restaurant knocked it out of the park. And perhaps you've heard about the food. And that's where I'm taking a stand - if you heard wonderful things about the food at The Optimist, you heard wrong.\\n\\nIf I had to sum my meal up at The Optimist in one, brief phrase, if would be, \\"Nothing tasted like anything.\\" The dishes overall were devoid of any flavor with the exception of a salty Monkfish entree. I adore the scope of the menu and had a hard time deciding on anything because everything sounded so interesting, refreshing or delicious. The service, I should mention, was flat - not particularly friendly and nobody ever came to check on us after we got our food. \\n\\nThe Optimist has fresh oysters on the regular and I feel like oysters are omissible from any review. The truth is, if you have a fresh product and a good shucker, oysters are going to be good. And they were. We also ordered the $9 cup of gumbo. With ample amounts of seafood (including a crab claw), I suppose they can get away with the price. The broth was nothing special, however, and lacked thickness and depth of flavor. The accompanying \\"Potluck\\" garlic bread was absolutely unnecessary and didn't even deserve to be called garlic bread.\\n\\nThe mains were the real let down of the evening. My monkfish entree, with a tomato broth, pickled fennel and hen of the woods mushrooms was simply not good. The monkfish was cooked appropriately but the accompanying broth tasting like nothing but salt with no tomato flavor. In fact, after a few bites, I couldn't eat any more of it. The pickled fennel kept to itself and didn't compliment the dish in any way while the the hen of the woods mushrooms were kept to a minimum - there was only one in the dish.\\n\\nKins ordered the yellowtail tuna dish which was supposed to feature a charred octopus & potato salad. The yellowtail was cooked properly with a nice sear to the outside. The potato salad was even interesting - fried rather than boiled (think well cooked home fries). However, the charred octopus was much like the mushrooms in my dish - non existent except for one, measly piece. I'm sorry, but when you shell out $26 for a dish, there needs to be more than one bite of the ingredients mentioned on the menu. And like the monkfish entree, this dish didn't really have any flavor. The corn milk hushpuppies fell into the same category of everything else - no flavor. They were also entirely too dense - hushpuppies from a modest fish shack are worlds better.\\n\\nNothing at the Optimist was revolting or inedible. The problem was that nothing tasted great or even good. While a modest home cook may not be able to prepare a piece of monkfish to perfection, they could surely impart more memorable (or in this case, existing) flavors. The best bite I had all evening was the complimentary bread - fluffy, buttery and topped with some quality salt, it was a nice bite to kick off what I (at the time) suspected would be a great meal. But alas, it was the only bite I fully enjoyed for the rest of the evening. I began wondering if I had burned my tongue severely on the gumbo because after that, I didn't taste much of anything.\\n\\nP.S.

Decor and atmosphere are lovely, but I was a little taken aback when we were seated at the bar for our special occasion (and it was early, so the restaurant was mostly empty for the first half of our dinner). Still, we were in a good mood and didn't take it to heart. Then the server asked: Would you like still or sparkling water? We said sparkling. Then she asked: would you like some bread? Sure! We then received our menus. To make a long story short, we enjoyed our meal (creative food, though somewhat overly seasoned). What we didn't enjoy was getting nickle-and-dimed: our bill arrived with a charge for the water and the bread we were offered before we even received our menu. Don't get me wrong: the bread was delicious, and worth $6; I would have been happy to knowingly order it. But the way we were *offered* the sparkling water and bread was deceptive; it suggested that it was included with the fixed price meal. Otherwise, why not just offer regular water and then give us the menu and let us decide what drinks and appetizers we'd like to order? The whole experience left a bad taste in our mouth. Very un-generous, stingy, and not classy, at what otherwise may have become a favorite spot. Why would we choose to eat at a place that resorts to such tactics to wrangle another $12 from us, when there are so many other high-end restaurants in town that are far more generous?

My beeper went off at exactly 6:30, after 15 minutes of awkwardly standing around an empty restaurant, and my party of 2 was escorted to one of the dozens of empty tables. When we asked the hostess if we would have to wait if we did not have a reservation, she said it would be \\"a few minutes\\" wait. WTF?!?! Kind of douchy.\\n\\nThe rest of the meal continued to go south. We started off with the calamari, which was very crunchy and flavorful. The empanada was excellent as well. The kale salad was OK, but the kale was quite tough. If I am eating raw kale, I prefer it to be \\"massaged\\" before eating. \\"Massaging\\" the kale for a few minutes turns the kale silky and sweet. The kale in the salad was very bitter and hard to chew.\\n\\nMy husband got the burger and was very disappointed. He took a few bites and declared it flavorless. I took a small bite and agreed. I'm not even comparing it to the Holeman and Finch burger or the Bocado burger, I am comparing it to the burger at my local sports bar, and it was not good. I got the Shellfish Wood Roast. It was a disappointment as well. The shrimp was cooked well, but there were only 2 tiny mussels, so I barely got a taste and the lobster meat was very soft and kind of disintegrated upon touch. The sauce was quite good, but for $40 I expect more seafood and a better quality of seafood.\\n\\nEven dessert was not good. We shared the bananas foster sundae.

I asked our waitress if we could move to one of those and she came back with the response \\"we can't guarantee anything because of graduation season.\\" I was annoyed, like what is that even supposed to mean?? Let me sit at one of those tables like I requested two weeks ago! Oh well, I didn't bother arguing as I didn't want to ruin the night.\\n\\n I ordered the salmon which was to come with gold potatoes and roasted beets, it arrived and there was one single tiny beet. Salmon was pretty tasteless. My husband ordered the veal, he said it was nothing special but the side of whipped potatoes were delicious. We ordered the chocolate almond cake for 2 for dessert. It was presented beautifully with fresh berries, and one scoop of coconut ice cream. Sadly, the cake was very dry and not very good, the best part was the one scoop of coconut ice cream we shared and the strawberries, and blueberries. The service was Ok, the waitress was nice but nothing spectacular. The best part of the whole experience was the bottle of champagne I ordered. Our bill came to $165 and we were satisfied but not very impressed. We were dressed up and expecting a swanky environment, the decor is very outdated. The light fixtures are like giant lamp shades, not attractive at all. \\n\\nMy advice to anyone looking to visit would be do not waste your money on dinner!! The bar lounge area looked very nice and had a nice atmosphere. There was a live jazz band playing, which sounded great, we could not hear or see them at all from our dinner table. So go visit the bar, order a few cocktails or a flat bread for the $25 minimum spend where you can enjoy the spectacular views, and sit on the nice couch style lounge chairs next to the windows or on the high tops around the bar.

Flavours were delicious but just plain came on too strong like a date that goes on an hour past its peak.\\n\\nNow don't let me spoil this for you - the atmosphere is cozy not crowded, romantic not flowery, and full of warmth and glow with its small gas fireplaces dotted here and there.  One gets the sense that, if Calvin is a real person, he truly did carry out this gastronomic dream on a budget and well done, Sir. The atmosphere married sophistication and eclecticism, mirroring the fusion style of the food.\\n\\n*spoiler alert* For starters, you're presented with what the chef calls a first bite, I believe.  Two small fried balls appeared on our table after we ordered.  These tantalizing tastes were made with a sweet squash (delicata?) that was blended, coated and fried, drizzled with house made honey mustard and absolutely melted in our mouths.\\n\\nThe ginger veggie wraps were up next and we each had enough for 2 large sushi style bites.  Crunchy, light, bursting with veggies and topped with more delicious sweet mustard and hot sauce, these disappeared in a flash.\\n\\nThe entrees we requested were made vegan style for us and both revolved around tofu and veggies - one was the Pad Thai sans egg and the other, the Green Curry sans fish sauce.  Again, these two dishes were delightful for the first 1/3 of the experience but frankly even an extremely creamy, rich flavored curry like that needs something to cut it - maybe I was missing the fish sauce. \\n\\nNo drinks for us but we overheard our neighbors happily sipping chichi cocktails and wowing over their beautifully presented dinners - something served in a pineapple boat!!!  If I ever go back to Atlanta, I'll have to try one of their incredible desserts but we passed this night.\\n\\nFinally, our server, Blane, was knowledgeable, professional, personable, helpful and communicative.  Thanks, all for a wonderful anniversary dinner!"},{"name":"Anchovies","address":"433 Columbus Ave","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"Came back for more stuffed peppers, fries, sandwiches, drinks, etc. with a pretty rowdy crowd, but Terry was a total doll.

He not only put up with my ridiculous bunch of friends, but he was fierce with the bread, giving us rounds upon rounds, which was greatly appreciated after a few too many drinks for some of us.\\n\\nAs always the food was great, the atmosphere was dive-y and the bill was cheap, but Terry really made our night.

I was a sucker for the Maple Bacon Bar hype.  Shit, I don't even LIKE maple bars, but the bacon made me want to try.\\n\\nSo, on an overnight visit we wandered past about midnight on a Saturday.  Holy bejeezus!  The line was a block long and not moving.  We went into Dante's intead.\\n\\nNext morning I told my man we had to try again.  The line didn't look so bad.  He waited in the car while I joined the queue.  Holy bejeezus! The line is STILL not moving.  Seriously, I thought it would be 15, maybe 20 minutes max.  Nope. 1 hour, folks.  1 hour.  AND on top of that, once I got into the rabbit hole-sized store I noticed it was CASH ONLY.  Thank GOD I got that $20 out to play video poker the night before.  AND, if I hadn't had cash, I couldn't call my man waiting in the nice warm car because my phone died a half hour earlier!!  ON TOP OF ALL THIS the gal at the counter announces -- 3 people ahead of me -- that THEY ARE OUT OF MAPLE BACON BARS.  o.m.g. It's the only reason I came here.  But I wasn't about to have wasted an hour.\\n\\nEven though there's something like 60 different donuts to choose from, I had NO idea what any of them were besides the aforementioned Bacon Maple Bar.  They all had crazy imaginative names, but no description anywhere of what they were made of.  Sure, there was a rotating case of the selections, but no signs on the rotating sweet doughs to let me know what I was looking at.  Grrr.  Lest I hold up the already anxious line, I decided to just start throwing out donut names to the oh-so-helpful-and-happy-to-be-of-service gal (not).  I ended up with an Old Dirty Bastard, Captain My Captain, and Grape Ape. Finally. Donuts were in hand and a cheer erupted from the line as I exited the rabbit hole.\\n\\nI gotta say though. The donuts were pretty tasty. Nice doughy chew. Sweet, but come on, it's a cake covered in stuff like Oreos, Cap'n Crunch, Peanut Butter, and grape sugar. Expect sweet, people!\\n\\nBottom line. I'd never wait in line for an hour ever again. Ever. If anything I'd go check out the other location and hope it's run a bit more efficient.
