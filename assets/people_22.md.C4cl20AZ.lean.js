Thats where Johnny swooped in with the, \\"Let me surprise you.\\" He came back with our foie gras, prosciutto masterpiece but embellished the already ideal plate with a 3 year gouda, soft goat's milk cheese, and some lightly brined mushrooms.

The food I had--a red curry with chicken and also the starter of tulip dumplings--was ok, but no better really than several other Floridian Thai restaurants (Tim's Thai in Gainesville or Ruby Orchid in Ocala or even tiny Thai Phoon in Crystal River). The tulip dumplings--which contain no flowers but instead a mince of I think chicken and maybe pork--are steamed but despite this, are very heavy in texture and lacking in flavor. They were simply too large, too heavy, and no clear flavor came through. The dipping sauce served with them was very thick and tasted more like a Hawai'ian glaze for pork than a soy-based dipping sauce appropriate for dumplings. \\n\\nThe red curry was better, I will say, but the chicken in it was very thin strips and not very good. It had an odd texture and seemed as if they'd nearly made an effort to use as little chicken as possible and slice it thin to make it appear to go further. You don't expect that from the supposed \\"best\\" Thai restaurant in all of Orlando. The service was very, very, prompt and attentive: I will say that. Our check came when requested, our iced teas were never left empty or lacking, and when I asked for a spice tray for the red curries, one appears within mere minutes. However, this cannot make up for the food: perhaps I was biased based on the rave reviews on Yelp and elsewhere and what Orlando friends have said, but I felt Sea Thai would be a bit better. I was expecting something like Basil in Charleston, South Carolina and maybe their other dishes rock, but our red curries--not a complicated dish at all for a Thai place--were only OK, not stellar."},{"name":"Rocco's Tacos & Tequila Bar","address":"7468 W Sand Lake Rd","city":"Orlando","stars":"3.5","text":"Delicious food and great margaritas!

The restaurant seemed to be amply staffed and there was little to no wait for bread, drink refills, etc. \\n\\nThe bread at the restaurant seems like an afterthought. It did not seem fresh and was not warm. It was served with a tasty white bean puree but when we asked for olive oil they served us what looked like commercial cooking oil (certainly not bread quality oil). \\n\\nFor appetizers we ordered an eggplant dish and Arancini. Both were very good. Both were served with an incredible red sauce which I would say was the highlight of our meal. Portions were large. \\n\\nFor dinner we had chicken parm, risotto and gnocchi. The chicken parm was good because it was slathered with the aforementioned delicious red sauce but both the risotto and gnocchi left much to be desired. My impression is that this place does the classics and pizza well. \\n\\nOverall, I think better options can be had in the Northend. But at minimum, this place could improve its reception by improving the atmosphere and comfort of its guests."},{"name":"The Salty Pig","address":"130 Dartmouth St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"This place reminds me of old timey restaurants and butcher shops with all of their selection and choices of meats.

Me and my friend are both Indian - so we know the difference between mild, medium and spicy - so this is ridiculous!\\n\\nSo, since  that was last year, the other night I decided to give it another shot. As I live close by - I called and ordered mild food, and said I would pick it up, and when I called she said it would be ready in 20 minutes.  Ok, so no big deal.   I called again, because I realized that they deliver, so I asked if it could be delivered by any chance... this lady could not explain very well - she kept saying \\"they\\" only deliver over a certain amount.  So I asked her what that amount was, but she said I don't know and \\"they\\" were the ones who set it.. .but yet she could not say who \\"they\\" was -- even after I asked her a few times to clarify!  \\n\\nI walked down to get my food, and once inside I picked up one of their brochures.  Not only does it not mention it on their website, but also not on the brochure that there is a certain amount you need to order for delivery.   I mentioned this to the lady at the counter, and also asked her (again) is it not them (the restaurant) the delivers or is it an outside company? IT's not a rocket scientist question!   She finally said it's an outside company -- to which I told her, then maybe you should list it on both your website and brochure.  I don't think she will to be honest.\\n\\nAnyways, got home to try the food -- again, do they know what mild means??  There was no flavour to the masala dosa.  It was just red chilli  -- that is not flavour/spice, that's heat!!

I was sitting there the other day, took a good look around and I think I heard at least 10 different languages being spoken. It is also a study hot spot. UT students are sprawled across the massive outdoor deck and indoor seating area. They are always roasting their coffee, so the aroma of fresh beans is present. This is the closest you're going to get to the water in any coffee shop in town. They have a large deck that is perfect for sunny days.\\n\\nGreat Drinks: There standard cup of coffee is free refillable, as well as their ice coffee. There are usually a few coffees to choose from, so get a cup and try them all.  Their cappuccino is fantastic and if you're looking for something cold get it iced, an option not commonly found at coffee shops in town. Their chai is perfect for a frigid night beneath their holiday lights.\\n\\nIt is definitely a scene when the weather is fit to be outside.

These are the main highlights of the encounter:\\n\\nPro's\\n1. The ambiance was incredibly pleasant and relaxing. Even for a Friday night happy hour, I felt that Saba was conducive to conversation and overall merriment.\\n2. The drinks were very good. I had a classic Mojito and modern mojito. The classic mojito had a very even sweetness, reminiscent of honey, and a slightly darker flavor with less crispness. It was a great drink (the classic uses an Anejo rum vs. regular bacardi). Likewise, the regular Mojito was perfectly sweet with a hint of tartness from the lime. This mojito had a natural sweetness without any harshness (like some Mojitos made with simple syrup). It was clean, balanced, and really distinct.\\n3. Shrimp chips. They serve these similar to how Mexican restaurants serve tortilla chips. They weren't great, but they were novel enough, with a nice peppery element, to be enjoyable.\\n4. Food\\nA- Panko crusted Goat Cheese (didn't see this on the menu as of tonight). The goat cheese was incredibly fresh and vibrant. I loved the panko bread crumbs on the outside. They were perfectly fried and crispy. Additionally, there was some type of reduction (possibly balsamic) which added a nicely balanced sweet/tartness. It worked really well in context, and I also  enjoyed the texture of the caramelized pears(?). The caramelized vegetables and fruit added a nice syrupy warmth to the goat cheese.\\n\\nB-Shrimp Skewers- They were good, but a tad over-fried. No real highlighted herbs or seasoning, but the shrimp was tender and nicely crispy. It wasn't complicated, so the execution was pretty good.\\n\\nCon's\\n\\n1. The waiter had a better place to be apparently. He was incredibly short and arrogant in his responses to regular diner questions like: 'which drink do you like\\"?, \\"can we order drinks\\"?. His responses varied, but overall, it appeared as if it was his \\"time of the month\\"\\n\\n2.The food\\nA- Lobster with Brie Empanadas- Lobster is rarely paired with cheese for this reason. The empanada was nicely cooked- had a nice softness and texture. However, the lobster and brie mixture was a disaster. It was extremely awkward, the two did not remotely marry flavors and ended up being a huge distracting. Both elements were cooked well, but did not compliment each other whatsoever. It's fundamentally a bad concept. Not to mention, the tomatillo sauce didn't enhance the richness/butteriness of the Brie and Lobster, it just distracted with its acidity.\\n\\nB-Spinach Queso- First, the chips were so stale they could have been wheat thins. The queso had potential to outshine the stale chips. But in this case, the queso tasted flat as well. The mix of cheese was appropriate and even the spinach worked in context, but overall, the dish had no punch. The cheeses weren't sharp enough to cut through the spinach, so we were left with a overwhelmingly bland cheese dip.\\n\\nC-Spring Rolls- Bland again. They were nicely fried and had a great crunchiness. However, no spice elements were present, it was more a taste of unseasoned vegetables than anything else-like a salad deep fried in a wrapper. I understand that the \\"Sauce\\" was the solution to this matter. Some could say, \\"just dip it, then you'll get your flavor\\". This would be correct if the sauce itself wasn't completely inappropriate for the spring rolls. The sauce was a great blend of slightly tart plum and horseradish, but again, this didn't work with the dish. It would be better suited for the pork dumplings(which I didn't try).\\n\\nSaba is a great value for the downtown Happy Hour crowd. I think the place is nicely decorated and the clientele is very diverse. That being said, the drinks are a great price and will make you increasingly \\"fuzzy\\" as the night progresses. Ultimately, my main contention lies exclusively with the quality of the food. On paper, these dishes seem like quintessential fusion pieces, but the Empanadas are too esoteric with their odd concoction of flavors. Further, stale chips are an indication of lacking attention to detail. I think that theme is underlying in each dish. If they had punched these dishes up with a few more salty/savory combinations, I'm sure the review would have better. Overall, the bad very much outweighed the good."},{"name":"Giacomo's Ristorante - Boston","address":"355 Hanover St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"5 stars. \\n\\nI have been here a countless amount of times and it NEVER disappoints.

I can't speak to the food, only to the lack of service."},{"name":"Craigie On Main","address":"853 Main St","city":"Cambridge","stars":"4","text":"It took me 4 years to get here and I was expecting to lament that I had missed out on 4 amazing years of dining experience.  Instead, I'm not lamenting.  All the dishes were well executed - a little on the salty side but overall, well balanced.  However, there wasn't a single dish with unexpected flavour combinations that vaulted my palate into another universe.  The meal crescendoed at the beginning with each course better than the last and then things slowly petered out with dessert completely falling flat.  I left thinking that this won't end up being a memorable experience.\\n\\nATMOSPHERE - The decor is really consistent with a bistro, which is discordant with the level of cuisine they are trying to achieve.  I really enjoyed the homey atmosphere with the open view of the kitchen.  However, after 3 hours of sitting on a hard wooden chair, I was wishing I was at L'Espalier.\\n\\nSERVICE - I thought service was extremely slow.  There was a significant lag time between dishes with our entire dining experience being 3.5 hours for 10 courses.  \\n\\nFOOD - They served Iggy bread, which is definitely one of my preferred bakeries.  It made me a little sad that they didn't bake their own bread but I wont knock off points for that....better to buy bread than bake crappy bread.\\n\\nThree Chilled Seafood Preparations (tempura-fried cod cheek with squid ink, squid noodles with nuoc cham, house-cured trout) - Meh.  Nothing on this dish tasted great.  The nuoc cham is meant to be a dipping sauce so when you douse the squid noodles in it, it's extremely salty.  The cod cheek was well fried but uninteresting.\\n\\nSalad of Scallop Sashimi (green tomato-red onion, melons (watermelon, cantaloupe, and honey dew) and lemon-caper vinaigrette) - This was a lovely dish.  I think they slightly overdid the citrus but the scallops were sweet and well complemented the melon.\\n\\nMiso and Marinated Australian Cobia (Wellfleet and razor clams, roasted cherry tomatoes, pistou-dashi broth) - This was the highlight of the evening.  The flavours were delicate and the fish perfectly cooked.\\n\\nRed Snapper Collar - This was initially introduced as Hirmasa collar but I know my fish and this was no Hirmasa.  After some further inquiry, it was red snapper.  It was smothered in this sauce that was really reminiscent of Szechuan cooking except without the spiciness.  Overall, the sauce was heavy handed and overwhelmed the delicate fish flavour.  I could have done without this course.\\n\\nSheep's milk cheese and squash Tortellini (broccoli pur√©e, purslane, squash blossoms) - I could have done without this dish as well.  The puree inside the tortellini was so mashed up that it completely lacked texture and discernible flavours.\\n\\nGrilled Vermont Organic Pork Belly (crab, mustard greens, smoked cinnamon, hominy) - The pork belly was well cooked but uninteresting.\\n\\nElysian Fields Lamb Chop with Roasted Sweetbreads (farro verde, summer vegetables, kohlrabi pur√©e) - The lamb was again well cooked but uninteresting.  It was just a lamb chop on a plate.  The sweet breads were fried and extremely grease laden.\\n\\nHouse-Made Sorbets - There were 3 of us and we each got a different flavour - yogurt, blackberry, and plum.  The plum was delicious.  I would have called this an amuse bouche but it was hardly a course.\\n\\nCreamy Anson Mills Corn Grits (demerara brul√®e, lemon-thyme ice cream, warm blackberry compote) - I don't know what to say about this course.  Grits as dessert turns out not to be a winner.  It wasn't horrible, it just wasn't a dessert.  The other two people in our party got a sheep's milk cheesecake and a panna cotta with banana cream.  \\n\\nRhubarb-Hibiscus Mousse (buttermilk foam) - Two problems with this.  1) It just didn't taste good at all (bordering on yuck) and 2) It's in a tiny shot glass and hardly constitutes as a course.  I felt cheated.\\n\\nI'll be back only because the \\"Milk Fed Pig's Head for Two\\" has caught my attention.  However, they seriously need to find themselves a new dessert chef.  In general, I like savoury courses over the sweet ones but dessert is not a course to be disregarded.

Service shouldn't be based on looking a certain way or the color of your skin.

Being that I'm a most excellent vegan gal, I agreed to this undertaking as I'm well aware of The Salt Lick's BBQ fame and I'm not one to deprive others of their tasty tasty murder. \\n\\nWe arrived shortly after noon and I braced myself for an hour or so wait (based on the nearly full massive parking lot and previous reviews), but the hostess assured us it would be more like thirty minutes.  Thus we shuffled on over to the credit card accepted (the only place credit card is accept here, there's an ATM for everything else should you arrive cash-less) bar and ordered a mixed six pack and a Sauvignon Blanc.  Salt Lick is indeed BYOB, although the establishment offered alcohol is quite reasonably price.  I kind of wish I had tried Salt Lick's own line of wines, presumably rendered from the grapevines on the sprawling Salt Lick campus.  I was barely halfway through my first wine glass when our buzzer started flashing and vibrating non-stop. \\n\\nThe picnic table styling seating lent itself well in this particular situation as we weren't so dismally close enough to other diners to encroach their personal space and conversations.  The meaty plates were ordered and arrived rather quickly in spite of the non-stop ingress of hungry patrons.  The omnivores all enjoyed their selections, although my fiance did express regret about opting for the chicken (he did also order a some ribs) over other things once he was able to sample a little of everything.   The only hiccup was that the server informed me that the potato salad had no animal products or byproducts, I went ahead and ordered it (evidently other people get weirded out when you just sit there, drinking, watching them eat) and ate pretty much all of it, in anticipation of an afternoon of day drinking.  Turns out, it's not vegan - there's worcestershire sauce in the BBQ sauce that's mixed into the potatoes.  Typical first world vegan problems, nobody gets me man!  \\n\\nI would probably recommend this place to omnivores on the hunt for tasty BBQ but as you would expect, it's wouldn't be my personal first choice, although I did very much appreciate the reasonably priced decent wine."},{"name":"Theo's Pizzeria Grill","address":"1157 Broadway","city":"Somerville","stars":"3","text":"After calling a close by competitor and being left unable to place an order, I found Theo's.

I had come here a few times during college, and loved the bookstore, but was decidedly underwhelmed by the food. Yes, you heard that right. Trident is a funky little bookstore on Newbury Street that also plays host to a full service restaurant that has breakfast, lunch, and dinner all day long. It is a multilevel space, with books crammed in every nook and people crowded to wait in line for food. I always found the food kind of mediocre, even though I was tickled by the notion of eating breakfast for dinner while reading a book at the same time (it doesn't take much to make me happy, haha!) So, you're probably wondering why I chose this place for our two month anniversary dinner, especially because of previously lukewarm dining experiences.\\n\\nI wanted to give Trident another shot before I wrote it off for good. Granted, many times I had eaten their food, it was via delivery, and as we all know, sometimes delivery food gets \\"lost in translation\\" (soggy chips, cold food, etc). After being seated on the upper level, we were given menus, which I realized had been radically updated and expanded since my last visit. Already a good sign. After scanning the newly massive selection, I settled on a brand new item - a smoked salmon and egg scramble with fresh chives and toast. Samuel got the Chamato Sandwich - more on that later. We also split an order of the sweet potato fries. I was highly impressed with the quality of the food, and so was Samuel. His Chamato Sandwich featured crispy fried chicken, tomato, and a tasty garlic aioli, all piled onto soft and flavorful rosemary foccaccia bread. I had a bite or two! My smoked salmon scramble was simple yet delicious, and the perfect warmup on an early winter evening. The real star of the show were the sweet potato fries, though! Tender and crisp, they melted in the mouth, especially coated in the homemade garlic aioli mayonnaise. Oh my GOD you must order this on the side - I don't care what you get! Yum! Samuel celebrated with a cranberry orange mimosa, and I had a sip. Delicious!\\n\\nAs some other reviews said, service is a mixed bag. Our waitress was initially attentive, but it was hard to get her attention to get the check at the end of the meal. The people that work here are generally friendly, and I didn't find any part of the experience to be unpleasant. It's a busy place, I get it. They have trivia night here and many other events, so be sure to check the website or social media before you go to see if you'll be visiting during any of those! We will come back next time for trivia. \\n\\nThe highlight of the night actually wasn't the meal, even though it was great. Trident had a \\"Pay What You Can\\" Mystery Book sale going on downstairs, where you pick a book that is wrapped in brown paper, with only a brief description written on it. You can pay anything from spare change up, and take home a used book to read. That's exactly how we ended up with a copy of War and Peace.

As far as the latter two on that list goes, Draft Pick left quite a lot to be desired. This was my first time in and I was positively craving a Bacon Cheeseburger, so thought I'd try it out. First though I ended up seating myself, because there was no one at the host stand and after waiting and making eye contact with the bartender (who didn't offer to seat me) I sat at the bar. This is a low traffic time in the restaurant business, 2pm so I understand that things aren't too busy and it's easy to get distracted by other things, like gossip. The bartender and one other server were commenting about another employee smoking a crack pipe, then proceeded to use language that is unbecoming to someone working in a bar such as this. A dive bar, sure, but not in a place like this. Don't get me wrong either, I've got a mouth like a sailor, but I know when it's appropriate and when not. Getting beyond all of this, I ordered a bacon cheeseburger that I'd so desperately been craving, and after waiting with bated breath for this heavenly patty, I was greeted instead with what I can only describe as a sonic knock off. It was very sad especially for an $8.00 burger- oh and the bacon was never wrung in so that wasn't even on the burger. The party was thin and obviously frozen- I was expecting a hand crafted burger on a delicious bun, not a smashed burger bun you can buy at HEB. Needless to say I am truly disappointed because I was really hoping to find a new hangout place for my friends and I to watch games, but after this meal, I doubt I'll be returning."},{"name":"Atlanta Breakfast Club","address":"249 Ivan Allen Jr Blvd","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4.5","text":"Went here for a friends birthday,  it was only three of us.

Salty, a little sweet, kicked up with the added chili sauces on the table, and a beautiful yolky fried egg brought everything together in a can't-stop-won't-stop-delicious dish.

My only issue is how slow the service can be. I understand this type of food takes time, but twice the wait staff haven't given proper updates or have seemed quite confused.

The braso was light and perfect to cleanse the palate. I knocked off a star because I felt a bit rushed with our first server who was ending his shift.

Let's start with the good:\\n\\nConceptually, it's a cool/artsy restaurant compared to the other locales in Back Bay. It's also massive, has two floors, plenty of outlets for laptop users, and a decent book collection. The service is fantastic, the people working at the counters are always a delight to talk to, and the fresh juices are amazing. I always mix and match my own combo of fruits and veggies, and the servers have never been less than accommodating to my changes. \\n\\nNow on to the food. It's not as though the food here is bad. They have a vast menu with varying choices, good quality ingredients, and their servings are pretty big, too. But somehow, their food always leaves something to be desired. I have tried a lot of stuff here: \\nThe grilled cheese on challa with avocado- great sandwich, hugely portioned, yet bland.\\nBreakfast burrito- same as above\\nBreakfast skillet- My favorite breakfast item. It is less bland than the other two, but still under-seasoned. \\nFrench onion soup- Perfect, in my opinion. It's really, really good.\\nHot mango tea- Very soothing, and served in adorable cast-iron pots.\\nCoffee here is always fresh, too. \\n\\nI guess one could say that if I find the food bland, I can just add salt. But sometimes, salt doesn't quite do the trick, and the food actually needs to be well-seasoned for the ingredients to stand out. \\n\\n\\nAs a side note: I have noticed that the downstairs bar-seating is kept cleaner than the upstairs bar seating. I sometimes like to spend weekend afternoons blogging upstairs, where it is typically a bit quieter. The bar is sometimes a little messy and cluttered, which makes no sense if the room is virtually empty and the staff is standing around/looking for things to do. \\n\\nAll in all, Trident will not disappoint you, but the food isn't life-altering, either. It's a good place to spend the afternoon reading and sipping on some fresh juice (carrot, ginger, OJ is my favorite!)."},{"name":"Revelry","address":"210 SE Mlk Blvd","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Heeelllooooo!!!!

The sweet tea and their lemon gingerade drink is really good also, love that they come in mason jars.\\nThe third time was more recent, and my husband and I went for brunch. I ordered an appetizer, which was the fried pickles with homemade pimento cheese. Not impressed. Was expecting thick slices of pickle and what I got was super-thin slices of pickle that I could barely taste. My brunch item made up for the disappointing app thank goodness. I got the porter breakfast, which I believe came with bacon, sausage patties, cheese grits, eggs, and a biscuit. Way too much to eat, but so satisfying. The grits and eggs were perfect, the bacon amazing, biscuit was good too, the sausage patties I found a bit dry, but the seasoning was there. \\nMy husband loves the beer selection and always has to try a new one every time.

The last time I went (6 months to a year ago), the waitress didn't know what a \\"flight\\" was and said she just learned the night before and they no longer do that (a wine shop that doesn't do flights...ok).  Over the years watching them move from one location to the other, with now a patio, this place should be a gold mine. But every local friend I have had gradually dismissed the place. Food is decent. Staff not so much. Philosophy as a local business is questionable at best. During the local Blues/Rib fest, they pulled all of their furniture off of the patio and put it inside so people wouldn't sit down. Meanwhile had about 5 people inside at the bar and packed around by the furniture. Here's an idea, sit people on the patio and serve them food and wine while listing to Blues and make some money over two days & provide a great environment for people to visit, relax and enjoy our small town. Or you can pile all of your furniture inside so no one can be inside or out. A great organization should start by being a good citizen to its community and provide great service. Not happening here. I'm out. \\n\\nUpdate:\\nI had heard this place was under new ownership so I tried it again. Same grumpy lady behind the bar, same incompetent quirky wait staff, still no flights of wine, still don't have a grasp on what it means to be a good citizen to our community.  Sit on the patio and eat at metal tables with no cover (so food and liquids drop on your pants), paper menus with water stains; however, want top dollar for meal.  Give me a top dollar experience and I'll pay top dollar for a meal.  So very disappointing as a local resident looking for fine dining options in town.  Tried again and disappointed again.

There is inside and outside seating. Inside seating is typically by reservation. Outside seating on both sides of the restaurant have full bars with beer on tap. One side of the restaurant has live music much of the time and is accessible to walk-ins, but be prepared for a wait. Outside seating on the other side of the restaurant is first-come-first-serve with no live music, but a fast-food-style restaurant , Cookes of Dublin, with much better food (except for the desserts) at a much lower price than Raglan Road. If all you want is good food and beer, then sit next to Cookes.\\n\\nThe live entertainment is almost always fabulous. The Irish dancers are great! Musical artists switch out every couple of hours, so you won't hear the same music twice (at least not on the same day).\\n\\nThere are several full bars inside and out, so it is typically easy to grab a pint, or a shot, or whatever adult beverage suits your fancy. The food in the main restaurant is good, but could be better, and it is rather more like gourmet American with an Irish twist than anything else. I love seafood and wholeheartedly recommend \\"It's Not Bleedin' Chowder!\\" It is my favorite entree. The desserts are some of the best I've ever tried anywhere. You almost can't go wrong. My friends and family fight over \\"Ger's Bread & Butter Pudding\\" and \\"Chocolate Heaven.\\" My personal favorite is \\"Dundon's Delight,\\" which is raspberry pavlova with vanilla ice cream and raspberry coulis. It is also the main reason why I keep coming back. \\n\\nThe service is sometimes hit-or-miss (more often miss) unless you're at the bar where service tends to be better. (That's why I rate Raglan Road four stars.) No children allowed at the bar, of course, but it is otherwise pretty family-friendly. The inside entertainers often get children to participate in Irish dancing, especially during the daytime and early evening.\\n\\nBathrooms are ample and always clean and well-supplied. And, we almost always stop by the gift shop. Outside smoking policies change from time to time, so if tobacco is your thing, don't assume. Ask what the policy is in advance to avoid being told to douse your cigar, cigarette, pipe, etc. parking at Disney Springs can be a challenge, so plan to arrive early to keep your reservations.\\n\\nBottom line: Whether you stop in day or night, you're almost guaranteed a fun time whether with family or friends.

They do have a nice combo option that you can get w/ a drink - would recommend checking it out.\\n\\nI wanted to try one of their tater tot options so the worker suggested I try the truffle tofu bacon tater tots. I hated them - Thats just personal preference though. I did not like the flavor at all and the tofu bacon creeped me out a bit. I will not be ordering that again. I do want to try one of their dessert bao options though! They intrigue me.\\n\\nKing Bao is in such an interesting and bustling area.

The staff were pleasant and helpful and most importantly, the food was delicious. I had the filet mignon brochettes, which were perfectly cooked and served with marinated veggies that were drizzled with a spiced mustard sauce.

Daedalus was one of those places. The food isn't fancy, and it isn't pretentious. That's what I liked about it. Yes, you did read the past tense correctly, and for very good reasons.\\n\\nNow I need to preface this by saying that it's been a while since I was here. Perhaps a year or more, but I just always thought Daedalus was always going to remain true and not be one of those restaurants that try to \\"reinvent\\" themselves. This reinvention failed miserably in my opinion.\\n\\nI knew something was askew when I walked into the restaurant and was greeted not with the smell of steaks, or burgers grilling, oh, no. It was garlic. The entire restaurant reeked of it. I probably would have walked out and gone elsewhere, but I was there to meet friends, so I lingered at the bar and waited with a very strong cocktail.\\n\\nI ordered the Chicken Kabobs with vegetables and couscous. Of course, if I would have been blindfolded I would never have known what I was eating as everything tasted like garlic. There was no discernable difference in the taste between the chicken, the green pepper, or the onion. I'm sorry, I may be unique here, but I like to taste the various flavors of my food; the sweetness of the peppers, the smokiness of the grilled onion, and yes the flavor of the chicken - shocking I know.\\n\\nThe risotto was just as bad as the kabobs. Yes, I know risotto has garlic in it, and I'm totally fine to use garlic as a subtle flavor in the background. Again it's about the balance of flavors. But there just isn't any balance in anything. It's all one note, garlic.\\n\\nI have always been a firm believer that the only reason to douse your food with garlic is to cover up the fact that you are not serving fresh, flavorful food. Why else would you want to disguise the subtle nuances of food? It's the blending of flavors that make good cooking, truly good cooking. And here is where Daedalus fails. There is no point for me to go and pay twenty dollars for a meal and only taste the garlic. \\n\\nThe only reason I'm giving them 3 paws is that the wait staff is fantastic. The service is top notch. You're actually treated like someone, not just another possible tipper. At least they are still doing this part of their business right.\\n\\n\\n\\nMy rating...3 Paws\\n\\nWith love from my dog bowl to yours....Happy eating.\\nShatasdogbowl"},{"name":"The Salt Lick BBQ","address":"18300 Fm 1826","city":"Driftwood","stars":"4","text":"It is really hard to find a decent BBQ place in Houston.

There is a reason why it's the only one with a line extending around the block every night.  Everything on the menu is superb.  Most of the dishes involve some combination of seafood, pasta, and either red or white sauce, though they also serve a couple of chicken dishes.  And yes, the butternut squash ravioli is truly magnificent--a great option for vegetarians and non-vegetarians alike.  Prices are comparable to other North End restaurants (and slightly cheaper than some), but the food is vastly superior. \\n\\nSome tips/warnings/disclaimers for the uninitiated:\\n\\nPlan to wait in line outside for an hour.  Take comfort in the fact that they do get people in and out quickly and the line does move.  Assuming it's not the middle of an ice storm in January, the wait can be pleasant.  Enjoy the fresh air, chat with your fellow dinner guests, get to know your neighbors in line, watch in amusement as unwitting tourists try to drive down/parallel park on Hanover St., and, if possible, use this time to browse the menu so that you'll be ready to order when you're seated.  (This place does not take kindly to the idle and/or indecisive!)\\n\\nOnce inside, don't mess with the staff.  Decide what to order quickly, place your order firmly and politely, and don't press your luck with any special requests or substitutions.  Side note: to the credit of the wait staff, I came here with a friend recently who has a gluten allergy (I know, an Italian restaurant is not the best place to go if you can't eat carbs, but whatever) and our server very politely helped her figure out what to order.  The wait staff here will not fawn over you or coddle you, but nine times out of ten they will see that you're taken care of.  Go in with a firm, decisive, yet friendly tone and you will receive the same treatment from them.\\n\\nEat at a brisk pace.  I have never been pressured to finish quickly here but it's best not to overstay your welcome here, if only because there are dozens of people waiting to take your table.  Pay cash, leave a tip, thank your server, and you'll be wished well on your way out the door.  \\n\\nFollow these simple rules and you'll be rewarded with some of the most delicious Italian food in the North End."},{"name":"McMenamins Crystal Hotel","address":"303 SW 12th Ave.","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Wow!

I've been to Teranga twice now and I'm still not sure how to describe Senegalese food.  There doesn't seem to be one signature dish or ingredient that (to me) typifies the cuisine.  With that said, both meals I had here were delicious.  I guess a lot of the dishes are comprised of braised meats and vegetables, but that's not saying a whole lot.\\n\\nThe one signature item I had both times was this combination of two drinks -- one (or maybe both?) are made from the baobab fruit.  I was told by a friend who had spent some time in Senegal that I was supposed to mix the two, though mostly I ended up just drinking the one that tasted like creamsicles almost exclusively.  That's right: liquid creamsicles.  It's every bit as decadent as it sounds.\\n\\nEven if you have no idea what Senegalese food is like, give Teranga a chance.

Are you not willing to spend more than $6 for it? Are you not willing to wait a long time to get it? Are you not willing to pay for table service? If you said yes to the first question and no to the last three questions, this place might have your answer. Located at one of the dingiest alleyways of Boston's Chinatown, this place serves a platter where you could get a generous spoonful of rice, and generous spoonfuls of three dishes of your choosing from a buffet counter. It also comes with a large cup of soup. The price, as of November 2010, is $5.25. \\n\\nPortions are pretty good here. Every time I come here with an empty stomach, I always got my stomach more than full after eating my dish. As for the quality of the dishes, keep your expectations fairly low.

What matters to me when I come here is getting my stomach more than full with somewhat decently tasty food and without spending a lot of money. \\n\\nThe soup is usually a greenish broth with some cabbage and possibly some sort of cucumber inside. It could be used as a drink if you are not willing to spend extra money on a beverage. \\n\\nSome of the dishes I liked were the fried mussels, the Chinese broccoli, the pork strips with pepper, and the steamed pork. Although the Chinese broccoli was oily, they were pretty tasty. The fried mussels were somewhat addicting to eat even though I did not taste much crispiness. The pork strips with pepper was tasty thanks to the oil and sauce. The steamed pork, despite having quite a bit of fat, was also pretty good. \\n\\nA couple of the dishes I did not like are the fried fish or the spare ribs. The fried fish tasted bland and a little dry, while the spare ribs were too bony. \\n\\nAs for atmosphere, it's not really a clean restaurant.

I'm going to break down this place so that anyone reading this has a good idea of what you're getting. This was our first trip to Portland and I remember our research having some holes. I'm feeling altruistic towards my fellow travelers so here's the real deal.\\n\\nFirst, lets talk about the location. It really doesn't get much better, I mean, you could be maybe a few blocks down in central downtown Portland but a 5 minute walk gets you there anyway. The building is on a weird island in the middle of the road. It's across the street from Whole Foods, a block away from Powell's Books. Honestly, plenty of restaurants, bars, shopping and easy access to transit. Do yourself a favor...if you don't NEED a car...don't bother. Parking is a pain in the ass everywhere downtown including here. The buses or MAX lines are clean, safe, and can take you anywhere.\\n\\nOk, the hotel itself, it's weird. You kinda have to go into staying here with the \\"I'm just going to embrace the weirdness\\" attitude. That attitude will actually serve you well in Portland anyway. We were told that it used to be a bath house...I think we also heard that it was a brothel. Either way, you'd never know it. Totally redone. Artwork in the place is cool, eclectic light fixtures...this ain't the Holiday Inn, it has character.\\n\\nThe Elevator... take the stairs. It is TINY, sounds like people are pulling on ropes to move the damn thing. Honestly, it's slow, creepy and if you are prone to claustrophobia, you may have a panic attack. I mean, it's probably ok but after the first trip up with our bags, we took the stairs.\\n\\nThe Pool is awesome. We were hiking, walking everywhere, biking.... We got sore. At the end of the night, you get a drink, sit in the hot water and it's very soothing. It's also a chance to meet fellow hotel dwellers... it was never packed when we went, but we met some nice people.\\n\\nThe shared bathroom thing is a hot button for many, it freaked out my wife and she was obsessing about it for a week before we got there. Here is how it works... You have your room with a sink and 2 small glass shelves. The bathroom is outside the room in the hallway. Sounds like a disgusting nightmare right? It really isn't. VERY CLEAN are the first two words that spring to mind. You gotta remember your key card and you may have to walk down the hall once or twice if the one closest to your room is occupied. Honestly, it's not a big deal. One thing that I did notice, if you get up in the middle of the night, it's impossible to open or shut your door without making a lot of noise. They are heavy ass doors. So if your partner is a light sleeper, maybe spring for a room on the end with its own bathroom. But I mean, get over it, it's not a big deal at all. My wife who was flipping out did tell me that it sounded like a lot more of a pain than it really is.\\n\\nThe actual rooms are not big...they aren't. The bed isn't either. I'm 6'4 so there was some initial concern that my lanky ass would take up all the space. Again, it was fine. Every room is inspired by a song; we had to look up our room's song on youtube but it was interesting.\\n\\nSo all in all.... It was a pleasant experience; we saved a little dough and had a great time. If you can't embrace the weirdness and want something real generic...there are a lot of other more expensive options."},{"name":"Austin's Pizza Guadalupe","address":"2324 Guadalupe","city":"Austin","stars":"3","text":"Came in for lunch on a weekday.

We were rushed out the door. The check was $80, and when collecting the money, that was the most Lynn talked, saying how thankful she was. Then when she realized I didn't tip to her liking, she burst out loudly \\"HA! They only left me so and so on an $80 check\\" ... first time here, and definitely our last.

I've wanted to try this place ever before I moved to Boston, but every time I walk by, there's a long, long line out the door. So, given its popularity, my friends and I decided to go early, around 4:30 pm (before it opens) and wait in line. Yes, waiting in line before the restaurant opens.. the crazy things we do for food.\\n\\nAnyway, we weren't seated immediately, because we were a party of four, but missing one person. Note taken, please have all members of your party present, so you can be seated.. otherwise, they won't seat you and will take in the next available and present party in line. \\n\\nThis place is tiny, but homey inside. You will probably end up sharing a table or sitting very close to another group of people. You might even spill your glass of water, because everything is so cramped in that knocking things over is almost, always expected.\\n\\nWe decided to share everything, so here's what we got.\\n1) calamari: delicious, large, perfectly battered pieces of calamari with spicy peppers, adds an extra kick\\n2) fresh mozzarella ball with tomatoes drizzled with evoo and balsamic vinegar: I absolutely love mozzarella, so this was a definite win for me. Great app to share with people.\\n3) Pesto pasta with mussels and clams: Very solid pesto pasta dish with perfectly cooked seafood\\n4) Fusilli with lobster with Giacomo sauce: Fresh tasting fusilli with special Giacomo sauce is a must-try for this joint.. I wish there were more lobster in the dish though.\\n5) Lobster ravioli: Another great tasting lobster dish, but again, I wish there were more lobster!\\n \\nBy the end of the meal, we were super full, satisfied, and happy (very happy for me). The bill wasn't too bad either, but it's cash only (like many other places in the North End)."},{"name":"J.

Not taking away anything from the sushi restaurant but the wait can be ridiculous and the fact that they take reservation for small parties in such a small restaurant is not only inefficient but makes other potential new customers to turn around and try their luck elsewhere. To be honest with you the sushi here seems like sushi everywhere except for the smoked salmon sushi which blew my mind. I would have to say that roll of sushi was probably one of the best I've had. \\n\\nAnother thing I like about this restaurant is the fact that, everything seems to be authentic.

I drink just as much high life as the next guy but we all have to step it up sometimes.  I have been here quite a few times so i am now ready to write a review.\\n\\nFood:\\nI have had the fries and the hush puppies.  They were both outstanding.  Judging from the quality of both, i can not imagine the regular food being bad.\\n\\nService: \\nThe first time we went it was rather spotty but very friendly.  When i was there last friday though it was great.  Our waitress had a Denise Huxtuble vibe going.  She was knowledgeable and cool.  A perfect mix.\\n\\nBeer:\\nThey have the best selection of beer in the city.  Yes i said in the city becasue the brickstore is not in the city.  It is in that lame suburb known as Decatur.  I have seen people complain about the price.  All in all i think the pricing is fair.  It is much higher octane so it takes a lot less to get drunk.  I usually spend about 30 bucks there and walk out pretty cocked.  As far as Alagash being 5 bucks for an 8 ounce serving, well that is just not true.  It is $3.  \\n\\nWhy only 4 stars?:\\nI had to take away a star for the suprising amount of UGA / Buckhead / Neighbors types in there.  I am not really sure if there was an excess of these types because it was a holiday weekend or what but it was a very unwelcome sight.  I thought we all agreed that we get little 5 points, east atlanta, and the poncy highlands and you all can have buckhead, midtown, and the highlands once Ponce is crossed.  Cmon guys.  This treaty is binding.\\n\\nOverall:\\nThis bar could possibly get a spot with the Local and Manuels as a go to bar.  I appreciate the slayer, dead kennedys and metallica played late at night as well.  Maybe they could play DK earlier and scare off the riff raff.\\n\\nTip\\nGo with friends that are not a pain in the ass when the bill comes.  Your bill will look ridiculous at the end of the night because if you are like me you will have at least 5 different beers.  Go with 2 or 3 reliable friends and just split the bill evenly.

When first Cibo opened, we dined there about twice a month, then stopped going about a year and a half ago. The service was lacking and we were not treated well. Your prices need some adjustment as they are too high. Extra sauce for pasta? Not possible. Special requests? Forget about it. Salad dressing \\"on the side\\" request was ignored. Ten dollars for a chopped salad? Why not put a simple tossed side salad on the menu for $5? Most of us like a salad with our pasta, but not at $10. And the pasta carbonara--are you serious charging $19? And $24 for a basic lasagna? Several times, our waiter did not check in with us to see if we were pleased with our food. One time, I was served my lukewarm meal a full twelve minutes before my partner was served. Being polite, I waited to eat until he was served. By that time, my Chicken Piccata was cold. Had to leave our table to find the manager to order more wine. Had to find the manager again to get our check.

Let let me tell you, things may never be the same. My hubby has even gone so far as to declare his meal at Craigie *possibly* better than his beloved L'Espalier.\\n\\nFor starter's the craft cocktails are amazing. I have been gushing about the \\"classic\\" cocktail for many a post lately, and I still think it's fantastic. The bartender, sorry ... mixologist, was like a mind reader. I told our waiter Jonathan (who by the way was really great at explaining everything to us) what I liked and didn't like, he conveyed it to the mixologist and the result was the perfectly crafted cocktail, just to my liking. Order off the menu if you like ... or be whimsical and let the craftsmen (or women) perfect their trade. Trust me, you won't be disappointed. I will also add a plug for the mocktails with amazing ingredients such as homemade almond syrup, rhubarb juice, ginger beer, bitters - the list goes on and on. \\n\\nCocktails in hand, the four of us began perusing the menu. With SO many appealing options, how were we to choose? Well it was easy, we didn't. We let the Chef choose for us. We all opted for the 6 course tasting menu for $80 bucks a pop. Not cheap, but heck, we're here for a culinary experience right?\\n\\nThis is where I let the menu and the pictures do (most of) the talking (see pic of full printed menu and pictures in blog). They kinda speak for themselves. There is NO possible way I could have remembered all of the courses and the unique ingredients that comprised them. No possible way. Luckily, I didn't have to as Jonathan graciously offered to have the hostess prepare a personal printed menu of the chef's selections for each of us to take home. And you'd think, that's easy, right? That the hostess can simply print out the pre-set chef's tasting course of the night? Nope. Each and every table gets a different make up of courses, so the menu was totally personalized for our table. Honestly, where can you find such personalized service?\\n\\nOh and before I forget - many of the ingredients are local-yocal. Chef/Owner Tony Maws finds the ingredients first, surveying local farmers and purveyors, each and every day, and then creates the menu. Literally, the menu changes daily. In fact, the last page of the clipboard menu lists all of the local food suppliers that were used in preparing the day's menu. Really freakin' awesome.\\n\\nSo the first four courses consisted of seafood. Tony uses uncommon or rare ingredients such as caviar, geoduck, squid noodles, etc. Of these delicious dishes, my favorite was easily the sashimi dish, but truly, everything was phenomenal. Though, the geoduck got a few skeptical glances at first.\\n\\nNow onto the meat. These were the hits of the evening for me, a true carnivore at heart. The Vermont (local!) meats, both the organic braised lamb and the pork were absolutely out of this world. The lamb meat was so tender it was falling off the bone (as it should be). And the crunch of the shallots and zing of the ginger provided just the right compliment. Fantastic, it shouldn't get any better ... but it did. When I was first looking at the menu, I had my eye on the \\"Pork Two Ways\\" dish. In fact, if there was any disappointment with choosing the tasting menu at all, it was because I wasn't going to get to try this dish. Well, low and behold, to my surprise, it was one of the courses. Yippee! And it was the favorite of the night, for me. The suckling confit had just the right amount of crispness to the skin to set off the soft tender meat below. And the pork belly? Just enough fat to meat proportion to make it one of the most delicious things ever. Not to mention the mushrooms and perfectly cooked cashews on the side.\\n\\nSo that should be it, right? The 6 courses above ... well Tony is so into the creativity of the Chef's menu that he doesn't really stick to the numbers, he just keeps cooking away. Instead of 6, we ended up with a full 9 courses, rounding out the evening with 3 dessert courses. Everyone got the first selection which was the panna cotta, but there were two different types. A jasmine infused and a rooibos infused. Two of us got the jasmine and two of us got the rooibos. The rooibos was my personal favorite, the smooth creamy panna cotta, with a hint of the rooibos and citrus kick. Then, for the second round of dessert, instead of each of us getting the same exact thing, we were each brought a different treat. Needless to say, there was a lot of dish passing going around. My favorite was the chocolate terrine, but I have a feeling the overall winner was the market fruit crisp with the champagne mangoes. The miss, there be, would have to be the grits. I don't think any of us were too into the grits. Too savory for us, but if that's what you're into, you might enjoy it. The final selection was a small cup chile and cardamom hot chocolate.

Unfortunately, Le Viet is a disappointment.  I tried the lemongrass chicken. My order came with a small portion of chicken that had very little lemongrass flavour. The deep fried spring roll looked great, but that too was less than stellar. It was more hard than crunchy, and the tarot root filling was gluey in the way that potatoes get when over-mashed. It's a sad day when I'm let down by something deep fried. The rice noodles were terrible. You wouldn't think they could mess up something so basic.  My noodles were broken into small pieces that were hard to pick up. My Vietnamese friend said the they were probably overcooked. Another friend went on a different day and reported the same problem. \\n\\n My lunch buddy was not impressed by his order of beef pho. The picture showed slices of beef steak fanned out on top, like you see in all Vietnamese places. His order did not looking anything like the picture.

Other people in my party ordered the Lobster Ratatouille Omelet, a nice sized portion with the day's veggies and succulent lobster.\\n\\nDrinks:  I had my share of Bellini's, although they make Bellini's differently at Ruth Chris (I was thinking more of a puree would be involved) it was syrup + champagne.

Considering how little both of those items cost the restaurant (and how important bread is w/meat and cheese), they really need to give you more than four paltry slices when you order two meats and two cheeses. Service was spotty, but not terrible. Lastly, when you advertise an egg on pizza, it's meant to cook on the pizza itself and the yolk should be runny. Unfortunately, it was pretty obvious that they fried the egg separately (not to mention that they overcooked it...) and then just slapped it on the pizza.

That was the shrimp and grits and the peach Cobbler French Toast. It was soooooo good. We loved the flavors.

Fun atmosphere and excellent BBQ."},{"name":"Mozart's Coffee Roasters","address":"3825 Lake Austin Blvd","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"People, the purpose of Yelp is not to leave one-star reviews as petty revenge against the ONE server who was having a bad day when you happened to go.  The purpose is to be HELPFUL, to give people an overall idea of what to expect, so they can decide whether or not they want to take the trouble of finding out first-hand.\\n\\nMozart's is hands-down my single favorite location in all of Austin.  No asterisks to that statement.  I would go there every day, if only I lived a little closer.  For me, it's kind of a hassle to make the trip, but it's worth it every single time.  I love this place!!  I will try to give you a big-picture idea, so you can decide if it's what you're looking for.\\n\\nWHAT TO EXPECT:\\n\\nTHE SCENERY: The view is gorgeous, inside or out, day or night.  Lots of choices of where to sit, including a lower level with picnic tables right along the edge of the water.  For inside seating, it's almost entirely windowed.  Beautiful building, beautiful location.  It honestly feels like I'm on vacation just going there.  There's a huge tree on the upper-level deck outside that usually has lots of dangling lights.  Really, you just have to go see this place.  Browsing Google Images doesn't compare to the live experience.  I especially love places like this because every time you go, you can mix it up by sitting in an area that is very different from the place where you sat the previous visit.\\n\\nTHE COFFEE: For those like me who love black coffee and flavored coffee, this is the best game in town.  They have a great variety of black coffee at all times, and I go there just to have a bottomless cup.  That way, I can sample a little bit of all of them.  Yum!  I can't speak for the lattes and such, but the black coffee alone is worth the trip.  Actually, this is just a shot in the dark here, but if you've ever been to The Crooked Tree in St. Charles, MO, the coffee selection and quality is comparable--definitely what I look for in a coffee shop, but seldom find.\\n\\nTHE SERVICE: I honestly have no idea what all these one-star reviews are about.  I've been here MANY times, and ALWAYS I've been treated with good cheer.  Other coffee shops in Austin (MOST of them, come to think of it) have had some genuinely rude service, but not once have I ever found the customer service to be lacking.  Speaking of rude people, the patrons themselves are generally more pleasant here than other coffee shops, because many of the other coffee shops are overrun by either unfriendly hipsters or UT students.  In my experience, Mozart's hires much nicer people AND draws a much nicer crowd.\\n\\nOTHER PROS: Live music.  Unfortunately, I can't review that because the only times I'm able to go are when there is no band playing.  I can't help there, but they do have live music.  Lots of delicious treats behind the counter.  Open late.  Next door to a really great sports bar, The Hula Hut (check it out!).\\n\\nTHE CONS: Okay, to be fair it is often very crowded, and yes, espresso machines are noisy.  So, if you sit in the room with the register, it's going to be noisy.  Deal with it.  Also, there aren't that many power outlets, so if you go and it's crowded, I hope you brought a long extension cord.  Finding a parking space can be frustrating, as well.  Lastly, I have to say that the last two times I've gone, the wifi was spotty at best.  When I drive all that way, I expect to at least be able to get online.  That hasn't always been the case, but let the buyer beware.  Okay, I guess when you take that into account, it shouldn't be 5 stars but more like 4.99 stars. ;)\\n\\nMozart's is my haven.  I only wish they were open 24 hours!  I guess 1 AM will have to do."},{"name":"Giacomo's Ristorante - Boston","address":"355 Hanover St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"Worth. The. Wait.

I also felt that instead of having all of these unusual names if items on the menu without explaining what they meant ( we googled them but it was a pain) it would've helped if the menu had explained them,   so we did not have to wait until going over everything with the waiter.  \\n\\n The food is definitely creative but I did not feel that it was worth the expense which came to almost $300 including tip & a drink for each of the other two people."},{"name":"Double Comfort Restaurant","address":"505 N High St","city":"Columbus","stars":"3.5","text":"I think I had the worse meal in in a very long time.

We admired a fritto of greaseless and impeccably fresh smelts and the rago√ªt composed of mushrooms, house-made sausage, cock's combs, and various fall vegetables.  A juicy (and very tasty) chicken over polenta made for a very satisfying main course, as did the local pork prepared three ways - melt-in-your mouth suckling pig, unctuous pork belly, and a rib that featured a faintly Asian rub (star anise).  The gingerbread pain pedu was outstanding, light yet rich, its sweetness accentuated by an intense pineapple sauce.  The service is knowledgeable and attentive.  One small gripe: while I applaud the trend of restaurants to serve filtered tap water (both still and carbonated), I think that charging $7 per carafe is a bit much.\\n\\nThe kitchen, with its fascinating ballet of chefs concentrating on their various tasks, is in full view and (at least for me) endlessly fascinating.

The Prime Rib which was slow roasted to perfection...the ONLY thing that weirded me out a bit was that it came with blue cheese for dipping, doesn't it usually come with a type of horseradish sauce? Either way it was yummy! We also had the Monster Roast Beef Wrap, this thing was HUGE as well as the Jax Burger. One of my favorite entrees was the wings, they have a nice selection of flavors and the wings are big and have a great portion of meat on them. \\n\\nAnd last but not least the dessert! The Strawberry Shortcake, Fried Cheese Cake Sundae, and Brownie Sandwich. All 3 of these were amazing but the Brownie Sunday was my absolute favorite...had a total mouthgasm! \\n\\nIf you're a craft beer lover like myself you will be pleasantly surprised by the over 60 craft beers on draft! I enjoyed a Sweetwater 420 and a cider! \\n\\nOverall I was incredibly impressed by the food, atmosphere, and service provided by Jax Lake Mary and I can't wait to come back with some of my friends...especially for Football Season!!"},{"name":"Jim's Restaurants","address":"9091 Research Blvd","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"I have always been  diner person that is how I grew up.

Giacomo's is a pretty small restaurant; it's pretty mushed over there. They got extremely nice people working there; taking their time to explain each sauce & any questions you may  have. Let me warn you before hand... the line will be pretty long. We waited 1 hr and 45 minutes to get in (2 blocks worth of line) and it started raining toward the end. And let me tell you... it's worth every freaking minute!!!\\n\\nFor our appetizer, we ordered the \\"Antipasto\\" ($10) - Imported Provolone Cheese,Sopressatta, Bresola,Roasted Peppers, Stuffed Peppers and Vinegar Marinated Vegetables. This dish's simply outstanding; the vinegar mixes sooo well with all the peppers and meat. You guys gotta try this, it's just bloody amazing...\\n\\nIn Giacomo's, they only serve seafood for all the entrees, no other type of meat. For some of the dishes, they let you pick the sauce that comes with it. Listed below're some of their sauces:\\n\\n*Pesto - basil, crushed garlic, olive oil.\\n*Fra Diavolo - spicy lobster sauce; tomato based with pepper.\\n*Red - lobster sauce.\\n*Giacomo - creamy.\\n*Scampi - butter.\\n\\n1. Frutti Di Mare ($19) - Shrimp, Scallops, Calamari, Clams & Mussels. We had this with the Giacomo sauce. It's freaking awesome; the sauce's not too creamy or anything.  The sauce's a bit to lighter side, but not in a bad way; you can tell that there's plenty of ingredients put into the sauce. The portion's huge with plenty of seafood.\\n\\n2. Shrimp and Lobster Fusilli Special with Fra Diavolo sauce ($26) - out of this world. This is probably their most popular dish so I just had to try it. This dish's just bursting with flavor & all those ingredients mix well together. It definitely blew me away. Once again, the portion's humongous. They put quite a bit of lobster meat; it's definitely worth the price.  [Fusilli - long, crorkscrewed pasta]\\n\\n\\nConclusion: Bloody awesome. Delicious meal, huge portion, reasonable price & good service, what's not to like?!?!

The food took a while to come out but it was understandable as they make almost everything to order (even the complimentary bread). For my entree I ordered a corn risotto with seared scallops and pesto. Was delicious! The corn risotto brought out the sweetness of the dish while the fresh pesto brought out the aromatics. My friend ordered a fish dish that cake with crab on top. Was amazing. And for dessert we had bread pudding with vanilla ice cream, which was probably the best bread pudding I had in a while. Not too sweet, but sweet enough to be a decadent dessert. \\n\\nAlthough the food was amazing, the service was a little bit unprofessional for the theme they were going for. And the location is horrible as well as the aesthetics. The inside looks like it was previously a warehouse and they have a huge garage like opening against one wall and tables are against it. The tables were too small for all food we ordered. And the floors were smooth cement I think, but not very aesthetically appealing. The location was very surprising as I feel a restaurant like this could be found in Winter Park or Downtown Orlando. If you look at the restaurant from outside it looks likes it's closed.

(typically i drench bbq sauce on everything). the coleslaw didn't have much flavor to it, but was average. the beans had a slightly strange after taste. i think if it had some base to it, like bacon, it would have been better. i didn't like the potatoes at all. the pickely taste was completely unexpected. i'm pretty sure there was bread served, but i wasn't about the fill my belly was expanding starches. it was all about the meats here. i had a bite of hubby's beef ribs. the ribs were based in bbq sauce and had a bold and savory flavor...not at all sweet like i thought they would be.\\n\\ni would definitely come back for the bbq. but only if there isn't a long wait. though, i don't know if that's likely. the sides weren't great, but i'm fine with just meat. oh yeah, and stop by and check out the pit...its glorious."},{"name":"Stats","address":"300 Marietta St NW","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3.5","text":"The service here is awesome.

They are also accommodating to my order preferences, for example when I order the tofu with vegetables, but no scallions, and please make it vegetarian so no oyster sauce or fish sauce, and brown rice please.  Their curries are not my favorite, and I'm not confident that they're strictly vegetarian, so I usually order non-curry dishes, which I think is this restaurant's strength.\\n\\nSeveral reviews here seem to complain about the service.  I haven't had any problems with the service here, but then it also seems obvious to me I'm not as particular about service as some people on here.

THEN moving BACK to austin, domino's was just gross. i ordered a couple of times and the cheese had an awful gritty texture?! the crust was soggy... inedible! i was ready to say goodbye to domino's! but recently, i couldn't help but get sucked into the commercials talking about all the changes in this pizza.\\n\\nthe crust: definitely garlic-y. seems like they tossed a bunch of garlic powder into the mix. the smell is overpowering, but not in a bad way. garlic is gooood. in addition to the garlic powder, the crust seems to be a bit greasier than before. i don't remember domino's crust being too greasy before, but eh. the crust on the outside was good- flavorful, slightly crunchy and bready at the same time. towards the center of the pizza though, the tip of the triangle... that was a little on the soggier side. keep workin on it boys.\\n\\nthe sauce: robust. i'm not sure if there's a huge noticeable difference in the sauce, but i did think to myself 'wow, this sauce has a lot of flavor'. marketing has done its job. i'm now brainwashed. i think the extra flavor equals more salt, as it was definitely saltier than before. \\n\\nthe cheese: not a winning change. as different locations somehow send out pizzas of varying quality, the cheese to this last one was not stringy and chewy as it should be, imo. i need the stringy cheese that you have to really pull apart from my mouth and face when i eat pizza. this cheese didn't have any texture to it... aside from the color, i couldn't really tell that it was cheese either! it just kind of fell apart? eh. not good for pizza. \\n\\nso... i'm currently a fan... -ish. i'll have to give it another try from a different location, and somehow i already see that experience being totally different."},{"name":"Estelle's Boston","address":"782 Tremont St","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"We ended up here by accident last night after deciding that our first destination looked a little shady.

We ordered the Brooklyn and it was topped with fresh local sausage, caramelized onions, and peppers. Ordering the larger portion is required if you want to split the pizza. \\n\\n\\nThe rest is partially my fault.... \\n\\nI ordered the Caesar salad that clearly stated it had anchovy on it, but come on, really? Do people REALLY enjoy their salad tasting like anchovy....the server could have pre warned me. So it was $8.00 but not worth it. Even if you take the fish off, there is a huge egg crouton on there, which would pair well with fire roasted tomatoes on a bed of lettuce with a vinegarette dressing..not on a caesar salad. \\n\\nOverall, I believe it wasn't worth it because of the experience that I wanted to have and the experience I didn't have there....but I would return.

I didn't join in, as I was perfectly happy as a voyeur that time around, but I haven't had so much fun sitting at a bar in a long time.

Dum Aloo Cashmiri, a stuffed potato with pureed vegetables, was enveloped in a creamy tomato based sauce; hearty but not overwhelming. The Butter Nan, was crispy on the outside and soft on the inside perfect for dipping into the curry.

We went in on Friday and had to wait a few minutes for a table. No big deal. The place was packed. Once we sat it took forever for our server to come over she offered us water. Seemed put out when we just asked for tap. Never came back to ask us if we wanted any other drinks.  Finally and i do mean finally came over to take our order. I had the French Onion Soup and the half short rib.  My friend had half a Shrimp Po Boy and the Mushroom soup. My fries were chilly and her's were like ice. Her soup was cold and and it was obvious that mine had been sitting under a heating lamp. My sandwhich was tasteless and the beef was dry.  When the waitress finally came to check on us my friend complained about the fries and was given a brand new piping hot order. The waitress never came back again- and we noticed that people all around us where done with dirty plates sitting in front of them.  When we went to pay we both put in 20's and expected change- without asking if it was all set the waitress pocketed the change as a tip.  This was $3 more than a 20% tip. I know its not a lot of money but there was nothing about this experience that warranted over tipping. I will never go back to this place."},{"name":"Giacomo's Ristorante - Boston","address":"355 Hanover St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"I never write reviews, but this place deserves one.

The menu changes monthly on the first Tuesday of each month and November's menu is entirely gluten-free. \\n\\nThis place is all about the dining experience and ours was phenomenal. I was a little worried when we were the only patrons in the place,but the first people to arrive after us were turned away because this cozy place was entirely full for the night and they only do one seating per table. You should probably make a reservation unless you are enjoying a drink and dessert at the bar. \\n\\nOnto our feast! We started with a simply exquisite pumpkin pate topped with fried rutabaga crisps, perfect texture and set the stage for the rest of our meal. As an appetizer we had their bbq chicken skewers that was accompanied by black bean salsa and a delicately fried avocado. It was unusual and delicious! For my dinner I had the prosciutto wrapped chicken over risotto with some fantastic grean beans. My boyfriend had the spaghetti with mushrooms and lentils that were melded together into meatless meatballs. It was surprisingly hearty, filling and some of the best spaghetti I have had in awhile! Each dish was really a treat to be savored and for once I couldn't pick a favorite among them. They have a nice wine list and of course won my heart with their beer list which included Oakshire and Hopworks but the beer is served from 22 oz bottles, not draft so we ended up splitting a bottle.\\n\\nOur service was excellent. Our server was a really personable, nice guy who was extremely knowledgeable about all aspects of the restaurant.

You probably don't need to read my review to see that people think highly of this place, and I also rank it as one of my favorite places in Portland.  So why withhold the fifth star?  As another reviewer mentioned, you are paying a lot for a dish that was shaped by conditions of poverty.  I mean, if you get the Frijoles Negros, you do realize you are eating beans, right?  Beans are about $2.99 in bulk at Whole Seasons and a bell pepper is about $.90 apiece maybe, and if you have cumin, red vinegar and an average person's spice cabinet you just got yourself the makings of Frijoles Negros for a whopping $4-5.\\n\\nThese are just small complaints though.  The food is really good if you are kitchen illiterate and don't mind paying this much money.  The lunch/dinner platters and the like are all good here.  Sandwiches disappoint, though.  I agree with the person who said the plantain chips taste dehydrated or something.  In fact, people with sensitive teeth or dentures should abstain since they can sometimes be of a jerky-like consistency.  Don't pass up the drink menu here, the batidos are delicious and worth the price if you get one with real fruit.  The one with platano is really nice, but if you like guanabana then the champola batido was made for you.  Also, if you're from or have been to a Latin American country that serves sugarcane juice and you tried it and liked it without getting any horrific foodborne illness, you should know that you can special order it here by itself, or with citrus juice to make a \\"Limonada de guarapo.\\"  The desserts are really good, if a little impractical.  Do try more than the flan.\\n\\nIf you want to get this food on the relative cheap, come for La Hora del Amigo, where you can get a la carte versions of everything and a few things they don't have on the regular menu.  The guava empanada is both large enough and sweet enough for two people to share, and I always get it if I am coming here late at night because it's not on the regular menu.  The yuca con mojo is also great, and one of the few things really worth the price as yuca is both hard to find and hard to prepare due to its toxicity levels when raw.\\n\\nThe Desayuno Cubano is their breakfast, and yes, it is also good.  The basket of pastries doesn't have to be a shared appetizer!  A typical Cuban-American breakfast consists of assorted pastries and coffee, and it is even called \\"Desayuno Tipico\\" on the menu for a combined price that's 50 cents cheaper than ordering the basket and coffee seperate.  Speaking of price, getting 8 high-quality miniature pastries for $5 by itself makes this the cheapest and most filling option on the menu.  My dining partners were very happy with their eggy breakfasts as well and gladly took the one bran muffin that snuck into my pastry bounty off my hands.  Oh yeah, when you order coffee make sure you say 'cafe cubano' or else you will get the drip stuff identical to home brew and not the stronger Cuban coffee.\\n\\nPambiche serves up what is an amalgam of Cuban American cuisine and what real Cuban cuisine might be like if they had access to the same ingredients.  Yes, it's really good, but it's also overpriced for many of the simpler dishes like beans, rice, or pork.  Unlike others here, I don't mind the close seating though.  It's not like there are unsavory types or smelly people in here ever, and outside tables give you all the room you could need if you're particular.  The servers are friendly enough and this place is open during the late afternoon if you want to beat the crowd to dinner.\\n\\nBonus:  There is a cool and authentic Latin grocery/market shop up Glisan further and they sell fresh-squeezed exotic fruit juice among other things.

I am not a fan of being disrespected or yelled at, so I left without my sandwich. The lady that told her to be polite and not address us like that, offered to make my sandwich for me, but I declined because of the disrespect that I had experienced. While the lady was offering to make my sandwich for me, the older lady who yelled at us continued to mumble under her breath about how she didn't care.

It had been over a year since I ate at Another Broken Egg Cafe. So a friend I decided to have brunch there after a my doctor appt. We were greeted with a smile by the friendly hostess who escorted us to our table. While reviewing the menu I was very disappointed that the menu items had changed. I was not thrilled with the new offerings esp since they no longer served Reubens. Then our server arrived. Her name was Jane. What a dynamic young lady.  We exchanged brief friendly conversation then she left us to decide. She strategically checked on us with perfect intervals as we agonized over the menu for a long time. Unhappy, I was going to settle for an order of turkey sausage and just eat when I got home and never come back. Then Jane suggested the Bella Wrap (her personal favorite). OMG!!!  It was deeeeelicious!!  We laugh and joked about my dilemma and simply had a festive time. But I couldn't decide which was most outstanding--The Bella Wrap or our server Jane. LOL This brunch venture could have been a disastrous affair. Jane saved the day. I just loved her personality--humble, friendly. caring. and professional. I will be going back there again specially for the Bella Wrap and calling ahead to request Jane."},{"name":"Stone Soup Kitchen","address":"584 Woodward Ave","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"I did not enjoy my blueberry pancakes or the frenchtoast.

Two employees out front, one very overwhelmed guy doing the entire build-your-poke process, and a girl standing at the register looking bored. Even though there was only one person in front of us when we arrived, it took at least 5 minutes for the first of our group to be able to start ordering. When it was my turn, the guy seemed completely boggled when I said I didn't want any of the protein options (a vegetarian poke bowl is pretty awesome, on occasion, just fyi) and then closed my lid after I said I wanted mango and avocado... He seemed very confused when I said I wasn't finished after adding two sides?? Even more confused when I said I wanted one of the sauces, apparently since I hadn't ordered fish, but even so, \\"Uh...ugh. Whatever.\\" didn't really seem like an appropriate response. \\nI then asked the girl at the register what the drinks in the machines were, since the labels were too small to see, and she had to check, and also didn't know what POG juice was when I asked. I heard the guy tell her it was passion fruit, orange, guava, but when she walked back to me, her response was, \\"um, it's passion fruit juice?\\" Three types of fruit shouldn't be all that difficult to remember, and if you're an employee, you should know what your restaurant serves. \\nOk, so bad initial experience, but I was sure it will get better once I ate. Sadly, no. The mango had a powdery/gooey metallic taste, so apparently it's canned, the citrus kale was very, very bitter, and the crab salad was the most bland I've tasted. They did do one thing extremely well--the rice was PERFECT. I don't know if they start with a higher quality than most places, but it was perfectly steamed, just sticky enough, and surprisingly flavorful. \\n\\nNo one in our group finished their meal, it took home leftovers.

Some background...we are a middle aged couple, came in in a great mood ready for a great meal.\\n\\nOn the pro side, our table was waiting for us when we arrived about 10 minutes late due to no parking spaces nearby, the sous waiters were quite good, the food came to the table in a great rhythm and the bread and butter were fabulous....BUT:\\n\\nOur main waitress was loud, condescending, not very observant and either not well informed about the food, or in too much of a hurry to answer our questions.   At her first appearance at our table she presented the option of the tasting menu ($98, 6 courses) as if only cheapskates and people that don't appreciate fine dining would order anything else.  The prix fixe menu ($67, 3 courses)was presented as a poor second choice. And it wasn't until we asked if there was a way to order a-la-carte (since we don't usually eat desserts)  that she directed us to the tiny print below the prix fixe menu that indicated  that one could order any appetizer on the prix fixe menu for $18 (even for a salad) and/or entree for $38 (+$5 for the steak).  But, she made it really clear that only dolts would order a la carte.  Then over the next 10 minutes as my husband and I were obviously perusing the menu(eg holding it up and eyeing it), deciding what to order, she proceeded to come over to our table no less than 6 times...each time asking in a loud, cutting voice \\"Are you ready to order, YET\\".  It was said in a way that made it clear we were inconveniencing her by not being ready to order.  Since we had come in at 8:30 as an early last seating we couldn't figure out why she felt the need to rush us.  When we were ready to order and asked her about how dishes were prepared she didn't seem to have a clue.  The best she could do was tell me that the bass had a red butter sauce (no idea why it was red, but evidently not tomatoes) and that the cod had cream in it (but no it wasn't a cream sauce).   \\n\\nUnfortunately, for us, the food did not make up at all for service that approached on rude.  The fried clam appetizer  was OK.  I didn't like it, but my husband did. And my husband described his octopus appetizer as rubbery and tasteless.  The entrees were similarly uneven.  My husband got the pork 3 ways...one way was a extremely fatty cut, another way was something that resembled and tasted like a small piece of ham(I think pig's ear) and a third way was one nice tasting rib (a little less tasty than what we had had at a friend's bar-b-que the week before).  My stripped bass was probably the best dish, very well cooked, a tasty sauce, and the one piece of walnut that was on this dish tasted heavenly with the sauce and fish....too bad they couldn't have spared a second walnut piece to go with it.  The check with 1 beer, 1 cocktail and 1 glass of  of their most inexpensive  ($14) red wines came to about $185 with tip.  And yes because we have worked in the food industry we did tip the waitress 20% anyway.\\n\\nWe won't be going back.  We found the service pretentious, approaching on rude ..without the food to back it up. Maybe the food is better if you get the tasting menu, but at close to $300 per couple, if you have drinks, we are not willing to take that risk. I have to wonder if opening a new restaurant is taking too much of Tony Maws time and attention away from Craige on Main.\\n\\nPS.. If the check had been a bit cheaper I might have given Craige 2 stars....however in my book, you shouldn't charge top dollar and deliver this kind of experience ever."},{"name":"Lunch On Main Street","address":"3569 Main St","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Oh, boy.

From the laser-printed-on-printer-paper menus to the cardboard bowls the food is served in to the flat wooden spoons they're using as utensils (which made me feel like I was supposed to be eating a little cup of ice cream), everything just felt...cheap.

We moved on to carafes of the house cab/merlot blend (Copper Ridge), which we liked better - although the price ($7 for a two-glass carafe) or the greater leeway always given to one's second (or third) glass of wine may have accounted for this fact.\\n\\nA smattering of tapas was also sampled:  the crab croquetas, the brie, the eggplant spread, the slow roasted garlic, and the cajun spiced edamame.  Tapas are each 3-4 ounces (i.e., really small) and all cost $3.95.  Frankly, the two items that were modified least from their original state - the brie and the garlic - were our favorites. The edamame was overcooked and underspiced (and the portion was a little chintzy for $4), the eggplant spread was cold and bland, and the croquetas, while fine, weren't anything I'd bother ordering again.\\n\\nLike the rest of our experience, the service was also fine, but not great.

I had the shredded pork (forgive me but i can't remember the actual name of the entree) and the flavor and spice blended so well with the side of rice.\\n\\nI need to emphasize again that this is NOT your typical mexican.  There are no chimichangas, burritos, or tacos and especially no dump of refried beans!  This is a BISTRO with beautiful flavors and spices of Mexico.  There are no sombreros for your birthday song either.

(Someone mentioned that the Basket of Bread (bread and hummus) was given to them, but that was not the case with us.) I found the Tostadas delicious, and the hummus a bit bland. We then shared the Patatas Bravas (Wild & Spicy Potatoes), Queso de Cabra Monta√±es (Baked Goat Cheese in Tomato Basil Sauce), Berenjena Rellena (Vegetable and Goat Cheese Stuffed Eggplant Rolls), and the Palta Reina (Crab and Mango Stuffed Avocado). The patatas weren't dry or overcooked. The queso was good with the bread. The berenjena rellena was flavorful and stuffed with asparagus, albeit it's just one 3-in roll that is served. The palta reina was ok, because the avocado overpowered the crab and mango. All the dishes were fresh and pretty good overall.\\n\\nFor drinks, we tried their bourbon cocktails and a red wine. I really enjoyed my cocktail, which was essentially a bourbon pomegranate mojito. Bourbon is better than sangria when it's cold out.\\n\\nThe ambiance was relaxing. The decor is red, white and black. The bar was great. Everything was nice and clean.\\n\\nService was good. The waitstaff were attentive and not intrusive.\\n\\nThe only downside was that they gave our window table away, even with reservations. We ended up sitting in one of their bigger booths that can seat six people. It was comfortable, but it made talking difficult for us three people.\\n\\nOverall, I recommend this place for after-work drinks and quick bites, large groups, and the romantic dinner. They said they'll have an outdoor seating area in the summer, so I look forward to having some sangria under that hot New England sun."},{"name":"Row 34","address":"383 Congress St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"My favorite restaurant in Boston.

No matter how long the line is, it's well worth the wait....and, I mentioned you can bring your own beer and wine which can help pass the time in line. The pizza is delicious. So delicious that there are few options to choose and they don't take personal requests -- no subbing/swapping out. The family-style seating creates opportunity to share the experience with other dining patrons. If you're lucky enough to get the large farm table up front you can avoid the packed out kitchen. If you're really lucky to even notice the small private-ish room off the kitchen you're in for a real treat if it's open. Antico Pizza is by far one of the tastiest pizzerias in town that offers a unique experience.

Our Uber driver turned right and went down a block or two and then left on Euclid.  Immediately the neighborhood vibe changed to a more gritty, graffiti area.  Pulled up in front of Porter and had to look closely to spot the narrow, brown front door among other kind of messy facades. But, we were committed and made our way thru some people near the door.  On entering there is a very narrow, long bar area.  Walking further it opens up into a fairly spacious area of booths and tables.  The interior is decorated in a casual, funky but tasteful and creative manner.  We learned the interior used to be an exterior alley.  \\n\\nOur server told us of the beer cellar and encouraged us take a tour before a private party arrived.  The cellar is a cool space with an attractive, long wood table and chairs surrounded by thousands of bottles of beer - a great space for a private party of up to probably 12 guests.  Private cellar fee is $100.\\n\\nWe enjoyed great service from a friendly, knowledgable server. Ordered Heston's Meat Fruit off daily specials starters along with Goat Fritters and Mac n Cheese - all very good.  Then flank steaks off the specials menu and a Porter burger - all excellent.  We asked our server to pair each course/dish with recommended beers which he did expertly.

If you grab a booth you're in luck, because socializing anywhere else is a little akward. Not only because it's cramped, but also because the crowd is as random as pairing a cafe with a bar. What you see is a bunch of Inman Park and outlying locals flocking to the newest thing in the area. So, there's no true identity yet. \\n\\nFlat screens play sports, while the music runs the gammut from 80's rock and punk to early hip hop. And no it's not because there's a jukebox (thumbs down).

I was asked for a name for our sandwich order,  and 20 minutes later, we inquired about our food.  Apparently, the person who took the order wrote down a completely different name than what I had given her.  So when they called out for \\"Verna\\" which is not even close to my name, no one responded.  Once the mystery was finally solved, we had to wait an additional 7 mins for our food because \\"it had gotten cold.\\" \\n\\nWhen we got our sandwiches, the chicken in my chicken pesto sandwich was straight-from-the-fridge cold, as I am sure it was intended to be (but I would have preferred it heated), and bland...definitely needed some salt.  The pesto spread was delicious though, and the bread was superb.  \\n\\nI asked my husband of anything in his turkey club was heated since I was now a little confused about the comment we received about it being cold and the extra little wait we had because of it.  Sure enough, no warm components that he could point to.  Possibly the bacon? The bread was toasted, but no longer warm. He had no complaints about the taste though and happily ate his sandwich. \\n\\nWe also shared some potato salad.

The menu looked like typical pub fare which we typically would enjoy.  The problem was the music was so loud, it was impossible to have a conversation and this was at 6:30pm.  I am not even talking slightly loud, I'm talking booming.  I looked around and the majority of the people there were couples 40's and up.  I saw a few younger people as well.  I feel like a sports bar is a great place for conversation and to watch sports not for extremely loud club like music.

I actually had to ask the bartender to repeat herself when she said they only served cordials since it was so loud.

We were originally going to get the Fiori di Zucca appetizer, though unfortunately they were out; the Stuffed Jerusalem Artichoke was a fantastic substitute for this. The stuffed artichoke- stuffed with goat cheese, wrapped in a fine prosciutto- came out deliciously. Even the bread they delivered with the meal was amazing.\\n\\nMy husband had some lobster pasta that was on special (though that didn't stop me from getting a taste!), but I had the Pappardelle con ragu di Cinghiale- wild boar ragout over pasta. The meat was succulent, the pasta was thick and hearty, and the dish certainly filled me up. I don't know how they seasoned the boar, but it was tasty, the meat was tender, and I had no problem devouring the dish- though it didn't leave much room for dessert.\\n\\nThe portions? Filling and delicious. The service? Great- they didn't let my martini glass get empty before offering me another. The price is definitely higher here than your neighborhood Italian joint (and I think the three dollar signs on yelp is right- this is something that you need to be ready to spend for), but I don't regret spending what we did for the food.

Based on his suggestion of 2-3 tapas per person, we met in the middle and ordered 5:\\n\\n-Crispy calamari: (5/5) I really liked this dish, it was perfectly done. The calamari was tender, yet cooked all the way without the extra chewiness.\\n\\n-Fish plancha (2/5): I understand that this is a tapas place, but you should stay away from this dish as it is itty, bitty, tiny and not in a cute way. It was one of the smallest fillets I have ever seen, been served and eaten in about 3 bites. Save yourself the $9.50 and go ahead and order the whole fish instead, you will be happier.\\n\\n-Piquillo Peppers (4/5): I have to admit, I was not looking forward to this because of it was peppers and everyone's spicy level is different. However, these peppers are not spicy at all and are stuffed with goat cheese, thanks for our server for recommending them!\\n\\n- gamabas (3/5) shrimp in a garlic sauce. Although I love shrimp, the portion did not match the price tag of $9.50 as the shrimp was flavorful, but very tiny.\\n\\n-Albondigas (5/5) these were amazing little meatballs with veal, beef and pork in a zesty tomato sauce. Get them, they are good!\\n\\n- Caponata (4.5/5) a purried eggplant dish that was really flavorful. I love how eggplant, when done right, is almost \\"meaty\\" and they did this right here. It definitely showed some Moorish influences with the spices. However, it is served at room temp and would have been better served hot.\\n\\nDuring our meal, the restaurant went from quiet to extremely LOUD once full.

(TBH, I suggested it because I wanted to try it myself! xP)\\nWe waited a little less than an hour for a table of 3 on the Friday after July 4th, which fell on a Thursday this year. (We had been told that we'd have to wait longer but there was a party of 9 in front of us, and the restaurant decided to seat us first.)\\nAnyway, our party of 3 decided to get the mussels with linguine with the giacomo sauce  and the house special for two with the Fra-something I think (forgot the name, but it's the one with a mix of giacomo sauce and one with a spicy edge). The special comes with a bottle of any of the $17 wine. We got the Savignon Blanc and it was refreshing but not the best white wine I've ever tried or anything. The mussel dish came out first (we were sharing everything, although we never told our server Donna that) and while it had great flavor, we thought the linguine was undercooked. I'm not talking al dente, I'm talking borderline crunchy/hard to chew. OK you're busy, but you're an Italian restaurant. you CANNOT mess up pasta. Why couldn't you spare another minute or two? The special arrived at our table about 10 minutes later, and WOW it was an impressive looking platter! (Not plate- it's a HUGE PLATTER of pasta.) It was topped with all kind of seafood (clams, mussels, TWO LOBSTERS, squid, etc) But like the first dish, this one tasted rushed also. The wine in the sauce had yet to evaporate, and the pasta here was also a little too al dente, though not as undercooked as the first dish. we all agreed that it tasted better about 15 minutes after it arrived at our table, when the pasta had cooked in the sauce and the alcohol had dissipated.\\nOh, the complimentary bread and olive oil is completely unremarkable. Kind of disappointing.\\nFor our party of 3, the bill came out to about $100 after tax and tip. Very delicious, but the wait and dining environment leaves much for improvement. I understand the reason to rush your patrons when there is a line of potential customers outside, but if we're sitting down and paying for the food we're hopefully enjoying, it wouldn't hurt to let us relax and enjoy it. Don't get me wrong, the food was amazing, but I just don't know if it's worth waiting forever on a scorching summer evening, sitting in a crowded/non-air conditioned dining room, being served hurriedly-prepared (though flavorful) food, and feeling rushed by the wait staff.  \\n\\nCASH ONLY.

THis would not be the place to wear heels because the parking lot is not paved well.  \\n\\nLet's talk about the food: I had the all you can eat BBQ for about $20! That's a steal for darn good BBQ food. The beef brisket was amazing and I asked to get the side cut where it's a bit burnt and toasty. Brisket would be my favorite. FYI - i also ordered the brisket to go at the Austin airport. It's not the same.... It's more dry and lean.  It was tender, bit of a fat,  flavorful with that smoky taste, and juicy! The sausage was bit sweet and flavorful. The rib was good and fall off the bone. It's BYOB, therefore bring in your alcoholic sweet tea and buy a homemade lemonade there. MIX it and eat more food!!  We also ordered a half tray of peach cobbler for the next day. We reheated and it was still good. The crust pie was soft and the peach was generous. It wasnt too sweet.

It was the year that DVD players became commercially available for a mere $1000, Celine Dion won album of the year, and SOHO opened its doors in the Vinings Jubilee complex as a neighborhood gathering spot, a place to go for a great meal and a good time.  Today, DVD players have changed to a Blu-Ray format, Mumford & Sons won this years album of the year, and SOHO has remained true to form for the past 16 years as the \\"Cheers of Vinings\\" where the staff and patrons are on first name basis basking in the moment.  Named after the artsy SoHo District in New York City, owners Frank and Susan Smith have brought that New York-like classy, hip flair to their highly popular restaurant where newcomers are quickly treated as regulars. The cornerstone of SOHO is its outstanding Pan Asian-Nouveau American menu that is managed by the multi-talented Executive Chef Joe Ahn. As an equal to the food is the instant gratification from SOHO's welcoming hospitality, and if I didn't know better I would have thought its name was derived from Southern Hospitality.  \\n\\nOne of the noticeable features at SOHO is its display of high quality local art that's scattered throughout the restaurant, as well as its outstanding wine program.  Each week an offering is assembled highlighting three distinctive wines from various vinicultural regions or varietals creating a theme to explore as a flight or individually with savory tapas designed to complement their unique characteristics.  What a way to expand ones knowledge and appreciation of wines that might otherwise be overlooked. In addition to the wines of the weeks, the Smith's have put together a \\"spot on\\" wine list where value meets quality head-on.  If something other than wine is needed to soften the day's edge, there's an assortment of titillating libations to choose from.  The one cocktail that I found that can easily transport the mind to some sunny beach is the Bahama Holiday- Malibu Banana Rum, Canton Ginger liqueur, fresh coconut juice, lime and a pinch of cardamom- this is a destination get-away in a glass. \\n\\nWhen a dish is listed on the menu for 16 years, I guess you consider it a house favorite.  One of these \\"don't you dare remove it from the menu\\" is the Chicken Tortilla Soup; yes a soup. No matter if you feel a bit sluggish from a cold or simply want something warm and comforting, Chef Ahn's recipe is packed full of vigor and umami with chucks of shredded chicken in a rich homemade chicken stock that's loaded with crisp tortilla chips, sweet corn, spicy chili peppers, zesty cilantro and tangy limes.  If this doesn't liven up the palate then the General Joey's Calamari surely will.  This is a throwback to the days when Chef Ahn worked in his family's eatery, Fuji-Ya in Gettysburg, PA. Tender morsels of squid are flash fired then tossed is an exhilarating ginger- soy glaze with diced Serrano pepper, garlic, and scallions - yum.  Equally as savory as the calamari is the Wagyu Beef Carpaccio. The paper thin slices of eye of the round are drizzled with a housemade creamy Dijon sauce that adds an enticing tingle to this ultra tender melt in the mouth meat.  It's topped with field greens, shaved asiago cheese, shallots and capers that are fried, and a wedge of toasted Parmesan bread.  This is a meat lover's dream come true.\\n\\nAs with the starters, there are several time-honored entrees that should not to be missed at least in this lifetime. One of these masterfully prepared dishes is the Chilean Sea Bass that has been seared to perfection that has a slight crisp coating that opens to pure lushness with its moist buttery texture.  The lemongrass beurre blanc, ginger, and shallots gives this fish a thrilling taste and is served over a mound of forbidden rice with a side of saut√©ed baby bok choy. If your carnivore instincts need satisfying then either the Beef Short Ribs or the Elk Tenderloin will do the trick.  The boneless Painted Hills short ribs are slow-cooked for 6 hours in a burgundy based braising and served with horseradish mashed potatoes and saut√©ed spinach.  Whereas, the grilled New Zealand Elk Tenderloin is an explosion of rich exotic flavors without any gaminess and is dressed with a raspberry and Dijon marinade with a side of sweet potato gratin and haricot verts.  These offerings re-define comfort, as they are absolutely stunning.  \\n\\nLeave a touch of space in the appetite to complete the culinary tour of Chef Joey's kitchen for the warm decadent Chocolate Bread Pudding that's drizzled with a duo of rich caramel sauces and scoop of old-fashioned vanilla ice cream - it's an instant ticket to sweet dreams.  For over 16 years, SOHO has served creative foods and lively libations, and is still the place to go when in Vinings for a good time with friends or soon to be friends and who knows you just might meet your next BFF there.  Enjoy!!!"},{"name":"Giacomo's Ristorante - Boston","address":"355 Hanover St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"This place is overrated.

We arrived just after 7 and found a fairly long line of hungry patrons waiting to get inside the door. We were a group of five, no need to check in just get in line and wait. We chatted up with some of the others waiting in the cold (and it was cold!), and this helped pass the time. After a bit the hostess came out and and pointed asking \\"how many\\" and then disappeared back inside the restaurant. We figured we would be in line for at least an hour, but the line moved quickly and we were seated within 30 minutes.\\n\\nThe menu is basic, nothing fancy but perfect for what we were looking for. Your server will explain the menu as some of the pasta dishes come with your choice of three house made sauces. We needed some time and ordered a few appetizers.\\n\\n1. Deep fried mozzarella. This is not your TGI Friday's version. This is actually pretty well executed. The cheese is fried to perfection and tastes phenomenal. The red sauce is mind blowing and was so good we kept it for dipping later.\\n\\n2. Garlic bread. Sounds boring right? It wasn't. It's garlic bread done right, with a slight burnt edge and just the right amount of butter to garlic ratio. ORDER IT!\\n\\n3. Fried calamari. Not my thing, but everyone else at the table seemed to enjoy it.\\n\\nFor my entree, I went with the gnocchi special which was served in a red sauce, along with pancetta and a few other things that for the moment is slipping my mind. I am a fan of al dente pasta and was happy that this Giacomo's is too.

We ordered very quickly because we'd been able to survey the menu in advance. We ordered a round of drinks, appetizers and entrees. 20 minutes passed and my entree came, which was the Fuji Apple salad. After another 15 minutes, my parties' entree arrived. The drinks never came nor our appetizers and our server had not been back. My friend had ordered the Kung Pao lollipops and we were all eager to try them. The server brought her 6 chicken wings. He told her, they had run out. They never forewarned us they would be subbing the signature dish or we would have chosen another option. Very disappointing. At this point we were 1 hr in with no drinks or apps, so we cancelled our drinks and apps. The waitress finally returned and we shared our experience. She made no accomodations, just apologized.

Even the bread was plain white bread, not even warm.  I had a salad which was drowned in oil.  Followed by the \\"pan seared\\" veal, which did not seam to be pan seared at all and was also drowned in a brown sauce.  It tasted ok. My wife had the swordfish, which was a large, thin piece slightly over cooked.  My wife's friend had the risotto which she loved and her husband also had the veal.  My daughter had the brick oven pizza. She liked it, I had a piece because it looked so good, but it was also lacking flavor. The crust was good but the sauce had no taste and there was hardly any cheese on it.\\n\\nWe also ordered the sangria, which guess what? Also lacked flavor and was served in a plastic pitcher. For $36 I was expecting something much better.\\n\\nThe service was great, especially the bus boys. They were on top of everything. Our waitress was very friendly and attentive as well.\\n\\nThe total bill for 4 adults and two kids was $260( beware they added the tip in and we almost double tipped) this seamed like a lot considering we had no apps, no desert or coffee. \\n\\nIf it were half as expensive I would have thought it was decent, but considering the price and overall lack of flavor, it was disappointing."},{"name":"The Salt Lick BBQ","address":"18300 Fm 1826","city":"Driftwood","stars":"4","text":"This place is awesome and we had the all you can eat selection.

I feel like if I would've been able to pick two cheeses and 2 meats to creat my own board I would've thought it was amazing however limited to the selections they have makes it more difficult.  I did try everything on the board and either my thought was this is just ok or this is amazing but nothing was bad.  I would definitely come back to try one of the other boards with a couple other things that I might like on them but it is rather annoying that it is limiting.

By the time I hit up Salt Lick these BBQ virgin lips had already sampled Louie Mueller's brisket and sausages and there was just no comparison.\\n\\nIs Salt Lick located in the boonies?  Yes, but it's closer than Taylor or Lockhart where the other BBQ big hitters are located.  There's also several wineries close by and small shops to check out so you could really turn it into a delightful Saturday adventure.

Even with just the two of us, we ended up waiting a good 20-30 minutes for a table on Saturday night.  But it didn't seem to matter.  There was a live band playing in a huge open courtyard area with picnic tables and seats scattered throughout.  It sorta felt like the wait outside in the courtyard while listening to music with friends was really the main draw of the place.\\n\\nThe BBQ, while good, is most definitely not on the same playing field as the other BBQ giants like Kreutz or Smitty's just to name a few.  My dining companion and I both ordered the combo platter which came with sausage, brisket, beans, and cole slaw I think.  Honestly, the brisket was average.  I was a bit disappointed after all the hype and after having tried Louie Mueller's for lunch just a few hours before.  Like I said, the food is the supporting cast here.  It's the BYOB (bring a chest full of beer) environment hanging out with your friends that's the real draw to this place.

It was cooked perfectly. However, the vegetable ratio in the dish seemed off. All I could really taste was corn. \\n\\nThe chili verde a la baabs was delicious. The pork was tender and the green tomatillo sauce was delectable. It added a nice flavor to the pork and kept it tender. It came with 2 sides. I asked for rice and elote but i got beans and elote. The elote was on point. It wasn't too charred, nor was it too salty with an overabundance of salt and butter like you see with other elotes. This place had great charred corn.

The peanut butter cookie is the best PB cookie you'll ever eat, and the dark chocolate pudding made me roll my eyes several times because it was ridiculous how good it was.

A couple of minutes later, Janice returned with my draft beer and took my order. \\n\\nI ordered the pork sandwich and was offered a choice of fries or greens or a little of both (which is what I opted for). The sandwich was fantastic. Messy but flavorful and full of tang from the banana peppers. Janice checked on me shortly after I received my food and again when my beverage was low. As soon as I pushed the plate away from me, she came by to collect the dish and offer me coffee and/or dessert. I opted for the coffee, which was pretty darn good (and if you think that's no big deal, you probably don't drink as much coffee as I do).\\n\\nTotal bill for the sandwich, 2 beers and coffee (with tip) was $26.00. Not bad as far as I'm concerned.\\n\\nIf there was one thing that I didn't like, it's that the tables have that sticky feel to them that happens after many years of use. It's not a deal breaker, but worth noting."},{"name":"Starbucks","address":"165 Newbury St","city":"Boston","stars":"2.5","text":"I have become a regular here when I work on Clarendon St. twice a week, and I tend to see the same one barista often - her name is Rachel and she's so sweet.

Once we saw the size of the place and the efficiency of the staff, you understand why you get seated quickly. Our serve was knowledgeable, friendly and quick. Had our drinks and took our order within 10 minutes. The Wife had the Marino's Triple Chopped Sandwich plate that had chopped brisket, pork rib and sausage all mixed together for a very flavorful sandwich. I really liked that they also chopped in some dill pickles, a BBQ staple in Texas. All dishes come with potato salad, coleslaw, beans and bread. More on them later.\\nI had the Truman's Plate which puts brisket, sausage and pork ribs on the plate with the aforementioned sides. The rib was tender, competition tender, and tasted perfect. Smoke, rub and the meat flavor mixed together formed a wonderful taste. The brisket was offered to me as lean, moist or burnt ends, your choice. I always take the fatty (moist) side and this was no different. Tender, meaty and slight smoke, just the way I like it. The sausage was really good, a special grind that I really liked both in seasoning and mouth feel. Now the sides; the cole slaw was a savory, lightly tart, offering that is hands down the best coleslaw I've ever had. The potato salad was a non-traditional style with little mayonnaise and a smoky flavor. I liked it very much. The beans looked like standard fare but bouy was I worng. There was a flavor we couldn't place until I had about three bites. \\"Peach\\" I spouted out and the Wife immediately agreed. What a nuanced flavor for a dish like this. Overall, the meat is on par with some of the best BBQ joints in Texas. The sides are a step above and the servers and service are top notch.

Anyway, here's my take: 3.5 is fair, yelp doesn't do half stars...so 3 it is.\\n\\nService: 3. We walk in without a reservation at 5:02 (opens at 5:00) and the server says, \\"sorry, we can only seat you at the table in front of the door since you don't have one.\\" Who punishes someone for not having a reservation when the restaurant is only half full? So we took the table even though it was windy and inconvenient, but wasn't too pleased with the server. Nonetheless, the service for the rest of the night was pretty on-point. \\n\\nFood: 4. Noodles were very al dente for all dishes. The bf had linguine alle vongole and I had the raviolone aperto. The below reviews for small portions were correct, but they weren't so small that it was unsatisfying. I was quite full after the raviolone aperto simply because it was so rich, which it came with 2 well sized scallops and 2 giant shrimp. The linguine had a more generous portion with about 10 clams, but the sauce was weak so if you're going for flavor, raviolone is the way to go. Lastly, the lobster fritters - they weren't too oily and had a quite a bit of lobster in each fritter ($18 for 4). However, it was coated with this sweet sauce that kind of tainted the freshness of the lobster so use sparingly. \\n\\nAtmosphere: 4. Romantic. Small, intimate, good for conversation. \\n\\nPrice: 3. Expensive. Appetizer + 2 meals would have been $70 if not for the groupon, so probably wouldn't come back again for full price."},{"name":"Double Comfort Restaurant","address":"505 N High St","city":"Columbus","stars":"3.5","text":"Lucky us, we came on a night when they were having a double bachelor/ette party.  We tried hard to ignore it even though we had to scream at each other to be heard but we don't hold that against the restaurant.\\n\\nI'll start with the positives.  The staff is really nice which can be half the issue these days. \\n\\nNow that that's out of the way...\\n\\nPeople's reviews of how tasteless the chicken was kind of scared me off from committing to a chicken dinner so the hubs got an extra piece on his dinner for me to try.  I got the King...a peanut butter, marshmallow and banana sandwich with bacon.  My friend got a chicken po' boy.  Service from the kitchen was slow but I don't know if that's a normal thing or because of the size of the party already there.  I'll assume (hope for) the latter.  But as long as it's hot, I don't mind a bit of a wait.  My biggest irritation and deterrent from ordering a chicken dinner was you were forced into the sides they wanted to give you and not all of the sides available.  Like you can only get French fries, sweet potato fries, mashed potatoes, greens (no thanks), cole slaw (no thanks).  So basically if you don't like greens or slaw, you're forced into a potato overload.  But, what if I want mac and cheese?  Nope, you're going to have to pay $6 for that and when we asked how big it was given the price we were told it was a \\"soup bowl size\\" more than enough to share for two, maybe three.  \\n\\nUhh...your idea of a soup bowl and mine are different, miss.  It was on the small side and the oil was still sizzling and popping off the top.  Yes, I said oil.  This is not your creamy kind of mac and cheese, this is that southern, I dumped cheese in noodles and have been simmering in oil kind of mac and cheese.  Half of it went back to the kitchen at the end of the meal.  The taste was so so but we just couldn't handle that much oil.  His chicken was decent.  I thought the seasoning was fine and I'm a season snob so I don't know what people who are griping about the seasoning are used to or expect.  Now the quality of the actual chicken just wasn't what I'm used to.  Didn't seem as plentiful as the other two popular chicken joints in town and you know the ones I'm referring to.\\n\\nWhat about my King?  Well, the bread was so hard on it, I literally played a drum solo on it with my utensils.  I asked if it was deep fried but even deep fried leaves the bread soft in the middle.  This was ROCK hard.  The bacon, which should've given a nice salty contrast to the sweetness of the mallow and banana just tasty like nothing really.  It was just a tough to eat, jerky like texture.  If I hadn't paid $9 for a sandwich alone, I would've headed back to grab a slice of Fabians I passed but I took one for the team.   It's a fork and knifer because if you try to eat it like a sandwich, it all oozes out everywhere and not in a good way.  My friend seems satisfied with her sandwich but she's one of those people who won't say nary an ill word no matter how bad the meal so even \\"decent\\" is built up to \\"excellent\\" if you ask her.  But she can write her own review if she's so inclined.  \\n\\nThe hubby and I wanted to love it and even though he liked his well enough, he said he definitely has about 3 other places he'd go for chicken before here.  If they allow you to choose ANY side they offer in the future, I might think of going back but until then, we'll probably pass it up."},{"name":"Pio Pio Restaurant","address":"5803 Precision Dr","city":"Orlando","stars":"4.5","text":"We stopped by here for dinner on a weekend and we had an amazing time!

This will be our third time eating here since 2011. We figured that the line was indicative of how great this place was; and the last couple of times that we were here, the food lived up to the Yelp hype and overall rating of 4 stars. Yes, there was a 30-60 minute wait depending on the arrival time, but once inside, it was a memorable experience. Their specials are fantastic. Each time that we are there, we comment on how good of a business this is: long lines, cash only, reasonable prices, and great food with huge portions. So why the 2 stars? \\n\\nIt was a Thursday night, we arrived at 5:30 and had to wait about an hour to finally get inside. This is a small place. The 4 of us sat at a table that was crammed in a corner right in front of the entrance. Luckily, our wives don't take up too much space so it worked out ok. We ordered 2 apps, 2 specials, and one chicken parm. Within 10 minutes we had all of the food on our table and were finished with dinner within 25 minutes. There is no dessert at this place so, that's it, you are done. Sure, you can sit and talk with you dinner guests, but unless you are ok with the death stares from hungry customers waiting in line and wait staff that is eager to flip your table, then it is in your best interest to leave. \\n\\nThe servers do not hide the fact that they want to rush you out. I even overheard a server annoyingly bark orders at customers coming in that sat inadvertently at the incorrect table: \\"We have to fit as many people in here as we can.\\"  You have to be on your \\"A\\" game when you get in here. Sounds like a relaxing time, right? ...Nah. \\n\\nThis is not a place that you take friends and family to relax and socialize over dinner. You will be waiting in line probably twice as long as it will take you to have dinner. Sorry, but no food is that good to justify rushed, almost non-existent service. I'm sure they are not bothered by this because there are a ton of people waiting to come in. It's almost like a Seinfeld episode; wait in line, read the menu though the window, have your order ready when you squeeze into a table, shut up, eat as fast as you can, throw your cash down and get out. If you don't like it, NO PASTA FOR YOU!\\n\\nIf you are looking for a place to sit and have a normal, relaxing dining experience with friends and family, look elsewhere.

Better red wine by the glass - selection was very limited. \\n2 Price point of $17 for a small pizza feels a bit steep. I can afford it, but I've never paid $100 for 4 people to eat pizza. \\n\\nI highly recommend the restaurant- cannot wait to go back. At that price point, I might consider other places first, however\\n\\nI do wonder what will happen when Chuckie pies opens across the street.

My first impression was that this place is LOUD - the music is turned way up and diners have to raise their voices to be heard.  We asked to sit outside, assuming it would be quieter out there, but we were wrong.  I feel like a grumpy old woman when I complain about noise levels at a restaurant, but this place was really unnecessarily noisy.  Our server was great and was able to offer useful suggestions.  Everything we ordered was brought out promptly and our server was good about checking in frequently and chatting with us without being overbearing.  We started with the lamb empanadas which were the highlight of our meal.  There was a good amount of lamb in the empanadas and the smoky dipping sauce was a good match.  We enjoyed the salsa but had to pick through our chips because we kept finding soggy (literally soaking wet) chips throughout the basket.  I ordered sopes with carne asada (a daily special) and was fairly underwhelmed.  The meat itself was absolutely delicious, but the sopes were tremendously bland and the flavor of the meat was lost in the flavorless masa and under-seasoned refried beans.  I ended up picking out the meat and eating it alone which worked out just fine for me.  The husband had the enchiladas of the day (chicken and cheese) and enjoyed them.  I tried a bite and thought they were good, even though they were absolutely loaded with cheese.  We tried the house margarita (good but not strong enough for me), the michele margarita (holy booze! this was my favorite drink), and the jalapeno margarita (daily drink special - husband loooooved, I hated and still have nightmares about).  Based on the prices of the individual drinks, we would have been better off ordering a pitcher of the house margarita but liked getting to try a few different things.  It's unlikely that I would return just because there are plenty of other places in town to get \\"Mexican\\" food at much lower prices."},{"name":"Surly Girl Saloon","address":"1126 N High St","city":"Columbus","stars":"4","text":"Surly Girl is one of those places that you hear about and hear about, and then it beats your expectations.

His suggestion (and my intuition) was spot on- best meatloaf I've ever had and my grandma makes a doozy!\\n\\nThe real treat for me, though, was the cornbread stuffing on the side. I think I had a mystical experience when I first tasted it. There was definitely a very strong light and a choir of what may have been angels. If the only way for me to taste that cornbread stuffing again would be to order it as a last meal, I'd start committing crimes now just to get on death row. Luckily I won't have to resort to such unthinkable acts- I can just keep coming back. \\n\\nDespite being already full of beer, RC Cola (!!) and lunch, I managed to eat a cupcake at the end of it all. I think it was cayenne chocolate- at any rate it was spicy and chocolaty and effing delicious.\\n\\nOur server wanted us to know that the place really gets going at night, and listed some themed nights that they host.

Yearning for a time of gun slingers, and saloons, dust and tumbleweed when America was in its age of prepubescence, no longer a colony and not yet a global empire, only beginning to take its first steps into the unknown vis a vis the Oregon Trail (and its damned, perilous fording, river-crossing oxen).\\n\\nThe images of adventure, cowboys, and great steaks are forever intertwined in the American psyche.\\n\\n\\nYes, Longhorn is a chain but it is a locally owned chain? and the steaks here are pretty good comparably. This Longhorn Steakhouse, one of many owned by the Darden Restaurant group, has pretty good consistent service and the owner/manager often walks around to check up on you as you dine.\\n\\nOn this occasion, we are celebrating a family member's birthday. (Shout out: If you need a birthday gift, I recommend the Unique Image stall at the Florida Mall where they do engravings and dogtags etc. for pretty cheap ).\\n\\nThe birthday girl orders the 7oz. Flo's Filet and Lobster Tail. The filet was good but the lobster tail, as things are sometimes at chains, overseasoned and way too salty. You would hope for the price that you pay it would be perfect.\\n\\nMy cousin orders the healthy Longhorn Salmon on a bed of seasoned rice.\\n\\nFor my entree, I opt to share a outlaw ribeye steak with my cousin Kevin. It is a considerably large and savory 18 oz. cut of USDA prime ribeye, seasoned and cooked to order medium rare. The steak is tender and moist, with a dab of melted butter on top, flavorful from the grill and seasonings and fattiness of the cut.\\n\\nOverall, Longhorn Steakhouse is a pretty good, though sometimes inconsistent, better-than-Outback, steakhouse for dinner.

The food was AMAZING.  We started out with the fried calamari--they weren't overdone which is a huge plus!  The calamari had a nice, light breading, and came with a side of mixed greens/tomatoes seasoned with olive oil, lemon, salt, and pepper.  An interesting, but workable combination, and a nice substitue for the traditional marinara sauce.\\n\\n  I got the chicken parm special (I was very excited) for dinner, and it was perfect--the chicken was cooked nicely, and the accompanying red sauce had the right amount of seasoning.  HUGE serving, however!!  One friend got the gnocci, which I will be getting next time I go.  A rich, hearty dish.  Another friend got the fussili tossed with roasted vegetables, and topped with goat cheese.

At first, I was fairly impressed. Neat location, ample seating, and a wonderful pastry selection that reminded me of caf√©s in European countries.\\n\\nThen I tried the coffee.\\n\\nThis is where any affection I may have previously had for Mozart's was killed. Every time that I've gone back, I've never been able to get a good cup of coffee. It's honestly hard to tell what makes these drinks so terrible, because the baristas are inadequately trained to deliver a good drink. Espresso shots are often left too long in an empty mug, allowing the crema to break and the drink to be ruined before the milk is even poured. And even if the crema DOES hold, the milk is poured hastily and clumsily and the drink is ruined either way. Also, the milk I've had in my drinks has been poorly steamed. Lots of large air bubbles or excessive foam, no matter the drink. I'm beginning to think that there is no difference between a latte or a cappuccino at this place (and I don't even want to start on a macchiato...). \\n\\nI haven't had much interaction with the staff, but they have never been incredibly inviting or warm. I'd like to spend more time talking to them to see if this is just me or if they truly are as cold and short as they appear on first impressions.\\n\\nTo top it off, the drink prices are about a dollar more than any other shop in town, and the entire shop always smells of chemicals and cleaning supplies. I'm not sure if this is some product used behind the counter, or if it's something used in the seating area, but it's very noticeable and very irritating.\\n\\nI'd go somewhere else for your coffee in Austin. Anywhere really. You'll most likely get a better drink at any other shop in town.

The sandwiches are also tasty and big, good for two people.  I was  also surprised that they use banana ketchup, the one we also use in the Philippines, even the same brand, jufran.\\nThe drinks are also something. Ironbeer, which I mentioned earlier, is actually Cuba's national cola (according to the can). The Malta Hatuey is a cereal drink and goes well with condensed milk. My wife's favorite drink is the pi√±osa, a mix of pineapple juice and champagne. They give you a glass of the juice and a small bottle of the bubbly and then you pour it in, you can also ask for more juice. The cafe jerez is also another of my favorite, coffee and alcohol, what else could be better?\\nLet's also not forget the dessert. They have a lot of pastries; mango cakes, tarts, tres leches, and mi favorito, the cuban cigar.

Giacomo's fried calamari with spicy peppers is fantastic.  The showstopper, however, is the lobster fusili special with \\"Fracomo's\\" sauce.  My favorite is to have them mix the Fra Diavolo and the Giacomo's sauces, which they call the Fracomo's sauce - a creamy, slightly spicy red sauce that is to die for.\\n\\nThe prices are pretty fantastic at $15-25 per entree.

I was surprised for our 5th wedding anniversary with dinner at Straits. At first glance, I had no idea where we were, but it only took a little reminder and a name-drop (Ludacris) to refresh my memory. We had seen a food show where Straits was featured and admittedly, I do have a tiny crush on Ludacris, but more than that, I have mad love for foods of all kinds. Having never experienced Singaporean cuisine, we were both looking forward to the experience. We'll start with the positive. The architecture is very unique and appealing, with an industrial feel. There was no wait to be seated and the place looked fairly empty for a Saturday evening. There was some noise upstairs due to some child fashion show that was being held, but it wasn't intrusive to the dining area. The view outside was dreary because it was raining, but that's no fault of Straits. Our server came over and while she was very pleasant and hospitable, she seemed nervous the entire time. She had a few suggestions, but overall seemed awkward about the menu in general. We looked over the menu and noticed that the prices were not too low or too high, but definitely pricier than we were comfortable with at the end of our meal. We found the plates to be quite small, in particular, their famous appetizer plate that had a variety of bites, but we felt fell flat for the hefty price. We received our entrees which were also a bit on the small side for the price point, but more importantly, there really was nothing that stood out to either myself or my husband. We felt like some of our favorite dishes at The Cheesecake Factory were richer in flavor and substance than at Straits. It was very sad for me because 5 years is a really special \\"first milestone\\" in a marriage, and my lackluster dinner and obvious disappointment was a let-down for my husband. After all, in 10 years together, he has only ever truly surprised me twice with dinner reservations and the first was amazing. I'm sorry Straits.

I tried putting peanut sauce in it but that tomato flavor and the over cooked noodles just couldn't be overcome. \\n\\nWe tasted the drunken noodles and it was the same: mushy noodles, over cooked vegetables and what tasted like tomato sauce! We sent it back virtually untouched. \\n\\nAfter reading all the reviews l saw quite a few reviews that indicated the same thing about the noodle dishes and the pad Thai in particular. I've eaten a lot of Pad Thai and hate to say it, this was the worst I've ever had but I never liked my mother's rendition of ketchup on pasta either. I don't know why or how they got their noodles to take on this flavor but it's not at all what Thai noodles should taste like.\\n\\nI was very impressed by the staff being nice and refunding my money. I hate spending my hard earned cash on going out to eat and not enjoying it so this made up for that aspect but the only thing I can heartily recommend are the crispy parcels and Buddha golden bags so if l was going to get anything again to give them business that is what I would get. \\n\\nSo 1 Star for the appetizers and 1 for the service. I do appreciate when people stand behind what they offer.\\n\\nWhat I don't understand is how so many people love this place and it's the \\"best\\" in Boulder and on the other side you have people who feel the same as l do but I haven't eaten in any other Thai restaurants in Boulder."},{"name":"Falafel King","address":"48 Winter St, Ste 1","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"I got the Lamb Falafel platter.

The slaw did just what you'd want it to do.  It gave it a nice crunch and a little bit of heat at the end.  Surprisingly, probably my second fave thing to eat there.\\n\\nTried the new \\"BLT Burger\\" yesterday.  It certainly is a TALL burger.  The bacon jam is not what I expected, or really what I wanted it to be.  It reminded me more of a layer of chopped beef in a regular hickory sauce.  I guess I'm just a bacon purist, and would rather just have crispy strips on top of a burger, and one of Yum√©'s sauces to accompany it.\\n\\nI even skipped the fries yesterday.  I wish they were more crispy (I even asked once).  I do like the sesame salt, and am a sucker for the wasabi mayo.  But sometimes the big burgers are enough.\\n\\nThe Yum√© Dog is actually my favorite to date.  Maybe it's because I had it at the end of a night with some awesome new friends at Amy D.'s UYE at the Draught House.  Maybe it's because this food goes so much better with beer!

No complaints about their food.  \\n\\nI'm always baffled by the staff here, because although there's so many of them -- seriously, SO many of them behind the counter all the time, their service is consistently slow.  Especially today, after we were seated by the window, we didn't get a waiter until a few minutes later...which was fine.  After he took our orders, that was the last time we saw him during our entire meal.  He wasn't even the one to bring us our food.  Didn't come to refill our water.  Didn't ask how our meal was.

I am gluten free and thought that a seafood restaurant would be a safe choice.  I am usually safe if they have a chef who can alter items to be gluten free (it really is easy to do).  \\n\\nWe arrive and are seated as we had a reservation and were on time.  It takes a while for our server to come over.  Since we always have to ask questions about the menu (sauces, preparation etc.), we cannot really look at the menu without assistance first.  She approached us as if we were in a bar and grill...pretty casual and overly friendly.  She seemed irritated that we did not order wine (I could not drink it at the time and my husband was kind enough to abstain).  She left without offering us the specials of the evening, soup of the day, etc.  Waited a long time for her to come back.  When we began asking her questions about the menu and stressed that I needed to have gluten free items (also not hard with grilled items, veggies, etc.) she was clueless.  She didn't know what gluten free was at all.  She went to ask someone about the menu and came back a long time after she left and basically had no help. She also suggested a couple of pasta dishes that she liked and some other items that were very gluten laden by description (breaded, came with bread, floured and fried, etc.).  She also was kind enough to bring us bread...my husband was glad of it since we could tell that it was going to be a long night.  So, I simply used my knowledge and asked for the pecan crusted grilled trout and veggies.  I specified that if the crusting had any crackers, flour, bread, etc. that they just were to leave it off and grill it plain.  \\n\\nThe fish came out breaded...it was easy to tell that there were more bread crumbs than pecans in this mixture.  The veggies had a sauce on them that I bet was thickened with flour.  I waited for our waitress...again a LONG wait.  I told my husband to eat because there was no use in both of us being hungry.  She finally came and did not notice that mine was untouched.  I told her that this needed to go back and why...she again seemed puzzled and clueless.  She left with the plate and then came back with someone from the management staff or kitchen....I had to tell them how to prepare it.  Yes it can have oil.  Yes on seasoning.  Yes on grilling.  Yes on veggies.  No on breading.  No on flouring.  No on sauces with unknown ingredients.  So after a long wait and much worry, a large piece of grilled fish and potatoes came out.  The potatoes worried me as they looked coated, but they assured me they were simply oven roasted.  The fish was blah.  I grill fish all the time at home and have no idea how you make a grilled fish taste like nothing at all?  Anyway, my hubby and I ate at different times so that was not fun.  The waitress was an idiot.  The management staff seemed to be mildly interested, but not very well in the know about gluten.  The length of time we were here was not a problem, because fine dining usually takes a while.....however this was not fine dining in quality of food, ambience or service.  \\n\\nWe could not wait to leave.  They did process the payment very quickly..the only thing our server did well.  We tipped.  We will never go back.  It was awful.  A visit to Chipotle would have been better.

So Saturday Brunch at Daedalus: girls morning out.\\n\\nDoing my research on the menu beforehand, I was set on the not-your-average eggs benedict with avocado and smoked salmon.  Upon entering, we were taken to the rooftop, which was nearly empty.   Because I read that Daedalus tends to over poach their eggs, I emphasized this to the waiter: I hate overdone eggs.  But when one has a track record of doing something--if one is sometimes iffy--there's a high probability that the future will reflect the past.  Alas, while one egg was perfect, the other was completely cooked in that the yolk was solid.  Sooo disappointed.  If you can't understand the art of poaching eggs, how can I trust anything else? \\n\\nThe salmon was so fresh and thin: it had a grainy smooth texture with perfect consistency, unlike the dining hall smoked salmon that is rough and nearly raw. The avocados--with their creamy texture--fit well with the chewiness of the bread and the smoothness of the salmon. The fried potatoes were amazing: crispy small pieces that were not too oily, as I dipped them my way through the ketchup.\\n\\nMy friend ordered the veggie omelet.

I'm not sure if we were starving from waiting so long or what, but the food was deeelicious. My roommate especially loved the calamari. The marinara it came with tasted tangy and sweet, full of flavor. For the price, the lobster ravioli was not really worth it because there weren't that many raviolis. The fusilli came in a generous portion (enough for two meals!) but was still really expensive...I guess that's what comes with all the hype! Also, the fusilli was slightly under cooked as it still had a hard center.

Two problems with this. The raised chairs are too high to have your feet touch the ground (I am 6'1\\"), and oddly shaped so your legs tend to fall asleep.

The service is above and beyond - they really know how to cater to regulars or even return guests.  This place is not what it appears to be from the exterior or even location but once inside, you might want to re-evaluate what you wear in because it's pretty much THAT nice.  The food is great with a catered range of how spicy you can or like to go.  They offer great the SEA (South Eastern Asian) Thai food choices that match with the novice to seasoned foodie.  The portion sizes are on the smaller side for their $7.95 lunch specials but that just means there's room for dessert - my fave: mango and sweet rice or fried banana medallions!!! \\n\\nI'm a fan of (almost) all soups so when I come here my hardest decision is which soup to order: Tom Yum (lemon-grass clear broth), Tom Kha (coconut milk & chicken broth) or the seafood basil soup!!\\n\\nWe've learned that Friday lunches are most busiest (which means our regular days will have to change to Thursdays instead) so expect a bit of a wait - ordering and paying.

One of my favorite order here - crispy duck fried rice.

No idea what's the reason.\\n2) This damned stamps which give you free appetizer. Every time you visit their place they put a stamp on a card. When you collect 4 stamps you may order free appetizer. We always come to this place as a big group for lunch and 1-2 months ago we were told that only one person for a table can get a stamp. Sounds like a crazy idea. We would all easily come as separate persons and capture all tables in a room. I don't order appetizers regularly, but this sounds to me like a greedy action (strange exception for a group).

The place was clean & the d√©cor kitsch.  They had snickers in the pan cakes, possibly the best idea in human history since the magna carta, delish.  Omelet was okay.  They cook all the eggs on the flat top, no pans so the omelets are almost like frittatas, the ingredients are kind of mixed in with the eggs (not my fave, but that's opinion).  The whole place was very clean, the service was pretty good (we sat at the counter) and the food was good.

It was a late dinner, 10pm - their last seating for the evening.  A note about decor - I like the way the kitchen is out in the open, but I do wonder what happens with the cooking smells - do they get sucked into the extensive ventilation system overhanging the ranges and counters?  The size of the kitchen also makes the entryway a rather cramped space, given the way that it squishes the circulation into too little space - you enter and you're not sure where to wait, because you might be in the way of servers picking up food.  The actual dining room/bar areas, once you get into them, however, are quite nice.  Be careful if you get seated in the bar area, though - the tables are super close together and it wasn't particularly comfortable.  I would imagine that it's kind of awkward to have all of those romantic two-tops so close together.\\n\\nService was pretty good - we got an attentive, but not overbearing server.  The food was also pretty good - I've been to CSB three or four times, and I would say that Craigie on Main is just as good, with a bit more of a New American bent to the menu than French.  I had the grilled octopus with chorizo cream (+ cipollini onions, hearts of palm); I'm not crazy about hearts of palm, but the octopus + chorizo cream combo was surprisingly good.  The octopus was cooked perfectly, too - on a par with the grilled octopus I had at Babbo this summer.  As a main course I had the slow-cooked (translation: sous vide) sea trout with frizzled ginger, mussels, and rock shrimp in an almond-Serrano Ham broth.  This was also excellent, though I feel that cooking the trout sous vide eliminates any texture the fish could have had; sometimes you just want something you can chew, you know?  I'm a little skeptical of sous vide stuff, because it can turn into really delicious mush; it's delicious, but it's still mush.  Overall, the dish was great - really fresh fish, perfectly cooked mussels and shrimp.\\n\\nThe desserts are noticeably better - the last time I went to CSB, they were decidedly average.  At Craigie on Main, I had the gingerbread pain perdu, which you must get because it is delicious.  It comes with a scoop of young ginger ice cream and a few stewed cranberries.  It's not a traditional pain perdu - it tastes kind of like a gingerbread cake with a wet, eggy crumb - tender, but not dense, as if it had been cooked in a hot water bath at a low temperature for a long time.  And the top was just slightly crispy, which was a wonderful contrast to the softness of the rest of the cake.\\n\\nSo overall, the food gets four stars.  Service gets four stars.  Decor gets three stars, and the other factor in this review (for people who just care about the food) is that I am not really a fan of gentrification.  I think it's great that CSB wanted to expand and found a new space, but did it have to be in my neighborhood?  It just seems so misguided and unintentionally mean-spirited to locate your upscale, expensive restaurant in a neighborhood full of residents who can't afford it.  I've lived in Cambridge for seven years, and in Area 4 for four years, and I've seen the slow march of gentrification destroying Central Square.  Not all of us want the influx of yuppie stores eliminating all of the diversity from the neighborhood.

It was around 8:15pm when we arrived, so the line waiting outside wasn't that bad (yes, the line is outside because the restaurant is too small and packed to have anyone waiting inside).  We waited outside for about 30 minutes before we could get a table for 2 inside.  It was definitely cramped, hot, and stuffy inside the restaurant.  It was almost 90 degrees outside, but I would say it felt about 10 degrees hotter inside!  I heard a few customers asking them if they had AC, and they replied they did, but it just doesn't work well.  With all the business that they get, I wonder why they just don't get a better unit that works well.  And what's with the cash only?  I don't mind it that much, and I know other Italian restaurants in the area do the same, but really, this place gets enough business that they can take the small hit of the credit card fees.\\n\\nAnyway, the service seemed very rushed.  We were brought to our table.  We asked for menus but they just said they didn't have any and said their menu was on the wall.  Surprisingly though, they gave other customers menus, and those customers were even seated close to the wall with the menu.\\n\\nThis place really does seem like a factory.  All the workers seemed very rushed.  I felt sorry for the cooks who had to cook all the food in that hot stuffy restaurant all day.  It seems really chaotic with the waiters and waitresses moving tables and chairs around so much to accommodate all the customers coming in.  You order your food, the food gets brought to your table.  You eat it quickly since it's too hot in there to eat slowly anyway.  The waiter refills the water a few times, but does it in a rushed manner and sometimes spills water on your table or on your food.  As soon as you get done eating, the waitress takes the plate away and hands you your bill.\\n\\nNow, on a positive note, the food really is good.  I liked being able to pick what seafood and sauce I wanted in my pasta.  It definitely was a tasty meal.  Unfortunately, even if I gave the food 4 stars, the fact that I can't enjoy it properly because of  the service and the hot and stuffy restaurant would bring my overall rating down to only 2 stars."},{"name":"Row 34","address":"383 Congress St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"Clean and slick looking spot that has a very active vibe.

I always get the salmon tibs. I've taken several people to the restaurant they've gotten the lamb.  They say it wasn't seasoned well but it wasn't bad.  My sister ordered them once and she said they were cooked too long (burnt). They don't do the fresh tea before your entree comes out & roast the fresh coffee beans & offer you coffee after your meal like they used to anymore . You have to ask for it (even when you dine in).  I ordered out one time and wanted my tea the lady tried to charge me $3  even though it normally comes w/ the meal.

Just years ago it was impossible to get a table on a weekend night, drinks were good and strong and the tapas were very good and priced accordingly. \\nOn a recent Friday evening the hubby and I walked in and were seated right away at a half filled Saba. Last time I visited the restaurant/lounge it was a struggle to get past the swanky bar. After an hour or so wait. We were hungry so we didn't really ponder it. Maybe we should have. \\nTwo overpriced, weak, and just not good martinis to start. We switched to wine and ordered our 5 tapas. I have eaten at many tapas restaurants (this one included) and know that it is proper to stagger the small plates. All 5 were brought at the same time. The ceviche was over seasoned so much that I was afraid of what it might be covering up. The shrimp kabob's were so small that they could have passed for the little shrimps you get at a make your own stir fry place. Heavily breaded (in what did not taste like plantains) and greasy to boot. The goat cheese medallions also seemed to suffer from freeze burn. Potstickers were forgettable. Calamari was the only item we both agreed was pretty good. Not enough to save the meal though. \\nIf the tapas (and drinks) had cost about half, this might have been a 3 star review. If it was the quality of the restaurant I had experienced over 3 years ago it would have been a 4 star. I hope Saba does something to turn itself in the right direction."},{"name":"Pairings","address":"50 Park Plz","city":"Boston","stars":"3","text":"Had dinner here with friends on Thursday night.

As soon as I got off the phone I set an alarm for 30 minutes and planned to walk out the door as soon as the bell went off. Since I'm only 5 minutes from the restaurant, that would get me there comfortably 10 minutes before the food was due to be ready. It would get me there before it came out. That way the pizza would be steaming hot and the salad would be nice and chilly. At least that was the plan. What really happened? At 28 minutes into the timer, I get a text, \\"Pizza's ready!!!\\"  Huh? How the HELL can you be so horribly off in your estimate? So, now I'm blasting out the door, racing to the restaurant. Of course, by the time I get there, my pizza and salad have been sitting out long enough that the pizza is cold and the salad is hot. I really don't understand how Via 313 doesn't keep to go orders in insulated bags, so what's hot stays hot and what's cold stays cold. Is it really that hard? So, I get home and the salad goes into the freezer for 15 minutes so I'm not eating hot lettuce and the pizza goes into the oven for 15 minutes, which of course dries out the crust at this point.

Big pile of barbequed, pecan pied, lemonaded, hot potato saladed, pulled porked, beef ribbed yes!\\n\\nThe first time I came here was sort of on accident.  My brother was stationed in Killeen, TX and was getting deployed, so my husband and I drove from Tucson to surprise him with an in-person goodbye before he left.  My husband realized we would be close-ish (closer than we are in Tucson, anyway) to The Salt Lick, featured on the Food Network.  We had always joked about going and making a special road trip to try it, but we were finally there!  Really trying this place that looked so amazing!  \\n\\nWe took my brother and his friend.  My brother had pulled pork sandwich, my husband had the sample plate....The Cowboy?  The Rustler?  Something Western....my brother's friend had the turkey plate, and I had the baby back ribs.  Oh my word.  I thought I had had decent barbeque before, but nope.  I was wrong.  Everything was fall apart tender after being smoked in their open pit smoker.  We all got pies for dessert (there were four of us, so we got to try all of the pies!) and all of them were amazing!  I don't really like pecan pie, or pie at all for that matter, but I would very happily order any of these again if made readily available here.  Which they aren't.  Which should be a crime.\\n\\nThe next time we came, the husband and I were headed to New Orleans on a road trip, and made a detour to meet my brother (back from his deployment and back in Killeen).  We didn't plan EXACTLY right, so we got there at 9:30, but they still let us in to use the restroom and freshen up after driving all night.\\n\\nSo, the three of us got the family-style option, which is basically all-you-can-eat Salt Lick barbeque.  Why we didn't do this the first time around I will never know.  We for SURE got our money's worth; my husband and I hadn't eaten since the day before to make sure we were starving for Salt Lick, and my brother has always been a bottomless pit, so we got a LOT of food!  There was keilbasa, brisket and ribs, served with beans, coleslaw, potato salad and bread.  We also got pie for dessert.\\n\\nYou can go outside to the waiting area and they will make you a fresh lemonade, lemons juiced to order, and it's tangy and sweet.  They have a band playing outside for the people that have to wait, which is nice.  The first time we came, we had to wait about half an hour, but it felt like it went by fast because of the things that had to occupy your time outside.\\n\\nThey have beer and wine available next door, all local brews, and on our second trip, which happened to be on my birthday, my brother bought me a birthday beer.  The only thing is, and I guess this is a Texas thing, they don't serve alcohol before noon on Sundays.  We don't have this in Arizona, so my brother and I went to get a beer at 11:30, when we were seated, and we were told in QUITE the snooty fashion \\"It's SUNDAY!  We don't serve beer before noon!

It was good, but they overcooked it and the spinach was charred over 90% of the leaves.  Also...the crust was a bit charred all around the outside.  Also, the pizza is not huge by any means.  It might be a 16\\" pizza or oven maybe a 15\\" pizza.  So, there won't be much in the way of leftovers if you bring your appetite.\\n\\nIt's extremely crowded (which I anticipated), but it was also very hot in there.  I mean, after maybe 5 minutes sweat was running down my face.  Of course, the BYOB aspect is awesome and I wish more ATL places would do that.  However, the fact that it was so hot in there, it's quite difficult to get a table (and you will be sitting with total strangers), and they burned the pizza...means they've got room for improvements.\\n\\nI'd certainly be willing to give it another try, but may have to wait until the weather cools down.

Since it was a group of 7 we were discussing the menu among ourselves before ordering and when the server (manager/owner) came to take our order we asked for a few more minutes as we were finalizing the order and would be ready upon asking for more time the server gave a rather non pleasant expression and asked us to hurry.  \\n\\nWe placed our order and when the food arrived one of friends noticed piece of burnt plastic on naan bread that was served, so he called the server and pointed the piece of plastic to which the server replied \\"I see plastic on the naan, I am not that stupid. What should I do?\\" (I mean really is that the best way to admit your mistake) hearing this the manager came over and I was thinking may be she will address the situation but oh boy! I was wrong she said that \\"Oh I see that there is plastic, what do you want me to do? We are busy so that must be the reason!\\" I mean all she had to do is take it back and bring out a replacement and admit that it was a mistake. \\n\\nUpon being pointed out by my friend that burnt plastic is a carcinogen and should not be near food the owner replied that \\"A lot of things are carcinogenic!\\" so the situation at this point went from bad to worse, so my friend said that this might be a health code violation to which the owner said that \\"Go ahead and complain to who ever you want!\\" being so rude to the customer. At this point another member of the staff added \\"You have a option not to come here\\"\\n\\nAfter this point we were pretty much \\"INVISIBLE/IGNORED\\" to the staff to the point that they did not even serve us water and at the end placed the check on our table. \\n\\nThe staff here is pretty rude and is not afraid to argue with the customer when a fault is pointed  out. \\n\\nDefinitely the restaurant is not worth spending time or money. \\n\\nTL;DR\\n\\nQuoting the Owner/Manager \\"You have option not to come here\\" I guess this statement sums it all as how welcoming the restaurant is to customers. \\n\\nTerrible service and sub standard food."},{"name":"Mozart's Coffee Roasters","address":"3825 Lake Austin Blvd","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Sorry, I honestly don't get the hype.\\nYes, the atmosphere is nice because it's on the lake, but the food quality is lacking.\\n\\nI tried their coffee cake once, and it was dry and stale.

We split a slide of crispy, duck fat fried, brussel sprouts that were perfect.  Soft in the middle and crispy burnt leaves on the outside.\\n\\nSince my meal was the 3 course prix fix we split the dessert it came with.

I had no idea hat Luce had been listed on Bon Appetite's top restaurants list until after we had eaten there and I checked Yelp, hoping I was not alone in my disappointing experience. Honestly I was shocked and really confused as to how and why this restaurant made the list. \\nFor a Friday night I was pleasantly surprised that there was no wait at all for us to be seated. Even though it was just my fianc√© and I, it's a small space and I had read other reviews that some parties as small as 2-4 people waited hours to be seated and hours to eat. So yay, seated quickly, so far so good! The ambiance is super cozy and the place has a certain mom and pop storefront charm about it. Love the flowers and candles on the tables as well as the canned and dried goods on the shelves. Seating is a bit uncomfortable and even rickety, I overheard the women at the next table over mention it as well. \\nMenu and Meal: My fianc√© and I were celebrating and wanted to order prosecco or champagne but luckily I noticed that no one else had a wine glasses at their tables and that everyone was using these sort of tumbler juice cups for wine.. literally, they reminded me of a toddler juice cup. Not a big deal, but I am glad I double checked with our waitress because I would not want to drink champagne out of those cups because they would lose their fizz so quickly! I'm sure other people or big wine lovers may feel the same way so I wanted to mention it. We decided to go with 1 glass each of the house white wine instead and it was good! Light and crisp but honestly the cup just threw me off, I felt like I was drinking grape juice. For food, we ordered olives and the house bread to start, I ordered the full size fettuccine with caramelized onions and asparagus for my entree and my fianc√© ordered the full size spaghetti with clams and a garlic red pepper sauce. The olives where dripping in olive oil, in my opinion way too much and they were overly slimy, but then again I'm not a huge olive person. My fianc√© on the other hand loves olives and he was really bummed, he literally ate 3 and the rest went untouched. The bread may have been the most disappointing of all, it came out cold, not soft, no butter no olive oil no anything but again, I was starving and trying to embrace the simplistic touches that Luce seemed to be laying on so thick, so I had a couple slices. It reminded me of subway sub bread and looked like it too! (See photo) only this was this bread was drier. It would make great crustini bread or croutons though. So the bread and olives basically sat untouched after we tried them,\\nThen the food came. Overall, the fettuccine with asparagus and onions was ok. I expected it to have more of a sauce because our waitress literally said \\"that dish has the most sauce\\", and that's why I chose it, but that was not the case at all. Maybe I'm alone on this, but I don't consider pasta dripping with olive oil and chicken broth to be considered sauce, broth maybe, but not sauce. Similar to the olives, the noodles actually had an over slimy texture to them which made the noodles impossible to eat with solely a fork. There was no spoon included in my place setting so I got up and went to the counter to ask for a spoon and the woman behind the counter looked over my shoulder back at my dish almost like \\"why do you need a spoon for what you ordered?\\" then she just pointed to a bucket full of spoons behind the counter. I did not ask for salt, pepper or butter for our dry bread, I asked for a spoon. It just seemed very pretentious and unfriendly. The dish had a strong chicken broth flavor to it with hints of sweetness from the caramelized  onions, the asparagus was really good too and tender. My fianc√©'s spicy clam spaghetti dish looked like something out of a magazine. His noodles were the most unusual \\"spaghetti\\" I had ever seen or tasted. He said that if he had been blindfolded he would have sworn we were eating ramen noodles bowls from the food carts on Division Street. Overall he said the clams were good, pasta unusual, and he wished the \\"sauce\\" had a little bit of thickness to it so it stuck to the noodles and clams more because he was also not given a spoon. It was just an odd and sad meal start to finish. The cherry on top was that it took them 15 minutes to wrap up my leftovers at the end of the meal which we could see just sat on the side counter forgotten about. Just an overall lack luster, disappointing and expensive $80 experience.

I've been eating here or getting takeouts on a weekly basis since January, the same week the new menus were printed!  If you love Chinese food, you must give this place a try.  \\n\\nIt is a casual atmosphere.  A little bit on the dingy side, but certainly not hole in the wall type of place.  Menu is very eclectic but completely authentic.  I would have liked a bit more choices in terms of small dishes, but the variety of available main dishes is dazzling.  It is a very different menu than seen at most good Chinese restaurants in Atlanta (Canton Cooks, Happy Valley, China Cooks, Canton House et el.), which are all Cantonese heavy.   And it is not focused like Tasty China.  If anything, it looks like Cafe 101's menu, but more traditional.  (Incidentally, the Ma's hail from Taiwan; Cafe 101 is Taiwanese)  The menu is especially exciting to me, since it features numerous offal dishes that I dearly adore.  Livers, kidneys, tripe, stomach, intestines, tendons, etc. come in many varieties, almost all delicious.  The beef noodle soup (the Taiwanese version) is rich and wonderful.  \\n\\nNow I know a lot of people are going to go here and order the soup dumplings (eponymous XLB) or the pan fried dumplings.  Apparently some of the best reviewers did (from Yelp or otherwise) and loved it. Bless their souls.  But I think these actually happen to not be Frank Ma's best offerings.  Many treasures can be found among the entrees: try the lamb stew, try the sauteed kidneys, try the seafood, try the three cup chicken, try the double cooked pork.  In fact, try a bunch of pork dishes.  Try the delicious onion pancakes.  Try to get something different every time.  The flavors are deep and execution true.  And many of the dishes are a (Georgia-wise) exclusive, you just can't get them anywhere else (even more true now that Peter Chen no longer cooks at Tasty China)!   \\n\\nI haven't tried their breakfast and dim sum offerings yet, available on the weekend.  Nor their lunch buffet, so I can't comment on those.  But Frank Ma's is no doubt one of my absolute favorite restaurants in Atlanta.\\n\\nPS: They close early.  It's not one of those places that opens until 2 am."},{"name":"Antico Pizza","address":"1093 Hemphill Ave NW","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Casual eating of simple, perfectly baked pizza every time I visited.  Eating the Margherita for the first time was one of the happiest dining experiences I'd had in Atlanta...like eating at Tasty China for the first time back when the original chef cooked there.  \\n\\nI was neither particularly charmed nor annoyed by the unique dining situation, standing up and eating from a large table often shared by multiple parties.  It was comfortable enough to eat and that's fine for me.  Probably I would have been slightly annoyed if you could only get to-go (which was apparently the case for a couple weeks), especially since the point of walking while munching doesn't work out very well in this area.  \\n\\nThe oven is magnificent, and I usually watch the pizzaiola (usually Giovanni) working on my pie with gleeful anticipation.  The high quality and freshness of all the ingredients (especially the dough itself) are very evident.  The pizzas are very large with puffy edges and not really expensive for the price, plenty of places do very small $12 pies.  The most magical thing about these pizzas is without a doubt the bread-like dough.  There is a singular texture, chewiness, stickiness, slight saltiness, and ridiculous wheaty aroma.  The oven is so damn hot and the pizza constructed so well the crust itself is extremely thin and does not crack collectively as you bite into it.  Basically it's a different kind of beast compared to the nice crackly thin American styles like New York (which is itself much better than the limp, underbaked, tasteless chain styles).  The dough reminds me a lot of the best of breads; I can't get enough of it.  \\n\\nMy favorites are the Margherita and San Gennaro.  There are some misses among the other options, but those two are always perfect.  If I haven't tried almost all the famous pizza places in Atlanta so far (I haven't written reviews for a few of them yet), possibly I would have gone for a 4 star, at least until I get a more complete set of references.
