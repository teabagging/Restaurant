He seemed to think that was a courtesy call but I'm still shocked. never has a waiter made that call. My husband wanted to say something but I let it go. My hash arrived with two uncooked eggs; they were supposed to be sunny-side up but the whites were completely uncooked. Again, it's Christmas and I just wanted to enjoy ourselves and so I let it go and thought maybe if I mix it all up, the heat from the hash will cook them. Nope. They ended up as gelatin in the bottom of the dish. My husband's scrambled eggs were not as 'soft' as advertised and the steelhead was downright 'fishy'. It tasted like fish leftover from dinner service. It just came with a brioche which is fine but so lackluster. The bread they originally served a la cart was thin wheat which tasted like wonder bread. I left my mary half way and only had a sip of my bubbly. I left our server 20% and didn't say anything.

The ambiance is quite divine. The service was stellar. (More on that later.) I have mixed feelings on the food though.\\n\\nMy roommate and I had a late dinner here. We started with the calamari. This was probably the largest bowl of fried squid I've ever seen. For the price and presentation, though, you'd imagine it had to taste like chum. Nope. Easily Top 5. The coating was fine and delicate - didn't overpower the sweet cephalopod at all. And the squiddy insides were cooked perfectly - which some restaurants fail to do. The sauce was just ok, though, and definitely unnecessary (have it on the side), as the calamari itself was delectable on its own.\\n\\nMy friend ordered the lobster roll - or was it called a sandwich? Thanks to our waitress who informed her that it's quite small - hand sandwich size, in fact. There wasn't much actual lobster on the sandwich, and the sauce was (again) too much for the main attraction. The lobster pieces alone were great. Too bad there were so few for the price.\\n\\nI ordered the scallops. Again with the cooking something to perfection! But the side items didn't quite go with the star item. The corn was a bit undercooked (rather gritty) and the sauce was (guess what?) unnecessary. It wasn't bad, just that the scallops were SO good (very basically seasoned at that) that the sauce overwhelmed all the scallops' simple elegance.\\n\\nOnto dessert. I love trying creme brulee (tasting how every place prepares it a tad differently). This one just wasn't good. Even the berries weren't good - like they weren't cleaned well enough. I really wanted to like it! But the custard tasted like raw eggs. Bleh! Thankfully, when we informed our server, she apologized, suggested that it might be an acquired taste, and then removed it from our bill.\\n\\nSo here's what I walked away with: The seafood is top notch, but the sides need some serious work.

I really, really liked that combo together. My second taco involved one of their special tortilla options (can't for the life of me remember what it was called but it was a flour tortilla with guac, sour cream, and crunch). On that one I got the pulled pork (pretty boring if it weren't for the toppings), the slaw (really good), pickled onions, and the crumbled cheese.

Everyone agreed that the cod was cooked to perfection.  It had just the right amount of breading on it, and it wasn't at all greasy.

It wasn't crowded and we got to sit outside and enjoy the 75 degree weather. I got there with baby 3, just before daddy and kids 1 & 2 came, and got seated right away (we had reservations). Let me say this, the staff is so genuinely nice! Not sure if we just caught everyone in a good mood, but every staff member that walked by smiled and said good morning. Thats pretty rare nowadays. Ambiance was nice and casual, place is clean and outside seating is definitely prime in nice weather. \\n\\nOMG the food choices. I wanted to order everything, but sadly had to settle on one thing only. :(\\nI got the crab cake Benedict. Crab cake? Awesome. Nice and crabby, didn't taste too breaded. Hollandaise sauce? Yum but not enough (I could eat a tub of that stuff). Egg and English muffin both good but let's be real. The crab cakes and sauce stole the show. \\nDaddy got the chefs special. Typical American bfast but with a little twist. Potato pancakes were surprisingly good with apple sauce. Like a pancake and hashbrown hooked up and this was their baby. Apple sausage was good too. Definitely recommend.\\nKids had the Mac n cheese, which tasted nice and home made. Z1 said it was too cheesy, but I don't see that as a negative. Z2 got the egg and bacon plate. He inhaled the eggs and shared the bacon. Only complaint is the bacon serving looked like one piece that they broke in half. Not enough for my kids, but they still shared. \\n\\nWe HAVE to come back, it's not an option.

Fat Matt's Rib Shack is located on Piedmont Road, just south of and across the street from Grindhouse Burgers.  The restaurant truly does have a \\"shack\\" feel to it.  Takeout orders are placed to the right of the counter at the entrance.  The art on the wall is interesting.  There's both outdoor and indoor seating.  I came late at night after a long day at work and the small parking lot barely had enough spots.   So, carpool or take Uber.  I only heard the blues band for about ten minutes while waiting for takeout, but the music is very good.  It's loud, but you could still probably hold a conversation while the music's playing.\\n\\nOn the Menu: Ribs, chicken, combos, sandwiches, and sides.  The menu is pretty simple.  Note that if you order a half slab or full slab of ribs, the sides are not included.  You can order a 1/4 bird (chicken) or 1/2 bird.  The combo comes with a 1/4 slab ribs and a 1/4 bird.  \\n\\nWhat I Tried:\\nHalf Slab of Ribs ($13.50) - The ribs were big and meaty.  Seasoning on the ribs wasn't strong, but adequate.  On the side, you get two slices of white bread to enjoy your ribs with.  Also, you get a cup of sauce that may look small but is actually the perfect amount for a half slab of ribs.  Fat Matt's barbecue sauce is sweet and tangy.  The ribs do meet the requirement of falling off the bone, but the meat is a little fattier and chewier than I've had at other places.\\n\\nCole Slaw ($1.60) - From a scale of light to creamy, Fat Matt's cole slaw sits in the middle.  The vegetables are chopped in a fine dice.  It's refreshing to eat on the side of the ribs, but I wouldn't jump to order this the next time.\\n\\nVerdict: The ribs are very good, they're just not on my top five list.  Live music, though, is a huge bonus.  For decent barbecue and good late night music, this is a place that I'd recommend you check out."},{"name":"Screen Door","address":"2337 E Burnside St","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"A couple of minor negatives first: the service can be hit-or-miss, which is much more due to the popularity of the place than any failings on the part of the wait staff.

It was definitely a very fun drink and the sorbet was delicious.\\nWe ordered:\\ncrab benedict\\nbrisket hash\\ncraw fish and blue crab hush puppies\\nbaked brie\\npastrami smoked salmon bagel\\nbeignets\\ncajun homefries\\nThe tapas format is unconventional yet creative, but some of the dishes could have been far easier to split among several people. For example, the bagel (which does not contain any pastrami, just smoked salmon prepared similarly to pastrami) is almost impossible to split and we just ended up passing it around and taking bites. The crab benedict tasted very good, but there were two english muffins, one with only a poached egg and the other with only the crab cake.\\nWe started with the baked brie which was delicious and the creaminess was perfectly complemented by the sweet tartness of the gooseberries and nuttiness and sweetness of the pecans. The hush puppies were decadent and very, very tasty. Highly recommend these as they are very easy to share. The brisket hash was one of the best dishes; the mushrooms were a nice addition and the egg on top added the perfect amount of creaminess and decadence to the dish. The homefries as a side were fine, but a bit underwhelming in comparison to the rest of the delicious meal. We ended with the beignets which tasted like puff pastry that had been thrown in the fryer and rolled in powdered sugar. There isn't anything necessarily wrong with that, but they were greasy and I have no idea why they were served with a ramekin of butter. Maybe that's a New Orleans thing I don't know about?\\nIt's a very nice space and the service was engaging, personable, and entertaining.

So much so that we did go within the first week or so of its opening. The restaurant is fresh and cool. The decor is modern and unique and they have these cool interactive aquarium screens where you can create your own individual fish. We got there and the hostel advised us that it would be an hour wait for a table for 4. Being that we were all really hungry, we walked around the three floors of the restaurant trying to find a spot at the bar. The staff on the second floor was really helpful in helping us get four seats together at the sushi bar on the second floor. \\n\\nWe sat down and were promptly greeted by our server, Sarah, who was easily the best part of our experience! She gave us a comprehensive overview of the menu and some awesome recommendations. We put in our drink and appetizer orders. Between the four of us we tried the Moscow mule, Mexican mule and red panther cocktails. The Moscow mule and Panther cocktail were just okay and not really worth the $10 price tag. The Mexican mule on the other hand was really unique and delicious! It was the perfect blend between a margarita and a mule... Definitely recommend it! We tried the truffle fries and the Crab Rangoon dip for appetizers and both were really tasty! I have to say that the truffle fries were my favorite though. \\n\\nWhen we placed our order Sarah let us know that the kitchen was having some trouble with their printers and that the wait may be a little longer than expected. She wasn't kidding. We ended up waiting about an hour and a half for our sushi. In this time, though, Sarah kept us posted and even brought us out a complimentary dessert role to hold us over while we waited. It's their first week being open and slip ups are understood... This is the perfect example of how to handle these types of situations! Sarah did a wonderful job!! \\n\\nWhen we did finally get our rolls we were VERY impressed.

Tucked away in industrial park, this place is probably a hidden gem in a city that I think is underrated when it comes to craft beer.\\n\\nBecause it is not located in the busiest parts of Orlando, parking shouldn't be too much of an issue here (if you don't Uber, Lyft, etc. here of course). With this being a brewery, Dead Lizard has a pretty casual setting and seems like a place I'd come back to hang out again.\\n\\nIf you're into Untappd and like to check tap lists ahead of time before hitting up a bar or brewery, Dead Lizard does have its tap list available through the app. One of the first things you'll notice are the names - they do try to maintain the lizard concept with the beer names. \\n\\nIf you can't commit to just one beer and/or want to try multiple beers, Dead Lizard does do small pours/flights, which gives you four sample sized pours of beers. A lot of the beers sounded really good, so I ended up going with two flights. I tried:\\n\\n- Anole Bourbon Nut Brown\\n- Hop Suck'n Slut (Double IPA)\\n- Uncle Pudgy's Two Fisted Porter\\n- Komodo \\"KoKo\\" Dragon Chocolate Stout\\n- Chai Chameleon Cream-sic-ale\\n- Key Lime Chameleon Cream-sic-ale\\n- Passion Fruit Chameleon Cream-sic-ale\\n- Caucasian Dude (Death Wish Coffee Co Cream-Sic-Ale)\\n\\nThe first four are really good examples of what you'd want for that beer style. I can't complain about any of them and I would definitely have them again. But, what I really liked were the last four - variations of the cream ale with adjunct flavors. I can't say I've seen many beers like those last four and ones I would go for first if you're more adventurous when it comes craft beer.\\n\\nOverall, great tap room with great beers - can't ever go wrong with that."},{"name":"Fox Bros.

So I'll concur with the food=good, service=poor meme, remembering that Revival has been open less than a month and needs more time to hit its service stride. Happily the food overcame all other issues for us.\\n\\nThe on-line reservation system made me a bit crazy. I received multiple e-mails and phone calls to confirm and reconfirm the reservation. It got to be annoying. It was a Tuesday night dinner, not Mother's Day. My advice is to call the restaurant directly and skip the overly aggressive on-line reservation system.\\n\\nBut we were greeted by personable valet, who started off the evening nicely. The women at reception were friendly and gracious. So far so good. We had come early to have a drink before dinner but changed our minds and sat in a nice seating area while we waited. The restaurant was crowded and we were seated at our reservation time. Great! And the woman who seated us told us that our server would be there in a moment.  And that's when things went \\"off the tracks\\".\\n\\nThe server didn't show and we waited and waited. Finally another server poured water for us and assured us that he would be with us in just a minute. But still no server. Finally, he appeared and was very pleasant. But every time we asked or needed something, he would wander away and he'd return with or without what we had requested. We asked to order wine so he had to go find a wine list. Instead of a 30 sec errand, he was gone for 5 minutes. When he returned, we thought it best to get our dinner order in to the kitchen. Then we ordered wine which he did not bring until dinner arrived. That poor service continued until we finally got our check, paid it and left. We needed spoons for our side dishes but once the food arrived never even saw him to ask. So another glass of wine was a pipe dream. And we had hoped to order more cornbread but that was also an impossibility.\\n\\nAs a side note to the service problems, the table next to ours, a family of 3, who were seated long before we were seated, never did get their dinner. I felt badly and we were embarrassed that we received our dinner while they still waited. Finally, they gave up and left without eating. There may be more to this story. We only heard the family's side but with the same server, I was sympathetic to their plight.\\n\\nBut let me give proper credit to the food. The cornbread is an epiphany. We had 1) fried chicken and 2) GA white shrimp baked in a ramekin. For sides, we shared: 1) creamed corn, 2) field peas and butterbeans with dill and 3) mac 'n cheese baked in a cute, little, personal-size cocotte. We found the food to be very salty but not so much that we couldn't eat every bite. I am happy to recommend any of these dishes. They were terrific.\\n\\nIf we were to pick our favorites dishes it would be the cornbread and the mac 'n cheese. You can read about the cornbread in many other reviews. The consensus is OUTSTANDING. And the Mac 'n Cheese is so rich and delicious, it might be good that we didn't have any spoons.\\n\\nI think the concept of Sunday Dinner at Grandma's is going to keep this as a special occasion restaurant.

South City Kitchen is one of the best known of that cuisine in Atlanta, and consistently gets high marks from publications as well as in review sites.  I've been here twice now, once for dinner a few months ago and again last Friday for lunch.\\n\\nThe service for the most part is pleasant if not quite impeccable.  Only negative was with the hostess for lunch.  When we walked in, she was seating someone so we waited by the front door, which is also where the seating computer is (noticed this only after she pointed it out).  She comes back, asks how many, and then, in an exacerbated tone and I quote, \\"Uh, could you move\\" so she can get to the computer.  Yes, to a customer in an annoyed tone.  The only unpleasant service experience at this place but a huge impression, not for the better.\\n\\nThe place is adorable.  Patio area is great although we didn't sit there either time, and interior and decor is cozy and rustic.  Going up the stairs to 2nd floor is a bit of a hassle, but the view from there looking down onto the dining area and bar is enjoyable.\\n\\nThe food... well, it's quite good in a way and not so much in another.  At the least, the flavors are fantastic.  For dinner, we had She-crab Soup, Pork Belly, Fried Chicken, Shrimp & Grits, and Collard Green Kimchi for side.  For lunch, Fried Green Tomatoes, Shrimp & Grits, and Fish & Chips, a special of the day.  The dinner, overall, was very tasty but very salty.  The soup, chicken, and pork belly were all too salty to eat without bread (by the way, to-die-for cornbreads).  Shrimp & Grits was fine on that point, and collard green was a bit salty but very tasty.  Lunch was a bit on the salty side as well, but this is probably more due to my habit of not putting salt in anything rather than that the food is saltier than usual.  Despite the general saltiness, the flavors are full and distinctive.\\n\\nOverall, the experience was good but I'm still on the fence about the whole hype.  I want to like it more than my experiences are telling me, but I can't bring myself to give it 4 stars.  It's a solid 3.5, but I think I will give it a 3 rather than 4 (since Yelp! won't let me give it 3.5!)

I was so happy to see a sign outside an old Indian restaurant which said Tibet Kitchen Coming soon (where Purewal sweets used to be), I said YESSS just what i had been waiting for. I had some Tibetan food 3 years agoo at the local Tibetan Community's LOSAR festivities and today I got the chance to really dig in when i found that this new place is open for business. \\n\\nThe main chef has 5* hotel experience from India and it shows in the food they served today. They offer a wide variety of food which makes me glad as this should increase their survival rate in the tough restaurant market of Vancouver. Being the 1st and currently only place to eat Tibetan food definitely helps. They serve Indian style Chinese food also which adds to the current competition from the likes of Green Lettuce/Chilli pepper house. Also on the menu are options from the Indian Cuisine. \\n\\nSo in an area like Fraser street, what a better Idea than having Chinese/Indian/Tibetan all mixed together to make a unique Exotic blend. \\nThe restaurant is right opposite of Blockbuster Video, There are Tibetan Prayer Flags outside so finding it shouldnt be a problem and im guessing that a new Sign board should be installed pretty soon as well. \\n\\nNow let me talk about the FOOD first as i guess that what you'll like me to talk about, so if you want me to be brief - Grab your forks and Dig IN !! \\nThe best of what i had so far - Butter Paneer !! yes the famous Butter Chicken sauce can be had with Paneer too and it tastes DIVINE !!! I guess HH Dalai Lama's pic in the background might have some affect on the food :P\\nIndian food - CHECK awesome for Butter Paneer.\\n\\nIn Tibet Gyoza or Dumplings are called MOMOs and they have chicken, beef or vege options. We LOVED our Vegetarian Momos. I also tried the traditional steam bun from Tibet called Tigmo and it ws Fresh and nice.\\nWe also tried the Tibetan noodle soup bowl which again was flavourfull and hearty. The 1 thing i was really looking forward to was Yak milk Tea from Tibet, But i guess getting Yak milk is close to impossible for a small restaurant all the way here, so they used normal milk & butter for the Boa-Cha (tea)  and it was definitely worth every penny. For only 3$ we got a whole flask of Boa-Cha which was approximately 6+ cups !! It has Butter & salt in tea which im sure most people would never have tried before. \\nTibetan food - CHECK Awesome for Momos & Tea\\n\\nIndian style Chinese food includes the fan favorite Manchurian and chopsuey and wings etc and they all looked great, we couldnt try that today but other people seemed to have been loving it. \\nAll Chinese restaurants in India have condiments i havnt seen in any Chinese restaurant i've been to in Vancouver - Green chillies in White vinegar and a uniqe spicy sauce. We find those in all small or big Chinese restaurants in India and Tibet Kitchen was the 1st for me to see the exact same taste for the 1st time. \\n\\nIt is Open 7 Days a week, 12 PM (noon) to 10 PM and being close to my home, I'll definitely be coming here a lot lot lot more. \\nneed more Butter Paneer !! yum. \\nThey also serve all kinds of beef & chicken dishes but there are enough Vegetarian and tofy options to keep herbivores like me happy too. \\nThe Decor is simple yet true to Tibet with a big corner devoted to The Dalai Lama. I had some Dejavu moments with the decore and the food while i was there, Its the little part of India that was missing in the local Vancouver food scene. But its here now!! I wish them all the success and its always a good feeling to see Tibetans being Happy, I have  a soft corner for them :)\\n\\nBut whether u have a soft corner or not, If you even have half a taste bud, come here and I bet you wont be disappointed. \\nTibetan food isnt as flavorfull as its other neighborly cuisines like Chinese or Indian due to the lack of spice options but its the Hybrid of China/Tibet/India which makes this place special."},{"name":"Bob Evans","address":"9891 Brewster Ln","city":"Powell","stars":"2","text":"Bob Evans has good food.

My favorite part about this tasting menu was that fact that there were so many interesting elements on each dish that were put on there to compliment each other thus creating the perfect bite. \\n\\nOne thing to note however, is during the reservation, I had informed them that someone in my party is allergic to avocado. One one the dished that came out clearly had avocado on there. So there was a lack of communication between the host and kitchen. We had told out waiter who brought it back to have them remade. However, the funny about an open kitchen concept and with me sitting right in front of it, was the fact that I saw the chef roll eyes when the dish came back.

Lots of flavor and texture in the meat.  The sauces (regular, regular sweet, chipotle, and Carolina, I think) went well with the meat but were unnecessary.  My favorites were the first two.  I had a few rib bones (buck a bone day) and a chopped salad with brisket.  The brisket on the salad was huge slices of tender meat, again perfectly smoked and full of flavor with a nice crust.  The ribs were pretty darn good too- big, meaty, fine with no sauce.  The salad hiding under the brisket was a necessity, since I have been on the road the last few days eating unhealthy stuff, finishing up with a friend's \\"Sausage Fest\\" cookout.  The greens were fresh and tasty, the goat cheese and other toppings created a great balance of flavors.  \\n\\nWe will probably be back.  The place is nice, inside and out (big patio.)

After arriving on Wednesday and going straight to Rudy's, my wife and I lined up at 9 am on Thursday for Franklin which has the reputation of being the best BBQ not only in the city but in the US. That's a tall order so we had to find out even if it meant getting up early. \\n\\nWe got in line at 9 am and lunch started at 11 am. Word is that getting there early is the key so you don't miss out since the place is only open from 11-3 (or earlier depending on how quickly they sell out). By the time 10 am rolled around the line snaked behind us as one of the workers took early estimated orders to get an idea of when they would be sold out. The best part about waiting in line was talking about BBQ with people and their experiences around town. It was a vintage Austin communal experience! \\n\\nMy wife and I ordered brisket (lean and moist) and pork ribs. In all honestly, we were both blown away by the combination of the rub, the bark on the brisket, and the smokiness. The sliced brisket meat did not fall apart but held together well, yet tender enough you could cut it with a fork. All of that combined left me speechless, agreeing with so many others that this was probably the best BBQ at least when I think of my eats in Kansas City, Memphis, Dallas, the Carolinas and Chicago. \\n\\nThe ribs were done perfectly! Moist and almost ready to fall off the bone but not quite. Frankly, there are sauces available but really the meat is so good that you don't need to add sauce - which is the Texas way of BBQ. \\n\\nIn the end, I'm convinced that it was worth it to get up early and wait in line. My suggestion is go on a weekday (closed on Mondays) and get there around 8:30-9 am and you should be guaranteed to be up to the counter at least by 1 pm.

But today I was up on Burnet, and the BF's B-Day is tomorrow, so I parked it and went in. Got one for my man, two for my co-workers and one for me. O my dam, it was the best cupcake I've ever eaten! Michael Jackson did me right, with the rich chocolatey cake and cream cheese frosting. And co-worker professed her love for me through a mouthful of buttercream. The only thing I would change is a few more options. But I can definitely see craving these in the future.

We sat at the bar on a Monday night and it was very comfortable, not crowded.  The bartender (Marcus, I think?) was great.  Very knowledgeable about the menu items and was able to make recommendations.  We started off with 6 oysters which were 50% off (they seem to always be as that is how it's stated on the menu, so $1.50 a piece which is a bargain!).  Then we had the mixed greens salad which had this awesome crunchy roasted kale sprinkled on top.  The stuffed avocado appetizer is a MUST!  My beau loved his steak frites, and if you're a veg-head like me, go for the mushroom tofu burger.  The dominant taste was mushrooms, I feel like the tofu was used as a binder.

One day after Barre class we came here for brunch. It was PACKED, the line almost out the door but we waited and managed to get a table. I had the southern and grits. \\n\\nI'm going to be honest, I make pretty good grits at home and my experience with eating grits at other places is that they never measured up (in my mind anyway) to the one's I make at home and I was thinking that very thing when I dunked my spoon and scooped up the cheesy goodness. Once I picked up those incredible flavors I had to stop for a minute. My friend looked at me and she was like \\"What? You don' t like it?\\" and I was like \\"I'm so mad.. I can't believe it... These grits are better than the one's I make!!!\\" Oh man, what is your secret Se7en Bites? Is it Havarti with dill cheese? Fontina cheese? It's gotta be in the cheese because these are totally different than any other grits I've ever had. You have me stumped!!! How do you make your grits so dang tasty?!?!\\n\\nIn other news; you already know how I feel about their cookie bar, try it if you're into sweet/salty.

The male servers are friendly and helpful with describing the menu items.  They don't rush you out.  The mussels are so large and juicy!  The best mussels that I have found in Seattle and Portland.  Save the broth for dipping bread.  The salmon salad was refreshing.  The grilled salmon was cooked well done without being dry.  The parmesan crusted sole is good with a crisp to each bite. The etouffee was excellent with a little spice so I wasn't able to eat too much of this.  Use the bread to finish the sauce.  Seafood fettuccini is good but heavy so this is better to share so you can try other dishes.  Bouillabaisse was also hearty with a lot of seafood.  We usually try one of the daily specials which have been delicious.  I came once for my birthday and got a chocolate cake with a candle!   I'm usually too happy and full from lunch to order dessert.

Although the sign on the front door said the dining room was open until 11 pm, the hostess told us that they were serving their late night menu. That menu has appetizers and a few dinners, so we thought that would be OK.\\n\\nThe decor is very cozy, with dark wood tables and chairs. Some tables have couches or upholstered armchairs for seats. My husband and I were seated at a table with normal wooden chairs, but I noticed that the table was larger than a typical 4-person table. \\n\\nI had the ribs and my husband had the meatloaf. We both enjoyed our meals, me a little more than my husband. The ribs were spicy and fell off the bone. The mashed potatoes were yummy as well.\\n\\nThe service was unfortunately slow considering the hour and how few people were in the restaurant. We had to wait at the hostess station to be greeted, and our server took a while to bring our drinks and the check. If it wasn't for that and the \\"late-night\\" menu at 9:30, I probably would have given another star, since the food was tasty."},{"name":"Se7en Bites","address":"617 N Primrose Dr","city":"Orlando","stars":"4.5","text":"I had there chicken pot pie and drank lavender lemonade.

Seriously.\\n\\nAs a heads up allow me to provide you with a few informational tidbits before standing in line to this heavenly gift brought to you by Franklin's BBQ.  \\n- Do not skip breakfast.  You will be in line for a while and an empty stomach will not help things.  Bring yourself some donuts or breakfast taco or two while you wait in line.  \\n- Bring water.  Seriously, you don't want to get dehydrated.  The folks at Franklin are pretty considerate and sell water and other drinks while you are in line and there is a CVS right around the corner.   \\n- Bring something to sit on, preferably a lawn chair.  There's a fella who will rent chairs for 5 bucks which is pretty reasonable, and they come with umbrellas, but save your money If you can.  \\n- Bring something for your skin.  if it's summer in Texas you will want to protect yourself from skin cancer.  'nuff said.  \\n\\nSome friends and I made the trip to Austin for Franklin's and it did not disappoint. Of course there was the obligatory hours long wait in line, but once you get to the front you realize it was all worthwhile. Few sites will illicit the emotion that Franklin's Barbecue will when it has been presented to you.  \\n\\nThe ribs are delicious and just come right off the bone, and have an amazing taste that I cannot begin to describe.  The brisket is just and tender and definitely get yourself some burnt ends.  The sausage has an amazing snap to it.  I would have to say the brisket was my favorite of the bunch.  \\n\\nTo top it all off I have to say the staff is super friendly and even helped my girlfriend to understand the different sections of brisket to serve her what she would enjoy best, and they even enjoyed my little joke when I told them I would take everything they had left.  All in all, I'd say if you are making the trip, do it in a group, because having someone to talk to while you wait, helps keep you sane."},{"name":"Serafina Downtown","address":"10 High St","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"Loved it.

Barbecue is as personal as religion.  Who am I to judge? Ok I am one to judge. I am a food critic. \\n\\nLet's just get this out of the way, parking is atrocious. Go ahead and find a spot to put your ride and get inside. Keep expectations in check. This isn't valet fine dining. This is cue!  \\n\\nAs you would hope the inside of Matt's is cozy, divey and smells of goodness. Smoke, smoke and more smoke. All of you have your standard favorite go to and it's sure to be found here. Chopped pork sandwich, ribs, chicken and unfortunately no brisket. You can't tell a chef what to make. He/she makes what he makes and you like it or leave. Once you get your plate fixed up with your standard favorite gaggle of tasty sides, find a communal table and roll up your sleeves. The seating is about as atrocious as the parking but again, get over it. \\n\\nWhy, yes that is a stage you see  at the other end of the counter. If you sit close enough to it the band will be in your lap. Matt's does have entertainment once the sun goes down.

We ordered the 3 piece fried chicken and waffles, oyster po boy with mac and cheese, and a side of praline bacon. The food came out promptly and steaming hot. Ugh it makes my mouth water even now. The fried chicken had the perfect amount of crispness and was even a little spicy, but that could be offset with a touch of maple syrup. Paired with the sweet potato waffle, which was crisp on the outside and light and fluffy on the inside, it made a delicious meal for any time of day (too bad it's only served for breakfast and lunch). I savored every bite of the praline bacon, which was sweet from maple syrup and covered in crushed pralines. And the pieces of bacon were thick and meaty - they don't cheat you here.

Waiter informed me he forgot to put them in til after the burger order so they would be coming out as a side in a couple minutes. The chili cheese fries were also horrible. Chili tasted as  if it came out of a can and the cheese that came on top was more of a watery Parmesan than anything else. I would think that if you only have a few items on your menu you would make sure they were done right, because there really aren't a lot of options to choose from. Burgers should be juicy and flavorful ect. Instead we learned that the reason you aren't asked how you want your burger cooked, is because they cook them at one temperature only.

The really nice manager came over and asked us what we thought of the food and neither of us wanted to tell her the truth. My friend ended up telling her our thoughts, and she gave us coupons for free burgers. uhh what? free burgers?

We have gone here quite a bit and this place is always pretty busy.  This latest visit was no exception.  Even with a large amount of people though El Vaquero usually gets you seated within 5 minutes, if not immediately, as they are used to doing the busy crowds.  Once seated you will find a pretty nice restaurant that is usually kept pretty clean.  Everyone gets the nice, warm tortilla chips with some delicious, but very very mild, salsa.  Don't fill up on chips though!  We always do eat a bit more chips though than most because one of the best things to order here is the queso dip.  It's extremely cheesy and delicious and the best queso we have ever ate (even better than Hasa Casienda!).\\n\\nI've eaten just about 1/5th of the huge, huge (probably too huge lol) menu of theirs and have only once had a not-so-great meal.  That is when I got the steak meal, cannot recall the exact name.  It wasn't terrible but it wasn't the best either.  I'd say save ordering the steak for when you go to a steakhouse is all.  It was a bit fatty and gristly.  Not too awful but I would never order it again.  Now don't get alarmed though, the steak fajitas and steak tacos, those sorts of menu items are awesome..it's just the actual steak that's not so awesome.  Or perhaps maybe I just got one bad steak of the day.\\n\\nLast time I went here I was recommended by my fiance to try the Burrito Rosqueto.  If you're a fan of fajitas then this is something you will love, absolutely LOVE.  It's basically a fajita in a burrito and it's probably the best thing there save for getting what is my absolute favorite and that is the actual fajitas.  I love all of their fajitas but typically get the shrimp or steak fajitas.  They come out sizzling and are guaranteed to fill you up with probably a fajita left to take home for a snack later.  \\n\\nAnother thing that's is they will take special requests here, for example I wanted a tostida but with refried beans instead of beef and they made it just like how I requested.  So they are very accomodating.  However, I will say the one issue I have is that none of the people who work here are very friendly.  They are fast, efficient and great at what they do, and they are never ever ever rude or annoying, but they could smile a bit is all and interact a little more in a friendly manner.  Of course I think they are like the way they are as this place is just so busy they try to do the job the most efficient way possible and sometimes that means foregoing chit-chat.  So that I totally understand but they still could smile sometimes!  It's a rather minor complaint though I think as their food and great service means an overall very good dining experience.  \\n\\nI would not hesitate to recommend anyone to come here if they are looking for great food done quickly and with a reasonable rate.

Personally I like the tender and juicy turkey. \\nNow I'm a purist when it comes to my BBQ, much like the man Franklin himself, and I believe the meat should be able to hold its own without any sauce. While that's certainly true here, they still have some incredible sauces for the die-hard fans. The most unique, and my personal favorite, is the dark espresso sauce. It's dark, thick, slightly sweet and wonderfully smokey with just enough coffee to delay the oncoming food coma until after the ride home."},{"name":"Lorenzo's Ristorante Italiano","address":"3807 N Mississippi Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"Nice spot in hipsterville on Mississippi. the decor had a industrial and bohemian flair with a open kitchen and older furniture. for starers we had the antipasti platter with bread that I'm guessing came from grand central right up the street, darn good stuff! \\n\\nThe pasta was fresh and cooked to a perfect aldente on the giant ravioli with is a full sheet of pasta flipped over in my case roasted cauliflower, paying a extra dollar to add prosciutto was a no brain-er in my book! \\n\\nWifey had the gnocchi that was in a delicious pool of delicious Gorgonzola sauce and a few pieces of roasted zucchini, she said that a little more veg would had been nice but she loved the sauce. \\n\\nGreat place to take a date as they had live music on Thursday nights that it nice back ground noise. \\n\\nDrinks were reasonably priced at 3.50 or an organic IPA and 6 glass of primativo. \\n\\nfun spot we will be back!"},{"name":"Moojo","address":"630 Ralph Ablanedo Dr","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"ice cream: good\\ncookies: good\\nbut together, i dont know something was just missing"},{"name":"Isla","address":"208 W 4th St","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Super cute and good tacos!

I love burgers but will not have them as often anymore (getting a bit older, burger attaches to belly), so I have to make sure it's 'worth it'.  Well, based on the Fried Chicken and Beef Tongue Tacos, it is a candidate to try.  The fried chicken was moist, fried perfectly, and somehow tasted light?  It came with a wonderfully light tasting potato salad that paired perfectly with the chicken.  One thing that would have kicked it to another level was a hot sauce along with the fried chicken.  I would love to see more restaurants offer hot sauces other than tabasco or sriracha.  Either way, don't let that deter you from trying this delicious bird.\\n\\nThe beef tongue tacos as everyone has already said is awesome.  The crunchy pieces are great but what makes the taco are the 4 sides that come with it, all flavors having a say in that succulent bite.  \\n\\nLast but not least, get the Moscow Mule.

The host seemed worried that I was being made to wait too long, but I wasn't in a hurry and I don't really consider 10 minutes at prime Sunday afternoon to be all that long to have to wait. \\n\\nCB's have a lot of traffic in and out, and a lot of that traffic is family/kid heavy. It didn't surprise me that there was a bit of spilled food under my table. Obviously, the  couple that came in shortly after me weren't as cavalier about their surroundings as they both stood at the table, hands on hips, scowling because there were little dots of spilled food (possibly corn) under their table. Considering the fact that they were in jeans and sneakers, I don't really see what the drama was for. Nevertheless, they refused to take their seats until someone was sent to sweep all the offending crumbs away. Whew! Close call!\\n\\nAnyway, it never seems to matter what time of day I hit up CB, I always get breakfast.

Happily, Franklin BBQ has me tossing them out the window. \\n\\nThe brisket is the best I've had in the ACL. The fatty can run with the big boys in Lockhart, if not quite catch them, and I think the lean compares favorably with Salt Lick.

A generous scoop of vanilla ice cream is sandwiched between these two grilled doughnut halves, and caramel is drizzled on the plate.

It's way bigger than I initially thought, with all kinds of seating arrangements and areas, plus a really long bar. With its casual and cool but still classy vibe and wicked friendly/attentive staff, I could see this place being good for anything from a date to a family outing to a business lunch, and the menu of small seasonal plates has a little something for everyone (the drinks menu is also interesting as well, including draft cocktails and some rareish beers).\\n\\nBetween 2 of us, we got 1 burger and 3 plates, and I left satisfied but not overly full. You start off with a complementary plate of pickled green beans with sesame seeds, whcih was really refreshing and flavorful (was that cinnamon in there?). My $8 pistachio crusted halloumi with roasted cherry tomatoes was delightful; simple but excecuted really well with top notch ingredients. The $15 pork belly over grits with grilled peaches was a reasonably large portion, and was also done excellently and well worth the price (those peaches with an epelette pepper sauce were pretty awesome). The boy enjoyed his $15 secret burger and felt it was also worth the price, both size- and quality-wise.\\n\\nHowever, the $16 prawns a la plancha was a big disappointment: 2-3 medium sized shell-on shrimp cut in half, served under some pea shoots and over some creamy sauce. Take the shrimp out of their shells, and you only have a few small bland bites of food at best, not to mention the fact that each shrimp half was extremely gritty (which I hope to god was just seasoning and/or shrimp legs, and not actual grit/dirt/sand!). Nothing about this dish was good, and I still regret ordering it and wasting my $16 (should have sent it back, should have ordered the sweet corn gnocchi instead). \\n\\nThat hiccup aside, everything else about my experience was pretty solid, so I'd be happy to return, and just choose more wisely."},{"name":"903 Mills Market","address":"903 S Mills Ave","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"Mills Market is one of my favorite lunch spots in all of Orlando.

I wish places like this would realize that I would probably spend more if the games didn't feel like such a rip off. $1 for 45 seconds of playing is just not fun. \\n\\nHowever, the main problem I could see when we were there was staffing. On a Monday, during the summer at lunch time every lane was full and everyone was ordering food. There were literally two guys and one cook running the whole thing. We were there before most and it still took 40 minutes to get our food. When it did arrive there was a hair in one of the sandwiches which my kid then refused to eat. Honestly I felt sorry for the guys because I could see they were trying very hard to balance it all but there was just too much to do for the number of staff on hand.

My boyfriend aptly observed that they tried to do something a little non-traditional with each item, and it failed on every level. \\n\\nThe crab rangoons tasted like they contained ginger, and they were paired with an odd-tasting ginger sauce. In short, it was a slightly bitter ginger overload.\\n\\nThe boneless ribs had an off-putting soft texture rather than a meaty consistency.\\n\\nHowever, the absolute worst part was the egg drop soup. First off, the soup came in a 1/2 pint container. In every Chinese restaurant I've ever ordered from, a small soup comes in a 1 pint container. This container looked like it should have contained duck sauce, not soup. Then, when I went to take a sip of soup...I realized that I was eating pure chicken fat.

I'm ashamed to say I've never been here before and I live only a few blocks away. After eating the appetizer, I told my girlfriend I felt silly for never having been. Then the entree came and I echoed the same sentiment. Dessert hit the table and I was saying it yet again. In short, it was an amazing meal. Let's talk about why:\\n\\n1. Love the vibe of the restaurant. We had the option of inside or outside. Even with the rain, we chose outside because they have heaters, blankets and it felt more intimate. The one thing I hate about Dine Out is that restaurants cram people in like caged chickens to maximize profit due to the low cost of the meals. Not here. There was ample seating, but we chose outside to be romantic (go us!). \\n\\n2. Our server was so casual, professional and friendly. He was great from start to finish.\\n\\n3. The food. The food was so good. The potato and leek soup was delicious and I'd eat that bacon and cheddar roll anytime. It wasn't too bacon-y (yes there's such a thing) and not too much cheddar. It had flavor but it wasn't overpowering.\\n\\nThe girlfriend's calamari was also delicious. I like the thick cut ones. It was also cooked perfectly and it wasn't oily. Everything about that dish was spot on.\\n\\nI got the poached ling cod and it was amazing. I usually don't like ordering seafood at non-seafood establishments but it was so good. That coconut curry complemented the fish so well, and that fish was cooked perfectly. That pickled fennel was so tasty and knocked out the fennel taste I usually hate. My only complaint is that I would prefer the bed of rice to be stickier like Chinese rice and not loose like basmati, but this is a personal preference since I like stickier rice to sop up the delicious coconut curry. \\n\\nMy girlfriend's ham hock orecchiette was so good too. I stole a few bites. The brussel sprouts really worked with the dish. I could have done without the shemiji mushrooms but again, that's just me.\\n\\nFor the dessert I thought I'd like the chocolate and orange tres leches cake but I was wrong. I stole my girlfriend's salted caramel and apple cheesecake instead. That thing was like a deconstructed apple pie. I shovelled that thing in my face so quickly. The cooked apples with the dried apple bits were a lovely contrast. I just can't speak highly enough about that dessert.\\n\\n4. Free parking for as far as the eye can see. Who doesn't love free parking? 2hr parking 9am-6pm and then however long you want outside those hours. \\n\\nFantastic first meal for Dine Out. If their \\"showcase\\" menu for Dine Out was this tasty, it makes me excited to try their regular menu in the future.

It was a dark and stormy night when I didn't feel like cooking.  I have heard so many awesome things about this place and it did not disappoint!  All pizzas are $10 and the perfect size for you.  They're a little bigger than  a personal pan but not quite  a medium, which is a size I think should have existed years ago.  I'm a pepperoni girl, so I went with a regular pepperoni and wow!  I liked a lot.  And I never thought I'd be one looking forward to crust, but this pizza is not one to forsake the crust, believe you me.\\n\\nIt's wayy small (I mean, considering it's in a convenience store) with three tables, but it feels cozy instead of cramped.  And the owners are so enthusiastic about sharing and being cozy with other people that you can't help but go with the emotion.  She (the lady owner) even told me she'd put my order in ahead of a big group since I was getting takeout so that I could be on my way.  Awesome customer service!  \\n\\nAnd I love being able to see the pizza cook in a brick oven, even more so when I'm sitting with some guy named Giovanni (seriously, it was better than it sounds!)  It takes a bit longer, but when you're able to be part of the cooking experience AND you know it's not like they're fooling around instead of making your food, it makes the experience doable for sure.\\n\\nI'll definitely be back and I'll probably be more adventurous with my next pizza order, especially with the 3 pizzas for $25 deal!"},{"name":"Relish","address":"6637 SE Milwaukie Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Came for a drink and appetizer on a Tuesday night.

I did however, help myself to my friend's cheddar grits. They cooled my mouth down while also exciting my taste buds. She had the breakfast oyster po-boy and seemed very happy with it. My other friend had the cathead biscuit sandwich, which was gigantic! The chicken was perfectly cooked and still moist with a nice peppery breading. Everything was just cooked and seasoned perfectly. It's definitely not diet food and you ideally want to split your meal with someone, we each left with a box. \\n\\nI will definitely be back to try the chicken and waffles, hello sweet potato waffle, and I really want to get on that dessert train.

I have to say the calamari appetizer was probably the best thing I ate all night - served with cold sesame noodles, it had a nice thai flavor to it.

No faults there.\\n\\nThe Bad.  Eh, everything else.  I am not a picky eater by any means, and when I have difficulty selecting an entree (i.e. \\"settle on\\" something), then I know there's trouble.  They had mostly standard items like a chicken, lamb, beef, fish, etc, but the sides they were paired with were less to be desired.  My husband settled on the lamb, which in itself was good, but the all-barley \\"risotto\\" with apricots and raisins was too sweet and really did not compliment the lamb at all.  I settled on the salmon, which was on the dry side, but in this case the side dish (mashed potato croquettes) was really good.

After checking out some of the reviews on yelp and the rave on http://pigtrip.net (a great resource for barbecue joints in the Northeast), I decided to try Soul Fire in 2009. and have been back since for more great food. \\n\\nSoul Fire feels spacious, especially on week nights, when there aren't a lot of people there.   There are high ceilings and a huge flat screen TV.   Even on busier nights, service has been friendly, helpful and prompt.\\n\\nPork ribs there have been as good as it as it gets in the Boston area.  Spare ribs and baby backs are infused with a fine smoke flavor and the rub adds to it.  The ribs needed no sauce, but I love to play around with sauces and even mix them up a bit.   On on visit, the ribs were so good I couldn't bring myself to put sauce on them. The \\"pit boss\\" and \\"soul fire\\" sauces were great, the sweet sauce wasn't much on its own, but was nice blended in with the other sauces.  The fiery sauce was a little hotter than I liked but blended with a little pit boss (or the sweet sauce) it was great.  The fiery saucet has some mustard in it and is like a kicked up version of Blue Ribbons golden sauce.   Fried Chicken, including the chicken wings was excellent - well worth ordering even if you love pork.   Barbecue chicken and pulled chicken sandwiches are also great - tender and flavorful.  The BBQ chicken is also great - I prefer the wings with the spicy honey barbecue, but if I'm getting a larger order I have them split it between the two sauces.\\n\\nSides were good to great.   The collards were really nicely prepared, but just a little too sweet for my liking the first time - but much better recently.   Barbecue beans are also very good.  Fries were nicely done.  Mashed potatoes and rice and beans have been solid, but not standouts.\\n\\nEverything benefited from being served on large plates, so that things were kept separate - unlike Redbones and Blue Ribbon where everything runs a bit into everything else before you get a chance to chow down.\\n\\nSoul Fire has a decent selection of beers, some on tap and they serve decent wine as well - though the drinks are definitely not the highlight of a visit here.\\n\\nWhile Soul Fire lacks the life and the funkiness of Redbones, it also lacks the crowds and the noise.  Soul Fire has definitely joined my list of top BBQ places in the area.   Next to try:  Blackstrap."},{"name":"Border Caf√©","address":"32 Church St","city":"Cambridge","stars":"4","text":"I like:\\n-Gulf Coast shrimp enchiladas \\n-crawfish etouffee\\n-melon margaritas\\n-sangria\\n-Crystal hot sauce\\n\\nI don't like:\\n-how you have to wait forever on weekend nights when school is in session."},{"name":"Seasons & Regions Seafood Grill","address":"6660 SW Capitol Hwy","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"Great place.

It wasn't bad though, we all the tried the donut first and it wasn't too sweet to where it would overpower the burger.  It was well cooked and rather tasty.

This older white woman looked disapprovingly at us and said \\"well we may still have a table for you but you will have to wait.\\"  I was thinking \\"OK, way to be welcoming\\" as she sent a younger white girl off to look for a table.  There were obviously multiple empty tables in the place, so not sure what the problem was.  After about 10 minutes she decided we weren't leaving, so she seated us and gave us menus.  We were looking for a drink menu but it wasn't provided, so my mom ran to the bar area to ask for a drink menu.

I give this a 5 star rating on the basis of ramen standards in Texas. Definitely the best place in Texas that I have tried so far. I've come to try pretty much everything on the menu so I figure its time to give the review a go.\\n\\nAppetizers are good but kinda pricey. Katsu sliders are amazing. Crispy and juicy on a hawaiian roll. The sweet and sour yodas are basically a sweeter soy sauce soaked brussel sprouts. They go good with ramen but can be too salty by themselves. Gyoza is gyoza. I find it hard to mess this up.\\n\\nOn to the ramen! My favorites are the Tonkotsu original, mi so hot, and tsukemen. The broth is very flavorful and not too thick. I still can't bring myself to drink all of it afterwards (mostly because I would like to retain bodily functions after my meal). The chasu is amazing and definitely the best out of all the ramen spots in town. Also that ajitama egg is ridic! The Mi so hot is a good a mix of heat and flavor. I found myself sweating a little bit. I like the idea of ground pork with this ramen and it works well. My only knock on the regular ramen is the noodles. I am not a fan of the hakata style of thinner noodles. On contrary the noodles that they use for the tsukemen (dipping ramen) are amazing. They are nice and thick which is needed to soak up the extra concentrated broth. I like eating the tsukemen when I don't feel like leaving the restaurant feeling semi bloated.\\n\\nLines are long so get there early or late. Lines out the door and the interior is not the largest place. You place your order at the counter then get sat down.

Fair enough, but who knew right?\\n\\nWe sat, looked over the drink and dinner menus.  After what seemed like ages our server Cathy Appears.  \\"What do you want to drink\\" she scowels at us. So my wife orders.  I couldn't as I hadn't looked  over the one drink menu we were given....  Hum, okay.  I ask her to come back in a couple minutes.  Then she returns and I order my drink.

But the waitress and hostess were two of the unfriendliest, unpersonable people I came in contact with during my stay. People have bad days, maybe we just caught them on one.

On weekend nights, this place gets packed. I went on a Thursday night and it was busy but not overly so. It does get a bit loud- the ambiance is more of a loud/crowd atmosphere. The tables are pretty packed in, and there is an upstairs and a downstairs. I always think that their seating method is weird- when you walk in, the hostess will give you a slip of paper, tell you to go downstairs and hand it to the downstairs hostess.\\n\\nThey give you a free basket of chips and some salsa. We ordered fried shrimp for an appetizer (amazing, I actually want more). The sauce was delicious. My friend ordered a fish (which she said she enjoyed) and I ordered fajitas. I told him that I couldn't eat dairy, and he actually went back into the kitchen and asked them in detail about dairy. He was worried because they cooked in butter- but I told him a little wouldn't hurt me, as long as I didn't eat a lot of creamy sauce or a hunk of cheese, I'd be okay. I was really appreciative of the fact that he went out of his way for me. My chicken fajitas were basic and good, and I couldn't finish them. But to be honest, it is pretty hard to mess up fajitas. I also ordered 2 Patron Margaritas- and they were amazingly delicious and made me happy. \\n\\nAfter the meal, we went to the bathroom, and it smelled so strongly of vomit, that we had to leave the bathroom immediately to stop from throwing up ourselves from the smell.

Here's my take:\\n\\nTHE GOOD:\\n\\nChips and onion dip appetizer. Because of course.\\n\\nThe striped bass crudo. Hot damn. I like crudo well enough, but it has never been a must-order for me. This dish may have changed that. The roasted strawberries were what made it, providing a counterbalance to the salt of the fish and onion oil. \\n\\nWonder bean succotash: This dish was fantastic. The shrimp were amazing, the vegetables were astoundingly fresh and vibrant, and the crema tying it all together sealed the deal.\\n\\nPickled corn pancakes: My favorite of the night. I had my doubts, but I saw that this was the most popular dish on the menu other than the \\"secret burger.\\" It blew me away. The pancakes were pure butter, but with a unique tangy flavor from the pickled corn. The shishito peppers and tart maple yogurt were very complementary, and the popcorn added a necessary textural element.\\n\\n 16-hour coppa: This is a unique dish, as they sous-vide the coppa. Typically a cured meat, the coppa is then seared. The hunks of meat are fork tender, salty, and great with the cherry vinaigrette on the plate.\\n\\nThe apple pie dessert: It's your own made-to-order apple pie with salted vanilla ice cream. It's also hotter than the surface of a red dwarf star, so be careful.\\n\\nTHE NOT AS GOOD:\\n\\nCrispy baby bok choi: Shame on me for this one. I really wanted the sous vide egg. And I love bok choi. I assumed \\"crispy\\" meant sauteed or something, but the dish was deep fried. It was also a bit bitter for my taste, and dry since there is only so much egg yolk to go around. But again, I should have done my homework.\\n\\nBerkshire pork belly: Crucify me if you will, but I wasn't a big fan of the pork belly. The crispy skin was nearly impenetrable (even with a knife) and the grape agrodolce was -I thought- too sweet. Seriously, the skin (which I typically love) was filling-destroying levels of thickness. It was hard to chew and harder to cut. The flavor of the pork was great, and I love Anson Mills' grits, but the texture of the pork skin and the grape agrodolce didn't vibe with me.\\n\\nAll in all, I'm definitely going back. The menu is inventive, local, and exciting. I had two dishes out of 8 that weren't great. One was a stupid order on my part (bok choi) and the other had great flavor, but was just difficult to consume (belly). I'm definitely going back for brunch ASAP to fill up on a secret burger, pancakes, and a cocktail."},{"name":"Cocotte","address":"2930 NE Killingsworth St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"I wanted to love it. I really did. And I wish I could go with 3.5 stars, but between \\"A-OK\\" and \\"Yaay, I'm a fan\\"... it's perfectly fine, but doesn't inspire me to fan-dom.\\n\\nI'd wanted to try Cocotte for a long time - it's an adorable, intimate space, and there were some high points, without a doubt. The service was fantastic - genuinely warm & helpful, yet unobtrusive, just the way I like it. \\n\\nFood-wise, they were definitely strongest in the appetizers & desserts, which is generally a decent recipe for at creating an overall positive memory of the meal, but I just wasn't over-the-moon enough about anything to forget about the misses. \\n\\nThe breakdown:\\nAppetizers: Chicken liver mousse & compound butter.  As the mousse goes, I'm pretty much always a fan, and theirs didn't disappoint. The real standout was the compound butter. Like previous reviewers, we had the tomato-nicoise, and it was exceptional. My only complaint about the appetizers was the inappropriately small portion of bread. In their defense, we didn't request more, but neither was it offered, and the ratios were pretty out-of-whack for 4 people & all those spreadables.\\n\\nSalads: Strawberry salad & beet salad. Both were fantastic, without qualification. 'Nough said.\\n\\nEntrees: The whole trout was the big winner, super tender, cooked just right, with a slight smokiness. Alas, it was not mine, and it's owner was smart enough not to share much. \\nThe pork tenderloin was good, though we were put off by a lingering concern that it might be a little under-cooked. The presentation was lovely, though, and the cherries that accompanied it was fantastic, and a perfect compliment. \\nAlas, the chicken with poached egg & the clams, which a friend & I shared, were the big \\"mehs\\" on the table. These are items I routinely make at home, so if I order them out, I'm expecting fantastic roast chicken. And there are many of those around. But this was just fine. And they'd made the odd decision to include a whole, uncooked radish with the roasted veggies which was jarring to bite into at best. The clams were a ditto on \\"fine\\" - give me Laurelhurst Market mussels or the mussels & clams at Branch any day of the week.\\n\\nDessert: We all shared the dessert special, which was a peanut-butter cheesecake semi-freddo, which was exceptional - decadent & totally delicious, yet still not without it's caveats. It came topped with jam which, while fantastic, really should have been mentioned in the description, as it was at least as dominant a flavor as the peanut butter (and much more so than the cheesecake, which wasn't detectable in either taste or the more pound cake-type presentation).\\n\\nSo, there. It's a perfectly fine meal, with elements that were fantastic, and I'm rooting for them. And I will absolutely try their brunch, and go back for happy hour, as it's a steal for the quality of appetizers on offer. But for a full-fledged night out, we're lucky enough to live in a city with an embarrassment of truly transcendent meals in the $50/head range, and this just isn't one of them."},{"name":"Aria","address":"490 E Paces Ferry Rd NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Chef Justin White surprised me big time by booking the wine cellar table downstairs for our 5-6 month anniversary! We were originally suppose to go in December, but I got sick, so we tried again in January and it all worked out this time. This has been on my list since I started hearing about it. A lot of people say Aria is the \\"BEST\\" restaurant in fine dining in Atlanta. It was my first fine dining experience and I tried so many new foods for the first time. Everything tasted amazing. \\n\\nThe restaurant itself looks very small when you walk in and sit at the bar, but there is ample seating in the back. The bar itself is upscale and fun. I loved the music they played all night in the background. Some of it had an international feel, but all of it had an ambient feel. I love upbeat, but relaxing. We sat at the bar for a little while until our table was ready. I'm not sure the bartender's name, but he did an awesome job! I got the \\"The Maximilian Affair\\" which had tequila, lemon, grenadine, among other liqueurs at first. Later I had tried \\"The Scofflaw\\" which had Whiskey, grenadine, lemon, among other liqueurs, which was also amazing, but I did like The Maximilian Affair better. THe bartender did an awesome job on both. Chef Justin White got a Western IPA which he enjoyed. We then proceeded to the downstairs room where our table was. The experience was very romantic too sitting in the wine cellar room. Servers occasionally would come by to get wine for patrons, but there is only one table downstairs and so it was very intimate. It was dark with several candles lit everywhere. Our server's name was Chris and he did an amazing job. His timing to check on us was always perfect and he planned the meal timing wise perfectly with all the dishes that we got on the tasting menu plus the couple of extra dishes we added. \\n\\nNow that I've written about the awesome service, awesome drinks, and awesome atmosphere, let me write about the awesome food. Sorry about the pictures. It was hard to get good pictures with my camera, but luckily Daniel took awesome pictures already of the food.\\n\\n1) Celery Root Soup. Amazing! It is famous for being creamless, but it tastes so creamy. Chef Justin White was telling me how they make an emulsion to give it a creamy taste. It was one of the best soups I've ever had. I think the black truffle was really prominent in the soup and made it really good. Soak it in their fluffy bread to make it even better.\\n\\n2) Tempura Octopus - The vinaigrette in this is very light and sweet. It came with a frisee salad with butternut squash. It was a candied ginger dressing so it complimented the dish well. It also had toasted peanuts and of course the octopus tempura which was amazing and crisp. The cheese they used was mizuna and had a little bit of Fuji apples.\\n\\n3) Blue Ridge Mountain Trout - the interesting part of this dish is how it is cooked so that you can eat both the skin and the fish. \\n\\n4) South Carolina Quail - This was my first time trying quail! I enjoyed theirs a lot. It was fried with a different salad with it. The only criticism I had about anything that we ate was that the bacon on the salad that came with this was a little hard and chewy so a little difficult to eat, but it gave the dish a nice contrast to the other soft vegetables with the fingerling potatoes and onions.\\n\\n5) Foie Gras - This was my first time trying foie gras which I learned is made from duck liver. The dish came with vanilla pudding, apples with a red-wine vinaigrette, and bruschetta. It was very rich and it complimented the sides really well. I think I should have tried this with some bread, but instead I tasted it alone again and again to really learn about the flavor.\\n\\n6) Painted Hills Ranch Natural Beef Short Ribs - This is a signature dish of Aria. I enjoyed how soft the ribs were and the sauce it came with complimented it really well. The butternut squash on this was fresh and perfectly seasoned. This was an amazing addition to our meal\\n\\n7) Venison - The vension that we had was actually from New Zealand and it was my first time trying vension. I believe it was medium rare and that was good to be able to taste the flavor. It was presented well and cut into pieces easy to eat. It also came with broccoli and carrots. \\n\\n8) Goat cheesecake & Chocolate Meringue - We asked for a cheesecake for one of us instead of the meringue so we could try both desserts. The goat cheesecake was awesome! I have never had a cheesecake made of goat cheese. Regular cheesecake is great, but this wasn't overwhelming like regular cheesecake and it came with whip cream. The chocolate meringue had a espresso-tasting, very rich, gelato-texture on top with wafers and a decadent chocolate inside the wafers. It was a great end to the meal and they even wrote \\"Happy 5 months anniversary\\" on the plates for us."},{"name":"Olive Garden Italian Restaurant","address":"11B Allstate Rd","city":"Dorchester","stars":"2","text":"Ok so my husband and I are avid Olive Garden fans.... at any other Olive Garden then this one.

Basically the service here is absolutely terrible and it seems that they are not trained at all on customer service or what it means to be a server.

If you want to be treated like dirt and be aggravated your entire meal then you should come here.\\n\\nAnd to the girl who gave this a good review, and blasted the rest of the bad reviewers you must have gone to wrong place.

At 8:40.  Poke-e Jo's closes at 9, and we live about 5 minutes away.\\n\\nI arrive at 8:53.  After ordering and walking to the car and so on, it took 15 minutes from the call to walking into the restaurant.

They had run out of turkey, so I had to choose a different meat.  They put it in a small Styrofoam ramekin cup...which yielded about an ounce of meat.  Plus, it was luke-warm and watery.  (I have no idea how it got watery...I didn't taste it.)  The salad was brown, and the \\"Texas Fries\\" were stringy and cold...and thrown in the big bag, not the to-go container.  \\n\\nSo, for $45 (including a 15% tip) we got a few ounces of meat, cold bag fries, wilted lettuce, and several small ramekins of random food. \\n\\nI've worked restaurants...yes, it sucks when someone comes in last-minute.

The overall atmosphere was great--soft live guitar music, small venue to keep the noise down, attractive paintings on the walls.  The devil is in the details.  Some examples:  1)  Lots of mention of bread served with the meal, but bread comes on the plate with the individual meal ordered, not in a bread basket. 2) Lots of mention of gluten-free options, but I when asked for gluten-free, the option was to be  served my individual meal without bread, presumably with no reduction in the price of the meal.  Later, when cued, the waitress remembered there was a gluten-free bread option, but failed to say that it costs $1 per slice!  You only know what the charge is because the plate you ordered shows up as being $2 higher on your bill than the listed price on the menu. (If you request gluten-free bread you automatically receive two small slices on your plate with your main dish.)  3) Although the bread slices were small, they did a good job of hiding the \\"seasonal vegetables\\"  which were 4 50-cent sized slices of squash stacked on top of each other covered with cheese(?) And 3 cashews--gone in two bites.  4) This was on the seared tuna plate, along with one chunk of tomato and one slice of zucchini on lettuce greens without salad dressing of any kind offered, added or received.  As reported elsewhere the tuna was slightly tough, but otherwise tasty.  5) Water was served without ice and without lemon.  6)  My husband ordered the coq au vin stew, which came with more slices of bread but without a salad, even though the high cost of this choice suggested a fuller, more balanced dinner.

The sides (the special came with baked beans and slaw) were nothing special, but I didn't mind because the meat was the star.  A good selection of craft drafts and the beer was cold.

Bar-B-Q","address":"1238 Dekalb Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4.5","text":"My family was there on July 29, a Tuesday. Hit it for late lunch around 2pm... perhaps that sets up why we got seating quickly, and though their parking lot of full, the restaurant wasn't. It seems that everyone will have a take on parking and how it affects a restaurant.\\n\\nHere's mine: dumb luck. Over the years, if I want to go to a restaurant that I believe I will enjoy, hopefully they have enough parking, or maybe I don't go. But, I don't gig the business on that. Sorry. Sometimes I just never go somewhere because of the parking, but to suggest they should move somewhere else! This place, I'll give it a dive++, as it's a BBQ spot. It's got solid character, and I went here because Dave's BBQ, the Outback, etc.. been there, done that. I don't have to leave home to go to those kind of places. And even those made for TV restaurants get busy at mealtime and it's tough to park, so now what!\\n\\nSorry for the rant, if a restaurant is so busy I can't even park, I will move on because I don't wait long to eat. I just come back later if I really want to try a place. So I guess we lucked out hitting a late lunch, because I didn't know any better not to eat at a real lunch time.\\n\\nI would have lost out because the place is cool, casual and fitting, inside or outside seating, with attentive service, great selections and real smoked meat. \\nI have been to enough BBQ places that don't seem to have a smoker.... so their meats might be tender, but where's the flavor?\\n\\nNice selection of craft beers included, which is needed for me with the strong smokey meal choices. First, a recommendation by our server, was an order of wings. Now, i wasn't really there for wings, but since they were smoked, we tried a serving. (OK, it turned into two servings). They were very much UNlike all the other bar wings I have ever had. Killer sauce, and it's not about being a hot wing. They were smoked, fried for one minute to crisp them up, and served with a BBQ sauce. Outstanding... and a new appreciation for wings (they just aren't for breakfast any longer). So our server knew her menu (big PLUS for her).\\n\\nSo our group of four had a chance to try the brisket, some on buns, mine was chopped. VERY, very good, as tender as can be. The side we had were all great: beans, slaw... believe there were deep fried okra and pickles involved. Believe was also got the jalapeno corn bread, and the Mac n Cheese as sides. Everything was tasty. We never got to dessert, we had tried to eat smart, but the portions were healthy enough to not even jones over any dessert.\\n\\nEe are not restaurant critics, but still have expectations of some kind of decent, competent service, food that has a quality and decent quantity; Fox Bros made my day. No check errors, the server kept tabs on us (and perhaps the BBQ bottles so I wouldn't abscond with them)... all was well. We never felt rushed, but we did miss the \\"rush\\" that everyone else has described.\\n\\nI never get into my \\"best\\", or the \\"best\\"... it's a worthless game unless you are being served your last meal, and by then, you really have other things to worry about. BUT, if you want a real authentic BBQ place, that offers you a solid selection of food, drinks, has a real relaxing atmosphere and reasonably priced and does it all very well, then Fox Bros is for you. I unfortunately am from out of town, so it's a treat I will have to wait for later return."},{"name":"Ramen Tatsu-Ya","address":"8557 Research Blvd, Ste 126","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"What a wonderful birthday dinner!

The candied bacon was good as well but could be better with thicker bacon, a little more sweet than savory and I prefer the later.

I was disappointed to learn that the website language was a little unclear about reservations.  They only reserve for 9:30 AM OR 1:00 PM, not for times between 9:30 AM-1:00 PM.  The reservation person only works an 8 hr shift, so you better reserve 24 hours in advance and for a party of at least 4 or 6.  Note that parties with more than 6 people automatically get charged gratuity.  Price of meals range from $15-$20, and a bit more (~$3+) if you want extras of anything.\\n\\nIt's far easier to get a seat if you're willing to sit at the bar.  Their bar is quite long and seats quite a few people.  It sits as many people at the bar as it does on tables, due to the long and narrow layout of the space.  The kitchen is open concept so you get to watch the folks at work.  Their reservation system when you get into the restaurant isn't bad.  They text you when your table is being setup and allow you to go walk around the neighbourhood.\\n\\nUnfortunately we were with my mum-in-law, who walks with a cane and taking a 30 minute walk around the neighbourhood would be difficult for her.  There isn't much space to sit around to wait for the table, only two chairs at the entrance.  Standing at any other spot, you are in the way of the servers.\\n\\nWe eventually got seated at a table for our party of 4.  We waited for our food, and it turned out that the waiter had forgotten to enter in our order for the kitchen, but did take it down.  They gave us complimentary appetizer of nachos and a bit of salsa when they noticed we still haven't received our food, and offered to discount our bill for the inconvenience plus rush our order.  The waiter who took our order also apologized profusely.\\n\\nThe food was excellent.  Very tasty.  I had ordered a side of hashbrowns and avocado and was pretty full after my dish of \\"Divorced Eggs\\".  Hashbrowns were great to dip in the leftover sauce on my platter.  In fact, it was perfectly cooked hasbrowns in my opinion.  Crispy on the outside, soft on the inside.\\n\\nAfter that experience, I would still recommend the restaurant because I felt that they really cared about their guest's experience, taking full ownership their actions.

Unfortunately, both of those claims are EXTREMELY MISLEADING.  In fact, I've never been to a restaurant that so blatantly misrepresented the deal that they were, in fact, offering.  It left me feeling like I was tricked into eating there, which quite frankly is a bizarre experience to have at any restaurant.\\n\\nFirst, let me say that the tapas here are delicious little bites of Mexican-inspired fried shrimp, goat cheese quesadillas, homemade chorizos, shredded chicken taquitos, and grilled pork eggrolls.  However, what they say are \\"50 cent tapas\\" actually means that you have to buy their $10 tapas combo platter (with 10 tapas items on it) for $5.  Which is absolutely 100% worth it in my book, but there are no tapas on the menu at all that are available for 50 cents, so that was my first raised eyebrow at their sketchy advertising.\\n\\nMy second raised eyebrow, which was accompanied by a complaint to the manager for the blatant lie that is their advertisement, is the fact that their $5 pitchers of sangria are actually small, 1 and a half glass-size pitchers rather than the larger, 5-glass pitchers we were served.  Although the bartenders are supposed (according to the manager) to tell the customers the difference between the TWO sizes of sangria pitchers they offer, ours did not, and we ended up unwittingly ordering FIVE PITCHERS of a mediocre sangria that cost not 5, but $24 EACH.  So you can imagine our surprise when we received a bill not for $25 for drinks, but 120 freakin' dollars!!  Damn, people!  For that price I could have had at least 4 bottles of a decent wine, not a watered-down, Franzia-ass, no-fruit-included decanter of sangria.\\n\\nAnyways, after our complaint the manager did take one of the pitchers off our bill, but really, the reason we went to Masa was because in this economy, we are on a tight budget, and can't be affording this kind of shiznit.  Even paying $95 for drinks would be out of the question had we been given the choice!  So, while I thought their tapas were delish (and thus the 2 stars), I just can't get the bad taste of this visit out of my mouth."},{"name":"Franklin Barbecue","address":"900 E 11th St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"Im a Fan, Decent BBQ.

I chose the Midtown Dog w/ shoestring fries, and the hot dog itself was high quality beef (in my best Bobby Boucher *Waterboy* voice).

I've always gotten the Fried Oysters Benedict with their Bloody Mary. The Fried Oysters Benedict is spicy, lightly fried and with a well-executed poached egg, you can't go wrong. The Bloody Mary has a unique twist in that it's made with Cajun/Creole seasoning so it has this extra bit of kick that goes extremely well with any breakfast item.\\n\\nThe first time I came here, the service was wonderful. We were seated, ordered our food, and our food came out promptly half an hour later. However, this time, was another story. \\n\\nWe were seated in the first wave of hungry patrons. Drinks came quickly and our order was taken down. However we noticed that our food was taking a bit long. Tables that arrived after us received their food first. Please note that our server barely checked in on us. \\n\\nAt this point, we waited an hour for the food. \\n\\nOur food did eventually come but the order was wrong. And we were missing hot sauce at our table. Not to mention, the server was a bit snippy with us for pointing this out. To be quite honest, once you wait 45 minutes in line just to be seated and another hour just to eat, it's rather poor judgment to take out your frustrations with the kitchen to your paying customers. But, I digress!\\n\\nWhat saved this review was two things: the food and the owner/manager. The manager heard what had happened to our table and comp'ed our meal. Her gracious attitude and demeanor bumped this up from a two star review to a four star review. \\n\\nTIP: To be in the first wave of those who are seated, arrive at least 30-45 minutes prior to opening.

It has a pool and sauna.  There's a restaurant right in the lobby but you're within walking distance to Wendy's, Red Robins and Denny's so it's pretty convenient.  It's not the most romantic place if you're looking for peace, quiet and a chance to sleep in.

The staff is very friendly and welcoming.  They were very helpful and I have no complaints about them.  My biggest concern is that they do not allow the option to self-park in their garage on the weekends.  This is the worst idea ever.  I don't mind the overpriced $21 overnight parking rate if they had the option to self park.  I DO mind having to wait for 2 people to deal with 12 cars waiting for valet in a tiny space.  Why wouldn't they schedule more valet attendants to deal with valet during check in time if this was the only option?  It was so inconvenient that we ended up paying for street meter parking, checking in and put our stuff away.

I like (some) kitsch. I like dark hidey-holes.  But this place is ridiculous.  It's as if 40 TGI Friday's worth of wall junk were tossed into every available corner, nook, cranny, shelf, socket, wall, floor, ceiling, and cubby.  And it did not appear that many of these things had been dusted in the past month.  (or longer.)\\n\\nWe arrived at noon on a Saturday.  Walking in, you see a \\"Seat Yourself\\" sign.  Okay.  We wander to a booth, where there is a lime green laminated sign: \\"Self Service. Order your drinks at the bar and food and the kitchen!\\"  Ohhhhhhhkayy.  Let me say that at this point, I'm still okay with this. It's a dive, it's student-oriented, and it's gotten glowing reviews. So we peruse the menu and decide on 2 burgers.\\n\\nThe Sourdough Burger:  (Touted on the menu as:) Grilled Onions, Pickles, Melted Cheddar, Spicy Mayo on Grilled Sourdough.  \\nThe \\"Grilled Onions\\" consisted (literally) of 3 \\"strips\\" perhaps 2-3 inches long of a single strand of partially translucent onion.  The pickles were actually larger than both the onions AND the burger patty.\\nThe patty is reported at 1/3 lb. This was the size of a McDonald's hamburger.  It did not even cover HALF of the \\"Sourdough Toast\\"  (We actually cut the toast in half and left a full half of empty sandwich behind.  The \\"Spicy Mayo\\"?  It was Yellow Mustard with Chopped Pickles mixed in.  Delicious.  Not.\\n\\nThe French Fries:  I have yet to ever see an establishment that can properly cook, season, and serve \\"Curly Fries\\" quickly enough to get them to the customer before that 30-second-window of Hot goes out the door.  This was no different.  The fries were indeed curly, but also lukewarm, somewhat soggy, and unflavorful.\\n\\nThe Second Burger:\\n\\nThe Dark Horse actually stepped it up a bit with this one.  This is one of their more quirky house burgers, served on a regular hamburger bun:\\n\\nFried Egg and Ham Burger:  (Touted on the menu as:) Smoked Ham, an Egg Fried to Order & American Cheese.\\nIt arrived hot and looked larger than the other patty, probably because it fit the bun.  The \\"Fried Egg\\" was a bit overdone, having hardly any \\"ooze\\" of yolk, being mostly hard-cooked.  It did have a large portion of sliced, smoked ham, and a slice of cheese, all of which would have melded wonderfully if the yolk had been \\"oozy\\" enough to meld.  The patty itself was cooked perfectly, however, juicy and absolutely \\"Medium\\"  (Though we were never asked how we would like them cooked, and both patties were cooked differently)  The burger also (surprise!) came with lettuce, tomato, and red onion.  While all 3 looked fresh, I'm not sure where they quite fit in with the Egg and Ham, and they were not mentioned on the menu description.  We removed them.\\n\\nAll burgers come with a choice of a Green Salad, Pasta Salad, or Fries, and are about $7.  \\n\\nTo me, that seems expensive for what turned out to be mediocre food, no service (you serve yourself), and a dingy, dirty environment.\\n\\nI guess if I were a starving student, I might be inclined to brave the crowds on Happy Hour nights, where students can, for roughly $4, get a Burger, Fries, and a Drink... and sometimes watch other Drunken Starving Students attempt to ride tricycles through the restaurant.\\n\\nBut for a hamburger?

But while it's loaded with a lot of noodles and a modest amount of chicken, the noodles are bland and the teriyaki just tastes weird.

My mom and I ordered smoked portobello sandwiches upon the waitress' recommendation, and asked her to please make sure they were vegan. I'm pretty sure she did. Unfortunately, the person who prepared one of the sandwiches put mayonaise in it. It was probably a mistake as they don't get many vegan customers but once we pointed it out to her she apologized repeatedly, and told the owner.

I've been a reader on Yelp for quite some time, but had such a bad experience at Wild Horse Cafe that I felt compelled to sign up and weigh in. \\n\\nI had been to Wild Horse twice before, and had a decent experience. But all of that was erased when my inlaws wanted to take my wife and I out to dinner and we decided Wild Horse was the place to go. \\n\\nFirst off, they were out of Iced tea. Not only were they out of iced tea, but the server said, I'll have to check and see if have any, we were out last night. So this \\"fine dining\\" restaurant was out of iced tea two nights in a row? How hard is it to go out and buy some tea and brew it if you run out? Jeez. Also, they didn't have any bottled sparkling water. Strike two. I wanted two fairly common beverages and they didn't have either. \\n\\nThen the food. I was stoked to see a straight up chicken dinner on the menu. I LOVE chicken. Especially with mashed potatoes and gravy, so when I saw it on the menu I knew that's what I would order. Boy do I wish I hadn't. It was DISGUSTING. It tasted like they'd brined it in salt water for a week. And if something is too salty for me, that's saying something. I love salt. I salt everything, even if its already salty. Additionally, the vegetables were greasy and not evenly cooked and the stuffing tasted like sour and smelled rancid. I didn't touch it after the first bite. \\n\\nNow normally, I would send the plate back right away. And probably walk out. But I was so embarrassed that my wife and I had suggested this restaurant to our inlaws, I didn't want them to think we were having a bad time. Eventually, my mother in law noticed I wasn't really eating and asked me what was wrong. I told her the chicken was a little too salty for my taste. She tasted it and immediately spit it into her napkin. At that point I decided I better pass some feedback along to our server. \\n\\nWhile we were waiting for her to finally come back, my mother in law asked me if I thought there was anything off about her lentils. I tasted them and they were very undercooked. Not al dente. Just not cooked enough. And her lamb chops were served in large chunks that were hard to cut up and eat. \\n\\nFinally, the server arrived and I told her that my chicken was too salty and basically inedible and could she pass it along to the chef. She said \\"I'll see what they want to do about it.\\" No apology, nothing. Then she began to clear, and took to other dishes off the table and left the disgusting food sitting in front of me. \\n\\nShe delivered the check without a word, and we left without a single apology, nothing taken off the bill (which I didn't really care about, but thought it might be how they handled things instead of having the manager or chef come out to address the problem). But no. Nothing. I don't think I've ever had a worse experience in a restaurant. I've gotten bad food. I've gotten bad service. But usually not food that might as well be garbage and such completely indifferent service in one go. \\n\\nI could not be more embarrassed about bringing my in laws there. They paid $19 for that pile of garbage I was served. Ridiculous. I will never go there again."},{"name":"South City Kitchen Midtown","address":"1144 Crescent Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4.5","text":"Right when I took the first bite of the fried chicken, I got up threw my napkin, stripped off all my clothes, punched the guy next to me and ran out the street butt naked screaming how good it was\\n\\nThen I got arrested, but this place was AWESOME"},{"name":"Sugar Factory","address":"8371 International Dr, Ste 70","city":"Orlando","stars":"3","text":"We had a day in Orlando and wanted to hang out somewhere, and wait for traffic to die down a bit.

I think Fat Matt's is one of the most authentic experiences I've found.\\n\\nIt's a tiny little space with live blues music at night. It makes for a great lively atmosphere, but because of the small space, it's not an ideal place to take a date or a some buddies unless all you plan on doing is eating and listening to the music. Personally, I like to hear myself think, so while I enjoyed the music while I was waiting for my food, I had to take my order to go. There is limited seating outside though, and had there been room, I would have eating outside. But there wasn't.\\n\\nI ordered the chopped pork sandwich, the rum baked beans, the mac & cheese, and a half slab of ribs. Also, a lemonade.\\n\\nThe chopped pork sandwich was DELICIOUS. The run baked beans were great too. I didn't care for the mac & cheese that much. And while the ribs were tender, I was actually kind of full but couldn't finish the ribs because I had had my fill of the BBQ sauce. It's an interesting problem - the sauce is good, but only in moderation. At a certain point, the vinegar gets to you and you kind of get sick of the BBQ sauce. \\n\\nTo me, this is not a sign of a good sauce. I've known sauces that are so good that I really can't get enough of it. So good that'd I'd drink it. So good that I'd slather everything I possibly could on it. The fact that I got tired of this sauce makes it not that great of a sauce in my book. No question it was good at first though.\\n\\nThe big surprise for me though was how good the lemonade was! I was expecting some sort of minute maid, hi-c type drink, but the lemonade here was so good. Unlike the BBQ sauce, I couldn't get enough of it. I practically drank a whole cup while I was waiting for my food so that I could refill before I left. \\n\\nOverall, a great experience.

Well, if you are looking for that light meal, this place may have your answer. I thought I had a pretty good and almost memorable light meal. \\n\\nThe salads, although they are kind of expensive at around $8-9 per plate and the portions are somewhat meager, are deliciously excellent. The Little Gem Leaves and the Kale salads have great flavor and the texture of the lettuce and kale were very fresh. As for entrees, at around $15+ per plate, the Chicken Fried Local Rabbit and the Slow Roasted Beef Neck were tasty. The rabbit had a nice crispy texture while the beef had a nice flavor. The ingredients used definitely gave these dishes a fairly unique but delicious flavor. These four dishes shared with two people should be enough for a light early dinner before eating a heartier late night meal and the final bill is not too expensive at around $50. \\n\\nService was pretty good, and I thought one of the servers had a great countenance.  This place is at a pretty good location in Cambridge and when I walked in, I felt like I was in a better place such as New York City or San Francisco. The interior was very comfortable, and a little sophisticated. You could wear something very casual, but you may have to look classy in the process. They do take reservations, but they started taking them after 9:45 PM, so it's better to come early as possible. \\n\\nOverall, if this place continues to be consistently good, I think this place has a good chance to be an excellent restaurant.

My palette was not jolted to life because of anything I had.  Our party of 4 was seated promptly and we sat towards the back.  My biggest con of the night:  being seated directly behind someone else's seat.  Every time they moved their chair, I was pushed into the table.  It happened not once, not twice, but five times. If I was pushed any further, my head would have been in the wall.  Granted the space is small, but the restaurant does not necessarily have to fill it to capacity just because they can.\\n\\nLet's move on to the food:  I started with the duck confit and a wedge of brie.  The size of the brie wedge was so miniscule, I could barely locate the wedge with my knife after circling the plate a number of times.  I think it got lost in my forest of arugula.  My friend had the lox starter, which was good, but I can get that any where, Brueggers? Shaw's?  The scallops looked good, but there were only 2 scallops on the plate...so I thought it would be best if I didn't ask to try one of his scallops.\\n\\nFor dinner, I chose to go with the guinness soaked braised short ribs. Again, it was just okay. I thought it would be interesting or have some kind of surprising flavor. Yet...I was unenthused.

Amazing for those of us who's perfect cure for a long layover is some food, drinks and Netflix! \\n\\nI also had the best time with the staff here who seemed fun and happy to sit and chat for a bit, genuinely enjoying their jobs instead of being just on the clock.

This may have explained the seasoning on the food as I go into my review. \\n\\nMilestone 229 has got to be perfectly placed right by the river. Not only is it built to enjoy the views of the river, the inside and outside deck are quite beautiful with it's curved design. It had very modern touches and even the front side outside was impressive. We were promptly seated by the staffed  and our server was also very friendly. \\n\\nWe decided to go with the Hungry Like a Wolf Sandwich and the Chicken Breast for our entrees. The food came about 15 or so minutes after we ordered. My only complaint was I personally felt my chicken was way over seasoned and the fries on the sandwich plat were also overly salty. Almost as if the chef went a little too heavy handed. The weird pet was the sandwich was perfectly seasoned and so were my sides. So there seemed to be some inconsistency in the seasoning, but I think to be fair the kitchen was probably starting to shut down for the night as I stared at the top of my review. \\n\\nI think the restaurant is still worth a visit and would recommend it.

We were lucky to be under the overhang seeing it was the same weekend a massive storm hit Austin and Houston which flooded the area. But that morning no rain in sight! To be honest, our 5 hour wait wasn't that bad and it was probably because we were able to sit on lawn/camping chairs and had our phones the whole time (btw, there's a pretty good amount of chairs to borrow and I noticed that the chair bin became empty around 9-10am). By 8am, Franklin BBQ let us use their bathrooms and the coffee cart in the parking lot was open. We were given the estimated time to chow between 12-12:30pm, which was pretty accurate since we got our food around 12:15pm. \\n\\nSince I dragged my bf at the crack of dawn to eat here, we went a little crazy and bought 12lbs of meat (YES, 12 POUNDS) including a potato salad side and the bourbon banana pie.

I must say, the meat still tasted pretty good the next day/refrigerated. Surprisingly, the best meat out of it all turned out to the be the turkey!!

I love the pulled pork sandwich with pickles on the side. Their potato salad has enough crunch, taste, and texture, without the usual cole slaw/potato salad faux-pas of mayonnaise overload!! My boyfriend gets a combo platter: ribs and chicken. Last time he swooned over how juicy and delicious the chicken was. I love the cornbread square and pat of butter, and no matter how full I am I always manage to devour my boyfriend's baked beans. \\n\\nOne note: the macaroni and cheese struck me as a little Kraft-y. As in, the cheese was neon yellow and tasted 3 molecules away from plastic. The potato chips encrusting the top... I can see the appeal of that.

My friends and I sampled six different cocktails over the course of the night (Joan Collins, Ivana, Locklear, gimlet style drink with grapefruit cordial, the gin and vodka special of the night, and a bartenders choice). I feel harsh saying this, but none of them were good! They were all okay. Drinkable. But if I had mixed any of them myself at home, I woulda tossed them down the drain and tried again. The right idea was there, but the execution was a little ham handed. Many were too sweet, one was too dry, one somehow managed to do both at the same time. From some low-brow college bar, sure. But I expected more from a place that specializes in craft cocktails (with prices that reflect a certain level of expertise).\\n\\nMy husband switched to wine, which was also bad (Pinot noir), to the point that we were trying to figure out if the bottle may have turned. \\n\\nI'm quite sorry for the lackluster review. I know most people have had great drinks here, so maybe the bar was just having an off night.

In the case of Tasty Burger, there is one vegetarian burger option. It's made of mushroom and is actually one of the better burgers I've had. Not In-N-Out good, but something I wouldn't mind eating again if, say, a group of friends all voted on eating there. I also helps that it's super cheap, so you don't feel like you are overpaying for a Morningstar burger or anything. Fries and onion rings are good - I really like that the onion rings are stringy and thin. I love that you can get a 50/50 basket, but good luck finishing it. I think more than half the basket was left intact, even with 3 people sharing it. Next time, I think I'm going to go for the hummus, guacamole and chips. I hear good things. The shake was also good - exactly what you would expect. I shared it with friend and it was more than enough. \\n\\nWhat really helps give this place 3 stars instead of two is the ambiance. Cool art on the walls. The space sort of mimics the gas station it used to be - there is a garage door that opens in warmer weather. But they've redone it to have just the right touch of retro and the right touch of cool and modern. There's also a pool table and a TV in the back area. When I went, the parking was free, so that was an added bonus. Though $6 is still pretty cheap for Fenway during a game. \\n\\nOverall, I'm not dying to go back.

I mean, when portion size is the biggest plus of the meal I think there's an issue. Not to say it was a bad experience, but for $25 a person dinner there are other places I will go next time. Here's why:\\n\\nThe atmosphere of this restaurant is best described as confused. Somewhere between diner, grandma's house, and nice casual. I liked the idea if the patio seating but found the chairs, tables, and place settings very tacky. Plastic chairs/tables don't belong in this type of restaurant!\\n\\nThe waitress was nice enough but again I became confused with inconsistent flashes of formality and casual attitude. \\n\\nWe started off with the Cajun calamari. Not too greasy and I liked the big pieces of meat. I wish the sauce would have had more spice to it though, I found it much sweeter than I was expecting. \\n\\nTheir focaccia bread was delicious, and the salmon chowder was good but not ground breaking. The smoked salmon itself was delicious. My date had the smoked salmon salad which is not only a great deal but also comes with a healthy portion of the salmon. I found their \\"dill\\" dressing very plain. I also wish they included more beets, which were very tasty. \\n\\nI think my entree was the most disappointing part of the meal. The first bite of the cod parmesan was delicious and I couldn't wait to continue. The fish was cooked well and the breading was nice and crispy. Unfortunately what I didn't care for was the sauce. Overly salty and really took over the flavor of the fish, breading, and seasoning. It all just tasted salty. The polenta was good but not overly flavorful, and the broccoli Alfredo was lacking in the Alfredo...not that broccoli isn't fine by itself. \\n\\nIn the end, it was just too expensive to justify the mediocre experience.

He also apologized profusely, but by then I was too mad to care and then THIS guy started to give me attitude, too, at which point a THIRD guy got on the phone and told me that he would put me right through to the owner. (Which he did, and when the owner got on the phone and I started to relate my experience to him, he cut me off and asked me to \\"get to the chase.\\" At which point I told him Fine, I\\"ll get to the chase. I have never been in your store before, and I called up with a few questions, and one of your employees told me \\"f*** you,\\" and hung up on me. The owner, at that point, asked me for the guy's name, gave me a half-assed apology, and asked me what my questions were. I responded by telling him that I no longer had any questions and then I, myself, hung the hell up.)  Maybe it's just me, but my feeling was that if he was really and sincerely sorry for his loser employee's psychotic behavior, then he would have heard me out rather than telling me \\"to get to the chase.\\" So, apparently, the fish rots from the head in this dump.\\n\\nMy strong advice is this: Unless you want to deal with obnoxious and psychotic people (who are also borderline mental cases), then stay out of this toilet. I don't care how good the food may or may not be, it's not worth it if you also have to deal with people who are several tacos short of a combo plate."},{"name":"Fox Bros.

The egg was perfectly runny on the inside. The brisket ad a ton of flavor and was moist and tender (for the most part, it kind of got dry after sitting there for a while).

I would get them if I were getting the grits. Otherwise I would have just skipped them.\\n\\nBiscuits and Cornbread w/peach marmalade: DELICIOUS!! AND FREE. These are literally the best biscuits I have ever eaten. I literally ate 6 or 7 biscuits by myself. They are buttery and light on the inside, and delicious both by themselves or when covered with the homemade peach marmalade which they served it with (I'm pretty sure I didn't get the rhubarb marmalade like other people have gotten).

Don't get me wrong, I love bacon but would have expected a burst of different flavors when you only get 1 bite dishes.\\nEggplant: Don't shy away from this dish because it's vegetarian. The flavors, textures and everything were so delicious. You got the savory eggplant with the sweet honey and basil and it seems to work perfectly. Great dish\\nPancakes: This dish was on point (especially if you like corn/popcorn). There is literally popcorn on this dish. It's like breakfast for dinner but so much better. The fluffy pancakes are somehow sweet and savory at the same time and with the crunch of the popcorn it harmonizes perfectly in your mouth.\\nMussels: This dish was good. I don't think it was anything special. I can't remember what it tasted like.\\nThe Burger: So I was a skeptic when they said \\"best burger ever\\" but I think I am sold. This burger was so freaking delicious. Every bite is so perfect. I think what makes the dish is the cheddar cheese crisp, that is crunchy and salty. Who need bacon on your burger when you have a cheese crisp!!!\\n\\nI gave Alden and Harlow 4 stars just given the (very few) misses. There are definitely many 5 star dishes on the menu.

It definitely is one of the best restaurants I have been to in a very long time.

If nothing else, they do have a kale salad anyway.\\n\\nPretty much looks the same on the outside (road construction seems to be wrapping up though), but you walk into your grandmother's lovely home (the grandmother who lives in the country) through the front path surrounded by mulch that smells a bit like the farm (really I now think that's intentional). There are authentic touches everywhere but they don't scream at you like Disney perfection or kitsch - it's more like little hints or clues that start adding up. \\n\\nCozy blue walls & ceiling with white beams, molding and dining chair rails. Front porch, screened in side porch, the embroidery pictures in the \\"powder room\\", thread spools and sewing machine oil, girly pictures in the men's room, the servers are all young fellows and ladies who look vaguely like they are ready for church in their neat little plaid shirts and ladylike dresses. The mismatched serving dishes. sepia and b&w family pictures on the walls.\\n\\nBut all of these touches just add to the delights of the food - don't dismiss the deviled ham tea sandwiches - order them immediately - these little bites are packed with just the right crunch of grilled bread and a zing of ? in the ham. The kale salad was soft and flaked with tasty cheese and poached peaches - wonderful flavored in a light dressing.\\n\\nI am so glad our party of 4 opted for family style meal though it was enough food for 6! If we hadn't, I would have ordered safe and missed so many amazing dishes - field peas & butter beans with fragrant dill, slightly spicy greens with the exact right texture. I did avoid the fatback fried creamed corn (though 2 of our group pronounced it their hands down favorite) and the creamed potatoes also cleaned out by my companions. I loved the squash pancake and found the light as air cornbread - more like an incredibly light biscuit irresistible. Get that basket away! Of course it's cooked in a cast iron molded skillet coated with fatback so it has wonderful touch of crispness on every side.\\n\\nAmong our party we chose the catfish in \\"tomato gravy\\", truly the best catfish I have ever had either in or on this side of Memphis TN. The menu called it spicy but it was not overly spiced or in any way blackened - just wonderful combination of flavor; fried chicken with a delicious crust (fried in fatback too?) but moist and perfectly cooked chicken inside. Wood-grilled pork steak. Everyone polished off their entrees and made short work of most of the \\"trimmings\\" (sides).\\n\\nAfter relaxing with coffee or tea, as civilized Southerners will do after a big dinner (we were there for supper but truly this was a traditional southern dinner for mid-day Sunday), we enjoyed our choice of desserts - we had the toasted pound cake with \\"peach fool\\" (peaches and cream atop), a fruit tart (the promised ala mode missing tonight) and lemon icebox pie. Nothing too sweet, nothing greasy, not heavy - oh the fatback is there but the food is perfection - authentically southern but way better than I have ever had.

The BBQ was pretty good, though given all the hoops to get in, requires some planning.  They do have take out if you happen to live reasonably close, which is probably a better option than waiting for your typical no-frills BBQ joint setup.\\n\\nBegan with the Jalape√±o Poppers ($9) which were stuffed with puller pork and came with ranch dipping sauce.  Basically, sinful in every sense but unique and delicious enough to be worth the calories.  The Jalape√±o Cornbread ($2) came with honey butter and also very nice.  On to the main event... we found The Everything Plate ($29) was perfect for sharing between two people.  It comes with four meat portions and two sides.  On this visit, we selected the Pulled Pork, Chopped Beef Brisket, Ribs and Wings.  Everything was tender and had that perfect smokey flavor.  On the side, sampled the Fox-a-Roni which is Mac & Cheese topped with Brunswick Stew - delicious!  You aren't keeping a calorie count of this review, are you?  The Collard Greens were also done right - tender and full of savory flavor. \\n\\nOur server was very nice and still pretty attentive give how busy she was, which we really appreciated.\\n\\nSome advice on getting in.... Be prepared to wait outside in the parking lot area.  We arrived around 2pm on a Sunday afternoon, and the wait was about an hour.  Get the List app from iTunes.  It allows you to see your current place in line.  They have set out some park benches (half are unshaded) and a cooler full of ice water to help, but be prepared to wait outside for a while on a hot day.  Bring some entertainment.  Parking is not very extensive, though I believe you could park in the surrounding neighborhood on the street.  There is nothing in the surrounding area to pass the time (i.e. no other bars/restaurants that we saw)."},{"name":"Super Fusion Cuisine","address":"54 Mt Auburn St","city":"Watertown","stars":"4.5","text":"Excellent sushi, good prices, and creative unique specials that are almost inspired."},{"name":"Seasons & Regions Seafood Grill","address":"6660 SW Capitol Hwy","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"My wife and I took a weeklong trip starting in Portland along the Olympic Peninsula coast through Seattle and then back to Portland.

When you order food here, expect to be eating it family-style (everyone shares). Each dish does not come with your own sides, unless specified - you need to order your own rice.

This makes it difficult to determine if it's what you ordered, or if they already included tip for your party of 8+.

I want to stress that based on the meals I've had thus far this place leans towards a 5 star rating; its menu is robust and covers a lot of flavors, and everything has that made-in-house quality that many restaurants lack. Dungeoness Crab Wontons, Tomato basil soup and grilled cheese, seafood pastas, raspberry creme brulee; I have had all of these things and they made my taste-buds sing. So why am I knocking it a star, you ask? \\n\\nWhile the place has an earnest Boston seaside fish house feel to it, its a bit cramped, and could benefit from being larger. Last time I went I was seated next to a family, and their five year old kid was practically staring me down and breathing on my plate. The chairs aren't altogether that comfortable and the booths are tight in the midsection for hulking gentleman like myself. The patio is a bit more welcoming in theory, but its usually full and also cramped. \\n\\nHowever, if we were judging by the food alone, we are talking 5 stars here. There are serious chefs at the other end of these meals and you can tell they take pride in what they do. The items have a wide range of cost with some dishes suffering a bit of sticker shock to the uninitiated, but if you are looking to treat yourself you can almost positively trust you will get what you pay for. Great wine list as well. \\n\\nI would like for some more room to stretch out in a place like this, just a bit more comfort, perhaps a bit faster service, but all in all this is one of my favorite places to indulge my fancier appetites in Portland.

The appetizers and sides are chosen by the restaurant and from what I understand can/will change from time-to-time.

My husband and I don't eat a lot of salt and usually think most food it overly salted but not in this case. They were fine. Maybe they've reduced what they use or have a different cook but we thought the amount of salt was appropriate. I liked my Chicken but my husband wasn't impressed with the Meatloaf. It's wrapped in bacon which he did not eat (there is your salt) and thought it was rather bland.

Probably not washed completely.\\n\\nThe Mac n Cheese was good (me) okay (husband), the Carrots with Dill had a great flavor but the carrots were almost raw. I'm guessing they were going for al dente but they needed to be cooked/steamed a little longer. The Grits with Onions was our least favorite.

I also enjoy the chopped beef sandwich, and my eldest daughter loves the pork ribs - but I tend to get into a rut, and when I'm wanting bbq chicken (dark meat, please!), Pok-E-Jos is the place for me!  I enjoy their selection of warm sides (not being at all fond of potato salad or cole slaw), and the sweet flavor of the sauce complements the chicken perfectly.  Mom likes those traditional sides, and my youngest daughter likes the fruit salad.  Something for everybody!\\n\\nI prefer the sweet tea at Rudy's, frankly, but that's because I like my tea REALLY sweet.  I've found their cobbler to be inconsistent - sometimes it's just too bready, often it's just too dry - but it's almost always tasty."},{"name":"Tacodeli","address":"4200 N Lamar Blvd","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"I want to like Tacodeli, but I just can't get over that they're only open until 3 AND they stop serving breakfast at 11.

They don't even serve bean and cheese tacos! What is that! Bean and cheese is THE simple staple of any taco place, not to mention it's incredibly easy to make. \\n\\nAlright, onto the quality of the food. I don't know what it is, but Tacodeli makes me sick. I literally get sick like clockwork, as does my girlfriend, every single time. Maybe it's the salsa? I'm most definitely not allergic to tacos, so. Who knows. \\n\\nBut probably most disappointing is how often I've been served cold food. There is really no excuse to serve cold tacos on a short ticket time when it's wrapped in foil.

Over these past three weeks I've been here for lunch FIVE times, although one of those weeks I was in California and sadly, could not get my Lizzie's fix.  While I agree with Errol that there are a ton of great places in the Arboretum area to eat lunch, it's hard to top Lizzie's Lunchbox in its three defining (to me) categories:  cheap, FAST, and relatively healthy.\\n\\nTheir regular menu is fairly small, but I've enjoyed everything I've tried.  I've had the greek salad, the lamb pita wrap, and the chicken pita wrap.  I've also had several different kinds of hummus (I like the avocado more than the roasted red pepper) and the tabbouleh (I LOVE the tabbouleh - I could eat it by the gallon!).  I can't wait to try their falafel; that's next on my list.  Today I tried to order the cedar plank smoked salmon, since they are only serving it on Fridays now, and it was sadly sold out - but the lovely lady who always takes my order (Lizzie?) kindly threw in a salted chocolate cookie to assuage my sad heart and salmon-less belly.  The cookie was *delicious,* and I'm a total choco-chip cookie snob.\\n\\nThey usually have at least one (sometimes two) specials every day, and those are where I really get excited.  From their specials board I've tried a turkey and cranberry sandwich on warm pita (I love their pita), a lentil/sausage/spinach soup, a creamy chicken rice soup, a roasted tomato soup, and KILLER pumpkin whoopie pie with cream cheese filling.  I have an immense and sometimes irrational love of pumpkin-flavored things, and I could have eaten about 20 of those whoopie pies.. they were MHMGASMIC.  The ladies mentioned something about making a December version with chocolate and mint filling and I HOPE they were being serious!\\n\\nTo me one of the major perks of this place is how fast it is - I work a block away and if I call ahead they have my order ready in less than 5 minutes.  Even walking up and ordering is quick!  Since I haven't really had the time to take leisurely lunches lately, I appreciate how fast Lizzie's is and how nicely they package things for takeout.  I think the prices are actually very, very fair, considering a freaking salad at La Madeline will run you $9.73 and $8.60-something at Jason's Deli (I would know).  At Lizzie's I can get a healthy, filling lunch for $8 or under and that makes my wallet grateful.\\n\\nYou know you have a new favorite place when you are looking forward to next Monday's specials.

I showed up to Masa around 630 to get tapas and drinks with a friend because we had heard this place was great.  I went in and put my name down with the bartender (who leaves his post behind the bar to try and seat people) and waited with my friend.  Well, it was a long wait, but we're patient people.  I asked the bartender what the status was because I saw the second of the two parties ahead of us being seated, and he said there was one more person ahead of us.  We're still waiting 10 minutes later when he comes over to apologize to us because another party of vultures had descended on open seats, effectively cutting us in line.  Well, as you can imagine, after having waited for a while, weren't happy to hear this.  So then we get \\"seated\\" in the corner of the restaurant at a bar-like table with one stool....so we both stood because neither of us wanted to claim the chair.  So, again, we're patient people, but this was annoying.\\n\\nThen, we order two $5 combo platters which were great, I'd give those 4 stars based on excellent value and good flavor.  Sophisticated bar food and one combo platter really hit the spot with our margaritas.  Again, we were annoyed though, because we later saw that when everyone else got their combo platter, the waiter explained what was on the plate, and for us they were just handed over, so we had no idea what each thing was.  \\n\\nThe bartender kindly moved us over to two seats at the bar about 45 minutes later after we were basically finished, but I guess the thought was still there.  Apart from the good food and drink and the good value, the service here was a complete miss, and I think a person more fussy about service at a place would have given this place three stars.  My friend was a little miffed that when we ordered two more tapas at $1 each that they didn't just throw those two in for free given the fact that we had waited 45 minutes only to hear that they had seated someone ahead of us.  But, oh well!  If none of this had ever happened, the food and drink were excellent and at a good value, so I guess you just can't have it all.

Before dinner, they provide crackers and a couple of dips to go along with it and a big basket of rolls.  The last time I was here I got Shepherd's pie where the mashed potatoes were smooth on top with a nice char to it but the meat underneath needed some serious flavor overhaul.  The prime rib is a huge chunk of meat which comes with a potato side dish of your choice and vegetables or salad.

It is just so affordable and easy to whip up a sauce and some pasta at home, why waste 30 or 40 dollars to do it somewhere else.

Our friends and I went back at 9:00, hubby secured a rented $5 lawn chair from one of the smartest guys in Austin who rents them in the parking lot, and we were 5th in line.  By the time they opened at 11:00 the line was down the street and around the corner.  Worth the wait?  You betcha!  BEST, and I mean the BEST, brisket ever.  Sausage was great and so was the smoked turkey.  We bought so much food that we walked across the street to CVS and bought some Zip Lock Bags, a styrofoam ice chest and some ice so we could savor the leftovers later.  \\nMy husband thinks I'm kidding when I keep telling him that I want to fly back out there on a Friday, go to Franklins on Saturday, then fly back home on Sunday.

The service, location, pricing, and just the amount of things they offer completely exceeded my expectations. \\n\\nFirst off, everyone recommended a margarita from this location. Done! Tbh, I thought the only thing they offered was margaritas, but I was completely wrong. Their drink menu had a front and back side to it. The front provided all the margaritas they offer whether on the rocks or blended. The entire back of the menu had a HUGE selection of tequila shots and samplers. Not to be naive, but who would've thought there was so many varieties of tequilas! \\n\\nThe pricing was very comparable to any other bar. I paid about $11-$13 per drink, which was served in a pretty decent sized cup. When ordering, the bartenders are very charismatic and will definitely give you their personal input if asked. I was going to order a pineapple margarita over ice and the bartender told me \\"if you order it over ice you're not going to get as much tequila, trust me it's not worth it.\\". Say no more! He showed me how much more tequila would be in a blended margarita compared the iced version! I said, \\"just give me whatever will have the most!\\". Thank goodness I said that because he added another 2 shots of tequila to my drink! Throughout my visit, I tried the Horchata, Pineapple, and Cucumber margarita, which were all delicious. The only margarita I had over ice was the cucumber margarita and it was quite refreshing!\\n\\nAs far as the location goes, it's perfectly placed at the start of the World Showcase if you start at the left hand side.

I always get the meatless version, because I have yet to be told what kind of meat would be in the soup otherwise--a medium is at least two servings.

Anyhow, the shrimp hargrow, pork buns, turnip cakes and one other thing I can't remember were pretty good.

Then after a couple of more bites it dawned on me?  the bread was soggy, as in it had not been toasted and all the condiment had soaked into it.

My stomach is still reeling from that assault and I would say honestly stay way from this place, unless you just have beer.\\n\\nThe ambiance was very strage.  This was 1:00 PM on a Saturday afternoon and they were blaring some kinda hip-hop thing very loud, now, I know what you are thinking, Rom, you are just getting old.

The owner greeted us and told me a table was just about ready and asked us to wait at a bench in the front. After a long while, I walked to the back of the restaurant to look for the owner, as I did I passed an empty table. I found the owner at the bar in the back and he greeted me and asked 'how many were in my party?' He hadn't remembered me at all and obviously had forgotten we were waiting for a table. He bought us a drink. We liked the food.\\nThe second time I came back (because we did like the food) with my family visiting from out of town. We had a nice meal and left a good tip. We had split the bill 3 ways. The next day, noticed there had been an 18% tip added, making the total tip 40%. I called and spoke with the owner, basically, he said 'I apologize, but it's not our fault,' and would send our extra tip back to us in the mail. Though both times he 'did the right thing,' I don't feel good about the tone or the way he handled either of these situations, he was dismissive as if it didn't matter all that much to him.

While there were some stand-out dishes, my night was met with more disappointment than appeasement, although I can most certainly attribute much of that to this being the restaurant's first month of operation.\\n\\nThe highlights of the evening's meal were the sous vide soy-glazed chicken and the tempura oysters. Both were delicious and rich and had great texture, balancing both crunchy and tender evenly. The yuzu mashed potato dish we got as a side was a great compliment as well. The desserts we tried--peach ice cream mochi and Japanese-style cheesecake with strawberries--were freakin' awesome too.\\n\\nThe disappointments were the lamb and sablefish dishes, and the special rice side dish. The lamb was pretty mediocre (with possibly the truffle-laced potato mash granting it a little unique twist, but that's kind of like making an NBA MVP play on a high school basketball team.) The sablefish was somewhat bland, and the special rice dish (which sounded great in the menu) was little more than the standard bowl of Japanese fried rice I've gotten at other places.\\n\\nThe service was excellent. Our server was very well informed of the menu and had some great suggestions as well as provided  interesting conversation. Definitely no problems there. The interior design was neat and posh, if a bit expected so nothing new and exciting in that department.\\n\\nOverall it was underwhelming but with a handful of promising plates. I'm not quite sure at this point if the blandness of some of the dishes is related to the restaurant's proximity to the convention center (maybe they're trying to cater to a wider audience?), but I'm hoping that the issues are more due to the restaurant's newness.

This was a take out order so the food was about 30min old when I ate it, but I wouldn't expect the meat to have hardened or dried out that much.

I understood there is a Facebook page dedicated for the line. People pay for others to wait in line. Preorders can be made typically two months with no guarantee of getting your order and very strict pick up time. Instructions for preorder are online. \\n\\nI elected preorder for my short visit. Line was already down the block.  First ones to walk in. We were greeted promptly. Staff was friendly to offer beverages while the food was getting sliced and packaged. \\n\\nWe took some time to look around the articles on the walls. Lots of fascinating history and awards. We ordered brisket, ribs, sausage, pulled pork and a small order of potato salad. Meat was hot when the bag was handed to us. We drove maybe half an hour out and the food remained hot. The juices had seeped through the bag, the aromas of the proteins vibrant before opening the bag filled the dining room we were using.\\n\\nDescribing the proteins as smoked to a good char but without ruining the dry rub. Now to the meat of the review of protein. \\n\\nThe brisket was charred to absolute perfection. Flavors definite. Not even salty like most steak and beef found around. Brisket was half fatty and half meaty. Brisket nearly fell off the fork when being picked up. Almost buttery is often how this is described. It was light and like heaven in the mouth. \\n\\nThe ribs were of a different rub. Smoked to where trying to divide ribs no knife was need. Meat was incredibly soft tender. Just melted with ease to consume. Rub was good enough that even for the barbecue sauce was not really needed. Ribs were perhaps the best I have ever had. I have been to several rib cook offs. \\n\\n Choice of barbecue sauce was offered. Sweet and a savory option . Onions and pickles also were good. \\n\\nThe pulled pork was moist. Lightly seasoned. It was ok. Melted with each bite. The sausage was spicy. \\n\\nThe meats were good and all. I ordered more than enough that I ended taking some home to California with me. It all held well. Just as good in California. Everything was tender, seasoned, delicious, and flavorful.\\n\\nThis barbecue place is legit. The wait is worth it. Plan Ahead.

Sorry, and, believe me, I've tried only to be disappointed time and time again.  So, on a recent trip to the City of Roses we decided we were going to bank on Portland's reputation for food and see if we could find the fast track to some righteous Cuban grub.  Now, having been born on the Island Paradise myself, I take pride in being able to tell if the place is going to be good before I even take a bite (call it a sixth sense), so when I made my second phone call of the day to verify their location (I'll save you some misery, it's the FIRST left after you turn right on 82nd) and found myself being mildly scolded by Vivian (the Cubana of the food truck's name) for not having left my phone number the last time I called, it occurred to me that I could have been talking to my Cuban mother and that the food would be seriously good.\\n\\nWas it?  Darn tootin' it was.  Like all food trucks, the menu is limited, but what they do they do well.  The partner and I each went for the Cuban sandwich which was done classically and tasted great.  It came with an enormous side of mariquitas (sliced plantain chips that you'll love way more than potato chips) and, lucky for us, they were out of diet Coke so we went for broke and got a couple of batidos (milkshakes) made from mango and mamey (pro tip: both good, but get the second one).  We also managed to score a sample of the ropa vieja (a stew of fork tender shredded beef with a tomato and pepper base) and the congri (rice and black beans that were cooked together) -- out of sight!  There were some other options to try, but they'll have to wait for a future trip; still, we think we got the gist of the menu, and the verdict is that these folks can cook.\\n\\nSpeaking of the talent behind the menu, the couple that run the food cart, Vivian and Mario, were unbelievably warm and kind to us.  It probably didn't hurt that we were born under the same starts, but they were equally warm toward my very Anglo partner (and someday husband), and I got the feeling that they treat everyone who comes to eat their food that way.  They've also got a great story to tell about how they made it from Cuba to Portland, and if you catch them at the right moment they'll probably share it with you.\\n\\nBottom line:  Fortunately, Portland is a great town to visit for any occasion, so when we're feeling the jones for some Cuban food we can combine it with some additional fun, but, just to be clear, if this place were out in the middle of nowhere, we'd still make the schlep just to eat the food and hang with Vivian and Mario.

In fact, I remember one time I'd ordered a sandwich around closing time - the kitchen staff was wearing one glove and the other hand bare. He was cleaning something out of a bucket.

We open the calzone, it's as described, a little bland, but nothing some hot sauce couldn't help. The pizza, was a pizza with hamburger on it, that's it. So I call them to tell them the pizza was wrong, I hear the girl on the phone telling the manager what happened. She apologizes and offers $2 off our next order. I tell her we waited over an hour we want the right pizza, and we will give the wrong pizza back. The woman on the phone is now arguing with the manager and tells me that they are backed up on delivery and it would be at least an hour. Mind you it's 9:45 on a Wednesday night. I tell her it's fine just bring the right pizza. At this point the manager gets on the phone and tries to argue with me as to why I shouldn't want the right order and that they'll just give us a discount next time. \\n\\nReally?

Millions of servers with plates, and we all had food. All 11 of us, at once. They gave us an indoor table, cause we were too many to be seated outdoors.

Holy moly this place is good! \\nWe went here for brunch and were particularly inrigued with the idea of \\"Pecan maple encrusted bacon\\" since the SB (Sweet Baby) loves his Bacon.\\nWow, super delish. I had a Fried Green Tomato BLT, SB had Fried Chicken and Waffles and SP (Super Pal) had a scramble.\\nAll of the food was amazing but this is not the kind of place you could eat at regularly, the food is super rich and heavy. Lots of frying etc. Because the thing is, I am sure they serve salads but when you are at a place like this you are not going to be able to resist the bacon, fries or grits, it just doesnt work that way.\\nWe will definitely be back on our next trip to Portland."},{"name":"Hei La Moon","address":"88 Beach St","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"this place rules. my friends took me here for brunch like a month and a half ago and i've been back twice since. \\n\\ni just love the atmosphere. nice ladies and gents pushing around carts filled with the likes of pork buns, shrimp dumplings, and chicken fried rice. specifically i like the raised \\"stage\\" type thing along one wall with the huge golden dragons. it looks like the owner of the restaurant should be sitting there in a fancy robe overseeing everything. at least that's what I'D do if i was the owner.\\n\\ni can't decide how i feel about how the waiter immediately brought forks over to my table last time i was here... it's reasonable i guess since we were the only non-asians in the restaurant and a lot of white people probably don't know how to use chopsticks. more than anything i guess it's indicative of considerate service. which is a plus. \\n\\nit's good times though, i'd definitely hit this place up. i don't think the dim sum is necessarily \\"better\\" than the dinners but it's a lot more fun so for your first visit i'd recommend making it a weekend mid-morning."},{"name":"Condado Tacos","address":"132 S High St","city":"Columbus","stars":"4","text":"Got the quest, guac, ooey gooey taco, Lucy's fire and.

He had two orders of the crawfish and said they were outstanding but they don't make them spicy. We tried them fried as well and they were good.. Lightly breaded and came with two diff sauces. The crab legs were amazing. I had a cup of clam chowder but it wasn't that creamy, I like mine to be thick and chunky. We shared the √©touff√©e and the roux wasn't done right. Overall experience was pleasant."},{"name":"Christopher's","address":"1920 Massachusetts Ave","city":"Cambridge","stars":"3.5","text":"This place is so balanced. It's part pub--full of exposed bricks, an expansive bar and that local-charm feel--and it's part swanky eatery--GREAT veggie options, inventive menu trappings and knowledgeable staff. The 2 times I've been here, I've loved it. The vibe is hip enough to be a great meeting spot for all you twenty-somethings looking for a regular place to hang, without feeling like Cheers. It's also low-key and comfortable enough to have out-of-towners meet up there for a birthday dinner, with children in tow! I commend the staff on being so genial and patient with questions and requests. Their beer menu is fantastic. Try their veggie burgers--even if you're an omnivore!! All of this stuff--it makes Christopher's a real gem."},{"name":"Lonesome Dove Western Bistro","address":"419 Colorado St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"Incredible evening out.

The food is incredible. Vegans finally have a go-to for food! We will be going here on a regular basis. Food is wonderful and for a good price. The location is difficult to get to with construction on N High but the parking lot beside works if it's not full! But it's worth the parking because the food is die for, for us vegans! \\n\\nAlso!! They just added an online ordering option on their website!"},{"name":"Screen Door","address":"2337 E Burnside St","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"Well... It happened. I've been changed. I officially like chicken and waffles. That sweet potato waffle really kicks this dish up a notch. So good. Outside seating was really pleasant. Always a line, but rightfully so. Prices are definitely worth the deliciousness and portion size. The only thing I wanted to be a bit better was the coffee. PDX has tons of great coffee... maybe I got a bad batch? But 98% this place was awesome.

The food is always good and is run by a very nice family.  The waitstaff are friendly and attentive.  We have eaten there multiple times, and from pizza to entrees, no matter what we have ordered, everything has always been very good.  I am from NY, and I finally found pizza I like in Florida!  When I am not in a pizza mood, I particularly like the veal piccata.  Garlic knots are wonderful, as well.  It's a great family neighborhood restaurant."},{"name":"Screen Door","address":"2337 E Burnside St","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"Well this place is not very good.......it's fantastic.

First of all the environment is cool as hell. The walls are papered (literally) with old concert flyers just stapled to it. It's nostalgic and you kinda want to steal like 10 of them to take home and staple on your rock wall. But you don't because that would be unethical. That staff are super nice too, which makes you want to like this place all the more. They have a decent beer list, which could be enough to go back.\\n\\nThe food however--man what a let down. Ok that's not entirely fair. The burger let me down. The Black and White Fries along with the rootbeer float I \\"shared\\" (Hey if you're not drinking I will so better get it while you can) were great. But \\"burger\\" is in your name, which implies that your burger is effing awesome. Yeah notsomuch. Instant gut bomb folks--The bread good, but g-r-e-a-s-y. The patty pretty small. It's about as good as an 80% (or lower) fat  ground beef as one would expect at a carnival. Which is super disappointing.\\n\\nMaybe it was a bad, busy, insert excuse here, but it was enough for me to be VERY hesitant to try another burger, because the bathroom aftermath wasn't worth it.\\n\\nSorry Foster Burger.
