Not bad as we expected the wait. They have self-serve coffee while you wait but note that it's NOT FREE OF CHARGE as they will charge you for it (we didn't realize until we got the bill).\\n\\n2. Menu/Food - Completely unfamiliar with Scandinavian food but enjoyed their menu complete with nordic names. We ordered the Lost Eggs (super creamy and filling), Swedish Meatballs (creamy sauce was oddly tangy which confused my taste buds) and Danish pancakes (made fresh but unremarkable + easily forgettable, comes with tasty sauces). Although the food was not mind blowing, all tasted very good, filling portions, and were beautifully plated.\\n\\n3. Atmosphere - Broder is small and cozy which makes for a perfect brunch atmosphere, complete with the typical hustle + bustle of a small, open kitchen right by the bar.

We squeezed around a small table on the back patio so that the medium-sized dog with our group wouldn't be disruptive. Since we were just plain grateful that the dog could come with us, we did not count this as an inconvenience, but rather part of the charm. Fortunately we were all in the mood to split several different items. We tried two tartines since those are signature dishes - the Ricotta and Dried Fig with honey, walnuts and black pepper, and the Roasted Turkey with avocado, tomato, red pepper aioli. The freshness and quality of the toppings really stood out but I found their bread to be boring, and I simply ate the toppings off of my share of the tartines to save room for the rest of the meal. Good thing I did because the Parisian Sandwich ham, havarti, tomato, butter on fresh baguette, with dill cream cheese was delicious but very filling! This sandwich's French baguette was perfectly crusty, the ham and cheese complimented one another, and even I, a tomato skeptic, appreciated how the tomato balanced the sandwich's savory elements. Lastly, we split the day's mushroom soup. Since soup is an awkward thing to split, our waiter gladly met our request for smaller cups to sample from. I only sometimes like some mushroom dishes, but this soup passed the test! I'd say that the cost of the meal was a very fair deal for the quality and amount of food we received, the flawless service, and enjoyable atmosphere of the evening.

First thought: Why isn't every dish on the buffet labeled? The layout of the buffet food is odd, with the pastry offerings in a separate area. It was mentioned by friends, or I would have totally missed it. I strongly doubt that the pastries are homemade, as some of the eclair cream puffs were still icy cold in the middle. Brownies had perfectly placed toppings, like from a robotic assembly line. There was nothing special on the main buffet. My favorite dish was their Mala String Beans with the Julian cut onion and carrot. The sausage links were flavorful, but I'm assuming they were not locally made (they were to \\"perfectly\\" shaped and sized). Pancakes were super thin, like, those just-add-water-to-the-powder-mix getups. The fried rice had no unique flavor. My potsticker was tough around the edges. I did get a few strips of bacon, and those were crisp and still a smidge warm. Our waitress did a decent job working to keep used plates off our tables. \\n\\nI'm glad I got the chance to try J. Liu, as the reviews are mixed, and I've had them bookmarked for some time. The space made me think of a country club, with the dark woods and maroon reds. The big windows were awesome.

I read a couple of reviews on this place and figured it would be delicious, based off of the picture gallery as well. So, there was some Good & Bad about my experience here.\\n\\nGOOD:\\n\\n* They accept reservations! I called in to make a reservation for my party and they were happy to accommodate. If you want seating at the Teppanyaki table/grill, it holds a maximum of 18 people. There is also an slight extra charge for that seating. They also offer regular tables, where I assume, you won't get a \\"show\\" and/or watch your food be prepared. If you haven't been to a hibachi grill, I'd recommend. But if you're not that pressed or have been before, then it's nothing really spectacular anymore. You also need a credit card on file in order to reserve your table. You won't be charged for anything, granted you all show up. \\n\\n* The food is good! No wonder everybody raves about it. I ordered the Teppanyaki Shrimp ($24) with a side of NY Striploin ($17), Grilled Asparagus ($7), and Garlic Butter Fried Rice ($3). EVERYTHING was flavorful and delicious. The food literally had NO FLAW. Perfect.\\n\\n* The customer service is also pretty good here. I'd assume so since the parking lot is full of Bentley's, Ferrari's, & other exotic cars that were parked in valet. The staff kindly & constantly come around to collect your finished bowls & plates to make room. \\n\\n* Valet parking is available and tip based. \\n\\nBAD:\\n\\n* PRICE! Like of course, this is a restaurant in Buckhead, so YES, I already assumed that this place would be kind of pricey, but my GAWD! The fact that they charged for vegetables is what blew us away. That usually comes with it at the average Japanese restaurant.\\n\\n* TOO MANY PLATES. Literally EVERYTHING you order will be plated SEPARATELY. So, I had 4 individual plates, 1 bowl of salad, and 1 bowl of soup. There's already not much space at the Teppanyaki table. To put it into perspective, it was no table room with 9 people! I can't imagine what space would look like if I had all 18 people fill a table. Everyone had at least 3-4 plates individually at one time. Not to mention any drinks you have in front of you. \\n\\n* Only 4 or 5 self-parking spots. Otherwise, you'll have to valet. \\n\\nOverall, Katana is a good spot.

I had the margherita and my husband had the pepperoni americano (both delicious!), and we loved both of the desserts on their dessert menu. It was a bit busier this time than when we've visited in the past since we went later in the evening than we typically do. My favorite time to go is for an early dinner when not all of the tables are full, yet, and there aren't many people waiting for bar seating.

He double checked our orders to make sure he didn't have any questions and then kept us happy with drink refills and bread until our food came.

Guitarist provided a nice, intimate environment. During winter months, make sure to sit as far away from the door since a drafty breeze does come in.\\nParking: Street parking - come early!\\nOrder:\\nCappuccino with lavender shot: It was an interesting drink but felt that the lavender shot did not add to the flavor. The coffee was really bitter, almost as if the beans were over roasted, so I would recommend getting a shot of sweetener added to it.\\nCheese platter: One of my favorite dishes and probably the best cheese platter I've had so far. A great variety of cheeses but would suggest an addition of another jam/jelly instead of just one jelly supplied. In addition, the platter does not come with an order of bread, so keep in mind about ordering some bread or asking for a 2nd bread basket.\\nBlue Dahlia Brie Tartine: I was not the biggest fan of it. Even though I enjoy brie and the apricot jam, the huge chunk of brie on each slice was too overwhelming. I would recommend skipping this and just getting the cheese platter.\\nSliced Cold Smoked Salmon Tartine: I genuinely enjoyed this dish and felt that the cucumber adding a refreshing taste to it. The salmon had a clean taste to it and was not over salted.\\nI will say that I wish the Tartine was toasted, since this would add to the dish.\\nService: My waiter was not as attentive this time, which is why I gave my review 3 stars instead of 4 stars. It was very difficult to just put in order or even get a cup of coffee, and we were helped 2x by other waiters who noticed that we were patiently waiting on our waiter. He only checked on us once during our meal, but we watched him consistently check on adjacent tables multiple times.

No, really it's because I love shrimp, but am unable to eat it. On vacation from Texas up to the Northeast, how could I leave without tasting some of the only things that New England is known for? Second, I will say that I'm only allergic to crustaceans, so I was very excited to get some oysters, one of the only shellfish I actually can eat. \\n\\nMy friend and I sat at the bar for this visit. The bartender had quite a sense of humor and was a hoot to communicate with throughout the duration of our visit. We ordered a seafood sampler platter, which for the price, we expected to be MUCH bigger. We received exactly two shrimp, two clams, and two oysters. We decided to also order the fish tacos, and split.\\n\\nPersonally, I'm not a fan of fish tacos. But these were SO good. Also, I loved the oyster I had, and the shrimp, well let me tell you. I ate exactly half of the juicy, plump, big, delicious shrimp before my lips started burning. I decided to put the shrimp down, and be responsible. \\n\\nIt was a good half of a shrimp.\\n\\nAlso, I had a pretty tasty green apple martini (it was red??)

Honestly, the whole time I was there (and now reading all of the positive reviews) I felt like I was being duped in some elaborate prank where hipsters go nuts over mediocre pizza in a scheme to lure people there so they can then = laugh at them while they dine trying to figure out what the hype is all about. I digress. \\n\\nA friend was visiting from out of town and had seen this place written up in an article of places to eat in Boulder, so off we went. \\n\\nOur server was pretentious at best and condescending at worst. The entire meal from start to finish consisted of his acting like we were hillbillies at the Plaza. We are not hillbillies and this place is not the Plaza. \\n\\nI ordered a bottle of wine and when the server opened it, he smelled it...and his nostrils touched the opening of the bottle...twice. I'm not talking an accidental light graze here either. It appeared as though he was having an intimate moment with it which was uncomfortable. I'm all about people being passionate about wine but 1. Please don't touch your actual nose to the bottle where you'll be pouring the wine out of 2. This wasn't some fancy 20 year old vintage I ordered...it was a pretty standard bottle of wine to be getting so much lustful attention from our server 3. I feel this bears repeating...don't physically make contact with the bottle and your nose. Gross.\\n\\nWe had appetizers which were good, but nothing to write home about. \\n\\nThen...the pizza. The moment of truth. (Drum roll please...). It's fine. It's not great. The selection is unique, but I don't think it packs the punch that's intended. Bad enough to be paying so much for pizza that isn't stellar, but that wasn't the worst part about it. You know what was? Yeah, they don't cut their pizza. I repeat, they do not cut their pizza. When we asked the server about that, he made some bogus excuse about how they're policy is to not cut the pizza as soon as it comes out of the oven in order to let it set. Let's discuss why this is absolute nonsense.\\n\\n1. You are not pizza revolutionaries. How long has pizza been around? And in all of that time has anyone ever gone, \\"I really wish they would stop cutting this pizza into conveniently sized slices perfect for holding in my hand.\\" No. Nobody has ever said that. EVER. Stop acting like you cracked some great long sought out pizza code. You are the only place I've ever been to that does this...that should tell you something. \\n\\n2. Also in all of that time has anyone ever said, \\"gee, I wish they had let this pizza sit for a few minutes before they cut it. Now it has dents in it and the cheese isn't a perfectly smooth surface for me to bite into\\" Again. No one. Ever. \\n\\n3. They don't provide you with anything to cut the pizza with. No slicer or even sharp knife for after the pizza has \\"set\\" [insert eye roll here]. You are left to butcher your revolutionary pizza by hacking away at it with a dull butter knife. This is the moment I really thought I was on candid camera. So, your policy is to not cut the pizza for a bogus reason, but then, once I do want to cut the pizza in order to consume it (that is the goal...right?), I'm left without a proper tool to do so with. Let me also stress that this is not a crust that is soft and just gives to the slightest touch. Imagine trying to saw through a branch with a butter knife. I want you to imagine this...and laugh, because this is what everyone in the joint looks like. At one point I was tempted to just pick the whole thing up and start eating it a-la cookie monster, however, the pizza wasn't good enough to warrant such a feverish consumption.\\n\\n4. Not cutting the pizza does not make your pizza taste better or superior to other pizzas in any way shape or form. It just doesn't. Stop it. Just stop it. \\n\\nPerhaps my favorite part of it was that when we asked our server about it, he acted like we were absurd for asking that question. Yeah, I'm the jerk for asking why a pizza, a staple of our culture that is always cut into slices (be it into squares or triangles, I don't discriminate) is served to me solid and with no proper cutting device. \\n\\nI guess the bottom line is. I don't get it. I don't get the hype, or I'm simply not in on the joke. Either way, I won't be returning to this place. I'm holding out hope to one day see the video footage of myself, my boyfriend, and friend trying desperately to cut this pizza into manageable slices with a dull butter knife on a future prank show.

We asked about the size of our small plates, because of some of the negative reviews on Yelp. For those of us used to tapas in Seattle, they were well described by the staff and didn't disappoint. They were yummy, nicely complex and not that expensive for a restaurant with lovely decor, a kick-ass bar and a wait staff that truly treated us incredibly well.  Two small plates, a shared big plate of tender pork cheeks, some rice and beautiful greens were more than enough for two people-who don't want to stuff themselves. Everyone checked on us and asked about our food-even, I think the owner or head chef who came by a few times. I think it might have been because we came in with our festive faces on and looked approachable the entire night. The drinks were amazing. If one wanted a normal Whiskey Sour or Manhattan, one might have been a little weirdered out by the magic that was delivered.

I can solidly recommend the rueben, the breakfast sandwich, and the vegan crab cakes, all of which are still on their menu. \\n\\nI brought my girlfriend in for lunch today, and we both ordered the vegan crab cake sandwich. It was delicious! My girlfriend, who is from New England, was totally sold on the veggie version. She said that it tasted like a New England crab cake. No complaints in regards to our meal. However, the service was really slow from start to finish. No one really had any hustle, which I guess comes with the chill atmosphere (the decor is reminiscent of a spa/the forest), but we had to wait a really long time before our meals came. Our waitress was friendly enough, although she could have been a little more attentive and personable. The man that brought over our food and refilled our waters was very unfriendly. He didn't smile or say much of anything. \\n\\nWe ordered the peanut butter cheesecake after our meals and were told that they were out of that cheesecake today. Our waitress offered the hazelnut and blueberry cheesecake which wasn't on the menu. It wasn't particularly good. It was way too sweet and grainy for my taste. I've had much better vegan cheesecakes. \\n\\nThe more irritating part of our meal was the check. We were both charged $12 for our sandwiches even though the menu indicated they were only $11. We were also charged $9 for the cheesecake even though the menu said it costed $8. Now $3 might seem like no big deal, but when you're on a student budget, getting nickel and dimed by the restaurant was a big turn off. I can only guess that the sandwiches costed more because we got sweet potato fries with them, but our waitress did not say that there would be an additional charge for sweet potatoes when she was listing our choices for sides. The sides and their prices are also nowhere on the menu. It would be nice if the restaurant was upfront about extra charges instead of trying to sneak them onto the bill. And being charged extra for a flavor of cheesecake that we politely took because our first choice wasn't available? Pretty crappy. I checked these prices against their online menu as well, and the prices we were charged were incorrect.   \\n\\nOverall, the food is good. The service is slow and the waiters unenthusiastic."},{"name":"The Paramount","address":"44 Charles St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"Solid breakfast food, a great value...with the most annoying cafeteria-style line ever.

Today I mistakenly decided to try the Sylan Rd location because I know that the area has less traffic which probably means more parking which was true. I absolutely refuse to believe that these two locations are owned and operated by the same people.. from the service to the food, everything is completely different. Being in the food and beverage industry for 10+ years, I don't think you will ever come across a more understanding customer than myself. But today is the day that I cannot turn the other cheek and it hurts me that I have to write a review on such a horrible experience. Waiting on my togo order for 40 minutes, i witnessed a lot of things that made me cringe from a lady watching her Waffle get cold while she waited on hot syrup that she requested twice in a fifteen minute period, servers not knowing where a order goes and there's only like eight tables, guest entering and refusing to have a seat because they lack faith that a server will actually come over to take their order. All the togo orders came out on plates then it took another five minutes to put it into a togo box. Two servers.. eight tables but one lady stood at the register the entire time and put orders in but never once went to the window behind her to pick orders up no matter how many times the kitchen rang that bell. Common sense is to clear the food from the window so new orders can come up. I watched my food come into the window on plates and sit there for 10 minutes (and thy don't have one of those windows that keep the food hot) before the only lady serving tables walked over and told them it was suppose to be togo, instead of the kitchen putting it into a togo box immediately, they gave her a lecture on how to ring up togo orders. Then when it came back up in the togo box, she pulled it out the window and sat it on the counter and walked away! At this point I began to get mad.. one thing I hate is cold food, after I watched her walk past my food a bunch of times, I finally said \\"excuse me, can I have my food please??\\" Which was already paid for, she looked at me like I was crazy and said \\"oh is this yours?\\" The quality, freshness, and taste of the food was nothing like the Northside Dr location, it was terrible to say the least and of course cold. I ended up tossing it out the window. I can't and won't with this place. It's safe to say that I will never step food in this parking lot again, I don't care if it's 5:15pm on a Friday night and the falcons have a game, there's two concerts in town and a convention, I will fight that downtown traffic and risk parking somewhere with a high possibility that my car will be booted just to go to the Northside Dr location.\\n\\n*i omitted the names of the servers because my goal is not to have anyone lose their job but for the establishment to be held responsible for what is happening here"},{"name":"Mizu Teppanyaki and Sushi","address":"809 Cypress Pkwy","city":"Kissimmee","stars":"4","text":"Didn't get acknowledged till about 20 minutes into sitting and waiting.

No sauces we offered or napkins. My wife had to walk up to the sushi maker and ask him for two sauces. That's when finally our waiter came to and dropped them off. Now, after waiting all this time (my wife ordered the veggie hibachi dinner) we get our food and the veggies are cold. So is the rice but mostly the main dish, THE VEGGIES. On top of that, the waiter told a gentleman sitting in the corner that the reason she hasn't attended to him bc he was in a dark corner and couldn't see him, mind you he was an African American fellow. She never asked us how the food was or offered refills on our waters. It wasn't till she came by and noticed my wife's full plate and offered boxes.

Voodoo has flavors you won't find anywhere else. My personal favorites were the Mango Tango and the classic Portland Cream. The actual doughnuts themselves I would say taste above average.

The initial shortcoming was the fact that on mother's day, an \\"all day brunch\\" buffet was the only option for service at this restaurant. This was not known or advertised prior to booking our reservation, about a month ago. Upon arrival and finding out about the buffet, we decided to give J Liu the benefit of the doubt and stayed to give it a try...bad decision. First of all the price of the buffet was not known (29.99 pp), and the options were super limited. The food looked like it had been left out for hours and only replenished when there was only enough to scrape from the pan. The \\"salad\\" items were soggy and when I approached the roast beef and smoked ham carving station, the server informed me that it was the \\"last of the roast beef for the day\\"...it was 5:15pm on mother's day. All other \\"hot\\" food items were luke warm at best and the dessert station was in disarray with cookie crumbs and smushed mini pecan pies all over the table. Overall I felt like the 150 dollar (29.99 for 4 buffet servings, 3 mimosas at 6 dollars a pc and 3 bucks for a diet coke) for 4 people, plus tax and tip, was a robbery and I will probably not return for regular dinner service due to this experience. The only reason for 2 stars was due to the server who was kind and replenished drinks and removed plates expeditiously."},{"name":"Sofia Pizza House","address":"45 Billings Rd","city":"Quincy","stars":"3","text":"By far the worse pizza house I have every ordered from.

I was sadly disappointed the first time, and was not pleased the second either.  The only reason I went back for a second time was because Watch City Brew (located across the street) was closed for a private party.\\n\\nThere was no one to seat us when we first walked in, so we kind of stood there confused, thinking whether we should seat ourselves or wait for a hostess.  I went on a weeknight and it wasn't that busy, so there should have been someone to greet us and seat us immediately.  When we were finally seated, we realized the hostess was also a waitress handling the bar area and dining area along with only one other waitress.\\n\\nWe started off with the Buffalo Shrimp appetizer.  The shrimp were large, but weren't de-veined which grossed us out.  It seemed like they boiled the shrimp and then just tossed them in some supermarket brand hot sauce.  Not a good start!\\n\\nI opted for the buffalo pulled chicken sandwich, which was very dry.  There was barely any bbq sauce in the chicken.  I had to ask for extra.  The french fries were good...of course, I am a sucker for anything that is deep fried.  My friend had the fried catfish, which he hardly ate because it tasted that bad to him.  He said it was bland and wasn't made with cornmeal.  It was battered and deep fried, so I thought it was edible.  ha!  Then again, I've never had true southern fried catfish, so I wouldn't know what it is supposed to taste like.  His sides weren't tasty either -- the beans tasted like they came out of a can and the cole slaw was just OK.\\n\\nOverall, the food wasn't good and the service was worse.  At one point, the waitress noticed that our drinks were empty and didn't bother to bring us re-fills.  We had to ask after several attempts to get her attention.  The atmosphere wasn't very inviting either.  We were the only people of color there and we just got this vibe that people were staring at us.  (I know that some people of color can get over sensitive about situations like that and react when there really isn't an issue, but once in a while,  you get that feeling and you know it's not you.  This was one of those occurrences.)\\n\\nI would recommend Blue Ribbon BBQ in West Newton as an alternative."},{"name":"JINYA Ramen Bar","address":"5975 Roswell Rd, Ste B-217","city":"Sandy Springs","stars":"4.5","text":"Definitely the best ramen in Atlanta. I've tried the spicy chicken, sprouting up, and the Tokyo one as the sprouting up is my favorite! It had perfectly roasted Brussel sprout. The broth was good and the meat was generous. They also have the best hot sauce! It's pretty spicy though so you are warned! Ask for fresh garlic, it's complementary, and they will bring out a garlic press for you to press out the garlic yourself which is pretty awesome. The shrimp appetizer was very good. It's their version of the bang bang shrimp. I would skip the crispy chicken, it was just overly salty and lacked other seasoning. The service is pretty good once you get a table. The wait can be excruciating. The place is pretty small and it seems to be a popular hot spot right now. So definitely be prepared to wait... A long time! We came for lunch at 2pm (deliberately trying to skip the lunch rush) for a table of 4 and still was told 2 hours for inside and 1 hour for outside!

All he had to do was switch it over and thats it. Just switch it dont make up a new name for roast pork just to prove you are superior. The other two backing up him were so ridiculous. Youve worked in this industry for years you still cant tell which one is which? You going to swear at your customers to their face in a different language over something like this?

The vibe is classy, but upbeat and manages to avoid being stuffy even though its also got a phenomenal wine list.  However, I will say this is one Portland restaurant where I actually like to dress for the occasion (a black dress perhaps).\\n\\nThe services is impeccable - which is actually quite important because the menu is truly Peruvian in spots and it helps to have a knowledgeable server guide you through it so you delight your taste-buds appropriately.  That's not to say I've ever tried anything I didn't enjoy - it is all fantastic.\\n\\nYou can either come for tapas - ordering a selection of small, medium and large plates to share amongst a group, or you can indulge in a delectable entree.  My favorite small plates include the Mixta Nikkei causa and any of the cebiches (even if it frightens you, I promise you'll be glad you tried it).  My favorite entrees are the diver scallops (quinoa encrusted) and the lamb.  As for beverages, the aforementioned wine list is superb, but so is the sangria.

Its on the bar menu, you don't have to try saying its name, you can just point.\\n\\nReservations are a must, though you can always wait to be seated in the bar - which is worth it even if there is a wait since its vibrant, fun, and often has live music."},{"name":"Mortadella Head","address":"20 College Ave","city":"Somerville","stars":"3.5","text":"Okay, I'm just going to say it...I don't like pizza.

We were so hungry and for them to be so sloooooow. Did I mention it was slow? Also. What's up with disposable paper table cloths on top of fabric ones?

What we were hoping would be a nice relaxing dinner after a long day at work was a very, very long night...and not because we were enjoying ourselves, but because the service was TERRIBLE. Let me just start by saying the waitress who had all of two tables in the entire restaurant (which was all that was in the restaurant) couldn't take more than one drink order at a time, then would come back 20 minutes later for another order. Left us sitting there for 45 mins-1 hour without asking to refill our water (which we had to ask for), continued to take orders at the table next to us and running past us saying \\"I'll be right back,\\" but never actually returning. The icing on the cake was the turkey club (that I waited three hours for in total because of the waitress' reluctance to take our order) came WITHOUT BACON. Ummm isn't that the main ingredient in a club?! I sent it back after eating two bites of realizing it, and they sent it back to me cold with three cold slices of bacon. Are you kidding me?! A little customer service let a long ability to get your own cold sandwiches right on your own menu goes a long way...clearly this place has some management issues. Do not recommend going here unless you want to get ripped off and leave hungry, frustrated, and ignored after 3 hours of sitting there."},{"name":"Tikki Masala","address":"3706 Washington St","city":"Jamaica Plain","stars":"4","text":"Foood was sooooooo great.

Kudos for having a late night HH especially in Lake O. Even so, only one of us ordered from the HH menu selecting the dirty chicken tacos. She enjoyed them, but said they were nothing special. \\n\\nTwo of us ordered the burritos. On the menu it stated the burrito came with a queso sauce, but showed up without any. It needed it desperately. I was too hungry to question, especially since they don't provide complimentary chips and salsa for the table, so just dug in anyway. The burrito was blah, lacking in flavor. I asked for and added salsa but it still was mediocre. I took half home and when I heated it up for lunch the next day, I added salsa and cheese, and after it came out of the microwave, I topped it with pico de gallo and it was very good. But I shouldn't have to doctor up my dinner! My friend who ordered the other burrito felt the same way.\\n\\nThe one standout meal was the chili. Lots of flavor, served with flour tortillas, it was tasty and satisfying. \\n\\nOur waitress was fantastic in every way. Immediately took drink orders and delivered them, answered our questions, served our meals correctly, and even brought a water bowl for the two dogs without us asking. When one of the dogs tried to visit a dog passing us, and knocked over the chair with his human in it causing her to tumble to the ground, and the platter of brussel sprouts crashing to the pavement, Heather (I think that was her name), cleaned everything up and brought us another plate of brussel sprouts, no charge. She even gave the dog some love saying that everyone makes mistakes. She was so understanding. If I could give her 5 stars I would! \\n\\nIronically, none of us liked or ate the brussel sprouts - they were drenched in balsamic and were way too sweet.

I will be back for more of their pizzas in the near future and would recommend to anyone."},{"name":"Poor Calvin's","address":"510 Piedmont Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4.5","text":"The drinks were very good as well as the lobster fried rice.

Initial take: tantalizing. Sugar crumbles at the top, slightly bleeding blueberries on the top and sides of the muffin. First bite: crunchy crumbles juxtaposed with the chewy, fluffy muffin cake. The muffin wasn't too sweet, and the crumble added texture. With no cream cheese to taste, 2 stars.\\n\\n*Salted Caramel Brownie Caf√© Mocha*\\nAlthough I'm a fan of simple flavors (think vanilla, cappuccino, glazed donut), I opted for this concoction because I'm also a fan of caramel. The drink didn't have your standard milky foam; the bubbles seemed caramelized. You can definitely taste the salt at the top of the beverage. As you continue through the drink, I tasted less and less of the salted caramel. There's a tinge of liquor-flavor at the aftertaste of the sips, most likely the product of the brownie flavor. Not my cup of coffee. 1 star.\\n\\n*Chicken, Sun-dried Tomato + Goat Cheese Sandwich*\\nOf the three items I purchased, I had the least expectation for this one since it is a bakery and caf√© first. Toasted bread with heavily black-peppered chicken, nested inside a bed of spinach and goat cheese. First bite: I can taste the cheese, aioli, and pesto. The bread was easy to bite through. After eating the first half, I must say that the sandwich is delicious. The sun-dried tomato is subtle in the aioli which is fantastic as I find sun-dried tomatoes can be easily overpowering. My tongue is salivating for more. 3 stars."},{"name":"King + Duke","address":"3060 Peachtree Rd NW","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Wow. That first bite into the burger and you will be in awe.

Not sure if that is altogether fair since I am aligning it with the most amazing impossible burger on the planet, but hey that is how it goes sometimes.  The burger was cooked well, the bun was just OK, but the fries are the reason I gave this 3 stars.  They were great, they were HOT, fresh and none were that brown skin ugly looking things that gross you out when you are eating great fries.  The burger was just ok, they did not season the patty at all.  That would be my only suggestion, you will need to get some salt/pepper to add some flavor to the burger.  I did get the condiments, mustard, pickles...blah blah and that only made it a burger with condiments.

When my family and I returned to this location early Sunday afternoon, we immediately noticed a wait of maybe 5 families, 8 empty tables, employees arguing with each other in front of where families were eating, and employees who looked like they hadn't had a clue of what was going on. When we sat down, our poor server told us that he was working without any proper training and that this was his first day. This is utterly unacceptable. The employees aren't even to blame for the fact that my family, as well as other families that I observed, had many problems receiving our correct orders; it is the management of this restaurant that should take responsibility. How are you going to throw your employees out to a full house without knowing the menu, knowing how the computer works, or knowing how the restaurant is structured as a whole??

Andina's.  I didn't know how I'd fare with Peruvian food - unfamiliar and whatnot - but I was feeling a little adventurous.  And so glad too!  This is the real deal good meal.  On the suggestion meter, it's a hard YES MA'AM.  Do it.  I'm serious.\\n\\nFirst of all, we had an awesome server who helped us in making choices.  Out of the three appetizers we wanted, she suggested the Pan Peruano con Tres Ucuchutas - potato quinoa beak with three sauces (jalapeno mint, passionfruit and a peanut/pepper sauce.  We both LOVED this!  All three sauces were good, but the peanut/pepper one was my favorite.  The bread was very good as well and was truly and excellent start to our meal.\\n\\nNext, the Anticuchos de Pollos - chicken kebobs.  You get three kebobs, which were juicy and very flavorful.  Served with a yummy pepper salsa.  I'd eat more of these for sure!\\n\\nThen we had the Palta Rellena de Cangrejo - avocado stuffed with crab and topped with poached prawns.  This was very good as well!  You get a full half of avocado!  The blend of textures was super nice and we even spread some on our leftover bread.  Excellent!\\n\\nUp next was the Humitas de Queso - corn tamales stuffed with cheese and served with salsa.  I did like these, but they were sweeter and mushier than a traditional Mexican tamale.  Was a bit like sweet cornbread of something.  I do prefer more savory tamales - and a skosh drier - but still a good dish.\\n\\nLastly, we had the Empanadas de Carne - beef empanadas filled with raisins, olive and egg.  These were super yum!  Familiar flavor, but the olive was a nice touch.  Served with a salsa, of course.\\n\\nWe somehow (thankfully!) saved room for dessert.  The Lucuma is the Peruvian national fruit, so naturally we had to have the Sublime con Lucuma - a chocolate bar filled with peanut and served with a lucuma panna cotta and raspberry drizzle.  Delicious!  Lucuma tastes sort of caramel-y or a butterscotch, maple ... something very warm and cozy.  Definitely a winner!\\n\\nI'm seriously glad I decided to be adventurous and come to Andina's.

Also very tasty.  \\n\\nThey start you off with some buttery, sea-salted rolls. I could have eaten them all night! We then sampled a few oysters for about $2-4 each. I don't normally like oysters, but there was really good, especially with the sauces and lime juice.

My entree was the Swordfish, with almond milk sauce, fried garlic chips, and some wild mushrooms. While it was a decent tasting dish, I expected more for $30. The flavor was mild, nothing mind blowing about it. The serving size was also on the dainty size, so I'm glad I got a side order of the Basmati Fried Rice (with smoked fish and egg). The rice was good too, but nothing to write home about. A little less greasy than take out fried rice, and with a hint of curry spices. \\n\\nThe star dish here was the dessert. We shared the Candy Bar Sundae (ice cream, salted caramel blondie, and peanuts... they ran out of Heath Bars today). The sweet and salt flavors were perfectly balanced. It never got too rich or sweet either. Lots of textures at play, including the waffle cone bowl that housed the dessert. Definitely one of my favorite sweets in town now!\\n\\nService: Our sever was professional and attentive. The staff in general was very welcoming. I'm disappointed to say that my entree took nearly 45 minutes to come out there. And this was right around when the kitchen opened. There were hardly a few others tables around us with patrons at the time, so not sure what the delay was for. \\n\\nClosing Thoughts: I really wanted it to be 5 star, but first outing couldn't get past a great experience into an amazing one. The vibe and the desserts were the best parts, while the general food was good without being exceptional. I would definitely go back just to sit at the oyster bar, especially during their happy hour with $1 oysters!"},{"name":"Juliano's Pizzeria","address":"15606 SE Mill Plain Blvd","city":"Vancouver","stars":"3.5","text":"Too many toppings on the pizza. It's so much so that you cannot pick it up and eat it you have to use a fork and knife. I'm from Chicago and I'm ALL ABOUT pizza! But the crust on this is so thin that the load of toppings is really all you taste (and the cheese) and also the crust gets ssuuuper soggy.  So if you like that kind of 'za, go for it!

The location of this VooDoo is located in such a sketchy area of the downtown zone but it still gets a lot of foot traffic so that must say something. When I went to this VooDoo it was a bit before sunset and the line was out the door. Surprise-surprise. Right next to this store there were just an abundant amount of homeless people chilling right outside, panhandlers and also some customers eating their doughnuts peacefully. \\n\\nThe one thing I loved about this VooDoo is that right across the street there is the iconic \\"Keep Portland Weird\\" mural. When you finally get past the line, the interior of this place is STRANGE. In a good Funky way, there is random knick-knacks on the walls and ceilings and a giant doughnut I died over. When you get to the register they have a revolving doughnut display case that shows you all the doughnuts they have. The ones they have on the bottom are all Vegan doughnuts and I was surprised by the selection they have. I ended up getting The Dirty Old Bastard, Viscous Hibiscus and Homer. \\n\\nThe Dirty Old Bastard: This one is Vegan! It was damn good. Doughnut dipped in chocolate frosting and then coated in Oreos and a drizzle of peanut butter. This was so good I couldn't even believe it was vegan. I loved how the peanut butter and the chocolate reminded me of a peanut butter cup. The oreos on top gave it a great crunch and the doughnut itself was soft and chewy.\\n\\nViscous Hibiscous: This doughnut I was not a fan of at all. I didn't like the tanginess it had nor the sprinkles they put on the other half. Honestly, I got it because it looked pretty and it seemed to be a popular one people tend to buy when it came to photos snapped. The flavor profile it had just didn't work out for my taste buds. \\n\\nHomer: I LOVED THIS DOUGHNUT. I asked the cashier which doughnut was her favorite and she told me it was this one... because it was pretty (YES LOL) and it was good! I wasn't expecting the doughnut to be strawberry flavored but it is! The frosting is flavored perfectly enough to get a subtle strawberry and the sprinkles on top just make it so damn cute. The doughnut dough itself was just as great as the other doughnuts I've tried but on this doughnut I just loved it so much. I wish mine had more sprinkles but it was a cute take on the classic Simpsons one you see. I would definitely buy this doughnut again -- for the photogenics & also because it was my fave. \\n\\nOverall, I can clearly see why VooDoo doughnuts is a Portland hotspot. The wacky names, crazy combinations and vegan selections they have to choose from fit what Portland is in a nutshell. It was just a bit of a disappointment how the area of this location made me feel a bit on nerve and it only takes cash (they have an ATM inside -- $3 charge for using it FYI) but aside from those little hiccups, VooDoo Doughnuts you are definitely Keeping Portland Weird!"},{"name":"Mexas Tacos","address":"8788 Vineland Ave","city":"Orlando","stars":"4.5","text":"The food is fantastic and the owner is so nice!

It was different and very tasty. Husband had eggs over easy, cinnamon raisin French toast, home fries and sausage (The Monster breakfast). French toast was huge and very good. Here is why I won't go back very often even though the food was very good:  1) expensive. With tax and tip $48. 2) even though the decor is 1950s/1960s retro, the music is very current and loud. We asked the server if they could turn it down a little and she said it was \\"kind of set\\" and it gets really loud when the place is full.

Locally run and owned in Billerica. It competes with the other bar/grills in the area and it's off to a good start. My wife and I went there today for lunch. We were greeted by the bartender (when you walk in you're right at the bar), a waitress, and the host. They will ask if it's your first time and ask if you're local. They really want to matter and be a good option in the area. On to the food...Very Good. Not Excellent, but very...very good. My wife and I both had the tomato bisque (thick, not like smooth creamy) which was good. She had the grilled cheese (she gave it an 8 out of 10), I had the buffalo chicken flatbread. The reason I say the food is very good/not excellent is because here is where it faltered. While the taste of the flatbread was perfect, the consistency of the chicken was UN-perfect. A little too over frozen and not thawed completely through when used. It wasn't raw mind you, just not soft...ya know? I can get past it, my wife would have left it alone entirely after the first chicken bite. BUT ENOUGH ABOUT THE NEGATIVE. The Royal Tavern is a must visit. Give it a try. Did I mention they have Boom Sauce IPA? Oh yeah! Great alcohol selection and the bar is safely separated from the rest of the restaurant if you're bringing the kids. Speaking of kids...bring 'em!

I've visited Amelie's flagship store in NoDa in Charlotte (review: http://www.yelp.com/biz/am%C3%A9lies-french-bakery-charlotte-3?hrid=zxUB16js0ZP8sWNhyc4wEw) and was impressed its late night popularity. When word came that Amelie's was going to open a spot in West Midtown, I thought it would be a great fit. Neighborhoods on the east side of Atlanta would have worked nicely as well.\\n\\nThe NoDa location is open 24/7 and it's one of the best things about the place. Amelie's Atlanta isn't open 24/7 and I'm not sure if it ever will be. A staff member told me months ago they eventually planned to expand to 24/7 operating hours, but it hasn't happened yet. Check the store's Facebook page (https://www.facebook.com/ameliesatl/) for the latest hours.\\n\\nAmelie's is located at the intersection of Northside Dr. and Marietta St. near Atlantic Station and Georgia Tech. For it's location, it has great (free) parking. Immediately next to and behind the bakery are ample spots. Amelie's main storefront faces Marietta St. If you park in the back, you can enter the bakery from a lower level door. Just take the stairs up. Photo: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/amelies-french-bakery-atlanta-8?select=DkQ8g6YVn2Y5l80M9uJwOg#DkQ8g6YVn2Y5l80M9uJwOg\\n\\nLike its other locations, Amelie's Atlanta has a very distinct look and feel. The bakery/cafe is spacious. Seating consists of a mishmash of mismatched tables, couches, and chairs, many of which look like they once belonged in someone's home. The mixture of French art and decor is eclectic and kitchsy. There's a replica of the Mona Lisa wearing shades with a comic book bubble that says \\"YUMM.\\" There are different style lamp shades, chandeliers, and light fixtures, including one impressively made with nothing but metal pots.\\n\\nThe setup is fast casual. Coffee, tea, and beverages are ordered much like you would at a Starbucks or other coffee house. If ordering food to dine-in, your cashier will hand you a number to place at your table. Napkins, silverware, etc. are self-serve.\\n\\nAmelie's has three display cases next to the ordering counter with a bevy of French pastries and cooked ready-to-eat foods including cakes (e.g. vanilla petit gateaux, chocolate petit gateaux), macarons (over a half dozen flavors), mini and large mousse cups, tarts, eclairs, cream puffs, brownies, creme brulee, bread pudding, pain perdu (French toast), savory quiche, palmiers (a.k.a. elephant ear pastries), macaroons (not to be confused with the aforementioned macarons spelled with one 'O'), muffins, savory \\"pockets\\" (kind of like Hot Pockets, but better, of course), croissants and other French breads and bread products. Expect to spend anywhere from $2-4 each for most of these items. The macarons are large and priced at $2.29 each.\\n\\nOn top of that, there's a food menu with soups of the day, tartines (small, open-faced, baguette sandwiches), regular sandwiches (e.g. chicken salad on a croissant, Croque Monsieur on housemade brioche), breakfast sandwiches, breads and spreads (over a half dozen spreads made in-house), and salads. Beverages include coffee (including French press coffee), hot chocolate, a plethora of loose leaf teas, and \\"fruitades.\\" Food portions are small. A bowl of soup, large (full) sandwiches and salads run about $6 each. Most drinks are about $2-4 each.\\n\\nI've tried all of the tartines, which include:\\nTomato basil pesto and mozzarella\\nHam and Gruyere\\nWild Mushroom Duxelle\\nSpinach and Asiago\\n\\nEven at full size, the tartines are tiny. They taste pretty good, though, and are made with fresh, good quality ingredients. My favorite tartine is the Wild Mushroom Duxelle. Duxelles is a paste/spread that has been made from finely minced mushrooms, onions, shallots, herbs, and butter. The Wild Mushroom Duxelle comes with cheese. It's a little salty, but exceptionally flavorful.\\n\\nThe tomato basil pesto and mozzarella tartine has juicy, ripe tomato slices and delicious basil pesto sauce. The ham and Gruyere tartine contains lots of tiny bits of chopped ham. The spinach and Asiago tartine has generous amounts of cooked spinach. All of the tartines are lightly toasted and crispy. I would consider them more for a snack than for a meal. If you're looking for something more substantial, order one of the regular sandwiches and pair it with a soup.\\n\\nThe butternut squash soup is light and tasty. It's reminiscent of a chicken broth and not too sweet.\\n\\nThe sweets are A-OK. The mini mousse cups are like little works of art. The soft and delicate macarons are quite big. The insides are smooth, creamy, and rich. They just melt in your mouth. \\n\\nI like their basic hand-pulled espresso coffee. It's refreshing.\\n\\nGood service.\\n\\nProbably the best thing about Amelie's is the plentiful seating options, making this bakery/cafe a convenient meeting place and hangout spot."},{"name":"Reale's Italian Cafe","address":"13450 N Hwy 183, Ste 230","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"I really do love Reale's pizza.

Great food, great drinks and terrific service. Here's what we had:\\n\\nCoal Roasted Onion Soup: This is K+D's take on French Onion Soup. Very savory and rich from the broth and the melted cheese. My favorite part is always the bread/crouton and cheese on any of these kinds of soups. If you're a fan of the actual soup, there's not too much of it. It's a nice start to the meal.\\n\\nSpicy Black Fried Rice with Squid: One of my favorites from the evening. It doesn't look like much, but it's so good because of the crispy fried rice which is black from squid ink. It reminds me of Korean bibimbap.\\n\\nGeorgia Trout: Not a single bone on this fish and it really surprised me. Basically, the trout is stuffed. It's interesting to me how \\"fluffy\\" the fish flesh was so it almost acts like rice with the vegetables served with the fish. Not much flavor so it's definitely for those who are seeking a healthy food option, but it's not something I would get again. \\n\\nSurf + Turf special: This was a special of the night that my boyfriend ordered. It's a prime rib cut with a crab leg. The crab leg has been pre-cracked so it's easy to eat. This dish comes with their famous spicy melted brown butter and also with a jus glaze that seem to be on the sweet side. I think there's molasses in this jus. The prime rib was very well-seasoned from the bite I tried.\\n\\nEggplant Caponata: This was a side dish that was really strong in flavor. If you don't like small anchovies, this isn't for you. It's got some interesting texture to it and yet it gets really sweet. When I ate this, I only wished the flavor could be taken a notch down. We had so much leftover from this, that we took it home and I ended up using it like a pasta sauce to downplay the flavor. I wouldn't get this again.\\n\\nRoasted Mushrooms on Toast: This came out differently than I imagined. Really creamy, and earthy from different kinds of mushrooms. It's kind of odd to have this as a side dish when I feel like it could be a appetizer or an entree because it's served on toast. While I appreciated it, it's not something I would get again because of how rich it is. \\n\\nThe cocktails at K+D are executed well. I laugh because unsurprisingly I got a non-alcoholic cocktail called The Devil and Miss Prym. It was a sweet and refreshing peach drink. I almost wish there was some alcohol in it, but if you have friends who don't like alcohol, there are at least 3 cocktails on the menu for them. There's also a Chapter 7 drink which is a 007 reference - it's served in a glass reminiscent of the Vespers cocktail in Casino Royale. \\n\\nIt's a little dark in there unless you sit near a window while it's still bright outside, but I like the decor: bookshelves, interesting artwork (including a moonwalking Stormtrooper if you look behind the hostess' booth), and casual. \\n\\nOverall, the food, I think, is more like 3.5 stars, but I'm bumping it up to a 4 because of the service. Our waiter was attentive, funny and knowledgeable about all the food prepared there and even told us about the chef's tasting you can do if you reserve ahead of time, or even how there is a loft space for small events. Parking is ample with the paid lot or valet, but I'd recommend the valet since tis' more surprisingly more economical because it's validated. I'd come back again to try other items on the menu. For being a Buckhead restaurant, it's surprisingly not too pretentious here."},{"name":"Tre'za","address":"804 Town Blvd","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3.5","text":"Delish! 1.75 bud lights, unique pizzas and yummo cookies!

I'm dining at this quaint and charming caf√© and bistro called Anis. Wish you were here! But... don't buy an airline ticket because I'm speaking French, this place is closer than you might think.\\n\\nAnis Caf√© and Bistro occupies a converted house on a side street in the Garden Hills neighborhood of Buckhead, not the south of France. It's full of personality and busting at the seams after enjoying over 20 years of award-winning success.\\n\\nAnis does both \\"Caf√©\\" and \\"Bistro\\" quite well.  Sit outside under the covered patio and have a glass of Gousseaume Sauvignon Blanc and a plate of Mussels Marinieres, with white wine, garlic, parsley and cream. The mussels are tender and you'll want to sop up the garlicky broth with a hunk of crusty French bread. Or order a Kronenbourg beer and a plate of Calamari Frit, nicely cooked and corn-meal dusted, with a Harissa remoulade providing a spicy kick. Yes, close your eyes and be transported to Provence. C'est si bon!\\n\\nThe popularity of Anis has not only caused it to physically expand to its limits with a variety of inside and outside dining options, along with a funky little bar, but also to expand its menu to dishes and price points that stretch the casualness and more forgiving atmosphere of a Caf√©/Bistro. Several of the dishes we tried were underdone and under seasoned not befitting of a kitchen whose dinner menu \\"Plats Principaux\\" range from $21-$33 an entr√©e. The service, while also suited for a casual environ, stumbled with the finer points. Orders were served in \\"roll call\\" style fashion; \\"Alright who had the chicken and who had the fish?\\" and additional glasses of wine, refills on water and additional utensils took repeated queries. \\n\\nThe Boeuf au Poivre, ordered by two at our table, was a fine piece of beef but both servings were undercooked, medium rare being rare and medium being medium rare. The accompanying cognac peppercorn sauce added a peppery heat but otherwise had little flavor. The Lyonnaise potatoes, roasted portabello mushrooms and sweet onions were a nice accompaniment but a meager portion for a dinner entree. The Poulet Roti, thyme roasted free-range chicken, was moist but needed seasoning and lacked a nicely browned and well-rendered skin.\\n\\nThe kitchen actually prepares \\"poisson\\" quite well and it was the highlight of our meal. The Truite Meuniere, a pan roasted trout with wilted greens, marinated artichokes and capers in a lemon brown butter was perfectly done, the fish flakey and firm. The Loup de Mer, the literal translation being \\"Wolf of the Sea\\", but really a European version of sea bass, was nicely cooked and perched atop a concoction of leeks, potatoes and a saffron nage, a poaching liquid thickened with flour and butter. It was a comforting dish but light enough to still enjoy in the warmer weather.\\n\\nThe dessert offerings were the usual French suspects. We opted for the profiteroles and the cr√®me brulee; both were faithful \\"exemples\\" of each. Several of our diner's preferences would have been that the caramel on the brulee be torch-fired just prior to serving so that it was not only crispy but warm as well.\\n\\nA quick check of a favorite local airline produced round-trip ticket prices from Atlanta to France of over $2000. So save your Euros and visit Anis Caf√© and Bistro. You'll have a \\"bon moment\\" if you let it show you its more casual roots."},{"name":"Two Urban Licks","address":"820 Ralph McGill Blvd NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"For some reason, I keep ending up here on dates.

Given buffets on Sundays are always tricky for lunch, I was hoping that it would still be good as they usually are very busy (which keeps the food fresh and coming, thus warm right?). The flavor was great as always, but everything was cold. We're talking room temperature. That's fine, as I have mentioned the flavor was good and we went there a lot. Then when it came time to pay, I realized that they charged us $10 bucks per person. That's not okay with me if I'm eating cold food.

I told her that she should probably change her sign for Sundays or not put the sign out at all. \\n\\nSo my complaint is misleading information.

I have also eaten at restaurants in Brazil ... nothing like these types of places. Still, the star of the show is always the meat. One other thing that must be a star of the show is the service. We ate at a Churrascaria in Atlanta once where they never came around with the meat ... I mean, what is the point. That place is one of my few one star reviews. NOT the case here. We were treated like prized customers from the moment we walked in, until the moment we walked out. Complete, constant attention. We had no longer returned from the salad bar, than they begin showing up with the meat. One reviewer said they had a dozen different types ... I agree, but cannot really confirm. It was all beautifully prepared ... from the bacon wrapped chicken, to the sausage, to the various beef options. The tri tip seemed to be awesome. Honestly, I lost track, and just kept saying \\"Yeah, give me a piece of that\\" until I nearly popped!

Sadly, the experience is even more severely tarnished by bartender staff who are either much more interested in talking with each other or playing their favorite game of looking thru customers like they don't exist and doing whatever they need to do to avoid actually serving drinks to customers. This is the second time I went to D'Amelio's and had to leave because bartenders were ignoring customers and room was dead and lifeless.

Why? Well, the servers are nice but always seem morose, or defeated, or something. I suspect that they are nice, good servers, but that the management here is very oppressive. Also, the toaster is set to ultra-light. Sometimes the bagel is not even warm. The workers know about it, and I hear people complain daily, but I guess the management won't change it. Why? Who the hell knows.  I've been frequenting this place 3-4 times per week for weeks now. The bagels are so damn good, but methinks the management needs to lighten up a bit.  Also, no tip line on the credit card receipts. I mentioned that to the counterperson and she said \\"yeah, nothing ever changes around here.\\"  That tells me a lot. I don't blame the workers for these problems. They are all very nice. Wish I could tip better the mornings I have no cash!]\\n\\nI love bagels. Or, at least I used to... when I lived in Seattle and for some short stints back east. One of my favorite breakfasts growing up was a toasted onion bagel with cream cheese, smoked turkey, tomato, and onion. Oh man, I do love that combo so much.  \\n\\nThen I moved to Oregon, a state that exists in a strange vortex that somehow repels good bagels and/or anyone who knows how to make one.... And beyond that, even at the Noah's in Oregon it's impossible to get the combo described above. Somehow they screw up and put mayo and mustard with the cream cheese. Who the hell would ever want that abomination?!?!\\n\\nAnd here comes Kettleman's!!! WOO HOO!!\\n\\nI finally stumbled across this place the other morning while sidetracked on the inner east-side.  I immediately jerked my car to the curb in front of the sidewalk bagel sign and jumped out with anticipation... if these bagels are anything as good as the people online claim them to be, I am freakin' STOKED!!!  \\n\\nI walk in the front door and am greeted by a big poster board displaying the story of how Kettleman's uses sustainable business practices. +1!!\\n\\nI walk inside the joint and am greeted by a clean floor plan, funky staff, a nice deli case full of delicious looking bagels, a stumptown coffee sign (+1), and a sign that reads:  \\"Specials: Whitefish salad, NY Style Potato Knish, Sat/Sun: Hand Made Bialy's, Bagel Dogs.\\"  OMG, this can't be real. I pinch myself to ensure that this is not some cruel dream. No, no evil genius has my brain on neural marionette strings. My Descartesian worries aside, I soak it in. It's the real deal!  I look above the counter to see the gold standard - a Boar's Head meat emblem. BAM! Boar's Head meat rules! +2.\\n\\nThe menu offers your usual bagel place fare - bagels+CCheese, bagels + PB&J, Bagels + Hummus, Lox, flavored CCheese, and a full line of cold and hot sandwiches (including a Reuben, intriguing!).  I decided to go for the Everything bagel with Lox and plain cream cheese. I was slightly disappointed by the high price - $5.95 (WOO, that's a tough one... -1).  \\n\\nI anticipated my impending indulgence all the way to my destination, and when I got there, I dug in. Oh mama... that's a good bagel.  It's not a NY bagel (impossible, the water's just not the same here), but its pretty damn close. What's more important, it's a real bagel. The first real bagel I have consumed in the full 9 years I have been living in this state (not counting when I went to NYC a few years ago - I had a ton of bagels when I was there, and the rare occasion when I shell out $13 for an H&H bagel at Mother's).  \\n\\nFINALLY, a place that knows how to make a decent bagel - and a decent bagel to order, at that.  The bagel itself was the perfect soft, slightly (ever so) chewy, not too wet, not too dry combination. Yuh-to-the-m-f'in-um!! The lox was par - nothing all that great, but not bad at all either. Not as good as Mother's house cured lox.  The cream cheese was whipped (mmmm) and tasty.  Bravo!\\n\\nI returned the next day to see if they could do it... make me my favorite combo without any hassle.  It did take some explaining, but they made it just right. An everything (instead of Onion) toasted with turkey, tomato and onion.  Oh man, just like I remember (except I never remembered paying $6 for it!).  Kudos to the real style boiled bagels at Kettleman's.  This place is gonna make me go broke.  \\n\\nI can't wait to return and sample a bagel with cream cheese and regular smoked salmon ($7, yowch). I bet it's gonna be BOMB!!!!!\\n\\nAll in all, I have to give 5-stars [now 4].

I love eating breakfast all day errday and haven't sampled much of the non-breakfast area of the menu, so can't speak to those items. \\n\\nThis is one of the few restaurants in town whose hash browns (called Potato Hash Cake) are made with shredded potato (my preferred style) rather than diced potato. I especially like that the fruit side item is a fruit of your choice rather than a fruit salad of mostly unripe melon like you might find at other restaurants. Ask your server which fruit options are available that day. For vegans, tofu egg substitutes and dairy-free milk & cheese alternatives are available. \\n\\nWait times can get quite long during peak weekend brunch hours, but you're able to view the estimated wait and snag a place on the list in advance with the Yelp app. The counter is self-seating, so keep an eye out for open stools.

The black version uses pork broth and therefore tastes denser and heavier due to the fat content. The white version has a mixed broth of pork and chicken which provides a lighter yet still flavorful broth. \\n\\nLocation: This location is smaller than their Atlanta Buckhead location (3714 Roswell Rd\\nAtlanta, GA 30342) and tends to have longer wait times. There also seems to be less parking, and does not have many shops in the same complex where you could walk around. Many other shops around here are also restaurants, so I typically like to wait in my car until we receive the message stating that our table is ready.\\n\\nWait Time/Reservation: Because you are unable to make reservations ahead of time, you must check in with the hostess at the front. The hostess will take your name and number of people in the party, and the text message you receive from Jinya usually states your estimated wait time too.  During some of Jinya's busiest times, we have had to wait 45+ mins to be seated, but it is well worth the wait!!\\n\\nService: The two main reasons why I believe Jinya is worth the wait is because of the excellent service from all staff members and the kitchen's speed at pumping out their delicious foods. Even if you are unable to contact your initial waiter/waitress, all staff members are always more than happy to assist you to put in more food orders, refill drinks, or grab more napkins too. And, the ramen has always arrived in a timely manner with a piping hot, fresh batch of broth, toppings, and perfectly cooked noodles. \\n\\nWriting this review has made me excited to visit a Jinya Ramen Bar location again soon. I would highly recommend trying a Jinya Ramen Bar location, either here or better yet the Atlanta Buckhead location, preferably right when they open at 11AM any day of the week if possible.

We like supporting locally-owned businesses and really liked the old concept, but never quite found time to visit.\\n\\nAs much as we wanted to love this, the \\"Grand Opening\\" of Engine 2 Taphouse was a huge disappointment. When we arrived, we entered the bar which was extremely loud and had no high-top tables so we could watch the football games. The only 2 high-tops were wedged against the window with uncomfortable stools. Given the layout challenges and extreme noise, we opted for the dining room. \\n\\nOur table was one of two which were occupied in the entire GIANT dining room. You'd think that we'd get GREAT service and attention, right? You would be wrong.\\n\\nThe server was very nice, but was not attentive. We waited for drinks most of the time we were there. She rarely checked on us during our visit.\\n\\nThe first 3 items we tried to order - 2 beers and a flavor of wings were not available. You'd also think that the menu would be up-to-date for the \\"Grand Opening.\\" Not so much. We complained to the server who told us that this was typical, and she knew that it \\"sucks.\\" I've never had a server tell me that she knew her place of employment sucked, the owner knew, and did not care before.\\n\\nWe got some wings which were delicious. They had a great smoky taste and the sauces - chipotle and mango habanero were great. Very good. Our server brought us small plates for our wings. One of them was dirty (some sort of disgusting orange sauce baked onto the plate). We wanted to send it back, but our server didn't come back after about 5 minutes, so we used it as a bone plate. Not a good first impression.\\n\\nFor our entrees, we ordered fish-and-chips (my wife) and a half rack of ribs (me). The fish-and-chips were passable, nothing special. Instead of regular french fries, they came with potato wedges - not ideal. They also server off-brand Sysco ketchup - disgusting. The ribs were delicious. I had the hogwash sauce with them which had a nice taste and spice. Very good. I also got baked beans (which were supposed to be included with the price of the entree) with the ribs. The beans were good, but I was charged $1.99 for the beans when the bill came.\\n\\nThe service was friendly but slow. Our server rarely checked on us, and we waited a long time to order beers and to receive them while we were waiting on the bartender to pour them. We tried to complain about the extra charge for the baked beans, but our server never came to check on us again. We also never talked to the owner during the (less than) \\"Grand Opening.\\" We thought we saw him talking to some regulars, but he never talked to us.\\n\\nI hate to say it, but we'll be skipping this place on our normal list of Smyrna haunts.

I almost had to go all out and chain of them nice inidan men next to me so that they can keep pouring hahahaha... then, on top of that, there is NO CORK FEE. so you can bring your own wine and beer as much as you want without any extra cost!! Now, the free champagne and beer I believe is only during the holiday menu and that is at 25 bucks a pop!\\n\\nThis is my first time, for NYE dinner, so I dont know what they have on normal days.\\n\\nThe food was also the bomb-diggity.

I've never been there. This is solely about the cinnamon rolls my wife brought home from a trip to Atlanta. \\n\\nThe cinnamon rolls come packaged by the dozen in an aluminum tin with a clear plastic top. I hate to compare them to Little Debbie Pecan Spinwheels, but size-wise that was my first thought when I saw them. We've become so accustomed to large billowy cinnamon rolls with icing. These are not them. \\n\\nInstead, these are small cinnamon bombs. Good gracious, they are wound in tight spirals and packed with cinnamon goodness. In a \\"regular\\" cinnamon roll, the outside tends to be a bit drier and so you save the moist tender center for the very end. These are more dense, but they're consistent through and through. They seem to have ground an entire cinnamon stick for each layer, and it's a good quality cinnamon. These is a significant, long-lasting aftertaste that's so pleasurable it makes you want to go back for more. \\n\\nI'll admit I've not met many cinnamon rolls I haven't liked (though I'm not big on Cinnabons). No, Mary Mac's aren't the best cinnamon rolls I've ever had. I'm fairly stingy with that fifth star, and it generally takes something pretty unique to earn it. These do.

There are a variety of different types of ramen as well as various small bites to try. The wait for 2 around 12:45 on Saturday was 1 hour 10 min. I feel like this could actually increase since I went fourth of July weekend and a lot of people are out of town (or maybe it will go down). They don't have a lot of seats so coming with a big party might be a challenge.\\n\\nFood\\nEverything we tried was really good. I started out with the Jinya bun ($4). The pork was soft and delicious. I opted for the Cha Cha Cha garlic lovers ramen ($13.50). The pork chashu was super succulent and fell apart in my mouth. I loved the thick noodles and the broth was very rich (it was a bit heavy and oily due to the pork but I don't mind that). They give you extra garlic on the side with a garlic crusher if it isn't garlicky enough (I used extra garlic ). I opted to get the combo and added a side salad and crispy chicken kaarage. The chicken came with 3 pieces and was crispy and seasoned well. If you want to add extra spice they have a few different seasoning options (chili powder, ramen seasoning). My friend got the Jinya #1, the spicy chicken ramen ($11.50). The broth was very tasty and it comes with chicken chashu and thin noodles. I preferred my dish. The chicken chashu was just chicken breast and was a bit dry. Overall, I think pork gives a better broth flavor. He got the chashu rice as his side for the combo. The chashu was a bit sweet but overall pretty tasty. There are various toppings you can also choose to add (such as a boiled egg or bamboo shoots).\\n\\nService\\nWhen you are going to get seated everyone will yell out a greeting in Japanese. Our server was awesome. She made some recommendations and constantly made sure we were doing okay and that our water was full.\\n\\nAtmosphere\\nThe restaurant itself is pretty small. There are two bar areas to sit at and a few tables inside. There are also seats outside but this Georgia heat with hot ramen doesn't make it the best place to sit. However, the wait is significantly shorter (or no wait at all) if you are willing to brave the heat. It's not too loud inside.\\n\\nOverall experience\\nI really enjoyed my experience and the food.

Here it is at the corner of Chickesaw Trail and Curry Ford nestled in a sub appealing strip mall next to a nails parlor.  When you walk in don't expect any frills. It's bare bones a few booths couple of tables and a bar where they serve bottled beer out of a cooler.  You'll see and hear everyone in the restaurant where it can fill up around the dinner time rush. If you walk to the back (four steps) you will see greg all alone in the kitchen and what I believe are his wife and possibly daughter working the dining room.  There is a constant flow of carry-out orders being picked up at the front. The vibe inside feels like a Soviet Key West only because of the simplicity of the restaurant and what wall art there is consists of some UM Memorabilia and a few pictures of the beach.  I highly recommend the wings. The sauces are all made to order and most are worth a try. Don't forget the burgers and pretty darn good as well. He also serves steaks and usually a fried fish special (last was Fried Alaskan Swordfish, maybe), both are top notch. Just beware it closes at 8 pm on most days and 8:30 PM on Friday and Saturday. Closed on Sunday and Monday. Been around for 16 years.

Arrived on a Sunday night before 8PM without a reservation and was seated relatively quickly without much of a wait (less than 5 mins). We (party of 2) were led to a small table in the middle of the dining area, not directly by the windows but the next table over and a few spots away from the live Jazz band. \\n\\nMy mom and I took some time looking over the drinks, food, and dessert menus and deciding what we should order as it was our first time here that we didn't notice how long it took for our male waiter to ask us what we wanted to drink or provide napkins + utensils. (The table was bare with four plates, as if they had just cleared it off from the last customers.)\\n\\nWe first asked for some water, and the waiter returned at least 15 minutes later, saying it was \\"very busy\\"-- the place was fairly packed with customers. We decided to eat light and got calamari ($10), a lemonade ($5.75 WHAT REALLY though, it was too sweet nothing homemade or extraordinary. Non-alcoholic drinks aren't listed on their menu nor are prices so this was a shock on the bill), and a Bud Light ($6). The appetizer again took quite a long time to show up at our table but tasted decent with the aioli and marinara sauce. I had to repeatedly look around for our waiter, who seemed frequently attentive to his other tables compared to us and didn't even come by to ask how things were. I asked for another lemonade, so he took my empty glass and didn't return for a good 15-20 minutes. We finally ordered dessert, their warm chocolate cake ($11) which was very delicious (nice way to end the meal!) and asked for our check.\\n\\nEven though the tab was visibly ready to be picked up right away, the waiter went missing again. He actually passed right by us after serving some drinks at the table next to us as if he was ignoring us. Later, I had to wave to him to indicate the bill was ready and again, he took a very long time to return to us. We were eventually STANDING at our table, ready to leave because it was already close to 10PM at that point (I kid you not, we spent too long there because of the missing waiter) and STILL the waiter didn't pay any attention to us and I saw him taking orders down the hall at another table. The other staff had already cleared off our table at this point. I told another waiter that we're waiting to get the bill back for tips and he had to talk to the hostess who talked to the waiter. Finally we left, on a happy note because the ambiance and views were nice, but this poor waiter (possibly named \\"JeanA\\" as on the bill) could have easily ruined our experience.\\n\\nAlso, for a seemingly high-end place the bathrooms looked shabby and not very clean or organized."},{"name":"Banjo Coffee","address":"38 N Avondale Rd, Ste B","city":"Avondale Estates","stars":"4.5","text":"Great teas and cold brew coffee.

We came for a Friday night out but it ended up being a bad experience turned good.   The waiter was very nice and professional but slow in refilling our drinks.    Our \\"small plates\\"  were delicious and well prepared but when we got to our main dishes, it was horrible.   I had the shrimp and blacken flounder that had NO blackened seasoning and was burnt on the bottom.   The rice was also burnt but the shrimp were very well cooked and delicious.     My boy had the short rib which came out beautifully but tasted horrible.  The collard greens tasted if someone had poured super sweet ghetto red kool-aid on them and they were lukewarm at best.   The mac and cheese was pure mush because the noodles where way overcooked and the short rib although very tender and well cooked was on a pile of half cooked potatoes with no garlic at all that tasted as if there were from a box nor where there any onion curls as stated in the menu.   Our sever who was excellent did apologize but as we were enjoying our outstanding drinks (there were dayum good) they kept paying Gospel music on a Friday night.   I could understand a Sunday brunch but the last thing I want to hear chilling on a Friday night after work at Hip Hop Restaurant is Gospel Music especially since we both are not Christians.  BUT, the experience was very nice because they manager came over and went out of his way to make it right.  They took the meals off our bill and offered us a free dessert.

Aside from In-N-Out Burger out West (and only because there is currently 1 Five Guys location in all of California) this is by far the best burger and fries you will find, hands down.  All of the burgers come from 99% lean, fresh, never-frozen beef, and the fries are cooked in 100% peanut oil for zero cholesterol.\\n\\nI will agree with Ryan F. - these are also some of the best hot dogs you will find anywhere, but with how delicious the burgers are I find it difficult for me to forego eating a burger on a day just for a hot dog!  I guess on a day when I'm really hungry I can have both, but you'll be hard-pressed to finish a burger (2 patties) and fries (usually an enitre bag) by yourself.  The fries are best shared between at least two people to make sure you get the best bang for your buck.\\n\\nAlso, if you're a vegetarian, I find it confusing that you would go to \\"Five Guys Famous BURGERS & Fries\\" looking for a vegetarian meal...?  You can order a bun with the all the fixings minus the meat (again 100% fresh fixings) but then what's the point!\\n\\nDefinitely try it out.  You won't be disappointed, unless of course you're expecting a typical Fast Food experience like some of the reviewers here.  Five Guys is NOT a fast food restaurant - do not make that mistake.

On my way walked back to hotel, I noticed something about Voodoo cross the street. No line and lights were still on. Apparently not much people there at Monday night. Boy did I get lucky! There were only four people in front of me in the store.\\n\\nI love their decoration. The big neon sign, colored glass windows, pink/yellow/green colored walls...It feels like in Willy Wonka's Chocolate Factory. And so many unique flavors of donuts in the rotating glass display. Pretty neat.\\n\\nWe got their signature donuts, maple and bacon, voodoo, fruit loop...they're all very good with soft and puffy texture. I really like that they used big slice of bacon instead of small pieces in some other donut stores. The chunky texture of bacon goes really great with the soft donut. The voodoo donut and other flavors are great too, but the maple and bacon one is the best.\\n\\nNow, the main questions. How does Voodoo donuts compare with other stores? Is it a tourist trap or something real? In my opinion, it's a really nice store with unique decoration and nicely flavored donuts. It definitely worth a visit or two. However, no matter how good the donuts are, they do not worth 40 mins waiting line.\\n\\nSo, it you visit Portland, I'd suggest to arrive Voodoo late to avoid long line, and you can get a box of very tasty donuts in 5 mins."},{"name":"Dynamic Dish","address":"427 Edgewood Ave SE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"I just went to the Dynamic Dish on Edgewood today for the first time.  It has gotten tons of postivie reviews so I wanted to see what all the fuss was about.  It was so worth it.  \\n\\nThis small restaurant is very hard to spot on Edgewood in b/w Blvd and Jackson St (FYI: it's next to the thrift shop, across from ANIMAL EDGEWOOD or so the sign says) but when you walk inside the door you feel you have walked into a cute and simple cafe in a small town.  The tables and chairs (only a few so get there early) are mismatched and farmhouse style, none of the plates match, and the artwork on the walls are powerful sea scenes.   \\n\\nMy friends and I started off with iced green tea with sweetened with agave nectar.  Very fresh and delicous; perfect for a summer night.  The waitress then brought us water in these tiny candle holder looking glasses (be forwarned if you are a water chugger that you will constantly be thirsty).  We ordered 4 of the 5 entrees listed (The menu changes daily based on whats freshest that day.  The first thing we ordered was the gazpacho, which I was told was the least favorite thing- I hate tomatoes so I didn't even attempt to try it. We also ordered a rosemary-encrusted tofu and pest wrap that came with coleslaw (the wrap was fabulous, the coleslaw bland), a salad that consisted of raw turnip greens, lemon quinoa, and roasted pumpklin seeds (our favorite dish), and an antipasto (sp) plate that had roasted veggies, which consisted of eggplant, squash, and zucchini,  a tomato salad ( I didn't try, my friends loved though), and my FAVORITE, a grilled fennel sald with goat cheese.  Everything was absolutely delicious and the flavors melded together perfectly.  For desert we ordered ruhbarb compote that came with homade vanilla icecream with a dusting of black pepper.  I would never have tried black pepper with icecream and fruit, but it really worked.  \\n\\nThis restaurant was one of the best I have ever eaten at and that's not just in the veg category, that's all categories; veg, meat, seafood, whatever.

The location is great! The atmosphere is great great!! But the execution makes it one of the worst hangouts in Atlanta. \\n\\nCommunion operates on a token system. As soon as you get in, you're swiping your credit card to buy tokens. That's already pretty annoying if you're like me and you hate food festivals and such where you have to buy tickets. \\n\\nTo add another level of annoying, it takes two 5 dollar tickets to get a normal sized beer. 10 DOLLARS FOR A BEER. That's waaaaaay too much. Also, relatively normal wine is also $10 for a regular sized pour. We aren't talking super fancy stuff either.\\n\\nThe prices aren't right for the setting. It looks and feels like a casual place to pre or post game in conjunction with an outing at Revival, but it's too expensive to justify going. I would recommend that they drop the tokens concept altogether, adjust the prices to normal standards, and then let the world know that it's time to come back.

My mother in law called and asked if they could accommodate our large party of 22 before we even went there and they said yes. Fast forward ton dinner....we arrive at 5:30 like stated and they tell us they have no seats for us even though we called and they said the table would be ready at that time. We waited another 20 mins and they finally said they were ready for us. We walk over to our table and realize that we would be sitting at two different tables. This normally wouldn't bother me because I know large parties are hard to accommodate but they told us they would do one table. And now the subpar food...I expect Italian food to have great flavors, like a grandma cooked it all night. Their food was good but tasted like it was from a pizza place at best. I typically love Italian food but I only ate this food because I was starving.

Because anyone from Seattle or anyone who has eaten at Din tai fung can immediately tell the difference. Thus there isn't much to compare this to within Portland. \\n\\nThese are hipster xiao long bao. \\nUgh, I can't believe I said that. \\n\\nNow if you've NEVER had soup dumplings then sure, give it a go.

This just isn't cutting it. The positive reviews are mainly from people who've never had XLB or immersed in asian food.\\n\\nAside from the meticulous task of forming the dumplings themselves (they got this right!) XLB needs to focus on the food quality. \\n\\nBefore during my first visit every thing lacked essence, aromatics, and salt.

After a wait of about 30 minutes, we were seated inside and ready to go.  Meal took about hour and half but was honestly good pace.  Waitress gave good recommendations and we opted for the full fish and the hush puppies.  Extremely full by the end and super satisfied.  Hush puppies came with 7 for $8 which is quite a deal.  Lots of corn meal and and a fantastic cheese sauce made this a must order to share.  Full fish was exceptional and reminded me of a Chinese or Thai version.  Though they said no bones, definitely felt a lot with each bite.But spicy and some of the best crab curry sauce I've ever had.  Fine fish and again, such a filling dish.  At $52 it better fill me up, but really a great sharing entree and a very traditional meal for Austin.  Wine on the more expensive end at $12-14, but pretty solid quality and you can taste before committing.  No cocktails and poor beer selection, so stick to the grapes.

Score! This place was superb - it has been a long time since I've had a meal this good. I'll break down my review into segments, so I don't forget anything... \\n\\nAmbiance: We were seated in the Pearl Wine Shop, which was a long private \\"wine cellar\\" with a long banquet table. Our group was 16 people, and that's exactly how many chairs there were, so it was a perfect fit. The rest of the restaurant was very loud, and the upper floor was pretty warm due to the open kitchen, so I'm glad we had the private room (much quieter and cooler). It's worth a trip up to the top floor to check out the kitchen though! There was a classical guitarist up there as well. \\n\\nServer: Ugh, I meant to remember his name, so I could include it, but I forgot. He was AMAZING! Very knowledgeable about the food and ingredients, fluent (or partially fluent) in Spanish, and just an all around personable guy. He had great recommendations and he put together a nice tapas spread for us.  (Edit: My colleague said his name was Robert!)\\n\\nPre-dinner cocktails: I didn't order one myself, but I tried the Pisco Sour, Mojito, Caipirinha, and Sacsayhuaman. They were all good, but the Caipirinha was EXCELLENT, and the Sacsayhuaman was very interesting (passion fruit & pepper vodka). \\n\\nPre-dinner bread & dip: I could have seriously only eaten this! The sauces were amazing! The three sauces were a green mint/spicy thing, mango/spicy, & a peanut/cheese/mild one. I kept going down the row, trying each of them, and I couldn't decide which was my favorite. \\n\\nWine: We ordered bottles of white and red, but I only had the red. It was the Tamarack Firehouse Red (Cab/Syrah) and one of the cheaper bottles on the menu at $38, but it was very good and the price was right. \\n\\nTapas: Our server put together a selection of large plates which included Esparragos Peruanos (Asparagus), Chorizo, Empanadas Caseras de Carne (Beef Empanadas), Picadillo Acebichado (Beef Tartare), Chicharron de Pollo (Crispy Chicken), Anticucho de Pollo (Chicken Kabobs), Anticucho de Corazon (Beef Kabobs), Yuca Rellena (Cheese Stuffed Yuca). I liked every single thing I tried, but my favorites were the Empanadas and the Yuca Rellena. \\n\\nEntree: The menu is divided into \\"Novo-Andean\\" and \\"Traditional\\" main courses. I figured that since I don't typically eat Peruvean food that I should stick with the \\"Traditional\\" dishes, but I couldn't help myself... I ordered the Bistec Novoandino, a filet mignon. I've had better steaks before, but it was still pretty excellent, with a dark & tasty beer sauce. The accompaniments were also good... a humita (best way to describe this is a meatless tamale) & some veggies (potatoes, leeks, etc). \\n\\nDessert & Coffee: I ordered the Plato de Crema Quemada, three ramekins of creme brulee. All 3 exotic flavors (lime coconut, passion fruit, guava) were delicious, and the plating was gorgeous. I also tried the Torta de Chocolate (Chocolate Torte - AMAZING!), Capuli Truffle (the perfect small bite for a \\"taste\\" of sweet), & ice cream (it was a unique flavor..carmelly, not quite sure what it was).  For coffee they serve Stumptown, which from what I gather is pretty popular in Portland. \\n\\nSo, yeah, now that I've deconstructed the entire experience, I'll get back to my main point...

Luckily, we were able to get there in time for happy hour in the restaurant. The food and drink selections were definitely awesome.

It was loud especially for those families that have little ones so we tried to sit outside but it was a little chilly as the soon was starting to go down. Our server was friendly and was nice enough to move us inside. The food was mediocre as well as the beer selections they had. We ordered the Philly cheesesteak, burger, mani sandwich, and chicken tenders with fries for the toddler.

The portion was hefty and the flavor was good; however, there was something left to be desired. The rice had a good selection of vegetables and there was  a fried lobster tail that sat on top of the pile of rice. Seems like it would be better if lobster pieces were throughout the portion of rice. I ordered the seafood spring rolls on both trips and that was a delicious appetizer. I ordered the calamari on the second trip and that was also yummy. The pineapple dipping sauce had a very good flavor and meshed well with the calamari.

I've had your first donut back in 2015 at your Eugene, OR location. \\nIt was just aiiight, tbh.\\n\\nFor the 2nd time, I was able to visit the ORIGINAL Downtown Portland location - and well, it was aiiight - but the location was so-so. I wasn't impressed that it seemed sketchy when we went (probably because we went at night - it's not advisable, just go in the daytime!) | parking would be better at night, though - you could snag a spot right close to it, but there would be some panhandlers near you. Stay safe & sound!\\n\\nOn another note, I was blown away & taken aback by the creativity and variety of selection, however the taste - not so much. It seemed that with all the glitz, and glamour, and dazzle of each donut & how it was made/decorated - it simply fell way below my expectations of how it's originally in Portland & what's it made it famous & quite popular. It does meet the average doughnut expectation, but if you're asking of the freshness of the quality & the distinctiveness of Voodoo Doughnuts from other donut shops/chains, it just wasn't there. It seems odd I'm still giving a 5-star review, but, for the sake of its uniqueness and weirdness, then why not?! The other plus side, is their workers are SUPER friendly and accommodating! Having stepped in around 10 or 11 p.m.- ish on a weekend night, the workers didn't show no sign of being lazy, or having ignored us once we stepped inside - but rather, catered to our needs & asked us what we wanted! Good customer service is always a good sign for quality service, wish I could say that about their donuts LOL.\\n\\nOverall, it's just all for show, and nothing quality about it - I guess it's truly about quality NOT quantity. It really is all about the hype here at Voodoo. If you haven't eaten a doughnut here, you aren't missing out on much. You can simply go to your local grocery store, pick up a box of cereal, grab a glazed or chocolate doughnut from your local doughnut shop, and throw everything together. That's just how i feel.

Got seated around 7 pm in an overflow area that looked like the kids table at a bad thanksgiving meal where I had to get up to allow servers to pass to get to the tables beside us.  Asked to be moved and waited 40 minutes for another table and watched as others complained about being seated at the same table we started with.  Once seated at 6 top for 2 of us after waiting 40 minutes, the disaster continued.  No bread service, limited water service and when the meal was over they scraped the crumbs from the table into my husband's lap.  We couldn't stop laughing....  They comped our meal-- and when we told the server the manager was doing that he stormed away and didn't even acknowledge us.  The worst part is that the owners were all there tonight and it didn't matter.  Don't waste your time or money.  There are lots of steakhouses in this area that will treat you like a human. \\nOn a side note-- when waiting in the valet line for our car, the people in front of us had a similar experience.

You are literally next to everything. I also work in the area as well so this spot is very convenient. It does get very crowded during lunch hours, and seating can become limited. My advice would be to order takeout, and find some seating elsewhere during busy hours. When it is not so busy, I like to sit at the bar, or outside on the patio. Even when it's cold, they have outside lamp heaters that are comforting. Inside at the bar, the decor is amazing and I find it satisfying to watch the chefs do their thing. The noodles are timed to perfection! They literally have timers for each batch of noodles and every order is always fresh!\\n\\nFood: What is there not to like about Ramen? My go to is the Spicy Chicken Ramen but you can customize any Ramen the way that you want it. I substitute regular thin noodles, for this spinach noodles for only $2 extra. There are about 25 different items you can customize your ramen with. I try to go as traditional as possible without omitting things that i am unfamiliar with, i mean, why take away the experience of authentic food. The seasonings they provide are on point however, so anytime I get a To-go order, I always make sure I get some seasoning on the side and some spicy sauce!

Our reservations observed, we were seated downstairs in a more private dining area (mildly disappointed to be seated away from the lively atmosphere with the live band).\\nAgree debating over what to order, we finalized on:\\n- tres salsas con pan: potato and quinoa bread served with three salsas. The bread was perfectly soft and each salsa boasted it's own, unique flavor. Our favorite was the green salsa with the chili kick.\\n- \\"5 elementos\\" cebiche: definitely tasty, with an interesting serving style of shredding corn of the cob and chopping a slice of sweet potato into the ceviche. That stated, it wasn't a new or un-had dish that made us yearn to return\\n- Yucat√°n croquettes: by far my favorite tapa of the night!! The Yucat√°n croquettes were stuffed with cheese and served over a creamy yellow sauce. Paired with the green salsa from the tres salsas con pan, it was a hit!\\n- lomos saltados: the steak was perfectly cooked in a perfectly salty sauce, and it was accompanied by yucas fritas and rice- large portion perfect for sharing!\\n\\nMy husband enjoyed a pi√±a mojito (which I enjoyed as my second drink), and I started with a ginger based cocktail. Both drinks were delicious, the finer strong yet well blended in mine, and the pineapple flavor leaving one feeling fresh for his. I opted for the pi√±a mojito round two primarily because my fingers were getting sticky from the sugar lining my martini glass for the ginger cocktail.\\n\\nOf course, I couldn't resist dessert, and we ended up trying their version of flan and an alfajore. The flan came topped with pecans- this addition made the dessert a well balanced flavor. The cookie of the alfajore was perfect- crispy but buttery and \\"melt in your mouth\\" goodness.\\n\\nOverall, food was 5/5, ambiance 4/5 (would have loved to sit in the main seating area, and service was 4/5 (majority of the servers were very helpful and pleasant, but there was one server who brought us dishes a couple times and she was already walking away before completely describing what she brought to the table).\\n\\nWorth a visit if you're in town!"},{"name":"Leaf Vegetarian Restaurant","address":"1710 Pearl St","city":"Boulder","stars":"4","text":"I have returned here multiple times and have become less and less impressed.

We never had a dirty plate or empty glass throughout our meal. We ordered the dry red curry rub and honey garlic traditional wings as well as mango habanero in boneless.

I think there is even a meatless option for vegans and vegetarians.\\n\\n \\n\\nMy favorite dish I had by far had to be the salmon. I don't usually order salmon at restaurants because it's usually some dry, bland mess. I'm not sure what possessed me to order the salmon, but I am glad I did! It came beautifully seared with a pineapple glaze and topped with grilled pineapple rings. The salmon was incredibly moist and flaky, and bursting with flavor. The best part was the rice, which at first glance seems to be plain white rice, but is actually a fragrant coconut milk infused rice.\\n\\n \\n\\nIt is the perfect place for families, casual date night, or even sporting events.

Looking at other people's pictures here, they have charring on their crusts, too, and seemed love the pizza, so maybe that's the way it's supposed to be???  Whatever it is, I don't care for burnt crust pizza.  The meatballs were pretty decent, though definitely not worth $11 for 5 medium-sized meatballs.  The peaches were interesting and tasty, and the okra was pretty good, too.  We also got the onion pizza, which was ok, and the fennel sausage pizza, which was pretty good, minus the charring.  The strawberry shortcake and hazelnut desserts were pretty good, too, though very rich.

Literally I walked right passed it lol!! :P\\n\\nThe Red Accordian is both warm and cozy, eclectic and charming; you must appreciate the attention to detail. Cozy couches, retro lamps, cute little tea pot candle holders, wicked art on the walls that you can purchase. They have even decorated for Christmas with a nice big tree and fake snow on the windows. \\n\\nThe service was prompt, friendly and authentic. I was seated quickly with my pick of the open tables. The bartender/?manager and my server were both on their \\"A game\\". I found my server to be knowledgeable with the menu and the wine list, and she seemed genuine in receiving my feedback. I didn't really care for my red wine, which was the Malbec, I found it tasted more like a blend. I'm just a picky wine drinker, but we were able to have a chat about the wines and she offered me a taster of a different wine for my second glass. My second glass was awesome! \\n\\nFood wise the menu is wonderful; not too big or too small. Bunch of share plates to choose from and I can't wait to try them all! I tried the hummus with fried dough, which I was hesitant about, but it was dangerously tasty. The dough reminded me of a Mexican Sopapia (hopefully I got that right) or Mexican sweet bread! The Hummus waso tasty as well. I also tried the Humboldt Squid, which was tasty. The squid wasn't overly battered or fried and the pieces were a nice meaty size and cooked just right. This is strip style or chunks, no baby squids or generic rings. I did think it would be better with some spice, but I like my spice :). We gave the tacos that were on special a try as well, but I can't say I cared for them much. The chicken was super greasy and messy, but the flavour wasn't bad. The prawn was the opposite, too dry and lacked ingredients. My date ate the third one without offering me a bite, so I cannot comment on that one. Finally, the beet salad. I enjoyed this salad very much. I love beats, and if you do too you will enjoy this dish as well. Colorful beats are paired perfectly with goatcheese, arugula and nuts. My only complaint for this dish was I thought it was quite small for the price of $16.\\n\\nBonus.... Happy hour exists.

Although of no use to me, there is a kid's area for all your hungry parents!\\n\\nNow to something with room for improvement - the food cart selection. I understand food cart availability is somewhat inconsistent and often varies from time to time, but in a city famous for food carts, the ones available here are just above average, not good, not great, just above average. On a regular day, there will be about 10-15 carts open, and the prices are fair but not great. Lastly, parking can be difficult at times, especially after everyone gets off work or during holidays. Often we have to park on the residential streets during those times and walk over, but during off times, the small lot suffices.\\n\\nOverall, I think this is a good place for friends and family hangouts if you are down to spend a bit more time than what you would normally spend at a food truck pod - sit down, chat, have a drink, and enjoy the time."},{"name":"Storybook Dining at Artist Point with Snow White","address":"901 Timberline Dr","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"The atmosphere was good.

So in the spirit of fairness, Blue gives it a solid 4. I will explain why I am giving 3 ...\\n\\nWe were in town for business and after a slightly disappointing meal the night before, were looking for a true Portland gem.  After hopping on Yelp we spotted Stammtisch, and began to drool over the pictures of big fat sausages. We were sold.\\n\\nIn Utah, where we are from, there is really only ONE German place in the whole of the state, and it's downtown and only open during odd hours, so to find a German place here was a real treat.\\n\\nThey have their menu broken up into Small, Medium, and Big plates.  Blue and I both ordered from the Medium section because those were the meals that looked the best to us, and not necessarily for the size (although we were both fairly hungry). Blue got the 3 combo sausage plate and I got the chop steak roll. His meal was around $16, and mine around $12. This seems standard for a meal in the area, and we were excited to get our Weiner on.\\n\\n\\nThe food took a little more than 20min to arrive after we ordered. Every time I heard the kitchen bell ring my hopes would perk up only to be dashed when I saw plates being delivered to other tables.  Finally the blessed moment arrived and our food was placed before us.  Blues was impressive, three good sized sausages atop a pile of sauerkraut and two pickles... Mine on the other hand... Maybe not as impressive. Beautiful yes, but size wise it was a modest portion of meat atop a smear of mashed potatoes and 4 small roasted carrots.\\n\\nAll of it was good, and excellent quality, that you could tell. My biggest gripe isn't the size of the meal actually, it was that I felt like every component of both meals (with the exception of the sauerkraut) was seriously lacking in salt. I understand the desire to not over salt your food, since that can just as easily ruin the meal, but the thing is... there were no salt or pepper shakers on the table.\\n\\nNow, I realize that in some restaurants it is considered an insult to the chef to ask for salt, which is why some restaurants will not put salt out on the tables.  Not putting salt on the table is a chefs way of saying, \\"Trust me, you aren't going to need it.\\" Sometimes, it's true. Sometimes things are so perfectly seasoned that the thought of adding even one grain of salt more would be like painting a mustache on the Mona Lisa. There is the flip side however, and that is the scenario I found myself in where my meal was lacking salt, and I, not wishing to offend, did not ask for salt, and therefore, did not enjoy my meal the way I would have liked. This is why I went with 3 instead of 4 stars. I know it might sound a little nit picky, but salt truly can make or break the enjoyment of an entire meal. \\n\\nGreat place, good find, glad we came in!"},{"name":"Rosie's Coffee Cafe","address":"2330 Sylvan Rd","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"I wish I could do 0 stars\\n\\nHere from out of town and my friend saw this place online with 4 stars and pictures showing the food looking pretty good. \\n\\nWhen we arrived the parking lot was full. \\n\\nWhen we walked in the place was full as well so we had to wait 15min to be seated. \\n\\nWhen seated the waitress came over 5min later and took our drink order. \\n\\nWhen she came back with the drinks we placed our order. \\n\\nWait wait wait  then finally I ask our waitress how much longer will it be before our food come out.

After reading previous reviews, I was truly looking forward to dining at Rosie's Cafe. 1 star rating is for the ambience of the establishment. My first visit! The restaurant was not busy- 3 parties of 2 to 4 customers-  therefore, I thought we would be seated immediately, place our orders- we had already checked out the menu before arriving- and then served our food. Unfortunately, things did not transpire as I hoped.\\nEnter the restaurant-  I liked the style and decor of this establishment. Three young ladies were  present. One was the hostess who was busy at the 'podium' with two customers and the other two- who I later found out were waitresses- were talking as they lounged against the wall. The hostess-- Thank You to this young lady-- took a moment to greet us and returned to assist her customers. We were seated and later served our beverages. 17 minutes passed. The waitress never came back. It appeared as though the young ladies spent a great deal of time conversing with each other  and  with customers/ friends who perhaps frequent the restaurant. \\nWe were all disappointed in the lack of customer service or customer care, therefore, we decided  to leave. A member of my party let  the hostess know we would be leaving and to inquire about our lack of customer service. Of course, we could have talked with a member of management but we chose not to.  As we were gathering our belongings, the waitress appeared and asked why we were leaving. She had the audacity to say, \\"I guess you'll just pay for the tea then??\\" The only party member who ordered the tea said, \\"Okay, just have the manager come over please.\\" The waitress removed the glasses and left the table. Hopefully, management will take a very good look at what's going on or what's not going on in the dining area.\\n1 star rating for the ambiance of this establishment.

The bacon pieces were kind of small but bacon makes everything better, right?! Pickles added a lot. 10/10. My only complaint is that the onion strings were kind of soggy which is mainly why I didn't give 5 stars.

I've had my eyes on the famed Townsman burger for a while and gave it a try. My first impressions were high quality, juicy meat patty, mix of sweet and savory toppings, and a decent bun. The meat was the highlight here, much like filet mignon ground up and placed in a sandwich - a very high mark. My only reservations are about the fries. The fries are unique as they are dusted in some sort of spice and sugar. Not a huge fan, and they didn't seem to complement the sweetness of the burger that well - not to mention they didn't have much of a crunch. This left me feeling that the burger as a complete meal was a mixed bag. This negative was greatly overcome by the appetizer platter, service, and overall experience."},{"name":"Am√©lie's French Bakery & Caf√©","address":"840 Marietta St NW","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Such a cute place!

And no one needs comfort food these days more than Your Ol' Pal Shooey. So, as I was hanging with my neighbors on the balcony of our complex--a popular activity, it seems in this neck of the woods--one of the girls opened her laptop, asked everyone what their favorite pizza toppings were, and before I could finish my Diet Bud, arrived with three hot Reale's pies. It couldn't have been more than 20 minutes, tops. There's a star for speed alone!\\n\\nSo let's get to the pies.  New Yorkers do get snobby about their pizza, and I can safely say--Reale's nailed it. This pie reminded me of the pizza I used to get in the little joint in Fishkill NY, and also close to a Ray's Famous in NYC. The crust was soft, so the tip droops--but not too much. Just the right amount of grease.  You want the tip to droop no more than 2 inches. As a testament to how good the crust is, I even ate the pizza rinds--\\"the bones\\"--as I've always called them. Some Yelpers who've witnessed my eating pizza can attest--I rarely eat the bones. They become premium dog treats. But this crust had a nice, yeasty flavor and feel to it. Bellissimo! The sauce was nice, too--not overly sweet, and a nice tangy nature to it. Toppings were ample. We had a pepperoni, and a three-meat kinda thingie. The seasoned beef on the meat pizza was exceptional. \\n\\nThis pie satisfied my New Yorker's palate, and the speed satisfied the laziness and impatience I usually experience in conjunction with pizza ordering."},{"name":"Top of the Hub","address":"800 Boylston St, Ste 52","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"Service is 5 stars.

Luckily we were able to get seated at the bar after only a 15 minute wait.  The menu has a wide variety of items to choose from and I can see coming back over several visits just to try them all.  On my maiden visit these are the things I tried:\\n\\nStravecchio Toast: (B+) A winning flavor combination with the arugula, avocado, smoked butternut squash and white anchovy; the best bites were those with the anchovy.\\n\\nCauliflower Gratin: (B+) Is cauliflower the new Brussels sprouts?  Quite possibly as I think both veggies have been underrated until chefs starting getting creative with them.  Add melted creamy gruyere and top it with fine bread crumbs and it is delicious.\\n\\nSticky Brussels Sprouts (A): The apple-bacon marmalade and pickled apple made for an excellent balance and these were not overly sweet as at other places.\\n\\nGrilled Broccolini (B-):  I've been a long-time fan of broccolini but the strong flavor of the romesco and the heat from the fresno overwhelmed the broccolini.\\n\\nPlancha Burger (A+): The secret is they add in bacon into the ground beef mix, prior to grilling.  All other ingredients were top notch, including the challah bun.  This one goes on my \\"Top 10 Burgers\\" list.  (Note: it is a modest-sized burger).\\n\\nGarganelli (A+): The lean sausage had dynamic flavor with fennel and Calabrian chilies, and with the pasta and truffle vinaigrette, topped with taleggio cheese, it just melted in my mouth.  I didn't say it was lean in calories.\\n\\nBirthday Cake Ice Cream Sandwich (A+): With so many tempting desserts on the menu I would not have ordered this pedestrian sounding one if I hadn't seen it at the table next to us.  Picture ice cream infused with funfetti, sandwiched in between two slices of firmed cookie dough.  The taste was heavenly.

WRONG. They were truly loaded, the box (see pic) was, in fact, loaded full of their delicious fries, Philly style steak pieces, sauteed red onions and a deliciously seasoned brown gravy. \\nThe stacker was another story, I'll start from the top down. The top had a large dollop of what appeared to be old style vanilla ice cream (know how it's more yellowish than whitish?), but I assume was actually supposed to be whipped cream. At any rate it was gross and after timidly tasting, I threw it out. Next was some really thick \\"caramel\\", again not sure what it was, but unlike any caramel I've had and some sort of \\"chocolate dipped graham cracker\\" bits (maybe?), which stuck to tops and sides of my teeth, akin to Butterfinger.

There were some really amazing menu items, a fantastic beer list, and superior service. That being said, there were a few misses which took some of the shine off our overall satisfaction. My husband and I came in for our wedding anniversary on the recommendation of several of our friends. We were greeted immediately and told that we might have to wait awhile for a table and asked if we would mind eating at the bar. Since it was a special occasion we opted to wait at the bar and move to a table once one became available. Right off the bat the bartender was there, very knowledgeable, and recommended some tasty beers. We ordered the Bretzel which came with the house mustard, a cheese dip, and schmaltz. The pretzel was anemic and looked like it was a mistake that should have been thrown out. It was nice and fluffy/fat at the bottom but the whole top part was thinner than the width of a pencil and hard. The dips were delicious with the buttery pretzel though, so we didn't complain. Once we were moved to a table we tried the potato cakes with house apple sauce and roasted beet salad. The beet salad was BOMB! The potato cakes were completely without flavor (the applesauce that was drizzled on the plate under the potato cakes was delicious but I don't like paying $6 for applesauce). We then tried the maultaschen pasta and it was really good but the white wine sauce dominated the plate and the delicate leek flavor was almost lost. The asparagus soup was literally to die for however and completely made up for any misses in the previous courses. For our main course my hubby had the jagerschnitzel and I got a knackwurst and was allowed to substitute the sauerkraut for the sp√§tzle. Both dishes were delicious and so were the leftovers the next day. Really on point. The biggest disappointment was dessert. I had saved just enough room for what should be the crown jewel for any German restaurant - the apple strudel! It was not good. The pastry should be flaky, but this was dense and tough - like the phyllo was compressed into one thick piece of leathery pastry. The apple filling was over baked and mushy. Very disappointing. Still, knowing what to avoid, and what to order on our return trip will be helpful and lead to a better experience. What we had that we liked...we REALLY liked a lot so it's worth another try. It's worth saying that we spent almost 3 hours enjoying a leisurely dinner and never felt rushed, had some of the best service we could remember, and were pleasantly surprised that we spent as little as we did compared to the feast we enjoyed.

We were seated about 45 minutes to an hour after we arrived. Brandon was our server. He immediately brought a basket of warm, fresh, rolls and breads to our table. It took an act of God not to get stuffed off the bread basket! The menu had so many good looking choices to choice from so we made Brandon the bad guy lol and ask him to tell us what to order, after we shared our likes. For appetizer we enjoyed fried green tomatoes. The ranch style dip was the perfect compliment, and we asked for more! For dinner I had fried chicken, mac n cheese and cornbread dressing. Chicken was well seasoned, juicy and huge portion. Mac and cheese was good (I like mine more cheesy but it was good), and the dressing reminded of my grandmother making my a tiny dish of dressing to try as a child, before Thanksgiving dinner. The sweet tea is real deal, down south sweet tea y'all! For dessert we ordered pecan pie, peach cobbler and banana pudding. My husband enjoyed the pecan pie (it's his favorite so he's picky), we shared the peach cobbler which was amazing. The banana pudding was good, but lacked nilla wafers. I may have had 1.5 cookies in a sizable portion of pudding.

It occupies a location that's kind of cursed - lots of restaurants have failed in the same space. I suppose the landlord is charging WAY too much rent. As much as I'd like this place to succeed, it needs some improvement if it wants to stay in business.\\n\\nFirst the good. Frank gets very high marks in:\\n\\n - Interior design & buildout, ambience. Someone spent a load of cash on a very nice interior. It's rustic but hip, with a bar made of a solid single slab of oak(?), lots of worn brick, some sign painting on the walls that are distressed to look like they've been there since 1908. The general store is a really cool concept and they stock products made by local folks.\\n\\n- Service. On both visits, service has been attentive, with our wait person knowledgeable about the menu. The food comes out quick (yeah it's hotdogs, so it should be fast).\\n\\n- Both times I've visited it was cold and nasty outside, so I appreciated the coffee selection. They have several high-end brews. I went for the Oaxacan and it was pleasing.\\n\\nNow for the problems:\\n\\n- When I leave, I am absolutely starving. Seriously, I had to go fix myself a sandwich. When you order a hot dog or sausage dog, that's all you're a-gettin'. I guess they are sized about what you'd expect, but one of 'em isn't gonna do it. Why not get two? That leads me to my next point ...\\n\\n- It's expensive. The Yelp rating is misleading - yeah, you could get out for one dollar sign, but you will need to eat a bag of chips or steak within the hour. I'd call this a 2-dollar-sign joint for sure, because if you want to even approach filling up, you will need to drop $13 at the least. The cheapest sandwich on the menu is $5 and you can spend up to $9, but a $9 dog really isn't any more food than a $5 one. On my first visit I went whole-hog and ponied up for the Redd Foxx for 9 bucks. I thought was pricey, but it comes with lots of stuff on it (pulled bbq, slaw, etc). Plus it's called \\"Redd Foxx\\" what am I going to do, I had to get it because Redd is my man from back in the day. I was sorely disappointed. They should change the name of this sandwich to the \\"Lamont\\" because it doesn't live up to the name.\\n\\n- The food is not real good. It's okay. If I were paying $3 per dog I might want to come back, but at double or triple that, there's no freaking way. The Beer Brat was passable, perfectly decent, the bread was a tad stale tho. The fries are really stale - I don't know if they were sitting around for a long time before they were served, but they were pretty nasty and stiff. I got the \\"Texas BBQ sauce\\" to dip them in. I put that in quotes because that sauce tasted like no BBQ sauce I've ever had anywhere, much less Texas. And that's not a good thing. I abandoned the sauce and went with the ketchup. While we're on the subject of sauce, my Redd Foxx claimed to have NC BBQ sauce. But this sauce tasted like horseradish. If you've ever had NC BBQ, you know they don't use much sauce in the first place, and it's vinegar-based and very subtle. This wasn't NC BBQ sauce, and it wasn't particularly good sauce period.\\n\\nAnyhoo, that's my take on Frank. I was shocked to see this place with a 4-star rating, so I had to chime in. Four stars means I should be excited about returning there. Far from that, I not sure I'll be back."},{"name":"Pastelaria S√£o Paulo","address":"2512 Rio Grande St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"Came here last Saturday for lunch to try the past√©is.

To start, we ordered the deviled eggs, but our waiter accidentally brought us hush puppies. It was a serendipitous mistake because the hush puppies were actually delicious! It was my first time having hush puppies and if all hush puppies taste like this, then it won't be the last. It was perfectly fried with the crispiest outside and the cheese that came with it was so good. \\n\\nFor our mains, we ordered the smoked brisket reubenot and the trout. Our waiter told us that the food at the restaurant tended to be smokier and really heavy just because of the unique way that the items are cooked in the hearth and he was spot on. \\n\\nWhile the sandwich was delicious, I could not eat more than half of my reubenot. It was piled high with smoked brisket and absolutely covered in gruyere cheese. It was so heavy. Kind of strange, but I almost wish they put pineapples in the sandwich to lighten it up and have the sweetness balance the saltiness because I did find the sandwich a tad salty. I ended up tossing the bread and trying to just finish the brisket, but was too full. \\n\\nMy friend got the trout and it came with potatoes, bacon and a whole trout (minus the head, deboned)! It was really good, but really heavy as well because of the bacon fat. \\n\\nWhile the food here was really good, I would only recommend this place if you were able to take leftovers with you. We couldn't because we were going to the Atlanta History Center afterwards. I feel like I could've handled my sandwich in two sittings, but it was just a lot to eat at once.\\n\\nOur server was great though. He was really friendly, asked us about our plans for the day, was on top of cleaning up the table, and refilled our water every time it was low.\\n\\nThis restaurant is located in a more ritzy part of town and is right next to the St. Regis Hotel.

It was crowded on the Thursday night that I went with my boyfriend but the wait was no more than 15 minutes. It was really convenient that they sent texts to notify us that the table was ready. \\n\\nThe food is very reasonably priced -- under $12 for a bowl of ramen and $15-16 for a combo that includes your choice of ramen with a soft boiled egg and an option for a side. My boyfriend and I both got the cha su rice bowl combo and we tried the shoyu and miso ramen, respectively. The portions may not seem like much at first because the combo comes with a small ramen unless you upgrade, but don't underestimate it because I was stuffed at the end of the meal. The noodles were generous and springy, though it was on the saltier side. I'm not sure if that's how traditional ramen is though because most ramen places that I've been to have been a bit salty too. The pork with the rice was tender and was  tasty overall. The egg was also cooked nicely -- I recommend putting it in your ramen so that the soup warms it up! \\n\\nAll in all, a great experience and I'd definitely recommend this to anyone in the Harvard Square area!"},{"name":"Mexas Tacos","address":"8788 Vineland Ave","city":"Orlando","stars":"4.5","text":"Wow!

The smores tart with salted caramel goodness doesn't taste like smores but still an amazing dessert.\\n\\nKing+Duke was an amazing experience! It can be hard to get reservations, but we got lucky with ONE table left in the 15 minutes after we checked reservations. So we booked it and ran. We got there a little late, but it was okay. It was raining outside so we sat at a table inside, but it looked like outside seating would have created a nice ambience. The inside ambience was still great though. Our server was pretty good. Everyone there was really nice. \\n\\nOur meal started off with amazing bread. It was flaky and buttery and an amazing adventure. I got to ride that ride twice :P. I got a non-alcoholic drink called \\"Truer than True\\" which was amazing! It was like an italian soda with fresh strawberry and rhubarb. It was sweet and fresh. Justin got a drink called \\"The High Horse\\" or something which was kind of like a bourbon/moscow mule. It was strong, but still great. \\n\\nFor appetizers, after contemplating and wanting basically everything we decided on the buttermilk salad and the beef tartare. Both were amazing! The buttermilk salad doesn't look like anything special from the menu, but it had a subtle buttermilk dressing and the spices that were put on the avocado were great. The avocados were fresh and it was great to see something so simple done so amazingly. \\n\\nWe proceeded onto our dinner which we split the prime rib with potatoes and a crab leg. It came with two really bold sauces and the sauces were a ride in itself. The spices with the prime rib mixed with their spice-butter was amazing. The potatoes that came with it were really hearty and it had a good horseradish sauce.\\n\\nEven though we were pretty full, we still couldn't resist a dessert. We ended up choosing the smores tart out of all the great choices. This dessert was savor-every-moment amazing. It didn't taste anything like smores to me, but the salted caramel with the chocolate tart and subtle-marshmallow-ice cream tasted really great.

Id say I did well for my first visit there.\\n\\nWe went there for a friend's birthday with an expected party of 18. This was on a Saturday night so the place was completely packed to full capacity with people waiting. She had made a reservation yet the table was not ready. We wait another 30 mins, still waiting and now they ask where the missing 3 people are. they were on their way. Not good enough for the fufu hostess. So we say 15 people is fine and we'll make arrangements for the late party. The 4 bathrooms here are unisex and single serving, which caused lines and confusion. We see that a handful of our party members have moved to the bar where they begin  their purchase of highly overpriced $12 glasses of wine, unaware of their impending bill. We're seated 15 mins later and our birthday girl is less than happy. The seating arrangement was fine for our party, a long stretch down a half booth half chair seating. \\n\\nWe began by getting our wine swiftly out and enjoying it. 1.5 Liters of our wine for the same price as a single glass of theirs? We've won that battle, now to begin the feast. We started with Salmon Chips and Calamari. Salmon chips came in a nice wooden boat tray and held 4 of them. A Little spicy and not bad for an appetizer. The calamari was pretty good with both sweet icing on the top and sour mix at the bottom. The serving size was very small and only enough for one person. My experience with the squid app is that everyone can snack on them until dinner is ready, with plates large enough to feed everyone. Here you get an appetizer suited for only a single person. \\n\\nThe menu arrives and we all try something different. I like the name so i order the Big Ass Burger, my friend the chicken, and my roommate the Ribs. Starting with mine I was very disappointed. For a Big ASS burger i was expecting way more meat on this thing, something similar to good ol cheeseburger Cheeseburgers famous 1 lb burger. This was maybe a quarter pound unless you count the almost loaf size bun it came on. The mat was also pretty bland and without condiments I couldn't finish this thing. Only three onion rings came with this but at least they were stacked to look nice. The chicken was chicken, can't say much about it other than it \\"tastes like chicken\\". Ribs were small and pretty average tasting despite its $24 price. For that price you might as well get a whole rack somewhere else. We didn't get any shots or pay for drinks so bringing our own was a really good idea, it was actually pretty scary seeing the expressions on the other guests who didn't realize until it was too \\nlate that they had spent over $100 on wine and weren't even tipsy yet.\\n\\nIn closing my party managed to hit the total of just under $100 but its mostly because we brought our own alcohol. The decor is breathtaking with giant red lamps and a kitchen grill in the center of the place encased by a large glass. Its hustle and bustle and while the waiters are wearing what seems like sports bar \\"Two\\" shirts, they manners and politeness was very cool.

Not exactly the best view or spacious accommodations. \\n\\nFood: For appetizer we had the fried coconut shrimp with a spicy pineapple sauce. There were 4 fairly large shrimps, accompanied by a teaspoon of sauce. The shrimp and sauce were delicious! The coating was crunchy and not greasy. Our biggest complaint was the pathetic amount of sauce. \\n\\nAs our main entrees we ordered the fried chicken with lobster mac and cheese, and the seafood melange. The portion sizes were monstrous! I had ordered the melange, and once again I liked my bf's dish more. The entire dish was too acidic. Also, the dish should of been named Artichoke Melange, because there was barely any seafood in comparison to artichoke. I had approximately 3 shrimps, 1 over cooked scallop, and 3 pieces of octopus. It was nice for about 5 bites, and then I got tired of it. My bf had the fried chicken with mac and cheese, and man was it delicious. The fried chicken was so crispy! The lobster mac and cheese was a little greasy, but the flavor was awesome. If I was to come back, it would be for the fried chicken with mac and cheese. Then there was dessert time, and they had no dessert! Our reservation was for 8pm, and somehow the only thing available were sliced apples covered in chocolate.

We had already paid for the bill and 30 mins later, Kate brings a second check with a charge of 54 cents. She should have informed us that Mayo was extra. Then they demanded cash because the amount is too small to charge on a card. Overall, the atmosphere did not feel welcoming although every worker would scream welcome every couple of minutes.

The Lobster Mac and cheese was good. However the Lobster fried rice just was not what it was cooked up to be. It is overpriced with very little wow effect. Most people say it's good because of the ambiance of the 1 piece of Lobster. The fried rice itself is bland. And I know I'm not the only one that says so because I'm just now noticing the other reviews that say the same. \\n\\nNow, that's not even what I was disappointed about. People have different taste buds all the time and no one can help nor control that. The disappointment comes from the lack of customer satisfaction from the MANAGER of the place. Medium height guy, darker tone, glasses. Listen. I'm a foodie, I eat all over Atlanta almost every weekend, and I'm not kidding when I tell you that in all my years I have NEVER eaten at a place that did not either exchange, discount, or let you return a food item if you were not pleased with it. Poor Calvin's is the first place I've ever been to that has refused to do anything about the fact that my date and I were not satisfied. We asked if anything at all could be done, and he just kept looking at us coyly saying \\"This is just what it is.\\" When I tell you my jaw dropped. I was even embarrassed for him. \\n\\nSo Warning: If you don't like what you get that's just too bad and they'll tell you to just suck it up.

A really fun concept and I really appreciated being able to make a reservation.  \\n\\nHere is the rub and I honestly think it soured me for the night...I called and asked if I could bring wine to the restaurant.  Their wine menu though thoughtful was small.  And generally if you are only serving beer/wine on a menu I have found other restaurants accept wine brought in to a restaurant for a corkage.  I don't want to hear about TABC laws.  I understand them.  I also come from an area where it is perfectly acceptable to bring wine to a restaurant, no need to call ahead.\\n\\nAnyways, I was told an emphatic NO, you cannot bring wine here, we have many lovely wines/beer available for purchase.  Ok, that was completely acceptable in my book.  It's a crap shoot anyways.  \\n\\nWe arrive on time and are sat at a communal table where the group of four next to us have THREE stellar bottles of wine opened on the table (brought in from the outside, not on the menu wines) and more under the table that they keep showing off.

I absolutely love prosciutto on pizza and I know this is a more expensive meat to usually include in meals so I was pleasantly surprised by the amount they topped the pizza with. The arugula was also fresh, and the crust was delicious - the bottom and edges of the crust has a nice crunch and fried texture and the rest of the crust was chewy in a wonderful way. \\n\\nPRICE: My pizza though was $15 which is honestly a little steep for me considering the size of the pizza that was given.

Now let me say... all our appetizers were delicious.  We ordered our \\n    meals the same time we ordered our appetizers... this was at 1:12pm...

I loved how buttery yet flakey the crust was so definitely would've eaten more if I could have. Only knocking it down to 4 stars because 1) debit purchases need a minimum of $5 and I only had my debit card on me so luckily my friend was willing to cover and 2) the pizzas on display are just kept on the counter behind a sneeze guard and then reheated through a small oven which doesn't exactly scream food safe to me since most places will have displays under a heat lamp. \\n\\nOtherwise the price is super reasonable for the quality you get and I would definitely come back here again."},{"name":"Holy Taco","address":"345 1st St","city":"Lake Oswego","stars":"3.5","text":"Holy Taco, Batman!

Our server, Nicole, was super nice and flexible about letting us switching tables (the ones against the windows on your right hand side when you enter are blasted with A/C and we were not the only ones who noticed!). \\n\\nWe ordered the Brussels, fries, and the crispy shrimp. I loved the shrimp--the sauces were great and they were definitely crispy! We did notice the popularity of the Brussels on yelp, but I thought the taste was a little too sweet and thick. The dish, overall, was just too \\"sauce-y\\" up to the point where it was overwhelming. And the fries were normal so if you are craving some potatoes, you can't go wrong with the fries!\\n\\nThe best part of the meal, however, was their delicious sweet corn cake topped with a blueberry lavender ice cream!

If you only stop by Launderette to order their desserts, it would still be worth it. \\n\\nOverall, I personally think their desserts are better than their main dishes.

We booked a table on New Year's Eve, they put us in a private room, which we did not request. That's nice of them in the first place. However, when we request to change the room temperature of the room. The manager said to us wth an attitude \\"well, this room doesn't belong to you in the first place.\\" I guess we didn't order enough to make the manager happy. \\n2) when we asked about a wine list, the manager only verbally gave us choice between \\"beer or red wine\\". This makes us think that this place probably has no liquor license. \\n3) the wine glass that they gave me has moldy taste. I suspect they use some really dirty moldy towel to wipe dry the glass. \\n4) when they serve us the wine (it's a French red wine) and they uncork it in front of us.

I was here on the day of my birthday and the bartender had fun with that. We each had a beer and a meal. I opted for the Lobster Roll since I knew i had to have at least one this trip. I do wish I had some oysters, but there is always next time. My BF will not eat seafood, so he got a burger, he didn't really like it, but I am not going to go to much into that because hes picky and this is a seafood place.\\n\\nThe meal started out with some cornbread, which was warm and amazing. I usually don't like corn bread but this was fabulous. Then came our meals. His burger looked boring - and it was. However, my lobster roll was packed up with lobster. It was a mix of tail, claw and knuckle. I opted for the hot buttered roll, and asked for extra butter. It was so good! The fries served with it were pretty good, not super crispy, but well seasoned. I was very surprised by the pickles. They were so good! They must have been quick pickled in house, they were super fresh and crisp. yum! The coleslaw was very good too. I cleaned my plate.\\n\\nThe bartender also let me sample the clam chowder, it was good - nothing spectacular.\\n\\nThe lobster roll was around $27, which is similar to all other restaurants prices, and this did not dissapoint on value. I would come back here for the ambiance, food and value."},{"name":"Top of the Hub","address":"800 Boylston St, Ste 52","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"I came to Top of the Hub with my boyfriend excited for the view and fine dining food. We came during Dine Out Boston/Restaurant week and ordered from that menu. Unfortunately, we did not get a window seat, however the view was still very nice! Ambiance during lunch is very casual and the wait staff are very friendly. \\n\\nIt took quite a substantial amount of time for bread and butter to arrive. A waiter was walking around with a huge platter of two kinds of bread (sourdough bread and cranberry walnut bread). The sourdough bread was a bit hard and did not taste like fresh baked bread. However, the cranberry walnut bread was very good.\\n\\nMy boyfriend and I both started with the chilled coconut and pineapple soup with basil oil and tapioca pearls. We were both very confused. From the aesthetic point of view, it doesn't look very pleasing. The muted colors and the splash of green looked very odd. You can definitely taste the coconut and the basil but the pineapple flavor was lack luster. Unfortunately, this dish turned our stomachs a bit and the taste was something we just couldn't comprehend. Overall, not something we would ever have again.\\n\\nFor the entree, my boyfriend and I both got the Cowboy Rubbed Pork Tenderloin. This entree has a potato cauliflower mash with corn, bourbon brown sugar Demi-glac√©, and a crispy Okinawan sweet potato nest. The pork is definitely the star of the show as it was very tender and the seasoning was on point especially with the Demi-glac√©. Perfectly cooked. The mash mixture was good but quiet bland. Definitely needed some salt and pepper added. Finally the sweet potato nest really had no flavor, but it added a great textural element to the dish. This was definitely the star of the lunch.\\n\\nFor the dessert, I ordered the no bake strawberry cheesecake and my boyfriend ordered the creme br√ªl√©e. The strawberry cheesecake was nothing special. The cake portion had a lot of strawberry flavor, but it wasn't anything that blew me out of the water. My boyfriends creme br√ªl√©e was incredibly disappointing. It tasted as if the dish was sitting in the fridge for quite some time, as the custard was incredibly thick. Perhaps that's the top of the hubs style of creme br√ªl√©e, but even the caramelized sugar on top was disap. There was no crack when using your spoon for the first bite and it was as if the sugar was pre blow torched. The vanilla flavor from the creme br√ªl√©e also wasn't very prevalent.\\n\\nOverall, Top of the Hub is great for the scenery, but if you are a foodie like my boyfriend and I, perhaps this restaurant isn't for you!"},{"name":"Voodoo Doughnut - Old Town","address":"22 SW 3rd Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"One of the worst pastries I've ever tried... too sweet, not fresh and 10,000+ calories.\\nU get what you pay for it's cheap and shitty..."},{"name":"Launderette","address":"2115 Holly St","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Came back here for my birthday on a regular monday.  As always, it's a great place to get one of the best meals in Austin.  Mondays 50% bottles of wine so that's always a plus.\\n\\nAll food was fantastic.  Bread really is a specialty here whether as appetizer, on burger, or pastry.  Burrata came with a charred bread that worker perfect for dipping, making a toast like dish with soft cheese to smooth it over.  Pretty dish and worked on sweet level to the max.  Sweet potato were interesting and had a bit of a sesame and burnt taste to it.  Very southern and Asian influenced but good-looking and great opener to share.  Skipped the brussel sprouts (seems like every other tables go-to) to save room for dessert (the best in the city - birthday cake ice cream sandwich!).  Had the cavatelli and burger for entrees.  Cavatelli had a very harissa-based sauce s you must like that flavor and spice to order this.  Pasta fresh regardless, but for this dish it is heavy on the spices.  Burger lived up to reputation.  Very gooey and cheesy and great bun and meat.  Little bare with no bacon or egg available, but pickle crunch mixed with softness of cheese and perfectly cooked and seeping wetness of the patty made each bite great.  No sides with this dish so order the appetizer as well.  \\n\\nGreat wines available for normal pricing.  Beer list small but cocktail game looked fun with mixture of house and normals.  Being my birthday I was hoping for something on the way out but note that they do not give you anything in relation to a celebration.  ALl in after discount on wine was $125 for a great 3 course meal.  Honestly everything was priced fine, but pet peeve there's no prices on dessert menu so be careful ($6 for ice cream sandwich).  Given that this deserves to be a celebration type of meal, nothing against that, but was still fingers crossed when I arrived.  Launderette really should be on any Top 5 list of Austin dining and the menu is so open that each meal (brunch, lunch, dinner) and each type you come back there will be something great to try and experiment."},{"name":"Mary Mac's Tea Room","address":"224 Ponce De Leon Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Umm...this place is ok.

No response from Sean, the manager whom I emailed almost a week ago. That speaks volumes to me. Clearly, this place does not care about your dining experience so here goes my review. \\n\\nI had dinner last night, July 11th,  at the River Bar with three of my friends and here's a quick summation of our experience:\\n\\n1)   When my friend asked the server if they had lemon drop martinis, she said \\"no.\\" That would have been an opportunity to try and suggest something similar. Nope. However, my friend did ask \\"can you make a martini with lemon juice?\\" \\"Oh yes, we can do that.\\" Solution.  Second friend wanted a \\"Bacardi and diet coke\\". \\"Oh, we don't have Bacardi. \\"  Silence....\\"what kind of rum DO you have?\\"\\n\\n2) Entree time.  My friend got the wings. She said they were so sweet, she'd prefer to have eaten them as dessert. My other friends and i got the burger....without the bacon rolls. I asked to substitute the slaw salad for polenta. (Note, no expect to get any \\"normal\\" ketchup and no fries ). Asked for our burgers to be medium. They came and were well done. Not only that, the presentation was a joke. I won't post the picture but there was no garnish. Just a hockey puck of a burger that tasted like charcoal on a small roll.  The manager came over and asked if everything was ok.  She explained to us the reason the burgers were dark brown/gray burnt to a crisp was because of the sauce they use....(my friend is actually a chef....just saying). She asked if we wanted anything else. Seeing as we were half way through eating , and didn't want to wait another 30 minutes for our meals, we declined....she just walked away.  Something should have been done on her end, if she really cared about four guests enjoying their first time experience.\\n\\n3) Using the restroom- it was beyond disgusting. There was fecal mater on the toilet seat, toilet paper on the floor, a beetle in the sink....They did, however, take care of it right away when I made them aware of its appearance.  However, for a restaurant that charges $15 for a hamburger, I would expect the bathrooms to be clean.\\n\\n4) The last 40 mins, after we finished our meal, our server asked us 4 times \\"How are you guys doing?\\" - no one was waiting for our table and my friend just ordered another drink. The rest of us were full.  While I appreciate being asked once or twice, it was annoying and we felt rushed.\\n\\n5) We get our bill and the server is no where to be found for a good 10-12 minutes. Also, she charged me $2.00 for the sub polenta for the slaw. Normally, I would not care had she TOLD me this when I modified my order.  I don't think it's ok to add a charge on anyone's bill without asking them first.  She was gone so my friend had to get up, go to the manager again and say \\"will you please put 40.00 on this card, the rest is the bill and tip. We are paying the full bill and giving a decent tip but are growing inpatient as we have been waiting to pay our server who's yet to return.\\"\\n\\nThe prominent issue was the lack of knowledge, or lack of hospitality training of the server.  With the drinks and food questions,  she seemed either confused, inflexible, or unable to come up with a solution or suggestion- this is a management training issue.  Her lack of service skills just lost that restaurant four potential loyal customers, to add insult to injury , the manager of the restaurant had several opportunities to make up for it and did not do so -so clearly it is a management/training issue too."},{"name":"Mexas Tacos","address":"8788 Vineland Ave","city":"Orlando","stars":"4.5","text":"I was recommended to this place by a friend who was down on vacation and I told him I would be in Orlando in a few weeks.

I remembered very little about the food but did remember that I liked the interior decor so when my cousin decided to have her Birthday dinner there I figured this would be a great way to get reintroduced to this hot-spot.  Again, upon entering I thought the ambiance was nice.  It was dimly lit and lots of people sitting in the bar area.  Our party gathered in that area because we had to wait for the entire party to be filled before we could be seated.  So we ordered drinks from the bar, as we waited.  I ordered the Free Falling craft cocktail.  It is combination of citrus infused Vodka, Lemon, Lime, and Soda.  I typically drink sweeter drinks but was delighted that this drink was quite refreshing. \\n\\nUnfortunately, the delight began and ended with that cocktail because the food left little to be desired.  I ordered the Brussels Sprouts and Crab Cakes and am sad to say that I wasn't pleased with either.  The Brussels were under cooked and bland.  Roasted Brussels with an Aoli sauce or sprinkled with Gorgonzola Crumbles would really take this dish to the next level.  As for the Crab Cakes...THEY WERE UNDERCOOKED.  The outside of the Crab Cakes were pan seared but the inside was runny.  You cannot cook a crab cake fast and expect it to be done all the way through.  In addition to them being runny, they lacked the lumps of meat that make crab cakes so dreamy.  I'd even venture to suggest an Aoli Sauce or a homemade Cocktail sauce.  Either of them would help bring this dish more flavor since it lacked in that area, as well. \\n\\nNeedless to say, I was extremely disappointed.  We paid way too much money for this dining experience and for it to be lackluster is an extreme let down.  I get why people come here...It's in a great location with a great ambiance but that is where the good time stops for me."},{"name":"Katana Teppanyaki & Sushi","address":"3345 Lenox Rd NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"I enjoy eating in this place , it's my fourth time and not last , love the yellow tail shoots , amazing food ."},{"name":"Pinthouse Pizza","address":"4236 S Lamar Blvd","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"Pizza was soooo good!

I was so giddy to finally secure a reservation after 2 failed attempts. The restaurant has a miniature golf course and comfortable lounge area outdoor. The mixture of the miniature palm tree, blue details, and linens gave the Optimist a  pseudo-rustic-seaside appeal. It provides a nice dichotomy from the city-feel of the surrounding area. The place feels especially lively because you're dining in a wide open space. I appreciate the multiple private bathroom stalls. \\n\\nLet it be known, I came here with 3 other individuals on the day Paul Ryan was in A-town and traffic was more nightmar-ish than uszh. Dang politics! I recommend saving yourself the trouble of trying to find parking in the neighborhood and getting complementary valet. This place is too popping to try to find street parking. Despite being late, we were promptly seated shortly afterwards, albeit an uncomfortably large booth meant to seat twice the amount of people in our group. I have to say, despite it being a very busy Wednesday evening, the employees were on top of things and very conscientious. They checked up on us and apologized for the delay on our orders. \\n\\nWe were given four wheat rolls. They were slightly hard and dry. Christine K.jokingly commented on it being an omen, but I was being an Optimist (har har har). \\n\\nWe had the following dishes between the 4 of us: \\nAppetizers: \\n1. East Coast Oysters\\n2. West Coast Oysters\\n3.  Fried Oysters --- slightly too heavy on the batter. I couldn't enjoy the oysters. I prefer the fried oysters from Serpas. \\n4. Spicy Glazed Octopus --- was a recommendation. It sounded appealing...crispy on the outside and tender on the inside. It did not taste crispy but too charred. Burnt. taste. in my. mouth. The inside was soft though! Which is nice, bc octopus is usually more chewy. \\n\\nMain Course: The various fish selection was pretty cool. I don't often see restaurants serve larger fishes. They had fishes I have never heard of also. The portions were smaller than anticipated. This isn't a complaint, just an observation. Ok, it's kind of a complaint, but whatevs.     \\n1. Monkfish --- The fish was covered in a sea of chunky tomato sauce. \\n2. Seared Tuna --- Good dish. It was also served with octopus and mustard seeds \\n3. Tautog --- Supposedly has the consistency and taste of lobster. It's supposedly going to be out of season and off the menu soon. It was a very simple and clean dish. In diplomatic terms, it was very 'neutral.\\" \\n 4. Whole \\"swimming\\" Bass --- I shied away from ordering this dish myself because it sounded too similar to an Asian dish. Lo and behold, it tasted very much like a Vietnamese dish...fried fish w fish sauce...\\n\\n...and for side dishes, we helped ourselves to beignet style Hush Puppies and potatoes. Though we were told it's family style, the portions are more fair for 2 people. The hush puppies were very good. They had bits of corn in them and were served w powdered sugar, hence the \\"beignet\\" style. The potatoes were served wedged with creamy sauce. \\n \\nNeedless to say, most of us were disappointed in our dishes, which we had to wait quite some time for. Ingredients were either excessive or lacking. I'm going to attribute it to being a busy night. We were good sports about it, but our sweet server and manager must have gotten a clue. The manager offered a complementary dish for us, but Isaac S. insisted it wasn't a bother. Nonetheless, we were offered complementary desserts, to which I ( and Christine K.) happily obliged! \\n\\nDesserts (ding ding ding! WINNER): \\n1. Apple Strudel  ---- kinda, sorta made up for some of the bland entrees. This is a very good dish. You can taste the cheese. It's served warm with a scoop of ice cream. \\n2. Pudding w Bananas Foster and Coconut Tuile---Also very good. Pudding comes w a round waffer.  \\n\\nThe highlight of the evening for our group was the complementary desserts. I really do appreciate the workers for their efforts in trying to make our dining experience better. At least the evening ended well."},{"name":"Top of the Hub","address":"800 Boylston St, Ste 52","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"This restaurant is notorious for being upscale and very much a special occasion oriented place. My sister and I were joking that it was a rite of passage for anyone to go there from the Boston area. Most men take girls they  are trying to impress on dates here. Since my sister and I had never been, we decided tonight was the night! There was so much anticipation built and the hype was at an all-time high. We had dressed up, made a reservation for 7 PM on a Friday night. We were staying around the corner at the Westin Copley so we were close by. I definitely recommend setting a reservation, especially if you're looking to dine on a weekend. It was difficult for me to call in to make a reservation, so I made my reservation easily on OpenTable. I also called right before we got there to confirm. We were sat at an amazing table that lines the wall. The idea is that you have a remarkable view of the entire city. I would ask to be sat alongside the window. We were greeted by our incredible server, Leo. Right away he carried good vibes and we knew we would be taken care of throughout the night. We joked around with him and got his backstory and told him ours. \\nWe were definitely in martini mode, so I got my classic dry, Ketel martini with olives and my sister got a specialty martini called the BlackBerry crush. It was delicious. For those of you who want to try something different and don't prefer sweet drinks - this will be great for you. We noticed that there was a fixed menu that they were offering for a total of $75. It included for appetizers, the fillet, and dessert. If you wanted to increase that amount to $115 - it included wine pairings. Since we had already ordered our cocktails-we decided to split the fixed menu. We were hungry but not starving. They also serve you complimentary bread. Leo allowed us to split the fixed menu which was nice because not all restaurants would allow that. It was a perfect amount of food. We wanted to experience variety and that is exactly what we got. The only thing that really stuck out to us was the pumpkin gnocchi on the menu and that was included in the fixed menu as well. We got to share a delicious crabcake, a light and fresh salad, the pumpkin gnocchi, for appetizers also the the filet was delicious and cooked perfectly and the cr√®me br√ªl√©e wasn't an amazing finish to an already amazing dining experience. The only problem we encountered is that, upon ordering the fixed menu-we had told Leo to give a little bit of space in between each dish so we could talk about it and enjoy it. There's nothing worse than when a restaurant serves you everything at once and you feel like it's a race. I think that was taken a little bit too seriously since there was a huge wait in between or appetizers and our meal. My sister and I had plans to go out after and we actually never ended up going out since there was about an hour to an hour and 15 minute wait to get our food. By the time we were done with our filet and dessert we were definitely ready for bed! We had asked Leo to bring out the desert and the bill right away after we finished our fil so there was no more waiting! Leo did just that and we were out soon. We figured we would be spending a lot more, but all together with tip, tax, our appetizers, meals, and cocktails, and dessert we paid $180. Really not too bad. Under $100 a person for such an incredible dining experience. If your server will let you, and you're not starving - I do recommend a fixed menu if they have that available available when you go. Overall I highly recommend this for the experience itself, the atmosphere is great and the food is good.\\n\\nI recently went back here with my fianc√© and his parents. We were only in Boston for one night and we wanted to show them the best time. We made reservations for 6:30 PM. We were able to walk right in and got a beautiful table right by the window. We were greeted by our server right away and immediately indulged in the wonderful bread and butter, appetizers, and cocktails. We were held over from all of that so we decided to each share a meal. Everything was delicious and came out in a timely manner. We had our server take a few photos of us. I would definitely recommend making reservations around 6:30 PM, that way you can experience it during daylight, sunset, and night.

They wanted something healthy and I explained to them that most of the food venues in the park will all have healthy options... salads, carrot sticks instead of french fries... etc.  \\n\\nWhen we got there, it was packed!

We waited about 5 min on line to order our food so that was not the challenge but once we got our food, finding a table was a nightmare.  People either find a table first and then 'save' it for their family so they are really taking a table for twice as long as they need it for...  and the tour groups were taking up about 50% of the tables but were no longer eating.  They were eating in waves and the first group was done eating but would not leave the tables until everybody in their group was done!  What a mess...

Start with the thick bread (gratis) dipped in oil as you check out the decor, which is a bit of Tuscany and exposed brick, thrown in with lighting that makes it a bit difficult to see the menu but, once your food arrives, all the guesswork will be gone as you enjoy the cheesiness, great tomato flavor, and fresh-tasting pastas.

We ordered four different items off the menu -- the omelette of the day, the spicy kale benedict, the pork schnitzel and gravy, and the smoked bluefish hash. The waitstaff was inattentive, and the drinks came slowly, but the true offender was the food itself.\\n\\nThe kale benedict was stuffed with tasteless, tough kale, and there was none of the promised spice. Proportionately, there was more kale than anything else on the plate, and my mother-in-law ended up scraping most of it off, leaving poached eggs over an English muffin. I dare say it did not a palatable breakfast make. The omelette of the day  was just plain old bland -- it had barely any of its promised ingredients (chorizo, heirloom tomatoes, cheese), and the two large slices of plain white toast that came with the omelette took up more plate space than the omelette itself. The pork schnitzel was tough, and the English muffin that came with it was dry and flavorless. That, combined with the overly rich gravy and gelatinous fried eggs, made for a plate that was simultaneously horrible to eat but far too filling. But the worst of all was the smoked bluefish hash. It was two poached eggs and a handful of cabbage over a pile of fishy potatoes that smelled and tasted like they'd sat in scummy pond water for a week. I could easily recreate the flavor experience by drowning myself in the Mystic River just across the road.\\n\\nI certainly wouldn't elect to come here again, but I'm sure this restaurant's attempts at palatable brunch food are appealing to someone."},{"name":"XLB","address":"4090 N Williams Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"Third time's not the charm.

Nothing fake or processed involved in these dishes! \\n\\nAlthough the meals may be 5 Star, the service at Crispy Crepes is no frills. Customers order at the counter and pay prior to eating their food. In my perspective, this is advantageous for the customer because no one pressures you to leave the cafe.

Food was good as usual but when I went to open my bottled water it was already previously opened as the top did not click. Upon trying the water I could immediately tell something was off by the taste as I drink Nestle Pure Life regularly at my own home however what was in the bottle was clearly tap water. The water even gave off that nasty Florida water smell and I let the person I was confirm the smell and taste it just to make sure I wasn't crazy. Upon checkout I told her if she could replace the water, she told me that that was the only water they had available but I insisted on another bottle and long behold the water was actually sealed, tasted great and didn't smell. A 28pk of Nestle costs $4.39 at target which puts the cost at under .12¬¢ per unit. In an attempt to save a minuscule amount of money on a product that already has a huge profit margin such as water is unheard of and the fact that someone more than likely already drank the water had it refilled, reused and given to a paying customer is ignominious and unsanitary. As a result they have lost a regular customer which is a shame because I really liked the spot.

I enjoy ramen. I would say this place is one of the more decent ramen places in Boston. It is not \\"the\\" best, but unless you live on Davis or Porter square, or don't mind the slow MBTA commute to get out there, Santouka Harvard Sq is a great place to get your ramen fix.\\n\\nService is decent. Atmosphere is very sober, typical Japanese functional dining hall/cafeteria style. Cleanliness depends, but most of the time quite clean. They need to replace some of the luggage baskets as they are worn out/broken (you're given a basket to put your belongings next to your table as you're seated)\\n\\nCompared to most ramen places in Boston- I don't think they give you enough pork.\\n\\nHowever, the noodle texture is just right- chewy, soaks up the full broth flavors, and the right portion per bite. The broth is excellent- all of their broth flavors took at least 20 hours of stewing out bone marrows, all the while adding water periodically so it doesn't burn. If you look behind a window next to the kitchen, you'll see they automate this process- a line of stewing broths in industrial pressure pots, with timed water dripper above, adding as the broth evaporates. Santouka is a reputable ramen chain in Japan, they've got this process down to the smallest detail for as close to perfect consistency as you can get in commercial culinary. Other ingredients, such as menma, kamaboko, hanjuku tamago, wakame, all done just right and no more. After all, It's a Japanese chain- they must follow formula from the mothership to the punctuation! For connoisseurs, since the founder originated this chain in Hokkaido, they do their their shio and miso ramen with a lot more originality and authenticity than shoyu- Creamy, with thick miso, sesame oil, and corn on the top. A very genuine flavor and texture profile those natives of Asahikawa and Sapporo will find nostalgic. \\n\\nNot many people pay attention to this- Their noodle bowl is specifically designed for their ramen broth. Next time you're there, hold it in your hand, feel its thickness, and how little heat emits from it. Observe how the narrower opening (compared to other ramen stores with the wide bowl), thick oil in between the noodle and the pork, work together to contain the heat of the broth so it doesn't cool as quickly sitting idle.\\n\\nDon't get their dumplings (gyoza), these are machine pressed. \\n\\nEdamame is a waste of time.\\n\\nHowever, the takoyaki and karaage are both nice, and their salad has a very generous portion, with a subtle miso/soy vinaigrette. For the healthy eater who feel guilty about a sodium overload from the ramen, definitely get this salad. Mixed green with generous celery and broccoli- nearly an entree size- will make you feel good about yourself all over again.\\n\\nIkura gohan is one of my favorite ramen alternatives. They're quite fresh, and very flavorful. The quality of roe and salmon exceeds some of the sushi restaurants in downtown Boston I could name, and for much less. You can get a smaller portion of the Ikura gohan with a ramen in a combo deal for between $16 and 21.\\n\\nOverall, very good for its value. Very consistent quality. Don't come for brunch on a weekend- the line is a bit stupid. And don't bother with the Back Bay location- it has 4 tables and sits 10 people (lol), the wait is never reasonable even though they call you as you're allowed to wonder off (or do they?).

I was greeted by an older gentleman that was dressed to impress and he took me to my table.  I was soon greeted by my server who was a younger female.  She was very friendly and had a good attitude. There wasnt anything spectacular about the service but it didnt suck either.  She was fairly attentive and made sure everything was ok.  I unfortunately had to leave in a haste due to work issues, so i didnt get to have the full service experience.  But what i did get was decent. She was attentive, i was sitting facing the saloon doors into the kitchen and i saw her poke her head out several times to check on me. All in all it was good service\\n\\nFood - I got the Bruschetta and the Chicken & Sausage Norcena which came with a salad so i just got plain jane ceaser salad. Normally when i Bruschetta somewhere it comes with like 4 - 6 pieces with a small amount of toppings on it.  Not bad really but when i got the Bruschetta here i was like WTF is that!  It was a huge heaping pile of Bruschetta goodness on top of 4 big pieces of bread.  Now thats what i call making an impression.  It was seriously the size of an entree if i wanted it to be and i pretty much could have.  I had 2 pieces and had to stop otherwise i wouldnt get to have room for my meal.  I wasnt used to that much on top that when you go to bite into it, you get it all over your face.  Pretty sure i had a tomato go up my nose. Hehe. It was an impressive appetizer to say the least.  The main pasta dish was with chicken & sausage with sauteed bell peppers with a creamy tomato sauce with rigatoni noodles.  It came out looking wonderful with a nice orange red hue.  The sauce was not a thick chunky sauce but a nice light creamy sauce for nice texture.  The sausage was delicious, it had a nice meaty taste and was very moist and tender.  It literally just fell apart in my mouth and didnt have that tough skin going on. Nicely done.  The chicken was also good as well, it wasnt overcooked and had a nice flavor to it that went very well with the sauce. There was a few pieces of chicken that were kinda dry in the middle somehow....  Anyways, the noodles were cooked a little too long as some were very mushy and fell apart as my fork touched it. Like if you were to touch an ash statue, it just disintegrates. The sauce was a very nice simple tomato sauce that wasnt overly complex.  It was very good and had a lot of flavor. The sad part of my meal was the bell peppers.  They were way overcooked.  They had no consistency to them at all.  No crunch, no semi solid, no nada.  They were just mushy pieces of dead plants that were formerly known as bell peppers.  But that was the only downside to meal.  The rest was a very delicious and tasty meal.  My waitress probably thought i didnt like it since i had to leave mid lunch, but it was very nice.  \\n\\nOverall - I like the atmosphere here and it has a really cool vibe.  It reminded me of the scene in The Coneheads when Dan Aykroyd is buying false papers from Adam Sandler.  The menu is also nice as it has its own items that differ from every other restaurant.  Yeah it has the main items but it had its own unique items as well.  The service was good and the food was also really good as well.  If you are looking for a more upscale feel without the upscale price then this is a nice little place to have a dinner date or go to feel like a gangster.

Sadly, they are not. The whole thing comes together as a mediocre bowl of ramen. I do like their noodles however. It's chewy and has nice texture. I just wished there was more for the price. And the meat was hardly anything to write home about. Tough to chew. Very little flavor. And the broth (I got the soy sauce broth) was just salt. Wasn't balanced at all.

They have beef noodle soup, needle thread, and dumplings among notable items on the menu. If it's a cold rainy day I almost certainly consider coming here for good reason.\\n\\nIt's at a decent location by Metrotown. Convenient to get to by transit and then follow up with a shopping trip or just heading off elsewhere. Restaurant is roughly a medium size but I've never experienced it being entirely full. Definitely a cozy place to take cover at or just hang out in for a bit.\\n\\nTypically I go for the spicy beef noodle soup with beef flank and tendon. The difference between a small and large is almost astronomical. It's not a case where the bowl is slightly larger, it's a case where the bowl is twice the size and then a bit more. Get for sure if you're a hungry eater.\\n\\nThere's an option to get bean thread instead of noodles which is kind of like a crystal vermicelli. I opt for the noodles though because the restaurant uses wide rice noodles and boy oh boy do they make it to perfection. Have a great amount of chewiness and is just delicious to eat up. The spicy soup is also a standout. It's got a good amount of spice and kick where you can savor the taste but not feel too overwhelmed by how spicy it is. You're definitely gonna drink at it a lot and not feel deterred by needing to drink water to cool down.\\n\\nSurprisingly the beef is actually the part of the dish I like the least. The beef tendon parts are nice but the cuts feel inconsistent at times. Some of the cuts are vastly smaller than others. Some are also not fully cut so you have two pieces stuck together. Could use a bit more firmness as well. The flank is also a bit hit or miss. Some pieces felt just right and were easy to bite into and feel tender enough. Other pieces felt dry at times and left some things to be desired. They're not terrible pieces of beef but would appreciate a bit more consistency in what I'm getting.\\n\\nThat's not enough though to deter me from wanting to come by frequently and having another bowl of noodles. I definitely think it's a very good option to stop by while in the area and get a good start to the day. It's also one of the most satisfying and filling places to grab a bite at.

My gf and I ended up here after waking up in a hangover-induced frenzy for fried pickles (my Yelp Elite queen) and a burger with a fried egg on top (me). After agreeing that we couldn't be bothered to Uber or publicly transport anywhere, we decided that a roundtrip half-mile walk for burgers would be a short enough scurry back to bed. My gf reluctantly conceded on her fried pickle goals.\\n\\nThe colorful chalkboard menus here are so JP, as-is the grass feed beef spin. After scouring the menu we realized that there was no fried egg burger option, however fried pickles had just become a surprise blessing in my gf's life. I guess it's cool that she got hers.\\n\\nBut don't pity me too long because I love milkshakes and guess what got their own section of the chalkboard? It was like the milkshake God Kelis herself had sensed I was about to take an L. I settled up on a PB&J milkshake and my choice was instantly validated by the praise of the employee taking our order. My gf got a hot dog and the fried pickles, I got the Cali burger and a bacon egg & cheese sandwich, cause I am fat.\\n\\nWhile we waited for them to bring out our order, we were surprised to find that they serve alcohol (mini bar and craft beers), however there were no \\"hair of the dog\\" moments for us that morning.\\n\\nMy milkshake came out first, followed by our food. The PB&J milkshake is the best milkshake I've ever had. Consistency was perfectly blended, thick but still drinkable though a straw. The PB ice cream is great and there are flecks of actual PB and jelly mixed in. The jelly blobs added some subtle flavor and texture variations throughout this drinking experience. \\n\\nMy gf thought her hot dog was alright and really only noted that there was a lot more kraut than dog. My Cali burger was disappointing. Presentation was good, definitely was a sexy burger with some Instagram potential but the taste was bland. With pepper jack, onion, avocado, and cilantro-lime mayo you'd think there'd be something fun going on in between those buns but all I picked up on was a very bitter taste from the mesclun. The burger itself was cooked medium-well. When I go to a burger place and they don't ask how I'd like it cooked then I assume that it's coming medium-rare as God intended. The $5 bacon egg & cheese sandwich seemed like a good deal at the time, but the value isn't great. One piece of bacon wound up to lift the buns up off a lonely fried egg wasn't falsely advertised, just not something you'd feel full off solo. Pretty average taste.\\n\\nWe finished our food and the fried pickles still hadn't made their way to our table so we reminded a red-headed employee about our order and he apologized profusely and offered us complimentary beers, lemonades, and milkshakes to make up for the inconvenience.

Would I miss that warm and welcoming stack of buttermilk-blueberry goodness from Magnolia during the darkest hours before the dawn? Yes. Would I be just another fat American stuffing my gaping pie hole with incredulous amounts of fat grams and calories waiting for a coronary to happen? Absolutely not, and that's why Bouldin Creek is the only place you'll ever need to go. \\n\\nI'm not about to lecture you on diet and nutrition and small planet and why the sky is blue, but if you're telling me you look good and feel good and you're on the absolute top of your game, then by golly, you're ahead of most of the crowd, and just keep doing whatever you're doing. I will tell you this: It's easy to lose weight, what's hard to do is keeping it off, and that requires a change of thinking, like hmmm, maybe you are what you eat.\\n\\nBouldin Creek is meatless, they can vegan, and in fact, I've not seen them shy away from any change or tweak I've asked of them since I've been coming here. Incidentally, I've never had a tofu scramble that tastes like real eggs, but this may be the best available in Austin. The zucchini migas and fajitas absolutely rule here. I love the greens in the soul food plate, and the black or red beans over brown rice with or without cornbread is just a great value for the price. Regardless of the food, Bouldin Creek serves one magnificent cup of black coffee, far superior to any standard restaurant or corporate franchise fare. I never actually think of this place as a local coffeehouse, although I guess technically it is. If you enjoy mochas and lattes and the like, give it a shot.\\n\\nI could argue parking and waiting can be an issue when it's crowded, and where to sit and who exactly seats you here can sometimes be confusing, and really, why can't they come up with some type of simple pancake? But that's sweating the small stuff - every Austin restaurant I've been to offers some kind of meatless accommodation or even a flash of vegetarian brilliance, but Bouldin Creek Caf√© just does it all the time, like the bright and shining beacon it is.

After a handful more visits, their solid food comes to mind ahead of the restaurant's stylishness.\\n\\nI've had great meals and average meals here, and my most recent one last night was in the former category. Our appetizer balanced the soft, flaky and moist texture of the smoked salmon with the crunch of spicy homemade chips. My caesar salad was subpar (oniony dressing and the romaine wasn't well chopped), but that was the only off note of the dinner. Their bistro steak was seared well and the chimichurri was a great accent. The cracker-jack inspired sundae for dessert was actually the highlight of the meal, and I'm not even a lover of sweets. Fresh salt caramel was quite a treat for someone like me, who's more accustomed to the candy-bar variety. \\n\\nAdding to the fun atmosphere, every table in the spacious restaurant was taken, a live band's music hovered just below conversation-level and a couple dozen walk-ins were waiting for tables by the host stand, even at 9:30 when we left.

The total was $16 and some change for my Junior Apache Impossible burger with cheesy poofs (what Southerner can resist fried pimiento cheese?!). Everything was really good. The impossible burger definitely lives up to the hype. As a meat eater I wouldn't have known this was plant-based meat if you hadn't told me. Not sure what trickery/voodoo they're doing in the kitchen but as long as it's safe I'm here for it. The cheesy poofs were just that, cheesy balls of fried pimiento cheese. Can't go wrong here. I found the sweet chili sauce it came with to be a little funky. Weird since I typically like sweet chili sauce. I ended up having them with the chipotle ranch sauce instead and it was delicious. I'd order the burger or poofs again without question. \\n\\nParking is tight to say the least.

Given this chance I decided on ramen since there aren't many ramen places around Worcester. Normally I would go to Pikaichi but now that they're close it's a little harder to find an authentic ramen shop. This place was the one that popped up closest to my location so on to our ramen adventure it was. \\n\\nA little hard to find at first since it's located in the arcade plaza right next to New England Comics. Walked in and saw a few people sitting outside waiting, it was a big party but no sheet was outside for a wait list, so me and my sister waited a while since no one came out to say anything. Finally, I decided to go ask one of the servers regarding a wait list, the whole time they had tables for smaller groups. The shop literally consisted of 6 tables, 2 4 people tables and 2 two people tables and a ramen sit in bench for 5 people. We were sat right away at that point and given menus and drink orders were taken. Although it's a small shop, it was busy for a Friday lunch. \\n\\nFood review: \\nHonestly didn't think I could find another ramen shop to compare to Pikaichi, but here we are. I got the gankara miso. The broth was extremely flavorful, thick not as spicy as I thought it would. The ramen noodles were perfect firmness, not soggy soft but not hard. Definitely made for a sick day or cold weather. The portions were large, reasonable for the price. Felt like I was in heaven with every spoonful I ate. \\n\\nSummary:\\nI definitely know where to go back for ramen if I'm ever in the area!

Before opening the doors, I saw an outdoor bar & patio area with a couple relaxing outside. As the weather warms up for Spring, this is the perfect date night spot.\\n\\nKing + Duke is stunningly beautiful. It's an American restaurant in Buckhead - Atlanta, Georgia. This place has perfected the art of food. The decor is warm and inviting - wooden accents throughout with floor to ceiling windows that allows natural light to burst through. Every detail has been thought of and curated for your senses. As soon as you walk in, you will see an open fire kitchen and the bar to your left and two floors for dining.\\n\\nOn Thursday night, I was able to go in without a reservation for 7PM. I wouldn't recommend this, but it was possible and I appreciated that.\\n\\nChef's table is available by reservation only and located in front of a 24-foot wood-fired hearth. I'm shocked how they pulled this off. Open flames tend to look rustic, but it seemed to fit perfectly in this refined space. Plus - I couldn't smell smoke so the place is ventilated extremely well.\\n\\nPro Tip: Don't skip the bread. It comes out with every meal and it's flaky, moist, cheesy, and I ate every crumb.\\nFor an appetizer, we ordered the Georgia shrimp with lemon, butter, ham and toast. This is one of the best appetizers I've ever had. I'm not the biggest fan of keeping the head and the tail on for flavor and visual aesthetics, but I'm officially on board. The delicate, buttery notes - took me places. You have to order this. I don't care what else you order.\\n\\nWe also ordered Jonah Crab Toast as a second appetizer that was packed with crab, avocado, & radish. This was a refreshing bite and I was shocked how much crab was plated. They definitely feed you - the portions are favorable.\\n\\nFor the entree, I ordered the Porchetta with apples, turnips, white beans, & sorghum gastrique. It was everything you can imagine and so much more - crispy on the outside, melt in your mouth on the inside. With every bite, I nodded my head - saying, wow this is good. Sorghum is a cereal grain that grows tall like corn. Gastrique is essentially a sweet and sour sauce; a caramelized sugar, deglazed with vinegar.\\n\\nThe gentleman ordered the Gulf Black Drum with a barigoule sauce. Blue Drum is a saltwater fish known for its dark and hint of blue color. Barigoule is actually a dish that hails from Provence, France, made from braised artichokes in a warm and slightly tangy white-wine broth. I regret not tasting this dish, but he loved it.\\n\\nWould you like to see the dessert menu? Of course we do.\\n\\nFor dessert, they are known for their Sticky Toffee Pudding. We decided to go with an Orange Creme Caramel with milk crumble, whipped cream and candied orange zest. Imagine a creamy flan with orange accents. It was a bit too sweet for my taste and without even asking our server told us it would be taken off our bill.\\n\\nAll of the cocktails were made extremely well: I ordered the Penicillin & the Placebo and my date ordered an aviation - so if you're looking for unique and tasty cocktails - they will exceed your expectations.\\n\\nService is wonderful. Our server's name was Ronnie and he went above and beyond to make this first date memorable.\\nThe appetizers range form $6-15 and entrees on average are about $30.\\n\\nFor parking, I would recommend everyone pay the $2 for Valet. It's cheaper than paying the self park fee of $8+. My only critique is that they bring on a cashless system to pay/tip the Valet.\\n\\nI couldn't say enough nice things about King + Duke.

More flavorful potatoes on this dish too by the way :D\\n\\nSECO A LA NORTE√ëA an old family recipe - lamb shank slow-cooked in the Northern Peruvian style, in a rich cilantro-black beer sauce, served with a classic guiso de frijoles, garlic rice and salsa criolla $30 - oh man...................I'm not a huge fan of lamb, but this was freakin' delicious!!! You can tell that this was slow cooked for a really long time, and it really just falls off the bone with a light prick from a fork. \\n\\nQUINOTTO \\"CHISAYA MAMA\\" the Incas referred to quinoa as the mother of all grains - quinoa \\"risotto\\" with Grana Padano cheese, golden beets, local mushrooms and market fresh vegetables, laced with truffle oil $20 - Great alternative to Paella if you want to try something new. The quinoa was so rich and cheesy you really don't miss the carbs.\\n\\nWe also had a pork chop special that was insanely delicious too - the texture was just right, I think this may have been one of the best pork chops I've ever had.\\n\\nThe owner is also the cutest...she goes by every table and chats with everyone to make sure they're having a good time.

I don't remember the name of the fries I ordered, they were thin-cut with olive oil, rosemary and garlic. Pretty delicious. Regular fries are available for the same price, or for a little more you can get a few other options.\\n\\nAnnoyingly, this place subscribes to the √† la carte style of ordering, where you pay separately for every component of the meal. I'm definitely not a fan of this type of pricing, especially for a fast food burger joint.  I'm sure it's great for them, because with just a small side of fries and a small drink, you're already looking at $12. It's not great for you or me, for precisely the same reason.  The other day I was at a different restaurant of the same type -- counter service, tasty made to order burgers. But they offered a good size, filling burger meal including fries and a drink for around $8.\\n\\nSo I guess to me, the real question is whether or not Smashburger is worth that 50% premium.  Well, as I said, there are a few burgers that sound pretty tasty.  So maybe enough times to try some of them.  But in terms of value for money, one can do better."},{"name":"Island Wing Company Bar & Grill - Hunters Creek","address":"2079 W Town Center Blvd","city":"Orlando","stars":"3.5","text":"I had the Chili Mac and it was delicious.

It allows for functionality without the restrictions that higher end restaurants have, which indicates that the target audience is more for the everyday kind of customer while also giving a more premium experience.

Even with all that hype, it took us 3 years to make it in. 3 years of wasted time... 3 years worth of tacos I could have been enjoying. Oh, the regret!\\n\\nI read the Yelp reviews, I can't imagine what it would take to please the people that aren't impressed. Is this a 5 michelin star restaurant? Heavens, no. It's just some damn good mexican food... in Ocoee! Locals should be proud, shout it from the rooftops, support local business, esp. when it's this good.\\n\\nLet me tell you why you should *not* be joining my newly formed \\"Taco Regret Club\\" (in other words: grab someone you love and get in the car and get your booty in here): We were greeted and ordered at the counter when we came in, it's a small building with only a few tables inside, some outside seating is also available. The menu is on the wall with pictures and the staff was friendly and easy to ask questions of. We were offered a table by a couple who was there to grab their pick up order. Even the customers are friendly!\\n\\nI'll start with the salsa, because this might be one of the best I've had, and I spent 15+ years in central valley California, a place that is saturated in excellent Mexican food. It arrived fast with chips and extra plates for each of us. This salsa was complex, had a depth of flavor and this wonderful vinegary tang that was smoothed out by the avocado chucks generously present in the salsa. It was fresh and so well balanced that I pondered why my homemade salsa didn't taste this good. My family of 4 raved about this salsa, including my daughter who swears she can't stand fresh cilantro. The cilantro was just the right amount, lending it's fresh flavor to the salsa without overpowering it.\\n\\nMy husband ordered the fish tacos, my son ordered the chicken quesadilla, my daughter and I decided to split a burrito with seasoned pork and the green enchilada with all the cilantro on the side for Miss Fussy Pants. My son loved his dish, he said the cheese was amazing and so gooey! He can't wait to come back and have it again. My daughter and I agreed that the winner was the green enchiladas, we normally can't stand corn tortillas, always opting for flour when it's an option, but these enchiladas were amazing! The tortillas were corn, but they weren't like any corn tortillas we've ever had. My husband agreed, his fish tacos were all corn tortillas and we all went on about how airy they were. They aren't dense and bone dry like other corn tortillas are. Hubby also said the fry on the fish was light and crispy, just the right amount of breading to not weigh the fish down.\\n\\n4 sauces were on the table... 2 green and 2 red (a mild and a spicy for each color). Hubby and the kiddos tried them all (I wasn't wanting anything spicy, so I passed on the hots, opting to only try the milds). The green was about what you'd expect for a verde sauce, but I really liked the red. It wasn't like a traditional taco sauce, it tasted more like a vinegar based red drizzle (it wasn't thick). I liked it. The kids liked the hot ones, freaks that they are.\\n\\nSo, bottom line is I have 3 years of lost time to make up for, so I'll be back!

We had reservations and fortunately, it was the 2nd UT game of the season so the very small space was not very packed. They have taken to the up and coming trend of community seating, which I quite like when you're about to have a culinary experience. It makes it that much more enjoyable being able to meet new people and talk about what you're there to do, eat delicious food!\\n\\nWe started with the summer beans and toasted ravioli. The summer beans were fantastic and refreshing, also full of a summery flavor. The toasted shrimp ravioli wasn't as satisfying to me though. It seemed to lack a bit of the flavor it sounded like it would provide. I wouldn't order this again. For the second plate I delighted in the pork belly soup. This, hands down was my most favorite dish there. It was a bit hard to eat in a bowl since it required both fork and knife to cut the pork, but the taste made it worth it. We ended with the honeyed figs & toasted marshmallow. I wanted to love this dish, I really did but to me, the flavors just did not go well together. \\n\\nAll in all, the ambiance was absolutely beautiful, the waitstaff knew their menu and were attentive, and the chef has great presentation and creativity.

If there is a prevailing feeling of laziness, you might even considering ordering in from here. I love the theme and the concept. It's a cool place and the cartoon art above the bar is just awesome. Although all of that is great, how is the burger?\\n\\nDixie Burger (3/5 stars): it's an obvious choice, simply even for being the more interesting of burgers on the menu. With the runny pimento cheese and double party, it scream deliliciousness without being over the top (yes vortex, I am pointing to you). That being said, I thought it was a good burger, just not an amazing burger. The bun is horrible, way squishier than any bread should be and likely pumped with chemicals before even getting to the restaurant. The meat quality was mediocre, the beef was not impressive and flavorless. No better than Walmart grade (yes, that is a grade in my book). The combination was a winner with pimento cheese and a fried green tomato.\\n\\nValue (2/5 stars): for 8 bucks, even with a couple patties on there, this burger was still rather small without really a reason to warrant it. They did not use a ground beef that could warrant a higher price or even a bun. \\n\\nAmbiance (3/5 stars): this place has very much of a roadside vibe to it and I am fine with that. It is by no means cozy. The art inside is awesome. The patio is next to the road, a few plants would have been nice to make it feel a little less like you are sitting in the middle of a parking lot.\\n\\nSelection (2/5): I am not talking only about selection of burgers here. Why is there no recycling bin on the patio? So much waste. Why is there not even a healthier drink on the menu like a Naked Juice or Arden's? I get the whole badass theme, but let's get damn honest here. At 12 bucks for a small burger with fries, this place is not catering to lower class that grindhouse cinema used to. It is not located on 42nd St of NYC in 1920s. It's a sprawling area, where exorbitant prices are being charged for what one gets and not doing recycling or sourcing better ingredients does not land this place highly in my book.

We came there around 11am on a Saturday morning and didn't get to eat until after 12pm. It is cafeteria style - so you can't get reservations or put your name down, you pretty much stand in line and order what you want and pay up front and either take it to go or eat there. Being out of town, I was not aware of this. BUT the wait is SO worth it. Saying the food was delicious would be an understatement. The four stars is because of the long wait, and the limited amount of seats. I felt like I was so squished in between people even while sitting, and I even had to get up once to let the waitress go through with the food in her hand for another customer.

We LOVED the pimento cheese hushpuppies- the perfect kick! Also the beet salad and mussels were to die for. For our entree we did the shellfish dish which although the flavor was great, it wasn't worth $38 with shrimp that were fully intact with shells and heads and also having to crack lobster.

They were not that flavorful though, tasted like a baked sweet potato with no seasoning.  The lobster mac and cheese had big clumps of lobster and plenty of cheese.  It was pretty well executed, but since the lobster was not baked in the cheese you had to stack the ingredients.  The star dish was the apple brie flatbread.

Maybe I just didnt try hard enough. So today when a friend was asking me for recommendation I just have this place pop in my mind. \\n\\nThe food was good and they put a small \\"happy birthday\\" and candle on my husband's dessert as well. (By the way, you can not bring your own cake, if you need to order a cake from them you should make a reservation and they can make one. You can not bring your own wine either.:(\\n\\nFor parking, you can get a discounted validation for the Prudential Garage only.

One good tip before coming is that you have to make a reservation so they know your coming or else you will have to wait for them to make a table for you. Me and my sisters came for a late breakfast, not too crowed (12am). We had a crepes, salmon eggs Benedict, and pancakes. I decided to go for the crepes because I wanted to try something knew and surprisingly they were actually good. The pancakes were mainly cinnamon. And the eggs Benedict was good as usual. Probably wouldn't come back for breakfast. Probably will comeback for lunch. But the waiter was very nice and they play such great music their. Makes you feel like your re living the olden days.

It's in a warehouse with very high ceilings and huge space. However at night it gets extremely packed despite how large the restaurant is. So try to make reservations if you are coming to dinner or be ready to wait at least 30 min. The restaurant will have live music a lot. The lightning is dark. They have large artwork all over their walls. \\n\\nThe food- very fresh and flavorful. I've been to two urban licks for both brunch and dinner. I say try both. For brunch I had a Egg BLT sandwich with pimento cheese which was ridiculous. My friend got fried chicken and waffles. For dinner (more menu choices than brunch obviously) - I had calamari with wasabi mayonnaise and sweet and spicy chili sauce. Too good! For the main course I had scallops and shrimp on top of grits. My date had lobster and shrimp over mashed potatoes. We were both satisfied with except my date said the lobster was smaller than expected. \\n\\nService -  not so great at brunch. It was slow with plenty of staff present despite the restaurant being empty. It was average for dinner, a little better than brunch. But because the restaurant is so \\"hip\\" it seems like they think we should be happy to be there.

We also orders the seafood spring rolls which were served atop an amazing blend of sweet and tangy sauces for dipping. It left you craving more!!\\nI am so glad I stuck with my entree though, which was the crispy beef. Perfectly done. The beef crispy, sweet and perfectly cooked paired with saut√©ed vegetables!!! The sauce was sweet and full of flavors or garlic, ginger, and so many other spices I wouldn't attempt to identify!!\\nMy colleague had the lobster fried rice and as delicious as my entree was, I had food envy!!!!
