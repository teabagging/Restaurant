Now, even though the description said, \\"housemade beef sausage\\" and Frank is pretty much all hot dogs/sausages, I actually thought this would be a cheeseburger.  You probably think that's pretty stupid of me, but I thought Frank just might have the occasional burger.  After all, it was a *special*.  The main reason I thought it would be a cheeseburger was not just because of the name, but also because I got a \\"half sausage\\" burger at BB Rover's once, and it was actually a burger.  I figured Frank's would be similar to that.  My mistake, I guess.  I nearly ordered a plain dog instead, and now I wish I had.\\n\\nI was not completely surprised when I saw that my \\"burger\\" was a full-fledged sausage.  Should have trusted my first instinct.  I decided to just deal with it, though, and try to like it.  Well, I didn't think the sausage tasted very good.  And it was fatty, like chewy.  Also, there was no bacon nor cheese on it like there was supposed to be.  I let the bartender know about that and he went back to the kitchen to kick some ass and get me some cheese and bacon.  So I put the cheese and bacon on there, took the sausage off, and proceeded to eat everything else.  The secret sauce was actually quite good, but I think it was simply mustard and mayonnaise mixed together.  Good bun.  I still ate less than half, though.  My cell phone began frustrating me (wouldn't connect to the internet... screw you, Sprint), so I became obsessed with getting back to the office to call their tech support gurus from the land line.  As such, the bartender was confused because I wanted my check so quickly.  I told him I didn't really like the \\"burger\\" and that it wasn't what I expected it to be.  He comped it, which was cool.\\n\\nI wish I knew the bartender's name so I could give him personal props.  He was really steamed about the cooks forgetting the cheese and bacon, and I overheard another bartender say, \\"That's the second time that's happened today.\\"  \\n\\nI had rated Frank at 2 stars originally, as you read above, but the bartender was so frickin' awesome that I'm going to bump them up to three.  I paid $2 for my tea and gave the bartender a 100% tip.  I really want to like Frank (I sound like I'm talking about a date)!  \\n\\nIn conclusion, if you like sausages, waffle fries, and drinking iced tea out a jar (which was pretty cool), you'll love Frank.  They get excellent reviews here, and I'm sure that's right, normally.  I guess I caught them on an off day.  But I wish I had known that the cheeseburger wasn't going to be a cheeseburger.  If they had called it \\"Bacon Cheeseburger Sausage\\", I would not have been misguided.  Instead, it was simply called \\"Bacon Cheeseburger\\".  I want to try a plain dog, but I'm afraid it'll taste too much like a sausage.  I'm just not a sausage person.

I have ordered french toast twice and both times they looked very pretty but super dry no joke they were never dipped in any kind if custard or egg batter was like toast with powdered sugar. It seems like its easy for them to drop bacon and sausages in a deep fryer so dry and greasy at the same time. They waitress are always super lost. They have the potential to be great because the food looks good and the concept is good. I have eaten the salmon patties they pretty good but definitely canned salmon. The cheese u ask for on your eggs is actually sliced american cheese they did not ask. I assumed was cheddar. French toast super duper dry not moist and juicy. I hate the fact that they deep fry bacon and the sausage was not moist was hard could not even cuz with my knife. The good thing eggs are not over cooked and waffle was really nice very good.

The hostess mentioned a 30 minute wait, but since we were a party of 2, they would be able to work us in much faster. I didn't believe the latter part for a single second, and even less so when I saw how busy it was inside after we parked.

Luckily, we had no problem finding street parking a little further down the street.\\n\\nOrdering:\\nThere are small order slips you can write your meal order on. We each examined the menu for a good 10 minutes, deciding on an entree and sides before completely changing our minds entirely every couple of minutes because of the massive amount of options.  I finally settled on the four piece fried chicken with fried green tomatoes and the Mac and cheese on the side ($13.95).\\n\\nFood: \\nWe dug into our bread: yeast rolls, corn bread muffins and cinnamon bread! All of which were very yummy, or we were very hungry. To our delight, our food came out surprisingly quickly, so we set our bread aside for our fried delectables. The fried chicken reminded me of Popeyes Chicken (yes, it's fast food, but I LOVE Popeyes!). I wasn't a fan of the Mac and cheese: it wasn't very cheesy but eggy, as Teresa L. had noted in her review. I was hoping it was just a fluke, but alas, it was not and I will probably never order it again.

Went with medium spice figuring I could always add more at the table. My wingman went with a Karaage chicken (fried) ramen deal that included some Nori seaweed, a seasoned soft boiled egg, and sprouts for $13.\\n\\nAfter a short wait, not long considering they were slammed and everything is made fresh, two big bowls of noodles appeared. My egg was indeed perfectly poached, which allowed the yolk to add some silky texture to the broth. The spice level was a good heat requiring only a slight up-kick and nothing was salty. My wide slices of chicken breast were fall-apart tender while the noodles needed a satisfying slurp and chew. The bok choy was a vital add, it provided crunch and sweetness to the brew -- highly suggest it with this ramen.\\n\\nThe Karaage chicken ramen arrived with gigantic chunks of crispy chicken and several sheets of Nori to fold in, a very attractive presentation and a dish that was judged very hearty and filling.\\n\\nIn fact, as we slurped up the last traces of our rich broths, we agreed that apps were probably only ever needed for a VERY hungry dinner visit, or considering that they are open to 11pm and have a surprisingly nice craft beer menu (I did nail the last Tropicalia in the building) a late night snack.\\n\\nOnly possible nit is the price point.

I wouldn't say rude, but just totally indifferent. It was kind of a turn off immediately. \\n\\nOur waiter came right over and took a drink order. He was pretty good throughout the meal.

I'm not a fan of this multi person approach to service but whatever. \\n\\nMy wife had fish and chips. I had the Ipswich clam\\nRoll with fries and cole slaw. I also had the lobster bisque. She loved the fish and chips. The batter was light and the fish very moist and tender, although the tarter sauce was some modern interpretation. Some things are best left as they are. The lobster bisque was quite good. Not too much meat though for 11 bucks. The clam roll wasn't good. The clams were tasteless and the roll was WAY too big. It also tasted like it was a week old. The coleslaw was weird. The cabbage wasn't cut up enough so every fork full was full of these 6\\" strands of cabbage. You had to twirl it on your fork like pasta. \\n\\nMinor annoyances included having both entrees delivered without ketchup, even though we both had fries. And lobster bisque being served without crackers. When I asked for ketchup the girl (not our server) came back and plopped down this mini cart full of about 8 different condiments. I had to remove half of them to get then ketchup which was wedged under the handle in the middle. \\n\\nNo booze and no drink refills and the bill came to $53 for lunch. Eh.

The location is across from City Hall. This just opened and looks like it caters to the mid week lunch crowd. Surprised it was open on a weekend but it was still crowded. The set up here is strange and when you enter, you are not sure where to order. The menu consists of soups of all types, salads and sandwiches. It is set up like a Panera/Au Bon Pain style, with two team members behind the counter preparing items. The thing I found weird is they give out samples of soup to customers which is sort of like an ice cream shop. Soup is not ice cream and I think that idea is odd, given that this could become cumbersome on busy days. \\n\\nThe soups were pretty good with a large array like Potato Cheese, Tomato Bisque and other concoctions. All come with a side of bread, but why have a side of bread when you are having a sandwich? Weird! The sandwiches were all prepared in wrap form or in panini style and really small. The food is actually pretty good. You could order a half sandwich with soup or salad. Prices were okay, kind of steep for just a cup of soup and a sandwich but it is the city so I would expect this.

Dim lighting. Tables, chairs, and paneling were wooden! Noisy but not ridiculously loud (though at one point the large dinner party next to us was exceptionally loud.\\n\\nI love the fact you can order breakfast items all day.\\n\\nWe ordered the hummus platter to start. Very tasty and the diced tomatoes really add to the flavor. The sun-dried tomatoes were a great addition, pretty sure they made it themselves and it tastes much better than those you'd find elsewhere.\\n\\nUnfortunately, our main dishes came by shortly after getting the hummus. I blame the fact we waited so long for the appetizers.\\n\\nI ordered the coq au vin blanc, which was a chicken braise cooked in white wine. Very delicious. Not saturated in fat and butter that you'd see in other French restaurants (a plus for me). LARGE portions. Like seriously. My friend ordered the beef bourguignon, which she LOVED.\\n\\nAfterwards, we got dessert, the sea salt caramel gelato and the raspberry sorbetto. The sorbetto was puckering to say the least, I suspect a puree. But the gelato, my God... absolutely heavenly. I had my doubts about the \\"sea salt\\" aspect, but wow did it blow my taste buds. The silky texture and the incredible flavor was an amazing culinary experience. Probably my favorite thing at Blue Dahlia, next to the ambiance.\\n\\nOverall, the food (most definitely the gelato) and the atmosphere of Blue Dahlia makes it a definite 5. I knocked it down to a 4 because of the wait. It wasn't particularly busy when we ordered the hummus, but the time in between the appetizer and our entrees was noticeably short (fortunately the hummus was a cold appetizer). Another couple next to us waited a while as well.\\n\\nI would highly recommend this restaurant for catching up, dates, or a small family dinner!"},{"name":"Pizzeria Locale","address":"1730 Pearl St","city":"Boulder","stars":"4","text":"Amazing artisanal wood fired sourdough pizza.

The homemade chips that come with sandwiches are awesome, really like em. \\n\\nThe sandwiches on the other hand, need a serious overhaul. I'm sure something like a meatball sub would be passable, especially since they make their meatballs, which are delicious. But the pastrami is awful. Seriously the worst pastrami sandwich I've ever had. I felt less ripped off paying $38 for one at the Carnegie deli in NY. First off: on the menu it says \\"subs\\" and then \\"sandwiches\\" which led me to believe it wasn't on a sub roll (I could have asked, so really my own fault I guess) but if everything is on a sub then don't make it a separate category? The pastrami is thick cut, like a ham steak, which I order a pastrami sandwich I definitely did not expect. Maybe shaved pastrami, like I've had on every other sandwich I've ever had throughout my entire life isn't as implicit as I thought... but basically it was nearly $14 for a crappy pastrami sandwich made on a mediocre white sub roll, and I honestly was stunned at how off the mark this was. They should call it the \\"Horsemeat\\" sandwich because that's what it was like eating it. I'm normally in defense of their prices because a $5 or $6 slice is actually two slices, so it's a really good deal... but not for this."},{"name":"Lee and Ricks Oyster Bar","address":"5621 Old Winter Garden Rd","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"At first perception the place isn't impressive at all and the main door looks like a back bathroom entrance from some getto alley.

I tried the classic glazed ring doughnut, homer doughnut, triple penetration, the Bavarian cream filled chocolate doughnut, the voodoo doll, dirt and my captain o captain doughnut. \\n\\nThe classic - it was so fluffy and thick but so light and moist. It was amazing. I would definitely recommend this one. \\n\\nHomer doughnut - not overly sweet. It's a doughnut based off the Simpsons cartoon. A strawberry frosted ring doughnut with sprinkles. I would recommend if you like strawberry.\\n\\nTriple penetration - a chocolate cake doughnut topped with chocolate frosting and cocopuffs on top. Really delicious and a chocolate lovers dream. \\n\\nBavarian cream doughnut - chocolate frosted and filled with custard. It was ok but I would pass on this one. \\n\\nVoodoo doll - definitely looks the coolest but the flavor was my least favorite. Chocolate frosted raspberry jam filled. I would get this for the gram but not again for taste. Skip it. \\n\\nDirt - ring doughnut covered in Oreos and white frosting. It was alright. If you like Oreo, this might be your best bet. \\n\\nCaptain - ring doughnut covered in captain crunch. This one was good. \\n\\nOverall, I loved the ring doughnuts. The filled doughnuts were dry and didn't have enough filling so I would skip them. I recommend you eat the doughnuts within the same day and that you eat the cereal crusted ones the quickest since the cereal gets stale and soggy easily. My favorite was the class original glazed ring doughnut, triple penetration, the captain doughnut and the homer."},{"name":"Mary Mac's Tea Room","address":"224 Ponce De Leon Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"This is one of the best places to eat comfort food!

Please keep in mind that you can never take more than 10-15 minutes to make fried rice. Also we were seated first. Seated before 3 different groups came inside the restaurant.

The restaurant is located in downtown Westerville. (which everyone should check out)\\n\\n I feel as though the restaurant is suffering dual personalities because of a recent remodel, but it is still so delicious and adds to its quaint personality so I am not going to complain. Off the street there is an open restaurant with multiple tables, then walk further in and you see the original Pasquales. (You use to be able to only enter it from the alley, now they have a street side entrance). The interior is decorated as though you are sitting outside of an Italian eatery, complete with fake shrubbery, bricks, and a pastry counter. \\n\\nWe ordered a 14\\" supreme pizza and split a dinner salad. Now, let me just cut to the details, their pizza is amazing. Normally, no matter where you go you can easily blot the grease off of a slice of pizza... but this place is different. They use just a little bit of sauce, layer on the toppings, and then put the cheese on top of that. This leaves a fresh, crunchy pizza (where the peppers and everything you ordered on top aren't soggy and grease-ridden) and then extra cheese-i-ness on top! I just can't do this pizza justice, go try it... now... I mean why are you still reading this??\\n\\nAfter gorging ourselves on pizza we also split a cannoli (this is not advised due to their naturally small size and how delicious they are, go ahead, just get 2..or 3...). \\n\\nThe staff here is also super friendly. I went on a week day night and it seemed like everyone in the place must have been regulars since they all heckled each other and customers greeted staff by first name and vice versa.

The bar area is very cramped but the bar staff were very friendly and attentive and there are all kinds of historical memorabilia on the walls. They even have a plaque on the wall with the names of famous people and celebrities who have patronized the restaurant. When we were finally seated, we ordered the Chilled Seafood Sampler, Fish and Chips, Pan-Seared Crab Cakes Salad and Boston Baked Beans. The food was good, not great. And while the servers were polite, they were hurriedly trying to get us to leave. They even tried clearing our table while we were still eating and plates still had food without asking if we were finished.

We wound up sitting on the patio outside, which had a great vibe!  When the weather is nice, this is definitely a great choice.   \\n\\nThe big theme here is fire.  Food is cooked over an open flame and I enjoyed watching the open kitchen inside.  The ambiance is very nice, and makes a great place for a romantic dinner or a night out with friends.  \\n\\nFirst off, as someone that loves onion soup, I had to try the coal roasted onion soup.  It was simply superb.  It went well with the amazing complementary bread that is also phenomenal.  I could make a meal just from the bread and soup!  Several friends have told me that I have to try the soup, and it definitely did not disappoint.  \\n\\nFor the entree, I'm still a little shocked that I wound up ordering \\"the Duke\\", which is the hamburger.  I would normally not get a burger at a high end restaurant but several tables nearby convinced me to get the burger.  After watching several burgers arrive at our nearby tables, and hearing the waiter extol the virtues of the burger, I felt compelled to try it.  \\n\\nFirst of all, the cheese was overpowering.  In addition, the burger itself just didn't have a lot of flavor.  I was surprised, to say the least.  Next time I will definitely try steak or fish.

Since the dinner menu is on the pricier side, my friend says she goes for Happy Hour--which I believe starts at 4 p.m.--when she does dine at Andina ... simply because one of her favorite things on the menu is on the HH menu, and most drinks are $6 instead of $12.\\n \\nI've only had Peruvian food once before, but I remember liking it, so I was down to try Andina. We got there right at 4 p.m.--my friend says this place definitely gets busy if you go later--so we went for an early dinner to celebrate my birthday.\\n \\nThe HH menu only features a few tapas, but my friend loves the HH for this very reason ... but it includes some of her favorite dishes. The tapas come in three portion sizes--small, medium and large--so it's conducive to ordering family-style and sharing everything.\\n \\nMy friend said she never ordered the chicken before, but I wanted to try it. Since there were three of us, we ordered large portions of the \\"Anticucho de Pulpo\\" (grilled octopus kebob) and \\"Anticucho de Corazon\\" (marinated beef heart kebobs) and a medium portion of the \\"Anticucho de Pollo\\" (marinated chicken kebobs). I questioned the portion size, but my friend said the \\"small\\" usually entails one piece of the octopus or one kebob .... So ordering small sizes of everything wouldn't be conducive to splitting and sharing among the three of us.\\n \\nBecause we showed up at the beginning of HH, we were seated immediately and our drink orders were taken. Our server was extremely helpful--we asked about recommendations and I inquired about the \\"Golpe de Estado\\" drink in particular, which I was interested in trying. Our server highly recommended it and told me that it was the best chocolate milkshake I'd ever have (that detail sold me!). Not only was service stellar (water refills without asking, etc.) but our food was also brought out really quickly, starting with the complimentary bread. Our waiter even took the time to give a detailed explanation of each type of dipping sauce (basically, mild, medium and spicy) that came with the bread.\\n \\nThis trip to Andina made a believer out of me, and I already can't wait until my next visit to the eatery. Here's what we got:\\n\\nANTICUCHO DE POLLO: This and the grilled octopus were probably tied for my favorite, out of the three dishes we ordered. This dish featured marinated chicken kebobs, served with a spicy salsa de rocoto. I used a little of the dipping sauce to drizzle over my chicken, but I felt that kebobs actually featured sufficient flavor on their own. The chicken itself was perfectly grilled--not tough and chewy, but tender and moist--which was pleasant to experience, as I've had my fair share of grilled chicken that was dry and tough. I'd definitely order this portion again; the medium was a great size for sharing.\\n\\nANTICUCHO DE PULPO: This was actually the FIRST time I ever tried octopus, but my friend said the grilled octopus here was THE best because it wasn't tough and rubbery. This entr√©e featured grilled octopus kebobs with rocoto and caper chimichurri. Now, I really did like the octopus in of itself--if no one told me I was eating octopus (and if I were eating blindfolded, I might have never known)--but I think the best part was the caper chimichurri and the mashed potato-like starch under each octopus kebab. It was deliciously seasoned and I loved the caper chimichurri. True to my friend's word, the octopus did not taste rubbery. It was chewy enough and didn't have an overly fishy taste. I definitely enjoyed it and will be back for more.\\n\\nANTICUCHO DE CORAZ√ìN: While the marinated beef heart kebobs--served with a spicy salsa de rocoto--were delicious and flavorful, they weren't my favorite just because I always preferred chicken over beef. The beef was good, don't get me wrong--not too chewy and bursting with flavor--but I ate more of the chicken kebobs than the beef ones.\\n\\nGOLPE DE ESTADO: Though this wasn't the best chocolate milkshake I've ever had, I must say, it was darn close! I really enjoyed this drink (more than I thought I would) and look forward to ordering it again. It features a 100 percent cacaolicuado de chocolate (chocolate milkshake) spiked with a pre-Columbian spiced rum (vanilla, smoked peppers and allspice), topped with a tres leches whipped cream. The drink itself was served in a tall glass that's perfect for milkshakes. I like sweeter drinks, so I'm not the hugest fan of alcohol or beer, but this rum-infused drink truly hit the spot. It didn't have a super strong rum flavor, but it was sufficient enough so that I could taste the vanilla and spices with every gulp. The drink itself was smooth and frothy, and though I normally don't like whipped cream, that tres leches whipped cream was the PERFECT complement. I highly recommend this drink if you love chocolate or prefer sweeter drinks ... this one's definitely a winner."},{"name":"Katana Teppanyaki & Sushi","address":"3345 Lenox Rd NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"The location is prime in Buckhead and it has a very swanky exterior.

I was surprised to note that vegetables were not included with the teppanyaki menu which is already pricey on its own. For two people you will easily spend over $100. \\n\\nOur chef was very efficient with the food. He did however put every item on a separate plate and that made our dining area cluttered.

(i knew i was in trouble by this point) \\nShockingly, not forever for my baked brie to arrive.... and that is because it was refrigerator cold in the center.  Not melted, not hot, not warm, not even room temperature.  The \\"baked\\" brie was rolled in whatever delicious crust, but i don't know that it ever made it too the oven. \\nI asked to speak with the manager. \\nForever for him to arrive.  I kindly asked for him to remove the brie & bring my check ASAP. \\nMy drink long gone, I was moments from walking when i caught the eye of the manager, and instead of coming over again, he scurried away.  \\nI got my hopes up that this would at least produce a check....but you guessed it.  \\nForever later.... i finally left.  \\n\\nI had read the reviews before my visit.   Thank God my expectations were low, and there is a distractingly gorgeous view, but I didn't really enjoy my visit.  I was glad I was by myself; I didn't feel bad telling the manager nicely, but firmly, that i had had enough... but if you are considering bringing someone here to impress or to share a special night..... I would suggest another place; it would feel horrible to be in the same situation I was in, but on a special night. \\n\\nSomewhat unrelated- but you can get a great view from the Skywalk Observatory one floor below.It is $16 or part of the city pass, and a great way to start your visit to boston.

I had heard good things about The Optimist and I do love seafood, we made a reservation for a Friday night. \\n\\nAPPS: We shared several appetizers, one of which I LOVED, the other that were just okay. Mussels with toast was the one I loved. Delicious, great flavors in the sauce that worked together so well -- I practically licked the bowl clean with that toast! The Endive Salad was tasty, but nothing too special. The last one was a raw fish with a pomegranate kind of sauce - very nice presentation, but not super noteworthy in terms of flavor. It was definitely fresh though! \\n\\nMAIN: My main of scallops ($33-ish I believe?) was good, but not knock-your-socks off good. They were cooked nicely (have to be careful with scallops) and I enjoyed them, but I definitely wouldn't order them again. The flavors just didn't quite work perfectly for me -- there honestly wasn't enough flavor in the sauce in my opinion. \\n\\nDESSERT: I don't remember the name of what we ordered (see my picture and you can guess though), but it was just okay. Not noteworthy -- I remember being a bit disappointed because I think upscale places should always have baller dessert. \\n\\nAMBIANCE: The ambiance is quite nice. We sat inside because it was a chilly night, but they have outdoor seating for when it is warmer. It is well decorated on the inside with high ceilings, but our seats seemed too close to the people next to us. The place is big -- it seemed surprising to me how close the next table was (especially in Atlanta, might expect it in New York with absurd square footage price!) \\n\\nSERVICE: Quite good. Server was friendly, polite, and reasonably attentive. No complaints! \\n\\nVALUE: This is where I have my qualms. Granted, I am a graduate student, so I don't have much money. Therefore, spending a lot on a meal is a bigger deal to me than most; If I'm going to be spending close to $100 for just myself, my meal better be phenomenal. It was good, but not phenomenal. Maybe I just didn't order the right things? Not sure. \\n\\nOVERALL: Pricey place. Some very good things but some just-okay things too.

Not sure where to start so let me sum it up:\\n\\n1.  No lights on when we arrived to set up.  We had to ASK someone to turn them on.\\n\\n2. Freezing cold!  And, we had to ask for heat.  Heat subsequently turned WAY up.  Needless to say, the request to moderate the heat landed us back in the deep freeze.\\n\\n3.  Floors in our meeting room were filthy.  Lone guy at work tried to mop and sweep (yep, we had to TELL him to get a vacuum).\\n\\nMop must not have been clean as the smell of dirty water was STRONG.  So strong that we sent someone to the store for Febreeze and Glade candles!  This is seriously problematic but who wants to eat lunch smelling dirty mop water?  Exactly.\\n\\n4.  Banquet staff person assigned to our event was Stephanie who when we expressed concern about the condition of the space at 10 am for an 11 am event start time looked at us like WE were three simpletons and said \\"well, your event isn't until11 am!\\"  Translation:  what's the problem?\\n\\nAs we pointed out the dirt, debris (including a generous smattering of leaves) on the floor, she didn't seem the least bit concerned.  Nor was she worries about dirty linen, nasty glass and hurricane vases.  Nor was she in a hurry to get the easel or podium that we ordered.\\n\\nThe lack of interest, concern or sense of urgency seemed to match Berwick's decor and condition--old, tired and worn out.  \\n\\nThe Women's Restroom can only be summed up with \\"Eeeeeewwwwwwww!!!\\"  It was filthy.  How can you not at least sweep the floor and clean the counter and toilets.\\n\\nOh, did I mention that this was an event for WOMEN???\\nNo surprise, they were still cleaning when our guests started to arrive.\\n\\nSo...it's 4 hours later and Stephanie hasn't shown her face.

I think we've all been there (maybe even as recently as last weekend) so I won't bore you with those details.\\n\\nAnyways, we went on a Monday night around 8p and I was surprised at how many large parties were seated in the dining area.  In my experience, chinese food is synonymous with takeout/delivery so the patronage alone was a sign of good things to come.  However don't get this statement confused with an endorsement of fine dining - the booth cushions are ripped and the waitstaff is only present when they pressure you to order (immediately upon being seated) and again when they rush you to pay.  I personally had no issue with the \\"prompt\\" service, maybe it's because I'm millenial trash and have been poisoned by social media where instant gratification is supreme.\\n\\nI started off with a Heineken, while my gf stuck with water.  As I mentioned previously, you only have two opportunities to interact with the waitstaff so don't plan on getting a buzz unless you're Tim Tebow.  For food we ordered the tidbit platter (combo plate consisting of four apps of your choosing), salt and pepper squid, scallops with veggies, and beef chow fun.  Our tidbit platter consisted of crab rangoon, boneless ribs, wings, and chicken teriyaki.  The tidbit platter and beef chow fun were both average, nothing more to report on these items.\\n\\nSo the main reason we (my gf) came here was for the salt and pepper squid.  My gf brought me here to sit and watch her take the plate to the face, or more accurately to help hide her gluttony from the world.  I'm not a big squid fan but I will admit that I ate more than one piece.  The scallops and veggies were brought out in cast-iron dish that may have been a Chili's hand-me-down.  The inclusion of onions and red/green peppers were reminiscent of a Chili's fajita (prounounced fuh-jai-tah for all my immature readers), but mixed decently enough with the sauce for a pretty standard experience.  Probably over a pound of scallops for $9.95 gets an up-vote from me, and the scallops were decently-sized so you can rest easy that no baby scallops were robbed from their shells."},{"name":"J Liu Restaurant & Bar","address":"6880 N High St","city":"Worthington","stars":"3","text":"Need to add more cheese to the blue cheese chips but happy hour martinis are $5.

Usually comes with bacon, which we asked them to hold. Tomatoes were fried really nicely. \\n\\nSalmon chips- this is a flaked salmon which is usually not as good, but this is ended up being one of my favorite variations on the smoked salmon brunch option. Chipotle cream gives it a little kick and the pita chips add a nice crunch. \\n\\nBreakfast potatoes - I would go back for these. Get a side order. Eat them as soon as they come out. They are divine. \\n\\nGrits - perfectly cooked. Gouda is a nice addition. \\n\\nDrinks: brunch so we had to wait until 12.30.

The easy fix is to request a table without the benches when you make a reservation, but we didn't know until we got there about the seating. \\nThe doors to the bathrooms don't lock properly. This matters less if you go into a single sex bathroom. At Two there is a corridor with 4-5 unisex bathrooms. So, men and women are mingling outside the doors. While I was in there, someone opened the door. I double checked it. As I was washing my hands, someone else opened the door.

If you like food described as \\"fusion\\" then this is the place for you. The word fusion at Poor Calvin's means experimentally bad Thai food.  I have traveled extensively and have had the opportunity to experience some really good Thai and creatively prepared fusion food...Poor Calvin's is not in that category.  I wanted my niece and nephew to experience the joy of eating great ethnic food, so while visiting from out of town, I wanted to treat them to the experience of good Thai food. I read the great reviews on Yelp and thought this place would fit the bill. I ordered the pad thai with soft shell crabs.  While the noodles were fresh and home made nothing else about the dish was appealing or appetizing. The pad thai arrived with two heavily battered soft shell crabs topping a pile of homemade noodles. The typical garnish of crushed peanuts was instead whole peanuts sprinkled over the noodles.  The heavily battered crabs were inedible.  Anybody who knows anything about soft shells knows they have to be delicately cooked almost tempura style.  Chef please take note of how soft shells should be prepared and cooked - I had prefectly cooked soft shells at Papadeux's the next night.  The two stars are because my niece had the lobster rice which she really liked and my nephew had crispy beef which he liked. Again, what should have been delicately cooked, the lobster tail atop the rice was heavily battered and fried, but my niece didn't seem to mind. And, personally, the crispy beef was too oily for me, I have had better crispy beef at Vietnamese restaurants.  Large portions are no substitute for good tasting food.

The server said they had a couple of kids dishes- chicken tenders + fries or shrimp fried rice. Both dishes were very tasty, but we should have gotten one and let the kiddos share it. Our 6 yr old daughter especially enjoyed the fried rice despite the fact that she left out most of the veggies. The cost was $14 each - which would have been ok except they didn't come with drinks or dessert. It wouldn't be hard to add a scoop of ice cream and a small cookie or two, plus it would encourage the parents to get dessert as well. But then, maybe encouraging parents to bring kids isn't the goal, which is ok too. Kids don't need to be everywhere. \\n\\nWe started with the chicken + pork dumplings: easily some of the best we've ever had. We have eaten A LOT of authentic Chinese dumplings - these had nicely done thin wrappers and were perfectly steamed. We highly recommend the dumplings!

Yes, it was THAT BAD. I can understand that they have a $24 minimum/person if you want to sit, but I'm a little less understanding when I have 15 friends who are buying drinks and dessert at the bar and half of the dining room/lounge area is empty, and they still insist that we spend $24 on top of what we paid for at the bar just to sit. What is even more completely and utterly unacceptable is how rude they are about this. \\n\\nThere was literally a man following us around, first telling us we can't sit down on a sofa even though nobody is there b/c of the $24/limit. When we were standing, he then comes up to us and says \\"I dont mean to be a prick but you need to move. You're crowding the live music area.\\"  I would expect a lot more from a place like this and using that language is absolutely unacceptable.   I then say I'd like to talk to the manager and he says, \\"fine, I'll get him.\\" The manager never shows up so I ask him where he is and he points to the manager across the room - making me then go and hound down the manager myself. Later on that night, the manager finally lets 3 of us sit down on a sofa in the lounge that happens to open up and the waitress immediately comes and says \\"you can't sit there, you have to spend $24 each.\\" When I tell her the mgr said we could, she then says without skipping a beat, \\"fine, then give me the cookies. you can't have food on the sofas.\\" At that point, I couldn't take it anymore - the tone was so competely unacceptable, especially given the significant amount of money we had spent on drinks and dessert, that I went and talked to a second manager. The manager finally said we could have a table, but at that point all of my friends were tired from standing around for an hour that they all wanted to go home.\\n\\nTop of the Hub - if you had let us sit at one of your many empty tables to begin with, I guarantee we would have stayed longer, which means more money spent on food and drinks, and 20 happy customers who would leave with a great impression and come back. Instead, we all only ordered 1 drink, and I guarantee NONE of us will be going back, On top of that, I am so appalled that  I feel compelled to write this long negative review to warn other consumers to think twice about going.  It is time you trained your staff to learn to speak to customers in an appropriate tone and manner, and to learn what most nice establishments have mastered long ago - to place the customer first."},{"name":"Andina Restaurant","address":"1314 NW Glisan St","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"Andina, light of my life, fire of my loins.

I actually think it would be great if they opted to bring the cinnamon rolls out at the end with a cream cheese frosting for dipping. WOW that would be a gamechanger. \\n\\nOur food all came out very quickly. You can tell the wait staff and cooks here don't mess around! I was just done with my salad when our food came out. I really enjoyed the house salad. The chicken tenders were good. Lightly breaded and they come with honey mustard for dipping. I don't typically even like honey mustard, but I found myself using the entire container of it! The fries were also good, but I feel like they didn't give me enough. The Mac & Cheese was a big NO. I took one bite and hated it. It had some type of like casserole cooked into it. I couldn't tell what it was, but I didn't make it more than one bite. \\n\\nFor dessert, there were so many yummy looking options. I couldn't choose between the peanut butter pie or the peach cobbler. I asked Evie to show me the peanut butter pie and she brought one out. It looked good, but I ended up going for the peach cobbler....that's not a dessert that you can get everywhere! I did enjoy the cobbler. Would have been better with a yummy scoop of ice cream on top.\\n\\nWe ended up staying there for almost 4 hours total just talking. We saw so many tables turning around us. This place was very busy the entire time. As we headed out, we went into the restroom. It wasn't that clean and had a bad smell to it. I recommend that they do a remodel on those if at all possible. \\n\\nAll told, an enjoyable experience for an out-of-towner like me. I would certainly recommend this as a place to go when in ATL!"},{"name":"Alchemy Caf√©","address":"625 Parsons Ave","city":"Columbus","stars":"4.5","text":"Had the peanut butter smoothie and Dijon Turkey sandwich.

I took my niece there for lunch and we both had pretty mediocre food. The turkey burger I had (a specialty of theirs) was over seasoned. I gave my niece a quarter of the burger and by the time I finished the rest, all I could taste was sodium. My tongue was actually numb afterward. My niece had the grilled chicken sandwich which was swallowed by the bun. \\n\\nI was splurging by getting fries, but couldn't enjoy them, because they tasted like fish that wasn't very fresh when it was fried.  Either the fries were cooked in the same oil as fish or they came in contact with uncooked (not so fresh) fish. The though of either was gross. We mentioned this to the server, who was nice, and she said they don't cook fries in the same oil as fish, and that she would ask. She never came back to say different, which in my book suggest there was something fishy other than those fries.  Did I mention that the distinct fishy taste on bothe fries I and my neice tasted was something I couldn't get out of my mind.  \\n\\nSo, despite the experience, I paid the bill in full and left a tip (it's not the server's fault the food sucked).  In my book this is like a break-up. I'm dissatisfied and the business does not want to address the issue or acknowledge what they likely did wrong.  These are irreconcilable differences and we must part ways. This is unfortuante because I wanted to see this business succeed and they about to open another location.

After some more time had passed while I was trying to help my son to NOT STOP BREATHING while I performed methods to help dislodge the fish bone, needless to say, and thankful to God, I was able to help my son and prevent him from choking any longer before the paramedics came. \\n\\nThis review is about the type of business owner that runs this place. After I helped me son, I attempted to talk to the waitress at the front desk and I asked her was the manager there. Then this man, whom didn't introduce himself to me, spoke up. He told me no the manager wasn't there. I asked him who was he since he didn't give me an introduction. He told me that he was a family friend, and he gave me his name. *During my frightening ordeal, I saw this guy come in from outside, but I thought that maybe he was just a patron.* Turns out, he says, he works next door at the mechanics shop. (The waitress inside called him over apparently.) \\n\\nSo in speaking to the man, I asked him was the owner there? He tells me no, but that if I gave him my name and number, she would return a call to me. This man did apologized for what happened with my son and he expressed that he was glad that he was fine now. I left out and waited for the manager to call...\\n\\n10/10/2017-It was now around 2:00 pm, and I hadn't received a call from the restaurant manager, and so I called the store to see was she there. She was not, and the young girl who answered the phone wasn't there on yesterday, but she put me on hold to try to find out what was going on. I told her a little snippet of what happened and she came back to the phone to tell me that Ms. Rosie (the store manager) had been to the restaurant within that hour, and that she had my number and that I would hear from her shortly. \\n\\nNow mind you I was told that on yesterday I would hear from her by Charles. Ms. Rosie told me that she had been on vacation, but had heard about what happened. She didn't call me back until AFTER I called the restaurant to see was she there. Before I called on today, I'm thinking to myself how tacky this manager is for not calling on yesterday since an emergency had happened in her restaurant with one of her guests. I personally don't care that she was on vacation, priority is making sure that your store is run properly.\\n\\nI was told by a waitress there (not my waitress because I didn't see her) that there were no bones in the fish (perch). When I spoke to Ms. Rosie about the fish and putting a disclaimer on her menu about possibly bones being in it, she told me that she didn't know if her suppliers would validate that because perch \\"typically doesn't have bones in it.\\" WELL THAT PERCH DID AND MY SON (Who is two) WAS CHOKING ON IT! \\n\\nAnd the staff just watched as I was frantically trying to give aid to my son. I saw the cook even peep his head through the windows or the kitchen door while all of the excitement was going on, but neither did he come from the back. I explained this to Ms. Rosie and she didn't address her staff not knowing what to do when someone is choking.\\n\\nMs. Rosie even tried to make me feel STUPID because I let my son eat fish by saying, \\"OK and you ordered fish for a two year old\\"? That is not the point and I told her that to not get away from what happened. \\n\\nMs. Rosie herself at the end of our conversation said that she was glad that my son was OK, but STILL did not address the character of her staff members. \\n\\nMind you people can have this type of accident happen at any given moment in their life, but when it happens at a restaurant, I think more should have been done instead of being stared at like a side show act from her staff, and I should not have had to reach out to the owner in order to talk to her. She should have reached out to me on yesterday. \\n\\nGo here if you want, but if you choke, you're on your own. What if you're by yourself?

Omg omg omg. This place is BOMB. Stumbled upon this place with friends after a day trip to Boston. Did not know this was a chain and had not heard of it before.... The vibe is great, they fit a party of 10 on one table easily. We did call in beforehand to make sure they could do this. \\n\\nThe food is drool worthy you guys. I love ramen, and I was not disappointed. The spicy miso ramen was delicious - the broth had depth of flavor and had the perfect amount of heat to keep you coming back for more. Some people think that it's too salty but I loved it as it was. I tried my friend's shio ramen and again the broth was fantastic. There is also a vegetarian ramen, which is wonderfully nutty in flavor; my friend who got it loved it. The broths are what make a good ramen, and they were all on point!!! Not to mention, the noodles had a perfect texture, the right amount of softness while still holding its bite to give you the perfect amount of chewiness.\\n\\nWhat you HAVE TO GET is the salmon bowl with the roe! You can get it as a combo with the soft-boiled egg and one of the ramen bowls! The salmon bowl was perfect in every way; the rice underneath was seasoned itself, and the roe provided those pops of accentuated saltiness to make your mouth water even more. The soft boiled egg is always a great addition, though I will say it's a little more on the hard-boiled spectrum (wish that yolk had been a bit runnier). All in all, this place gave me the ramen fix I've been craving since I've visited Japan! I am so pleased to have visited Santouka Ramen and plan on coming back soon.

Last night I finally had a reason to visit; a birthday dinner. Upon arrival, I was immediately frustrated becaused the parking lot which holds about 10 cars was full and it was unclear where I could park without getting towed. I circled the block twice until I saw someone park on the street and because they seemed confident in where they parked, I did the same. \\n\\nThe layout of the restaurant is strange. Once you walk through the door there is a bar to the left and a few tables to the left and right of it.  The tables seemed a little cramped in it's space but the people seemed to be happy. Actually, all the staff and customers seemed to be in a great mood; nothing but smiles all around. This spoke volumes to me and I knew I was in for a great experience.  \\n\\nI guess I had a confused look on my face because the hostess asked if I was looking for a party, I said Yes and she advised it was around the corner and down. After passing the kitchen, I saw the area. Now, the main dining area is totally different (look and feel) from the front of the house. It is romantic, dim; great for a date night. \\n\\nI ordered the seafood spring rolls as appetizer which was delicious!  (Didn't take a pic because I was starving). Someone else order the lobster mac & cheese.  I didn't try it but everyone said it was great. I ordered the Autumn's Ray signature coctail which was devine and enjoyed that with my appetizer. For my entree,  I ordered the lobster fried rice and I ordered the chicken thai curry to go. Let me say that the lobster fried rice was scrumptious!  Someone else had the Lamb dish and everyone else had the special (fish, grit cake, etc) and everyone loved their food. \\n\\nBesides the parking, the only other hiccup for me was the billing. I've never been billed a food and wine tax before other than on a cruise ship or outside the united states. That was weird to see on the bill. Also, I used a 10% off coupon from yelp and they only applied it to the main dish. Usually when I use these coupons, they are applied to the entire bill minus the alcohol. \\n\\nHonestly,  none of the hiccups ruined my experience or will prevent me from going back.  I highly recommended this restaurant for a date or special occasion."},{"name":"Anchovies","address":"433 Columbus Ave","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"So awesome!!

The venue routinely treats musicians as disposable commodities, showing no respect for the artistry and dedication involved in performing authentic American music.

I parked on the street and wandered around until I finally saw a bunch of people walking out of a door to get their cars that were valeted.  Still not seeing the entrance, I finally asked a woman for the entrance and she pointed to a discreet door by the valet and where the cars were pulling up.  If you're going to have a restaurant that seats 200 people, better signage is key! \\n\\nMy friends were waiting for me at the bar.  Which bar?  There are two giant island bars in the middle of the restaurant.  I walked around both until I finally saw my two friends.  And it was hard finding them, mostly because this is a dark dungey? (dungeon) restaurant.  For ambiance they are aiming for dimly lit, 'cool' atmosphere which is not in execution because you can barely make eye contact with your friends.  And speaking of contact, forget about having a conversation. The main dining room has live music playing so you can't hear any one, especially the music.  \\n\\nOur reservation was for 8 and three of us arrived at 8 to which we were told we can't be seated until our entire party was here.  Our friend arrived at 8:15 and they didn't have our table ready yet.  Finally at 8:20'ish, we were seated upstairs on a corner table.  One of our friends wasn't even able to sit properly with her chair by the table, that's how off she was from the square table.  I called bull shit on that and told the manager to resit us.  We were promptly seated at a downstairs table with couch seating, better than upstairs.  \\n\\nFor food and drinks we ordered a salmon chips appetizer and calamari.  For dinner I ordered the tuna poke (from appetizer menu).  For drinks I got the Rose Sangria drink.  The poke was the only memorable thing on the table.  The bread served on the house reminisced of fried pizza dough and tasted decent. The calamari was definitely overdone.  The salmon was okay.  My drink was weak, I couldn't taste any alcohol.  Our server was a wonderful guy that was friendly and did his best to keep up with all the tables he had.  On occasion another server asked for drinks or dessert order so I believed we had two servers but can't say.  They were both nice and answered questions with what we agreed was honesty. \\n\\nOverall I thought Two Urban Licks was just okay. This is the place if you want to be in a 'fun' part of the city and tell others you went to a cool restaurant.  Otherwise if you're looking for actually good food with distinctive menu and a place to have a conversation with your date or friends, this isn't it!  It's dark, loud, offers okay food and lack of entrance signs makes it not worth my Saturday (or any) evening.  Will the tuna poke drive me to come back?  Definitely not! \\n\\nMy friends said Valet parking was a mess with long lines so I can't speak for that but street parking was readily available, however not advisable if you have no idea where you're going."},{"name":"Voodoo Doughnut - Old Town","address":"22 SW 3rd Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"A friend told us we had to visit and he was right.

This kind of smushed all the toppings and didn't give me a good photo op, but that's fine.\\n\\nUpon first look the nachos looked great, with guacamole, corn and black beans, grape tomatoes, seitan chorizo, and a vegan sour cream, but when I dug in I noticed that all the chips under the toppings were crushed. I don't think I had one piece that was a full sized piece, unfortunately. Additionally, as I kept eating there was a clearly unbalanced chip to topping ratio. I finished about 1/3 of the bowl and 2/3 of the chips were left with no more toppings.\\n\\nThe guac is very acidic, probably because they use a lot of lime to prevent it from browning, and the other toppings were just okay, not very flavorful.\\n\\nOnce I finished the 1/3, I tossed the rest of the baked chips.

We had a marvelous time. There were six in our party; we had a reservation for 6:00 pm. We were seated on entering and in short order our server (super pro, as expected) took our drink order. We had two Makers Manhattans, two Four Roses bourbons on-the-rocks, and a Hub Punch. The Manhattan was excellent, the bourbons on-the-rocks were solid pours, and the Hub Punch was presented beautifully in a glass flask-like bottle, a deep mango-yellow coloring, poured into a rocks glass and garnished with, I think, mint. It was an impressive look. Soon after the drinks arrived we were served warm, fresh Parker House rolls then we followed with appetizers of baked clams and saut√©ed sea scallops. I had a couple of the former, they were tasty; I didn't try the latter, but those in our party who did were extremely complimentary. We all had steaks for our entrees, and a variety of sides (Brussels, saut√©ed spinach, etc.). The steak was the star of the meal. I had a perfectly prepared 8 oz. filet mignon--perfectly seasoned, excellent char on the outside, cooked medium, tender and delicious! We were all pleased with our choices. The Bancroft has a very solid wine list, and we paired our meal with a nicely complementary Willamette Valley pinot noir. We finished up with coffee, tea, and dessert. All of which were top-notch. The Bancroft is an elegant joint. Despite its contemporary decor it gives off an old-school steak house vibe with its dark wood, small, rich touches of color, and stylish lighting. It's inviting, the staff is welcoming, the food is exceptional. There's much to recommend with The Bancroft."},{"name":"The Chateau","address":"535 John Mahar Hwy","city":"Braintree","stars":"2.5","text":"How can an Italian restaurant not know how to make Alfredo sauce.

I think it's a bit pretentious for my lowly self. That being said, my grandfather wanted to go to Hamilton's Kitchen for brunch so we joined him. It was a celebration of sorts so I guess it made sense to eat at a fancy WP restaurant. I will say I was pleasantly surprised, it didn't feel NEARLY as pretentious as I thought it would be. I almost felt as though we fit in.....except I'm in my 30s and most people there were in their 70s. The restaurant itself is nice, it's stylish but not over the top. It wasn't super duper busy which was nice on a Sunday at 10:30am. We sat inside but there's a nice outside patio area as well. Maybe I'll try that next time we come. My only minor complaint which is super insignificant and more related to my heels and my pregnancy (I've been a bit more unsteady on my feet lately) is that the bathrooms are a bit of a walk through the lounge from the restaurant. But, there's some cool artwork on the wall so that made it a little less bad AND the floor length girl's bathroom mirror was oddly slimming so I spent some time feeling skinny before I left to go finish eating. \\n\\nSo the food - my mom and I split French toast and each got sides of grits. I also got eggs and fruit (trying for a well balanced meal). Everything was great. The vanilla bean whipped cream on the local bread French toast was delicious and they gave us a little jar of real maple syrup, nice touch. The grits were delicious. I like, but don't love grits that aren't Gouda grits, these were great on their own and I would currently like to eat more of them. My cousin got The Hamlet which is an omelet with ham (haha) and she really enjoyed it. BF got the Brunch Burger with cheesy truffle fries. He said the burger was delicious and those fries were freaking good - they were thinish cut with the right amount of truffle and cheese....yum. Grandpa got the eggs/meat/toast breakfast plate with a br√ªl√©ed grapefruit...he's 92 so he didn't really comment on his meal. We ordered butterscotch pudding and creme br√ªl√©e for dessert and both were delicious. \\n\\nOur server was strange. Not bad, just strange. He was present the right amount of time and left us alone the right amount of time. That's about all I've got to say about him.\\n\\nAll in all, I'm not sure at all why I never came here to eat brunch.

Beer can also be ordered at the bar. \\n\\nI started with a local beer that was on tap. For a casual restaurant $7.50- $8 for ap int of beer is a bit steep but I can see them justifying the cost on the restaurant's location. Once my friend arrived, I chose the Apache burger, single, and asked the host to give me recommendation for a side between sweet potato fries and crinkle cut. She said sweet potato fries, without a doubt. With raving review like that, I chose sweet potato fries. \\nThe inside of the place is casual with booths and tables with chairs. There is outdoor seating, for nice fall days to sit in covered area. We chose a table with chairs inside. \\n\\nOur food came out fast with a food runner. After the first bite of the burger, I realized it wasn't my favorite style. I wasn't a fan of lettuce with green chilies and grilled onions. The burger itself was rather bland because it wasn't salted. The house sauce that I asked for to eat with the fries was also just okay. Unfortunately the biggest disappointment were the fries, the sweet potato fries were clearly previously cooked and barely reheated for my order. They were limp, luke warm to touch and oily. Overall just an average meal experience. \\n\\nThe service is friendly and accommodating. When I asked the food runner for mayo for the burger, he quickly got it for me.

The other night, they gave away my pizza to someone else and never bothered to see me waiting for my food. They had to remake my order. Recently, a new staffer gave me a side salad of just lettuce. It was a bowl of lettuce (no tomatoes, cucumbers, etc.).  They seem to have dropped their delicious balsamic vinaigrette dressing for a lot of unhealthier versions. I still do like the pizza. The crust is soft and chewy and a personal is a good size to not overindulge.

Don't come out in a durag and shoes that a flopping all over the place. Secondly, if you don't know how to operate something that your company has implemented to make service better that's a problem. I used the app to order ahead so that my food could be ready when I arrived. I have a little one who was enjoying the ride on his way to sleep. When I got there I informed them that the app wasn't working correctly or me to check in but I'd already paid. The representative told me I HAD to use the app. Did she not just hear what I said! So I had to turn my phone off then back on again to get the app to function correctly. I was finally able to check in yet I still had to wait 5-8 minutes to receive my food. My little one is losing his patience as well. They finally bring me my order coney dog, corn dog and large tots but my drink is missing! The sloppy looking representative says our slushie machine is down so if you want a refund you have to do it through the app and walks off! I'm applaud. This is the reason I chose Sonic over another fast food stop. I then ask another friendly representative well can I get a drink since it's the same price to which she says the fountain drink machine is down as well. You've got to be kidding me right. So I ask her well can you show me how to receive a refund from the app. She doesn't know how so she goes in to ask someone and no one knows how so they tell me to call a 1800 number located on the bottom of the receipt. *face palm* at this point I'm frustrated and so is my son.

They've finally thrown open their doors to the public, with a bar, restaurant, and patio connected to their cellar now. Actually, it's been a few years, but for far longer it seemed like HOTD were just this tiny secret tucked away in a nondescript corner of Portland. Now they're down near the river (and the trains), pulling in all sorts of beer lovers all day and all night. \\nHOTD has stood out for years making beers well-suited for aging. Many of their beers improve for years in the bottle. Beer cellaring has become more widely understood in the last few years, but it's still a fraction of 1% of all beers that consistently improve with age. HOTD makes several of them, and has cranked them out with great consistency for two decades. This is an enormous testament to Alan's skill and craftsmanship as a brewer. And he used to do absolutely everything himself! Yeah, he has a staff now, but primarily to run the restaurant side of things. He's still the man in the brewhouse, unlike many brewmasters whose schedules are overtaken with meetings and appearances as their empires broaden.\\nAlan, by contrast, took a moment to lend his creative thinking and ideals to the kitchen, and now the staff there runs with that. Meanwhile, he's still making a lineup of high-alcohol ales that serve beautifully and often cellar even better than they serve when fresh. He has single-handedly revived at least one old-world style that had been ignored even in the old world (adambier), and pushed forward many interpretations of german, Belgian, and UK styles. He's especially known for aging many of his beers in oak barrels, with great success.\\nWhat this means when you get to the pub is that you have a whole page of various vintages of interesting high-test ales to try. Some are expensive, some are very old. All are good, many are great. The tap list covers current offerings--there's usually a great IPA (Blue Dot), some experimental stuff, and some more-familiar styles. We had a fresh scotch ale and a fresh heller bock, which were both excellent (HOTD's first lager!). \\nThe food is also exceptional, and amazingly cheap. Without a doubt the most value of anything we ate in Portland this weekend. Among the ~10 of us over two long visits, we had head cheese (wonderfully rich and balanced), mac and cheese every possible way, short rib chili on a brisket sandwich, smoking hot duck wings, sour cream pie, cheese plates, charcuterie plates, and probably a couple other things. I'd order every single thing again. 99% of the ingredients are local, the bread is spectacularly dense and chewy, the meats are all of very high quality, and everything is prepared and served by people who care. \\nThe fact that most of the entrees are in the $8-$10 range is almost a head-scratcher, given what other places charge for food that's half as good. The staff are funny and friendly and nice, and we absolutely had a ball. Every time I am in town, I will be here, and I will often toast their excellence from afar.

The service at one point was fast, friendly and they got your order correct. However, something has changed over the last 6-7 months. There were several Hispanic ladies who used to work in the morning, they were nice and efficient and cared about your order. That has changed unfortunately.  They hired an entirely new morning crew with very low intelligence and poor customer service skills. Instead of being greeted by someone who is generally cheerful, you are greeted by a woman named Melissa who mushes  her words together, and makes it quite obvious that she doesn't give a crap that you are there. She's hard to understand and is unfriendly. It's obvious that you're bothering her by showing up in the drive thru, and that she has to take your order. There is also an African American man who addresses you as \\"sweetheart or sweetie\\" instead of \\"Ma'am\\". Totally professional, right? The morning service is slow and they rarely get your order right. The coffee is totally inconsistent. You can order the same drink several days in a row and it will never taste the same. It's very frustrating and feels like such a waste of money. I've overlooked the poor service for awhile now, but today I have reached my breaking point. I ordered my drink and a box of TimBits. I had a coupon and forgot to mention it while I was ordering. I pulled up to the window, handed Melissa my coupon and card. She rudely says \\"You didn't tell me you had a coupon\\".  I apologized for the inconvenience. She acted as if it was a huge problem to apply the coupon. These coupons were mailed to everyone! The exact coupons they should be ready to take when a customer presents it at the point of sale. It shouldn't be a problem, but it was for them today apparently. I took my food and left the drive thru,  feeling horrible because of the way I was treated. I will never return to this location. It's incredibly obvious that they don't give a shit about their customers. I understand that it's busy in the morning and that customer service can be tiring, but there's no reason to let your customers leave feeling horrible.

Something's amiss with the proofing/proving. When I throw carb-counting out the window with pizza, I like to eat it ALL. In this case, I gave my crusts to the dogs.\\n2. Honey Pear (large)\\nA unique combo. Toppings are high quality. Bit disappointed at how little prosciutto ham there was (see my pic: you can easily count them. The # on this large is comparable to the # on another person's pic of a small). Got 1/2 without the pears & subbed in artisan sausage for the hubby, but he was still weirded out by the honey sweetness. But that's just a matter of taste; no deduction for that. I enjoyed the combo.\\n3. Pepperoni pizza (large)\\nKids continually commented on how salty it was. 1 said, \\"mom, I think they make it that way on purpose because the crust doesn't have any taste.\\" The other said, \\"if you take their pepperoni and a less-salty version of their sauce then put it on Pizza Hut's crust, then it would be really good.\\" (Um, sorry - Out of the mouths of babes!)\\n4.

The service has improved every time that we've been, the atmosphere is so cool and we really love the outdoor area.  I will say the interior table and chairs are extremely uncomfortable so thank God there is booths and patio seating as an alternative.  The drink specials are ok and the variety is nice.  The part that seems to fall short is the food.  We ordered the buffaloed cauliflower and it was pretty much raw drenched in minced garlic, not really anything special.  My husband had the burger one time and it was disappointing.  Also, the fried pickles were horrible, the breading didn't stay on and they were very soggy. We also ordered the wings every time and have tried a variety of sauces. I actually like dry wings and really felt like for fact that they weren't deep fried they were impressively crispy.  We are healthy eaters so we are willing to overlook and judge fairly that the wings just don't taste good.  My husband and I both agreed that it has like a plain baked chicken taste that really needs to be seasoned , even drenched in sauce and slathered in blue cheese dressing we could shake that under seasoned chicken taste.  Can we suggest to the owners that using a brine or marinade for the wings might be an option?  We are both retired chefs and have used the \\"turbo chef \\"style ovens in the past.  It might just be worth it to try seeing that no one is overall impressed with the taste.  I really don't mean to be over critical, we honestly really want this place to succeed and believe in the healthy food movement!!

It's a beautiful place in a trendy part of town with a cool menu of weird stuff that you don't see at many local restaurants.  I wish there were more seafood places here in Atlanta as it is nearly impossible to get a decent grouper filet without going to the Gulf coast. \\nThat being said, this place could use some work.  We arrived at 7:05 on a Wednesday night with a reservation. We were seated at what was a pretty good table except that our only view was the back of some really tall curtain.  The booth took a great deal of effort to get into as it was a semi-circle that required you to slide about 4 feet across a leatherette seat. By the time you got to your place, your clothes were all twisted around your body and it was pretty uncomfortable to move around.  What we could see of the decor, around the stage curtain blocking our view, was quite beautiful. \\nWe ordered 3 appetizers and two entrees. We were concerned that maybe we ordered too much food but upon arrival of the first microscopic portions , 53 minutes after we were seated, our fear was relieved.  \\nBy the time anything edible showed up at the table we were preparing to EAT the table.  Im not sure how a half full restaurant takes almost an hour to bring out the very first dish of a 5 dish order but maybe this is the cool new trend?   \\nShe Crab soup...ehh, uneventful.  The Simple Salad was pretty good.  Another 20 minutes went by before the tuna poke and tuna crudo arrived and although tasty and well prepared,  they contained about 4 bites in each dish. That disappeared in about 3 minutes as we were seriously considering ordering some pizza delivery to get us through to the next dish. \\n25 minutes later, seriously! 25 minutes later, our tuna and mahi-mahi arrived, well actually just one mahi showed up as surely the other tiny mahi must have been left in the kitchen.  $36 for a 4 inch piece of fish? \\nThe Mahi was flavorful and well prepared, the tuna was again, uneventful.  \\nOur server was very friendly and I could tell she wanted to do something more for us as it was apparent that everyone in the room was starving and I think some people were actually dozing off waiting for food.  \\nThey brought around these little plates containing two rolls at various times to different tables to prevent the servers from being eaten by ravenous customers.\\nAll of this extra time to examine the details also allowed us to notice that on 4 different occasions someone came and stood right behind my wife, within about 2 feet of her, and got out an iPad and recorded the status of all the tables.  It was very intrusive in my opinion and somewhat of a distraction to our begging for food from the passersby.  These people could probably have been put to better use in the kitchen perhaps doing some motivational cheers or something to get the food out faster. \\nAll in all, we spent $130 on food alone, no alcohol, and it was seriously almost 2 hours before our entrees arrived with about 20-25 minutes between each portion of the meal.  Something must have been off in the kitchen because there is no way that this could be the normal routine there.  I only wish I had Gordon Ramsey on speed dial as I could just see him back in the kitchen yelling at a bunch of dysfunctional hipsters arguing over who prepared the kale salad better while the customers starved. \\nYou would think that the putt-putt golf course in the front was cool until you realize that it is probably there to keep people from cannibalizing each other while waiting for food. \\n\\nGive it some time, if they are still in business after 6 months, maybe try it."},{"name":"Sun Tong Luck Asian Cuisine","address":"2500 Bethel Rd","city":"Columbus","stars":"4","text":"Muy buen servicio y r√°pido no tengo el gusto de conocer el lugar , solo hemos ordenado para llevar a casa muy rica la comida que hemos ordenado , muy recomendable"},{"name":"Pine Garden Chinese Cuisine","address":"429 N Alafaya Trl","city":"Orlando","stars":"3","text":"We visited the area and stopped at Pine Garden for Lunch.

Wearing gloves is not an imposition, it's the law. \\nPlease come back and try us again in Hingham as our COH store is undergoing renovations. \\n\\nSincerely, \\nBrian Murphy\\nLido Juice"},{"name":"China Dragon","address":"798 Ponce De Leon Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3","text":"This place is a hit or miss. I wanted Chinese food so my daughter recommended China Dragon. I had the \\"family meal\\" General Tso chicken with fried rice, Wonton soup and an egg roll. The dish was spicy  like I like. However the chicken I did have was fried hard which made it difficult to eat. There were also more fried flour pieces than chicken. The soup was not good at all and the egg roll was fine. I decided against my better judgment to give them another try. I ordered the General Tso with white rice this time. The pieces of chicken were a bit more edible, but there were those fried flour pieces again. Thanks China Dragon but no thanks.

Very sad...\\n\\nFor parking they have a small valet lot and limited street parking nearby.  Honestly, wouldn't feel safe parking far from the restaurant.\\n\\nRestaurant itself was very small and a bit closed concept where there was a bit of balcony seating bar area through the actual kitchen to the main dining area.  Capacity stated around 75, which is quite small and the health department score was a C, which was not very good.\\n\\nService was fine, we ordered our meals and refilled our waters frequently.  Food, however, was meh aside from the chicken and lobster mac n cheese.  But I must ask, how is this an Asian fusion dish?!  \\n\\nOthers ordered the crispy beef, which was inconsistent with my fianc√©'s dish completely smothered in spice that I couldn't believe he actually ate it and had no stomach ache and my friend's dish that was not spicy what so ever.  Maybe a spicy level caution would have been nice.\\n\\nSome of the other items such as coconut shrimp and steamed dumplings were fine, just nothing out of the ordinary.  Fried calamari, however, was over cooked and dry and the lobster fried rice was too salty.  To end it all, the cakes tasted like cakes that you buy frozen and were not fully dethawed.  Not impressed at all and felt awful that I had brought my friends for a bad experience."},{"name":"Voodoo Doughnut - Old Town","address":"22 SW 3rd Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"If the length is daunting, see the \\"Too Long; Didn't Read\\" segment below :3 \\n\\nI hate feeling like a tourist when I visit new cities. Everyone knows about Voodoo Doughnuts, and the only reason we actually stopped in was because: \\nA. We ended up right down the street,   \\nB. The line was unusually short, and \\nC. To say that we did it, and tried it. \\n\\nI wouldn't say I'm a donut person. I have about 1.25 every year or so. So I thought this would be the perfect time to get that \\"1\\" part of the donut in, to almost reach my quota for the year. \\n\\nHere are my thoughts about voodoo:\\n\\n-The line is apparently very long, and it's only once you reach the front door that you see the sign that they take \\"Cash Only\\". Maybe this is a well known thing, but it was unknown to my friend and me, so thankfully he had some cash to pay. I feel like this is something that could be advertised, or said earlier.... while you're waiting in line. \\n\\n-I feel like it would be beneficial if there were a menu along the side of the building where everyone has to stand at one point.  There is not nearly enough time to get in through the door, and look at the menu to decide what you want before you're at the register.    Make the infamous long line exciting! Like a Disneyland ride! Give me stuff to read and look at, and pictures/sayings/insights to enhance my cravings for donuts!   Otherwise, once you make it to the inside of the building, it's extremely overwhelming trying to look at the very clustered menu, or the endlessly spinning racks of donuts... I suggest not even trying to understand the menu. Get an idea of a donut you want from the spinning racks. \\n\\n-The donuts are a lot cheaper than you imagine!! I was seriously thinking one would be close to $5 or so, but the majority are in the 1-2 $ range, with even some .95 ones. That's awesome! But don't get too crazy with buying a dozen donuts until you read my next point...\\n\\n-These donuts are [underlined, bolded and italicized:] EXTREMELY SWEET. We decided to get 2 of them to try different options [We got the Chuckles, and the Dirty Ol' Bastard], and we pulled them into halves. I couldn't even finish mine. I was so sugar shocked it wasn't funny. I felt the sugar all day in my back and my kidneys, and vowed never to consume sugars again [ha, like that lasted.] I suggest getting 1 donut and splitting it with a loved one. Or even someone you don't like. Feel good knowing that they will be just as uncomfortable and zapped with sugar as you are. \\n\\n-Voodoo is apparently open 24 hours a day... but it sounds like it's NOT a place you want to be around when it gets dark. When we asked the cashier if they had a plastic knife to cut our donuts in half, she replied saying that they do have have anything that can be made into a weapon, because it's a sketchy/dangerous part of town at night. So keep that in mind, wary travelers! Do not make late night donut runs, Portland stoners!\\n\\nOverall, at the end of the day, a donut is a doughnut. [Doughnut is a donut]. They had some creative and fun looking ones, but I do not think this will ever be a place I visit again. It was yummy, but it left me feeling so icky inside. I WAS sugar.  I mean, do it to do it. Because really... who can say no to a nicely priced donut?\\n\\nTL;DR:\\nVoodoo Doughnuts is known for their creative donuts and infamously long lines. Make sure you have cash in yo' wallet if you're hoping to get anything once you make it through the threshold. Decide what you want by looking at the spinning racks - don't waste your precious time with the very clustered, but fun-donut name menu.  The donuts will course so much sugar in your veins you'll wonder if you'll ever feel human again. Split one with someone, unless you really believe you can handle it, or if you get off on sugar shock. You do you, but you've been warned. Visit during daylight hours. No plastic knives. The pigeons don't like the donut icing. This place is probs better suited for NOLA."},{"name":"Union Oyster House","address":"41 Union St","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"Update: Food poisoning and a ruined trip day!!Original review: other than a friendly waitress & great cornbread, everything from the mangled raw oyster delivered as part of our half dozen to the cold /off steamed mussels (and immediate food poisoning) was dicey.

J got the double Dixie Style combo, and we got the hot dog kids meal (hot dog, fries, milk) for the little guy.

The pepper jack cheese, grilled, onions, and chiles just seems kinda juicy adding texture, but not flavor.  I had to add lots of mustard to enjoy it.  The fries were crispy on the outside, but nothing really special.  The highlight of the meal for me was definitely the Mexican chocolate shake... rich and spicy.

The cook was kind enough to ask if we needed anything so we ordered from him. The server was in the back talking to another employee our entire time there, she looked over occasionally but didn't bother to refill our cups. Once we were done, we waited ten minutes before another server with curly hair asked if we needed anything, I asked for the check and she never came back.

The Danish Pancakes are a MUST TRY. \\n\\n-1 star because.. \\n\\nThe wait was long. \\nExplanation: Partly because of the small space inside (they were not using the tables outside to seat guests) and partly because (as mentioned by several other Yelpers) the seating method used seemed a bit lax/disorganized.

Maybe there just weren't enough waiters- which totally makes sense. \\n\\nService was interesting (?)  \\nExplanation: The host was incredibly sweet and allowed us to choose our preference for seating! :-) We had been looking at the menu during our time waiting so we were ready and excited to try some yummy food!

We came late on a Thursday evening (with a reservation), and while we were seated relatively promptly, no one came by our table to provide us menus or even water for almost 10 minutes. We waited an equally long time before we were able to finally place our orders (drinks + food), and subsequently spent another 10 minutes waiting for our drinks (tap beer) to be brought to our table.\\n\\nI was equally unimpressed with the food. For all that UOH is an oyster house, they offer a grand selection of a total of 2 raw oysters, and even then our waitress struggled to recall where they were from. The shucking quality was subpar, and multiple oysters out of the dozen we ordered contained small pieces of oyster shell inside. Additionally, we ordered the Oyster House Clam Chowder, Bangkok Mussels, Seafood Newburg, and Lazy Man's Lobster. The clam chowder was creamy and smooth, but I felt like I could literally taste the butter and it was unfortunately served lukewarm. The mussels were delicious, but again served cold to lukewarm (the ones on the bottom still retained some measure of warmth). The Seafood Newburg was the biggest disappointment of the evening--there was very little seafood in comparison to the amount of rice that was plated and unfortunately the poorly executed creamy sherry sauce overwhelmed all other flavors in the dish. The lobster came in big meaty chunks (as it should for MKT price, which came out to $38) but was hidden under the driest, thickest layer of breadcrumbs I have ever seen.\\n\\nFor dessert, we ordered the Chocolate Lava Cake a la mode. The chocolate cake itself was baked in a Bundt pan and the \\"lava\\" ended up being a drizzle of chocolate over the cake instead of inside it. Even then, I enjoyed this most out of everything we ordered.\\n\\nOverall, this restaurant is the biggest tourist trap I have seen in all of Boston. I do not recommend at all unless you enjoy having your food served at room temperature.

The two guys working here were EXTREMELY knowledgeable on the games, and were able to give us some fun recommendations. Kingmakers specializes in modern games, but they have the classics too like Chutes and Ladders or Monopoly. We played a couple of rounds of a penguin strategy game and Coconuts Crazy Monkey, which is a super fun game where you have to launch little rubber coconuts into cups and try to steal cups from your opponent.

They are priced at approximately $4 each and they have lots of different flavors.

The egg, tofu bacon, and grilled veggies blended extremely well and each bit was full of flavor.  Get this, you will not be disappointed!\\n\\nBreakfast Tacos - the ren and the veggie chorizo (with egg and cheese).

Their stage was not yet operational but the potential for fun entertainment is definitely there in the future and we can't wait to check it out later! We already saw people holding birthday parties here which said a lot about comfort and ease for big gatherings.\\n\\nThe SERVICES:\\nThe service staff waiters and waitresses were exceptionally friendly and happily recommended to us what they felt as good food options to try on our first visit. They visited our table often enough thereafter to refill our water and check up on our needs while never once being pressuring for us to leave. They also smile often even while standing on the side waiting to service, a rare sight indeed!\\n\\nThe FOOD:\\nWe ordered appetizers Grilled Octopus and Papaya Salad and they did not disappoint. They served 6 octopi on skewer sticks nicely grilled and very well seasoned. The papaya salad was super delicious seasoned perfectly and almost taste like authentic Vietnamese papaya salad, making me homesick! For our main course we ordered their signature dish Imperial Crispy Redsnapper and Pho Brisket/Filet Mignon for our little daughter. The crispy redsnapper was one of the tastiest fish dish I've ever had since moving to Austin. It is nicely seasoned and slightly sweeten to the taste and super crispy to eat! Highly recommended!

If I could give Poor Calvin's a 6/5, you bet your Yelping self I would.\\n\\nI (very easily) made a reservation here for two a week before the date we were supposed to come in- we changed the reservation multiple times, which wasn't an issue. When we came in, we were automatically greeted, seated, and wished a happy anniversary which was pleasant to hear, since they kept that in mind from our reservation.\\n\\nOur server (can't remember her name for the life of me, but she defined excellence) was attentive, outgoing, and really helped us with our way around the menu. To start with, we ordered a Thai tea and a regular Coke- the Coke came out in a glass bottle which was nice to see. For our appetizer, we went for the lobster wontons..and WOW. So much flavor (spicy, sweet, lobstery goodness) oozed out from each square. The skin was fried to a perfect crisp, filled with a lobster cream cheese filling, and topped with caviar. It came out as three square wontons and was by no means a filling appetizer, but set our pallets nicely for what was to come. \\n\\nFor entrees, we ordered the fried grouper in panang curry with seasonal vegetables ($24), and the fried chicken that came with lobster mac and cheese ($23). The fried chicken also came with kale chips and collard greens, which I wasn't the biggest fan of. But man, oh man, this food was definitely some of the best I've tasted. The grouper was fresh and fried perfectly, I don't know how Calvin did it but the fish stayed crispy while soaking in the curry for at least 20 minutes. And the heavenly curry...I'm a big fan of Thai curry but this was truly the best I've had. It was so aromatic, and you could taste all the herbs, coconut, and spices infused into the dish. The vegetables that were resting in the curry were sauteed well and paired perfectly. I only wish that the side of rice that came with the curry was at least twice it's size, because this curry was HUGE. I eat normal portions and I was able to savor this for three individual meals.\\n\\nThe fried chicken and lobster mac and cheese was a yummy, quirky surprise. The chicken was fried and cooked perfectly. The mac and cheese had a smoky flavor which paired very well with  the chicken and kale. It was a great dish, but it stood subpar to the beauty that was the fried grouper curry. \\n\\nAfter we stuffed ourselves with our entrees, we were close to choosing our dessert, when our server came out and surprised us with their specialty coconut tiramisu, courtesy of the restaurant for our anniversary. How sweet! It wasn't particularly unique tiramisu, but it was delicious, fresh, and well presented. The dessert really made this wonderful night even more phenomenal.\\n\\nWith two drinks, an appetizer, and two entrees, our total rang up to about $70. It's not a cheap restaurant, but definitely reasonable for the insane quality and portion. I would also give a small heads up that PC isn't a romantic or quiet place. People were all dressed casually and conversing at their own tone and level. This place has a spot for everyone.\\n\\nPlease, please, if you are in Atlanta do yourself a favor and enjoy a night at Poor Calvin's.

If you've read some of my other reviews for highly-hyped brunch joints in DC and NYC, you know that I am no stranger to waiting in long lines for my breakfast. Sure enough, a formidable line had formed outside The Paramount by the time my boyfriend and I arrived at 10 AM on Sunday. It was much shorter than the lines I'm typically used to and certainly moved faster than I expected. I was also pleased to see a staff member handing out little cups of orange juice to everyone waiting. All in all, I waited approximately 45 minutes before I was fully seated with my food.\\n\\nOnce inside, the line moves cafeteria style in front of the kitchen. You grab a tray and tell the first line cook what you would like. Then, as you continue moving down the line, finished plates are handed your way. Finally, you are allowed to be seated. Though I was skeptical at first, the seating policy works surprisingly well. \\n\\nThe portions here are HUGE. I had read about a special called the \\"2-2-2\\" on Yelp so I inquired of the chef whether I could get this - 2 eggs, 2 sausages, and 2 pancakes. He said it was fine and sent me on my merry way. My boyfriend ordered the Chorizo Omelet, primarily because it came with guacamole. \\n\\nOnce I got to the front counter to pay, I told the cashier that I got the \\"2-2-2\\", which evidently deserved some attitude. \\"We don't even have that special here.\\" I was a little taken aback, so I explained that I had asked one of the cooks to make sure it was okay - to which she begrudgingly said she would honor it \\"just this one time, but don't do it again.\\" Didn't realize this warranted punishment.\\n\\nMy scrambled eggs, sausages, and extra side of bacon were all cooked pretty well.

I tried this with their sweet potato fries will dill dip-this were perfect!! Crispy, not overdone, and the dill dip goes perfectly with them. \\n\\nOther dishes tried include the fish and chips (large pieces of fish and a heaping plate of fries.), and the beef dip (also very large portion.)

That's the beauty of ramen though, you can add whatever you like from corn to fresh garlic! I also really love the salmon tacos. They're mini and not really worth the price but actually kind of good!

The buttermilk ranch that came with it was ok. It was a bit too runny for us. The pickles were crispy, but not what we were expecting. We wouldn't order them again. \\n\\nThe chicken piccata was surprisingly delicious. Hubster said the most interesting part of the meal was the pasta mixed with the brussel sprouts slaw with mushrooms and garlic. I know it doesn't mention brussel sprouts, but the shredded leafy looking items did resemble them. We were pleasantly surprised that the chicken piccata was tasty since I feel like Folk Art is more known for their breakfast and sandwich items. \\n\\nI ordered the fried chicken and sandwich was THE BEST CHICKEN SANDWICH ever! The chicken was HUGE. When I say huge it was the size of my hand huge. Nice and crispy on the outside and moist on the inside. The chicken wasn't salty or underwhelming. I loved that they toasted their bread on the the grill. I threw some mayo on top with a little bit of hot sauce. My mouth was in heaven. The slaw in the sandwich added a nice sweetness to it. You also can't go wrong with mac and cheese. When it's cooked on the stove top, it has nice crispy edges. \\n\\nI didn't care for the biscuit and gravy. For 5 bucks, I expected a moist biscuit loaded with gravy. The biscuit was on the dry side and I had to take multiple sips of water to wash it down.

This was a GOOD burger and I plowed through it like I was in a burger eating competition. \\n\\nThe Fried pickles and rings came out first though, and I enjoyed the onion rings a bit better than the pickles.

I thought they may have ACCIDENTALLY overcooked it the first time so I figured the next time would be different. The rice and beans have been tasty every time I've eaten them. No complaints there. The yucca fries would be my favorite but after the first time they've always been dry and old tasting not very fresh. They are delicious when they're fresh!! The mild sauce is a great choice for dipping. Now back to the chicken-- it NEVER got better!! It got WORSE!! When the word CHICKEN is in your name, you shouldn't mess up the CHICKEN!! It progressively got worse and last time I went there my ENTIRE piece of chicken was burnt!! I've actually pulled up in their parking lot to try it one more time but I just left because I couldn't take the disappointment! If I do return it'll be only for the rice and beans... I wouldn't recommend it for the chicken unless you like it burned. \\n\\nThe atmosphere is nice. The customer service is good too. But service doesn't fill your belly... smh. I hope they fix it! It's a great concept but if someone else comes up with the same genre with good chicken (doesn't have to be great) they are in trouble! I have wasted money on 5 meals and designer drinks trying to give them a chance."},{"name":"Pinthouse Pizza","address":"4236 S Lamar Blvd","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"Pinthouse Pizza was a great place to just chill and get a pizza and beer.

The shrimp was perfectly cooked and was seasoned with a good Cajun type of rub and the Avocado added a creaminess and the Tomato coulis calmed the spice a little.  It was such an interesting contrast of flavors and was delicious. Definitely need to get this dish! \\n\\nLobster Mac & Cheese- this was probably my favorite overall. The Mac and cheese was so good and had bread crumbs toasted on top for some texture. This dish though absolutely had lobster in it and you could taste it. So good!!\\n\\nChantrelle Ravioli- this was a tasty plate of ravioli.  We didn't even think about the fact that we got two types of pasta, but it worked out. The ravioli had a good texture and were just a touch below al dente. \\n\\nBeef Cheeks- this was the hearty entree of the evening. Straight meat and potatoes done in a classic preparation.

They even have BBQ.\\n\\nI asked about a sampler so I could try different meals. Of course they had one. Three entrees, three sides, and a dessert for $28pp. I had fried chicken, meatloaf, and chicken dumplings. For sides, I had greens, sweet potato souffle, and fried okra. For the finale, I had peach cobbler with a fresh Arnold Palmer to wash everything down. \\n\\nLet me say, I hear by decree, that they have \\"the Best fried Chicken in the World\\".

I think it's because it didn't include the fried onions and I just liked the overall flavor of the non-spicy version. \\n\\nThe Spicy Creamy Shrimp Tempura is delicious! There are about 6-8 pieces of battered and fried shrimp covered in a spicy creamy sauce. \\n\\nThe Takoyaki or the \\"Octopus Balls\\" were not my cup of tea. \\n\\nNow my absolute favorite item on the menu that is not Ramen is the Tokyo Curry Bowl.

Fortunately, the nice accompanying garlic toast remains unchanged.\\n\\nThen my mix and match grill arrived (chicken steak, deep fried pork chop). The cook on both meats was almost *perfect*, and the quality of both meats was high (but not gristle/fat free -- fortunately, there was very little). Almost: the last 2 bites of chicken had a little unrendered fat under the skin; not enough to significantly lower the score though. The fries are the same as iCafe (and Costco); the deliciously double-fried variety. The black pepper sauce is very good, if lacking a little kick.\\n4.5 stars.\\n\\nAnd the iced tea is delicious. Exactly what I crave when I'm in Hong Kong, and what I lament not being able to find any of in Japan (no seriously, I go into HK iced tea withdrawls there).\\n\\nDo I miss the old Red Bud? The \\"Cheers\\" of HK style cafes, where everyone did know your name: the low prices, pretty high quality, central location and convenience of debit brought many repeat customers. The staff used to know my name, but so did many of the patrons: friends of my parents who had watched me grow up, local customers who are used to seeing me around town for decades.\\n\\nI do miss that, and walked in here fully expecting to write a less positive review, but I can't. Even the service is pretty good, even if they don't know my name.\\n\\nOh, and although they scratched out the Interac sign in front, they've gone back to accepting debit. \\n\\nStill pretty good, even if the soup isn't 8.7/10, 4.25 stars"},{"name":"La Antioquena Restaurant","address":"3861 Lake Emma Rd","city":"Lake Mary","stars":"3.5","text":"Good Colombian food, and decent portions.

So I do know what I like... \\n\\n\\nPros- Its freshly shucked right in front of you. Once you're seated, someone would come right over and open a fresh bag of salted crackers and place it in a basket in front of you. We ordered 2 dozen oysters and the lady asked if we wanted the big ones or the medium ones and we told her a mixture. She brought our order over and shucked it for us. They shucked it fast so you're not there waiting for a long time. It's placed right in front of you and once you're finished you can throw the shell in an area so it can easily be cleaned up. They give you 4 different bottles of sauces as well. The staff was extremely friendly and attentive!!  \\n\\nCons- they only have 1 type of oyster (it was from Texas). I eat oysters often and I like to have options... I, myself, usually go for the crisp brine and clean finish. And oysters from Texas definitely does not have that. I also like to have fresh lemon juice with my oysters but all they had was bottle lemon juice and it changed the taste of the oysters so I ended up not using the lemon juice. \\nAlso the place looks rough.. could use a make over. Definitely doesn't look appealing at all. \\n\\nI would recommend you ordering by the dozen since i was told if you get the bucket you never know how many oysters you'll get. It could be a mixture of small and big or all big or all small. So some buckets can have 10-12 (big oysters) or 22 (small oysters). \\n\\nOverall the price was fair and the oysters were fresh but I don't see myself driving 40 mins to come here whenever I'm craving oysters.

We started out with appetizers to share with the table which were a delight in their variety and flavor. Who knew that Southern and Asian cuisine could jive so well? I tried 2 of their signature cocktails- the Sun spot and Dixie derby- both of which were delicious and not too sweet, though I enjoyed the Sun Spot more with its unique touch of spice. was so in love with my entree, the Prik king soft shell crab, I was reluctant to share- it came in an impressive half pineapple with 2 huge soft shell crabs! The accompanying curry was smooth and flavorful and not too spicy, allowing you to optimally appreciate the flavor without being overpowering.

It was a Friday morning and there was one party ahead of us. Shortly after we were seated, the restaurant was filled with patrons. We were seated and briefly greeted by our waitress.. She really didn't seem thrilled to be there. Very short and unpleasant. We were handed menus including a drink menu and the drink menu looked exciting, they had Bloody Mary flights, margarita flights, mimosa flights, you name it but as soon as we tried to order, we were shut down and told that they can't serve us until 11am- it was 10. That's fine! But why hand us a drink menu? The food was okay, mostly average. The pictures I posted look wonderful but don't be fooled.. Not great. I will say however, that the breakfast egg rolls were great. The egg rolls came with a sweet and spicy dipping sauce and we couldn't get enough of it. Besides that we had 2 breakfasts a burger and a soup.. 11am rolls around and the waitress offers to get us drinks. I tried the Bloody Mary flight while my two friends ordered the mimosa flights. Pretty good! $16 each. Next time I'd go with the mimosa flight because the little glasses on the Bloody Mary flight were loaded to the brim with ice .. Bill ended up being close to $150 including the tip. I'd be happy to pay that price for an impressive brunch experience but at The Friendly Toast, I just didn't get that.

I think with close to 1700 reviews, it may be the most reviewed restaurant in the downtown ATL area and have the near-perfect star rating with that many reviews, this place must have its magic. \\n\\nI managed to call in and get a table for 3 and to me, I think we got the best seat in the place. The decor at the place was fun and for being fully booked on Open Table, we really lucked out. We got seated at a round table that could have easily fitted 3-4 more people and it was near a real wood burning fireplace at the end of the restaurant's screened in patio. Since Atlanta did not live up to the Hotlanta name while I was there, sitting by the fireplace was awesome to defrost. \\n\\nAfter reviewing the menu, I ordered the prik king soft shell crab. I love soft shell crab and try to get it when I can. The presentation of this dish was magnificent. In a hollowed half pineapple, it's filled with green beans and pineapples in a spicy sauce. On top of all of this are two fried soft shell crab. On the side is served with jasmine rice. I love this dish despite the green beans being spicy and the batter for the soft shell crab had a kick to it. The two giant soft shell crab was fried perfectly and not dried out. The jasmine rice helped balance the spiciness and my Thai iced tea also did the work. That drink was super yummy. \\n\\nMy dinner mates shared the dumplings for appetizers and they got the fried lobster fried rice and the sea bass. The dumplings were good but it could have been a little hotter. I took a bite of both the fried rice and the sea bass. The fried rice was flavorful and also had a tolerable spiciness to it. The sea bass was melt in your mouth great. \\n\\nFor dessert, we ordered the peach cobbler with goat cheese empanada and some sort of cake with fired-up alcohol on it (a take on baked alaska). I liked the empanada although I'm not so sure about the goat cheese. The cake was good but I didn't enjoy the outer-layer of the cake because of the burnt bits from the alcohol. \\n\\nSo with the dessert being a tad disappointing and the dumpling being less outstanding, I took off one star.

I ordered the spaghetti with meat sauce with a side of meatballs. This is the standard by which I measure against all Italian restaurants I first try. It was good but not the best I had. My partner agreed this was a good place but not necessarily our go-to.\\n\\nI came here for dinner again this evening on my own. I was in the mood for a local Boston chain with decent food (the other consideration was 99). This time I got the French onion soup and one of the Italian trios (lasagna, chicken parm and a meatball). As one of the Yelpers mentioned, there are certain items that overpriced for what one gets--this is one of them (very small piece of lasagna, medium-ish sized meatball--the same kind one would get in the spaghetti and meatballs--and a thing piece of chicken parm). There was just this bland-ish sauce covering everything (presentation not too good). One good thing is that it was piping hot.\\n\\nMost of the servers here are high school or college kids.

No one asked how the food was and the waiters seemed more interested in watching videos in their downtime but they did deliver the food in a timely manner.\\n\\nFried chicken wings w/tamarind fish sauce was the only definitive thing suggested by our waiter, but while the wings were juicy and fried well, it was drowning in sauce and overpowered by the flavor. Perhaps asking for sauce on the side is the way to go, though the jalapeno basil or garlic version also sounded worth trying.. maybe for next time. \\n\\nHouse vermicelli bowl was really good and a decent price for 2 meats and a spring roll a top tons of noodles and fresh veggies.  Meat marinade for the pork and chicken were good, spring roll was crispy and tasty, and overall the quantity is enough for 2 people to share.  \\n\\nDuck confit sliders were a unique fusion take combining the bread that comes with peking duck, pickled veggies that come with bahn mi, and duck meat that one would associate with a light pulled pork.

I remain very impressed by their assortment of liquors, especially browns.    Where else in Atlanta do you find Pendleton Whisky?

It came with the large Marrow Bones, and my friends feasted on the Marrow.  I was feeling less then adventurous so I did not partake.   The half clove of grilled garlic was very good to accompany the meat.    Along side the steak came a great salad with very high grade lettuce.   I almost want to say it was Bib Lettuce and it had some kind of thin cut radish in it.    Really good.   As a side we shared the Sweet Polenta with Mushrooms and Jus (Beef or Lamb I forget).     My other friend had the Bar Steak with fries which was deemed acceptable, even if not earth shattering for its $22 price tag. \\n\\nSo this is only my second time here, but I really like it.   I have now been to St Cecilia once, and was far less impressed with their food and drink menu.     As everyone looks forward to Ford Fry's next joint (Tex-Mex) I can say that this one is for sure my top pick of the current assortment of four.

Very dim, crystal clear white rooms. The champagne bottles are shined up. You can see the big, wood-fire hot stove where they make the pizza, the full bar (Lots of champagne bottles seen), and loong brown tables.  \\n\\nYou can order Contorni, (Side dishes) of Pasta, Risotto, Pork Meatballs, Eggplant, which is my favorite. Le Pizze, (Pizza) Which i ordered the Ripiena Scarola that has the \\nMozzarella-escarole-black olive-red onion-garlic-anchovy as desribed on their site. Which I give all credit to because I would have no way in knowing the ingredient names and entree titles. It was one of the most pleasant experiences of biting and having the Mozzarella stretch into my mouth. The Red onions gives it an edge of green, while the garlic and anchovy gives it flavor. \\n\\n Dolci (Dessert):: My favorite was the Gelati/Sorbetti which can be picked Choice of three: chocolate-vanilla-coffee-yogurt-coconut-raspberry!! \\n\\nIn this case, I wanted all the flavors provided, so I went with the Chocolate, yogurt and strawberry.

First thought, this place is small. Like tiny. Seats maybe 20 people comfortably. When we walked in the young lady asked 'for here or to go?.'  I wondered if there were more tables in the back since I didn't see where she would put us. It was just maybe ten minutes and a table cleared out so we could sit. She took our orders right away. Then the troubles began. Coffee for me and hot chocolate my sidekick....both we weak and bland. Next, and I believe this was the fault of the kitchen staff, the orders came out slooooooowwwww. I was one of three tables waiting and waiting for food. The only ppl that seemed to be getting food where folks that ordered ahead and came to pick it up. I wondered if the kitchen was prioritizing call ins. In this time I saw many others walk in, look for seats, turn and leave. Finally a table got their food and the lady there had the nerve to send it back! Something about the chicken not being crispy enough. Some of us groaned because now we knew this was going to delay our orders even more. And sure enough, their food came out before ours. The next table of two only got one plate served (and that man ate that whole plate while her female acquaintance sat with nothing --- jerk) then finally ours came. They just skipped that lady altogether. They explained the cook just forgot her food. They gave it to her free. The food - quite tasty!  We had the chicken & waffles, fried shrimp (overpriced for portion size,) salmon croquette, French toast, cheese grits and eggs. The grits were cool by the time I got them but the flavor was good (at this point, nothing was getting sent back) but the eggs were a miss. Over cooked and rubbery. I had to blend them into my grits to make it edible. Over all, I'd definitely go again but not on a weekend morning.

Got the special \\"throne\\" for the birthday girl.  It was not busy on the Friday that we were there, had almost a little private section all to ourselves.  Owners/servers were very friendly and accommodating.  Place is larger inside than it looks from the outside and prettily decorated like a tropical garden, nice ambience for a strip mall.  The lunch specials menu was more extensive than most and pretty much the same as the dinner menu, but condensed (in printing), it's still a book, though.  They had many dishes that you don't commonly see in most Thai restaurants in America.  Only thing is, most dishes seem to still be seasoned for American tastes, so a little less (or no) fish sauce, less heat, more sugar.  I ordered the Drunken Noodles, which is supposed to be euphoric with the amount of heat, but it came to me with no discernible spice.  I amped it up with some pickled Thai birds eye chilies, and THEN it was spicy (like make my nose run and eyes tear up spicy) as it should be.  Our resident Thai (like actually moved over from Thailand) coworker asked for additional fried garlic for her Lad Na (Fried Noodles with Soy Gravy) and when they brought her the cup, she dumped all of it in her dish, then it was as it should be.  We had lots of apps and lots of desserts.  For the birthday girl, they brought out extra coconut ice cream (dense, creamy, I believe it's straight up frozen coconut cream, so delicious) with a lit candle and sang happy birthday.  We felt very welcome.  An appetizer you don't usually see on menus (but classic Thai dish) is Steamed Tapioca Balls, stuffed with ground pork, shredded daikon and crushed peanuts.  The flavors were nice and savory, with a hint of sweetness; the tapioca skins kind of on the really, really, chewy side (like more than expected).  Fresh Rolls were rice paper and filled mostly with red leaf lettuce and some rice noodles, had a scattering of poached shrimp.  Spring Rolls were exactly as described, came piping hot and in a crackling, crispy wrapper.  The best of the apps were the Chicken Curry Puffs, deep-fried puff pastry dumplings filled with mildly spiced, curried chicken and potatoes.  The wrappers were very tender and the filling spiced just right.  Entrees and noodle dishes, as mentioned, were seasoned very mildly, but all came to the table piping hot and as described and chock full of both proteins and vegetables (however they were ordered).  The Thai Doughnuts with Pandan Coconut Custard was a riff on the classic Chinese American take-out doughnut, which we all know is a deep-fried Pillsbury biscuit, right?  A dessert to try (unusual for most menus) is the Sticky Rice with Sweet Taro Stuffing, which is steamed and served wrapped in banana leaf.  The most interesting part was the Coconut Cream Sauce dip, which is salted and sweet at the same time.  We enjoyed it very much, would def rely on a few condiments to amp things up, but looking forward to trying out some new (to me) dishes."},{"name":"Home Slice Pizza","address":"1415 S Congress St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"I'm from Pennsylvania as this is the first place that reminded me of Pizza from home!

I think I prefer a more floral nitro brew vs an earthy one? I waver between a 3-4 rating on the coffee alone, so I would rate it at 3.5. One of the cool things is that you can get growlers of their cold brew (not nitro, since the bubbles don't keep well if you don't maintain pressure)! One of my favorite coffee shops in San Diego used to have this and when I was making more money I would splurge on a growler, so I look forward to treating myself to this at Banjo.\\n\\nThe location is near a lot of cute thrift shops, making it a fun little stop before shopping.

Yes, you read that correctly. The outsides of the burger and bun had a really nice crisp do it which just added to the whole burger experience. Their fries were great as were the two accompanying dipping sauces (manzano sauce, garlic aioli). Thanks to my generous and friendly neighbors at the bar I was also able to try their potato chips with pimento dipping sauce (great to dip the fries in too) and their apple pie which comes with salted butterscotch caramel, sage ice cream. Everything was delicious.\\n\\nOn my second visit I brought a group of good friends who I had been singing Launderette's praises to ever since my first visit. We had a feast ordering 14 dishes.

The sauce is nice but I didn't care for the amount that came on the dish (although next time I would probably just ask for it on the side for dipping). Overall great experience but bill easily reached $100+ which is a little pricey IMHO for what it was but hey that is just what you pay for trendy places in Atlanta.

He said they were out of BBQ about two and a half hours ago, but then walked around to the taxi driver's window and said, \\"I need to talk to you.\\" After fumbling around in his pocket for a bit, he pulls out a $20 and goes, \\"take these guys wherever they want to go eat.\\" Then he looks at us, and goes, \\"I hope you come back and see me.\\"\\n\\nWe told that story about ten times that day. And... we went back the next day at noon. We waited an hour, and John repeatedly came around to hand out beers to people waiting in line. That, in itself, would've been worth it. Once we got the food, it was amazing. They weren't kidding when they said it was like meat candy.  We had a sample of all the different meats- except the pork ribs which were already sold out.  Each meat was perfectly seasoned and fell apart in my mouth.  The turkey was unexpectedly juicy and had a crunchy edge.  A pink center dominated the prime rib and the homemade beef sausage had a crisp casing- exactly what we look for in BBQ.  \\n\\nThe favorites were the beef rib (aka meat candy) and the fall apart brisket.  Both melt in your mouth and make you close your eyes and moan.  Seriously.  As we sat with more free beers from my best friend, John Mueller, we watched different items get crossed off the menu, much to the disappointment of the remaining people in line.  But I didn't care.  I enjoyed all the meats with the coleslaw and mustardy potato salad, two sides that really complemented the meat.  Just go and don't let the line intimidate you.  John will give you a beer too.

The disclaimer I have to make is that we didn't pay for the steelhead because we only ate half of it and the waitress read the situation. So hats off to the front of house. My only wish is that I hope the bar serves deadly cocktails, because I think it's needed to enhance and assist the flavor (or lack thereof) and paying an outrageous price for it.\\n\\nEdit: Today I recieved an angry message from the owner.\\nAfter reading your slanderous review online, it is very apparent that you have zero understanding of how a restaurant operates.  ABSOLUTELY ZERO.  Restaurants are not money making machines, if you had any sense of how a business works....from the labour, rent, operational costs, etc...you wouldn't be saying some of those absolutely uneducated and ignorant remarks. It BLOWS MY MIND that you would draw your own conclusions about our cooking methods and come up with your own pricing...ABSOLUTELY BLOWS MY MIND.. WOW... I don't think you have any clue of what outrageous pricing in Vancouver is, I don't think you ever will.....but thanks for the review, now I know we should be charging .20 cents for our skins and $2.50 for appetizers....oh and maybe $5.00 for a main course..because that's what they're really worth..UNBELIEVABLE...you come into a restaurant, order 3 things, spend a whole $18 and decide to tell about it online so you can feel better about yourself...YOU ARE AMAZING!\\n\\nDear Mr Ray Loy,\\nAssuming you are the one that wrote this response, I will try to respond to you in the most professional way possible. The first thing I want to address is the fact that I don't have any clue as to how the restaurant business operates. That is indeed 100% accurate and I have no business commenting on how the pricing breakdown works. I only did that for comedic purposes, for that I apologize. \\n\\nMy rebuttal towards your response is: I don't care how much your overhead is, that's your business. I am a patron that have frequented many of your neighboring restaurants and compared it to yours and found it to not be on par in terms of taste, texture etc. That's my opinion and what makes the restaurant business in Vancouver so vibrant. \\n\\nWithout the likes of Yelp and Food Bloggers, a word of mouth, how do you expect to build awareness? This is a risk of the F&B business isn't it? To be exposed to the likes of me, who has been around the neighborhood and tried all of the restaurants and giving most of them a good to raving review. I just didn't think your product was even remotely close to what your competitors are offering. \\n\\nAlso to clarify, I don't think it's a ripoff to charge $5 for amuse bouche type items, and upwards to $30-40 for mains. My opinion is that when the product is overcooked, and executed poorly, it lacks value. NOT price. \\n\\nLastly, I want to thank you for eliminating the trout off my bill (which I did not ask to be left off). I am grateful for that gesture because well..

Now mind you we had ordered 2 apps 2 entrees drinks and dessert, so it wasn't like we weren't spending money. That's when he offered to take off an app. So we said fine that's cool. There were also other things he would forget to bring us after we had asked, and it's not like there were many ppl there, so I don't understand the lack of service etiquette. Also when our dessert came out we asked him about something on the dessert, we ordered the candy apples, and as he was explaining it to us he pointed at it almost as if he was going to touch it, that's how close his finger got to the food.

The pasta was perfectly cooked, well flavored, and the octopus was surprisingly tender - not rubbery at all.

My friend and I went for lunch on Saturday. The shop itself is a little small with not much seating. We arrived just before the lunch rush and were able to find seats without a problem. The murals on the walls and ceiling give the place a super hip vibe. \\n\\nWe both ordered pizza by the slice, and it was great! The man who took our orders was incredibly helpful and friendly. We both ordered the La Grassa, which was cheese pizza topped with bolognese. The crust was the perfect thickness, and it had great flavor. I was a little skeptical of having bolognese on top of pizza, but it was a perfect compliment.\\n\\nThe menu is really expansive, ranging from different types of fries to subs to pizza. The only downside to Mortadella Head is that it's a bit overpriced, but that can be expected from just about any restaurant in Davis Square.

I ordered a Long Island Tiki which the menu described as 'chai tea liqueur | 5 top spirits.' It tasted pretty much like a cinnamony street car which I really enjoyed. It came out in its own really cool/unique container and I was able to fill up my tumbler twice with the stuff and subsequently became fairly tipsy so the rest of the review might be suspect. The waitress was incredibly friendly and helpful although I didn't care for her first recommendation. The menu description was really interesting but the reality of it was pretty lacking. The eggs were not actually deviled, they were just hard boiled eggs which had been cut in half then deep fried. On top of this was a pile of Korean BBQ beef and caviar. The beef was a little tough which is ok on its own, but on top of a boiled egg its impossible to eat without squishing the poor egg into oblivion while you fight to gnaw through the beef. The taste of the caviar is completely lost among the Korean BBQ. It must only be there for its sexy looks. You'll probably have to eat first the beef then the very plain hardboiled egg seperately.  \\nNext I ordered the Seafood Melange. The seafood was excellent. The huge juicy scallops are definitely the star of the dish. The squid ink pasta was okay, but I've had better. \\nOverall, I had a great experience. The wait staff was absolutely wonderful.

This place has everything from themed Detention bar and Honors bar, restaurants, heated soaking pool and even a movie theater for the kiddos.

If I can convince my dinning companion, I like to share a small order of pancakes as an appetizer.  I mean, why don't we always have breakfast appetizers right?!  Speaking of breakfast appetizers, you should definitely try the housemade scone.  Actually I've never had anything I didn't like from the menu, including the inventive and tasty daily specials.

We were happily seated in the wine garden underneath a big tree with lots of beautiful hanging lights and candles. There's a bar outside so you can order drinks there too if you want. Wine is served by the bottle and the food is delicious and perfectly portioned. Since it's summer now.. there were quite a few mosquitoes but they have complimentary bug repellant and citronella candles to help decrease those nuisances. \\n\\nI had such a great experience here and the food was fantastic. I think we ordered off of the prix fixe menu of about 4 choices. The categories are land, sea, dessert and an appetizer (I think...). If you want to order 3 desserts and one land, then you can! Mama ain't here to tell you, you can't eat dessert for dinner! Alas, I am not that adventurous but I felt wild just thinking about that option. I chose the caprese salad as my appetizer, for my entree I had goat which was surprisingly tasty (I'm always afraid of gamey tasting foods), the sea option of fish and I forgot what else I had for my 4th option. :( \\n\\nOverall the food was pretty darn tasty, and I'd definitely go back. The only complaint is that the caprese salad was actually quite salty as were a few of the other options but for the most part, the food was consistently delicious. I highly recommend dousing yourself with the complimentary bug spray as the citronella candles didn't work quite as well as we would have liked.

It is not a large place. \\n\\nI anticipated ordering a boil so it would have sausage and corn but on the day we went it was just crawfish by the pound. We ordered crawfish and beer and one friend ordered the crawfish etouffee.  I ordered the andouille mac and cheese since the crawfish did not come with anything. Unfortunately my friend was not really impressed with the etouffee and I was not with the mac and cheese. However the crawfish was wonderfully seasoned that both me and my friend ended up ordering two pounds each. \\n\\nOverall we came for the crawfish and were happy with it.

It, along with Ton Ton at Ponce City Market, are among the latest ramen restaurants to open in metro Atlanta this summer. Jinya is a chain with several locations in both the US and Canada.\\n\\nI don't know if we went on an off night, but the food we had (particularly the ramen) was underwhelming. It's too bad because other aspects, such as service and ambiance, were great.\\n\\nThis restaurant is tucked away from street view in a shopping center with D Geller & Son and \\"Thai Restaurant.\\" It's not huge. There's indoor and outdoor (uncovered patio) seating. Inside, there's a ramen bar with an open kitchen. The staff will greet you loudly as you enter. I guesstimate the bar and dining room can seat about 40-50 customers. It was busy the night we went (a Tuesday night), but luckily there wasn't wait.\\n\\nJinya has one of the bigger ramen menus I've seen so far in the Atlanta area. They have at least 12 different kinds of ramen, most ranging in price from $11.50 to $13.50 per bowl. These prices are slightly more expensive than a place like Umaido (and its in-town counterpart, Hajime) where a bowl of tonkotsu ramen starts at $10.00. They also offer toppings galore -- over 25 kinds at $1.00 to $2.50 per.\\n\\nAside from ramen, they sell Japanese small plates and snacks (tapas), rice bowls, curry, and a couple desserts (mochi ice cream, panna cotta). In addition, they have seasonal, limited-time specials that ramen and other dishes.\\n\\nHere's what we ordered:\\n\\nTapas\\n* Jinya Buns ($4.00 each) - thick braised pork with vegetables wrapped in a white bun\\n* Takoyaki ($6.95) - octopus balls, green onion, egg tartar, bonito flakes\\n\\nRamen\\n* Cha Cha Cha (\\"Jinya No. 2\\") ($13.50) - pork broth, pork chashu, egg, bean sprouts, chopped onion, green onion, fish powder, chili powder, thick noodles\\n* Sprouting Up Ramen (\\"Jinya No. 3\\") ($12.95) - pork broth, pork chashu, Brussels sprouts, seasoned egg, green onion, kikurage, chili oil, thick noodles\\n* Tokyo Yatai Ramen ($12.00) - chicken and pork clear broth, chicken chashu, negi, leafy greens, bamboo shoots, shredded red pepper, seasoned egg, fried onion, thin noodles\\n\\nI thought the appetizers were alright. The Jinya buns are Jinya's version of gua bao, which are Chinese pork belly buns. Vegetables included cucumber and leafy spring mix greens. They also add some sort of creamy sauce (I think Japanese mayo) to the bao. The pork belly was savory and a little salty, but not bad. The steamed bun itself was very good. A decent snack.\\n\\nSix battered and fried octopus balls come to an order of the takoyaki. They were A-OK. What I like best about Jinya's takoyaki is the portion size. The size of the balls are bigger than your average serving of takoyaki. Also, they come absolutely loaded with dried bonito (fish flakes), chopped green onion, and mayo. Yum.\\n\\nAs for the ramen, it turns out there was a different type of noodle for each ramen we ordered. The Cha Cha Cha had the thickest noodles, the Sprouting Up had thick noodles (just not as thick as the Cha Cha Cha), and the Tokyo Yatai had thin noodles. \\n\\nOverall, of the three ramen ordered, the Sprouting Up Ramen was my favorite. It tasted most like a traditional, classic tonkotsu ramen. Its broth had the most flavor, relatively speaking. However, in general, I thought all three broths were severely lacking in taste. The Cha Cha Cha, which is supposedly Jinya's best seller and is supposed to have the richest, heaviest broth, actually was the most bland. I was so sad because I love nothing more than a good, garlicky ramen. It was neither!\\n\\nThe noodles in the Cha Cha Cha (thickest) and Sprouting Up (thick) ramen were indeed thick and exceptionally chewy, especially when compared to standard ramen noodles. The noticeably chewier consistency was different and I didn't mind it. These noodles were appetizing enough. The Tokyo Yatai (thin) noodles were the complete opposite: very soft and borderline mushy. Instead of ramen noodles, these noodles reminded us of the thin egg noodles found in Chinese and Vietnamese cuisine.\\n\\nApart from the noodles and broth, I thought the other ingredients were fine. The slices of chashu were thick, tender, and satisfactorily tasty. The Sprouting Up Ramen was the first time I've had roasted Brussels sprouts in my ramen. I like Brussels sprouts, but I'm not sure if I like them in ramen. Kikurage = wood ear fungus/mushroom. In the Tokyo Yatai, negi is another type of green onion.\\n\\nIf you like garlic, be sure to ask for complimentary raw garlic cloves and a garlic press. They also have various spices at each table including chili oil, chili sauces and pastes, and shichi-mi t≈çgarashi, which is a dry Japanese spice mix (a must in ramen for me).\\n\\nService was excellent. Jennifer was wonderful! The manager does a nice job selling the ramen.\\n\\nThere's plenty of parking."},{"name":"Lambert's Rainbow Market","address":"777 Morrissey Blvd","city":"Dorchester","stars":"4.5","text":"Lamberts is literally the best place to get fruit and veggies besides an open market or street vending.

On weekends, there are no reservations or call ahead seating. Tables (no matter the size) are seated on the first come, first serve basis. We came here for Sunday dinner with a party of 10 and once everyone had arrived we were seated in about 4 minutes flat.\\n\\nThis wasn't my first time here so although I was craving fried chicken I opted for something I hadn't tasted here previously. I ordered the meatloaf and paired it with mashed potatoes and collard greens. The meatloaf had a tomato sauce plastered on top that gave it a rich, sweet taste. This meal was perfect. I only ate about half of it and finished the rest later that night. Almost everyone else at the table ordered some type of chicken so I was able to get my fried chicken fix, too with a nibble of a wing.\\n\\nI believe out of our party of 10, 8 people got chicken. Probably 9, I may have been the only person to opt out of some chicken for dinner. I did take home some peach cobbler. I ate it later with some Haagen Dazs vanilla ice cream. This was delightful. I'm glad I ordered it to go because I wouldn't have been able to finish it at dinner.\\n\\nOur waitress was extremely friendly and handled the large, indecisive party very well.

Limited street parking is available, but would require some walking. Prior to dinner, I booked an opentable reservation.

I didn't appreciate how the prices were not listed on their webpage, but was pleasantly surprised to see the prices for hibachi were cheap. Teriyaki chicken was only $15. Is this for real? Yes it's for real, but there are caveats. For one thing, for fried rice, it's an additional $3. for veggies, it's an additional $8 add on. $15 teriyaki just became $26. Plain white rice is free, but then there is nothing for the chef to do in terms of performances. In my head, I was thinking, this is the Spirit Airlines of hibachi. Also, I would have appreciated it if the server had told us prior to placing the order of the additional charges.

If you told me the kitchen was staffed exclusively with southern grandmothers with a point to prove I would believe it. \\n\\nThe restaurant itself is massive. They have several large rooms filled with what has to be well over a hundred customers at any given time.  Even though we got there fairly close to the opening there was still a bit of a wait. We wound up at a large table with two other couples. Weird but hey we got seated quicker. \\n\\nYou write out what you want in advance. That is nice and effective. Cuts down on the confusion and let's the kitchen know what's going on with everyone clearly. \\n\\nSo between us we ordered blackened catfish (crispy flaky and juicy) and as many sides as our greedy eyes could manage. The fried okra was evenly fried to a perfectly golden crunch. The mac and cheese was creamy and wonderful. The stewed apples tasted like a shameless amount of sugar was added. Completely shameless. But also delicious. You were warned. \\n\\nWe got desserts. The banana pudding had perfectly ripened bananas (for all those that know what is required for good banana pudding you know what I mean by this)  the apple pie had a great crust with what seemed like the same shameless stewed apples but with more cinnamon. \\n\\nOur server was really nice and efficient. \\n\\nWe found nearby street parking with no hassle. \\n\\nAll in all if you want a cheat meal \\"like grandma used to make\\" and don't happen to have a grandmother handy this is the place for you.

I didn't expect the donuts to live up to the reputation but they definitely did!The variety was almost overwhelming but I chose a hibiscus glaze with chocolate sprinkles and IT. WAS. DELICIOUS. The dough was dense yet fluffy and the glaze wasn't excruciatingly sweet (I don't have much of a sweet tooth). Definitely worth trying and buying a box. On top of that, the staff was so nice! The donuts last a solid 20 hours of tasting fresh and then the texture and taste declines fast so these are definitely the kind of thing you should eat soon, but I can't hold that against them, that's the case with practically every donut, just don't expect to save them or order a bunch if you don't plan on finishing them. The store is really quirky and the music plays loudly, but I found it very enjoyable. They have clean restrooms, too, and only take cash. I was very lucky and ended up in a 20 minute line at 1am, but I passed by it twice on the same day and it was packed! So would I wait in that line? No. Especially when I know there are less busy business hours.

And certainly, if the superlative \\"absolute\\" is further applied to describe the food, well... most might anticipate something truly special emerging from the kitchen.\\nAdd a price point at which a conservative dinner for two requires a visit from old Ben, and I think it's safe to assume that one should be provided a truly memorable experience. Not memorable like that Thanksgiving dinner when your uncle announced that he'd become a Scientologist, and your cousin from Alabama saw it as his opportunity to reveal that he'd knocked up his underage girlfriend. \\nMemorable in a good way.\\n\\nThese were my hopes, after reading of the resoundingly positive experiences at Poor Calvin's, but as Mr. Franklin said, \\"He that lives upon hope will die fasting.\\"\\n\\nHope is one thing, but I've been around the block enough to know what fusion really means, i.e. the combination of cuisines into an amalgam that is inferior to its parts. Asian fusion food, in particular, seems most often to be the product of Frankenstein's kitchen, in a way that is less Mary Shelley, more James Whale.\\nYou know who loved Asian fusion? Ten-year-old me. Know what else ten-year-old me liked? Potted meat and mayonnaise on Iron Kids bread.\\nAsian fusion too often relies on the salty and the sweet to make flavors pop. This is how Pepsi won the Pepsi Challenge in the '80s. Anything with more sugar or salt will be the preferred choice after only a small taste, but, as anyone with taste buds knows, Pepsi has the flavor of Coke that has been filtered through the day-old used tampon of a trichomoniatic prostitute.\\n\\nBy now, you've probably figured out that I don't think Calvin has avoided this trap in his attempts to bring Asian fusion to a higher level. The food here isn't bad. Some of it is quite tasty... in moderation. I had made a reservation online about a week ahead of time for a late evening during Downtown Restaurant Week. I followed up by phone to confirm, to get details about parking, and to see if they could do anything special for dessert, as this was to be a celebratory birthday meal. Not a sombrero and mariachi serenade, mind you, but at least a candle in the cake. The guy on the phone said he would make a note.\\n\\nCalvin's offers complimentary car service to Downtown/Midtown hotel guests, courtesy of Uber. I wished that I could have taken advantage of this, coming from the Plaza Theatre. I arrived ahead of time and pulled up to the valet station, where two full lanes of Piedmont were blocked by parked cars. Instead of the valet, I was met by two surly, burly cops, apparently informing the valets that they could not obstruct the road in this manner. I circled the block and parked in a well-lit spot on Pine Street, and then walked to the restaurant.\\n\\nEven on this weeknight, being Restaurant Week meant that the place was expectedly packed. I was seated close to the reserved time, at a table with a child's plastic chair perched precariously near the edge of a step.\\nService is fine. My waiter and others I observed were courteous, helpful, knowledgeable, and prompt, except that there were times that I'd have liked my water refilled more frequently (a consequence of tiny water glasses), and one waitress had the obnoxious diction of Fran Drescher, which rose above all other sounds in the cramped restaurant.\\nThe prix-fixe menu for Restaurant Week was extensive. I had duck wontons, seafood spring rolls, roasted unicorn fish, and lobster fried rice. The spring rolls were the undisputed weakest link of the meal, having a flavor I can describe only as... strange. The fried wontons, filled with a blend of duck, corn, and seasonings, and topped with a sweet and savory sauce (and inexplicably also served with another sweet sauce), were delicious.\\nThe fried rice, though salty, was a tasty m√©lange of veggies and such, but its star - fried lobster tail - was overcooked, chewy. The fish - a variety I'd never had before - was pretty good for the first few bites, but became somewhat overwhelming as the salt and sweetness caught up with me. It was served with kale, asparagus, mashed potatoes, kale, grilled cucumber, kale, kale, a creamy drizzle of sauces, and some kale. The serving was thin, and a little smaller than my hand. Dessert, a light tiramisu with no candles, didn't impress. \\n\\nAll in all, there's nothing poor about Calvin's fusion, but neither will it blow any minds. Prix-fixe menus for Restaurant Week are always a risk. Personally, I see it as an opportunity for restaurants to show off and to snare many new regular customers, but too often it seems they might prefer to put forth as little effort as possible just to boost receipts temporarily.\\n\\nWell, Calvin, your money's on the dresser, baby. I'm done with you.\\n\\nIf you like potted meat and mayo on Iron Kids bread, then you might love Poor Calvin's.\\n\\nOverall, 5/10."},{"name":"Steak on Fire","address":"7541 Sand Lake Rd, Ste A","city":"Orlando","stars":"4.5","text":"When we didn't feel like waiting for a busy restaurant across the street, we popped into Steak on Fire.

The Event Coordinator was extremely helpful from the beginning, helping to walk us through our options and ensuring that we had everything personalized down to the last detail. The food was delicious and we had a great variety. I especially appreciated how quick they were to accommodate any dietary redirections and made special arrangements for the children to have chicken fingers.

It was abundantly clear the thought and consideration that went in to helping us plan this special day.\\n\\nHaving our wedding on the Elite was such unique experience and we are positive it left a lasting impression with our guests.

It was a filling appetizer (even having shared with someone) so I recommend ordering it with ramen only if you're really hungry. For the bowl of ramen I opted for tonkotsu spicy. Good because the noodles were fresh and still had a good chew to them, the broth was fine but the quantity of meat was low and the taste wasn't impressive. I was more impressed with the takoyaki. I would come back to try something else on the ramen menu. \\n\\nOur server was aloof, I'd asked for raw garlic that I never got and she didn't check on our waters.

It's tucked away off in a quaint Portland neighborhood complete with sidewalk table seating out front under nice floral trees. \\nQuestion. Is there a food that when you eat it, deep ancestral emotions are stirred and a state of euphoria comes over you? German food does that for me. Wienerschnitzel, sp√§tzle, bratwursts, warm potato salad, rotkohl, and let's not forget good German beer. When I eat good German food, I'm a happy little clam. But when it's just an imitation and/or subpar, my day is ruined and it takes me a week to get over it. I mention this because although this place is a gastropub (I'm not a fan of them), my heart, taste buds, and stomach can attest that this place is doing something very right. Our biggest problem was that there wasn't enough room in our stomachs to eat the whole menu. The food is hearty, simple, and good portions. The side sp√§tzle is a great deal at $5, you get a big bowl. It's not as good as the Missus' sp√§tzle but it's still damn good. Warm potato salad could have used some vinegar (or more) but the three sausages on a bed of sauerkraut was perfect. Great variety of German beers that match well with the food.

We had delicious entrees including lobster scampi and fried butterfly shrimp. The butterfly shrimp plate was a little weak - and wasn't quite worth the $20+. But the lobster scampi was wonderful! Our waitress was attentive, but we couldn't seem to get her to smile. Maybe she was having a rough day. Overall, totally worth the experience. The oldest place in America! Such fun!

The bread accompanying the meatballs was also great.\\n\\nFor dinner I ordered tonnarelli & lamb ragu ( $25 )and my partner ordered the ricotta and herb ravioli ( $24 ). My serving size was great but the sauce was too salty for my liking. My partner was unsatisfied with his serving size, and I will admit for 24$ you would expect more than 5 or 6 ravioli.

The olive oil cake was dense and sweet with a great marriage of orange and olive oil flavours.\\n\\nIf I were to return I could definitely do it in a cooler season.

My boyfriend ordered pulled pork tacos but couldn't eat more than a couple bites as it was clearly just pulled from the freezer, warmed up, and assaulted by pineapples. They should advertise it as mashed pork because that's what we got. Nearly forty minutes later, my boyfriend received his flight of beer, two of which were undrinkable due to the poor quality of beers that he is very familiar with but could not even recognize.

He was nice and brought my order out promptly and with a smile. I wish I would've gotten his name. I first received the breadsticks which were so amazing. They melt in your mouth and seem like they are made from scratch. They were too good. I could've just eaten those with some marinara to be honest. But I couldn't stop there. So I ordered the Fries Calamari appetizer and it was beautifully fried. The batter was light and airy and the dipping sauce was so delicious! Not your everyday marinara! I ordered the Frutta di Mare pasta which came with clams, shrimp, muscles and scallops. It was nothing short of incredible. That white creamy sauce was sooooo good! I even got a soup with pasta and northern beans that went with my dinner. You can get this same dish with a red sauce over it. It's called something else but just ask! Needless to say, I'll be back.

Recently when a friend wanted to try it, I was like great, I'm not going to enjoy myself. But, 2 Sundays ago, I would say it was one of the best brunch experiences I've had in a while. Granted, I was a little hungover, but I made sure to study the menu on yelp :) Honestly, I struggled between a couple items, but with our waiters recommendations, I went with the Plancha Burger (hungover eating), and the Turkish Egg. The burger was solid, the bun was buttery, not too crisp or soft, perfect. But, the Turkish Egg was really special. An egg sitting in the most delicious yogurt sauce, the perfect amount of richness and heat from the chile. Then, to top it off, we got dessert. This was one of the best ice creams I've ever had, and I don't really like ordering in-house made ice cream either. The seasonal flavor was Popcorn, and they should sell it by the tub, because it was the perfect amount of salty, buttery, and sweet. Then, on the bottom was a chocolate fudge sauce, it was heaven. \\n\\nOh, and my friend said her dishes were good too.

Our fish followed shortly after and the fish was not served like the traditional fish and chips you would get, but tasted good!  the fish was battered and fried but served as a single piece and my butter knife cut right through, the batter was light flaky and crisp, and the fish was flavorful, fresh, and tasty.  The fries were big pieces of potatoes but crisp with light salt, a different way for me to eat fries, but if you are a potatoes lover like myself then it doesn't matter how the fries are served just as long as they are fried right!!! And these fries were right!!! To end off the night my waitress  Ryan described dessert, and although i did not have room, the way she described the chocolate mouse cake i had to order and eat later.

A few thoughts: \\n\\n1. In terms of outside aesthetics, it is more welcoming than some of its sandwich brethren, such as Subway or Podima.  This may just be the newness, but it feels like a standard sandwich bar-type place.\\n\\n2. It's pricey.  I've gotten the ham and turkey and honey dijon sammich.  That, plus a drink, came out to $10.   As Sara notes, with places like Anna's and Villa Mexico beating that price easily, as does Subway (though I will give this place a lot of credit for being better run than the Subway).\\n\\n3.  The food is okay, though average for the price you're paying.  I mean, it's in a high-traffic lunch area, so that may dictate things (MGH being nearby and all).\\n\\nOverall, it's middle of the road for me.  It's a more dependable option than Subway, and it compares well with Podima.  However, there are cheaper and better options (Villa Mexico and Upper Crust) nearby.

It was just a block of soybean doused in a bbq sauce with vegetable side dishes.  Not impressive and not recommend for the first timer. BUT! My friend got a Thai-style curry vegan dish and THAT was enjoyable and tasty! Highly recommendable!\\n\\nBut before all that, you MUST get the spicy pesto appetizer!!!! We ordered that upon our waiter's recommendation and it blew my omnivorous mind!  I tastes like a cold bowl of chili but the protein and meaty mouthfeel comes from the pecans! Woah... o.o\\n\\nTo top it all off, we also got ourselves some dessert of blueberry lavender pie a la mode with Thai ice cream.  Long story short - fuck the pie. Get the velvety, sinfully delicious ice cream made with coconut milk! This pie's shortcoming is the crust.  The mushy texture really kills the joy of eating this pie, but is in no way a mark against this establishment since it was brought to our attention that it was outsourced from a nearby bakery. similarly with the ice cream. \\n\\nOverall, I would highly recommend this place to anybody that is new to Austin and vegan cuisines.

With the proximity of this store to my house, I figured I would give them a shot. About two months into buying a 4 pack of pods for $24, I realized gas stations almost everywhere sold them for $17/4 pack. I stopped using this store for the time being, feeling like they were marking up their product for no reason--Juul Pods aren't going to be returned, you don't have to load them, there is no reason other than greed these should be price where they are.\\n\\nMore recently, I wanted to make the switch from the Juul to another pod-based device, but one I could fill myself so I could try new flavors, and decrease my nicotine content. When I entered the store, I waited about five minutes, no problem there as they man behind the counter was helping another customer. When I asked him my question about devices I could switch too, I informed him I had done some browsing online, but with my general lack of vape knowledge, was having a hard time even differentiating all the options. The employee took out one device, told me that was the one I wanted. When I inquired about other options (of which I know there are at least 12-15 devices) He did not acknowledge another product. When I asked specifics about the device he recommended, I was treated as if my questions were stupid--eye rolls, short-tempered tone, every answer began with \\"I mean...\\"\\nWhen I asked about juices, he didn't offer me to smell any of them, or compare one brand against another, just giving me one and ringing it up.\\n\\nNow, fine, the customer service isn't great, but, upon filling my device, the Sourin Drop, the man behind the counter did so improperly, filling only one side of the pod, demonstrating that I should do the same. It was alarming to see his lack of knowledge in action. The whole reason I went to the store in the first place was to get one on one, face to face assistance, knowing full well I would pay the premium they somehow feel they are owed. \\n\\nUpon leaving the store and surely overpaying for my device and one 30 mL bottle of juice, something like 85 dollars (I would have bought more but will do so online--could have got the everything I got in store for $50) I noticed that the pod provided in my device was cracked in a couple of places. The employee filled the pod in store, yet did not notice this massive crack! With their markup, replacement pods, of which I only bought one at the time, are $10. The man behind the counter must have missed it, but I would hope he wouldn't miss things like that, and it ultimately gave me the feeling I ended up with a 'demo' device that had been used, possibly for weeks or months, before being sold to me as new. The battery life on the device is already alarmingly low after having the device for only four days and lightly using it. \\n\\nI would say beware of these reviews left simply to get a 10% discount, their customer service is negligible at best and harmful at worst, and their prices are 1.5x that of online retailers. I will not be going back, not even to return my used and partially broken device.\\n\\nTL;DR \\nWent in to get a new device fully aware they charge higher prices in hopes of receiving customer service. I was treated like I was stupid, left with a broken device, and was given improper advice on my new device. I left paying about 2x what I could have @ another retailer, feeling like they had their hand in my wallet. \\n\\nEDIT:\\nMarco (the Sales manager) did send me sincere apology note, and while I appreciate the apology, I will not be taking down my review for a 20% discount at a store that has items with 250% markup and employees who seem to give less than a sh*t about customer service."},{"name":"The Optimist","address":"914 Howell Mill Rd","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Met the owner who shared our love of burgers, and told us to try his opti butter burger:\\n\\nOpti butter burger: definitely a good burger. not the best i have ever had, but it was very good. very rich, very moist.

Not worth it.\\n\\nDuck's is downstairs from my work, or else I would have never known about them.  One morning I was all, \\"Hmm the coffee at my job sucks balls, I wonder if there is a place that has actual good-tasting coffee instead\\", and lo and behold, Duck's was downstairs serving up some Batdorf & Bronson brew! They make the BEST MOCHA EVER because they actually melt dark chocolate into the damn thing.  The bad news is that means it can't be made iced, but the good news is that their iced vanilla lattes are super delicious too!\\n\\nAll their delectable breads are baked on site, and not a one of them is undelicious.  The kalamata loaf is probably my fave, but walnut leek is good, and the home-made bagels are to die for.

Good.\\n\\nSaturday Specials are why I want to live to see another day, though.  One weekend it was a croissant with tomato, basil, proscuitto, and egg, and it was ZOMGSOGOOD.

I had a slice of pumpkin cheesecake last week that was the best I've ever had!  And the cinnamon donuts are cute and tasty and since they're baked (not fried!) they're basically health food.

Tonight we got the steak bomb and buff chicken flatbreads. The buff chicken was subpar tonight and doughy, under cooked and the steak bomb was super soggy. We've ordered the steak bomb numerous times and we always love it, and I'd swear it has never had red sauce on it and that's probably because you don't mix red sauce with a grilled steak bomb pizza that's just odd, do people ever put red sauce on their steak bomb subs? No, no they don't. So anyways tonight the steak flatbread was sopping with red sauce and incredibly soggy. So I asked if the recipe changed and I was told it had not, do I believe that? No, but anyways tonight was disappointing. I don't mind paying $12-14 for a flatbread at a nice place ever but I felt tonight was a waste of money because of what we got in return.

Well, the parking lot and warehouse building setup are definitely urban.  I might have gotten a little lost in the warehouse parking lot until I made a U-turn and saw the \\"Two Urban Licks: Valet Only\\" signs.  Strike one: I absolutely hate when restaurants are unnecessarily valet only.  Yes, there are some places where it is practically a requirement, but here it's totally unnecessary and just a waste of a few bucks that you are obligated to tip for your complimentary/mandatory valet.  Rant over.\\n\\nWalking in and you are instantly taken aback of the breathtaking contemporary d√©cor.  This place is huge!  Dimly lit, high ceilings, gas light candles from floor to ceiling, and really cool art everywhere.  It's a pretty breathtaking modern hipster vibe.  Admittedly I prefer the Sex And The City-esque feel of One Midtown Kitchen, but A+ on atmosphere nonetheless.\\n\\nWe were promptly seated with my table of 10+ Yelpers and I instantly became obsessed with this small, intimate get together.  Everyone rocked!  Service was really good, albeit a little slow for drinks.  Food, however, was delivered very promptly after ordering.  All and all the two servers at our table did a great job catering to such a large group.\\n\\nFor an appetizer, we split the salmon chips and hot damn they were good!  It's a generous serving of salmon, chipotle cream cheese, and capers atop a gigantic chip.  Truth be told, you could almost have this as an entr√©e and call it the trendy version of salmon lox on a bagel.  I had the gouda grits for my main course and they were fabulous as well.  I'm a total Charleston shrimp and grits traditionalist, but these were delicious in their own innovative gouda, mushrooms, poached egg, and truffle right.  My friend had the pimento cheese BLT and this thing was so large that it was worthy of being on an episode of Man vs. Food.

The seating policy is that you don't sit until you get your food, and when you are ready to sit there will most likely be a table open. So basically you are waiting in line for a long time (for us it was, no joke, close to 40 minutes) and then not 100% guaranteed a seat, though for the most part we realized there was always a table open when needed. Seems risky tho! While you are waiting in line, you're trying not to bump the people eating and constantly needing to squeeze out of the way of the servers. The staff clearly has a system down that seemed to be efficient, but I think on any day less than a Saturday early afternoon it would have been much less chaotic and cramped and the whole experience a little more enjoyable.\\n\\nThe good part is the good is VERY yummy. I had the avocado sunrise open-faced toast and my husband had the chorizo omelette. Both tasted great and were flavorful and colorful.

It was definitely the smallest sandwich I ever had (by far) and the side of fries that came with it were cold. Luckily the sandwich tasted pretty good. \\nThe only exception was my wifes scrambled eggs plate. Her meal was a reasonable. At $11 it came with a decent pile of eggs, 2 pieces of thick toast, 3 pieces of bacon and homefries....all of which she said were tasty and filling.

Most of the menu was extremely \\"foodie\\" based and featured many odd dishes. both of our meals were bland. Not only bland in flavor but in overall appearance. With a small red cabbage side you don't get much to eat portion wise. Usually this is complemented with high end taste. The waiter recommended the burger be cooked through. This left it dry with burnt edges and the bacon spring rolls that were atop the burger were an inadequate attempt to be high end when to be honest, a couple slices of real bacon would've been great. \\n\\n2. The price- the food is high priced. I've always been fine with paying high cost for great food, but with the small portions and bland meals, it's simply not worth the $20-30 price tag per entree. \\n\\n3.

There was a smear of sweet potato puree, candied pecans and a few leaves of brussel sprouts.  I ordered the Trout stuffed with spinach and romesco sauce.  It was served with lots of herbs on top.

Good, but not my favorite kale dish I've ever had.\\nOk...I saved the best to last...and no it's not dessert.  The beginning of our meal I ordered the deviled egg bites.  OMG, SOOOO GOOD!!!  I'm a deviled egg connoisseur, really!  I think these were some of the best.  They give you two whole eggs.  I think they had a vinegar in them that sent it over the top.

If you do visit Voodoo, do NOT just get one donut per person.

Unfortunately, that was not the case at our most recent visit. \\nWe sat at a high top in the bar area, with a full view of the bar. We noticed there was a bartender we hadn't seen before and went on to notice that she wasn't clearing dishes for several minutes when people left. We ordered as people were leaving and the same dishes were still on the bar when we finished our dinners. When she did remove them, she wasn't washing hands in between handling the dirty glasses (with fingers inside the mouth), and pouring new glasses for the waitstaff to deliver. She didn't wipe down the bar at all while we were there, which was a while due to the lack of attention from our server. The server was friendly when she came to our table, but we rarely saw her and had to ask for the check twice. The restaurant and bar were not busy. \\nIt was nearing the end of the summer menu so we tried the fried chicken  and it was just ok.

Both the boar and chicken  sandwiches taste like something you already know and love but work in new flavors you'll find yourself craving later.

There is now a different staff and I actually had a steak this time which is very unusual for me when eating in a restaurant. I have come in with a large group who had an individual who had done the hard work of being an advance team, so the restaurant was warned and prepared. I would say that everyone arrived within about 15 minutes of the scheduled time. That was a key element.\\nEverything went seamlessly. The food selection was good, yes. But what really worked was full integration of the staff, historical explanations, descriptions of the different dishes and details of why they were prepared with different spices. The Q&A sessions to the Grill Master on meats was unexpected and I picked up some great tips. With sharing with others, I sampled three appetizers :shrimp, wings and fried green tomatoes. I am not a fan of wings except those that we prepare at home, but that is a personal choice. The shrimp was OK, but the breading separated very easily. While this is distracting to some, I prefer my shrimp not breaded, so this worked to my advantage. I loved the fried green tomatoes! I next had the chili, which was nice and spicy and praise be had no beans! The meat was ground. It was good, but I prefer a chunk cut beef chili which is old school and not common today. So no fault there. I ordered the filet, medium rare, which I hoped would come out a bit between rare and medium rare. Spot on and surprisingly tender. The rice was great. I was stuffed. I had ordered the strawberry short cake and had to take it home. The wait staff that I dealt with was efficient, non obtrusive and quite prompt. That is the result of advance team efforts providing information in my humble opinion. At the end of the meal, the nuts and bolts of the operation, the line and grill cooks came out and made an appearance to our applause. Wonder time. I took pictures of not only my food but of the others around me.

Well.... i really wanted to love this place. My First dislike is the fact that there are no reservations. My one friend arrived 40 minutes before I did and put the three of us on the list when I got there there was still an additional 30 to 45 minute wait. After we noticed 3 to 4 people that walked up and got on the list after we had I went to check to see where we were on the list...at first the hostess stated that we weren't on the list and when he seen I was growing highly irritated due to the fact that I was looking at the list spotted her name and noticed that six names below ours was crossed out. I think we had been overlooked for whatever reason I would like to chalk it up as it being an honest mistake which is fine I just would have preferred that he owned up to the fact that he overlooked us instead of pretending like it was just that long of a wait. he suddenly located our name and told me that there was just one more person in front of us. I went to the relay the message to my other two friends and we waited for another 20 minutes. My friend was starting to believe that it was more to it.... a more controversial reasons let's just say as to why we were waiting so long I hope that was not the case! so when we walked in to make sure that was not the case the hostess said oh your tables ready. Although I do not remember the waiter's name he was really helpful with helping us choose which dishes to try. I tried the sweet potato chicken and waffles as he informed me they were on the Food Network a couple of weeks ago. I've been visiting a lot of brunch spots lately so I will just say this they were edible but I would not say they were Food Network worthy honestly my waffle was a little dry thin and crunchy.

I've heard great things about this restaurant and the food so I was excited to try it with my friends. First of all, our waitress was rude. In a nice nasty way...She walks up to us and says \\"Y'all know what you want?\\" No introductions, no asking had we been here before, no greeting at all. We'd just sat down and hardly had a chance to look at the menu. The water glasses were full of lint which was swirling around in our glasses after the water was poured...who wants to drink lint?? After ordering drinks she'd recommended, after us asking, 2 of us didn't like the same drink so we sent it back. She rudely snatched my drink off the table and didn't bother to ask if I wanted something else (at least I wasn't charged for it). I had to catch her the next time she came to our table to order another drink and then I was able to ask her what her name was...Melissa. We asked for the water glasses to be removed by someone who stopped by the table to drop off bread, she was just as rude as Melissa! Needless to say, the dirty, untouched by us water glasses sat on our table the entire night making things very crowded. The appetizers were good. If you dare to venture there try the salmon chips, crab cake was spicy but it was the sauce otherwise very tasty, and the calamari was excellent. Our entrees took forever to come. We had to pour water into our empty cocktail glasses because we were thirsty and didn't want our fill of lint. As far as the entrees, the steak was good and the scallops with grits...(as you can tell by my review I try everyone's food ). The brisket was chewy and the chicken was juicy but lacked flavor. I was super disappointed because we sat right near the wood grill with the chicken turning and it looked mouthwatering. But I didn't dare send it back or I would have been sitting there hungry. So I sucked it up. We didn't get offered dessert at all, which was no surprise either. I've been to restaurants for my birthday and I'm always made to feel special. I definitely didn't feel like I was treated more than anything but a nuisance. Our whole party!  And of course we had to pay gratuity.

I had to clear my mind of any bad reviews I read before my visit and looked at the dumplings without judgement.\\n- About half of the dumplings broke upon picking up. No, I did not poke them. For the price I paid, they have to be stable at the very least. I don't want my soup lost in the steam basket.\\n- The seasoning was on the blander side for the soup inside. The dipping sauce compensated a little bit for it, but the inside was just underseasoned as a whole.\\n- The tofu gan with sausage was shockingly small portion for the price. I guess I shouldn't have been surprised given the pictures on the menu, but still.\\n- The dish had the opposite issue of the xiao long bao. They were overseasoned to the point where I added more rice than I normally do to normalize the spice levels. It just didn't have the spice balance that I expect from Chinese cuisine.\\n\\nSummary: I really wanted to like you, XLB, I really did.

I've been to my share of high-end steak restaurants so I had high expectations. However would the restaurant have something suitable to eat for 2 small toddlers??  The answer is \\"yes\\" to my surprise they had a separate kids menu, and my niece and nephew happily shared a grilled chicken entree.  We started off with a few cocktails the Blood Orange Sangria I ordered didn't really taste like much pretty, bland so I wouldn't recommend it. The Hub Punch my sister's ordered which came in this cute jar was yummy and definitely worth the $14.  The 42 oz tomahawk steak that my father and I shared was delicious. The only complaint I had was that the waitress said the bone on the steak would be 5-7 ounces so we would get 35-37 ounces of meat.   When the steak first arrived it was pretty impressive. However once the chef cut up the steak we realize the bone was huge at least 15-20 ounces, for $85 that was a bit steep. Overall a great dinner but very pricey definitely a special occasion place."},{"name":"Island Creek Oyster Bar","address":"300 District Ave","city":"Burlington","stars":"4","text":"One of my favorite restaurants.

I'm glad we did because on Monday, there was a line and we didn't have time to wait. CASH ONLY.  I'm sure if there was a line, I wouldn't have been as happy, but ease of our experience and the great tasting donuts makes this 5 stars! We got the $24 dozen and had them chose. I ate a bite (or more) of each and throughout the rest of the trip, they stayed good and I nibbled on some every morning. It made my day. The box itself was cute!\\n\\nAtmosphere: 4/5. It's cute and neon-colored. I get a trendy/punky vibe from this place.\\nService: 4/5: Quick and efficient\\n\\nLet's move on to the stars of the show, the donuts. \\nDonuts: 5/5 Honestly, I was glad I had them pick, because I wouldn't have been able to. I would have shied away from the crazy looking ones. There were a few I didn't like in the box, but that was due to personal preference, not because they tasted bad. \\n\\nThey were each unique and actually very delicious. The donuts (old-fashioned and not) batter was good in and of itself outside of the craziness on top. If I didn't like the donut toppings, I'd just pick at the bottom because the donut was so fluffy and delicious. It would be impossible to list them out. \\n\\nNotables:\\n-They look awesome in photos! Be jealous, my friends of my beautiful box of colorful and crazy looking donuts!\\n-Grape-flavored donut (the purple one!) was so intensely strong so if you like grape-flavored things, get this! This was unique.\\n-Voodoo donut: So cute and unique. Tasted good too!\\n-Oreos on donut: My personal favorite! But then again, I also love cookies and creme ice cream.\\n-The old-fashioned batter (not chocolate) had nutmeg in it which I love!\\n\\nCons:\\nCereal was stale. Was that on purpose?\\nPeanut butter chocolate wasn't my taste preference\\nMaple Bacon was okay, but I'm not the biggest bacon fan. The bacon seemed old.\\n\\nDidn't think I could write this much about donuts... XD. I don't even like donuts that much, but this is something you can't find anywhere else (that I know of).

My sister was looking for Queso and chips, she was out visiting from Kentucky, where they are not graced with Chevy's but it's our thing when she comes to visit. They do not have queso and chips, and since she was there only for their salsa and chips, she ordered their hot wings, which surprisingly are good and not Mexican-y at all. This could be good or bad, depending on how you look at it.  I liked them because they weren't taste bud ripping off hot. \\n\\nI got the nacho appetizer to split with her, when she did decide she really did mean Mexican food and not run of the mill hot wings.

The parking is bountiful and there is easy exit and entrance here off Reynoldsburg - New Albany Road and Clark State.  I pass this location often and decided to finally stop in for a bite to eat and a drink. \\n\\nUpon entering we were greeted by a welcoming staff member who were eager to please. We sat at the bar amongst many others that we realized later were regulars. The indoor dining area was right next to the bar and I noticed many kids who sat with their families.  First impressions didn't strike me as the family friendly pub but I will go with it. I have heard from a few friends that the pizza and wings is great here along with the burger. I came with my husband and we settled on pizza and wings and wanted to save the burger as a second visit option. We drank a few cocktails while we waited and took the vibe in. There are plenty of TVs to catch your favorite sports game. They had golf, hockey and football on tonight.  The bar was very comfortable and a good size that it fit quite a bit of people without feeling cramped.  \\n\\nBack to why we came, pizza and wings. We ordered the 10\\" pizza ( size of a house plate ) that was full of toppings (we ordered a make your own with pepperoni,  sausage,  mushroom and peppers) The pizza was crispy throughout and a perfect size to share. It's not the best pizza I have had but not the worst.  The wings were a decent price (10 for $7.50) and they were meaty.  They were a little over fried for my taste and lacked sauce, even though the sauce was laddled on top. It was sweet not spicy like we thought. The name was spicy BBQ and I expected some heat.

More of an American bar/pub look than a German gasthaus. They do have some larger community-style tables you would see in Munich and other places in Germany, but that was about it.\\n\\nThey do have a nice selection of German beers on tap at fairly reasonable prices ($5-$7 for 0.5 liter). I usually order my go-to, Warsteiner Dunkel, but decided on the Weltenburger Barock Dunkel, a dark, robust beer that was quite tasty instead.\\n\\nThe menu is not big, but that is usually a good thing because ingredients are normally fresher. Their plates come in \\"Kleine\\" (small - $4-$9), \\"Mittel\\" (middle or medium -  $10-$16) and \\"Grosse\\" (big or large - $12-$23) with a nice selection of six or seven choices in each size class.\\n\\nMy wife would have gone with the Bretzel (pretzel - $5), but because I left her in Kansas, I ordered the Currywurst ($6), a sliced pork and veal sausage with fries and house curry ketchup in a small cardboard bowl (which I found a bit odd). What the dish lacked in presentation, it made up for in flavor and was quite tasty although not quite hot enough.\\n\\nTheir entrees include the classics, Sauerbraten ($19), Wienerschnitzel ($15), and, of course, my favorite, J√§gerschnitzel ($16) which I ordered. The seared pork loin was medium in size and the mushroom gravy (Hunter's sauce) had all of two button mushrooms on top. The cutlet was served on top of the sp√§tzle and red cabbage that accompanied it, not my preferred serving method. I love both sp√§tzle and German red cabbage, but J√§gerschnitzel should never sit on top of such an acidic and colorful side dish as red cabbage in my opinion. Sp√§tzle? Maybe. Red cabbage? Absolutely not! I have had all types of schnitzels in Germany, Austria, Slovenia, Hungary, and Bosnia-Herzogovina (as well as the U.S. and India believe it or not) and was never served on on top of anything. In fact, many times the sides (sp√§tzel, potatoes, vegetables) are routinely served family style in separate serving dishes, so the only thing on the plate is usually the schnitzel and it is normally massive.\\n\\nThe server was friendly and efficient although he never told me his name. I asked him about the size of the portions in order to determine whether or not I should order the currywurst and the J√§gerschnitzel and after telling me, I decided to order the currywurst. My beer had arrived in the meantime and I was in no hurry to go back to an empty house, so I savored the brew and starter, planning on ordering another beer when he took my entree order. Next thing I knew, the J√§gerschnitzel arrived much to my surprise. He must have misunderstood my intentions, but fortunately I would have ordered it anyway and had not changed my mind in the interim. I did not need the second beer anyway.\\n\\nParking is on the street only and a challenge to find a spot anywhere close, particularly for a disabled veteran. The currywurst could have been served in a proper dish or bowl, not something taquitos come in at a little league game. The j√§gerschnitzel should not have been \\"assumed\\" and absolutely NOT placed on top of the red cabbage. A little German ambience would also lend itself well to the surroundings, but overall it was a pleasant dinner.\\n\\nCombatCritic Gives Stammtisch 6 Bombs Out Of 10 ...

If I waited on the insane line I saw on a Saturday afternoon in the hot, summer sun for what must have been close to 2 hours, I probably would have been a bit angry. However, I seized the opportunity of a 3 hour flight delay and drove here right from the airport at 3 AM Saturday morning.\\n\\nAs a testament to the popularity and stoner appeal, the shop was still bumping at 3 AM. The line only reached to the door though, which is super lucky given the typical wait times. This is the perfect length for the line, as you need at least that little bit of time to adjust to the overwhelming, busy atmosphere, and to try to decide what to order from the sprawling menu of choices.\\n\\nMy excitement and hunger overruled my sense of judgement, so the two of us ended up buying 9 (!) doughnuts to enjoy at 3 AM.

The Bacon Maple Bar was one of the best of this kind I've tried - the bacon was so crispy and smokey, and the maple icing was really sweet. The Voodoo Doll, one of the obvious signatures, was also delicious, with a good coating of chocolate and some surprise jelly hidden inside. Finally, the Old Dirty Bastard will make you feel a cavity forming on the spot, but it's worth it: topped with peanut butter and Oreos, the overwhelming sweetness is delicious.\\n\\nMaybe they make a good fresh batch at 3 AM or something, because I didn't detect any hint of staleness that a lot of people have complained about.

We didn't consider coming here when we initially planned our trip but after hearing it was famous and a few people telling us to go we decided to make reservations and just do it. \\n\\nWe arrived and checked in. The place is really quite charming. You can tell it's an old building the way it is built and laid out. There were tons of people also waiting and a nice oyster bar in the front lobby area. \\n\\nWe were seated in one of the upstairs dining areas and were given cornbread and butter to start off with. \\n\\nSo this cornbread. I love cornbread. It was probably the best cornbread north of the Mason Dixon. It was moist which is a tough feat for most cornbreads and had the texture of homemade pound cake. It was a little sweet but I loved it. Plus 1 star. \\n\\nEverything went downhill from there. We ordered a dozen oysters to start. Now, this being an oyster house I expected a little more than what we received. A dinner plate with sloppily shucked oysters is what we got. They were good but I expect any fresh oysters to taste good. I was more disappointed with the technical side of things. Shucking was messy. There wasn't even any separation from the abductor so we had to work at it a little. Am I being a snob? I don't know. I just expected more from a place called an oyster house? \\n\\nI ordered the American bouillabaisse for my entree. Lobster, mussels, clams, shrimp, scallops, fish, carrots and potatoes in a saffron broth. It was okay. That's all I can really say. It was nothing to write home about. I could probably make it myself. I think my main issue here again is the disappointment. It is sad when the boiled potatoes are the best part of the dish. \\n\\nHubs ordered a sampler that came with oysters Rockefeller, clams casino, some shrimp, and some other cooked oysters done a certain way that I can't remember the name for. His dish was borderline inedible. The shrimp was about 10 minutes overdone and everything else was bland, greasy, and just not good. \\n\\nOur total came to about $150 which included two glasses of wine. One hundred and fifty dollars. A seafood restaurant that costs this much for two people should definitely be of higher quality. I would not recommend this place at all for dining. It's not worth the money. At best, stop in and look at the gift shop if you absolutely have to see the place but don't eat here unless you want to be robbed and left feeling disappointed and grossly underwhelmed."},{"name":"Korita Sabor Casero","address":"5800 NE Mlk Blvd","city":"Portland","stars":"5","text":"I've been here a few times now and everything has been top notch.

Your tastebuds will not thank you necessarily for the remnants for sale at the shop, waiting to be packed into a bright pink box with Baron Samedi striding about in all his inky glory. I should've sacrificed a Timbit to him first, shouldn't I? \\n\\nI joined a queue headed out the door on a rainy Portland night, which I'm no stranger to being from \\"big\\" Vancouver, Canada. February so often brings these drizzly nights where streetlights smear into a mash of neon orange on anthracite facades. I dutifully fed the ATM and received cash to cover a box of doughnuts, rather than pick just two or three. Excess is the rule here, not the exception. Considering I was flying out in seven hours, I suppose the doughnuts were intended to tide me over to the airport and through my flight back to Chicago. My perceptions were clouded by the multiple recommendations to get a maple bacon doughnut, because of its sinful excellence and the fact I am, as forementioned, Canadian. I don't care for bacon much but there is a degree of cultural expectation I have to live up to.\\n\\nThe shuffling line of zombies seeking sugary sustenance proceeded forward under laughing eyes of dim spectres. The shop plays up its vodoun origins to the hilt, and peeling photographs and magazine articles add just a lurid touch. You are entering an institution and you will not put a bird on it, you will wring a bird for it, if you must. I was eagerly anticipating a host of changing flavours, often predicated upon how bizarre the combination might be -- let's put tang with fruit loops on a chocolate doughnut; a kruller with hot sauce, chipotle, ground up Oreos, and simple syrup anyone? By the time I got through the queue, I was half-dead myself and ready to eat the suppurating tattooed arm of a hipster, if it came to it.\\n\\nI did get my maple bacon. The list of twenty some-odd flavours I wanted to try were gone. Each successive person ambling to the counter depleted the remnants and left me with the day's less desirable choices. Gone was ODB. Gone was a Dubble Bubble. One Memphis Mafia remained, one Captain my Captain, and NO Voodoo Dolls. I could've slapped down the two people in front of me who grabbed the last cock and balls, and proceeded to order thirty doughnuts from the stock. You could hear the sighs and growls in a chorus, damning their rudeness. People, it's late, they're not making any more, and the rest of us are waiting in the cold, cloying showers for our chance at a doughnut opportunity. Stop being a complete, self-interested douche. If you live here, you can come back tomorrow. Some of us can't. May Legba curse you with baggy jeans and cardigans! \\n\\nThe dozen doughnuts I had were as much candy as they were pastry products. Friends and I departing on the outbound flight in the morning decided to pick and choose with some assistance from the menu guide and the employee, and we ended up snarfing pieces from each at our liberty like kids set loose in Willy Wonka's labs. Fruit loops on blue tang frosting, orange shot Rice Krispie treat jumble? First rotted my teeth, the second redeemed my tongue. There wasn't one except for the maple bacon bar, which I scored one of the second to last of, that I consumed in full because post-wedding reception isn't the best time to be Voodooing it up. For large part, they're incredibly sweet or very cakey, and best to appeal to people with a sweet tooth. I am not the sort who purrs at the sound of chocolate. \\n\\nMistaken information from Portland International Airport suggested that we wouldn't be able to take our doughnuts with us on the plane, so I and my friend scarfed as many as we could and cursed fate. We abandoned our doughnuts in the trash, only to see at least four boxes on the flight back to Chicago. Needless to say, I was not impressed by that.\\n\\nVoodoo's drawbacks are obvious. Long lines and limited stock reap havoc for when you show up at peak hours, as I apparently did. Spending thirty minutes or more in a slow-moving line while taunted by the chalkboard menu knowing you aren't going to get to see at least half of them doesn't earn a five star rating from me. Combinations of flavours get downright nauseating for how sweet some of them are; avoid the ones with breakfast cereals and powdered juice mixes where possible. I also wish some of their sizes were smaller because this is too much doughnut for a sitting, though I suspect the price makes them meant to be shared."},{"name":"Voodoo Doughnut - Old Town","address":"22 SW 3rd Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"We fell on this place by accident.. but naturally we are donut people so it was a must! 24/7 what!!!!

One of them finally did (husband of Sarah A now E), and suggested that we double date.  He got us reservations since he said it gets surprisingly busy. He wasn't lying.  It was already mostly full when we got there around 7:15 on a Saturday. Sarah and Mark were already seated at the first booth and had the high chair waiting for little C.  They'd brought a bottle of wine (no corkage!), which was also already waiting.\\n\\nSince Mark used to frequent this place, we let him guide us.  We've gotten more savvy in our ordering of Indian (or Bangladeshi... which didn't seem very different from Indian to this untrained American) cuisine, so we did know enough to say which dishes we'd like.  We got the vegetable korma, chicken tikka masala, shrimp biryani, mixed naan, and one other that I can't remember now.  The gentleman taking our order was very persistent in trying to get us to get one more dish or something a little fancier.  Since I'd been warned about this in the reviews, and since Mark was doing the ordering, we managed to get by with only one of his recommendations.\\n\\nEverything was good, particularly the korma sauce.  So good that I didn't mind that the majority of the dish was cauliflower.  And while others have said that the portions were generous, I felt that I could have eaten another entree myself.

Weekend brunch times would not be optimal for this.\\n\\nMy only complaint is that their menu is more limited than I'd like. They don't have a wide variety for traditional brunch foods, which is why I always end up getting their (albeit delicious) tartines. They do have waffles and granola and such, but nothing particularly special about them.

He absolutely loved him, and was scared of most of the characters prior to this experience.\\n\\nThe food is served in a themed 3 course menu.  It starts with shared appetizers, and themed drinks which we enjoyed.  The wicked shrimp was my favorite, followed by the mushroom soup.  The pate was just okay in my opinion, and a little fancier then my taste.  My 4 year old even received her own veggie plate, which she really enjoyed.  She loves carrots.\\n\\nNow we were onto entrees... My husband and I both ordered the prime rib, mine was served allergy friendly, both were very good.  My daughter ordered the kids grilled chicken.  They even provided buttered pasta for my son who is only 2 years old.  Everything was fabulous.\\n\\nFinally dessert time... Everything was tasty and delicious.

Conversely however, I was not surprised that said good pizza was not NY Style, but rather this Midwestern Variety, Detroit pizza.  My wildly unscientific sociological research in the area has indicated the expatriate community here is very heavily made up of midwesterners, and decidedly quite scarce on New Yorkers, so it figures the pizza styles and respective quality would reflect such demographic.   I have spent time in Detroit and sampled the style at the chain Buddy's and some other spots so I knew it was square thick, and not altogether different from the Sicilian pies I grew up around on Long Island, albeit with more pie-like crust, deliciously carmelized at the edges.  Its savory and delicious qualities and suggests what I seek each time I am in Chicago and have yet to find each time I give its deep dish yet another try.  The baked, flakey and cavernous in crust wonderfully absorbs the flavor of the oil while cooked in the sturdy pans.  The traditional varietals pleased me the most but I was not at all mad at a pancetta and fig creation.  Like most Austin culinary institutions this one operates out of a trailer, or rather a few trailers at different locations, including this one in the city most hipsterish East Side as well as another in rapidly fratifying but tenuously still cool Rainey Street.

It's the kind of place that if you lived near it, you'd be thrilled and have no need to find a local pizza place to be \\"your place\\" any more. But it's not outstanding enough to warrant a visit if it's inconvenient for you to come otherwise (I say this because Armando's land on the Best of Boston pizza lists pretty often, and I don't think it's quite in the same class as the other staples of those lists like Umberto's or Regina). \\n\\nBut being the best local pizza place is no small accomplishment, and it's hard to walk away unhappy or unsatisfied after a deliciously cheesy, greasy meal here."},{"name":"The Paramount","address":"44 Charles St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"I will say that they had really good home fries.

Well be back!"},{"name":"Scales 925","address":"30 Ivan Allen Blvd, Ste 125","city":"Atlanta","stars":"2.5","text":"To understand how this place is still open is mind boggling to me. I must say the atmosphere and ambience is nice. Really put the effort in to be upscale. That's where my one star comes from. I was thrown off from the start tho. I forgot my phone in the car so I went back to get it, leaving my lady at the front to check in. Before I made it back, she was calling saying that the doorman was making her feel uncomfortable. Somebody is always hitting on her so I just told her I was on the way. He did apologize profusely when he saw me tho. No harm done, just need to realize he is working and that his actions reflect that of the business.\\nWe waited on the rooftop until our table was ready, that was nice. Upon sitting we had to wait close to 20 minutes to get a server to our table. We ordered water with lemon while we were still looking over the menu. This is where I say the restaurant menu doesn't match the atmosphere, well the prices do but the food doesn't. We ordered a bottle of Mo√´t Rose. That is the usual bottle I order when we go out. But tell me why this bottle was served at room temperature? The server asked if we would like some ice, but who puts ice in a glass of champagne? I didn't give her a hard time, figuring she was new or just not properly trained. Just feel that if you want to be a upscale place, you should give upscale training. If you read my previous review and pictures of Ruth Chris in uptown Charlotte you would see what real class is. No big deal about it, just know this place is gonna price itself out the market real soon. They didn't even have a sommelier or maitre'd serve the champagne to us. The waitress just poured two glasses and walked away. Maybe I am old school and use to having someone pour a little so you could taste and smell..no love here tho. I also ordered a grand marnier..for $23, I should've been served it the way it's supposed to be. Instead of a snippet glass it came out in a rocks glass with ice, even tho I didn't ask for ice. \\nNow to the food..I wish I could have a conversation with the chef. First I would ask , how could you call this upscale but you don't have the first steak on the menu? No filet mignon, cowboy ribeye, not even a NY strip? Come on. We ordered the crab cake and buffalo oysters. Charging $15 for a frozen crab cake ain't a good look either. Tasted awful. But they were better than the oysters. If you gonna drizzle sauce on a fried food, please make sure the fried item is crispy enough to hold the sauce without getting soggy. They were so soggy the breading didn't even stick to the oyster. The server asked why we didn't eat them, I told her we tried but I get queasy eating wet bread. $31 for two small appetizers that long john silvers would do better on. No biggie, trying to have a good time. She ordered the Caesar salad, and I ordered the gumbo. I have no earthly idea why the salad was served with tart lemons on it tho, along with store bought croutons, and the portion size was really small for $12. I asked if they had anchovies to go with the salad. The server said the chef said they don't use anchovies at the restaurant. Well that tells me you don't make your own dressing..can't make Caesar dressing without them. Must say the gumbo was tasty, even tho I could tell it wasn't made that day because of the slimy okra. \\nSo usually at this point we are pretty full. Still hungry tho..and maybe I have the wrong idea for this place. Maybe it's intended to be a nightclub. They have a 100 wine wine list but only 11 entrees to choose from. So if you don't like sweet potatoes or bbq or grits or peaches, you pretty much outta luck. I opted for the redfish, she got the braised short ribs. Hot dawg. $26 for a six ounce piece of the cheapest fish you can buy next to tilipia is a little outrageous. It was also frozen, just like the crab cake. It was blackened well..but the lemon butter on top was broken and separated. If you gonna charge that much, put some crawfish or shrimp Alfredo on the top, something to justify the price. The short ribs, fell way short. Maybe you should trim the fat before you cook them. There was more fat then meat. If you season them properly and let them cook long enough you won't sacrifice flavor and you will get a better product. And one last thing, unless you serving side items family style, you should really consider putting them on the same plate as the entree. Kinda gave me the feeling of a cafeteria, like Picadilly's, with everything being in different dishes. We got the bread pudding for dessert, would have been better if it was warmer. \\nHopefully, this place will get it together before it's too late. Could tell they didn't skimp on the building, just wish the menu was as impressive to match. I love to support black owned businesses, but I am gonna have to get on the website and check the menu before I return.. $263.48 plus a $55 tip for a meal that was probably worth $18 not including the alcohol is asinine."},{"name":"Super Hiro's Restaurant","address":"2585 W Broadway","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4","text":"Super Hiro Super Disappointing \\n\\n\\nI was deciding whether or not to write review but decided to write this in hopes that this establishment improves the structure of its business.  \\n\\nIt is a great identity storyline of Hiroki being the nephew of Tojo's.   The idea of Omakase is great however, the quality of the Omakase itself is another story.   \\n\\nOmakase meaning leave it to the chef.  I have visited several restaurants offering Omakase in Japan.   To be fair I have tried several Japanese Omakase restaurants located here also in Vancouver which I will not name but in comparison Super Hiro seems like a total bust.  \\n\\n1) The presentation of the Omakase is very simple and very boring.     There is absolutely zero wow factor.   It might be impressive if you have never had omakase in your life. \\n\\nThree elements of ingredients are consistent in Super Hiro's dishes.  A bed of mixed greens with mushrooms, meat, and fish.   Occasionally you will get fruit and some other seafood such as scallop in the mix as well.  \\n\\nThe omakase formula is mixing and matching the green with mushrooms with the meat, and the fish differently per course.    \\n\\nIt's the same theme per dish recycled in another angle!\\n\\nThe restaurant lacks a sushi bar.  The nigiri of the last course isn't very well handled.   The handling of the skill of nigiri is lacking.  \\n\\nThere is an attempt to be colourful on the dishes but its not working.  \\n\\n2)  The quality of ingredients is standard but nothing outstanding.    It is second or third tier not top of the line The fish and meat dishes aren't exotic or super top grade.    The portions of the dishes are small and you won't feel satisfied after the meal.    I was snacking on other food later in the evening when I got home.\\n\\n3) Ambiance wise is fair.   The atomoshere of the restaurant is nice. \\n\\n4)  Service is friendly and decent.   The occasional mistake of not remembering what the dishes are. \\n\\n5)  Other than Omakase there is no other choice.   The price for mediocre experience is $100.   There are much better options out there for $100.  It is definitely not worth it.   It is highly regarded as a disappointment. \\n\\nI mean no disrespect but the creativity, imagination is lacking.  No advanced technique in preparation of the dishes.  Omakase is supposed to make us feel special, make us feel excited, wow us with technique, presentation, and food quality making us want more.   Super Hiro fails to deliver any of this.    For now it is probably one of the weakest Omakase in Vancouver.   Perhaps in the future that may change."},{"name":"Broder Caf√©","address":"2508 SE Clinton St","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"I liked this really delicious Swedish breakfast spot.

The open faced sandwiches I had were good but not as authentic as one would have in Sweden or Denmark, the 2 places I can compare to Broder.  For the most part, what you can get in a Swedish breakfast  you can get here but not impressed with the fish and quality of dishes.

The food offered on the menu is so precious that it almost makes your mouth hurt. Which is probably a good thing, because the portion sizes are so small that I almost passed out from hunger on the way back out to my car. I had a cheeseburger, which they call a planche burger ($12 or $14).  It was laughably tiny. Nothing but a slice of cheese, beef (not bad, albeit miniscule), a bun, and some sort of vinegary secret sauce.  A lot like what you might get at White Castle. Speaking of vinegar, it's their little trademark, and they leave it everywhere like like an aggressive animal's trail of spoor. It's in the sauces, on the vegetables. It's even in the drinks. I tried my friend's mocktail and it tasted like a cut watermelon that'd been left out in the Texas sun for three days because everyone got so drunk at the picnic they forgot to clean up until mom finally made them.  We were told the $12 desserts were massive; big enough to share. Certainly they were larger than the garnishes to most desserts, but not by much.

I also had the crab cake sandwich with a side of tortilla soup. It was delicious all around. Having allergies, I miss calamari and so this fraudulent feeling of calamari via oyster mushrooms was particularly enjoyable. The crab cake sandwich was on par with many such vegetarian/vegan crab cakes that I've had. My friends who joined me also were happy with their food decisions. \\n\\nThe only things that prevent me from a 5-star rating may be price as well as that our host was strangely taking our plates out of the way well before we may have been finished with them.

Other observations from me and my group: the \\"bacon\\" on the Eggs Benedict was deemed too smokey; the Mussaman Curry was flavorful and on-point, especially for a non-Thai restaurant; the sweet potato tamales were tender and juicy, spiced with holiday-type spices, so any fan of pumpkin pie will love these; both the pinto beans and refried beans were awesome, and there's no way anyone would guess there's no pork fat in them; the collard greens were fresh, but not stewed long enough so were on the tough and pungent side; and all of the large breakfast tacos were a hit.

I was even more dubious to see \\"I HEART Sushi\\" on a big sign over the restaurant.  But my reservations were overcome by the lure of half-price special rolls, so we made the trek up to Dublin on a Thursday night.  The restaurant is in a corner of a strip mall, but easily seen because of the aforementioned signs.  There is a large Chinese buffet area inside the restaurant, which is deceptively large inside since it is in a corner.  \\n\\nWe were quickly seated by a cheerful young woman who, upon hearing that this was our first visit, inquired how we heard about the restaurant, and asked if we wanted the buffet or the sushi menu.  She explained the half-price deal on special rolls, and clearly explained what was included (which I appreciate given some experiences we have had at other happy hours).  She brought drinks and gave us plenty of time to look over the menu, which had a good three dozen types of special rolls, most of which looked greatly appealing.  I don't recall everything we ordered, but I made sure to get the Red Dragon roll since I remembered seeing it mentioned in a review here.  We also ordered salmon nigiri, which is our benchmark item for sushi restaurants.  Everything came in good time, although the waitress missed the nigiri the first time since it was listed on the back of the sheet.  The rolls were all excellent, with none of that worrying discolored or dried-out looking fish which often appears during sushi happy hours.  The nigiri was flavorful and tender.  Our total order of four rolls, the nigiri, and drinks came to just under $30, and we were stuffed.  On our way out, we were thanked and bid goodbye by no less than three staff members.\\n\\nWe will definitely return, despite the out-of-the-way location.  However, do be warned that this is a buffet restaurant as well as a sushi bar, so don't expect anything too fancy or intimate in terms of ambiance.

The De Pescado 5 Elementos with fresh fish in leche de tigre was so delicious!  You can taste the freshness on the first bite.  The Conchas a la Parrila are the diver scallops in brown sugar butter sauce with crispy onions.  This was palatable and flavorful.  The Acelgas was a flaky empanada with spinach, mushrooms, egg, and mozzarella cheese.  I am not a big fan of empanadas but this was sure toothsome.  I really liked the De Corazon which was marinated beef hearts with this very special spicy salsa sauce that was medium spicy.  I dipped everything I ate into that.  The De Pulpo grilled octopus with chimichurri sauce was also delicious, this was one of their known dishes that was pretty appetizing.\\n\\nThe two main dishes we had were the Arroz con Mariscos which was paella with fresh seafood like mussels, shrimp, white fish, scallop and octopus).

First off, I was very impressed with how good they are from a customer service perspective. My original reservation was for 5 people at 5:30pm but my boss added a last min meeting and invited two more people so I had to change it to 7 people at 6:15pm just hours before our reservation. They were overbooked and first said we'd only have an hour to eat then, which was not ideal. But then quickly called me back after rearranging some reservations so they could fit us in and allows us to enjoy dinner at a more leisurely pace. AMAZING!\\n\\nThey only seat when everyone (or over half the party) has arrived, so FYI. the front area by the bar was super crowded so keep that in mind when you come but honestly I think it just shows how popular the place is.\\n\\nIn terms of what we had...\\nDRINKS\\n-Cocktails (A+): lots of great choices, I had their Jasmin Manhattan - SO SMOOTH; my colleagues got the Lychee Martini (first time she had Lychee and loved it) and a Dark and Stormy (also great)\\n-Wine (B): not a huge list but I guess most people don't come here for wine? The others got a bottle of Sancerre which they liked well enough\\n\\nAPPETIZERS \\n-Fried Calamari (A+): Tasty and as you'd expect of a fried calamari dish but they also had some (I'm guessing Asian) capers which added something unique and a nice aioli pineapple dipping sauce \\n-Crab Wontons (A): Nice and large, creamy inside, tasty as well, like a more elevated version of Crab Ragoons you get at Chinese restaurants\\n-Fried Green Tomatoes (A): Great for our group that were from out of town, pretty traditional, no complaints\\nNOTE: we saw another table get the Fried Goat Cheese, which looked MASSIVE and super tasty, kinda wish we'd gotten that as well (next time!)\\n\\nENTREES .\\n-Seafood Curry (A+): I can't believe HOW much seafood they give you in this bowl! Not only was their mixed curry very tasty but OH MY so many goodies inside. Really wish I didn't fill up on appetizers b/c I couldn't finish my dish. And get the brow rice! Makes a great complement. NOTE: they also come with a vegetarian version which my colleague loved\\n-Chilean Sea Bass (A): 2 of our 7 got this dish and SCARFED it down. One said it was one of the best things she's eating in a very long time. The quail egg on top was a great touch. Highly recommend for all lovers of the great Chilean Sea Bass\\n-Lobster Fried Rice (A-): I had a bite of this and the fried rice seemed pretty standard. Tasty but I have super high standards for fried rice. You can't go wrong w/ a tempura Lobster tail though, that's what really makes the dish. Is it worth $37? Not sure, especially given how much seafood I got in the curry but I know 3 of our 7 liked the dish. It's massive though, so be prepared.\\n\\nFinally, the icing on top? Our waitress. She was AMAZING! Clearly passionate about her job, explained everything super well and we all commented on how great she was.

If you follow my reviews or have talked to me about food for more than one minute, you probably know this.\\n\\nWhen I checked in here, many of my friends were understandably nervous.  \\"uh OH, who drug you in THERE?!  You DO know it's TAPAS, right?!\\"\\n\\nYeah I did.  I was in the area and my first choice had some super-exclusive company event going on.  And, Andina was nearby and has Screen Door-levels of Yelp hype.\\n\\nWhen a place is nearing QUADRUPLE digits of reviews, and is STILL averaging 4.5 stars, I HAVE to try it.  I'd be doing everyone a huge disservice for not giving it a chance, right?\\n\\nWhen I first walked in, I was very impressed with the snappiness of the service; we were asked where we wanted to sit and seated immediately.\\n\\nI opened up the menu and...I was nervous.  HUGE, pricey, tapas section.  Only three international beers. \\n\\nOk,sorry, SIDEBAR: despite  what you may have been told, most beers from non-traditionally-brewing  countries are terrible.  Almost all of them are watered-down German/Czech lager knock-off's, much like our native Bud/Miller/Coors...but because they are from a place with temples and/or rainforests and/or studying abroad programs they are \\"exotic\\" and \\"good\\".  This is a huge problem found at many ethnic restaurants, including, but not limited to: Indian (Kingfisher!), Ethiopian (name escapes me), Thai (Phuket!), Chinese (Sing-Ha!), Japanese (Asahi SUPER DRY!), etc.  It is positively silly for restaurants in PORTLAND, OREGON to not at least have one local brew on tap.  Even worse is when the restaurant is themed as having a NW-inspired bent on traditional food and they STILL don't have any NW-styled beers.  \\n\\nOk, back to the review:  Andina only has three, mediocre South American beers.  My first thought was \\"well, guess I'm not doing any drinking tonight\\".  BUT, I decided to open my STUBBORN mind and be talked into getting a pitcher of SAN GRIA.  This is HIGHLY atypical for me but, you know what, it was AWESOME.  It tasted like those mythical clear gummi bears.  Y'know, the ones that taste the best but you can't quite place where the awesome flavors are coming from*?  When we finished it, I fished out the chunks of pineapple (which is apparently the flavor the clear bears are supposed to be, depending on your brand) out of the vase...I felt like a monkey stealing cookies out of a cookie jar but no one chastised me, which was good.\\n\\nI still was very skeptical of the menu.  Lots of things looked good but, having recently been burned by the micro-portions at Levant (June across the street suffers the same affliction, I'll get to them...eventually), I was highly skeptical that I was going to leave HANGRY, AGAIN.\\n\\nI browsed Yelp to see what the consensus was about what the GOOD STUFF to get here was...I didn't find much.  Then I found a glowing, 5-star review by Andrew C.  he said, and I'm paraphrasing: \\"THIS PLACE IS AWESOME EVERYTHING IS GOOD ORDER ANYTHING AND EVERYTHING I WANT TO GO TO HERE EVERY MONTH BEST PLACE IN PORTLAND\\".  I trust him more than anyone else on Yelp.  If he told me there was a garbage can on 82nd that was really good, I'd go for a dumpster dive.\\n\\nOk, cool, now I can order with CONFIDENCE.  Andrew C. reviews are gospel.\\n\\nI ordered the filet mignon; I forget the actual name on the menu.  It came with a bunch of other stuff I couldn't pronounce.  I just assumed it would be awesome.  I don't like asking wait staff what ingredients are (this is rarely a problem I will eat pretty much anything and everything) and I was no longer worrying about anything on the menu.\\n\\nOK, before the food came out, they bring you bread.  The bread was good.  But the SAUCE, OMFG THE SAUCES! SO GOOD.  They had mild/medium/hot and, while none were all that spicy, the flavors were fan-freakin'-tastic (medium had notes of clear gummi bear, FYI)!  I was impressed.  And they brought out a second round and weren't at all stingy about it, we didn't even ask.  THAT is how it should be done, like how a good Tex-Mex does chips n' salsa.\\n\\nThe food arrived and the portions were PERFECT.  The steak was probably the first truly-rare steak I have EVER had in Portland.  It was AMAZING and (tied with Black Bird Cafe in Bozeman, MT) was the best steak I have ever had.  There was a bunch of little side stuff on the plate as well, and it was all exotically and perfectly spiced, just freakin' delicious.  I was stunned.  \\n\\nAre you listening all you wanna-be fancy-pants Portland dining establishments?!  THIS is how you do it. \\n\\nOther things: our waitress was great, the ambiance was great (live music, warm light, cozy), and those alcohol infused gummi...I mean pineapple chunks, were great.\\n\\nA++ will dine again.

We enjoyed the lamb belly banh mi - full of flavor and a positive punch, but every other thing we ordered was off -- substantially.  For example, they tout their truffle pommes frites with triple smoked ketchup, so we ordered two to share as appetizers -- and they arrived limp and oily.  Braised short ribs were so tough that even with the steak knife we requested they were tough to carve into bite-size pieces.  Chop salad with phyllo threads was literally buried in the phyllo threads.  Our order of pasta with a lamb belly and a mustard sherry sauce felt glued together.

Being a completely home-bound recluse who doesn't go more than 5 blocks out of the house, I had to resort to ordering takeout. I decided to try out Tatsu Japanese Bistro, which is a Japanese place located on Commercial Drive. I ordered three of their special sushi rolls: Prosciutto, Bull's, and Lobster. I also got some food for myself, including their Kushiyaki Platter, Teriyaki Chicken, and Loco Moco. Although I can't say anything about the ambience or service, the food that I had received from delivery was quite solid. Their prices were also fairly reasonable. All in all, a decent place for some Japanese fare.\\n\\nKushiyaki Platter, 6 pcs ($13.95):\\n3.5/5\\nThis came with two skewers each of chicken, shrimp, and bacon scallop. My favourite was actually the chicken, which was tender, juicy, and very flavourful. The shrimp was a bit on the bland side. The bacon had a nice smoky flavour, although the scallop was (as expected), quite small.\\n\\nTeriyaki Chicken ($9.95):\\n3.5/5\\nI was a bit disappointed to see that the chicken didn't come with any skin. The meat was still tasty however, being tender and juicy, with a nice smoky grilled flavour. It was a tad on the bland side however\\n\\nLoco Moco ($9.95):\\n3.5/5\\nThis consisted of either a beef or pork patty (I picked pork) on rice, and is served with rice, a fried egg, veggies, and sauce. The patty was quite tender and juicy, and had a nice flavour. The egg was slightly runny in the middle. I did find the sauce to be a tad tangy however.\\n\\nProsciutto Special Roll ($11.50):\\nN/A\\nThis came with mango, avocado, cucumber, cream cheese and prosciutto. I didn't have this since I'm allergic to avocado; my mom quite enjoyed it though (she loves prosciutto).\\n\\nBull's Special Roll ($11.95):\\nN/A\\nThis came with ebi tempura, teriyaki beef, crab, cucumber, lettuce, and tempura crisps. I actually wanted to try this roll, but unfortunately it does come also with avocado (though not listed in the description). But my mom really enjoyed it; this was actually her favourite of the three rolls.\\n\\nLobster Special Roll ($15.95):\\nN/A\\nThis came with barbecue lobster meat, asparagus, avocado and cucumber. Again, I wasn't able to try this roll, but this was actually my mom's least favourite of the three.

Just to save yourself the headache and  your driver, have them drop off / pick up at the street at the end of the block, on Buckhead Ave NE. The restaurants entrance is in the alley vs facing directly street side. \\n\\nInside - A random assortment of decor meets wooden walls and furnishings. Though most of the servers are wearing western style button shirts, this isn't a Western / Texas type establishment. I.E. Longhorns. Two top tables, along the running booth seat are a bit cramped to each other. \\n\\nAmbiance - Not much of a separation between the bar and the rest of the dining room, so it's loud throughout. Even for a weekday evening. Aim for the patio if it's available. Dress code seems to be leaning more towards business casual as most parties just look like they left the office.\\n\\n[Service]:\\n\\nI had reservations but since the newbie Lyft driver F-d up, we were about an hour late. The hostess had no issues upon moving it later and we were promptly seated upon arrival, even with the restaurant pretty packed. \\n\\nOur server was also great; taking the time to advise on food and drink recommendations. As well as cooking temperatures for the former. He was well versed on the menu and food. I felt he was not pushy on  any menu specials. Food was brought out in timely manner and the temperature we selected.\\n\\n[Food Highlights]:\\n\\nAvocado Toast - (appetizer version) - I felt let down on this one - best way I can describe it, is someone smearing guacamole on slices of thick bread. \\n\\nBeef Tartare - I'm not fond of super raw foods because of texture, but my bestie loved it. \\n\\nPimento cheese hushpuppies - When you try to avoid cheesy fried foods, but this pops up on the menu. Tasty and the sauces add to the flavorings. \\n\\nSkuna Bay Salmon - We ordered this just in case The King wasn't going to be filling. I think very well cooked salmon was sadly just for munching on here and there. The included crab leg broken into pieces was ok, a bit overcooked and dry. FYI, you are given the choice of cooking temperature for the salmon. \\n\\nThe King - I'm a complete noob when it comes to American cooked bone marrow, but most of the inner portions weren't that much to really scrape off and smear on the included toast. The ribeye, was I honestly have to say one of the best steaks I ever had, and this isn't even really a steakhouse. The seasoning, the temperature, and pretty generous size was perfect. Darn that price though if it's not your birthday to treat yourself. \\n\\nToffee pudding - I wish we had saved room for this, but our neighboring guests played it smart and did not order appetizers. And therefore had room for each of their own. Jelly.

In this latest installment, I was on the hunt for a lobster roll.\\n\\nOn my latest trip to West Midtown, I went to go across the street to personally try to rectify a reservation I had later that night, and I needed something to make me feel better.  So what better place than to try The Optimist?  I had heard about it in a great article in Atlanta Magazine (http://www.atlantamagazine.com/restaurantreviews/Story.aspx?ID=1753698)- sorry not all pics posted that were originally in the article.  I also heard about it from praises from our Empress, and I know we share the same tastes- so I knew this would be a decent lunch.\\n\\nParking is easy, with a large (FREE) lot, so that was a huge plus (parking can SUCK in this area).  There is also a putting green out front as well, but I didn't come to play- I came to eat (and drink).   When I walked in (looking like a complete bum, as I just got off work and I had a black dirt mark on my forehead), I asked if I could sit at the bar (of course), and they told me to go to the next (bigger) room, as there are 2 rooms/2 bars.\\n\\nStaring at 3 panels of liquor, I was greeted almost instantly (as I was the loner at the bar, but in my defense, it was 2PM, they close at 230 for lunch).  I started off with a makers/ginger ale (at least I think I did), as I looked at the menu.  The drinks looked interesting, and I got 2 or 3 of them.  However, there is a drink called Swedish Fish, and let me fore warn you- it does NOT taste like the candy.  If you think so, you need to get your palette back on track.\\n\\nThe menu was somewhat pricey for lunch, but I ended up getting a cup of seafood gumbo and a lobster roll.  About the gumbo- one of the more interesting styles I have seen for a gumbo, the roux was spot on, with its deep color and wasn't burnt.  However, there was a sweetness to it I wasn't very fond of.  There was also 2 claws in the gumbo, that were ready to have the meat sucked off them.  It also came with garlic bread wrapped in twine.  \\n\\nBefore I go on about the $17 lobster roll, let me remind you how much I hate raw vegetables and plain mayo- lets just say I would rather ingest glass than eat that stuff again.  With that being said, the roll came with mayo and celery.  The meat on the lobster was some of the higher quality meat I have seen- it was cold and solid, not flaky by any means.  The bread it was on was toasted and buttered, and added to it.  It terms of the meat, that was some of the best lobster meat I have had.  However, the fries it came with to me, I was not a fan of- it reminded me of those potato strings (which I do love) you get at the grocery.  They were messy, and tough to use with a fork.  On top of a few drinks, I was making a mess (thank god I wasn't on a date).\\n\\nSince I was on a roll, I was offered dessert.  I knew the place was going to be closing soon, so I was shocked she offered.  I ended up getting an apple buckle- pretty much an apple dessert with ice cream and a cheese strudel.  That was actually my favorite part of the meal- I almost got another one.   \\n\\nAlthough the place closed at 2:30, the bartender let me keep ordering drinks, which was nice, but I tried to not wear out my welcome.  For soup, entree, dessert, and a few drinks, lunch came to $66 before tip, I thought I was in Disney again with those prices, but I thought for the most part, it was worth it.\\n\\nUnfortunately later on in the day, I got extremely dizzy for some reason, and it kind of killed my mood- not sure if it was from the gumbo, the roll, or that Swedish Fish.\\n\\nI can see why Esquire thought highly of this place (http://blogs.ajc.com/food-and-more/2012/10/05/the-optimist-named-restaurant-of-the-year-by-esquire-magazine/), and I would like to go back and see what else they have to offer.  \\n\\nMaybe I was getting withdrawls from dessert?!?"},{"name":"Papa Gino's Pizzeria","address":"748 Gallivan Blvd","city":"Dorchester","stars":"2","text":"Order delivery from this location pretty frequently.

So, since the kids were out of school for President's Day and Atlanta was expecting a pretty severe cold front to come through, we took the opportunity to travel into the city for lunch (knowing it would be a light traffic day).\\n\\n\\nTHE SCENE\\nYou may have saw in the news (about this time last year) when Atlanta had Snowmageddon. We aren't used to severe winter weather in the South and the city got caught totally unprepared as motorist were trapped in their cars for hours, some even running out of gas and becoming stranded. Others parked their cars on the side of the expressway and walked. There was even a case of a local Target opening their doors to feed stranded motorists and let them sleep for the evening. \\n\\nWell, we knew the city would NOT want bad press like that ever again, so we braved the cold temps and risked the threat of black ice with full expectation the city was not going to let anything like last year happen again.  \\n\\n\\nTHE EXPERIENCE\\nAlthough they have their own valet service, we were able to find a few street parking spaces just outside the front entrance.  The exterior is kinda cool, particularly the mini-golf course set up in the courtyard where they also host live bands in warmer weather. However, there were these rusty looking old school metal tables and chairs that looked like you might require a tetanus shot after sitting in one of them. I can confidently say no clean freak such as myself would be caught dead eating at those tables.\\n\\nOnce inside, part of the space looks like an old ice cream diner while the other space looks sleek and modern. A large expanse of windows bathes the dining area with natural light. However,  plenty of cool lighting also hangs down from the air hanger-ish ceiling. There is an open kitchen on one side and a long bar on the other with pleasing wood tones on the floors and tables in-between the two.\\n\\nWe found it interesting that both the hostess and our server were from the same Northern suburban county as we live. Seemed like a long way to come for work, but they relished in the idea of working for Atlanta's #1 restaurant (currently). Although I was highly tempted to switch to the Lobster Roll, I stuck to my original plan of getting the burger. It was ranked in Atlanta Magazine as #3 on the top 20 Best Burgers List. \\n\\n- - - - - - - - - - - - \\nT H E  F O O D \\n- - - - - - - - - - - - \\n\\nCHOWDER FRIES $13 | 4 Stars\\nIf you follow my reviews at all then you know I lean heavily towards being a traditionalist. But I am also easily amused when a kitchen can present a creative new twist on a food I love. These chowder fries were magically delicious. Smothered with bacon, clams, white cheddar and scallions, it tasted exactly as though you were eating French fries dipped in a rich, creamy chowder. I thought this was brilliant, but probably not something I would order very often. \\n\\nOPTI BURGER $13 | 3.75 Stars\\nThis is a great burger, but it's not a Holeman & Finch or Bocado burger. I found the Opti Burger to be a tad bit salty and I'm still undecided on whether or not I liked having my bun slathered with butter (NO PUN INTENDED). Seems like unnecessary calories. There is also something called come back sauce on the burger. Perhaps that was what gave it too salty a flavor. Whatever the case I found the burger to have just a little too much of something; still can't put my finger on exactly what it was. \\n\\nThe Opti Burger comes with heavily seasoned shoestring potatoes or a few alternatives for a small upcharge. \\n\\nCHOPPED CHICKEN SALAD $15 | 3.5 Stars\\nMy wife enjoyed this salad and actually ate more of the chicken than I expected. She is kind of a part time vegetarian, but occasionally will eat meat that doesn't taste super \\"meaty\\". She did comment that it was a tad pricey for the taste. \\n\\n\\nSERVICE was excellent with the only real issue being a wobbly table. Our server kept my coke glass filled and checked on us often. This was refreshing given the lack of service we've been experiencing as of late. \\n\\n\\nFINAL THOUGHTS\\nChef/Owner Ford Fry was in the kitchen today so I feel privileged that our food was exactly as he intended it to be. His Sous Chef was off today according to one of the staff, so we were happy to know our first visit would be in his capable hands. \\n\\nI must say I disagree with the Opti Burger being placed in the top 3 for Atlanta burger. It definitely deserves top 10, but I can think of at least 9 burgers I would prefer over this one. Good burger? Definitely! Overhyped? Most certainly. I'm torn between 3 and 4 stars, but in the end, they are closer to 4 stars than 3.

We headed over to the bar area, where we wandered around some more, before finally tracking down someone who said we could sit at one of the tables in the bar area. These tables had the weirdest seats ever. The bench portion is extremely short, so you feel like you are going to fall off at any moment, and the table is very, very close to the seat. \\n\\nOnce we were seated, our waitress, who was dressed as Rhonda Rousey for halloween, came over quickly and got our drink and food orders. We were able to get our beers, lobstah rolls, oystahs, and chowdah.\\n\\nThe clam chowder came out first. It did have some good chunks of chowder in it but was a little on the watery side for my taste. It was OK but not fantastic. The lobster roll was expensive, on a cheap roll, and had way too much mayo. Couldn't even tell you if the lobster itself was good as it was totally overwhelmed. Finally, the oysters were watery and bland and come only with horseradish and sauce, no mignonette, hot sauce, or vinegar.

The last time I used their app and after showing up 20 minutes later the host acknowledged they had missed the printout from their computer, so I waited.  This time I decided I'd call.  4 calls over 15 minutes and no answer.  Figured they were busy, so I gave the app another try.  Ordered at 530 and waiting 13 minutes for confirmation.  Emailed stated that my order would be done at 613pm.  I showed up at 605 because for an arugula salad and a GF pizza that seemed like a long time.  Plus there GF pizza isn't very good reheated.  Upon arriving the Host team seemed stressed and out of sorts.  There were 3 people at the front (why they couldn't answer the phone I have no idea) and what appeared to be a few upset guests that were being ignored for tables.  When I asked about my order, I was told \\"we have 10 more minutes\\". The greeting put me off, but no big deal.  I stood back out of the way and waited.

I couldn't help but think this was my order, but I didn't want to be that guy.  I waiting about 10 minutes and then politely reminder her I was waiting for an order for Sam.  She went straight to the kitchen and avoided coming back to the host stand.  All 3 people originally at the stand stayed away and bussed tables. There were several people waiting for tables that seemed annoyed so I chalked it up to them just being inexperienced and in the weeds.  Another 8 minutes go by and I notice one of the girls going into the small room and looking at the order that had been there since I arrived.  She then walked it over to me and handed me the order.  Ouch...I was upset but didn't see a point in bringing it to anyones attention.  The real bummer was when I got home and had a cold GF pizza and a wilted salad (it was sitting on top of the pizza box for 20 mins).  I feel bad for the young girls that worked there. They were in over their heads and lacked the confidence to deal with a situation that was spiraling out of control.  From now on I'll take my business to Audrey Jane's Pizza Garage. It's a little more casual, but they're extremely friendly."},{"name":"Reale's Italian Cafe","address":"13450 N Hwy 183, Ste 230","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Excellent food! I've been going here for about 16 yrs since moving to Austin from Boston, anyone who knows Boston, knows this where some of the best Italian food is found! It's not easy finding good Italian food in TX (or anywhere South)  I'm glad it's right around the corner from me! I bring my family here when they visit and they all love it. \\n\\nThe only thing slightly negative is that the pizza used to be a lot better before they expanded the restaurant. Don't get me wrong, it's still pretty good. It's not easy finding good pizza outside of the Northeast...I grew up eating pizza in the North End of Boston and NY city as well as all the local pizza pubs in MA that serve amazing pub style pizza, something you can't get here in TX anywhere, so I may be difficult to please when it comes to pizza! Reale's pizza is good, better eaten at the restaurant, reheated it's not quite as good. I've noticed that once a restaurant expands, the food quality drops, however, other than the pizza, everything else that we eat, is still amazing! \\n\\nThe staff and owner are very nice, restaurant is clean and they have an amazing Frank Sinatra singer.

It certainly brightened my day to know these young children are being unfurled into the working environment under this legitimately equitable (tradeable?) chain. I am thoroughly impressed with the attention in detail to the preparation of each ingredient with a nice theme carried through out; effortlessly. Effortlessly these young children prepared the beans so elegantly they didnt even need to be tender. Quite crunchy! Same with the rice it was like they knew less water makes for a sturdier carbohydratic dynamic in mouth feel. Temps were effortless cool with an emphasis of beating the heat. Ice cold sofritas and a barely warm tortillia, tepid enough to make me nostalgic for awkward high school prom dates.\\nWhich reminds me to comment on the elegant decorum of this location, sterile other than textual self promotion for work opportunities and benefits programs to keep you eager for a steady supply of chipotles from any of the many far spread franchise locations.

Last week, we phoned in an order for a pizza to go.  When I picked it up, I had opened the box to make sure it was the correct pizza and it was.  After paying for it, I drove home and we all took our slices to eat while watching a movie.  Except... something was not quite right.  It was a taco pizza but seemed to have sausage instead of ground beef??? \\n\\nI called Juliano's and confirmed that taco pizza should have ground beef.  I said it seemed like it was sausage on ours, but the person on the phone checked with someone and said no, it's ground beef. \\n\\nI wasn't really in a position to jump in the car and go back to the restaurant at that point, but since it wasn't really what we were expecting in a taco pizza, no one went back for seconds and we had quite a bit left over.  The next day, we had a decision to make: go back to Juliano's and talk to them about what happened, or skip it and probably never order from them again. \\n\\nWe got in the car, drove back there with the leftover pizza, and talked to a very nice person at the counter named McKenna.  As soon as we explained why we were there with a pizza to return she knew exactly what we were talking about.  Apparently they had run out of ground beef the night before, and someone decided (independently I guess) to substitute sausage.  But the manager didn't realize that's what had happened, and when I called, the person I spoke to had no idea this had happened either.\\n\\nMcKenna apologized profusely as did everyone else, and they got started on re-making our pizza.  They treated us to free drinks while we waited and upsized our pizza at no extra cost plus added a gift certificate for a free pizza in the future.  \\n\\nNow THIS was the taco pizza we were expecting!  It was delicious and so big it could feed our family for several days.  We were very glad we went back to Juliano's to give them a chance to make it right rather than crossing them off our list.  We were even happier that the staff went out of their way to fix it and were so friendly about it.\\n\\nThis is why it pays for a business to give excellent customer service.  We will probably order from Juliano's even more frequently now because they were so responsive.  So it's a win-win for Juliano's and for us.

They also give you a side of chips & salsa.\\n\\nThe burrito was close to $10, so it wasn't cheap by any means, but the portion was large & it tasted good, so I didn't mind splurging a bit.

Sadly, that tiny 4\\" taco with maybe 2oz of fillings also cost from $2.50 for the carne asada to $9 for the fish.  Not good.  I've found other establishments that have food that's just as good for a fraction of the price in the nearby area.  Shame too, because this one is right in town.  \\n\\nNow, I do want to reiterate that the food here is excellent.  There was not a single bite lacking in flavor, and they even added a few pleasant surprise ingredients I had to do the foodie version of a double take with.  But, I just can't forgive that price tag.  An afternoon snack should never be a double digit total when we're talking tacos.  I'm in the unique position of someone who has made food most of his life in varying quantities (i.e. a snack for myself at home, food for the family at gatherings, and in several restaurants and resorts), so I most definitely know the effort and work and love put into good food, but that's why I had someone else do the books and help define pricing.  If any cook in the world had their way, a good plate of food would be $100, minimum! But in the real world, that is never going to happen.  At least not without all around inflation and other economic factors that would make that $100 a reasonable option.  Rants aside, lower your prices.  I've heard about you for months now, and it ALWAYS comes with the dreaded \\"but\\".  I hope you read this and fix the one thing holding people back.

There are things on the menu that don't appeal to me as strongly as the above two dishes, and sometimes you're just not in the mood for certain foods-- like on a date you don't want to tackle the chicken wings, although they are finger licking delicious.

The appetizer was also below average. We started with what was called an antipasta plate.  It consisted of  a chicken-like pate that was dry (and you guessed it) salty. The portions were also very small. We had to ask for more bread slices to manage through the antipasta plate. Along with my entree, I had a cup of spicy Thai soup, which was just so-so.

But the food is so disappointing no amount of adorable Chinese Zodiac wallpaper/painting could make me ever return.  The big appeal--those ever elusive Xiao Long Baos---were really lacking in flavor and the skins too thick.  In the end, when it comes to xiao long bao, it all comes down to the savory/sweet meat broth flavor and ratio to the magically thin and delicate dumpling skins.  XLB did not deliver on either of those requirements.  We also tasted the garlic eggplant and tofu dish, because I love asian stir-fried eggplant dishes.  This one simply tasted as if it were drenched in a bottle of oyster sauce and not much else---far too salty and basic in seasoning/sauce.  Not the kind of delicious savory stir fry dish that makes you want to eat a giant bowl of rice.  Speaking of rice, they even served us rice that was far too dry (basically prepared in less water than ideal).  Rice quality in a chinese restaurant is pretty fundamental, clearly an indicator that this place simply is not hitting the mark on all points starting with the most basic parts of the menu, like a simple bowl of rice (we also dined right when the place opened at 5 pm, so this was supposed to be a new/freshly created batch of rice).

It is a loud place even when the live band is not playing. \\nA converted warehouse that is set up very nicely. Beware. If you sitting by the door in winter time. Wear a jacket. It gets cold each time the door is opened. \\n\\nThe staff is friendly. And very attentive. The food is cooked very well with lots of flavor. I had the Bar steak. I asked for med well and med well I got. The string beans and mash potatoes were good too. \\n\\nBeing my first time at this establishment. I think many would enjoy this as well if you happen to find it. \\nIt is Valet parking only. So it is wise if cold to have someone get the car 5 mins before you head outside if it is cold."},{"name":"It's Italian Cucina","address":"1500 South Lamar Blvd, Ste 110","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"This place was pretty good. Our waiter seemed to be a little bored because he spent a lot of time coming back to check on us which was a little annoying. The wine we had with dinner was delicious! Probably the best part. The food wasn't as good as I expected but that's what happens when you come in with high expectations. I'd go back for happy hour cocktails and a snack."},{"name":"Voodoo Doughnut - Old Town","address":"22 SW 3rd Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"Grandma sure likes her sweets. Doughnuts. Ice cream. Butterscotch hard candies. The strawberry hard candies. \\n\\nUnfortunately, what this place lacks in taste, texture, and quality, they do not make make up for in creativity. \\n\\nI don't understand why the line is so long. I walk by and people and lined up. Also, the business is cash only - which just screams illegal food or other monkey business activity. But I don't judge, the economy is bad for people who don't have money. \\n\\nOne thing I did appreciate was the chocolate milk. Brought me back to when I worked as a lunch lady. I would deliver alpenrose tiny milks to kindergartens classroom. \\n\\nMy stupid grandson Steven got the cock in balls. Absolutely disgusting. Can't believe he paid money to eat a doughnut shaped like a *enis. It's okay because we accept him for who he is. Even though I grew up in a different time, I still have to adapt to the current times.
