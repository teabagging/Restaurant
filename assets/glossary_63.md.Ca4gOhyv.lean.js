I think I may have made a few inappropriate sounds consuming every bit of this dish. On Crystal's excellent recommendation, I had the scallops with roasted cauliflower, fingerlings and mussels. My boyfriend had the steak which was cooked perfectly and crusted in peppercorns. We also enjoyed the fried leg of quail, crispy on the outside and so tender and moist.

I had to settle for vegetable korma with a few pieces of paneer floating around and plain basmati rice-- both of which were great but compared to the spread I see at most buffets, no biryani or paneer was a glaring omission. Some better naan would have been appreciated as well. Don't quote me on this but I suspect they use a pre-packaged naan that's heated on the stove-- not made fresh in a tandoori oven. It's passable but nothing to write home about. \\n\\nThe service though is outstanding! The staff are very friendly and constantly checking on tables ensuring you're never out of naan and water glasses are constantly topped off (a must for Indian cuisine). \\n\\nOne of our waiters in particular noticed the constant ribbing I was getting from my east-Asian dining companions and came over to tell me he could relate.

For a party of 2, expect a bill right around $100 followed by another $30 when you go to your local Thai joint for your 2nd dinner.\\n\\nThis place misses all the marks - it tries hard to be one thing or another, but ends up falling short in the middle and being lackluster at everything. The Avanti experience is like buying a Porsche with a Corolla's engine inside. It sets an expectation of fine dining mixed with the casualness of a Chili's. I know putting a small amount of food in the middle of a large white plate with artfully drizzled sauces is supposed to make me feel.. fancy or something; however I still couldn't help but feel a little bamboozled as I grazed on my cold salmon, staring off in the distance at the Wells Fargo across the street, while questioning my life decisions.\\n\\nSure, you can try to get away with calling this a bar first and a restaurant second (I'd be more forgiving if that was the case). It is true that a third of this place's layout is a bar, and the normal dining tables do indeed feel like an afterthought. However, the other reviewers of Avanti are using words like \\"fine dining\\" and \\"upscale\\" - it's just not the case here. \\n\\nSince this is a newer place and some of the issues may get worked out eventually, my right hand is clicking 3-star, while I ferociously hold the rest of my body back from wanting to click 1-star.

The waffle, which I think is often neglected is sweet and nice and compliments the chicken super well. Big southern portions, I had only 1 chicken and thought it was plenty.

The burger was not what I expected and I wasn't too pleased with the flavor combinations (I was excited for a house made burger). The nuggets were absolutely disgusting-I thought they would be like crispy Tempe because I saw a picture on here but these nuggets were like nuts and or lentils stuck together with a gum paste of some sort?

We're in the Pacific Northwest after all, just a hop, skip, and a jump from the coast....so we figured the fish & seafood must be fresh and way better then what we get in land locked Chicago!! And Jake's did not disappoint.\\n\\nWe had reservations and were seated within a few minutes of arriving. This place is deceptively large but I would still recommend making a reservation as it was packed full on a Thursday night (bar area included). Our waiter came over right away and instantly won us over. He was helpful, chatty and genuinely friendly (we left with a napkin filled list of must do's/sees/eats in Portland - now that's going above & beyond as a server). \\n\\nWe started off with a bottle of Pinot Noir. We are in Oregon after all, so it would have been almost sacrilege to not have our first glass of wine be a Pinot. After perusing the large and somewhat intimidating menu (seriously, so many amazing sounding fish & seafood options to choose from), we decided to start off with a combination platter of oysters - all local to Oregon & Washington. Not one of the 3 of us even new if we'd had or would like oysters, but they are such a prominent part of the menu, that we figured if there was any place to have our (probably) first taste, it was at Jakes. Were they a hit? Well, lets just say 2 of the 3 of us were not a fan. I think it was more the texture then the taste for them though. Personally, I loved em! We had four varieties and only one I wasn't super fond of. The others I thought were super fresh & delicious. \\n\\nFor the entrees, we each got something different with the idea that we'd share. First up was the macadamia crusted wild halibut with a pineapple salsa. This was the least favorite - which by no means does that mean bad - it just couldn't win when compared to the other two dishes. Personally I love halibut and I enjoyed the crustiness of the fish combined with the sweet salsa. Next was the rockfish sauteed with olives, feta, tomatoes and basil. Delightful! I love fish sauteed with tomatoes & basil but never thought to throw in olives & feta and make it 'Greek-like'. The flavors worked well together and this was the clear second favorite dish. Finally, the crab leg saute with artichoke hearts, mushrooms, shallots and of course, butter. OMG - this was a plate of rich, meaty crab legs like I've never had before. I loved the addition of the artichokes & mushroom - two of my most favorite things. I can see why our waiter said this is one of the most ordered dishes - it was the clear winner at our table. I may or may not have dreamt of crab legs while drifting off to sleep that night.\\n\\nUnfortunately we were all in a bit of a fish & seafood induced coma so dessert was not in the cards for us. We all left stuffed to the gills (pun intended) and oh so happy that our first meal in Portland did not disappoint."},{"name":"Border Caf√©","address":"32 Church St","city":"Cambridge","stars":"4","text":"I'm from California.

If I have a day off work, I'm perfectly happy to sit home all day in total silence, messing around on the internet or doing crossword puzzles.  So the idea of a restaurant where the owners chat you up as you eat didn't exactly appeal to me.  But I felt comfortable as soon as I sat down in the warm, cozy environs of Bono.  By the end of the meal, I had helped the owner to complete a crossword puzzle, and we had learned all about her and her husband's past, from his 20 years in Italy to their former pizza shops in Delaware... and I loved every second of it.  They even let us sit behind the pizza oven and watch our za being cooked (it only takes 2-3 minutes).\\n\\nThe food!  I've never been to Italy but I'm guessing this is exactly the kind of pizza you'll find there, from the crackly, light crust to the fresh, imaginative combinations of ingredients.  My favorite was the Puttana, obviously based on puttenesca sauce, with olives, capers, artichoke hearts and hot peppers.  Altogether, my wife and I ate two full pizzas and part of a third, and we still had room for a Belgian waffle with strawberries, Nutella and whipped cream.   The quality is just something you don't find around here.  Especially not in the corner of a dingy convenience store.

Unfortunately, our experience was completely ruined by a terrible bartender.  Upon walking in on a Friday night and snagging a couple of seats at the bar as a couple was getting up, we were promptly ignored by the bartender, who noticed his friend walk in, and began shouting to him and chatting him up as if they were on an episode of Jersey Shore - yelling and screaming at one another.  All with his back turned to the rest of the bar and all of the patrons.  When he finally did give us menus and my girlfriend asked for a recommendation, he immediately quipped a drink without asking a single question of my girlfriend's preference of spirit, taste profile, or anything.  For a place that bills itself as a high-end spirit destination with knowledgeable staff and an extensive selection of spirits, this is highly sub-standard.\\n\\nAfter ordering our drinks, the bartender had to repeatedly ask the one on the other end of the bar what was in the recipe for my drink.  Again, for a place that bills itself as a high-end destination, for the staff to not know what's on their own menu is weak.  Then I proceeded to watch him douse my drink in this raspberry syrup stuff, making me afraid I was going to get a sugarbomb drink with virtually no alcohol.  Well, I was right - it was indeed a sugarbomb that I absolutely could not finish because of the sugar-induced headache I got after 10 minutes.  I can't fathom this drink was made correctly, this tasted like something you'd expect to find on the menu at a sports bar, not a lounge that features a $100 cocktail.\\n\\nDuring our short time, this guy was obnoxiously clowning around behind the bar, yelling and screaming to his friend that showed up while ignoring the rest of the bar, dropping sugar down the shirt pocket of another member of the staff - generally acting like he wanted to be fistpumping at Ned Devine's instead of behind the bar at a high end cocktail lounge.  We even heard him chatting with two girls next to us at the bar and blatantly stating he doesn't like making cocktails, and would prefer to be working at a club making vodka sodas to make quick tips and meet girls.  That explained a lot, my drink tasted like it was made by a guy who made vodka sodas.  In short, this guy should be working at Bro Bar Central opening bottles of Bud Light and mixing rum and cokes, not making $14+ cocktails at a classy high-end lounge.\\n\\nNote to management - how do you open a cocktail-driven lounge and hire someone who does not want to nor like making cocktails?!\\n\\nWe left without finishing our first round, as it was too busy to move to the other side of the bar, where the bartender at least appeared to be far more competent.  I would absolutely come back and try the place again, as I've been to BNV's other bars, know a couple of their bartenders, and this guy is absolutely not an accurate representation of their standards.  A couple of their bartenders from Forum (one who works also at W&N) rival the best I've encountered around in other high-end lounges in LA, Vegas, etc.\\n\\nThe aura of the place was cool, the decor was inviting and intimate with shades of old world gold and brown mixed with some deep reds - this could definitely be a great date spot or place to come with a small group.  The cocktail menu was extensive and seemed interesting (didn't get a chance to look much further as the menu was taken away from us after we ordered our first round - way to get us to want a second drink!)  So, there's a quality concept here that's executed well in many spots, but the overall experience for us was all but ruined by a moron behind the bar.  Fix this, and this place could be a real winner.  I look forward to trying it again, but if this guy is behind the bar when we walk in, I'll probably turn around and leave."},{"name":"Seasons & Regions Seafood Grill","address":"6660 SW Capitol Hwy","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"Within walking distance to our home.

I was very disappointed with the menu- I expected more variety. I really wanted a pulled chicken sandwich. Well, that wasn't an option so I got a pulled pork sandwich. I wasn't excited by the taste of the BBQ sauce. The rum baked beans were terrible, but I forced myself to eat them. The mac and cheese wasn't very appetizing either.  There is seating inside and out, but there is not good outdoor seating for a large group (as simple as 6 people- we had to squish).  They bring the food to you which is great.

I had a terrible experience here for dinner several months back, but since I live in the neighborhood, I figured I'd give it another chance. Never again.\\n\\nCame here for Sunday brunch. It wasn't busy, which I typically don't consider to be a negative sign during brunch because 1) with very few exceptions, the popular wait-an-hour-for-bacon-and-eggs places are vastly overrated, and 2) how hard is it to make bacon and eggs, anyway? \\n\\nTurns out, the place wasn't busy because, evidently, the word is out about their terrible brunch. Must've been in the issue of the neighborhood newsletter I missed. \\n\\nSat down, grabbed menus, our waiter stopped by and we told him we needed a few minutes to look over the menu. Then, he just up and disappears for 15 minutes. Nowhere to be seen, just 'poof' into thin air. Finally, he rolls by, takes our order (salmon and bagel for me, medium rare steak and eggs for my fiancee) and then we wait. And wait. And wait. Then, after 30 minutes, we waited some more. I flagged him down and said, \\"Hey, any update on our food?\\"\\n\\nHe replies, \\"Uh... it'll be out shortly.\\" Then he proceeds to \\"check on us\\" two more times in the next 15 minutes. And by check on us, I mean he awkwardly hovered around our table while not really doing anything. a full hour after we order, our food comes out. The salmon and bagel is okay, but you have to assemble it yourself. Fine, whatever. But my fiancee's steak was grey, cold, and overcooked. Just an inedible piece of food.\\n\\nI flagged down the waiter, he brought her a side of bacon and some eggs instead, and that was that.\\n\\nNow, normally, I would have brought the manager over and complained. But this is the second time in three meals here that the service has been a disaster. We complained the first time and the owner gave us a modest gift certificate (not enough to cover a meal for one), but clearly things have not improved.

We were the only customers in the shop and were greeted when we walked in. My 4.5yr old daughter was very excited as this was our first time here. When we approached the display case, the employee dryly stated they were out of two of the cupcakes, which was quite confusing since the case showed full trays of those varieties. The employee didn't elaborate. My girl was having a hard time understanding she couldn't choose one of the cupcakes she could easily see in the behind the glass. The employee, right above us, standing behind the case, still didn't elaborate. Finally after the third time explaining to my girl about the cupcakes she couldn't have, the employee says to me \\"they're old\\". Uh. Ok. \\nOne cupcake variety wasn't mentioned on their menu so I asked about it. The employee, who now had her head in the case rearranging the sign on the full tray of old and unavailable cupcakes, answered but I couldn't hear her. I had to ask to repeat as she never emerged from the case. The crooked sign of the unavailable items was much more important. We finally chose two different cupcakes. The Double Dose and Sweetberry, which aren't retrieved from the counter but a storage box on the side. After I pay, my daughter sees the tip jar and asks what it says. I tell her it says \\"I work for tips!\\" and explain what tipping is. She's excited to try tipping so I reluctantly give her $1. The employee says nothing. \\nFirst, I ask the employee if they have forks. She looks up from a phone or maybe a laptop behind the case and says \\"No\\". Oook. I then realize that we forgot to wash hands after playing at Phil's. I ask if they have a restroom where my girl can wash her hands. She looks up again, \\"no\\", looks back down. Riiiight. No wonder this place is dead though being within walking distance of a place that kids and parents alike swarm to. \\nWe walk back to Phil's where they have no problem giving us forks. We wash our hands and eat our cupcakes. Only to have blah cupcakes. The Double Dose was alright, but I've had just as good from HEB for a fraction of the price. The Sweetberry was gummy and the cake tasted artificial though the frosting was good. \\nAll in all, I don't care if the cupcakes tasted fabulous.

Of course it took me a couple of years and the excuse of my Boyfriend's birthday to finally get there, but I got there. \\n\\nWell, I have to say that they have cornered the market on delicious bread sticks... Pillsbury Dough Boy, you best be getting you doughy little rear in the test kitchen and put the shit in a can! They get a whole star, well actually 3/4 of a star; the minestrone was delicious though a little bland (a little bit of pepper never hurt anyone people) so it gets the other 1/4 of that star. \\n\\nThe other star is for our waitress. Tina or Trisha, something like that. Though a bit scattered she remembered our orders without writing them down. A bit delayed on the drink order, but she apologized for that. Always smiling and perky, even with the screaming babies both at the booth behind ours and a table about three tables away. Also played off the fact that they ran out of straws, and salad tongs, so that the patrons did not get angry. I could tell that she had been doing this for years, but she didn't seem jaded, like every other server in the place. \\n\\nThere were a few things that surprised me about the place however: \\n\\n1) Any \\"Italian\\" restaurant worth its salt can make espresso. I love espresso and have fallen into the habit of ordering it at the end of a meal. The espresso that I had here was burnt. I have no idea how you can burn espresso, but this place figured it out. Congratulations Dorchester Olive Garden, you now have a tick mark in my \\"Suck at Life\\" column! \\n\\n2) The water was chlorinated. I don't think I need to elaborate too much on this. Docrchester Olive Garden, a little tip for you; When a patron orders water, do not use the dish washing sink to fill the glass. \\n\\n3) It has been my experience that, upon leaving a restaurant you should not have the immediate and dire need to use a restroom. And I know that it was not just me, my boy also had this issue. This type of response to your food does not really garner \\"recommendation\\" status.

Some people went to cocos cafe next door to get bubble tea while their party waiting in line, seemed like a great idea. \\n\\nAfter over an hour wait, we finally entered the door. The decors are pretty cool and has some hip vibe. AND there was a line inside as well to be seated and order. Damn! Note you have to order at the counter first before you get a table. Since the restaurant is so popular and crowded, you have to share a table with others if you are unlucky. \\n\\nAfter more waiting, we finally sat down. A few minutes later, we got our ramen. I ordered #2. I have to say this bowl of ramen was nearly as good as the ones I had in SF, LA and NYC. The broth was definitely equally good, of course I drank it all. The pork and egg were so tasty and mouth watering that I wanted more! The only thing I'd improve is the noodle but it was pretty decent as well. \\n\\nSome reviewers were comparing this ramen to the instant ramen you get at HEB and some were comparing it to pho. To those people, I feel embarrassed for you. \\n\\nNow i am switching to the critic mode. First of all, the restaurant was lack of service due to the fact that it was so busy. I felt I was being rushed to eat then leave. I am pretty sure every customer likes to take time to enjoy their food.

I was hesitant to come because the reviews aren't that great and there are so many great choices to choose from in Boston. \\n\\nNot to my surprise, the service started off shaky and we felt rushed after finally getting seen. For a fine dining establishment, we have higher expectations. It took forever to get greeted, our drinks took forever and although we'd asked for bread, we couldn't even follow up with our server as he was nowhere to be seen. It was a good 20 mins and tables next to us that sat after us were getting everything before us. It was a busy night and there was a table of at least 20 next to us so it's beyond me why they even sat us in that section.\\n\\nThe only reason this night turned around was due to the manager Jacqueline. She came up to us, apologized and personally made sure we were taken care of the rest of the night. The food that came out was hot, fresh and delicious.

WOW! \\n\\nWithout a question, the best barbecue food that we have ever had anywhere in the country (including Texas, Kansas City, St. Louis, North and South Carolina). Few restaurants in this world meet or exceed the hype bestowed upon them and Franklin blows by all expectations.\\n\\nPrior to our visit to Franklin, we did some research on the best days and times to arrive so we can get our meat fill on, and I would highly recommend you do the same. The stories are real and the line DOES start early, even on the \\"least\\" popular days, if there is one. We came by on a Tuesday morning at 8am, which actually wasn't that early, and we were the 20th and 21st people on the line. There were still plenty of parking spots in the parking lot in the back. Throughout our wait, the mood was actually very positive amongst everyone as we were all in the same boat and we engaged in some chit chat with fellow linemates. When ended up coming to know that the 1st person on the line had been there since 6:30am. Some might wonder what's the difference between #20 and #1, but #1 definitely has its perks as I will mention later on.\\n\\nWhat really made the wait bearable was the fact that a staff member came out to greet everyone. On top of it, she informed all of us that they had foldable camping chairs for anyone who needed them and that their doors were already open to customers who needed to use the restrooms, get some water, take pictures or for anyone who wanted to buy any merchandise. As the opening time of 11am approached, the line grew exponentially to beyond the dine-in parking lot into the pre-order parking lot. A waitress actually came out to ask to gauge what everyone was going to order so that they knew what was going to run out by when. Bottom line, you can tell they knew the drill and were pros. FINALLY, the clock struck 11am and we all began filing in. The wait was over! There were very few times in my life I had felt this level of anticipation eating anywhere. Minus the dress code, I felt like I was about to walk into a landmark establishment the likes of The French Laundry. In fact, in their own realms, they are their own very special experiences.\\n\\nWithin about 20 minutes of stepping foot into what I would hope heaven is like, we had ordered our food. Being that it was our 1st and potentially only time visiting, we had no choice, but to go ALL OUT. The menu consisted of the typical meat by the pound option of brisket, pork ribs, sausage, turkey and pulled pork. There were also a few sandwiches and 3 sides offered, potato salad, slaw and pinto beans. So when I said we went all out, we held nothing back and ordered 1 lb of brisket, 1 lb of pork ribs, ¬º lb of turkey, ¬º lb of pulled pork and 2 sausage links. Whewwww. Also, we ordered a single potato salad, single slaw and single pinto beans. If that wasn't enough, we were sucked into also getting the bourbon banana tart pie for good measure.\\n\\nAs a side note, as we approached the counter to order, who else, but the man, the myth, the legend - THE Aaron Franklin - came out to greet and take photos with the 1st few parties that already got their food as they settled into their seats at tables. So, like I said, there was a major perk to being one of the first five parties in line.\\n\\nOK, so the food? The food truly tasted different and better than any barbecue restaurant we had ever been to, period. The brisket was so fatty and juicy and the flavors with each bite hit the spot. It was remarkable how amazingly good it was compared to other renowned restaurants. The pork ribs were phenomenal. The seasoning on top of the skin was delicious and added a nice kick to it. The meat on the bones just fell right off with each bite of tender goodness. The pulled pork, which can sometimes be dry, was anything but that. There was so much flavor in it and I loved that it was just as juicy as anything we just ate. \\n\\nThe one big surprise was the turkey. We typically shy away from chicken or turkey at because it's always dry, but my God. We couldn't believe how good it was. It was juicy and smothered in their oils. Lastly, if I had a knock on the restaurant, it would be the sausage. It was tasty and good, but it was a bit chewy on the outside. It was tougher than we thought, but nevertheless it was flavorful like everything else. And that bourbon banana tart pie? If you still have space in that every expanding stomach after this meal, get it! You won't regret it.\\n\\nWas it worth the 3 hour wait we endured? ABSO-FREAKING-LUTELY. Typically, after such a large meal, I'm sick of that cuisine, but I wanted to come back the next day and have some more! Barbecue will just never be the same for us. When I say it was a special occasion, it truly was. The waiting, the service, the food. Everything about Franklin's is a perfect example of a well-oiled machine. Believe it or not, it was truly a life-changing food experience that will be etched in my mind for a long time - THAT'S HOW GOOD IT WAS."},{"name":"Screen Door","address":"2337 E Burnside St","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"Screen Door has been one of my favorite restaurants for years.

I'm the go to person in my group for restaurant / bar recommendations and without giving it a second thought recommended Cypress Street Pint and Plate in Midtown for a recent group outing. I had been to Cypress Street Pint and Plate before, and thought the food, service and atmosphere were all decent. Did I mention we were taking an out-of-towner here?\\n\\nI'm guessing this must be an after work crowd that frequents Cypress Street Pint and Plate, because for a Saturday night, it wasn't nearly as crowded as I would have expected it to be. It was by no means deserted, just not very crowded for a midtown pub.\\n\\nIf you've not been to Cypress Street Pint and Plate, there is the centrally located bar which is surrounded by booths that would accommodate groups of 4 to 6. There is another room off to the side that accommodates large groups, which we were seated in. It was absolutely FREEZING in here the entire evening. Most of us kept our coats on the entire time as it was too cold to take them off. Not exactly how you want to spend the evening. And I don't know what was going on with the smell but there was a highly offensive smell on one side of the room (like a baby's diaper). And there weren't any babies or kids in the restaurant.\\n\\nCypress Street Pint and Plate's beer selection is ok, but by no means the quality of say a Taco Mac or Porter Bar, but not bad I suppose. Along with about 9 beers regularly on tap and a selection of beers by the bottle, Cypress Street also offers 5 beers on tap that change out weekly. They have a menu of these on their website, but it is not updated regularly, and neither is the food menu. Of the 5 beers that were on the list, they were out of the one and only that I and several others in the group had our eye on.\\n\\nWe started out with some appetizers - french fries, onions rings and hummus. The price is small and so are the portions. Five bucks each for both of these options. Don't worry about filling up on these if you are in a group, it's just not gonna happen. You are really better off saving your $ and ordering sandwiches or entrees rather than apps. Sandwiches come with your choice of a side and are plenty filling.\\n\\nThe food seems to be reasonable, except for their highly touted meatball sliders. These were awful! I forced myself to eat 2 but just couldn't eat the third, it was disgusting. The description sounds so good - meatballs (how do you screw those up?), caesar dressing, arugula, parmasean cheese. The taste (which I find difficult to articulate) was terrible and at 9 bucks for 3, hardly a bargain.\\n\\nReally none of the sliders are are bargain. I've also had the buffalo chicken sliders and although these were tasty, I just don't feel justified the $3 a piece. It would be nice if you could mix and match as they have cod, shrimp and chicken as well, but unfortunately you must order 3 of the same for $9.\\n\\nOthers had burgers and sandwiches which I sampled and thought were quite good. The Philly Cheesesteak, Maytag Burger, and Chicken Picatta Sandwich were the highlights of the evening. At about $9 a piece these are a better value as the sandwiches alone offer more in terms of meat / filling than a slider and sandwiches include a side.\\n\\nSo, it wasn't all bad. The service was actually pretty good. When we arrived for our 8 PM reservation and our table was all set up. They don't take reservations unless you have 8 or more in your party. We had 10. \\n\\nNow, here's one thing I have to give Cypress Street props for. Although it clearly states they don't do separate checks for large parties, our server gladly volunteered to do that without us even having to ask. I don't know about you, but it is a pain in the ass to separate out what your share is from a large check, especially after you've been drinking all night.

The new formula seems to have added a milky component, which amps up the richness, but cuts in on the pork flavor and makes the broth (for me at least) too creamy. Don't get me wrong, it was edible, and I still enjoyed it to a degree, but I really really prefer the old broth to this new one. \\n\\nThe egg: The egg was one fo the best parts of my meal here before.

This place is located in the same \\"mall\\" as Wendy's and it's right beside Domino's Pizza. They didn't have a take-out menu and so I can only remember the names as was told to me by the cashier/waitress. We ordered the chicken platter, 14 pieces, 7 dry and 7 wet, for approximately $15. She said that if we order by phone to just refer to them as \\"normal chicken' or \\"marinated chicken.\\" We felt that the dry pieces tasted better than the wet ones, very juicy (made to order), kind of like Church's chicken but a slightly differently flavour. The marinated chicken was like sweet and sour except it was also spicy. In addition to that we also got the chicken/cheese/rice cake dish, and it tasted like Joon's tabletop cooking from Toronto Korean Town. The picture provided by the blog and their menu looked really appetizing with the cheese stringy and stuff, but we did take-out and the cheese has already melted in the food so we didn't see much cheese. All in all it was a good dish though so I'd recommend it. One thing to note is, they don't do soup take-outs.

Recomendado!!!"},{"name":"Franklin Barbecue","address":"900 E 11th St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"Oh where to begin with Franklin's BBQ, one of the most famous bbq places in all of America! We got there at 8:40 on a cold rainy Sunday morning and was told to expect our food around 2 pm. For what it's worth they ended up being pretty accurate with the timing. They take your order to anticipate how long the wait will be and when they will sell out. Then they give a last woman/man standing paper to the last person in line guaranteed to get some bbq. Everyone else standing after that person can still wait but they may not end up getting anything. We luckily ended up right before the last man standing! If you're the first few people who line up, there are free folding chairs for you to borrow. However, if you were like us and got there a bit later, then you need to come prepared with your own. Once your line reaches the area where you are under a roof and by the edge of the building it is another 2.5 hour wait from there so make sure to bring a book or some cards to keep you occupied! Also bring some beer/drinks to sip on while you wait. They have bathrooms inside that you can use anytime so feel free to drink away! The good news is, around hour 4 or so of waiting, they brought out some chopped beef sandwiches for us to eat while we wait in line. Granted it was only a small cut of a sandwich, it did help with the growling stomachs. By the time it was our turn to order, we were lucky to find out that they still had everything on the menu left! Usually the ribs are the first to go, but we were able to get a pound of ribs, a pound of brisket, a quarter pound of turkey, a quarter pound of pulled pork and one sausage link. They were all so delicious! The turkey wasn't dry, the pulled pork had great flavor and the brisket and ribs were seasoned and cooked perfectly! All in all, was it worth the six hour wait? If it was your first time going, then I'd say you definitely have to try it out at least once! However, it can be noted that the seasoned vets will usually come in later around 11 am or noon and just line up behind the last man standing. Most of the people who are behind them will leave and so you end up just taking a risk on whether or not they'll run out of bbq for a few hours wait. On this day, they ended up serving maybe 20 or so more people after the last man standing and so it paid off for the people who stayed or came late as they still ended up getting bbq for probably 1/3 of the wait time!"},{"name":"Petra Cuisine","address":"520 SW 4th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"First time customers, and will definitely be returning!

Lastnight's stop was Apres Diem pre and post movie watching of the \\"The Blind Side\\".  Which is a superb movie by the way.  Another feel good movie done in the same vein as \\"Remember The Titans\\".  Seriously, it's that good.\\n\\nI digress.\\n\\nSo I decided to walk into Apres Diem for a quick drink and some apps before the movie.  Did I say \\"The Blind Side\\" is really good?  \\n\\nOk...  First and foremost, the best possible description I can give the place is \\"Cozy\\".  This is in the bar area mind you.  However, I was instantly comfortable as soon as I sat down.  I knew I had somewhat of a time crunch, but I could already tell I didn't want to leave so quickly.\\n\\nThe next thing I noticed was artwork....  For sell!!  I love restaurants like this (Wisteria being another) that have solid artwork for viewing and sell.  I did write down one name because I think I want to buy a piece already.\\n\\nOn to the food and drink.  The beer selection is meh....  I am usually a wino when entering a place like this, but being pressed for time, wine was out of the question.  I like to enjoy and experience wine.  Even cheap wine so a hard stop to go see that movie...  You know...  The one that I said was really good, doesn't allow for that.  I do like their wine list though.  A solid assortment of cheap wines that are still pretty good.\\n\\nTo food...  I ordered two apps.  I ordered the Lobster Bruscetta style app and the Goat Cheese balls.  Love the Lobster plate, but the Goat Cheese Balls were meh.  Screw Ecco for having the best Goat Cheese Balls in Atlanta.  It ruins any other restaurant comparing.  They weren't bad, just slightly above average. \\n\\nI also love a place with solid people watching and Apres Diem delivers.  It is another place that allows for an eccletic set of clientele.  This part was more pronounced post movie when I actually had time to truly pay attention to my surroundings.\\n\\nThere was preppy new-age Midtownite.  There was post, Seattle grunge.  There was Southern Belle, complete with Louis Vuitton purse, fangs, and sunglasses on her head that would cover her entire face.  Oh yeah...  Affliction T-shirt guy was there as well.  There needs to be an intervention on Affliction wearing t-shirt goons.  Seriously.  \\n\\nMy favorite were the two \\"Suicide Girls\\" at the bar swilling vodka shots and Peronis.  Yes, I do love tatted girls that are hot.  I think it is getting back at my mom for being so uptight about keeping up with the joneses.  I was mesmerized.\\n\\nSo I stayed there until 1am.  Yes.  I didn't get kicked out until then because at that point there were still too many people in the bar area relaxing.  \\n\\nThe reason for 3 stars isn't a bad one.  3 stars is truly a solid place in my opinion.  I need more data to take it a 4 star place and I want to try more from the menu.  Just thought it was a cozy little spot, with solid artwork, and solid people watching.  Means I will definitely be back."},{"name":"Moon Indian Cuisine","address":"2144 Johnson Ferry Rd","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"I ordered Chicken Biriyani and Chicken 65.

We were so excited to try Stubb's.  The location was in an old historic building and we are big fans of the BBQ sauce that we pick up at Publix in Florida.  First let me say this, location is beautiful.  Staff and waiter were unfriendly, very slow, and not helpful at all.  We should have got the queue to leave when we saw the table across from us leave and say they were going to go eat somewhere else because what they ordered was so bad.  My wife and I ordered an appetizer of potato skins.  They tasted like the frozen ones you can buy in a store that are warmed up in the microwave.  My wife and I both took a bite of one and didn't eat anymore.  We went ahead and ordered the Stubb's Major which is a 3 meat combo with 2 sides.  We ordered the brisket, chicken, and pulled pork.  For the sides we ordered fried okra, fries, and mac n cheese.  I've never tasted smoked meat so dry.  The chicken, brisket, and pulled pork were TERRIBLE!!!!!!!!!!!!!  The fried okra was over cooked, fries were soggy, and the Mac n cheese out of a box tasted better then what they served here.

The baked beans on the other hand, not so much.\\n\\nI'm can't give it a full five stars, though. The place was packed and we saw maybe two open tables.

YES PLEASE. This is why my husband and I chose Lonesome Dove for my Mother's Day celebration, and then again for our whopper of a \\"4th Wedding Anniversary + Closing on Our First House\\" celebration. No better place!!\\n\\nThe decor and ambience are fantastic and so unique. The service is exceptional: both times we have gone, we were sorely tempted to return just to hang out with our servers. Especially because they gave us the best possible recommendations on cocktails and eats, so we know sitting at a table with them and shooting the breeze would be fun AND delicious. They are incredibly knowledgeable, swift, personable, attentive, witty, and fun. This is the kind of place where your server will lean casually against the table as though they have all the time in the world, and answer all your questions in great, patient detail, explaining the unique menu, helping you make decisions, and telling you their personal recommendations. \\n\\nNow for the food: WOWZA. You don't see menus like this...anywhere! The wild game is of phenomenal quality, but what makes this place special is the creativity. Not just a slider, but an ELK slider with a slab of velvety fois gras and a bit of blueberry jam. Not just a hushpuppy, but a LOBSTER hush puppy with wonderful, smoky sauce. Not just ribs, but wild boar ribs with some kind of fantastic, sticky-sweet-and-savory BBQ sauce. Not just nachos, but ANTELOPE nachos. Not just sausage, but rabbit and rattlesnake sausage. All of it spectacular. And the fun thing about their appetizers is that they serve them in a unique way: you can pick as many as you want of each, and they will bring them all out on a single platter for sharing purposes. No need to commit to just one--you can LITERALLY have them all!\\n\\nWe're now had almost everything on the menu, thanks to our tendency to invite others with the sole purpose (OK, maybe not SOLE, but MAJOR) of sharing their plates. My major recommendations are:\\n\\n1.) Appetizers: elk sliders; wild boar ribs; rattlesnake and rabbit sausage\\n2.) Main courses: roast garlic-stuffed beef tenderloin (you THINK you've had steak before, and then you have THIS); elk loin (elk is now officially my favorite meat--and the hen-of-the-woods mushrooms it's served with are mind-blowing); bison ribeye (yeah, it's expensive..and worth every penny!) \\n3.) Dessert: Ancho Chili chocolate cake. This is the cake that won Tim Love (the chef) Iron Chef. 'Nuf said.

Plenty of street parking exists in the neighborhood.\\n\\nII. FOOD & DRINK: Like any breakfast establishment, they offer plenty of both savory and sweet options. I've both when I've visited each time:\\n\\n*Mexican Eggs Benedict ($11): The yolk (from their perfectly poached eggs), applewood bacon, green chile hollandaise (#life), and masa cake combine, for a fantastic bite. I like their take more than a traditional eggs Benedict, honestly. Their genius masa cake also has a soft, flavor-absorbant texture. \\n\\n*Blue Corn Hotcakes ($8): Three large hotcakes arrive topped with passion fruit butter and piloncillo syrup. Honestly, although good, I wouldn't recommend them. But hey, if you like hotcakes, then go ahead!\\n\\n**Mayan Mocha ($5): Consists of a double shot of espresso, milk, chocolate, and chile de arbol. The drink's chocolate proportion works, and the kick of chile would wake anyone up. Me likes. \\n\\nIII. SERVICE: Although nice, I do think they could benefit by having a host work the door. During both visits, I've walked in and had to look around, for someone to seat us. (I usually have to go up to the bar.) Not sure if they suffer from an understaffing issue, but it definitely is inefficient when it comes to processing patrons and deterrent from wanting to visit often. \\n\\nIV. AMBIANCE & DECOR: They have one of the most beautifully decorated restaurants in Atlanta, honestly. If I kicked it in some Mexican garden elaborate, I would imagine it looking like this. They also have a store connected to the restaurant, and it sells everything from gorgeous knick-nacks to home art.\\n\\nThe tables accommodate mainly groups up to four. \\n\\nV. PRICES: Maybe a dollar or two high, but nothing offensive. \\n\\nVI. OVERALL: Adios Cafe wouldn't serve as my first choice, for breakfast if I lived Downtown.

In every case, the food was good or ok, but just not memorable.

At about the 5th hour, I'll admit that I briefly began to wonder if this would all be worth it. However, I can assure you that feeling was fleeting and I can say with 100% certainty, it is very much worth it.\\n\\nFranklin BBQ has made the art of line waiting itself part of the experience. BYOB or they will be sure to offer it to you themselves. Need water, just ask. Need caffeine, you can find a cute coffee shop right in their parking lot. The staff adopt the role of motivational coaches to those that show any sign of lost hope. \\n\\nAll signs of discouragement or doubt dissolved like fat rendering from their brisket once we approached the cutting board. From first customer to last, they greet you with the same high level of southern hospitality and provide you with their undivided attention as you rattle off the order you've been rehearsing and altering since you arrived. For that brief moment, you are their only customer of the day, and it is AWESOME.\\n\\nBrisket was insane. Lean or Moist, there is no wrong decision. The sugar cookie is evident in the bark as you can almost chew it like a sticky candy. The texture was perfection and the flavor was undeniably the best I've EVER had.\\n\\nPork ribs, I'm pretty sure you don't even need teeth to consume as the meat seems to melt right off the bone.\\n\\nSausage, amazing flavor and a prefect snap from the casing.\\n\\nTurkey, I have no idea how they can smoke Turkey and maintain that level of juiciness. \\n\\nFortunate and grateful that beef ribs were on special and available. Mortal words cannot describe how good Franklin beef ribs are so I won't even try. Please just trust me.\\n\\nTo top it off, Aaron Franklin was in the dining room when we made it through the door. He had no hesitation to offer a handshake, a quick convo and sign my book. As a huge fan, I can tell you that BBQ dreams do come true. An incredible pit-master and  incredible person to match.\\n\\nIn BBQ, all good things require time and patience. If you stay the course and see it through to the end, the result will not disappoint. Franklin BBQ is the manifestation of this BBQ fact.\\n\\nQuick tips: Bring your own chairs. They have a limited supply there, but it is first come first serve. \\n\\nArrived at 7:15 am on a Saturday and there were already about 40-50 waiting in front of us. I hear Sunday or Weekday lines are a bit shorter. \\n\\nFranklin staff will help you through the rest."},{"name":"John Barleycorns","address":"14610 SW Sequoia Pkwy","city":"Tigard","stars":"3.5","text":"Wonderful building and vibe but typical lousy Mcmenamins food.

Husband had the brisket and chicken, with the stew and baked beans. He loved the beans, but was not too sure about the stew. It was his first time having it though, so he might try it again. \\n\\nNeedless to say, we had a big box of left overs to take home.

The experience was for the most part underwhelming, with the most horrific part being the meal. \\nIt was a Monday night, and dining by myself, I opted for the bar. Service got off to a clunky start, but the bartenders taking care of me inevitably got over their initial frat house banter amongst themselves long enough to take my order. \\nI ordered a combination of a dozen oysters, which were fresh and delicious. The bartender, though, had a hard time telling me which oysters were which due to an issue with there being too many variant menus listing oysters that may or may not have been available. After conferring with the kitchen the confusion was left unresolved. \\nTo be honest, the names didn't matter too much; they were delicious none the less. But, and this seems to be the crux of my complaint, I found it perplexing that gestures were made to resolve the confusion, and yet nothing came of them. They were kind enough, though, to offer me some extra oysters, which I declined so as to save room for the much touted sockeye salmon. \\nThe oyster plates were cleared, and I waited five minutes or so. I decided to step outside for a second, a quick puff and a phone call. I was out for about five minutes. When I sat back down I waited another five minutes, and finally the bartenders said the salmon would be out shortly.\\nFinally the salmon arrived...it was a disappointment from the start. As I grabbed the plate to reposition it, I realized the plate was extremely hot, a sure sign for anyone that's ever worked in the business that the plate had been sitting under the heat-lamps for a long time. I went to remove the parsley and it was wilted and crisp on the edges, a sure sign that it and the plate, and in all likelihood the food itself, had been sitting under the heat-lamps for too long as well. My theory, and fears, were confirmed as I forked up a piece of salmon: bone-dry, over-cooked, with an overly-crisped bottom from being cooked too long on one side, or held at temperature too long, whether under heat-lamps or in the oven. \\nNow, I know that I went outside for a few minutes, but there are ways to hold food without scorching it, OR they could have simply told me my food was coming shortly and I would have waited. Yet, the fact that the food didn't come out after the oysters means it wasn't \\"fired\\" properly; that it didn't come out for over 5 minutes after I'd come back from outside means that either it wasn't finished cooking, or that no one had effectively communicated to the kitchen that I was ready for the food. Either way, that I paid $35 for a piece of salmon that was as tasty and enjoyable as the cedar plank it was cooked on, THAT is the miserable failure. When you're going to pay a certain amount for food, you should expect some proficiency, from the kitchen, from the service, etc. That was surely lacking. In the end, I paid $75 for tasty oysters, a good beer, waggish service, and a salmon jerky.

It's a great place to bring a bunch of friends over given the open and sociable environment.\\n\\nBe prepared for a really heavy meal here! I ordered the pulled pork, which I got with sides of macaroni and cheese and a hefty ordering of tater tots.

The sides are good, I enjoy the mac and cheese here. You can't really mess up tater tots! To go back to the protein review, I think this place could use a little more on the consistency side.

The line for the place was long, as would  be expected.  But it wasn't moving.  Eventually a worker walked down the long line, explaining that the prime rib they had gotten was undercooked, and that they didn't do the cooking.  They apologized and said they were getting things in order.\\n\\nApparently the way they got around the rawness of the prime rib was to cut it up raw, and then boil it in au jus.  It was exceedingly tough and chewy.  The guy slicing it seems to have never cut beef before.  Here's a hint: if it is the size and shape of an ice cube, you're not doing it correctly.  If it's just a solid piece of fat, don't put it between two slices of bun.  \\n\\nI couldn't bite through the meat on any bite, so I always ended up dragging out more meat than I'd anticipated.  If you love to chew your food 40 or 50 times, you're going to love this sandwich.  It's au jus flavored shoe leather.  If you eat one of these every day, within a short period you'll have a jawline like Dolph Lundgren in the mid 80's.\\n\\nTo get around a complete lack of flavor in the uncooked beef, the buns are drenched in au jus, because hey, who doesn't like eating a salty wet sponge?\\n\\nThe sandwich comes with Lays Kettle Cooked chips.  Anything from the Frito Lay corporation is some serious high cuisine.  Thanks for putting in the effort, Kevin.  Why not some fresh cut french fries?  Or some fresh made onion rings?  Or at least something better than what I'd get at Blimpies?\\n\\nDo yourself a favor: get a hotdog.  It'll be every bit as bad as this sandwich, but it'll save you 10 bucks, 30 minutes standing in line, and the feeling that you've been robbed of $15.  I think even Guy Fieri would be embarrassed to attach his name to this money-grab of a restaurant."},{"name":"Masa","address":"439 Tremont St","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"Masa may flip a few of your pre-concieved notions on their heads. First of all, the handmade nickel bar and warm backlight illuminates one of the best Tequila lists in New England. If you don't like tequila, chances are you were doing shots of Patron or Jose Cuervo until you got sick. \\n\\nTequila: Like any thing in life, new things are best experienced with someone who is passionate and knowledgeable about the subject. Greg, the head bartender, travels to Jalisco, Mexico to the agave fields and distilleries and returns to the tundra to pass on his knowledge to us. All drinks are made with fresh ingredients, prepared daily: no sour mix, no canned heartburn in a bottle. Try the \\"Apple-Cinnamon Margarita\\", or the house special \\"Masarita\\". When it isn't too loud and crowded in there, ask Greg and he'll teach you the intricacies of tequila as if it were a fine wine. \\n\\nTapas: I have been to Spain a handful of times, and my mother lived in Madrid for a while. You must realize that the tapas at Masa aren't trying to emulate the tapas in Espa√±a. They are, however, fun, tasty little bites that you don't find in every tapas bar. Enjoy them for what they are. They are cheap, tasty, and largely original. \\n\\nDinner: Some reviewers dislike the Mexican food here. Well, it's not Mexican food. Nor is it Spanish. It's Southwest-fusion, so in reality, it's only about 1/3 Mexican and the rest is 2/3 artistic flair. I enjoy getting a few starters and splitting them with a friend. Try the Spicy Ahi Tuna Cabo Rolls, which are part sushi and part southwestern, the calamari, which  proves that you don't have to fry it to enjoy it, and the Scallops and Duck are tasty, and Lobster Tamale with spicy vanilla butter round out a good meal. With the bread and spread that they give you, that should fill you up. \\n\\nBrunch: Masa has increased its business in a down economy. How? Good food, good drink, low prices, and a neighborhood location on Restaurant Row. The brunch is their most popular offering. You might not have had tequila with breakfast since spring break, but in a Bloody May it's surprisingly tasty. The house BM mix has a bit of bite, just right. The brunch items are good and cheap. As long as you're not trying to drink a bunch of alcohol, you can be well fed and out the door for $15. \\n\\nBudget night out: There are half-off tapas deals right now from 5:00-6:30, and 10:00-midnight. BUT, even when that isn't in effect, you can go in and get 2 glasses of quality house wine, and 10 tapas bites for about $20. \\n\\nPlease bring back the dates wrapped in bacon, that was my favorite!"},{"name":"The Cowfish Sushi Burger Bar","address":"Universal Citywalk - Orlando, 6000 Universal Blvd","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"I loved this place.

I had been there once before last fall, and though I remembered the excruciating wait, I do remember how scrumptious the chicken and waffles were. It was that promise of comforting food that made me want to fight the wait line again. This time however, I left with a less than satisfactory experience. \\n\\nSure, any quality brunch place in Portland, you can expect the obligatory wait for a table. What I did mind was what the experience was after we sat down. I know it was busy in there, but there was no excuse for the fact that the group that had been seated directly before us had finished and left well before we got our food. There was also no excuse for the fact that a bigger party that had sat down about 20 minutes after we did had gotten their food before us. When asked about our food, our waiter simply stated that our orders got \\"lost in the shuffle.\\" Thanks, sir, for being attentive and for fighting to get our dishes out, because...wait, you didn't. Incredibly infuriating.\\n\\nRegarding the food, yeah, it was tasty enough. I had the Oyster Benedict, which was good, but not grand enough to warrant 5-stars. Maybe I just was so starving from seeing everyone around chowing down that I basically inhaled it instead of savored it. I also had a bite for my buddy's chicken and waffles, which was good, but not nearly as awesome as I remembered it. \\n\\nOverall, I was pretty frustrated by my experience. The food was fine, good enough to justify giving it at least 4-stars on that merit alone. But as my buddy put it, the time we had to wait and the weak service did not justify the quality of the food. So much of eating brunch here in Portland is all about the greater experience, and this was just so exasperating for me and my friends that I will probably not voluntarily choose to go back again."},{"name":"Franklin Barbecue","address":"900 E 11th St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"Thursday, 7/19/18. What can one say about this iconic destination that has not already been said? You really should not think about a trip to Franklin barbecue as a meal, but an experience.  Particularly if you \\"smoke your own\\" like I do. It you. If you are a \\"low and slow\\" BBQ maker or lover, this is truly a pilgrimage to BBQ Mecca. I will get this out of the way early: Yes it is worth the wait.  That being said, there are things to know to prepare for the most pleasant experience possible.\\n\\n(TIP)Arrive early. They serve until they run out of food.  If you do not arrive before 9 a.m. you may not get all of the items you want (particularly the brisket). Depending on the day of the week, arriving after 10 a.m., you may get nothing. We went on a Thursday.\\n\\n(TIP):Tuesday-Thursday generally have shorter lines). We arrived 6:45 a.m. to greet 11 people already in line.\\n\\n(TIP) Won't wait? Pre-order online 6 wks in advance. They limit the number of orders and quantities. Pick-up counter in the back lot, must leave premises to eat. There is a park nearby to consume your kill. As a person who cooks a lot of Q it will still be good, but nothing compares to the hot, moist meat eaten within the first few minutes it is sliced. (TIP) Arriving early assures amazing lunch and ~the 1st 30 people in line will be waiting under the roof, out of the sun, by fans,in a chair. There is a stack of about 30 folding picnic chairs stacked under the staircase for your use. Depending on the month, you may want to bring a hat, umbrella, or cooler. There was a coffee truck in the lot but they do not come any more. Aaron is launching a food truck in the lot which will serve coffee and breakfast brisket tacos. The staff comes around with a basin of soft drinks, beer and hard cider for purchase on the line. (TIP) I recommend that you bring a back-up battery for your phone to keep your self entertained and powered-up for the dozens of selfies and \\"food porn\\" pics you will take. Don't just bury your face in your iPhone! Part of the experience is chatting with the folks around you on line. This is like a community. Everybody is extremely friendly and excited. At about 9 a.m. the staff arrive. Once they set up, they open the doors.\\n\\n (TIP) You will have access to their clean bathrooms. This is a great time to go in and buy some swag. They have a nice assortment of Franklin-branded T-shirts, hats, coffee mugs, sauces, etc... They also have ice water available. Somebody will come out walk the line getting an estimate of orders and giving advice on placing your order.  At some point they will give sign to the person in line most likely to get lunch. (TIP) Look at the online menu ahead of time so you do not panic and choke placing your order like Ralphie did with with Santa in \\"A Christmas Story\\". The doors opened at 11 o'clock a.m. Given that everything is sliced while you watch, it took us 30 minutes to get from the door to the order counter. Lots of seating available. The main room is air conditioned and there are porch picnic tables.\\n\\nFinally, the food!  Most people wish they had ordered more. (TIP) Leftovers are much better than regrets.  I had ordered  an amount that was absolutely ridiculous for me and my wife. It was quite easy to find takers among our friends back at our hotel. Included is plenty of white bread, pickles and onions. Our order:\\n-2 lb brisket moist, 1/2 pound of lean. (the fatty part of the brisket (the point) it called moist here and the (brisket flat) is called lean. You really want all or at least some moist. The brisket is Aaron's signature item and is the one YOU CANNOT MISS. It is truly the best you will ever eat. Moist, melty, smoky, beefy goodness. (Oy vey is it good)\\n-7 ribs (about 4 to a pound) These were St. Louis cut spare ribs. Also truly excellent and a must have. Despite people wanting \\"fall off the bone\\" ribs, that is considered by mavens to be overdone. You want a bit of chew. If you take a bite, you should not have to tug and you should leave a half moon hole with the rest of the meat intact.\\n-2 links. These were excellent. I didn't think we could eat more.\\n-1/2 lb pulled pork. 1/4 pound turkey. No offense, nothing personal, good but not memorable. Try if you like, but these will not rock your world. In truth, I have never been blown away by pulled pork or turkey from my smoker or at any Q location.\\n-Small Slaw. Nice, but again, not remarkable. You do need something to cut the fat and give you relief from the heaviness of most everything else. (Don't forget to periodically cleanse your palate with those pickles and the white bread.)\\n-Banana bourbon and Pecan pies. Mini personal pies were tasty and are really a good final chapter to the meal.\\n\\n(TIP)When you are done, ask for 5 minute tour of the attached smokehouse. They have 5, 1000 ga. converted propane tanks cranking it out 24/7. Post oak smells like victory.\\n\\nTo me, a very memorable morning and a top 5 meal of any cuisine.

This is not haute cuisine, this is not a place with a patio, this is a place where kids can get their kid on and parents can hang in there with them or hang at the table knowing they are in a safe environment.  So move on hipsters, let the parental Big Dogs through.\\n\\nIt was the Tax Deduction's sixth birthday and we asked him where he wanted his kids party.  There was no hesitation, there was no thoughtful look, there was no indecision he wanted to party with a rodent.  The Wife looked at me, smiled, and in her best Jean-Luc Picard told me to, \\"Make it so.\\"  To the internet!\\n\\nTo my surprise you can plan out the whole ugly ordeal on-line!  Everything from food for kids and adults to cakes and ice cream to parting gift bags for his friends.  Click, click, click and before I knew it I was out $158.  Upside was no kids running through the house, no clean up, no cooking and built in entertainment.  For parents this is huge.  Even more huge if you have antiques and collectible breakables in your home.\\n\\nOnly downside really was a week before the party some entirely too perky teenager calls you to talk about the plan... you can smell the Clearasil through the phone.  She tries to upsell you on everything while pointing out, not directly, that a good parent supplies these extras.  Then a few days before the party she calls again on the same mission.  The day before the party guess what?  AND THEN, you finally arrive for the party thinking everything is handled and they try to upsell again and then get you to plan the time schedule of the party!

Don't mind if I do. Trying to resist knocking down the doors before they opened, I decided to give Tasty Burger a little time to work out any new restaurant kinks. But I couldn't wait any longer, Saturday was National Cheeseburger Day and there was no way I wasn't going somewhere. Right behind Fenway Park, and steps away from one of my least favorite burgers in the city, (Remy's) Tasty Burger stands out as a former gas station turned restaurant, it looks vintage, even right down to the take-out window open until 2 am. But it's sort of an identity crisis right from the start. I'm expecting fast-food, classic 50s style burgers, but someone is there to greet us and open the door as we walk in. No complaint there, but the dim lighting and a full bar confuses me when they're clearly going for that old school West-Coast burger chain inspiration. The best of both worlds? Not for me, I'd rather one or the other, but that's me. The service is quick and borderline too aggressive, as we're asked how everything is literally six times before I've even had a bite of food. Early restaurant jitters aside, this was a bit on the annoying end of customer service. But still, I'll take the frequent check-ins over an impossible to find server any day.There are a few burgers to choose from, all very reasonably priced starting at just $4, but just one cheese option in Colby-Jack, strange I think for a burger joint to only offer one type of cheese, unless I'm missing something. I've been completely skeptical of the burgers because they're cut from the tenderloin, which as we all know is way too lean to work for a burger. But the burgers are seasoned nicely, coming out as a pretty good medium-rare, despite never asking how I wanted it cooked. Seasoned well, yes, but flavorful not so much. Again, just too lean of a cut, and you can tell, it's a nice pink-ish hue inside, but very little moisture to speak of. Lettuce, tomato and odd tasting chewy bacon round out my burger on a nondescript sesame seed bun. Something is just missing, it's not offensive, it's not even bad, it just doesn't wow me. Same with the fries and onion strings, which come together on a 50-50 mix, the fries are seasoned well, but a little on the blonde spectrum in terms of color, and the onions are all batter and very little onion flavor. The shakes are also a let-down, as both the black and white and strawberry shakes sampled taste off, like there's something besides milk and ice cream in there, most definitely a flavored syrup which doesn't belong and makes it rather unpleasant. I also think a $30 bill for two people is way too high when my burger cost all of $5.50, even with two shakes. Tasty Burger is the new kid on the street, but if they want to survive a very competitive burger market, they need to up the anti a little bit, tenderloin and over-the-top service wont get you there alone, but at least it's better than Remy's."},{"name":"Don Pablo's","address":"100 Towne Ctr Blvd","city":"Sanford","stars":"3","text":"Went here for lunch recently and got the chicken quesadilla.

I'm pleased with the prompt, attentive service.  If you enjoy McMenamin's signature beers (Hammerhead, Nitro, etc.), this is a fine atmosphere for groups to gather at Happy Hour. The food I've eaten was edible but admittedly unimpressive. As others have mentioned, if you order the fries and you can expect a generous serving in a basket, but I suspect they're fried in 10W-30 or DELO-30; they will spike your \\"bad\\" cholesterol levels! Order them anyway; they taste better with the burgers & beer. \\nIn summary, it's a great place to relax with friends and debrief after work. You can quaff a brew or two, nibble a few appetizers, and enjoy good company and conversation in an atmosphere that encourages celebration.

I grade my ramen on a variety of different scales: Broth, Protein, toppings/ajitama/noodles\\n\\n1. Broth (4) - Solid Tonkotsu the color was a nice creamy white with a flavor that was actually lighter than you would expect but certainly not watery. \\n\\n2. Protein (4.5) - My dish came with the Chashu (pork belly). The texture was not as tend as some of the other places I have been to. It was difficult to break apart with just chop sticks, but the flavor was out of this word. It had hints of smoke and sweet that were to die for, perhaps the best flavor of Chashu that I have tasted until now. \\n\\n3. Toppings & extras (4) - Personally I'm not the biggest fan of the thin noodles Tatsu-ya used for their ramen, but since they were cooked perfectly, just a tad aldente, I cannot hold that against them. On the other hand what I can hold against them was the Ajitama that was clearly too sweet (perhaps too much mirin..) on the same level as corn. Some people may like this, but I found it to be off putting. The rest of the toppings were standard nothing bad or good to say about them.\\n\\nOverall rating is about a 4 and if the actually place was a bit nicer, I would have bumped it up to 5 stars (the location on Lamar would receive a 5er from me). Personally I think I would give the nod to Michi for best ramen in Austin, but it's certainly close."},{"name":"Hana Japanese Bistro","address":"1148 W Dillon Rd, Unit 6","city":"Louisville","stars":"4.5","text":"This place is great!

We both got the risotto with scallops, and fried oysters (which were totally succulent).  The scallops were probably a bit on the overcooked side... A consequence of making hundreds of them in the same night, but the rest of the items, and the entire dish was pretty sensational.  As for dessert ... mine was kind of a bomb.  The strawberry cheesecake at dessert was good, classic eating, but nothing over the top --- more  like the sort of thing you have a craving for at midnight that you got from the Whole Foods earlier in the day.  The banana flautas though (is that even the word?) was crazy.

Cannot say I particularly felt valued or welcomed as a customer.   When walked in, person behind counter simply asked \\"Carry out?\\"  I replied we were looking to dine-in.   Nobody was at the host station, but two waiters did come up to the stand.   The first asked \\"two?\\" and I replied \\"No, there is three of us\\" as there were three of us standing at the station.  The first waiter started counting out silverware and menus when the second waiter arrived.   Seemed to be some sort of dispute like who's turn it was.   The first waiter put back the silverware & menus to allow the second waiter to seat us.   He simply said \\"follow me\\" and took off.   At the table, he tossed the menus and silverware in a grouping on the table and then left.  The rest of the evening was like that.  Cold.  Impersonal.  Routine.  \\n\\nI ordered their pot roast for dinner.   As I was rather hungry, I also ordered a small cranberry pecan chicken salad.   For the dinner roll that comes with the dinner, I asked for biscuit.   The pot roast was underwhelming.   When I think of a pot roast, I think of the ingredients slow cooked together over time.  The beef was slow cooked and tender.   The carrots were some side dish that had been added to the plate.  The carrots also had some sort of sweet glaze on them.   The mashed potatoes were instant potatos out of a box.   The meal was topped off with a beef gravy which didn't mix well with the sweet glaze from the carrots followed by some cooked onions.   I would typically think of a pot roast being a hearty meal, but was not satisfying.    The biscuits that came with the meal were hard and crumbled in my hand.   Crumbs all over the table.   The biscuits were at least day old and definitely not fresh.  \\n\\nThe salad was the last thing to come out of the kitchen.  It did not come before or with my meal.   I was about ready to ask the waiter about it thinking that they had actually forgotten it, but he came to tell me they were still working on the grilled chicken portion of the salad.   The \\"greens\\" in the salad were simply chopped up head lettuce, the kind you get from a bag.   It was topped off with some mixture of pecans and bacon.   I think I actually found two cranberries.  Salad ingredients had not been mixed together at all.   The grilled chicken was warm and topped off the salad.   \\n\\nI kept asking the two other guests how they liked their meals.   One ordered the country fried steak and the other ordered the grilled chicken and mashed potato's from the 55+ menu.  They said their meals were fine.  So, the reason for two stars is because I am giving the restaurant the benefit of the doubt.  \\n\\nWe told the waiter we would like to order desert.   He then went away and helped other patrons.   Did not come back to our table for more than 10 minutes.   He asked again if there was anything else we wanted.

Table of four took 45 minutes to be sat, but it would have been much less had we accepted seats at the bar. Beef cheek tacos and two types of pork tacos were just as good (very, very good) as the Cambie La Taqueria (their sister restaurant). The mashed potato Flautas were a little meh, but likely just not to our taste. We should have opted for the chicken ones. The guacamole did everything I hoped it would, fresh (made to order) and unctous. \\n\\nMy tequila ceasar was a bit thin, but tasted ok. The man's Hemingway in Mexico cocktail was fantastic, though he found it a bit heavy and in need of a splash of soda. The sip I had seemed perfect and made me envious as I drank my thin ceasar.\\n\\nOverall, everything was good. The mezcal selection looked fantastic.The only real critique... we found it super awkward carrying our plates past the people waiting to be sat to get to the salsa station. That is ok for a counter service restaurant, but for a sit down table service joint there really should be condiments brought to the table. \\n\\nOtherwise, service was fantastic and I am looking forward to going back and trying more.

Frankly, I'm not really a waffle person so I probably can't tell difference between this and Denny's, but the chicken truly is impeccable. The cajun scramble was also delicious in its own right, particularly the sweet potatoes. \\n\\nAs crowded as it was, my only wish was that the food came out just a little quicker.

It was my first time there so I didn't really expect much. Though the waitresses were kind and all there seems to be a lot of trouble with timing and getting food on time. I came here to eat food not to spend 2 hours of my precious time to wait for it. It took me around 30 minutes to get a waiter because once my aqquantaince and I came in, the staff forgot about us. It didn't take us long to order but the food took a tremendous long time. They gave us the wrong appetizer and made us wait over an hour because they left one of my lunches out. It was getting pretty late so we decided to take make it a take out since we spent an hour waiting for nothing. But then again it took much longer than I thought it would. We talked to one of the waiters about this issue of timing but only to find out that it is the manager's fault because he was making them hop from table to table, causing them to tend to forget about their customers. Now this may be a huge problem for the service because if you keep customers waiting like this, it's going to cause a huge ruckus. \\n\\nBut now let's focus on the food of course. The food here is pretty decent except that when I took out my order I only found it to be a bit raw and not edible. I find that Olive Garden doesn't really focus on making their meals as appetizing as it look but rather rushes, and I guess microwaves it. This is probably one of the worst restaurants I've ever went in my life, aside from the nice staffing. But I suggest that the restaurant would need help on timing and being aware that their customers are actually there to eat not wait. Overall I was very disappointed at most.

I was really happy with everything I ordered.

So we checked it out this morning, hoping that it would live up to its hype. \\n\\nIt did. \\n\\nIt was a typically overcast November morning in Portland, and the place was packed, as expected. We helped ourselves to hot cups of coffee and waited outside, amongst the hipsters and dog walkers, enjoying the scene and the hot coffee. After about thirty minutes we were ushered inside, and kicked things off with a couple of Bloody Marys. They were good - a little on the spicy side, which is exactly how I like them - and contained pickled okra in addition to the standard olive spear. That's how you know you're in a Southern-inspired kitchen, boys and girls. The chicken and waffles were every bit as good as advertised: the chicken was served piled atop the deep, fluffy sweet potato waffle, three very generous portions of white meat whose buttermilk batter was crispy, crunchy, and packed full of flavor (and a little heat, courtesy of black pepper and a bit of cayenne). Moist and flavorful, the fried chicken was probably the best in town (sorry, Pine State). And the waffle was amazing - airy, a little chewy, and a little sweet, the perfect accompaniment to the chicken. Be prepared to share, or bring home leftovers - the portion is huge. My girlfriend ordered eggs benedict and cheddar grits, and both were delicious. The grits were nice and creamy and tasted like mac 'n cheese. This is a good thing! \\n\\nI rarely give 5-star ratings, but Screen Door deserves one. The wait staff were all very friendly and personable, and if you are waiting outside for a table, they will come and find you. They are cheerful and never make it seem like a hassle. But even if they were aloof and ornery, I wouldn't care - the food is that good. \\n\\nThis is the perfect place to bring out of town guests who want to experience a slice of the cool and hip Portland breakfast scene.

Then there's Franklin bbq lol. I love bbq and yes I have been to the top four places in Texas. \\n\\nThis is probably my 3rd time coming to Franklins. This time I pre ordered online about two weeks before my Austin trip. The previous two other times I had waited in a 3-5 hour wait in line. No more :) I decided to buy a prechilled brisket  (5-7lb per the website) as well as a prechilled smoked turkey.  We ordered some freshly cut brisket on the fly and they were very accommodating .  Keep in mind , this pre order is a select time slot and any changes to this order needs to be called ahead of time.  \\n\\nSo the food :) the brisket is by far my #1 place to go too. The beef rib is on another dimension. It is your central Texas bbq style (only salt pepper and smoke) to make the delicious food that they do. I will say if you didn't pre order like that way I did this last time.  The lines are long , you have to go early and you will be standing the entire time .  Unless you get a lawn chair they have outside for folks.  Bbq is not cheap either , however, you do get what you pay for. At ~$26 for a pound of brisket , I'd pay twice that for it!  I'm not lying. If you have not gone please go and see why people are just waiting in a 5 hour line in hopes of getting some famous bbq. Even the mean brisket is rich with flavor and is moist. The \\"moist\\" brisket is just mouth watering goodness that you can cut with a fork. It's rich bark and it's flavor is one of a kind.  \\n\\nIf brisket is not your thing (hope that is not the case) or if you want a healthy alternative consider the smoked Turkey . It is phenomenal as well. If not, consider pulled pork and all the other deliciousness that is Franklins!\\n\\nIndoor seating is scarce normally. You have to wait for people to finish eating or try to eat outside. Keep in mind, usually everyone is in groups and take up most tables. Not impossible , but something to note. All meat is freshly cut in front of you. They do sell bottles of bbq sauce, sides and soft drinks. \\n\\nAlways to try to pay attention for the employees coming out to talk to the crowd! They usually are giving you updates on what meat they have and are running low on! If you get a last man standing paper ! Beware! Dangerous no brisket takes are coming.\\n\\n\\nI know this is a mixed review of my previous times coming here but I feel like you should know as much as possible.

Jake's was never the Crazy Uncle or the Admired Grandparent but it was the Old Reliable Aunt. You got a big meal, never ambitious or novel but generally executed well, at a price that was neither cheap nor expensive. I don't like my own blood but I know it's there. Jake's was that kind of blood. Not the scary kind. Not the kind that is thicker than water or the subject of country songs. Jake's was breathing. Not the yoga kind or the kind dignified with \\"first\\" or \\"last\\". It was a positive that never wants to know that its world is flat.\\n\\nObligatory fresh seafood line: The ocean is a ginormous place full of organisms that taste good. If you set the Earth ablaze through non-nuclear war and set our oceans boiling, you would have a delicious soup on your hands that could feed the hungry to days. Too bad everybody would be dead on the shores. Whatever. The menu at Jake's goes to great pains to showcase its fishiness and the many places these living ingredients come from. Do you like Idaho? That's the only thing about the \\"Trout.\\" It's trout from Idaho. Take that, Dubliners!\\n\\nJake's: It's food. I never found so much there that I thought I could lose it. But I did. And now Jake's must pay. \\n\\nAs I said, I work for a lumberyard embarrassed by chickens. Yesterday, I went to Jake's with a large party of co-workers, some friendly, some not. We were all hungry and ready to rock. There may even have been drinks in mind. Jake's was chosen as a convenient option that no one minded. We were seated at this giant table by the window and got ready to order. We talked about a lot of things. Including me. Our server came by and we got beverages. Including some drinks. And then ... we waited. \\n\\nThe strength of Jake's has always been its reliability. The food will never surprise you, for better or worse. The place isn't exactly comforting, but there's nothing wrong with it. it will neither improve nor decline your day. That's why I was completely stunned when, over an hour after we were seated, our food still hadn't materialized. Maybe it was because the server took forever to take our order. Maybe it was because we had made a joke to him about a personal gaming console and SOME PEOPLE DESPISE THAT WAY OF LIFE. Regardless, a lunch that should've been about the path of zero resistance and raising none of my physiological signals above a steady blip turned into a gigantic pain. A wait that never ended. A truth that didn't know how to prosper. \\n\\nThe whole place had cleared out--we're now pushing 3PM here--and my party was still waiting there like jerks. Finally, someone made that peremptory whistle noise and said \\"Sir?\\" in the context of a story about another restaurant. Basically we had been there so long we had forgotten where we were or why we were there. I guess that takes Jake's back to its most basic form of identity that I was describing but only in the same way that death is the same thing as birth, which it isn't. The waiter couldn't help but perk up, saunter over, and tell us that our food was ready and would be out in a second.\\n\\nSo many questions: Was it us? Had our food really just been ready at the moment we inadvertently flagged him down? What is wrong with some people? Where else could we have gone instead? Is the owner going to leave a bitchy comment on this review? The waiter? Why did he actively avoid us before that crucial moment? Is the X-Box really that polarizing?\\n\\nMost of all, why never even check up on us to say \\"this is taking a while, I'm sorry?\\"\\n\\nI guess that's not the Jake's way. To be seen, heard, or otherwise affect the customer, is not what they do. I have so much to learn about the Northwest. Or maybe my work-friends and I are all just reprehensible, loud, tasteless slobs not worthy of the warm caress of Jake's on a Friday afternoon. \\n\\nOh and my side of pasta was too garlicky. \\n\\nJake's, I'm sorry change is so hard. I'll probably give you another try.

Bland flavors on both pizzas: Hawaiian and Veggie. How can Canadian bacon have no flavor? How can a veggie pizza taste only of a slight hint of garlic? If these popping burning questions keep you awake at night, order a pizza from Rovente and you will have all the answers.\\n\\nDelivery: Prompt and on schedule. The pizza was hot, which is always a plus. The driver was nice, but when I gave him a Twenty for a $14.99 pizza, he asked if I wanted change. No no NO. You do not do that. I'm not going to give anybody a 32% tip, and no one should ever ask if I want change; I'll tell my server if what I give them is all for them.

The line is silly of course and if I were local I doubt I'd eat here much because of it, but for an occasional visit (assuming you have the time) it adds to the experience. Time to catch up and make some new friends, and since they'll serve you beer it's not really much different than hanging in the bar before being seated for a meal. \\n\\nEverything is good, but since we're talking about the major league of BBQ here I'll opine that the brisket is simply as good as it gets, and it's a treat not just to eat but to order and discuss the merits between a few different chunks of lean and fat before selecting what gets sliced. \\n\\nThe turkey is simply incredible also  - the absolute perfect texture, moist, delicious. I'm assuming they brine the turkey first since it tastes so good, and the texture suggests it - but if they do it's not brined to the point where it gets that sort of hammy texture. It's really special.\\n\\nThe ribs are good. I've had better. In fact I've made better. But I don't think anyone would be unhappy with these. I wasn't - they just weren't religious like the turkey and brisket.\\n\\nThe espresso BBQ sauce is sick (in a good way that is).\\n\\nLove the vibe here too - serious about the food, but light hearted about the experience."},{"name":"Kyoto Sushi & Grill","address":"6651 S Semoran Blvd, Ste 106","city":"Orlando","stars":"3.5","text":"Food is alittle bland but the sauces help.

It was so flavorful that no extra sauce was even necessary. \\n\\nThe other daily special taco - Ceviche Yucatan (Lime cured mahi in a colorful assortment of roasted red and poblano peppers, serrano pepper, grilled corn and purple onion) was the perfect refreshing counterpoint to the rich, flavorful Delibelly. \\n\\nAlso had: \\n*The Jess Special Breakfast Taco (Eggs scrambled with our migas mix and topped with Monterrey Jack cheese and fresh sliced avocado): The Deilbelly & Ceviche overshadowed this.

A place that serves over 30 different hot dogs (if you don't like what you see you can create your own), tater tots and alcohol!!!  I've died and gone to Heaven. Well, sorta.  It was a short stay.\\n\\nStreet parking is pretty easy to find and after a short walk you will find the colorful outside of Dirty Frank's right next to 16-Bit Bar. You will also probably find a bunch of people waiting outside because this place is tiny!  We peeked in and it looked like it was going to be awhile so went next door and played some games for a 1/2 hour. It was around 1 on a Saturday so I guess the wait is expected and not a big deal. Especially with 16-Bit right there. \\n\\nWhen we did get in we were sat right in the middle of the place. They have tables crammed everywhere they can and its difficult to move around. Very tight squeeze.  Our waitress was pretty abrupt with us and pushed us to order. It being my first time here I kinda blew her off right back and took my time looking. So much to choose from!  I settled on The Sanoran and West Virginia Slaw Dog with the Deluxe Tater Tot-Chos and a spiked Strawberry Icee (basically a frozen Margarita).  I got both dogs ripped which I believe means they were deep fried. (I'm pretty sure that's what the annoyed waitress said). Wow were these things good!  Loaded to the gills with toppings making a mess all over my plate like a good hot dog should. It was okay because I just ate the droppings with my Tater Tot-chos which were covered in toppings themselves. (Coney sauce, cheese, jalape√±o, onion and tomato) \\n\\nI seriously enjoyed every single bite I had!  At least for the time I was there. Our waitress wasted no time grabbing our plates and giving us the bill basically shooing us out the door.  I get it, you are a small busy place and you need your tables.  But I think a half hour isn't too bad for us to eat and enjoy ourselves a bit. We probably ate and had the bill in under 20 minutes and were gone.  It just felt really rushed and the only thing on our waitresses mind was give them food, get them out.\\n\\nSo yeah, awesome place!  I'd love to go 5 stars here but the service takes it down a bit. I'll be back for sure because there are a lot more dogs to eat. Just might try an off time so I can relax a little more."},{"name":"Sonsie","address":"327 Newbury St","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"LOVED everything! The server was excellent.

The dumplings, more Asian than Southern, were quite good. And so was the andouille gravy that was drizzled over the plate. But I kind of felt like nothing really went together. Plus, the chicken was filled with gristle, cartilage or something, which isn't good for an entree that cost $18.\\n\\nA few other things bugged me, too. One was the super-salty crab cake appetizer.

It's a dumpy old gas station that has been transformed into an adorable diner-like burger joint.  Unfortunately, this place didn't get it right.  There are only two ways to run a burger joint: 1) A very cheap and plain but seriously solid burger like In-N-Out's $2.95 deal or 2) Pricey but delicious gourmet treat like SDLT's $14 burger.  Tasty is neither.  \\n\\nATMOSPHERE - I agree with one of the previous reviewers that organizationally, the place is a little strange.  There's an indoor seating area where you get waiter service but there's also a tiny \\"to go\\" window outside, which is the first thing you visually see when you approach Tasty.  I initially ordered at the \\"to go\\" window thinking that I just took my burger with me to self seat only to find out that's not the way it works.  And you have to pay for parking for the privilege of eating here?\\n\\nSERVICE - We were the only people seated and the wait time to receive our burgers was 15 minutes.  That is awfully slow for what I consider to be fast food.\\n\\nFOOD - \\n\\nHamburger - Judging a good burger means eating it without all the dressings and frills that just disguises the meat flavour so I ordered a plain one for $4. The bun is a regular bun that was flat and soggy, which I don't understand given it should have gone straight from the kitchen to my table.  One major criticism is that it's the saddest patty I've ever had.  According to the menu, it's tenderloin, which is expensive for sure but I'm not sure an appropriate cut since it's so lean.  The patty was so overcooked - super dry, beyond well done, and completely lacking meat flavour.  It was like eating particle board in the shape of a patty.  \\n\\nPile of Onion Strings - The only reason this place didn't get 1* from me is because of these onion strings.  I love onion rings but what it inevitably ends up being is a hollow tube of dough with a thin string of onion inside.  These onions are finely julienned, lightly battered, and then fried.  The problem is that they are so finely cut that they lack substance.  You need a serious handful to get any onion flavour.  Having said that, it was an interesting take on onion rings and I appreciate that.\\n\\nI'm willing to consider my lackluster meal to be new restaurant blues and consider revisiting down the road.  However, if I am to have another burger in the future for $4 to $5.50, I expect it to be slightly better in quality than what I can get across the street at BK.\\n\\nUPDATE:  On a side note, I received a distasteful email from the owner accusing me of attacking his personal livelihood by posting a negative review, that \\"Yelpers view businesses as an object and not a collection of other human beings,\\" that we publish reviews to fulfill a sense of self importance, and that I misrepresented the truth.  After rereading my review, it stands and continues to accurately reflect my experience at Tasty and for $4, there are definitely better choices in town (UBurger and Flat Patties).   If you lose business for serving a mediocre burger, that's on you, not Yelpers."},{"name":"Fox Bros.

First off, this place is the definition of a bbq joint; nothing fancy but has a lot of character. We placed a to go order cause there were more storms rolling in and we had things to do. My mom got a pulled pork sandwich and I got a sliced brisket sandwich; we both had mac-n-cheese as our side item.\\n\\nTo put it simply, this was the best bbq either one of us have ever eaten! The brisket was super tender and flavorful and it didn't even need the sauce that they give you to put on it; but it tastes awesome with the sauce too. My mom loved the pulled pork; it was flavorful and juicy and it didn't need the sauce either. But she liked the sauce on it as well.\\n\\nBut as good as the bbq was (and it was absolutely incredible), the mac-n-cheese is what blew both of us away. It was super creamy, had great cheese flavor, and was seasoned with just the right amount of pepper; it was outstanding. We've had a run of bad luck with trying to find a good bbq joint lately, but that all changed after finding this place.\\n\\nSimply put, this is the best bbq I've ever had the good fortune of eating and one of the best bbq joints I've been in.

My husband bought VIP tickets to a show recently, and we learned the hard way that the tickets were very expensive considering what you actually get, at least in our experience. \\n\\nFirst, the VIP building is at the back of the standing area, which means that if you choose to watch the show from the VIP building, you have to stay all the way in back of the venue. The advantage is that there are some seats, a private bar (alcoholic drinks aren't free), nice bathrooms, and free non-alcoholic beverages here, but of course you're far from the stage. This is also where you get your free food- which was our main disappointment. Seeing as this a famous BBQ restaurant, we were shocked to find out that our free meal consisted of a choice of a sandwich (or tacos)- and that was it. We each ordered a pulled pork sandwich, which was good enough, but it certainly wasn't anything special. It didn't feel at all VIP to not even be offered one traditional side, like potato salad or baked beans. We had expected a buffet- or at least a full meal- not just one lukewarm sandwich.\\n\\nIf you don't want to stay in the back VIP area, you can go up to the balcony VIP area, which is located above the stage to the right. This was pretty cool because you're much closer to the stage and it also has its own bar. However, views are limited, so it really only pays off if you happen to get a good spot. \\n\\nIn the end, we just gave up on VIP and went down to the GA area, since ultimately the show wasn't overly crowded and we had better views from there. We were really disappointed that at 4x the GA price, we didn't end up with much to speak of. Stubb's really has to work on this. If they can't change the location of the VIP areas, simply providing a full meal and one or two free alcoholic drinks would make a big difference- either that, or charge less for VIP tickets. As it is, the only way it makes any sense is if it's going to be an extremely crowded show and/or you need to be able to sit during the show. Otherwise, as it is now, it's a total waste of money."},{"name":"Eden Burger","address":"1437 N High St","city":"Columbus","stars":"4.5","text":"Burger was just fine, about a dozen to choose from.

Definitely one of the better mac n cheeses I've had, and I make it a point to try it wherever I go.  \\n\\nParking isn't usually a problem.  You can typically always find a space out front, however this place does get crowded on weekends.

I topped this off with a margarita and maybe a shot.    We amused ourselves by asking Austin-related questions of the staff at Stubbs who (except for the grim-faced bartender) were really sweet & funny.\\n\\nBy the time Crisse had relinquished her phone number to the drummer we'd moved to seats at the bar.

I often order the fajitas or chicken enchiladas to split with my fiance.  Total price with tip (if we don't get beverages) is $10-12.

It's a small place but you definitely don't get the homey small diner feel one might expect. When I brought my family here for a nice breakfast, my brother's french toast had a piece of wax paper stuck underneath it -- clearly a frozen slab they just heated up and didn't even bother taking off the packaging.

We walked up to the host stand and said we were just here for happy hour and the host was really jumpy and shocked and didn't know what to do. He must've not been the host and was just standing in, but it was a  bad first impression. Before we could even ask to just sit at the bar he rushed off to the back to... Go find someone or ask somebody what to do... He seemed frantic even though there was no one else waiting to be seated and overall things were pretty slow. \\n\\nHe finally came back and we told him we would just sit at the bar. There were a few two tops that had been served and a couple sitting at the bar. Overall very slow, which is what I like to be honest. We sat at the bar and the bartender plopped down the water and menus without saying anything to us. \\n\\nThis bartender was the most pretentious dude around and wouldn't give us the time of day. I'm from Seattle, I can handle a pretentious bar, and usually they serve some really awesome cocktails. It's the price you pay for a knowledgable staff, fine. But he didn't introduce himself or tell us any of the drink specials and we were pretty put off. Then when he came to take our orders we asked what he recommends. He vaguely said \\"it's all good\\". Again no eye contact.  And he promptly walked away from us to the other end of the bar to put a glass away. \\n\\nWhen he came back we asked for the top three cocktails. He asked what spirit we would like (great question! Kudos) and then he walked away before we could answer... to do something unimportant. Again. \\n\\nThen a coworker of his told him there was escargot to try in the back. At which point he walked into the kitchen and forgot about us. We waited for about five minutes and then we decided that the bad tastes in our mouths wouldn't go away and we left, determined not to let this guy ruin our rare and coveted date night. \\n\\nI've honestly never had such poor service.

Throughout the entire meal, she never once stopped by our table to make sure we were doing ok or to check and see if we needed anything.

After arriving at Franklin around 9am on a Tuesday, I had spent the last three hours chatting with an Austin local and his friends about the underbelly of the Central Texas barbecue scene, the families, the fights, the politics. I had been instructed on the best way to order, had chatted with two California girls about ACL, had even looked at the menu board a thousand times. But when I stepped to the counter and saw Aaron Franklin grinning under dark tousled locks, his knife poised above a gorgeous moist brisket gleaming like onyx, I stuttered. Nothing else came.\\n\\nAaron grinned more and broke the silence, asking about my visit with disarmingly genuine interest. I finally managed to order a moist brisket and sausage plate with beans, salad, and bread, along with a pound of brisket for my Dad in Fort Worth, which he further moistened and wrapped like the devil so it would be good that evening. (I love the concern Aaron showed for the meat -- he made me promise to consume it that day.) Moving down the line for drinks, I was still shaky with anticipation but somehow managed to chat with everyone (they were all attractive) and pay. My friends grabbed a table and squeezed trays together and began to eat.\\n\\nAnd you know what came next. Thick ribbons of the finest brisket I have ever tasted melted in my mouth, lightly seasoned, impossibly well-smoked, and perfect, while each bite through the sausage's crackled casing yielded unctuous, fatty juices and spicy, coarse morsels of meat. The beans had a pleasant bite while the salad refreshingly cut through the meat's richness, and the white bread slices beautifully soaked up the sauces and juices. We spent about 15 minutes in silent worship, finally coming back together to toast with Shiner Bock over dessert. Mindful of the limited tables, we rose to head over to the lake, ruined for all other Texas barbecue.\\n\\n(Aaron Franklin, you don't need me to tell you: your passion, artistry, and skill are stunning and inspiring.

Cantina","address":"180 Walker St SW, Ste B","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3.5","text":"(Finally!) Made it to No Mas for dinner last night (with a group of friends).  Heard about it a few years back when we were looking at lofts in the Castleberry Hill area, peeked in, but never ate there.  Now, jumping ahead a few years, some friends suggested we eat there prior to a Dome event nearby that we were all attending.  (It was either \\"No Mas\\" or \\"Bottle Rocket.\\"  Obviously, we chose the former; thus, this review.)  Our good friends said that they'd been there a number of times and always had fine meals and a good time.  (The reviews I read prior to actually going were very mixed:  some great; some awarding it a boobie prize.  I was leery, but we all agreed that quick-service trumped good sushi and a 45-minute-plus service time that was \\"Bottle Rocket.\\")  To start, it was raining, so the valet service was a welcome.  Inside, the place was beginning to hop, so we had a 20-minute wait.  The large bar was a great start for all of us to chit-chat over starter drinks.  The decor of No Mas is quite eclectic, very expansive, and brimming with all sorts of artwork and doo-dads.  Really eye-catching and interesting.  Once we were called for dinner, and settled at one of their many oversized booths, the dining experience began.  (This review is strictly of my orders.)  I started with an appetizer of the fried calamari with jalapenos and red peppers.  (If there's a calamari appetizer on any menu, that is what I always order.  For me, the way the calamari is cooked will pretty much tell me what the rest of the meal will be like.  If it's overcooked, I can guarantee that my entree will be disappointing!  It never fails me.)  The appetizer arrived lightly battered and perfectly cooked -- a little on the oily-side, but great flavor.  The sliced battered and fried jalapenos and red bell peppers were also a great complement, as was the two sides of dipping sauces.  Naturally, everyone had to have a taste, and all were impressed.  (This boded well for what was to come.)  I ordered the burrito grande plate -- I know, how boring! -- and what arrived was a bit disappointing in looks, as the burrito certainly didn't look \\"grande\\" to me.  Nevertheless, and surprisingly, the thing was stuffed with an abundant amount of tasty chicken, black beans, and all sorts of great flavors!  And the refried beans and Mexican-style rice sides were equally tasty.  I couldn't believe I ate the whole thing because I was completely stuffed halfway through!  It was just too good to leave (or take home, for that matter)!  Accompanying my dinner was an overpriced ($11), but very good 1800 margarita (on the rocks) to wash everything down smoothly.  And, of course, prior to the appetizer and entree, the ubiquitous baskets of perfectly fried tortilla chips and flavorful salsa didn't help with making everyone feeling stuffed by the time the entrees were served.  (Only negative was that they didn't have any super-hot salsa; merely Cholula sauce to enhance the salsa's mild heat.)  Everyone else, too, enjoyed their respective entrees immensely!  (And, too, being that it was a rainy night, I pre-tipped the valet well upon arrival, with the hope that my car would be upfront.  Sure enough, it was the first one ready to rock-n-roll...!)  :D  PS:  Did I mention the 94 health score?

They ask three times before it comes out what I wanted (after already ringing it up), there is butter on it half the time, and every single time they charge our debit card for $2+ what the bill is for. After bringing it up the repeated overcharging the debit card to the \\"manager\\" we were told it happens to everyone, that the money really isn't out of our account that we can still use that money, and that we were giving them attitude. What wasn't said, as customer service I assume should go, is that they are sorry, it is a problem with their credit card processing setup and the owners have not done anything to change it, but they'll make the call to get it fixed. Two employees told us that there are customers irate all the time over the overcharging, but not only have the owners done nothing about it but that they, the staff, can do nothing about it. Further, he said I shouldn't be upset and that I am wrong: that I don't know how banking works. That's a very nice to hear from a business that overcharges every customer's bank account that uses a debit card. I'm a CPA that has audited banks for years so I do know somewhat how banking works. We also bank with the same bank they do & we also use as a business credit card processing companies. \\n\\n903 Mills Market and the rude manager who likes to argue just doesn't  get it: (1) it's the Principle of charging customers more than they owe; (2) telling customers there's nothing they can do about it since it's the credit card processing company's fault; (3) telling customers they don't know how banking works; (4) telling the customers that the owners can't speak English so they can't speak to me to resolve the issue. Our staff speaks many different languages so I asked which language the owners spoke so we could establish some communication, but he wouldn't tell me. \\n\\nVery poor customer service. Very poor business operations. Fixing this problem is a 15 - 20 minute call to their credit card processing company. Instead it's costing them customers.

My out of town guest seemed to be having a religious experience eating the pulled pork, so I'm gonna guess that's pretty good too.\\n\\nHad the sweet sauce on the brisket, and their famed espresso sauce on the ribs, and both are really good.

They experienced some unfortunate equipment malfunctions and delayed supply deliveries.  Accordingly, the food was a little slow, but the service was super friendly, oh, and the food was delicious.  The staff were all apologetic, and humbly requested I come back after they had ironed out some kinks.\\n\\nTherefore, I decided to try it again a week later, and was thankful I did!  The service is always friendly, and the food is excellent as well (and much faster, now!).  So far I have had the d√∂ner sandwich ($7) and the d√∂ner plate ($8) but they offer much more!  They also have sausages, schnitzel, cabbage rolls, and other German delights; I am slowly eating my way across the menu, one day at a time. The prices may seem high when compared to some of the street vendors (tack on a buck or two to what you might expect from the carts), but I think the prices are fine, considering everything is made fresh: bread baked daily, fresh cut fries, they even have an awesome machine where they dump a bunch of oranges in the top and you can see a Rube Goldberg-esque device juice them before your very eyes! (and although I love other German restaurants around, this one is definitely cheaper...and closer!)  At times, with all the attention to the food and friendly service, I feel more like I am walking into a friend's kitchen instead of a restaurant; quite the German dining experience away from Deutschland!\\n\\nI recommend you check it out.

Is that a light summer throw on your wicker + cushion chair? Well done, Yebo, the interior designer deserves a raise.\\n\\nMy girlfriends and I came here on a Saturday evening. The only reservation we could get for a party of 5 was for 5:30pm and although the restaurant was pretty empty when we arrived, it quickly filled up during our meal.\\n\\nTo be honest, I spent entirely too much time deciding on what to order and I think it's mostly because the variety in the menu selection is not that great and not proportionate. I googled most everything on the menu just to understand the size comparison. This is what I mean: there are four options for entrees, they range from a light tuna grain bowl to a 12oz ribeye. Everything else is either a shared meal like their paella, snacks to share, or small plates -- In theory this is fine, but there's a huge discrepancy between the 3 bites of their tuna poke to their three serving of oxtail tacos, both of which fall under the small plates section. I originally planned to order the poke but after seeing a picture I realized I would have to order two small plates and then run the gamble of another serving size mismatch.  \\n\\nBut, we were able to try so many dishes between the 5 of us:\\n-BILTONG south african beef jerky\\n-PERI-PERI POPCORN\\n-MAC & CHEESE: peppadew peppers, panko crust\\n-OXTAIL TACOS: bone marrow stew, tomatoes, dried habanero peppers, haus coleslaw\\n-BOBOTIE BUNNY CHOW: savory ground beef curry with apples, raisins, onions, fried egg, brioche bun\\n-SOCKEYE SALMON: cedar plank grilled, blackening spice, coconut rice, pineapple dragonfruit salsa\\n-TRUFFLE FRIES: haus ketchup\\n\\nI ended up choosing the salmon as my main and sharing the mac and cheese with my girlfriend who ordered the oxtail tacos, which turned out to be the same size serving as my salmon (see what I mean?!). The salmon was seasoned well and cooked perfectly. I loved the pineapple dragonfruit salsa, it complemented the fish very well. The bed of coconut rice was a tad mushy. The mac and cheese was very, very good. If you are a mac and cheese fan and you're debating this $9 add-on, get it! It's worth it. I loved her oxtail tacos as well, they were very tasty. The Bobotie Bunny Chow was also a table favorite and a very unique choice - thumbs up on the perfectly cooked fried egg! The hands down, most absolute delicious item ordered between all of us were the truffle fries -- do not do yourself a disservice by passing on this. These were some of the best truffle fries I've ever had; you can really taste the truffle in every bite. They are cooked to a perfect golden brown, you can taste the fresh potato and there's an appropriately light, salty crisp. I don't know how they do it. Their house ketchup that comes with these fries is also oh-so-delicious!\\n\\nI didn't think there was anything special about the $11 Biltong or the $5 peri-peri popcorn. Skip these and spend the $16 on one of their delicious house crafted cocktails or a second order of truffle fries.\\n\\nAt the end of the day, my bill totaled around $70 for a drink + entree + side + and my share of the appetizers. Although I enjoyed most of my dinner, I question if Yebo is worth the $70-per-person-meal-category. One could argue that skipping the drink, full-size entree and a small plate would bring Yebo back to the $30-per-person-meal-category, but then are you really enjoying yourself?

The honey and cheese is a great combo but it's a little hard to pick up the honey, as it was drizzled in the bottom of the dish.

No complaints\\nCreamy jalape√±o grits: pretty good but something was a little off... slight lack of flavor and I feel like the temperature wasn't very high when it was served and due to the plating, the grits lost heat quite quickly. And cold grits are kinda eww... I love when grits are served in one of those mini cast iron skillets because it looks cute and keeps the grits nice and hot!\\n\\nOverall the meal was great for a quick brunch, and the three dishes we ordered was enough to satiate us.

You won't regret any decision here, and don't ever forget to try the Cincinnati 5-way: it's good stuff too.\\n\\nTheir beer selection of course is something of legend, as it rotates frequently and offers a wide array of choices from light to dark across the fermented spectrum. Mixed drink options are colorful too, my favorite being \\"Peanut Butter Jelly Time,\\" a devious amalgamation of peanut-infused vodka and grape soda. \\n\\nSpeaking of soda, want to relive your childhood? The red pop on tap takes care of that for me, as well the curtain that lines the window between the kitchen and the dining area: it's made out of the same early 90s baseball-themed bedsheets I had as a kid. \\n\\nThe rest of the place is no slouch in terms of decoration either, full of artwork that evokes a zany hipster-like love letter to regional sports and rock music. The music they play in there is also exclusively from local musicians, which is cool too. I'll leave your imagination to devise what this must all look and sound like before you go there and experience it for yourself.\\n\\nFinally, everyone who works there is super nice and has a deep appreciation for what they do. They have just enough beer knowledge to be dangerous, and possess a confident command of the many menu choices to offer a litany of recommendations to the unsure or uninitiated.

It has so many positives, and some negatives, so I figured it couldn't be a five star (but it's close). Me and my college buddies like to go to the Pickled Onion or even Press Box every now and again for a raucous good time, but the Wild Horse is by far our favorite place to go. The atmosphere is great for the thirty something crowd (although I'm not that old yet), anyone can really fit in there. For large parties the restaurant section is littered with couches and comfortable seating and the service is good. It's a perfect place to go with a lot of friends.\\n     I believe this place does so well, however, because of the popularity of the bar and those going after 10. The bar menu is good with lots of well prepared choices. This is to say you will not simply get cheap chicken fingers when you go. I believe this menu is available only after 9 until close. And this is the time when I usually go. On top of the food and atmosphere the drinks are great. Actually great may be an understatement. I am a huge fan of beers and not only does Wild Horse offer great selection of fine beers like Duvel and Chimay, but they also have THE BEST standard beers on tap. The Bass and Old Speckled Hen is the best I have ever had. They mujst religiously care for their taps, as the beer is perfect every time I go. In my opinion I will always choice to pay 4.50 for a great beer over 3.00 for a mediocre one. And I can promise you if you go for drinks here you will not be disappointed.\\n     Now onto the restaurant portion of Wild Horse. They have a very good menu and it is a great place to go for a nice dinner. Again the atmosphere is great and cozy, and you can really come in for a up scale relaxed good time. That being said, the prices for dinner are quite high, and although the food is eclectic and up scale, I feel that it does not warrant the prices they charge. Everytime I have gone for dinner, I have had a great time, but the food has been overseasoned. For example, one time I had the rack of lamb. The meat was cooked perfectly and paired very nicely with the figs and mint couscous. However, the sauce and other spices they added to the meal only subtracted from its greatness, overpowering the nice fresh flavors that would be expected from the figs and mint. All in all I cannot say their food is bad at all. I am just saying that they should simplify things  a little or perhaps charge a little less for dinner.\\n     All in all, I have to say this place is very close to a five overall. As for the bar or late night portion of Wild Horse I have to give it a very strong five stars. This place is a definite must go for after work drinks or some late night fun."},{"name":"Border Caf√©","address":"32 Church St","city":"Cambridge","stars":"4","text":"Go during the night, you will get the best.

I actually didn't know this place existed until a few weeks ago, which is likely attributable to the fact that it's somewhat isolated (both geographically and ideologically) from the rest of the midtown entertainment scene. Regardless, I'm pleased to have added it to the restaurant rolodex and will undoubtedly return for a drink or three in the near future.   \\n\\nFood: Cypress specializes in casual American bar fare with a contemporary twist. Many of the dishes also use ingredients sourced from local culinary heavyweights, including Holeman & Finch, Sublime doughnuts, and High Road ice cream.  During my visit, I opted for the mac n' cheese as an appetizer and the chicken club as an entr√©e, both of which were perfectly acceptable.\\n\\nService: I visited Cypress with a party of approximately 20 people and our waitress did an outstanding job of accommodating the group in a friendly and efficient manner. She even agreed to split the check, which I know is an absolute nightmare with a group that size.  \\n\\nAtmosphere: I didn't have the opportunity to experience the interior of Cypress, as most of the individuals in my group had already set-up camp on the outdoor patio when I arrived. The outdoor patio features both low and high top seating, as well as ceiling fans and a television. Unfortunately, it's also the primary congregation point for hoards of tragic, chain-smoking bargoyles - the smoke lingered under the partially covered patio, which made for a less than desirable dining experience. \\n\\nCost: Moderately priced. Appetizers are $5-$10, salads are $6-$12, sandwiches and burgers are $9-$12, and entrees are $10-$14. Sides are $3.50 and desserts are $4.  \\n\\nOther: Cypress offers daily promotions throughout the week, including $5 Philly's on Monday (7PM), Triva on Tuesday (8PM), 1/2 price wine bottles on Thursday (7PM-11PM), 1/2 price appetizers on Friday (5PM-7PM), and weekend brunch (10AM-3PM).

And that's no small feat - us Texans are SERIOUS about our barbecue.\\n\\nThey moved from the trailer to a brick-and-mortar location in 2011.

You will not regret waiting in line (especially since you can BYOB - it's something of a tailgate atmosphere most days, with kids throwing frisbees and lawn chairs with coolers of beer).\\n\\n[insert picture of their food]\\n\\nYeah, that's pretty amazing.  The masterpiece really is the brisket - and please don't ruin it with sauce.  I admit that the sauce is ALSO amazing, but the brisket really, really doesn't need it.  Franklin's unique bark (that's what you call the crispy outer layer of a brisket) drives home the point - a crumbling, tender, flavorful piece of beef that stands on its own.  An incredible umami is created by the contradiction of textures and flavors when you consume the bark and the incredibly juicy and tender beef at the same time.\\n\\nHis secret?  A salt and pepper rub and cooking low and slow on smoker powered by Texas oak.  That's it.  No magic additives.  No special sauces, no crazy spices, just Texas barbecue done so well, it might be the best it can be done.\\n\\nI know that I actually wrote a more eloquent review of La Barbecue.  I know I did.

Came in on a Friday and expected it to be busy but there were barely 10 people inside. That does not explain the slow service. The inside is dark and kind of a strange set up. There was an older gentleman cleaning off menus when we walked in and told us to sit wherever, but didn't bother to bring us a menu. Our table was sticky and wobbly. A waitress eventually brought us a menu and barely asked for our drink orders, but we didn't have the beverage menu. Asked for a beer and she rudely responded \\"don't have that\\" - no suggestions for something similar. Gave us a grunt to confirm our order and walked away.  She brought back our drinks but didn't take our food order. The younger kid came by eventually and asked if our order had been taken and showed at least some concern that it hadn't yet.  He was great.  The food took FOREVER to come out, despite the place being basically empty. The food was disappointing. Our fries were in a pool of dirty gross grease.  They tasted like dirty grease - they need to change the fryalator oil.  The bacon on the burgers was basically petrified it was so badly cooked.  My boyfriend had a hash brown on his burger that clearly had freezer burn and was and was also dripping in grease and overcooked. The egg on his burger was over cooked and dried out.  I had asked for the onion rings with my burger to be placed on the side and the young kid that took my order was careful to write this down but the kitchen ignored that because they were on the burger.  He offered to fix it but I didn't want to wait an hour to do something that was easy enough to do myself.  The burger buns were disgustingly greasy as well. We never saw the other waitress to ask for a drink refill. So we had to ask the younger kid who apparently was not old enough to serve alcohol and the grouchy waitress eventually brought them over."},{"name":"Commercial Street Cafe","address":"3599 Commercial Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"3.5","text":"Pretty good coffee and baked goods (made on premises).

They weren't the last time I wanted to visit. Read on the Yelp thread that they have one of the best burgers in Vancouver, so this is what I came for. My friend was indecisive of what to get but as a lamb fanatic I suggested the buttermilk lamb belly. Our server asked if I'd like to get some fries with my burger. To be honest, I didn't think I'd be able to stuff it down but didn't want my plate to look so bare so I added the fries for an additional $3. A side note: server told us that the restaurant is tapas style and usually 3 dishes can satisfy 2 persons and the portion size is from small to large starting from the top to bottom of the menu. \\n\\nWe decided to put in our order for the lamb belly (3.5/5-$13) and the burger 2.0 (4/5-$15) with a side of fries (1/5-$3) and see how that goes. You get five pieces of lamb belly and honestly that is enough. It came with garlic aioli and sweet pepper sauce. I absolutely love the aioli but the pepper sauce was a bit sweet in my opinion. Not bad for the price and due to the fattiness of the belly, you'll be full and wish you had a side order of salad or something tangy to cut through the grease. The burger did live up to its hype though not the best burger in town. I do feel that it tasted better with each bite. The fries on the other hand is the worst fries I've had. There was no life to it. You might as well have told me it was yesterday's leftovers. Also had no taste to it. Had 1 one and was about to surrender but went back in for a second to test if I just had a bad one. My friend tried after and also said it was horrible. So sad that we had to pay for it too. Otherwise, the food was not bad for what we got. \\n\\nAfter a long while of pondering on whether we should get dessert or not, my friend opted for the sweet honey corn cake with pear and caramel anglaise (2.5/5 - $9). Price-wise is normal for what I'd pay for dessert at a different establishment but it was also not up to expectation. The corn cake aka cornbread was so dry. It had the texture of a dried-up sponge (never ate one but you know what I mean). The dish overall was a bit sweet due to the caramel but the other elements like the chopped up pear and the corncake didn't go well together. Felt like they just decided to throw a bunch of ingredients on a skillet and serve it up as a dessert. Not impressed and disappointed.\\n\\nNote: Service was good. Our glass was never empty. They kept topping it up. She checked on us once in awhile. The decor was nice and gives off a hipster yet relaxing atmosphere. Last note, Get the burger! Avoid the fries! Better off with dessert elsewhere. Price is not bad."},{"name":"Taco Cabana","address":"12525 N Mopac Expwy","city":"Austin","stars":"2","text":"UPDATE: DON'T GO TO THIS LOCATION!!!!

I was riding the Amtrak from SF to Seattle and the Portland stop was the longest (~45 min). We got in at 3:35 and were to depart at 4:20. Of the places that were open on a Sunday, this one seemed to be the perfect fit: hot food, relatively good reviews, fresh(ish), and nearby.\\n\\nIt took me 10 minutes to find the place. I had to orient myself and use Google navigate. The entrance I used is not clearly marked. Once I entered and ordered, my two slices of pepperoni were popped in the oven for a few minutes and I was on my way back to the train. The folks on board looked at me with envy. They went in the station and bought chips and other snacks. That made my two slices taste that much better.\\n\\nThe sauce is tasty and the pepperonis were spicy, just the way I like.

Based on that acclaim, I came here for a lunch and thought it was decent.  However, after visiting again for dinner, I have to conclude I'm not impressed.\\n\\nFirst of all, the decor is really nice.  Definitely an upgrade over your typical Asian restaurant.  And the bubble teas are terrific- they have about 10 different flavors.  I've tried the coconut milk, the regular, the green tea, and the strawberry.  The coconut milk is my favorite of the bunch.\\n\\nI wasn't impressed with the food however.  Between my visits, I've tried the Basil Chicken, Cashew Chicken, Schezuan Chicken, Kung Pao Chicken, and Veggie Fried Rice (yes, I love chicken).  The basil chicken was the best of the bunch, and had some good flavor.  However, the others were very ordinary.  The Kung Pao was overloaded with peanuts.  And the chicken in the Schezuan dish seemed undercooked.  We thought it was very slimy and had a disgusting texture.  We also asked for the dishes to be very spicy, and they were not spicy at all.\\n\\nService was a mixed bag.  The staff was very nice and checked in our table often.  However, one of the entrees came much earlier than the others, which is annoying.  And another entree was made incorrectly (they brought chicken instead of the requested shrimp).  The kicker is that they didn't offer to re-make the dish.  They strongly encouraged us to keep the chicken and just order the shrimp next time (we decided to keep it).  They were also not very accommodating of the vegetarian in our group; the waiter refused to make a special tofu dish for her.\\n\\nSo overall it's just not a place I'd recommend to friends."},{"name":"Super Fusion Cuisine","address":"54 Mt Auburn St","city":"Watertown","stars":"4.5","text":"I love this place!

The center is thin, but not crispy, barely strong enough to hold up the toppings, and the outside is all subtle flaky buttery layers.  The pizza was topped with mushrooms, caramelized onions, and a little bit of brie which was a perfect combo.  We also got the orecchiette with sundried tomatoes, broccoli, goat cheese, and lamb sausage in a thin garlicky broth which got caught up in the little shells of pasta deliciously.\\n\\nThe service was incredibly attentive, but certainly not overbearing.  The only hint of pretentiousness I felt was when we were asked if we wanted to sit in the \\"cafe\\" or the \\"dining room\\" which are actually one large room divided by a low barrier- quite silly.

I said no and quickly realized and got her attention for paper napkins. I waited several mins, still no napkins. I walked over closer towards the back kitchen entrance and stood there for a good 5 mins. The chef in front of me did not acknowledge me, the other waiters/waitresses who walked by did not either. They must not know the simple 3 feet rule.. The entire time I'm just standing there watching my waitress write down her schedule it seems like.

But kindly replied to her you are my waitress the others are not. \\n\\nMy second disappointment is my $17 burger entree. I did not expect the fries to be old and the patty to be at almost room temperature..and this is before the paper napkin incident btw.

It's not amazing. It's not the top restaurant in Boston. And the service is just sub-par. I was there earlier this week for a 6-pp dinner, let's discuss...\\n\\nFirst, the bar was nice, as was the bartender. He was friendly and helpful and actually knew a good deal about wine. He recommended a sparkling pinot noir and we really liked it. He also recommended their tapas plate, which was delightful, even if it wasn't really hot. The little bites did in fact burst in your mouth, some oozing with cheese. We were quite pleased and I planned to order that at the dinner table when all our guests arrived.\\n\\nDinner was simply okay. The options sound so inventive on the menu, but some turned out to simply be lackluster. The scallops with pork really is delicious, but the tuna spring rolls were so disappointing - a big hunk of raw tuna wrapped in a fried roll, very bad. The fish tacos were good, but felt like something I - or anyone - could whip up at home, quite easily. Many people complimented their entrees, but mine was \\"blah\\". The cumin-dusted fries were almost bitter and over-smoked, so I figured they used way too much cumin. The salad of arugula and onions was okay, but the onions were red and sliced very thick - just didn't feel like there was any attention to detail there. Now I should add, my colleague had a beautiful beef short rib dish (it was stunning and she loved it). But overall, besides the little tapas (which we couldn't order in the dining room) the food was inconsistent.\\n\\nThe service was worse, frankly. Our drinks arrived and the server called my wine by several different names and made me feel like I may not be getting what I ordered - and when I got a 2nd glass, it tasted different from the first. The service to refresh our cocktails was very slow. And, our server may have been new (don't know) but he forgot ingredients of different menu items and had to fly back to the kitchen a few times. \\n\\nOverall, the atmosphere was lively and the drinks were very well-received. The tapas were great, but the entrees were really sub-par, especially at the prices we paid. I would return for cocktails, but not for dinner.

I stopped by on a Sunday afternoon around 3pm, and it was really busy during that time, but since they have a big restaurant I don't think there was much of a wait. Since I was just doing take-out, you can go to the special take out window they have on the right hand side when you walk in. However, calling in your order ahead of time is highly recommend if you want to avoid waiting the 10-15 minutes for your food.

I wish I actually listened when the girl behind the counter advised me to double check my order, but I figured it was so simple they couldn't possibly mess it up. But I had NO cornbread!  Anyway, onto rating the rest of the food. The brisket was dry and disappointing, and there wasn't that much fat even though I asked for the fatty brisket. The flavor was good, and the bbq sauce definitely made it more palatable, but I wouldn't order this again. The ribs were the favorite- very tender/fall of the bone, and had really good flavor. The wings were also solid, and tender, and the mac n cheese was also a highlight. I would definitely get everything except for the brisket again.

It is located in the Tomorrowland area of Magic Kingdom. When you walk inside, the first thing you see are large \\"Bay\\" areas. The bays are one of the most annoying aspects of this restaurant because certain bays serve certain food off the menu. I usually get the Bay 2/3 items, so I have to walk around to the longer Bay 2/3 lines.\\n\\nThis venue has your basic counter restaurant options, such as bacon cheeseburgers and chicken sandwiches. They do offer a large 1/2 chicken and rib meal, which my friend often gets due to the massive amounts of meat. Starlight also offers kids choices (and they let adults get those kids choices), which is great if you are looking for a lighter meal. During my last visit, I ordered the bacon cheeseburger and my wife order the Turkey sandwich. Both came with fries, and her meal came with grapes (2 bags since they were out of carrots) and a small water. Our entrees were both very good and filling.\\n\\nOne of the better parts of this restaurant is the topping bar! The topping bar has a wide variety of toppings, such as mushrooms, onions, sauerkraut, and other basic condiments. While not quite as exciting as others make it out to be, the topping bar does present a nice added feature for your meal, and many people often get a huge serving of the cooked mushrooms as a side instead of a topping.\\n\\nOverall, Starlight Cafe is a good counter service restaurant at Disney.

The cheese rolls and sour cream that came with the omelet were just what I needed to save my tongue. I ate the egg and sour cream and left the salsa behind.  Hours later, I still have heartburn and feel sick. I have never been a fan of spicy food, but I think of myself as having a strong stomach and relatively high tolerance for spice. As I said before, I love Mexican food, so maybe the chef messed up and added twice as much spice to my meal instead of leaving out the jalapenos (I didn't see jalapenos so maybe he added more red chili?). Thinking that my mouth and stomach needed a break, I ordered a hot chocolate. I asked the waitress for something not too spicy. I had three sips of the chocolate azteca (I asked for half the regular amount of spice, and I'm sure the waitress was trying to help) and I felt ill. I asked for whipped cream, which helped, but I basically spent $13 for heartburn and an empty stomach (couldn't eat much). The chili de arbol aside, the hot chocolate tasted like Swiss Miss and was too watery. I was expecting the thick, rich bean to cup chocolate - like I had in Mexico or at Rick Bayless' Xoco in Chicago - their version of Azteca is made of fresh-ground chocolate, water, chile, and  allspice, and costs much less and is delightfully, pleasantly  spicy.  I finally understood all the 5 star reviews: A flier at the counter promises free coffee if you show your raving yelp review. Disgusting!"},{"name":"Sforno Trattoria Romana","address":"1308 Pearl St","city":"Boulder","stars":"4","text":"Initially had a terrible experience when trying to place a reservation here. I called and emailed and never received a response. Fast forward a year later and when searching for something on Pearl I decided to give it a try one more time.\\n\\nGreat experience! Italian is very over-done in Boulder (Pasta Jay's, I'm looking at you!) and every dish here was balanced and perfect- not too heavy or cheesy, and at lunch we received free bread and they offered half servings! For four cheese gnocchi (my all-time favorite Italian dish!) it was something like $10 and all the prices were reasonable. I got two meals out of my half serving, so for a college student on a budget this was a great deal for tasty Italian food. Seems like it would be a good restaurant for families too.

The portions were still plenty, even split between two! (They even plated our portions separately, so these pics are half portions).

We were concerned when a table that was seated several minutes AFTER we were and ordered well after us got their food. Then a waitress comes out and waits on a man close to us as shortly after he sits down.

I almost forgot the \\"sliders\\" made from burnt ends... they were also very large for a slider, but the flavor was intense...

I know it's not a long walk, but it certainly feels like it when you're hungry.  Besides that though, Masa was a wonderful way to end Restaurant Week 2011 for me.\\n\\nWe started with a bottle of wine - half off.  We basically could have stopped there and I'd be in love.  But then they bring out this bread (cornbread and regular) and these butters and sauce like things to dip into it.\\n\\nThen my app comes out - pork tostadas.  Think crunchy flat tacho shell, crispy pork goodness and veggie garnish.  Delicious, flavorful.  More please.  My friend got the soup and said it was so good he could make a dinner out of it.\\n\\nFor the main course I got the chicken.  The chicken itself was kind of bland, just crisp cooked chicken.  But the sauce it came in was soo good I was sopping it up when the food was gone.\\n\\nAnd for dessert, banana bread pudding.  A little too much of whatever spice was involved (nutmeg or something?) but delicious nonetheless. I ate every last bite.\\n\\nOur waitress was friendly but a little bit awkward.  However she made a great recommendation on the wine.  And the place is much bigger than I anticipated and very nicely decorated.\\n\\nFinal verdict? I'd go back.

I attribute this lovely establishment to my college heyday - my first year mentor herded her group (me included) onto the Cambridge bus and we came here for a dinner to bond. Subsequently, this lively tex-mex place has been the place of many first dates, birthday parties, and meetings with old friends. The price, the food, and the casual cheeriness of this restaurant is near and dear to my heart. And if you're looking for a place that will be a catch-all place that's casual enough for you to eat 3 baskets of hot tortilla chips and delicious salsa but also delicious enough to impress the elitist food snobs that are sure to populate Cambridge, this place is for you. \\n\\nFood - this menu encompasses so many items, and sticks true to authentic tex mex offerings. Blackened catfish? check. crawfish? check. Sizzling fajitas? yes. Amazing black and corn empanadas pretty much the size of half of your face and yet you get three of them with a ~feisty~ roasted red pepper sauce? I get those every time I come here - crisp and golden, tender on the inside, and perfectly seasoned. DID I MENTION THEY GIVE OUT BASKETS OF FREE CHIPS, SALTED AND GOLDEN BROWN TO PERFECTION WITH A SALSA OF UPSTANDING CHARACTER? I refuse to go to Mexican places without free chips (might be the california mexican food snob in me), and these are soooo good. You will not regret it. Oh, and the portion sizes are like, the opposite of small plates. Quesadillas the size of your face, people. Small plates are the bane of my foodie lifestyle existence. (what is the point of paying 2x the price for half the food. THE MATH DOES NOT ADD UP.) Also I swear if you come to this place you will give up chipotle because the prices are about the same but for 10x the quality of mexican food. ok that's enough about food. \\n\\nAs for the service, they can, and will, get very busy. During the summer you'll be pretty lucky space wise, but during the school year and winter you can forget it and you better make a reservation. The service is pretty good and decent, and the place is beautiful - it's lit and decorated with funky murals, the salt/pepper are in corona bottles, and the whole place has a red glow to it that makes the establishment look like a warm refuge in midst of cold, cambridge weather. \\n\\nI love this place. enough to write close to 4 paragraphs about it, and that hardly describes any of the items on the menu. But when you go there, you will feel certainly at home. For me, a California transplant who decided to go to college on the other side of the country, it became a sort of a home in Cambridge.

For only $14 per person (including tip; cue angels singing). \\n\\nIn addition to the perfect fact that I could request and fit fried chicken, candied bacon, maple syrup and whipped cream in one mouthful, the kitchen staff and servers also moved quickly, smoothly & seamlessly, as if in a well-orchestrated breakfast ballet.

I've never had food that tasted like it was just picked out of the garden that day and put onto my plate. I had the opportunity to sample The Delilah (chicken salad sandwich), The Riverview (salmon sourdough sandwich), the spinach and quinoa salad, sweet potato ginger soup, and collard green soup. My favorites out of these were The Riverview and the spinach and quinoa salad. The salmon in The Riverview was so moist and fresh (I can't stop using the word \\"fresh\\" in this review lol) and the sourdough bread brought a great flavor to the sandwich. I loved the salad mostly because of the mushrooms and radishes in it. They were, you guessed it, fresh as could be. The mushrooms had a great taste on their own and the radishes were as crunchy and crisp as a potato chip. I could have used more quinoa in the salad since that what was listed in the salad's description. Another criticism I have is the collard green soup. It had very little flavor.

Elk, antelope, steak, pork, you name it. When I dined here, I knew I had to push the envelope a bit and went all in on the elk. \\n\\nThis dish was a work of art. The elk was a crescendo of flavors, starting from the simple, singular flavor of the meat, to a gradual blend of sugared grapes, brussel sprouts, and more. There are exactly 5 pieces of elk arranged in an arc on the plate, and with each succeeding piece of elk, there is another (i.e. n+1) ingredient paired with it to add to the overall palette. At the end, it's really an explosion of fresh (think: veal), savory, yet smooth and sweet flavors all in one bite. Eating each piece of elk one-by-one for me really built up the excitement and rhythm of the dish to its overall, symphonic conclusion.  \\n\\nDrinks - bravo as well. The bartenders here are very friendly, provide reasonable recommendations, and go out of their way to make sure you know what you're getting yourself into. My colleague who dined with me was a sucker for their Manhattan, and I personally enjoyed my umbrella-adorned cocktail as well. Trust me when I say there are some true mixologists in this establishment. \\n\\nLastly, I'd be remiss to not comment on the overall feel of LD. I'm a fan of the atmosphere here, and although it is admittedly geared towards a business-type dinner (at least on weekday nights), the ambience hit a soft balance between intimacy and community. A nice plus is being able to see the chefs hustling and bustling about the kitchen, such that you're right in the weeds of the meal with them. \\n\\nThis went longer than expected, but there's a reason why Lonesome Dove is among Austin's top restaurants. I had to pay a visit just to see for myself, and I wasn't disappointed."},{"name":"Jake's Famous Crawfish","address":"401 SW 12th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"We found their Cute sidewalk patio when strolling down the streets unfortunately the whole experience just wasn't up to par.

When my friend and I heard about their $8 2-course brunch deal, we had to try it out. So we made a reservation for Sunday morning (which I recommend you do, as it was packed when we arrived). We were seated about 15 minutes after our reservation time and ordered drinks and our first course: carmelized plaintain empanadas with cinnamon cream cheese. We enjoyed them very much (although it felt a bit weird to essentially eat dessert before the entree.. I think I actually would have preferred to have this as the second course). \\n\\nWe then ordered our main courses: Santa Fe eggs benedict. And waited. And waited. The restaurant was busy, but after a while it became pretty clear that the staff had forgotten about us. We were enjoying ourselves chatting and weren't starving because we had already nibbled on the empanadas, so it wasn't a major inconvenience. After about an hour, we tracked down a waiter and inquired about our food. A few minutes later, the extremely apologetic manager came to our table and announced that our brunch would be covered by the restaurant! Score! The food then came out very quickly and was absolutely delicious! My friend had ordered a side of bacon, and her eggs came out with chorizo. We weren't going to say anything (the meal was already free.. and hey, chorizo is delicious!), but the waitress noticed so brought an extra side of bacon. Thanks, Masa! And on a sleepy Sunday morning, what's better than a a 2-hour delicious, free brunch? Not much.\\n\\nA few months later, I returned with some friends for the happy hour tapas special. We were there between 6 and 8 PM on a Wednesday night, and the lounge was pretty empty. Their half-off tapas specials run until 7 on weekdays, so we made sure to order some combo platters which feature 1 of each of the 10 tapas ($5 total). We actually went a bit crazy (and wanted to order enough food before the special was over) so got 4 platters for 5 people. I'd say 3 would have been enough, but we still managed to finish most of them. Personal favorites were the jalapeno-cheese empanada, the bacon-wrapped date and the fish tacos. Also, keep in mind that the term \\"tapa\\" can be misleading.. these are just little bites and are not very gourmet, but the price and the variety are admirable.\\n\\nThe drink order is where our wallets were hit the hardest. We first ordered a carafe of the watermelon habanero margarita, which combined a deliciously sweet puree of watermelon with a defined, peppery kick. Delicious! The waiter also recommended the tres chiles margarita, so we opted for that one for the next round. The tres chiles margarita was very different than the watermelon habanero one, and I think I actually preferred it. It was less sweet and had more citrus flavors like lemon and orange. The chiles added a different kind of burn - slower and more subtle, which complemented the acidity very well. Spicy drinks can be hard to pull off, and Masa accomplishes the task extremely well. However, we still were a bit surprised to see the bill after expecting it to be a cheaper night because of the food specials. \\n\\nOverall, I really like Masa and the service there. Happy hour was a good experience and I'm glad we tried it out, but because of the price, I think I might just keep Masa on my radar for brunch. I would even be willing to pay for it."},{"name":"Screen Door","address":"2337 E Burnside St","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"The food was really amazing and lived up to every review we read before coming here.

Overall, however, we thought the fusion of Japanese and classic \\"American\\" items sometime seemed to work...and sometime...not so much.  My Southern Bar-B-Q style sushi roll was tasty.  But the burger/sushi combos did not really seem to blend so well.  The famous milk shakes were very nice, but I rather question the value-for-money.\\n\\nBiggest irritation was the service.  After being pretty quick to take our order, our server disappeared and reappeared only to deliver the drinks and appetizers.  After that there was a LONG wait for the food, without any explanation.  Water was not refilled.  We had to flag someone down to find out what the delays were.

Not only was our server very attentive and friendly, but she was honest about our questions and her recommendations. After having such a great experience the first time, I decided I'd have my birthday dinner here.\\n\\n I called 24 hours in advance to make a reservation. I figured that since it was for a party of 22, they'd be a bit annoyed that I waited until the last minute. But to my surprise, they were excited to get my business. The manager, Farish, who I knew from other places he has worked in the past, called to confirm the reservation and told me he'd have the table set for 25 just in case. \\n\\nWe had a room in the back that is sort of set off from the rest of the restaurant, which provided a more private atmosphere which was nice since there was so many of us. I appreciate that we basically had our own room without being charged a few because a few restaurants I looked at as possible places to host my birthday dinner wanted a fee to be paid for a private room. \\n\\nI thought that because there was about 23 of us that the services would not exactly be on pint but I was wrong. We had about three servers coming in and out of the room and they did so well. There is very limited space back there but they managed to move through the tight spaces while holding several dishes and drinks at a time with grace. \\n\\nThe steamed buns are perfect. They were nice and soft, and not too hot that you had to wait forever to enjoy them. And the crab rangoons actually had REAL CHUNKS of crab in them which is rare. I was happy they weren't just filled with cream cheese and nothing else like most places. My favorite thing was the boneless spare ribs which were perfectly tender, easily being cut with just a fork. My only negative critique was that the orange chicken was a little heavy on the orange/citrus but I'm not a huge citrus fan so maybe I'm not the best judge of that. I had an orange mai thai which was great, not too citrusy and the alcohol wasn't overpowering. The scorpion bowls were great as well. \\n\\nThey brought out complimentary desserts with candles and had NO PROBLEM splitting up the checks for us. Some servers roll their eyes when you ask for two or three separate checks and the waitress who divided the bill into about 6 separate checks did so without hesitation. \\n\\nA lot of people are commenting on the decor... I like it. I think the lighting is nice and while, yes, I agree that there is a bit of cultural appropriation going on with all of the Buddhas and some of the posters, I think it's important to keep in mind that the purpose of a restaurant is to serve good food and drinks and provided hospitable service, and that's exactly what you get at Shanghai.

Made a reservation on Open Table, the table was ready to go when we go there. They provide a coat check at the door. There's a decently sized bar area with high top tables. I really didn't enjoy my experience here. A few major CONS:\\n\\n-NOISE: the place is extremely noisy, I couldn't hear my date's voice and had to yell to say anything\\n-SERVICE: the waitresses looked bored, weren't friendly/enjoyable, and our waitress spilled Red Sangria all over the table and my forks. She didn't replace the forks or look surprised that she spilled. I couldn't hear the waitresses voice and she didn't explain meals/seasonings properly.\\n-FOOD: the food was disappointing, I ordered the chicken w/ beans, the chicken came on this creamy sauce that was EXTREMELY spicy, and I've eaten spicy food all over the world (Thailand, Fiji, Japan) and enjoy a hot spice, I don't enjoy being surprised or the kind of spice that burns your mouth and erases the flavor, it would've been different if I was warned about the spice, but the waitress never mentioned it and when I said \\"This is very spicy\\" she responded \\"Yes, it is.\\" In my chicken there was an extremely large, sharp piece of bone, probably 1.5\\" long with a sliced point on it. Again, I wasn't expecting this and all the waitress said is that \\"it's the cut of the chicken.\\" It must've been the sternum, but the bone was out of place and not something a typical customer expects when they order a \\"chicken breast.\\"\\n-EMERGENCY during dinner: there was some type of emergency during dinner that required a fire truck + emt, the ambulance and fire truck stayed for about 40 minutes. I know this is out of the restaurant's control, but they handled it poorly, everyone in the dining area was concerned and clearly upset by the emergency and the manager of the restaurant (it appeared) looked extremely frazzled and scared almost, which exaggerated the issue. Also, the restaurant didn't turn down the blaring music during the emergency.\\n\\nThe pros:\\n\\n-BREAD basket: came with 2pieces bread + 2pieces corn bread and 3 fun, spicy sauces\\n-TEQUILA: if you like tequila their drink menu has 2 whole pages dedicated to \\"tequila\\" drinks\\n\\n\\nDrinks range from $8-15.

I went with 2 friends, one who bought the tickets and we will never go again.  We purchased VIP tickets and was not at all impressed. First we had to wait in a line and had no idea where we were going, then after asking somebody we finally got directed to the \\"VIP Lounge\\" where there were high top tables and chairs, and appetizers. Now let me tell you these appetizers were literally cheese cubes and olives and they looked like they've been sitting out for more than 12 hours. Nobody else was in the \\"VIP Lounge\\" as the pirates were calling other guests into the actual seating area. So after standing around confused and employees passing us not offering to help, I went and asked the bartender where we should go because we were so confused. She then took us to a waitress who saw our ticket and was about to just seat us in some random area, and I said but we purchased VIP tickets, why aren't we in the front row? So then they realized we were on the wrong side of the seating area so we went to the other side and sat in the red section, front row...wasn't really sure what the colors meant. \\n\\nWhen we sat down after waiting for a little while, our waitress came around and said \\"Hello. Beer?\\" ....okay? so you're not going to ask for my ID (kids are everywhere) and the only option for drinks you have are beer? I  mean... the universal answer is Yes when somebody offers you a pitcher full of beer. It was Miller Lite I'm sure because it tasted like pee. I asked if there was a drink menu or any other drink offerings like I don't know, maybe WATER? And she said, only Pepsi or Sprite and any other drinks you need to get at the bar. Ok...cool. So after the show started, it made us even MORE confused. I had no idea what the story line was, the acting was so atrocious, and our Pirate told us if we don't scream loud enough to cheer him on he's going to kill us and our families.... probably being sarcastic there but c'mon you don't just tell people that at a restaurant. The acting was TERRIBLE, the dancer girl looked like she was sleeping with every pirate on that boat and they were literally dancing around, swinging on ropes like Tarzan, and play fighting. Our waitress had no idea what we ordered, and the food was absolutely terrible. Straight up cafeteria food made to feed the masses. Literally, they brought the food out on cafeteria carts. No joke. We left half way through the show because we couldn't take it anymore.

I mean you need to budget in terms of how many other calories you plan to consume the day you go there, because if you eat normally on top of having a Flat Patties cheeseburger you'll practically be able to hear your ventricles slamming shut.  You have to eat strategically at this place if you don't want to unintentionally dock three years off of your life.  \\n\\nThat said, the burgers here are SO good - they practically melt in your mouth, and the buns are wonderfully fluffy and delicious too.  Additionally, they put this mayo-relish-ketchup-y concoction on the burgers that gives them a very distinctive, unique taste.  \\n\\nHowever, Flat Patties' major drawback is the sides.  The fries are nothing to write home about (they tend to be thin and limp), and the onion rings are solid only if you order a large - no joke, if you order a small you can expect to get maybe six or seven rings on your plate.

I had a bacon cheeseburger roll... Meat in the middle of rice, like sushi - which actually had very little burger (but cost the same as the big burgers) but looked pretty.

Skimpy trimmings on top, I had to chase every teeny piece of diced pickle to get one for each sushi piece. It was, however, very heavy on the rice, like 5x the amount of meat. Plus, no sides came with it, and the waitress had an attitude.  The wait staff dumped our check on the table while we were still eating the main meal, didn't ask if we wanted dessert, didn't say \\"take your time\\", etc. Even my child noticed and said: \\"That was rude!

We had rushed to get in before Chef Gita Kantrow packs up her kitchen to allow for the next chef-in-residence to move in. The buzz did not disappoint! We started with aloo paratha, which was soft and warm. The flavors were amazing and the chutney added some heat if that's your thing. Sadly, they were out of the Momo, which I hear is out of this word. \\n\\nFor the second course, we went with Singara and the Spicy Pork Aloo Masala Achar. The Singara was my favorite of the evening. Crisp phyllo filled with spiced beef and a swipe of eggplant chutney. I will dream about this dish! The pork masala achar was an amazing blend of taste, texture and temperature. And getting the extra crispy edge pieces of the pork....heavenly!!\\n\\nOur main courses consisted of Butter Chicken and Braised Beef Short Ribs. While both dishes were tasty and were easily still a 7+ out of 10, the first and second courses trumped them. The short ribs were fork tender and came atop creamy polenta with crispy Brussel sprouts and roasted grape tomatoes. Very delicious. \\n\\nOverall, we left Wink and Nod happy and full and look forward to their next rotating chef.

It was quite a show and they were both very tasty.  The bar atmosphere was lovely and my daughter and I agreed that we would take an Uber here from her place (Virginia Highlands) just for the drinks and an appetizer.  When the rest of our party arrived, we were trying to get pics before we sat down and the host/hostess volunteered to take one. And indeed took several until we were satisfied.  We were seated in the heated tented area on the side of the building and it was just like being in someone's home.  Jason was our waiter and he was awesome.  He knew his stuff (how does he remember all those orders??) and we enjoyed his great personality and his personal stories were very entertaining.  Everyone was very accommodating and very kind.  We did not feel rushed and the food was delicious.  Between the 6-1/2 of us, we ordered the toasted deviled ham tea sandwiches (do not leave here without getting these) pork fritters (see tea sandwich note) crab dip, squash soup, Hanger steak, meatloaf, vegetable pot pie, fried chicken, fried Brussel sprouts, collard greens, grits, mac and cheese, sweet potato souffl√©, lemon ice box pie, chocolate tart, and cinnamon roll bread pudding.

That's just it though. Dirty Franks has access to no more ingredients than your average restaurant. The difference is: instead of putting those ingredients on a burger, spaghetti, fish, or whatever...., they simply slap them on a store bought hotdog and bun and charge $5 for it. Now please don't get me wrong, the food was pretty good, and it was great to eat at such an iconic place. \\n\\nAll in all, if your looking to just experience the icon that is Dirty Franks, obviously I'd recommend it.

I went again on Sunday, got there early & this time I got the asparagus & sugarsnap pea scramble, along with strawberry rhubarb turnovers.  The scramble was good, but not great imho.

It's a great place to go grab a burger and a beer and sit at the bar, or even bring a bigger group (VERY kid-friendly) and share entrees.   Their house-made veggie burger is phenomenal, as is their wide array of regular burgers.   Both come with your choice of sweet potato fries or steak fries and a small salad.   The fried pickles and buffalo tofu are also amazing and the nachos are served right out of the oven, perfectly stacked and evenly distributed with toppings.   The best part is:  I'm always pleasantly sated, often times with some leftovers to take home, and I never get that food-coma grease hangover that is common when ordering bar food.   \\n\\nThe beer selection is fantastic, and always changing.   The only small part of constructive feedback that I have is that sometimes I feel like the rotating beer list changes TOO frequently.   I'll get attached to a new belgian triple and try to order it two weeks later and it's gone.   That being said, the staff are wonderful and knowledgable and can always recommend a perfectly lovely alternative.   The range and variety of the beer list is impressive.

My dining companions and I selected the Wild Horse to celebrate a dual family birthday because of the positive reviews we heard about the excellent food and drink. Those reviews were spot on because the food was delicious and the drinks were also tasty. It was the customer service and the attitude of the management that was a complete turn off. \\n\\nOne of my dining companions ordered \\"the quesadilla\\", she did not specify the kind of quesadilla because from reading the menu she thought it came with chicken AND vegetables. To her chagrin, it was merely chicken and cheese when it arrived. She discreetly asked the waiter why there were no vegetables and he told her it was a choice of chicken and cheese OR sauteed vegetables. Too bad the word \\"or\\" was in 8 point font on the menu and clearly difficult to read for anyone over the age of 18. Rather than just saying apologizing for the confusion, the waiter came back to say my companion would have to pay for the additional quesadilla according to the manager.

If that's not your bag, don't worry, you can get down and dirty too. Plenty of vegetarian options are on the menu, but be warned, they're pretty much the same things, only on different carb vehicles.\\n\\nWe ordered the cornbread (a requirement, honestly) and the pimento cheese dip to start. Both are tremendous, but hello, expect to be full after this if you're a dining duo. The pimento cheese dip thankfully includes some veggies, which is some welcome freshness to an otherwise heavy menu.\\n\\nFor our mains, we got the Foothills flatbread (vegetarian) and the mushroom tacos (also vegetarian). Event though the ingredients for the two dishes on the menu are subtly different, we were in fact served the same stuff on different carbs. Kind of a let-down, really. Unfortunately, the veggie offerings are slim, so it would be nice if they could differentiate these two dishes more. If you are torn between the two, I recommend going flatbread.\\n\\nI hadn't been to HOB in maybe 20+ years, purely circumstantial, and I have to say, their service was very good and attentive. They are a worthy spot in Disney Springs, particularly if you are seeing a show at the HOB venue. Be warned that your \\"pass the line\\" efforts require $25/person spending NOT COUNTING ALCOHOL, which can be difficult. If it's evening and/or cooler in Florida, don't be afraid to walk some leftovers to your car before the show."},{"name":"Tasty Burger","address":"1301 Boylston St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"I went there yesterday after watching it on phantom gourmet i had a double cheese burger and a Conney island hot dog i really need to say it was sucks the burger was dry and salty and the hot dog that was a disappointment i really like hot dogs and this was crappy the milkshake was the only thing I enjoy cause the rest of the food sucks the burgers at Kelly's are allot better and i could make better hot dogs at home this place really blow and i don't think i would be back."},{"name":"Saffron","address":"3616 Far W Blvd, Ste 113","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"I came here for lunch.

Now that I've given it a few tries, though, I have to say I'm disappointed. Maybe the next trendy thing to open in that location will actually hit the mark.\\n\\nGiven the street food vibe of the place, the first thing that really bugs me is the super long wait for your food. I've been a few times now and each time have waited upwards of 15 minutes for my takeout order. Most recently, I went in while there was no one in line and only two people waiting for food, and ordered the Kobao (beef short rib bun) and the Chicken bao. Neither of these items are pack-page-of-the-menu type things (the Kobao was advertised on the chalk sandwich board and I was told the chicken is their most popular item), and yet the long wait made me feel like I'd ordered a lobster at Dennys. I've been at different times (lunch, dinner, and mid-afternoon) and each time has been like this.\\n\\nThe second thing that bugs me is the confused and unprofessional attitude behind the counter. The front of house staff just seem a bit ... untrained? I realize it's a new place but some things that you'd imagine to be common sense just get missed. For example, I went in once, and the person behind the counter was chatting to a customer who had finished ordering and they were just there shooting the breeze. I assume they were friends, as they seemed to know each other well. Anyway, I stood there for roughly 3 minutes (I started looking at my phone, so I know), and then walked out. And no, I wasn't hiding in some corner - I was standing right behind the customer at the register. More recently I ordered a couple items for takeout. The server clarified with me 3 times that it was a takeout order (each time asking me as though she hadn't yet asked). You can probably see where this is going, but of course when the order came out (15 minutes later), it was all plated up on a tray and had to be repackaged and transferred to a bag when I pointed out the error.\\n\\nThe food itself is okay. For a place that seems to market itself as being super intense and all about hard-core street-food flavours, I found just about everything I've had there pretty bland. Perhaps not dousing it in Sriracha at the little stand in the corner is my mistake? In any case, the best item I've tried is probably the chicken bao, but frankly both times I've had it the chicken has been very different - once it was very crispy and hot and then, most recently, soggy and room-temperature.\\n\\nI want to say I'd give it another shot in a pinch, but I can't imagine a pinch where I'd be willing to stand around for 15 minutes. I'd rather just brave the line at Tacofino."},{"name":"Tasty Burger","address":"1301 Boylston St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"Twice now, several days apart, I have placed orders via Caviar for Tasty Burger Fenway in Boston.
