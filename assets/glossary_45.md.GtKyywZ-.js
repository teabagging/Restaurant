I got the shrimp plate, with chilled quinoa and grilled vegetables but when it arrived I saw that they added white rice which is fine. The quinoa was really good and everything tasted good together. I'm giving 3 stars because I think they could have given more shrimp. The protein is the highlight (the reason why I ordered) the dish. The brigadeiro was small, but soooo rich, if you are a chocolate lover you should try it. We also got yuca fries because you need to spend $35 with Amazon restaurants to get free delivery.

From the dark, friendly recesses of Biddy Early's in the financial district to the glitz and hair-gel filled excesses of Estate to the roar of the crowd at Jerry Remy's at Fenway, I've boozehounded around Boston quite a bit. So I say the following with some authority-and painful honesty.\\n\\nTia's had the worst, most overpriced drinks around.\\n\\nSince I've experienced this place as both a restaurant and a bar, I will be reviewing the food, the drinks, the service, the prices, and the atmosphere.\\n\\nFood: 4/5\\nThe food is actually pretty decent, especially the appetizers. Chicken tenders had a great sweet glaze and were perfectly moist, the beef skewers kicked serious ass, the crabmeat-filled rangoons had ACTUAL CRAB in them, and the sliders, while not spectacular, were solidly executed and cooked to a perfect medium. The potato salad, however, could have used a bit more punch to it-maybe siracha in the mayo or some cumin?\\n\\nDrinks: 2/5\\nNo way to sugarcoat this-this was BAD. My mojito had very little rum, a metric ton of mint syrup, and then a few pieces of mint-unmuddled, just floating in the damn thing. And it was frakking TINY. My whiskey sour tasted more just like sour mix with some afterthoughts of whiskey in it, and my rum and coke had-I can't believe I am saying this-too much rum. How the HELL do you mess up a rum and coke. No, seriously, HOW?\\n\\nService: 3.5/5\\nDecent-to-good service throughout. Bartenders did not know how to make drinks (see above), but were friendly and prompt. Waitresses were all very sweet and helpful, and came often to clear stuff away.\\n\\nPrices: 2/5\\nAnnnnd it's ugly again.  $12.50 for a mojito. $7 for a MILLER LITE. What the hell am I drinking out of, gold? Nope-just plastic cups and bottles. The food is fairly priced, but as a bar, it has NOTHING going for it besides the location and the crowd.\\n\\nAtmosphere: 4/5\\nA little redemption here-great location on the waterfront, near Fanueil and the North End, and the open air is perfect for loud conversations and hell-raising. A fairly popular gathering point for young professionals with expendable cash and an eye for a locale.\\n\\nOverall, Tia's is a up-and-down experience. Good food and location, but the drinks are horrible and more overpriced than Apple products. For a good meal, come here, but then head to any of several dozen bars further in for the actual night out so you don't get completely gashed.\\n\\nCheers,\\n\\nJin"},{"name":"Times Irish Pub & Restaurant","address":"112 Broad St","city":"Boston","stars":"3","text":"I'm not going to say much.

Purists and pundits say that Fat Matt's can't be \\"authentic\\" because they boil their ribs and mask the taste of the meat by caking on the sauce.  Whatever.  I'm all about that [sauce] anyways. \\n\\nI judge food by how it tastes on its own merit, and although it's helpful to compare Fat Matt's to other BBQ joints, using that standard alone will stop you from appreciating how creative BBQ can be.  Fat Matt's has its own brand of BBQ, and it's finger-licking good.  Whenever I go, I get the ribs.  Hands-down, this is the best option on the menu.  The meat is tender enough to fall off the bone easily, but it also retains enough texture to make chewing a delight.  And that sauce though.  It's tangy. It's sweet.  It's made from the tears of unicorns.  \\n\\nThat's not to say that other items off the menu aren't good.  I've had the chicken and it has a delicious smokey taste to it.  Get the half-bird - it's worth it.  It might seem like a lot at first, but you'll be wondering where all of it went before the live-band finishes its first song.  The pulled pork is just your standard pulled pork, and that's a-ok with me.  It could use a little work in the texture department.  And as far as sides go, get the rum baked beans.  I like to drown the slices of white bread they give me all up and around that goodness.  You'll be so engrossed in that rum sauce, you'll need a DD to drive you home after your food coma.  \\n\\nThe setting itself is a little tight, but that just helps create a more intimate environment, especially at night when the live band is busting out those bluesy tunes.

I remembered that my friend Pat had said something along the lines of,\\n\\n\\"Dude. You gotta eat Ramen Tatsu-Ya at some point. I know you like microwave ramen, but this stuff will make you cry and believe that you are dead and in heaven,\\"\\n\\nand so I suggested to my cute lady friend that we go there. Since we are both obsessed with Japanese culture and tasty noodles, we hopped into her tiny Toyota and were whisked northward towards Research. We were nervous that we wouldn't find it, and after pulling into a parking lot and not seeing it, we began to panic. Suddenly we saw the beautiful tapestry flapping in the breeze with that wonderful name: Ramen Tatsu-Ya. Relief washed over me in an awesome wave.\\n\\nWe walked in and to our delight the line was quite short. We had beat the usual Tatsu-ya rush and had just enough time to read about Ramen etiquette and look over the menu. We decided to share a small gyoza appetizer and get a bowl of original ramen each, with no additional toppings. This night was for purity. This night was for the real thing. \\n\\nWe drank water from delightful little glasses, but we could have ordered a number of tasty drinks, from bottled tea to Japanese soda (ucarbonated- how grand) which I think was called Calpico. There was also Japanese candy: I had to resist the urge to buy every box of Pocky. \\n\\nSeating at Tatsu-Ya is a little different from most restaurants, but still enjoyable and exciting. Most people/couples/groups will not have a table to themselves. Most likely you will share a long table with numerous other people. \\n\\nWe took our seats and soon we received our little gyoza plate. The five dumplings that sat before us were not exceptional in size, but made up for that with powerful, god-like taste. We clapped our hands together and said, \\"Itadakimasu!\\" and lifted up one dumpling each. I dipped it in the small cup of soy sauce and closed my eyes, preparing myself for the first bite. As soon as that dumpling entered my mouth, I was whisked away to another land, probably heaven, where everything was perfect and beautiful. I shed a single tear. \\n\\nBut this was only the beginning. These simple, incredible dumplings, no matter how tasty, were nothing next to the heavenly bowls that would soon sit before us. \\n\\nAfter finishing the gyoza plate, it was only a short wait before the real gods of this sacred shrine of a restaurant arrived. My eyes watered once again as I gazed on the little bowl in front of me; it was truly divine. I looked up to see my female counterpart in a similar state. We telepathically decided that it was time to begin this sacred experience. \\n\\nFirst I decided to sample the broth. The tonkotsu broth, made from pork bones, was incredibly tasty and hot, and warmed me like the sun on a clear summer's day. Next it was on to the noodles- perfectly soft and delicious. The chashu was tender and savory, and the mushrooms and scallions added a lot of flavor to create a perfect assault of delicious scents and tastes. The ajitama soft boiled egg was a delicacy all its own. \\n\\nAfter the noodles and other foods had been slowly and perfectly eaten, I finished off the broth with a long draught from the bowl. I was perfectly full, and intensely satisfied. \\n\\nEach bowl at Ramen Tatsu-Ya is a god to be worshipped. Do not disrespect the tonkotsu. \\n\\ntl;dr:\\nThe ramen is delicious. The environment is comfortable and exciting. The service is genuine and polite. The price is extremely agreeable."},{"name":"Sonsie","address":"327 Newbury St","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"French style location.

I am a huge sriracha fan, but can appreciate this sauce may be too spicy or overpowering to some.  But the place does a great job to make sure that does not happen so you get the heat but taste the rest of the dish.  The Chicago dog was very nice.  It is exactly what you would expect. I probably would not have ordered this dog had I been able to spot the middle of the menu better and seen the excellent choices available there.  \\n\\nWith the meal, I had the tater tots and the reviews do not lie.

It was not worth the 40 minute wait for take out.\\n\\nWhat I Liked: \\n\\n* The jalape√±o cornbread was quite nice. It was a tad bit spicy, golden and moist. Thank goodness. Eating dry cornbread is almost as bad as ingesting sawdust. The honey butter was a great addition. \\n* The BBQ sauce was delicious. It was a tad bit vinegary, which isn't my favorite. But it has quite a few layers of flavor. \\n* The service was excellent. The woman who took my to-go order was friendly and attentive. She also answered my questions with great recommendations. \\n\\nWhat I Didn't Like:\\n\\n* The pulled pork itself was way too salty. While I enjoyed some of the char that was on it, the sodium content just overdid it for me. \\n* The mac and cheese was pretty awful. It actually lacked salt. Or flavor for that matter. I also believe that the roux they used to make it was not thoroughly cooked. I could feel the grittiness of the flour. And the pasta was way over done. It was kinda like mashed mac and cheese.

I will never be able to enjoy BBQ anywhere else because it will pail in comparison to Franklin's. I say this with some BBQ acumen behind my opinion. I travel a lot for work and have eaten in all the BBQ mecca's (KC, TX, Carolina, Memphis) in addition to a plethora of other great BBQ around the country. Nothing I have ever eaten has been as moist, tender, or straight up damn good as this BBQ. And FYI, I went to the famous Salt Lick BBQ the next day and it wasn't even in the same ball park (and Salt Lick is good, don't get me wrong)!!! \\n\\nIf you go, be prepared to get there early and go with some friends. I got there at 9:15 (for the 11 am opening) and there were already about 30-40 people ahead of me. By the time my buddy showed up at 10:15 (he couldn't rally as quickly after a long night of drinking on 6th St), the line was at least 100 deep. By the time the place opened at 11 am, the line was at least 250 deep. But you know what, the time goes by fast. Most people in line are from out of town with a friendly attitude creating a great atmosphere of excitement and anticipation. Plus a girl walks around selling beer!! Get the day started on the right foot!\\n\\nNow to the important stuff, the QUE! Line started moving at 11 am and got to the front by about 11:30. If you aren't a regular, definitely order a little bit of everything, but make sure, seriously make sure to GET THE BRISKET!!!!! We ordered the brisket, pulled pork, ribs, and sausage. Everything was outstanding -- the ribs were tender and pulled clean off the bone. The sausage had excellent flavor and a nice snap to the casing. Pulled pork was slightly smoky and juicy. The sides are good too (we got potato salad, coleslaw, and beans), but totally take a back seat to the meat.\\n\\nBut everything palled in comparison to the brisket. OH the gloriousness!!!! Words cannot do justice at all. When the guy was carving it, the brisket was quivering like jello it was so moist and tender. It literally melted in your mouth. It was absolutely cooked perfectly with a nice smokiness and unreal bark. And he cuts you a free sample when you tell him you are out of town. Unequivocally the best of all time!!! Best part is how simple it is, all he uses is salt and pepper, the difference is that the cooking technique has been mastered and perfected. I mean they cook for 22 hours a day and are open for 2 hours a day. Talk about a labor of love!!!\\n\\nOn top of the food, the service is excellent with one of the pit masters and Mr Franklin himself coming around to each table and asking how everyone is doing and how the food is. \\n\\nYes the line is long, but honestly, it goes by quick and if you come to Austin to visit, it is 100% worth the 3 hours of your life that you will have to give up to enjoy the BEST DAMN BBQ EVER. PERIOD. Get your ass to Austin. You will not be disappointed. Oh and make sure to wash everything down with a delicious Shiner Bock. Cheers!"},{"name":"Franklin Barbecue","address":"900 E 11th St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"Everything here is really good but it's the brisket that takes it to a whole new level.

I had an appetizer special of blackened scallops on fried polenta with some pesto, the scallops were slightly undercooked but not too bad. I also had a special main course, trout stuffed with puttanesca sauce, the sauce was excellent, the trout could have been fresher but again, not bad. The soup of the day was lentil and it was the best I've had outside of grandma's kitchen, it almost made me bump to 4 stars. The linguini side with red sauce was good, but nothing special. The cannoli was adequate, the filling was better than the shell. I tried a piece of the GF's steak and it was excellent.

Overpriced and you'd have to eat a metric ton of food to equate the onerous entry fee...$30+...just think, with 30 bucks you can feed yourself much better quality stuff that's truer to the source material, *and* be totally stuffed(which would be bad for you anyways.

I didn't expect a restaurant this small, but no problem, since I care more about the food than superficial decor.  The wait for a table was long since all 7 to 8 tables were full.  But there was no wait for sitting at the sushi counter which is perfect since I can watch the chef do his magic.  \\n\\nI started with the sashimi platter to get a variety of fish.  The portion size was very generous - in fact, each piece of fish is equal to 2 at other places.  I've never had a piece of sashimi that I couldn't fit into my mouth in 1 piece.   There were salmon, tuna, white tuna, hamachi, and octopus.  It wasn't like the plate shown on the pic here posted by another Yelper, so I guess the chef varies the content.  I loved every one of the fish - fresh, cold, tasty, and big.   The only one I wasn't crazy about was the octopus... it was not tasty and cut thinly... I had better ones elsewhere, and will probably ask for a substitute next time.  For $26, this is a good deal.   I also got a bowl of miso soup, and a bowl of rice with it.... something most other restaurants don't provide.\\n\\nI ordered another salmon sashimi and the size of each piece (3 in an order) was even more huge than the ones in the sashimi platter.  The only thing is there is no price on the menu for sashimi (and it's higher than the nigiri price).  I didn't order nigiri sushi but I watched the chef make them as I sat at the counter.   He cuts long pieces of fish to put on top of the rice.... I mean LONG.  Not little pieces like other places. \\n\\nI was looking thru the menu for a maki sushi to order but couldn't find any that I liked... I wanted something with the main filling being salmon.  Oh well, I guess I'll stick with sashimi here.\\n\\nThis is the only sushi restaurant that actually gives you your money's worth.

I tried a combination of white chocolate macadamia nut cookie + pistachio almond ice cream and yumm.

The food here during brunch is so inventive and original- not many places serve the same type of dishes as they do here.

We ordered the following:\\n\\nFarmer's Scramble ($8.95 + 1.00 + 0.75) - My buddy ordered this scramble with only egg whites and a biscuit. He enjoyed this and would order it again.  It looked really healthy and I wouldn't mind having this dish right now myself. \\n\\nOyster Benedict ($11.95) - I'm a sucker for benedicts.  I ordered this with the cheese grits.  SO GOOD.  The eggs were perfectly poached!  I usually get one of the benedicts here, and they never disappoint. \\n\\nSides ($2.95, 2.95, 1.95) - My other friend doesn't eat wheat, so she ordered sides of cheese grits, grilled ham and a cup of yoghurt.  She was really happy about the ability to build your own breakfast.  \\n\\nPraline Bacon ($3.95) - How can you come to The Screen Door and not order a side of the praline bacon?!  We shared this dish, and my favourite thing to do is eat the praline bacon along with the grits and my benedict (a little of each in every bite).  YUM.  \\n\\nAlong with two grapefruit mimosas and a small orange juice, the total for the three of us came to $45.95 + 10.00 tip = $55.95.\\n\\nOur server, Klyde, was really nice and he seemed to enjoy his job!

The buffalo wings were so juicy. The buffalo sauce was spicy enough and the chicken was cooked perfectly. I ordered the chicken and waffles because my waiter made it sound so tasty and filling--he was right! It came with two large waffles and 3 pieces of chicken (beast, leg and wing). I had to request about 3 more containers of syrup because the one that comes with the meal is incredibly tiny for the size of the waffles.

One thing that is unique about this Waffle House is the lack of smoke (but that's just about any establishment following the law in this town).\\n\\nWe went in one late evening when all our other usual places were taken up by the ACL crowds.  This Waffle House was fairly packed at around midnight and so we waited our turn for a seat, which took a while with only one couple in front of us.  What was slightly annoying was that there were several unbussed tables just sitting there.  When someone in a different party started bussing one of the tables, a waitress got angry they were messing up their section or something.  So we decided to wait it out until something was ready.\\n\\nThe first thing we ordered as our waitress handed us our menus was our drinks and she asked if we knew what we wanted... but since we hadn't been in a Waffle House in a while, we didn't know before she handed us the menus.  We both ordered some All Star breakfasts- definitely great prices on them.\\n\\nSo we wait and wait and wait.  She eventually brings us our meats that go with our platters.  Meanwhile, people that were behind us when we first got there were already leaving.  After about 10 minutes she brings us the rest of our meal and runs back over to behind the counter.  Guess what?  Still no drinks.\\n\\nSo we get our drinks finally and about 20 minutes after, we finally got our check so we could leave.  I could understand all the confusion if there was actually a crowd in there- but by the time we were served anything, most of the crowd had headed out, so that couldn't really have held anything up....especially the delayed drink order.\\n\\nAfter all that, we'll probably be back... we'll just sit in a section with a different waitress alongside the kitchen instead of a side booth so we can flag her down if we need to do so.  I mean, it's Waffle House.  You kind of got to expect that kind of service and hope for something better, you know?"},{"name":"Pirates Dinner Adventure","address":"6400 Carrier Dr","city":"Orlando","stars":"3.5","text":"Worth it only if you get a discounted ticket!!!  Use code: ALS15 during Feb. 2015 to get a $35 Adult ticket and $5 will be donated to the ALS Association Florida Chapter. There was also a $3 handling fee so after tax, one adult ticket was $40.47. Gratuity for the servers is not included in the ticket price- $5 per adult, $3 per child.\\n\\nKeep in mind, you are paying for the show not the food. The food is totally decent but not if you only consider the ticket price as paying for the food... which is why I say think about it as paying for the show. The cast are professional actors, stuntmen, singers and acrobats (you would pay more to see a Cirque show or a play at Bob Carr and there is no food there).\\n\\nHere is the rundown of the Pirate experience.\\n\\n\\nLogistics\\nParking is $5 and is right next to the building. They give you a $5 coupon for the gift shop you can use if you spend $10 or more. \\n\\nArrive at least 45 minutes before showtime. There was a pretty decent line to check-in which wasn't the fastest moving. There is also a little pre-show (which we missed part of) while you are waiting inside for the show to start. \\n\\nBring a jacket if you tend to get cold. The show area was chilly (I was okay with a sweater and no jacket but my friend was freezing with her jacket on).\\n\\n\\nBefore The Show\\nThey will ask to take your photo. You don't have to. I don't know how much it costs to buy but I heard someone say something about $30 (yikes!). You can have a cocktail, get a souvenir at the gift shop area and watch the pre-show. We missed part of it but we did see a little bit of acrobatics and introduction to some of the characters.\\n\\n\\nFood\\nAppetizer: You get a choice of a tomato soup or salad (basic mix like at Olive Garden) w/ Ranch or Italian dressing\\n\\nEntr√©e: Beef Kabob or Roasted Chicken- both come with rice and vegetables. I  had the beef which had good flavor and was tender (could've used some kind of sauce though) and my friend had the chicken (which was half a chicken like Boston Market) she said was good\\n\\nDessert: A brownie (more like cake) with a scoop of vanilla ice cream and chocolate sauce\\n\\nBeverage Choices: Water, Pepsi or Beer...   There is a cash bar when you walk in before you get into the show area if want an alternate cocktail (not sure if they have non-alcoholic options out there)\\n\\n\\nThe Show\\nAudience participation is a must! Much like Medieval Times, you are seated in a colored section which represents your pirate and you cheer for your pirate throughout the show (and heckle the other pirates).\\n\\nThe show really has it all... cheesy plot line (save the princess, fall in love with the princess, capture the bad guy), sword fighting, aerial acrobatics, trampoline stunts, stage fighting, rope swinging (they are pirates after all), singing, audience participation, humor and a giant dragon!!\\n\\nAt one point there is a pirate competition and they take audience members to help them compete (running flags, throwing treasure, hoisting sails on the ship). All of the kids are brought onto the stage to become honorary pirates in a pirate ceremony.\\n\\n\\nAfter The Show\\nThey had a dance party. Yes, you read that right!! The pirates were in the pre-show area dancing to the Cha-Cha Slide, Cupid Shuffle and some other stuff. Disco ball and colored lights, too! I took this opportunity to seek out our pirate (Cutthroat Jack, the Red Pirate) and take my photo with him.

Bar-B-Q","address":"1238 Dekalb Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4.5","text":"I had been thinking of BBQ all day on a recent trip to Atlanta and discovered Fox Bros based on good reviews online.  Let me start off by saying that the pulled pork I ordered was EXCELLENT!  Delicious, tender, smokey, moist and they give you a huge chunk of meat.  The side dishes and the service I received is what dropped this rating from a 5 to a 3.  Someone had commented that the macaroni and cheese \\"was to die for\\".  Naturally, I had to get that and was sorely disappointed.  Whoever thinks Fox Bros mac n cheese is to die for has never had good mac n cheese.  The cheese sauce appeared to have been made from whole wheat flour (it was gritty, not smooth) and there was very little cheese in the sauce, leaving a lot to be desired in this dish.  I also got the cole slaw, which was OK but nothing to write home about.   I expected the pulled pork to be a sandwich, but I never found the ONE piece of what appeared to be Wonder bread (yuck) under the meat smashed and now soggy until I finished eating the pork.  OK, no problem but...\\nThe nasty fake attitude I got from the woman who took to-go orders is what really blew it for me.  Because the place was very crowded (nothing unusual from what I've heard) I placed an order to go and was told by a woman with a fake ear-to-ear smile it would be 7-8 minutes and I would be called either at the bar or outside.  I informed her that I would be waiting outside. I waited on the bench outside the door.   At about 10 minutes later, and well after the couple ahead of me in line received their food she came outside with a confused look on her face,  looked right through me and went back inside without saying a word.  At 15 minutes or so I went inside to see what was up and she flat out told me that she'd called me 3 times, which was absolutely false.  She dropped the food container on the counter and walked away without an I'm sorry or thank you or anything but the fake smile on her face as I reminded her that she never called my name."},{"name":"Leo's Place Diner","address":"655 Main St","city":"Waltham","stars":"4","text":"My wife and I came here for breakfast.

Some Georgia Tech grads introduced me to the place, and they were horrified that I lived nearby and didn't know about it.\\n\\nThe Cubans at Kool Korners are so popular that the staff has a note up when you walk in the door that you only need to place an order if you're getting something other than the Cuban. If you want a Cuban (like everyone else), just get in line and tell them know how many. I don't think I've ever ordered anything else off the menu come to think of it.\\n\\nBe prepared to wait through the line if you go at lunch. They sell chips and drinks as well as sandwiches, but that's it. There's no seating (aside from the one picnic bench that will invariably be full if it's not raining) so you'll need to have somewhere in mind for a spot to eat your sandwich. Piedmont Park isn't too far away if you've got the time and the weather is nice. Sometimes I'll go by Kool Korners and grab a few Cubans and bring them down to Centennial Park for lunch with my wife and friends.

The Korean tacos were delicious but make sure you eat everything in the filling together to get the best experience (kimchi, short rib and pears). We also ended up getting the burger which changes every month. Our burger was the Italian burger served with tomato, basil, and mozzarella.

My wife and I attended their grand opening last night and can attest to the fact that the restaurant lives and breathes the same quality that's been present in their truck food all along! \\n\\nEven though it was slammed (it WAS their grand opening after all), the wait for a table was only about 30 mins, so we grabbed some drinks from the bar while we waited. It was a bit difficult hailing down one of the bartenders but I'm chalking that up to some of the more inconsiderate folks that were taking up space at the middle of the bar to just rest their drinks after they'd already been served. Get your drink and move along, people! It also seemed like the iPad system they were using for credit card payment at the bar was slowing things down a bit since they had to hand it back and forth for people to digitally sign, tip, etc. Turns out their POS system was down so hopefully using the iPads at the bar was just temporary until they get that sorted out. Their beer selection was stellar so I just picked an old favorite from the list and my wife ordered a candy corn cocktail, which she loved. I paid cash to keep things moving for the bartenders and we took our drinks to the outdoor porch, which was nice and roomy.\\n\\nAfter we were seated, our server, Smoky, was right on point. We didn't have to wait long at all and she came by multiple times to check on us, even though it was crazy chaotic. I ordered the 1/2lb pork burger with bacon and cheese, my wife got the kielbasa, and we split an order of fries. Everything was awesome, but I'll probably forgo the bacon next time - it was great, just overkill on a pork burger, IMO. We had a slice of sweet potato cheesecake for dessert which was also delicious. Everything was extremely affordable too.\\n\\nIt was also great to see both of the owners making rounds, one of which we got to meet. He was very personable and genuine. Having the owners checking up gave things a more personal feel. Hopefully that'll be something that continues in the future!\\n\\nOverall, I'm really looking forward to coming back - everything was superb, both the food and the service, and we loved the old-timey atmosphere that the space exudes.

I had been eagerly anticipating eating at this funky and cool new restaurant in Avondale Estates. I decided to take my son who was visiting from out of town. As much as I wanted him to be impressed, neither of us were. The boiled peanuts were excellent, as others have reported.  My son said that the milkshake was pretty good, but far from the best he has had. The fries were fine for those who like the shoestring variety. My son's corndog was good, but again nothing spectacular. The biggest disappointment was the pastrami sandwich on pumpernickel bread. The pastrami, cured at the restaurant (according to our server) tasted like a bland version of barely seasoned, somewhat tender beef jerky. I have had plenty, and I mean plenty of pastrami sandwiches over the years. This version was nothing close to the real thing. Anyone who says different truly has no idea of what the lovely melt in your mouth texture and the lasting aftertaste of quality pastrami is really all about. The pumpernickel was alright, but the edges bordered on stale. Not sure why. I hate to be so underwhelmed about my first visit restaurant.

This dog is actually named for the kitchen manager over at Surly Girl Saloon, who is also a frequent patron of DF's. The fries are always great in my opinion, as are the various ways you can eat a tater tot. Other favorite dogs I have are: The Fire on the Rhine, the Seoul Dog, and the Classy Lady.\\n\\nI also like drinking here just because of the slushies. Did you know that a slush plus your choice of poison comes with a little plastic critter decorating the rim of your drink? But, they also do have a pretty good beer selection on tap if your tastes take you that way. \\n\\nRecently, they've started doing two things here that I love. First, Costume Karaoke Mondays with KJDirtyoke. While DF's is a bit small inside, having the entire place sing along to karaoke is one of the most fun things I've done this winter. It usually starts around 9-9:30pm every monday. Also, they've been doing themed city nights- specials that start at 10pm and are $5. It usually consists of a city themed dog, beer, and a city of fries. For example, the Pittsburgh nights [which are thursdays] consist of a Lara Dog, and Iron City beer, and fries for only $5!! While the specials are a little late, its still a great deal.\\n\\nAll in all, the only thing I could ask Dirty Frank's to change is to get a bigger location or a second location! This place is so much fun to go with friends, but accommodating larger groups is not their forte.

We know it gets busy and there were many of us and we were fairly patient. My friends steak had to be sent back twice because it was so red, we ended up taking the cake back we had planned to eat due to her lack of coming back to check in. Really annoying, since we had a tight deadline of 10PM since we had a show to see post dinner. \\n\\nNext, lunch during the day. We sat at the bar and where it was crowded during the day due to PRIDE, it wasn't overwhelming. We had to ask for drinks, as no one did as we sat there for almost fifteen minutes.

We ordered 1lb of brisket, 1/4 pull pork, 1/4 of ribs (ie 2 bones), 3 links of sausage (ie 1/2 lbs, was told its more economical to order this instead of 2links), pint of potato salad and coleslaw, banana bourbon pie. \\nBrisket: very good. We asked for the fatty ones and it's really juicy. And yes, you definitely don't need any sauce for Texas bbq. I also like it that their seasoning is not towards the sweet side. \\nPull pork: excellent. I don't usually like pork but they made this really nice to go with the bread, free flowing onion and pickles to make your own pull pork sandwich. \\nRib: too salty for me. Tender though not to the falling from the bone degree. The only thing I'd give 4 star. \\nSausage: very good. Happy that we ordered extra for take out. \\nPotato salad and coleslaw: decent ones.

The sweet lavender scone was text-book perfect, light and flaky, and good the next morning.  The salted caramel  bar cookie was amazing.  I ended up cutting it into six portions, it is so large.  It is Umami is a sweet and salty cookie form.  The macaroon is probably the best one I have ever eaten, a ball of sweet moist shredded coconut sitting on a crispy chocolate base.  The Oatmeal Toffee cookie was thick and moist and flavorful.

Both of us were tired and wanted some good, healthy food that wasn't Laughing Planet for a change. There was a line as the place had just opened so the staff told my husband he could sit at the bar and look at a menu. He sat down, ordered a beer, then was handed a menu. By that time he had already committed and it was getting too late to go elsewhere. \\n\\nBy the time he got the menu he was shocked. $14/$15 burritos and $13-$16 tacos. He went ahead and ordered, hoping, thinking these would be the best burritos and tacos ever. He ordered a carnitas, chicken and beef burritos and the Mahi Mahi tacos, as he was picking up food for his parents who were visiting. When we saw each other at home, needless to say I wasn't happy with his purchasing decision on principle, but understand that he was just trying to get dinner for our family on a weeknight when everyone is too tired to cook. But I was more shocked and disappointed in this new restaurant. I don't know of anywhere else in Portland with those prices for a freaking burrito and small plate of tacos. The quality was fine, no better than Laughing Planet (or any of the other Portland Mexican restaurants, i.e. Cha Cha Cha, Mi Mero Mole, Por Que No?, etc), in fact not better, and the prices were practically double. \\n\\nWe'll never be going back here unless they change their business model.

They basically laid out all the dishes on two round tables. \\n\\nThe AC could be cranked up higher. It was warm and stuffy inside on a hot day.

I tend to stick with pork based broth, but since I only had a limited variety of choices I chose a chicken based broth and man did I make a wrong decision! The broth wasn't flavorful because the salt masked everything. It was so overpowering that any little flavor that was in the bowl completely just disappeared, and the noodles were a bit undercooked because they were hard to eat.

The food was better than average - the carpaccio was yummy and the yam bam, but the ramen was mediocre (at best).

I had apologized for my delay. But the person who handed the food over to me started complaining about how the food was prepared and kept for long (20 minutes instead of 15). He said that they had 5 chefs so they got the food ready very soon. He kept going on and on. I was puzzled because I had told the guy over the phone as to how much time it would take for me to get there. It kind of gave me the impression that he was defending his food and if I felt the food didn't taste good, it was due to my delayed arrival. I think complaining about my delay and defending the food was quite unprofessional. If I was late I deserve what I get within the to-go boxes.

The crab and shrimp cakes were to die for and the servings were huge (3 cakes!) and Crab and Cheese stuffed Salmon was also without a flaw.\\n\\nMy only complaint was that the restaurant was busy so it was loud but that's what you get for going to one of the city's most beloved restaurants at 8pm on a Saturday.

The staff is very friendly and personable, the food is outstanding and it's just a great place to watch a game or simply hang out for a little while. Lots of beers are offered - they seem to have new canned beers I've never tried or even heard of every time I go there. They have a full liquor bar now, which I believe is relatively new. (I think it was implemented sometime in 2010.)\\n\\nThe prices for drinks are very low, so if you're running low on cash (which is the only payment method accepted here; there is an ATM inside, however) then this IS the place to go. I believe happy hour is on weekdays (or possibly every day?) from 7 a.m.-6 p.m. Yes, you saw that correctly - they open at 7 a.m., at least on weekdays. I haven't been there that early yet (though I'm definitely itching to try), but I've heard that a breakfast sandwich of some sort is offered. When I've been there during the afternoon or at night, I've only tried two different things on the menu - the Hideaway Special burger, which has A-1 and onions atop the burger, and the patty melt. The Special burger is so good that it'd been difficult for me to order anything else on subsequent visits. I went in a different direction on a visit late last month and had the patty melt, which was amazing. I don't eat red meat much, so I'm not what you'd call a burger connoisseur, but the Hideaway's burgers are the best I've had in Orlando. I haven't had a burger at Graffiti Junktion or a few of the other recommended burger places in town, and I'm not sure I ever will since I don't eat them much. Even if I did eat them a lot, the odds are I'd just go to the Hideaway for a Special. It's that good.\\n\\nAs one reviewer already pointed out, the parking situation is a little tricky since there's limited space out back, and the path to get back there is narrow and may even partially be lined with parked cars that there was no room for out back. You can park out on Virginia, though, and even parking on Orange isn't a big deal since the Hideaway is a short walk away.\\n\\nAs Chris B. pointed out, there's an \\"interesting crowd.\\" And as a few others stated, there's a lot of smoke in there.

Maybe it was an off day, but the BBQ pork was extremely dry, it had no sauce that I could taste, and there was literally almost no meat in it (I'm talking like 2 or 3 oz of meat, maybe less.  Basically no meat).  I always order double meat with bahn mi, as I'm a big guy, and eat larger portions than most people (6'5\\" 235lbs).  Even with the double, or extra meat, Baguette house's sandwhich was tiny in comparison to Lilly's.  Who knows, maybe Lilly's stepped up their game and I hit baguette house on a bad day, but Lilly's wins hands down in my book. Baguette House bread was good, but thats about it.  And Lilly's bread is as good or better.  Real warm, crispy baguette, half a french bread loaf.  \\n\\nNot to mention the prices are great.  I can get 3 egg rolls, a sandwich with extra meat, and a ice coffee for $11.  Thats enough for me to eat twice.  And if you come up short on money (as I sometimes do, as I never carry cash and they don't take debit cards) they'll let you pay them back! You can't ask for more than that really.  Lilly's gets a big fat A+++ in my book.  And its less than 5 minutes from my work.  I've been there 4 times in the last 2 weeks!

It doesn't get much better than this.\\nThis is a small-plate American tapas restaurant, with fresh ingredients farm-to-table, a menu that changes weekly, everyone shares the plates, and the selections are highly original. \\nSpouse and I are visiting our wonderful son and his even more wonderful spouse in Cambridge for the weekend. Apparently reservations at Alden & Harlow are tough to get, and they had the idea to eat here and made the reservations far enough in advance to score a 7 PM slot on a Saturday night. Well done!\\nThe restaurant is located in the heart of Harvard Square, at the location of the former Casablanca restaurant that apparently chugged along for 50 years! That's the only \\"issue\\" of dining here: parking in Harvard Square is a bit challenging.\\nThe atmosphere is lively, fun, lovely, elegant, with exposed brick walls. Whoever designed the space gets 5 stars. Noise level is a bit high, I could not hear my wife talking unless I leaned forward so I could get her words straight at me, and I had to lean forward to hear my son/daughter in law across the table. But this is the trend these days, apparently raising your voice in your dining party is what makes it fun, and it even makes it intimate because you definitely can't hear the conversations from the other tables.\\nWe are non-meat eaters, and there were enough selections that we could choose. And choose we did! The #1 winner was a charred broccoli over butternut squash hummus with a spicy pepper-infused honey sauce, and a topping of chopped cashews and bianco sardo cheese. The char of the broccoli, the freshness of the hummus, and the kick and sweetness of the sauce made it incredibly delicious and original. Who would have thunk this? I could have eaten that all evening. The #2 winner was mackerel, grilled, served with celery root cole slaw, remoulade, and pickled green tomatoes. Ridiculously good.\\nThe #3 winner was a house-made trenne paste served with grilled bolero carrots, and covered with a pistachio /parsley pesto. Again, amazing.\\nWe also had kale salad, corn pancakes, and a hunk of pave d'affinois cheese that had been torched and covered with braised garlic and figs, served with rosemary black pepper biscotti. Oh, and an yellowfin tuna crudo. \\nWe ordered one dessert to share, the smoked chocolate with salted ice cream. I did not taste it, the others raved about it. We saw other tables ordering this, so it is apparently well loved.\\nService was excellent. We had a super friendly server who totally knew her stuff, could answer any question about any ingredient or beverage choice, and definitely added to our enjoyment of the evening. She worked with us and the kitchen to adapt a couple of the dishes and accommodate our non-meat preference.\\nServer advised to order 8-10 plates for four people. We ordered 8 plus one dessert to share and it was plenty of food, we probably could have ordered 6 and been satisfied. Server brought out a tiny plate of pickled green beans to start, these were pickled beyond the point of tanginess, I would call it aggressive. Tasty to the max, though not for everyone's taste.\\nCocktail choices were manifold, the only problem is that the ingredients were totally obscure so I had no clue what anything was. Two of us got cocktails which were good but not amazing. One of us was pregnant and got a mocktail which she enjoyed. The on tap beer selections were not great in my view and there were only 5 of them, plus about 20 bottled choices. On the wine side there were only 5 by-the-glass choices and then a good number of bottled choices, maybe 20-30 which is plenty. I chose a cabernet franc from the Loire Valley, it was outstanding.\\nThey have a bar area that looks fun and attractive. This evening happened to be the NCAA Final Four so I could silently watch and get the game scores. This would be one of those bars where you shout to be heard, but some people love that!\\nTotal bill with tax and tip came to about $230 for four of us.

I find myself enjoying a bowl of their delicious noodles every time I make the trip to Austin.\\n\\nIf it's your first visit you have to start  with the Tonkotsu Original.  I find that it's a good measuring stick when comparing one ramen joint with the next.  As many others have said you really can't go wrong with this option.  The creamy broth will not disappoint.  It's not heavy at all and you can tell they simmer the pork bones for a long time.  The ramen pairs nicely with the chashu, ajitama egg, and wood ear mushrooms.  That's right.  They use legit mushrooms here.  None of that cheap stuff.  Chashu (pork belly) is hard to screw up, but Tatsu-ya's version is so tender that it literally falls apart when it touches your tongue.  Another notable thing about the chashu was it wasn't overly salty.  I hate it when places add too much salt to things.  When the salt takes the spotlight and masks the flavor of the food it's really a shame.  And if that's not enough the ajitama egg is the icing on the cake.  The egg isn't a soft boiled egg like most other places.  The egg here is marinated in soy sauce and the yolk isn't runny.  Not at all.  Which, in most cases would be a let down, but Tatsu-ya does an amazing job.  I don't know how they prepare or cook the egg and frankly, I don't care.  Just know it's going to be one of the best eggs you'll ever taste and you may want to order an extra egg on the side.  The one downside is the noodles are really thin.  Almost angel hair thin.  Not sure why they use these noodles, but it still works.  I still wish they would use the thicker noodles like the ones they serve in their Tsukemen (dipping noodles).\\n\\nSpeaking of Tsukemen, it's another thing that you must try.  It's a whole different experience and you'll be surprised that something so simple can taste so good.  if you're looking for a small sweet kick you definitely should give the Tsukemen a shot.\\n\\nTry to avoid peak hours unless you want to wait at least an hour.  Even after a year since opening their doors Ramen Tatsu-Ya you will still see lines out the door.

Potatoes were on point, not your average. \\n\\n-GriddleStack Burger: Two 5oz. patties of griddled natural grass fed beef w/ homemade pimiento cheese, lettuce, pickle, onion, smoked scallion mayo & side of fries. Choice of pink or well done.... add bacon or fried egg or crispy fried onions for $1.00 each.\\n\\n^ Pickiest eater chose this and said it was the best burger he had. I didn't get to try, but I'll take his word on it. He likes IN'N'OUT and so do I.  It was huge though. \\n\\n-Screen Door Plate: Choice of three house sides and / or tonight's local organic vegetables.  Served with a slice of savory cornbread....add $1.00 if choosing catfish.\\n\\n^ Dad got this: gumbo, crispy fried catfish, fried  drumsticks. Too much food. But, it was good. We would've loved to have plated everything unfinished in a box.. but, our hotel room sadly doesn't have a fridge.. So we only boxed up the cornbread for this. I got to try his dish: it was pretty good. Gumbo was a little salty, but that's always expected. I don't think he loved the gumbo out of everything though. **A LOT OF FOOD \\n\\n-Crispy Fried Buttermilk-Battered Chicken\\nAll natural boneless breast and thigh battered and fried to order. Served with Tasso ham gravy, mashed potatoes & choice of creamy coleslaw or ham hock collard greens...\\n\\n^ Mom got this. Said collared greens were hella salty.. I think that's the norm so it was fine for me. Pretty good. Her chicken and potatoes was good. **HUGE PORTION\\n\\n-House Smoked Beef Brisket\\n10 oz. of house smoked Natural beef brisket served w/ crispy fried onions, homemade bbq sauce, coleslaw & bbq baked beans..\\n\\n^ Other bro got this.. I liked his slaw: it was refreshing. He swapped out baked beans for mashed potatoes. The gravy was whatever. Potatoes were good in my opinion. \\n\\nMy parents wished they shared a plate such as The Screen Door or something. \\n\\nOverall everyone liked their food.

Corporate office that the store supervisor told me to follow-up with because he couldn't provide me with any type of confirmation that my card had been refunded.  Corporate accounting doesn't like to answer calls, clearly.  So, I submitted my detailed inquiry through the websites contact form.  No response. Finally, after another week, I called again, got accounting voicemail, tried the line again right away and John?, I think answered.  He had no clue what to do.  He then passed me to Adam who I was able to finally connect some dots.  He got my contact info and said he was go I ng to have the I.T. guy follow-up.  I then got a transaction refund approval screenshot from Sam, whom I believe is the supervisor who sent me to corporate originally!   Wild goose chase and STILL not a refund in my account.

I've been working all day since Wednesday so today was really the only opportunity I had to visit what seemed like the most appealing yelp reviewed spot (to me).\\n\\nI started out with the Scarlett (something) cocktail. It was essentially a reformulated margarita with a pomegranate flavor to it. I very much enjoyed the combination of tart and salty flavors. It was just boozy enough to be present without overwhelming. The flavor was light enough to match whatever I ordered.\\n\\nPrior to the meal arrival we received both cornbread and biscuits with some pre softened butter. They were both very flavorful and soft. Where both can suffer from occasional dryness I found that these were delicious and moist.\\nSide note: pre softened butter is a game changer. Spreading cold butter sucks. \\n\\nFor my actual meal I had he brisket sandwich with a side of Brussels sprouts. The sandwich had an awesome horseradish cream and some banana peppers on it. The flavor of the cream with the rich and delicious brisket was perfect. Honestly this is probably one of the 3 best sandwiches I've ever had.\\n\\nFor dessert we had the banana pudding. This was good but not an exceptional or mandatory component of the meal.

The one thing that puzzled me was 1/5th of the tables were empty... the ordering process could potentially be optimized. However, you do have access to tea while waiting, and they have heaters so you don't freeze in winter. \\n\\nI ordered the Tonkotsu Sho-Yu since I like my ramen a bit spicy and I saw crushed perppercorns as an ingredient, but I didn't taste any spice. My friend ordered the Original, and we both split two bowls - Chashu and curry bowl with chashu.\\n\\nChashu bowl was great, I could eat it, and almost be full. The meat was very flavorful, and even though it was just meat, pickled ginger, and rice, it was yummy. The curry bowl with chashu was also a great deal, considering it was only $.50 for extra chashu for the curry bowl vs. $3 for chashu for the ramen (rip-off).\\n\\nChashu in the ramen was great, and the soup was very flavorful. Noodles were yummy - a bit thin for me, but still good. Only issue was that halfway through, I realized the soup was really really oily/greasy. I started getting tired of the broth, and going from such flavorful broth to rice really threw me off. My friend agreed with me, and tried to not touch her broth at all.

It was mediocre and cold. My salmon was $30. It had a horseradish parmesan crust on it. It was just okay. The texture of the salmon was good. Cooked nicely and all but not amazing and pretty bland. The green beans that came with it were a little too al dente and totally boring. The red roasted potatoes were good. My kids had already eaten dinner at the hotel so they just had a dessert.

We were told the dining room was\\nfull, and that our only option was to sit outside.  The gentlemen\\nbehind the register, a gray haired man with facial hair, if I recall\\ncorrectly, delivered this information in a remarkably curt and\\nunsmiling fashion.  I was left wondering if I'd somehow already\\nannoyed this man in some way.  I asked if it was all right if I took a\\nlook outside on the patio to see if that was a viable option.  I may\\nhave gotten an affirmative grunt, at best. It was scorching hot, with\\nthe fans, for some reason, not pointing at any of the actual tables.\\nI returned to the host/hostess podium and asked if it possible to\\nwait, or put my name on the list.  I don't recall the man actually\\nanswering me verbally, merely just looking at me with what appeared to\\nbe thinly veiled disgust.  Now officially confused by his demeanor, I\\nasked how late brunch was open, surmising that, even were I choking\\nto death while on fire, I wouldn't be receiving any assistance from\\nthis fellow.  Finally he deigned to answer a question.  \\"2:30\\" he\\nannounced testily.\\n\\nAfter conferring with my friend, we decided to wait 45 minutes and\\nreturn at 2, in hopes that an indoor table would be freed up.  We did\\nso, and was relieved to find a younger man with dark hair behind the\\npodium.  My relief was short lived, however, as we were immediately\\ntold to put our names on the list \\"for 2:30\\".   I asked, confused,\\n\\"what time is brunch over?\\".  \\"2:30, but we don't have any more\\ntables\\", he says.  I had already surveyed the restaurant and saw two\\nempty tables in the outer dining room alone.  I gestured at an empty\\ntable immediately next to us, and the man said something to the effect\\nof \\"yes, well, we don't double seat\\", as if I'm supposed to know what\\nthat means, and even if I did, to know how it would mean that two\\npeople entering the restaurant half an hour before close of brunch are\\nobviously not entitled to it.  I looked at him for a second, trying in\\nvain to make sense of it, and asked \\"so the brunch ends at 2:30, it's\\nnow 2, there are empty tables, but we can't eat it\\".  \\"Yes, that's\\nright, we, uh, don't double seat\\" he said again.\\n\\nSurprisingly we didn't wait for 2:30, mainly out of fear of being told\\nonce again we weren't entitled to any food (\\"Yes, we don't double\\nseat.  In fact we just decided we don't even single seat.

Even if you're waiting up to half an hour to be served, it's absolutely worth the wait - the food is beyond incredible. \\n\\nBe sure to check out the Specials before ordering - there are always some unique dishes to be had, especially around the holidays! My all-time favourite thing to order here is the 7th Trimester brunch - a fluffy biscuit covered in a fried egg, bacon, smothered in mac & cheese and sprinkled with crunchy potato chips. For the ultimate experience, order some sausage gravy on the side and pour on top. Grab a Nutella Turbo ice coffee for a morning caffeine boost (just as delicious as it sounds). As well as serving the most incredible brunch food in town, they have an unmissable bakery selection of fresh cakes, pies and other sugary baked goods to take home and stuff your face with when you're (eventually) hungry again. My favourite is the Crack Pie, not just because the name worried our Uber driver when discussing our amazing brunch on the way home, though it's aptly named and once you taste the sugary-caramel goodness it's impossible to stop eating. \\n\\nWe took a friend with us who is unable to eat gluten and she really enjoyed a veggie omelette and a gluten-free coconut macaroon from the bakery, so we didn't feel quite as bad shoveling biscuit and mac & cheese into our faces.\\n\\nMy only complaint is that there definitely needs to be more seating available - this place is tiny and gets so busy! It's not somewhere you can sit and socialise at for hours on a weekend, as once you're able to sit down, you eat your food and leave so others can sit down.

From a foodie's perspective, I'll admit, it's awesome to have a newer variety of sushi rolls and Japanese cuisine options available in that neighbourhood. However, from a historian and archaeologist's angle, I'm more inclined to detest what they've done with the interior of Mr. Johnson's heritage home. \\n\\nThis 'Arts & Craft' style home was built under the watchful supervision of pioneer Andrew M. Johnson and his wife, Margaret. The Johnson house (or, \\"Glenedward\\"), has seen several transitions over the last century. From a family home to a funeral home, and a number of failed/successful restaurants, Glenedward has seen a handful of visitors. (More info here: http://www.flickr.com/photos/bobkh/306314123/ ).\\n\\nThe food at Sushi Oyama has a magnificent presentation. I haven't seen so many different coloured tobiko before! Tasty are the rolls, reasonable are the prices, and friendly are the servers. In spite of all this, my brother was served frozen tuna sashimi, which spoiled his entire meal. Being served frozen seafood at any sushi restaurant is among one of the most unappealing things any diner can encounter hence the reason for the 3-star review.\\n\\nAll-in-all, I still firmly believe that Sushi Oyama is a better choice in comparison to the other sushi restaurants along that part of Kingsway. Glenedward might give you an odd vibe here and there, but don't worry. It's probably just Mr. Johnson popping by to see what the fuss is all about. After all, he did pass away in that house in 1934."},{"name":"Eden Burger","address":"1437 N High St","city":"Columbus","stars":"4.5","text":"Been vegetarian for a year and a half and have tried every mimic/faux meat out there.

I ordered food online, payed the delivery fee as well as a generous tip and when it came to delivering the food the delivery guy called me and asked me to come outside to pick up my food. It was raining and the reason he gave was that there was no parking on the street, but a look out of the window showed that there clearly were plenty of parking spots. The next excuse was that there was no legal parking, which is simply not true, as there is plenty of legal parking on the street and most businesses I've ordered from will deliver to my apartment door without any questions asked. This guy did not even ring my door bell. Since revving his engine would not draw me out he ended up driving off. Calling the restaurant and explaining the situation to Becca, the manager on deck, caused her to say she could get the food to me if I came down to pick it up. Now, to me, that is not what I really consider delivery... if I have to get the food it is not being delivered to me. Expressing this alongside with the suggestion to cancel the order was met with an OK and being hung up on right away. When calling them back in order get hold of her boss, she said he wasn't around but would share her opinion on this matter. From this I can only gather that Soul Fire does not value their customers or their business. The service and (frankly) manners displayed by this restaurant have convinced me to never ever order anything from them again, regardless of the fact that they do have good barbecue.

Fast forward and I'm 19 and a student at ut austin and i go back to try them once more. I got a veggie meat mix pizza that tasted amazing and the pretzels with sauce.

My opinion: come here and pick up a pizza and take it home.  It's beyond cramped, so be prepared for that if you want to sit there and eat.  \\n\\nSo how was the pizza?  It was delicious!  It's very different from a Donatos, Dominos, or Pizza Hut.  It's simply tastes like a real homemade pizza should.  The crust is thin and delicious; don't expect it to be thick or anything like other commercial pizza joints.  The toppings were great as well.  The pizza that I ordered had onions on it and instead of simply cutting up onions and putting them on as a topping, you can tell they were first carmelized - which was a great touch that I could immediately taste.  \\n\\nThe pizzas are offered in two options: one 10\\" pizza or three 10\\" pizzas.  I ordered a single 10\\" and it was $10.  It was the perfect size for two people.

I found it very odd and it felt like it was storytime. Thumbing through the book all I found was (severely) up-close pictures of some of the sushi rolls they offer. And, there were no prices. We had to wait a while for our server to come by and ask if we were ready. When she did I asked for a sushi menu with prices and she said we were supposed to have it then went and got us one. We put in our order and were told the sushi will be a little while. That little while ended up being at least 45 minutes, granted the sushi bar was busy with what looked like one sushi chef and there was a \\"help wanted\\" sign at the door. So I gave them that and wasn't upset over it.\\nWe did have crab puffs while we waited. They were just ok. Not super crunchy. The wonton wrapper was too thick for my liking. Priced at $3.95 for 6, so not too bad.\\n\\nWe had the following sushi rolls:\\nVegas roll, $6.50 - Tempura fried roll that we really enjoyed. It was our favorite of the bunch.\\nTiger roll, $12.50 - Had tempura sofstshell crab in it but it was cold which made it less enjoyable. I expect more from a $12.50 roll.\\nOregon roll, $7.50 - This roll was good and had a slight spiciness to it. It could have used a tad more spiciness. \\nNew york roll,  $4.50 - This was a nice and plain smaller roll that is good to slap some wasabi on and dip in soy sauce.\\n\\nTotal cost came to $38 before tip which, honestly, is not bad at all.

I was looking locally for what was around and while there was both Florida Mall and Mall at Millenia the traffic was sort of bad and I didn't really feel like going to far or being stuck in traffic.  \\n\\nI knew that Universal Studios and the CityWalk was nearby so I decided I'd surprise my wife by taking us there.  I've been to CityWalk before but not to Cowfish so I thought I'd give it a try.\\n\\nTo date I can't say I've ever seen or heard of a place that does both burgers AND sushi in some sort of American/Japanese fusion.\\n\\nI started it off with a little taste of 312 which I had had last year on a trip to Chicago.  I know Goose Island is brewed all over now but I liked that beer the last time I had it at Lou Malnati's.\\n\\nTo start of we went with \\"The Boss\\" maki roll.  It was described as, \\"Spicy yellowfin tuna, kani, English cucumber inside, coated in tempura flakes.  Topped with avocado, premium tuna, wasabi tobiko and wasabi mayo\\".  This roll was cut into 9 pieces divided into 3 piece servings on the platter.  It was both a good looking and good tasting roll.  \\n\\nIt took a short while for the burgers to arrive and they also looked attractive.  The long platters seemed a bit long while the fries were spread across the plate to perhaps not make it look so empty.  The fries were decent but the burgers were the feature on this platter.\\n\\nI had ordered the Hoisin burger and my wife had asked for the K-Town.  The burgers are both half pound cooked to order.  \\n\\nThe K-Town is described as, \\"Beef burger, fried kimchi, applewood bacon, gochujang sauce, pickled red onions, leaf lettuce, sesame bun\\"...\\n\\nwhile the Hoisin is, \\"Beef burger, hoisin cooked short ribs, candied smoked bacon, pickled red onions, on a bed of English cucumbers, brioche bun\\"\\n\\nWe both cut our burgers in half and swapped so we could have half of each.  The K-Town was more savory because of the kimchi when combined with the onions had a nice veggie bite and sort of snap.  The meat on the K-Town was cooked well done.\\n\\nThe Hoisin was a little sweet because of the sauce.  Because of the rib and pickled onions it tasted closer to a pork bao sandwich.  This burger had a lot of meat because of the added rib meat.\\n\\nOur server didn't really come around to fill our drinks or ask me if I wanted another beer but I was ok with what I had to drink anyway.\\n\\nOverall the food was really good and the concept of burgers and sushi rolls is sort of something completely different.

The cranberry mayo was bad, not sure why, maybe too sweet. I love a turkey sandwich with cranberry and mayo so it's not me, I order them at lots of places and always like them. The white cheddar was bland, really, it seemed to be included for texture and bulk as it had no flavor, or was it the flavor was drowned out by the mayo. Nope, I tried it all by itself. It was definitely cheese but could I swear it was cheddar, definitely not. Sourdough bread? I don't think so. After chewing and swallowing the first bite I considered the possibility the bread was stale and maybe I should just ask for fresh bread. But then I realized it was useless. The only thing those two slices had in common with sourdough bread were the color and general bread shape. It was dense, bland, stale and there was not sourdough taste. I decided it was better that I not eat the bread so I could enjoy the chips. Big mistake. The chips were bad, some were over salted, others were overcooked and some just plain tasted awful.

Perhaps the \\"brunch rush\\" had already subsided? Who knows? At any rate, we were seated within just a few minutes. The atmosphere wasn't very romantic, but then again, it was 11:00 am. Had we been there in the evening, I'm sure I would have felt differently. The decor was lovely though; lots of exposed brick, some ironwork, and pretty glass sconces on the walls. The bathrooms aren't too shabby either.\\n\\nThe Saturday brunch menu is sparse but economical; for $7.95 one can have two items (sort of an appetizer and entree) and coffee/other beverage. Score! I picked the fresh seasonal fruits and creamy scrambled eggs with chorizo. The boy had the empanada and the Santa Fe-style Eggs Benedict. \\n\\nThe cornbread comes with a selection of three distinct, interesting little toppings: cranberry chipotle jam, apricot habanero jam, and some kind of creamy butter. I made sure to sample all three, and while all were delicious, I was partial to the cranberry chipotle. Even Boyfriend, who distinctly dislikes chipotle, dug it. Score another point for Masa. \\n\\nI tried a bite of the empanada, which was filled with apple and another fruit that I can't remember, but believe me when I say that it was delicious, hot, and cinnamon-y. The seasonal fruits were delightfully refreshing.\\n\\nOur food arrived promptly and we dug in with great anticipation. The scrambled eggs were fabulous. The chorizo was the perfect complement. My only complaint in regards to the food? The eggs were extremely spicy in some places and mild in others. Apparently there was some uneven spice distribution happening there. The homefries and whole-grain toast are both worth mentioning too. Sadly I couldn't finish my food due to the generous portions, but it was easily worth every penny of that $7.95.\\n\\nMy only qualm about the overall experience? Masa charges $1.95 for coffee regardless of whether or not one actually orders coffee. The owner (?) explained to us that he started adding the $1.95 because he was \\"losing money\\" on beverages or some such. Hmmmm, sounds fishy, Masa.

I should have read the reviews prior to coming it would have saved me a lot of time and frustration. I came for lunch last Monday 7/24/17 to eat while my tires were getting changed across the street. I ordered the chicken tenders and 4 cheese mac. When I got my order I had 3 small chicken tenders about the size of three inches in length and the four cheese mac was basically white sauce with honey and pieces of bacon (incredibly misleading). I took a few bites and sent it back, however I did finish the chicken tenders. My meal came to be $16 I asked for the manager (Jermaine) and he comped 5 dollars off and my meal came down to 11 so basically I paid $9 for 3 small chicken tenders and $2 for a sweet tea. I could've went to Popeyes and got better tasting tenders. The manager came to the table and accused me of trying to get the meal for free. I told him I ate tenders but the mac and \\"cheese\\" was not good and I only had a few bites, after him continuously repeating he took off $5 dollars I told him he wasn't listening to me and to just give me customer service number. He rolls his eyes and tell me \\"ok and a matter of fact it'll he on your receipt at bottom\\". He did not bring the receipt back and I heard him in the back arguing that he gave me $5 dollars off. I told the server and host he is very unprofessional and does not set a good example of a manager and I will be sending a Yelp review and contacting corporate. He failed basic management 101, listen to the customer, let the customer vent and ask the customer what he or she thinks should be done to make the experience better, versus assuming. I admitted I ate the tenders, the meal should've been no more than $7-8 with the comp. The tenders were very subpar and small. My server told the manager that I was going to submit this review to Yelp and I heard Jermaine in the back making statements such as \\"what he going to do\\", a very unprofessional manager.

This place is awesome in so many ways. Great drinks, good beer list, amazing hotdogs, and crazy good sides!\\n\\nWhen I come here, it's usually with my boyfriend (we sit at the bar or a small table) or a group of friends (obviously, a larger table). It can be tough to find a seat some days, but if you're patient, you will win out. Carryout here is also very convenient. I called in yesterday, in fact, to place a carryout order at 1 p.m.; it was ready in 10 minutes, and back to work I went.\\n\\nMy standbys at Dirty Frank's include:\\n- Cowgirl Carmen, a hotdog topped with coney sauce, cheddar, and Fritos. Yum!\\n- Classy Lady, a hotdog topped with cheese sauce and crushed potato chips.\\n- Lara's Pittsburgh Princess, a hotdog topped with slaw, malt vinegar (!), and fries (!!).\\n- Tater tots, ahhh. I am salivating just thinking of these. Super crispy and amazing like your cafeteria taters tried to be.\\n- Cheese fries. I don't know what Dirty Frank's does to their potatoes but they are rustic tasting and delish. Could use some more cheese sauce on them though.\\n- Pretzels, which are my ultimate vice. I usually don't order them here, just because I can only take so much gluttony in one location.\\n\\nI also ordered an amazing, life-changing hotdog topped with bacon, cheddar, jalape√±os, and pretzel bites (special of the night). Make sure you check the whiteboard to the left of the entrance when you enter so you don't miss out!\\n\\nAnyway, I could wax poetic about Dirty Frank's for ages, but with all of these awesome reviews, you may as well just head that way now and grab yourself a dog or two. I don't know if I mentioned, but Dirty Frank's is also inexpensive--most hotdogs are about $2-3 (an additional 50 cents if you want a jumbo all-beef dog) and my tater tots are a whopping $2 for a huge portion. My carryout order yesterday came to a grand total of $5, including a loaded Lara's Pittsburgh Princess and tater tots.

Regardless, be prepared to wait a really long time: first to get seated, second to be waited on, third to get your food.  If you are lucky, you will get a server who is cheerful and attentive, but you might just as easily get the surly kid in the baseball hat who is too busy and important to get around to waiting on you until you have sat at your table for 10-15 minutes.  Then, you wait 45 minutes to an hour, shifting constantly in your excruciatingly uncomfortable seats, for your food to arrive. Conversation is impossible because it is so loud.

As with all new boyfriends to old boyfriends: THERE IS NO COMPARISON!  \\n\\nOkay, with that out of the way, I had the goyza appetizer and for the main dish ordered a bowl of dipping noodles.  Both were delicious!  With the dipping noodles,  the cut of pork I received was fatty and the noodles cold.  Is this the norm?  I do not know.  But, I went with the flow, dipped my noodles and ate away.  \\n\\nAs I continued to eat my meal, I did see that this place is super busy, they don't  allow take out either.  I would say that this is not the right locale if one wanted to bring your large group of friends as it the place is small.  They won't let you order until a table is ready.  If you want to linger over your goyza and dipping noodles you might want to rethink that idea.  The night I went,  I was with two of my old girlfriends hoping to catch up.  We did but as we stayed and chatted the staff ended up asking us to move to the bar so they could sit another group of people.  So that's one of the reasons I was waffling over a 3/4 star review.   \\n\\nThe wait service was stellar and the food good, but with the busyness and no take out option I could see Tatsu-Ya being better as a lunch option as it is aimed more for people who want to eat and go."},{"name":"Bambinelli's","address":"3202 Northlake Pkwy NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Hands down, this is the best kept Italian secret in Atlanta.

It's a $14 burger and I don't know why, maybe because there's Art on the walls? Food I get, but art is a world I know nothing about, combine the two in a restaurant setting and I can't quite piece it together. It's snobby, but no less so than The Four Seasons, the type of place that very well could have a good burger, but sadly does not. It's a $14 burger disguised as a $7 burger, as they use the dreaded combination of ground Sirloin and Brioche, two automatic fails in my mind. Unmelted American cheese tops the patty (seriously, how can you not melt American cheese?) that at least looks promising, but looks can be deceiving. The meat, which of curse is too lean, is completely over-packed, and is tough, unpleasant to chew and lacking identity. It's seasoned, but not necessarily tasting like beef, meaty perhaps, but not tasting of a cow, if that makes any sense at all. The fries taste pretty good too, but a little too pale in color to take on any substantial crunch, and far too few grace my plate, especially for the cost. In the competitive world of burgers in Boston, Art Bar fails to distinguish itself in any way. It's okay, I'm certainly not offended, but in many ways it's just another day at the office for the humble hamburger, which too often is plain, boring, and lackluster.

I have a list of favorite ramen places which, if a friend we're to say, \\"I want incredibly good ramen\\" I would take them too. We would get tankatsu or spicy pork or what ever dope ramen the place has and would leave incredibly happy. Living in LA, this is an easy thing to accomplish. \\n\\nRamen Tatsu-ya would not make that list. This is because Ramen Tatsu-Ya was just on a completely different level then any Ramen place I have experienced. This is the kind of place I would take a friend if they were to ask me, \\"I want a religious experience in my mouth.\\" And as long as I didn't over think what they said, I would buy us a plane ticket, fly into the Austin Airport, get into our decent rental car (because cabs suck) and drive directly to this incredibly place. The staff was cute, the art was unique and consistent, the atmosphere was a little hipster-y but I can dig ironic kids, and the food was more than exceptional. \\n\\nSO! Since I'm gushing over it so much I'll talk food first. They're menu is not too expansive which is fine, too many choices leaves too many a person wondering what could have been... in their tummies. You walk up, you order your ramen (where you add an extra egg, and pork, and brussel sprouts because you're literally a genius)  you order your drink, you order your shirt because it looks pretty awesome, and you wait the reasonably short amount of time it takes for them to bring you your awesome. Just a note, this place is not a waited place, they'll bring you your food but if you want something you gotta go ask for it. Another note, also get the Yodas, even if you think \\"Brussel Sprouts are stupid and gross and stupid\\" just get the Yodas, they were a nice complicated treat that I'm still thinking about. So back to getting your incredible Ramen. It's displayed perfectly, you get to see your pork spiral, magically soft egg, perfect amount of sauce, and what's going to make you a happy happy camper. Their broth is creamy, savory, and feels perfectly weighted on your. The noodles are cooked just enough to be a lil bouncy and feel very satisfying as you tear them up. The pork... is quite literally (figuratively) butter. I could have chewed mine with my tongue. It was just juicy with it's own porkiness but also had soaked up just enough of the broth to be creamy as well. The egg... just... just so perfect. So perfectly creamy and so perfectly cooked and leaves you wishing you had more eggs. All in all, 5 stars on food, it was perfect.\\n\\nThe atmosphere and scenery are definitely unique. My understanding is a single local artist decorated and designed the decor and the consistency through out backs up this story. It's all pretty DIY, we got all this stuff at home depot but it turned out so well that I want to post it on the internet and let everyone tell me how great I did. Regardless, it looks really cool. If you aren't a fan of public bathrooms, make an exception. The artist covered the walls in incredibly cool paintings, it's definitely a restroom moment you should share on instagram. It's ok if everyone thinks you probably took the video/picture while taking a tinkle, it's worth it to document all the glorious red, white, and black paint. \\n\\nALL IN ALL, this review is long enough.

They offer beer and wine. Guys are very knowledgeable and ready help u decide and understand the options. Pizza being made is pretty quick. I would recommend this place food was delicious.

This is literally my favorite of all favorite eateries. Seriously, no lie, faaaavvvv!! It is pure love!! Let me tell you why:\\n\\nFirst, their tortilla chips are soo delicious! They cook them fresh on the spot, so when they get to your table they are piping hot. Careful, you might even burn yourself on the first bite they are sooo freshy fresh! The salsa is a tiny bit thin, but also made with fresh ingredients, so I'd take that any day over nasty bottled stuff (that I have unfortunately experienced at a couple sports bars in town. blech!)\\n\\nOkay, so to go with the amazing chips is the guacamole dip! Also freshy fresh fresh, and no, it's not made at your table, (but I've had that kind before at Z√≥calo and it was too limey) but it sooo wonderfully mixed and spiced and melt-in-your-mouth delicious! I recommend getting at least the dip to start, AND maybe adding it onto your entree as well if you're big on guac.\\n\\nFor entrees there is a decent selection of Tex-Mex fare. I recommend doing the chicken quesadilla (over chicken enchiladas) because it is a similar chicken and gooey cheese mix, but the quesadilla is so big, you'll have leftovers for lunch the next day! (Esp after chowing down on the chips...)\\n\\nI also recommend fajitas. They are a little pricier, but again, the portion is very generous. I am all about bringing a little Border Home. The salads are good too, and the dressings are all homemade. \\n\\nProbably the best part about Border is that everything is from scratch. I remember going somewhere for Mexican and ordering enchiladas. I asked if they could be made without cilantro and my waiter informed me that the enchiladas were pre-stuffed. And frozen. Seriously? Never at Border!! They should be called Border Fresh Caf√©, actually!\\n\\nSo last are the margaritas. Which should be drunk profusely throughout the meal. They have some really yummy ones! Sometimes they come out a little foamy if you get them frozen, but I have always had great success with the strawberry margarita. They also do sangria frozen or on the rocks. YUM!\\n\\nI would highly recommend Border Caf√©!!! Sometimes it is crowded, but the service is super fast and the waitstaff is awesome! And while you wait you can always start with a margarita at the bar. They are pretty cheap, starting at $6. So go now!! And get 2!

It had crunchy romaine, corn nuts, and cotija cheese, but the highlight was the cilantro dressing. I am partial to cilantro, so if you aren't it might not be for you...or you may be swayed! The bits of corn nut gave it just a touch of saltiness, and I love cotija! Next fav was the crab pasta. The noodles had a nice bite, and the chunks of crab were yummy. The pork was also good, cooked just with a hint of pink which we like, and it was accompanied by a mixture of potatoes and scallions. Hubby thought this dish was on the salty side, but it is in an olive brown butter. I enjoyed the butter. You may just want to use it sparingly if you prefer less salt. Our least fav was the chicken liver mousse. The mousse was light and flavorful, but the bread was charred darker than I prefer. This made for an uncomfortable bite that hurt my mouth. Overall, the food was good and the ambience was very nice. The noise level was fairly low, which made for easy conversation with my hubby. Overall, it was an enjoyable experience!"},{"name":"Pollo Bravo","address":"126 SW 2nd Ave, Ste 10","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"This is probably my favorite chicken roasterie in town. It's not much of a splurge; happy hours prices are crazy cheap, with the best quarter bird in town for only five dollars, so if you're looking for a deal, this is the place to do it. Our friend, Tom, was able to give us some great guidance, and suggested some great pairings of beers and birds, which was an amazing idea (hazy IPA is perfect with romesco sauce). Everything I've said is 100% true and then some! Obviously the chicken is the main event, and every time we dive into one it's top-notch -- juicy and perfectly cooked.

I'd never been before, and I think she said she was here one previous time. I wasn't at all familiar with it or its menu, since I didn't research it beforehand or anything like that. Most of my familiarity with 903 Mills Market involved hearing the personalities on 104.1 talk about it when they were delivered lunch/etc.\\n\\nWhen I arrived, I tried to park in the lot off to the side of the market, but there was no space available. Because of this, I had to park over by the lake a block or so over. Not a big deal. Anyway, just be aware that you may not be able to park adjacent to this place since the parking spaces are limited. There seems to be ample parking over by where I parked or on the streets within a radius of a block or two.\\n\\nI enjoyed sitting outside of the market - the patio area just outside the front door is spacious and clean. Many couples were there, and a number of them brought their dogs with them. It was pretty cool. As I sat and waited for my friend to arrive, an employee noticed that the table at which I was sitting did not have an umbrella over it to provide shade, so he set one up. He was very accommodating and friendly. The rest of the staff with whom I interacted also was the same.\\n\\nMy friend had some sort of salad, which she said she enjoyed, and I had a vegetarian burrito. When it was delivered to our table, I thought it looked pretty funny; it was square-shaped. The shape doesn't matter, really; it was just kind of peculiar. No matter. It was large and full of fillings, including corn. (I'm unsure I'd ever had a burrito with corn in it prior to this one.) I had a few beers here as well, and perhaps would've had several more if we stayed longer than we did. The beer selection is very good; the usual suspects (Budweiser products, etc.) can be purchased here (and I believe six- and twelve-packs are sold here?), though I opted for I believe an organic apricot wheat beer and I think a pomegranate one. Both were enjoyable. The prices for the food and the beverages seemed reasonable. The menu had a lot on it and appeared to be varied. I may have to go back at some point to try something else since my choice of the burrito wasn't the most exciting one.\\n\\nYou have to go inside to order and to get additional beverages/etc., which I thought was weird. There is no waiter service, other than when your food is brought to you if you're sitting outside. That's really the lone quirk I can think of here, so I'm comfortable giving 903 Mills Market a 4-star review. Definitely worth a look if you want to grab a few good beers and a sandwich.

If you are in a large group, it might be hard finding some seats because there are not many.

My two friends and I came here on a whim, mostly excited for the deep fried ice cream. ordered terriaki chicken and noodles which actually tasted good. However my crab puffs were awfully sweet? My friend ordered orange chicken which not only was bright, bright red but had so much sauce she had to pat it down in white rice to remove it. My other friend got the Vegas roll. Now, I have been to MANY sushi restaurants in different state's and it always comes with crab. I have heard of it having SMOKED salmon however. This vegas roll was tempura batter, rice, and raw salmon, Strange. Not to mention the whole thing just tasted awful. No flavor, fell apart, just like no vegas roll either of us had ever had. The food was not the worst part. When our server ( her name is ANN) initially took our order, she came up the first tiime a few minutes after we sat down and we said we were still looking. She came back about a minute later so we just quickly figured it out. My friend (who ordered the sushi) ordered bubble tea and then the server moved on the take the rest of the orders and assumed my friend was not getting food LOL. She rushed us as if she had a time limit, even though there was maybe one other guest in the entire restaurant. The place was completely dead. We got our food, my friend was completely dissatisfied with her sushi and asked to take it back and get something else. We tried to explain to Ann that we were unaware their version of a vegas roll was rice and raw salmon deep friend (barely fried, might I add) and she ripped the menu from my friends hand and put it in my face to explain what the sushi came with. I was appalled and that behavior and tried to further explain that she did not get what she expected and needed something else. The server said \\"I wasnt the one who ordered it so I cant help you\\". My friend asked for some extra sauce so she might make it taste better and the server charged her a dollar for it. we asked for the check and some boxes so we could get the hell out of there. The server slammed my friends box in the center of the table after decently giving me mine. On top of all of this, we all payed on 3 separate checks with 3 completely different debit cards and she charged them each TWICE.  Still waiting for that to be resolved.

This location may be new and fancy, but with a lot of Chinese restaurants and the traffic through them they become run down, dirty and tacky after a while. So unless, the shopping center and restaurant management itself doesn't keep up with the upkeep, it won't be fancy for long. The big indicator of this was the recent conditions of their bathrooms. You'll see they flunked their inspection last October. \\n    Let's rewind to my last, only and final trip for dim sum, the service was not so great. The dim sum was nothing like their other location. The food sometimes was overcooked and you could tell some of the meats had been sitting around because they were over dried. We waited about an hour for a table for two on a Sunday, so they shouldn't have an issue with food turnover and the freshness of the food. This place doesn't have the carts, but rather you order off a dim sum menu which is okay. You'd expect for things to be even more hot and fresh if they're ordered instead of coming off a cart but not with this location. \\n     So unless I hear a glowing review from one of my other dim sum aficionados, I won't be going back.

We also ordered roasted beets with fried fennel, a lightly fried softshell crab (amazing), and the grilled bluefish (by far our best dish).  We were perfectly full by the end, although we were definitely tempted by some of the desserts we saw passing our table.\\n\\nService: extremely attentive.  They often switched out fresh plates between dishes, and they were always there the minute our water glass ran low or we needed another cocktail.  And the cocktails are spot on, by the way.\\n\\nI would absolutely go back to Alden & Harlow, and they're constantly changing menu means that I'll probably never try the same dish twice (even if I want to!)."},{"name":"Screen Door","address":"2337 E Burnside St","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"Crispy Fried Buttermilk-Battered Chicken with Coleslaw, Mashed Potatoes and Gravy.

Yes, from time to time I will seek out a dessert (aka this experience!) but I have in no way tried every cupcake place in town and am no expert on how a cupcake is supposed to be. But, how hard can it be to assess? I thought Hey Cupcake! was super yummy.\\n\\nSo here's the story- I was dining with my bf at Annie's downtown and a thought popped into my head. \\"When is the last time you had a red velvet cupcake?\\" Naturally, I said this out loud. My own answer was about three years. My bf's was \\"yeah, probably about a year.\\" Clearly it was high time to get a red velvet cupcake. Clearly, Hey Cupcake! was the place to go. We drove to the trailer on South Congress but they were out of Red Velvets!!! This was probably one of my most disappointing moments of 2009, and after a brief consideration of settling for a carrot cake cupcake instead, I decided I was a girl on a mission and that mission was to accept nothing less than a red velvet cupcake. \\n\\nThe girl working at the SoCo trailer called the Burnet location and had them set aside two red velvets for us. We drove the twenty minutes or so (see, I told you I was on a mission) and arrived at the Burnet location to find our glorious cupcakes waiting for us! That was probably one of my happier moments of 2009. What a whirlwind of emotions that night brought, all spurred by cupcakes obviously.\\n\\nAnywho, the guy working there (black guy with dreads) was AWESOME! First of all, he threw in a free extra red velvet cupcake for us. That was straight up unprecedented kindness. I was touched. Next, I struck up a conversation with him and realized he has a crazy talent for being able to predict what flavor of cupcakes people are going to order. About 6 people came in and out during the time I was chillin there and he got every single prediction right. It was hilarious! As a general rule, in case you are wondering, asian people like to order Red Velvets and blondes like to order Vanilla cupcakes. (I am not Asian but also not blonde so I was a wildcard?) This guy was lots of fun and super nice and accomodating. \\n\\nAs for the taste...all my expectations for this occasional treat were met and surpassed!

The staff is super sweet and helpful. They let you know how much longer you have based off where you are in line and a good update on what meat is available. We  waited 5.5 hours on a Saturday. We got there at 8am and didn't order until 1:30.  Time did fly by. It's a great way to people watch, especially when they're chugging down beer and taking shots before noon. As for the food, it wasn't the most amazing thing ever. We had the brisket, beef ribs, and potato salad. Sides are completely unnecessary with the meal, don't bother ordering them. The brisket and beef ribs were extremely tender and melted in your mouth. I just didn't think they were marinated well or as salty as I would like. They use an espresso rub. It tasted better the second day, you could actually taste the flavor. I've had better bbq before. I wish I could give them a 3.5.

Everything was DELICIOUS and it was such a great combo of things for only $16. My sister got a black and Brie burger, which had Brie, blackberries, and honey--super interesting and really good.

You get ALOT more rice cake here with the order of dukbokki, more than almost all the other local places that serves it. Didn't try the cheese corn but apparently it was very cheesy and sweet.

We sampled 4 baos for 6 dollars each. My first was the pork belly 2 ways and it was delicious. The last pork belly bao I had was in Berlin and I can honestly say that the Bao Down version was better. The addition of crispy pork really made the bao and changed up the texture of the dish (otherwise after a few bites it's all squishy fat texture); highly recommend this Bao. My next bao was the BBQ Pork Bao. It was OK. The BBQ sauce combined with the sweet bun was a little too much sweetness for my taste. My wife had the catfish Bao and the Chicken Bao which she preferred the chicken, again she thought the catfish was too sweet.  \\n\\nWe had a side order of Kimchi fries and Bao beignets. Both were delicious and the Beignets were a steal at 4 dollars.\\n\\nThey had a decent selection of beer that included 2 choices of beer from 33 Acres brewery which was a great addition.\\n\\nThe staff were very friendly and though this place is primarily self serve they offered to bring our food to us.\\n\\nAll in all, a great little place!

Atmosphere was very informal, with a friendly staff made us feel right at home.   On a warm day, the AC wasn't quite up to snuff it seemed, but not unbearably so.  We started with the Cajun Calamari Appetizer, which was deep fried just right with a light crunchy breading, and came with a tasty honey lime jalapeno sauce.  Two of us had a side salad, the Asian Spinach Salad, which was perhaps the only mildly disappointing dish, with a sesame ginger dressing that had little taste (couldn't taste the ginger at all) and not terribly imaginative.   My party all picked different salmon dishes for entrees, including the Smoked Salmon Avocado Salad, Salmon Stuffed with Bay Shrimp and Spinach, and Honey Ginger-Lime Salmon.  We all tasted each others' entrees and all unanimously agreed each was tasty.  We wrapped up our meal with a slice of key lime pie each, which was delicious.

Although wonton crumbs were flying everywhere and I ended up with a sesame oil stain on my top, don't let that stop you from ordering it, it was very delicious!\\nThe cioppino in my opinion, was the star of the meal. It was light, flavorful, the seafood was tender and cooked perfectly and it was perfectly balanced. The only issue I had was that it's served only with a wonton crisp and could definitely use a starch element like pasta or bread to soak up the delicious broth. \\nThe Tiramisu was pretty meh- I would pass, the champagne and apple cider Sorbet was more successful imo. \\nThe service was wonderful and so was the atmosphere, but given the high prices and just above average food, I doubt I'd return."},{"name":"Stubb's Bar-B-Q","address":"801 Red River St","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"Got here on Fri night, 8pm with 6 people.

I would've rated the brunch 3.5/5 including the price, wait, environment, service, etc. \\n\\nDinner is a different (AND BETTER) story though. I touched the chicken with the knife and it started sliding through. That's how soft and juicy the chicken was! Also, it was FRESH FRESH FRESH out the fryer.

Needless to say, I never quite learned my lesson in waiting for the food to cool down and walked out with a burnt tongue. Get in mah belly!\\n\\nThe chicken had a nice kick, but didn't have the flavoring of any kind of hot or spicy sauce. As far as flavor goes, the spiciness stood out the most.

The sushi selection is okay, though leans towards the gaijin side (for example, several deep-fried sushi rolls - and yes I tried one.. not my thing) and not much beyond tuna and unagi in terms of fish variety. The prices are good though, and the rolls were pretty good. We also ordered an entree, which was okay but pretty much something you could find at any Chinese place. Service was negligible, though we did get an apology for being ignored.\\n\\nSo to sum up: decent sushi at good prices, especially for not being a sushi-boat kind of place. (Rolls were all fresh.)

Got up very early and arrived right at 6am to stake out our spot in line and was lucky enough to be very first! I was a little shocked, I thought for sure there would be others there already but we were the sole line holders for nearly an hour! The five hour wait really went by rather fast, and I was incredibly impressed with how awesome the folks at Franklin were in terms of tending to the needs of those in line while they patiently wait. They had chairs provided, they would come by and see if you wanted drinks, you were welcome to go in and use their facilities if you needed to, etc. They were just so awesome and friendly and really made you feel like they appreciated the effort and time you spent waiting to dine there. That made a whole lot of the experience for me right there. 11am finally hit and it was finally time to sample this highly praised and hyped BBQ. Got several pounds of fatty brisket, several pounds of ribs and some of their sausage links as well. Now, I would be lying if I didn't say there was a fair amount of skepticism walking into Franklin. I am a hardcore foodie, and when people lay claims like something is \\"the best\\", it better be REALLY REALLY amazing for me to concur. But, I am happy to say that Franklin's was, for lack of a better word, mind-blowing...utterly and ridiculously mind-blowing. I have never in my life had BBQ like the one I sampled there. It was sublime, heavenly, transcendent, almost not of this world. I had no idea brisket could be made to be that tender, moist and absolutely falling apart. The ribs were unbelievable as well, and the sausage was fantastic too. Granted our eyes were much larger than our stomachs and we definitely had to take some to go, but we gorged on ridiculous quantities of heavenly protein. It absolutely, positively lived up to the claims and the trip and the five hour wait was most definitely worth it. Would I wait again??? Absolutely!! The food is incredible, the people there are fantastic, it's just an amazing place. I was even more impressed when one of the managers flagged me down and let me know I had been accidentally overcharged for my to-go brisket and made sure to refund me the money. I didn't even realize this had happened, he came and informed me. Again, super impressed with the awesome staff there!! They were simply amazing!! So to anyone who is wondering if the wait is worth it, or if Franklin's is purely all hype...I can assure you it is NOT hype and is just about the most wonderful BBQ you can get. We did try other amazing BBQ while in Austin, but Franklin's truly stood alone. Aaron...you are a genius!

I was impressed by the small wall mirror which is also set in part of a barrel. There were 2-3 more occupied tables, and the server was very attentive. \\n\\nWe ordered a flight and a couple glasses of wine. The server was well-informed and helped us come to a decision about what to order by asking us about our likes and taste. The glasses are slightly pricey, with an average of ~$14 per glass, but they are all made by local wine makers on the premises and are worth it. \\n\\nThe food menu was surprisingly expansive and we ordered the brussel sprouts salad and the roasted cauliflower. The salad was excellent, but could have been slightly less tangy. The cauliflower dish was my favorite. It has a strong garlic flavor and I would not recommend it for those with delicate palettes. \\n\\nThis place is great for a small group of friends but also have the coziness for a romantic date.

It is (was) my absolute favorite drink in all the universe.  Bring a razor.  It will put hair on your chest.  It's a dirty martini made with pepperocini juice instead of olive juice, and a pepperocini floater.  It was my favorite drink to start the night on a cold winter day, or perfect to unwind for happy hour drinks after a long day.\\n\\nMy equally obsessed hot and dirty martini friend and I were at Sonsie this past weekend.  What we got was shinanigans.  There was a cucumber, an olive, and a pepperocini in my martini.  It had a funky flavor, which we decided may have been cucumber juice.  When we asked the bartender what this world was coming to, he said they now now use a different type of pepperocini juice in their martinis, but can make us some \\"the old way,\\" which he did.  We can breathe again.  Somehow, I doubt you have TWO types of pepperocini juice behind the bar, you fool. The first one had no heat to it at all.  The crazy cornucopia of greens you put in your new hot and dirty is going to turn me into a cranky old, picky martini drinker, who now needs to ask for the old-school hot and dirties you made 2010 and before.\\n\\nDo yourself (okay, me) a favor, Sonsie.

Finally my sandwich arrived. I was famished, but was having a hard time swallowing my food without a beverage and had to get up and go to the bar to ask for my wine and some water. The waiter was apologetic and I give him props for that, but when these things happen I guess I expect to be compensated with \\"free dessert\\" or another free glass of wine.

It's in an old house in the heart of midtown. The menu is an avalanche of upscale soul food. The drinks flow, but not so much so to upturn southern sensibility.\\n\\nI've been going to the midtown location for several years and the consistency has been impressive - especially considering the quality.\\n\\nI'll cut to the chase: The crab hash is a must-try. It's so rich and under-flavors layer within bolder ones. It's a hearty portion so bring your appetite and don't fill up on tasty cornbread. Despite being a crab dish, you can pair this dish with a respectable cocktail. No spritzer necessary.\\n\\nSpeaking of crab, I had the shecrab soup upon my last visit and was delighted. It too was rich, but it was tangy - boarding on spicy - just the way shecrab should be. If I had to pick on it at all, I might suggest a little less flour/thickener in the mix. As it cooled, it got very, very thick; but that didn't stop me from all-but-licking the bowl clean.\\n\\nI had a Thai wheat beer with it that was one of the best beers I've tried this year!\\n\\nI try to make it to SCK when I'm in the midtown area, but I'll confess - it's a totally social environment.

It can be hard to get in at times, especially on weekends of course.\\n\\nI suppose I should note the service too. They're definitely good, but I wouldn't put them in an elite category.

We came in last Saturday around 11:30 a.m. We made reservations via opentable just the night before.\\n\\nBen G had touted its SouthWestern influences and recession specials. He said you had to ask for that special menu. Well, they gave it to us along with the regular menu when we were seated.\\n\\nFrankly, I don't enjoy SouthWestern food but the gay boyfriend was all about it. The thing that convinced me was the pursuit of a good Bloody Mary.\\n\\nMasa's jalepeno bloody ($7.50) was pretty nifty. I just wish it was double the amount. The cost of it was nearly the cost of breakfast! \\n\\nService was really lackadaisical. After being seated for almost 15 minutes, she finally came around and filled our waters. I thought she was a food runner at first since she didn't introduce herself but then later took our orders. I watched her give the same treatment to the table next to us but then give stellar service to the table on the other side of us. Very odd. \\n\\nAfter she cleared my first course, she took my silverware but didn't return with a new knife. I had to ask for one and then she told me it was hot to the touch. Damnit! It was burning hot! Where they did they get this from? The forge?\\n\\nSo, what's this recession special all about? You get two items for $7.95 plus coffee or tea. Your first course is a choice of platain empanada, yogurt with fresh fruit and dulce de leche or a bowl of plain fruit. I opted for the empanada. It was mushy and not exactly appealing.\\n\\nThen you had a choice of a short list of items, some of which were higher priced on the regular menu. Noting that the short ribs weren't available on this special menu, I opted to get the creamy soft scrambled eggs with chorizo. If I was more of an egg person, I would have enjoyed this more. As it was, it was fine.\\n\\nThe gay boyfriend had the avocado eggs benedict. He loved it.

It was really bad. The salad was over-dressed, warm, and wilted, as was the salad that came with my girlfriend's meal.

Both were dry and overcooked but the beef was the worst. The sauce was OK, but this \\"meat\\" still had the whip marks from the jockey that rode it to last place. Dry, gristly and tough. It was only edible in the tiniest bites (if you could manage to cut it).\\n\\nAccompanying that were some WAY over salted cut veggies and a \\"Carribean\\" spiced rice (none that I could taste).

Yes the lines are epic but at least one of the partners comes through offering drinks for sale. The people in front of us were obviously veterans because they had brought a cooler of beer to pass the time.\\n\\nQuestion is why are the lines so long? \\nBecause only Franklin(?) is allowed to cut and serve the Q.

This creates an artificial length to the line akin to the line out in front of a club on a Friday night but when you get inside only to see it's empty. He is really nice guy and he wants to talk to every customer to create a tailored Q experience for them but the downside is it makes that wait even longer.\\n\\nSecond. The food.\\nWhat we did not like.\\nSausage. The sausage reminded us of Baloney stuffed inside a sausage casing. Probably not something to order and certainly not anything worth recommending. Thumbs down\\n\\nBrisket. On this outing they were out of fatty brisket. Unfortunately, the remaining lean brisket was very dry and flavorless. Based on what was posted on the wall I am guessing they are cooking the brisket at a hotter temperature than ideal to finish it in a shorter time. Thumbs down\\n\\nBrisket/Sausage/Cole Slaw Sandwich. The cole slaw was delicious both on this sandwich and as a side. The sausage was a loss but the chopped up brisket was better than the whole slices received separately. Thumbs down\\n\\nBeef Rib. The day we were there was there first day selling beef ribs and although neither of us like beef ribs these were delicious. Thumbs up\\n\\nSauces. We felt the sauces were very primary in flavor and missing the layers of flavor we like to see in great Q sauces.

I've lost almost all respect for BISq after what we were served today.\\n\\nHere are the six courses:\\n1) Lettuce, fennel, and cucumber salad with fried quinoa and an olive oil and lemon vinaigrette. Fried quinoa is an interesting choice for added texture in the salad, but other than that there's nothing special. Perhaps if the fennel were chunked instead of thinly sliced, the flavour pay off would've been much stronger. Salad was not mixed well, parts of it were super acidic and salty.\\n\\n2) Blue fish cheeks with broccoli, broccoli rabe, and kohlrabi. Only dish in the tasting menu worth having. I like that they're reinventing a kind of old-fashioned and ignored cut of the fish. Decadent but well balanced.\\n\\n3) Grilled cheese with homemade tomato jam. Please don't serve grilled cheeses in a tasting menu if you're not gonna blow it out of the water. The jam tastes like tomato paste mixed with over-ripe tomatoes suffocated in a sugary syrup. \\n\\n4) Pork belly with hominy and radish, served in the world's blandest soup possible. Interesting in concept but completely wrecked the execution. It's a tortilla soup but worse. For good tortilla soup please visit Felipe's. Pork belly was cooked well. Radishes were a joke, they straight up chopped it in half, raw, and it was like eating tin. The dollops of cream was the only saving grace in this soup base. Did you just use a vegetable bouillon cube?  \\n\\n5) Boneless skinless fried chicken brined in buttermilk, served with a homemade ranch dip. This was disgusting. Overly breaded, they managed to get the chicken to be extremely dry and slimy at the same time, particularly between the muscle and fat. Breading was under-seasoned. \\n\\n6) Grilled pound cake with cream, honey, and fig. Betty crocker grilled (burnt)? Four stingy slices of fig? \\n\\nThey do have a great beer and wine menu, and I still very much enjoyed the ambiance. We sat by the kitchen and to be quite frank it did not look like the chefs enjoy their work. \\n\\nIf you're going to treat your groupon diners like second-class citizens, just don't offer vouchers.

Ramen joints in Japan were like my food trucks and Roppolo's on heavy drinking nights and cold nights. I've also had ramen in pretty much every part of Japan from Hokkaido, Kyoto, Kyushu, etc. so I am a bit of a snob when it comes to ramen. We all know about the severe lack of ramen availability in Texas and I finally got to try this place this past weekend when I was visiting from Houston. We got there at 4:30 and we were about 7th in line.\\n\\nUnless you are a part of 3 or more, you will be sitting in a long table sharing the space with strangers. This is also true for Joe's Shanghai in New York so I'm used to it but if you are not, then it might take a bit to get used to. \\n\\nThe best part of the meal was the katsu slider. I loved that the katsu was juicy and hot, and the red cabbage gave it nice texture and the balance of the sweet bun was great. Sliders aren't really authentic per say but it was delicious so who cares? \\n\\nThen came the ramen. I think my Mckayla Maroney face came out - I was not super impressed. I ordered the #1 for the boyfriend and #3 miso not so hot with extra menma bamboo shoots for myself. #1 was way better but again, not a home run. The broth is ok - it's thick, creamy, and overall balanced but lacks another dimension - more pork flavor please? The cut of the meat was not \\"melt in your mouth\\" pork belly that I miss so much but they are generous by serving four fatty pieces because most places in Houston only give you ONE OR TWO. The noodles are thinner but it was perfectly cooked so it did not bother me at all. One great thing was the soft boiled egg - this was done to perfection.  At the end I was regretting my decision to order the #3 - it comes with ground pork and cabbage. I ordered it to try something different but I didn't like the combination of those two ingredients. I think if I order again, I would do the tonkotsu hot and try the corn and butter bomb. \\n\\nI think this is a solid 3.5 star effort but I'm rounding it up to 4 because there's not a better alternative within a 500 mile radius of this place. If this place opens up in Houston it will get a nice following as well. I would visit again, but I just wouldn't run to it.

We appreciated his honesty, but we could also sense that he just really wasn't jazzed by the food served here. Our second option--some pasta with artichokes and capers--they were all out of. We settled for some pricy raviolini. (Ravi-what? Yeah, they're just ravioli--our waiter told us.) \\n\\nWines were ho-hum and the waiter brought us our check before asking if we wanted any dessert.

This place is sadly not an exception. I got smoked and fried chicken legs, fried catfish, collard greens, mashed potatoes, and cornbread. The portions were large and well worth the money, I got three dinners for less than thirty bucks. The chicken legs tasted like hot dogs (a side effect of the smoking, I imagine) and had an odd, too smooth texture. Their breading tasted like shake 'n bake and also one of the three legs was raw. Whoops. Collards were well cooked, an extremely generous portion, and had visible bits of smoked turkey. The seasoning was way off though, oddly tomato-y for some reason. Mashed potatoes were lovely if too smooth (that's a personal preference). Fried catfish was truly unfortunate. I'm not sure if it was the cut of fish they used or what but there were a lot of disconcerting chunks of what I can only describe as fish slime, so much that the breading had trouble sticking to the fish in places and slid off in unappetizingly moist chunks. The dijon flavored tartar sauce that came with the fish was bomb tho. I wish you could order that by itself and get proper fried fish somewhere else. Cornbread was meh. There were too chewy chunks of corn in there - which - points for using recognizable ingredients but it made enjoying the texture of the bread an issue.

We arrived at 11am and waited for an hour to get our table.  Everything on the menu was tempting! When I read it, I wanted to order multiple dishes just for myself. However, by the time I looked around and saw how big the general food portion was, I immediately turned my idea down. That's why it was extremely tough for us to pick the following dishes out of the menu:\\n\\nCornbread with Cr√®me Fraiche (side)\\nGiven that we had been starving for more than 3 hours, we cleared the cornbread in 5 minutes. The soft cr√®me was a great complement with the cornbread. The side syrup was really amazing too! I recommend saving the rest of it for the chicken waffle.\\n\\nChicken Waffle, $14\\nHere is nuclear bomb!!! It tastes soooooooo good!!! It is Screen Door's signature dish and almost every table ordered one. There are three gigantic pieces of buttermilk battered fried chicken on top of the sweet potato waffle. For every bite, I tasted the special seasoning in the chicken and how crunchy it was, not to mention the waffle and the maple syrup. Don't forget the cornbread syrup! Dipping it with the chicken waffle simply took my soul to another level!\\n\\nJared's Croque Madame, $12\\nFour words to describe it: The Best Sandwich Ever! Ham, poached eggs, and sourdough. Each ingredient just did their job right! The raw egg yolk softened the toasted sourdough, the ham added flavor to the sandwich; the mustard mornay sauce made the entire thing stand out! The mustard was the most amazing thing here. It totally surprised me!   \\n\\nRed Velvet Chocolate Pancake\\nEr...that stack of dark red pancakes didn't look as attractive as other dishes we had had. But my perspective changed once I started eating. I could smell the light red velvet flavor. When I chewed it, I tasted the chocolate chips! The cocoa sensation came out in the moment! ROAR!\\n\\n\\nScreen Door totally blew my mind. Excellent food in big portion at reasonable price - what else do you want?  The chicken waffle was just $14 but the satisfaction was worth more!

It was a few days after Christmas and just before New Years. Route 114 was bumper to bumper traffic, absolutely horrible and yes, worse than it usually is. She lives in Middleton and it took her close to 45 minutes to get there and it is usually only a ten to fifteen minute ride. \\n\\nOkay, so she calls in the order and goes to pick them up. She arrives at the Century House and was told by one gal that they were NOT ACCEPTING take out orders that night. Well, my friend looked at her like she had two heads because she told the gal that she placed the order more than 45 minutes ago. I think this made the lady working there quite angry. So after conversation, the lady told her she would put the order in... which should of been done at least an hour ago. \\n\\nSo my friend goes out to her car to wait for awhile while this meal was allegedly being prepared for take-out. After twenty minutes or more, she goes inside and still there is nothing for her. One other employee told her she would run the order out to her when it was ready.... and she kept her word and did just that. My friend did give her a nice tip for being so courteous. The employee knew where to go because my friend told her that her car was right up front and she would be looking for her. \\n\\nFinally after another 45 minute drive home, she arrives with the food. Now remember, she was gone for close to three hours.\\n\\nShe opens the bag and we were like... \\"WHERE IS THE REST OF THE DINNERS\\"? WHAT A DISGRACE AND EMBARRASSMENT TO SAY THE LEAST. \\nYUCK! YUCK! YUCK!\\n\\nThe prime rib was okay but not like we were used to getting at the Century House. The fries were ice cold and sort of on the greasy side. One dinky little salad was enclosed and one little dinner roll... not a pecan roll. NOTHING. \\n\\nThe two rubber chicken dinners were cold and did not taste right. We both got the mashed potatoes. One dinner had cauliflower and the other should of had green beans but guess what, there was NOTHING THERE. Who seals a dinner with one of the tinfoil sections completely empty and allows it out the door? Neither of the chicken dinners got their salads and there was one dinner roll between the both of them. DISASTROUS! \\n\\nWell, it was cold, traffic was at a standstill, the gal at the Century House had an attitude that night, and everyone was starving. The last thing we wanted to do is call them and complain. So we gobbled up the morsels that we did get for about $75.00 and that was that.... plus the tip so now we are up around the $85.00 mark. None of us are big eaters but we ended up calling the Middleton House of Pizza for a pizza because the Century House gave us a totally despicable meal, to say the least. \\n\\nLast night on Saturday evening, January 4th I called the Century House and asked for the manager. The woman on the other end said she was the manager and I am afraid that I failed to get her name. I explained the entire situation for her and all she could say was  \\"Oh gee, I'm sorry\\". Then she added \\"next time, go through the meal and make sure everything is there\\". I thought to myself, is she on the same page as me? Why would I take possession of my dinners, tear the bags apart in the middle of the waiting area, and start counting meals? Hello, get real lady! \\n\\nI was so shocked at her careless attitude that I mentioned... if every patron did that then they lack confidence in themselves and they are certainly incompetent to be working there. I was just blown away with her answers. Extremely unprofessional.\\n\\nNow, this lady said she remembered that night but we should of called right away and we should never had waited a few days. Well guess what, New Years was upon us and a two - three day blizzard was too. Sorry, but calling for two salads (rabbit food), the missing vegetables, and rolls were not on my mind at that time. \\n\\nThe Epicurean Shoppe is frequented by me, my friends, and family all the time. For years and years now, we have also eaten at the restaurant too. I mentioned to the woman that I think she should make good to my friend for a disastrous night but she was adamant about parting with a penny. A very cold woman indeed and obviously doesn't have much of a heart. If she had common sense or was a professional business woman, she would of asked for my friends name and address and mailed her out a gift certificate immediately, if not sooner.\\n\\nBottom line: THE NIGHT WAS RUINED and my friend was out over $100.00 because she also paid for the pizza too.

I've been for lunch a couple of times and had good luck with the food and service.  Our waiter got quite snippy when asked to bring something.  A request for a second glass of wine raised his ire so we didn't ask for anything else.  Which meant that we had to make do with our one glass of water/iced tea/Coke, etc.  The salads came in a reasonable time (more discussion later about the salads) but our entrees took WAY too long.  Other tables were getting their entrees even though they arrived after we did (guess their waiter liked them better).  The garlic bread was average.  \\n\\nI felt that the price for dinner was expensive.  We each had a salad which added $5-$6 to each person's meal.  Add that to the price of the entrees and you're up to $20 a person (or more).  Our bill ended up being around $78.00, well over $90 with the tip, for the three of us; good thing I didn't have that third glass of wine!\\n\\nWe all ended up with varying degrees of nausea.  Mine started right away and lasted through the next day.  One of my sons was very sick early the next morning (many trips to the bathroom) while the other was sick enough to stay in bed most of the following day.  The only food that we all ate was the salad so I have to assume that it was what caused the stomach ailments.  We each had different entrees. \\n\\nThis wasn't a good experience.

After stewing over the menu for awhile (part of this was so any options, part of it was a nice afternoon sitting on the patio), we decided to start with the Pimento Cheese Fritters - they come with bacon and pepper jam.  Being a founding member of the Fritter Fan Club (it's a Yelper thing), I just knew I had to dig into these.  They were crispy on the outside and melty and creamy on the inside.  How do these places make these fritters so perfectly round, anyway?\\n\\nNext onto the main dish - I chose the french dip (mostly from other Yelper reviews).  It consists of roast beef, caramelized onions, Swiss cheese, and a truffle mayo plus au-jus on the side.  To be fair, there was not enough seasoning on the beef - it was flat and not super beefy. And I could not tell you there was truffle mayo on this sandwich.  I was disappointed in this.  I did enjoy the sweet potato fries, though.\\n\\nMy cousin and I sat and enjoyed the patio for a couple of hours and the waitstaff kept our drink glasses filled for the most part.  Our waiter, Matt, disappeared at some point, so my guess was he took a break or something.  Luckily some other guy took over.

Loud colors and loud people. In my opinion this make for a great, fun, place to sit, drink and talk with your friends. Not everyone in our party had showed up yet so we hung out at the bar and chatted. Then we decided to try to get a table, even though they have a rule against seating people until everyone is there. They sat us anyway. \\n\\nWe sat down and the chips and salsa came almost immediately. The chips were warm and incredibly addicting. The salsa was chunky and yummy. Most of us ordered margaritas and they were cheap and huge. I got a frozen melon one and it did not taste anything like melon, but it did however taste like tequila... so I was OK with this. \\n\\nWe ordered our mains and I had ordered chili relleno which I had been told by a VERY trust worthy source is amazing. I made sure to ask if the rice was Vegetarian and it was. This is very exciting, as a lot Mexican places use pork fat in their rice. About 5 mins after ordering our mains the server came back and to tell me that they had run out of chili relleno. So I quickly looked at the menu (because I hadn't thought of a back up) and I ordered the vegi jambalaya. I was not a big fan. It was a little too spicy for my taste and it REALLY needed cheese, but this was most likely their vegan selection.  The veggies in it were great though. There were zucchini, mushrooms, peppers, and onions. I brought home most of it so I could put the cheese on myself. The corn bread that they serve with it was so good. The corn bread almost made up for the lack of cheese. Everyone at our table loved their food. There was 6 of us and we got everything from Quesadillas to salad. One friend's meal came with fries. They honestly tasted little like the potato sticks I used to eat as a child that came out of a can. Not really what I'm looking for in fries. Another friend got the mesquite salmon salad.

The McGregor's Garden combines bourbon and parsnip puree with lemon and (I think) simple syrup...a really nice concoction. The Krakatoa, a whiskey and smoked orange drink, is a fine cocktail and shows off quite cleary A&H's penchant for smoky flavors. The only near miss was a cask cocktail, the Plaza Hotel, which brings together three of my favorite liquors - bourbon, Lillet, and Campari - in a way that, while not unpleasant, didn't really jibe.\\n\\nOn to snacks: the pickled green beans are a fun change of pace from bread and aren't so pickley as to distract from the food. Smoked cashews with currants and rosemary were addictive. It's nice to see currants on an American menu, and the ingredients came together in a trail-mixey kind of way. Crisp potatoes with white miso, sour orange, and toasted benne seeds were just wonderful....sort of like a refined take on fries with mayo. \\n\\nPrices are competitive for this type of quality. \\n\\nMy only small complaint was that while the bar staff are knowledgeable and attentive, they feel a little bit distant.

Who would have thought that Disney world has a place for individuals to get shchwasted??! Not me!! La Cava Del Tequila is a cozy little bar that is supposed to represent Oaxaca, Mexico.  They offer MANY types of Tequlia, Mezcal, and mixed drinks such as their delicious Wild passion fruit Margarita.  It gets totally packed in here so you if your lucky enough to find a table cool, but if not you find a spot at the bar or high tables to rest your drink/app while chatting up with different amigos and consuming your Mexican heaven! There is no waiter service so you order what ever you want at the bar and than find a spot to chill.  They only offer chips and Guac, salsa, or Queso as far as food goes. Me and my friends returned to Epcot on 3 separate occasions just to come back for the strong ass Margaritas and guac with tortillas.  The Guac is so fresh.  The tortilla chips are warm and crispy.  The wild passion fruit Margarita is very sweet and loaded with tequila, but the flavors of the drink really disguise the tequila well, and take over... its sooo friggen good.  The Wild Passion fruit margarita was $12.50 and chips and guac $7.  For Disney world these are very fair and affordable prices even for those on a budget. \\n\\n\\nI learned a lot of things in here about tequila. First off there are over 1000 brands.  There are five main classifications: Blanco, Gold, Reposado, Anejo, and Extra Anejo. Silver tequila also known as Blanco is the purest type of tequila. It's clear because it isn't aged, and can be bottled right after distillation. Some Blanco products are aged for up to 2 months to provide a smoother spirit.  Next is Gold Tequila.  It's usually a mix of colorants and flavorings that have been added before bottling.  These Tequilas are less expensive and used in many bars and restaurants for mixed drinks (i.e. jose cuervo yukk!).  Gold Tequila has some exceptions where it may be the result of blending a Silver Tequila with a Reposado and/or A√±ejo Tequila, while keeping the Agave classification 100%. Tequila Reposado is kind of goldish in color, and must be aged more than two months but less than a year.  Agave and wood flavors are tasted in this type since it is stored in wood barrels for aging. Anejo (extra aged) type of Tequila must be aged for at least one year.  Its hue is usually Amber. Lastly the most expensive type of Tequila: Extra Anejo (Ultra Aged) means it must be aged at least 3+ years.  This is a newer category.  The color is darkest and has a Mahogany hue.\\n\\nNow that you got a lesson and a review all in one I URGE you to trek your ass to Disney World, hit up Epcot, walk allll the way to mexico... up the steps and inside the San Angel inn, make your way through the indoor night sky, down the steps and around the fountain....keep going...NOW DRINK and beeeeeeee Merry!!!"},{"name":"Tasty Burger","address":"1301 Boylston St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"Wow, let me tell a story about this place!

The burgers are tasty (not the best though) and I enjoy the old fashioned process of walking up to a burger stand to order. The Fenway vibe is also pretty hip. \\n\\nThe reason I'm giving them 2-3 stars though is because I have a wheat allergy, meaning I can't eat gluten (a protein found in wheat), and someone gave me the wrong bun. I know some people in the service industry don't always take gluten free requests seriously because eating gluten free has become somewhat of a fad lately. But the real reason gluten free options exist is because there are people who do get seriously sick from ingesting this protein. \\n\\nThe first two times I went here, I ordered a gluten free bun and felt totally fine. There was no mix up or cross-contamination. The crappy thing about a food allergy is that you really have to trust the people who prepare your food and trust that they'll get your request right.  \\n\\nRecently however, I ordered a burger to go with a gluten free bun. When I got home, I took a bite of the burger and noticed something a bit different. The bun was a completely different bun than the one I got a day ago. The texture was very different. I had already swallowed a bite before I decided to be safe and remove the rest of the bun from my burger and consume just the paddy. Needless to say, afterwards I got an allergy attack that lasted all night long. \\n\\nI will continue to eat here, but I'm going to have to be extra vigilant about ordering and making sure my order is gluten free.

YES it's that good.\\n\\nYou absolutely want to get here on weekends before noon. Definitely head straight for the third floor. Beat the crowd, get the freshest dim sum. I will admit I haven't tried every single possible dish that goes around on the dim sum carts, but the standard dim sum fare, dumplings, shaomai, pork buns, those sticky rice buns, taro dumplings, sesame balls, egg custards, all that kind of stuff, is ridiculously tasty, especially considering how cheap the dim sum brunch is. a working knowledge of cantonese isn't necessary, since the waitstaff is accustomed to the classic western method of ordering, \\"pointing at what you want to eat,\\" but if you plan on being adventurous with the more esoteric items on the carts, knowing what exactly you're eating is probably a plus.\\n\\nBut seriously, the dim sum is amazing.

I assume Jake's does this to avoid the crabmeat getting dried out in the cooking process, but it was too much. The taste of cream cheese overwhelmed the crab and salmon taste, and the dish as a whole suffered. At $41 for the halibut and $38 for the salmon, I was extremely disappointed. Perhaps we made the mistake of not focusing on the restaurant's strength, which are apparently crawfish and oysters/shrimp, but while the crawfish appetizer was good, it does not make a meal, and the fish dishes were so poor compared to my expectations.

Aaron chatted with us while he sliced up some very generous portions of meat.  \\n\\nEverything was delicious, tender, and well seasoned!  I loved the pulled pork, and the fatty part of the brisket.  The sides were all good too.  I especially liked the cole slaw.  They had some mini-pies/tarts from Cake and Spoon for dessert (Banana Bourbon, Key Lime, Lemon Chess, and Blackberry I think were the four flavors today).  I got the Lemon Chess pie which was amazing - flaky crust with a perfect sweet & tart lemon buttermilk filling.  I also like that they have bottled Mexican Coke, Dublin Dr Pepper, & Big Red and a few pure cane sugar fountain sodas.  We had enough food leftover to box up another whole meal to take home with us.  \\n\\nGreat food, service, and atmosphere!

We were confused about that at first, assuming she would want the bill to be higher for a better tip, but the steak he got... SO good. She knew what she was talking about. He also added shrimp and I nearly ate every single one of them after having one bite because they were sooo delicious.

It is partially because of this that the opening of Cafe 101 brought great joy to my heart (and belly).  They are serving some fantastic casual Taiwanese fare here.  The flavorings and presentation are dead-on authentic.  Savory braised meat, sauce thick in texture but light and satisfying in flavor, street food style appetizers, the signature fried ribs.  Everything brings back fond childhood memories.  There are also some pretty wide-ranging regional Chinese dishes on the menu.  These are solid, but Taiwanese touch is seen or tasted on most dishes (not a bad thing).\\n\\nThe general decoration is tending towards a bistro theme, so a little out of place on Buford Highway, but this is a common practice these days in Asia.

I wanted to add a couple of thoughts about the experience of eating there.\\n\\nFirst, food comes out incredibly fast.\\nYes, there is a line, and the line can take upwards of 30 minutes. But the food comes out so fast, it kind of doesn't matter. On our first trip, on a slammed Saturday night around 8pm, the line was about 20 deep outside, with another 12 or so folks inside. We made our way to the counter, the staff gave us our number and our seat assignment, we ordered our food (which took a few extra minutes because we needed some things explained to us), immediately sat down and BAM! in 2 minutes, our food arrived at the table. Our total wait time was 34 minutes from park to feed. At 8pm on a Saturday. That's INCREDIBLE for ANY restaurant in Austin.\\n\\nSecond, the staff busts some serious ass.\\nOn both of our dining experiences, there was a highly unusual amount of cheerful hustle going on among the staff. It takes some coordination and hustle to get food to the table in under 5 minutes. Folks checked in on us, and everyone was super friendly. Thank you, and amazing job, Team Tatsu-Ya!\\n\\nThird, the food is great!\\nSo is it worth driving down from Dallas? (Pause. Blink. ...Seriously, what restaurant IS worth driving on I-35 for 3.5 hours? Let's not set our expectations so high, people.) We've had the gyoza, the #1 Tonkotsu Original, #2 Tonkotsu Sho-Yu, and the #3 Mi-So-Hot. All were fantastic and worth trying; you can't go wrong. If it's your first visit, start with the #1 Original. You'll have the option to add stuff. I like getting an extra egg (Ajitama eggs are medium-boiled eggs that are marinated in soy and other stuff afterwards -- delish!). You'll have the option of ordering extra noodles at your table, so don't bother with that. As far as the other stuff goes, it's totally not necessary to add more stuff because the quantity provided is quite good (we were stuffed!), but certainly do it if you are so inspired! The staff is incredibly helpful and approachable, so ask questions!\\n\\nFourth, yes they serve a full menu on Saturdays for dinner\\nAnother reviewer said they were only serving 1 dish on Saturday. That's not true -- I believe they were referring to the soft opening on their lunch service (which I'm not sure they are even doing any more), in which they were serving a limited menu.  Full and awesome dinner service starting at 5pm, Tuesday through Sunday."},{"name":"Mettle - East Austin Bistro","address":"507 Calles St","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"I found this place on Yelp and other food blogs and went here today with friends for brunch.

No menus, nothing up front where you order. I was just confused...do I order up front or sit down? After a couple minutes a guy emerged from the back and took my order up front. After paying and adding a counter service-level tip, I then realized that this is partial table-service as they bring you your drinks, not just your pizza. This is a weird tipping situation. I can honestly say I have never seen a setup like this, and I'm not really a fan given the lack of attention I got. There was no silverware or napkins brought to me.

It was pineapple rum and strawberries and other fruits. It's a frozen drink but not one of those crunchy ice drinks l, this one was more frothy and almost a smoothie texture which I liked. I personally don't like crunchy ice frozen drinks. It's very delicious and sweet but you still get a nice kick of rum at the end. My drink however took a while for me to get. I didn't receive mines till I was halfway done with my meal and I ordered it before we received any food.\\n\\nFor my meal I ordered the French toast. I've never had French toast like this before. It was basically French toast made with bread pudding bread and it was very flavorful and moist. The only gripe I had with it was there were some darker burnt parts that made it hard to enjoy. It must've been very fresh because it was so hot when they gave it to me. I had to wait a few minutes for it to cool down. I also ordered a side of back, which was your typical crispy applewood smoked bacon. \\n\\nOverall, the patio area is very nice and makes you feel like you may actually be in Mexico lol.

The chicken was possibly the best fried chicken I've had at a sit-down restaurant, ribs were so tender and flavorful, those two plates alone are worth another visit. Mac and cheese was a disappointment. It wasn't terrible, just very mediocre compared to the other plates. Onion dip was a great starter. \\n\\nDrinks were delicious with a great selection of beers, however, both are on the pricier side.

Don't get me wrong, this place has some good bbq, but it's not worth the 3.5 hour wait that it took for my friends and I to finally place our order and sit down to enjoy the food. What's even crazier is that 3.5 hours to wait for bbq is considered to be a rather short wait time compared to how long others have waited in line at Franklin's.\\n\\nMaybe people are drawn to Franklin barbecue because it's been featured on cooking shows and in barbecue magazines, or maybe because it's the thing to do when you visit from out of town. Whatever it may be, I just don't understand the craze. \\n\\nI was in Austin for my gf's bachelorette party, and we Ubered and lyfted everywhere since we decided not to rent a car. After speaking with all of the drivers we encountered on our trip, it seems like locals don't go to Franklin barbecue because they don't see a point in waiting in those crazy lines, especially since there's \\"plenty of good barbecue to be found in Austin.\\" When I try new places, especially if I'm in a new city, I want to go to all of the spots that locals like to frequent. \\n\\nWith that said, let's get to the food. My girlfriends and I ordered 2 lbs of brisket (half fatty, half lean), 1/2 lb of pork ribs, 1/2 lb of sausage, and potato salad. The brisket was juicy, but overly salted in my personal opinion. The pork ribs were flavorful but kind of dry, and the sausage was good and had a nice heat to it. The potato salad was nothing special, but it did compliment all of the smokey meats well. \\n\\nOverall, I give this place a 3.5 stars.

It was 2.90$ Then for appies we had 2 different gyoza; one was ebi with a whole shrimp in the gyoza dough and the second the traditional pork. Both were extremely fresh and very tasty for 4.90$ Sam then had sizzling beef teriyaki with side of sticky rice 7.50$ which she said was great.\\nMike, her boyfriend had 4 different rolls, spicy tuna and 3 others, all fresh and very good. I can't get into the whole raw fish thing, not that I have anything against it I just can't get past it. So I had the beef teriyaki roll and the traditional california.

We've dined at this location before and my kids asked for this restaurant as their reward for getting good grades.  This visit would barely get one star from me if that was possible.  The hostess was great-very responsive and friendly.  We were seated within a minute or two of checking in.  The menus were pretty worn and sticky.  Our server took a few minutes to swing by the table for drink orders but that's not a huge deal.  My daughter and I went to the ladies room to wash our hands before our food arrived and it was nearly enough to make me walk out the door.  It was so filthy and the odor was so strong that I thought I might get physically ill.  We quickly washed our hands and went back to our table.  Unfortunately, while we were in the ladies room, my husband had to take my son to the men's restroom.  While we were both away from our table they cleared our (full) drink cups and set the table for the next guests!  It took our server at least 5 minutes to come back to the table so we could tell her what happened.  Then it took her another at least 5 minutes to replace our drinks.  We already had our appetizer by the time she got to the table with the replacement drinks.  Overall the food was on par but nothing remarkable.  We allowed our kids to order one of the fancy shakes but it took almost a half hour to get them to our table and they were nothing like the picture on the menu.  We went back to the restroom to wash after our meal and the ladies room was even worse than previous (hard to believe!).

Flavorful, well balanced, not over-cooked, fresh, with 3-4 veggies in the mix.  Also, they should not be stingy or neglectful when it comes to providing the proper accoutrements.

My daughter had the ribs, the star of the meal. Juicy, fleshy, not mushy. Perfectly cooked. The sides were excellent: sweet collard greens, fresh-baked corn bread and smoky beans. The mac n cheese was excellent. The potato salad and coleslaw were also very good. It all comes on a pizza tray with a red and white checked paper covering. The portions were on the small side, but that's just because Americans are used to being served giant meals.

I confess I may have walked in with some misguided image in my head of an elevated, fancy-foodie take on a Cuban sandwich. I wasn't disappointed so much as set straight by the simple unpretentiousness - I imagine this is what a quick lunch in Havana might taste like. \\n\\nI have an idea what pub grub might taste like in Havana as well, based on the Medianoche (Midnight) sandwich. It's like the Cuban but served on semi-sweet bread, and is a popular late-night bar snack according to ye olde Wikipedia. We also tried both Beef and Chicken Empanadas, which were simple, straight-up, and straight out of the hot oil. Delicious.\\n\\nWhat the name of the place or the menu won't tell you, but one look will, is that it's as much a bakery as anything else. Aside from the obviously fresh bread on the sandwiches, there are lots of baked goods displayed in bins and racks. I'm not a fan of panaderia-style sweets, and the rum-soaked pound cake we shared for dessert proved no exception. The sweet rum sauce and the eggy cake just didn't work for us, but chalk it up as a matter of preference.\\n\\nWe started planning our next visit the moment we sat down. There's more on the menu than you could ever hope to try in one visit: Ropa Vieja, Lechon, Cuban-style hamburgers and even vegetarian fare, not to mention Batidos smoothies and all the baked goods. You'll almost certainly run out of appetite before you run out of money - everything is very reasonably priced.\\n\\nThe limited number of Yelp reviews here indicate this place hasn't gotten the attention it deserves. You should take it upon yourself to do something about that - and I'll bet you a Corqueta de Jamon you won't regret it.

The host was very nice as we did not make reservations and was great with keeping us posted on how long the wait would be while we had a drink at the bar.  The bar crowd was friendly and eager to learn what everyone else was drinking and sharing the rave reviews - especially with the tiki drinks.  Our waitress was so sweet and nice and I have to say - the first time I remembered a waitress' name and called her over whenever we needed something and she was fantastic.  Upon realizing we were newly engaged and celebrating, we were toasted and brought a dessert.  The new general manager even came over and made us feel special.  I can't remember the last time I felt like people went out of their way in a restaurant setting to help you celebrate (birthday, anniversary, etc.)   We were blown away by the sweet personalities, true customer service and how we truly felt like we were with neighborhood friends.

Bar-B-Q","address":"1238 Dekalb Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4.5","text":"Fox Bros BBQ can be inconsistent, but I absolutely love the chopped brisket and Brunswick stew here, so much so that I crave them regularly.  The meats have a nice smoke ring, smoky flavor, and the chopped brisket retains great amount of fatty bits.  I don't like to get brisket sliced, but know that they slice with the grain rather than across, so they are not as tender as could be.  Ribs are dry-rubbed and okay, as are pulled pork.  Sometimes they tend to be a bit dry and you say that's inconsistent because you remember how good they were.  Overall the meats are not overly greasy like Fat Matt's.  There is one sauce on the table, tomato based and fairly mild, just a little tangy and sweet, really easy to eat if lacking punch.  I don't remember how the chicken was.  Sometimes they have short rib that's been smoking for like 20 hours, but I've not had it.\\n\\nBrunswick stew is my favorite in Atlanta.  I can eat this stuff all day.  The consistency is slightly soupy, but viscous instead of thin.  It's not too spicy nor chunky, has a great savoriness, and full of the delicious brisket.  Mmm, so good.  The tomminator appetizer is tater tots smothered with this godly stew, and as expected I am a big fan of it.  They also smother fries and such with either this or chili--I guess smothering shit over stuff is a Texas thing?--but I favor the tomminator.\\n\\nMost of the sides are decent but not amazing.  Mac n' Cheese very bland for my taste.  Beans, potato salad, slaw range from average to good.  Toast is nothing special.  They always have Magic Hat on tap if you like that.  The inside of this place is not so big, and there's a bar that seats like, three, but the patio is fairly accommodating.  \\n\\nNow I want some Brunswick stew!"},{"name":"Magnificent Muffin & Bagel Shoppe","address":"1118 Broadway","city":"Somerville","stars":"4","text":"Best coffee around!!

When we finally got to the front, there was plenty of both, but the smoked turkey was gone. We ordered brisket, ribs and sausage, brought it back, and 8 of us mauled it down like angry wolves. Wolves are not used to waiting.  \\n\\nBrisket and ribs were A+ quality. So tender I could cut the meat by looking at it with my angry-wolf eyes. The rub on the ribs was a perfect complement. It's unique and it works. The brisket... could... not... stop... eating. So much so that I was a vegetarian until the following Tuesday. The sausage had a bite to it, with snappy casings to hold in its juiciness.\\n\\nBottom line: if you're in Austin for a day or two, see the town, do your thing, you can get good 'cue elsewhere. But if you're there a few days or a week, or if your college is as awesome as my college and happens to be ballin', get in line and do it. You'll be party to the legend, and you won't regret it."},{"name":"Alden & Harlow","address":"40 Brattle St","city":"Cambridge","stars":"4","text":"Great atmosphere and unique menu.

Pigs.\\n\\nThe concept of Bao Down is easier to explain with pictures. If you've seen that type of bun before, you'll know it immediately. If not, you'll probably be pleasantly surprised.\\n\\nPrice is... pricey if you look at the steamed bao individually. Your experience will be better if you commit to a meal.\\nHuh? Okay, let me explain.\\nWith each steamed bao you are getting basically half the amount of bread and a third the amount of filling of a burger, at about half the price of a gourmet burger. You could also compare it to tacos, in which case one of these bao is priced at about two to three times the price of a soft-shelled taco, with the same amount of filling but more carbs (bread / bun). Either way, price for what you get looks bleak when you consider the bun-to-filling ratio. The minimum order is two bao, so lunch / brunch will set you back $10+ for sure (or you could bring a friend).\\nBut you'd have to be a light eater to be satisfied with just 1-2 steamed bao, so expect to actually spend $15-$20+ for a proper meal of 3-4 of them. When that happens however, you will feel better because you'll be stuffed from the bread (bao). Then tasty + interesting + FILLING = great pricing. It's magic!\\n\\nIf you actually want a lighter meal, there is the gluten-free option of swapping out your bao / bun with lettuce instead (like having your burger fillings in lettuce instead of a regular bread bun).\\nEither way, don't wait too long before eating your bao once it comes out of the kitchen -- the steamed bun tends to get sticky on the outside and stick to the paper dishes. And lettuce wraps tend to leak (just saying).\\n\\nBao Chicka Bao Bao ($6) Fried lemongrass and garlic marinated free range Fraser Valley chicken breast, crispy garlic, palm sugar & fish sauce glaze, fresh cilantro, garlic scape mayo, pickled carrots and scallions.\\n- What I mostly tasted here was something sweet. Whatever nuances of lemongrass, garlic mayo, etcetera was mostly lost on me. Still, pretty tasty.\\n- Nicely fried slab of chicken, but smallish looking. Size of one of those chicken wings you get at a chicken wings place, but obviously with no bone.\\n\\nJaws ($5) Coconut crusted Ocean Wise Vietnamese catfish, kimchi tartar sauce, Food Pedalers microgreens & cabbage in a Thai vinaigrette.\\n- \\"Vietnamese catfish\\" is basa. It sounds sexier to say \\"Vietnamese catfish\\", though.\\n- Overall this tasted better than the chicken one as I actually had the taste and experience of the catfish, which was very nicely fried and still juicy.\\n\\nKimchi Fries ($4.50 small, $8 large) House made double-fried kennebec potato fries, crispy pork belly, sweet soy, crispy garlic, bean sprouts, garlic scape mayo and scallions\\n- We were there right when they opened, and the crispy pork belly here was... old? Meat was definitely drier and tougher than expected. Thin layer of crispy fat but hardly any soft fat.\\n- There was definitely some spicy kimchi here, but I think everything else piled onto these fries (sweet soy?!) was overkill and kinda ruined it.\\n- If you like interesting poutines, this is it.\\n\\nSoup of the Day: Hainanese Chicken Soup ($5?)\\n- Tasted like chicken soup with way too much stuff in it (tons of bean sprouts).\\nObviously won't be just broth or broth with some chicken (which may have made people think \\"rip off\\"). But it also doesn't make you think Hainanese chicken.\\n\\nOverall the steamed bao are nicely composed and tasty, but individually they are priced for tourists in Gastown. I can see how the pricing would be easier to handle if they were a food cart where prices are generally higher to begin with and eats are \\"to-go\\" casual.\\n\\nFor now, stick with the steamed bao or realize that you are taking your chances if you order anything other than what they specialize in (bao). If I had only tried the fries or the soup, they'd be busted down to 2-3 stars.\\n\\nAside: A friend who was at Eat! Vancouver 2015 claims that they were about 25% bigger during/ Eat!

I googled: \\"Average tip American resturants\\", and discovered from neutral sites most people leave 15% pre-tax for \\"normal, routine service\\". A 25% tip is left less than 1% of the time in American restaurants.  I find this practice deceitful, dishonest and highly offensive. I don't need anyone to \\"suggest\\" a minimum tip to me.

The bartender came back with our drinks and recommended the $10. tapas plate so we ordered 2 plates and a round of drinks, the drinks were great and served fast, but the tapas were a horrific they were disgusting at best, If I had to describe it i would say they went out into the alley in the back and picked crap out of the dumpster and placed it on the plate. they did arrange it so It looked nice and when they brought the two platters over we said OH great lets order a third because these looked so good!

But the ladyfriend brought up Soul Fire... and am I glad she did.\\n\\nLocated on Harvard Ave, and balls deep in Allston Village, this place is a breath of fresh air into the lungs of diners looking for somethign other than your typical pub-fare or fill-in-the-blank-with-an-asian-country cuisine.\\n\\nBBQ is the type of food that I almost never buy, yet absolutely love when someone makes it for me and hands it to me on a plate.  Sushi is also the same deal.  You just learned a few interesting tidbits about me... congrats.  \\n\\nSo anyway, when perusing the menu, I had to go with the pulled pork sammich.  I also got a side of mac and cheese, and a side of potato salad.  I couldn't help maself.  Then we also got a side of cornbread as an appetizer... WHEN IN ROME!!!\\n\\nThe cornbread was good, the pulled pork amazing, the mac and cheese amazing, and the potato salad was 'meh.'  Roommate #1 got some mashed potatoes which were the bomb, and my better half got some baked beans which were also mighty good.\\n\\nOur waitress was dope and laid-back.  She didn't mind splitting our bill between the 4 of us or handling 4 different cards.  Forgot to bring our drinks before our meal... but we jogged her memory and there was no harm done.  The meal was ready in 5 or 10 mins tops.\\n\\nWe left satisfied and went off to watch The Silence of the Lambs and continue with our carnivorous cavorting."},{"name":"Lonesome Dove Western Bistro","address":"419 Colorado St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"My group met at the bar for the Tuesday extended happy hour.

Somehow I convinced Greg to split a pizza (he was kind of confused after, why we did that, but the portion ended up being perfect).

It's tangier than most other sauces I've had and it complimented the meat perfectly.  Although there were no smoke rings to be seen I could still taste enough smokiness in each bite.  Strange, but no complaints.  You know they've basked in the smoke for a long while since the meat pretty much fell off the bone with little resistance.  I've only had better pork ribs and that's back in my home state of Texas so kudos, Atlanta!\\n\\nI also tried the chopped pork sandwich, which was similar to a sloppy joe, only with pork.  I expected shredded pork so I was a little surprised when I first saw it.  They mix a lot of BBQ sauce in with the meat, but it somehow still holds it shape when you grab the sandwich.  Just don't put a death grip on it and you won't have to worry about all its contents falling from the sides.  The sandwich was good, but it wasn't anything eye opening except for maybe the first bite while I was getting used to the unexpected tangy taste.\\n\\nI knew I ordered way too much by getting a full slab of ribs and a chopped pork sandwich so I just added a side of mac n cheese.  Although the mac n cheese was pretty average it actually went well with the sandwich.  For about 30 bucks I was able to order quality food that could have lasted me more than 2 meals if I wasn't such a pig.  The atmosphere is fun and the live music is a huge plus.

Don't be shy about introducing yourself as a new customer - Tony is sincerely warm and friendly. \\n\\nI agree with Katie's review that Tony's sausage is great - worth dropping in for by themselves (they freeze well too). He carries the basic cuts of meat, and he'll custom cut as well, although if you're looking for something big like a whole butterflied leg of lamb, it's essential to call ahead. His meats are very good quality.\\n\\nAs far as the standard Italian deli meats/cheeses (eg parmesan reggiano, proscuttio, linguica, etc) - I find they're always available. And if anything, he carries so many different  choices of Italian dry/canned goods that it can feel intimidating at first. But it's all of superior quality and pretty darn close to supermarket prices\\n\\nThe store is not open on Sundays or Mondays (like many small businesses in Rosi Square... or Italy).  But Tony's nephew is helping him out  these days, so the stores hours have re-expanded a bit for the rest of the week. In particular, he's open on Saturdays for a decent chunk of time, which I find very useful during the summer when the Saturday morning open-air farmer's market in Rosi square is around.

Admittedly, the cooked food isn't amazing, but I don't see the point of ordering udon at AYCE anyway. In my experience, the nigiri has always been decent and the sushi is pretty much what you'd expect from AYCE. It's not a massive menu of cooked items, so come here if you want a satisfying portion of sashimi and sushi, not for an 8-course meal.\\n\\nI've also been here for the late night option, but it's pricier than lunch and I don't feel like the added menu items are worth the extra money. I really don't know why anyone would come here for a la carte.\\n\\nLastly, do keep in mind that this is an Asian restaurant in Richmond that is not only extremely busy but also serving AYCE. There will be a wait (because they're popular, duh), and your server won't always be smiling. The service is basically what you should expect from this type of establishment.

Be careful of the rose of the day - price was $15 for a glass which was higher than my two other glasses of red."},{"name":"Fat Matt's Rib Shack","address":"1811 Piedmont Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Best ribs I've had for as long as I can remember.

Right before the burgers were served, we were told they were \\"out\\" of their famous buns and using the generic (McDonalds type). I immediately wondered if they are having a $$$ dispute with the baker/supplier. I'm not a psychic but this place may be on its way out.

This is one of several restaurants around town where my thrifty nature kicks in and I can't bring myself to pay full price for a meal. How to remedy that? Happy hour! Their 4-5-6 happy hour is a great deal and an easy way to check out their cool venue without breaking the bank. They have a list with $4 drafts, $5 specialty cocktails, and $6 select appetizers which runs from 4-6pm (hence the name) at the bar.  You can choose to sit at the inside bar or the outside bar, and if the weather is nice, the outside bar is tops. You get a lovely view of the newish Scioto Mile fountain, and lots of kiddos running around enjoying the water.\\n\\nI've been twice so far, and have had the Moscow Mule. Scioto Sunset, and the 229 Cosmo. All three drinks were strong for the price and well-balanced. The Moscow Mule comes in a copper mug! The two pizzas that they offer are big enough to share with another person, and for $6 are a bargain. I preferred the Bye Bye Miss American Pie over the Bruschetta pizza, but only because they were a bit too generous with the balsamic drizzle on the latter. \\n\\nSo, don't be intimidated by their pricier entrees- arrive at 5pm and you'll only spend about $10 on a generous appetizer and specialty drink! And while you're there, save me a seat at the bar!"},{"name":"Christopher's","address":"1920 Massachusetts Ave","city":"Cambridge","stars":"3.5","text":"Quite simply, I've never left here disappointed.

Constantly they list the delivery time as 12:30 and they always show up 30 mins late with cold food. Leaving me to had to use the microwave.

The wait is bad on the weekend and it can get loud, but if you go on off times it's great. It is annoying that they won't seat you until your whole group is there, one time my whole family went and my grandmother has emphysema and they have no place to sit and wait. We were only waiting for someone to park the car so we were already 6 and there were tables everywhere. I hadn't chosen to go here, but I wouldn't go with anyone who this might be a problem for.

I admit, the first time I was still stinging from the loss of Casablanca a former Cambridge institution (sigh, good times) that was in that location. The first visit was for a chef's table special, which was very cool.  If there was another visit, it was for drinks and apps with a crowd and if it happened, apparently a lot of drinking was involved. But this was a pre-theater dinner and we can agree that we were there. \\n\\nSo. Well first, there's the food. Which is pretty amazing. Some reviewers complained about small portions, but they apparently have lived in caves for 20 years and not heard of tapas. We were a bit put off by the descriptions and had to ask for some explanations.  Some highlights? The heirloom egg. Seriously. Just get it.  And their take on chicken and waffles. And one of the best pork belly preparations ever. Their cocktails are inventive and both a featured cocktail and a traditional old fashioned were excellent. Yes, they are small and pricey. But if someone is making cocktails this good, they should be paid well. (At least, I hope they are being paid well.) We also very much like their beer and wine choices. Small touch I liked,  the server automatically gave me a taste of the yummy Tempranillo before pouring.  Yes, our server started out on auto-pilot (which always makes me wonder if I'm too old and un-hip to be of interest), but he turned out be efficient and helpful and knowledgeable. And after all, he doesn't need to be my friend. The descriptions include ingredients we weren't familiar with. (Kalettes, yes, I'm talking about you!) which made us a little hesitant about ordering. There was a mix up in the kitchen and we were brought the kale and parsnip dip with lentil crackers instead of the baby kalette ceasar. Often when those mix ups occur, either the offending plate is whisked away with apologies and/or (but mostly 'and') you are made to feel it was your fault. But not here. The dip was put on the table and we realized it was the wrong order and pointed it out. Our server came over and apologized, said it was a mix up in the kitchen, and we benefited. He left it on the table and said the ceasar would be out. Cool.  Okay,the lesson here is: just get the kale and parsnip dip. It is amazing. Well maybe get the kalette too and let us know how it was. I'm sure it will be excellent.  As it was, we had more than we needed to eat and cancelled the ceasar. And the dip was comped.  All this and we were out in plenty of time to get to the theater.  We cannot wait to go back and try more of the menu. This time we will be more adventurous."},{"name":"Buttermilk & Bourbon","address":"160 Commonwealth Ave","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"This place is phenomenal.

I will admit after visiting several other establishments of similar category throughput the country I had a few expectations in mind.

However, ones we were inside, it became apparent that we will have to wait again for a table to become available. The place is quite large with a bar that was overrun by very loud college age kids. The culture of the place has nothing remotely to do with a speakeasy, this is a typical loud Boston pub with Boston service. The drinks were OK, however nothing extraordinary. The food, however, was excellent and there is a good supply of Scotch, I only wonder who drinks it. If you are closer to 40 and are looking for a classy place to have a cocktail, without getting a headache and straining your vocal cords, this is not the place!
