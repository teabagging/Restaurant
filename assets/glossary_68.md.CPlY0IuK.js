The dish had an appealing, delightful look (see picture) which fueled my devouring of the full plate in 10 minutes. It was one of the best brunches I've ever had, absolutely delicious. It was healthy, refreshing, and fulfilling at the same time. The meat looked amazing and tasted even better. The sausages and rasher breathed life into the dish. They were not oily and melted right in my mouth. My eggs were perfectly cooked in over-easy style. The whole dish was a bliss! \\n\\nNow, since I went to the place in the morning for a quick brunch fix, I wouldn't know anything about it as a neighborhood bar. But 5/5 for a stellar brunch that I desperately needed. The only con was that it took a long time for the food to arrive, but it is understandable since the bar was understaffed with only 1 server working at the time. \\n\\nTip: Brunch is only served on the weekends from 10 am to 3 pm.

Their service there was always lacking, but I wouldn't expect anything more from an \\"authentic\\" Chinese restaurant. \\n\\nA groups of friends and I ordered five dishes, and they all came out in reasonable time.

I informed the waiter that I didn't want to make a scene or anything and if he could just take that dish off of our bill. He told me that he couldn't do that, because he already took it back to make us a new dish. In my opinion, that is the least they could do after finding TWO pieces of hair in our dish after already having taken a couple bites. \\n\\nI do understand from the business's perspective that they can't make profit off of comp'ing meals all the time, but if they really cared about their customers and their experiences, this would not be a problem for me.

When you come, ask to sit with Rocky. Got a question about any dish on the menu... Rocky's got  the answer. Need  more sweet tea... Rocky will fill your glass before you even notice you needed more.

Brought down from the heavens and delivered to you by angels. That may not be as accurate but when I say the ribs are incomparable to any other place that serves ribs, it's accurate. You'll have trouble pulling a rib from the rack just because the bone comes off super easy. No struggle at all. It's amazing, the experience and the brisket/ribs. I tried the pulled pork, turkey, potato salad, beans- they're good also, not anything to remember Franklins by but they're good, also the sausages. Overall, yes - go here and wait with friends.

They offer a variety of cuts and meats including brisket, ribs, pulled pork, sausage, and turkey. This would also be the order in which I would rank the meats. Not to say that any of the meats are bad, but when you are considering which meats you want to consume before your pant buttons pop off, you want to make sure you save room for the best. \\n\\nThey provide pickles, onions, bread, and BBQ sauces. Traditionally, I am a sauce guy. Anytime I have the option I am going to try a new sauce. Whether it is a sub, fries, or burger, the more sauce the better. However, to me the meat speaks for itself. No need for sauce because it just takes away from the rub and juice in the meat itself. \\n\\nLastly, do not overlook the desserts. The pecan pie is delicious.

People always said to come early in the morning. I dont know about you but BBQ isn't usually on my mind during breakfast time. I was going to try out Micklethwait's Craft Meats but they ran out by that time. I passed by Franklin and thought I'd give it a shot since there wasnt too much of a line. I was really lucky because when I got in the back of the line I was given a sign that said \\"Last Man Stand'n\\". That meant that I was the last person guaranteed food (with a full selection at least).  The line was still pretty long but not as bad as it could have been. A guy in line gave me the tip that their brisket is unbelievable. I got a two meat combo with brisket and ribs.  I was ruined. Im not sure if anything else will measure up to these meats. the ribs had a good pull and was very tender and juicy. the brisket was perfectly moist and also very tender. the man serving it up asked me what kind of brisket i normally like, so you can get it more lean if you want. I also had the mustard based potato salad and the coleslaw.  both were excellent. The two meat plate is really enough for a couple meals. There was no way I could finish all of it.

They sat us in a booth near the very back, near the kitchen. We were basically the only customers there, and thought it a bit strange that they had so many people on staff still. One thing in particular that irritated me was there were staff on the other side of us, probably doing side work, chatting and gossiping. That's a huge pet peeve of mine. When I come to a restaurant I don't want to listen to the employees chit-chat like a bunch of hens. OK... to top that off, they were basically cleaning up while we were eating... stacking chairs and cleaning the floor... another very unprofessional behavior. They should wait until all customers have left before they do that. But..... the absolute icing on the cake was our server, who felt it was appropriate to remove my plate (with only about 1/3 of the food eaten) from in front of me, to box it. He also felt it was acceptable to bring our check before asking if we were ready. I was appalled... I mean.. really?! Could you be any MORE subtle about wanting us to leave?! OK so fine, we left, and I will not ever be coming back. \\n\\nIf you are able to look past horrible customer service to the lower-than-mediocre food, than maybe this is the place for you. Honestly, I could have made better food at home. The bread was hard and stale, the salad was pretty pathetic, and the tomato sauce was extremely acidic.... so much in fact it was making my stomach turn. Stop over-cooking your sauce!

Though several tables were visibly empty we were quoted at around 30min wait time to be seated. My date didn't mind the wait and we went to get a drink at the bar. We waited what seemed like an eternity without getting a drink order taken, but it was apparently long enough to get a table. We were sat at one of the empty tables we had seen since walking in and after the hostess left we sat again for what seemed like an eternity. My date finally walked up to the hostess to tell them that no one had been by our table. The hostess informed up that they were short-staffed, but she would get someone over as soon as possible. I told my date we should just leave, but he insisted it would be the same wait anywhere else on 6th and we were both starving. We should have gone when we had the chance. \\n\\nWhen our waiter finally showed up you could tell he was stressed completely inattentive. We ordered drinks and told our waiter we wanted to put in a food order because of the ridiculously long wait times we had already experience. He told us that it was going to be at least 30mins on any of pizzas. Seriously? So I asked how long it would be for a meatball sub. My date ended up ordering a pasta dish. \\n\\nWith caring to go into the timing details, to make a long story short, when our food finally showed up, my meatball sub was lukewarm and I have honestly had a better one from Subway and my date's pasta dish looked haphazardly thrown together.

We didn't even wait for our non-existent waiter to come back and ask for the check. My date just dropped $40 in cash on the table, to which he remarked he had definitely overpaid and we left. \\n\\nEnded up going to Gourdough's downtown location for alcohol and food since we not nearly buzzed enough and still hungry. \\n\\nWhile this might not be the norm for this place, one awful experience is one too many and will not be back."},{"name":"Marco's Restaurant","address":"47 Newbury St","city":"Peabody","stars":"4","text":"We have been to Marco's three times now and each visit was great.

The Mac and cheese was declared delicious as was the house salad with vinaigrette that several people ordered. We split a few desserts which were all really good. I tried the banana pudding. Not as good as my southern grandmother's but still yummy. It is served in a jar with a caramelized banana. Everyone proclaimed it to be the \\"cutest\\" dessert.

After I signed my receipt the girl walked away without telling me anything but I assumed she was going to make my order (my to go order has always been ready once I arrived previously) one of the other workers in the seating area asked if I had a to go order and I replied yes, she already had me sign the receipt and I think she's making it. He then started yelling across the restaurant asking her if she was making my order then she replied yes. Another girl came over to check me out but I had already paid so I told her I had signed my receipt already and showed her the receipt. She then offered me a drink on the house that I didn't accept because I felt as if they thought I was being difficult when I was actually just waiting for my food and being asked questions and put on the spot. Then I was asked to take a seat and my food would be brought out to me. When my food was done the girl stood behind the counter and yelled ma'am at me several times until I heard her. Which again was awkward because I was told it would be brought out to me. I never would have sat down if I knew it would be this way.

Such a contentious topic, many barbecue lovers would be tempted to say, \\"No way, not possible.\\" True, we don't have our own regional style, like Memphis, Texas, Kansas City, or North Carolina. Frankly, I've never been to any of those places and tried the Q there. I only know what I like. Smokey, tender, moist, but not greasy, not too saucy, not too sweet. Enter Soulfire, which has rave reviews from it's fans, and mediocre reviews from others. Three Groupons later and my final verdict, 3 stars. Starting with the brisket, very flavorful, there was plenty of smoke, a crispy bark and the meat was juicy. However, it had a thick ring of dripping grey grease along the edge that had to be trimmed off before eating. The pork spare ribs are meaty, toothsome, and well seasoned with the dry rub, but again, too much fat. OK, so maybe you're saying, \\"Dude, it's barbecue, it's supposed to be greasy, get over it.\\" In my opinion, well done barbecue has most of the fat rendered off during the smoking process without drying the meat out. Finding globs of white fat stuck to the meat means it wasn't smoked long enough and cooked at too high a temperature. For the rest of the menu, a great find was the fried catfish. Flaky but not oily, crisp on the outside, but not dry, the catfish filet pairs well with the house barbecue sauces. The fried chicken was good, but a tad too sweet. I think there must be a lot of sugar in the marinade and the breading, because it comes out of the fryer a deep dark brown, instead of a golden color. It also is soggy with grease instead of crispy and light. The sides are decent, but everything seems to be made with way too much sugar. The baked beans, collard greens, cole slaw, corn bread, and chili are cloyingly sweet, and not savory enough. \\n\\nSo to summarize: too greasy, too sweet. Is there better bbq in Boston? Definitely, but not bad for Allston.\\n\\nGood news, $2.75 PBR and $3 Lone Star."},{"name":"Sugar Factory","address":"8371 International Dr, Ste 70","city":"Orlando","stars":"3","text":"Server/ service and milkshakes were great!\\n\\nMenu and food were disappointing.

But when things like Franklin BBQ and RAMEN TATSU-YA come around, it's worth it.  Not. even. kidding.\\n\\nSo, here is the story.  We showed up at 5.30 on Saturday and there was a big line.  That is ok.  I expected it.  It's on.  Even tho we had gotten our first \\"cool front\\" it was still pretty hot.  It was probably going to be at least an hour wait.  The awesome bf ran over to Target to get some water and a little snack for us while we waited on line, as i was already starting to get hangry (hungry/angry.)  Before he made it back, i Literally started to pass out.  Like i'm about to drop, blurry vision, i don't think i'm going to live feeling.  Maybe it was low blood sugar? i dunno.  We sadly admitted defeat but vowed to come back later.\\n\\nSet the scene.  9:15 pm.  WE ARE BACK!!!!  we are ready to get our ramen on!!  Then... it happens.  We are told they are out of ramen and just about everything else.  Sad Carole and Josh are sad.  We order the sliders (which are highly recommended) the spicy edamame and a salad.  About ... 7 mins? after we place our order, the sliders are delivered.  They are like a mini meatloaf coated with panko and fried, served on a King's Hawaiian bun with a special sauce and slaw.  It's delicious.  Don't skip it, even tho it is a little pricey.  Our salad and edamame is also delivered.  The salad is very light, refreshing and yummy.  The edamame is forgettable and kinda soggy.  The extra 50 cents to make it \\"spicy\\" was not worth it.  But we were just trying everything since we couldn't have ramen.\\n\\nTHEN!!!  we hear the guy that told us they were out of ramen tell the line that was in front of us (we were seated at the bar) that they would run out of ramen at that point.  WAIT.  WHAT?!?!??!!!!!  THERE IS RAMEN?!?!!!!!  (apparently they had \\"found a package\\" they didn't know they had.)  HOLD UP!  Le awesome bf immediately goes to the server guy and says we want to claim some ramen.  The counter girls are awesome and tell the bf to jump the line and get some ramen (we deserve it ya'll! we WERE there first!)  SUCCESS!!!!!!!!!\\n\\nLess than 10 mins later the ramen arrives.  I got a #2 with a corn on the bomb and extra garlic (you press it yourself!  they give you a press and a handful of peeled cloves.) and ... omg... i don't think i can do it justice.  It is seriously amazing.  I tasted the broth first and it was so yummy and robust.  I have never had broth like this.  Apparently soaking pork bones for, like,  3 days makes out of this world broth.  Good to know.  The pork belly is tasty and delicious.  The soft boiled egg is delicious.  I am in heaven.  I do not want to share with the bf, but i do, cause he is awesome.  *see above.  Everything was delicious.  Seriously, i don't give 5 stars to hardly anyone.

After we ordered, we had to wait for seating to open up, so we grabbed some wall by the cash register and water dispenser.  The next thing i know, i am seeing Chef Paul coming to get some H2o.  o.m.g.  did i see that?  am i seeing it?!  i omitted an audible gasp!  So much so that Chef and the bf look at me to make sure i am ok.  Then bf realizes what i am gasping about and joins me in star strucked-ness. (i know that is not a word, just go with it.)  I was a good Austinite and did not go over to bother him and ask for pics (unlike a couple of others.)  However, i was rewarded with a glance and a smile from Chef after he got back to the table.

I wish I could say that the food is so outstanding that it makes up for all of these shananigans I put up with to nosh there, but that's not even the case...And yet....I come back.

If you're having a cheat day and pretending that the ready-to-smite carb gods are not looking down on you on this fine AM, sandos are well made and fairly reasonable - turkey/gouda/fig mustard, eggplant/egg/tahini, pastrami/dijoinnaise/gruyere/pickles - and the homemade ciabatta is a love, as is the sunflower wheat sourdough.\\n\\nIf you're in the mood to say yolo, I'd do it with their fruit tarte (fig and or cherry or both) or almond meringue, at $7 and $5 respectively, it's not a cheap way to get fat, but dear Lord is it yum.

It is definitely my favorite in Austin, and maybe even the whole world. It's got great acoustics, and the stage slopes downward so everyone (even the people in the waaay back) has a decent view. They also have an indoor stage that's much smaller and more intimate, great for smaller acts. The one thing I have to say that's negative regarding them as a venue is how expensive their drinks are, but that's kind of everywhere.\\n\\nThe 3 stars is for the food. First of all, barbecue isn't really that hard to do. It's one of those Texas treasures that's so great because of its simplicity and smoky flavor. Even the sides are meant to be simple: beans, cole slaw, potato salad, mac and cheese... C'mon, it's not rocket science. But somehow, despite Stubb's notoriety all over Texas, they suck at all of these, including the meat. I ordered the cole slaw and mac and cheese as sides to my brisket sandwich.

We had our food at about ten minutes after they opened at 11am, so it ended up being a little over five hours in total. The sweet spot probably would have been 7 or 7:30, but obviously it's hard to say what it'll be on any given day, and it's certainly possible that it would have taken an extra hour to get in and get our food had we been only slightly further back in line.\\n\\nAs for the food -- we had a group of three and got two pounds of brisket, a half pound of pork ribs, a half pound of sausage (three links), a pint of pinto beans, a single side of slaw, and three key lime pies. The standout, naturally, was the brisket, which was easily the best I've ever had, and worth the trip to Austin on its own. I don't have anything to say that hasn't been said a million times already, but suffice it to say our experience matched all the others who have loved this brisket.\\n\\nThe pork ribs were also great. Not typically my favorite thing, but these were fantastic. I think I'd take the beef ribs at La Barbecue over these, but that is a pretty tough comparison. The sausage was very good as well, but kind of an afterthought compared to the other meats, if I'm being honest.\\n\\nI felt the same about the sides -- the beans and the slaw were fine, but I didn't find them to be anything overly special. We did love the key lime pies, though.\\n\\nOn the sauces -- I wasn't crazy about the vinegar or espresso sauces.

I think shoyu has a bit of lightness to it, and it had more of a richness to it in this broth and a very very slight tartness to it that I couldn't quite make out.

After another 20 minutes we finally received our drinks only to be severely disappointed. The staff did not inform us that they were out of the ingredients to make the watermelon goblet, and instead they improvised by throwing gummy worms and coconut gummies on top of the drink. They did not even consider asking if we would like to try another option since they didn't have the items available. \\nMove on to the night owl goblet, it had 4 very sticky textured lollipops thrown in and a few peach rings. As for the liquid part of the drink, it looked and tasted like a extra sweet orange soda, which was disappointing because it was supposed to be mint infused lemonade. \\n\\nNext we ordered our food and had to wait about 35 minutes for it to come. The waiter brought one of our party's food first and then three more people about 10 minutes later and the final persons dish about 10 minutes after that.

The two orders of chicken tenders were just barely  warm and thrown on a plate  and were not very appetizing. \\nThe two people who ordered the sandwiches seemed content with their choice.\\n\\nOverall, a huge disappointment, especially for a restaurant that charges $26 for some poorly made drinks.

The gluten free one is filling enough for a meal.  For 2 small pizza's it was just under 12 $.  \\n\\nThe girl working the till was really friendly and made us feel relaxed.  The other lady didn't smile but she was very accomodating.  The only thing is my sister ordered a meat pizza and wanted the vegan cheese on it since she is allergic to dairy products and instead they gave her a vegan pizza with no meat.  English wasn't her first language so there was a bit of confusion. \\n\\nWhen we walked in it was completely empty and kind of dark.  We weren't sure if it was open and we were waiting at the till until someone from the back came up.  They should maybe have a bell for people to ring.  \\n\\nIt's kind of a fun thing to try for a non-gluten free person for something different.  I most likely won't go again for the gluten free one since I could make better at home, but overall it was a positive experience."},{"name":"Stubb's Bar-B-Q","address":"801 Red River St","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"So I went from never going to Stubbs before to going twice in the last two weeks!

I was sincerely disappointed because I was very optimistic about the establishment.\\n\\nWhile I give them credit for roasting their own beans, they don't do a good job at it. Their beans are overly roasted, to the point of being burned. The resultant flavor overrides any hope they had of offering a decent espresso drink. Unfortunately, it doesn't get much better from there. The barista who pulled my cappuccino and my friend's latte needs to improve if this shop is going to stay open. My first clue that the drink wasn't going to be good was when I saw they had a thermometer to get the temperature of the steamed milk. A professional barista doesn't need this. Even though our barista used a thermometer, the drink was still way to hot. The second clue was when the barista overfilled my friend's latte (which came out first) resulting in crema and microfoam spilling over the sides of the cup. Obviously latte art wasn't going to happen.\\n\\nMy drink wasn't much better. The only difference between my cappuccino and my friend's latte was that mine had a whole bunch of foam on top. It's like the barista had been trained at Starbucks. Even without all this, the taste of the espresso was just quite bad. It was burned, flat and just not good. \\n\\nAll of this is quite unfortunate because the owner of the establishment is really nice.

We also had a fish dish that was also really nicely done with great flavors.

VEGETABLES!!!! You can have various vegetables (besides fried eggplant, saut√©ed spinach, and salads) in your pasta dish\\n2. MEAT & FISH!! Outside of the Christmas special, Zucca serves various meats and fish dishes\\n3. FRESH PASTA! Happiness is fresh, house made pasta! Just try it!!\\n4. Happy staff.

If you decide to try it, go for the ribs. Sure the pulled pork sandwiches and chicken are great, but the ribs are the outstanding item on their very simple menu. Most items come with chips and plates come with one side. I usually opt for the coleslaw - the beans are a little off for me but I know many of my friends swear by them. They have a bit of mustard in the mix that makes them too tangy for me compared to the tangy-ness of the sauce - but that's just my opinion.\\n\\nNow on the the main item - the RIBS - these aren't those dainty things you find in may wannabe bbq joints - these are those whole ribs you'd find out in the country when someone is seriously smoking up some pig. The smoke flavor is marginal - most of the intensity here is in the wood fire char and caramelization of the sauce on these long bones (they include the chewy cartilage on one end that many restaurants trim off as being too Neanderthal for the civilized man. Be aware that if you order a half-slab, you could get any set from the wide to the thin end - there are variations of flavor and texture to both. Order several so you get a fair mix of bone sizes, or some will have too much while others perhaps a bit too little. They don't discriminate at Fat Matt's!\\n\\nAs for ambience, don't expect one of those modern style restaurants - this is raw and the people who eat there appreciate it for what it is. Evening weekends usually feature live blues so you can make an occasion of it - just be aware that the crowds can make it both an in-line wait to order and a bounty of elbows and stand-arounds to be in your way."},{"name":"Fuji At WoC","address":"1420 Hancock St","city":"Quincy","stars":"4.5","text":"Ordered unagi bento box.

Oh, there were some families there too. Actually just one familia, but the toddler was effing adorable and I maybe tried to take him home, which is why they stand out - regardless, that's a long way of saying that M152 is settling in quite nicely. \\n\\nTaking a quick gander at the menu, I was immediately struck by its slightly non-trad take on this midday meal - oysters, lobster & grits, tater tot poutine w/ Chinese sausage, CB hash, quinoa & pickled tea leaf salad, and to round it out, both beef and tofu burgers. Oh, and a rotating \\"Ron Swanson Brunch Special\\", which will be recalled to you with the appropriate scene from P&R, which is pretty awesome. \\n\\nWanting to be adventurous, we tried the poutine, kale/bacon/goat cheese omelette, CB hash, RS special (2 bacon wrapped shrimpies w two eggs/curried potatoes/toast), and smoked salmon bagel - all of which ranged from $12 (poutine) to $17 (hash) - with the price to portion ratio being spot on for the poutine and omelette, but a bit weak for the RS special - I think $16 should warrant more than two shrimp, but perhaps I'm old fashioned - and like, it wasn't even shrimp with provenance, you know? No cute farmer was involved, I have no idea how loved these little non-kosher delights were - clearly basics one should know abt all food I consume. Actually I abhor all this name dropping of producers nonsense, but my mind wanders as M152 doesn't do this - what it does do is brunch well.\\n\\nThat said, if you're going w someone who's going to fuss that there are no pancakes on the menu and recoil at the idea of enchiladas before 5p, I'd venture elsewhere. All items tried got high marks, some plates were even licked clean - and while the hot-smoked salmon was on point, the bagel was not Jew-approved and the scallion schmear could have been more assertive, though clearly I ate every bite.  \\n\\nEntrees range from $8 (simple salad) to $22 (lobster grits) - service is a little slow but incredibly friendly - overall, welcome to the hood, M152.

I sort of get the feeling that this restaurant sort of flies a bit under the radar as I have two of the better meals I have ever had in Boston here. Last night 3 of us arrived around 6:20 (the Red Sox game ended around 5 so this worked out good for us because most of the game traffic was long gone). Apparently, on Sunday evenings the Club Room is closed so we had to eat in the Expo Kitchen but we had both the Club Room menu available as well as the Neopolitan pizzas. Despite the Red Sox game having recently ended, there was only another four top inside the restaurant and probably 2 tables full on the patio. Three of us split a Neopolitan pizza with Sausage and Ramps which was one of the better pizzas I have had in Boston, perfectly charred thin crust and excellent toppings. Next we had the Roasted Cauliflower with Manchego Cheese and a Caper Yogurt which we all loved and devoured. Next we were brought a complimentary small plate of Calamari which was prepared in a different way than I have ever had Calamari and I wish I could describe it other than to say it had a nice little kick to it and it was not fried but it, too, was excellent. We then split two pastas, Bigoli Pasta with Spinach and Artichoke and Pasta with fresh cams and lobster roe butter. I don't think any of us loved the Bigoli Pasta dish but the other pasta dish was delicious. All and all, the cost was about $110 with a glass of wine, a cocktail and an iced tea, I think quite reasonable for the quality and creativity. I have seen complaints about portions size but most of the menu items are meant to be shared so that each person gets a little taste. For us, they were very satisfying portion sizes. In addition, the service was very good, despite the waitress being fairly new and inexperienced but she was very nice and friendly.

One if my favorite barbecue places is Salt Lick and I used that as comparison. I have to say Franklin's is better, but there's not a big gap between them since I think bbq can only get so good.

She and I split the Mac & Cheese with pork and bacon the first jaunt, and it was decent, well cooked, acceptable portions of pasta and meat (although I'll say Flipside has more and better for cheaper), and he tried out a grilled cheese with fries.  Their fries were FANtastic, very well seasoned (although she thought them overly so, I am not a fan of salt and liked them a ton).  \\n\\nSecond trip just me and the kid, he went with the PB&J, I tried at the servers suggestion the Cuban, which was a pseudo-hoagie bun with goodly amounts of ham, pork, cheese and pickles.  Liked it but over priced for performance.  Kids meals are $7, come with a drink, a meal, a side and a dessert, which is a good value. \\n\\nOverall, nice place to go, just a bit overpriced for the food as far as it goes.

Their wine list was quite bad for me so I didn't order any wine form them. There was also a 200+% mark up in some of the wine. I never really get why restaurants in Vancouver mark up their wine so much. To put things in perspective, L'Atelier de Joel Robuchon in Hong Kong and Gordon Ramsay's restaurant at the Royal hospital road in UK (both are 3 michelin stars restaurant) don't even mark up their wine that much on average (wine like Petrus has insane market price anyway). \\n     Let's start talking about their food. Their food was just a little pretentious for me. I had their fried octopus dish to start. It was served in a very narrow ( probably had the width of 1.5-2cm) which made it very hard to get food out of. The fried octopus was overcooked which made it too chewy and the seasoning in the batter was also quite one dimensional. The aioli in this dish was a bit too overpowering which made it quite hard to taste the other elements (komatsuna and shallots).  For the Entree, I had the halibut dish. This dish was quite dry, it needs some sauce to bind the whole dish together. The fish was again overcooked; it was quite dry in the middle. The veggies are nicely cooked though. I am not a big fan of the presentation again, there was a smear of cauliflower puree on the rim of the plate. First of all, I don't like eating food of the rim of the plate. Second of all, the puree was bland and quite grainy , it didn't really serve any purpose in the dish in my opinion. It just looked really pretentious to me. I am perfectly fine with smears but not on the rim of a bowl.  \\n     This restaurant quite decent for the price, but it can do a lot better if they focus on making the flavours work, not how to please people with often gimmicky presentation."},{"name":"Foster Burger","address":"5339 Se Foster Rd","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"Came here with my dad and baby, not realizing it was kind of a bar/lounge atmosphere haha.

However, right from the first impression , they are very disorganized in terms of managing the front of the house to seat people. They just leave a book on a podium with no attendant and no sign indicating that you have to leave your name in the book yourself , when you have a large brunch crowd this gets confusing. while service was quick and efficient the waitress we had couldn't even be bothered to smile to greet us and made as little verbal contact with us as possible. It felt like this place really just had no human touch to it. The food itself was good, my scrambled eggs were fluffy and perfectly cooked, my avocado was ripe and my sausage was very tasty , the bacon though had no flavour at all and was 99% fat. The issue is the portion is very small for the price, the quality is good but nothing extraordinary and everyone at the table left still hungry. I ordered a ginger apple juice as well which was good but very small serving yet again for the price.

It's a nice light lunch and I love the chewyness of the lavash they use for the roll-up.  Although I do think they could add a few extra slices of bacon in there.  My first bites are usually lavash and lettuce.\\n\\n2)  Their steak bomb (minus the mushrooms) is pretty good.  Sometimes it's a hit or miss depending on the day and how busy the place is.  It seems on slower days, they're able to put more love into the sandwich and I can taste it.  On a rushed day (like the other day, for example) where the line is going out the door, my steak bomb was half assed.  The good news: half assed, it was still so good that I did the unthinkable and to my coworkers surprise - ate the 2nd half of my sandwich...or at least most of it.  (Lunch for me is typically 1/2 a sandwich.)\\n\\n3)  They have some great soups on those cold chilly days.  Or if you're just in a soup mood.  I enjoy their tomato rice and their cream of broccoli (or is it a broccoli cheddar?)  My coworker really enjoys the baked potato, which always looks and smells delicious.  Still waiting for that perfect soup day to try it.\\n\\n4) Their tuna is bomb.  Do people even use that term anymore?  No matter, I'm using it here.  Reasons unknown to even myself, I have been loyal to Subway tuna for as long as I can remember.  I don't eat seafood, so I guess Subway's is the least fishy.  Buttttttttt, my coworker let me try a taste of the tuna from his tuna sub one day and I was in love...with the tuna, not my coworker.  My preferred method of eating their tuna is to get a scoop on a salad and then make my own pita pocket with the lettuce, tuna, and Russian dressing.

One of my coworkers had talked to the hostess earlier in the day and she said that reservations would not be needed that night.  So it was a little annoying whenever we walked up and ended up having a 20 minute wait for a table. In any case there was a bar upstairs that we waited at and I made sure to check with the hostess that we would be able to transfer our tabs from the bar to our table (we needed it for work) which she said we could.  That would turn out not to be the case so the moral of this story is that you shouldn't trust what the hostesses say here as they were 0 for 2 with information for us.\\n\\nIn any case once we got seated we had an excellent view of the Citywalk as they seated us on the third floor in the tower like structure.  After getting seated our table decided to start off the meal by splitting the blackened tuna nachos, crab rangoon dip and parmesan truffle fries.  All of the appetizers ended up tasting pretty good with the blackened tuna nachos being my favorite.  I guess I didn't really read the description properly as I was expecting more of a traditional nachos but they surprised me and had the tuna on 5 wonton chips which ended up being nice.  For my entree I decided to have the Big Squeal burger (Half-pound beef burger, pulled pork, smoked gouda cheese, onion strings, bacon coleslaw, BBQ sauce, lettuce, pickles, brioche bun) with a side of bacon coleslaw and also the Firecracker Roll (Shrimp tempura, kani inside coated with tempura flakes, topped with yellowtail, salmon, spicy mayo, masago, tobiko and scallions. Served with ponzu dipping sauce).  Our server told me that it was a lot of food but I still decided to go with it anyways.  She ended up being correct as it was a ton of food but I am glad that I ordered all of it.  The burger was cooked nicely and the bun was toasted properly which allowed me to properly eat the burger.  I enjoyed the onion strings and bbq sauce on the burger as I thought that they gave it great flavor.  Where I think that they missed the boat was on the bacon coleslaw which gave me neither a good coleslaw or bacon taste.  My sushi roll was also good and our table agreed that it was the best of the three different rolls that we had ordered to the table.  For dessert I ended up ordering the vanilla cake shake which was pretty awesome.  It really tasted like a milkshake made of birthday cake ice cream which just so happens to be my favorite ice cream.\\n\\nThe bottom line for me is that I would head back to the Cowfish in the future.

My main meal of seafood fettucine was equally over-cheesed, thick and heavy covering up what little seafood was in the dish (and I mean little, as in size and quantity).  My boyfriend's seared ahi tuna was rolled in Old Bay seasoning prior to searing and was so salty that it was rendered nearly unedible -  for $38 bucks!?  Our waiter was fun, but inattentive.

From the decor to the service to the food - everything hit the mark.\\n\\nA lot of people seem to have had issues with getting seated at the time of their reservation - this was totally not the case with us.  We had an 8.00pm reservation and arrived at 7.45pm.  Our table wasn't ready (which was cool since we wanted to have a drink at the bar) but we were promptly seated once 8.00 rolled around.  The bar area was a little cramped but not uncomfortably so.  I have to say that the one thing that I wasn't a fan of is the chain metal curtain that separates the hostess stand/bathrooms from the bar.  It's cool if there is someone there to part them for you - not so cool when you walk behind someone who whaps them all around.  I also really liked the contrast between the very dark bar/lounge area and the \\"bright\\" tone of the dining room.\\n\\nOnce we were sat at our table (lower level), I got the chance to check out the dining room.  I was surprised at how small the restaurant actually was.  I think that it's one of the smallest restaurants that I have ever eaten at.  But even with the size, it definitely didn't feel crowded and the tables are laid out well.  The decor reminded me of the Clift Hotel in SF - white walls, charcoal ceiling, black and white wallpaper below the chair rail - all in all, very cool.  The underwater creature sculpture hanging from the ceiling was very cool as well (flashback to Farallon).\\n\\nWe (me and my date) started off with foie gras and and the lamb tenderloin.  In all honesty, you can't really go wrong with foie gras.  I would eat foie gras for breakfast (and lunch and dinner) if I could...but I'm not rich nor do I have my own personal chef...but still, a girl can dream!  Throughout the meal, our server was extremely attentive but wasn't overbearing.  He kept the dinner service moving but we never felt rushed (and since we were there for ~3 hours, you can make your own call about the timing).\\n\\nFor dinner, I had the scallops with lobster risotto and my date had the steak au poivre...both were fantastic.  We also had a great bottle of zin (after the glass of Riesling that we had with the starters).  I  have nothing bad to say about any of the food...it was all fantastic.  For dessert we had the apple tart (my date drank a single malt and our server brought me a complementary glass of port...at least I think it was port...)  Once all plates had been cleared and my date and I yakked on, our server came back (who really should be my new best friend) and offered us an additional complementary nightcap!  Seriously, this guy ruled.  So it was two Jameson's' for us as we proceeded to close the place down...and I mean literally close the place down because there was not a front of the house person in sight once we made our way out.  \\n\\nSo in a nutshell - my night at Aria was awesome and I will definitely be heading back - and hopefully sitting in the same server's section!"},{"name":"The Mighty Cone","address":"1720 Barton Springs Rd","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"What a way to spend time away from the office, especially when it catches on fire. \\n\\nAs I walked through the file room and smelled smoke, I said, \\"What is that smell?\\" A colleague, suddenly paralyzed offered, \\"It's above your head.\\" \\n\\nSmoke emanated from the ceiling tiles, accompanied with the rubbery, electrical melty smell.

The second time I went I did have a California tempeh burger (my first time eating tempeh) and I did like it at first and I liked the flavors until I noticed the texture of tempeh and all I could think about was the odd, crumbly, somewhat dry texture of tempeh. I can eat just about anything but if I don't like the texture then it's ruined for me. My boyfriend had a bite and said it's a too much bread and not enough filling.

I got a cookies and cream peanut butter milkshake and my friend got a chocolate milkshake our first times there. All milkshakes are made with banana ice cream which they said is made by blending bananas, freezing them, and scooping the bananas out that are now ice cream texture. Because of the banana ice cream, every milkshake has a banana taste to it on top of the milkshake. Since it's essentially bananas instead of ice cream I found my milkshake to be a hybrid between a milkshake and a smoothie but I still liked it. We did wait a loong time for my friend's milkshake which was a little awkward since we wanted them to-go so we could enjoy them and walk around outside.

The poached egg perched on top of the poulet dish was perfect. I dream about poached eggs like this, so I will definitely be back for brunch. I have read reviews of this dish which mention it being a bit too salty, and I did have a few forks full which were that way for me.... but overall it was delicious. My sister said hers wasn't too salty at all. Scooter dubbed his pork \\"good, but not amazing, if not for the ratatouille it would have been bland.\\"\\n\\nDessert: Scooter paired the flourless chocolate torte with the chocolate ice cream & chocolate chips & caramel (that's TWO, count 'em TWO desserts, people), and I think his eyes rolled back in his head with every bite. My sister got the fromage blanc (Fruit Coulis, Shortbread Crust, Marcona Almond) which was delicious, and I opted for French press -- grateful for the complimentary, home made Madelines which come with the check.\\n\\nNo adult beverages for me this time, but the wine, beer, and cocktail menu seemed varied and pretty big for such a small place. Scooter enjoyed each of his beers, and my sister liked her white wine very much (sorry, didn't pay attention to specifics here).\\n\\nOur server was friendly, engaging, very attentive, and appropriately funny. Some have slammed Cocotte for its slow service, and while I never experienced even a hint of this, I would explain any lag as being intentional -- an opportunity to linger over the care and attention that's put into the food. \\n\\nMerci bien, Cocotte!"},{"name":"Fox Bros.

Do not believe the hype about having to show up hours early. It's not necessary (except on weekends--YMMV). I showed up at noon today (a Thursday), had a one hour wait, and they still had every item on the menu on hand when I made it to the front of the line. It may have been necessary at some point in the past to get in line at 9:00 am (and people still do), but if you can get here by noon or 12:30 in the middle of the week, I'd say your chances were pretty good, especially because ALL of the meats I tried were great, not just the beef.\\n\\nRegarding the excellent meat, plenty has already been written, so I won't even attempt to describe it. I'll just say the brisket was sublime, and urge you to get down there and try it! \\n\\nWhat I will do is offer a few helpful hints:\\n\\n1. A good section of the line (the handicap ramp), about a 20+ minute stretch, is unshaded. Wear shorts, wear sunscreen, and maybe consider carrying an umbrella to provide shade. There were several in the line today, and I was envious. \\n\\n2. Once you get in the door, you still have about a 20-30 minute wait before you get to the meat counter.\\n\\n3. They do have sauces. One is thin and vinegary, dipping sauce style. Another one is dark and molasses-y and the last one is a slightly sweet and tangy tomato based sauce. If you like sauce on your meat (I like sauce on my pork ribs), you can mix and match the sauces to create something that's to your liking. \\n\\n4. Of the sides, my favorite was the cole slaw.

There is a full cash bar as you wait to be seated in the main room. Then the 'pre-show' started which was the introduction to the story...very fun, high energy and a teaser for the show. Ok, on to the show...it was terrific! The actors/singers are all trained and excellent. The story was fun and it included audience members of all ages. It was a very interactive experience. There were lots of swords, pirate fighting...lots of action.  The food was served well and did not interfere with the show. It was very good and  hot. The dessert could use a little ice cream or whipped cream. The pork/shrimp option was delicious. The chicken option didn't look very interesting. There was a pasta option too. My only real problem was the sound system. The singers are so good and they all perform such a high energy/fun show but we didn't understand a good portion of the words. It seemed muffled,just not clear, although the music was loud enough. There are jokes, songs, a running comic line throughout the show that isn't understood well.

The mango-jalapeno slaw was a nice fresh touch.\\n\\nThe cone dog was a really good piece of venison sausage, but I really would have liked more than 2 slices.

Maybe I had it coming, but in my defense the menu did say that it was grilled marinated chicken, bacon, and I think there was something about black beans and corn, so in my head I was like, \\"Yeah, a quesadilla done right!\\"  and let's face it, bacon makes anything delicious.  Well anyhoo, my \\"Qesadilla Done Right\\" ended up being a one-way ticket to Bland-ville.  The chicken was dry, the cheese was oily, and if there was bacon in there (which I'm almost positive there wasn't) I certainly couldn't taste it.

A couple pies might - MIGHT - be around by Friday, but they tend to be gone by the weekend. My husband finds it too rich for him, but I LOVE it.\\n\\nThe dessert area is bigger and better than ever.

It's cramped, it's loud, the waitresses aren't attentive...but it's so so good.  You don't come here for a slow, leisurely meal.  You come here to get full and go.\\n\\nWhat I love about this place so much is the generous portions of meat and the excellent prices.  My boyfriend and I usually leave incredibly full for around $20.  Some of our usual picks:\\n\\n-Sashimi & sushi combo ($8):  1 piece of salmon egg and 1 piece of chopped scallop sushi; 2 huge fat pieces of tuna sashimi, 2 fat pieces of salmon sashimi, plus 1 piece each of salmon/tuna/ebi sushi.  The nigiri sushi has a lot of rice-I usually pluck off about half of it so I don't get too full on filler.\\n\\n-Alaska roll ($4):  I'll admit, there is a LOT of avocado in this.  They put a lot of avocado in all their rolls, so be careful if you're ordering a lot of rolls with avocado in them-I'd try to stick with just 1.  The sauce they drizzle on top is Japanese salad dressing, and it's delicious.\\n\\n-Red roll ($5 I believe):  Chopped scallop on the inside, spicy tuna on the outside.  Great mix of sweet and spicy.\\n\\n-Spicy Tuna Sashimi ($8):  Very generous portion, super spicy-although every once in awhile I get a piece of tuna that isn't completely thawed.\\n\\n-Awesome roll ($8):  This roll used to live up to its name-stuffed with all kinds of meat and drizzled with 2 different sauces and a generous helping of fish flakes.  However the last few months, I've noticed when I order it that the base of the roll is really rice-heavy and usually sticks to the plate so the sushi falls apart when you pick it up.  Lately I've stopped ordering it.\\n\\nI highly recommend take out for this place, especially if you have a big group.  I foolishly decided to go with a group of 10 for dinner one day and waited over an hour.  Usually when I go as a pair, I get seated very quickly-groups of 3+ often have to wait longer for bigger groups to pack up or single tables side by side to leave."},{"name":"Sushi Oyama","address":"5152 Kingsway","city":"Burnaby","stars":"3.5","text":"Still terrible service.

She had ultimate patience and positivity for us during our cake tasting - which was amazing of her! This is star #1.\\n\\nShamane's history is pretty cool - serving gourmet meals in France on hot air balloons - wow! Definitely star #2!!\\n\\nHer ability to please our pickiness in relation to dietary restrictions was a HUGE plus. Gluten free? Yes indeed!! Though I personally ended up choosing an almond sponge cake made with wheat flour for my wedding cake, and let my gluten-sensitive husband get his own candied orange-dark chocolate-cheesecake. These were both great. The wheat-free option for the sponge cake was just not spongey enough for me, so I opted to get the better-tasting cake, even though my hubby wouldn't be able to enjoy it. That being said, it's great that she has the option for those who are gluten-sensitive. I'll give a half-star for that one - so now we're at 2.5.\\n\\nNext.... hellooo!!! Can you say local, seasonal fruits and veggies? The quiche and pies with yummy seasonal goodness really float my boat. Definitely a full star!! Up to 3.5!\\n\\nNow, the sad part.... for some reason the cake choices that my honey and I made didn't translate to Shamane... so on my wedding day, as I bit down into my almond sponge cake with champagne soaked strawberries, I was pretty disappointed when no almond flavor entered my subtle love-drenched taste palette. :( Bummer. She'd written it down wrong, and when my husband went over things with her and she said \\"Your wife wanted plain, right?\\" he didn't know to correct her. Forward to the wedding day.... I announce the flavors of the cakes to the crowd..... and then am a little confused that this cake I'm tasting tastes very different than the one I remember choosing! We were very thrifty for our wedding as well (budgeted under $5000!), and the cake was a big splurge for us. So.... sad face. :(  Minus one star!! Down to 2.5.\\n\\nNext sad part.... we ordered two chocolate cheesecakes, one with candied ginger and one with candied oranges. We literally could not tell the difference between the cakes! I swear that they were the same. We definitely asked many people in the crowd - it became a trendy question amongst the group. \\"Which cheesecake did you like?\\" \\"I don't know... which one was which?\\" Ah.... we ended up thinking that Shamane made a mistake and made two of one kind. She swore later that this was not the case, that she candied both the oranges and the ginger herself, and that they just taste very similar. Well... I gotta hand it to her, candying those things just for us... but we really couldn't tell the difference... perhaps this makes us appear to be less-than-taste-sensitive, but it was still a real bummer. Down to 1.5 Shamane!\\n\\nHowever... I'll add in another half star for her credit in handling the situation. At first, she did not want to offer us anything for our troubles, saying that she stood by her product and that our complaints were unfounded. Later she had a change of heart, and offered us $50 back for our troubles. This was a negligible amount of $$, however, it was the thought that counted for us. I was truly bummed by her semi-hostile attitude when we expressed our disappointment. We literally thought that she'd made a mistake and given us two ginger cheesecakes, and I fully remembered asking for the almond sponge cake (it took a while for us to figure out that the mix-up must've happened on the phone about that one). So, when she bawked and said that her products were awesome and that we should shut-the-f-up, basically, I was heart broken. Shamane! I had so much faith in you!! How could you do that?? But.... as I said, she had a change of heart, and while the $$ back that she sent us was nominal, it did soften the blow of our disappointment with her services. I'll tack a half-star back on for her credit: back up to 2.\\n\\nAnd, to end on a happy note, we were super satisfied with her cake decorations. I had a white two-tiered cake with brown branches and green leaved winding around it. The cheesecakes were dark brown with white vines on them in the shape of hearts, and more of the green leaves. They were beautiful, exactly what we wanted. Back up a star for that one - so now we're at 3.\\n\\nAnd I will leave it at that! Good luck, folks!

In a moment of meme-high inspiration, I put my crime partner's crazy 'fro wig on my head, tied a red bandanna around the fake hair, and ironed the phrases \\"Hide yo wife\\" and \\"Hide yo kids\\" onto a blank tank top. There were a lot of fun costumes at that party, and I got to take home a bottle of wine for my antics, er, efforts. That's what I remember most from Foster Burger. It has little to do with the restaurant and a lot do with me being a ringer for a wiry African-American man whose sister suffered a nasty bed intrusion.\\n\\nBut Foster Burger stealthily became a regular spot in the couple years following that party. If you want to kick back, drink a couple beers, and admire all the concert fliers on the walls inside or chill on the covered patio outside, it is a perfectly fine place to do so while eating burgers and fries. The fries are plentiful and fresh. The burgers, particularly the meat-free hemp patty, are filling and somehow fancier than what you might expect from a burger joint. Translation = they have pickled beets and caramelized onions, although the hemp burger might have tipped you off.\\n\\nI don't like how the extra things such as the beets and whatnot add up to make a six-to-seven dollar burger closer to ten bones. On top of that, although the beer selection is wide and reasonably priced, the cocktails are on the spendy side at seven to eight bucks a drink. That would not be too much of an issue except the pours are often weak, in my experience. For a humble burger joint, a double-digit meal reads like kind of a splurge. And although the food is good, it's like eh, do you really want your splurge meal at a really nice burger joint? Perhaps.\\n\\nAnyway, now that I have all the useful stuff out of the way, let me just say \\"You don't even have to confess, we gon' find you. So you can run and tell dat, homeboy.\\" Seriously.

I was surprise by how quickly it got to the table, excellent! The she-crab was really thick and creamy but I couldn't finish it - it was really good with the home-made biscuit though!! I think my favorite was the crab-cake. Normally you couldn't taste the crabs, just breadcrumbs but this one was really good with that sauce on the side. \\n\\nOur main entre was shrimps and scallop with grits and the Ribeye steak with frites - we actually got an insider there that said the Ribeye was the best on the menu... Now i've heard mad ravings on the fried chicken so I can't believe it until i come back to try that... But the ribeye steak was really juicy and tender - my friend loved it. The only problem was that they put the steak on top of the sweet potato fries and it made it soggy so my friend wasn't too happy about that. They had to get her some new fries.\\n\\nMy shrimps and scallop grits were really good. I thought the grits were a bit undercook or maybe it's just the way it is because the texture were a bit too grainy. But the flavor of the sauce and the perfect cook of the shrimps and scallops were amazingly good. \\n\\nI have to say that walking up the stairs to use the restroom was a bit frightful in 3 inch heels.

The main downside is that some of the food is not completely hot and doesn't taste as fresh as if it were cooked to order (such as over at Windsor Cafe, which you should try btw). Also, the staff with the carts could come across as pushy at times (do they get paid commission per plate sold?), and we found it impossible to decode pricing for each. After you agree to take one, they just mark the paper on your table and set off.\\n\\nSo we were pleasantly surprised when all the food that led to our bursting bellies only came out to around $11 per person! It's such a satisfying, social experience to be able to sample so many different foods and share with friends at such a minimal cost. The food quality may not be the highest, but the variety, authenticity, and experience certainly is!\\n\\nPro tip: Avoid the bathrooms if you would like to still have an appetite upon your return to the table.

The hush puppies were soft on the inside, crispy on the outside and went well with the jalapeno jelly they provided. Then the main event: the chicken. We began to forgive the long wait time after taking bites of that chicken. So flavorful and crispy, it was an amazing dish. The mac and cheese was perfect. Just enough cheese and a broiled top that made it such a perfect pasta dish. Ugh would order again forever. The sweet potato fries were your regular, run-of-the-mill fries so I wouldn't necessarily rush to order them again. I was pretty disappointed that the cornbread was dry but the mac and cheese and chicken and the mashed potatoes made me forget. \\n\\nThere was a ton left over, so we took it to our hotel for a second dinner.

For the amount of money you spend on entrees here it is hard to believe that the service is so bad. Here's a little picture of our experience. We had a reservation for 4 and were sat on time. Then our server came over and took drink orders. I was ordering a bottle of wine and wanted to get her opinion. Instead of sending over the sommelier, she suggested I try to two wines I was considering. It took nearly 20 minutes to get me these tastes - the rest of the table had already been served their drinks. As someone who was prepared to order a bottle, which costs 4 times as much as the cocktails, this was a bit frustrating. Once I finally got a taste I was told they couldn't open the other bottle. I didn't like the wine I tasted so we went with the other one. It was wonderful wine. Then we ordered appetizers and even after finishing them the waitress had to be summoned over to take our dinner order. All the food was just okay. The chicken was probably the best of the options. Those of us who ordered meat had to specifically ask for sharper knives because the butter knives were not cutting it (pun intended). A few of us ran out of water during the meal and had to flag someone to get more for us. We ordered a second bottle of wine because it was legitimately the best part of the meal. I was given a fresh glass to taste, but it wasn't clean. My friend pointed this out and the server huffed as it was taken back for a fresh one. When I confirmed the wine was good, no one else received a fresh glass, and in fact the new bottle of wine was simply poured into the glasses with wine already in them. Then we realized, at the end of the meal, that all the other tables had received bread - which no one even offered us. All around it was a sub-par experience.

When I first moved here from North Carolina, I was convinced I had arrived in a BBQ wasteland until I discovered Fox Brothers.  Then it seemed like everyone else discovered it shortly afterwards.  I judge a BBQ place by the pulled pork.  If they do that well, I will go back.  Everything else is a bonus.  Fox Brothers does the basics well, and scores in the bonus rounds.  \\n\\nThe pulled pork is always smoky, well-seasoned, and rarely dried out.  I enjoy it without sauce most of the time.  The sauce, however, is slightly sweet and thinner than most local BBQ sauces.  The dominate spice seems to be brown sugar, but I haven't been able to identify everything so far.  They have struck on a good blend that doesn't overpower one way or another.  The meat is smoked onsite.  The cooking method is unrushed and doesn't dry out the meat.  This is the way it should be done.  Other BBQ joints in the ATL need to take notice.\\n\\nThe wings are worth noting.  They smoke them for hours, before tossing them in their house hot sauce. (I'm not sure if they are fried briefly before this or not) They only come one way, which is spicy enough to satisfy me but not too much to scare off light weights.  The meat will literally melt off the bones.  The brisket is also a solid choice.  They make a \\"house burger\\" that consist of brisket topped with bacon, pimento cheese, and hot sauce that sounds heart wrenching, but tastes delicious. \\n\\nMost sandwiches come with one side item, I usually get fries.  They changed the fries a while back from basic crinkle cut that were coated with the house spice rub, to a thinner cut spiced with garlic salt.  It improved an already good thing.  Some of the other sides are well worth trying.  The mac-n-cheese is good, and sometimes they serve it deep fried as an appetizer.  The collards and fried okra did the job, but don't stand out.  \\n\\nI've never had a bad meal here, but on more than one occasion I have had bad servers.

I have had some fantastic food here (the squid ink pasta, and the pork belly) but they also change their menu up so I was disappointed to find some of my favourites gone (like the squid ink pasta). \\nThis is tapas style so the portions are smaller than entree portions but you're meant to order more than one thing, even though they're not actually designed to be easy to share (I mean try sharing the crispy pork belly, it's just a mess).\\n\\nThe problem with this restaurant is that you get a totally different experience depending on where you are seated. When I was seated in the front of the restaurant, under the greenhouse roof, it was a wonderful experience. It was quiet and beautiful, and I had a really lovely meal. When I was seated in the middle booths, it was dark and I literally could not see what I was eating. At several points during the meal, I had to turn on the flashlight on my iPhone just to see what was on the plate. It's also quite loud and crowded near the bar/kitchen area. When I was seated at the back of the restaurant, in front of the kitchen, it was a nightmare. The smoke from the kitchen was suffocating, I could literally see it hanging over the area when I came out from using the restroom. It got so bad towards the end of the meal that our entire party quickly finished our meal and left because we were coughing from the smoke.\\n\\nIf you are going to have an \\"open-concept\\" kitchen, you need to invest in really good ventilators. REALLY good ventilators, do you hear me management? This is serious. Otherwise, all the smoke and fumes from the kitchen are just hanging out in the restaurant area at the back, and it is a really, really unpleasant experience.\\nI am only giving this 3-stars because the food is good and I had a pleasant experience when I was seated at the front of the restaurant. Please fix whatever is going on with your kitchen ventilation system for the sake of the customers that have to be seated in the back (where you have the majority of your seating area)."},{"name":"Shanghai Social Club","address":"1277 Commonwealth Ave","city":"Allston","stars":"3.5","text":"Went here about 3 weeks ago and was pleasantly surprised.

We have eaten sushi all over the world and are quite particular.  For an area known for food, we were having an awful time finding an appropriate sushi place.  Then one day my wife phoned me at the office and announced she had found it!  We've been coming to Oishi regularly ever since.\\n\\nThe itamae is fanatical about the freshness of the fish he serves.  Consequently, Oishi does not have every fish that you've ever heard of, but the fish that he has are invariably perfect.  Also, he brings in small quantities of special offerings from time to time.  Watch the marker board at the end of the sushi bar for specials.  I have eaten at Oishi several hundred times (no exaggeration) and I have never had a piece of fish that was off in any way. \\n\\nThe itamae also takes maki seriously.  If you are looking for garbage rolls oozing mayonnaise and bologna, Oishi ain't your place.  But for well thought out, meticulously crafted maki using mostly traditional ingredients (but yes, you can still get standbys like Philadelphia rolls), you will be hard pressed to find a better place.\\n\\nNew to the menu is ramen.  I was slow to try it as I'm drawn to the sushi.  But at lunch a couple of weeks ago I ordered traditional soy flavor ramen - just to see what the Oishi take on ramen was like.  I expected it to be good.   But I wasn't prepared for it to be spectacular.  Next time I order it I will take a photo and post it on this or another review.  It is beautifully crafted and the flavor is exquisite form the traditional Japanese pork belly to the perfectly boiled egg.  And the texture of the noodles is spot on.   \\n\\nOishi is very clean and decorated in a spare, classic style.  The waitstaff is very attentive and efficient.  The kitchen is extremely consistent.  Tempura and other cooked items are the same every time.  I am ashamed that I can only give Oishi 5 stars."},{"name":"Christopher's","address":"1920 Massachusetts Ave","city":"Cambridge","stars":"3.5","text":"This place is a little on the pricey side for a pub.

Italian restaurants are a dime a dozen in Boston, yet Pazzo sets itself apart with  Mediterranean-Italian offerings that are unlike anything else in the city. \\n\\nStarters include the likes of grilled artichokes, FOUR kinds of carpaccio and frito mixto- a crispy mix of calamari, rock shrimp, bacala and green beans. We sampled their arancine last night, deep fried balls of saffron risotto that was crispy on the outside and with gooey mozzarella inside. The Terrine Napolentana was a wonderful twist on the classic Caprese, featuring layers of tomato, mozzarella and basil layered between slices of bread drizzled with balsamic vinegar (kind of like a savory and cold bread pudding... sounds odd, but its really quite tasty). \\n\\nEntrees were both substantial and delicious. My favorite was the herbed ricotta gnudi (pronounce \\"nudie\\"), which are ricotta dumplings that come atop a bed of wild mushrooms and duck sugo. The dumplings were light and well complimented by the mushrooms and duck- a terrific mouth feel.  The wild boar bolognese was also particularly good, featuring a hearty ragu over penne pasta. The only thing I didn't love was the spice crusted tuna, which I thought was overpowering My dining companion, however, loved it, so that may be a matter of personal taste. \\n\\nI also really appreciate the fact that while Pazzo offers excellent food and more than ample portions (a pasta dish could easily be shared by two people, or counted on for leftovers), their prices are totally reasonable. The vast majority of their entrees come in under $20, while appetizers, antipasti and stuzzichini hover around $10.\\n\\nPazzo's website isn't up yet, but should be soon.

And I just KNOW that nice restaurants who are always busy as it is, want nothing more than to have a table of 9 right smack in the middle of their dinner shift!

But I settled for my old stand-by:  Fried Green Tomatoes and the Crab Cake.  If you're a newbie, I totally recc the Fried Chicken - that's what they're known for.  We had NO complaints at the table and had a few orders of the chicken, a market fish of the day, a duck, and a pork chop.  The pork chop is smoked and served with lady peas - YUM.  But no matter which dish you get, you need to get the side of mac n cheese or the side of mashers (the BEST).  One thing we ordered last week that I had never had was the kale and it was OUTSTANDING!

We ordered pretty much a bit of everything. tonkotsu shoyu, dipping noodles, house sake, almond pudding (got the last one, suckas! just kidding).

My husband and I arrived just as they were opening on a weekday evening. \\n\\nThe restaurant is clean and sparse. Not a whole lot of decor to cluttter it up, but then again, not enough to warm it up either. We (being the first to arrive) were seated immediately and found that the restaurant had a strange, acrid smell. After a few moments my husband recognized the smell as pipe - I am assuming that maybe someone was smoking a pipe in the back before they opened for business and it lingered. Not a big deal, but I hate the smell of any kind of tobacco so it was unpleasant to me. \\n\\nThe waiter was friendly and attentive, though a little awkward. When I asked about Black Tobiko (since I am only familiar with the orange kind) he stared at me as if I had three heads and said, \\"It's a different kind of tobiko.\\" Since then I have learned that Black Tobiko is just regular tobiko colored with squid ink - in case anyone else was wondering. \\n\\nThe menus were shabby and frankly made me a little nervous. I am not one of those people who need to eat off of gilded spoons for things to taste good but when it comes to Sushi, freshness and hygiene is paramount since you're consuming raw product. So, when a restaurant is skimping on decor and offering shabby menus with wrinkled paper inserts, I worry about other corners they might be cutting. \\n\\nWe decided on the 3 by 3 (I think it was called) which was three pieces each of the popular salmon, tuna and yellow-tail sushi. I liked that they had that on the menu, they happen to be three of my favorites and it was convenient to order an entree rather than choosing individually. We ordered two of those, the Mango Maki and the Seared Yellow-tail Maki (Idon't remember the actual name of it). \\n\\nWe started with Miso soup and Edamame. Both were very good. Then came the sushi and let me tell you, I have never seen such big pieces of sushi in my life. They were very long slices of fish that hung over the rice by at least a half of an inch on each side. Great on the portion front, much more difficult on the eating front as fitting the piece in your mouth takes a little finesse and a lot of help from chopsticks. But after the first taste, believe me, I found a way to get the sushi in my mouth. It was delicious! The perfect temperature, sweet, and fresh. The mango maki was delightful and the maki topped with seared yellow-tail made me want to cry it was so good. \\n\\nThe meal came to $80 with tip for the two servings of 3x3, edamame, green tea and two maki. Not so cheap that I was dancing for joy, but definitely cheaper than New Ginza. Am I now a convert? I can't promise that - I definitely have a thing for fresh flowers and trendy decor - but I may have to forego the monogamous status I once shared with New Ginza."},{"name":"No Mas! Cantina","address":"180 Walker St SW, Ste B","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3.5","text":"Visited No Mas Cantina before a concert at the Mercedes-Benz stadium. Right away, due to the restaurant's proximity to the stadium, I'd warn people that it is a bit different when a major event is happening. The wait was between 30 and 50 minutes arriving at 6:30pm on a Saturday night before a Beyonce/Jay-Z concert, with a reduced menu of less than 10 items. The shortened menu lacked several items I would expect, for example, the only tacos served were fish tacos. No Mas does accept reservations through Open Table or over the phone, so I'd recommend making plans in advance for a busy night. \\n\\nNo Mas Cantina is in a fairly large building with a bar outside the restaurant, a small cafe, and an art shop. The main restaurant has two floors inside with an outdoor patio, overall capable of seating a few hundred people. We visited the bar and ordered the house margarita, which was tasty and strong, but took literally 20 minutes for the bartender to prepare, at a vey leisurely pace with several empty seats at the bar. \\n\\nOnce we were seated, our waiter, Tony (Anthony), was very nice, fun to talk to, and handled the fast-paced atmosphere of the pre-concert rush with ease. \\n\\nI ordered the Carnitas which were served with several small soft tortillas, guacamole, black beans, pico de gallo, and rice. I made my own small soft shell tacos from the mix and they were awesome! \\n\\nOverall, watch out for differences due to events at the stadium, the bar is slow, the drinks are tasty and strong, the food is phenomenal, and I'd love to come back when the full menu is being offered."},{"name":"Kung Fu Saloon","address":"716 West 6th St","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"Really?

Shrimp and grits was probably best, after that the catfish, brisket was so tender and flavorful, chicken on point, mac n cheese with crusty too and soft interior, and so on.

My friends and I were shocked. This had never happened to us before. I'm not saying we were totally sober (it was around 1am on a sat night) but we were no more drunk or sober than the rest of the people in the bar and we were totally by ourselves, and we were in well....a bar. We were not  loud, bothering other customers or  bartenders, or generally acting rude or like jerks. We were just shocked, it was like mom telling us to go to bed when we were being good kids. The bartender made an overzealous mistake and it ruined our time there. Maybe they had a drunken brawl in there the night before and they felt they needed to crack down on their customers."},{"name":"House of Blues Restaurant & Bar","address":"1490 E Buena Vista Dr","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"Delicious shrimp and grits!!!

We had a fairly decent meal in November--had its highs and lows, neither mind-blowing nor abysmal--so we (mostly me) decided to give it another try.\\n\\n\\nI did just fine.  Mostly cuz I recalled my previous impressions (apps were the high point, my meal was eh) so my order consisted of two apps and a single basic sushi roll.  I ordered Calamari (which they called 'T & T' for tentacles and uh who cares really?  Hand me the plate and go away) and some sorta loaded fry.  The sort of thing that's large enough to share, would slide down with a beer and you'd forget about.  Save for indigestion.\\n\\n\\nSadly, there appears to be a reason apps are better than meals here.  Meals = sit down, eat slow.  Meanwhile, Apps = ALCOHOL and $$$.  The minute our server (Michael M, or 'Mimi' if you read his straining-to-be-clever name tag) heard us ask for water instead of beer?  He wasn't happy.  We didn't ask for water because we were cheap.  We asked because we were PARCHED.  Oh--and we'd been gulping soda all day at the theme park at $7.50 for refills every 10 minutes.  \\n\\nSince B's order was a burger (translation:  Evil Meal), she had to wait a while before being served.  Which was awkward, since she wasn't into either of my apps.  But it was it worth the wait?  \\n\\nBrenda's a well-done kinda girl with burgers AND meat.  'No pink,' she said.  But perhaps a third of her burger was blushing maid pink.  The sort of food that can't be served without a specific request from someone well aware of the associated health risks.

He ducked his head down, averted his eyes and disappeared faster than Mariah Carey's high-note range on 'Good Morning America.'

Their faces begin to twitch just like when a dog hears a high pitch sound!   That always brings a sweet smile to my face.  But you know what?  I sort of feel their pain and confusion too because it is weird that a BBQ joint is at the forefront of the booming Red River live music zone.   I've come to Stubb's BBQ for many years, listened to all kinds of bands and musicians (The Killers, Pete Yorn, Monte Montgomery, Rebirth Brass Band, Psych Furs, SXSW, etc...) both inside and outside, but can only think of a handful of times (at best) that I've come down here to eat.  So let me review the music venue piece first and then let's hit the food thoughts.   \\n\\nAs far as a music venue, the place is split in to two categories:  1) Inside and 2) Outside.  The Indoors venue is interesting for me because it is a more \\"intimate\\" setting and you're right up close to the artists.  There's a bar just a few feet away too, so grabbing drinks is not a hassle.   The bad part is that the acoustics tend to be really bad.  The place is made of solid stone bricks, so the sound bounces like a pinball machine the just hurled 10 extra balls at you during the bonus round!  Hopefully they will fix that someday because I really do like the way it feels in there.  It's nearly identical to one of those \\"MTV Unplugged\\" sessions (I miss those, don't you?).  As for the Outside venue, it's exactly what you're familiar with in a medium size concert place.  The grass/dirt area has a bit of an incline, so the further back you stand, the better you'll see the stage.  Up front can get quite a bit jammed, so if you're not in to other people's sweaty bodies touching you or you have been drinking and have to go to the bathroom...steer clear of the front.  I usually stay back a ways, the bathrooms stalls are close and so is the bar!\\n\\nNow for the food, it pains me to say that as notorious as Stubb's BBQ is in Austin, their food just isn't anywhere near as infamous.  It's supposed to be \\"legendary\\" but I'm afraid that it's far from that.  The brisket I had was incredibly bland (what wood did they use?) and seriously lacking flavor.  Stubb's own sauce saved a little bit of the experience, but not much.  The sausage tasted way below par and chewy.  On the other hand, I did have their beans for a side and they were pretty deelish, but it's just a side-dish people!!  The food here is not worth the high price at all ($15.95 for 3 meats & 2 sides ~ouch~).  You'd think a place like Stubb's BBQ would embrace their notoriety  and serve up some good grub just like their good tunes!"},{"name":"Mai Wah","address":"18088 SE Mcloughlin Blvd","city":"Portland","stars":"3","text":"My boyfriend and I decided to go out to eat tonight, so we decided on Mai Wah for some quick yummy Chinese. Now I used to rave to everyone about Mai Wah, they have some seriously good food most of the time. We walked in to order takeout, and the girl working the front (who we had never seen before) took our order. We always share the same meal; combination plate of orange chicken, fried rice, and fried shrimp. This was probably our tenth timing coming here and ordering this. The girl told us no, that we can't order that. Um what? After we told her that we always order that, she proceeds to say that we \\"haven't ordered it from her before\\". She finally says that she can go back and ask the cook if he can even make that plate for us, and if he can it will be extra. She was very clearly annoyed that she had to go ask the cook. We say okay, never been charged extra but it's fine. She came back and said the cook can do it at no extra charge. Awesome, we paid our $10 and sat down and wait. She came back with our food, and we handed her a dollar for tip. My boyfriend asked if he could get a little container of teriyaki sauce. She complained that the cook will have to make a whole batch of teriyaki sauce just for us and that it will be extra too. She walks into the back and 10 seconds later comes back with cold teriyaki sauce that she just poured, and takes our dollar and said that will cover the teriyaki sauce. A dollar for a little container of teriyaki sauce? Oh well, we didn't tip since that was suppose to be the tip. At that point we left and I already knew we would not be coming back. We have always had decent to good service at Mai Wah but tonight was uncomfortable and I won't go back. \\n\\nWhen we got home, our orange chicken was soggy and not very good. To top it all off, my boyfriend got sick in the bathroom for about 10 minutes.

The venue itself is a bit tight inside but you are not really going for the ambiance you are going for the amazing brisket. Part of the experience is getting up early in the morning to go stake your spot in line. Austinites love to wait in lines. The wait took about 3.5 hours but the end result was worth it. I say if you have the time, definitely wait inline at least once as I think that is part of what makes Franklins Franklins. There were some abandoned camping chairs that you could snag to sit in while you waited. We brought a cooler full of beer and champagne to make mimosas and cornhole so we could pass the time. It is one large tailgate while you wait for BBQ. The owner or manager came out closer to 1030/1100 and thanked everyone for coming and poured shots of whiskey for people waiting. The BBQ is amazing but the entire experience of waiting in line is what puts Franklins above its competitors.

There's no excuse to leave people sitting there for over an hour for food. I don't blame the waitress either - she was very friendly and I could tell she was working hard - what else could she do? I felt bad for her everyone was complaining about waiting, wanting refills of drinks.. etc - and to her credit she kept a smile on her face the whole time. \\n\\nI've been here many times with my mom (but not recently) so I don't know if it's always like this now, or a night a bunch of people called in.. but the wait was just insane.

I tried it, I'm not generally a fan of haddock sandwich, so it seemed fine and she seemed to enjoy it. In place of the mozzarella sticks we got the broccoli bites.

I ordered the chicken fajitas and truly enjoyed my meal. The tortillas are thick and I thought they were great, and a general indicator of the good quality of food at No Mas! Cantina. I enjoyed my food and the environment a great deal. \\n\\nThings I didn't like: The service during a seemingly slow time of day (Thursday at 2pm) was not great. We waited for our check for about forty minutes. However, when the manager found out about this, she worked hard to speed up the process and even gave us coupons for our return. It was nice that she showed that she cared. In addition, it's a tight parking lot on dirt, not the easiest place to park at all. \\n\\nOverall, I think this is a great Mexican restaurant and I will 100% return.

Sahil G. and I went last night for dinner. We had a Groupon (I paid $15 for $30 worth of food and drinks!), and I couldn't wait to go, based on all the awesome reviews.\\n\\nWe got there around 7:45 and it was pretty full -- no open tables or seats at the bar. I think because of the Groupon deal, the restaurant was way more busy than the employees expected it to be, and the waitresses seemed a little frazzled. There was a nice waitress taking names, but she said we were more than welcome to sit at one of the longer, communal-style tables. We were STARVING, so we decided not to wait for a regular table. \\n\\nIt took a little while to get menus -- turns out no waitress had been assigned to us. No big deal, the table had an app/drink menu on it, so when the waitress finally came over with dinner menus we were able to order our beers/app. I got a PBR -- on draft, for $2.50! -- and Sahil G. got a Lone Star. we also ordered the fried mac and cheese. The beers came out very quickly, and it was cute that the waitress brought the bottle cap with the Lone Star so that Sahil could see his riddle. My PBR was very cold and delicious, perfect for eating BBQ.\\n\\nThe fried mac and cheese was awesome, but did not look how I expected! We got a \\"small\\" order, which was a basket with 5 fried cubes. It looks like fried tofu, but inside the very well-seasoned crust are a lot of hot, cheesy noodles. Yum!\\n\\nSahil G and I both decided to get the Soulfire Platter with 2 meats. These platters are ENORMOUS -- if we were any less hungry we definitely could have (and should have) shared one. For $15.95, these platters are a great value -- you get two meats, two sides, corn bread, and pickles. A TON of food. I ordered pulled pork and fried chicken wings with cole slaw and potato salad; Sahil ordered sliced brisket and babyback ribs with mac and cheese and collard greens.  When we go out to restaurants together, we always get completely different things so that we can maximize the variety of food that we get to try. We're cute, I know. \\n\\nThe food came out really quickly -- the waitress told me my fried wings would be about 15 mins, but I can't say we waited longer than 10 for both platters, and these things are PACKED with food. The pulled pork was very tender, and so was the brisket. The ribs were also cooked perfectly, and had a great smoky flavor. However, the highlight for me, meat-wise, were the fried wings -- the breading was salty and delicious, and the meat was DRIPPING with juice/fat. AMAZING. \\n\\nThe cornbread was really good, a perfect combo of sweet and savory, and very moist. The pickles were nice too, though I am not a huge fan of \\"bread-and-butter\\" style so I only had a couple. The cole slaw was good -- a little too much liquid, but perfectly seasoned, and not too sweet (I hate when cole slaw is too sweet, yuck!). I wasn't a huge fan of the collard greens, oh well. The two best sides, IMO, were the mac and cheese and the potato salad. The potato salad was made with red bliss, mustard, and pickles. AMAZING. And the mac and cheese was so cheesy, with some bbq chips crumbled on top. \\n\\nI highly recommend Soulfire. The beers are so cheap, and the food is very reasonably priced -- a great value, considering both the quantity and quality of the food you receive.

Ruby's is pretty good; Rudy's is good in a pinch; Sam's has always been hit-or-miss for me; Artz is great for ribs, not so much the rest; County Line is a chain and tastes like it; and stalwarts Green Mesquite and Iron Works just don't seem terribly special.  I love Lamberts, but only when I'm in the mood for some fancy nosh.\\n\\nWith all that said, I just happened to notice Franklin Barbecue burning all sorts of hotness flames on Yelp's home page today, and having gone far too long without a trip to Smitty's or Cooper's, I popped in for lunch.

I had the brisket sandwich and was pleasantly surprised when the very nice counterman (Franklin himself?) offered me a burnt end just to taste.  (And yes, the guys really are nice.)  I also got a pound of the pulled pork to go.  Now, I am well-aware that while Texas may have pork barbecue in the form of shoulder and ribs, pulled pork is more specific to places like North and South Carolina, so I was skeptical if it'd measure up.  It most certainly did, so much so that I scarfed down my takeout as soon as I got home!

(I don't know if they were *actually* sold out of everything, though the pork ribs and one other item were gone by the time I got there -- and I probably got the remainder of the pulled pork!)  I'd cut the guys some slack here: it's a new business that's gotten wildly popular almost immediately, and being a small-business owner myself I know it's hard to gauge supply and demand.  That goes triply so for a barbecue place, since you can't exactly just throw more meat into the smoker and have it ready in 20 minutes.\\n\\nOne last thing: the place is surprisingly easy to miss (the Franklin sign on the front of the Yelp review is much smaller in person), but look for the intersection of the I-35 access road and Concordia."},{"name":"Se7en Bites","address":"617 N Primrose Dr","city":"Orlando","stars":"4.5","text":"Haven't been in a while but my 2 previous trips were so good I had to write this.

Came here for dinner tonight with the fianc√© since I was craving ramen and San Antonio has no decent ramen. I've definitely been wanting to try Ramen Tatsu-Ya since it seems like it gets a lot of hype. We'd come here again to get our Ramen fix in Texas since it's the best we've had here, but it's not as good as the ramen we've had in San Diego. The ramen here was adequate enough to satisfy our cravings. \\n\\nI had the tonkotsu and I'd probably rate it a 3.5. My fianc√© and I both liked the mushrooms that came with it. The chashu portion was pretty skimpy though. It was just one small piece, but cooked pretty well. I'd expect a little more for the price. The noodles were alright, better than packaged ramen at least. The noodles were chewy and cooked well. I'm used to and I prefer the thicker cut ramen noodles though. The broth was a lot better than what I've had in San Antonio, but lacking compared to other ramen I've had. The broth was a bit lacking in flavor and it may have been because it was considerably more oily than what I'm used to. It was also a bit on the saltier side. It made my stomach feel a little uneasy to be honest. I appreciated that it was the milky type of broth though. I think it just needs some tweaking and the broth can be better. My fianc√© had the miso hot but I liked my tonkotsu more. His broth had vinegar or some kind of bitterness to it that I was not a big fan of. He didn't complain too much about it, but it wasn't the best spicy ramen he's had either. \\n\\nThe parking here wasn't too bad since it's in a plaza. We picked this location specifically based on parking since the other location is downtown. The line wasn't too bad on a Friday night. We probably waited 20-30 minutes which was a lot less time that I was expecting. I'm guessing the line wasn't bad because they have two locations now. The wait for the ramen wasn't long either and it came out pretty promptly, so no complaints there.\\n\\nOverall, my fiance and I would come to Ramen Tatsu-ya probably once or twice a month for our ramen fix when we are in Texas and craving a bowl.

Off to a great start :) Green tomatoes and goat cheese was next but im not a fan of goat cheese so I didn't like that hint of taste, however the green tomatoes were a mix of sweet and sour - which was surprisingly pleasant in my mouth. The pork salad for our other appetizer was also good - a bit heavy but the salad that surrounds it helps with the heaviness of the pulled-pork. The banana bread that was complimentary as got to be one of the best tasting ones I have had in my life! I had two :X I had the she-crab soup to myself and it was filling, a little too filling before my main course. The soup wasn't anything unique, but i opted in to ordering it from all the reviews about it. However, I did like the crab bits inside the soup. My main course was the fried chicken, mash potatoes and collard greens! and OMG, the fried chicken was perfection! the meat inside was still moist and the crispy layer outside was the perfect crispiness! The mash potatoes and collard greens were also very tasty! I am glad I ordered that and I highly recommend it. Along with our meals we also had sides: Brussel sprouts, kimchee veggie and polenta. The kimchee veggie was something I liked least because it tasted nothing like kimchee - tasted like they were trying to make their own fusion version. I did like the brussel sprouts and the polenta was a bit bland. For desserts, we shared the Upside-down pineapple cake, which was delicious and I highly recommend! The flavor was sweet and the sour of the pineapple was just a great combo, especially with the ice cream on the side.

There is probably not much to write about that hasn't already been written, but this review has been in the works for well over three years so I have that going for me.\\n\\nUpfront disclaimer: I only waited in line once in the 7 - 8 times I've had Franklin bbq in a three year time frame. I do not fall into the '4 hour line is an awesome experience' BS so many like to peddle. Lines for anything suck, and its not you, really. I don't want to stand next to strangers for three hours because I don't want to, is that a crime?\\n\\n2nd Disclaimer: I've had a good number of .lbs of bbq from all around Austin, Lockhart, and Elgin as well as my own brisket. In all honesty, I've eaten Rudy's far more than I should.... why? Because I can eat it within 30 minutes of thinking about it. Yeah, convenience is good when hungry. Should wanting some ones BBQ require more forethought than doing it myself? Probably not. Franklin's BBQ takes about half the time of doing it myself, for about triple the cost. Its an interesting and complex equation that I love to play every time we plan something that resembles a party. Not everyone is willing to put in the patience of smoking 9 - 12lb brisket. If you have no skill, then wait in line plebe.\\n\\nThe verdict: The Brisket is amazing. Its a little too salty, lacks spice/heat, really good smoke ring and flavor, but overall the brisket is awesome because of the superior cut of organic prime meat it started with. Its super moist, melt in mouth, but if you let it cool a little, it does not reheat and loses some lustre that a better rub could overcome. Is it the best brisket in the country? I don't know. Is it the best in Texas. Hell yes. Does that make it the best in country since Texas is king of the Brisket. I guess so. Will it last forever? no. Aaron is already scaling up, and at some point smoking only prime packer cuts from an organic farm in Kansas can only expand so much - at some point business will be business. \\n\\nAlternative: the pork ribs are amazing and totally underrated. These are some of the best ribs ever served, and people need to pay attention. The rub has some heat, and tenderness is perfect. Maybe the quantity he cooks is still low enough, but the ribs are better than his current brisket. \\n\\nconclusion: 3 years ago, just a few bites of Franklin rang the bells of heavens gate - but he also set in motion a standard that has been quickly matched by some new start-ups as well as amateurs. Skip the line, follow the oak smell on your block, and make friends with the neighbor who knows the difference between choice, angus, and prime.

The fried chicken was a delight and the mashed potatoes were delicious. The collared greens were too bitter for my liking, i'm assuming the flavor is an acquired taste. One thing that it really unique to this restaurant is that they have an organic food menu that is changed weekly depending on what is available through the local growers. I ordered the sauteed broccoli with melted butter and cheese. OH MY GOD, this dish was AMAZING. I love broccoli, and am usually pretty picky as to how it's prepared. This tasted so great and flavorful.\\n\\nThe second time I came to the restaurant I opted to order for take out which was a great idea--didn't have to wait as long for tables to be available! I ordered the Catfish with mashed potatoes and macaroni & cheese. The catfish was fried so nicely and had very great flavor. The mashed potatoes were once again delicious and the macaroni & cheese had a unique flavor, as it wasn't the traditional cheddar cheese that was used. \\n\\nAll in all, I would come here again. Depending if I was in a time crunch or not, I would either wait or order out. My recommendation to others who are inclined to try Screen Door is to be mindful of what time you go. I would recommend around 5 or 6pm on weekend evenings to get passed the weekend rush."},{"name":"Mai Wah","address":"18088 SE Mcloughlin Blvd","city":"Portland","stars":"3","text":"Absolutely the worst experience we've ever had dining here.

I've heard that after dinner time it turns into a shithole that smells like A&F cologne--but, that it has good food. So, some friends and I made a trip over there on Sunday afternoon. It was pretty empty when we got there, so I was optimistic.  Unfortunately, it fell short on most everything service-wise.\\n\\nThe waitress came over and brings us drinks--then promptly tells us their fryer is down. I'll be honest, I'm not totally sure how a restaurant functions when the fryer is down. I wanted to get a burger originally, but this put that to rest. Couldn't get wings either. So, I went with carnitas tacos. My friends got the lasagna, turkey reuben and Joe's Special.\\n\\nAfter about 30 minutes we still didn't have our food, despite there being virtually no one else in there. The reason from the waitress was \\"we didn't even have a cook until an hour ago\\"...this logic made no sense to me. But, she was nice about it. \\n\\nEventually, our food showed up. The tacos were the definition of average. Nothing special, not much flavor and not nearly sufficient enough for a meal. My friend's review of the lasagna was that it was very average, nothing special as well. It was a large meal though, so he was at least full I think. Turkey reuben looked good--but (noticing a theme?) not enough for a meal. The review for Joe's Special had to wait--it came out after the rest of us had finished eating. They picked up the tab for this meal, but it was still annoying.  For what it's worth--he said it was really good.  From a distance it looked like a big mess on a plate.\\n\\nOverall, based on this only experience Club 185 only gets 2 stars. Service was terribly slow, and borderline incomplete. I will certainly try it again, though. I've heard it's much better than this. I hope it is."},{"name":"ADios Cafe","address":"180 Walker St SW, Ste D","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4.5","text":"Food was awesome.

Holy mother of all things culinary- the flavors!!!! Pasta was cooked to perfection with JUST the right amount of bite. The arugula pesto gave it such a nice level of spice that grew with eat bite, the pulled rabbit lent a nice (slightly gamey) flavor and was beyond tender... but the surprising loveliest accent to this dish was the walnut that added a hint of nuttiness to the entire dish in bursts. \\n\\nMy husband had the springer mountain chicken. The fry on it was delicious, although the chicken in spots was a little tough/borderline dry. Flavor was A++++...Like, I didn't even know I could like fried chicken this much. Mashed potatoes were yummy with the drizzle of flavor packed sweet and savoury sauce... but the real shocker for me was the collard greens. I HATE collard greens. I've tried them probably 30 different times, and each time I've almost spit them out... but these collard greens have converted me. I will probably only ever eat them at this establishment.

While I'm far from the expert that that blogger and others are, I've had my share of Central Texas BBQ, having sampled the goods from over a dozen of the top tier joints in the area, including Lockhart, Luling, Taylor, Elgin, Giddings and Lexington. But when FCG gave this place it's first 6 star rating, I knew that this must be a very special place, and wow, it is indeed the pinnacle of quality BBQ. For now. :)\\n\\nWe arrived on a Sunday morning around 9:20AM or so, having gotten our wires crossed thinking that it opened at 10:00AM. Our band of six found ourselves at the head of the line, and even had some time to chat with Aaron Franklin, the owner and BBQ deity. By 10:00AM, there were probably 50 people in line, and by the time the doors opened at 11:00AM, there were closer to 100. Yes, 100 people lined up at 11:00AM on a Sunday for BBQ. \\n\\nAs we made our way inside the new permanent building (the days of the cart are over), we observed Aaron deftly unwrapping the very first brisket of the day. It had a rich, dark bark, and when he began slicing it, we knew that there was serious potential here. The knife was gliding through effortlessly, and a distinct smoke ring appeared around the luscious looking meat. When I asked for some fatty, and some lean, he held up the cut brisket with both parts still attached, and it was obvious that even the lean was going to be very moist, so we went with just a small sample of the fatty end. I also asked for 4 bones of pork ribs and some sausage to finish off our \\"meal\\" (well, that and a few slices of bread). Our crew isn't into sides; we're at least THAT hard core. :)\\n\\nMoving to the table, the six of us gazed in wide wonder at the joy we had found, and after distributing our butcher paper \\"plates\\", we began to dig in. If there was even the slightest disappointment, the sausage wasn't as flavorful as some I've had at other places, and didn't have as much of the loose, coarse grind as is found in other Central Texas sausage derived from the old Czech and German roots. Mind you, it wasn't bad at all, just not the best I'd ever put in my mouth. \\n\\nThe ribs and brisket, on the other hand: Words fail me. I have never had any BBQ product, from any vendor, that tasted as good as this brisket and these ribs. The ribs were done just right, needing just a tug to release from the bone (but not the overcooked \\"falling off of the bone\\" stage). They had a very smoky and almost sweet taste, with tender, juicy meat that required nothing but eating. I know Franklin has some good sauces, and I even tried a little by itself, but I wasn't about to put any of it on this meat. And as for that brisket: Wow. No utensils at all were needed, the meat came apart with ease, but was not overdone. And that flavor - superb. Absolutely superb. Great smoke, very moist, tender texture and that delicious bark was peppery without being overboard. If there's a way to improve on this meat, honestly, I don't know how you would do it. It literally is as good as it gets. This was the seventh BBQ joint that we'd eaten at in 3 days, and the six of us demolished 2 lbs of brisket, four large pork ribs and a decent amount of sausage in 10 minutes, leaving nothing but bones. It was the clear winner over all that we'd had. \\n\\nAs for the logistics of the place, if you've read some of the less favorable reviews of this place, you know that they don't serve food all day. They cook what they can, start selling it at 11:00AM, and when it's gone, it's gone. This is the way BBQ works. When we passed back by at 1:30PM that afternoon, it was all gone. We don't know when it actually ran out, but it's telling that it took less than 2.5 hours. If you want some of this stuff (and you do, I assure you), plan accordingly. Be in line at or before 11:00AM. There's not a ton of parking, and there's not a ton of seating, so it's a bit of work. But if you do get your lips around some of this BBQ, you'll forget about that. In fact, you may even forget your name, but you will NOT forget Franklin Barbecue."},{"name":"The Cowfish Sushi Burger Bar","address":"Universal Citywalk - Orlando, 6000 Universal Blvd","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"This was one of the worst service experiences I've ever had.

I live in New York, so it was refreshing to get a sandwich with a side for $6.95.

In fact, the last time I was in there with a group, we ordered one of every side to go with almost every main dish, trying almost the entire menu - and there wasn't a morsel of food left on anyone's plates. Some standouts include those lemon-glazed sweet potatoes, dill carrots, chicken & dumplings, catfish, fried chicken, meatloaf, pork chops, mac & cheese - basically the entire menu is fully of standouts. You can't go wrong ordering anything there. \\n\\nThe one tip I have is to order everything a la carte and skip the \\"family style\\" option where they pick the sides to go with your mains.

However, the corn pancakes were out of this world. Cooked perfectly, you get three small, fluffy pancakes served with a sweet glaze on top of the creamy spread. It comes with sweet peppers, and a great surprise of popcorn. At first I thought it was a cheap gimmick to make the food feel quirky, but the popcorn actually works really well to balance out the sweetness of the cakes.

I was like, \\"OMG! This is gonna be so awesome--not having to worry\\". Went ahead and made the vegan meal reservations and got 2 tickets. Easy peasy, right?\\n\\nThe day comes and I'm so ready for it, we get seated and the server comes out. Because you can't be too sure, I double check with her to see if she knows that we have the two vegan meals (it saves all of us time) and she says, \\"now I do, thanks\\". We get the drinks and the show starts. \\n\\nWhen the appetizers come out the servers asks if we want soup or salad (which she's offering to everyone) and again I double check \\"the soup is vegan?\\", she says yes. I get the soup and my partner gets the salad--that way we can just share and have both. What does she offer him for the salad? Ranch dressing or Italian dressing (this is a red flag for me because ranch isn't vegan), so he picks the Italian--no big deal.\\n\\nAs I start eating my soup, what do I taste? Cheese! There's freaking cheese in this \\"vegan\\" soup. Great, now my stomach is going to kill me for the rest of the show and the server lied to me. I give it to her and change it for a bunch lettuce with Italian dressing.\\n\\nOut comes the meal and what do we get? Undercooked pasta with a few lightly seasoned vegetables, how great! It was just not what I was expecting at all. I appreciate the thought but if I'm paying the price I did for this experience, please don't give me something undercooked. Or that's lacking flavor. Or that I could've made better at my house with about $5! This was so disappointing. The pasta was hard, the veggies weren't good. Like I said, it wasn't what I was expecting at all. Shall we move on to dessert?\\n\\nSO the desserts come out and the server brings out these like GORGEOUS looking sponge cake that just look delicious. But again, she's giving them out to everyone. So I get out of my seat, walk over to her and ask her that annoying question one more time, \\"is the dessert vegan?\\", she says \\"no, I'll get you yours now\\". She comes over, takes the cakes and leaves. When she comes back, what does she bring? A bowl of CANNED FRUIT as my dessert. Are you kidding me? You're not even giving me fresh fruit? At that point I was just over all of it.\\n\\nTo recap: for my time here, here's what I got with my vegan reservation: a bunch of lettuce with Italian dressing after being give a cheesy \\"vegan\\" soup, undercooked pasta with a few veggies, and canned fruit all while enjoying a pretty awesome show. Not fun!\\n\\nI don't like that when I made my reservation and bought my tickets I was made to believe like I wasn't going to have to worry about any of this and I was just gonna be able to enjoy the show. On top of that, I don't like that what I got as my meals was something I literally could have made at home for 4 for $15, which is not what I paid for my tickets. Very, very, very disappointed in the whole thing.\\n\\nThe only reason I'm giving them 2 stars was because the show was entertaining and I enjoyed it (ven throughout the whole chaos going on with the food). The show is great, it's very interactive. You get to scream, shout, stomp your feet, raise your beer and it's a load of fun. The actors were pretty awesome too!\\n\\nI don't think I will be sailing away with the pirates again any time soon.

The baked BBQ beans were alright but nothing amazing. The gumbo was a let down (yes! It was but I'm not a gumbo connoisseur.) The zucchini salad (under the summer veggies menu) should've been renamed radicchio salad bc it was more radicchio than zucchini noodles and I just wasn't a big fan of the sheeps milk dressing. Cornbread was alright though nothing to write home about.\\n\\nSomething else that was really great was our waiter. He was so kind, helpful, and all around positive guy.

We were seated around 6:15 or 6:20 and the food didn't come out until 7 or 7:05. That's just wrong.\\nSecondly the restaurant is annoyingly and stupendously noisy.

I never knew that fried chicken could be pretentious, but this was. What came to me were two pieces of what almost seemed like quail legs they were so small/dark and the entire thing was a bit too greasy. To accompany the chicken were cucumbers, potatoes, red chili, and buttermilk-mustard. The vegetables were good and you could definitely tell they were from a local garden, though the potatoes though varied (purple and white) were a bit undercooked and hard.\\n\\nThe thing that saved this meal? The dessert. It's really hard to order something when it isn't fully described on the menu, but I got the Chocolate, Milk, Soy and mygosh it was amazing.

It's good, maybe a 3 to 4 star BBQ good, but 4+ hours in line to watch other people ahead of you in line eat is definitely a description of a very poor experience. Read through the reviews, the bad as well as the good....3...4....5+ hour wait times....it is not an exaggeration. When you drive up you will see the people with their folding chairs already camped out like they were waiting for the Thanksgiving parade or the Superbowl or something like that. It's really an unbelievable thing to see when you are there. The Photos do not truly describe the excruciating wait. The first day we arrived, we were a little late...the line was soooo long it looked like they were giving out free food or something like that. So, we had to give up because we knew there was a decent chance that even if we did wait, certain items would be sold out (YES, they sell out!!!), so you could be waiting for 4-5 hours to only get to the counter and they will tell you \\"sorry, sold out!!!\\" We were not going to risk it. Thanks to Yelp, we were able to find another high ranked BBQ place just a couple of blocks down with lines as well, but not Disneyland Space Mountain long as to scare you away. 40 minutes and we were eating some yummy food. \\n\\nWe were determined though to taste the \\"best BBQ\\" at Franklin's and came back the next day super early and were able to snag places in line that looked much more reasonable. In the end it probably was about the same because we were there way before opening...~sigh~....when it was about our time to order, I realized that they really take their time...and not in a good way...that is why it takes so long for the line to move. They seem in no hurry to get their customers food and on their way, what a waste. And of course the most important part of the experience and the review...the food...it was....hmmm...good...not 4 hours good, but not bad. I think any sane person would think if you had to wait half or more of your work day for any meal that it should be one of the best things you ever ate...and quite honestly it isn't. We got comparable BBQ the day before and did not have to wait as long to get it. There were others at tables near us saying about the same thing. \\"we waited for this?...\\" If you are jobless (there were alot of students...lol), have good book to finish reading, or just have nothing useful in life to to do...then I guess standing in a line for half a day is okay.

How long did we wait?\\n4 hours and 15 minutes. We arrived at 6:45 am and were the second party in line. Within 5-10 minutes, several other individuals congregated behind us. The couple that stood at the front of the line arrived at 6:00 am. The wait itself was long but pleasant. We sat in lounge chairs, talked with other customers in line, and drank beers. People around us brought coolers, games, and other activities. \\n\\n2. What should you get here? \\nWe ordered a portion of each of the meats, and while we enjoyed our entire BBQ order, the fatty brisket outshone the rest and was the clear favorite of everyone in our group. The turkey was also surprisingly tasty. The sides offset the enormous amounts of meat we ordered but none were remarkable. \\n\\n3. Other notes\\n- The earlier you arrive, the better. Not only will you secure a lawn chair, which are limited in quantity, but you will also wait generally less than those who arrive later. Since the staff members cut your meat in front of you, it takes awhile to receive your food even once you make it into the restaurant. Those who arrived at 7:30 am still hadn't placed their orders by 12:15 pm. \\n- Dessert pies are offered for those with a second stomach: bourbon banana, pecan, key lime, and lemon chess.

I was born and raised in Boulder and lived just down Baseline from the Dark Horse for 26 years -- it's my favorite restaurant, my favorite bar, my favorite place. I went to a friend's birthday party here when I was five -- and there were even more crazy naked murals then!! There's nothing like the Dark Horse, it's impossible to explain, you have to check it out. \\n\\nThe Good:\\nThe Dark Horse is a huge, haunted, one-of-a-kind, divey, dark, eclectic, historic, dive bar and burger joint. Karaoke Nights is awesome, and Tricycle Night is legendary. There's a million TVs to watch the game, and it sure can get rowdy. Play some pool, foosball, air hockey, wander upstairs to check out the chilly, haunted bar up there (there's three bars at the Dark Horse), get lost, and laugh at your friends (and/or yourself) when they go in the wrong bathroom. \\n\\nThe Bad:\\nnot the cleanest bathrooms\\n\\nThe Food:\\nI've been going to the Dark Horse for 26 years and all I've ever gotten is the Jiffy Burger. The one, the only, the epic, melted-peanut-butter-bacon-cheeseburger with a side of kinda-curly, never-hot, maybe-undercooked fries. I love every single second of it, every single time.  I've literally never eaten a different meal there -- if I'm at the Dark Horse, i'm getting my Jiffy Burger -- it's the only place you can get it!! If you get the Jiffy Burger -- GET THE JIFFY BURGER -- you'll need approximately a million napkins, and obviously a local draft beer.\\nThe ambiance is amazing. Unlike many trendy/hipster/hippie/Boudler-y restaurants and bars, the Dark Horse is a dive bar and proud of it. It's grungy, gritty, haunted, and awesome. \\n\\nThe Service:\\nOrder at the counter and they holler your name over the intercom (use the most unusual name in your group) and you pick up your food where you ordered it. Bar service has always been great --- the back bar used to be cash only but  now they take cards. \\n\\nOverall:\\nMy favorite place in the world."},{"name":"Kusina sa Gulong","address":"5205 SE Foster Rd","city":"Portland","stars":"3","text":"Place is pretty good.  loved the platter! awesome job well done"},{"name":"Fox Bros.

I needed to go, now!  Needless to say, I love southern food and came in with extremely high expectations.   \\n\\nWe started with the biscuits, of course.  These oversized carb bombs came with a side of cinnamon butter and pimento cheese.  These were the best parts of the biscuit.  The biscuit itself was extremely \\"bready\\" and too chewy to be considered a southern biscuit.  The honey glaze gave the biscuits an even more chewy texture topped off with sea salt that was overpowering.  I love creativity in the kitchen, but as a southern restaurant, the biscuits have to be on point and these missed the mark.  \\n\\nNext we sampled the Suckling Pig Fries.  These were nothing short of amazing.  Poutine gravy, cheddar cheese curds, cayenne pork rinds and horseradish all beautifully married over the top of perfectly cooked fries.  This dish was savory, spicy, and very filling.  My wife and I easily could have put down a second order.  \\n\\nThe fried chicken wings came next.  Honestly, I think we screwed up here.  It was listed under the buttermilk fried chicken and was one of three options.  We opted for wings over the boneless thighs or half chicken.  The wings came out and were obviously just fried wings, not buttermilk fried chicken.  We had our choice of plain, Nashville, Sweet and Spicy, or White BBQ.  We went with sweet ands spicy.  One, there no spice.  No tingle.  No hit of heat.  The sweet was non-traditional.  It reminded me of a tangy vinaigrette.  The wings were saved by asking for side order of the White BBQ sauce. This sauce was phenomenal.   If I had to do it again, I would get the half chicken, Nashville style, with  side of White BBQ.  \\n\\nLast came our Cast Iron Duck Confit and Dumplings.  The duck and veggies were immaculate.  This was the perfect dish on a crisp fall evening.  The duck was decadent and melted in our mouthes.  This dish would have been a real winner but the dumplings were overcooked (one was burned) and they were dry.  There was no hint of moisture.  They were so overcooked and crusty that they couldn't absorb any of the fats or juices from duck or veggies.  Similar to the biscuits, if you are going to do southern cooking, you've got to nail the dumplings.  \\n\\nThe staff was pleasant and very helpful.  They asked lots of questions about our meal and our experience/feelings about the food.   The bar was stocked with lots of bourbon and has lots of cocktails that won't disappoint.  \\n\\nI am unsure if I will be back to B and B.  I definitely want to give it another chance because the chef nailed the duck and the suckling pig.  I want to give the 1/2 fried Nashville chicken a try.

I have seen all the bad press about the dress code issues and profiling that went on.  Not cool - so I avoided it and I really just never hang out on that side of downtown too.

You would think that at those prices a pitcher would contain at least 5 glasses, but it really did not look like it. It's really more of a carafe than a pitcher. \\nAnyway, we ordered the fried green tomatoes to share, my friend ordered the chicken and waffles, and I, of course, ordered the King Biscuit, since it was (unknowingly) what I came for!

Our waiter was fairly punctual considering the restaurants capacity from the ongoing street fair. We started our meal by first splitting this amazing appetizer of roasted fingerling potatoes submerged in a blended cheese sauce and generously topped with bacon. This made for an incredible dip for our remaining bread and if I had it my way I would have hogged this deconstructed Italian baked potato for myself. \\n\\nThe wine list was pretty small but had outstanding bottle prices, so I ordered a bottle of Montepulciano for only $18! If you want to bring your own bottle the corkage fee is still very reasonable at only $12. The wine lasted well throughout our meal considering their use of the traditional tiny glassware. For my entree I ordered a special that night of spaghetti with manila clams, basil and bacon. First off the portion was more like a lunch special and for $13 I expected a bit more. Next I was put off by the ingredients which looked as if they had been hit with a micro-ray before service. Everything was small, unexciting, bland and there was virtually no sauce. If you're going to charge $13 for a classic dish at least make it worthy. This looked more like the remains of a Subway artist's counter pushed into a bowl.

BUT this was the wish of the Birthday Boy, so here I found myself.\\n\\nTheir non-seafood offerings are slim to be sure, but they have a couple of chicken dishes.  I opted for the Chicken Marsala and it was very well presented and prepared.  Nothing real special about it.  The seafood dishes that were scattered across our table looked very good, and I didn't hear any complaints.\\n\\nOur server looked a little like Brian Doyle-Murray and had similar mannerisms.  He was adequate in his ability to serve a large group, but forgot some things here and there (we had to ask three times for water and bread, drink orders were mixed up as well as salad orders).\\n\\nI felt the ambiance of the place was warm and inviting if somewhat crowded on a Friday night\\n\\nThe price point for the service and food was a little high, even by Portland standards.

It was the number one thing to do while visiting Austin. The husband did his research and we decided on doing the pre-order option (min. 5 lbs meat order) so we could enjoy our time versus spending 3-5 hrs in line.  \\n\\nThere are 3 parking spots for pre-orders and it's located in the back where the trailer is for pickup. So no, you don't go to the storefront to pick up your order. I mean how rude would that be to gloat at every single person in line that's waited for hours while you just walk straight up and get your food.

Doesn't completely fall off when you pick up the ribs.\\nBrisket - nice smokey flavor, but it falls apart when you pick it up. Kind of like it's melted off your fingertips.\\nTurkey - actually my favorite. I feel like the turkey has been overlooked in some of the reviews and videos we've researched. Nice peppery rub, tender, and juicy slices. I made a sandwich out of it. So good!\\nSausage - Also very good. I'm not a huge fan of sausages or franks, but took 2 bites and loved the flavor, the juiciness, and spices combined.\\nThe slaw and the potato salads are okay, not the best I've had but helps with all the meat you'll be having.  \\n\\nWe took all of that and went to a park and enjoyed a picnic. It was a beautiful spread. We obviously couldn't finish 5 lbs of meat between the two of us, so we packed everything back to our Airbnb and the host allowed us to use their freezer.

If you're going to freeze the meat and bring home (LA,CA) like we did.

Growing up, I spent at least every other summer criss-crossing that tiny country, sometimes more. Over the last few years, I've begun to miss it in strange ways. I'll encounter some sort of scent and be shocked at the sensation of smelling Israel. My Hebrew is pathetic, but when I hear people speaking it all of a sudden I feel adept.\\n\\nWhen I had my first bite of a falafel pita at Rami's, I could have sworn I was there again. I'd never tasted falafel like this in the States, not even my own mother's homemade. THIS was true Israeli fast food. THIS was falafel. Everywhere else I've tasted it, the balls are dry and crumbly and often overspiced; they try too hard to make it exotic and fancy. Good Israeli falafel doesn't need that. Real Israeli falafel is unpretentious street food, simple, greasy, and delicious.\\n\\nThere are a couple things that throw me off from the authenticity track. They put hummus in the falafel pita, which *is* delicious - but I've never been to a falafel kiosk in Israel where that was the default, and often it's not even offered. (I keep meaning to order one without the hummus...but oh, it's so good!) They also won't put fries in the pita, which *is* default almost everywhere in Israel...though my first visit, the nice bald guy had sympathy for me and threw a handful of fries into my takeout bag. Still, these are minor things, construction-related if you will; the falafel remains utterly delicious and perfectly authentic.\\n\\nOne caveat: always request extra pickles. You think they put a lot on there, but there can never be enough. That combination of pickles, tahina, and freshly fried falafel balls makes me feel like I'm strolling through Rehovot with my cousins again, and it tastes damn fine, too."},{"name":"Foster Burger","address":"5339 Se Foster Rd","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"Decent turkey burger, and the poutine definitely didn't suck (but only get a large size if you are sharing with 4 people.

I've been here twice, once when it first opened, then this week about 3 months later. \\n\\nBoth times I visited the service was some-what subpar. The first time I brushed it off to the restaurant being new, however after coming this week I think thats just how it is. Some of the bus staff didn't seem to speak English as they didn't acknowledge us asking questions or asking for water upon initially being seated. Also, we had made a reservation through OpenTable and I told the receptionist upon entering we had a reservation under my last name and they failed to confirm the reservation which defeats the purpose and is a pet peeve of mine.\\n\\nThe food at Buttermilk & Bourbon, however, is reallyyyyy good. Tapas is sooo trendy right now that its almost cliche, but the soul-food/creole/homecooked tapas served here are unique to the standard fusion/Mediterranean tapas typically seen in Boston. I highly recommend the fried chicken with the white BBQ sauce, something I haven't found outside the south until now! The mac and cheese with flaming hot cheetos is interesting upon first sight, but isn't as heavy or gross as you would expect. \\n\\nOverall this place is a bit pricy for the amount of food you get; but the quality and execution is there, and really as far as tapas go and the area it isn't as over priced as some places that serve way worse food.

As we waited for our table, which was 15 past our pre set reservation, they buzzed us to the front desk (we were comfy at our bar seating) only to leave us standing for 15 minutes. Did they think we were walking from downtown?  When I was cashing out at the bar- they won't move your tab forward, I moved to the end of the bar to pay so the stools would be open. The same rule monster came by me and said I couldn't  be there.  To which I said why can't I sign my check there. He preceded to school me in the invisible end.

However, I can review the restaurant itself and the food I ate :) \\n\\nI enjoyed most of the food, and appreciated getting regular water topups, as the grub was quite spicy & salty. I found this restaurant to be of a decent size, with clean washrooms, etc. The temperature in the restaurant was cozy but not too hot (which I was expecting for a group of 50 people!) The food was actually just what I needed after a LONG day, but to be honest, I would have to say that it was quite salty. Also, I can handle spice very well, but I can see how some folks could find some dishes too hot. There were a few items which tasted just like the others, probably because they use similar spices in most dishes. I would recommend those visiting the restaurant to get a variety of dishes so they can enjoy different flavours. I really liked the green beans and pulled noodle soup as well as the crispy potatoes... MMMmm! I'm giving this restaurant 3 stars because in all honesty, it wasn't anything too special, but it wasn't horrible either. Except for the cold, doughy & kind of slimy bun. That thing was yucky. If you have a craving for oily spicy \\"asian\\"-type food... go for it! :) \\n\\nHere is what I got to try: \\n*Tibetan Crispy potatoes (flour coated potatoes)* - AWESOME! The owner actually cooked up an extra plate for me because I arrived to the Meetup late & that was the first dish they had served. Too cool. \\n\\n*Tsel Then-Thuk (handmade pulled noodle soup)* - AWESOME. I can't believe that as a vegan I was tasting these \\"chicken broth\\" flavours! Really yummy soup! \\n\\n*Tsel-Tofu Momo (steamed Tibetan dumplings)* - Although these were served cold, their flavour was very pronounced and quite good. I enjoyed these a lot, and wish I could have had more! \\n\\n*Tsel-Tofu (mixed vegetables--bok choy, carrot, cauliflower, zucchini, celery, water chestnut, daikon, snow peas, red pepper, green pepper with tofu)* - Was good, but falls under the category of dishes that all taste pretty much the same. I have to say that the combination of these foods was good & nutritious! \\n\\n*Hot and Spicy Eggplant (eggplant, onion, etc.)* - Again, one of the dishes that is like others. Really salty and oily... but I personally don't mind that ;) \\n\\n*Gobi Manchurian (Crispy cauliflower)* - The texture of this dish was interesting because the cauliflower ended up feeling like chicken in my mouth. Weird. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't amazing either. Maybe I was tired of eating brown salty & spicy food by then. \\n\\n*Fried Crispy Green Beans* - I really enjoyed these. \\n\\n*Tingmo (Tibetan steamed buns) served with the dishes.* - I have no idea where they were going with these...

Put a special covering under the pizza so it did not directly touch the pan. Wrote gluten on the piece of paper so it was clear. I was really really impressed with this training and sensitivity to allergies. \\n\\nNow on to the pizza. The gluten free crust was light and tasty but did not crumble like most GF options.

Regina Pizzeria had a line outdoors that made us wonder if they were giving away free iPhones, and the food court at the Galleria Mall was so packed that it appeared that the masses would soon begin to turn on one another for nourishment, so we decided to go back to our hotel for a late afternoon snack. It turned out to be an excellent choice. \\n\\nWe decided to get cocktails and split an ARTbar burger with mixed greens. Mine was called a Boston Tea Party. It was basically iced tea with lemon and vodka. It is definitely not a sweet drink, but I liked it. My friend thought it was a little bitter. He ordered a Bloody Mary. It was very tasty-- definitely a step above the norm, with hints of celery and other vegetables layered in with the tomato. \\n\\nThe burger was, in a word, epic. Thick and juicy, with a delicately toasted bun, crispy bacon, perfectly melty cheese, and a generous helping of fried onion piled on top, it was a masterful achievement. The waiter was kind enough to ensure that it was cut in half and served on separate plates. The salad, a nice assortment of greens with balsamic dressing, and a fresh, crunchy garlic dill pickle were also divided onto our plates. \\n\\nI can't say enough nice things about our experience. The waiter was outstanding, the ambience was peaceful (a welcome change after a very nerve-jangling day), and the food was out of this world.

To seat a table of 2, it was going to take 2 hours, so we ended up eating at the bar. \\n\\nThe waitress first brought out water and a basket of cornbread and biscuits. I was floored by the cornbread, there were kernels inside and the butter complimented the cornbread really well! We shared the fried green tomatoes which was very nicely split to two separate dishes by the waitress. I really liked the tomatoes and the taste of the fried tomatoes, unlike anything I've had before. It was very light and not so bread crumbly. Then our fried chicken with mashed potatoes and collard greens came out and it was so juicy! I loved the flavors from the fried chicken toned down by the mashed potatoes. Lastly, the banana bread pudding creme br√ªl√©e was amazing! We were contemplating whether or not we should get it, but since our favorite dessert is creme br√ªl√©e, we knew we had to try this interesting concoction. The dessert actually had banana bread topped with whipped cream. Below was the creme br√ªl√©e that was so tasty! \\n\\nThe whole experience despite it being completely packed was very enjoyable!

Guy Fieri steered us toward Green Mesquite but some of the locals had told us that Stubbs was, in fact, where it's at as far as Texas barbecue goes. When we found out that a band from Brooklyn that we had been meaning to check out was playing at Stubbs it was a wrap. Killing two birds with one stone as it were.\\n\\nWe started with an order of fried green tomatoes and these things were out in like 3 minutes flat. How is that even possible? These things were everything you would hope and dream for. Not too breaded. Not too greasy. The tomatoes were crisp and full of flavor. I also love the Ranch dipping sauce. I got the Stubb's minor plate which consists of 2 meats with 2 sides. I chose brisket, ribs, mac 'n cheese, and serrano cheese spinach. My girl got the pulled pork sandwich with mashed yams and beer battered onion rings.   \\n\\nThe meats were all stellar. The brisket was smoky and tender, the ribs were fat and juicy, and the pulled pork was to die for. Stubb's barbecue sauce was the perfect compliment to all of these delectable meats. \\n\\nThe mac 'n cheese, while a bit too creamy for my taste, was delicious. The mashed yams were good although they were a bit different than we expected. They were definitely more like candied yams than the mashed sweet potatoes that we were hoping they would be like. They were good, though. Just very very sweet. The onion rings were outstanding. I love it when you can taste the onion and not just the breading and grease. \\n\\nThe only problem I had was with the serrano cheese spinach. They were way too salty. That much salt combined with the heat from the chiles is just too much. These jokers were almost inedible and I really like spicy food. You don't want to feel like you have to chug a bunch of ice water with every bite of your spinach. The banana pudding we got for dessert was also very good.

Not poor in the sense that the staff was rude, more that the staff was inexperienced. Somehow one of them managed to slice a piece of meat into our Sangria. Another dropped the metal plate that holds the meat while it is being cut on the floor. Third, a server holding meat bumped into a bottle of wine at an empty table. Luckily it didn't break.  As far as the selection of meat, it is decent. The taste wasn't there for me. It wasn't seasoned well at all. The Sangria was also very watered down. We paid $30 for a pitcher of Sangria that most definitely had less than 1/4 a bottle of wine in it. It was so bad we left early and went to Fogo de Chao for Sangria and dessert.

There are numerous good establishments in this area, like Trader Joe's, Midtown Art Cinema, The Independent...  I used to regard Apres Diem as highly as I did these other places.\\n\\nNow it's just an absolute shithole.  The prices on every item have gone up over time, while the quality has gone down.  My favorite item was the Salmon Farfalle, which the last few times I've tasted have included disgusting from-the-package salads and over-buttery salmon.  It also costs $14 for a mini-meal, which is pathetic.\\n\\nAnother item I used to enjoy was the Tomato Montrachet.  This is a very simple food: tomato sauce, goat cheese, toasted bread.  It now costs $8, and has lost a lot of flavor.\\n\\nThe service was never that good at this place, but now it is just atrocious.  They rarely check up on you, and are extremely slow even when the restaurant is less than half full.

Then, another waitress came by, apologized for the other one not coming around, and promised to take care of our table.  She smiled, apologized, took our orders, and promptly disappeared.  Someone else delivered our food. We had to track her down to find our check.  Absolutely terrible.\\n\\nWhen I receive my bill at this restaurant/cafe/shithole, I spend a bit of time before writing down my final total.

I had an uncontrollable fit of laughter, and she didn't really appreciate that.

I recommend getting the #1, which comes with tender, incredible pork belly, and adding a spicy bomb. Note: Using half the spicy bomb adds the perfect amount of heat; using all of it takes away from the broth.\\n\\nService: Friendly and efficient. You order at the counter, but servers stop by your table periodically to clear dishes and find out if you need anything. So either bring cash to tip them or tip in advance at the counter when you pay for your meal.\\n\\nAmbience: My constant and eternal dining partner remarked that being in Ramen Tatsu-Ya reminded him of a Tarantino movie.

It came with cream potatoes, carrots, and snow peas. I don't like carrots at all, but I ate the buttery and salty carrots which made it tasty. The peas had a nice crunch. I wish they gave you more veggies, but oh well! For dessert I chose the caramel nut cake with malt ice cream. It was too sweet for my taste. If you like nuts, this is the dessert for you. My friend ordered the chocolate cream pie with chocolate sauce and fresh whip cream. This was def the better one out of the two. The chocolate tasted like a dark chocolate so it was delicious to me!

As a fellow server and bartender the service was very frustrating. The server was very friendly however he was a ghost throughout the whole night. It took the server a LONG TIME to initially come over so we immediately  ordered a bottle of wine. However, after the wine service it took yet again a VERY long time for our server to come back. When we asked a question about the price of the mussels on the restaurant week menu he wasn't sure and said he would be right back. That was not the case, the service was very slow. He was at the table right next to us he looked at our table and said, \\"I will be right with you.\\" He was helping take care of a large birthday party table behind us.  Although the server was friendly he did not ask about the two appetizers we ordered, and another staff member asked how we were enjoying our entrees. We were done with the entrees and wine and kept trying to flag him down, however he seemed busy with other matters. It was a very frustrating feeling that he was not being attentive and did not care at all about our two top party. I understand the tip is bigger with a 20 party birthday however I have not seen my best friend in a long time and was excited for a nice dinner. The service was horrible.. and its the worst feeling when you are out at dinner and you are unable to concentrate on conversation because you are frustrated that you cannot order wine, order appetizers, order dinner, and simply get the check without waiting and waiting and seeing him glance over.

The problem is the lines and the fact that people have no \\"line etiquette\\". Look folks, it should be simple. Once you're in line, you don't get to take extra orders for your lazy friends, co-workers, etc. If they want food, they can come stand in line too, not leach off your waiting and screw up the experience for everyone behind you.\\n\\nThe brisket is really, really good. It is simply put, one of the best meat experiences in my experience period. (And I've eaten a lot of meat). The wide range of sauces they have also add a nice bit of variety and the various cuts of brisket go well with different sauce combinations.\\n\\nThe rest of their meat selection is also fantastic. There's really nothing that you can go wrong picking along with the brisket.\\n\\nThat said, the rest of the experience is kind of mediocre. The line waiting is awful, the sides are worse than mediocre (especially in comparison to competitors) and the seating situation is also pretty bad.\\n\\nI also feel like there's a bit of complacency setting in in terms of flavor. The brisket is fantastic, but it feels the same each time I go there. Now maybe that's a good thing given the huge amounts of people who line up, but I also think at this level you should be expected to innovate and make sure everyone's experience is unique each time you visit. When you get compared in the same breath with Uchi, and yes, Franklin's brisket is up at that level of culinary excellent, I do think there's a responsibility to keep reaching higher."},{"name":"Franklin Barbecue","address":"900 E 11th St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"Came here a few weeks back with a friend since we were visiting Texas. It was a chillier and rainy day, but we still waited for 3h in the morning for the experience of it all. This place has by far the best bbq my tastebuds have tried. Since we made the trip out here, we decided that we must try at least everything on the menu. Fret not, if you order too much food, they have a station off to the side where you can wrap up the food you didn't finish yourself and bring it home.\\n\\nOnto the food:\\n1. The brisket was very simply, yet very well seasoned. The meat was very tender. Unfortunately, my friend and I could not finish this while we were there and brought it back to our hotel to eat. This was still very good the next day, albeit cold.\\n\\n2. The ribs literally fell off the bone as I was eating it, nothing much else to say about that.\\n\\n3. Pulled pork is usually not my favorite thing to eat at BBQ places. But here it was very tender.\\n\\n4. Turkey is something I don't usually see at BBQ places at home. Unlike most turkey breast I have had, this was not dry or tough to eat.\\n\\n5. Sausages can be bought by the pound or by the link. According to the server who took our order, 1 lb of sausage is roughly 5 links, give or take.

After all this has been ranked numero uno for many years.  Is the brisket world class.  Yes.  The ribs were excellent, the link was solid as well.   I waited four years to find a day where there was a minimal line, and after my meal I would wait another four years instead of the 2-3 hour line.   As my son and I kept saying to ourselves could it be that good?  How much better versus La BBQ, Valentinas, or Micklethwait Craft Meats.  Franklin BBQ was not better and in some respects was coming in second.   I did enjoy my time hanging with the LA boys traveling across the country while standing in line.  There is something to be said for the comradery of a long wait.  Austin locals are spoiled by having so many world class choices.  What I do notice is who is trying and who has settled.  I do not believe Mr. Franklin is a regular participant during the cooking process.  His personal spark seems to be missing, or maybe the others have just caught up or surpassed the king of the hill.   I am so happy to have finally tried Franklin BBQ to realize we have so many great purveyors of the art of smoked meat in Austin.  (edit)  I need to add Aaron Franklin has given so much to art of making fine BBQ.  He has never been selfish in his cooking methods, and techniques.

The first time I went was a little over a year ago and the service was really good, but the food was mediocre. Not that I have much experience with jerk or Jamaican food, but it tasted a bit bland and overloaded with spices rather than marinated. \\n\\nMy recent visit was even worse--- the service was terrible! I think there was only one server for a restaurant 80% full. It was Saturday at lunchtime~ they should not have been understaffed. They took much too long to take our order, much too long to bring the food, and much too long to bring the bill. My friend and I ended up just paying at the front because we didn't want to sit in those uncomfortable chairs any longer. \\n\\nThe food was better this time, in quality anyway. I had the December special~ lobster accras paired with their red pepper tomato soup. The soup was delicious. You could really taste the pepper and tomato. The lobster accras was also delicious but there were only 6 pieces (for $10) and very little lobster meat. \\n\\nFor $12, my friend received a much larger meal from their brunch menu. She had the Kitty's Scramble which included scrambled eggs, jerk chicken and potatoes. Except instead of the jerk chicken she ordered, they brought her the veggie sausage. Wherever the server's mind was at that moment, it certainly wasn't on taking orders. The food was piled together with a piece of toast which made the entire dish soggy and oily. \\n\\nI probably won't come back to this restaurant; all the furniture feels sticky, and the decor is not to my taste. The food and service is hit and miss; there's little reason for anyone to return here as the neighborhood offers better restaurants close by."},{"name":"Papa G's Vegan Organics","address":"2314 SE Division St","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"Vegan burger is good.

It's a big thing for me to have an egg in ramen that is cooked, but still a little oozy lol. The broth is good too, and it's pretty rich, but it's not a bad thing.

For several minutes we sat at the bar while 3 employees complained about the low tips they received that day, but none of them paid attention to us (I assume their shift was over, but it's the principal). There was also a manager in the bar area counting the drawer, who let this whole experience happen while he was within 5 ft of us. We got our own menus from further down the bar and finally were greeted by a server who seemed very irritated we were there, and tried to imply we should move to a table. After a bit of attitude while ordering the food (it's the No Mas menu after 11a when ADios stops serving breakfast btw, I hadn't realized that beforehand) the food came out quick, it was fine, nothing special. Another manager filtered through a few times, and we continued to be forced to hear the staff complain about their jobs while we ate. We had to get our own silverware from behind the bar, and my water sat empty for a long time and never got refilled. Again, all while a manager was present. \\nReady to leave my husband had his card out trying to get our servers attention, but she kept walking away to fuss at the other staff for not doing their jobs.

I was starving and couldn't even finish it. my boyfriend got a burger , and he said it was alright , but lacked any real flavor and was rather soggy. the waitress forgot the ranch and ketchup my boyfriend has asked for three times , so that kind of was slightly bothersome.  it wasn't a horrible meal really, everything was just so overpriced that it added to the bad taste in my mouth."},{"name":"No Mas!

Every individual ingredient was good, but together, it was a mess. The pita fell apart (this seems to be par for the course now that Clover started making it in-house), the zucchini wasn't chopped finely enough to fit in the pita, and the basil mayo, while good, was thickly lathered on -- state fair levels of mayo. The result was a soggy, watery mess. The moisture from the zucchini salad mixed with the mayo caused the pita to lose structural integrity.

Perfect chunks of lobster meat on top of a layered parfait of broccoli cream and pureed truffle potatoes in a martini glass. It was heavenly. \\no Lemon Ricotta Ravioli. English peas, asparagus, proscuitto, parmigiano reggiano. Did you know it is the beginning of the English pea season? Neither did I, before my Woodfire experience the previous night. If you're not a lover of peas, you may change your mind after the English pea enters your life. This was a flavorful, light, summery dish. The complimentary foccacia-like bread is perfect for swiping up the sauce. The proscuitto bits add a salty balance as well as color.\\no Crisped Soft Shell Crab. Green apple, walnut, napa salad. Dill shallot vinaigrette. A perfectly fried whole soft shell crab was presented beautifully on the salad. The crab was meaty and balanced well with the acidity of the salad.\\no Seared Hudson Valley Foie Gras. Georgia strawberries, toasted black pepper gastrique, arugula vinaigrette. Another beautifully flavored warm weather dish. The sweet notes of the strawberries was in harmony with the seared foie gras. This also came in two portion sizes and we opted for the smaller. I could've gone for more.\\no Painted Hills Ranch Natural Beef Short Rib. Black truffle polenta. Young collard greens. Pickled red onions, shallots, and ramps. I debated between this dish and the lamb shoulder. I was told this was one of the most popular dishes. So why not? The short rib was tender and cooked to perfection. I didn't even need a knife. And the black truffle polenta was one of the first items to catch my eye. This is a hearty entree for the meatlovers.\\no Pan Roasted Breast of Farm Raised Duck. Salad of fennel, orange, Ligurian olives, and ginger lemongrass jus. About 5 pieces of duck come arranged in a star shape, interconnected by a orange salad. The duck was pretty lean. It was cooked medium, but I think you could go down to medium rare. I didn't think it was outstanding.\\n\\nThe food was well executed. I loved the appetizers more than the main and wouldn't be adverse to only trying appetizers next time. \\n\\n- Service -\\nThe rest of my party had a slight detour. I hung out at the bar for a while. I'm not sure if they seat incomplete parties, but I waited a little bit for my reserved table.

The sheer number of Japanese dishes is astounding. They have a good selection of domburi dishes which are fairly uncommon to see at Japanese restaurants around the boulder area. I menu is exciting with the wide range of plates available. \\n\\nWe ordered the chicken katsu and a around 7 sushi rolls. Now i had pretty high hopes because i saw so many good reviews and i was not let down. \\n\\nI have no idea how there making there Sushi-zu (the sugar / vinegar mixture that goes with the rice to make sushi rice) but its mind boggling. The flavor of the rice alone is fantastic. That combined with the rice being cooked perfectly really sets the stage for an amazing sushi roll. \\n\\nThe fish freshness could easily be compared to the fish I've had at sushi places in coastal cities. Definitely way above par for a land locked state. \\n\\nThe technique in the rolls is also top notch. Often times at many places you'll get one or two peaces of a sushi roll that will fall apart, not here. All of the rolls where assembled evenly and with care. All of the rolls where perfectly shaped. The plating was great as well, all of the rolls where served on a plate atop a palm leaf. \\n\\nOne thing i find about a lot of sushi is that if you take it home, its not all that great. Our leftovers were great too, we ordered way too much and had to take some home. I just got done eating my leftovers and they where way fresher than i expected, roughly 10 hours later! They weren't dry or falling apart, they where surprisingly fresh. Only slightly worse than when we had it fresh at the restaurant.\\n\\nThe prices aren't bad ether, A lot of basic rolls are in the $4-6 range, with a few special rolls that are over $10. I'd say the prices here are on par with if not lower than many of the other Japanese restaurants in terms of sushi in the area. The off menu items are a bit costly however the sizes are large, the chicken katsu was around $14 but the portion was huge. If you wanna keep it affordable stick to the sushi!\\n\\nOur servers where attentive and we never had an empty glass of water or green tea.\\n\\nEating here blew my mind today, Hana totally raises the bar on Japanese restaurants in the boulder area. Not just in quality of food, but also in quality of price.

A green one that was a nice complement to the spicy red one.  The spicy sauce was awesome, tasted like habenero, a lovely burn. \\n\\nSaffron Chicken Lazeez - mince chicken and spinach in a creamy sauce.  This was a very uniquely flavored dish and I really loved the pop of mint that wasn't overpowering. It was kinda like a savory sag paneer with a refreshing element.  Definitely worth getting again!\\n\\nBaigan Bhartha- mashed smoked eggplant, cilantro, onion, chili pepper, mustard oil.

And the waffles? Get outta here!\\n\\nCorned beef hash - now this is what I call hash. Big chunks of corned beef mixed with a small amount of potatoes. Even the wheat toast was amazing.\\n\\nPraline bacon - my first thought was 3 strips of bacon for $4.50? But oh my, were those bacon strips worth every penny.

Mr J writes about our experience at Oyama the past year:\\n\\nSomething has gone wrong at Oyama over the last 5 years. I have been a long-standing regular, including business lunches with some of my most important clients. This restaurant has also doubled as a place to bring my children, and in fact, is the place I met the love of my life. It the literally the most referred restaurant in my entire business career. \\n\\nSlowly and gradually over the last two years, I noticed strange behavior in the servers, and in the way the food was presented that was at odds with the outstanding and predictable quality and politeness I had come to expect.\\n\\nSpecifically...\\n\\n-          When I bring my children, we are often waiting. We sometimes wait, and other families seat before us. Based what I have observed, I can only assume there is ethnic bias being very directly communicated by this business. \\n\\n-          When I bring my Spouse, who happens to be a mix of White and Black, she gets served later... in fact, the last time (the straw that broke the camels back), she was served 10 minutes later than I was. We always order our own dishes from the server, and she does not partake in the items I select (which anyone watching would notice, so clearly the servers aren't paying attention). \\n\\nWhen observing tables with Asian guests, this doesn't happen. Do the staff believe guests so foolish and unobservant that they won't notice this divergent treatment?\\n\\n-          Lately the staff are in a habit of rushing us through dinner, and generally look very annoyed or put-off when additional dishes are ordered. Not everyone wants to finish their food in 5 minutes. \\n\\nThis isn't subtle behavior, its very up front and borderline aggressive. It goes without saying this is not consistent with quality Canadian business culture.\\n\\n-          It occurred to me, that after bringing in dozens of unique visitors and spending thousands of dollars on patronage that perhaps someone might know my name? After all, I've offered it up plenty of times, and engaged in \\"conversation\\", but frankly, the servers and front of house seem irritated by having to communicate in English.\\n\\nSimply put, the Staff at Oyama are behaving in a way which is culturally insensitive to English speaking Canadians, and I believe the behaviour is racist at the core.  \\n\\nWhen confronted about their bigoted and odd behavior, both of the front of house staff members I spoke with made what can only be described as an \\"O\\" face, with mock surprise and sensitivity. One simply walked away from the conversation without even acknowledging I had spoken. \\n\\nNeither staff member had the presence of mind to grab an owner or a manager, and they did not even answer up to their bigoted treatment of non-Asian guests.\\n\\nSteer clear of this Funeral Home. There are other well-run restaurants that won't insult your dignity and treat regulars like a bothersome annoyance. No one should support a restaurant where the servers appear to be irritated by the cultural diversity of their guests. \\n\\nAs I stated when I spoke to the staff member, I'm done with this restaurant, and their bigoted behaviour."},{"name":"Twigs Bistro and Martini Bar","address":"801 Waterfront Way, Ste 103","city":"Vancouver","stars":"3.5","text":"I recently went there for dinner with a friend.

I had the biscuit sliders (chicken and gravy) which were out of this world. The dish was very heavy though so come hungry and don't expect an appetite for a while afterwards. D got the shrimp and grits which were just OK. I thought the grits were a little runny and lacked flavor.

I had recommended it to everyone when I came back to miami. I had come to Orlando to visit universal with my significant other and we stopped by at cowfish. The service was good. My SO's food was good he got a Bento box. I had gotten their \\"the cowfish has left the building\\" which I had last time and I fell in love. And i feel that it wasn't as good as it was before. I think they skimped out on the peanut butter so it didn't taste right to me. I was very disappointed.  But their crab Rangoon dip is out of this world! We ate that very quickly.

Had my second visit to this establishment during a recent visit to Portland (stayed at the nearby Mark Spencer Hotel---see my Yelp of it as well).  \\n\\nWe went for a late dinner here, and so I crossed my fingers and called up to see whether they'd have any tables at 10pm.  Sure enough they had some openings so I made a reservation.  When we arrived the place was still alive and hopping.  They seated us within a few minutes.  There's a nice vibe inside and it's a great place to go with a group.  \\n\\nAs for their menu they have a huge selection.  For a brief second I thought of getting steak, but HEY---this is a seafood restaurant!  So, I narrowed my focus to the seafood variety.  Even with this limitation, it still took a while to choose--there were so many tasty entree's to choose from!  I eventually went for the Pecan-crusted Catfish.  I have to say that it didn't disappoint.  I gulped it all up and it was yummy.  Additionally, my four other dinner-mates also showered the place w/ accolades over their meals.  \\n\\nFor dessert thought of getting a \\"Chocolate Bag\\" (looked yummy), but we went for a dessert that had three different desserts with it.

That was a shock. We told them that we have already pre-ordered a menu of items. The girl was confused and went to speak to her manager. The manager came and asked us which menu we have pre-ordered, so we told them. A while later, the manager came back and told us that they couldn't find our order, but they will now start preparing the food. What the ****? We already told them which items we ordered, so even if they couldn't find our pre-order, why didn't they just start on preparing the food instead of wasting time trying to find our pre-order?\\n\\nAfter waiting a really long time since we were seated, our food finally came. The service was awkward throughout the whole meal. For example... When one of our dishes came, the server came to our table, holding the dish, and told us that the dish was ready, and then walked away with that dish. She came back and took away plates from some of us (for some reason, she didn't take away my dad's plate) and returned with the dish again.\\n\\nAlso, they do not pay attention to the needs of their customers. The server was cleaning away some of the plates from our table and I was wondering out loud if the glass of water in front of me was mine. My dad said \\"no, the empty glass is yours\\". After hearing that, I assumed the server would go refill my water, but she just walked away.\\n\\nOur bill came up to be around $70. When we were waiting for some change back, the server gave us a $20 bill back and only $3 in change available for tipping... We ended up having to dig in our wallets to make up the rest of the tips.\\n\\nThe whole restaurant was not very busy at all. There were 3 other tables in the restaurant aside from us. The empty tables had dirty plates and used tableware not cleaned up the whole time we were there. I was surprised at how slow and awkward their service was.\\n\\nOh, and the food?\\nIt was below average... The soup was alright, but everything else was below average.

Our server asked us if we were interested in trying the watermelon soju, and when we asked what it was she pointed to the table next to us and explained it. It comes with cotton candy so we were sold! She also talked us into a beer soju tower which was enjoyable. We did family style and got the boondae jiggae, a stone bowl beef bimbimbap, Korean bbq ribs and lastly, spicy snails. All were very delicious! The portions were a great size, and we all felt full but not too stuffed. All in all, everything was great from start to finish. My only recommendation is get extra stuff for the boondae jiggae.

The overall flavor seemed to be a bit lost in the over saturation of vinegar.\\n\\nThe first of our two entrees was  the Torta Ahogada - touted as a sandwich, this roll is stuffed with pork carnitas.  It is definitely a fork and knife sandwich because it is soaked in their arbol red salsa.  Has a wonderfully light spiciness to it.  \\n\\nThe second was the Crepas de Pollo - nice twist instead of  the use of a traditional tortilla.  Here the chicken is dressed in a crepe and smothered in cheese and verde salsa.  Exceptionally fine flavor.\\n\\nFor dessert we had Empanada de Arroz con Leche - which is an empanada pastry filled with Mexican rice pudding topped with cinnamon sugar with a nice scoop of coconut gellato on the side.   Simply outstanding!  \\n\\nFor our liquid refreshments we started off with a couple of cervezas.  A DOS XX and a Negra Modelo and moved into the Mezcal department.  A Mezcal Tropical and a Mezcal Buck were very good agave cocktails.

Since we had a group of 8, we called and made a reservation the day before (they require at least half of the group in order to be seated).  \\n\\nThe decor is amazing, really enjoyed the atmosphere!! \\n\\nOkay the food - keep in mind that they have a separate weekend brunch menu.  My friends and I ended up ordering quite a few different things: Asada y Huevos, Omelette Florentina, The ADios, Southwest Omelette, Chilaquiles, Bloody Mary, Bloody Maria, and Mango Mimosas. I will note that I originally wanted to order the Asada y Huevos but they serve the Asada (marinated skirt steak) well done as the only option.  So I opted for the ADios with eggs over easy.  I will say that the sauce that they used was really runny in that my has browns went from crunch to really soggy.  It lacked flavor, could use a little salt/heat or just a little something extra.  The difference between Bloody Mary and Bloody Maria is the type of liquor used (Bloody Maria uses tequila - beware!) and the Bloody Maria is supposed to come with celery and olives.  The worst part is we had to ask our server for the celery and olives.  At least they offer free chips and salsa!  \\n\\nOur server did let us know almost half-way through the meal that it was her 2nd brunch service, so we definitely tried to cut her some slack.  She told us that we were unable to order drinks until 12:00 and if we ordered drinks it would arrive at our table around 12:30 due to laws/regulations on Sunday.  The food took almost 30-40 minutes to arrive at our table.  At one point, our server told us \\"her world [aka the kitchen] was crashing down,\\" which made sense.  Once it was time for the bill (they do split), she got almost everyone's bill (6 out of 8 bills) incorrect twice.  \\n\\nNot a great experience here, very lackluster."},{"name":"Sonsie","address":"327 Newbury St","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"So your bartender, Jennifer?, was amazingly kind to me today.

Hei La Moon has pretty decent quality food IMO... I found their pork buns and hargau to be particularly good (better than most I've had, actually), but pretty much everything I ate was decently tasty with the exception of the sesame ball which was on the cold side and a major bummer (everything else seemed fresh and hot though). For 3 of us to be completely stuffed, we each paid $12 (which included tip). Insanely cheap for a filling, tasty meal. \\n\\nAs with any traditional dim sum experience, you pretty much need to know what you're doing... if you don't know Cantonese and are picky/have lots of food aversions, or are operating on a budget, or want a balanced meal, or want your entire meal to arrive at once, or want a non-chaotic eating experience, you're out of luck. Fortunately the friend I was with was able to identify from experience most of the fillings of the various dumplings and buns and balls, which was helpful because the cart ladies can basically only tell you the main type of meat or filling that's involved and nothing else (major language barrier here, plus they're not really known for their service).\\n\\nI think personally, as a bit of a control freak I prefer the Windsor-type of experience, where you get a menu with descriptions, prices, and pictures of each of their offerings, and use a checklist for ordering... I like having control over my meal (making it balanced with different types of eats, rather than a million of the same), being able to price things out beforehand,  knowing exactly what's in each item, and not having to worry about timing or language barriers.

It does get quite crowded because it's not very big.  The food is good and there are a lot of cool combinations to choose from on their menu.  An average sized meal would be 2-3 dogs and an appetizer of some kind, which is fine because the prices are really reasonable.  They always have a fairly decent draft list and do their own infused liquors as well.\\nIt's a cool concept, but something does get lost in the execution at times and it can be very crowded.  It's a really popular spot with hipsters, which is a good thing or a bad thing depending on your disposition to hipsters.

Yes'm. \\nEaten lots of BBQ: Indeed.\\nHad what people in Texas call the best of the best? I have made the trips, I have tasted the meats. (hehehe, shut up this is serious).\\n\\nAfter many reviews and many accolades, my husband and I decided that when we took our next mini-vacation to Austin we would get up early one day and get in line for Franklin BBQ. \\nWas the line long? After us, yes. Before us, no. We arrived at 730 am. We brought a blanket, cooler with beer, book to read and internet to use.\\nWas the staff nice? They walked down the line and talked with the guests. They offered cheap beers, chips, information on what was cooking and how much, and that if we wanted coffee or breakfast tacos a store right around the corner sold them.\\nThey let us use their bathroom and have sneak peaks at what lay ahead. So yeah, they were pretty f'ing fantastic.\\nWhen the line moved - it moved!\\nWe were excited and ordered waaaaaaay too much food: Tipsy Texan, brisket, beef rib (on special), pork ribs, and beans. \\nDid we spend more than we expected? Yup. \\nDid we get more food than we could possibly eat? Yup. My bad, beef ribs aint cheap.\\nBest. Leftovers. Ever.\\nTipsy Texan: juicy, sloppy, meaty. It was everything I wanted and then some.\\nBeans: salty and sweet, perfect texture and plenty for the party.\\nBrisket: closest thing to a religious experience that either myself or my husband have ever had. Buttery, melt in your mouth meat. Almost no need to chew, just put it in your mouth and let the meat orgasm commence and envelope your body. Beautiful to look upon. Monet should have painted brisket and not bridges. Crusty yet moist, burnt ends, red lines, like opening a meat present wrapped in tissue paper. \\nBeef rib: I did not expect them to be that expensive. I also did not expect them to be that good. No regrets. I felt like Fred Flintstone at the size but Rockefeller at the quality. I wanted to cuddle this rib and tell it I would always be true to it.\\nPork rib: Still had some pull to it, weren't limp and texture-less. Simple taste done more than well. The flavor was excellent but the true skill was the time and effort in the cooking. This was a work of love and skill, not over-manipulation of spices.\\nHigh lights: Aaron was working the line and I even bumped into him walking back inside. He was so nice and asked me (not me asking him) if everything was good and to my liking. He even came around again later to make sure we were good, had beer and were happy. This guy is what makes the restaurant a success. Someone that takes the time and energy and pride in not only what he does, but how his guests are. He was so great. I only wish I had asked him to take a photo with me, as I'm such a big fan of his youtube videos. I also have a crush on him. Don't judge. I crush on his wife too.\\nI know there are a lot of people that love food or BBQ or whatnot.. But I went to Franklins with my husband and had one of he best days I've ever had. Truly.

I love German food, but it's hard to find a restaurant that serves German food in Portland that isn't really expensive or served from a cart. (NOT THAT THERE IS ANYTHING WRONG WITH CARTS!) But it's December... Anyway, my coworker recommended this place so we decided to give it a try. \\n\\nRight away I loved the atmosphere. The restaurant is small, but deep, kind of like a wide hallway. Mood lighting throughout and patio furniture tables and chairs. Clientele consisted mainly of a college student crowd.\\n\\nOur server Boss, who I assume is also the owner/cook, had a great \\"Soup Nazi\\" way about him. Loud, opinionated, knows what's up. Example, when I ordered the schnitzel he replied, \\"You sure you don't want doner kebab? Have you ever tried doner kebab?...\\" It is clearly their specialty. When no one at the table ordered the doner kebab, Boss brought over samples for all of us to try, insisting that we order it next time. He also wanted us to know he was, \\"from Germany\\" and \\"brought these recipes with me from home.\\" He is quite the character, and very nice, and obviously very passionate about his food and restaurant. \\n\\nOk the food was amazing. We all got some form of schnitzel and all died over how great it was. The meat was perfectly cooked and seasoned. The sides were potatoes, red cabbage, and spaetzle which were all the best I've had. The only reason this place gets a 4 instead of 5 is the price was a little high for a cafe. None of us were full exactly, and each paid around $15.00 plus tip. But I'm sure it's because of the quality of the ingredients. Also, because we ordered schnitzel which is apparently made-to-order, it took a significant amount of time to get the food. If you order the doner kebab, it comes out almost immediately.\\n\\nAll in all, I will be visiting Doner Kebab again, especially after Boss informed us they stay open til like 4am Fridays and Saturdays.

Round 2 of drinks was behind.\\n\\nThe service was kind and friendly but dang that food took forever. We finally got our food at 2:00pm which was MUCH later than expected. Meanwhile, the table next to us got their food and free french toast because someone accidentally put them into the system. When our food finally arrived it was...small. Not even a side of toast or a garnish came with the omelette. It was just a tiny omelette. The little fella was over $10 and a SLIVER of salmon was found within despite boasting having smoked salmon.\\n\\nFor me, the total experience matters.

I've been there twice, and each time within 20 minutes of opening time.  The first time we waited about 30 minutes and they were out of pretty much everything but brisket.  This past time, we waited about an hour and luckily they weren't out of anything.  They were sold out of everything by the time we were done eating.  It's a testament to their barbeque when people will stand in the hot sun for seemingly endless amounts of time for a mere chance of smoked meats.  \\n\\nUnfortunately, I was not as thrilled with the ribs as everyone else.  They were good, yes.  But I didn't get the wow factor.  For me, the wow is all about the brisket.  Melt in your mouth yum.  Most recently, I got the Tipsy Texan, which is a chopped beef and sausage sandwich, topped with coleslaw, pickles, and onions.  We also split some ribs, and after all that eating I think I may have split my rib, or maybe just my pants.  I was THAT full. So much of the good stuff falls out of the sandwiches that you can easily make another sandwich out of it.  I don't see myself coming here regularly- I don't have that much dedication to barbeque.  But if I wake up with a hankering, in a good humor that won't be marred if they are sold out, and have a few hours to spare, you just might find me in line at Franklin's."},{"name":"The Cowfish Sushi Burger Bar","address":"Universal Citywalk - Orlando, 6000 Universal Blvd","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"First time at cowfish always wanted to try it since it opened..

Much cheaper than anything you'll get from the Caribou Coffee 50 feet away. \\n\\nThe workers aren't especially happy, peppy, or friendly, but hey they are dealing with a case of the Mondays too- so I cut them a break.

Do you enjoy absurdly delicious brunch fare? If so, Screen Door is for you!\\n\\nIt's all about expecting and managing the wait. About two months ago, my boyfriend and I planned a visit to Screen Door for Sunday brunch -- the nicest Sunday of the year thus far, of course. Being lazy people who woke up late and were forced to go during peak hours, we planned ahead in full -- with our phones and Kindles fully charged, we headed over to get our name on the list. We arrived shortly before 11:30, and we were told it'd be a 75 minute wait. Knowing this, we walked over to Heart, ordered coffee, and read for 45 minutes before walking back and people watching until our names were called at 12:45. (Also, kudos for the accurate time estimates!)\\n\\nWhen we did get our table, the service was wonderfully prompt -- presumably, a reward for holding out for our seats. For what appears to be a fairly small restaurant on the exterior, I enjoyed the interior -- it wasn't too loud or cramped, at least compared to similar restaurants. I ordered the biscuits and gravy (with fried chicken strips on the side, of course), and the boyfriend ordered -- what else? -- the famed chicken and waffles and a breakfast corndog (a new and delicious experience, I might add!).\\n\\nThe biscuits were fluffy and delightful, the gravy borderline heavenly, and the chicken just as advertised -- amazing. Being southern fare, the portions were also massive -- I was barely able to finish my biscuits and gravy, and I had to take a few chicken strips to go; my boyfriend was overwhelmed by the amount of chicken and waffles, and took most of his chicken home. This is by no means a complaint -- it only meant we were able to enjoy our meals through the rest of the day.\\n\\nIt seems absurd to wait so long for food, but in the case of Screen Door, it's worth it. For the sake of your lifespan -- both in terms of the time spent waiting and calories consumed after waiting -- I wouldn't recommend making it a daily stop, though."},{"name":"Mi Pizza","address":"6001 W Parmer Ln, Ste 440","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"Used the online ordering to get a mushroom and meatball calzone.

I had the catfish tacos with jambalaya. and the rice was too salty.  But the catfish was yummy, the strange delicious orange sauce was yummy, and the water glasses are huge!

I ordered a pupu platter for one, egg drop soup and a plate with Imperial ribs and rice. The imperial ribs were not what I expected, but that was okay since you cannot fault them for me thinking it would be something else. I do fault them for giving me boneless spareribs that were clearly old and stale. I couldn't even eat all of them because they were burned, tough and clearly old (the meat has turned a bit dark...telltale sign). I had three chicken fingers, two were very doughy, but clearly fresh and the other was old and stale and was cooked sometime in the past few days, but definitely not today. The chicken wings they gave me were both clearly bruised with broken bones....omg. After adding soy sauce and Sriracha, I saved the bland egg drop soup.

This year we decided to branch out and give another 'tea house' a try.  We were terribly disappointed with our experience (although we thoroughly enjoyed each other's company!).  I recommend that the manager(s) research what an afternoon tea experience should be like so that they can improve their service. \\n\\nThere are several reasons why I am rating TeaFuse poorly.  Although each of us paid the same price for our tea party, for two of the courses the treats were not divided by the number of guests.  There were three of us and for two courses, one person had to have less than the others.  Service was not up to par either.  It took some time for the server to come back and check if we needed/wanted more tea once we finished our first pot.  In addition, we received a rudely-delivered '30 min warning' informing us that there is a cap to the amount of time we could enjoy our tea party and that a surcharge would be added to our bill if we stayed after that point.\\n\\nNeedless to say for the same cost we could have enjoyed better service and better food with unlimited girlfriend time at the Four Seasons.

We were told to be there at 10am to wait in line until they open at 11am because they sell out by 11:30 or 12.  (Even the sign on the door says open 11am to Sold Out.  Yelp has their hours listed as 11am-1pm.  They are open Tuesday to Sunday only for lunch.)  \\n\\nWe couldn't imagine that it would really be necessary to stand in line that early, but since it is our next to last day in Austin and we really wanted to get there, we left at 9:45 to be in line by 10am.  \\n\\nWhen we got there, there were probably 50 other people already in line.  The smart ones who have done this before had folding chairs.  It is important to point out that this is a Wednesday in January and it is pretty cold (low 40s) standing in line in shadows at 10am even if it does warm up into the 60s by mid day.  Some people would leave their partners in line and go over and stand in the sun across the street to warm up. \\n \\nWe've got to admit that they have this down to a science.  A woman came along the line asking everybody what they planned to order so she could estimate when they would sell out, so people would know there was no sense standing in line because they would sell out before these people could get to order.  The owner even came out and talked to people in line and later when we were eating, walked around the dining area and made sure everybody was enjoying their lunch.  \\n\\nTalk about a business model.  This is amazing customer service and classic supply and demand theory.  Someone on this team must be an economics wiz.\\n\\nAnyway, the doors opened at 11am on the nose.  Once the line makes its way inside, there are articles on the walls that you can read while you wait until it is your turn.  One article described that it takes 20 hours to prepare the barbecue that sells out in two hours.  Starting out as a food truck, another article noted that it was voted the most successful transition from a food truck to a brick and mortar location.  \\"In the summer of 2010, Bon Appetit hailed Franklin BBQ as the best in America.\\"  Another article said it was #1 on the list of best barbecue in the world.  \\"The restaurant has sold out of brisket every day of its existence.\\"\\n\\nIt was 11:50 before it was our turn to order.  The staff at the counter were amazing.  All of them asked us where we were from and chatted us up while they took and plated our order.  We each had a two meat plate...brisket and turkey, and ribs and sausage, plus a 1/4 lb of pulled pork.  Sides were potato salad, coleslaw and beans and each of us could pick two.\\n\\nWhile they were plating our food, they offered a sample right there at the counter.

Came across Cypress.  The reviews/photos of the Sublime Burger was intriguing, so I gave it a go.  I sat at the bar and was warmly greeted by Tommy.  I just came off a long flight from LA.  It was a hot and humid evening, so a cold beer was needed!\\n\\nI ordered the Sweetwater Fried Mushrooms to start off.  I love mushrooms, so to fry it made it even better.  It came with two types of mayo:  creole mustard mayo and a spicy mayo.  Both were great complements to the huge, fried mushrooms.  The mushrooms were awesome!  A great crispy outer texture and you were greeted with a sweet, juicy mushroom upon the bite.  It was a huge appetizer serving that can easily shared by 2 or more people.  I couldn't stop, but I finished a little more than half the serving.  I had to keep reminding myself that I had a burger coming!\\n\\nThe Sublime Burger was served along with a huge side order of fries.  Plain and simple, this is a gluttonous burger - but man, it was good!  It's an incredibly messy one too.  While it was a fun adventure eating a hamburger with doughnuts as buns, I probably wouldn't order it again.  The doughnut fell apart very quickly (ergo messy comment) as it absorbed the juices from the burger.  I cut mine in half as the burger is pretty substantial to hold at once, but after finishing the 1st half and moving to the 2nd, the bottom doughnut \\"bun\\" was obliterated.  So my advice is to scarf it down quickly.  Again, it was a very good burger.  I was pleasantly surprised to find the burger was not overly sweet.\\n\\nBecause I already finished a good chunk of the fried mushrooms and nearly finished the burger, I didn't even touch the fries.

If you are not interested, skip it - but it's kind of neat! Please up-vote :)\\n\\n---\\n\\nOne or two years ago, I noticed 2 things about Clover's \\"compost\\" bins: (1) they didn't use compostable trash bags, and (2) most of their waste stream was low-quality \\"compostable\\" plastics. I was therefore very skeptical that they actually composted any of their waste - it seemed much more likely that it was being sent straight to landfill. I messaged Ayr (the head of Clover) about this and he replied: \\"all the restaurant bins go straight to compost.\\" However, in a later blog post titled \\"Death of composting,\\" he later admitted that Clover's waste was NOT being composted, and instead was being sent to a landfill in upstate NY. This was not 100% Clover's fault (supposedly, their composting company deceived them), but it doesn't take a genius to figure it out.\\n\\nSoon after, all of the composting companies in Cambridge stopped accepting compostable plastics. This left Clover with no composting options in Cambridge. As a result, Ayr said: \\"I expect we'll move away from compostable packaging and instead move to post-consumer recyclable.\\"\\n\\nFast forward one year. Despite the fact that Clover has probably never composted, they still *pretend* to compost. At their restaurants, they don't have trash bins - only compost bins, which claim that \\"everything we give you\\" is compostable. This is simply not true! Why do they insist on this lie? Because I have way too much time on my hands, I tried contacting Clover about this. I wrote to Ayr, contacted them through their website, and contacted people in-store. Nobody could respond and I was largely ignored. So that's why I'm writing this review! Maybe they have a perfectly good answer and they haven't had time to write.\\n\\nSo Clover, I'm just curious: do you compost your waste? If so, what happens to your compostable plastics? What company do you use? I look forward to your answer!\\n\\n---\\n\\nP.S. Clover now uses compostable trash bags.

If you're a fan of sweet drinks, I actually really recommend this flavor mix!\\n\\nI look forward to trying other items here, especially the brick toasts.  They always look intriguing and a little scary/overwhelming, but CHALLENGE ACCEPTED!"},{"name":"Dang's Thai Kitchen","address":"670 N State St","city":"Lake Oswego","stars":"4","text":"I consider myself a pretty good judge of Asian food and this may be the best Thai food in the metro area I've tasted. The chicken cashew, golden calamari appetizer and drunken noodles are must-haves. If you're only gonna have 1, definitely go with the chicken cashew. It's amazing. The service is always good and the prices are very reasonable. \\nGreat for takeout too."},{"name":"Sforno Trattoria Romana","address":"1308 Pearl St","city":"Boulder","stars":"4","text":"Yum yum yum! We stopped in after a day of browsing the mall for a small bite and were oh so pleasantly surprised! 5 tapas to share and a glass of wine for about $30, what a steal of a deal! The food was fresh, authentic, and an amazing daily happy hour price! Ambience was true to Italian dining as well so we expected the wobbly tables on brick floors, a fountain in the dining room, and small quarters but that's part of the feel! \\nEAT HERE!"},{"name":"Hey Cupcake!","address":"5530 Burnet Rd","city":"Austin","stars":"3","text":"Let me preface this by saying two things: 1. I LOVE cupcakes and sweets and 2. my review is for a new trailer location on Research Blvd between Great Hills Trail and Braker Lane. \\n\\nI have heard so many good things about Hey Cupcake and I just never took the time to drive out of my northern neighborhood to try one. I was thrilled to discover the new trailer location on Research which has been there since Valentine's Day weekend. \\n\\nThe trailer did not have very many options for cupcake flavors and icings. So I chose a vanilla cake with chocolate icing and a chocolate on chocolate. I expected great things but to me these are just like any other cupcake. The cake and icing flavors are not fancy are different from something I can do myself. Luckily I had a buy one get one free coupon so I wasn't out too much money. \\nUnless there is a better variety and creative cupcakes I do not plan to go out and purchase my own. However, if some just so happen to land in front of me I will not refuse it seeing as how I love cupcakes. \\n\\nI will say the lady working the trailer was very friendly and patient as I checked out the menu and explained that I had never tried Hey Cupcakes before."},{"name":"Punjab Cafe","address":"653 Southern Artery","city":"Quincy","stars":"4.5","text":"I'm so happy I found this place. They have a great vegetarian section which is awesome. My favorite is the \\"Punjab Platter.\\" They also have a huge bread section, filled with a wide variety of naan and others.\\n\\nI have yet to have a bad meal here. I've had both take-out and dine in food here and both times were exceptional. The service is polite too."},{"name":"Fat Matt's Rib Shack","address":"1811 Piedmont Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Possibly the best ribs I've ever had. Really tender, moist, right amount of charring and fat content. Today I got the 1/4 slab & 1/4 bird. Both were excellently cooked. Also had the Brunswick stew and the beans...both were on point.\\n\\nAlthough I came on a Sunday afternoon, I can totally see what I cool place this is on a cool night with the live band playing. Even thought this place is a little out of the way for me, I will definitely come back to satisfy my bbq itch."},{"name":"Screen Door","address":"2337 E Burnside St","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"I'm not even a huge fan of fried chicken but screen door definitely lived up to the hype! despite getting there 5 minutes after they opened we still had to wait 1.5hrs :( but thank goodness it was worth the wait or I wouldn't have been a happy camper! the chicken was white meat but was incredibly moist while the outside was perfectly crispy without being greasy. the sweet potato waffle was a really good complement to the chicken & made it more unique. I love biscuits & their buttermilk ones are delicious."},{"name":"Alden & Harlow","address":"40 Brattle St","city":"Cambridge","stars":"4","text":"3.7. Hip place. Pretty good burger.

Full of Harvard babies."},{"name":"Screen Door","address":"2337 E Burnside St","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"Food was fine but only 2 stars because NOTHING ON THE \\"VEGAN\\" MENU IS VEGAN. Servers/kitchen were great to work with and I got great food, but I don't appreciate the deception. A friend picked this place thinking that there would be lots of options because a vegan menu is advertised online. However, everything on that \\"vegan\\" menu actually has dairy or eggs. Not ok, especially in Portland."},{"name":"Outback Saloon","address":"3141 28th St","city":"Boulder","stars":"3.5","text":"We came here to watch USA lose to Canada in the hockey finals. Had they won, it wouldve been 5 stars.\\n\\nThe bar tender knew everyones name, he was walking around the TV area asking people if they were good, \\"Hey Mike, need another one?\\" I respect that. He came up to me, asked me by name how I was doing (he had my credit card so its not thhhhat impressive but still) and was very friendly.\\n\\nSierra Nevada on tap. Hell yea. \\n\\nThe only drawback is also part of its charm. Its not quite a dive bar because its so huge, but it certainly doesnt cater to the downtown or student crowds. As such, it attracts an older crowd of daytime drinking regulars. The vibe can be a little off-putting at first but lends itself to the authentic nature of the place."},{"name":"Franklin Barbecue","address":"900 E 11th St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"I can't believed I've never written a review for Franklin's BBQ. OMG!!! Yes, it's everything you expect and then some. It's mouth watering goodness. It made me go out and buy his book so I can learn how to cook like him. It's all so good and worth the wait.
