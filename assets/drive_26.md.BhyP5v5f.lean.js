My husband, who hadn't had his dose of Indian in several months, ate his chicken tikka with relish! I think my chicken korma was the best I've ever had, beyond what I ate in the UK and what we eat regularly in the DC/Northern Virginia area. \\n\\nThe only area The Clay Pit was not perfect (hence the missing star) was the service.

The logistics of feeding 20 people at the same time is a exercise in futility. Just don't try it. But you did, Big City; you tried it. Everything was served cold, a sin may have been forgivable had any of our orders been correct when they arrived.\\n\\nAt this point, the manager arrived to quell our parched, hungry lamentations. It was gracious of him to give us free ice cream cake in recompense for a missing meal, but it was delivered to the wrong person. Also, it would have been far better if the manager had simply assisted our large party from the get-go rather than running damage control after the fact. He also seemed annoyed by the whole process.\\n\\nAnd then we had them divide up the bill... _\\n\\nAnywho - Big City. I love you; I really do. But last night, you were not Allston's finest. I still had a good time.

I ordered the Lamb La Zeez and I was very excited because I've had very good, tender lamb Mediterranean style before. Again, it the flavor was there, but it was chewy and over-priced. $17 for a plate of a small portion of chewy, over cooked cubes of meat, white rice, and grilled veggies .\\n\\nI was looking for a justification for the prices and I couldn't find one. The building and location are mediocre at best, the atmosphere is also mediocre at best, at least at 7 on a rainy Friday.

Yes, I know, most people come for the macarons, but I found it's harder to find madeleines than it is to find macarons. The madeleine was really good, you could get that orangey taste and it's really wonderful when dipped in the liquid chocolate. It's soft, but not soft enough that it easily crumbles when dipped in the chocolate.\\n\\nThe price: This is where the star is docked off. Altogether, I paid roughly $11.50 which is really expensive, especially since I paid less than that for a full lunch. The chocolate and the madeleine are really good, but the madeleine at $1.25 is pretty pricey since it's pretty small. I'm letting the price of the liquid chocolate slide because of the amount of chocolate that is used to make it and the fact that the quality is worth the price.\\n\\nI would recommend going here for a special occasion or you're having a really bad day and in desperate need of cheering up. Overall, it is very good, and a nice place to hang out with friends, or if you're by yourself, a good place to get some nice chocolate while using their wifi!"},{"name":"Medina Cafe","address":"780 Richards Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4","text":"O-M-G, let me just say this place totally lived up to the hype. Everything was delicious. I think I cried tears of joy throughout the meal. \\n\\nThe BF ordered a waffle with fig orange marmalade and I ordered a waffle with milk chocolate lavender sauce. The waffles were buttery, crispy on the edges and chewy, kind of like a King's Hawaiian roll. If you've ever been to Northstar in Lake Tahoe, the waffle is very similar to the one served at Euro Snack. The sauces were decadent. I wanted to lick the bowls!\\n\\nWhile waiting for our main course, I indulged in a Lavender Latte. It was creamy and light but still had that caffeine kick I was craving. I need to find a cafe in SoCal that can make this. Love.\\n\\nWe also shared the Fricass√© - 2 fried eggs, braised short ribs, roasted potatoes, caramelized onions, arugula and applewood cheddar served in a cast iron skillet with grilled foccacia on the side. AMAZING! The eggs were perfectly fried...the short ribs SO tender...every bite was seriously bliss. If you ever find yourself in Vancouver, PLEASE stop by for a bite.

We checked out the yelp & urban spoon reviews, but decided to judge for ourselves.\\n\\nOk, meh. The four of us unanimously decided it was just meh! Food was good- not great. Would  eat there again if the gang  wanted to go, but wouldn't suggest it otherwise. Rather disappointing considering how good 4Rivers is!!\\n\\nHere's my take on things. The wait is crazy long! We happened to hit it just right at 1:00 & only waited about 20 mins, but the folks behind us waited for at least an hour- so not worth it! The restaurant hosts a Farmhouse Feel, so if you have a big party, great. Only saw a few tables that would seat couples, otherwise you needed 4-8 people to fill a table. It's loud! Loud! What? I said loud! But this is expected of a open room restaurant. What I didn't like about the setup (just like 4R) is that she took my order at the counter, plopped the main course on the plate,& scooted my tray down for the next gal to add the sides. In theory this works, however I had a bazillion people in front of me & my food just sat getting colder & colder (like when you go to the dr & they call you back only to make you wait another 45 mins! Come on! Leave me in the waiting room where there's people & magazines so I can stew about the wait with others!!!) I digress.....\\n\\nSo onto the food. This is the kinda place you wanna fast all day before going because you are gonna feel so guilty when you leave! Now I like good ole' fashioned fried food with all the fat n' trimmings, but this place takes that greasy meal & dips it in some gravy before serving it to you! Oh yah! That's some serious gluttony baby!!!\\nI had the chicken in dumplings & the rest of my group had fried chicken. Here's the low down: chick-n-dump was pretty darn good. Rotisserie chicken w/ a few biscuit plops on top. No dumplings really, but rather a shredded chicken casserole. I liked it. Fried chicken was really oven fried chicken. Minimal breading & very peppery. They all liked it. Would suggest a bucket next time. Sides- oh my the sides. Fattening to say the least!!! Creamed corn....corn with cream cheese, butter,& sugar. Good but oh so bad at the same time! I liked it, the others didn't. Whatever. Pimiento cheese with toast was great. Mac n cheese was pretty darn good. Gravy on mashed taters was DISGUSTING! Collard greens were tasty. Fried Okra was fantastic! Bread Pudding was basically a cinnamon roll in a cup- would skip it next trip.\\nSo basically our review totally backs up the Yelp reviews we read before going- like SPOT ON!! The staff was very nice & knowledgeable...& were super efficient at clearing tables & taking care of you. \\nI would go back again, but I can't imagine more than a few times a year. It was good but meh all at the same time. Btw my lunch was $13.... It's a little steep for lunch but within range at dinner. Liked that they had pellet ice in their coke machines & they had a perfect set up for to go boxes, bags,& cups. Someone knew what they were doing here! I think this place will do well overall. I hope they do! Parking sucks. Food is a little overpriced & lacking a little something special, but overall I hope they stick around."},{"name":"Cain and Abel's","address":"2313 Rio Grande St","city":"Austin","stars":"3","text":"Whew, this place was empty last night!

Two fish \\"sticks\\" but tasted like real fish -- saltier than I like it, and no side of sauce was brought out like the menu said, and our waitress went by too infrequently for me to ask -- but I still enjoyed it.  For sure I'm a fried fish taco girl, now I know.  The side of rice had maybe just as much corn in it, it was kinda weird, but I really liked the taste :D And the beans were waaay tastier than i expected.  Hubby's gigantic chicken burrito didn't taste like anything special, though he appreciated the liberal dose of queso on top; the side of tortilla chips tasted homemade (I could be wrong), and the guac was brown but I didn't care + still thought it tasted good :D  I'm way too easy.\\n\\nBut I like the chillness of it.

Unless you make a reservation or get there super early, then you're probably going to be waiting awhile. Fortunately they offer a text-based notification system that allows you to wander over to the nearby Horseshoe Lounge for super cheap beers and some shuffleboard. Parking can also be a bit tight, so be ready to squeeze between other patrons at the neighboring restaurants. \\n\\nWhile each person will be paying $50 apiece, the courses are still served as singular plates, which begs the question if the portions are actually scaled accordingly. As a group of three sitting next to a group of two, I can confirm that the servings were indeed larger in size and sometimes even considerably larger. Talking to the staff, it sounds like the menu will be (drastically) rotated on a 2-3 month basis, so plan your food budgets accordingly.\\n\\nEvery single dish I had was incredible and presented immaculately. Even the least impressive dish was better than the best many other restaurants have to offer. Make sure to request a spatula so you can scrape up every single drop of scrumptious sauce without having to resort to licking the bowls. The waiters really appreciate it when you return the dishes spotless and ready for immediate re-use. \\n\\nWhile Barley Swine offers arguably the best dinner in Austin, it certainly does not come cheap. If you're looking for a hearty meal rather than an assortment of small dishes, then this is definitely not the place to come.

This time the standout was the duck with berry sauce but we also enjoyed the trout in walnut sauce, garlic scapes, and salad with peaches, mint and cucumber.  We also tried the basque cake which was nice but a tad too sweet for my taste.  We usually get the bitter chocolate mouse, which is divine.  Wine is always great and I love how you can order by the glass, half or 2/3 bottle.  We went on an evening during a heat wave so it was a bit warm inside but that did not detract from a delicious dinner.  Dishes can be ordered as small or large and are meant for sharing.

Service was pretty ridiculous. The host was nice however when she got a phone call she was rolling her eyes & when hung up loudly said, \\"Jesus Christ.\\" I understand, people are annoying. I've worked in the service industry & it's horrible but when your host area is totally open & people are right in front of you, that's totally unprofessional. Just not very welcoming as you're waiting to be seated. Our server was ridiculous. When asked what a particular wine was like ... blank stare. I asked if she could compare it to something - like is it similar to a cabernet, for example. And she says, \\"Oh no,\\" & continues to look at me like I'm crazy then tries to correct my pronunciation and points to something on the menu & I don't even know what she was trying to say or suggest we order. Anyway, hello - I speak Italian (not fluently, admittedly). OK so we get past that and order the original bottle I wanted. \\n\\nLater, we ask about the mushroom pizza. Blank stare. I offer another example, what kind of mushrooms? Duh (another patronizing expression), \\"The little grey ones.\\" Are you kidding me?! So I ask if they're fresh (bc to me little grey ones sound like they could possibly be canned, wtf?) and I throw out some other examples again - \\"Are they crimini, oyster...\\" And she just looks at me and agrees and again we move on. \\n\\nThe wine was nice, pizza was gloppy cheese but the crust at the top w/o cheese was good (mushrooms were fine but nothing special - regular white mushrooms). My friend's Alfredo chicken was OK - typical mistake of over-saucing, though. Our calamari app was cooked nicely - crunchy outside, tender calamari but it was a little too salty & oily. Our nutella creme br√ªl√©e was delicious although it tasted more like Dutch chocolate than nutella. \\n\\nIf you're going to call yourselves an Italian kitchen & wine bar, realize that's a lot to live up to so you have to train your servers properly.

By the end of the hour, all the tables were full and other people were eyeing to see if I was going to leave soon. \\n\\nLike a true fatty, I got two of their cakes-- le russe and passionfruit. Each of their cakes were a decent size for one piece. I got each thinking that le russe would be the cake that I'd enjoy on a chilly November day and the passionfruit would be a well-meant but under-fulfilling cake that didn't truly combine the taste of passionfruit into a bread form. Nope. I was wrong. I favored the passionfruit cake-- the cake itself was light and fluffy, and the gelee and mousse was what made the passionfruit flavor hit you distinctly and deliciously. I'm not a huge fan of macarons because I think they're over hyped, but the delicate and small half macarons on the side were a cute and nice balance against the passionfruit hit. \\n\\nLe russe was a little too sugary for me. I know, I know. What do I expect at a patisserie, idiot. I'm in favor of sweet snacks that are more subtle or a bit muted compared to the diabetes-inducing sugar bombs in the US, which I'm used to. With that said, I expected the cake to be a bit more varied in flavor with the amount of sugar that was in the buttercream. This could also be because I had the passionfruit cake side-by-side for comparison, but I think this would be more suited for my fellow American who's used to super sweet things in the country south of the border. \\n\\nI tried their London fog tea latte-- excellent. This is a fantastic drink to balance the sugary desserts you will be swallowing at this establishment. As a tea latte, it has a hint of sweetness, without the bitter taste of a regular tea. I'm not a big tea drinker since I'm not adult enough to tolerate the bitterness quite yet, so this was a perfect match for me."},{"name":"Navarre","address":"10 NE 28th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Great find!

Each dish is meant to be served family style and shared and \\"small\\" is usually the perfect size for two people.

Even the chicken grain bowl looked good too. \\nWe started with some chicken wings and I will warn you they are delicious and spicy. If you can't take spicy might wanna ask about the sauce before you order. As a burger boutique, the choice of angus beef is a definitely unique. We tried the New York strip with dry aged beef patty and the Oaxaca burger that is topped with pico di gallo and avocado.

When we told them the service was really bad she even had the audacity to give us a cold glare before we left. I never write reviews but I definitely had to warn others about this one.

I have, for some time, had mixed thoughts about writing this review and ultimately decided to do so.\\n\\nWith very few exceptions on visits here-and-there, the food has been excellent. By and large, the ribeye I used to get at DFG was one of the best (if not the best) I've had in the Greater Boston area. Similarly, service by most of the \\"original\\" folks was friendly and attentive, enough so that we had a short list of servers we would request regularly. Whether we went by ourselves or - on occasion - with our kids, we were always treated well. Drinks have usually been strong and consistently prepared.\\n\\nSo why am I writing this, you may wonder? When visiting for my wife's birthday, despite multiple requests on my part, her birthday was not acknowledged. Not even a little candle was put on her dessert. Personally, I do not like to complain, especially on \\"the day of\\" if we've had an otherwise-good meal and nothing too egregious has happened. Thus, we went home. Besides, I truly could not remember whether DFG typically sang \\"happy birthday\\", brought candles, etc., and was confused. I sent the restaurant a private note via OpenTable, and received no response.\\n\\nI visited again with a friend, and coincidentally sat with the same server that dropped the ball on the birthday. Dinner was uneventful (though she did mess up my rewards points, something that was later rectified). On my way out, I saw multiple instances of folks' birthdays being acknowledged in various ways. So, my \\"confusion\\" was cleared up, and I now knew that a mistake had been made on our \\"birthday visit\\". I sent the restaurant a note, this time via their own website (which I've used before for miscellaneous communication, and it works). I received NO RESPONSE.\\n\\nThis is why I am writing this review. I can tolerate an honest mistake like this (and even bigger ones), but when I contact a business not once, but twice, and there is no response, it bothers me. We were regulars, as I mentioned, so needless to say, at the time, I was merely looking to share feedback about our visit, not to raise a huge stink (so to speak).

Try the Nasi Goreng (my absolute favorite), the Tiger's Tears, the Thai Pork Lettuce Wraps, or the Hot and Sour Soup.  And don't forget dessert, because the lemon mousse and the vegan chocolate mousse are both super delicious.  \\n\\n2.  The service!  (Always a close second to the food.)  These people are friendly and GENUINE, not at all condescending, and willing to accomodate all my annoying special needs.  The chef actually picked all the cilantro out of the Tiger's Tears for me because I'm one of those unfortunate people who only tastes soap when I eat the evil, demon weed that always ruins tasty food.  Also, I have a gluten allergy (Which I'm trying hard to come to terms with.  Seriously, pity me.  I miss beer so much.

This place is funky without trying too hard, and not at all pretentious.  I love sitting at the chef's bar and watching the cooks do their thing in the immaculate open kitchen.  \\n\\n4.  The affordability!  You can eat great food, have some delicious drinks, gaze at your date in the just-dim-enough lighting, and groove out to fun music all for a very reasonable price.  The Nasi Goreng that I was talking about is only $14, and I always have enough left over for a solid snack.  \\n\\n5.  The convenience!  I can always find parking in this part of town, and when you're hungry, you don't want to mess around looking for parking.  \\n\\nIn an effort not to be such a fangirl, I will tell you that I do have a few, very minor complaints:  #1, I wish they were open an hour later, so that industry people like myself could have delicious asian goodness when they get out of work...and #2, the window bench seats are tiny and uncomfortable, and this is coming from a small person.

On the down side, its never very crowded, service is spotty, and for whatever various reasons there appears to be a cadre of disgruntled former patrons who would rather eat at least one of their own limbs before setting foot in this place again.  \\n\\nBut if there is anything that Big City will have contributed to history, and there is, it is the simple brilliance of the PERFECT PLATE OF NACHOS.  \\n\\nI'll explain.  Normally, when ordering nachos, certain expectations, sometimes stretched in optimistic anticipation, are held in regards to a plate of nachos.  Firstly, there will be lots of melted-and-resolidified cheese, then a tall stack of chips, and finally a sprinkling of various canned pantry goods over the top.  Even the best nachos, defying these unwritten conventions, retain the fatal flaw of the various remaining layers of dry chips.  As everyone reaches for the scarce resources adorning the top, a barren wasteland of chips lays testament to the nachos which, though perhaps satisfying, once again end in a disappointment so expected that we hardly even notice it.  \\n\\nBut one evening, over a casual game of pool and a plate of nachos, something miraculous happened.  It was the Mediterranean nachos plate, consisting of baked pita chips, loads of ingredients including hummus and an astounding array of fresh vegetables.  Once one bite entered the mouth, it was almost physically impossible to stop the next.  \\n\\nAs we plowed our way though these nachos in a drunken, belly-full state of euphoria, this was when Big City really showed its stripes.  After polishing off the top layer of chips, instead of a barren pile of chips, there was instead a crater of chips: to our amazement and delight, in this crater was a whole new reservoir of hummus and toppings, plenty for all the rest of the nachos.  It was like a fairy tale with a happy ending, and as we left that bar,we traveled onwards into the legend-ary night with sated and contented bellies, well aware that we had experienced something out of the ordinary.\\n\\nLong story short, try the nachos."},{"name":"Blue Star Donuts","address":"1155 SW Morrison St, Ste 102","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Underwhelming and expensive.

We have Yelp's high score to thank for pointing us in this direction.\\n\\nWe needed a place with good food, not far from Rogers Arena, and it's hard to imagine anything surpassing Medina on either score. We got there a couple hours before puckdrop, given the somewhat unusual pleasure of going out to brunch rather than dinner before an NHL game. The more efficiency-minded among us immediately said he'd rather find someplace else when he saw the line, but the host affably assured me we'd wait only half an hour. That was a little optimistic, but the wait was easily worth it.\\n\\nThis is what I think of as a classic downtown metropolitan restaurant, with exposed brick walls in a long narrow space. Old construction. Beautiful. I managed to literally bump into half the people in Vancouver trying to navigate the narrow space while I got us on the list and got myself an Americano. But that's on me, not them. The coffee turned out to be absolutely brilliant, with rich and complex flavors and not a trace of any unwelcome bitterness. We, with our shirttails hanging out, joined the impeccably dressed Vancouverites on the sidewalk while we waited for them to call our names.\\n\\nWedged in a display area inside the window is a hustling, sweaty, nice-looking kid manning multiple waffle irons. He's cranking out waffles faster than the baristas are cranking out drinks, and that ought to tell you something. The smell is overwhelmingly good, between the toasty waffles, hot coffee, and interesting spices wafting out from the kitchen in back. \\n\\nWe got a table under a beautifully executed abstract landscape oil on canvas. Really a welcome creative touch to the room--one of several canvasses in the series. Every bit of furniture and decor was clearly chosen with taste and care, but nothing's flashy or overbearing in the slightest. They had Traffic on the speakers--Steve Winwood's beautiful voice is a great accompaniment to breakfast, but putting on one of their records and letting it play to the end was a highly unexpected and very hip call on somebody's part. \\n\\nWe got more coffee and she was smart enough to order a waffle with salted caramel dipping sauce. These come out before breakfast. She let her beau and me try bites, and we damn near tackled the waitress putting in orders for waffles of our own. I told her to surprise me with whichever dipping sauce sounded good to her, and she brought out dark chocolate. Delicious, and classic. God, those are good waffles. 3.5\\" or so, crusty outside, chewy inside, rich nutty toasty flavor. Other waffles probably feel bad about themselves when they find out.\\n\\nThe menu is reasonably focused, offering a dozen or so dishes mostly served in skillets. The names are all in French, but the cuisine is virtually all Moroccan, at least in origin. She had the short ribs with poached eggs and greens. He had the breakfast cassoulet with thick-cut slab bacon, cooked twice. Breakfast cassoulet? That's one of those brilliant ideas that somebody must have thought of before, but is still brilliant here whether they're the first ones to do it or not. I wish I could have that any time I wanted. I had the lamb meatballs, which aren't very breakfasty, but are good 24 hours a day, so stop looking at me like that. They were on the breakfast menu. He and I kept chugging Americanos, but she had a Moroccan mimosa, which had shredded figs and delicious spices in it. Beautiful breakfast drink.\\n\\nThis is a great breakfast spot for a romantic morning together, or to spend with friends. I would damn near drive to Vancouver from Seattle to have breakfast here.

You'd think it was a nightclub. They pitch you on drinks the whole time, especially margaritas. Kinda wish I'd had one; the tequila might've taken the edge off. The service ranges from sneering to fawning. They were rude and pushy before we paid (you pay when you place your order), and attentively polite after. We witnessed one staff member throw a brief tantrum. Like a lot of other things about Hopdoddy, it's confusing that they went the extra mile to make a bass-ackwards shambles rather than just doing it right, which would have taken less effort anyway. The seating system is confusing, but, in a Jekyll moment, they explained it clearly and succinctly to us, and it proved not to be a problem at all.\\n\\nThe burgers were some of the most well-engineered, structurally, I've ever seen. Getting a burger to hold together after the first bite with an over-easy egg on it, or with chili, is no mean feat, and they do it well. It obviously took thought and effort. But then the burger itself is bland, with little or no char. It's damp rather than juicy, gray, and seems almost steamed. There is no seasoning in the meat, and while it is obviously of good quality, little beef flavor. Except for a gelatinous slickness and the faint whiff of tallow, it might've been pork or veal. Why go to all that effort when you can't be bothered to force some FLAVOR into it? There are plenty of interesting toppings, but many of them were short on flavor, too. The chili was offensively bad, flavorless nubbins in a thin sauce, with a faint metal flavor and no heat. There was more flavor in the lettuce and the bun than in anything else (which were actually good. Again, why go to the trouble to hit that home run when you're going to foul on the burger?)\\n\\nThe fries were pale and soft, with a bit of salt and good potato flavor. They would have benefited from a second fry for crispness, but are satisfying enough. They have some green sprinkles which, so far as I can tell, neither help nor hinder. The iced tea is not good, but they have Maine Root on tap, always a fine choice. Bottom line: they expended a lot of effort to get certain things right, and a lot more effort to get certain things shockingly, saddeningly wrong, and it isn't worth the hassle."},{"name":"Barley Swine","address":"6555 Burnet Rd, Ste 400","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"Prepare for one of the best meals in your life.

The prices are Disney, so don't be cheap and just go with it. You are on vacation after all. Walking around Animal Kingdom with 44oz of Safari Amber in me made the day even better.

This is where things get awkward. Fast. I apologized, and said I didn't have a question, but I told her there was hardly any flavor and I was dissatisfied. She said she could have it fixed. Given the long time it took to establish wait service, my date was already half done with the meal and I said I just didn't have time to wait for a re-made dish. She gets angry and says that I just wasn't hungry. I said no. She then says that everyone was getting this dish and there haven't been any complaints. I again said no. Then she walks away with my plate and says I just didn't want to pay for the dish.

Not knowing the exact location of this place, we looked online for the address and went for a drive. I saw the little sandwich board outside a set of doors and walked up to the doors to let myself in, and the doors were locked. Confused, I started pulling harder and tried looking through the glass, but all I was really getting was a reflection of the sun. That's when the BF was like I think the entrance is over here... pointing to another set of doors a little further down. Why the heck the sandwich board was in front of these locked doors I do not know???\\n\\nWe got inside the small narrow restaurant and one of the waitresses cleaned off a table and put two menus on it. I might be being a bit picky about this, but after doing so, she didn't guide us to the table - not that it was far, but some kind of gesture letting us know you are ready for us would have been nice. In any case, we seated ourselves at the little table, and when I say little I mean my fat ass could barely squeeze between the two tables to sit down without knocking someone's drink over. \\n\\nThe BF and I decided to start with a cesar, since it was a nice lazy Saturday. While we waited for our beverages and cruised the menu, we realized it was a pretty meat-based list. I was a little put off, but I thought if La Brasserie had made us a veggie breakfast, I'm sure this place could too. We inquired with the waitress about what they had for us herbivores, and she pointed out a few menu items that could be made veggie as well. The BF got the veggie omelet of the day, and I had the Tagine, without the meat. Our drinks arrived and as I lifted the straw out to mix up my cesar after squirting the lime into it, a thick red substance trickled out of my straw back into my drink. It looked gross. After stirring it a bit more and trying not to think about it, I noticed a bright red pastey liquid at the bottom of my glass. I dared to take a sip to figure out what exactly they had done to this drink and it turns out they must have dumped a bunch of hot sauce in the bottom of the glass when making the cesar. I liked the addition of a peppered cucumber slice as garnish, but the hot sauce just made the whole drink pretty much undrinkable. That was probably the worst cesar I have ever had in my life. Tabasco yes, thick hot sauce that you're supposed to put on chili = no. I didn't even finish half of it, and for six bucks I felt pretty ripped off since most places have them for like $4.50.\\n\\nBrunch arrived, and was average.

Based on online reviews I selected the buffet before we even arrived. The cabbage rolls sounded great & I always look for a good weiswurst. (Hard to find - it's Austrian sausage, not German) But, um... we looked at the buffet before ordering - 3 kinds of sausages (no white wurst), finely ground meatloaf, mac & cheese (what?!), and most unacceptable of all... NO speatzle. Seriously - speatzle is flour, milk, egg and salt. It can't be any cheaper, even if they use boxed. It undeniably HAS to be at a German buffet. So.. now we had to choose from the menu. We asked the waitress' advice & she suggested the buffet - uh, no. Was that just to make her job easier? We opted for a pork shank which was advertised on a table tent, and the well-reviewed cabbage rolls. Trying to sample the \\"most German\\" sides, we selected speatzle, sauerkraut, potato pancakes and potato salad. The speatzle was a substitution for the mashed potatoes that were supposed to come with the pork. I'm guessing that's why we got beef gravy - assuming it came with the side, not the pork. It is definitely boxed/bagged spaetzle - the flattish, rounder, nearly gnocci version. They must pan sear it, because it is a tad crispy and very tasty. The sauerkraut tastes like any old canned/bagged sauerkraut - just high vinegar; no seasonings. (Germans I know either season it with fennel or cut the tartness with apples.) Oh, look! They sell bags of kraut in the showcase... you can open that & have the EXACT stuff at home. The potato pancakes were (5) quarter sized very thin crispy treats. Picture a flat seasoned tater-tot. Not a bad offering for pseudo authentic, yet bought frozen. They were served with chunky applesauce which tasted like sweetened Mott's, but the chunks outsized the cute 'pancakes'. And the final side: potato salad. That I really liked. It definitely had the required vinegar and bacon flavors, and a good consistency. As for the main dishes... The pork shank was delicious and more than enough meat. It was almost crisp on the outside yet tender and moist on the inside. The cabbage roll itself was very good. The meat was finely ground and tightly pressed (commercial?) but tasty. The sauce was slightly sweet. It was very, very similar to an Italian marinara. I would've preferred a \\"deeper\\" taste - like paprika or herbs. Hubby ordered a (12oz, $4) hefewiezen beer the waitress described as \\"like Blue Moon\\". Thankfully, it wasn't; it was better. I asked for a gluwein, but they were \\"out of it.\\" What again? Gluwein is warmed wine with seasonings... again, they must be using a commercially prepared option. All in all, the place is clean. The theme excuses the rock hard wooden seating. The German translation of famous movie lines playing in the restroom is amusing. The touches of stained glass are really pretty. Nothing was sticky except for the mustard jar on the table. (horseradish jar was fine, though) The waitress was okay. She said all the required pleasantries, but definitely seemed to have had enough of this less-than-exciting-for-her place. The bottom line (in my opinion) is that this restaurant has been around SO long, and lives on 1) it's reputation and 2) it's lack of competition that the management has allowed the food, experience, menu, etc. to drop over the 5 generations of ownership to the easiest level. Were they to lose the commercially prepared items for made on site, and were they to teach the staff some German & revive their enthusiasm for the culture, this place would be awesome.

The bartenders are usually quick and efficient, even when women are constantly trying to get Kenyon's attention.  To maximize your efficiency, order beer and single liquor drinks.

Simple and good never needs the fan fare. However, the occasional surprise with fusion cooking is a bonus but not at all needed at Flip. I went to a Foodnetwork Top Chef demonstration and saw Richard make a frozen nitrogen PB&J and it was delicious. But, when it melted it was still just PB&J. When it comes to Flip it's a burger joint. They have many options. The first time I went it was the basic \\"Flip\\" burger. You can't go wrong. Local and micro brewed beers were the choice that day. We paired it with the onion rings. The second trip was the turkey burger on a lettuce wrap with guacamole sprouts and pomegranate catsup with homemade fries. I washed it all down with a Nehi Orange soda. I feel the best part of any top chef is understanding how to sell simplicity to the public without them really knowing it. The freshest of ingredients placed together in such a way that the food shines through.

I can't say enough nice things about this place.  The restaurant is located on N. Highland in a renovated home, so the atmosphere is very intimate and comfortable. The service is superb.  From the moment you walk into the door you will only see smiling faces and hear nice, friendly voices. \\nNow for the food:\\n1. mussels: more than delicious.  There was earlier review that said the mussels were just ok, and I would highly disagree.  The mussels are perfectly steamed in a white wine, strawberry, serrano pepper broth that is absolutely delicious.  Again, the mussels are perfectly steamed, very tender and not rubbery at all.  This dish is so good that you'll want to keep the broth to dip your bread into.\\n2. Filet Mignon: I tend to like my steaks med-rare and with a lot of flavor and this steak definitely had flavor.  They served the steak with onion rings on top and a gorgonzola sauce that is very tasty.  A piece of the onion ring, meat, and a dab of the sauce is a little bite of yummmm.  Also served with this dish is horseradish mashed potatoes, greens, and pureed squash.\\n3. scallops: my husband had the scallops and they were very good as well.  They were perfectly seared served with a onion confit. You have to eat the scallop with a bite of the onion confit. Separately, the flavors are just ok, but together they well compliment each other.  \\n4.Cassoulet: This is like a french chili served on an iron skillet. It has duck, sausage, beans, and I'm not sure what else is in it.  I am sure that it was very good.  If you like duck and you normally like chili, then you will love this dish.  It's also great left over.\\n5.Chocolate Bread Pudding: Yummmm.... I normally don't like bread pudding, but this bread pudding is amazing. It's nice, chocolaty, moist, gooey with a wafer of crunchy sugar separating it from the scoop of homemade banana ice cream on top.  The wafer of sugar gives nice texture to each bite. This dessert is a must before you leave the restaurant.\\nWith all this said, Babette's is definitely on my top 10 favorite restaurants in Atlanta.  The food is excellent. The service is superb. What more can you ask for? Also, they have a supper menu on Tues to Thurs evenings before 6:15 that includes an appetizer and entree for $18.

I've been here several times and I've realized it's their mimosas and fresh squeezed juices that keep me coming back.  The food is good, too, but it's really their drinks, space and  location that make me frequent this place.  I like their omelettes and French toast.  My husband likes their chorizo hash.  The potatoes that come with my omelette are great and the ketchup they serve is not Heinz and you can tell.

The staff is friendly, service is speedy, and if the food is nothing out of the expected, it is reliably satisfying and inexpensive. Cold beers and tasty margaritas start things off right, and the menu offers uncommon diversity of dishes including the usual tacos, burritos, enchiladas, chalupas, with your choice of beef or chicken. The kitchen loves cheese, and you'll get your share, no matter what. The grilled salmon and chicken with onions and peppers are almost always at our top of the \\"don't miss\\" list.\\n\\nFor a cheap night out with good drinks and very respectable food, we'd recommend Los Loros highly.

My favorite thing about eating here is the mayo dipping sauce for the french fries.  That stuff is addictive!\\n\\nIf you've never been, you have to try the Krispy Kreme or Nutella shakes.  Just make sure to have them split it into 2 glasses and share it with someone.  After the main meal, you won't have room for a shake that rich.  The Krispy Kreme shake is probably my favorite because you can really taste the deliciousness of a Krispy Kreme glazed doughnut."},{"name":"Burnside Brewing","address":"701 E Burnside St","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"It's my first visit here, and I came for Burger Week.

Next time, I'll come by for drinks too!\\n\\nNow, this burger was the most impressive looking burger of the 3 I've had this week. I guess that's what was so disappointing about it. First, there was a sickening odor wafting across the outside area. You'd think it'd be the wonderful smokiness aboit the grills, but no.... I'm not sure but I could almost confirm one of the contributing factors were the Kool-Aid pickles. Anyway, the burger was pretty bland and really needed a tasty beer to go with it. Plus, in my excitement to get the burger in the first place, I forgot to grab napkins. I scanned all around and there weren't any that I could see. So I guess that's why they called it \\"The Dirty Burger\\" since you'll be eating it sans napkins.

There was no mention of this on their website. We ordered some small dishes, which ended up being pretty bad.  The Serrano wrapped shrimp was so over cooked that it was tough, the polenta was dry and had no flavor, then the croquetas tasted like they had been soaked in grease.

I like the ahi tuna burger because of the special wasabi kick. and the greek burger is just amazing. The greek burger is extremely heavy and makes you feel like you need to go run at least 5 miles to burn it off. It is well worth to go running for. They use Amy's ice cream in their chocolate milk shake, which was really good, but I wish they had dark chocolate! Anyways the wait is long and you have to stand up the whole time, but you can definitely have  brewsky or a mixed cocktail while you wait. They have pretty good signature cocktails too.

We tried the Netflix and Chill date night (there were three options - one seemed more vegetarian, the other more seafood). Our courses were Korean BBQ sloppy joes, spicy lamb noodles, Chinese greens, and green papaya salad. Honestly I think it's hard to do fancy Asian food, especially fusion Asian food....so while everything was tasty, I wasn't blown away. I did enjoy the spicy lamb noodles because they were very similar to the Xi'An famous foods noodles I love so much. The sloppy joes were just fine - the bread in particular was bland, but the sweet potato chips on the side were cooked perfectly. I enjoyed the sauce on the market greens, but these, again, were nothing super different from normal Chinese food. The cocktails were tasty although not super strong, and we finished our meal with the Birthday Cake - literally what it sounds like, Devil's Food! \\n\\nOverall I'm glad I tried this and see why it's gotten so many positive reviews, but probably won't be my go-to or one of my favorite restaurants in Boston.

It is only one page (which is available on their website), but there are so many tasty options. I opted for the osso buco burger (veal + gremolata + onion crispies).

Sweet potato fries with oaxacan chocolate salt with what looked like ranch for dipping was absolutely divine.\\n\\nLiquid nitrogen milkshakes were so-so. Flavors were interesting. Nutella/toasted marshmallow milkshake tasted just like a chocolate milkshake - no hint of nutella at all, but still tasty. Key lime milkshake was wonderful as well, the best part being the graham cracker bits at the bottom. These can be split in two into smaller glasses (martini glasses actually) and shared with friends.\\n\\nMy friends got the salmon burger (smoked salmon) and the tuna burger.

As for the grub, everything was incredibly flavorful - we tried the squash chips (the low point of the evening, would be better if the sauce was served on the side, as it made the chips soggy), the meatballs (absolutely spectacular, the bean ragu was amazing), the grilled oysters (yum, perfectly seasoned and cooked), and the grilled octopus (delicious, great char on the outside and very tender).  Unfortunately, because the service was a bit lacking, we would sit with empty/dirty plates for very lengthy periods of time before we would be asked if we wanted anything else or before things would be cleared.  It also took a very long time before they realized we had put our credit card down to cash out and leave.

Many of you in Atlanta, and, actually, by virtue of your interest in the show Top Chef, many others know that Flip's overall menu concept and operation came from Richard Blais, a contestant and finalist from Top Chef Chicago. In Top Chef Blais showed his unique and innovative style of molecular gastronomy which now is displayed in full view in West side Atlanta (merely 300 yards from my house) at his new restaurant located on Howell Mill Drive. The concept is simple - burgers, but the burgers themselves are far from simplistic. \\n\\nAlthough Blais is careful not to scare off the unadventurous by including the \\"typical\\" American hamburger, updated of course, his menu his carefully thought out and contains a panoply of unique offerings for even the most discerning palate. Each burger is carefully crafted into roughly four ounce \\"patties\\" adorned with perfectly matched condiments. Many of them have whimsical names such as the \\"Pat√© Melt,\\" \\"Po Boyger,\\" and \\"Turf and Earth.\\" All of them, at least the ones that I have tried, are delicious. The Pat√© Melt is still my hands down favorite consisting of veal and pork, Swiss cheese, cornichons, lingonberry and Dijon. Other favorites are the steak tartar and tuna tartar burgers where condiments such as garlic, chile, capers, Worcestershire and smoked mayo for the former and pickled ginger and Vietnamese herb salad for the latter balance the delicate \\"rawness\\" of the burgers perfectly. \\n\\nToday I branched out a bit and tried the Chorizo burger and a simple Butcher Cut. The Chorizo burger, albeit a messy endeavor, was brimming with the flavors of romesco ketchup, smoked mayo and Manchego cheese. The fried egg on top was a wonderful surprise and worked well with the spiciness of the chorizo. No flavors were lost and each bite was more superb than the previous one. The Butcher Cut was also good, but, exactly as one would expect a burger to taste with blue cheese and caramelized onions. Although the red wine jam added a delightful fruitiness you would not expect in a burger with the strong flavors of onion and bleu cheese. My choice of side today was a bit rich for the overall meal, but had to be done - veal sweetbread nuggets. It is just so hard to pass up something that sounds so sophisticatedly pedestrian. They were amazing. Not Holeman and Finch amazing, but tasty in their own right. Deep fried with panko breadcrumbs and accompanied by a slightly tangy sweet and sour sauce, they were both delicate and flavorful. Even those who normally shy away from organ might appreciate the flavor profiles in these little nuggets. Needless to say they were enjoyable, if not filling.\\n\\nIf you do come to Flip, make sure at least on one visit you leave room for the milkshakes. This is one of Blais' specialty creations as he puts his molecular gastronomy background to the test. Right now the offerings consist of krispy kreme, nutella and burnt marshmallow as well as the experimental pistachio and white truffle oil and finally foie gras milkshakes. I was dying to try the foie gras as I am a lover of all things goose liver, but there was simply no room at the inn this time around. \\n\\nMy only complaint about Flip is the crowd. Even on a Friday afternoon at 1:30 p.m. there was a line out the door. Luckily I had the privilege of dining with my favorite person, me, and therefore was able to grab a seat at the bar without a wait. Not surprisingly, Flip has been packed, with waits of 30 to 45 minutes since the day it opened and now has waits upwards of an hour and a half. As far as I know they still do not take reservations, but, frankly, if you want a good burger at reasonable prices (with the exception of the lobster burger, all burgers are under $10 and sides under $5), it is worth the wait to experience it. If all you want is a typical hamburger, I would suggest not wasting your time as the concept and food will be lost on you."},{"name":"Ikenohana","address":"14308 SW Allen Blvd","city":"Beaverton","stars":"4","text":"The service here is not their strong point. You can wait 10 minutes at the door without even being acknowledged, let alone seated. A simple, \\"Hi. We'll be right with you,\\" would go a long way. There are only ever two servers so the fuller the place the slower and poorer the service. There also a bit of a grunge factor about the place. So why do we keep coming back? Because it's just about the best sushi in Beaverton. The selection and quality is terrific for the price range. The sushi is good and once you're seated the service is friendly enough. We love the Godzilla roll and the Ikenohana roll and all the nigiri. There are plenty of yummy alternatives like soup and tempura for those who don't want sushi. The lack of pomp actually makes one feel even more comfortable. We really love this place and it is one of our Beaverton favorites. Just don't be in a hurry or get here early. As a combination of quality and value I'd give it 5 stars if the service was better, but highly recommend nonetheless."},{"name":"Schmidt's Sausage Haus","address":"240 E Kossuth St","city":"Columbus","stars":"4","text":"if you like German food like sausages, 'kraut, beers! this place is great quality in a cool neighbourhood. also its not far from 70 so excellent place to stop when on a long trip. also the street that its on is named for a famous Hungarian revolutionary!"},{"name":"Babette's Cafe","address":"573 N Highland Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"This small house on the corner of Highland and Freedom Parkway fits my idea of a comfortable neighborhood bistro well.

A solo diner will love the bar as it is blocked off from the main dining room so you don't feel stared at.  \\n\\nMenu is eclectic and more European, so if you are tired of all these new southern cuisine restaurants around it should be refreshing.  Mussels are plump, soft, delicious.  I find the entrees not terribly exciting, but mostly tasty, particularly enjoying the duck but not so much the winter special cassoulet.  There is a paella which of course I had to try, it being one of my favorite dishes.  Quite massive dish was decent, not great, with good flavor and toppings, wish there's squid, hated the dry and tough chicken breast.  I like the many small dish options like meat balls, piroshksi, ravioli for sharing, though the menu changed to reduce the choices in this department as of late.  Love the wine prices here, good wines too.  Also, I always, always look forward to the bread when I sit down--loaf of baguette from Bread Garden, fat and crispy and smells wonderful.

Upon spending a few hours there last night, I would say that Pier 6 has some work to do.\\n\\nLast night the intention was to check out the newest Chucktown spot for a drink or two, but we ended up putting our name in for a table.  I am glad that we did because we got a gorgeous private room right on the water.  Although the room was simple, with only one large table, candles, and one lamp, it was very beachy, and, as a woman I was with described it, it was a scene perfect for instagram. \\n\\nIf one private room was all that a restaurant needed to get 5 stars, Pier 6 would be there.  Unfortunately, there were a few things that knocked a potential 5 star review down to only 2 stars.\\n\\nSo: Onto the more important items such as food, service and value:\\n\\nFood:  Pier 6 is trying to be a little too upscale from what I saw of their limited menu.  The menu ranges from small plates at $7ea to the scallops entree at an expensive $31 (for 5).\\n\\nLobster Bisque- Very very strange.  I am not sure why there were so many ingredients in this but it was as if they were trying to make up for the fact that they don't know how to make it?  Make it simple and make it delicious without all the distractions!\\n\\nCeviche- I believe this was a flounder ceviche and I found it pretty boring and undersalted.\\n\\nTomato salad- Very plain small salad for $10.  The dressing is also too overpowering/sour.\\n\\nScallops- The scallop dish was very good with the big plump scallops some sort of lentil mixture underneath.  This was a heavier, more winter feeling dish at a very high price point.\\n\\nChicken- The standard half chicken with mashed potatoes and mushrooms that most restaurants that are trying to fit into this category serve.  The chicken was cooked perfectly and the mushrooms were a nice touch.\\n\\nLobster Roll- Who doesn't love a good lobster roll?  Who doesn't love to pay $25 for a good lobster roll?  This girl.  It's fairly common knowledge in NE that Lobster prices are pretty low and stuffing lobster into a plain roll and putting it next to french fries doesn't make it worth $25.  I understand operating costs and the like, but few \\"regulars\\" are going to be attracted to this lack of value.\\n\\nTomato/Risotto- We didn't get this vegetarian option but just wanted to comment on the fact that one of the entree items was two stuffed tomatoes over risotto for $21.  Little steep for tomatoes and risotto, no?\\n\\nService- Service was a bit spotty with what seemed to be some newer busboys and foodrunners.  Few things about the service that need to be fixed:\\n\\n1- Please don't auction food.  Know who ordered what, and, if people are sharing at the table, please coordinate with the waitress accordingly.  As we shared everything as a group last night, it is unnecessary to explain to put the food anywhere on the table every time a dish comes out.\\n\\n2- When drinks are served the waiter should NEVER touch the rim of the glass.  Every drink, even wine, was served with the waiter's hand over the top.  One waiter had black finger nails and it was unappealing for them to be all over the wine I was about to sip.\\n\\n3- Lots of fumbling when clearing the table.  When stacking the plates there was a lot of slamming of dishes and dropping of silverware.  If you want people to pay upscale dining prices, you have to have good table service.  Some basic training in clearing tables could go a long way.\\n\\n4- Where is the owner?  Oh that's right, he is the owner at Mija who is notorious for not saying hello to regulars.  This is Charlestown.  Please respect the local hospitality and introduce yourself if you want people to return.  Stop into Navy Yard Bistro if you need some pointers!\\n\\nPier 6:  We really really really want to come back frequently, and not just Thursday-Saturday.  Make the price points favorable to going out on a Monday night.   I would suggest reducing the prices and simplifying the menu a bit.\\n\\nI will be back when they have their full menu finalized and hopefully have a better update."},{"name":"Knuckle Sandwich","address":"2137 E Burnside St, Ste D","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Sandwiches are pretty good and atmosphere is casual and relaxed.

They're better than \\"meh\\" but certainly not \\"A-OK\\".\\n\\nFirst trip to Blue Star February 21st just after 9am. My roommate & I ordered just 2 items to split, the apple fritter and the Valrohna Chocolate Crunch. The apple fritter was great! Looking forward to the next one!\\n\\nThe Valrohna Chocolate Crunch was a freaking disaster. My bearded roommate bit into it and it, literally, EXPLODED. What wasn't dripping off of his beard was in his lap, all over his hands and the paper the donut was served on. Our first response... shock. Wide eyes and \\"What the heck just happened??\\" Then we were like \\"WTF, who puts creme anglaise in a freaking donut!?\\" You can't eat that. You wear that. After the clean up we approached the woman at the counter and told her what happened. Her response was \\"ohhh... somebody must have filled the donuts while they were still hot.\\" And we said/asked \\"So, there shouldn't have been liquid inside, it should have been a more solid cream filling?\\" She said yes. And that was that. Yay customer service!\\n\\nWe've been Googling & asking around and we've found nothing that said you have to wait for the donuts to cool before filling or your custard will turn to liquid and never set up again....\\n\\nBlue Star is upper end. The prices reflect that. The customer service should have too. As in \\"hey come back another day for a Valrohna Chocolate Crunch - done the correct way - on us.\\"\\n\\nI passed that feedback along and as a result when we returned to Blue Star on Sunday March 10th we were treated to a complimentary Valrohna Chocolate Crunch and we bought a Creme Brulee w/ pipette of Cointreau.  The inside of this Valrohna Chocolate Crunch was not liquid!  Yay!  BUT.... Bottom line, the filled donuts are messy as all get-out and just not easy to share.  Heck, they're just not easy to eat, period.  Take your first bite and most of the filling ends up on the paper!  The pipette full of cointreau, a nice thought, but in practical application a fail.  Try squirting it into the donut and the cointreau just oozes back out of the donut and ends up... you guessed it... on the paper.  Do yourself a favor and put the cointreau in your coffee.  And... order a non-filled donut.  Not AS messy, but messy, and easier to share.  I'm wondering when Blue Star is going to get around to offering patrons dining in, plates, knives & forks.  Worried about the environment... do the same thing you did at LBB.  Not difficult. \\n\\nAlso, seating kinda sucks.  There's just not much of it, it's all a window bar so that rules being social w/ more than 1 person out, and some of the seating is \\"obstructed\\".

I say patient, because some of the people in the party weren't fluent in English and I had to serve as translator for most of the night. We made reservations last minute as well, and were still given decent seating upstairs. \\n\\nI've been here three times now and agree that Coast does not serve the best seafood dishes in town, although the trendy ambiance and energetic vibe partly makes up for the taste experience. But disappointingly, for what you pay for, the main dishes lack creativity and taste. \\n\\nFor appetisers, we ordered the burrata (portobello, truffle oil, & egg yolk) and the dungeness crab cakes. The burrata came in with the delicious whiff of truffle oil and was served topped with salad greens and slices of portobello mushrooms. The flat bread had plenty of taste and it was a flavorful appetiser and good start to a meal. In contrast, the crab cakes lacked flavour and were served in unusual tater-tot-like shapes.\\n\\nI ordered their halibut, which was grilled and served with artichokes, fennel, olives, and fingerling potatoes. The sides are the same for all the seafood mains, and it's obvious the food is cooked separately. There's no coherence between the side and the fish, and the halibut lacked flavour. It was served as an isolated element of the dish, but it was bland by itself as simply a piece of slightly salted, grilled halibut. I can say the same for their other seafood mains, like their sable fish and white sturgeon.\\n\\nCoast may boast about serving fresh seafood, but the plainness in how they use the fish, which I feel should be the focus of any seafood restaurant, does not warrant such high prices. it's best to pay similar prices elsewhere, like the Blue Water Cafe, where I feel they produce more creative and thoughtful dishes than simply grilled/pan-seared fish and roasted vegetables. \\n\\nAside from the atmosphere and decent service, there is little reason to pay so much for a mediocre seafood experience."},{"name":"Thierry","address":"1059 Alberni Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4","text":"Best macarons in town.

I wasn't sure how busy they would be so I made reservations... and good thing I did! However, dinner still took almost 1.5 hours...\\n\\nAs others have mentioned, this is a small place.  On the day we were there, there was one sushi chef and two servers.  Everyone was friendly and courteous. Food, honestly, was excellent.  The fish was so fresh and clean cut! I would come back just based on that, but unfortunately... the pace.  I don't understand how the chef decides which table to serves first, but I waited a long time for my order.  First, my husband's chirashi came out ultra fast.  Then the kid's California rolls.  Break.  Then a few of my sushi pieces came.  Break. Miso soup.  Break.  One more piece of sushi arrived.  Break.  Sashimi.  Break.  A couple more.  Break.  This last break took 30 min and that's when we finally received our last four pieces of sushi.  All that waiting gave me ample time to digest so by the time dinner was said and done, I was hungry.  My husband was just sitting there waiting for me to get my food! \\n\\nDuring this time the chef would just serve tables at random.  I don't understand why he couldn't have made my 10 pieces of sushi at the same time and give them to me.  I felt like we were holding a table for no reason at all.  It wasn't just us - other tables received the same type of service but again, I just didn't understand the system.  On top of that, we were the second table there so I thought we would be able to have a quick dinner and leave.\\n\\nValue: portions are small, as with traditional Japanese.  Don't expect fist size rolls - expect pieces that you can fit into your mouth with one bite.  Prices are pretty average.  Selection of fish is good - there's some special items.  I do have to point this out - my husband added uni onto his chirashi and got two pieces.  My uni nigiri only came with one piece but it was the same price.

My man had the clam chowder, which was the low point in the meal; the flavor was good but the clams were really tough. I also tried his crab cakes, which were yummy. I couldn't resist the lobster on brioche (drippy but amazing), which also had avocado, tomato and lettuce with a huge salad side and garnishes of fried onions, white & sweet potatoes and a potato/green bean salad. The other meals all looked great (flaky scrod, meaty swordfish) too. \\n\\nDessert was the top: a molten dark chocolate with French vanilla bean ice cream and **Baked Alaska**!

It was basically a soggy pile of rice and beans.  The other three people I went with were not impressed with their burgers either.  One ordered a veggie burger as well and the guys got one of the specialty beef burgers.  The both declared that they have had much better elsewhere.

Upon arrival, we were ignored at the door for 5 minutes before being seated. The server seemed disinterested and explained the menu options - a la carte (on the blackboard), or the option of 7/11 courses \\"alla famiglia\\" - basically chef's selections. A bit silly of us, but we decided to go for the 11 course option. Might as well go big and have the whole experience.\\n\\nStarted off with a charcuterie board - olives, proscuitto, salami, some strange pickled artichoke. Tasty, but nothing mind-blowing. Very nice selection of olives though.\\n\\nNext came the \\"parmesan custard\\" with two emaciated slices of chargrilled bread. We were a group of 3 - would have been nice to have another piece of bread. I love my cheese, but this was SO rich and dense and overpowering that I couldn't have anymore of it after a couple of bites. \\n\\nThe butter lettuce salad with gorgonzola and walnuts was nice - again, nothing mind-blowing about it other than three chunks of frisee and dressing.\\n\\nThe pastas were also hit and miss - the walnut and gorgonzola ravioli of sorts was interesting. I'm not a huge fan of gorgonzola, and it really overpowered the whole dish. However, the squid ink risotto was AMAZING. Wow, I could've eaten a whole plate of that on its own...in fact I think definitely had more than my share!\\n\\nThe meat/fish dishes were very good. We were served halibut, and flank steak. I have to say that was probably one of the best steaks I've EVER eaten (and trust me I'm a huge steak girl). Perfectly cooked, medium rare, served with rapini. Made the meal absolutely worth it.\\n\\nCheese plate was a nightmare for me because there was more gorgonzola! Dessert was lemon mousse and also a Sacher torte (Chocolate cake with apricot jam). I found the options a bit out of place for an Italian restaurant, but they were quite good. When the bill arrived, we also got mini meringues which were lovely!\\n\\nPerhaps it was a bad bad bad decision on our part to go for 11 courses because I actually struggled by course number 6. The kitchen is clearly capable of fantastic cooking (squid ink risotto, steak, halibut) but there were too many dishes that left me wanting more. I get that it's rustic cooking, but simple food shouldn't equate to underwhelming.

Yeah, markedly undercooked.  Both were sent back and I was asked if I wanted something else  I bedrudgingly asked for the soup of the day which was a chicken and veggie soup.   Well, the soup was tepid and the chicken chunks reminded me of the chicken Subway uses in their subs. Let me allow you to sit with that for a moment...\\n\\nOverall, a poor dining experience.  I was initially charged for the salmon/salad but then the waitress realized her oversight and had it struck from the bill.  Not saying I wont ever go back but I feel like the feel of the restaurant has changed significantly.  The food seems a bit overpretentious to me.  Oh, and the manager who came to apologize for the awful salad/salmon looked like a facilities guy.

He did give his opinion when asked, which I like.\\n\\nThe menu has numerous vegetarian options.  It was hard to decide.  I wanted to try everything.  I ordered paneer vindaloo at a hotness of 2.  That is pretty mild, as it turns out.  The taste was pretty good.  As promiised, there were some vegetables that come with vindaloo.  The paneer was fine.  With a second dish of rice, it was enough for two meals, making the effective cost affordable.  As an appetizer, I had pakoras.  The pakoras were excellent!  Highly recommended.  Very large serving.   I had the spinach and paneer naan.  IIt was okay.  I wish I had picked something else.  \\n\\nMy friend has some sort of lamb dish.  It was his first Indian food experience and he loved it.  He also had chiicken samosas, which he complimented.\\n\\nIt was a pleasant and positive experience at the clay pit.

The mashed potatoes were fine, they were like...taken out of the stove, mashed up, and then forgotten about for half an hour. They were warm, but probably just the warmth of the kitchen did that. Same deal with the mac and cheese. Was it better than the other places I've eaten at? No. Would I come back again? No. Was it worth the energy to move my fork to my mouth from my plate?

Lo and behold, I found a spot that was maybe fifty yards from my appointed locale - and on the same said no less!  Are you kidding me?  This was too easy. Lady Luck was finally smiling at me & about to give me a High Five!  \\nOr maybe that was Fate about to give me \\"The Finger\\".  \\nI happily made my way towards Hopdoddy's only to find a line already out the door.  WTH, it was only 12:40 pm on a Sunday with a serious chance of rain.  The line had already curved toward the long side of the building & when that happens you're pretty much SOL as far as the essence of time is concerned.  \\nI waited in line for a total of 30 seconds then made my way to the front door to see the menu perched near it.  Gee, looked just like the one I saw online - no prices.  \\nA friend told me I could walk in and sit at the bar so as I was about to ask 1 of the 2 hostesses about such a thing into the cozy confines she went.  Here's the good part - she locked the door!  WTF!?  Am I to understand people will do whatever it takes to get into this place? People are that desperate for a freakin' burger that one had to lock the door behind them until they were to be properly seated?  \\nYup.  Fate gave me The Finger.\\nI had no intention of getting back in line.  I'm infamous for my refusal to wait in line at restaurants.  No place is worth wasting my time in such a fashion.  I'm not a snob.  There are other places with great food that provide value - and prices on the menu - ready and willing to serve me.  \\nSo, I waited a bit as the line lengthened.  A few minutes later, a nice man, his wife, and young child arrived on the scene so I struck up a conversation with them.  They hailed from Killeen and made the trek to Austin for two reasons -  spend time in area shops and for Hopdoddy's.  \\nReally?  What makes this place so special?  \\nTheir response was \\"they hand-form the patties and cook it the way you want\\".  \\nWell, as far as the latter goes, so does Burger King.  \\nThey even admitted the place \\"is a bit pricey\\" but the burgers are good.  \\nSo, apparently, if I want a \\"good\\" burger I have to go to \\"a bit pricey\\" place to get it.\\nI strongly disagree.\\nHopdoddy's is nothing more than the trendy, gastropub-wanna-be, \\"crafted\\" burger place that re-interprets the burger experience.  Please, save me the Food Network-babble.  \\nThere's no way a Classic Burger should cost anywhere close to $8 nor should it come with \\"Sassy Sauce\\", \\"Ripe Beef Steak Tomato\\" (what?) or \\"Classic Cheese Bacon Cheese\\"!  Sounds to me like a Big Mac with bacon and a fat slice of tomato.  \\nThere is no hand-ground Doddy \\"crafted\\" by human hands that's worth what this place will set you back price-wise.  This just sounds like a place where some folks can say they've been there or they've been seen there.  If that's the case, then some of them are just schmucks who need to get a life.\\nSave yourself a lot of time, grief, and especially money by walking across the street to Home Slice!\\nThat will be the best decision you will make at that moment.

Other than the dessert, the food was good at best, not excellent as I had expected.  The Cauliflower Soup tasted like a bowl of melted cheese; no taste of cauliflower whatsoever.  The Qualicum Bay Scallops were bland and even tasted a bit weird.  The Salmon Carpaccio, Coho Salmon and Confit Veal Breast were good though. I was in particular turned off by the quality of service.  We had several different servers bring food to our table, so service was inconsistent and sloppy.  They presented us with the wrong food on 2 occasions.   My mom was brought the wrong apetizer, and they realized right before setting the plate down.  No problem, they apologized and brought us the correct dish right away.  When the entree was up, they again brought the wrong entree for my mom.  When I pointed it out, the server actually said \\"What? It wasn't the veal that you ordered?\\"  No, it wasn't.  Did it look like I was joking around? It took them another 20 minutes before they served the correct entree to my mom.  By that time my dad and I had already finished our entree.  No sort of discount or whatever off the bill, just a few quick 'sorries' here and there from the servers.  One thing that I did appreciate about the experience was that ambience was great and the food was served promptly.  I really wish they would get the orders right though, there were only 2 choices for the apetizer and 3 for the entree.  How hard is that to manage?  They didn't mess up the orders for the dessert though, maybe because there was only 1 dessert option for Dine Out.  I stole some glances over at the table next to us and noticed the same sort of sloppy service and getting orders mixed up, so it wasn't just our table.  They should really be more organized if they're to charge that amount of money, because the food definitely was not enough to justify the price!

This developed into a sort of fight, in which the owner continued to swear profusely and offer him less money than he was hoping to get. To this day, I have no idea what in the world he was selling, but it seemed rather illicit. Since I was sitting in a cut-away area and was the only customer there, I think the owner thought the building was empty. This fight continued with the owner mocking the man who came in, and the man eventually leaving. Needless to say, I didn't return to Maria's for a while after that except by necessity.

So we're walking around in the cool air keeping warm sipping this mulled berry Kinderpunsch and it really is keeping me warm and fuzzy. On the second level of the wooden tree is an acoustic guitar player singing holiday music the likes of George Michael. I'm lit up like a xmas tree now.\\n     All the stalls were cute. They had things like German Candy, incense in miniature appliances like a stove.

When we got the bill the sandwich was $25. This was by far the most expensive lobster roll I saw at ANY restaurant in our travels through 7 New England states so I can only assume I was paying for the (fairly good) view. \\n\\nMy wife had a chicken sandwich which she said was okay but not spectacular.

It falls in line with restaurants of its type.  They were severely understaffed the day that Erica V. and I went to lunch and the server was honest about it so that was nice.  The place filled up pretty quickly after we arrived.\\n\\nSince I haven't been here before, I decided to order a bunch of different items.  Here is the rundown:\\n\\nCrispy Calamari ($7.00) served with sweet and slightly spicy sauce.  The good: The calamari had an interesting seasoning in the breading and I really enjoyed the Asian twist on this dish.  The bad: The calamari was under cooked and probably should have been fried for a couple more minutes.  Nobody likes chewy calamari.  The pieces were very small and I would have been happier with bigger pieces and less of them.  The sauce was an odd combination with calamari and the spices that were in the breading.  I would give this item 2.5 stars.\\n\\nPork Buns ($7.00) Chinese steamed buns served with pork, scallion, cucumber and Hoisin sauce.  The good:  The Chinese steamed buns were fresh and I liked the Hoisin sauce with the cucumbers.  The bad: Even though I ordered these at the same time as the calamari, I had to ask the server where they were twice and 20 minutes later (right before our entrees) they came.  The pork was really fatty to the point where I had to spit out a few pieces!  I would give this item 2 stars\\n\\nPhilly Roll ($6.00) smoked salmon, cream cheese and cucumber 8 pieces.  The good:  I always test a place that has sushi with this roll because let's face it; if you can't make this then all is lost.  This sushi roll was the perfect temperature, rolled masterfully and had a great fresh and pleasant flavor.  The bad:  We had to wait or our server to come by to actually eat it because we had to ask for side plates and small bowls for the soy sauce.  I would give this item 5 stars.\\n\\nXian Noodles ($9.00) served with savory ground pork sauce, cucumbers, edamame, carrots and bean sprouts.  The good:  The portion size was huge and the flavors were there.  The bad:  This is a mess item to eat and I guess that is why they off scissors to cut the one continuous noodle if necessary.  The sauce remains at the bottom and does not stick to the noodles well.  I realize you should always use chop sticks for Asian food but, with this item I really think you need a fork to be able to mix it properly for every bite."},{"name":"Bugatti's Beaverton/Cedar Hills","address":"2905 SW Cedar Hills Blvd","city":"Beaverton","stars":"3","text":"the vegetable lasagna was fabulous. the service was great, my waitress was I an attentive young lady named Alyssa"},{"name":"Burger King","address":"1 HARBORSIDE DR","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"Courteous staff.

The 1st waitress came to the table and was very sweet did not speak very much English no one there really did (that is not a problem for me).  She took the order and soon our food was arriving delivered by another waitress who my friends had HUGE cold sores on her mouth (active and contagious I work in the dental field so I know).  We (table of 4) were all taken back that she didn't call in sick or be sent home we all know that it is contagious.  We mustard up enough courage to say to each other it's ok she just delivered the food she didn't not cook it so let's eat.  But then we began observing everyone else along with her.  She kept touching her cold sores and then delivering glass of water, food and dirty plates.  Her co-workers were eating off a plate at the counter and then serving guest.  We watched as many of the waitresses touch their hair and again serve customers.  NEVER ONCE DID ANYONE WASH THEIR HANDS! OMG!!  Then the kicker happened...the cook came out of the kitchen and had on vinyl gloves that look like they were from last weeks shift, his entire uniform was covered with grease and food.  He began vigorously scratching his arm (with vinyl gloves on)  then proceeded back into the kitchen, mortified yet?  The restaurant was a complete nasty mess just look up at the ceiling fan.  I asked one the waitress if any of them had to take a food server class she had no idea what I was taking about.  I told her how we were all disgusted by what we saw, she went and told the girl about her cold sore and as we were walking out she touched her mouth and blew a kiss to us.

There were only about 5 small mushrooms which left me wanting more. There was a lettuce leaf under the patty to act as a grease dam but, it failed at its purpose. The bun was drenched in grease and soggy by the half way mark.

This means sometimes there aren't any tables, and you have to stand awkwardly in line without ordering until one becomes available. The up-shot of this is that they aren't well suited to large groups, and service can be a little confused at busy times. However, for a two-person date night?

But, to put this in context: Barley Swine is my favorite restaurant.  Last week I went drove straight from Austin-Bergstrom to it.  As in, I left work early on a Friday afternoon, went to O'Hare, and took a 2.5 hour flight from Chicago to Austin IN ORDER TO EAT AT MY FAVORITE RESTAURANT (it was our 2-year anniversary also).  Also I have cried not once but twice at Barley Swine because it causes such an emotional reaction (once was the honey bun, another time someone was really nice to me).\\n\\nSo, tips for visiting Barley Swine:\\n\\n1) If you need to get someone from the airport at a busy time (say, 8 p.m. on a Friday), drop in, put in your name and number, go get them from the airport.  By the time you get back your name will be called and it's perfect.  Alternately, go to Henri's.\\n\\n2) Ask for the mini-spatulas.  They know what you're talking about.\\n\\n3) Ask for suggestions on what beers to pair with your chosen foods.  Every person on the staff is very, very good at this.\\n\\n4) Be sure to check the specials board.  I haven't been disappointed.\\n\\n5) Order 3-4 dishes a person.  The menu recommends 4 but I feel that the portion sizes have grown slightly.  I'd even order 3 a pop to save room for the dessert.  In fact,\\n\\n5b) Save room for dessert.\\n\\n6) If there are eggs on the menu, get them.  Consistently great- you never thought scrambled eggs could be like this.\\n\\n7) I can't believe I'm saying this, but understand these facts about the restaurant: a) It is not cheap.  b) It has communal seating on wooden stools.  c) It is not, in fact, BYOB.  If you understand these three BEFORE going I think you will be much happier, haters (or just don't show up).   \\n\\nLove this place!

The front room is pretty small and intimate; it opens into a gigantic, covered outside area, and from there, you can reach more dining rooms, such as the one that accommodated our sizable group. The decor is rich, but not over the top. My favorite bit- the bathrooms have those column fans, so you get a nice breeze while doing your business. Just like an oasis.\\n\\nNext up- the food. For vegetarians, options are more or less limited to the usual fare of appetizer stuff (hummus, tabbouleh, dolmas, etc.), salads, a grilled veggie plate, and dessert. Still, there is more than enough yum to go around here, and I could easily have filled up on warm pita bread. And by 'could have' I mean 'did'. Our carnivorous company was happily sated with their lamb shanks and chicken dishes.\\n\\nWhile some fellow yelpers appear to be disenchanted with the service at Phara's, we had a great server. She was swamped with large parties, but checked in on us often and made everyone feel at home. They were very nice too, about our splitting the check about six hundred ways. The belly dancer for the evening (not Phara herself, who I hear is phenomenal) wowed everyone and got about half our table up and dancing at one point or another.\\n\\nPhara's rocks the Casbah, and I'd even go so far to say the sherif WOULD like it."},{"name":"Gusto Italian Kitchen & Wine Bar","address":"4800 Burnet Rd","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"The wine was good (and only $6 a glass), the food was good, the service was good.

The meat is fried when ordered and thus arrival time depends on how busy the restaurant is.\\n\\nI've had multiple portions of all pieces, and they're oozing with flavor. The breast is surprisingly juicy as well! The skin is thin and crispy with cajun flavoring, not padded with fried batter like typical fried chicken. The wings are heavily underrated. They are extremely large pieces with mixed dark and white meat (some breast meat is attached on the ends). If you're uncertain, get a piece a la carte and thank me later.\\n\\nHowever the sides are an afterthought, and after talking with the owner he's well aware of this.

I also had a lavender mocha which was unlike any coffee I've ever had before.

Both me and my boyfriend were blown away!\\n\\nMy only gripe is with one of the workers I encountered at this particular location.  He was completely unfriendly and at times seemed annoyed, giving my boyfriend and I a little bit of an attitude while we were trying to decide on our order.  He even snapped at his female coworker.

I particularly liked the lamb, but they were well cooked and a great start to the meal.\\n\\nI hadn't done much research ahead of time so didn't realize my toppings would be under my cheese. That was unexpected, but it works! The sausage and garlic pie was unreal, and the veggie was also pretty good.  In general, I think veggies work out better when they're on top so they can get a little crispy though, so the sausage was my favorite.\\n\\nCash only! ATM in the back.

And I lived to tell the tale.  \\n\\nInna found Bridges online and it was between our two homes so we met up there just after noon.  I got there first and put my name on the pad of paper by the door and waited no more than ten minutes before we were seated.  \\n\\nAfter we were brought coffee and water, I let the waitress know that we \\"needed\\" Bloody Marys and was given a lecture about how (per the OLCC) she wasn't allowed to serve booze if the customer \\"needed\\" it.  Inna pointed out that we didn't \\"need booze\\", we \\"needed Bloody Marys\\".  The waitress still wouldn't budge.  I then said that we \\"adored\\" Bloody Marys.  Nothing.  Inna tried \\"required\\" Bloody Marys and the waitress still wouldn't leave our table.  I finally got her moving when I tried a new tactic and said \\"can we just have two Bloody Marys, please?\\".  I did worry that she was going to give me a lecture on can v may but luckily she didn't travel down that road.  \\n\\nAfter all of that work, what was delivered were two very bland glasses of tomato juice, ice, and perhaps a shot of vodka.  Seriously, the drinks came in a pint glass and after Inna scooped out more than half of her ice, only half of the glass was full.  Plus, the only garnish was an over brined string bean. Bad form, Bridges.  After doctoring up the drink with Aardvark and Cholula, my Bloody Mary was...tolerable.  This made me wary of the food that was headed our way.\\n\\nNo cause for worry because what we got was delicious.  I had the cheddar grits plate which came with roasted vegetables (spinach, mushrooms, onions and peppers) and two poached eggs on top and I added a side of vegetarian sausage.  It was cheesy and salty and delicious.  Inna had the Sunset Benedict which consisted of spinach, tomatoes and avocado on top of an English muffin with poached eggs all topped with chipotle hollandaise sauce and a side of roasted potatoes.  She was a little taken aback by the spicy hollandaise sauce but got the regular kind on the side to mellow it out.  She was very happy with her order and we both rate the food very high.\\n\\nWhat struck us most at the Bridges cafe was that it was a very coupley breakfast place but all of the couples were odd which added to the awkward experience of the restaurant.  Every couple sat on the same side of the booth and none of them talked to each other.  That means that 90% of the patrons were facing us at our back table which laid perpendicular to the rest of the tables and raised on a platform chatting about the most inappropriate topics of conversation.  It was a little hard to eat knowing that all eyes were on us.  Granted, we are fun and funny but we weren't there to entertain the troops, we were there to eat and get our drunk on and only half of those things happened.\\n\\nI would have loved to give this place 4 stars but the lecture on alcohol serving along with the disappointment of the cocktail dropped it down.  The food, however, was worth another try.  I'll be back some day."},{"name":"The Crepevine","address":"249 W State Rd 436","city":"Altamonte Springs","stars":"4.5","text":"The Nutella crepe is excellent. Storefront place. Large parking lot.

Also, during the course of my dinner, the servers must have replaced my plate about five times(we were eating curried fried crab).  Can't complain about the service...\\n \\nHowever, there are two things preventing me from giving Neptune 5 stars: \\n1) The cleanliness of the washrooms are only so-so(my husband said they were smelly), so make sure you go before coming to the restaurant.\\n2) Food presentation is inconsistent(and a bit tacky at times).  An adjacent table ordered a geoduck (giant clam) dish,  with geoduck slices served on a bed of ice and garnished with the empty clamshell. Underneath the ice, however, were blue and red blinking (Christmas) lights.\\n\\nHere's a brief description of our dinner:\\n\\nFried pigeon(squab): quite delicious! Skin was crispy, meat was tender and moist.\\n\\nSharkfin and fish soup:  good, but I've had a more flavorful soup broth base in   Calgary.\\n\\nPeking duck(cooked two ways): the first traditional dish with the steamed pancakes, hoisin sauce, cucumber and green onion curls was ordinary(in taste; a server skinned the roast duck at tableside) but the second dish with the mixed rice noodle and transparent vermicelli with shredded duckmeat was amazing!  The flavor of the duck and the textures of the two different noodles is a match made in heaven.\\n\\nWok fried curried crab: this was the best Dungeness crab I've had in a long time.  It was exceptional fresh and flavorful.  Kind of makes you want to lick your plate...\\n\\nEggplant with dried shrimp: not my most favorite dish.  It looked like the eggplant was steamed to preserve its natural purple skin color, but I think the flavor would be more intense if they grilled or fried it...  or put it in a stew/curry like Indian or Nepalese dishes.\\n\\nSteamed tilapia: sorry, I am not usually a fan of tilapia(it has a muddy taste).  The restaurant also served us black tilapia, which is the cheapest kind of tilapia on the market).   I prefer seabass, rock cod, pickerel or sablefish...\\n\\nFried pork belly: yum, yum, good!  This dish blew me out of the water in terms of flavor(succulent, meaty pork) and texture(the perfect amount of crunch).\\n\\nDessert:  pretty typical Chinese fare which included red bean soup, almond cookies and sesame balls with red bean paste(the latter was actually very good--chewy sesame encrusted \\"cookie\\" with a mild, sweet red bean filling)."},{"name":"Lake House Bar & Grill","address":"315 N Highland St","city":"Mount Dora","stars":"3","text":"I've been frequenting this spot for the last 2 years and have always had a good experience.

There are stray cats everywhere, which might really annoy some people, but I love cats so I ended up trying to coax them over for some scritches with zero luck. For most of the night we were the only table out there, and our server, an older African-American man(wish I could remember his name), was very knowledgeable, attentive, and polite. We had the appetizer sampler that was delicious, especially the hummus. We all ordered the lamb shank on our friend's recommendation. It was rather expensive but seemed fresh and VERY, very tasty. You get a choice of three sauces so we all tried different ones, and the mint sauce was definitely the best. They could give you more of the sauce, actually, because it comes in a tiny plastic container that just can no way stand up to the giant delicious slab of lamb it comes out with. We also had the pistachio/almond paste dessert thing and it was like nothing I'd ever had before but I actually really enjoyed it. We paired with some Turkish coffee and a Rose hookah and it was a cozy ending to the evening. I will say that I prefer cardamon in my coffee like how another friend's Palestinian mother made for us long ago, but it was very good.\\n\\nThere was also belly-dancing by the owner Phara herself, which was pleasant to watch, but the music was a bit loud. It was only us and another table so she invited diners up to dance with her, and a couple people from the other table took her up on it. The guy was hilarious and the woman actually had some moves! A woman with her baby came out from the inside to watch for a bit and the kid really seemed to eat it up and that was adorable.\\n\\nWe won't come back often because of the price, but definitely a nice place to take someone on a date."},{"name":"Medina Cafe","address":"780 Richards Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4","text":"Wow...

Not too many places serve himalayan food, so I jumped at the opportunity to come here when I saw their deal on Groupon. The best way for me to describe himalayan food is to mix traditional chinese and indian food together - the outcome is most delicious!\\n\\nI came to Gurkha during the afternoon. They are only open for lunch for 2 hours (12-2) during the day so plan wisely if you plan on coming here. Inside it is pleasantly decorated, but a bit dark. My server was a friendly woman who was very knowledgeable with regards to the menu and answered all my questions perfectly. I ordered chicken momos (dumpling...must try), kathmandu sekuwa (meat skewers), phuraula (lentil patties), gorkhali khasi (goat), gurkha pulau (rice), and a tingmo (steamed bread). All the orders were absolutely delicious. The chef did an amazing job with the spices; the meat was tender, especially the goat; the rice was full of colour and flavour; the bread was so fluffy and chewy; and the dumpling were simply fun to eat. On the other hand, the lentil patties tasted a bit dull - they reminded me of bagels, but more dense with less flavour. The momos too were a bit (Just a bit) of a disappointment - Yes, they were delicious and the wrapping was the most beautiful wrapping that I have ever seen on a dumpling, but the dipping sauces were lacking flavour. The same dipping sauces were used for the Sekuwas and the Phuraulas as well; however, the Sekuwas were so wonderfully marinated and spiced I did not need the sauces to enjoy the dish :).\\n\\nI finished the meal with a traditional dessert - Kheer. It was a sweet rice and milk dish with hints of cardamom. I LOVED this dessert. I am typically not a dessert person because I do not like overly sweet things; but this dish was sweetened perfectly to my tongue. It had chunks of raisins in it too that made it chewy and fun to eat :)!\\n\\nOverall I give Gurkha a 4/5. I would definitely come here again and bring a friend.

The special that day was Salmon burger and we were debating between that and Greek and at the recommendation of the girl at the counter , Greek one. We ordered two Thunderbirds, one Continental and one Greek and Fries with green chillie queso. At our table, a server introduced herself and asked us to tell her if we needed anything. The wait for the food was not too long. Every savory morsel was worth it. The buns were soft, the meat was moist and the seasoning was just right. The queso was a bit runny and could have used an extra kick. We asked for pickles , mayo and ketchup and it was produced at our table in a jiffy. The server also brought a little cup of chipotle ketchup which is delicious. The place was buzzing, mostly couples, students and a few families. I  hope they expand a little more and add more room .The meat is local and so is some other produce. They handcut the fries and make their blend of mustard and other condiments.

The shredded brisket, slaw, and smoked mayo all flowed so well together it was hard to put the burger down and come up for air! The buns?  Lightly grilled and fresh! The double stack was the same. They were both very tender and juicy, so-much-so, that the juices were running down our hands. \\n\\nWe also had to try the fries and we're not disappointed at all. They were delicious. They were served with a side of ketchup and again, smoked mayo. The flavor of the smoked mayo made the fries sing for me.  \\n\\nSide note. They have ice cold PBR 16oz cans, and when poured into a frozen glass...man that's good on a hot summer day in the ATL. \\n\\nOur service was very good too. Alejandro waited on us.

The amount of food served is ample for any couple and I've found whenever I add on a favorite not included in the \\"date\\" that there is far too much food on the table. \\n\\nFavorites: go for Mama Chang's Pork Dumplings with special dumpling sauce (if M+C bottled this sauce, there would surely be some on-hand in my house every day of the week), Asian-braised short rib soft tacos and braised pork belley buns. I won't spoil the secret to the \\"Ancient Chinese Secret Chocolate Mousse,\\" but it's worth learning! \\n\\nAn ideal date spot, the staff will do everything they can to make your experience unique and pleasurable. They are very communicative with all of their guests, so if you have a special request, don't be shy, just ask. Their GM recently responded to a personal e-mail I sent requesting a six-top at a desirable time when Open Table wouldn't allow me to make a reservation! \\n\\nTheir attention to detail when it comes to the safety of their special allergy guests in on par with The Four Seasons. Although a person would think all dining establishments would be quite attuned to this sort of thing, I can tell you they are not. M+C has gone as far to prepare a special \\"Nut & Gluten Free\\" section of their menu. Everything is made to order, so if you need something special, again, just communicate it to your server. \\n\\nOther stand-out Myers + Chang tidbits: \\n\\nTheir chef is left-handed and is happy to give tips on where to buy professional grade cooking knives for lefties. \\n\\nM+ C hosts cooking demonstrations on select Saturday mornings. Classes fill up quickly, so book as soon as you know you want to attend! It's super fun, date friendly and gives you the mad skillz to show off at your next dinner party. If you stick around after the dim sum lunch, Chef will take you on a walking tour of the Chinese market. \\n\\nSunday night boasts $1 Island Creek Oysters and $1 PBR's. (Yes, you read that correctly.)

Honestly,  if there were better options open in the early AM hours, I'd be there - WingNuts is typically our late night last resort. \\n\\nThat being said, I do enjoy the wings, they're well flavored and not at all overcooked or a soggy mess. My one qualm is that the wings orders aren't consistent in size, some are \\"normal\\" and some are very small. However, the staff is friendly and they have no problems splitting/alternating orders or taking split payments (it is after all a college joint). They do charge for all dipping sauces (ie., blue cheese, ranch) - $0.25 each, but they're a fairly decent size: if you're ordering less than the 10 wing combo, you're good with one - more than 10, I'd go with two. \\n\\nEven if you're dining in, I recommend calling in the order - we called in our order for pick-up and it was said to be ready in 10 minutes.

Often we will just go to the bar and order takeout and a beer, but this time we decided to get a table. \\n\\nWe did a long weekend trip so I didn't bother making advanced reservation...we figured we'd play it by ear. We arrived at 11:30 am and there was already a long line. I went in and got a beer and frozen lemonade while my daughter stayed in the line. We put our name on the list and were told it would be 35-45 minutes, just enough to finish our drinks. We went to the bar and were lucky to find two seats. \\n\\nThere were two bartenders on duty and they were slammed, but they kept up nicely with demand. We decided to have some appetizers while we waited but didn't want to eat our full meal here because it was chaotic. We settled on lettuce cups with chicken and vegetables and potstickers. The lettuce cups were a nice size and definitely shareable. I didn't care for the sauce that came with it...it was too sweet. I requested sriracha and soy sauce and whipped up my own combination. Much better. My daughter loved the potstickers. I had a bite and thought they were good. \\n\\nAfter we finished our appetizers, I went ahead and settled up, figuring they would be calling us any minute. Sure enough, the host came to retrieve us. \\n\\nWe were seated upstairs at a two-top table. Our server was Ryan, who had a few tables in addition to us. We knew we wanted chicken Lo Mein and I ordered chicken tikka masala. I also ordered a sparkling sake, which reminded me of a dry cider...very refreshing on a 90-degree day. The food took a while to come to the table, which wasn't surprising because they were packed. Our meals were good and the tikka Masala had the slightest bit of spice. \\n\\nYak and Yeti is owned by the Landry group, which I think is interesting. I wonder why Disney doesn't just run all the restaurants instead of outsourcing. Anyway, this place is good for theme park food. We like the counter service for chicken fried rice.

They simply never, ever, let you down.  The staff has changed, of course, over the years, but the style of service has remained.  They are, at the core, genuine.  They're friendly and efficient, and there's nothing fake about it.  They take great care of you and they make you feel comfortable in a very natural, unforced way.  99% of the time, we sit at the bar, and the service is always excellent.  The food, over the years, has been remarkably consistent.  Great bang for the buck here.  The Zuni Roll never fails, reggae wings are always great, the Nicoise salad is delicious and healthy, and Sean's Simple Chicken always gets it done.  Great beers on tap, too.  This is my go-to place, where I always feel welcome.  There's just something very real about the Parish, when so many other places feel fake.  Sit at the bar and relax.

I saw lots of young toddlers happily riding the horses, smiling and laughing. \\n\\nThere are lots of vendors of soaps and socks and sweaters and jewelry and a whole slew of Bavarian-esque Christmas tchatchkies (ornaments, nutcrackers, old-time stars and mini-music boxes, etc). Everything is cute but very pricey. \\n\\nIn my opinion, the best part of the whole market experience was the booth selling photos with Santa. I had my two teenage kids with me who are NOT happy about continuing our family tradition of taking yearly photos with The Big Guy. But I insisted, and the Santa in this booth was so jolly and convincing, and I loved how \\"Old World\\"-like he appeared (unlike all the Santas in our past yearly photos, this one here looks like he hails from \\"the olde country\\", i.e., Eastern Europe, circa 1700-1800). If you saw him, you'd understand. Suffice it to say, he was GREAT! And the kids concurred, and they agreed to take photos with him, and they turned out great! (And they cost the same as we've paid for photos in past years, so pricing is comparable). \\n\\nSo for me, the experience was worth it, all because of the Santa photos with the kids, but for others, I'm not sure if I would recommend it."},{"name":"FLIP burger boutique","address":"1587 Howell Mill Rd","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Got there about an hour before closing on Sat night.

There are a whole bunch of tables throughout two rooms; mostly pool, but there's foosball for the more spinningly-inclined. It can get crowded later on, but there's good reason to post up early: being that Big City is sort of the upstairs younger sibling to Sunset, they share quite a few tap lines, so there's plenty of good brews to be had, often in 23-ounce on-special pours. Also, beer flights, table toppers, cocktails, and beer cocktails, some of which are far better than others (an unfortunate note: the Beery Mary is sort of like if a pint of Budweiser and a shrimp cocktail platter had a weird cloudy baby), but the bottom line is, there's something for everybody. Even wine. But seriously, the beer list is pretty decent, don't get wine, you lamer.\\n\\nThe only strange thing is that I can't really figure out what the deal is with the front pool room. Half the time it's reserved for private functions, so I guess that's cool if you're looking to book a party, but the other half of the time, it's still got this sort of weird \\"I might get asked to move if I sit down here because they've probably got some secret pool tournament or beer lover's club meeting or Masonic ritual or something going on\\" vibe.

For the Curry Orzo, I loved the different textures mixed in with a cool creamy avocado, baked egg, tangy acid from the tomato salad and balanced with the peppery watercress.  It was super filling and I could only eat half of it.  As for the Fricasse, this was much heartier and had a huge portion of short ribs underneath, like a meat surprise. I can't describe this one as much since I was really into the Curry Orzo, but it looked good.  However, it is def really heavy and the meat was a bit on the overbraised side, so a little dry and stringy.\\n\\nI really enjoyed the waffle, we got the white choco pistachio rose water dipping sauce and I spooned every last bit of it.

We ordered the tofu corn cakes to start, I ordered the pad thai with tofu and my husband ordered the pad thai with the vegetarian shrimp.  So we're waiting for our food, and then we hear a circular saw going in the room next to the dining room we're sitting in.

I could have handled the renovating noises, if it wasn't for the 5 loud ass girls sitting next to us who were practically screaming at each other.  I realize that wasn't the restaurant's fault, but it just made the experience that much more unpleasant.  Ok back to the food.  About 10 minutes after we order, our server comes out to tell us she just found out they are out of the tofu cakes.  Awesome.  So we order a sushi roll with tofu, avocado and rice instead.  It was good for a basic sushi roll.  Then the pad thai came out.  Let me just say that I am normally not a picky eater and I almost like anything I eat, but this tasted awful!  It's like they had dumped in 3 times as much seasoning as needed....there was so much, I could literally taste the granules of whatever it was they used.

The interior as other more experienced creatives have indicated, is first-rate and very cool. Maybe one too many big screen TVs at the bar (personally I hate TVs everywhere...). Certainly a step above the old Kerbey Lane that was here for many years. It's dark and woodsy and has a flair that 'fits' S. Austin perfectly. \\n\\nSo, I showed up with fellow Yelper, Mr. Brasil, on a December weekday night. It was crowded. I was surprised that the bar is larger than the dining area given the length of the menu. There are plenty of hi-top tables to sit at. Perhaps my butt is too boney but I found the stools a bit uncomfortable. But I guess after a few drinks, who cares. \\n\\nWe were approached after a few minutes of sitting at a hi-top by a friendly server. We ordered a 'jug' of Pinot Noir but was later told they were out of Pinot (one of four wines on the menu). So we had a couple of glasses of Merlot. Mr. Brasil ordered TWO bacon and maple donuts for dinner (yeah...I know. Sugar rush). I had the Frito Pie. The donut was awesome - lots of quality bacon strips on top of a fresh huge donut with maple glaze. Delish. The Frito pie....was..horrible. The first one I ordered was covered with a thick mass of what looked like white Velveeta. There was not too much chile underneath the 'cheese.' I ordered a second Frito Pie with the cheese on the side. Much better but the chili was kind of stringy and weird. The Fritos were good, though. \\n\\nOh, and we got charged for the $35 jug of wine (which was taken off the bill once we noticed it). Gourdough's could be one of my 'go-to' places since it is in my 'hood.

So if you are a fan of the original then you'll be happy with their new spot. All the bar staff we talked to were very friendly and helpful navigating the menu. All the menu items are very reasonable too, just about everything runs around $10. You probably need 2 or 3 items per person to leave content.\\n\\nSangria - I tried both the red and white variety. Both were on point. They even had a different variety of their white that was infused with lavender and rosemary that was really good.\\n\\nSquid Ink Fideo - The best dish of the evening. Fresh calamari in squid in fideo, which is essentially a type of rice. They top is with a dollop of garlic aioli that you mix in. This is just too good. I could've ordered too. For a rice based dish it is a pretty reasonable size. One order would serve a max 3 people a big spoonful.\\n\\nBeef Tongue - Tender beef in Spanish spices and a habanero sauce that is a little spicy. If you can get over that it is beef tongue then you are in for some very savory beef.\\n\\nGarlic Shrimp - Not enough broth at the bottom of the dish and even though it came out on a sizzling plate we thought they could've come out warmer. On other visits this has been one of my favorite dishes\\n\\nChorizo with sweet & sour figs - A must get item at their Brookline location and no exception here. I did find them to be on the dry side on my visit.\\n\\nRazor Sliced Clams - Not a big fan of this one. It wasn't bad.

The first few times I went I wasn't too impressed because everyone hypes it up soooo much, and I thought it was too expensive for a couple of burgers. But after awhile it definitely grew on me and theres no where else I would go in town for a burger. I've tried The Goodnight, Llano Poblano, Buffalo Bill, and the Terlingua. The Terlingua was my least favorite of them all. The burgers are wonderful, the fries, and chipotle ketchup are amazing. And you can't leave without getting a milkshake. The caramel and sea salt or the nutella pretzel milkshake are to die for. Theres usually a long line around lunch and dinner and definitely on the weekends, but it moves pretty fast. Youre going to have to wait about 30-45 minutes but it'll be like that anywhere in town at the peak hours and on weekends. We always sore we would never wait in the line, but sometimes you just want Hopdoddy bad enough that you'll wait. It gets a little noisy when its packed also. And the service is always wonderful.

Though there was one time that I arrived 5 minutes after 3pm with a friend, and we asked if we could still get the lunch specials (they end at 3pm) and we were told no, which I thought was totally lame.\\n\\nI ordered delivery from here once, and it was a pretty disastrous experience because the guy who was taking my order asked if he could put me on \\"hold\\", but all he did was put the phone in his pocket, so I listened to his pants rustling around for several minutes before the line went dead.

I've actually been here twice.\\n\\nThe first time was a little shifty for me, though...I'm not gonna lie. So if I had to rate my first visit, it would be a 2 in my eyes. The second visit, I would rate a 4 since I knew what to do this time around, which would average to two stars, but it's better than a 2.. I'm getting ahead of myself, so let's do this the right way.\\n\\nI heard so many great things about them and then this one girl posted a picture on Instagram and I was like, \\"I have to get a burger!\\" so I dragged my friend out with me since I was in this whole \\"let me experience something new\\" phase and this was as new as I was willing to do.  Anyways, lunch was on me this time and so she splurged on my dime and ordered the sampler. I ordered the turkey burger and that was probably my first mistake. All I could hear her saying to me in between bites of her mini-burgers was \\"who goes to a burger place and gets a turkey burger!?\\" \\n\\nI do. Maybe that makes me a fool? If you ordered the turkey burger there, you're a fool too. Come sit in my booth.\\n\\nBut the turkey burger was small. Smaller than I thought it was going to be. I understand boutique, but clearly. It was just okay. Nothing fancy. I got the sweet potato tots and they were...just okay too. The sauce though, I'm a sucker for sauces, and I really liked the sauce that came with the tots. It was a mixture of blue cheese and something else. What really saved this for me was the krispy kreme milkshake I ordered, that me and my friend kind of fought over (a super fat moment between us and we were ashamed). My friend, who ordered the sampler, was in love. IN LOVE. She ranted and raved about it and even ordered a sampler to go (she paid for that one though) to give to her wife. Her wife loved it too. Everyone was in love except for me. I had to get taco bell afterwards because I was so unsatisfied...and hungry.\\n\\nThe second time, I was smart and I got the farmers burger. It was amazing..and bigger than the turkey burger. I also got the onion rings and I normally don't go for onion rings...but their onion rings are awesome....the sauce that comes with it was awesome too (have I mentioned that I love sauces?). I took my same friend this time again, she actually suggested it because I was okay with staying away from this place after my first trip. She got the farmers burger too, that was her favorite one out of the sampler because of the apple house chutney and she got their brussels sprouts, which she liked. I tried brussels sprouts for the first time in my life here and I really liked them. I kept taking one whenever she had her guard down.\\n\\nOverall, it's not a bad place. I would go here again if my friend wanted to. I wouldn't suggest it. A little overpriced in my opinion, but it has a really fancy interior which makes you think you should be paying that much, so I guess it's alright."},{"name":"Boiling Point","address":"15146 100th Avenue, Suite 102","city":"Surrey","stars":"3.5","text":"Food is excellent, seating is quick, prices are fair.

I love the hot, numbing sensation from the Szechuan pepper corns on the shrimp. I could have eaten a dozen of them and not thought twice. When it came to the Octopus + Corn, I was absolutely blown away. The octopus was perfectly tender and covered in a heavenly spicy sauce of sorts (which I kept dipping the corn in). While corn on the cob may not be the best option when trying to impress someone on a date, you will both forget about the corn stuck in each others teeth while you talk about how delicious the dish was. \\n\\nIf you like a good cocktail, I suggest getting the Bloodlust.

Not too many places in Atlanta that fall under both categories.\\n\\nBabette's Cafe is set in a house on North Highland Ave just a block south of North Ave. You'd think there are more places in Atlanta - restaurants, specifically - set in old houses. Atmosphere is the only other comparable place I can think really think of. Part of Babette's charm is because of the setting. There's an intimacy and comfort in being a house. As you make your way to the table, it feels more and more like you're a special guest at someone's home, where they busted out the good dishes and utensils. If you let your mind wander, it's not too hard to feel like you're escaping Atlanta.  \\n\\nDon't forget, there's seating on the patio. \\n\\nThe restaurant's roots are both French and Southern. Each dish was elegant, but at its core was satisfying like comfort food. Decadent soul food would be how to describe it. The French onion soup was excellent. Lobster and spinach crepes with truffle butter sauce and artichoke and olive ravioli in a wine butter sauce were simply amazing. My personal favorite had to be the mound of roast half duck with apple rutabaga compote with apple cider reduction sauce, served over farro and mirin. This had my taste buds seizing with joy. Desserts included the creme brulee and cheese tart with strawberries, both were very good, though we preferred the former. Our waitress did well pacing the dinner. Involved enough, but not overtly intrusive. It was perfect actually. \\n\\nBabette's Cafe offers a nice change of pace and space, providing high quality food in a setting different from all those chic modern Southern restaurants taking over lofts or warehouses these days. Sometimes I like something a little more at home, a little more familiar."},{"name":"Schmidt's Sausage Haus","address":"240 E Kossuth St","city":"Columbus","stars":"4","text":"I've tried, I've really really really tried. I wanted to keep a positive mind-set but after visit number 4, I simply can not let this go any longer. I must speak up. Is anyone running this place actually TASTING the food they're rolling out into the food trough for all the Man vs. Foodies to scarf up?\\n\\nTHIS IS NOT GOOD FOOD. It is not 5 star, or 4 or even 3, and the only reason I gave it a 2 is because I understand the space it's trying to fill and respect tradition. This is a tourist destination, plain and simple. Did you ever eat good food at Disney World - Epcot excluded?!?\\n\\nFirst off, mac n cheese isn't German, why is it on the menu? Just a minor pet peeve of mine that a restaurant that claims to be authentically German has mac and cheese on the menu. Secondly, sausages of any type whether German, Italian, Spanish, Mexican, French, etc sausages, have flavor. I've tried all of the Schmidt's sausages and they all taste like boiled pork with some pepper on them. Also, where's the \\"snap\\" that comes from well made natural casing sausage? These are akin to a NYC dirty water dog, no snap from obviously being held in a steamer for God only knows how long. \\n\\nAnd for the record, I'm not talking about the Autobahn (buffet) sausages - I'm talking about ones from the kitchen. Could you at least give me a 30 second kiss on the grill to add something/anything flavor or texture wise? And yes, I get it - not traditionally German to add grill markings/flavor but what about plain old good tasting food? Who could ever deny that fire makes things taste better? Pretty sure all sense of tradition was thrown out the window with the additon of mac n cheese. \\n\\nMy first visit was a busy Thursday night, so I tried to ignore the insolent service and even looked past the 45 minute (and 2 pints later) wait for the food to come out. \\n\\nOk I get it, it's slammed, the line out the door is wrapping around the building and down the block, you're in the weeds but let's face, it's not like we're cooking anything to order! I ordered the shnitzel and I swear it was at least twice fried if not more. Leather. I took one bite and simply left it alone. Didn't even pack it up to bring home to the Dog, it was that bad. \\n\\nSo - that was visit #1 the food was so horrible that my entire meal was left sitting on the table. Literally - everything I ordered. Waitress never cleared a plate and never even asked if everything was \\"ok\\" because it was blatantly obvious that it wasn't and she sure didn't want to have that conversation. \\n\\nTotal bill = $73 + 15% tip for my son and myself. Thankfully he's not a picky eater so he at least enjoyed the sausage platter but left both sides untouched because they were awful. Add to that the $20 t-shirt he suckered me into buying him put me at $100+ for the night and I ate yogurt for dinner when I got home. \\n\\nSo let's talk about those aforementioned sides for a moment. How about we start with potato pancakes, for those of you who have a German/Eastern European and/or Jewish family heritage or who has ever had a friend from said clans - will know what I'm talking about. These are not potato pancakes. The best I can describe them is on par with a McDonald's hashbrown. My first visit they were obviously thrown into the deep fryer, again I get it, busy busy busy - just get the food out.\\n\\nSubsequent visits have revealed a true pan saute but still lacking any discernable flavor or welcoming texture. Unless of course, you're actually expecting a McDonald's hash brown - if that's you're idea of a potato pancake, you'll love these.\\n\\nAs for the saurkraut, I make boiled cabbage that has more tang and bite to it than this does. German Potato Salad reminded me of Reese's canned variety - no flavor profiles what so ever. Green Beans w/ Spaetzle was another monolithic fail - multiple times. Even the applesauce was tasteless and bland. Please explain to me how you F-up applesauce?!?!? And least \\"try\\" with a sprinkle of cinammon on top?!? Same for the red cabbage. Meh....\\n\\nI don't typically eat dessert, so I have not tried the (in)famous creme puff but I seem to notice a lot of 5 star reviews because of the creme puff alone. Maybe they should just give up on trying to serve food and open a bakery?\\n\\nAs for the ambience - well, I think I said it best when I asked if you ever had good food at Disney World.\\n\\nGerman food CAN be delicous and tasty, when lovingly prepared and when the right (ie. non-industrial food can) ingredients are used. From now on, every time I hear the words \\"I hate German food\\" my response will be \\"Oh, and where besides Schmidt's have you eaten German food\\"?\\n\\nFor the record, my subsequent 2nd, 3rd and 4th visits were all at client requests. I pray they recognized the same things I did and don't EVER make me go back again. If so, well at least it's on the expense report and not on my dime."},{"name":"Desta Ethiopian Kitchen","address":"3086 Briarcliff Rd NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4.5","text":"It's the only Ethiopian food I've ever had, but it's really good!

Everyone loved it -- the spinach and artichoke dip was creamy and full of cheesy goodness.\\n\\nWe each ordered one dish for ourselves as well so I got the Cajun Seafood Fettucini. It was topped with lots of mussels, prawns, and salmon and served with a piece of bread. The fettucini was nicely done and al dente and the seafood was quite fresh. I liked the flavour of the dish -- there was a spicy kick to it but I wish there was more sauce. The pasta was a bit dry for me. This was $22 already.. a pretty pricy dish but at least it was filling.\\n\\nMilestones is not a place I would go to regularly but it's good for special occasions or even just having some drinks at the bar.\\n\\nFood - 8/10\\nService - 8/10\\nAmbience - 8.5/10\\nValue - 6.5/10"},{"name":"Boston Market","address":"1010 Morrissey Boulevard","city":"Dorchester","stars":"2","text":"Always thee worst service at this location.

My friend wanted Boston Market so we go.  She just had surgery so we went to the drive thru. There were 3 cars ahead of us. Waiting, waiting and more waiting.  First car drives around. Same thing with the second and third then us. We get to the speaker. Wait about 6 mins.  The recording tells us the specials so i don't think anything is wrong. I finally ask \\"Hello?\\".  I ask again.  Then nothing.  I drive around to the window.  There are only 2 employees in view.  They never acknowledged us.  So i park and decide to head inside.  I see other patrons being served food so i figure either the drive they is broken or closed.  I try all doors.  All of them locked and still no acknowledgment from the employees inside.  All I'm saying is a simple sign. \\"Closing due to storm\\" would've saved a lot of aggravation. It was only 4:45pm.  Just a little acknowledgment would've kept me from writing this review.

I ended up getting their mac-n-cheese and mexican rice along with a slice of bread to mop up the remnants of my meal.  Afterwards, I walked up to a register where a cashier and a meat slicer were waiting for me to place my order.  I wound up going for the Brisket Sandwich.  The sandwich was plenty big and had pickles, onions, and a little of their original sauce on it.  The brisket was thick cut and incredibly tender with tons of flavor and was nice and hefty.  The mac-n-cheese and mexican rice were pretty good, but the main star of this show was the brisket, obviously!  Afterwards, I tried the sweet, spicy, and original sauce and liked their original the best.  I also managed to try some of their turkey... now that was excellent too!\\n\\nI totally see why this place is rated as one of the best BBQ spots in Texas.

It's just my sense that in a typical fast-food chain, this would've gotten the employee in trouble, so this small thing cued me that the staff is customer-oriented.\\n\\nThe burgers were Excellent, and the fries Very Good.  I ordered 2 burgers for myself, but could only eat one (generous portions). \\n\\nAt my age and cholesterol level, burgers and fries are a special treat, and it's nice to not feel like can partake without compromising on quality."},{"name":"Babica Hen Cafe","address":"15964 Boones Ferry Rd","city":"Lake Oswego","stars":"4","text":"Love this place- a great gem for the breakfast community in Lake Oswego.

And if that's accurate, I feel for you, Columbus. \\n\\nLet me start by saying that the food was OK.   Not great, not bad, just average.  However, some of the other details are what has probably led to a restaurant that, for a time, had me as its sole customer last night. \\n\\nFirst, I ordered hibachi shrimp with extra shrimp.   They did not give the chef the extra shrimp, nor did he notice that he hadn't prepared it.   I had to ask about it, and the chef had to ask for it from the kitchen.   Not cool.  \\n\\nNext, the chef informed the table that sake was on the house.  Really?  Sure, we'll have some.   Then he informed us that we were to drink it from a squirt bottle - which -- you guessed it -- meant that I was wearing some (and more went on my plate).   OK, not the smartest choice I've ever made, but still.. If you're going to do that, don't \\"over pour\\".   \\n\\nThe ginger sauce - which is thick and hearty at, well, every other Japanese steakhouse I've been at, was totally watery and didn't (consequently) stick to or add much flavor to the food. \\n\\nThe chef, to his credit, was funny, skilled, and personable, and apologized profusely for the mix up with the shrimp, but overall, you can do better that this restaurant."},{"name":"FLIP burger boutique","address":"1587 Howell Mill Rd","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Loved the variety of burgers and sides.

Cranberry and havarti on a turkey sandwich? Gorgonzola on roast beef? why haven't I thought of this? The Brown Bag truly is everything you could ask for in a deli.\\n\\nLocated in the heart of German Village, it's of little doubt that Brown Bag gets overlooked at lunchtime due to its proximity to Kat zinger's, possibly the most celebrated and well-known deli in the area, if not the entire city. It's no secret that Katzinger's Achilles heel is it's pricey menu; it's not out of the questions to spend around $20 on a lunch consisting of a turkey sandwich and coleslaw. It's a damn good turkey sandwich, mind you, but eating there on your lunch break even twice a week is likely to bankrupt you. Enter the Brown Bag Delicatessen. \\n\\nThe sandwiches at the Brown Bag are inventive, fresh, and as tasty as can be. The Village Addiction (the aforementioned sandwich that features turkey, havarti, and cranberry) is impossible to pass up and is worth every penny. The reuben is also one of the best I've tasted in years- the marble rye is fresh and soft, the sauerkraut doesn't overcrowd the sandwich, and the pastrami was tender and lean. Take that, Katzinger's!\\n\\n Another thing that wowed me here was the selection of fresh side dishes. When I was there for lunch about a week ago, the offering included a greek tomato salad, coleslaw, and a macaroni salad that ended up being incredibly tasty.

The chefs are involved and make everything there. The staff are so friendly and nice. My only criticisms are the fruit salad is sometimes old and not fresh, and they can get so busy at times that they can't keep up with cleaning or clearing tables, then again it's because it's busy so understandable, but they're never in a bad mood because of it, you just ask them to clean it and they're all smiles and wanting to help.

The Maple Bacon was my favorite but my Dad thought it could have used more maple, I agree the bacon on it was super crispy and salty(not greasy at all) super yummy but I got more of a light sweet lemony flavor than maple. I did not taste the Chocolate Almond but Dad wasn't a fan at all. My dad liked the fritter but could do without the raisins. I hate raisins and was very surprised since I thought it was an apple fritter would have been so much better without them, it was very crisp though which I liked. The Mexican chocolate was okay a little too much cinnamon for me. The Raspberry rosemary was interesting, very dense and seemed to be the greasiest of the 5, tasted like jam and rosemary, could skew a little too floral(i.e.: soapy/perfume), I think it is one of the donuts that you have to eat more of to get used to/like it.

The chicken was pretty great; it was crispy and the meat was juicy enough. There isn't an abundance of sauce, so if you like your chicken swimming in it this isn't the place for you, but if you like just a bit of that flavoring without it making the chicken soggy, I think you'll like it here. The chicken pieces aren't huge, but I think that for 10 pieces of wings and drumsticks (for a small) the price is fair enough. The soy garlic is quite sweet, and the spicy is a slow burn that really stings your lips. Love it!\\n\\nThe tteokbokki I took home with me, so I reheated it but it was still pretty good. This particular dish comes with some fishcakes, wheat/egg noodles (can't tell), and what I believe may be mandu, which are dumplings consisting of clear sweet noodles wrapped in seaweed and dough (?). I got two of these, and they were quite large. The rice cakes themselves were chewy and delicious, and the sauce wasn't watery but just thick enough. There is also a healthy dose of cheese and some sesame sprinkled on top. Pretty solid dish, and if you would like to try it but can't handle spice that well, just ask them to adjust it. Be careful to reheat the rice cakes well if you do - they get hard when cold, and soften up when hot. \\n\\nThe place was pretty empty on a weekday, but I hope that they have more success on weekends. Perhaps this isn't the type of food Salem is used to quite yet, but if you like Chinese and Japanese, give Korean a chance!

Everything together was delectable! \\n4. Smoked carrot (w/ goat cheese, mushroom chili) $9 - So simple, yet so flavorful. Must get! The carrot was really nicely done.\\n5. Pig skin noodles (w/ hot sauce, almond, shrimp) $11 - Delicious, but wasn't my favorite of the night. The texture and thickness of the pig skin noodles were a bit much for me. However, my girlfriends LOVED this dish.\\n6. Ricotta dumplings (w/snow pea, basil, fennel escabeche) $11 - This was my second favorite dish of the night. The ricotta dumplings are a thrilling burst of flavor in your mouth. Highly recommend trying this dish!\\n7. Crawfish boil tamale (w/ celery, radish, smoked sausage) $14 - Another favorite of mine. So unique in flavor.\\n8. Pig face carnitas (w/ refried sweet potato, peanut, cabbage) $14 - Okay, I don't remember eating this one. I may have passed out from all the exquisite food we were eating...\\n9. Grilled lamb sausage (swiss chard, potato, red mole) $16 - I did not try this one, since I am not a fan of lamb. My friends told me it was delicious though and the meat did not taste gamy.\\n10. Smoked Muscovy duck pie, (w/ shittake, leek, calamondin) $17 - Loved this one, but I am very partial to duck and pot pies. I loved the unique flavor.\\n11. Akaushi Bavette Steak (radicchio, green garlic, fried duck egg) $24 - The favorite of the night ALL around. The Akaushi Bavette Steak was just SO PERFECT. Perfectly cooked, perfectly seasoned, perfectly juicy. Even the radicchio was cooked so excellently it was devoured by all in seconds.\\n\\nI also ordered one of their House Sodas, their Grapefruit & Chocolate Mint. Extremely refreshing and delicious!\\n\\nHighly, highly recommend coming here. Excellent service, the pacing was spot on. They offer a vast selection of drinks.

The outside seating is in front on the street or along the back side sort of facing the parking. Inside is loud and filled with energy. Outside can be hot as there are no umbrellas or shade (in front anyway). We said first available and were seated out front. Temperature outside the night we dined was perfect, but I could imagine inside would be preferable the hotter the summer gets. \\n\\nMy nephew ordered the El Diablo, his 'usual', and the Parmesan truffle fries; I got the Greek burger plus the baby kale salad, with feta, watermelon and avocado. I don't eat bread/gluten, so took the burger off the bun and ate it with my salad - and it was a delicious combination!

The wait for a seat isn't terribly long (it's a first-come-first-serve establishment), and the staff is prompt, friendly, and as relaxed as the reggae playing through the speakers. As I'm down to 1% battery life, I make my way indoor, and a waiter who overhears my desire for a wall outlet makes the helpful recommendation to sit at the bar.

But it's not high tide for beer yet, so I flip to the cocktail menu and go for the Mule with a Kick, with its chipotle vodka, fresh lime, and ginger beer over ice. It's worth the Alexander Hamilton for sure.\\n\\nFor food, Parish Cafe gives you many options, but the place is known for its selection of specialty sandwiches, like The Bristol:\\n\\nRosemary, thyme, and garlic marinated, grilled chicken breast on toasted foccacia with Boursin cheese, sliced tomato, Boston Bibb lettuce, and homemade B√©arnaise aioli.

The valet held my hand to assist me out of the car (really he just tenderly touched my hand as I didn't really require help standing up). The ambience of the restaurant was super cute, with both indoor and outdoor seating. We sat outdoors and ordered the \\"small tray\\" of tacos. Our server Nicole was decent but it was another server (a really nice girl who's name I forget) who really made a great impression - she explained the tray to us and let us customize it with the tacos we wanted. My favorite was the fried oyster taco. I also LOVED the spicy cucumber salad. Our server forgot to bring  an extra taco we ordered, which was the only downside.

We arrived at 1 pm on a Sunday and fortunately the line wasn't too long PLUS there were still donuts left. Score! It was rather difficult to decide on these donuts as the available options all looked so delectable, but we finally chose not one, not two, but eventually three donuts between us:\\n\\nMeyer Lemon & Key Lime Curd ($3.75) - Such smooth custard enveloped between soft dough and enhanced by the bright explosion of zesty citrus. A must for tart flavor lovers!\\n\\nMatcha Latte ($3.25) - This was a very cake-y donut, but the green tea was still present. Surprisingly it was sweeter than I would have liked. \\n\\nPassion Fruit Cocoa Nib ($3.25) - Sigh. I still dream about this one and that says a lot considering I don't normally like eating donuts. However, this halo bun in particular has taken a special place in my stomach. Passion fruit for the sweet and sour, cocoa nibs to add the bitter, and finally a dash of cayenne for a spicy hi-ya! kick of surprise. My senses were reeling as I savored each bite of this delightful pastry. \\n\\nService was great - the guy at the register was grooving to the beat of the music and I may or may not have joined in. The prices for these donuts are actually quite reasonable considering you're paying for gourmet donuts.

Toppings are far too sweet, even for donuts. Too oily along the bottom. Globs of \\"glaze\\" on the traditional glazed raised, which should be a GLAZE not a full out dunk-and-glob. The focus of a true doughnut is the consistency, texture, and flavor of the dough. Yeasty, but not too sweet; not too salty; mild, but a bit tangy. Frosting compliments the flavor of the doughnut, rather than demolish and overtake it. My advice? If you're going to use a ton of glaze or frosting or sweet bits, lay back on the \\"sweet.\\" Or use less. Or provide an option to people who want a truly great doughnut, with or without the over-the-top sweet toppings. Toppings don't make the dough-nut. The DOUGH makes it.

However, with a wall full of taps that are hard to see unless you crowd the bar, it would be helpful if the menu included some kind of beer list. When we requested one, the waitress explained that they aren't going to make one until they complete their draft selection... \\nRiiight...\\nUpon visiting over three weeks later, they still didn't have a list.

What we didn't expect was the food runner that was confrontational and problematic. \\n\\nThe entire restaurant and bar were full to where you stand behind and wait for an opening to order a drink. If you havent been to the Yard house they have a large yard glass for drinks. We each ordered one and stood off to the side where my friend set his beer down on a 4 top table. Quickly a gentlemen came over and grabbed his drink, took it off and said please respect my daughters space. \\n\\nThe gentlemen began saying more and making more gestures as he circled the restaurant. He ran food to the bar guests and wouldnt you know, he made sure to make his way back by to bump into us and say more. Instead of creating a problem I requested a manager. \\n\\nUpon this request the gentlemen went over  to the manager before her coming to speak to us as paying guest. As she walked over she asked the little girl, whom is hanging out at dads work tying up a 4 top on game day, if she was okay and comfortable. The manager then turned to me and asked if I wanted to see a manager. \\n\\nThe solution and comments from the manager were less than positive. I explained to her what the gentlemen did and the fact in which he was now making his way to cause confrontation she replied with 'please avoid him.' I said you are kidding, right? He had to walk 15 feet out of his way to bump into me and carry on with his antics. The manager then went on to say understand things happen in life and we had to accommodate. I mentioned to the lady if that one food runner is the staple to this venue surviving a game day, they are in trouble. Furthermore bringing your kids to work should never be the solution. Case in point, by allowing this and making an excuse for them, they lost guest because of 3 additional seats not being able to be filled. The manager explained they were short staffed and had to make do. \\n\\nWe cashed out and left to go to PBR which is great. If you cannot staff or hold people responsible you are going to have alot more posts like this from others due to the fact that the Braves play their 81 times (minimum) a year. \\n\\nHopefully this venue fixes this issue and steps up the service towards their guest.

I'd had it once this way in NYC and it forever changed my perspective on eating this brunch dish with smoked salmon. Unfortunately, I would have to advise against anyone ordering the Eggs Benedict with prosciutto here. It's not REAL prosciutto. It's glorified, processed ham product that was thick, burnt and really tough to chew. The eggs however, were perfectly poached, the English muffin toasted just right and the Hollandaise was excellent on both taste and consistency.\\n\\nThankfully, my boyfriend ordered The Basket Case and I shared a good portion of his french toast, smothered in butter and syrupy goodness.\\n\\nWhy the four-star rating after the horrible prosciutto mishap? Because Breakfast club is adorable, the service is friendly diner style and the milkshakes will bring me back to their yard any day. They have so many other choices for food (not just breakfast) and all of the orders of the people sitting around us made me salivate as I waited (unaware of the impending disappointment) for my food.\\n\\nIt's so worth another shot.

I think this place has great food. That said, I do see some people's points with their reviews. The meat is about the most expensive in Austin. But what I don't like is something a little more subtle. It's got an overall, Cracker Barrel kind of vibe to it--unironic country music playing on the stereo, country related tchotchkes. It just reminds me too much of when you travel outside of Austin and you realize suddenly, you're in Texas. Can we get an outlaw country station playing at least? This is Willie Nelson's town.

It's easy to miss.\\n\\nUp a few stairs and around a bend and they have a nice inviting space.  There's a large bar area on one side with a patio on the edge, and on the other side some booth seating.\\n\\nI visited twice with a friend - both times on weekday evenings.  We sat outside on the patio the first time and settled on a booth the second.  Both were equally comfortable and we were served equally well in both spots.\\n\\nThe service on both occasions was excellent.  We were paid a quick visit almost immediately after seating for drinks and to outline the specials and given enough time to make up our minds, but not too much time that we felt lost in the crowd.  Both servers also had some good suggestions for us.  I'm not a Milestones regular, and almost everything on their menu sounds fantastic, so it took some deciding.  Just a few of the things on the menu that jump out at me are the Butternut Squash Ravioli, Pesto Chicken Penne and the Ahi Tuna Tacos.\\n\\nOn the first visit, I ordered a Filet Mignon with a pesto baked potato as the side.  The steak was excellent, though on the small side - 7oz for $33.  I was less than thrilled with the sides - the potato was subpar, and the accompanying vegetables were watery and flavorless.  My friend enjoyed her Chili-Crusted Tilapia and said she would not hesitate to order it again.\\n\\nNext time out, I ordered an old fashioned burger sans bacon and cheese with a Bellini.  Both the burger and the fries were outstanding and perhaps a better value at around $15.   I would definitely order this again, and the bellini was great as well.  For dessert, we shared the chocolate cake.  It would be a bit much for one person - too rich, too sweet, too heavy but for two it was just right.\\n\\nMilestones is definitely on the pricier side for my budget, though perhaps not out of line with the Joey's/Earls crowd.   Most of the starters are between $10 and $15 with mains hovering around $20 and up.  Drinks are all pushing $10 as well unless you can catch them on a special day.  \\n\\nWe found the atmosphere quite cozy on both visits.  It's a good spot for a special meal if you come at the right time.  Around 7pm on a Tuesday, we found the bar area got really crowded and noisy.

This place really does have the potential to be a great bar.  The atmosphere is great, the music they play is good, and its a nice big place, so there's plenty of space to move.  So I know what you're asking: then why would you review this place 2 stars?  I'll tell you why, skipper.\\n\\nThe place is overflowed with college kids and ugly people looking to get drunk and act like shmucks, that's why!  The crowd just doesn't mix well together.  It's like going to a pig pen overcrowded with chickens and horses: they don't mix!  The bouncers don't know the meaning of \\"quota\\" and \\"demographics\\".  They'll let the first person with a douchebag grin on their face right in!  There's never any lines waiting to go inside, because everyone is automatically let in!  For god sakes, I don't know what the point is for having a bouncer.  More like a butler to me: opens the door for all patrons.\\n\\nSecondly, this place is really cheap.  And why is that a bad thing?  I'll tell you why, captain.  Because it's on Boylston Street!  If this bar were located in Brighton, Chinatown, or anywhere near those areas, then it would be highly appreciated to have a cheap bar.  But since it's in the classiest section of Boston, you get a bunch of college kids in a place where that's the very last thing you want to see.  Go to Comm Ave, assholes.\\n\\nAnd finally, the service is terrible.  They have turtles working for them.  It takes forever just to get a drink.  After barely squeezing in to grab a spot at the bar, it took the guy 30 minutes to serve me one damn beer!  I definitely needed that beer to calm down.\\n\\nIn short, if you feel like mingling with drunken frat boys, or maybe just looking for a grimey joint in the Boylston area, then check this baby out.

The reason why I didn't go before is 'cause I was dealing with one dietary restriction or another. I am on a cleanse maintenance, however, I came to the point where I just said \\"fuck it\\" and went. I posted a Yelp thread a few months back on the best cr√®me brulee in the city and this place was mentioned frequently responses. I owed it to myself to try. I am a cr√®me brule whore and have made a lighter sugar free version at home. Today I wanted the real thing, the real good thing. The cr√®me was 4 oz and was rich and creamy, I could just eat one as a meal by itself it's that filling. It was good, however, still Kari C. makes the best cr√®me brulee ever. This is the first best restaurant cr√®me brulee that I have ever had. The consistency was that of which wasn't a regular occurrence with me in all my cr√®me brule-ing thus far. As described by another reviewer, it was more pudding like which worked for me. I decided later to have the passion fruit tart and the Florentine. When in Rome...or in this case...when in France. The prices of the meals were reasonable, a lot more than what I was originally expecting. They're open late which was a good Saturday night alternative for me since I really don't do the whole club thing. I didn't realize until later that the place is split into two. I must have been to the bar side which was tinier and had a more hipster sheek vibe at 9:30 pm on a Saturday. This threw me off a bit, however, I went with it. I was severely underdressed, however, still served promptly and with the same exceptional service. The bartender and the host were really nice and sweet frequently joking with me. I received all my dishes in a prompt timely manner. The waiter was constantly wiping the bar down ensuring a nice clean atmosphere so that no one wrecked their clothes from accidental wine spillage or had sticky elbows while eating. I found it hard to be lady like when eating my dishes, especially with the Florentine. I treated it more like a pizza with my hands. I could picture my aunt turning in her grave at the lack of culinary grace, however, I just went with it.

This is John Rivers of 4Rivers fame newest place located in Winter Park. The restaurant had opened over a month ago. I was excited to try this place out since I love 4Rivers, but was a little reserved since the reviews weren't that great. Nonetheless, I still wanted to check it out. \\n\\nIt wasn't hard to find at all. It's in Winter Park, but away from the traffic off Park Avenue and Orlando Avenue. The parking lot could fit maybe 30 cars, but there's also street parking. The outside has the look of a red barn, maybe that's where the COOP name derived from? We got there around 7pm and the line was long, but not wrapped around the restaurant like when it was first opened. Once you step inside, there is another line before you get to the counter to order your food. There are two dining rooms and outdoor seating so plenty of seating. In between the dining rooms is the condiment, fountain drinks, tea and wash station. \\n\\nBefore we get to the counter we had already decided to order a variety of things to try. Along the counter is a display case of mini-pies, cake shooters. etc.  Nothing stood out to me so we stuck with our choices of bread pudding and banana pudding for our desserts. The food is laid out similar to 4Rivers for you to see. You are asked what you want for the main entree then the sides are added afterwards like a cafeteria line. When the guy was plating the smothered pork chops, I made a comment to my sister and friend that it reminded me of school lunch. Lol, the guy heard it and laughed. It wasn't meant in a bad way, the experience just reminded me of that:) After placing our orders, we grabbed our four trays of food and found a table inside one of the dining rooms. \\n\\nI went to the station to fill my cup with their sweet tea. I took a quick sip to gauge the sweetness of it, and to my disappointment I had to add more sugar because it was not sweet enough.  \\n\\nThe first plate we tried was the 3 piece dark meat fried chicken with creamed corn, rice and beans. The chicken was well seasoned and tasted good. However, the skin wasn't crispy at all. I remember the fried chicken I had from Willie Mae's in New Orleans and how crispy the skin was. Now that was some good fried chicken! The creamed corn was okay and wasn't creamy. It was clumpy. It didn't taste fresh and the cream had solidified somewhat I guess from sitting a little too long. The rice and beans were alright.\\n\\nThe second plate was the low country shrimp, andouille sausage and grits with a side of cornbread.  The cornbread was good and wasn't dry at all.  The grits weren't creamy and by the time I started on it, it had already hardened.  I thought the dish was a little oily and you could actually see the layer of oil on top. The shrimp and sausage were a little salty, but not much. I don't think I would order this plate again. \\n\\nThe third plate was the smothered pork chops with mac-n-cheese and collard greens.  The mac-n-cheese was tasty with plenty of cheesy sauce. The collard greens to me weren't cooked long enough so it was bland. Also, it doesn't taste like it was cooked with ham hocks/bacon etc so that didn't help either. The smothered pork chops was tender, the sauce was good, but not WOW.  \\n\\nThe fourth plate was the meatloaf with mashed potatoes with gravy and green beans. The meatloaf was smoked and a house made ketchup sauce I'm assuming was lathered on top. The meatloaf was good, but again nothing special.  \\n\\nThe fifth plate was the deviled eggs.  My first bite into one and my initial thought was that it was very salty. Took another bite, and still salty. Regardless, it was okay. \\n\\nNow on to the desserts. If you've ever been to 4Rivers then you know their desserts are awesome especially the banana pudding. When I saw it on the menu, I had to order one thinking it would taste the same. Well I was wrong. I tasted more whipped cream, very little pudding, and some banana chunks. It tasted nothing like the one I always have at 4Rivers.  The bread pudding was good, but the icing on top made it a little too sweet for my liking. We didn't finish either desserts.  \\n\\nService was friendly and the restaurant was very clean. \\n\\nI don't know what concept the owner was trying to achieve with this new place, but I think he should go back to what made 4Rivers popular-Quality, yummy food."},{"name":"Navarre","address":"10 NE 28th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Good food, good service and an affordable wine list.

The service is a little lacking with the older servers being rude on occasion however, the food generally comes out in a timely manner.  On weekends, the restaurant has a belly dancer which will come out at random times during your dining experience.  It's pretty awkward if you haven't encountered belly dancers before - they dance in front of your table for 30 seconds or so and walk away if it looks like your table is too uncomfortable.  We try to tip the dancer a few dollars.\\n\\nFood:  The food is pretty tasty.  Each table is given a plate of pita bread, feta cheese, radish and greens to share after ordering.  We generally order the Kubideh Kabob (ground beef with onions and spices), Barg Kabob (more of a marinated meat - looks like your normal shish kabob), and Chicken Kabob (boneless chicken breast pieces - around 8 pieces in total).  Each dish is served with white rice (long grain) and a grilled tomato.   If you are up for trying an appetizer, I recommend the Kashk Bodenjoon, which is an eggplant dish served with Pita bread (good replacement for Hummus if you want to try something new).  Overall, the food is pretty tasty!"},{"name":"To Dine For Eatery","address":"333 Terminal Avenue","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4.5","text":"If anyone is on the fence about the PB&B burger...Don't be!

The table had been set, so to speak, for Blais to wow the judges one last time with his canny blend of sophistication and whimsy. Instead, Richard screwed the pooch - or, at least, under-seasoned it - holding the door open for Stephanie, a competent chef with rosy cheeks who always reminded me of Holly Hobbie (ask your older sister).\\n\\nUpon hearing that Blais has set out to turn the world of burgers on its meaty ear, I couldn't wait to gorge upon the full breadth of his fevered imagination (and ego). Yet, like Top Chef judges Padma and the ultra-yummy Tom Colicchio at season's end, Richard left me despondent and confused. Et tu, Faux Hawk?\\n\\nSitting incongruously on a ugly, congested stretch of Howell Mill Road, Flip's boxy, modern styling would suit Los Angeles, as would its patrons. While waiting for a table on a bustling Tuesday night, I couldn't believe the amount of stylish waifs pigging out (I guess Vice magazine has decreed lamb burgers IN and heroin OUT.) White walls, discreet booths, flat screen televisions - the decor is what I imagine Shaquille O'Neal's basement to look like, only with way more white people.\\n\\nAfter a forty minute wait, we were shown our seats. Our waitress, fair-skinned and winsome, took our order. This is where everything fell apart. For my main dish I settled upon the first offering on the menu, the Flip burger. I specified the following in no uncertain terms:\\n\\n1. NO ONIONS. I have an onion allergy. Eating them makes me break out in a sweat and unleashes a high put-upon voice heard for miles.\\n\\n2. NO MAYONNAISE. I like eggs. I like vinegar. And I like oil. Mixing the three, however, triggers my gag reflex quicker than my first boyfriend ever could.\\n\\nShared appetizers of Tempura Asparagus and Okra made for a delectable, heart-clogging start. Crispy with the right amount of salt, the tempura complemented the encased, fresh vegetables superbly. And the dipping sauces were pure catnip. So far, so awesome.\\n\\nIt wouldn't last. In little time, I was presented with the first of what I will now call my Sadness Burger. Sadness Burger 1 looked beautiful, a stout marvel towering upon its little plate, more a work of art than something to pass through the body. But as I raised burger to mouth, white goo oozed upon my hands (insert tasteless joke here). \\n\\nMayonnaise. Mayonnaise I did not want. Mayonnaise that's not even listed on the menu. Okay, people err. So the waitress took the it back, and within twenty seconds I was presented with Sadness Burger 2. I eyed it suspiciously, and immediately noted that rather than give me a fresh, correct burger, they merely scraped the condiment off. Obnoxious, cheap, but nothing worth bellyaching about. I took a HUGE bite, and instantly my alarm systems went haywire.\\n\\nONIONS. IN. MY. MOUTH. I opened the bun, and there they were, a heap of sleeping eels. Angered, I leered into the kitchen looking for Mr. Top Chef, but he was nowhere to be found. Populating the kitchen instead were the kind of dour, punk-rock, kitchen journeymen you'd expect to be fixing nachos at The Highlander, a pack of tattooed Judases.\\n\\nThe manager came over and I explained the situation. With apologies, he took the offending plate away. A minute later I was presented with Sadness Burger 3. I held it up, said a little prayer, and chomped.\\n\\nSomething was off. Really off. While I couldn't detect the texture of onions, the flavor was still prevalent. And then it dawned: yet again, they scraped the offending ingredient off, and sent it back. As if I couldn't have done the same thing. Here's a news flash: THAT DON'T WORK WITH ONIONS. Like Princess Diana and herpes, onions leave an ever-lasting mark. I chose not to risk Sadness Burger 4 (The Quickening), and instead polished off a pound of bacon at home, a cure-all for disappointment. \\n\\nOh Richard Blais...I root for you and yet hipster cooks in your name hath spurned me. I like believing that had you been there, this wouldn't have happened. So next time, stop sharpening your hair and be the top chef I know you can be."},{"name":"Summer Shack-  Cambridge","address":"149 Alewife Brook Pkwy","city":"Cambridge","stars":"3","text":"Never had bad service or bad food here.

It was very bizarre.  Then a friend brought ice cream down from Lick - we were on the patio in front - I understand they have a policy and we are more than happy to have her eat it elsewhere, but the way it was handled, you would have thought she pulled out her own wine and sat it on the table.

That being said, I'm thankful for my initial faux pas, as Babette's Cafe has since become one of my preferred destinations in Atlanta for a casual and consistently pleasant brunch.\\n\\nFood: The brunch menu is comprised of simple, yet unique offerings with subtle European influences. My favorite is the brioche french toast, which is topped with fresh bananas, walnuts, and an impeccable caramel sauce. I'm also a recurring fan of their scone and muffin basket; it's not complimentary, but the contents are always fresh and piping hot upon arrival, as if they had just come out of the oven. The available sides are fairly standard; I typically opt for the bacon or cheese grist, both of which are acceptable, but by no means memorable. \\n\\nService: The service is really the only aspect of Babette's that I find substandard. The hosts and waitstaff are mostly pleasant. However, there is one older male waiter that always has a a gruff, impersonal aura, to the point where I will likely request to be moved if I'm seated at his table in the future. His demeanor is more characteristic of an automotive mechanic than a waiter.\\n\\nAtmosphere: Rustic European chic. The dining room also has an ample supply of natural sunlight. There is an outdoor heated patio; however, the view is essentially the back parking lot, so I've never felt compelled to sit there.\\n\\nCost: Brunch entrees are mostly around $10, but there are some items that are markedly more expensive for obvious reasons, such as the steak and eggs (~$25). Sides are all served a la carte and range from $2 to $4. My beloved scone and muffin basket is $6.75 for a full order (5) or $4.25 for a half order (3). \\n\\nOther: Only valet parking has been available when I have dined at Babette's. However, there are alternative nearby options if you'd prefer to avoid the hassle and invasion of your personal space; I typically have luck with the lot across the street."},{"name":"Blue Star Donuts","address":"1155 SW Morrison St, Ste 102","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Honestly I don't know what all the hype is about with this place.

Ribs were more of the same, probably a tad overcooked, not real meaty, but good flavor. My arrival after 2PM may have been a factor in the meat maybe not being quite at peak serving condition, but I really had no complaints. Jalapeno & cheese sausage wasn't loaded with either, but had a nice spicy flavor to it, somewhat leaner and finer texture than what you get at most places. It was decent, but not something I would choose as a main feature. I'm a big fan of cream corn, like they have at the original Black's in Lockhart, so I enjoyed having that option, as well as good quality mac & cheese, moist and flavorful, contrary to the plasticky yellow instant mix goop you get at most joints. The sauce was pretty unassuming, but I don't use much sauce, so it was adequate. \\n\\nYou won't get better barbecue from a chain. As far as sit-down restaurant barbecue in a real restaurant setting with normal hours, there aren't many options in the area that give Terry Black's a serious challenge. It's certainly a welcome addition to the scene in a good location and should become a popular stop and remain so for years to come.\\n\\nYou could probably get somewhat tastier smoked meat by waiting in a humongous line for two, three or four hours or more, if you really want to consume it in a dusty half-assed semi-shelter in sweltering Texas heat while breathing in carbon monoxide and burning rubber from the nearby traffic in a seedy part of town.

While not on special, the lemonade is delicious and my only qualm is that there are no free refills :(\\n\\nFor the food, I tried out the samosa chaat, the chicken samosas, chicken pakoras and their aloo nan.\\n\\nChicken Pakoras: AMAZING! They are white meat chicken chunks deep fried in a chicke pea batter. The chicken was cooked perfectly and the pakoras were delicious and not oily at all. My friends and I liked it so much we placed a second order of it. The first time, they gave it to us with a tikka masala sauce and the second order came with the traditional mint and tamarind chutneys as it is supposed to. \\n\\nSamosa chaat: For the samosa chaat, we stuck to the traditional potato and pea samosas. They chaat was not spicy at all..I wish it was a little spicier but I guess this is perfect for clay pit clientele. From my previous visists to clay pit for their lunch buffet I've realized it's not the traditional indian spice level...much milder. The chaat came with a garbazo bean curry and I've had this item before during from the regular menu and I noticed a significant difference in the portion. Happy hour portion was half of what I got previsouly. \\n\\nChicken samosa: The chicken samosas were VERY OILY and cheesy. This is not a traditional indian street food item. I've had meat samosas before and it's usually spiced ground meat but this was a fusion of samosa and a jalapeno popper. These were my least favorite dish mainly because they were dripping in oil. \\n\\nAloo nan: Hot, fresh, moist and soft but not much potato filling.

When I finally went to Hopdoddy's I had my work cut out for me. The line was so long, you would think I was standing in line for Franklin's BBQ on a weekend. But I wasn't. I was just in line for a burger. But I waited because I was determined to try what my friend described as \\"the best burger in Austin\\" (during which I had to correct her and tell her the best burger in Austin comes from an older, more historic place in Austin-lol). \\n\\nAfter making it through the long line and deciding among the many choices of 'fancy' burgers, add-ons, cheeses, etc., I chose the Llano Poblano (my hubs had The Goodnight Burger). Oh and the ordering and seating process is strange;  after you stand in line you make it to the front, place your order - get a number/cup for your drink and then wait for a table to open up.  Then you get a \\"server\\" after you sit, that starts taking care of you, asking if you need/want anything. Are you supposed to tip this person? I know this is to turn-tables over faster but it just feels weird to me. Anyway, back to the burgers: the meat was good and juicy (albeit bland and just a little too undercooked even for my man), the toppings were tasty, I loved the sassy sauce on my husband's burger and the chipotle mayo on mine was excellent. The fries were good, the caramel and sea salt milkshake is really what is getting the 4 stars here. I don't like ice cream or milkshakes (cold stuff makes my teeth hurt) but my goodness - this milkshake had me wanting more and would actually make me go back to Hopdoddy's despite the fact that the burgers were just okay. \\n\\n4 Stars for HBB because the service was good, everyone was nice, the food was all around good.

How do I rate this place after last night's UYE (http://www.yelp.com/events/atlanta-buford-highway-uye-ca-dao-vietnamese-cuisine)?  I showed up several minutes beforehand to make sure the restaurant was ready to handle us, since over 20 people clicked they were in.  The owner and employee quickly arranged several tables together to form one long table that seated 20.  This turned out to be perfect since exactly 20 people showed up.\\n\\nEverything in my original review still holds true.  A very popular dish ordered last night was #71, the burnt rice with pork dish.  I saw several plates of spring rolls, hot bowls of pho, and cups of bubble tea as well.  Everyone seemed to like the food and bubble teas, so that was a win.\\n\\nThe service was quite disappointing, however.  I came in person and spoke with the owner about one month prior to make sure he knew a big group was coming.  I also called the restaurant on Tuesday and Wednesday (no answer either time) and left voice mails to make sure they knew we were still coming.  No response.\\n\\nThe food was brought out as fast as they could cook it.  Some people got their dishes in no time.  Others had to wait forever.  The longest wait was for my rice dish, which took 2 hours and 15 minutes.  TWO HOURS AND FIFTEEN MINUTES!  I've never waited for food that long before.  By the time my dish arrived, half the people were already paying and getting ready to go.  It wasn't just the rice dishes, but pho too.  I actually wasn't too upset because I was having a good time talking to everyone, but I did feel bad for some of the other Yelpers like Cynthia N. and Julie C. who were experiencing Vietnamese food for the first time.\\n\\nI think there were only three people working in the restaurant: the owner, owner's wife, and server.  At one point, the owner tried to discreetly leave the restaurant and returned carrying a small black bag -- probably of ingredients they'd run out of back in the kitchen.  When he left, we were joking that he went down the street to Pho Dai Loi to get extra bowls of pho for us.\\n\\nCa Dao isn't really equipped to handle a large group such as ours, but I still think they are okay if you are coming with a smaller group.  They just aren't used to having many customers.  Case in point, we were the only customers in the restaurant the entire night.\\n\\nThanks to everyone who came and to Kathleen for handing out \\"YELP LIFE\\" gloves to everyone.

We're from Houston and we've had some very good barbecue. We were in Austin for the day and all the places we wanted to try had lines of at least 2 hours so we thought with the ok rating we'd give this place a try. In hindsight, we should have guessed it wouldn't be great seeing as there was literally no line at 2 pm on a Saturday. We walked in and saw that they have a chalkboard menu that tells you how it works: grab a plate, get your sides, and then your meat is carved. The sides are served buffet style and they were oooooold. The mac n cheese was solidified; it looked like it might've been good if it was fresh, but it wasn't fresh or flavorful. The creamed corn looked very unappetizing. The corn was drowning in a milky liquid. They also had beans which had pork (we don't consume pork) so I can't rate those. The coleslaw was ok, same with the potato salad, and the rice was old. It didn't taste like much. On to the meats. There was a little bit of confusion because the girl who handed us the plates told us we could get the family pack which consists of 5 sides and 3 pounds of meat. When we went to the meat carving station we ordered moist beef brisket, beef ribs, and turkey. When we rabdomly mentioned that we were getting the family pack that the guy carving the meat told us the beef ribs aren't included. They made an exception for us which is the reason for one of the stars. The other star is for one of the sauces they serve. But back to the meats. The turkey tasted like pepper, the brisket was fall apart tender and had a thick bark, but sadly, that bark didn't taste of any spices (or smoke) at all. The beef ribs were the worst. They also had a thick bark, but all I could taste was salt. No smoke flavor, no sweetness, no meaty flavor, just salt. And there was a ridiculous amount of fat on there. At least half the weight of the rib was the fat, and of the other half a quarter was bone. It was a huge disappointment. Onto the sauces. They have 3: original, spicy, sweet and tangy. The spicy and original were ok, but they were room temperature and weren't anything tk write home about. The sweet and tangy sauce was good, just wish it was at least warm. Definitely won't come back. Oh and one last thing, their prices are steep. We paid $78 for 3 pounds of meat and 5 sides.

The towels are REALLY hot) and their menu has a nice selection including some combination plates that are huge. The tempura is always crispy and fresh and the sushi never disappoints us.\\n\\nThey have large combos that have 3 different entrees and I love to get these, even though I have never finished one.  They come with miso soup, salad, 2 gyoza, rice and the 3 medium-sized entrees that come in whichever combo plate you get.

It took us a minute standing in the foyer to figure out that the next door wasn't just a wall hanging.  Inside the restaurant, the tables are put far too close together.  My friend had to repeatedly pull her chair in so close to the table that her stomach was touching it just to give other people enough room to get by.  The elderly couple at the table next to us may as well have been sitting with us.  They were so close that we could hear their entire dinner conversation, and they even turned to us to talk to us like we were part of their party several times.  \\n\\nAs for the food, now I've never had Tibetan food before.  It's entirely possible that as far as Tibetan food goes, this is top-notch.  All I can say is, it was bland.  It was almost as bland as undergraduate cafeteria food.  I'd heard Tibetan food is like Indian food, only less spicy, but this essentially had no spice at all.

While we were enjoying the Apps, Steve led us through the menu, answering in detail any questions asked. Everything was presented beautifully; Curry Bowl, Mahi Mahi, Ahi Tuna Salad, Miso Salmon were all excellent. The desert of choice for our group were the Cream Cheese Fried Wontons.

Glances always indirect with attention elsewhere, he played the role like Bogart - slightly dismissive, staying in the shadow of the host station, engaged with the computer screen which has some no doubt messages of importance that needed constant attention lest some mission would be lost or in dire straits. With our party the only one in the restaurant, it must've been difficult to maintain that distractedness while waiting for the cooking timers to ring. Nonetheless, while he could not be bothered to come to the table other than to drop off the food, it was indeed of high quality, even if it was a requirement that white rice needed to be purchased - a small concession - that. The pork dishes, the tofu, the chicken - all were tasty with the three dishes easily satisfying our band of four.

Go to Topgolf or Midtown Bowl down the street. \\nI'd like to preface this by saying that i, as well as everyone else in my party, are/were in the restaurant industry. I went with my husband on 2/17/17 for his birthday plus two others. \\nThe experience that set the tone for the evening was with the hostess, a petite, Caucasian brunette at around 6:15 pm. It was everyone's first time and she treated us like we were supposed to automatically know coming in how things worked. She was standoffish, abrasively curt, and all of us (including my friend, who is literally the \\"give you the shirt off her back\\" type of person) got a snarky vibe from her- like our questions and our presence wasn't welcome. I know from my experience working in Buckhead fine dining that as black people, restaurant staff can be VERY demeaning and assuming EVEN black servers; to state things plainly, some restaurant staff will treat you differently because they assume you won't tip. This was that vibe!!!\\nI NEVER ask to speak to managers, and I was so disgusted with the start of my husband's birthday evening that I asked to speak to a manager. The manager answered our questions and we went on with our meal. Loaded fries (okay/worthwhile), pretzel bites (no), fried chicken sandwich (mediocre), fried chicken tacos (dry), burger (friend enjoyed). \\nService was cool at the table, not the best or the worst service I've had. I mean, it's a bowling alley.\\nThe bowling itself was $35 an hour. Which is fine, but when we paid for the bowling and shoe rental, we were expected to tip (?!?).

The ceiling are incredibly high and adorned with huge chandeliers, tapestries and curtains. The color scheme was made up of mostly black and reds -- I wasn't crazy about the atmosphere, it was a little too dark and vampire-esque for my taste.\\n\\nThe menu is fairly small and offers small plates and charcuterie to start, and salads, pasta, fish and meat as entrees. We all started off with wine and cocktails. I ordered a signature cocktail off the menu that was made with gin, prosecco, limoncello and cucumber. It was refreshing but very strong.\\n\\nA few of us started by ordering the Chef's selection of charcuterie and cheese. The board had 3 tiers and came with a decent amount of food for it's $35 price tag. Unfortunately no one explained to us what was on the board, so we were left guessing for ourselves. For my entree, I ordered a half portion of pasta: squid ink macaroni with charred octopus and house made sausage. I liked the pasta, but I didn't love it. I felt the pasta itself was cooked a bit inconsistently, and the octopus was a little tough. The sausage on the other hand was amazing. This dish was very, very filling so I ended up taking most of it home with me.\\n\\nSome of the table favorites were the tagliatelle bolognese, the salt crusted dorade and the ricotta gnudi.\\n\\nBesides the lack of charcuterie explanation, the service at the restaurant was pretty spot on and it was great that our group of 13 has our own private section in the back of the restaurant."},{"name":"Orinoco","address":"22 Harvard St","city":"Brookline","stars":"4","text":"Delicious food with awesome atmosphere!\\n\\nGreat little restaurant in quaint area.\\n\\nAll the food is amazing.

The bartender was really nice and helpful. She explained the taste profiles of various cocktails to me and I eventually settled on the Pandoras Box. It was delicious, the lychee flavor came through, but not too much and it balanced out the tart grapefruit. \\n\\nOnce my friends and I had been seated at the table we decided to order a bottle of wine. The waitress really knew her stuff when it came to describing the various Greeks vinos they offered. She even brought us out samples of four different wines to help us choose. \\n\\nTo begin each table receives bread and olive oil, both delicious and of a high quality. We then received an amuse of three spreads: htipiti (roasted red pepper), tzatziki and melitzanosalata (eggplant caviar). The first and the last were rich in flavor, and absolutely delicious. The tzatziki spread was refreshing but the other two definitely stood out more. These spreads are served with lovely warm and soft pita bread. \\n\\nWe then split three small meze. The first to arrive were the zucchini fritters. They were not at all what I was expecting, they were so much better! The fritters were crisp outside and soft inside with a filling of blended zucchini and feta cheese. The calamari arrived next, and this dish was similarly good. Also the calamari portion was pretty large for an appetizer which was nice. Finally the last meze was the ahi tuna. I have never had tuna this good before. There was a lovely smokey taste to the fish, and the pickled ramps that accompany it were the perfect compliment! \\n\\nFour our mains I had the lamb two ways; braised and seared on a bed of tomato orzo. The seared lamb was some of the best I have ever tasted. It was crispy outside and juicy inside. The braised lamb was also very good but the seared was much better. The tomato orzo was very tasty. There was also some creamy cheese buried at the bottom of the dish, so it was a nice surprise to break through and mix it into the tomato sauce for a richer taste. \\n\\nMy friends ordered a whole fish (royal dorade) to split which came with quinoa. I tried their fish and it was amazing, so fresh and clean tasting! The fish comes drizzled with olive oil, lemon and capers so it is a really nice, light dish perfect for a summer night. I thought the quinoa cooked with grape leaves was quite tasty, but nothing special in comparison to everything else I'd tried that evening. \\n\\nFinally we finished our meal with the dessert platter. We chose the baklava (with pistachio ice cream), custard pie (with cinnamon ice cream) and the loukoumades (Greek doughnuts). The loukoumades had to be my favorite; it was soft, and not greasy, soaked in delicious honey. The other two desserts were both very, very good too. The custard pie was amazing and the baklava had a kick of cinnamon which was yummy. It was my friends birthday so the kitchen wrote happy birthday on the dish and gave us the dessert for free which was very nice of them! \\n\\nUltimately as I said above, fantastic food, fabulous service and great drinks.

We went in to the restaurant with a high hope enjoying a delicious Indian food. Reservation was done well in advance, and were told to come by 8:30 PM, and we were there at 8:23 PM. Expected to be seated. \\n\\nFirst issue, had to wait for almost 30 minutes before we got seat, We though that's okay, if food is good, it would be worth the wait. However management should be better than this and shouldn't overbook, its better to say NO, then to make someone wait for the food.\\n\\nSecond issue, After we were seated, and ordered for food, it took another 25 mins for the food to show up.

My dad is actually from Xian so I was super excited when I found out this place is super close to our home!\\n\\nThe place looks small when you first walk in, but there's plenty of seating in the back, behind the register. There is also a sushi bar. We didn't try any sushi the first time around, as I was most excited about the hand-pulled noodles. My mom makes amazing homemade noodles (not pulled, but still delicious) and I was really looking for something that was hearty and authentic.\\n\\nWe got the dan dan noodles (triangle noodles) and the beef noodle soup (pappardelle). It's pretty cool that you can pick what noodle dish you like and what noodle shape you like! I typically like fatter noodles, although the pappardelle was a little too wide for my taste. It kept slipping through the chop sticks and was a mess...\\n\\nI really like the triangle noodles. The name is a little deceiving because they're more of like... a rhombus, squiggly shape... (see picture for reference). But it's just the right amount of chew & flavor soakage.\\n\\nNow onto the dishes - they weren't really what I was expecting...? The dan dan noodles kind of looked more like the beef noodle soup and the beef noodle soup was more bland than normal (see picture for reference - the bowl in the foreground is the dan dan noodle). The broths tasted really similar, except the dan dan noodle had the chili sauce already (the chili sauce is really good btw!). \\n\\nOverall, I really enjoyed my dish even though it wasn't what I was expecting, but my boyfriend wasn't too impressed with his beef noodle soup. I had a few bites and I could see where he was coming from. The broth was thinner and lighter than normal (would have expected a deeper brown), kind of more MSG-ish and less dense meaty flavor, and he really didn't have much else in the bowl aside from slices of beef, where as mine came with pickled cabbage and spinach. The dan dan noodles I had in the past were less brothy and usually with ground beef.\\n\\nI'm giving it a 4 star because it's nice to see a modern spin on the Chinese cuisine, and although I could be more disappointed if I compare it to traditional Xian food or what my parents make... it was still pretty darn good food! And I would definitely go back to satisfy my noodle cravings. :)"},{"name":"Vancouver Christmas Market","address":"1055 Canada Place","city":"Vancouver","stars":"3","text":"I glad I went at lunchtime and only had to pay $2; it did not seem like there was a lot there in the way of crafts, it was more about the food.

When you are seated, you will be at one of five or six bar-height tables set to accompany six people comfortably. You will most likely sit next to strangers. Small plates, small place, close proximity to others, and more than attentive waitstaff make BS an intimate experience: You see what everyone orders and you hear what they think of it as they eat.\\n\\nIf you aren't adventurous when it comes to dining out, then steer clear. I am almost always willing to jump into the deep end when it comes to food, and even though I have tried so many things I was surprised to welcome several firsts: beef tongue, pork belly, and whiskey gel.   \\n\\nI highly recommend eating each item on the plate together: cut small, manageable pieces and stack them together on the fork so that you get the gastro experience.\\n\\nThe fried crab risotto were crispy balls of tender and creamy risotto. Since I am not a fan of risotto, I can't give an unbiased opinion on it other than to say my friends thought it was rich and tasty. I was thrilled to chew on the morels since it has been years since I have had them.\\n\\nThe foie gras was paired with pork belly, a lethal combination if there ever was one, and served with goat cheese grits and watermelon. The watermelon was deep red and had a crisp texture and tasted just about sweet. The beef tongue was a hefty serving, considering it is a tapa. So, my first experience with pork belly and beef tongue? The beef tongue was tender and tasted much like roast beef. The pork belly was stringy like pork jerky with a chuck of fat attached. For meat lovers, pork belly is on the highest plane and there are those who dream about making sweet love to pork belly because of the potent fatty and meaty flavor. I like meat every now and then, so I guess that is why pork belly is not all that amazing to me.\\n\\nMy favorite two dishes were the scallops and rabbit. The scallops were perfect. Just shy of fully cooked and with the jalapeno sauce, they were a perfect snack at the end of a hot day. They were accompanied by delicious cantaloupe seasoned with Spanish red pepper. The grilled rabbit was chopped and pressed into a slender brick with spices and abundant herbs. The turnips which were tender and not bitter in the least.\\n\\nWe had to try two desserts. The smoked pecan fudge came with freshly made marshmallow discs which looked like convex moon craters scattered all over the plate. The salted caramel ice cream was wonderfully sweet, salty and creamy. Everything would have been delicious if it weren't for the thin, smoky layer on top of the fudge. The fudge melted like a dark chocolate ganache in my mouth but the smoky after taste made me shutter.  The second dessert was a peach tart in almond crust with whiskey gel and a scoop of buttermilk ice cream. I didn't get much of a whiskey taste from the gel, but that aside the entire dessert was absolutely amazing.\\n\\nTowards the end of our meal, the manager came over to one of my friends and said, \\"Are you wagging your tail?\\" Yes, he was. With every bite, he jiggled back and forth in his chair with excitement. When it comes to tapas, this is the best experience. You should try a variety and just be thrilled with each bite because it is deliciously new and unique."},{"name":"Boston Coffeehouse","address":"1573 Saxon Blvd, Ste 5","city":"Deltona","stars":"4","text":"The servers here are so nice.

Never mind that he was in a car accident and apologized profusely when he arrived.

Since he couldn't open a bank account, rent an apartment, or get paid by UT until he got his Social Security card, he stayed at my house for a couple of months.  I knew in advance he was vegetarian, so I headed to Whole Foods and bought a bunch of spices and food so I could cook Indian food for him.  I thought  I did OK; I made channa masala, saffron rice, lentils, some spicy potatoes from a recipe I found.  \\n\\nOne day we left campus coming down Guadalupe and he saw Clay Pit.  He offered to buy me dinner there.  We walked in and I've never seen someone's eyes light up like his.  He was in heaven.  We ate and ate till we couldn't eat any more.  Was it really that good, or only good compared to what this midwestern carnivorous farmboy cooked for him?  He's very polite, and said it was very good by its own right.

I go for the music and the ambiance. I have tried some of their bar food - which isn't really \\"bar\\" food, and its wonderful. \\n\\nThis place is CLASSY. It has old world charm and the service matches the ambiance. The host is gracious and friendly. The wait staff are always attentive. They even have some outside seating where you can sit, be served, and it is NO SMOKING.... \\n\\nCheck out their music calendar which is an eclectic assortment of jazz, classical and blues. On a rare night you can catch Curtis Salgado (As Satellite Malone) crooning some low-down Chicago blues. (for a mere $6.00 cover last night) \\n\\nOne of these days I will get there for dinner. It is somewhat pricey and might be reserved for a romantic getaway."},{"name":"Hopdoddy Burger Bar","address":"1400 S Congress Ave, Ste A190","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Had \\"The Goodnight\\" burger, it was delicious, as were their truffle fries.

They make much of the fact that they bake their own buns, fries, and curate a creative selection of burgers that offer bison, turkey, angus beef, lamb, and vegetarian options. I had the turkey burger and it did not disappoint. The bun was fresh, wheat, and sprinkled with oats. The turkey was juicy, combined with blue cheese to give it a tart twist. A slice of bacon added texture and enough salt that combined with the cheese and turkey. Wonderful, and i look forward to trying the bison, lamb, and kobe burgers. \\nAm not convinced that their system of ordering, table reserving, and plastic utensils match the quality of the burgers, though. Awesome roll of paper towels on the table."},{"name":"Tassili's Raw Reality","address":"1059 Ralph D Abernathy Blvd","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4.5","text":"I love this place.

I do my best not to set expectations high, especially with restaurants with good ratings, but the experience as a whole was lackluster. After being seated, it took about 10 minutes before our waiter greeted us. Another 5 mins to have drinks ordered, then after that we never saw him come to our table again. It took another 10 mins before we were able to flag down a waiter to take our order of tapas for us. In conclusion, food was alright, a few of the tapas were almost... border line room temperature. Once the tapas and drinks were dropped off, no one came to check up on how we were doing or to offer refills on drinks. At this point, we quietly got up, went to the front, paid our bill and left. I have worked in the service industry, I am fully aware of the stress that people experience while working, however this was unacceptable.
