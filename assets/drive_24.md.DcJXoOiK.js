Easily accessible via a 5 minute walk from the airport and Maverick Square Blue Line T- stops.  Much more seating and a bigger space than Reginas, but it does get packed at night. They are famous for their steak tips and pizza, and while the pizza is incredible, the steak tips are just slightly above average, which kills me to say, given the hype from people. The steak tips are cooked right behind the bar and served with full peppers and a large piece of fresh Italian bread. Staff is incredibly friendly, and you will get the full Boston local vibe from the staff that has been there for years. Pizza is great thin crust, not overly greasy at all. One downside is that the bar does not have a TV for some reason, so do not go here if you are looking for a game. There is only one size pizza, so do not be alarmed by the inexpensive price, because the pizza will easily serve 2-3 people....it's not some individual size pizza.

The alaska was quite standard with avocados in the middle and a salad dressing on top without too much rice surrounding the filling. The firecracker roll is what made me really like this place. My favourite things (scallop, spicy tuna and smoked salmon) all in one roll for only about $5!! I really enjoyed this roll and the combination with the classic spicy korean flavors.

I'll explain it since I didn't know what to expect when I arrived. You must walk to the back to stand in line to order your food and drinks. While you are waiting in line someone comes to ask you the number of people in your party and returns later with an assigned table number. Another person comes around to take your order. You pay at the front of the line and proceed to your assigned table. A waiter brings you your food and drinks. I only had the Nutella and chocolate pretzel shake. Oh boy, it was soooo good. Great flavor (house churned ice cream) and yummy crunchy bits.

The second time I ordered delivery it didn't take as long but once the food got there I understood why. My order was completely wrong.....right down to the flavor of chips I ordered. I paid $2.50 for extra turkey on the Cajun turkey panini which I didn't recieve. I also specified no onions and all I wanted on the sandwich was the extra turkey,  extra red pepper sauce, and the cheese. I got a sandwich with onions, a ton of green olives (which don't even come on the sandwich according to the menu), and like I said before, no extra meat that I paid for. I called them back and once I actually got a hold of a manager he says he made the sandwich and definitely put extra meat on.....ok. Then says well they must've put no onions add green olives or visa versa. Doesn't really make sense since it came with both on it and I never even said the words green olives to the girl who took my order. The \\"manager\\" sounded about 18. He said he would correct the situation and send me a correct sandwich with the correct chips since that was wrong also. I am still waiting on this corrected sandwich. Hopefully,  since I've already paid for it, I will get it before I have to go to work.

The Korean BBQ burger was absolutely delicious.  I wish I had ordered two of those rather than 1 of each.  The braised short rib was cooked to medium perfection and was extremely tender.  The kimchee ketchup added a touch of sweetness while the sesame krispies added a nice crunch.  Awesome burger.  The Crab burger was good but not the best.  They definitely gave a good amount of jumbo lump crab in the burger, which I appreciated, but it seemed slightly dry.  However, the brussel slaw and sour apple & mustard seed caviar toppings were awesome complements to the crab.\\n\\nI also tried the parmesan zucchini fries, which were good, but nothing to write home about.  On the other hand, the hand cut french fries - fried and crisped to salty perfection.\\n\\nI topped off the meal with a nutella & burnt marshmallow shake.

It is unassuming, quaint, yet delightfully sophisticated.  The bar, which is separated by a wall as large as Hadrian's wall from the restaurant, smelled a bit of stale beer but I suspect that's from the golfers' overconsumption (at times...)\\n\\nThe restaurant itself has a stunning view of the golf course and a well attentioned and trained staff.  Both the service staff and the manager were trained in giving a table of seven just the correct amount of attention.  \\n\\nThe before appetizer plate is olive bread, cheese bread, and sourdough bread served alongside a nicely done homemade hummus, a made in-house butter, and a selective serving of salsa (that was more resemblent of pico than salsa).   I tried the hummus on the sourdough and the cheese bread.  It was pretty good on both.  I also tried the homemade butter only to give it a whirl.  Tasted like butter, which is a good thing I suppose.  I did not try the \\"salsa\\".  In fact, our party mostly avoided it.\\n\\nWe loaded the table with appetizers before ordering our main course.  We tried a seared tuna with watercress, a portabello mushroom app of some type, and a beef carpaccio.  (Technically, we ordered two of each.)  I found all of the appetizers to be very good.  As a main course, I had the salmon which was in a thai demi glaze and a side of potatoes.  It was also very good.  For dessert, I had the trio of creme brulees (a vanilla bean, a pistachio, and a berry)... all tasty.\\n\\nIt's a short 3.3 mile trip from the Marriott World Center to this restaurant, but I recommend having directions ready for your cab driver (if you have one) because both our cab driver on the way there and on the way back got lost."},{"name":"Orinoco","address":"22 Harvard St","city":"Brookline","stars":"4","text":"Great Arepas, Great Tostones.

I ordered, got my number, was seated, and had my tacos maybe ten minutes later. What more could I ask for? Star Granted. \\n\\nStar 2: How were the portions relative to the cost?\\n\\nSome of my favorite tacos back in Dallas come in just under the $2.00 mark, and my favorite street tacos from Sugar Skull Cafe (http://www.yelp.com/biz/sugar-skull-cafe-dallas) come in at $2.25. Veracruz upsells things a bit by charging $2.00 for breakfast tacos and $2.50 for regular tacos, which, in all honesty, is a bit expensive. Sure, these tacos are sizable as you can see in the pics, but in that I'm not receiving an atmosphere of any kind am I really getting what I've paid for here? After much deliberation, I decided that had Veracruz charged a cent over $2.50 for their street tacos I'd have a real issue, but with the breakfast tacos being only $2.00, that brings the average down to $2.25, which is fine. Star Granted. \\n\\nStars 3 and 4: How was the food?\\n\\nSo I snagged two tacos, and one was good while the other not so much. I'll start with the corn tortillas, which I was a big fan of. The flavor and fact that they were freshly made complimented my first barbacoa taco nicely, and kudos to Veracruz for using generous portions of tasty meats in addition to the standard cilantro and onions. \\n\\nThe breakfast taco on the other hand (sausage and egg) was a real disappointment. The eggs were flavorless and a bit runny while the sausage tasted no different from standard cut up oscar meyer sausage. I won't claim that was actually the case, but this was a weak taco. One good one bad? Single Star Granted. \\n\\nStar 5: Would you eat here every day if you could?\\n\\nVeracruz isn't bad, but in a state where tacos are king, my experience didn't quite live up to the competition. Either a better price point or stronger breakfast tacos (mix it up with some triple ingredient options!) would really do the place some good.

The first basket of injera we received was cold and stiff - obviously not fresh. My friends and I devoured it anyways. The second basket was much better. The injera was not warm, but it was at least soft. Needless to say, we ate all of that basket as well. \\n\\nService was much like it was the first time I came: inattentive and slightly indifferent.

Well while my friends and I are trying to enjoy our meal this guy standing in the line gets right next to our table and starts yelling at the TV....really?  I'm a rabid football fan, I love football...A LOT, but even I know not to yell at the TV in a public place while people are inches away trying to enjoy their meal.  Normally I'd address this behavior personally but our waiter was in the area so I thought it would be best to let him handle this rude customer. \\n\\nI politely motioned our waiter to the table (mind you, the rude fan was still standing uncomfortably close to our table) and asked if he could tell the guy to move along.  Sounds like a reasonable request, especially considering Hopdoddy's strict line rules.

I won't even get into the weird exchange that occurred when someone at my table had to return his food because they served him beef instead of the bison he ordered.

The chicken was well cooked but I am not a fan of the flavors...it was smoky  over some citrus and soy but it came together as almost a petroleum flavor.  The best part of the meal were the vegetables but the portion was very very small.  I'm ok with the fact that I didn't like the chamorro flavor that much...I'm not going to like every regional type of food (although its rare that I don't) but the rice was not good and the price was ridiculous for the plate...$8.75 is very high end for cart food and this was nowhere near the quality to justify the price.

Far be it for me to critique the business model of a very successful establishment, but while such a gimmick seems appropriate for a place like Bukowski's, where food is secondary in importance to God's Golden Nectar, The Parish seems to me to be able to draw customers on the power of their food alone and might better focus on that aspect of their business, particularly when hungry folks have to stand in line while bros pound pints at the bar.\\n\\nFinally, while I've never had a bad experience at The Parish or felt the service underperforming, I too have had the experience of having 5 servers to my table in one visit.

The Parish Cafe is a terrific late night destination where you can nurse your long night out on the town.  \\n\\nThe Hummus Platter appetizer is a decent assortment of bland homemade white bean hummus, feta cheese chunks, marinated olives, and pita slices.  I would skip the appetizers and focus on the deliciously sumptuous sandwiches, a collaborative menu created by some of the area's top chefs.  The Nebo is a large crisp baguette stuffed with Italian-style tuna, which stays miraculously moist without the mayonnaise.  The tuna is topped with an olive tapenade, Mediterranean aioli, lettuce, tomato, sliced eggs and fresh basil.  The sandwich is accompanied with a salad of string beans and tomatoes.  This concoction from the The Pallotta Sisters (executive chefs at Nebo in Boston) was a delicious mixture of textures and flavors.

I really like Punjabi Dhaba in Somerville, but hadn't been able to get some really tasty indian food in the allston/brighton area that matched Punjabi Dhaba's qualities. \\n\\nI ordered vegetable samosas, a garlic naan, and the chili chicken, spicy. It took about 10 minutes to prepare the order, and the staff was quite friendly in my interaction with them. The samosas came with tamarind and onion chutneys, which was nice for take-out, and I got three of them, which easily justified the price, which I think was $3 or so. They were tasty and authentic, not too oily. Delicious, really. The naan was also wonderfully garlicky, and perfectly cooked. The chili chicken was legitimately spicy which was nice. On a scale of 1 to 10 where 10 means nose-bleeding, eyes-watering, sweat dripping of your face, I'd rate this about a 6 on the spicy scale, which is about as hot as I like it before the heat detracts from the flavor. On the flavor note, the chicken was tender and moist, and well-marinated, and the accompanying peppers and onions were nicely matched with the cumin, tomato, and hot pepper flavors of the sauce. Also of note, the basmati rice was well-prepared and had a good saffron content compared to what I usually see.\\n\\nOverall, a delicious dining experience.

Not the instant ones, but the legitimate Ramen noodle at a Ramen shop.  So I signed up for Yelp to search for a good-quality yet low-priced Ramen shop anywhere in Vancouver.  That is when I came across Ramen Danbo.\\n\\nThe waitresses and the cooks (Is that a correct term to use?) welcomed me warmly with an energetic \\"Irrashaimase! („ÅÑ„Çâ„Å£„Åó„ÇÉ„ÅÑ„Åæ„Åõ!)\\" meaning \\"Welcome!\\" and they were very friendly & kind.  If you're Japanese, I'm sure that the 'nostalgia' of Japanese hospitality would hit you hard.  Since the workers are Japanese, it was just so wonderful to be able to speak Japanese even just for a little bit when I ordered.\\n\\nNow, finally on to the food (sorry for the long intro.!).  I got the Classic-style Tonkotsu Ramen with thin noodles and standard firmness.  The thickness of the broth was standard as well, and I decided not to put any lard or spicy sauce.  I also had Gy≈çza because back in Japan, I would always order Ramen AND the dumplings; it's just my ritual.  \\n\\nI personally love my Ramen very simple, so when I was served with my Ramen with just Yakibuta Chashu Porks, noodles and broth, there wasn't even a slice of disappointment in me.  The saltiness and the thickness of the broth balanced out with the thinness and the slightly firm texture of the noodles.  Meaning that one element of the Ramen didn't dominate over another, and I think that's the key to making successful & delicious Ramen.\\nThe size of the Ramen was perfect for me, it wasn't too much or too less, but if you're extra hungry or think that you can eat another load of Ramen, you can order 'Kae-dama (Êõø„ÅàÔøΩ?', which is half or full batch of Ramen noodles that could be added to your remaining broth in the bowl.  \\n\\nIf I am to say one negative thing about this place is that I kinda felt that the Gy≈çza was a little bit garlic-centred.  So perhaps if the Gy≈çza had less garlic-taste, I would've loved it even more - otherwise, the way that the dumplings were fried was just right.\\n\\nOverall, I think Danbo lived up to my expectations, and would 100% go there again.

It also helped that I was there with some notorious Yelpers who actually love and respect delicious food and fantastic restaurants more than I do. Out of the 8 dishes we tried as a group, my favorites were the Scallion Pancakes (winner of the biggest surprise of the evening- had no idea they would be as mouthwatering as they were), the braised pork belly buns (winner of the 'needs no explanation' award) and the panko-crusted lemon chicken (granted anything with lemon and chicken in the title of a dish usually makes it on my 'I will continue picking at this dish until it's taken away' list.)\\n\\nThey call their desserts, \\"Sweet Endings\\"-- I like to call them Happy Endings- because even though they were definitely sweet, Cinderella had no clue that these desserts would be more delicious than a night with her prince. We decided to order desserts off different ends of the dessert scale (also because Simona S. insisted she only liked creamy desserts). The \\"ancient chinese secret\\" chocolate mousse with homemade 5-spice marshmallows was served in a mug and made a non-believer of Chocolate Mousse say Hallelujah, and the 'I'm not going to love the 'frozen vanilla bean parfait, fresh orange granita' became a lover of all things that taste like orange creamsicles. Lesson of the evening? Don't skip dessert at Myers + Chang. \\n\\nThe service was great- and I love the fact they have Asian beers.

The pizza is made differently. They put the toppings under the cheese. The bottom of the pizza has a nice texture with cornmeal I believe. \\n\\nThe inside of the restaurant has that dated charm.

The menu sounded pretty fantastic, and we were sure to go into food coma soon. My wife selected the three piece chicken (with the idea I would likely steal some) and two sides. I opted for the chicken and dumplings with sides as well. She had mac and cheese and mash potatoes. I opted for the grits and bread pudding. The bread pudding was easily the gem of the sides, with the straight up sugar Krispy Creme frosting. \\n\\nThe chicken was good, but not great. It did not have the crisp that you would expect, and the seasonings were not something we were expecting. They were not necessarily bad, just not our favorite. The dumplings were ok. They had plenty of dumplings (pretty light, not much flavor), and not too much chicken at all. The dish itself was not as filling as anticipated, but it was really fine with me. I must stress that the place is not horrible, it just does not live up to the hype of it's big brother.

Supermarket style syrup was on the table but I got the \\"pure\\" maple syrup. It was a fairly large portion (probably 4 ounces) and didn't end up using more than about half. I guess if two people were using it that would be fine but $2 for wasting half seemed, well, wasteful.

Then when the food came out, everything did not come out together (2 meals, while the other people in the party continued to wait for food, one came 10 minutes after the first round, and the last order came a whopping 15 minutes after the first round). To add insult to injury, all of the food was delivered to the table like warm like it had been cooked and forgotten under the warmers. The managers were less than apologetic, often explaining that the kitchen was \\"swamped\\" which is why the wait was so long (which is not a reasonable explanation for the food temp and the delayed delivery of meals).

To eat with my tacos. So... where are my tacos?\\nHer: (in Spanish) yelling at cooks that that they misunderstood the order and to make me said tacos\\nMe: Ok i guess i come back in?\\nHer: Ignoring me.\\nMe: Standing there like a moron. \\n\\nThis whole exchange literally stopped the ordering in its tracks. Everyone was staring, the lady was obviously exasperated and I almost felt like busting out my relatively decent spanish to clarify the situation but then didn't want to be that girl anymore than I already was. \\n\\nAfter the fiasco, we finally get tacos that were tasteless, wildly egg heavy and weirdly watery.

My wife and I needed food first so we arrived early to grab some dinner. Chips and salsa were fine, our meals were typical but not wonderfully flavorful (enchiladas and beef tacos). I'm vegetarian and finding that there was no mention of a veggie burger option or veggie options for the enchiladas, tacos, burritos, fajitas, etc, I assumed I could get them and luckily was able to. Our Jo Mo (flavored mojitos) were fine and decently priced as well. Our waitress was very nice and given where this review is going, I feel the need to give her at least one prop. The major problems were the bathrooms and then the atmosphere when we got upstairs. The girls bathroom on the first floor was gross, wet, covered in barf (about 10:30pm), both toilets rocked back and forth, the smaller stall forced my knees to knock against the trash barrel, no mirror, the hand blower didn't work, no hooks on the back of the doors, and the legally required sign for the staff to wash their hands was a sticker that had been partially scraped off. At least there were grab bars in the accessible stall. As for upstairs bathroom, the woman's bathroom wasn't labeled as a bathroom, and again was wet and gross. Since we had arrived earlier than the normal Friday night out we were treated to a full viewing of the upstairs. The furniture was shoddy, old, mismatched, and looked like the owners had visited Allston on September 1st (Allston Christmas!) to find tables, chairs, and couches. The place was drab and boring and showed obvious signs that no one really cared what it looked like. Half the flooring was concrete and the other half was almost fully painted black plywood. As the night continued the music got notably louder and louder to the point that you had to scream into someones ear to be heard. At least the music was ok but there were a few times people remarked that they couldn't figure out why a particular song was being played at a club.

Sadly, this was our second choice but the line at the other place was pretty outrageous. \\n\\nWe were greeted with the warmest smiles and told the wait would only be about 15 minutes. They lied, but for the better. They asked if we cared for any drinks while we waited. My girlfriend likes her sweet wines so she asked if they had something she would enjoy. The host instantly smiled and said I know what you want. He comes back with a bottle of Mariposa and pours her some. She smiles wide and I know this is already a place that can easily read their customers.\\n\\nWe were seated in 10 minutes (BOOM the lie) and given some bread. This my friends is probably some of the best bread I have ever had in my life. I didn't want olive oil or anything with it. It was the perfect temperature, moistness, and flavor. I don't even know how to describe the medley that was in my mouth.  Next on our plate was the fried mushrooms with truffle salt.  Holy moly. For our main course, we had the pan seared salmon and the scallops with risotto. Both dishes were excellent and did not leave me feeling groggy and completely disgusted with myself.

They were out of kids bread so the first guy just cut bread down to a 4inch size. No biggie there. But then comes in worker #2. It took forever to even get 2.5 sandwiches done. The 2nd guy says he knows it is only 4 inches but because the other guy used chicken he has to charge me for a 6 inch. I said that isn't right. He argued with me and said that he has to because there are no buttons to push for what the other guy made for us. I said that if anything they should error on the lower cost and he said he couldn't because there wasn't a button! Then I said it is about customer service. He repeated he can't do anything and insisted I pay the price for a 6 inch even though that isn't what I had. There was no offer to remake it or anything to make it right. By that time we were late and no longer had time to eat it there. We were not asked about drinks or anything. I asked him for his name as he had no name tag. He refused to tell me his name so I told him that if he doesn't tell me his name I am taking his picture. Major disappointment as it was my daughters bday and she chose there for dinner! Ended up going down the street to McDonald's to get our drinks. I will add that 3-4 customers heard the interaction and left before they ordered. I felt bad for the First worker as he was nice and had a great attitude. We will NEVER go back again. Hopefully, the owner will see his photo and recognize him so he can get the training he needs.

It really made it unpleasant to eat. The shrimp are pretty small and flavorless on their own. The lunch portion is small and I didn't bother finishing because of all of the grease. Normally I take leftovers but I can only imagine how much more it would separate when reheated. My boyfriend loves fried clams and got those and he likes them but feels like places like Theos on Curry Ford have better clams. \\n\\nThe service was just okay. Not great, not terrible. I just feel for the prices Red Lobster is not worth it. I used to like them so I am not sure if my tastes have changed or if the quality has gone downhill but I would not be keen on returning."},{"name":"BJ's Restaurant & Brewhouse","address":"10515 N Mopac Expy","city":"Austin","stars":"3","text":"This review is not about the food because the food was alright (the Spinach Dip is sub par) and my so called Buffalo Chicken deep dish pizza was tasty (this is no Chicago style deep dish) but the service.\\n\\nI went with my parents as they invited my sister and I to dinner with their friends. We had to wait 45 minutes on a Saturday. That was fine because we waited at the bar. Basically this is one of the best restaurant selections of beer on tap. From the local beers of Shiner, Fireman's 4, Real Ale, and foreign brews such as Newcastle, Guinness, Stella Artois, and many German selections. I got the Stella and to me it was over priced by $1.50.\\n\\nWe sat at our table and our waiter was friendly but the kitchen was terrible that night. My father and mother's dinner was not made and was confused for another table. In addition my father's chicken fried steak hardly had any gravy so when he asked for me it took more than 5 minutes to get it. In addition my mother got a pork slider sandwich and they sent out a plate of the item than the sandwiches. She sent it back and got the same damn thing. Our waiter told us that they were doing training of the cooks. This is hard to believe and a bad excuse because what manager in their right mind would be training cooks on a Saturday Night! \\n\\nThis restaurant is like many others in the category of a brew pub with many franchises focusing on the atmosphere than their food and service.

Every time I've driven by on the way to work the line has been so long and I'd read reviews that mentioned 45 minute wait times! Not going to lie, this dissuaded me a bit.

But, when we got there we were able to walk right up and order. We were told that our wait time was about half an hour, but it ended up being just over 10 minutes. I ordered the migas and the al pastor. From what I'd heard the migas was what they were so famous for and al pastor is a go to for me. I honestly have never understood the notion of putting tortilla chips on a taco but wow that migas was amazing! And the al pastor was one of the best I've had! And I feel like I can say this confidently since I order it every time it's available!\\n\\nI'll definitely be back to try more of their tacos and maybe a smoothie as well!

There was a hipster dude behind the counter, who seemed uninterested in serving, and replied all my requests with only one word. They were out of Croissants, so I ordered $10 worth of their overpriced drinks and pastries, and sat down to complete some work on my laptop. I was focused on my work, and after a while I noticed the shop is empty and they are cleaning up. Checking their website to make sure that I did not get their hours wrong, but I saw they should close at 9:00. Confused, I asked them are you closing or something ? The hipster dude replied yes, we have a staff meeting and we are already closed at 5:30. I was like, couldn't you tell me that you are closing when I ordered bunch of items ? Where should I go now with these stuff ? I even asked them about the WiFi so they knew I am going to sit down and work there ! These guys have bad attitude and unless you are a hipster with tattoos all over your body you are not welcome there. Due to their lack of responsibility, I had to throw my pastries away, and grab my tea and sit in rain for while to catch a bus and go back to downtown.

We ain't that ugly...I hope. We ask for better seats and they say everything is pretty much reserved...but we also had reservations...it's so far back hear one patron mentions he's going to get claustrophobic, and we note he doesn't say a word the rest of the night. But, whatever that's fine it's just a table.Our waitress is very nice, explains the specials, takes the wine order and that's when it goes off the rails.

The appies (oysters) come nicely chilled with condiments but no spoon to add the condiments to the oysters. We finger it out.\\n\\nMains come, wife's looks good, mine is incased in salt. They break it open and it falls apart. I take one bite and age 3 years due to salt intake. Waitress is very nice and takes it away leaving me with the rice...which is hard...and missing the scallops it was supposed to have. Wife notes that the rice tastes like the rice left over the next day in the rice cooker. She is nothing if not astute. Waitress says she'll be getting us wine to make up for it....which comes 20 minutes later. In time a floor manager walks by, looks at our empty glasses and keeps on a'walkin.\\n\\nWife bites into halibut, perfectly cooked and terribly bland. She eats slow (rare for her) to wait for my meal, but needs more sauce to make it even worthwhile. The good manager comes back sets up a rack to place the serving tray on (they crack open the seabass at the table, it's quite the production), another waiter takes away the rack, so when the manager brings my replacement meal there is nowhere to place it. We die laughing.\\n\\nSo the wife is done eating, when they crack open my seabass, which everyone looks amazingly at. And honestly it does taste fantastic when not tasting like a  salt-mine. Meanwhile the place has filled up and Tony Soprano at the table of 12 next to us yells at his 70yr old mother telling her to \\"shut the f**k up, it's my f**kn night\\" she gets up to leave just as the floor manager (the one who ignored our empty glasses) asks \\"how's the party goin!!\\".

Unripe frozen vegetables.  \\nSo why the hell did I give it three stars and not one or two?  The fried rice with tofu was awesome and the dumplings were stuffed with meat.

Our server was cool though she could've been a little more attentive. \\n\\nI ordered the fusion specialty bento box ($16.50) due to my love of both sea and land animals. This comes out on what resembled a cafeteria tray. I was impressed by the volume of veggies: Thai cucumbers (cukes in a vinegar dressing), sweet potato fries, and a pile of edamame. The sweet potato fries could've been crunchier and less limp, but I ate them all anyway since they weren't bad otherwise, with the right amount of salt.  \\n\\nBesides the vegetables, this particular bento box also comes with the mini-burger of the week and your choice of roll: blackened tuna, tempura shrimp, firecracker, or Mark's. I selected the firecracker roll which was \\"shrimp tempura, kani inside coated with tempura flakes, topped with yellowtail, salmon, spicy mayo, masago, tobiko and scallions.\\" I received four pieces.

The menu online had added to my curiosity after having walked past it twice, seeing it full each time. The Scorpion Bowl started us off (and finished us off, actually) while we waited for a seat. It's a juicy coconut rum drink that was about 46 ounces and $18 but worth it. The bartender was very attentive as was the manager who made us feel welcome despite our faux pas of not having a reservation. Here's my take on the food:\\nIf you like spicy, you must try the housemade Sriracha sauce. Drink lots of water. It is superb and hotter than the store version. \\nThe dumplings with soy beans, mustard greens, and wasabi were indescribably good. The wasabi didn't overpower the rest of the ingredients, rather it accented the greens and soy in perfect balance.\\n\\nThis is a fusion restaurant and the best example from what we ordered was the Clams in Fermented Black Bean sauce over rice vermicelli. Nine good-sized clams saut√©ed with the black bean sauce, noodles, and watercress ($16). Some chefs throw fusion dishes together based on cool sounding combinations or trendy ingredients forced together, but these dishes work. I made sure each mouthful had a clam, some rice noodles, crisp, peppery watercress, and sauce. It could not be improved upon. \\nThe eggplant hakka was the only thing that needed any more seasoning; more garlic and salt, I imagine. The Sriracha sauce picked that up nicely.\\nThe cook line, where we sat, was interesting to watch. Four people cook under a twelve(ish) foot hood and have to pass the finished plates one to another to get it to the end cook, who was the executive chef. I guess you could call it a \\"shot-gun line\\" as opposed to the standard set-up with the chef expediting on the other side. I've noticed that many Boston restaurants have to adapt to unconventional spaces. Nonetheless, they handled it well. I also liked that they send the food out when it's ready, calling it \\"family style\\". Diners don't realize it but most times when one meal is great and another at the same table is dry, overcooked, or wilted is due to it sitting under a warming lamp waiting for the rest of the order. The food is best served when it leaves the flame.\\nOne snafu was that our leftovers were thrown out by accident. The manager handled it well, offering another whole order to take out or to discount the dish from the check. He solved the problem in two seconds and kept us happy. The manager was hands-on, always visible, and engaging with the customers.\\nM and C is a good example of how independents add greater depth to the culinary culture of a community than do chain restaurants.

What a disappointment! My friends and I tried the weekend lunch buffet and found that same creamy sauce was used in three out of six main course dishes. As an Indian and I can assure you that the same creamy sauce does not fill all of our dishes. In fact, cream is used in very selective dishes that are meant to creamy. The dahi bhalla (dahi vada) had not been thawed (yes it was FROZEN) prior to serving. I'm all for fusion cuisine but to serve a kadai tofu dish instead of kadai paneer is cheating. The same sauce was used for the malai kofta, kadai tofu and chicken tikka masala and they are NOT supposed to taste the same. The chicken pieces in the chicken tikka masala were boneless but hard to chew. While I give them credit for having some authentic dishes (chole with the bhature), very soft fresh naan and some sublime gulab jamun, overall I came out very disappointed with the eating experience.

I have heard mixed reviews about this place for some time now, ranging from the usual \\"Meh, you have to enjoy trendy spots\\" to \\"wow, you HAVE to go there NO MATTER WHAT!\\"  - not a whole lot of inbetween, really, which usually means that I inevitably fall in the middle, alone...left to fend for myself with naught but my wits and charm to guide me...much like that plucky kid from Gary Paulsen's \\"Hatchet.\\"\\n\\nWow, ok, less personalization, more fact:  this place really does deserve its positive hype - right when I walked in I felt at home, completely at ease in a chill environment in a great neighborhood that I now HAVE to move to...maybe it was the way the sun was beginning its langorous descent into night at around 3:45pm today, or it was the soft music and dulcet calm voice of the staff...or a magical Southern Cross of all of these, but I just melted into my seat.  \\n\\nThen, after a careful examination of the menu, the waiter was there, perfectly timed for my order.  I had the soup of the day (tomato and basil) with the \\"Richard Braughtin\\" crepes.  (I love the addition of author names to the menu, naming their different unique dishes...very cool!)  Within moments, my soup was at my side, and as soon as that first spoonful hit my tongue - WOW.\\n\\nThe soup alone deserves an aside - this was easily the best tomato soup I have ever had - not too thick, not too thin, with the most subtle of basil accents to set off the taste in perfect harmony with the less basic flavor of tomato and the other spices used - balance like that is extremely difficult to achieve in a soup, and the chef at the Press Club earns high marks for exceeding even my extremely lofty expectations!  Not only that, but the presentation was immaculate, with a wonderfully large \\"cup\\" (it could have been a bowl!) placed on a square blue plate and dusted with fresh basil.  Atop the bowl, criss-crossed like swords over a mantleplace were two zesty flatbread sticks that seemed almost to be infused with some cheese.  These were the perfect compliment to the soup, and for $4 was one of the best investments I have ever made in an appetizer!\\n\\nSo what about my Richard Braughtin? (read: salmon, shallots, spinach crepes drizzled with fresh creme)  \\n\\nOne word: fan-freaking-tastic.  I have yet to find crepes of their equal, being light and airy, yet easy to cut and almost buttery in taste - they stand out even among the more outspoken flavors in the mix.  The salmon, generously stuffed within, could not have been more fresh, and like the soup, showcases the chef's ability to balance savory and sweet.  Excellent, excellent meal all around.  If it were a bit closer to my work, I imagine I would be at the Press Club for this set every day!\\n\\nI must also give a nod to the service - as you can already tell from my gushing praise, it was nothing short of outstanding.  Attentive, calm, and willing to accomodate (even my \\"I'll just have water...on second thought, I'll have the Earl Grey!\\") without missing a beat or brushing you off, these guys deserve serious recognition.  They helped to create the overall atmosphere that made this such a memorable experience, and I thank them heartily for it!\\n\\nAt last, an excellent standard for lunch in PDX!

I had the fried chicken and she had the chicken pot pie, which she said was very good.  The fried chicken was flavorful and moist but was deep fried.  In my opinion \\"real\\" southern fried chicken is prepared in a skillet, but that does not lend itself well to the quantity required for a restaurant and, more importantly, requires an experienced person to prepare it well.  Where the Coop shines, in my opinion, is in the sides.  In Southern cuisine, more so than in many others, sides make the meal.  We tried the deviled eggs (a little too much onion), carrots (excellent), bread pudding (really, really good), mac and cheese (a little loose and bland), collard greens (could use some heat, pepper vinegar is available), and fried okra (very well done).  While far from what I grew up eating at my Georgia born and raised great grandmother's house, the Coop would suffice in a pinch.

I didn't watch that season of Top Chef, but the theme of this restaurant seemed too good to pass up. I went for lunch on a Friday and there was already a wait at 11:30 am. My friend and I were seated at the small bar in front of the kitchen window where they plate all of the food. I totally recommend this location. It seemed like the best spot in the restaurant. The chef plated the food right before us and it was cool to see the atmosphere in the kitchen. \\n\\nTo start, my friend and I both got the nutella milkshake with burnt marshmellows on top. It was amazing! You need to try it. We saw a lot of people ordering the absinthe milkshake and while it looked cool, I am not sure how that would taste... \\n\\nFor the main course, I had the rBQ burger with brisket and coleslaw and rBQ sauce. It was delicious. The burger was perfectly cooked and the toppings were a great complement. If I had one complaint, it would be the bun being too greasy. Other than that, everything was fine. I also had the sweet potato tots which were a perfect side. My friend got the corned beef burger which had a fried egg on top. Sorta weird, but delicious. The crispy rutabagas on the side were awesome too. \\n\\nThe food took forever to come out it seemed, but the place was packed. The chef plating the food was entertaining to watch and very friendly. He asked how we were doing and if we had been to the restaurant before. The server was also very pleasant, so overall, the service was pretty good. \\n\\nParking is pretty limited, but you can park on the street next to the restaurant. The meal cost about 30 something dollars between the two of us and that's a little pricey, but definitely worth it. The portions were a good size, so you don't leave feeling too full. \\n\\nGood thing I live like three miles away because I will be a frequent diner at FLIP.

Mac &Cheese and creamed Corn are both on point.\\n-Cool decor. Rustic but not really cheesy-you don't feel like you're eating in a Cracker Barrel. It really does have an old southern vibe. \\n-THE SYRUP. I got the chicken and waffles. It's not the fake, overly buttery junk you get in a plastic container. It really taste like maple and bourbon. Goes perfect over the waffles and chicken together. \\n-Prices are totally reasonable for the amount of food you get. You'll leave stuffed. \\n\\nCons:\\n-Chicken was honestly kind of a downer. I'm not saying this to trash the business. They have a lot going for them within the menu, but considering this was their signature item I had high hopes. Maybe I caught them on an off day, but it was kind of like publix fried chicken that had been under a heat lamp for a little while, with less seasoning. The meat on the inside is perfectly cooked, but it's somewhat bland and the batter is not very crisp. I understand there's a simplicity to good fried chicken.I wasn't looking for some fancy, new age,chicken tenders-it just honestly fell short in my opinion. \\n-Staff seemed a little flustered and confused. Maybe they were new. \\n-It was pretty humid/muggy in here. I imagine there's a lot of the brunch/hungover crowd here on weekends. Maybe turn the AC up. \\n\\nOverall: \\nWorth the stop, but I wasn't very impressed with both the chicken tenders and the bone-in fried chicken. Maybe ask for some fresh chicken when you come in?

The man at the front replied it's the same in any section and he would have someone right over to my table . Another 10 minutes went by so we left.

When I was a kid in middle school, I lived right across from Cafe Destino. My mom and I would walk over on Saturday mornings and enjoy warm rich coffee, fluffy fresh pastries, and the best panini I've ever had. The cafe always had a decent crowd filling the place and there were fun books and toys to occupy the kids.\\n\\nBut today, on a whim, I returned to Destino. I hadn't been there in at least two years and I wasn't even sure if it would still be there, but I was craving the good food from my child hood. Cafe Destino was still there but it was lacking in everything that I had once known. The cafe was sorely empty, with only two other customers there. Of the two employees I could see, one looked angry and annoyed, and the other looked spacey and completely out of it. \\n\\nThe menu of delectable panini's, and other breakfast treats had been changed. Everything i'd used to love was gone from the menu. I still held out hope though, and ordered a sandwich called The Olive that sounded very similar to a panini I used to eat there. I also bought a side of the house salad then considered buying a pastry to finish things off. The pastries looked old and stale, but I was still going to pick one when I realized that from the other side of the display case there was no door or anything to protect the pastries. I was horrified to observe two big fat flies buzz into the case and crawl on the pastries at their leisure. To say the least, I did not buy one. But I did buy a quiche because they were kept in a sealed fridge unit. \\n\\n*big sigh* the food was... Lack luster. Boring. Tasteless. Uninspired. It was a crappy cold sandwich I could have gotten in better quality at subway, with the exception of the olive tapenade spread which was decent but still not great. The Focaccia bread they used for the sandwich was dry and hard to chew. The feta tasted old and fell right out of my sandwich so fast and easy there was basically no point to having it in there. The quiche I ordered was reheated in a freaking microwave! (Why not use an oven I ask you?!)  it was served to me burning hot in some places and ice cold in others. And finally the salad I ordered was completely forgotten. I had to remind an employee about it, then when I did get it, it was not even worth the wait. \\n\\nIf anyone at Cafe Destino reads this, please know that it kills me to write this review. I loved you guys! I'm still rooting for you. I hope you improve. But it will be a very long time before I consider going to your restaurant.

Gustare means to taste, and when you do something with Gusto it means \\"with hearty delight\\". \\n\\nWe discussed favorite Italian cities, transformative Italian experiences. We split an Italian bottle of red that had the word Joy in it, in Italian. Yes, all of the makings for a perfect Italian evening. Lucca, San Gimignano, Florence, Rome... this was our conversation and some -much of it- was in Italian. Italo Calvino would have been proud.\\n\\nMaybe it was just too much pressure.\\n\\nI will say that the Beet Salad and the Polenta Fries were the best two parts of the meal and both worth repeating, along with the wine and the conversation.\\n\\nMinestrone Soup seemed to be missing something.  A tad oily, just not memorable.\\n\\nChicken Saltimbocca was very dry, disappointing. We each had it and we each said it. Separately, without provocation.  \\n\\nWines seemed reasonably priced and we split a bottle of the Terre di Gioia from Friuli, Italy which, at $34 seemed just right.  We bought a bottle, it was sitting on the table.  Our waiter filled our wine glasses almost to the top. The bottle was on the table. These were large wine glasses- you know- those really big ones.  Filling 2 glasses left almost one more glassful remaining in our bottle.  That seemed strange. \\n\\nNot meaning to nitpick, but holding a glass of wine that feels like it weighs a couple pounds, like, holding almost a half a bottle of wine in your hand, just felt weird.  When we had drunk down to about half of the glass - which is where i would have thought it would have been poured from the start - he returned and tried to reFILL our glasses.  \\n\\nNOW, i would be the last person to reprimand a waiter for bringing me A glass that was full, I LOVE IT WHEN LIFE IS completely FULL, but when we pay for the bottle, it is sitting on the table, please know something about filling glasses of wine. This was a minor, detailed complaint, and one that I am sure will alter as the restaurant ages.  \\n\\nUnlike the filled wine glasses, the serving sizes were not enthusiastic for the prices, but maybe that is what we get for arriving at the end of a Saturday evening.  Music was on the Michael Jackson mix which was fun, but did not help to enhance the Italia theme at all or at least not like Antonello Venditti would have, but music can be such a personal gripe.

Certainly not a vegan but most definitely a fan of naturalistic/trans-fat-free/whole wheat bakeries such as Chicago's Bleeding Heart and New York's Babycakes I went in with big expectations.  A quaint shop tucked in a little shopping center on High I'd have most certainly driven by if I hadn't been looking - and if it hadn't been for the cute signage of Adam Brouillette (a great local artist who I'm proud to own a couple pieces from.)\\n\\nWalking in the door I was immediately struck by strong scents of Banana, Cinnamon, and Vanilla and surprised by the entirely-too-small shop that already contained 6 other shoppers.  Cookies, cakes, bars, muffins and more greeted my eyes and while the pricetags certainly didn't scream \\"cheap\\" they also didn't seem out of line for the size and quality of the goods.  Watching others make selections and snapping a few pictures I decided I'd get one muffin and one cupcake and make my way to the street to eat - asking the wonderfully friendly clerk what she suggested I was told I couldn't miss the blueberry muffin so I opted for that and a chocolate cupcake.\\n\\nBeginning with the muffin, entitled \\"Marry Me Blueberry,\\"  I was first impressed by the sheer density of the item - if I had to guess, more than 8 ounces.  My next impression was the smell - heavy on cinnamon and vanilla but clearly buttery in tone.  Finally, the taste - simply amazing and quite possibly the best blueberry muffin I've ever had, vegan or not.  Rich and juicy blueberries, buttery and salty crumb topping, great texture and well balanced throughout.\\n\\nMoving next to the cupcake I must admit I was a little disappointed that Pattycake didn't do a Red Velvet - I've been looking for a beet-sweetened Red Velvet for quite some time - no big deal though, chocolate will always suffice.  As hefty as the muffin and strongly scented with cocoa and perhaps a bit of vinegar there wasn't a whole lot of nuance to the cupcake, just a whole heckuva lot of flavor.  Deep, dark, moist, potent, and delicious - without a shadow of a doubt the best cupcake I've experienced in Columbus and on par with Kara's in San Francisco for best \\"pure-chocolate\\" cupcake to grace my palate.\\n\\nI always get a tad annoyed when people act like \\"organic\\" or \\"whole wheat\\" means something isn't as good as the white-bread version - especially since I pride myself on often baking all-organic or natural muffins and cupcakes.  With that said, I must admit that on the whole I've frequently found vegan baked goods to be rather boring and bland - something that Pattycake most certainly is not.  All told, while I certainly don't see myself becoming vegan anytime soon, I certainly do see myself coming back to Pattycake again - like Dragonfly, this place proves that with the right skills, a lot of dedication,  and great ingredients one can make wonderful food without buying into America's inFATuation with all that is  processed and rendered."},{"name":"Sea Level Oyster Bar","address":"94 Wharf St","city":"Salem","stars":"4","text":"Grabbed lunch here while on a day trip to Salem with an out of town guest.

The food were mostly \\"German\\" foods sold at a premium which is to be expected. The merchandise section has Christmas ornaments, soaps, knited clothing/accessories, jewelry, wooden trinkets and pens. \\n\\nI tried the traditional mulled wine ($6) which is served as a hot beverage.  The lady who served it said that the traditional one was less sweet than the cherry or apple flavour.  It smelled and tasted strongly like red wine. It tasted alright for the first few sips but then it started to taste like chinese herbal medicine. Blech! I could only drink half of my cup before I poured the rest down the drain.  I think I should of gone with the sweeter option but maybe it's just my taste buds.  I ended up keeping the collectable dark blue mug because it was cute and it is the perfect size for drinking coffee.\\n\\nAdvice: Buy your tickets on groupon or social shopper.  I think it is $12 for 2 adult admission and 2 carousel rides; $20 for 2 adult admission, 2 rides, and 2 mugs+cider. At the door, it is $7 and that is only for 1 adult admission. Bring cash if you want to buy food since most of the stands seemed to accept only cash. \\n\\nLastly, the carousel ride is literally a merry go round.

My roommate owed me a meal, so we went during the hottest time of the day in \\"feels like 108\\" weather for a late lunch. It was worth it. The braised pork meal here is genuinely one of the best Chinese/Taiwanese street foods that I've had, and that's including the various similar options in Houston's expansive Chinatown. For $7, you get a layer of rice, a boiled tea egg, a layer of stir-fried cabbage, AND some of the most homey braised pork you'll ever eat. The sauce from the pork drenches the rice immediately, so you're going to want to eat it ASAP for the best experience. I genuinely want to go back tomorrow for another one.\\n\\nYou know, I thought Don (now located in the same trailer park) gave you a lot of bang for your buck, but I was somehow able to make a snack out of the leftovers from Song La.

I had been to the trailer once a few months ago actually. I tried the fried chicken bento box last time around and wasn't very impressed.

We were urged immediately to empty one small plate to make room for the other small plates. Chaotic meal and very unsatisfying.  At the conclusion, we were not presented with a bill. My husband put his credit card down and the server took it and brought back the charge receipt. We then asked for a bill and the server returned with a checklist with numerous dollar amounts but no corresponding menu items.

Richard Blais is the Top Chef 'All Stars' winner and the owner of this modern shabby chic burger boutique.  \\n\\nThe ambiance of Flip away from the bussing streets of Downtown Atlanta seemed like a world away from where this burger boutique is situated, dark surroundings with nearly no cars on the street and a liquor store across.  \\n\\nSide note...I was a little scared to try this burger because it might be better than Umami (which is 10 mins. from where I reside here in CA)... \\nThe bf and I got there at around 9pm, the place was packed but it didn't take long for us to get seated.  The place was dim with comfortable booths, high tables and chairs.  Equipped with a full bar, Flip also had a spacious bar seating.  The kitchen is visible to the patrons alongside a big colorful mural on the wall. \\n\\n The menu was very impressive for simply being a burger boutique.  Too many things to choose from, we couldn't decide...our really nice waiter helped us decide.\\n\\nWhile contemplating on what to get, I decided to order the FOIE GRAS MILKSHAKE! (What? Liver milkshake? Only a top chef can pull this off!)  This is not usual of me to order things as such but I trusted the Top Chef and I'm so glad I did.  This tasted like butter pecan milkshake.  Seriously, it was that good.  Sipping into that COLD shake, I can hardly taste that liver flavor but as the drink warms up, the subtle liver flavors become more apparent.  Regardless, this was so delicious!\\n\\nBlackened shrimp po boy-w/ cajunnaise, sweet and sour tomato, cabbage, FRIED LEMON, and hot sauce...does this not sound delectable already?  Cajun mayonnaise, I loved it! The burger was served in a slightly heavy bun; the shrimp was cooked to perfection.  The burger was not overwhelming with the sauce; it was a perfect serving as well.  You can actually eat big pieces of shrimp in the burger, it was tasty and a very nice change from the more common fried shrimp in a burger.  The combination of the ten thousand layers of flavor with a fried lemon addition, I cannot speak less of this burger.  AMAZING!  \\n\\nButcher's cut-w/ caramelized onion, bleu cheese, red wine jam.  This is one of their best sellers so we just had to try it.  The meat itself was good, not great.  The patty was thin and too lean but the bleu cheese and red wine jam was such a nice compliment to the burger patty.  It was very different, had I not read the menu beforehand, it would've been hard to guess that it had red wine jam.  The mixture of flavors added really nice flavors to the burger; the bleu cheese was smooth and the caramelized onion tasted not-so-common.  It's a modern take on a classic bleu cheese burger.  My only complaint would be the patty being too lean. \\n\\nHow can one speak less of a top chef winner right?! .......\\n\\nThe sides. Originally we ordered the vodka battered onion rings but got the fried pickles, we didn't complain to switch it back because we were so happy they made this mistake.  Fried pickles were excellent.  It's like what the hooters' fried pickles is supposed and intended to taste like.  Yeap, hooter's fried pickles does not taste good at all after eating Flip's fried pickles.  The pickles were coated in a crunchy batter (tempura maybe?) but the best part is that the pickles itself were crunchy.  It's like a layer of crunch after another. YUM!  Another thing we loved is the fried okra. This was unforgettable, one of the best parts of the Atlanta trip.  As you bite into that fried okra, the crunchy outside very well complements the soft and buttery inside of the okra. What you think is the best okra isn't...because this is THE BEST fried okra ever, I can still taste it. Haha.\\n\\nFlip has the most innovative menu I've seen for a burger bar; it was a pleasant surprise after another.  I would definitely recommend this burger spot for locals and visitors alike.  On our quest to find THE best burger spot, this one came very very very close.  I'm torn, 4 or 5 stars?  The sides were a 10 on a 1-5 scale, the shrimp burger was a 5, and the beef burger was a 4.  Service was 5, ambiance was 5.\\n\\nIf only I can take those sides and convince Umami to sell it..\\n\\nBut for best burgers overall, Umami, you're still my number one..."},{"name":"Yalla","address":"99 Krog St NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"They are located inside a booth at Krog Street Market.

I ordered the Flip Burger and the sweet potato tater tots.  I must say that the food was superb.  Just great.  Really really enjoyed it, and would definitely have it again.\\n\\nSo, why the 2 stars?  The two stars is due to a service issue.\\n\\nI ordered iced tea to drink.  I took a sip, and all was good...well, until I looked down and there was a giant gnat floating in the top.  I got the attention of a server (not a primary server), and they took it away and brought me a new one.  However, that was it.\\n\\nMy personal opinion is that, if you serve an item that is tainted by something like a bug, or hair, the item should be immediately replaced, and comp'ed (mainly b/c the \\"nastiness\\" isn't really cleaned up by the replacement, and bugs in food is unacceptable).  When our main server came back, I mentioned what happened, and he really shrugged it off.  To quote him, \\"yeah, with the sugar and all they are attracted to the stuff.\\"  We were eating inside, and the tea is unsweetened, so no real excuse.  He then walked away, and came back with a full price check for the lunch.  That pissed me off.

Very pricey for food ( 11.50 for a wrap and 13 for just a plate ) but that is to be expected at these types of events, however if you are looking for a vendor to really rub you the wrong way then this is your place.\\n\\nAfter we ordered our very expensive items we had a small request of hot sauce on the side ( we offered to pay extra as we were greeted with a NO straight away ) I asked why and they explained they had none, this was when it turned for the bad, considering I could see 2 FULL bottle's sitting on the side I mentioned that they had some but still refused to give me any. Seriously, are you kidding me, I can see it right there in view and you are telling me I am not even allowed to pay to have some on the side?? That is correct. My mate had the request of paying extra to have some gravy put on the wrap he ordered, not a chance I told him, I was right, even with the extra money offer.\\n\\nI ask myself, what is with this vendor, you are at a Christmas markets on a gorgeous non rainy Sunday night making money ( alot of it considering you are robbing us blind with the price for a dry wrap ) you have a chance to cook your countries food for others to try, you have live music and happy children around and this can not bring a smile to your face and even do that little extra to please the customer who is keeping your stall open??\\n\\nWord of warning, stay away from DAS SCHNITZEL HAUS, waste of time and money. If you love bad attitudes to ruin your evening then this is the place to be. I dare you to ask for hot sauce, I DARE YOU, and if you can get it then I will personally buy you nothing but clap you for going head to head with this vendor. Good luck\\n\\nAlso, what is with the tree only being half decorated?? hang on its not even half done its like quarter, if you are charging 6$ a person at least have the decency to decorate the tree properly.\\n\\nOverall it's not that bad, I just expect more considering its the only Christmas markets we have downtown, should have some more time money and effort put into it."},{"name":"Maenam","address":"1938 W 4th Avenue","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4","text":"Been wanting to try this resto for a long time and I finally got the chance!

So, that was where my expectations start with eating at this location. We ate there on Friday just after 5pm. There was plenty of parking, big parking lot. There was a nice selection of sides. I chose the mexican rice, potato salad and pinto beans. Next we moved on to the meat selections. I chose one pork rib, two slices of brisket and a link of original sausage. Unfortunately I was disappointed. My first bite of the brisket was the brisket was warm not hot. The brisket was not hot in temperature. How do you not serve BBQ hot? The pork rib had a pepper smoke flavor and it was good. Would have been better if it was hot, not warm. My favorite was the original sausage. It was heavy on the pepper and other spices and I will be back just for the original sausage. It would have been better hot instead of warm. Getting back to the brisket, it was better than average but had the least amount of flavor of the 3 meats I chose. As for the sides, the potato salad was excellent, the beans were good, but only luke warm not hot and the rice had no flavor and it was cold. Off to the side you can pick white or wheat bread. The folks who work there were VERY friendly and were eager to help or answer any questions you had. There was plenty of room to eat inside. Today it was 103 so no one took advantage of the outdoor seating. When the cashier told me my total I had to ask him to repeat it. $50! I have never paid $50 for two (my wife had exactly the same thing I had minus the rice. So, was it worth $50? No, not even close. All of the meats are by the pound. I will be back for the sausage and potato salad but everything else was not worth the price, especially when only served luke warm.

It was pretty good, close to a 5-star experience.  Here's what we had.....\\n\\n- Pork Buns were solid \\n- Sea Urchin was superb (not offered anymore)\\n- Beef Hand Pulled Noodles - thick cut was fabulous \\n- Chili Oil was awesome \\n- Green Tea\\n- I met the owner back then at the sushi bar - he was very nice and attentive, the food presentation and quality was superb, service was impeccable.  You could tell the staff took pride in their work and their offerings. \\n\\nFast forward to July 2017, my most recent visit on a Sunday, and it was horrible.  They went downhill big time, most of our sauces on the dishes were very, very salty, it was not as clean, and the customer service was non-existent.  Here's what we had....\\n\\n- Lobster Dumplings - still very good. \\n- Red Tuna - okay but salty sauce\\n- Shrimp Tempura - - dipping sauce was WAY too salty.  Unbearable.  Horrible, horrible.  I asked twice for better dipping sauce, all the cook did was add sugar - - WTF?  They don't know WTF they're doing back there or what a real tempura dipping sauce is like.  \\n- Dumplings - they used the same tempura dipping sauce - again - WAY too salty.  \\n- Seared Scallops - - okay, lacked flavor and very small, not all that n a bag of chips. \\n- Sea Urchin is no longer on the menu (maybe a good thing...)\\n\\nThe other downers were the lack of cleanliness and customer service.  My server - - who was not customer service oriented by any means - I told her how bad the sauce was and asked if she could get a different one.  She came back with the cook's altered version (horrible) and I told her it was still bad - - her response was \\"well I'm so busy right now I can't do anything for you....\\" - - WTF?  She then disappeared forEVA I tell ya, and left me in the dust w/ empty drinks for at least 15-20 min.  Not good.   \\n\\nOverall there is a lack of attention to detail here, poor execution and quality on some of the dishes, a lack of customer service where bad items should have been taken off the bill.  My water had floaties in it (nasty!) and my table and bench were dirty - - she cleaned it with a dirty towel and you can see dirt smear across the table.

That's a lot to live up to, you got my attention, since RR does know her food I'm expecting an exceptional experience.  Overall it was just A-OK.  \\n\\nFirst visit I ordered an Al Pastor and a Migas tacos at $3 a piece, which is on the premium side of things when it comes to tacos, and nearly double what I've paid at other places w/ exceptional portions and quality.  I was expecting the similar high quality and respectable portions, along w/ that RR WOW factor.  They came out in a timely manner, the Al Pastor was excellent, very flavorful, and I was pretty happy with it.  The Migas taco was underwhelming, as I compare it to others I've tried this just wasn't as flavorful and the portion size was definitely on the skimpy side.     \\n\\nThe salsas were excellent.  There's 3:  the usual green salsa - which was a hit, a bright red salsa that's hot and bold in flavor, some garlic action going on - awesome!  And the 3rd was in a mortar bowl freshly prepped - -a huge bonus that makes this place unique, unfortunately, they ran out and it wasn't replaced.  Stock outs are a bummer.  \\n\\nThat Veracruz experience was still good enough to earn a 2nd trip back, and this time I avoided the Migas and went for something new on the menu that was better priced:  2 orange-marinaded pork tacos for $5.  They're similar to Al Pastor but this pork is marinaded in orange juice instead of pineapples.   Five minutes later my tacos were ready and piping hot, the first thing I noticed - again - was the size of the tacos were not only smaller, but they were both inconsistent even though it was the same taco.  I'm expecting fist-sized and I get anorexic-fist-sized, and they're supposed to be identical twins but one anorexic got the brunt end of the DNA code as it looked quite dwarfed.  WTF? \\n\\nThose orange marinaded pork tacos did taste good, nothing outta this world or unique, but still very good.  The dwarfed-size and inconsistent portions left me feeling quite underwhelmed in comparison to the $6 I shelled out (including $1 tip).  There are some taco places that have very good quality and I'll be full after 2, and that's at half the price in comparison.  Another issue on this visit:  my favorite green salsa didn't taste right, you could tell it had been sitting out for a while and lost its gusto.  No mortor bowl tonight - it was replaced with 2 plastic bins containing the 2 red salsas packed in mini solo cups.  The bright red hot salsa was excellent, same as last time, no let down here, but the other fresh salsa was not as good.   \\n\\nIMO - if RR is gonna plug your place, then you gotta be consistent in quality - all around - every single time, and you should feel satisfied for the price you're paying, and I just felt...okay.  That doesn't mean this place isn't good, I just wish it would be great all the time.  Next time I'll show up dressed as Rachel Ray and see how things go - - maybe they'll pull out the red carpet w/ plenty of fresh salsa on hand and a Veracruz Taco Buffet....?

They don't serve any pita's with their bowls so you basically are eating it all in one scoop of pickle, falafel or shawarma and other unknown addins with a little bit of hummus you scoop of the bottom of the bowl.  If you get the wrap it is all in one giant two handed roll.   The shawarma was very salty.  At first I thought it was the yellow salty spicy mustard ilke sauce they put all ove r the top, but then eating it separate, decided it was the meat that was salty and the pickles that were the spicy. \\nThe olive dish is really 1/3 sliced pickles, 1/3 variety pitted olives, and 1/3 pickled okra and two slices of pickled tomatoes for $6.   The Baba ganoush was very good.  The falafels in and of themselves were good.

I think Blue Star does their marketing right, for their audience 'tho.  A donut will cost you about $4, they put one of each on display, they change out the flavors somewhat daily, and there's an air of mystery and scarcity to their product.  Bingo! Just what foodies crave in their quest for exclusivity and bragging rights to being early onboarders to trends.\\n\\nThe donuts were good, make no mistake about the quality of the food.\\n\\nFor proper context of this review...  I'm not a connoisseur of  the donuts and am often fine with any donut, don't go ga-ga over Krispy Kreme nor Dunkin' Donuts, used to go to WInchell's and Rolling Pin, so your average indulger who bought donuts maybe 4x per year at best, and was used to paying $0.50 per donut, now feel that $0.75-$1.00 is the right price for a basic donut... with that, I don't have a Man-Bun, nor Scruffy Beard and fit the role of paying a lot for a donut.\\n\\nSo, in my opinion the portions and price were a bit high, figuring if you bought a dozen donuts to the office casually, it would set you back over $30, where as a normal mom and pop donut store it would be under $10 (at least in Los Angeles), so it reminds me of the $5 designer cupcakes (Sprinkles) that were at one time all the rage... unless it's a special occasion or you are beyond that \\"six figure\\" salary and don't flinch as spending a lot for something that can be acquired with comparable product for cheaper.\\n\\nThey do have unique flavors, but I'm a basic donut guy, not really ever craving mixing my sweets with salty or spicy.

We figured we would give it a try because how can you really mess up breakfast food? \\n\\nWe knew something was wrong when the place was empty. First Watch around 10am on a Sunday was always jumping and there was probably 6 other patrons dining when we walked in. The hostess and waitress were both nice and accommodating and as we flipped through the menu, we realized that the restaurant had kept many of First Watch's signature dishes. I ordered the Turkey Dill, a delicious breakfast crepe that I have been eating for years at First Watch locations. Total mistake. \\n\\nThe crepe almost had a omelette consistency. I had about a pound of hollandaise sauce (which appeared to be from a can) thrown on top. The mushrooms were severely under seasoned and overall the dish just wasn't tasty. My husband didn't have many complaints about his corned beef hash so I guess 1 out of 2 isn't so bad.\\n\\nBut we won't be returning. Instead, we will drive 10 mins down the road to the First Watch in Longwood off of 434. The new owners of this restaurant should have better chefs, decor and put a nice and unique spin on their own original dishes instead of hoping people take a chance on them. There isn't anything unique about this place and the fact that they are using a similar menu to First Watch's is, I don't know...deceiving? However, if you want average and easy breakfast dishes that are hard to mess up (eggs, bacon, toast, etc) this place may work for you."},{"name":"Parish Cafe and Bar","address":"361 Boylston St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"One of my favorite places in Boston for lunch.

Locals hate it, tourists are crazed about it, but I can't say no to a solid donut made with hearty traditional dough. I grew up on glazed donut holes and maple bars at the ma and pa shops. Simple, reliable, and comforting.\\n\\nSo, Blue Star. I was initially impressed with the clean, modern industrial layout of the place, and yes, the \\"Keep Calm and Eat Donuts\\" mantra on the walls, but honestly the dough just didn't do anything for me. Free sample tastings of the glazes are offered if you're skeptical about the combination of blueberries basil and bourbon, perhaps, but I found them all to be a bit on the sweet side. We ended up ordering five different flavors to achieve a well-rounded donut tasting experience: the blueberry bourbon one, of course, powdered sugar and spice, Valrhona chocolate crunch, dulce de leche and almonds, and peanut butter filled with jelly. If I had to choose a favorite, it would have been a tie between the PB&J or the sugar dusted one. But honestly, it was either the high amount of sugar or the dough that didn't sit well with me. After a small bite of the dulce de leche, I almost cried out for an insulin pen. The Valhrona chocolate was extremely disappointing, as I didn't realize it was cream-filled and I absolutely cannot tolerate cream inside a donut. WHAT'S THE POINT?! Blah. Needless to say, we didn't end up finishing a few bites of them.\\n\\nI must say that the coffee is well done though. A decaf soy latte paired very nicely and made up for the lack of the donut punch I was hoping for. I won't give up on them yet, though. Maybe they'll work the kinks out with their dough in time, and I'd definitely go back in to try the hard cider apple fritter if I'm ever in the area.

Living on the south coast, we don't have any Banh Mi places, and, seeing as I had to bring my car up to the Acura place in Walpole for it's 45,000 mile check-up, I gave this place a go to feed my Banh Mi jones! Man, am I ever glad I did, too, 'cause this was some tasty Banh Mi. I ordered a cold cut to eat there along with a tofu rice wrap and a Thai bubble tea (that the owner tells me they brew there - no packaged stuff for him! \\"Everything fresh and from scratch!\\"). \\n\\nThe bubble tea was, as expected, amazing, and the tofu rice wrap was soft, warm, and tasty, with just the right amount of bite in the wrap and a nicely seasoned peanut sauce for dipping. The Banh Mi ($3.75!!!) was out of this world. Crunchy, freshly baked French bread and crisp veggies, a great mix of savory cold cuts, and just an all-around wonderful sense of handcrafted goodness. I ordered pork versions of the sandwich for the wife and I for dinner, and those were even better! The pork is grilled to order over charcoal, and has a great sweet flavor with a nice touch of char from the grill. Of course I had to warm it up a bit as it'd been in the fridge for a few hours, but the bread still had great crunch and, like any good Banh Mi, this wasn't overdressed (just a smear of mayo) so there was no \\"sog factor\\" or slimy veggies. \\n\\nOverall, this place is excellent, and an excellent value. I mean, for the price of a terrible burger from McDonald's, you get a fresh, delicious, and HOMEMADE sandwich that stands toe-to-toe with the best Banh Mi I've had. If I had any complaints it's that I'd like a little more in terms of filling (but, for that price, one can't complain), and I wish they were closer to my house!!"},{"name":"Mangia Pizza","address":"12001 Burnet Rd","city":"Austin","stars":"3","text":"I was considering to use Mangia's catering for an event, but thought I'd check it out for lunch first (great specials btw).\\n\\nThe food is actually good, but it wasn't what we ordered, lol.

It was just the right size -- I don't subscribe to the bigger-is-better mentality when it comes to my drinks and food portions. The sweetness of the guava was well-balanced by the piney flavor of the gin and the tang of the lime -- I'd definitely order it again.\\n\\nWe began our meal with the palmito salad, which came with three bacon-wrapped, almond-filled dates. We were fairly happy with the appetizer: it's hard to go wrong with bacon-wrapped dates! The salad was decent, although it was too heavily dressed. Next time I'll try to remember to ask for light dressing. Our appetizer plates were cleared before our entrees arrived, which I was happy about.\\n\\nMy mahi mahi was plaintain-encrusted and served with a warm tomato salad and \\"Rabo Encendido\\" -- braised shredded beef. The mahi was somewhat overcooked and was slightly chewy; the flavor was not bad, but not amazing. I did not care for the rabo encendido; it was overly sweet and spicy, not much subtlety there. The tomatoes were good. My boyfriend had ordered his beef medium rare, but it was cooked through.

Please note if you haven't: I am a vegetarian and German cuisine is focused a lot around sausage. Not wanting to crush any hopes of dreams (this time) I agreed and figured I'd find something on the menu to have for dinner. . . if nothing else, there'd be beer. \\n\\nAfter perusing the menu and taking a peek at the Autobahn Super Buffet I decided with guidance of the server to order the Alpine Chicken Spatzel sans Chicken with choice of Macaroni and Chunky Apple Sauce for my two sides. For the curious, the Autobahn Buffet included: mashed potatoes, kraut, macaroni and cheese, gravy, lots of sausage, fried chicken, green beans (with bacon), potato soup, cabbage, some sort of mystery Jello salad, and a lack lustre salad bar. With my dinner I also ordered a Dark Lager in the mid size which was more than average. . . then again, it is German.\\n\\nWhen my plate was delivered I was a little hesitant about this pile of onions, mushrooms, and peppers piled upon a solid foundation of spatzel. Ah, spatzel! Like little pillows of delight. The blend was actually spot on and I thought quite flavorful for eliminating the star of the entr√©e, the chicken. The macaroni was average and not so hot. The applesauce was akin to Mott's. The included dinner roll was also quite run of the mill, but not run of the puppy mill--that's just mean. I will say that the beer was delightful and that the mid size was more than plenty.\\n\\nThe real magic of the experience happened after dinner when we got to talk cream puffs. I asked our server what the options where and he offered choices of Vanilla, Chocolate, or Peanut Butter Fudge. I told him that how could there even be an option when Peanut Butter Fudge was a contestant! It's like the Meryl Streep of cream puffs--regardless of the competition, she's winning. I honestly don't know how I finished the cream puff but I am glad I did. . . I do feel a little over stuffed but I think that's in the charm of German cuisine. \\n\\nI enjoyed my meal. Sure, it may not be what I would choose out of other options, but it wasn't horrible. I wish I would have remembered to consider the pretzel nuggets because I think they sound really good. I also think I would like to have tried the beer flight because one is fun, but why not two? And if you like two, you might as well four. If you like four, why not a few? Why not a slew more? More! (If you're clueless, check out Madonna: I'm Breathless). \\n\\nI also wish that the servers wore lederhosen.

I don't think you can go wrong with anything on the menue, but be sure to save room for dessert.  W had the chocolate cake and the rosemary infused nectarine pie.  I am very particular about cake and pies and Both were outstanding.  The cake was light and chocolates but not overly sweet.  The boiled icing was a bit on the sweet side for me, but for others who actually like icing it was perfect.  The nectarine pie was fabulous.  The nectarines were at their peak and the flavor was intense and perfect with a slight perfume of rosemary to compliment.  The cruse was light and flakey but not greasy. You could tell they don't use shortening just good old butter.\\nI almost forgot about the wine list!

The kitchen has no idea what it's doing and the place is so poorly laid out that you have to ask other diners to scootch and press themselves into their tables in order to squeeze through the dining room.\\n\\nWe had a table of 7. The shrimp lettuce wraps tasted ok but were really hard to eat (bad filling-to-lettuce ratio). The ribs were overcooked and tough. The ahi tuna had been seared at some point, but must have then been put in the fridge, because it was icy. The gluten-free pizza with extra cheese, came with hardly any cheese at all. Also, their gluten-free crust is herbed, which is a weird choice that I didn't like -- it overpowered the other flavors in the pizza. But the worst was my friend's dinner -- he ordered the salmon with spinach instead of rice. His plate came with rice, and no spinach. So he asked for the spinach, and a while later he was presented with a bowl of broccoli. Um, that's a vegetable and it's green, but still not spinach. By the time he finally got his spinach, he barely wanted it anymore. Not to mention that his fish smelled like it was slightly past its prime.\\n\\nThe only food on the table that anyone loved was the broccoli cheese soup.\\n\\nWe had one server who took our orders and checked up on us, and she was great -- the only positive aspect of our visit actually. But when the food was delivered, every single plate was brought to the table by a new and different person. I'll never understand that style of food service -- it's annoying to have to play air-traffic-controller with the plates and tell 7 different people where to place each plate. This style of service also held true for drink orders -- especially entertaining was the server who couldn't tell the difference between a pint of beer and a pint of raspberry cider.

Chocolate dohua mousse for dessert. The sauce for the spring rolls were nice while spring rolls were ok. We tasted pickled bamboo shoots in it, which I didn't like. But overall we didn't find the excitement that we were expecting looking at the yelp review. The twice cooked lamb came with a lot of veggies but relatively little lamb. The sauce was very heavy that competed or even defeated the flavor of the lamb. To me the sauce tasted like typical American Chinese stir fry sauce (maybe some soy sauce, oyster sauce, etc). It didn't not fulfill our expectation either. Then the ribs were served last. The flavor was actually unique. However it was unfortunately bland. Ours didn't have the braised color as the one showed in the picture posted previously, neither did it come with green onions. It could be that it wasn't braised as long and therefore did not have enough flavors/taste in it. As for the dohua, we were impressed in the first few bites. You can actually taste tofu in the mousse. Maybe the made it with soy milk because in my impression dohua is silky and tender but still in solid form. The dohua mouse tasted more like pudding texture. However as we went on, we could not taste the tofu flavor any more for some reason and it did taste like chocolate pudding in the end. \\n\\nOverall, we are disappointed spending our vacation time and money there.

Then was told I couldn't have both at the same time.  Ok, you probably deal with a bunch of drunk college kids that can't hold their liquor. So I drank the jamo then took my beer. Wings were good so I ordered another Jameson, and some more wings to take back to the hotel for later. When the wings came, I had one, finished my beer, then asked for a box and the check. I was told the wings could not be taken Togo because they were a special price. I'd understand if it was all you can eat, but it's not. I offered to pay for a box, but manager told the bartender I could pay full price and take them, or they'd take them off the bill. As I wasn't willing to pay over 4 times what I'd expected, I had them take it off and watched them dump the wings. Such a waste. Instead of making a couple of extra bucks on a box I was willing to pay for, or losing money having someone sit at the bar longer taking up a spot, they chose to throw away food that no one payed for.

The daily offerings are truly inspired. \\n\\nThe wine and cocktail list definitely pair very well with the concept of the menu. Great, moderately priced wines that are definitely fairly priced for a restaurant. A couple BC wines, but mostly French and Californian. \\n\\nThough it seems like an after thought, the creme brulee is devastating. I would say one of the best creme brulees in the city. Velvety, rich, yet light enough for you to feel like you could easily eat another.\\n\\nLes Faux Bourgeois is one of the few restaurants in the city where I feel like the entire concept and menu are so well rounded that I would easily pay for a 3 or 4 course meal plus a couple glasses of wine and a coffee and not feel terrible, solely because it is just so good.

You get the option of white, wheat, multigrain, baguette, or croissant. I love that they give you this many options rather then just the normal white bread.

Needless to say, I was in oyster heaven and quite content.\\n\\nI would have been satisfied with just the fresh oysters, but the other reason that I came to Coast was to eat the B.C.

I approached them about catering a dinner for my son's 21st birthday party.  To begin with, they were so attentive and reassuring every step of the way.  As each day got closer to the party, the weather forecast got worse and worse.  I would get a daily phone call reassuring me that everything would be ok and that he would make sure that he would adapt everything according to the weather.  Even though I had never met them before, I had a peaceful feeling that this was going to turn out good.  Secondly, was the presentation of the food.... from the crab and star shaped carrots to the watermelon with his name carved out - everything was beautiful.  And then there was the food itself.  Since I did not know anything about Hawaiian food, I trusted him to select the menu.  Every dish was absolutely incredible. There were several dishes for vegetarians and non vegetarians as well.  I would say that almost everyone  came  asked me where did I get the food from and several of them were 20-21 year olds.   Finally, you can't forget the quantity of food !! I ordered for 35 and I got food for an army.  It feed all those college boys boys with many getting seconds and even thirds,  I put some in the fridge for dinner the next couple of nights and I froze some.

I was more of a chicken tenders or hot wings or hot girls person. But once I came to Austin for college, names of eateries started popping up in conversation. One such name was Hopdoddys. However, being the lazy bum that I am, catching a bus to South Congress or getting a ride from a friend seemed like an impossible task of the utmost difficulty. When my roommate was finally able to excavate my mountainous lardy behind from my chair in my man cave and take me to this establishment, I was extremely surprised. But not in a good way.\\n\\n The line was OUT OF THE DOOR. (This was on a weekend night so that is to be expected). So we waited, and waited. We were on the sidewalk behind a group of French people who expressed excitement at dining here. If there's anything that American media has taught me through stereotypes, French people are very snooty and picky. My brainwashed mind then relayed to me through the neurons, dendrites, and other cool stuff in my nervous system that because these French people were eating here, this restaurant could be of considerable quality. I don't know what snooty means. Maybe it's a sound that an animal makes( I'm thinking a schnauzer or a poodle), hold on I'm googling it. Ok so apparently it means \\"a person's nose\\". I was a mile off on my definition. Okay next paragraph. \\n\\nEventually, when we were almost at the front of the door, the person who worked there told us Hopdoddy's might be closing before we could get in. But through sheer luck, we were one of the last patrons in this place. Long story short, the food was good but a bit pricey. This was my first visit to this restaurant last year. I am writing this review today because a friend of mine got me some Hopdoddy's to go (Thank you Zachariah), and I felt compelled to write a review because there is no way I'm hauling ass to some burger restaurant in this 30 degree weather no sir I'm staying in bed with my blankets and Youtube puppy videos. \\n\\nI've ran out of things to write but yeah the food is dank :^)"},{"name":"Breakfast Club Altamonte","address":"249 W State Rd 436","city":"Altamonte Springs","stars":"3.5","text":"First off, DO NOT EXPECT FIRST WATCH FOOD.  This is a completely different restaurant, and in my opinion MUCH better than First Watch!   I always thought First Watch had a super boring menu of things that sounded appealing, but were very 'meh' in terms of execution (frozen home fries are always a bad sign to me - that's the kind of food you get at a hotel breakfast bar!).  I'm really not sure why they have so many locations.  But, I digress. \\n\\nBreakfast Club Altamonte is the sister restaurant of the Maitland Breakfast Club which isn't too far away from this location (and of which I am a huge fan).  The menu is almost identical.  \\n\\nWe tried it out today just to check out the new location.  I was expecting it to be busier since it was Saturday, but it was pretty quiet.   I think people don't know they are there, yet.  More people started filtering in for lunch as were leaving.\\n\\nI got the French toast special and my bf got the corn beef hash breakfast.  Now, this place is a diner.  With that said, it is better than most!  They have more fresh veggies than most diners and the food is always served promptly and with a smile.   Their lunch sandwiches are awesome, too.  \\nI rather enjoy the coffee, as well, and the prices are good.  I am glad the Breakfast Club is expanding.

Yeah, it IS a buffet, but it only had 8 items. Tandoori chicken, saag, okra curry. coconut cabbage and a chicken stew. All were tasty, not too salty or oily, but lots of blah. NO kick whatsoever.

I thoroughly enjoyed it but, the waffle was a bit bland and maybe could have used a bit of honey to spruce it up.\\n\\nThe coffee here is spot on and I hear that their hot chocolate is the bomb but, I will have to wait for the weather to cool off to try that.

Visited this restaurant at around 7pm on a Thursday night. There were around 6 empty seats (3 pairs of 2 seaters) in the restaurant. When we arrived, there was a sign outside the entrance that asked customers to put down their names and wait to be called in as tables are made ready. We put down our name after another party of 2 and waited. Waitresses in the restaurant did not bother to look outside the restaurant at all even though there were empty seats in the restaurant... 15 minutes passed and the waitresses realized there are people waiting outside in the cold and decided to take in the first party of 2 to be seated. We thought we can follow them in as there were other empty seats in the restaurant but was abruptly declined. We waited for another 10 min outside... the waitress who seated the first party of 2 before us went on to help other customers dining in the restaurant. We were completely ignored while there were also another party of 2 who also put down their name waiting to be seated as well. \\n\\nMy gf and I decided to leave at this point as we do not want to dine in an unwelcoming restaurant and we definitely do not mind taking our business elsewhere that deserve our business. It seems like it is the restaurant's scheme to \\"create\\" a line up outside even though the restaurant is not full in order to lure other customers or seemingly create a new ramen joint hype. Not sure if the food was good, but we definitely do not appreciate the poor customer service offer.

It has been quite a while since sushi has caught my attention like this. It was my favorite part of the meal. To start we shared the pork buns and tempura lobster dumplings which were both just simply amazing. Biting into the pork buns brought me great joy with its combination of a soft sweet outside and wonderful burst of flavor inside"},{"name":"El Chilito","address":"2225 Manor Rd","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"Taste:\\nFirst off, this place has the best migas in town.  They toast their little crispy tortilla strips and scatter them on top so the give just the right amount of crunch.  There is just the right amount of cheese - neither skimpy nor smothering the plate.  The refritos have a good mouthfeel, excellent flavor, and contain just the right amount of that stuff I don't want to know about.  All of the tacos I have tried have been tasty-in particular the cochinita pibil and their special ,the famous puffy taco.\\n\\nPortions:\\nOverall, the food here is portioned exactly the right - filling, but you don't feel like a feed animal when you are done.  If you've been doing heavy labor, you might be better off elsewhere with enormous cheap greasy tacos, but if you want to actually taste your food, here's the place to go.\\n\\nExtras:\\nTheir drinks, both with and without alcohol are pretty fantastic.  Try the mexican hot chocolate, the orchata or the sangria. Their paletas (Mexican popsicles) are crazy out of this world.  When it's hot out, I like to get the pickle paleta, which is ground-up pickles, frozen, on a stick.  Mmmm.  Even weirder is the Lucas popsicle, which tastes somewhat like the candy of the same name, somewhat like a Bloody Mary.  (It's not for everyone.  I once popped a piece of one into my bf's mouth and he asked if I was trying to start a fight.)  The pecan, cookies and cream, pina con chile and vanilla paletas are all very good as well.\\n\\nPrice:\\nSure, you can pay less at a cart, but here you can sit down, have some sangria, meet someone here.  For the taste value, you can't beat it.\\n\\nHipness factor:\\nEl Chilito's is a good place to go weekend mornings when you have bedhead, whether you just rolled out of bed, or you've intentionally mussed into place.  During brunch hours it is populated with scrawny college kids nursing a hangover and trying to dress as badly/Emo as possible.  They coexist peacefully with the amused homeowners and the working-joe types who are just trying to get a couple of tacos and a cup of coffee.  \\n\\nQuibbles:\\nFirst, I'd prefer that they have some better way of announcing that your food is ready.  If you sit down at the tables, it's unlikely that you'll hear them call your number over the music.  Second, later hours would help.  Third: red salsa! Ahumado gets boring after a while."},{"name":"Mana Escondido Caf√©","address":"68 Aguadilla St","city":"Boston","stars":"4.5","text":"he name definitely is as honest as apple pie.

But not here, this changed my mind about Puerto Rican restaurants in this city. It brought me back to days when I lived there or the days I went there for vacation. The taste is fresh, full of flavor and leaves you desiring for more. I had the beef Mofongo. If you never had mofongo, its pretty much a smash fried plantain(like smash potatoes but with plantains). This can be done wrong and greasy, but here its done fresh and flavorful. The beef in the bottom was a great surprise(I knew they were there, but with flavor the mofongo had I forgot the beef was there).They also have traditional Puerto  RIcan beverages. Kola Champagne, Uva Colonial.

Great ambience, large comfy chairs and good sized table. We were early so there was no maitre d' or hostess. \\n\\nService was attentive and good.

My wife had the daily special swordfish. I hoped for prime rib which they did not have. Decided to try the wiener schnitzel instead. We shared an escargot and house salad. The escargot was in little ceramic cups, very hot overflowing with butter and garlic served with plump chunks of toast also with garlic. It was perfect for soaking up the juice. The salad was fresh consisting of perhaps a dozen large green leaves with 3 sun dried tomatoe pieces and some walnuts. Excellent dressing. Certainly an excellent start. But we both graded the entrees a \\"B\\". The swordfish was a nice 1\\" thick piece, but somewhat overcooked. Good taste though. The schnitzel was served with flat noodles. It was soaking in oil and therefore no longer light. Probably also not pounded thin. The cook may not have experienced a genuine wiener schnitzel himself. The wine list is good, with representation from most of the popular international wine regions. It is not an exhaustive list, so the focus is on moderate to medium price labels. I did rediscover a favorite classified bordeaux. They use a wonderful huge decanter, a nice touch. The bottle remainder should be even better the next day after it had a chance to open up more. \\n\\nOverall, this is a good dining experience. Old Boston it is no longer after ownership change.

They were initially packed on a Monday night, but we didn't have to wait and by the time we left, they had pretty much cleared out. Started with a burrata dish with spinach and sun-dried tomatoes on bruschetta, which was absolute perfection. For my main, I had one of the pasta specials - what looked like some kind of skinny lasagna noodles with pesto and scallops. The pasta was perfectly al dente but the noodles came out cold while the scallops were piping hot and just slightly overcooked. With the cheese they sprinkled on top, the flavor was just a tad too salty and strong for me.

Plus they were out of both ribs choices at 8pm. If you offered that for $9=winner. Brisket and turkey was normal in taste and serving size. The creamed corn was probably the best I've ever had. Potato salad below average didn't like the taste and too creamy. I tasted my friends cole slaw was below average and mac and cheese we both agreed was good but they said they've had better. I should have just got the chopped beef sandwich plate but I just checked their menu online and that's $10 with potato chips and a soda. Apparently they really want to push the soda profit. Why don't you offer a chopped beef sandwich plate with a side for $8 and let people drink water. You'd have more return customers or especially at $7. They had a choice of what looked like at least 12 homemade side choices sitting there at their big sides and dessert bar so why not push those rather than potato chip bags? None of the sandwich plate choices offer a side only potato chips? We both said we won't be coming back unless they offer more choices.

The bison burger was bland and there was hardly any poblano on it...like three tiny slices. Needs some salt for sure, but as others have mentioned there aren't any condiments on the tables. Generally you expect the food to be really good at places that leave condiments off the table because they have confidence in their chefs abilities. Not so much but the Rosemary fries were fantastic! Yes, you'll smell like garlic the rest of the day but I don't mind. Beer came in a bottle and I wasn't offered a glass, not that big of a deal, but it took about 15-20 mins to arrive at the table and there's hardly anyone here.

The first time, I happened to be staying at a nearby hotel (for a job interview, before I moved here), and looked for restaurants in the area on my phone's yelp app.  Although I've generally disliked Asian fusion food in the past (usually watered down, Westernized versions of spicier, more distinctive native dishes), I was intrigued by the reviews, and decided to check it out.  On a weekday night, I easily got a spot at the bar without waiting, which was pretty exciting!  There is an open kitchen so at the bar, you can watch the bustling chefs prep and plate the food, which I love.  When I sat down and scanned the restaurant, I was impressed with the diversity of the patrons--young hipsters, older couples, families.  Everyone was animated, eagerly enjoying their food and drink, happy.  The decor is unfussy but sharp -- lots of black, red flower designs, mirrored surfaces, dim lighting.  Tables are small and closely spaced.  Sound is a bit loud but you don't have to shout to be heard.\\n\\nAfter going through the reviews, I decided to order the kale & persimmon salad, braised pork belly buns, and tea-smoked pork spare ribs.  Each dish is served as soon as it is ready, so there was a time gap between them, with the ribs arriving quite a bit after the other two.  The kale salad was tasty, slightly spicy, and not overly salty, but didn't blow me away.  The braised pork buns were insanely delicious--loved the sweetness of the pork and hoisin sauce contrasting with the sour pickle, and the soft spongy bun.  The star of the three was definitely the ribs though--they were so tender they fell off the bone, and the flavor was rich, fatty, smokey, and delightfully meaty.  I rolled my eyes with delight as I bit into them--the best ribs I had eaten in ages, including all those ribs I ate in bbq places in North Carolina before moving up here.  Amazing.\\n\\nI returned when my friend YCCFL (Y chromosome carrier from London) visited me on his first trip to Boston.  He asked me to pick a restaurant that I felt was \\"me,\\" and although I hadn't yet explored too many in the area, Myers + Chang seemed like the best fit so far.  I made a reservation from OpenTable, and we arrived early but were still seated promptly.  YCCFL was similarly charmed by the spirit and vibe of the place.  We ordered mama chang's pork and chive dumplings, the dan dan noodles, and the tea smoked ribs (again).  I got a housemade lychee vanilla soda, and he got a yuzu smash cocktail.  YCCFL didn't care for his drink too much, which was too strong for him, and my drink was blandly sweet but not as punchy as I would have liked.  The dumplings were good but greasy, and not the best I've had.  The noodles were very spicy but delicious, and had the perfect texture.  The ribs were tasty, though not as good as I had remembered the first time.  We shared a coconut cream pie, which was really mostly cream with a pastry shell, and I was actually disappointed with this...I expected more custard, but it was all light fluffy cream.\\n\\nDuring his 5 day visit, YCCFL liked Myers + Chang so much he wanted to return for his last night in Boston.  This time we both got Bloodlust cocktails (blood orange margaritas with sriracha lime rim), which were FABULOUS.  We downed those babies within minutes.  We also had the Lamoreaux Landing chardonnay, which was utterly lovely.  As for food, we went with the braised pork belly buns (delicious as before), the kale & persimmon salad (delicious as before), and the tamarind glazed pan-roasted hake, which was the star of the trio.  The fish was expertly prepared and moist, and the slightly sour grapefruit and jicama garnishes set off the sweetness of the fish perfectly.\\n\\nNow, this place ain't cheap, but overall I think it's worth a special occasion dinner.  As others have mentioned, if the prices scare you, make sure to check out Cheap Date nights on Monday & Tuesday, with a variety of reasonable prix fixe options.  I love the food & vibe at Myers + Chang, and look forward to returning to try more dishes!"},{"name":"Schmidt's Sausage Haus","address":"240 E Kossuth St","city":"Columbus","stars":"4","text":"First time here.

We found this place by accident. Originally planning to dine elsewhere we decided to drive around to see if there was anywhere interesting to have dinner and a few beers. On our way out, we noticed There, and since it looked clean, not overcrowded and with ample parking we decided to give it a shot. \\n\\nWe sat outside since the weather was nice this evening, so I don't have anything to say about the interior of the restaurant. Bars and restaurants with nice outdoor seating in Atlanta are a commodity. Indeed, your view is that of a Costco parking lot, but the street is quiet, and it beats inhaling fumes from unPleasant Hill or Peachtree Road. \\n\\nHow to describe the menu? Well, the typical pub fare is present, but There also seems to go a little unusual - at least for bar food - with a few items. Roasted duck is available, for example. The drink menu is fairly strong, with a pretty good selection of beer, ranging from one of my favorites, 21st Amendment, to your basic Bud and Coors. The mixed drink selection seems pretty respectable too, and there is a \\"Build Your Own Manhattan/Cosmo, whatever\\" on the menu, but that's really not up my alley.  The food is quite good. For appetizers we had the fried pickles, which were sweet, not dill, and served in combination of spears and chips. The batter was crispy, the pickles weren't excessively greasy and this was definitely an item I'd order again. I was just in the mood for a few beers tonight, so I ordered a Caesar Salad which was good, nothing exceptional, and my girlfriend ordered the There burger, which was excellent, served with rosemary-garlic fries. The fries definitely stood out as being a strongpoint in the meal and I wish that I had ordered a side of them myself. Finally, pickle chips are served on the side with the burgers, and I'm not sure if they buy them or make them at the restaurant, but regardless, they are a delicious combination of heat and sweet and a nice departure from the standard ones thrown on most burgers.\\n\\nThere is about par for the course in terms of pricing for Brookhaven. In other words, it's not expensive in and of itself, but if you don't watch yourself, you'll wind up for with a $100 ticket, as did I. I'd certainly go again, though. The food is good enough and drink menu extensive such it definitely warrants a revisit. \\n\\nPros: Easy parking (the Costco parking lot), for Atlanta standards, a decent little patio, good food.\\n\\nCons: If you don't watch yourself, you'll wind up with an expensive bill.\\n\\nVerdict: Recommended."},{"name":"bartaco","address":"969 Marietta St NW","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"I was really impressed.

After scouring yelp for places to dine, we discovered Truva.  Since we were both \\"out of towners\\" our options were limited due to only having the MARTA as our only form of transportation.  Located just a hop skip and a jump from the Peachtree Center stop, we were on our way to dine.  My 4-star review is strictly based off the food we both had.  My lamb was cooked perfectly and I very much enjoyed my grilled eggplant salad.  Dessert was on point with a Turkish coffee accompanied with a piece of baklava.  Most baklava is very heavy, sticky and too rich to eat the entire piece, even with a cup of black, dark coffee.  This baklava was perfect, maybe some of the best I've had?  I'm not sure what type of honey they used, but it seemed to be far less rich and less sticky than other honey used in baklavas I've had in the past.  This could be due to eating mostly Greek baklava?  \\n\\nOnto the ambience of this place...The low lighting, decor & music volume (when there's not a belly dancer) of Truva gives it a classy, quiet, type of vibe.  Perfect for a good dinner, conversation with friends, family or a date.  The music selection is very eclectic to say the least and it made for a few good laughs between my Mom and I.  My only complaint is the music when the belly dancer came out.  The belly dancer killed the ambience of this place for me.  The music changes and gets blasted as if you are at a WWF wrestling event and your favorite wrestler is walking out to the ring.

It was actually my first time there for a meal.\\n\\nThe new england chowder ($9) was not bad.  I enjoyed the addition of bacon and the two mussels, but I couldn't find a single manila clam, which was listed on the menu.  There were, however, some chewy tasteless bits that seemed to be similar to surf clams.  Although it was chocked full of vegetables (namely carrots), I wish the overall viscosity was a bit thicker and richer.\\n\\nWhen we sat down, I noticed the table next to us were picking at a steamer with mysterious crunchy bits in them.  Not knowing that was actually the calamari ($9), we had ordered it as well.  Darn. Upon first glance it seemed okay, but the pieces of squid were quite tough.  Dorothy had had this here before, but she noted she had positive experiences every time before since the bits of squid were rings rather than slices.\\n\\nAfter two pieces, the batter was falling apart every where and the squid and batter separated.  We sent it back to the kitchen, and we were pleased they were pretty good about it.  Since I was actually pretty full, I didn't really want any carbs and didn't feel like I could appreciate a large piece of fish.  Instead, I opted for the mussels done \\"classic style\\" ($19).\\n\\nThe mussels were huge and really quite juicy.  They were also quite rich with chardonnay, which I really liked.  They were good and probably even better than my favourite ones from Seasons.  The fries were nothing special, but some of them were quite salty. \\n\\nThe waiter recommended the sablefish ($36), stating it was really buttery -- which naturally makes sense due to it's high omega-3 content.  Although I usually find sablefish to be a treat, I felt this piece of fish to be unexciting.  The meat itself was not that smooth, with the \\"fibres\\" of the fish quite discernible upon chewing.  I did like the sauce though.  Dorothy agreed that it was not too buttery, but she noted it tasted better as she finished the fish.

Yeah, it gets long. On Friday night at 8:00 pm, the waiting list was 55 people deep. \\n\\nI also need to recognize Jason in the FOH, who is consistently so friendly, so helpful and so attentive despite the packed house. He keeps track of everything: when to clear silverware, when you need another beer, when your next plate is arriving. He noticed, for example,  that our dessert was taking a little bit longer than what was expected and stopped by to let us know it was on the way.

Apparently, this place can make it happen. First off, if you are looking for a more cheaper and authentic East Asian food experience, this is NOT the place that I would recommend. However, if you are looking for some tasty Asian food with a somewhat different flair done by a sophisticated and smart lady and a crafty and cunning gentleman, along with the style of small dishes, then this place may have your answer. \\n\\nA lady that I know, along with her friends wanted to come here, and asked around if anyone is interested in going. I decided to go. \\n\\nI went with a group of 11, including me. I sat with 4 ladies and a guy at one table, while 2 guys and 3 ladies sat at the other table. It was a Sunday evening, so they were offering this special of $1 oysters. My table ordered 2 dozen oysters, which is 24 in total. Presentation of the oysters was impressive. They used a long Japanese-style Bento Box for 6 oysters per plate. The sauce provided made the oysters really tasty, and it brought back a tiny bit of good memories of eating Cantonese style oysters. \\n\\nAs for food, we got the following: Dan Dan Noodles, Cantonese Lacquered BBQ Pork, Tea-Smoked Pork Spare Ribs, 3 orders of the Braised Pork Belly Buns, the Asian-Braised Short Rib Soft Tacos, Organic Red Miso Glazed Carrots, and the Spicy Silky Tofu.\\n\\nThe Dan Dan Noodles were tasty, had a nice peanut taste and a nice spice in the flavor. The texture of the Udon noodles was good. The Cantonese pork definitely tasted different compared to any Cantonese BBQ pork I had at a typical Chinese barbecue restaurant, but it had a nice, slightly tangy flavor that made it really tasty and unique. I actually liked the Tea-Smoked spare ribs, despite the slight burnt taste. The meat was very easy to tear off the bone, which was excellent, just how I want my spare ribs. \\n\\nThe Braised Pork Belly Buns were really good, I loved the soft texture of the steamed bun, combined with the flavor of the tender pork. The brandy hoisin sauce and the house pickle made the bun and pork even tastier. The Tacos were just decent, I thought the tortilla tasted plain, but I liked the salsa flavor inside. As for the carrots, I liked the flavor and the texture and I thought the carrots were cooked just right. As for the Silky Tofu, I thought the Shanghai bok choy inside was freshly cooked, and the tofu was nice and soft. The flavor had a lot of spice that made me want to drink some more water. If I had a bowl of rice, it would be a great complement to the spicy tofu. \\n\\nWe had a Chocolate Mousse for dessert, and it was pretty good. The chocolate had a nice richness and sweetness. My stomach was a little full, but it was still ready to eat more food. As for the prices, it was fairly expensive, the 6 people, including me had to pay $27 per person, including tax and tip. \\n\\nService was really good, the servers were really courteous. Interior and atmosphere was very modern. I did not feel that I was in a restaurant in Boston, more like a contemporary restaurant in New York, Toronto, or San Francisco. The seats were also really comfortable. The music selection was interesting. They were playing a lot of hip-hop and R&B by Jay-Z, Beyonce, and Ciara. \\n\\nOverall, if you are looking for some sophistication and a unique flair in the flavor of East Asian food, along with a contemporary 21st Century Western atmosphere, then this is a good choice. If you are on a tight budget, looking for a more authentic Asian food experience, and you want to get your stomach really full while eating at this place, then prepare to be shocked and disappointed."},{"name":"Southland Whiskey Kitchen","address":"1422 NW 23rd Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"I went on a really nice date here for dinner and the atmosphere is wonderful, laid back yet tasteful.

Initially, I wasn't sure that the \\"down-home\\" feel of the restaurant and menu justified entrees that averaged $20+. But here's the thing, the restaurant might feel like an industrial-sized tourist trap, but the kitchen can cook, and sends out much better-than-shack quality fare. Whatever seafood we've ordered, it's just about always come out fresh, cooked correctly, and vibrantly flavored. This place might be called the \\"Summer Shack,\\" but it goes well-beyond traditional summer shack quality, creativity levels, and execution, even if it blows shack price points out of the water a bit.\\n\\nThe interior is huge and open with a somewhat gimmicky New England-style. Somehow, it all works--the place can get seriously loud, but it still doesn't feel offensive. Waiters are casual and friendly, but service is always competent. The lobster tanks and pots, though full of lobsters, don't make the place smell too much like a wharf (at least in my experience). And, though they sell Summer Shack t-shirts at the front of the restaurant, eating here has never made me feel too much like a tourist. I don't get it, and that's probably a good thing. \\n\\nWhen it comes to drinks, the Summer Shack's wine list is relatively modest, though nothing to sneer at. Options are more extensive and varied when it comes to cocktails and beers. I've been on a bit of a cocktail kick lately, so on my most recent visit ordered a glass of their red sangria, which I very much enjoyed. The beverage had a bit of an unusual sour note to it which I really liked: it wasn't traditional, but it was tasty! My sister's mango martini was also quite good and very tropical in taste, as mango martinis ought to be. \\n\\nPortions at the Summer Shack vary a bit. Generally-speaking, I'd say the appetizers are on the larger side (it's definitely a good idea to split them!) while entrees are a bit more moderate in size. Appetizer-wise, the New England clam chowder is quite tasty and well-executed, if you're looking to start out with something more traditional and small.The grilled clams are definitely worth ordering for the table, as is the spicy-fried calamari. Recently, I tried a chorizo and clam stew special which was seriously tasty, if a bit too salty. Of course, there's always the raw bar for oyster and clam lovers. The prices can go up fast when you order from there, but friends who like that type of stuff have definitely enjoyed it!\\n\\nA part of me feels like you could come to the Summer Shack for its sports bar/lounge room, order drinks, and split some appetizers. Of course, the problem with that plan is that you miss the entrees. As with the appetizers, there are a few ways you can go here. Sandwiches are one option: a family friend loves the fried fish sandwich. Personally, I'm a bit of a sucker for the Summer Shack lobster roll--the meat was tender, the roll buttered and warmed, the dressing not too heavy, and the chopped cucumber a clever touch. If you're thinking lobster, there are also a number of whole-beast preparations: the pan-roasted rendition is the house specialty and worth ordering once, even if it is seriously messy to eat. \\n\\nA third choice are the dinner plates. Out of the options on the menu, the BBQ catfish and grilled gulf shrimp have both been greatly enjoyed by friends. Personally, I was disappointed with the fish and chips and wouldn't recommend them--put simply, I've had better. There are also four or five special fish plates of the day, which are frequently a bit more upscale as far as preparations and plating go. The specials I've had a chance to sample have ranged in quality from good to very good: the plates are kept fairly simple, and the fish cooked as it should be. \\n\\nIt's not the end of the world if you don't save room for dessert--options are pretty classic all-American dishes, though they are well-executed. I kind of love the fact that they have soft serve on the menu..."},{"name":"Maenam","address":"1938 W 4th Avenue","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4","text":"My girlfriend and I have been looking forward to dine at this place, so we join their Dine Out Dinner, just to finish off our bucket list.

The GF and I had our anniversary dinner at Barley Swine last month. \\n\\nI've stalked their menu in the past and noticed that the last few months they changed to a $70/person 13 course fixed pricing. A little pricier than the old setting, but this way we both get to try a ton of food, so no biggie. \\n\\nToo many courses to breakdown in a review... \\n\\n5 star courses: unfortunately just 1... the dessert course with barley cake and brown butter cream\\n\\n4 star courses: 9 or 10 of the plates were really tasty. not mind blowingly delicious but very solid courses. A few of which were wayyyy too small however. Seems like a common complaint about Barley Swine.\\n\\n3 star courses: 2 or 3 of the courses were just okay. They do use a few overlapping elements on multiple courses. That isn't a big deal if those overlapping elements are delicious, but in this case they chose to use their whey panna cotta that I just did not care for at all. Personally, I do not understand the panna cotta movement going on in the food world. To me, its just flavored jello haha...\\n\\nThe food was good. But if your expectations were very high like mine, you may leave a little underwhelmed considering the price point. I was expecting every course to be amazing like the pork belly sliders or the grilled quail they used to serve at the Odd Duck trailer. I'm sure all fans of the original Odd Duck know what I am referring to. \\n\\nThe overall experience of this meal was pleasant. Service was good and friendly. Definitely a unique dining experience by a talented kitchen. But given the price and reputation, I expected more but it did not meet my expectations.

Her birthday wish was to sit at the bar and enjoy the ringside spectacle that is the symphony of chefly activity as the tremendously creative Barley Swine dishes are created.  We have dined at Barley Swine on at least a half-dozen previous occasions, but had never been able to score a seat at the bar.  This time, much to our delight, we were informed that one could make reservations by emailing the restaurant (info@barleyswine.com, I think).  We got a reply that evening, made a reservation for her birthday, and were advised to arrive a bit before the doors opened (6:00) to make sure that we got a seat at the bar.  \\n\\nWhen the doors opened, we were greeted by name and ushered to the first two seats at the bar.  Our heartbeats quickened as we watched the kitchen staff stoke the oak wood fire in the grill, heat up pans for the various ingredients, and generally start putting together the menu items that would become our dinner that evening. (I refer the reader to Nathan I.'s recent review of Barley Swine for a wonderfully rendered description of the current menu items.)  We had six dinner plates, two dessert plates and six (count 'em) drinks over the course of our two-hour epicurean indulgence.  The food was interesting in its creatively planned mixture of textures, flavors, colors and aromas, as well as being delicious and filling.  The German chocolate cake is as unexpected in its presentation as it is successful in satisfying the sweet tooth in us, and is not to be missed.\\n\\nFinally, as always, the service at Barley Swine is among the best in Austin.  We were provided with perfect pacing and selection of the order in which our chosen plates were presented.  The wine list is varied and affordable, and the beer list is surprisingly broad and interesting.  The servers are knowledgeable and very helpful. On a previous visit to Barley Swine, our server offered to pair my plates with interesting beer choices (based upon my general preferences).  I accepted, and was treated to a memorable evening of new food and beer experiences.  \\n\\nFrom the bus staff to the management, the service at Barley Swine made us feel appreciated, special, and pampered.

Blueberry, passionfruit and valrhona are my favs. \\n\\nButtermilk/apple fritter: Very tasty made crispy on the outside and soft on the inside like a proper cake donut should be.

Perfect ratio of peanut butter taste vs jelly. A nice balance of flavors. \\n\\nDifference from this place and Hawthorne locations is parking sucks.

We had two glasses of red wine that our waitress suggested which were both pleasant and paired well with our tapas and paella. My favorite tapas is the beef tartare! I know it might strange to many, but I felt like they flavored it really well and the texture was perfect. they had this slightly creamy sauce on top with a sprinkle of panko. The chorizo with sweet figs was pretty good- a little too sweet and vingery for my liking, but a decent dish. The croquettes were yummy of course - can't go wront with those. The grilled hanger steak was good too but I didn't find it to be AMAZING like everyone else did. I wasn't a huge fan of the mussels - that dish could've been omitted. \\nI do like the seafood paella though! and I'm very glad that this place allows you to order just one person serving unlike the paella bars in NY. I thought the paella was slightly more moist than others that I've tried, which I was okay with. I felt like it was rich with seafood flavor. The seafood was all fresh as well - really liked their squid. It's not super salty and could be on the more bland side , but actually when you keep eating it, the flavors start developing more and more and then you'll realize that they've seasoned it perfectly. \\nI wish I was here to try out their cheese and cold cut board, but that was all we had room for that day.

(Recommendation: be aggressive about getting one of these counter seats!)  Ten more minutes before ordering.  Then we waited, and waited, and waited for 45 minutes for our order to arrive.  Maybe preparing a very nice, light wild mushroom and cheddar omelette with some perfectly cooked potatoes takes time?  Or perhaps they were trying to get that oatmeal pancake just right?  (They did.)  It could be they were struggling with the buckwheat pancake before sending it out.  (They missed--it was a little dry and just not quite right.

Myer's and Chang is a restaurant for those who haven't got a clue what real chinese and malaysian cuisine entails. We ordered the edamame dumplings, lemon panko chicken, dan dan noodles and nasi goreng. The edamame dumplings were mixed with far-too bitter mustard greens and were simply god-awful. Secondly, the dan dan noodles? More like confused and sour spaghetti bolognese. If one could describe the lemon panko chicken in simple terms: a microwaved chicken breast from the frozen section of shaws slathered in cheap lemon jam would be the most accurate description. Last and certainly the least, the nasi goreng-an insult to South East Asian cooking. I don't even want to start describing this dish. \\n\\nHowever, the service was incredible. The waiters were friendly and consistent. The decor was somewhat visually appealing however this was probably a ploy to distract its customers from its below standard cooking. \\n\\nAll in all, if you want to eat well-please don't go here."},{"name":"Verde Cocina","address":"524 NW 14th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"I was so looking forward to trying this place based on the emphasis on local, quality ingredients and creative-looking menu. It may have been an off night, but I had terrible service and my meal was disappointing.\\n\\nWhen I arrived on a Friday, I was told the wait for two would be 30 mins. We weren't offered a seat at the bar, so I assumed those seats were also included in the wait list. Our wait ended up being more like 45 minutes. At the 20 minute mark a group of 4 showed up and were seated immediately with no reservation, presumably at the table they were otherwise planning to give to us. The bar was also open - why didn't the hostess invite us to have our meal there or at least have a drink while we wait?\\n\\nI ordered a glass of wine, which was forgotten until our meal arrived. I ordered the Verde Market Salad, which did not come out ahead of my entree as requested. To be clear, the salad is described as \\"Seasonal market veggies over mixed greens. Housemade vinaigrette using extra virgin olive oil.\\" Instead, I received a small pile of mixed greens covered in strawberries and apples slathered in a too-sweet dressing that might as well have been syrup. When I mentioned to the waitress that I was expecting a savory vegetable salad, she argued that it's just the freshest local ingredients at the market. (Sorry but Oregon strawberries won't be in season for another few months, apples in the fall). If you're out of veggies, SAY SO - don't dip into the desert toppings and call it good.\\n\\nFinally, the check. After paying we stuck around for a while to finish our drinks. The waitress ran over 20 minutes after we'd paid and said she ran us for the wrong bill. SO we had to pull out our cards again and pay about $20 more for what I already thought was an overpriced meal. In Portland you either expect excellent or rude waiters, but this one was just juvenile.\\n\\nWe should have just gone to Por Que No."},{"name":"Myers & Chang","address":"1145 Washington St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"Everything is so delicious!!!

This only intrigued me more, so we waited on the line, which actually moved fairly quickly.\\n\\nThe quick-moving first line is a bit deceiving though, as you only finally just place your order once you get to the front. You then get a number, which corresponds to a table you need to find in the large restaurant, at which point you hang out until your food is ready and delivered to your table.\\n\\nAs if it wasn't already a given, another good reason to get a shake is this potentially long wait until you get your food. They brought over my Nutella & Chocolate Pretzel Shake ($5.50) very soon after I ordered, so we got to enjoy that and fill up even more before the burgers arrived. This shake was incredible. It was super thick and had one of those bubble tea straws, which is always a good sign as you know it's gonna be incredibly thick. The crunchy pretzel bits added a nice touch to the really rich, very sweet shake.\\n\\nAfter a bit of a wait, which was expected given the massive line, our burgers and fries arrived. We tried both the Kennebec Fries ($2.75), which were the normal kind, and the Parmesan Truffle Fries ($6.50). Much to my surprise, I much preferred the crispy, piping hot Kennebec, as the Parmesan Truffle were a little too wet and therefore soggy from all that truffle oil. Based on your preference though, make sure you get at least one of them, as they were delicious and are a requisite to enjoy with a good burger.\\n\\nAs for the burger, I tried the Llano Poblano ($8.25), which was a perfectly made burger. Consisting of Angus beer, pepper jack, roasted poblano chiles, apple-smoked bacon and chipotle mayo, it was just so good in every way. The bun help up nicely against the massive patty and all those ingredients. The meat was cooked to a perfect temperature with just a bit of pink. The patty was seasoned well and had a ton of flavor that even came through with all that cheese and bacon on top.\\n\\nThe burgers and shakes here are top-notch. There's a reason it has 2,000+ solid Yelp reviews, so make sure you come here to try it too, and don't be deterred by the sure-to-be long lines."},{"name":"FLIP burger boutique","address":"1587 Howell Mill Rd","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"I have had dreams about the milkshakes at this place.

I arrived soon after it opened at 0700, and it wasn't difficult to find space to work. Outlets appeared to be in sufficient supply for everyone who needed one, and the wireless signal was reliable. The clientele appeared divided between those who ordered and hung around for a while and those that were simply passing through and took their purchases to go.

Make no mistake, while I'm technically an omnivore, eating green stuff to keep the pipes clean and help keep the well-oiled machine at 100%, I love meat.  On my 2nd Annual New England Domination Tour, I had the opportunity to chug some meat NE style, courtesy of a local chain called Kelly's (see \\"Good Will Hunting\\").  \\n\\nTired after a long flight, my homie offers to stop at Kelly's while on the way back to his house.  Its kelly-green sign shining like beacon in the cold New England night, I had no choice but to heed its beefy siren song.  Pulling up to the drive-thru and scanning the menu with my jet-lagged eyes, I see it - large roast beef.  With Swiss.  The lady asks if we want salt & pepper on the side...uh, sure, I guess.  After paying at the first window, we pull up to the second, where we quickly grab the bag and scoot home.  \\n\\nAfter about 20 or so minutes we get to his house, where the first order of business is tearing into that sandwich.  Saying hi to his wife can wait.  The clear plastic container it was packed in made it seem a little more upscale than the paper-wrapped examples you'd get at a place like Arby's.  And upon closer examination, it's definitely more upscale.  The sesame seed bin alone was bigger than a typical Arby's roast beef.  And the beef itself was actual honest to goodness roast beef, rare, with ragged edges here and there, suggesting it actually came off an actual slab of beef, and not a processed cylinder of meat-like substance. \\n\\n Taking a bite, the beef isn't bad; soft, but not too fatty, and beefy.  The Swiss was typical Swiss, giving a nutty, buttery bite at the end.  I was glad they asked if we wanted salt and pepper on the side, since they seem to take the minimalist approach to roast beef, applying minimal seasoning.  Cool with me, since I just want to taste the meat.  I sprinkle on a little bit of salt and pepper from the packets and get back to work.  \\n\\nSo, would I go back?  Sure I would...it's beef.  While their roast beef sandwiches are simple...just beef and a bun (cheese extra), as the saying goes, sometimes less is more.  Because sometimes you don't want lettuce, dry rubs, sauces, or other fancy things getting between a man and his meat."},{"name":"NAPA Kitchen + Bar","address":"7148 Muirfield Dr","city":"Dublin","stars":"4","text":"This is a new place in Dublin that just opened a few month ago.

The olive oil drizzle and pepper flake seasoning were on point and fresh! Don't be scared, grab your fork and dig in. The next dish in our 30 minute extravaganza was the meat and cheese plate, charcuterie board. Fontina and monchego cheese, kalamata olives, salami from Italy, prosciutto, coba, chorizo, fresh mozzarella and roasted tomatoes with balsamic drizzle, grilled (served cold) eggplant, and grilled bread with olive oil. Classic and a great way to share simply tasty food with the table. Finally, we ended our meal with the Shrimp, Artichoke, and mushroom appetizer with a curry cream sauce. This was our one warm dish and was a perfect finish. The sangria was refreshing and partnered well with both the octopus and the charcuterie plate.

I think there is only so much room for improvement here and others have already found that space. However, the flavors of the frosting and toppings are what set Blue Star apart. The raspberry frosting is juicy and perfectly sweet. The chocolate ganache is rich and dark. \\n\\nThe donuts themselves are not cheap and waits can be surprisingly long- lines don't move quickly.

I would like to also note that I worked in the service industry in the past for 12 years so I am a very understanding person. I went for dinner with my sister on a non-game night and it was a little busy. There was a 30 minute wait, although there were several open tables. The host and hostesses were friendly as well as the bartenders while we were waiting. \\n\\nWe were sat within the 30 minutes and were greeted about 10 minutes after we sat.   We ordered after our server brought us waters- we already had beers from the bar.  After we ordered, we didn't see our server for about 35 minutes, then he came over and said that the kitchen is backed up so our food is taking longer that it's supposed to. I said \\"that's ok, no worries\\", as I understand that can happen.  \\n\\nAnother 30 minutes go by and no sign of the server. My sister went up to the host stand and let them know that we still have not received our food and we don't know where our server is. They went to get him and he came over and said that our food was brought to the wrong table and he JUST NOW reordered it. My first thought was- why is this just now being discovered? That's not realistic. He also  said that a manager will be over and that they are comping our meals and he brought us both another beer. \\n\\nOur food took another 30 minutes. My Salmon was ok, but my sisters Filet was well done and she ordered it medium. At this point, we are starving, irritated, and shocked by our experience thus far. Our server never came back to ask us how our meals were, the manager NEVER came to the table. The server finally came over when we were almost done and I told him that we never saw a manager, and that my sisters steak was way over cooked and that this was the worst experience I've ever had, and I eat out all the time. His response was \\"that's why we are paying for your meals\\". I was totally offended. He obviously didn't care that we waited so long that we were sick to our stomachs. He thought that it was excusable because they comped my meal. I would rather have paid for my meal and received it within a reasonable amount of time. \\n\\nThey had many opportunities to redeem themselves, for example; 1. If they were to check on our table more and they could have caught the mistake of dropping the ball with ordering or reordering our meals (who knows what really happened). 2. They could have offers us side salads or something to tie us over while we waited over an hour and a half for our food. 3. A manager could have dropped by to check on us and apologize for the inexcusable poor service we received. None of that happened. They failed horribly!

There was also a ship named the Warren Jr anchored next to the restaurant, which was perfect for pictures.I can just imagine what it would be like with a nice summer sunset. \\n\\nBUILDING/CLEANLINESS \\nThe building is very clean, didn't look grungy or cheap, no dirty seats, no messy floors, no rusty outdoor seating, no dirty utensils, nothing floating in our drinks, no hair in our food, just clean. the indoor seating (though we sat outside on the rooftop) was gorgeous and the design of the building was built almost upwards, very different and I loved it. The rooftop area was soso cute. Tad confusing to find because it was set back on like a dock. But whatever.\\n\\nFOOD\\nThe food was absolutely delicious. As I said we went for brunch and they're menu is a good size for breakfast and lunch on one menu. Everyone loved their meal and trust me we are very high food critics, we know good food, homemade everything at home. I got the Fried Goat Cheese Salad and loved it. It wasn't typical romain or iceberg lettuce so that's a plus and the goat cheese being fried came in a small fried ball on top similar to a risotto ball but obviously cold soft and fluffy goat cheese not rice and cheese. The French toast was unbelievable, not too eggy tasting which was a plus for me. For a meal I ordered the crab cakes (2 to a plate but medium sized) which I am very picky with but these were fantastic. They were almost like shredded crab to perfection with a tad onion pieces big enough to pick out without ruining it which I did but still perfect. On top were I think shredded potato slices. Also make your own Mimosas and Bellinis champagne with side of orange juice and 1 strawberry pur√©e and another peach pur√©e.\\n\\n\\nSERVICE\\nService I don't know if it was just our waitress but it was kinda slow at first. She didn't come back for a good 15 min after giving us water didn't tell us the special and didn't ask us if we wanted anything different to drink other than a bottle of champagne ordered and water.

The food did come out pretty quick in my opinion not super quick but medium. \\n\\nPARKING \\nGood amount of space for parking\\n\\nLOCATION\\nVery good, close to North End so we popped in there after.

We also split an order of gyoza which is always delish. (If you like things spicy, try mixing some togarashi in with your gyoza dipping sauce!) Also, we both find the regular size bowls to be enough for two meals and usually bring home leftovers, and the ramen is still incredible the second day!

I ordered the seafood alfredo.  The menu states that the pasta is chef's choice so I just assumed that I would get spaghetti, linguine, angel hair, penne, etc.  Nope, it was lasagna.  Had I know that I definitely would not have ordered it.  Guess I should have clarified since our server was obviously not the most proactive guy we've ever met.  My husband ended up having the Mediterranean salad and he did enjoy it.  My seafood lasagna was pretty unappetizing.

The pancakes themselves hardly had any flavor, they were a decent size but came with 3 small slivers of banana and about a tablespoon of banana foster sauce that only covered one pancake and left the other completely dry. The sauce itself was extremely sour, indicating there was too much liquor in the sauce itself that once again completely overpowered everything else. For the price it's a completely disappointment too, $8.49 for two pancakes that only have 1/8th of a banana, a tablespoon of sauce, is completely ludicrous.

It was highly recommended by the internet and not too far from our Airbnb, so we gave it a shot. \\n\\nAmbiance - Busy. Medina Cafe was sooooo busy. Especially for brunch. By the time we had arrived there and gotten our name down, the wait time was 45 minutes for two people. Luckily we weren't too hungry and ended up checking out some of the nearby stores. The inside is nice and cute, sort of rustic looking with a little cafe area and Belgian waffles proudly displayed. Brightly lit with plenty of windows, Medina Cafe also wasn't too loud either despite the sheer amount of people. \\n\\nService - Despite the large number of people coming in and out, the host and waitress were attentive and always friendly. It's pretty amazing how good they were and how often our waters were being filled.   \\n\\nFood - We had a milk hot chocolate lavender, Saumon Fume, Fricass√©e, and a waffle with the White Chocolate Pistachio Rosewater topping (Thanks fellow yelpers for the recommendation). The hot chocolate was amazing with the right amount of sweetness and lavender. Perfect for a cold, rainy day outside. The Saumon Fume was also good and it came with a lot of avocados (which is good if love avocados, which I do). My boyfriend thought the Fricassee was good as well, but liked the Saumon Fume much better because it had a unique taste. Hands down, the waffle with the white chocolate topping was the BEST. Sweet, but not too sweet adn the waffle was nice and crispy on the outside but soft on the inside. My heart fell when we finished the one waffle we had ordered and I desperately wanted to order another one, but alas (I should have though, I SHOULD HAVE). \\n\\nPricing - A bit pricey but nothing out of the norm for some good, healthy food. \\n\\nOverall, it was a good experience and I would highly recommend Medina Cafe. Please try the waffles and white chocolate topping, I promise that you will not regret it. If I am ever in Vancouver again, you bet it will be a place I will be visiting again and I WILL be ordering more waffles (and maybe a couple more to go too)."},{"name":"Sokongdong Tofu & BBQ","address":"2850 SE 82nd Ave, Ste 11","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Poor Service led to us walking out after we sat for five minutes, got waters/menu from the busser, and then sat for twenty minutes more.

Orinoco has a great Latin vibe with great decorations and terrific music.  You can have a fun dinner with friends or a romantic meal.\\n\\nThe bar prepares great mojitos and caipirinhas. \\n\\nThe food is authentic Venezuelan with an emphasis on flavorful grilled meats.  My mom is Colombian but spent time in Venezuela and says it's quite authentic.  The arepas (thick tortilla-like, stuffed with meat or cheese) are not to be missed.  In particular, the mechada is stuffed with marinated shredded beef that is will leave you wondering why you did not order another 10.  The empanadas are also delicious.  If you do not like meat, they service empanadas stuffed with marinated mushrooms or great salads.  Their signature dish is the pabellon criollo which is the national dish of Venezuela and consists of savory shredded beef, sweet plantains, rice, and black beans.  All portions are quite generous so bring an appetite.  My favorite dish is the lomito which is a large serving of perfectly cooked beef tenderloin with melted guayanese cheese.  I always set out to try something different but it's so good that I always end up ordering it.  \\n\\nFor desert, their molten chocolate cake comes piping hot (takes 15 minutes to prepare) and is moist and quite literally molten in the middle.  The chocolate is dark, dense, and much higher quality than the typical molten chocolate cake you will get elsewhere.\\n\\nOrinoco's prices are quite reasonable especially considering the excellent ingredients and large portions.
