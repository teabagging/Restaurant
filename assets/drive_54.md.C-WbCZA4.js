We got here on a Sunday afternoon at 1PM and waited an hour to be seated. Here's what upset us. My friend called earlier and asked if she could make a reservation, and the person on the phone said, \\"at around 1pm you should be okay, so no need to make a reservation\\"...Highly unlikely, but we went with it. And then we waited an hour....We waited an hour when we could have made a reservation earlier when were were about to! Strike one.\\n\\nWe were seated right next to the fresh oysters - great location right in the middle of the restaurant!  We ordered quickly, and patiently waited for our food. The oysters and shrimp cocktails came out in an acceptable timely manner, and the oysters were FANTASTIC. I don't think I've ever tasted oysters that were so juicy and flavorful! The shrimp was so BIG and CHEWY (in a good way)!! They were unlike any shrimp I've tasted and they were delicoiusssss yummmm\\n\\nNext. We were finished with all our oysters and shrimp. They were super quick to clear the table. however...they were terrible with coordinating the timing of the meal. We waited nearly 40 minutes for our meals to come out after they cleared our table. It may have been more....I drank all my water twice!! A restaurant of this scale should be aware that the timing of meals is so important! Strike two.\\n\\nWe also noticed that the servers were bringing the food from upstairs since we saw them running down the stairs with hands full of food! Is this efficient for a restaurant? The food won't cool?\\n\\nAnyways, the food came out:\\nFish & chips - WOWWWWWW these were better than the fish & chips I tried in London, no joke...Okay, now I may understand why the food took SO LONG to come out...these fish were definitely FRESH, and not frozen previously. the fish was sosososo juicy and the outside was crispy and MMMMMM. I was also sad that they spilled my sauce all over the fries when my food was served. I'm telling you, making your servers run down the stairs can't be a smart idea. Ugh. I can't even hate because the fish was so good.\\n\\nFried clams: Ehh.....The clams were fried too much, to the point where you couldn't taste the clams because the fried coating outside was too crispy and thick. This is not the right way to fry clams....If you want good fried clams, goto Atlantic Fish Company.\\n\\nLobster omelette - I didn't try this dish, but it was served beautifully and seemed like a great brunch item. Unfortunately, there were barely any lobster in the omelette, and I don't think my company liked them very much.\\n\\nFish sandwich - I am ashamed to say that I always order a fish sandwich at Burger King or McDonalds......lol And so this dish looked soooo delicious, and my company said so as well! Would love to try some next time when I'm not so full from the fish & chips.\\n\\nAll in all, if the fish & chips, and the oysters & shrimp didn't save my experience, I would have given this place at most 2 stars. However, the oysters were THE BEST oysters I've ever tasted, and the fish and chips were also THE BEST. Just for these two dishes I would love to go back and hopefully have a nicer experience."},{"name":"Moonshine Patio Bar & Grill","address":"303 Red River St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"Nice atmosphere, but mediocre food.

These were not flavors I expected to work together, but they were perfect.\\n\\nShakshuka: I'm not even sure how to describe. Mediterranean ratatouille with a fried egg, perhaps? There were vegetable, tomato sauce, fried egg, and pita to soak it all up. It wasn't my favorite dish, but by no means bad either.\\n\\nDuck confit fries: I think everybody else liked this way more than I did. It was mostly gravy and peas, I'm sure there was a lot of duck fat mixed in that I was not appreciating, but it could've used some more duck. \\n\\nRainbow salad: My second favorite of the night, after pork belly. Perfectly dressed and the pretzel croutons were the right amount of crunch for the rest of the dish. \\n\\nCatfish po-boy: This was my only true miss of the night. The bun was all wrong for a po-boy and there wasn't enough remoulade. Too much slaw and the catfish was too bland, probably due to the lack of remoulade.

I don't go into Starbucks because people on too much caffeine irritate me and maybe that's what was going on here.  Beyond that, we were offered one shot glass of ketchup for 3 orders of eggs and potatoes that didn't come for 2 minutes after we got our lukewarm food because she stopped to tally some checks on the way.  She never came back to see if we needed anything until 2 of us had completely finished eating and the 3rd had like 3 bites left (we wanted more ketchup dang-it).  None of this would really matter if their prices were reasonable (they aren't) or if this time they hadn't skimped on the portions.  \\nWhat she did do instead of checking on us was eat some food with the cook, have a conversation with a guy who seemed like maybe the owner or her husband and answer a ton of phone calls and tell people they were closing 2 hours early because they ran out of eggs and peppers as they were super busy.  I thought maybe I should tell them about Fred Meyer and cars.  \\nI mentioned when paying that my son didn't get his berries for his pancakes ($9 for 3 6in pancakes).  The cook said they were inside and seemed kind of ticked off (ok, I didn't get that because the server described them as being on top... maybe it was my bad hearing- my bad I guess).\\nAnyway, I've worked in restaurants for 9 years and I get that when you have a really busy shift you probably don't care what the people at the end of it see or think because you are exhausted.

The lighting is off somehow.  For the prices and upscale nature of the restaurant, the decor including the tables and chairs, and tube lighting really brought it down a notch.  I was very pleased to have the private room as I had arranged a work function.  \\n\\nWe had the tasting menu, which was approximately $100 a person and it was light on the food, which was expected, but most everything was good.   However, the scallops were awful.  I don't think anyone in our party ate their entire serving.  They tasted fishy and were very chewy.  For some reason, that dish is all I can remember even though the rest of dinner was pretty good.

As an ex sushi chef, this place was the biggest embarrassment I've ever been to. Even worse than grocery store, gas station, and buffet sushi; and that's saying something right there. When we first walked in, no body greeted us. It took ten minutes for us to get any drinks and we never saw the waitress again. She didn't explain how anything worked around there either. Most of the plates I couldn't even identify which is sad considering I'm in the business of sushi making. To make matters worse, a lot of the sushi looked old and was falling apart. I decided that a simple roll would be the least likely to be too old, so I tried a California roll. It was sloppily made and was almost room temperature. I was very unimpressed. I then made the mistake of trying what I'm guessing was supposed to be a cream cheese roll. It has been sitting there so long that the fish was slimy, the cream cheese was melting and gooey, the rice was slimy, and the roll was literally above room temperature, almost even warm. Needless to say, serving raw fish warm is not only bad business, but 100% unacceptable and against the law in the food service industry. Absolutely disgusting. I don't know how such an establishment can still be open and how they haven't killed anyone yet.

At first, we were greeted by a not-so-friendly host and then also not helped out by a very neutral bartender.  We were awkwardly loitering, waiting for a table, when a hostess offered for us to order oysters while we waited.  It was really nice of her and she even offered to bring us chairs to sit at near the front!  A++++++ for the two female hostesses working last night - you both were so nice and helpful!  \\n(2) The oysters were fresh and decently well-shucked.\\n\\nThe meh:  \\n(1)  It's expensive.  I don't know why people would say it's not.  The majority of oysters are $3 on that menu.  I saw a couple $2.50, and two at $2 (not surprisingly, Island Creek Oysters are one of two much cheaper oysters on the menu).  I understand that West Coast Oysters are not cheap, but quite honestly I can order Hama Hamas myself directly from the farmer and have it come out to around $2 per oyster including shipping.\\n(2)  It's packed.  From what I understand, this is pretty much ALWAYS the case.  And oddly enough, I'd say 60% of the patrons were 45+, 38% were 35-45, and 2% were younger than 35.  It's a bar packed with a significantly older crowd.\\n(3)  Lobster roll was better this time - at least in that the meat was fully cooked.  However, I felt the lobster salad was heavy on the mayo and heavy on the celery.  There also seemed to be some other spice on the top (nutmeg?)  That was out of place.  Cold lobster rolls are not, and should not be, gourmet.  Just go classic!!\\n(4)  My biggest issue with my visit was that my waiter could not tell me which oyster was which.

That's exactly what I want to look at, thanks.\\n\\nA woman walks by & I ask her what I have on my card.  She brings me a summary on receipt paper.  It has the two deserts & $25 in points I've earned.  \\n\\nWe pick the manjari mousse & the molten chocolate cake.  We're still deciding what to do with the $25 when the waitress comes so we order the deserts and ask her to come back for a second round.  My finale card is out on the table from before.  When the waitress finally returns we order some booze, & to be cautious I ask if my points will go toward booze, showing her the summary.  She says the points will work for booze, but I can't do both deserts at the same time and also the manjari mousse is exempt because it's $11.99 and the free deserts must be $10.99 and under. o_O\\n\\nSo I say, \\"so you're telling me that because my birthday is in July I get one less free desert than everyone else?\\"  She gets flustered and defensive starting to say it's not her call so I just tell her to get the manager.  \\n\\nThe manager takes her dear sweet time getting to our table and when she does I tell her about the deserts.  I wanted to also tell her how unimpressed we were with EVERYTHING that evening but didn't get an opportunity.  She told me that I could still have the two free deserts but not on the same day.  And I said \\"so you mean I have to go out of my way to come back twice in the same month?\\" She wasn't necessarily wrong about this - technically I wasn't getting anything less than anybody else - in isolation I would have let it go, but I was already pissed off about everything else that had gone wrong that evening.  Frankly at this point our leisurely, ambient good time was ruined already.  FURTHERMORE this manager is the same woman who ran the receipt before & didn't bother to say anything about not being able to use the deserts together BEFORE we ordered!  If she had handled it right I would have probably sucked it up BUT THEN...\\n\\nShe said \\"It's OUR promotion and the free deserts are a privilege.\\"  a WHAT?  A WHAT WHAT?  Are you KIDDING me?  Excuse me, no.  I'm a paying repeat customer.  You offer this as a marketing ploy to get me to come in more frequently & spend more money with the intent that you will profit from it.  You perform a cost benefits analysis and have assessed that the profits you will make from this outweigh the losses.  Don't you DARE tell me that it's a \\"privilege\\" you are benevolently bestowing upon me.  She clearly just misspoke and didn't think about i beforehand, but that pissed me off so much and both my friends, who are usually super easygoing, were taken aback, too.  So I turned to them and said \\"do you guys just wanna walk out?\\"  What does the manager do at this point?  LEAVES.  Clearly she was more concerned about her private party upstairs.  Never mind the fact that it's clear from my card that I'm a repeat customer who spends a lot here, one whom it's in their best interest to retain.  So I never got to explain to this woman that we weren't just pissed about the promotions but about the entire evening.  Also, if the free desert is only $10.99 and down...why wouldn't you charge us an extra dollar for the manjari mousse and comp. $10.99 of it so that we can actually eat what we want to eat?  So we walked out."},{"name":"Slappy Cakes","address":"4246 SE Belmont St","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"I know many who have eaten here love the whole concept and good food. My review is a word of warning, to those who are gluten intolerant. My wife and I took our grandson to Slappy Cakes for a fun breakfast this morning. (July 26, 2016 approx. 10:15am)\\nI had the Buttermilk batter, and grandson the peanut butter batter, which was very good. My wife is moderately gluten intolerant, (gets \\"flu symptoms\\" and ends up in bed for 2-3 days). She ordered the 'Gluten Free\\" butter milk batter with lemon curd sauce. Was assured that all would be safe, as the gluten free butter milk cakes must be prepared in the kitchen, not at the table griddle. When her meal arrived cooked from the kitchen, it looked very good. Even brought to the table alone and addressed as gluten free cakes. About half way through eating the cakes, our waitress asked us how we were enjoying the meal, and how good the gluten free batter was. About 3 mins later, she returned the table to tell us the she was so sorry, but those gluten free cakes, are NOT gluten free!! She had noticed how \\"fluffy\\" they looked and went to the kitchen to ask the cook if he used gluten free batter. No!! he had not... So either the waitress did not tell him or he 'forgot'.... She said she was very sorry, but my wife had just been POISONED with GLUTEN batter.\\nTwo hours later, we are home and wife is in bed sick and not expected to go anywhere, for the next 2 days. (She had an important meeting to attend to tonight)\\nThe waitress comped her meal ONLY, but the manager NEVER came to our table to represent the company to apologize. \\nSo... Word to the wise.... If you are gluten intolerant, NO NOT trust Slappy  Cakes to bring to the table a gluten free meal. Ask repeatedly to be certain you are getting what you expect....."},{"name":"Jolly Roger","address":"1340 S E 12th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Game 6 of kings playoffs, and claudias has it on a tiny tv.

I had the steak with poached eggs and home fries.  Steak was cooked perfectly since it was steak tips.  Hubby had the chilaquiles which is like a Mexican fusion with tortillas and scrambled eggs, cheese, and black beans.  He thought it was good.  My daughter had the bread pudding French toast and that was really good and basically will satiate your sweet tooth.  But the most recent brunch was completely the OPPOSITE!  Ordered the special which was eggs Benedict with prosciutto, asparagus, and ramps.  First, no Hollandaise sauce so I had to ask for it.

My daughter ordered steak and eggs and ordered the steak medium but it was cooked to death that it was tough and chewy!  Secondly the steak wasn't tips.  They gave us two silver dollar size hangar steak which means when cooked over well done, it will be tough.  People that haven't gone to culinary school knows that so why would the cooks their cook it to death?!  The homefries that came with the steak was also completely burnt to a crisp that my daughter couldn't chew on it.   The only saving grace of the whole experience was the bloody Mary that I ordered.  It was perfect and spicy and was praying that it would kill anything that was in the undercooked eggs!  That being said,  I don't think that we would be going back for brunch there again.

My Coolidge favorite, the Regal Beagle, was predictably packed, so this was the second choice.\\n\\nTo be brief: bad service, no ambience, and insects.\\n\\nTo be elaborate: We were taken upstairs, a space I did not know existed. It looks unloved, is too bright, and was eerily quiet, without music and only the sounds of pots and pans from the adjoining kitchen. We were one of only two tables, and yet it took some time to see our server, a nervous young woman who seemed to be having her first night unchaperoned as a waitress. We each ordered a cocktail and ordered two plates (a salad and a pizza) to share. Again, though the restaurant was quiet, it was some time before we saw our food. The \\"arugala\\" salad is mostly spinach, and my friend had asked that the goat cheese be put on the side, which then didn't come with the meal and had to be requested. When we placed a wine order at the time of the food's arrival, the waitress told us, \\"we don't have that\\" for four different glasses (at which point, many restaurants would comp a glass or two for the table, but that was not offered). When she checked on us about five minutes after the food arrived, she immediately asked us if we knew what we wanted for dessert. Since it was still early enough that we were nowhere near in danger of the kitchen closing, I responded no, and she said, Okay, just checking\\" and walked away. When we did order dessert, we were given a single spoon, and though I love my friend, I did not feel like spoon-feeding her molten chocolate cake. The waitress looked baffled when I asked for a second one, and then she delivered not only a second spoon, but also forks and knives.\\n\\nBeyond the bad service, the most off-putting (and frankly, mildly awful) element of the evening was that we were dive-bombed by dozens of fruit flies throughout the night.

Not wanting pizza I ordered chicken alfredo pasta. The garlic knots were OK but they were dripping in tons of oil. Not as garlicky as I would have expected (which says a lot seeing as how I am not a big fan of garlic). \\n\\nMy husband had a slice of each flavor of pizza, so I took a bite of each of his slices. Was not impressed with the flavors of any of them and the toppings were really skimpy. The worst is yet to come however. My group got the four pizzas and were finished eating  and I still had not gotten my chicken alfredo. I kept asking the waitress and she kept assuring me it was coming. I had gotten my side salad and garlic knots which came with my order. \\n\\nAfter about 8-9 inquiries wondering where my order was and almost 50 minutes (not exaggerating) after ordering my food the waitress finally brought me a small bowl of pasta. I took one look at it and thought she had brought the wrong thing.  I got her attention and asked her \\"Are you sure this is the chicken alfredo I ordered? It looks like pesto not alfredo.\\" The waitress insisted it was the alfredo. Then I looked through the pasta and said, \\"I don't see any chicken.

This place never disappoints!"},{"name":"JW Marriott Orlando, Grande Lakes","address":"4040 Central Florida Pkwy","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"I found this place to be just okay.  Not bad, not great, but just okay.\\nThe staff was nice, and the lobby was impressive, but in truth, I don't really care much about those things.  I expect a room to have attention to the details.  That is the space I live in while I am there.  Lakes, fountains, and marble are nice, but they aren't where I spend my downtime.\\nPersonally, I found the Marriott to be a bit of flash without much substance.  It makes an impressive first impression, but it that's about all.\\nWhy am I so... well, eh?  There are many reasons... most of them fall into the picky range, but when you add them all up, it makes an overall... eh impression.  \\n\\nPicky things that annoyed me: \\n\\nno free wifi in the rooms... in 2013, you would think a hotel would provide its guests at this price point free wifi. \\n\\nYou have to pay for parking if you are a guest at the hotel.  Again, this is a picky annoyance.  I completely understand paying for parking if you are there to play golf, go to the spa, or you are in an urban location where parking is scarce... in a big open greenspace, that last one doesn't fly so much.\\n\\nRefrigerator was inoperable in the room.   I don't know if this is because the one in my room is broken, or all the refrigerators aren't being used because of a safety concern.  However, if it is the latter, pull them out of the room.  An inoperable fridge gives the place a broken down vibe.\\n\\nEvery (and I mean every) handle in the entire room was barely attached to the drawer.  You know when you ask a person who really doesn't want to do a job to attach them and they literally screw it in once... yeah.  I really don't expect to have to screw every handle I want to use in a hotel room to avoid having it come off in my hand.  Why didn't I call?  Because that's pretty bitchy to call and complain about that... but at the same time, its just one of those unsaid things that should just be done.\\n\\nThe toilets did not flush well.  I found it ironic they had energy efficient signs about the reusing towels but the toilet had to be flushed at least twice. EVERY. SINGLE. TIME.  \\n\\nMold.  in the raspberries in the breakfast buffet line.  seriously.  I told a server and she didn't remove them immediately.  A cook came out a removed them about 5-10 minutes later, but I was cringing as I watched people go through the buffet line (and no, no one else took them).  I was a bit shocked they didn't catch the obviously furry raspberries when they were put out.\\n\\nAfter all of that, the last annoyance was probably sufficient to request a room change, but after all the above, I wasn't convinced any other room was going to be much better and I could make do, but it was indicative of the cutting corners impression I had of the place by this time.  The shower wasn't sealed appropriately.  One of the very nice things about the hotel was they had a separate tub and shower.  I was taking baths, but the husband takes showers.  When he was taking a shower on his second or third day in the hotel (I cleaned up usually before him) I noticed a very steady stream of water flooding the bathroom and made him plug up the leak with a washcloth.  Whoever sealed the shower apparently decided it wasn't all that important to use caulk all the way down the entire seam.  Worse, the shower head was in a fixed place where it pointed directly at the gap.  I cannot believe we were the first people or even first dozen people to experience that in the room and if it hadn't been fixed by now, I wasn't inclined to go through the hassle of pointing it out, packing up, unpacking, or worse, having workmen come in and out when there were a million other places I would rather be on my vacation.  So, an appropriately placed washcloth plugged it up enough to avoid a Noah's Ark themed recreational site.\\n\\n\\nSo, like I said, the place was okay.  It was clean, the staff was polite, and the location was very attractive.  However, I got a major impression that it was mostly veneer and if you scratched the surface a bit, you may find out that it isn't as well run as one would hope for a place at this price range... but that was just my opinion."},{"name":"Kasbah Moroccan Cafe","address":"201 NW Davis St","city":"Portland","stars":"5","text":"The food was great!

Likewise for take-out."},{"name":"True Food Kitchen","address":"222 West Ave","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"Was really expecting more of a Snap Kitchen aesthetic and type of food. Was pleasantly surprised to find this was a whole different can of worms.\\n\\nBetween 4 of us, we ended up getting $267 of things to try and, having tasted pretty much all of it, nothing was bad. It was incredibly surprising. Only the albacore tataki starter would be something I wouldn't get again.\\n\\nPortion sizes were pretty good, drink pours were pretty strong. We went for a pre-opening shindig, so no idea if this is a good measure for 3 months down the road, but I walked away very impressed.\\n\\nI personally had the Moroccan Chicken ($23) and it was very flavorful. Good crisp to the meat. Loved that it was on a bed of chickpeas. I think they accompanied the protein well. I also had the strawberry rhubarb crisp for dessert and loved it.\\n\\nThe prices are a little steep but I think the price of the bowls was very reasonable. The menu is well rounded with many options. The idea is that it's healthy and it all felt like it while still being flavorful and plentiful.\\n\\nCocktails were all pretty unique, especially the dessert one.\\n\\nI liked the open kitchen aspect of True Foods. You can see not only your meal but everyone else's being prepared and plated. It was a nice feel.\\n\\nOur server, Michael, you could tell he was a guy that takes care of himself. Attractive guy. He has the look of a guy who, if you were judgmental, you would think he could be kinda cocky. Far from it. Incredibly nice, helpful, talked up the food well and expertly dealt with those of us looking to fully take advantage of our free situation.\\n\\nI couldn't really get a feel for if it was meant to be a \\"fine dining\\" experience or not. We were wearing t-shirts and jeans but a lot of people were pretty dressed up. I didn't feel out of place, but it had the feeling maybe it was above my means just being casual when others weren't. Maybe it was a personal thing. \\n\\nThe bathroom was spacious. Nice stalls. Trough style sink.\\n\\nThe bar service was a little slow to get the drinks to the table but I'm not going to dock them for this review. It was only day 2 and they weren't really open. If you have a similar experience, write it up. \\n\\nAnother thing to be aware of, if you're at a table with split dietary preferences, when they brought the food to the table, it didn't seem like they wrote down where the people who ordered it were seated. So, for example, a vegan has meat placed in front of them. This, again, is probably a pre-opening jitter that will be ironed out. But, for every course and drink, we had to pass everyone's order to the right person.\\n\\nAll in all, this is a place I would go again. I would probably steer away from some of the pricier items and aim for the bowls.

I usually like to eat healthier, but the first time I visited I figured I had to go all out and get what they're known for. I got The Farmer. Since I'm not the biggest biscuit sandwich person I just deconstructed it and ate the chicken and bacon separate from the biscuit. The chicken was moist and tasty and bacon had nice flavor. The biscuit was good, but to me it was a bit dense. I like mine lighter and flakier. \\n\\nOn my second visit, I went with a friend who was craving carbs but I wanted something a little healthier so I tried the Sunshine in the Garden. It it is described on their menu as such: \\"Tomatoes, shallots, fresh green peppers, topped with feta cheese, fresh basil, a *sunny side egg and a flaky biscuit.\\"  I have to say that this is one of the strangest dishes I have ever had. I imagined fresh roasted veggies as the base with eggs and cheese on top. NO. It was like they dumped 2 cans of stewed tomatoes into a bowl and put eggs on top. Seriously, like soup with eggs on top. The \\"fresh\\" basil was all brown and shriveled. The dish was lukewarm. I have no idea who decided this dish was a good idea but it was pretty terrible. As we were leaving, I saw someone else who ordered it and over half was left sitting. Maybe rethink this menu item. \\n\\nI give it 3 stars because the chicken and biscuits are pretty good and the service is top notch. When one of the workers noticed I hadn't eaten my food, she gave me a gift card to try something else next time since it was one of the pricer menu items. I would go back for the waffle, which my friend got and it was very crispy and tasty.

This is the place to go for quick, cheap, yummy home cooked italian, no strings attached. \\n\\nThat said, there are a few minor reasons why I don't rate it a 5.  1) no alcohol (nothing goes better w a nice pizza or pasta dish than a glass of red wine!) 2) no ice (if I have to have a bottled soda with my pizza can't you at least give me a cup with ice to pour it into?) 3) they usually run out of their daily specials quite early in the evening 4) they do not deliver directly (only through a third party service that charges an offensively exorbidant markup)."},{"name":"The Daily Catch","address":"323 Hanover St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"Simply put, the best fried calamari you'll ever try.

This was probably one of my favorite meals ever. So yes, for me, this place lived up to the hype. \\n\\nMy boyfriend and I planned this dinner way ahead of time, and we called to make a reservation a month before the day we wanted to go (they start taking reservations a month ahead of time). As soon as we arrived, we gave them our name and they led us to our table right away. \\n\\nNeither of us had had raw oysters before, and we were excited to try them here. We let the waiter know ahead of time that we were newbs and she right away recommended some oysters for us to try. We had the Island Creek and then two other oysters that were on the menu that evening. We LOVED them!! They were so cold, so fresh, and just tasted like the sea. I don't know how to describe these oysters other than \\"refreshing.\\" The accompaniments that came with them (cocktail sauce, garlic vinegar, lemon) were yummy but didn't mask the oyster flavor. Also, the oysters were very clean, no sand or grit was on the shell. \\n\\nFor entrees, we had the lobster roe noodles and the herb crusted cod. I know that the lobster roe noodles are everyone's favorite, and I liked them. However, they were almost TOO decadent. There was a lot of lobster meat, and also some beef, and it was very rich. I preferred my cod dish, which was perfectly cooked and on a bed of tomatoes, greens, and small potatoes seasoned with olive and caper. The taste was fresh and absolutely amazing. I wish I could have this again!\\n\\nAt the end of the meal, we were undecided about whether we wanted dessert, so we looked over the dessert menu but didn't order anything. So we were pleasently surprised when we received a complementry dessert sample before the bill. It was a lemon cake with dates, and it was yummy and light. Clearly, the staff here went above and beyond to make us feel special and make sure we had an excellent dining experience.

Mind you if I'm going to a restaurant where I have to pay 40 to 70 bucks for a steak and everything is expensive up the wazoo and as a customer, I'm expected to give a good tip, then I'm expecting EXCELLENT SERVICE!!! This WAS NOT the case. Mr. Aaron came to the table and didn't even introduce himself. My husband had to ask for his name. While he was telling us the specials and what not, he seemed like he was in a hurry. We would ask for something and it would take him forever to bring it to us. He was giving all his attention to a big party that was behind us.  He had an \\"I don't care\\" demeanor towards us. Mr. Aaron's service was very disappointing. Now, about the food....\\n\\nAppetizer-  We were given eggplant fries which were on the house. They out of this world!!! The fries had conffectionate sugar on top, which you mixed with a spicy sauce. We have two theories of why it was free. Either it was because of our anniversary or the waiter knew he was messing up.  Hopefully, it was because of our anniversary. \\n\\nSteak - Cooked to perfection. I asked for medium and was given exactly that. It was lacking in the seasoning department. I've had better tasting steak at longhorn' s\\n\\nSides -  O-VER-PRICED! Sides cost almost $10 bucks each. The mashed potatoes tasted like the ones that come in the box. The Mac and cheese were ok.\\n\\nI had high expectations for this place. I was waiting anxiously to come here, but what it caused us was anxiety. We were so disappointed. It was our anniversary and we just wanted to enjoy ourselves with great food and great service, but that was not the case. Hopefully, you will have a better experience than us."},{"name":"the Globe","address":"75 Fifth St NW","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3.5","text":"I've been for a couple of work functions (fixed appetizer menu), and for dinner, and I enjoyed it each time.

For the Vietnamese-inspired dishes on their menu, he'd say Americans are crazy for paying for something that he can find for half the price and get twice as much on NE 82nd. And $2 for rice? Forget about it. He'd probably be disgusted and fuming throughout the entire meal. To him, rice - like hot tea - should be free.\\n\\nCame in for the first time for dinner on a Monday night. It was a pleasantly breezy summer evening, and asked for a table outdoors. To our surprise, they happened to have two spots open at the counter, so we were seated right away. I knew I wanted to try the Fish Sauce Wings - I found the name alone intriguing. We also ordered the Pork Belly in Burmese Curry, and the Boar Collar with the chili/garlic fish sauce. The Boar Collar came with a small plate of fresh mustard greens \\"to cleanse the palate\\" they said. I did like that the greens were served with shaved ice to keep them crisp and fresh. I tip my hat for the added touch. Texture is very important mind you. The sauce was pretty authentic - it was a balanced mix of lime, sugar, garlic, fish sauce and chili. The texture and flavor of the Boar Collar was like flank steak, kinda chewy only maybe slightly fattier. They probably could've even used flank steak; wasn't much of a difference besides the exotic sounding protein, thus the price. Fish Sauce Wings were good, but for me, the salty and sweet flavors were off kilter, too much 'salty' not enough 'sweet.' I did like that they served the wings whole, unchopped with end piece still on. I found the serving of sticky rice pathetically small, especially for all the fish sauce they add to the food. Seriously, I don't think it was even a full cup. That's nothing. If you're gonna order rice, order the jasmine rice. More volume, same price. That's what we ordered the second time around. Pork Belly in Curry was good, although to me looked like it barely lined the bottom of the little pot it was served in. I felt like I was staring deep into a well - oh, there it is! \\n\\nI will say overall the food was good. I was impressed that a white dude managed to offer up the bold flavors that I'm accustomed to, and putting his spin on it but not compromising it by going all (gag me) Pan-Asian. The atmosphere was cool with the Christmas lights strung along the ceiling. Plus I didn't mind that we were seated closest to their smoker. The smell oddly reminded me of Vietnam, and the smoke didn't burn my eyes. But the price and portions I can't get past. Their entrees were more like tapas portions. \\n\\nThis place is over-rated. As far as I'm concerned, any popular Asian restaurant run by a white dude and frequented by Portland's yuppies and hipsters will ALWAYS be over-rated. And $2 extra just for rice?!

Fortunately for me, I wasn't dehydrated like I normally get with a high sodium item.  The flavor was heavenly.  Personally, the couple of chili flakes put on the dish I could have done without, but I could have asked for that.  The ramen noodles themselves weren't awesome, but it seems like there are some different styles that can subbed and I think I'd do that next time.

The Lobster Roe Noodles were overfilled with lobster meat but it is hard to appreciate the sweet lobster meat with all the butter and cream. Because the lobster roe is a very subtle flavor, you will barely be able to taste it in the pasta, but it's there.

When I placed the order, the waiter asked how I wanted it cooked. Medium rare, of course. But what they brought out was a medium well, almost well-done. For $24 at an Asian place, I expect my order prepared to my specs, or at least close. Attempting to flag down a server was futile. They were all idly standing by the bar chit-chatting amongst themselves. I practically had to stand up and wave across the room to catch one of their attention.

I order veggie platters  at Ethiopian, Indian and Mediterranean restaurants  and I never miss the meat....Americans are missing out on so much flavor and health depending on meat for everything. \\n\\nEverything on the platter is delicious: Hummus, Baba Ghanouj, Falaffel and Dolmas - cold grape leaves wrapped around a rice, tomato with a vinegary twang (I've never had these before but I became an instant fan)\\n\\nThe lamb I sampled with the garlic sauce will take your breath away, perfect crispy edges and charbroiled flavor...next time I come im going straight for the Gyro"},{"name":"Chick-fil-A","address":"1100 Northside Dr NW","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3","text":"Great location.

Maybe it was the difference between lunch and dinner, but the portions were indeed very small, and trying to eat family-style with seven of us at the table resulted in the etiquette dilemma of wanting to have an adequate portion without taking from the rest of the people's portions of food. Guidance from the server on appropriate ordering would have been helpful, even if it had resulted in a more expensive meal!\\n\\nDrinks:  Those drinking vinegars are fantastic! Again, a smidge pricey, but forgivable for the taste sensation.  My husband also enjoyed a drink special (or two), and we appreciated the enthusiasm and the knowledge of the server. Standard fountain drinks for the rest of the horde were mercifully available on what was a hot, September day. I wish I had known in advance that the table water was supposed to taste as it did. Served with no ice in cheap, plastic tumblers, all I could think was that it smelled as though the cups had soaked too long in rice-y dishwater and acquired a permanently odd taste. Now that I know it's flavored with the pandanus leaf, I might give it another whirl, but it'll be hard to get past the mental image. Again, better communication from the server would have been welcome. \\n\\nAmbiance: We were seated on the \\"terrace,\\" an area of covered picnic tables wedged in between the takeout window and the masses of people hovering on the sidewalk. The area was understaffed, and while the service was friendly enough, it wasn't nearly as frequent as it should have been. Again, I wondered what we were paying for, for there was absolutely nothing to make the eating space anything more than just that: a place to eat. Hard benches, shabby surroundings, and an awareness of other people waiting in line. 'Nuff said.\\n\\nWe left the meal with smiles on our faces, for we love Thai food, but  at the same time, most of us were vaguely disappointed and still somewhat hungry, despite a much lighter wallet. Considering the trek some of us made to even get there, I can't say we'll be too eager to put Pok Pok ahead of some of the other \\"must-try\\" places on our lists. That's too bad, for I think that such a highly-rated restaurant should actually represent Portland well, and I can point to plenty of others who are actually striving to do just that.

Unfortunately, it was during the Lantern Parade, so parking and getting to the restaurant was trying, but  a special occasion.  We showed up on time and waited about 10 minutes for our table, mainly due to the restaurant being extremely busy.  We were seated in the side dining room and the decor is very chic and inviting.  The server immediately waited us and got our drink orders.  We had a couple of bottles of Pinot Noir, which were great.  Then, for appetizers we had the Escargot (good) and Meatballs (Excellent). For dinner, I had the Ribeye Burger with a twice baked potato.  Both were so amazing.  The burger is a huge portion and I would not recommend it for someone who cannot eat much.  However, the ribeye was so delicious, not only for me but others in the party.  For dessert, they brought out a cookie sandwich with a candle to celebrate the birthday boy, which was very nice and and a great added touch.  Our server was excellent and completely on top on everything.  He even allowed us all to separate our bills, which can generally be an issue with larger groups.

It amazes me people dis a restaurant because the wait is too long.  If you know it's been Restaurant of the Year, shouldn't you assume it's going to be crowded?  Good grief.\\n\\nTo call this restaurant expensive is laughable.  Think about the ingredients.  They aren't getting these from Sysco.  So cut them some slack.  You want cheap, forgettable Thai food?  Definitely don't come here.  Go just about anywhere else.\\n\\nServings are not large, but having traveled in Thailand, I know that it's not typical to get a huge serving on your plate.  As Pok Pok emulates Thai street food, I don't think quantity is a goal.  Two of us typically order the fish wings, 2 dishes and 1 rice.  I leave feeling satisfied and a few times have taken home leftovers.  I usually value leftovers, but with Pok Pok, the food doesn't lend itself very well as leftovers.  Better to clean your plate.\\n\\nIf you didn't try the fish sauce chicken wings, you haven't had the best thing on the menu.  Wow, what incredible flavor.  I get the spicy, but the regular is dynomite.  I never really cared much for chicken wings.  I dream about these.\\n\\nTheir cocktails are imaginative and tasty.  I don't find them any more expensive than other places I order cocktails.  Again, you want cheap booze, head to some place like the Space Room, not Pok Pok.\\n\\nBottom line: if you want cheap, huge servings, and typically bland Thai, don't even think about this place.

She reprimanded me for not addressing the issue during my lunch break, and told me \\"I'm not surprised you didn't like the Vegetarian sandwich, you should have ordered something with flavor\\"! Now, that is a direct quote! I'm not sure in what world grilled onions and bell peppers are considered bland. Maybe I should have consumed an undercooked hamburger instead? She was indignant about my report, and said that it was impossible for my food to be undercooked, she made it herself. So, perhaps she is fallible and doesn't achieve perfection 100% of the time. Or, perhaps there is some training this store manager is lacking.

Our dining neighbors were very close but the lighting and the volume of the music gave the illusion of an intimate experience. Would highly recommend for a date. \\n\\nAnd now the food, oh my god the food. You're not going to get the average Thai faire here, no pad thai or soupy curry. No. It was like there was a party in my mouth and everyone was doing coke. Amazing, complex flavors. Everything, even the water and rice, had a unique flavor. \\n\\nI will warn about the Papaya Salad however. The night I was there it was insanely spicy. Like it's the only thing I've ever eaten that's made me cry. No amount of water could put the fire out.

I'm reasonably sure that our mutual love of cow has something to do with the longevity of our relationship. I decided he needed to have the best steak of his life. Having been there a year before when my pal came through on tour with his band, I knew this was going to knock his socks off. I wasn't wrong.\\n\\nOur server, the excellent and awesome Rodd, knew everything about the menu and wine list and was happy to steer us in the right direction. We went for the steak for 2, truffle butter sauce, brussel sprouts, creamed corn and had some oysters and lobster fritters for starters. OK, so it was overkill and somewhat of a freaking foodie marathon, but it was worth it. \\n\\nLobster fritters were crispy, creamy and an excellent way to serve up the most luxurious of crustaceans. Oysters were an impeccably perfect lot and on par with the best in the city. If this was any indication of what was about to hit our table for mains, then we were clearly in good hands. At this point, the Other Half stopped speaking and instead communicated in drools, moans of pleasure and frequently rolling his eyes into the back of his head. I can assure you this was a good thing.\\n\\nSteak for 2 was medium rare perfection. When I say \\"perfection,\\" I mean I believe that it may have been grilled by steak angels, turned with gossamer wings and blessed by God him/herself. It doesn't stop there. The truffle butter... oh my word. I wanted to ask for shots of it. If I could eat one meal for the rest of my (assuredly short) life, it would be that steak with truffle butter. Sides were incredible too, but passed in somewhat of a blur compared to that steak.\\n\\nAfter finding out it was the Other Half's birthday, Rodd brought out a dessert complete with a candle at the end. There was barely room for it, but it was eaten anyway.

The server was obviously uninterested and unwilling.\\n\\nOnce I got my steak tips and turkey tips I was even more disappointed.

One of the turkey tips I cut open had a pink sheen to it and I was so afraid it was under cooked I didn't even eat it.  The vegetables I had on the side were good (asparagus and spinach).

Counter Culture not only has it goin' on in the homemade cream cheeze department, but also with all vegan cheezes.

That is, a business model built and operated on compassion towards animals, NOT supporting the societal norm that sees animals as a source of profit.

Fast forward to a week ago, when a couple of my coworkers mentioned going to this place for lunch and offered to buy me lunch. They showed me the menu, and lo and behold, they actually had vegetarian options. And they had four! I ended up getting the tofu plate, and since they're buying me lunch, I really had nothing to lose in this situation.\\n\\nTwenty minutes or so later, in front of me was a container full of rice, vegetables, and not one, not two, but EIGHT blocks of tofu. And all were covered in tasty teriyaki sauce. The vegetables were nicely cooked and still had a crunch to them. The tofu were fried well and were covered in enough sauce, and the rice was a perfect vessel for the sauce. Overall, not bad for a free lunch. \\n\\nSo now that I know they serve a pretty darn tasty lunch, I'll definitely consider getting food from them in the future.

The prices on used books vary, but are generally pretty good. I only saw one price that gave me pause, but I suspect the book was out of print, so that's understandable that it would be higher. The selection is truly amazing. In the fantasy/sci-fi section, the A-B authors took up about as much space as the entire genre is given in most bookstores. There are tons of cookbooks, books on foreign languages, books on politics. . . you name it. The only thing that seems to not be represented much are tech books, but they have a whole separate store for technical books nearby.\\n\\nThey have computers throughout the store to help you find what you're looking for, and several information desks (which I didn't use).\\n\\nThe only thing that marred my experience was the cashier I had the first time. I asked him if he could also get my bag, which I had checked when I entered. It was only a few feet away from him, so I didn't think this was a difficult request. But he looked at me like I was handing him a dirty sock and asking him to put it in his mouth, rather than a bag check card. He was apparently dyslexic and got the number wrong. He got all pissy when I told him the bag he was handing me wasn't mine, and wasn't listening to me when I tried to point him to the correct one so the whole process took way longer than it should have.

Well it was nothing ...  NOTHINGGGG  like peking duck should be.  The pieces were cut in enormous chunks of chewy overly fatty duck.  Worse peking duck I've ever had...  maybe that's why the place calls it Beijing duck so they can say that it's not really \\"peking\\" duck...  a play on words....   \\n\\nAlso had the roast pork and the roast chicken.  Okay but totally nothing special....   What really upset me was that 2 simple dishes were also ordered which was chinese vegetables and fried rice and the restaurant decides not to serve it to us.. They literally ignored us for a good 20 minutes...  what up????  cause they wanted us to finish the duck???  we didn't eat the duck because it sucked so please... come take it away and serve the rest of the freakin food....\\n\\nI asked a lady who was clearly the owner of the joint  \\"what the deal was?\\"  Her response is that I'm just a manager and don't know...  We were completely dismissed like we were a bother to them...    The place was crowded no doubt due to the power of Yelp and the fact that maybe good chinese food just doesn't exist in Austin... Who knows... I won't be doing any more chinese around here...."},{"name":"Slappy Cakes","address":"4246 SE Belmont St","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"Now this was a fun restaurant for my wife and I to visit...

We arrived around 6:30 on a Saturday and waited for about 20 minutes. The nice thing is that they have something of a designated waiting area with plenty of stools to perch on and some delicious foccacia bread set out for you to nibble on while you wait. You also get to watch the servers bring food out from the kitchen which certainly primes your appetite. We were seated at a small table in a corner. There was a bit of a draft from the door adjacent to the table. To start they served thinly sliced Italian bread. I thought the bread was okay but it would have been nice if they had warmed it a bit or if it had been fresh out of the oven. It is served with butter in those little plastic packets (eh...).Their wines by the glass are very reasonably priced ($5-7) I was not particularly smitten with my wine but for the price it was a decent Italian table wine. The Mediterranean salad was absolutely delicious. This generously sized salad (way big enough to share) was filled with tender bits of chicken, large slices of sundried tomatoes, slices of mozarella cheese, cucumbers, tomatoes and other salad yumminess. They were out of the dressing that traditionally is used for this salad so we had it with my personal favorite, blue cheese. Viva cheese! For an entree I had the lobster and pumpkin ravioli which was excellent. Note that the lobster and pumpkin are not combined in one ravioli but rather there are some lobster ravioli and some pumpkin ravioli. It was delish and served in a decadent cream sauce. I ate half at the restaurant and had the other half for lunch the next day. Portions are definitely very generous. I'd highly recommend this place for tasty Italian at a good price. Most entrees were from $10-14. Nice prices for a dinner out!

I went to Los Mariachis for the first time, last Saturday, August 15th, with a couple of friends. We had a great time. Service was great, and the food was brought to our table in record time (under 10 minutes), even during a busy afternoon. The place was almost packed. Food was great, too. I had the Special Enchiladas. I bragged to my family about how I should've went there sooner, and they should try it sometime. So, tonight, August 20th, my parents suggested we go there, so they could try it. This time---5 DAYS LATER---THIS PLACED SUCKED! The hostess/waitress just gave us a blank stare when we came in the door, then walked to a table, put three menus down, and asked us about drinks. She gave the impression that we were seriously bothering her by just being there. My parents said, \\"coffee\\", I said iced tea. When they said coffee, you'd have thought they asked for the most difficult-to-make item on the Starbucks menu! It took almost 10 minutes for them to even get it! I got the iced tea in about 5 minutes. We sat there for almost 20 minutes, and had to motion to her that we were ready to order. Dad got the Chicken Taco Salad, which was basically a bed of lettuce, with chicken, peppers, and tomato on it. No dressing, no salsa, no nothing! Mom got a plain Taco Salad, that she said was \\"okay\\". Nothing to get excited about. Again, no dressing, no salsa, no nothing. I had the Special Enchiladas again, and have nothing to complain about. They were really good, as they were when I ordered them last Saturday. But, the waitress never returned AT ALL, to re-fill drinks, or ask how everything was. She sat at the register, and just stared into space, waiting for the second shift crew to arrive, and take care of HER customers, and let her go home. The second shift crew was attentive, re-filled our drinks, took the dishes from the table, and did our waitress's job for her. It was really disappointing, that on Saturday, it was great. After I'd bragged about how good it was to my family, their first, and my second experience (5 days later) was lousy, and one of the worst excuses for service that I've seen. My food was good both times. But, what my parents got was just ridiculous. They said they'd never go back, and I'm starting to wonder if I will. So, you'll have to try the place yourself, and roll the dice. I'll give them a 4 for the food that I've ordered there. But, the service today, and the quality of what my parents ordered, barely warrants the 2 stars that I did give the place. This trip today just thoroughly pissed me off.

Don Asado is my go-to Mexican restaurant if I am in the mood for authentic, homemade Mexican food.  This funky joint has both indoor and outdoor seating. Seating inside is pretty limited, but it is rarely that busy. Their patio is very comfortable to sit on in the summer.  To start, they have incredible homemade thick tortilla chips and various kinds of salsas and sauces. Their green sauce in the green squeezy tube is addicting and delicious on anything. Oftentimes, I bring a to-go sauce container and purchase their green sauce to take home. It is incredible. You cant go wrong with keeping it simple and ordering tacos. Their chicken, steak, veggie, and carne asada tacos are all beyond delicious. I'm not sure what they do to make their chicken so amazing, but it is some of the best chicken I have ever had. Especially if it is in the tacos or enchiladas. Their enchiladas are unlike any enchiladas I have ever had. They are folded in half, instead of rolled up, and can be filled with a meat/vegetable of your choosing. They also have amazing burritos that are as big as my head. They are definitely worth the price because you could have leftovers for a meal or two, or eat it all in one sitting. Everything is reasonably priced, especially the giant entree plates they offer.

They are so thick they start to taste like meatballs if you get them well done.   Also, the barbecue sauce on the Cowboy should be changed.   It has too much corn syrup in it.   Please get a high quality sauce, like the the one they have at the Barbique Shack in Westerville.  It will change that burger to legendary status!  The burger is great but the sauce detracts from it.\\n\\nAlso, please stop charging for sauces on wing night.   If you can't make money on the wing special, you shouldn't offer it.

If you are serious about your juice then this is the place to go.  There are more options than 98% of the general public could ever hope to use.  This can confuse the first timer to a full option juice bar.  The great news is that the staff is knowledgeable and more than happy to take whatever time is required to assist you.  The negative is that providing a high level of knowledgeable service takes time, don't expect to rush in and out in two minutes.  It is not that they are slow, it is that it takes that long to do their custom concoctions.  Also, the high level of service and extensive inventory means that the costs are higher then a Smoothie King (aka the McDonald's of Juice Stores).

So I got up and approached who I thought was the manager with my receipt & told him the situation and asked for a credit back since we didn't get what we ordered ...he seemed annoyed that I wanted a credit back, he also was talking to the chef and told the chef he forgot bacon and the chef goes \\"OH WELL\\" as I'm standing right there. As we're eating and observing the place we noticed ANOTHER lady come out with a bottle and wash rag and wipe down the trash can and scrub it a little bit then go to the next trash can and do the same thing, and then instead of switching wash rags she washes the tables with the same rag. At that point we were MORTIFIED. we didn't even finish our food and we dumped it and left, as we left I mentioned to her that she really shouldn't be doing that, and she rolled her eyes.

We asked where a certain type of book might be in the store and the woman kindly walked over to where we were and pointed out the books about two feet from us.  \\n\\nAnother time I asked where the restrooms were and was given detailed instructions.  Only then did I notice that there are restroom signs about every 5 feet throughout the store.  I may never go to Powell's again but I'll always remember that the restrooms are in the purple room.

Off the bat didn't introduce himself, was rude when we would ask questions, and when we asked for some advice on cracking our lobster he told us he had other things to do before he could come help us. Again another 20 mins before he came back to \\"help\\" and was even ruder to us.

Being from Vancouver, BC (Portland's wannabe little sister), I was amazed that bylaws there were so that the restaurant could encompass (what used to be) a house, and have covered seating in the driveway...in the middle of a residential neighborhood. WHY can't we have this? Love the atmosphere here.  Really bustling.\\n\\nI found out about this restaurant on Chowhound, and it wasn't until later that I heard that it was on Guy Fieri's Diners, Drive-ins & Dives & pretty hyped up. No wonder it was a TWO HOUR WAIT! Actually, we were lucky, because the two of us were willing to sit at the bar right behind the hostess' podium, and we waited maybe all of 5 minutes? We eavesdropped on what the hostess was saying, and so many people had to be turned away because of the wait. \\n\\nIke's Vietnamese Fish Sauce Wings came highly recommended, as were the Som drinking vinegars, so we had both! The water comes tasting like it had pandan in it - refreshing. We also ordered Papaya Pok Pok with sticky rice (comes wrapped in a cute woven leaf basket). I must say everything was DELICIOUS. Anything with a mix of sweet and spicy is a plus for me! We came away from our Portland trip raving about this place to all our friends, and it was hands down, the best meal I had there. I wish I could make those damn chicken wings at home!\\n\\nThe second time around (just this past August), we came down with friends, got a reservation for the 5 of us. We were early, so we checked in, then waited for our table to be ready at their affiliated Whiskey Soda Lounge down the block (but that's another review).  Oh man, the chicken wings the second time around was even better...just the right amount of spicy. We got to ordering a ton more dishes - I really recommend ordering a variety.

As I knew I had a business trip to the area, this seemed like a great opportunity to rectify that.\\n\\nSo, head to toe, the Bistro du Midi experience:\\n\\nFirst, I was disappointed that they didn't seem to have an easy email address for booking.  I had to put credit on my Skype account and call from Australia during their opening hours to make a booking.  I understand OpenTable is a thing in the States, but it isn't anywhere else, so requiring that for online interaction was a bit of a minus.\\n\\nI did get ahold of a human, and after being put on hold for a while, eventually made the booking.\\n\\nOr so I thought.\\n\\nWhen I showed up at the restaurant last night, the staff couldn't seem to find any record of it.  I had even provided my email address so that they could contact me if there were any issues - I never heard from them, so, hoped for the best.\\n\\nThankfully, this is a customer-service driven business, and they were happy to accommodate me.  It was meant to be a booking for three, my brother in law, as well as his partner.  It's possible they found my wayward booking, but the initial impression I had was \\"uh oh, this doesn't bode well...\\"\\n\\nOnce seated at a table, service was friendly, fast, and courteous.  I was a bit disappointed by the lack of friendly banter I typically get from waiters around the world; my waiter seemed all business, and didn't really \\"engage\\" with us as much as I'd have liked.  Some of the other staff did, however, so that's good.\\n\\nMy brother in law's partner couldn't make it, as she was feeling ill, so it was just the two of us.  Turns out, he's quite the \\"foodie\\" and found the menu quite appealing.  Better than that, we both found our meals to be superb!\\n\\nHe went with the hake, I went with the pan seared tilefish with crispy scales -- WOW.  \\n\\nOh, but, I also started with one of my all time favourites:  Foie gras.  It was outstanding.  An incredibly rich treat, served with a rhubarb coulis and fresh strawberry.  Fantastic.  \\n\\nSince my dining companion was driving, we had to keep things in moderation for alcohol.  I was actually quite eager to order a bottle from Australia that I think he'd have loved, but, it would have been a waste.  The wine list looked superb, and had I the chance, I'd REALLY have wanted to do the full chef's tasting menu with the wine pairing.  It looked phenomenal, but, it's the sort of meal that you need to do with someone else, or entirely alone, as the 5 or 7 courses would seem odd compared to someone else's standard 1 or 2.\\n\\nFor dessert, not something I typically have, I went with the vanilla mouselline.  Outstanding.  Served with an espresso ice cream; truly wonderful.\\n\\nWe both finished off with a glass of something delicious and that was that.\\n\\nAll sounds great, right?  Well, there was a minus that left a bit of a bad taste in my mouth:  During our dessert, as we were still eating, and sipping our dessert wines, the bill arrived.\\n\\nNo \\"would you like anything else?\\" \\nNo \\"coffee?  tea?\\"\\n\\nJust: Plop.\\n\\nThat stung.  My sense was that because I had booked for 3, and they sat us at a table for four, and it was just the two of us, that they really wanted the table back for another seating.  \\n\\nIf that was the case, there was no mention of that when I booked, nor when I arrived.  Perhaps they just didn't like the cut of my jib, I don't know...but, it did leave me with a slightly sour note on what was otherwise a spectacular meal and a spectacular Get To Know You with an extended family member.\\n\\nI don't see myself visiting the area again anytime soon, but if I did, I'd definitely want to try out that chef's tasting menu."},{"name":"110 Grill","address":"170 Forbes Rd","city":"Braintree","stars":"4","text":"After being seated, we waited 30 minutes at the table and no one ever bothered to come to our table, even after requesting our drink order be taken.

Kabobs the size of my arm.  With a pound of rice to take it down. The first time I came here, I came with a group and we all ordered individual entrees.  We might have looked pretty stupid if you could have seen our faces behind the giant mounds of food placed in front of us.  This is definitely a shared plate kind of place.  In fact, if you can eat a plate all to yourself in one sitting, you should just be ashamed.\\n\\nThe kabobs are surprisingly great.  The meat is really soft, tender, and flavorful.  The orange peel and almond chicken kabob is such a surprising bitter-salty-sweet on the tongue with no cheap sugary or artificial saffron flavor.  Get a kebab combo and you will get two different meats for the same price, and the kebabs are only slightly smaller apiece than the solo ones.  The rice is fluffy and buttery and perfect with a genuine hint of saffron, and not day glo yellow, surprise again.  For a random empty restaurant in a residential area this place has some amazing food so far....\\n\\nAnd now here's where a five star kebab experience gets ugly.  The pita is the cheapest kind you can get at the store.  This kind of cardboard should be used to wipe the floor.  The order of grilled pita is this same store-bought cardboard, but blackened unnecessarily.  Do not accept any offers for pita as this item should not be encouraged as is.  If you do, you will find yourself with a pile of cardboard stomach filler with some butter to go on it, and then you'll be too full for the actual good stuff.  Avoid all items on the menu that come with pita too.\\n\\nThe vegetables are an afterthought.  In fact they're more like a didn'thavethethought.  A barely charred tomato with cold grainy flesh inside?  You don't need it.  The first time I came here they had some grilled mixed vegetables on the side but I haven't seen it since and I remember picking out some undercooked onions then.\\n\\nNo turkish coffee, and no desserts.  Wait, I can see why they wouldn't have desserts, but really why is the coffee Folgers?\\n\\nThe waitresses are really nice and eager to please but the place is always empty.  They supposedly have a big Persian party here on Saturdays though I've never been.  But the prices are amazing and as long as you stick with the kabobs and rice the quality is on par with the best.

Is it part of the culture of being \\"nice\\" and kind, even for online reviews? Because let me tell you, it's really hard to decide where to eat in this area just by looking at Yelp ratings.\\n\\nI find this double true for Asian food. Any type of Asian food. I mean, come on, I'm not expecting the food quality I've encountered around migrant communities, or even just places with a fair amount of diverse ethnicities, but the standard for what's supposed to be good Asian food is just sad.\\n\\nI had the shoyu ramen. Tasted around the same as 1-2 star rated \\"Japanese\\" restaurants in the OC. \\n\\nNoodles: The noodles were decidedly lacking in chewiness, to the degree that there wasn't much of a difference between that of better quality instant ramen. Actually, the more expensive Korean instant ramen brands have better noodles. If that's not sad I don't know what is.\\n\\nBroth: Oily, not rich. Lacked the deepness of flavor that comes from stewing the broth for a long time. Extremely salty, which wouldn't be a problem if it were integrated into the overall flavor, but as it stood it was more separate impressions of \\"oil-salt-tinge of meat.\\" Ok, so I wasn't expecting much in the first place, but I almost felt like crying after the first sip. \\n\\nToppings: Seriously. What? One slice of fatty pork chayu. A thin skimming of greens--a few scraggly slices of mushroom--a few tiny bamboo shoots... It was sad, man. I just kind of flipped the thin layer of toppings over and over a few times and did the same to the noodles to see if there were any hidden goodies, but nope. That was it.\\n\\nSo overall, the food was... I've had better. I've definitely had better. I'm rating it three stars in comparison to the area standards. That is to say, the food was a tragedy, but the serving staff was nice, the interior decoration was pretty. Some people seem to think that's grounds for a five star review, so this is me conforming to the local \\"tastes,\\" I suppose.\\n\\nSeriously, though, man. Let that broth simmer for a few hours with a good chunk of meat or whatever key flavor you're using for that particular vat--you do have vats, right? Right? It's not like I'm talking letting it stew overnight, man, because let's be serious, who does that in Oregon. Oh, add some toppings-the noodle to topping ratio is just sad. \\n\\nI only visited because the place is close and I was tired.

I ordered two medium bubble teas for $7.49, including tax. I ordered the bubble green milk tea for myself, with 30% sugar and half ice. I was extremely disappointed. Because there was less sugar, there also seemed to be zero flavor. I didn't ask for less flavor, I asked for less sugar. That is what makes me question what exactly they put in their milk tea.

The tea is fragrant throughout the drink, so it tastes a bit more authentic to me. The boba is a bit smaller and softer than most tapioca around Buford Highway, but there's still a bite of chewiness, which is good. They have a pretty vast selection of drinks ranging from milk teas (and dairy-free options for those who are lactose intolerant) to slushes or yogurt drinks. If you're a diehard Kung Fu Tea fan, you'll probably not love this place as much because the taste of Kung Fu is so distinctive - they also don't offer an oolong-based tea at ViVi. \\n\\nParking is a pain here, so you'd want to park at a nearby plaza or be lucky when you can snag one of the six or seven available spots out front."},{"name":"Rudy's \\"Country Store\\" and Bar-B-Q","address":"11570 Research Blvd","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"The brisket at Rudy's gave me a painful ulcer that I am still dealing with 7 days later.

We planned a day in Portland and drove down two hours with the family to what we thought would be an amazing breakfast - but that was not what we encountered.\\nMy wife ordered the country fried steak with vegan gravy. Then 5 minutes later our waitress came back and said they didn't have any vegan gravy today. She apologized and we had to ask to get the menu back. When the waitress finally returned my wife ordered the vegan tofu scramble; which we were informed after another return from our waitress wasn't possible because they didn't have any tofu. So we reviewed the menu until we found oatmeal.\\nI know some people CHOOSE to eat vegan, but there are those in the world who don't have the choice and it makes life very hard. My wife used to LOVE food and it hit pretty hard when she started having problems. So to go somewhere that has 4-5 vegan options on their menu and to be told none of them are available is a bit of a slap in the face.\\nWe should have just left, but the kids and I had already ordered and despite the frustration of the lack of vegan options everyone was trying to be optimistic. And then the pancake fixings were delivered. The kids poured out their first pancakes and we quickly found the pancake batter had either been blended to be mixed or it had sat around for a very long time. The pancakes were very flat and never raised. The final result was rubbery and not really cooked all the way through regardless of how long we attempted to cook them for.

I've been to Avalon Pockets twice now and will note that \\n\\n1) They're in \\"soft open/preview\\" mode right now. Their menu is super limited until their official \\"grand opening\\" next month.\\n2) I visited during their first week open, so some hiccups and issues are to be expected. \\n\\nBoth of my visits to Avalon Pockets were similar - with great food but questionable service that they really need to fix quickly.\\n\\nThe current preview menu basically includes four options of wraps: gyro, lamb kabob (which is not served as a kabob), falafel or grilled veggies. Each comes with various topping options like tzatziki sauce, hummus, lettuce, onions, olives and peppers. For a little more money ($1 or $2), you can get the combo which includes the wrap, a drink and \\"Mediterranean Fries\\" which are just thick cut potato chips. They also offer a kids meal which includes the food and a toy of some sort.\\n\\n*Update* The combo only included the \\"fries\\" during the grand-soft-opening. You can now choose either the wrap itself for $5 or the wrap and a drink for $6.\\n\\nThe food portions are perfect for lunch, but would definitely be too small for a real dinner. I've had the gyro and lamb kabobs and my wife has had the falafel. All three were enjoyable without being particularly exciting.\\n\\nThe \\"fries\\" have been a mixed bag. The first time I went in, they were nice and crisp with a perfectly salty seasoning. The second time, they were soggy and bland. \\n\\nAs I mentioned earlier, the service is where they really need to focus right now - especially speed.\\n\\nMy first visit was during the week at about 1pm. When I arrived, there were already a few people seated and waiting for their food. I stood at the counter for few minutes being pretty much ignored by the staff of two. They saw me, but didn't acknowledge me at all. I wasn't sure if I was meant to just sit at a table and wait or wait at the counter. Eventually, someone came over and took my order.\\n\\nThe restaurant is very small - with about 8 or 9 tables crammed into the dining area and there's a tv playing music videos (which I believe are Turkish). The decor is pleasant if confusing: a painting of what seems to be a french bistro, some country setting paintings and one of what seems to be Venice. I sat and waited for my food - facing away from the counter. The tv and music were up so loud that I didn't even hear them calling my name  to come pick up my food at first. I had waited about 10 minutes for my food.\\n\\nI returned with my wife at about noon on Saturday. The dining room was packed with people waiting for their food. Once again, we stood waiting to be acknowledged, but not as long as the first visit. But while we were acknowledged quicker, we had to wait longer as no one was able to take our order just yet. While we waited to order, more people started arriving and lining up behind us to order. \\n\\nEventually, we ordered and sat down waiting. People were getting so tired of waiting just to order, they were leaving. I'm sure that if some people hadn't already ordered, they would have left too. It seems that they were pretty backed up even before we got there. By the time we finally got our food, we had been there almost an hour. \\n\\nAvalon Pockets has really good food - and it's very fresh, but they really need to figure out how to get it out quicker - and to handle customers quicker."},{"name":"LOCAL 02045","address":"2 A St","city":"Hull","stars":"3.5","text":"What a great spot!

We walked over here one morning for brunch, and luckily, we were seated right away. After consulting some of my friend's yelps, we decided to go with the boar collar, the curry noodles, and the cha yen. \\n\\nThe boar collar was SUPER flavorful and VERY spicy (I believe it's a garlic, pepper, lime juice concoction on top). As soon as you bite into it, a rush of flavor smashes into your mouth (first the lime, then the spiciness and other flavors). I knew that my boyfriend would LOVE this dish (because it's spicy), and needless to say, he did! Very small portions though, so beware.\\n\\nBoy oh boy am I glad we paired it with the curry noodles. It was light, full of coconut milk (as the base probably), and it definitely took the heat off of the boar collar. There was a good amount of chicken, but a small amount of the thick, flat egg noodles. Overall, it was good, but for some reason, I kept on having a bitter aftertaste. This was served with a plate of chili, pickled vegetables, etc. \\n\\nThe Thai tea with evaporated milk (cha yen) came in a bottle, which was interesting to me. It tasted decent, but it was almost $5, so I am not sure if it was worth it.\\n\\nAll in all, this place is good to try, but keep in mind that it is very pricey for what you end up getting. The waitress recommended at least 3 plates to share between two people, but we wanted to save room for other stuff around the city too. We ended up leaving pretty hungry even after forking over $40 for a meal. :("},{"name":"Thai Wok Kitchen","address":"5000 E 4th Plain Blvd, Ste A101","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4.5","text":"When I saw this pop up on Yelp, I was a bit skeptical.

As a child, I loved gathering up any books that I had read more than twice and begging my mom to let me take just a few more of her books too.  (I was reading \\"young adult\\" fiction at 9...)  Once there, I would dutifully wait in line at the sales counter fidgeting and bouncing and talking to everyone around me.  (I was a hi-energy child.)  When they finally tallied up all the books, they would always ask whether I wanted trade-in credit, cash, or to get 1/2&1/2.  I always took the trade in credits and then I would vanish into the bowels of the store.  hours later, my mom would always find me sitting on the floor in some corner with a stack of books I didn't have enough credit for and reading the one that was most interesting.  We would then pick through them and decide which ones to put back and which ones I would buy.  Then we'd sit in the cafe reading our books and having coffee and hot chocolate and talk about things...  I have great memories of that place...  \\n\\nOf course, now it's much larger.  The main building has expanded some, (as much as they possibly can;) the tech bookstore a few blocks away is now larger; - and there are the millions of little mini-powell's out there.  Well, not millions, maybe 5 or 6?  A few more than that?\\n\\nBack to the subject of the original City of Books - This bookstore takes up a full downtown city block.  They have new, used, first editions, rare, collectible, signed, .....  Comics, magazines, graphic novels, pop-up books, reference books, German books, Japanese books, Klingon books, children's books, adult books, cookbooks, .....  \\n\\nThe coffee shop is great.  Good pastries, good coffee, newspapers, magazines....\\n\\nA couple of years ago I was doing a lot of card magic - (No, not the stupid collectible card game for socially inept people who don't bathe - I'm talking about conjuring and illusion - real magic) - I picked up 13 different books - 2 of them published in the '50s.\\n\\nThey really do have everything, and if you love books it's a magical place.  You really can get lost inside.\\n\\nI guess I should stop rambling about how great this place is - this is a pretty long review.\\n\\nI'll end by mentioning the 2 educators I sat next to on the plane the last time I flew back into Portland.  They were traveling to Oregon from Memphis for a conference.  Powell's was the tourist attraction that they were most interested in visiting while they were here.  Not the bridges or the mountains - a bookstore.  They had heard about it from another teacher who used to live here.  They kept asking me questions about it and their faces were full of wonder as I described the bookstore."},{"name":"Sushi Kiku","address":"2770 Lenox Rd","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3.5","text":"I want to begin with a caveat: my taste palette is not particularly refined. I do not comprehend the full spectrum of raw fish (they just taste alright to me). When I crave sushi I really just crave the spicy mayo sauce.\\n\\nHaving said that, this place is more fantastic than the generic splendor of spicy mayo. My favorite so far is the House Salad special, one of several rolls wrapped with cucumber in place of rice, and it has a multitude of flavors that sings to your palette like a beautiful sonata. There is the light crisp of cucumbers, the salty under taste of seaweed, several kinds of fish (one of them tastes smoky), topped off with a bit of mayo or house sauce or something. Whatever it is, it's pretty special and I think will delight many who tries it.\\n\\nPlus, all sushi is half off Tuesdays through Saturday. So really, what is there not to like? This is a place where you can get full and try out the top end rolls. Depending on what you order, this is a $ or $$ restaurant. I totally 110% recommend this place.

We ordered delivery on a Monday night from Wings Over Somerville. We were told it would be about an hour. Wow, I guess they were killing the chickens right then and there, hence why it took that long? Anyway, we assumed the long wait meant the place had a lot of orders. Alright, fine. An hour comes and goes, and after close to 1.5 hours, we give them a call. The status of the order is checked, and then the driver is contacted. We are told he will arrive in 5 minutes. When I pushed on the wait, I was given then rather unsatisfactory response that \\"a lot of orders came at once, so it took longer.\\" Um, if that's the case, then you go the extra mile to make it up to the customer that you misinformed about the arrival of his/her order. Well, the delivery shows about 10 minutes later.\\n\\nHere's the thing: the wings are actually pretty good, BUT we think they would have been better had they arrived at a reasonable hour. It was clear they had been wrapped up hot for awhile--condensation had collected in the box, so by the time we opened them, moisture droplets made the wings damp and sucked away any resemblance of crispiness. Not bad wings, but clearly wings that lost potential.\\n\\nWe plan to try this place again will likely pick-up or else demand a shorter delivery time window.

The service doesn't necessarily speak English all the time, but that's not a problem - they're extremely attentive and overly helpful. I'm going to agree with Lala who reviewed earlier by saying that the legroom is cramped (the base of the BBQ extends all the way down to the floor, and is pretty wide), but if you side at the sides you can fit your legs around or just deal.

I was directed to Rudy's by my coworkers as the best BBQ place in the north Austin area. And boy were they right. This place rocks! First off, the whole vibe of the place is so quirky. Gas pumps out front, troughs of drinks on ice and meats available by weight.\\n\\nWhen I got up to the counter the guy asked me if I had been to Rudy's before. When I replied that I hadn't, he told me that he would get me a sampler of their 3 most popular meats. He then turned around and asked the \\"cutters\\" for a sampler for the rookie. The other staff then yelled, \\"Alright rookie!\\" It was slightly embarrassing but funny at the same time. He then brought me a cut of their smoked turkey, one of the lean smoked brisket and one of their moist smoked brisket. Each of the samples was 2 good-sized bites and each was very tasty. I had been leaning toward something pork but the moist brisket sample swayed me and I ended up with a 1/2 lb. of that.\\n\\nHe also brought out a sample of their creamed corn which was excellent but I wanted beans and potato salad so ended up with those. He explained each of their sides and desserts; gave me some bread and told me to come back to the counter if I wanted any more; he told me how to get my silverware (well, plasticware); where the pickles, onions and sauce were; in short, he was very helpful and made me feel much less uncomfortable. I'm usually not very good abut visiting new places by myself so his manner was very reassuring.\\n\\nThe food was outstanding. The brisket was so super tender that I almost had to eat it with a spoon. The smoky flavor was terrific and worked very well with their barbecue sauce when I put some on it. The beans were pretty good, firm yet tender. They also tasted great with a bit of the BBQ sauce mixed in. The potato salad was a bit creamy for my tastes but still good, and the potatoes were cooked just right (I didn't try any BBQ sauce on it though ;) )\\n\\nThis place fit my authentic Texas barbecue needs perfectly. I may make a second stop here before I head home to try out their pork."},{"name":"Pok Pok","address":"3226 SE Division St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"SO SALTYYY!!

YES!"},{"name":"MF Sushi Atlanta","address":"299 N Highland Ave NE, Ste K","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Like I said to fellow Yelper Thi T., the $125 Omakase was amazing, but I wouldn't recommend. Why? It's just way too much food. I tapped out 3/4 way through. I pushed through to the end though, but I was sweating the last few dishes. I was actually exhausted eating all that food for 3 hours. I felt like I ran a marathon, except I gained about 3000 calories instead of losing one. \\n\\nIf you count all the individual plates they served us, there was about 25-30 different items for the omakase. They pace you too. Sometimes you're waiting a while for the next batch to come out. \\n\\nThe first course are the sashimi plates. You get fatty tuna, salmon, and hamachi. These were amazing. You get about 5 slices for each sashimi. You are feeling good and happy right now. These were like little appetizers to wet your appetite. \\n\\nThen came the baked mussels, which were one of my favorites. It was stuffed with eel sauce, masago, and scallions--delicious\\n\\nThen the scallop-lime sashimi came. You can eat the scallop with the lime slice, or not. It's up to you. With the lime, it gives a nice, sour kick to compliment the scallop. It's good without it too. Or you can dip it in soy sauce with the lime and the scallop. Do whatever you want! With 2 people, they gave us 7. So there was 1 odd one out. They should've just given us 6. \\n\\nThe sashimi section wasn't done still. Then came a sashimi plate consisting of octopus, trout, mid-fatty tuna (chutoro), and amber jack. They were all awesome, as expected. \\n\\nThen came the albacore tataki, which was good. Everything was good, by the way. I don't think I had one bad dish here.  I also liked how the sashimi plates came with julienned daikon radish. Those cleanse your palette too. \\n\\nThen the nigiri courses came. With the $125 omakase, it features all MF's signature nigiris. These were probably my favorite courses. They featured some of the best nigiris in Atlanta. \\n\\nThey gave us sweet shrimp, with the deep fried head. Eat the head you guys--eyeballs and all. It tastes like shrimp crackers. \\n\\nThe quail egg with salmon roe (ikura) was amazing. I love quail egg. It gives the nigiris an extra milky flavor and texture. \\n\\nThe blow-torched wagyu beef was incredible. It was so buttery and delicious. I never had wagyu beef so it blew my mind. \\n\\nMF sushi likes to use truffle a lot. They used it on their signature salmon nigiri (and other items). So good. \\n\\nThe rest of the nigiris were all amazeballs with otoro, hamachi, and a bunch of other stuff I can't remember. \\n\\nAfter the nigiri courses came the box sushi courses. They gave us spicy tuna/salmon box sushi, lobster box sushi, and the fatty tuna box sushi. They were all satisfying and good, and a perfect way to end our meal. \\n\\nBut we weren't not done. No way. I was stuffed and couldn't handle more. We asked the server how many more things were coming out. He said 7 more. We were like, SEVEN?! I was so stuffed at this point, I had no idea how I could eat seven more things--and that's not including dessert.  Heck, fellow yelper Jenn M. tapped out after the nigiris like a little girl. \\n\\nSo we undid our belts one notch and waited with anticipation. The next courses were the robata course--also known as the grilled foods from the kitchen. They gave us Corn (some special corn I can't remember), squid, shishito, grilled mushrooms, some fish, duck, and fillet mignon. Well they lied. They didn't give us 7 because they also gave us a big bowl of rice to eat it all with. \\n\\nLet me tell you, all the robata items--even after eating all that food--was freaking good. I loved the duck and the fillet mignon. They cook the fillet mignon in front of you. They use a ton of butter and grill the meat on top. It was so buttery and yummy. I was disappointed I couldn't enjoy it 100% because I was so full. \\n\\nAt this point, I was sweating. I tapped out long ago. But I had to endure the dessert courses. 3 dessert items came out for us: the green tea cake, the mango cake, and flan. I just had a few bites of those since I couldn't eat anymore. I liked the mango cake the best. They were all good though. \\n\\nWe wanted to applaud ourselves for finishing the whole thing. It was an experience. I recommend people to do the $100 omakase--not the $125 one. I think that should be a reasonable amount of food. Heck, maybe just go for the $75 one, and order off the menu. \\n\\nOf course, if you're insane, do the $150 one. I have to give a shout out to my other fellow yelper who was with us, Daniel S., who powered his way through the whole thing. He even helped with some of our plates since we couldn't do it. I think he's one of the rare guys that can probably finish the $150 one.  \\n\\nWas it worth it? Of course it was. It was one of the best dining experiences I had in Atlanta."},{"name":"Life Alive","address":"765 Mass Ave","city":"Cambridge","stars":"4.5","text":"Healthy and tasty.

These things are delicious. We shared one plate between to two of us, and were fighting over the last wing. They are seasoned to perfection, juicy, and meaty. There are about 5-6 wings per plate, and they are all of a decent size- not your typical mini wings at the bar. You can choose spicy or not (can't do both on the same plate), and we opted for the non-spicy wings. They were full of flavor and a tiny bit sweet. I would come back just to a eat whole plate (or two) by myself. \\n\\nWe also ordered the khao soi with beef. This dish consisted of noodles with a curry tasting soup base. It was good, but I don't think I'll get it again. I tend to like soup with veggies, and this dish only includes noodles, base, and your meat of choice. The beef in our soup was a bit chewy, and the chunks were on the large side. Considering the meat pieces were hard to chew and break apart, we ended up not eating most of the beef.\\n\\nYou can order thai iced tea with lime juice or evaporated milk. I almost chose the lime juice, but the waitress informed me that it actually isn't that great, and that I should stick to the evaporated milk, as it's typically done. The drink itself was good, but I've had better. It was a bit on the bitter side, and I had a hard time finishing it.\\n\\nIf I'm ever in the area again, I'll come back for the wings. We got lucky and didn't have to wait for a table around 1:30 on a Saturday, but as we were leaving at 2:30pm, it appears they were attempting to shut down the second story of the restaurant, and there were people waiting outside for a table."},{"name":"Powell's City of Books","address":"1005 W Burnside St","city":"Portland","stars":"5","text":"As I walked into the first aisle of seemingly endless books at Powell's, my mind was screaming: \\"HEAAAAAAAAVEN.\\" It was almost distracting.\\n\\nBut let's back up. I had planned to visit Powell's later in the day since I didn't want to carry books around for hours, but stopped in to ask a question at their Information Desk. Through conversation, I learned that you can put books on temporary hold to pick up later, or if you purchase 10 or more, you can ship them home for a flat-rate of $12.95. Pretty fantastic!\\n\\nThis was also terribly unfortunate news for my credit card. I am still apologizing to it, but I don't think it has forgiven me yet. Ugh.\\n\\nWith this new knowledge in hand, my Powell's trip was rescheduled to early afternoon and I chose a basket and began to browse with a stop over at the souvenirs section. I had to purchase a t-shirt. It was like I knew then what I was about to do to my credit card. I also chose a book named \\"Portland Noir\\" in that section, which was a series of short stories. I've already finished the book, and it was great. I'd recommend! I hear that one of Powell's employees was the editor too!\\n\\nFrom there, I trekked into the Literature section and disappeared for a good hour. Increasingly, my arm was hurting and I found myself placing the basket on the floor as I perused through the expansive selection of beautiful books.\\n\\nSo much love. So. Much.

I had lent it years ago and it was never returned (CURSE PEOPLE WHO DO THIS!), so I'm overjoyed to have a copy of my own once more.\\n\\nI've already given away one of the books that I purchased here -- to a complete stranger. I had finished the book (a novel by one of my top authors), thought it was lovely, and wanted to pass it on.

We were shut out of all of the buffet spots around town.\\n\\nAfter the \\"2012 Thanksgiving Day Debacle\\" at Shilo Inn Airport - our previously favorite holiday buffet spot - that was one place NOT on our holiday menu this year.\\n\\nThen, I came upon another Shilo Inn property, which at one time was the Greenbriar Inn, on Canyon Road.\\n\\nEven being confirmed eastsiders, Sweetie and I were fully aware that the once storied restaurant in this hotel had gone through many hands. Different restaurateurs tried and failed to keep and attract a clientele.\\n\\nWe were skeptical of buffet offered by their eatery, now called THE MARK.\\n \\nSo, we planned our Santa-playing route of dropping off gifts with relatives and friends so we ended up in Beaverton.\\n\\nAs advertised, they had tables laden with fresh food. It looked like \\"Christmas Buffet 2013\\" was going to be a toothsome repast.\\n\\nSweetie's \\"Starters\\" included peal-and-eat prawns, fresh fruit salad and she also got a bowl of butternut squash bisque.\\n\\nI helped myself to a large slice of baked brie with apple chutney sauce (still gooey and warm), asparagus, broccoli and carrots from their crudite platter - topped with very flavorful Caesar dressing.\\n\\nSweetie went for the Prime Rib, not bothering with the bake ham or roasted turkey.  She encouraged me to try a slice, being sure to top it with a wonderful roasted garlic horseradish. She was right - simply toothsome.\\n\\nAlong with my prime rib, I had a couple slices of turkey with cranberry sauce and gravy.

Rich and delicious.\\n   + Traditional stuffing - \\"Dressing\\" as we called it in our family; it was very fresh, with the onions and celery saut√©ed just right and not mushy. Combined with the turkey and gravy - Mmmmmm, good.\\n   + Creamed spinach - My bias; I love raw spinach.  Cooked, not so much. I asked the chef, \\"in B√©arnaise sauce?\\"  Yes, indeed, he said, made from scratch. The sauce also made a good topping for the dressing.\\n   + Almond green beans - Thank goodness, NOT the dreaded casserole. They were seasoned with salt, and large cracked black pepper - and something I couldn't place.  I had two servings; they were that good.\\n   + Brussels sprouts with bacon - I'm not much of a \\"baconator\\", but this was an ideal dish. Braised to perfection; with a good texture, had me going back for more.\\n   + Candied sweet potatoes - Being pretty well stuffed, I had just a taste of this dish; As advertised.\\n   + Mac 'n' Cheese - This was probably on the Festalboard to please picky kids. I tasted it; it was okay.\\n\\nShort of breath, both Sweetie and I ended our 2-hour-long feast with chocolate pie.

I've seen fistfights break out over Gates vs. Arthur Bryant's vs. Oklahoma Joe's vs. Zarda.

We knew they had an unorthodox approach to \\"chowda\\" and were all for it.  We saw the menu and noticed many of the appetizers sounded amazing compared to the entrees.  We decided to go for a night of apps.  We started with the fried oyster slider.  The fried oyster itself was great, and the brioche bun was perfect.  I then did a trio of the Duxbury oysters.  They were simply the best Oysters I've ever had.  From there we had the steamed clams.  These were very very good.  Then the chowders arrived.  The flavor profiles in this chowder are just ridiculous in a good way.  What takes it to the next level is the part of the chowder I was most skeptical about.  The buttermilk biscuits.  Who in their right minds would put buttermilk biscuits in a chowder?  Oyster crackers move over, they were perfect.  We then decided to go for one more round on the apps and ordered the mussels with chorizo.  The chorizo is amazing and adds a great flavor profile to the broth.  The leeks bring that broth up even another notch.  At this point we were hitting a wall, but as we were waiting for the mussels the table next to us ordered the lobster roe pasta.  This was the dish of the night.  The only thing I would change is the short rib that comes with it.  It just doesn't make sense in the dish and actually took away from the dish.  I would rather see the short rib removed, it doesn't even need to be replaced with anything.  If you come here, you have to get the lobster roe pasta and the chowder.  I ate the following night at Atlantic Fish Co and Island Creek Oysters ruined my dinner.  Dinner at Atlantic Fish just could not hold a candle.  I wish I would have just gone back for a second time.

The pool & lazy river are great and there's a pool bar & restaurant (with hefty resort pricing) where you can get a bite or cocktail.  There is a resort fee which covers 2 bottles of water daily and use of the pool towels/rafts for the lazy river. The hotel is conveniently located close, yet far enough way to all of the Orlando attractions -- took us about 15min to get to EPCOT.

Chiang Mai (Northern Thailand) to be exact, which is where most of the dishes on the menu came from. So, coming to a place that boasts about Northern Thailand cuisine, I was very excited!\\n\\nWe ordered the POK POK WINGS, KHAO SOI GAI, PRAWN CLAY POT, and the CHICKEN SATAY. \\n\\nHands down the POK POK WINGS are to-die-for.  It's a flavor bomb to say the least!  The crisp on the wings is just right while the meat remains juicy and tender.  But the flavor - out of this world!  It's salty, sweet, and a tad bit spicy all in one bite.  This is a MUST ORDER!\\n\\nKHAO SOI GAI (Chicken) was the dish I was really excited to order.  This is a dish that Chiang Mai, Thailand is known for, and I've definitely had the best of it on my visits to Thailand.  Unfortunately for me, this version missed the mark.  Although it mimicked the taste of it, the textures and depth of flavor just didn't do it for me.  The soup was too watery and the creaminess that KHAO SOI is known for just wasn't there.  Definitely disappointed.\\n\\nThe PRAWN CLAY POT was good.  The prawns were cooked perfectly and the flavor of the noodles was good.  It comes with a spicy lime sauce that you're to dip your prawns in.  That was definitely the star of the dish.  The dish also has pork belly, which in my opinion, would have been better if it was a cooked a little more.  The pork belly was too soggy, and I prefer the fat on the pork belly to be cooked a little more.  Definitely not a very memorable dish. \\n\\nCHICKEN SATAY was good, but nothing that wow'd me.

On the smaller oysters, I questioned if there even was any seafood under all that cheese. There is definitely such a thing as too much cheese. Shrimp gumbo had a nice spice but nothing special. I've definitely had much better at more casual spots. I loved the avocado with the tuna and it paired well with the chips. I wish it had some jalepenos or a squeeze of lemon. It was good but I felt like it could've been so much better with another element of flavor. The tuna wasn't bad but I can definitely do better than that at home. For my main course, I ordered the sea bass Oscar style. It wasn't on the menu but it's a sauce with crab meat for $11 more. I couldn't taste the truffle oil mentioned by our server but it was still great. However, my friend ordered the same and she complained about how awfully bland it was for two whole days. I find this somewhat odd coming from a person who thinks sprite is spicy. Maybe her dish wasn't prepared the same but mine was a lot more than mediocre. I was originally going to give a 3 star rating but because the service by staff was outstanding and the creme br√ªl√©e was perfectly torched, I bumped it up to 4. Overall, it was a great experience and I would consider returning if I was on that side of town."},{"name":"Brothers Kouzina","address":"25 Newbury St","city":"Peabody","stars":"4","text":"fabolucious!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\\nWell.. we stopped in today for lunch and the place was busy as usual.... and of course it is because of the Food.... my wife had the lamb special and it was so tender and tasted so delicious---I had my favorite the lamb chops... they are so good... and of course we both had double servings of the GREEK STYLE GREEN BEANS ---it has such a nice taste... they are so delicious.. and the greek salad ..... and to top it off had the bakalava.... it is loaded with honey and nuts ...NOT just layers and layers of philo.. like most of  the restaurants that serve them...THE FOOD IS GREAT HERE.... and my wife and I come here at least 2 times a month....Jackie the waitress was super... too.... yes I have posted before .. but just had to post again..."},{"name":"The Halal Gurus","address":"539 W Oltorf S","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"This truck has the best gyros everrrrrr!!!

Knowingly, we decided to skip the dinner line and showed up first thing around opening time and voila, we were seated as soon as we walked through the door. \\nWe ordered 2 things: 1) The Black Pasta, aka squid ink pasta, and chose to go with the Aglio Olio route. The pasta was a bit on the undercook side but edible and I tasted the slight bitter sweetness of the squid ink and the grounded squid and garlic in olive oil in which the pasta was tossed was on the bland side and needed the grated parmesan and chili flakes to dress it up. I'm not sure if this was intentional but I think this dish could have been better if it were properly cooked and seasoned from the kitchen. The prime time show for this lunch was the Lobster Fra Daviolo. And yes, the portion is huge...large enough to serve 4 adults. At $78/pan, yes, pan, the serving vessel in which this Lobster Fra was cooked and serve, the seafood contained in the pan is pretty good. The lobster was live and butchered right in front of your eyes and you may have to avert your eyes if you don't want to see the act because the kitchen in this place is right in the dining area. \\nI find the Lobster Fra's presentation to be awe-inspiring, like flashy things in Las Vegas but the taste was a bit pedestrian. The lobster, being cooked at the same time as the sauce and pasta, turned out tough and rubbery and its freshness ruined. Like meeting a handsome man with the appearance and gravitas to find out there's absolutely no substance in his brain is how I felt metaphorically about this Lobster Fra. At least now I know, and am glad to have tried it to tell you all about it. \\nSo if you're really curious and don't mind standing in long lines for a good looking dish that taste pretty much like something you can get anywhere else then do wait in line or show up early like me. But be warned, the pan is huge so come prepare to eat!"},{"name":"Pok Pok","address":"3226 SE Division St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"As many  times as my wife go for lunch here, we know what to expect but the Thai dishes always exceed expectations.

And they'll even bring your order to your car if it's ready and paid for before you make it to the window! I thought it was a very nice touch and it definitely helped the chaos of that double line filtering into one.

So my mom and I was waiting outside on the bench. The hostess never called me nor texted me but when all the waiting was disappeared, we were the only ones who's waiting. Then three guys just came up and she gave them the table right away after looking at us. Then I had to ask her if there were any table going to come up because I didn't want to be rushed out after ordering my food for closing time. Then all of a sudden, she grabbed the menu and told me that she actually has a table for us.

So made our togo order and they overcharged me for one more menu. And if I didn't figure it out, it would have been like that. The guy who took my order told me like I'm the one who's wrong and sarcastically tried to show me the order and he was wrong! He didn't say sorry about it and tried to make a joke which was not funny at all.

Well 45 mins later after listening to the cooks yell for the staff from the back, bitch, piss and moan.  The food comes out jacked up.  My burger well done and egg over cooked.  The Mac and Cheese had NO cheese.  How do you fuck that up!! It's half of the recipe!!!!  We picked at our food, then paid, and left a bad review on the  lil payment dohickey.

So he goes back to his phone while we decide and...you feel it coming...finishes his text before looking up when we step up. ARE YOU KIDDING??? Then...when we ask a simple, \\"how big is the small vs. large?\\", he says as condescendingly as he can muster, \\"so...there are the sizes right there.\\" This would insinuate we were idiots who missed it right in front of our faces.

Two of the five girls who were in our party are Thai and have spent their whole lives eating Thai food - and they were doubly disappointed. We ended up spending $30/person for a lunch made up of boring food served in meager portions.\\n\\nWith the exception of the fish sauce wings, everything was bland.  Kai Yaang is supposed to be flavorful and moist; this \\"game hen\\" literally tasted like nothing but seasonless chicken.  The Khao Soi had no heat to it at all!  Thai food is commonly known for being spicy and full of flavor...the dishes we tried had neither of those two qualities.\\n\\nWe learned later from a server at a highly rated Portland restaurant (that DOES live up to its hype) that Pok Pok has really gone downhill in recent years since the owner spends most of his time at his Brooklyn branch.

My friends often want to drink good beer, while I want to eat good food. Our desires were often mutually exclusive. \\n\\nThe first thing you notice is the HUGE space. As my friend describes, the place is looming, but warm. It's an expensive industrial space. She aptly described the space as \\"rustic bourgeoisie\\", but with a very modern feel. \\n\\nBecause we went late at night, only the pizzas and bar snacks were available. Of course, I didn't hesitate with getting pizza. The margarita had a light, slightly sweet sauce with a good amount of acidity. The tomatoes were even sweeter. The smoked burrata really rounded out the flavours. The fungi was also tasty with spinach, feta, parmesan and roasted garlic cream. (You can ask for the parmesan to be held if you are a vegetarian that does not eat any products that have to do with the death of an animal, since parmesan has rennet, which is derived from cow intestines.) I was told that the duck confit pizza was also good. It was a strange mix with duck confit, cilantro and BBQ sauce. Little confit. The BBQ sauce was overpowering and my friends couldn't taste the confit so much, but could feel the texture. Regardless, it was still a good combination and they liked it. Steel Toad goes for the thin, wood-fired approach when it comes to their pizzas. They have a perfectly crisp crust--it is puffy and crispy at the edges especially and the bottom maintains the crispness all the way towards the centre. Yet, the interior of the crust was soft throughout.  There were bubbles but the pizza was not burnt. They were generous with cheese, but not in an excessive way. The dough is house made. They can actually run out of the dough, so I suggest you implore the pizza as soon as you can!\\n\\nI love pretzels, so I automatically ordered that. It was very soft, in an almost undercooked manner. It was more like bread. It seems like it's whole wheat and/or whole grain, but I'm not really sure. Clearly, I don't know much about food! I know I liked it though. Their pretzels are handmade in their kitchen and served warm with mustard.\\n\\nWe had free house-brewed beer flights due to licensing issues. I'm not much of a beer person, but they were good to me with very distinct flavours from one another. My friend got the earl grey cocktail, which was great. It was well-balanced with a good amount of citrus, while the tea flavour was still evident. \\n\\nI was told that they would probably get their license for selling their own house beers by next weekend. They also had guest beers, R & B Raven Cream Ale and Hefeweizen, that they were able to serve and sell. They also have cocktails and spirits, which makes them quite different from other breweries. \\n\\nEveryone there was super friendly. Service was great.\\n\\nOk, I saved the best for the last. As my friend calls it, they have \\"next level\\" sinks. Their faucets also double as hand dryers. After washing your hands under sensor-activated faucet, you touch the bars attached to the sides of the faucet and air comes from under these Dyson hand dryers. +1 for cool factor.\\n\\nI will definitely go again to try their brunch, lunch and dinner offerings.

He was a loud obnoxious server. I felt like my ears were going to pop being that every word that came out from his mouth was 3x as loud! No joke! But he was prompt with our services. Yet, I was still annoyed with his personality service just because he wasn't as friendly and calm. I thought it was a bit too harsh. (I'm sure he stands out from the rest of the other waiters.) (FAILED)\\n\\nFOOD: \\n1. Coral Infused Tagliatelle, Poached Maine Lobster, Chanterelles, Grapefruit, Vanilla Lobster Emulsion  $ 31\\n(BAD)\\n\\nThe presentation and taste for this pasta dish wasn't appetizing or fancy enough to be priced over $30! And the dish wasn't as clearly descriptive by menu or by waiter. \\n\\nIt is common to assume that most pasta comes out soft  unless says otherwise, it came out to be 'al dente' ('Italian' term for firm pasta) but it wasn't tasting right as if it was still too raw and the taste was a bit bland. Oh, and very little lobster bits. (They need to revise the presentation and details of this particular dish.) (FAILED)\\n\\n2. Grand Marnier Souffl√© please allow 25 minutes for preparation, available after 5:00 $ 10\\n(GOOD)\\n\\nSoft and Sweet.\\n\\nMY THOUGHT: \\nIt's a French Restaurant not Italian! I'm not much of a pasta snob but logically most pasta dish comes to be soft. So, if it isn't meant to be soft then it should be explained to the guest before serving. It's important to mention in details when it comes to the texture of pastas!\\n\\nMORE CONCERNED COMPLAINTS:\\nSo I addressed the waiter about my dish and he clearly said OUT LOUD (and heard by the entire table) that he will have the chef make me a \\"new dish\\". I was going to stick with the dish unhappily (cause I was being nice) but he insisted so I let him.  When the pasta came back out, my bowl of pasta looked even worse than when it was brought out the first time. It just looked reheated and so the pasta shrunk and look unappetizing, watered down too. It didn't looked newly made. I literally lost my appetite. I felt ripped off and fooled. Also, halfway the stay at this restaurant while poking at my unappetizing pasta dish the manager came to concern with my unsatisfying meal. I asked him if this dish was just reheated or newly made. He answered it was new. I was already under the impression it was reheated and didn't think he wanted to get busted so he said new. Of course the courtesy, he removed my dish off the bill but he also took away the dish instantly. Ugh! I was curious to why would the manager still came out when the problem was semi fixed when I had answered to the waiter that I'll accept the dish. I then realized that there was a surveillance camera on the ceiling. Assuming, we were being watched as we're eating! Creepy? (UGH!)\\n\\nMANAGEMENT: MANAGER: Very persistent on correcting my unhappy meal error.  I will give credit for the right way to compensate. (THUMBS)\\n\\nATMOSPHERE: Sophisticated. Ideal for romance.\\n(THUMBS)\\n\\nSUGGESTION:\\n1. May be best to just stay around the bar area or at the least the first floor. (the restroom is on the first floor anyway. =p)\\n\\n2. May be best for drinks and appetizer if you want to be on the safer side for having a good time (at night). \\n\\nIf anyone has any Qs or comments to share with me, like the different experience or concerns please feel free to send me a message!

The pork ones were definitely better in terms of flavor. However, I wasn't a huge fan of them. I thought they needed noodles in them and would have been a lot better with peanut sauce (but I'm also just a big fan of peanut sauce). For the main, I ordered the Vietnamese Chicken Curry. I thought the both was thin, kind of a bit more like soup than curry -- but it was tasty. There were large pieces of chicken, potato, and carrot. Liked it overall. My friend ordered the Rice Vermicelli bowl with chicken, but he wished he ordered it with pork after having the spring rolls. The chicken didn't have all that much flavor. \\n\\nDESSERT: Flan and million dollar cake. Both were pretty good. \\n\\nSERVICE: Mostly okay until we needed the check.

Some of the dishes I have tried in the past are less than stellar. \\n\\nHowever, that's frankly to be expected with such an extensive menu (I think 50 main dishes). I would argue the menu is too extensive, given that most restaurants in Korea specialize in 2-20 main dishes, but I understand that Manna is trying to do what it can to provide a broad selection of decent/good Korean food in a town with few Korean restaurants. It's unfair to penalize them too much for some subpar dishes.\\n\\nI would recommend finding dishes that you enjoy, and sticking with those. For me, that's grilled mackerel. My wife really likes the  (champon) and the  (yukgaejang).

Not sure if it was really that dark (I soon adjusted to it), but with few windows (it IS in a basement under the Wonder Ballroom after all) and somewhat dark walls it sure seemed that way.\\n\\nAs nichole noted, there are lots of mirrors on the walls and pillars - including directly to the left of the entrance door. With my eyes adjusting to the light I almost walked into the mirror then thought, \\"who's that charmingly handsome looking cad who won't get out of my way?\\" I was visually tripped out for a minute or two.\\n\\nWe grabbed a spot at the bar and I perused their drink menu thirsty for my 1st beer of the night...wait a minute...Bridgeport IPA, Widmer Hefe...2 more less than stellar beers...$4 each (some macro brew horse pi$$ for a buck less)? Uhhm, this is a pretty poor beer selection indeed.\\n\\nI decided I'd rather spend 50% more and get a nice cocktail instead of trying to decide which was the least boring looking beer. I ordered up a B.L.T. (Bulleit bourbon, lemon wedge, tonic) - very nice, strong pour, slightly sweet and very refreshing. Right around this time of year I usually switch up my scotch/bourbon/whiskey drinks for gin, rum, tequila, or vodka (usually in that order of preference) - but a drink like a BLT could help me keep enjoying bourbon well into the summer months.\\n\\nSince we had other plans for food, I only briefly glanced at their very small food menu - nothing much stood out to me, and if we HAD been eating there I'm sure I would have gone with a Wonderburger.\\n\\nI don't see Cafe Wonder as much of a destination - it's comfortable enough and pretty inoffensive, but the outdoor area is a rather pedestrian little strip of concrete alongside the building and indoors was pleasant but nothing you wouldn't find at a dozen or more bars much closer in. They pour a good cocktail, but we're not talking blow your mind complex drinks - and while mine tended towards the strong side, it wasn't one of those crazy $3.25 doubles you can score ad countless dive bars in town.\\n\\nIf I was seeing a show at the Wonder Ballroom I wouldn't hesitate to grab a cocktail and maybe a snack in the Cafe, but with a smallish food menu and a poor beer selection, there's just not enough here to keep me coming back."},{"name":"Steel Toad Brewpub & Dining Hall","address":"97 E 2nd Avenue","city":"Vancouver","stars":"3","text":"If you love good food and expecting good service, don't waste your time, you'll be disappointed going here.

To me, this reeked of a false sense of upward identification, like when we would go on family vacations and my parents would tell strangers we were \\"from Boston\\" when we were actually from Hanover. How could I possibly frequent a place that couldn't be forthright about their location?\\n\\nThis frustrated me with each passing, until I begin to allow the possibility that I was misreading the intended emphasis in the name. What if, instead of indicating their proximity to the Common, the owners were intending to communicate a sense of humility? Boston COMMON Coffee, meaning that the drinks were average, banal, bourgeois, and Plebian? This sense of self-loathing surely could not generate healthy commerce. With compassion, I decided to give this place the confidence boost it needed by stopping in for a cuppa.\\n\\nSurprisingly, not a bad spot by any means! Fans of Starbucks will be comfortable with the prices and drink quality, but, perhaps, will find the DIY nature of the establishment endearing. Tip jars were not glorified piggy banks under lock and key, but cups upon which an eager \\"Thank You!\\" was enthusiastically sharpie'd. Seating was ample and, from the looks of it, quite comfortable and welcoming, compared to the \\"Serve 'em and boot 'em\\" lack of decorum exhibited by national chains.\\n\\nUnfortunately, I intended to travel to the South End with my drink, which is where the -1 star originates in this review.\\n\\nThe travel cups used by Boston Common Coffee Co., which are supplied by International Paper, suffer from a severe case of \\"seam drip.\\" For the uninitiated, this phenomenon occurs when the plastic lid is insufficient to cover the gap created by the overlapping quarter-inch of cardboard where the cup is glued together.  What results is considerable leakage when it is exposed to the typical bumps and vibrations of urban foot travel.\\n\\nNo coffee shop that opts for paper-based vessels is immune to occasional bouts of seam drip. Typically, however, moderate lid adjustment is sufficient to dam the deluge. For example, making certain the seam is positioned 180 degrees from the \\"sippy hole\\" in the lid is usually a good strategy. Not so with Boston Common Coffee's cup, which left my hand soaking and reeking of French Roast after only two short blocks of travel. \\n\\nThe cautious take-out consumer would do well to order a size up, as I would estimate that I lost up to 20% of my drink to the Boston sidewalk today. That said, I realize that most of the blame for this mild annoyance lies with International Paper and not with Boston Common Coffee. However, a cursory trial run with one of these cups would have almost certainly convinced the staff here to penny up for a more versatile supplier."},{"name":"Moonshine Patio Bar & Grill","address":"303 Red River St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"Excellent!

The older blonde waitress that worked on Sunday lunch 7/7/2013 was unbelievably rude to the poor couple seated next to us.\\n\\nWe went on a Sunday afternoon just after opening and ended up waiting 75 minutes to get in.  There were clean tables open but the older blonde waitress was moving so slowly that it took 10-15 minutes for her to get the orders out and begin seating people (why can't they have the busser help seat??)  She looked kind of confused reading the slips and trying to figure out which food went to what table.\\n\\nWe had a baked clam (amazing), calamari (decent enough), and squid ink pasta (was better the last time when the older Asian chef cooked it.  This time the flavor just wasn't there).  \\n\\nAnd this is when the drama happened - the poor couple next to us found a cigarette butt in their calamari and quietly complained to the waitress.  The waitress didn't say anything and just left the calamari, cigarette butt and all on the table.  Finally, after 50 minutes of the couple just sitting there, not touching their food, she came around and said \\"I'm sorry this happened, I've never seen it before\\" and never offered to take anything off the bill, make a new order or offer anything else in exchange.  When they asked for the bill, the waitress yelled at them to sit tight and wait since she has customers to serve and took her sweet time going to the back register to take a breather.  When the couple again asked for their check, the waitress (once again) yelled at them to just finish their food and then they'll get their check.  After the 10 minutes of being yelled at by the waitress in front of all the restaurant diners, the couple said they're going to take their food to go and demanded to have the check right away.  The waitress yelled at them some more to sit down and brought over a check for the full amount.  \\n\\nThe guy went over to the waitress and demanded to speak to management, and the waitress just said management wasn't there and that they'll have to call a telephone # to get their money back.  The couple paid the bill and left 90% of their meal untouched in to go containers.  The waitress quickly cleaned that away and pretended like nothing happened.  \\n\\nHonestly Daily Catch, I know your food is good (for the most part, when the right chefs are cooking) and people wait for hours to get into your restaurant, but you shouldn't get away with egregiously bad customer service.  Bullying your customers into paying for a fried cigarette butt and yelling at them in front of other diners is just bad practice.  You really should have picked better wait staff. I don't care if the waitress is my grandma's age, you just don't yell at customers like they're garbage in front of a packed room full of diners, especially not when they've  patiently waited 75 minutes and paid $90 for a fried cigarette butt and then waited another hour for an apology, a nice gesture, a new order of calamari, or just something small taken off the bill.  \\n\\nMy boyfriend and I felt awkward just being there so we quickly finished our food and left.

In comparison to another buffet style brunch like Jack Allen's its mediocore. People in Austin have no idea what a real \\"Southern Comfort\\" breakfast brunch is..especially buffet style. This is more like a Southwest Southern comfort. There were no traditional items on the buffet; instead creative traditional items that tasted bland. For example, they had 4 different kinds of eggs but all similar with your go-to Tex-Mex ingredients...No French toast, bacon and their corn beef was questionable. The wait is not worth the quality. Go to Jack Allen's instead and even they are not that great but both charge about the same and its free parking at JAs admin you can make reservations.

The place was empty which was a bit surprising but I guess the extremely popular Dine Out restaurants were booked. We thought we'd give this a go since we walk/drive by it all the time and have never been. As dinner progressed, it started to get busier. \\n\\nOur server, Daniel, was fantastic. Very friendly and easygoing. As the evening progressed, he was swamped because there were only two servers in the entire place. I even saw a bartender help with bringing out food.\\n\\nNow onto the food:\\n\\n- The oysters were delicious. We got two types but ended up liking the Lighthouse so we ordered more. My one complaint about them is that there were a few bits of shell in the oysters.\\n\\n- My sablefish soup was delicious. My girlfriend loved it too. It was done perfectly. One complaint is that it was warm but not hot. I like my soup with a little bit of steam coming out of it. This felt like it had been warming all day.\\n\\n- My girlfriend loved her arugula salad with the camabert cherry sauce. She felt it cut the spiciness of the arugula and the nice squash really made the dish work together. Lucky for me, she loves salad because nothing on that plate looked appetizing to me :P\\n\\n- Her cedar salmon didn't have any cedar flavor. I suspect those cedar planks were reused so many times they had no essential oils of the wood left in them. If you were blindfolded, you would have no idea that that fish was cooked on a cedar plank. The rest of her dish was nice. Her kale was cooked perfectly (according to her) and her barley wild rice pilaf was delicious (i stole some). That dish needed a zing. Perhaps cooking that fish with some herbs and lemon near it for fragrance would have helped, or even a splash of lemon on the fish after.\\n\\n- The wine pairing for her fish entree really didn't work together. Definitely need something else to pair with that fish because they didn't enhance the dish. In fact, the tartness of that white wine really took away from that dish. It was so tart and then you dug into this flavorless salmon. No go for me. It also wasn't a good wine to begin with, in my books. She tried to choke it down but I told her to give up and just leave it. No point trying to finish a wine you don't even like!\\n\\n- My beef cheeks were fall apart tender. They were so tender they were like beef short ribs but with more fat (not complaining!). My issue with this dish is that I assume beef cheeks are expensive because the portion was tiny. On top of that, the texture of the beef cheeks (being so tender and soft) did not go well with a bed of mashed potatoes and what tasted like pureed squash or something. Soft on soft of soft was just not working for me. It would have paired better perhaps with her wild rice and barley pilaf, or something firmer to hold up to the softness of the meat. It would have been nice to get more than three length cut half baby carrots (in other words, a total of 1.5 baby carrots). At least be nice and give me 3 whole baby carrots, preferably cooked and not just thrown on in the last few seconds. On top of that, my mashed potatoes were tepid while the beef cheeks were piping hot. I hate food that's been sitting. \\n\\n- The peanut butter mousse was so heavy and it just tasted like a kid mashed up banana, chocolate and peanut butter and served it to you. I took one bite and rudely put half the bite back on the spoon and made an ick face like a spoiled child - I admit it. \\n\\n- The sorbet on the other hand was amazing. We shared that one happily. Everything worked so well together. It tasted like were in a tropical place. Delicious!\\n\\n\\nThe reason for 3 stars has to do with the fact some portions of the dish didn't work well together, the lack of flavor of the fish, shells in the oysters, and portion size. I left hungry. I know Dine Out has a terrible reputation for small portions and this time, I'd agree with that assessment."},{"name":"Domino's Pizza","address":"4161 Hastings Street","city":"Burnaby","stars":"3","text":"We moved to the Burnaby Heights area back in May 2015 and had to switch up our Domino's location.

Awful service.\\n\\nMy friends wanted to take me here for dinner after work because they really liked this place. I had not eaten for the whole day so i was on the verge of flipping out if i don't get a food in me soon. I was a bit hesitant because i dont like spicy food but they said that they adjust the food to your liking. So we went..\\n\\nThe ambience was nice. It was candlelit. Although the utensils were cloudy and the women's washroom light was busted. Maybe it was part of the whole candlelit thing?\\n\\nAs we were ordering our food, i noticed our server was multitasking. She was grabbing the menus as she was \\"listening\\" to our orders. Me, being a picky eater, was anxious that she was not writing things down. So i made my order easier for her. My friends had the stuffed chicken wings for appetizer and pad thai (no cilantro and not spicy) and crab meat with rice, while i had the duck garden salad roll and green curry with chicken also not spicy. \\n\\nThe food took over half an hour. We thought they were going to serve us both the appetizer and main at the same time from the span of time it took. The garden salad roll was horrible. The duck was starchy and im only able to eat it if i dip it in the sauce. The chicken wings were ok but im not sure if the skin was suppose to be crispy or stretchy. Because some of it are and aren't. And then the main comes..\\n\\nAnd of course, my curry was spicy. My friend's pad thai had cilantro and also spicy. At that moment, i thought to myself, that i should have just gone to Mcdonald's. I couldn't possibly wait an another hour for a new food so we decided not to send it back. The meat to vegetables ratio on the curry was so off. It probably only had 5 pieces of chicken in it. They were cut so small that i had to spoon the dish back and forth just to pick it out. And the rice.. For someone who has eaten rice her whole life, i know an old batch of rice when i see one. At least they had the decency to mix it with the freshly cooked batch but sorry, some people are still going to notice those hard little pieces of rice and would know what's up. \\n\\nEven waiting for the box to get our \\"food\\" to go (Of course we didnt finish it.) took a long time. My friends said it was not usually like that. Maybe they were short staffed. Maybe they change cooks. Who knows. But after that experience, i dont think i can give it a second chance.

So after swearing off Pinky's and trying some other places, we're back to being a Pinky's household again. Their pizza really is the best and when they can make it all work it's amazing... but when they can't it's so disappointing. The last few times pizzas have been coming decently on time and not pooled into gooey messes. I was starting to have hope. Hope that was quickly changed when we got the pizza tonight. Arrived at a decent time, but instead of doing a half cheese, half steak as ordered, it was all steak. Not such a big deal in that I'm not allergic to steak or vegetarian so it'll still get eaten, but just disappointing. I really just wanted my side of the pizza to have cheese on it and nothing had to be done to that one side of the pizza but put cheese on it.

Don't get me wrong, I believe that a good steak doesn't need steak sauce, but that doesn't mean u charge for it.\\n\\nThey were nice enough to cut up our steak for us and the center was a nice medium-well. However every bite was not created equally and thus my hopes were let down and they were just an average steakhouse with incredibly high prices.  The truffle butter was ok. My husband liked it. But it was not worth the extra $4. The mushrooms and rice were really good, but my husband said I make it better. After the food was dropped off, it was about 20 min until anyone came to check on us. Dessert was complimentary because of his bday, but besides lighting a candle the waiter was not very enthusiastic in presenting it.\\n\\nOverall, was not impressed and we were disappointed for my husband's 30th birthday.

The bar is large with a semi-circular bar in the middle, and service is very good from very attractive waitresses.

Tried a mango salsa that had a little kick to it, cole slaw with a nice crunch, hush puppies, and a marinated string bean.Tried the alligator tail, caught nearby, which was lightly battered and fried.

Really, the only criteria that I was looking for was for food that sounded decent, bottomless mimosas, and not needing to go far out of my way to get there.  The Nook showed up that met most of my criteria, and I remember many evenings in the past spent at this location's former business, soaking in suds after slow-pitch co-ed rec-league softball at Piedmont Park, so I decided that this would be my plan A, because when it comes to dining in Atlanta, not having fallbacks is only setting yourself up for failure.\\n\\nThe Nook is located on the west side of Piedmont Park, directly across Piedmont Ave.  Parking is limited to the sparse number of spaces on the street on Piedmont or any of the adjacent cross streets, or the \\"complimentary\\" valet.  I drive a stick, don't trust valets to not ride my clutch, and the combination of feeling that valet parking is pretentious and I don't want to tip people to fry my clutch typically leads me to relying on the former.  Otherwise, this is the kind of place that city dwellers applaud for not being too car-friendly, leading it to be \\"owned\\" by walkers, bicyclists and transit users.\\n\\nArriving right at the advertised opening time of 11 a.m. on a Saturday morning, I was able to luck into a street spot, as well as relatively not too much of a wait for an inside table. The patio is as nice as I remember it from its former tenants, but being the midst of a typical Georgia summer, the indoors seemed like a better idea during my visit.\\n\\nThe interior is cozy and at right atmosphere that rings neighborhood bar, without feeling pretentious.  It's pretty obviously a Michigan State bar, based on all the green Spartans logos all over the place, but at least they weren't Ohio State.\\n\\nService was decent throughout my visit, and my server was knowledgeable about things that I asked about that weren't on any menus, like bottomless mimosas; oddly, they're not on the menu anywhere, and at $7 a pop for kind of weak mimosas, I'd imagine going bottomless is an easier way to get your money's worth.\\n\\nUltimately, I ended up going with chicken with biscuits and gravy.  I was very intrigued by the numerous tater tot and totcho options they had on the menu, but I know I could get those at any other visit; brunches demanded some brunch-like food to indulge in.  The chicken was juicy, and the biscuits were fluffy and soft.  Needless to say, the quality of the food was definitely above average.\\n\\nOverall, my The Nook experience was positive.  The parking could easily make this place avoidable for those who drive, but stuff like totchos and stuffed burgers aren't often found at many other places in the city.  Their menu is a little misleading and lacking in information, like if bottomless mimosas existed or not, and their drinks were a little weak for what you pay for.  Regardless, I was satisfied with my visit, and until I wreck one of their stuffed burgers, I have genuine reason to come back in the future."},{"name":"Rocking Frog Cafe","address":"2511 SE Belmont St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Cute place with great ambiance and good food, including Ristretto coffee and freshly made doughnuts. \\n\\nHowever, a recent and somewhat drastic price increase has turned this regular customer of Rocking Frog into a regular customer of Crema, who make their own bread, serve a variety of coffees from a French Press and charge significantly less.

I had the chicken and waffles and it was really tasty.  The chicken was three nice sized chicken tenders with a side of gravy for dipping.  The waffle was a fluffy, sweet concoction that reminded me of a funnel cake.  The chicken was nicely seasoned and was tasty, but the gravy didn't really do it for me.  No matter, I just used the syrup for dipping that, too though it didn't need any accompaniment.

Due to a licensing mishap, they can't serve the beer they brewed and had to drain the tanks - I hope whoever was on charge of paperwork got fired. All they had to offer was one competitor's beer on tap and some cans. Not a very impressive selection for any bar.\\n\\nThe space itself is enormous and is decorated a lot classier than any other brewpub. It's a beautiful space, but I felt a little underdressed in jeans. The huge TV doesn't really fit with the mood, but there were people enjoying football, so I guess this place is trying to be a fancy sports bar/classy date night restaurant? Either way, it'll probably end up doing well with the after work crowd because there are a ton of tables to handle the afternoon rush.\\n\\nThere aren't a lot of appetizing vegetarian options on the menu and for $8 the fries is only a teeny cup. The other people at my table all had the same thing to say: The food is OK, but trying to be fancier than it is and not worth the extra price.

I have had the Seared Duck Breast with Swiss Chard, Gnocchi and Black Olives, which was very good but rich. After eating some of the plate you crave a simpler taste. I have also  had the Grilled Pork Chop, Sunchokes, Brussels Sprouts, but it was a little bland. For appetizers I most recently had the Marinated Sea Scallops. I originally was ordering them not realizing the fact that they are raw, and when my waiter pointed that out, I figured I would be adventurous and try it anyway. After trying it I believe it would be even better cooked. I have also tried the Spicy Lamb Tartar appetizer from a friend, it was good. For desserts I have tried the Quince & Apple Crumble, the Hazelnut Milk Chocolate Cake, Iced Pistachio Parfait, all of which were not extraordinary. My overall impression is that Bistro du Midi has a very nice atmosphere with food that can be hit or miss, but does have great wine.

Portions are served family style (there is a single plate option if you prefer) and rice pairings with different entrees.  You eat a lot with your hands so it can get messy. We had the Kai yaang, yam makhuea yue, muu sateh, and Ike's Vietnamese fish sauce wings. I have never had anything like the fish sauce wings. They did have nuts sprinkled on them but they could be scrapped off. The sauce is sweet, salty and a little tangy allay once, very good. I really like eggplant and all of its many texture so loved the yam makhuea yue, this went well with saffron rice and was savory with a little bit of sour. If you don't like eggplant steal clear.  The muu sateh was the least messy to eat, on a skewer with a mild curry sauce. The Kai yaang is meant to be eaten with sticky rice and dipped in sauce.

I love the tall windows pouring all the natural light in. \\n\\nI mainly go here for lunch. They have salads, various sandwiches, and some market items. Their plating is pretty nice. The sandwiches come on a wooden block and is laid out well. \\n\\nI tried their burger and short rib dip. They cook the burger to temp, and they're on of the few places that do in my opinion. The burger is juicy and delicious. It comes with some fries with homemade ketchup, mustard, and pickles on the side. It's a decent burger.\\n\\nTheir Short Rib Dip is good too. It comes with mushroom jus, which you dip your sandwich in. The consistency of the short rib is like pot roast. It's pretty good. \\n\\nI haven't had other dishes here, but I did see their Chopped Chicken Cobb Salad. It comes a lot of avocados and looks great. I might try it next time. The plating for the salad is pretty too.\\n\\nTheir prices are high though, so don't come in here looking to see some value. But you're paying for the atmosphere, the location, the service, and the food--in that order.  \\n\\nAlso, their website is annoying.

I don't mean this as a put down of the food or of purists but nothing is traditional, and that has been frustrating for some of my out of town guests. The pancakes are not fluffy white vehicles for maple syrup, they're hearty semolina cakes that are good enough to stand on their own. The biscuits and gravy is actually more like a \\"shortcake with roasted pork loin and herbed cream sauce\\" which is delicious but I don't think that description sells at a breakfast joint, so they just named it after the dish that inspired it. When the breakfast potatoes scare your guests, they'll probably want ketchup. The thick, dark, tomatoey condiment that they receive will not be comforting to the person looking for corn syrup and tomato paste in a squeeze bottle. So... If you're a breakfast purest, stick with eggs here. Oh, and Stumptown coffee. Everyone can appreciate Stumptown coffee.

I was eager to try out this place after hearing about how their food was \\"authentic\\" as the owner of the restaurant (and its chains) was a backpacker throughout Thailand during the '80s. Indeed, as I peered through the menu I saw many items not commonly found on typical Thai restaurant menus in the states. \\n\\nIke's Vietnamese Fish Sauce Wings - Very flavorful - almost too much so. Fish sauce deeply pervades this dish with its pungent odor, and prior to getting our own dish, I would get wafts of the cloying aroma from nearby tables with the same dish. Now, I must admit that I do not like fish sauce. I have never liked it, even during my own travels to Southeast Asia, where I recall disliking the scent whenever walking into any restaurant. I must give Pok Pok credit for having such a degree of authenticity, however, that upon smelling that smelly smell of its fish sauce in this dish, I instantly began to reminisce about my previous experiences in Thailand and Vietnam. Anyways, I digress too much. I didn't like this dish too much as it was too salty and too fish-saucey for my liking. However, I still was able to appreciate the authenticity of its flavors.\\n\\nKhao Soi (Chicken) - This wasn't like the typical khao soi that I've had in the past from Burmese restaurants. in fact I don't think I've ever had khao soi NOT from a Burmese restaurant prior to eating the dish here. This dish was much less heavier than its Burmese counterpart. I enjoyed it, but perhaps I was expecting a much more flavorful and heavy dish, and was somewhat disappointed when it didn't fulfill those expectations.\\n\\nMy group ordered a bunch of other dishes that I don't recall the names of. They were all pretty good. Nothing that really stuck out to me though.\\n\\nOverall the food here did not disappoint in terms of its legitimacy in evoking the flavors of Southeast Asia. I wish I enjoyed the food here more, but the sickly sweet flavors of that region have for some reason never been appealing to my palate. Even so, I would still definitely recommend anyone to come here to try it out, especially if you've previously experienced food from this region of the world before, and wish to relive such flavors without having to travel all the way across the globe."},{"name":"Vivo Austin","address":"6406 N I 35, Ste 2343","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"The new Vivo blows the old Vivo out of the water...and I liked the old Vivo.

They are crispy, delicious and made from scratch. \\n\\nIf you want a sampling, get the Emma's Choice, which comes with a puffy taco and an enchilada of your choice. The servers are quick, efficient and always keep your water full.\\n\\nThe only downside: the steak jalisco was very disappointing. It's a skirt steak with a cilantro sauce.

It's always a joy to spot delicious and innovative cold-pressed juice joints that offer fresh greens.

You can get a fresh juice on the spot or take out the bottled juices they have in the fridge. They also offer tons of nutritious green salads, smoothies, Vegan puddings, cleanses, t-shirts, protein bars, water, and tons of other healthy products. I particularly love this location because it has a cute outdoor area and is a great spot to hang out and enjoy your juice. They play awesome music and the staff is friendly and helpful. Parking is designated, but a bit sparse, albeit not impossible. \\n\\nI also like that they grade their juices and smoothies based on levels: Fresh & Easy; Next-Level; Even-Further. So anyone who doesn't want to get too hardcore with their juice can get something lighter or vice versa. They also offer nutritional supplements, taste makers, raw superfood drinks, and top shelf shots (try the Live Green-ade). If you love juice as much as I do, or you're curious about it and want to give it a try, Juiceland is the best place to explore your options.

We ended up sitting outside. Under the tent in the back, with the fans blowing cool air, it was actually quite nice. It also allowed us to walk off some of the big fat brunch each time we made our way back to the inside buffet.\\n\\nThe food was fantastic and our hungover waiter was sweet and always there when we needed him, which wasn't often because we are pretty low-maintenance. \\n\\nMy favorite items on the brunch menu were the little turkey croissant sandwiches, the king ranch casserole and the sticky buns.

Last Sunday I walked over to see the score of a game that I couldn't see from my seat and the manager walked over when I got back to the bar and asked \\"can I put the game you wanted to see on one of these TV's for you?\\"  I didn't even particularly care about the game, I just wanted to see the score and get the blood back into my legs for a precious few seconds but offering to change it for me really nice.  \\n\\nWe got the nachos and a bucket of Bud heavies (their yearly bucket special) and watched a number of games.

On one afternoon, a friend and I needed a refresher and a meal. He just recently moved to Pdx. We decided to stroll on Division st. I had eaten once here, and I was not that impressed. I remember thinking why is this place rated to high? So, I told my friend about its fame and he was like \\"hey, maybe we should go there\\" but I was like \\"I don't want to wait in line though\\" but we went anyway. It was about 6 pm on a Saturday afternoon. There was only 2 of us, and we approached the waiter. She said it would take 15 minutes to get a table, unless we don't mind sitting at the bar stool. So we did. No waiting at all. We contemplated with the menu for a while, and got distracted when someone brought out some deep fried fish or chicken and my friend got very excited with the sight he was seeing. We settled with the famous wings and papaya salad and sticky rice. He also got one of the coffee with socks. \\n\\nWe ditched the utensils and just used our hands. We are from SE Asia, so eating with hand is what we usually do anyway. It is almost impossible to eat the wings with utensils. We dipped the sticky rice in the papaya salad and chase it with the wing. The combo was perfect. It has been hot in pdx, so it felt very refreshing. The socks ice coffee is good too, they use Stumptown beans. A couple who was sitting in  front of us called the waiter and pointed at our food. They must have been watching us and were intrigued to try the same thing.\\n\\nService was a little slow and the person who was responsible for our table was very busy. All in all, the food is good, but the portion is a little small and pricey, esp the papaya salad. The ambience of the restaurant itself is very relaxing and they did a good job with the decor.

On our last trip we had ordered from the raw bar and some cooked items, this time we just want to order oysters.

But, my vacation was coming to a close and I was scheduled to fly out the next morning out of Austin. And so, here I was at Rudy's Country Store & Barbeque for last chance Texas barbecue.\\n\\nRudy's seems to be unique, as I have been told. But to be here in person was interesting and special. Especially because that they ask you where you're from, then announce it to the rest of the staff. Then they do this chant about newbies at their restaurant. It was cool though, since I don't think they get visitors from Hawaii all that much anyway. With that said, Rudy's Country Store seems like your convenience store with a unique Texas twist. They have a store side and a food side. Most people were here for the food. The experience here was quite memorable and I am glad that my friends took me here for my last hurrah in Texas - until further notice. It felt like being at a butcher shop and at a fast food restaurant truck stop. It's a little weird and interesting at the same time. For what its worth though, interesting and new is what Yelp is all about. Discovering new places, tastes, and the ambiance is what makes Yelp amazing and helpful all in one bow. With that said, I myself enjoyed myself here at Rudy's, even though the experience here was a little funny and weird at the same time. I bet I am one of the few people from Hawaii who've dined here, but I could be wrong though. Maybe the first ever? \\n\\nThe overall experience here at Rudy's Country Store & Barbeque is as epic and average as you can get without being gushy about this place. Granted that this place is far from fancy and refined, it was a good choice to get some meaty goodness in Austin, Texas. Although they're selling various cuts of meat at a premium price, they let me taste the various small cuts of meat before I settled on 2 of them, including the prime rib cut. I had ¬º of the smoky flavored one and the  1/2 lb of the prime rib cut. They don't use traditional plates, so they gave us some disposable paper to use as a plate. I suppose it was kind of hygienic, but it works and you just throw it away without much effort. I also got a couple of sides from the freezer prior to getting into the line, which was basically a large tub of coleslaw and a chocolate type of dessert to finish off the meal. I figure, go big or go home kind of mentality. The final total came out to be around $35, but it was worth it, considering when I may or may not return to Austin Texas for another fun outing. This meal shall be remembered as being quite epic and adventurous, since I don't normally know Texas barbeque until today. While they don't have barbecue sauce already smothered on the meat itself, I rather enjoy it plain, so you can savor the flavors without the added smoky style.\\n\\nMy friends and I sat outside talking and eating our dinner and it was a lot of fun. We arrived here around 8pm and it was a hoot and a half. We must've spent about 1  1/2 hours here before heading home. Rudy's Country Store & Barbecue is located at 11570 Research Blvd here in the heart of northwest Austin, TX. It's right off the TX-183, so you can't really miss it. They take major credit cards, so that's always a good thing for myself and others who plastic as a lifestyle choice. The parking here is good and generous. While it seemed like it was a full lot, we managed to find a space to park, which was good and we didn't have to wait too long for our orders either. The line itself was about 6 deep at the time I was there on a Tuesday February evening. It went smoothly, as I suspected everyone in front of me knew what they wanted. For me though, as soon as I saw the menu, the prime rib caught my eye and that was when I knew I wanted to have that. It was a definite treat for me - even after running 100 marathons/ultras. The prime rib was definitely gorgeous and can't thank my friends enough for bringing me here. Even though the restaurant here was interesting and unique, they do good prime rib here.\\n\\nI would recommend coming here, if you are meat head and love a good prime rib. Get here to Austin, Texas and you will get in a good steak at a reasonable cost. 4.5  stars for the overall experience. 4.5 stars for the prime rib and the festive introduction for me being a newbie to the restaurant. 4.0 stars for the service, even though there wasn't any.

Some of the other food runners seemed to find it a chore when we asked what we were eating (Or they were so quiet about it, we truly couldn't hear what they had said). \\n\\nThe decor is lovely, though the high top chairs almost forced you to leave as soon as possible because they are quite uncomfortable. They have a maximum stay of two hours and I think they can be assured of that based on how comfortable the seating is. \\n\\nOverall, I will likely be back to update this review because I think the kitchen has some excellent skill...

I can say that I was surprised and delighted at every different bite I had. Each dish's flavor profile was exquisite. I tasted flavors brought out of fish I never thought possible - some bites were citrusy, others were sweet, and some had a savory, spicy kick. What's more was that the service and bar were on point. From what I hear, Chef Chris and and Manager Alex have retained much of the talent from MF Buckhead.

From the sutle green colors to the comfortable booths, this place is going to be a hit. Of course once the weather is on our side, the outdoor patio will certainly be the \\"in\\" place to be seen in Midtown Atlanta, finished off with a newly installed trellis.\\n\\nAh, but the food! You expect problems, especially since this was the first day of operations (altho not yet open to the public.) Our party consisted of 4 people. Our waiter, Jabel was quick, courteous and explained the brunch menu to us. Our table ordered the Shrimp and Grits (2 of those) and I had an omelette with a side of white cheddar grits. OMG! These grits are to die for! I'm not a grits expert, but the others at the table said the were at the top of the list. The omelette was light, and filled with spinich, ham, peppers and onions. Ray ordered the steak and egg wrap. His was a bit cold in the middle, and a review with the chef already seems to have fixed that problem.  The Shrimp and Grits actually came with sausage, peppers onions, fresh spinach leaves and a topping of chicken broth. It was agreed the broth would be best served on the side.\\n\\nThen there is the Bananas Foster French Toast! Four pieces, covered in a delicious sauce with bananas....it's a great share item for 4 people along with another entree, which is what we did! \\n\\nThe brunch menu is not all traditional eggs, bacon and toast, yet is not one of those that you go...\\"whatever.\\" Anyone can find something good on it.\\n\\nThe regular menu, which of course we did not taste from, has a great selection of sandwichs, salads and such...and the best part.

When the patron at another table complained about the mussels, the manager (I think) came around to check on everyone else who had ordered that appetizer, which was very thoughtful and our water glasses were rarely less than half full.  Our complaint was with the waitress and the sommelier.  \\n\\nI ordered a cocktail prior to dinner (glad I did), but my boyfriend wanted a bottle of wine.  He had a question about the wine list and the waitress offered to send over the sommelier, great!  However, it took so long for the sommelier to arrive that she came back 2 times to say he was still coming.  When he came, his advice was less than helpful, but we chose a bottle of wine and waited.  \\n\\nThe bread/butter came and went... we waited.  My cocktail was gone... we waited.  Our appetizer came and went... we waited.  Our entrees came... still waiting.  At this point, my boyfriend had been sitting with nothing to drink the entire time, over an hour.  We kept looking around expectantly and another waiter noticed and went right over and brought our bottle of wine (not sure how he knew) and said, \\"Is this what you're looking for?\\"  It was, but by that time, we were halfway through our meal and decided that we weren't going to drink a bottle anymore.  Opted for 2 glasses of wine instead.  It cost them about $70+ in missed revenue, I guess.  Anyway, we enjoyed the wine with dessert... though usually we'll have a coffee or espresso in addition.  Oh well. \\n\\nI have to assume this is the exception, as others have commented on the great service. I just was very disappointed with this aspect of the experience and it did leave a bad impression.  I expected more from a restaurant of this caliber."},{"name":"Torchys Tacos","address":"4301 W William Cannon Dr, Ste G-400","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"Great food and fun atmosphere.
