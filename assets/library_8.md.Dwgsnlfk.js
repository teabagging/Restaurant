That gives the pasta and meat a bit more of an opportunity to absorb the flavors and actually results in a somewhat palatable dish when it's reheated, provided that you add your own salt, garlic, olive oil, and fresh parmesan cheese.

Had the Tod Mann (fish cakes), nice and chewy, deeply golden fried, small coins and a touch spicy.  The spring roll, really you can't much go wrong with deep fried.  It was piping hot, beautifully golden and light and crispy, filled with cellphane noodles and vegetables.  The entrees were OK, rather Americanized, but tasty nonetheless.  My Phad Kee Mao (Drunken Noodles) were not discernibly spicy and they should have been.  Sauce was quite sweet and rather salty.  Enough beef and vegetables for me.  The Tom Kha Gai was really a hit, very authentic, and tart, and super creamy with coconut milk.  Deliciously addictive, good heat (spiciness and temperature).  The Siam Calamari was interestingly mostly vegetable tempura, with some calamari rings, not what we expected, but not an unpleasant or unwarranted surprise.  Batter was light and crisp on the smooth vegetables, a little dense and bready on the \\"fluffier\\" vegetables, like the broccoli.

Her response was, \\"It should be coming out soon as I put the order in a long time ago.\\"  By 7:30, more than one hour after we ordered, still no food.  A man who appeared to be some type of manager then came over to our table and said that the food was coming right out.  5-7 minutes after he made that statement, we still had not received our food.  I see him at the bar and give him a look.  He then went into the kitchen and came out with our food.\\n\\nWhen I asked him what took so long, there were no apologies.  Instead, in a real condescending tone, he said that everything is \\"cooked to order.\\"  Well, considering we had ordered over one hour before, the food should have arrived much sooner.

Decorwise, the place could use some renovating, buffetwise it could have used a little more variety, but tastewise, it was pretty solid.  The chicken tikka masala had a little tang to it as it should since it is traditionally tomato based and the pakora was nice and crispy.  They also had a some kheer for desert, a little sweeter than most places but good to the last rice grain.

Getting the itis after made me question if I've had real barbeque until I came here.

We lost all motivation to move or go out later that night. But the food was REALLY GOOD. They smoke the meat in the back of their small kitchen and you can taste it in every bite. They have a great happy hour menu but I would recommend that you get over there regardless of the time. Some things were more pricey and other things were less so you can figure out combos that fit your budget. Sharing is recommended either way. It might not look like a giant pile of meat but it will settle in your stomach that way! \\n\\nI liked the mac and cheese a lot, the pork on top was pretty good, the sausage was ok - it was tough and too greasy.

I can't imagine this place ever being at capacity. There were plenty of booths and tables, and a few very large tables in the back (for parties of up to 20). The decorating was aesthetically pleasing, and it was a comfortable environment. There is a smallish bar on one side of the restaurant. The restrooms are nice and, overall, the  whole space is quite comfortable. \\n\\nThe Food: I had the General Tso's chicken and my friend had a combo dish with shrimp, vegetables and a spicy sauce. The menu is fairly large -- pretty standard for a Chinese place. They have a wide offering of beef, chicken, pork and seafood dishes, many a la cart items, a reasonably large drink menu, and dessert to boot. The food was very good, probably some of the best General Tso's I've had -- but I wouldn't necessarily call it \\"gourmet.\\" I wasn't looking for gourmet, however, so that didn't bother me. I believe calling it gourmet may be a bit misleading, however. The portions were reasonable, and, as is the case at most Chinese sit-down restaurants, the rice was all-you-can-eat. Me and my friend both came with big appetites and still took a serving of food home.   \\n\\nThe Price: Dinner and drinks for me and my friend came to around $45. You're not going to break the bank here, but most of the entrees came in at a healthy $12-20. \\n\\nThe Service: Exceptional. We were seated right away, our waiter arrived right away, our water was perpetually full, and our special requests were all fulfilled. I've had good service at most all Chinese restaurants, but Hunan House shines in this area. \\n\\nOverall: a nice environment, very good (non-gourmet, in my mind) food, and spectacular service equal a very good dining experience. I will definitely return. \\n\\nX-Factor: this could've been a five-star review had the prices been a tad lower and had it not advertised itself as \\"gourmet.\\" Perhaps I'm off here -- I'm no foodie -- but it seemed like standard-fare Chinese to me. With that said, the food was still very good."},{"name":"Hanabi","address":"2525 W Anderson Ln, Ste 120","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"Okay!

The waitress was sweet about answering questions, making recommendations, and keeping my water glass filled.\\n\\nThe portions here are large, and I definitely over-ordered.

Save room for what's to come.\\n\\n- Ahi tuna appetizer ($17)- This dish is layered with flavors and the size of a brick. A generous portion of tuna was seared perfectly on one side only (yes!), sliced, and layered over a stack of thin sliced potatoes that had a nice crisp on the outside. The tuna is topped with a mix of sweet and spicy peppers that give a nice bit of heat. On top of that is a chopped olive tapenade and some slivered basil. Yum! This was more of an entree size, or an appetizer for sharing. \\n- After seeing the mountain-sized servings of pasta being delivered to tables, I opted for another appetizer as my entree. The spicy shrimp dish ($15) was more than enough food. Four large shrimp were perfectly cooked and served over thin pasta in a spicy tomato sauce. The pasta was a bit overcooked for my taste- though this is tough to avoid with skinny noodles. The pasta had a good amount of heat and the capers added a yummy brininess that I love. I don't understand why restaurants leave the tail shells on. It seems a waste to not eat the entire shrimp, but that end shell is always messy or difficult to remove.\\n- Arugula salad ($10)- Was a good size portion of fresh baby arugula. I love that they kept it simple with just some lemon juice, olive oil, parmigiano and a few kalamatas.\\n\\nWay too much food for one person, but too tasty to leave any behind.

For food, we got the truffled deviled eggs, brussel sprouts, and 3 specials: Deep-Fried Avocados, Crudo, and Hanger Steak.  The specials were outstanding and I hope they become regulars on the menu.  Avocados were lightly battered and deep fried, and covered in lovely goodness; Crudo was simple and clean; Hanger Steak had a very unique chimichurri sauce, awesome mashed potatoes, and peppers.

The waitress saw it and proceeded to scold him about it.\\n\\nHere's where I get annoyed. You've seen his ID. You see it has his DOB clearly showing he's of age. He's performing next door at Royale where he'll have a rider full of alcohol. Do you really need to take this time to have an attitude towards someone who is simply trying to relax after his long flight? For a city like Boston, the attitude and service at Abby Lane towards someone from overseas was a little sad.\\n\\nLong story short, the food came and it wasn't great. Like... the Yelp description is perfect. It was \\"meh!\\" I had kobe sliders that were overcooked. I seriously doubt the meat was kobe, but whatever. I also had clam chowder. Again, c'mon Boston, this is your time to shine. But nope... the chowder tasted extremely starchy, like they cooked the potatoes in it far too long and most had disintegrated into the broth. I've had better clam chowder come out of a Chunky Soup can. The night ended with the irritated server bringing us our check before we were even half finished our food and beverages. No thank you, no have a good night... nothing. Just here's your check, please GTFO.  So that was that.  We left, had a great night at Royale and will probably never go back to Abby whenever our tour stops bring us through Boston. There are just too many other options to deal with that mess."},{"name":"Pistilli's Bistro & Pizzeria","address":"304 South Washington Ave","city":"Titusville","stars":"4","text":"Fresh food, great sandwiches, that come with a fruit bowl, Italian desserts and a very friendly Italian reception. \\nThe restaurant is simple and Michael gives the family feeling to newcomers"},{"name":"Jade Sushi & New Asian","address":"2425 Edgewater Dr","city":"Orlando","stars":"4.5","text":"The sushi is very yummy!

The few people that work there, that we had interaction with were very pleasant and friendly, including the waitress. I had the parmesan haddock special and my bf had what they refer to as seafood special, which is linguine w/mussels and shrimp in a red sauce. It came w/salad and bread. My piece of haddock was plenty big, maybe just a little too much red sauce, but it was good. Not being a pasta fan, I chose mash potatoes. It appeared to be garlic mashed, but was slightly dry, could of used a little bit more butter and milk/cream, as my side, and it also came w/salad.

The portions are large; the food comes out steaming hot, but the quality fluctuates depending on who is in the kitchen (when we go we always ask who's cooking and order appropriately).\\nThe service is outstanding. We go often with a friend who is gluten-free and the waitreses are so patient, explaining all of his options, and they even go back to ask the chef if he can do something special that may not be on the menu. Getting that kind of attention is well worth the trip. Great service always makes a meal better.\\nThe food is solid. Not outstanding, but good. Where can you get a veal dish, with pasta and a salad for under $20? My only objection is that the menu hasn't changed in years. Offering some different choices would make the experience more appealing.\\nAll in all, it's not a place I'd go for a celebration or a romantic night out, but, for a regular place that you can afford to visit a couple of times a week, it can't be beat."},{"name":"Shula's 347 Grill - Lake Mary","address":"2974 International Pkwy","city":"Lake Mary","stars":"3.5","text":"Took my partner here for his birthday last day.

I like that.  But the food is just way too expensive for what it is worth.  The seaweed salad with tofu comes in such a small portion for $7.  Literally one tofu size of an ipod shuffle, the seaweed portion about cup full.  The fish taste really good especially the spicy raw tuna slices, but the portion is very very small and overly priced with $10.  If this place wasn't so expensive or at least if the portion is bigger than I would recommend it.  Though they are one of the few sake bars in Portland, that's the good part.

The food, not so much.  This could have been largely because of coordinating all twenty or so plates, but at these prices that should probably not become an issue.   \\n\\nFor dinner I ordered a wedge salad, oysters rockefeller, a gorgonzola filet with twice baked potato, and a side of asparagus.  I'm very picky about meat as I don't eat it often and only tend to go to steakhouses when it's someone else's choice as a special occasion.  When I do go, I only order a filet because it's simply the best, soft and amazing.  But this one was over cooked (I ordered medium) and tough.  Not worth the ~$60 price.  I checked with a few people around me to see how they were enjoying the meal, and none were particularly impressed. The last time I had a filet was in July at the Keg in a group of 5, and it was much better than this one.  I'd like to blame the party size.  The oysters were not as good as they could've been, and the wedge salad was the most basic.  Just a chunk of lettuce with dressing, and a side cup of bacon crumbles.  No tomato, nothing extra. The highlight of the meal was absolutely the cheese bread. To die for.  At the least I'd go back to have a basket of this and a glass of wine.  \\n\\nThe wine service was great, they were on top of topping off my glass.  Not sure who picked out the wines, but the reds were great.  Towards the end of the meal we were served a few bottles of Caymus, I think it was around $200/bottle, and it was amazing.   \\n\\nFinding this place was somewhat of an adventure in itself, it is so small from the street and tucked away, I never noticed it before.  It has a medieval look to it. Inside is a great environment, classy coat check, but the party room is somewhat small and we were all eating shoulder to shoulder.  One of our party ended up sitting at the bar after they made a setting for him by himself in the corner at one of the service tables.  Maybe that's because extra people showed up that weren't planned for.

The scotch egg and FnC won.\\n\\nThe scotch egg was REALLY good. I have had my fair share of scotch eggs and the sausage was really moist and hot (temperature...you know us Brits don't use anything spicy). The entrees came out really fast and it was one big strip of deliciously fried fish that spanned the entire plate. I doused both the fish and chips in malt vinegar and got noshing. LOVED the batter the fish was fried in as it was crispy but it had a good, buttery flavor too. Washed it all down with a tall Guinness.\\n\\nI asked my GF how her first experience with real UK food was and she loved it.

My friend's boyfriend just HAD to have Chinese food while we were vacationing in Boston, so I found New Jumbo Seafood Restaurant on Yelp. We came for dinner on a Saturday night around 8:00pm and there was a 10-15 minute wait since they had a couple of large tables finishing up. The restaurant is not very big, and there isn't much room to stand and wait for your table. Luckily, we were sat in the back of the restaurant, so had minimal neighbors and little more room to stretch out. We ordered:\\n\\n-String Beans w/Garlic ($9.95, http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/new-jumbo-seafood-restaurant-boston?select=FMFW01sCDBD2dqT8O746WA#FMFW01sCDBD2dqT8O746WA): Yum! The string beans were cooked perfectly so that they were still crispy without being raw or overcooked. Highly recommended.\\n-Spicy Salt Calamari ($11.95, http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/new-jumbo-seafood-restaurant-boston?select=FMFW01sCDBD2dqT8O746WA#9v2Z0e0rWNIBIGa4sgrg1g): My friend wanted to order this and I was skeptical, but it was actually delicious! They only put a thin coating of batter, and it came out nice and crispy, while the calamari inside was still tender. Highly recommended! \\n-Walnut Shrimp ($17.95, http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/new-jumbo-seafood-restaurant-boston?select=FMFW01sCDBD2dqT8O746WA#G4adtLG4yRm6eoDK14qhkA): Not bad. This wasn't the best or the worst walnut shrimp I had, but was a good version. Recommended if you really like walnut shrimp.\\n-Deep Fried Milk w/Peking Pork Chop ($16.95, http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/new-jumbo-seafood-restaurant-boston?select=FMFW01sCDBD2dqT8O746WA#pbwudXVExVi9rQaoKKzPxg): I love fried milk!! This is one of the few restaurants I've seen with it still on the menu, and it was delicious. I don't know what they do with the \\"milk\\", maybe mix it with gelatin, but they deep fry it, and it has the savory sweet taste. The Peking pork chops were just ok. The sauce was really good, but the pork was overcooked and on the dry side. I would recommended just getting an order of the fried milk.\\n-Dual Lobster ($29.95?, http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/new-jumbo-seafood-restaurant-boston?select=FMFW01sCDBD2dqT8O746WA#AOWzQVBCSEgLmdw59m3SLw): This was a huge plate of lobster!! I can't remember exactly how much it cost, but it was somewhere around $30. They give you two lobsters in the garlic ginger sauce I believe. The sauce was good, but the lobster a tiny bit overcooked. This was a good deal though.\\n\\nFor four people, this was WAY too much food and we had a ton of leftovers even though we ate until we were stuffed. Service isn't the most attentive (to be expected at a Chinese restaurant), but the food comes out quickly, and they speak pretty good English. Parking around this restaurant is ridiculously difficult to find, so be prepared to circle for a bit or have to walk a few blocks.

Bonnie makes it table side.  I once asked him how many times he has made this salad; he answered \\"over 10,000 times\\".  It is a freshly cracked egg, fresh lemon, fresh crushed garlic, fresh anchovy, olive oil, hand whipped with a fork, seasoned with salt, pepper, cheese and a dash of tobasco.  I get faint just writing about it.\\n\\nI order the filet charred outside and bloody inside.  They do it perfectly everytime because the grill chef is a craftsman with an astonishingly hot and consistent grill.\\n\\nThe shoestring potatoes are perfect, like McDonalds which is gastronomie as far as I am concerned.  Vegetable side dishes, creamed spinach, grilled mushrooms, onion rings are ample and satisfying.\\n\\nThe place has the atmosphere of the fancy restaurants I remember as a child in the 70's, all class and discretion.  This is not a vulgar, obscene steakhouse to be seen at; this is a retreat for old money.  Dark paneling, private booths, this is where you close your big deal one night, return the second night with your buddies to celebrate with stiff boozy cocktails, then return the third night to romance your woman.

I ordered the miso glazed salmon with ginger rice and broccoli. The salmon was cooked perfectly, and the miso glaze gave it a nice flavor, but it wasn't overpowering.  The ginger in the rice was a bit much, but still worked nicely with the salmon. The broccoli was lightly buttered and while unremarkable, was still worth eating. The only downside to the experience was that it was a bit loud for the type to atmosphere they are presenting.

You have been warned. \\n\\nTo anyone interested in the details of my experience:\\nWe ordered the choco-nut waffle and banana split.\\nThe choco-nut was okay, nothing special. The banana split was literally soup. The server did not check up on us at all, so we just put the banana split aside. When we were paying we told the server the issue, to which he responded \\"oh sorry, I'll let them know. They must have put the banana in too soon while it was still hot\\", then went ahead and charged us for both items, even though the banana split was full to the rim and barely touched.\\nI had my toddler with me, and I wasn't hung up on the $15, so we decided to just ignore it. \\nBut as were about to leave, a woman called Stella decides to walk up to us when we're stood up at the door and heading out, and says that the banana split was \\"fine when we gave it to you\\". I told her it was not, and it was like soup from when it was served, but she continued to say that it was fine when they served it. Basically telling me I'm lying. Then when I tell her I'm not arguing with her and that we'd simply just not visit there again, (at this point my husband and toddler are outside the door and I have my foot out the door trying to leave), she continues to argue with me and literaly says: \\"you just don't want to pay\\". \\n!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! \\n1.

Having a person like Stella running your staff who will openly argue with a customer in front of other customers, basically tell them they're lying, and say things like \\"you just don't want to pay\\" is a good way to run your business to the ground. It's okay to serve melted ice cream, but to have some incredibly aggressive, argumentative, rude, and irrational staff member walk up to a customer and provide the kind of experience I had is a sad and pathetic way to do business. People have food blogs, are active on social media, and consistently turn to reviews to tell them whether they should visit a restaurant or not.\\nIt was my first and last time visiting your restaurant, and I'll be sure to share my experience with anyone who asks, both on my blog, social media accounts, as well as in person.

I was the first Yelp review for GTR, and I know that I use the term \\"review\\" loosely, as it was more of a sarcastic declaration of yet another bar in Powell. Yelp removed it since it was brought to their attention that it was not a review. I was being nice. So here you go....a true review of our 1st visit:  We went in spite of being disappointed that this was not going to be Gallo's Kitchen, as in Upper Arlington. We enjoy that restaurant and feel that the GK concept would have been well received in Powell; Powell can support something other that a bar, right?  We had never been to the GTR on Bethel, and even though \\"bar\\" food really isn't our thing, we decided to check it out. After waiting at the bar (that you literally bump into upon arrival) for about 15 mins. we were sat in what I call the \\"sequester\\" room. Off to the side, stark, plain & cold. I felt like we were not part of the restaurant. I wanted to check out the vibe, etc., but you don't do that in this nondescript room. The new laminate table was wobbly too adding to the (lack of) ambiance. An entree is not an option here. If you want a sandwich, appetizer or a salad for dinner, this might be your place. Are you gluten free?...hahaha.  We got the mussels with fries as an appetizer; they were ok. Had to ask twice for water; and even then it took awhile. Ordered the Santorini salad, which came AFTER our slices of pizza arrived, by 15 mins. You have a choice of dressing with this salad. Not sure why because there is no greek dressing choice. Do you get a choice of dressings for a Caesar? It is (for the most part) a greek salad which necessitates a Greek dressing. At least have that as an option. We got 3 slices of pizza, 2 plain cheese and the house special for the night. The only thing good was that the crust was not floppy. It would have been nice to have had the cheese and toppings cooked. It was pale and bleh. The best part of the meal? The obviously marinated, perfectly cooked chicken breast on top of the salad. But that being said, we won't be back. If we want pizza in town, we know where to go.

His enthusiasm was so contagious that our table ended up ordering a bazillion small plates to share, many of which we picked solely because he seemed so gosh darn excited about them. The highlights were the crispy green beans, which were perfectly tempura-fried gems (a little heavy, but delicious), the beets with pomegranate and farro (a nice, light counterpoint to the beans), the chicken meatballs, which were served in a refreshing green sauce, and the burger (a just-right portion of deliciously tender beef on home-baked challah). The white bean dip and pigs in a blanket were tasty, but not as memorable. The grilled cheese was disappointing with way too much bread for the cheese and tomato inside. We also sampled both desserts with an even split across the eight of us - half preferred the chocolate cookie with peppermint ice cream while the rest of us preferred the bread pudding with apple and cranberry, which hit the right note on a chilly winter night. The desserts were good, not great, so I'd probably skip them on future visits.\\n\\nDrinks-wise, the El Pepino (tastes like what you wish your local spa would serve...think amped-up cucumber water) and the Rancher's Punch (a fruity rum-based cocktail that someone who likes girly drinks can order without looking like a wuss) were the faves. The Nor'Easter tasted overwhelmingly of bourbon and the Moscow Mule looked a little sad served in a regular glass rather than its traditional copper mug.\\n\\nAs you can imagine, Contigo is stuffed to the gills on a busy weekend night. Try to make reservations if you have a large party or come early to beat the rush. I'm looking forward to returning when the weather warms up so we can sit under the stars and enjoy a balmy evening of beverages, charcuterie, friendly service, and people/pup watching (yes, they're pet-friendly)."},{"name":"Pizzano's Pizza & Grinderz","address":"1740 US Hwy 27","city":"Clermont","stars":"3","text":"Great pizza.

Everything was great with the sausage and pulled pork really standing out. I can't remember the last time that I had such moist pulled pork. The sausage had that nice snap as you bite or cut into it. Both had great flavor and I didn't need, nor was I going to use any of the barbecue sauce on hand.

This isn't your typical Chinese food take out place. First off, the inside is really nice looking, not fancy but really clean and a place you would want to eat out at. The people here are really friendly too. We ordered when we showed up and while we waited he talked with us and joked a bit. It was a nice change from all the other Chinese places out there. This one sticks out in my mind. \\n\\nThe food is really yummy. I think I tasted red wine in the general tso but I cant be sure. Something was in there that you normally don't taste. It made the sauce that much better honestly. The chicken was lightly crispy even, a nice change from soggy wet pieces of chicken like I'm used to. The sauce was thick too and actually had a kick to it. I'm used to spicy foods so I normally don't think things listed as 'spicy' actually are. This was really good. Use caution if you're not used to it. And the chicken pieces are larger, making for juicy pieces that fall apart instead of hard over cooked little pieces of soggy crap. lol. Beef on a stick was tasty, more so then other's I've had. Miso soup had tofu in it, usually a hit or miss thing with me since not everyone knows how to make it taste good. There's fell apart nicely and blended in with the soup. The smell is a bit over powering when you eat it right from the plastic container though; big whiff of tofu haha!  \\n\\nThis place was a very nice change and we will be back for sure. I'm confident other things on the menu will be tasty too. We judge everything based on general tso since we love it so much. Bad tso usually means we don't go back. I tend to be loyal to the places I go to but since we moved here I haven't found any Chinese food that even came close to the one we went to back home, let alone tasted better!

I don't mind paying for decent thai food but if they charge this much, I kind of expected a little more.  They skimmed on the meat and filled it with alot of veggies.  The flavors of each entree I ordered  were tasty and good.  For a take out joint, the prices are a bit high.  In my opinion, I don't think the owner was prepared to accomodate so many Groupon coupons and this is probably why they were cheap on the portions.  I did use the coupon and when I showed up the young lady was courteous and chatty.  From what I got out of the conversation that she's relieved the coupons are expiring soon. :-P  I ordered the dinner portions so this how I rate it.\\n\\n3 stars Fresh Spring Roll 5.95 because nothing special about it and it's like every non-fried spring roll.  The menu description is very misleading, it said six pieces which really meant 3 whole spring roll cut into half making it 6. \\n\\n4 star Chicken Pad Thai 8.95 because I thought it was very flavorful and cooked perfectly. Good combination of sweet and salty but I wish they put a tad bit more of chicken. To get more bang for the buck, I recommend ordering the Chicken Pad Thai because it was a whole box of goodness.  \\n\\n3 stares Chicken Mango Curry 14.95 -  the curry flavor was spicy and was quite good but there was a few pieces of chicken and too much vegetables \\n\\n3 Stars Lemongrass Shrimp 15.95 - Excellent flavor and I could really taste the lemongrass but this joint was very stingy on the shrimp and too much veggies.  I paid $14.95 and there were about 6 shrimps in there.  I don't think it's worth the value.\\n\\nOverall, I'd like the place but I wish there was more meat in the entree.  The prices are bit high for a take out joint but renting retail space in Downtown is high so I guess that's why it costs more. Also, some of the fancier thai restuarant entrees charge 18.95 so this place is still cheaper compared to the ones around town.  If I were to reorder one thing on then menu, it would be the Chicken Pad Thai...Would I recommend this place?

You have to know you want to go here, there's no wandering by and checking things out; the place is a destination.  I was skeptical walking through the loading dock, but came upon the invitingly patio, turned the handle on the steel door, walked through an obstructive curtain to enter a trendy, bustling lowlit space.  The effect was like walking through the looking glass.  \\n\\nI made up my own tasting menu of small plates, since they seemed more interesting than the entrees, although next time, if they ever have it, I might try the parsnip agnolotti.  The restaurant's \\"hook\\" is the current locavore food trend, which they've been pioneering in Atlanta for 13 years now, and apparently, they are still pretty good at it.  Food is unfussy, well-executed, flavorful reimaginations of Southern comfort.  Chicken livers were grilled on rosemary skewers infusing the tender nuggets with a heady, woody, evergreen perfume and piled high on smokey grilled sourdough crostini slathered with what I think was a custard-like bone marrow.  The tart red onion jam really cut through the creamy richness accenting the slight iron bitterness of the livers.  A side of wood oven-roasted Jerusalem artichokes were simply and brilliantly prepared; a light glaze sweetly carmelized on the roasted hearts showed off their earthy (dirt-like, in a good way) flavor.  The crispy Georgia white shrimp with green tomatoes, cipollini onions and jalapenos (all battered and deep fried) were a substantial portion, but the more pedestrian of the plates; the bowl of fried things were brightened by an astringent jalapeno infused vinegar.  \\n\\nDessert was the stage of the meal where I felt like I was indeed going to \\"floataway\\".  The Gateau Victoire is the most ethereal version of the now ubiquitous and often underwhelming flourless chocolate cake.  The Floataway's version sublimates on the tongue, leaving just the bittersweet essence of chocolate behind.  If you want a more simple ending to your meal, try the affogato (\\"drowned\\" in Italian) which is elegantly a scoop of vanilla gelato served with a shot of hot espresso, which you pour over.  The Floataway dresses theirs up with a little candied orange zest and grated cocoa nibs; the bitterness of the peel and raw cocoa both punch up the bitterness of the espresso, which is then cooled and sweetend by the gelato -- magical."},{"name":"Yaghi's New York Pizzeria","address":"12400 W Hwy 71","city":"Austin","stars":"3","text":"I would not recommend this place due to the inconsistency of service and poor customer service.

Beyond that, this donut was fairly dry and flavorless, except for the mint glaze. I haven't found the ideal gluten-free donut yet, but I'd say Kane's is the best texture I've tried so far.

Based on frozen vegetarian black bean burgers I'd had, I expected something with a bit more form--some breading or crispiness to it--but this burger seemed like just mashed black beans in a patty shape (it was falling apart as I picked it up) with a slight kick. The lukewarmness of the bean-patty and the slight spice was truly not appetizing, and I don't consider myself a picky eater. I managed to eat about half before I had to give up. Maybe this is what an authentic black bean burger is (on the plus side, I'm sure this is far healthier than the frozen kind) and I'm just not a fan, but I definitely will not be ordering again. The chips were at least very thick and crispy. \\n\\nClub Sandwich\\nSmoked tofu and tempeh--I found the tempeh the most appetizing of the proteins.

Soooo yummy- and probably the best I've had in town ever.\\n\\nThat being said, let's get started.\\n\\nSo I had never even heard of Amaya's until my dining companion mentioned it last night.  We were really wanting some Mexican, but not at our usual go-to places.  Since he used to work in Capital Plaza, he was fairly familiar with Amaya's - especially with breakfast.  However, he mentioned you have to try the Guisada.  So we decided to head that direction.\\n\\nAt first glance, you might pass it over.  It is in the strip mall and so you might not notice it.  There is plenty of parking, though, which is a plus.\\n\\nThe place was about 60% full when we came in- so there was a decent amount of people there.  That's a good sign.  We were promptly seated and had our drink orders taken while being brought some chips and salsa.  Mmmmm...salsa.\\n\\nWe both ordered the Guisada and then a large order of the queso with taco meat.  The queso came out promptly.  I think the large order was a bit large for two people to share- so next time we'll probably go for the small if we get queso (that friggen salsa is fan-freaking-tastic even by itself!).\\n\\nSo we get our plates and we are in total Carne Guisada heaven.  It was definitely what we came for.  The corn tortillas were super fresh and the guisada had a nice flavor to it.  It so tender you could cut it with a fork.  The gravy itself was pretty good- but super intensified with just a spoonful of salsa.\\n\\nThe employees we met were very friendly.  When we said we liked, no... LOVED the salsa, she suggested that she could get me a container of it if I'd like.  WOULD I?!  So now I have about an 8oz styrofoam cup full of the most delicious souvineer ever.\\n\\nWe will certainly be back.  At the front, there is a warning that their food is habit forming.

There's open space with booths and counters, a bar all the way to the right, and ping pong available for your leisure. You get shop towels instead of paper napkins and you are expected to sort out your trash (used towels, trays, utensils, garbage). \\n\\nMy five star rating for TILT has to do with their burgers. I've tried their groundhog burger and koolakofsky burger! Both burgers come with soft buns and juicy patties. The groundhog burger is topped with grilled onions and mushrooms. The sauteed mushrooms only add to the juiciness of the burger. It was very hearty and was the perfect burger for me. \\n\\nThe koolakofsky (it's a mouthful to say!) burger comes with pastrami and sauerkraut. The sauerkraut has a good pickled taste and a great crunchy texture. The pastrami was tender and so very juicy. This burger leaves me feeling very full and satisfied! I recommend asking for a side of house sauce to dip your burgers in. Their house sauce is similar to thousand island dressing with a little spicy kick. \\n\\nAlso, their handcraft jalapeno tots are no regular tots! They are actual fried balls of potato, cheese and jalapenos. They come 6 pieces to an order but can be quite filling. They are pretty addicting and delicious. I can't find these anywhere else.

I recently went again for a birthday brunch.  I enjoyed my breakfast very much - eggs with peameal ham.  The peameal ham which they make at their butcher shop Big Lou's, is delicious.  I can't wait to try the Peameal bacon sandwich I'm told they make at Big Lou's.  But I digress.  A companion at our table ordered waffle with cheddar cheese, bacon, and hashbrowns.  The huge waffle had a small amount of cheddar cheese melted onto it.  Otherwise it was utterly dry and tasteless and basically not worth the calories.   The server never came to ask how our meals were - when she finally came to clear the table she said we should have told her when she came by to do a quality check, which she never did.  This same server is the one that argued with me on my order previously.  Others have told me about the inflexibility of the restaurant, i.e. can't move any tables or chairs around.\\n\\nBasically, what I get from this place is a bit of a bad attitude.  Not the best way to win customers.  \\n\\nSo,  #1. Please improve your service.  Maybe have a chat with the server, she's doing you no favours whatsoever.\\n\\n #2.

I mean, it's America, who hasn't?!?  \\n\\nWith the exception of it not being chicago style (which is quite possibly one of the most sublime foods on the planet), the pizza at andreas is unbeatable.  Nothing local even comes close.  \\n\\nNot having grown up in NE, I hadn't had much experience w/ Greek owned pizza places (even in Chicago).  They get a really bad wrap around here from what I've heard from locals. Pizza may be of italian Provenance, but once again, I'm sorry to say, it seems the Romans must yield the place of honor to their souther, sea-faring neighbors.  \\n\\nLet me summarize w/ two words what makes this pizza so exceptional (and what those who don't like it will likely point to as it's greatest flaws): cheese, olive oil (ok, technically, that's three words, but you get the idea).  The amount of cheese on Andrea's pies is in all the best possible ways, absurd.  On top of that, its quality cheese too, not the hydrogenated dairy substitute that confounds far inferior alternatives (read, Dominoes). \\n\\nBut I think what does it the most for me is the olive oil that's glazed onto the dough before baking.  Putting olive oil ONTOP of dough?!?  It's shear genius.  Not only does this give it a subtle yet deep mediteranean essence, it actually kind of fries the first several thousand nanometers of the top of the dough a little.  Amazing.  It's like funnel cake and pizza got drunk at the ENKA (local insider reference) fair and conceived a child atop the ferris wheel.         \\n\\nThe folks there are super courteous.  Despite how busy they get, they've never so much as looked annoyed with me or any customer that I've ever noticed.  Of course, if you can't decide on the meat lovers or supreme, split the baby and have your pie half and half.  No problem for these guys.  \\n\\nOn top of the pizza, the apps and other items on the menu are all quality goods.  The wing dings are perfectly done: dark, crispy coating.  Jalapeno poppers? check.  also good.  For the nutritionally minded (kind of), the greek salad is large, reasonably priced and very good.  \\n\\nThe price is always right here.  For under 20 bucks you get a large one topping and you can easily add a small side.  Get the pizza alone for around $15.

The happy hour features some pretty sweet deals and actually makes this place affordable for once.\\n\\nI've gone to happy hour here four times in July 2015. I have always had the same waitress. That is important. This will eventually deteriorate into a review of that waitress and how horrible her service is.\\n\\nAnyhow, there I am sitting, at the Smokehouse. I went alone the first time and with several people another couple of times. I've sat both inside and outside. The restaurant was next to empty every single time I've been there.\\n\\nHere's the kicker. The food is fucking phenomenal. I've lived in the South and have had some legit BBQ. This place delivers. Every thing on happy hour (other than the wings, don't order those, they're tiny and taste bad) was phenomenal. This place delivers on the food every single time. \\n\\nThe damn waitress ruins it all though. I've had plenty of bad service, but never have I had such continuously bad  service by the same damn person.

During happy hour. When the restaurant is almost completely empty. \\n-Constantly has an attitude, and not that sassy but acceptable waitress attitude, just a spoiled brat kind of attitude. She really makes you feel like she's doing you a favor by serving you.\\n-Never asked if I needed a water or drink refill. Not once. Had to tell her. \\n-Added extra items to the ticket two times. Had to have her take them off. Claimed ignorance. \\n-Not a pleasant human being, resulting in an unpleasant experience\\n\\nHere's the real kicker though. She just loiters around. It's not like she's ever too busy to take care of people. She just hangs out.

Then, I buy a bag of tortillia chips (ever-so-lighly seasoned with lime) and crush them up to put in the bowl.   I know, it kind of ruins the point of not getting a tortilla, but it's so good!

My dad and stepmom (a wine lover) were in town for a visit.

The Wine Bistro was a great place for that, as it was empty.\\n\\nNice ambiance here.  We sat on the patio, which is a lovely space, and the inside is charming as well.  Our lunch was excellent.  I had shrimp risotto, which was delicious, and others at my table had salads (which looked excellent--big hunks of blue cheese make me happy) and a crabcake sandwich.  Good reviews from everyone.  We split the truffle mushroom appetizer and it was great.\\n\\nThe wine was fine.  I don't have much to say about it, as I'm a beer drinker and know little of wine, but it passed my wine snob mother in law's test, so it was probably pretty solid.\\n\\nMy only complaints are about the service of the wine.  My wife and I both had flights, so six wine glasses total.  Of those six, three of them noticeably had cork floating in them and one had A SHARD OF GLASS.  The cork is kind of bad, as I don't expect that from a place that specializes in serving wine, and the glass is really bad.  My wife could have been hurt if she hadn't noticed it.  It seems fairly careless to serve wine with things floating in it, especially with white wine, where you can see the things pretty clearly.

I've ordered delivery several times from Foodler from Rustica; almost always Rustica calls to confirm, usually to ask about options not listed on Foodler. This was no different - they called to ask if I wanted any of the usual sub add-ons on the sandwich. \\nWhen the sandwich was delivered, it was just an un-grilled roll-up with a few rectangular slices of white cheese and ham. I called Rustica and the woman said that they only grill the default sub choice. Are you kidding me? It's called \\"grilled ham & cheese\\". She said I should have known they don't cook any optional menu choices unless specifically requested, and that Foodler should say this, then said sorry and hung up. Rustica is responsible for making sure their menu is accurate on Foodler. If a grilled ham and cheese wrap can't be grilled, it shouldn't be called grilled on the menu, or wrap shouldn't be an option.

Two of those tables were big(one was a communal table), and filled with people so it was very loud in the room. The third table was in the very corner, so when the server/bus boy needed to get to it, they had to wedge themselves between where I was sitting and behind the chair of a person who was at one of the other tables, it wasn't TOO annoying but it was distracting. Then, once we were finished with the basket of bread that comes with a trio of sauces(which was good) after you get your appetizers, it took about 45 minutes or more for our entrees to come out. I understand that the kitchen can get backed up when you have these big tables filled with people, but sitting in this very noisy room in a uncomfortable seating situation wasn't very enjoyable.\\n\\nI haven't said anything about the food yet. We got the ceviche and the cactus salad to start. Both were very tasty. I got the mole special, which was a lighter-version compared to the traditional mole they have. It was good, but the seasoning could have been punched up a little, or maybe it just needed some salt, but I wasn't about to ask for some because I didn't want to wait 10 minutes to get it. The other person I was with got the cod, which they enjoyed, although they also said it was a touch-under seasoned. Before we finished our entrees, we made the wise decision to order dessert, so it wouldn't take so long to get it, plus, a family with children had just come in, so the room was starting to get even louder. We got the tres leches cake, which came in a jar, pretty good, not overly-sweet which I like.\\n\\nMy final thoughts about this place, the food is good, although expensive, but the dining rooms indoors are just too loud, and if you get stuck with a tiny table wedged in a bad place then your dining experience probably isn't going to be amazing. It was worth checking out though, but I'm not sure if I would come back again."},{"name":"Al Wadi","address":"1249 Vfw Pkwy","city":"West Roxbury","stars":"4","text":"I actually think this is the best Middle Eastern food in Boston.

Only drawback was that our booth/table had chairs very low to the ground and had to reach up to eat.  Not very practical.  \\n\\nFood was spot on. Our friend had 1/2 dozen oysters that we plump, briny and sweet.  My wife's  deviled eggs were extremely good. I am not a fan of deviled eggs but these were worth ordering.  My \\"crispy\\" tuna roll was uneven.  Not very crispy at all and a bit slovenly put together but the flavors were excellent.  My wife's scallops were pronounced scrumptious, so much so that she didn't share.,  My double pork chop was perfectly cooked and very flavorful.  Hard to get a double chop cooked to the right, juicy, point of doneness but they did it.  The Brussel sprouts that came with it were the best I've had, roasted and soft with sweet bacon mixed in. Great with the chop.   Desserts (flourless chocolate cake and salty caramel cheesecake were excellent and enough to take home.  My only real quibble would be with the dearth of lesser-priced wines by the glass.  Sometimes you don't want to pay over $12 a glass and they limit what is available under that.

We only got enough for the day, so everything was pretty fresh. I'm used to getting donuts and then having them for a couple day afterwards. Mind you, I'm not exactly a donut person. I just crave them during this time of the year. Where should i start??\\n\\nFirst, the lady's working the counter were less then polite. The second time we were here this older lady, who apparently was working the drive through, kept speaking at us except never took our order. She never said hi, never said 'hold on a min,' she didnt even look up at us. She would ask what we wanted, I would respond, she would glare without looking up and then go about her business. 10 mins later another woman came out from the back to help us. There was now a line behind us and out the door. We ordered a dozen mixed donuts and were on our way. We got about one of everything to try them all out since we liked them the first time around. Besides our less then pleasing time inside the store we noticed almost right away that the donuts seemed older then last time; mind you the last time we were in here it was very late at night. Donut places usually make them fresh every day right? Not this place. Besides that our order was wrong. For example, I ordered 2 chocolate custard and 2 vanilla custard but in stead I got 2 lemon filled, 1 vanilla custard, and a whipped cream filled. I ordered 2 pumpkin, 2 apple spice and instead I got 1 pumpkin, 1 plain, 1 apple spice, and 1 apple thingy that was different from the other apple one. I ordered 2 boston cremes (or whatever they call them) and they were sour. The pumpkin donuts were so dense that I had to guzzle water to just get it down. The flavor of these werent pumpkin-like at all, which seems to be yet another mistake since people really do love them. \\n\\nStill, we were hopeful the following day for breakfast only to be let down since the donuts did not keep. What a waste! Meijer makes better donuts in the early morning hours. I'll stick to those.

Likewise, I like the concept of various types of food, while in practice, it plays out much differently.  I am writing this review, not out a since of utter delight, or exuberant passion, but rather out of a sense of duty and obligation as a devout food enthusiast.  I still start by saying that I have YET to encounter the be-all, end-all Mexican restaurant.   For instance, when it comes to Vietnamese food, Pho-natic gets it right, every dish, every time, and completely murders it from the perspective of customer service.   \\n\\nThere is no such Mexican Restaurant that I can find.  One Mexican restaurant will have great chips but shitty salsa.  One will have great salsa, but shitty chips.  One will have great fajitas and NOTHING else.  Some will have great food in general, but no liquor license.\\n\\nSuch is the case for La Tapatia (or at least this location).  I have already exerted more effort on this review than intended, so I will summarize the rest in bullet points.\\n\\nPros:\\n- Chips = OK\\n- Salsa = Great\\n- Refried = Good\\n- Al Pastor Tacos on Flour Tortillas = INCOMPARABLE\\n- Serving size per dish = plentiful\\n- The prices = INSANE\\n\\nCons:\\n- English is optional.  I DON'T like this.  I DON'T like the concept of cultural pockets cropping up, and not integrating.  There is a balance to be struck between preserving cultural identity, and refusing to integrate.  If you don't speak English, then I don't know how you could have passed the citizenship test, and therefore, you should likely not be here.  On the other hand, I have to concede that I am more of fan of this type of immigrant than I am of a bunch of corn syrup, MSG, GMO fed, pharmaceutically doped up, mouth breathing knuckle dragging, golden corral patronizing white bread Americans.  It's definitely an internal struggle, but after all, I did not mean for this to turn political.\\n- The remainder of the menu = mediocre\\n- The cheese = plastic and WAY too much\\n- As great as the food is, the prices, being as low as they are, would dictate that this establishment is cutting corners on quality.  To assume otherwise is to embrace mathematical impossibility.\\n\\nI concede that when I am hungover and/or low on cash, I would easily surrender 5 stars for the Al Pastor Tacos.  However, because of the mediorcrity of the remainder of the menu, and the likely low quality of the ingredients (compared to Whole Foods or the Farmer's Market), I am forced to temper my adoration of the pastor tacos with the inoffensive detractors represented by the remainder of the contextual picture.  \\n\\nI struggle with the rating, but have arrived at a 3.  If  La Tapatia decides to rename itself \\"Al Pastor Tacos & Stuff\\" I'd give it a 4.  If they did that and served margaritas, I'd give it a 5.  If they did that and spoke English, well, I wouldn't have anything to bitch about anymore, and that would likely irritate me back to a 4.\\n\\nAbsolutely try this place and make sure your first order is Al Pastor Tacos.

I have visited probably half a dozen times the past year, and this place has deteriorated. They have a new chef. They have always relied on soy everything (soy milk, tofutti, soysage) for vegetarian dishes, but a special event I recently attended was the worst visit. In my view, vegetarian cooking has evolved beyond such reliance on soy and their main audience seeks healthy alternatives. It is frustrating being faced with a gorgeous dessert display and being able to eat nothing. (I am off soy per my doctor.) There are lots of great vegan soy-free \\"comfort foods\\" that would be suitable for a diner setting. My last visit was a 5 course special event with a fixed menu, with two choices for 3 of the courses. Even the salad had soy dressing. Soy stuffed in the beets, sauces, and desserts. First, I was told the soup had soy in it (I passed); later I was told it did not, but they were out of it anyway. I sat in front of an empty place setting while my date ate and my server apologized. Partway through *his* 4th course, the server offered me a grilled cheese sandwich, but I was already mentally checked out. The chef came out and apologized, but did not offer to make me anything. For dessert, they kindly offered me FoMu coconut-based ice cream. If you have never been to the FoMu shop, go there fast!  Dessert for dinner, hey, but I was hungry.

I'm Chinese, and the fish tasted so much like my mom's home cooking. \\n\\nNot that we weren't expecting things to be excellent, but Celeste is brand new, and I think it's rare to go to any restaurant, even the well regarded/established ones, and really like EVERYTHING, but we all felt that way! Usually there's at least one thing that I could have done without, or didn't like as much, but really everything was fantastic. We loved the lomo saltado so much that after we had finished all the beef and onions and potatoes, we poured the sauce over the remainder of our side of rice just so we could savor the last drops of flavor. \\n\\nOf course, there were a few little growing pains hiccups, like our reservation was written down half an hour off (which wasn't a problem because there was a party that had no-showed (you missed out!)), and one of our mains didn't get ordered initially. But, throughout it all, everyone was so gracious and accommodating, doing whatever they could to make us feel comfortable and happy. We were treated to a side of rice on the house and a delicious custard dessert. While they're new, Celeste clearly doesn't have any issues with their food, and their attention to customer service is excellent. I'm sure they are onto something and great things!

The portions are very large in my opinion, so I always know I will have leftovers to take home for an entire second meal. \\n\\nAlso because this place is brand new, the entire inside is crisp, clean, stylish and newly renovated. Its not huge, but it's so cozy and there are some larger tables that can fit about 8, and they are very accommodating!

I admit I do like this chain and feel it has come a long way since the days when it was a windowless pub in the late '80s/early '90s. \\n\\nLast night I wasn't in the mood to cook so I thought why not go out for a meal with my favorite girl.  Around 7 o'clock we head out to the closest location to our house for an evening out.  Immediately what I notice is that this restaurant is surrounded by residential housing, a bit odd and has an enormous parking lot.  It's strange how the parking lot has more spaces than it does seating on the inside or so it seems.  \\n\\nWe walk inside, were given a pager and was told that the wait would be 10-15 minutes.  A few other people were ahead of us but then we noticed parties who arrived after us were seated.  Just as I was about to ask the hostess what was happening she comes out and say, \\"I'm sorry, it looks like the pager we gave you isn't working.\\"  And we were seated in a booth in that back close to the emergency exit.  Now, being a Friday night, a family restaurant and packed we had a few crying children around us and were seated next to a family of ten.  Personally, I feel that when you come to a family restaurant you shouldn't let three of your children run around the dining area where they could collide with waitstaff.  Have control of your kids!\\n\\nOur waitress was Kristina a nice, polite young girl who took our orders and was quick about everything.  I had a coupon for a free appetizer when ordering two of the new 9 entrees for $9.99.  My girlfriend decided to have Sirloin Tips with Chicken Tenders and I had the Country Fried Chicken.  As we waited for our food rounds of drinks came by with a bowl of popcorn which was more bland and slightly stale sadly.  Our free appetizer was potato skins which were good but could have used a lot more bacon.  Only two of the pieces were garnished with generous amounts of swine.  Fifteen minutes later our entrees come in on large plates.  HOLY LORD talk about large portions!  I can see why the 99 keeps saying, \\"Great Meal, Great Deal.\\"  \\n\\nNow the food here, like any restaurant chain, isn't going to be life changing.  I think what most people forget is that its food above fast food quality that just takes a bit longer to come out to the tables.  Personally, I enjoy the food here and am a big fan of the French Onion Soup.  Last nights meal was good, filling and worth the price in my opinion.  The sirloin tips were well seasoned, juicy and hot.  The chicken both tenders and country fried were hot, crispy and mouth watering.  French fries were hot, salty and came in a good amount while the garlic mashed potatoes sat in a steamy mount mixed with the red skins.  \\n\\nWe only made it about half way through our meals before we called it quits.  Our stomachs were full of potatoes, popcorn, sodas, chicken and beef.  So we asked our waitress Kristina to please wrap everything so we can take it home for the next day.  Thankfully, unlike other restaurant chains the Ninety-Nine still boxes everyone's food for them.  You're not brought a container to box the food yourself.  (Now I'd like to know whose idea that was anyway!)  \\n\\nA few hours ago we reheated last night's meal for lunch today and I thought it was just as tasty.  Of course the chicken was not as crispy but still contained a large amount of the flavor.  I would say it's worth the trip and price."},{"name":"Franco's","address":"1740 Cheshire Bridge Rd NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Authentic fresh and tasty food served by friendly staff with great wine values.\\n\\nThe place is what it is, a nice family owned authentic eatery in an in-town location.

I ordered the oxtail and curry goat combo with rice and peas for $13.00 and my husband had stew fish and shrimp with rice and peas for $13.00. It took them a ridiculous 30 minutes for us to get our food, I couldn't believe it!!! When our food did finally arrive I was expecting to have a decent size plate of food (for $13.00) I had literally 3 oxtails and the goat was all FAT!!!!!!  They didn't trim the fat off the goat meat how nasty is that?? Oh, I forgot to tell you that they brought out the rice in what must be a baby size bowl that I had to add to my plate.  When I told the server about the all fat goat, it took another 15 minutes to get more goat, needless to say  I was finished eating my 3 oxtails by then. I decided I would just take the goat home, but once again it was less goat and more FAT, so I just left it on the table. What a shame!!! Taste wise the food was just okay, my plate was not worth it at all. My husband said his dish was okay as well, but not worth the money.\\n\\nOkay, as if that was not enough, when it came time for the check, I noticed that gratuity was already added (NOT 10%, NOT 15%, BUT A WHOPPING 18%, REALLY??????? I asked the server why gratuity was added, because it was just my husband and myself , no large party, why would you add gratuity?

There's something about breakfast that makes you want to have it at other times of the day.  Have you ever wanted to eat lunch or dinner for breakfast? Probably not as often as wanting breakfast for lunch or dinner right?  That's why there are all day breakfast joints or wish McD's served it all day long. \\n\\nRed Wagon is another place to get your breakfast fix from 9am to 9pm.

From looking at it, it's very geared towards the oink, the swine, the \\"whatever you want to call a hog.\\"\\n\\nPulled pork and pancakes?!  How can I not order this?  It's akin to chicken and waffles.  It's just like my childhood creations that one day could be on a menu too if I decide to open a restaurant.

You can't say anything until you've tried it and that's all I can say. \\n\\n... and so I did ...  I love pancakes.  I love pulled pork.  Most importantly, I love weird things. These are not the fluffiest pancakes I ever ate. Nor the best pulled pull to grace these lips. But the epic that is this combo is what sells it. It's strange and different enough so you have a story to tell. Oh, and the JD infused maple syrup was good. But it wasn't necessary to sell me on it.  As you wait for seating to this triple-D famed diner, you most definitely were Yelp'ing on your smart phone and reading reviews such as this one.  You see all the photo-taking hoes post pictures of this pancake chimera. You have to try it even if your non-adventurous friends tell you not to.  Your life just wouldn't be complete!\\n\\nI wished my appetite was bigger so I can try another item that was not so foreign, like the pork belly sandwich.

I tried the egg and cheese sandwich and the \\"regular\\" (not stuffed) french toast. Don't let the name fool you, that egg and cheese isn't some wimpy little English muffin deal you'd get elsewhere - it's a big SANDWICH (grilled cheese size) filled with eggs, cheese, garlic mayo and arugula. The garlic mayo and arugula definitely give it a lot more flavor than your average mceggwich. Adding tempeh bacon to it only sweetens the deal (warning for carnivores: tempeh bacon is nothing like real bacon,.. it does have its own great flavor though).  \\n\\nThe egg and cheese was finished off with homefries, probably the best  I've had yet in Boston. I'm no homefries expert and I could see a fan of old timey \\"giant chunks of potato sitting on a cooktop for eons\\" style homefries not being down, but these were super clean, cut into tiny pieces, expertly spiced, and positively moreish! \\n\\nThe french toast probably took second place of these two dishes, but still was good / worth ordering again... What really made that dish was the apple maple glaze clumped on top. Redistributing that around the french toast all but negated the need for syrup, though that was provided as well.  I can't wait to try the stuffed french toast now, sounds even better! \\n\\nSitting at the counter I got to see quite a few dishes going out, EVERYTHING looked great. It's also good to see the staff behind the counter working like mad and communicating well to get dishes out ASAP.

We had the crispy Brussels sprouts with golden raisins, the beets, the warm olives, deviled eggs with truffle oil, and the carrots (a special). Everything was outstanding. I think I prefer my olives cold--but seriously--if that's the biggest negative I can find? It was delightful to have small plates to share. We also ordered the honey thyme (?) chicken with sweet potato biscuit (another special) which was incredible. \\nWe loved Gina, our waitress.

When choosing which restaurant to try on magical dining month, I look at the main entrees. Itta Bena boasted a nice rack of lamb dish along with an intriguing take on duck and waffles.  I don't spend much time in I-drive area, but we decided to meet a couple friend here for magical dining.\\n\\nWalking in, i love the dark wood interior, awesome lighting, and live piano right in the front by the bar.  It gives it such a nice upscale, adult feel.  Far different from the Hooters which this space once occupied.  We were seated at a great table which faced the entire dining room which made for great people watching.  Our waiter seemed to take a while to get our order despite the dining room being half empty on a Thursday night.\\n\\nFood:\\nAppetizer - Pork belly.  It tasted fine but felt a little lacking.  I was expecting a nice slab of pork belly that had a taste like a refined candied bacon.  But It was small chunks of pork on tiny sticks of bread.  I know it was an appetizer, but i expected more.  The avocado with lump crab that my fiancee got was better.  I couldn't tell if the lump crab was real or if it was imitation crab that you would get at a cheaper sushi restaurant.\\n\\nMain entree -  I ordered the duck waffles.  It was delicious.  The duck was flavorful and paired well with the rice waffle.  It reminded me of flavor profiles you would get when eating a Chinese duck with bao buns.  However, I wish i had another piece of duck.  For this price point, you would think you would get more than about 2 oz of protein.  The lamb chops were a better choice. Two people in our table ordered and i managed to get a piece.  It was cooked perfectly and the size was a lot more generous, offering 4 fairly sized pops which probably amount to 6 oz of protein.  I knew I should've ordered it!\\n\\nDessert -  Bourbon pecan pie came in 4 little two bite pieces.  It was a good portion and tasted very homemade.  The white chocolate bread pudding had great flavor.  People at my table, remarked how they are not bread pudding people and they liked it.\\n\\nI also opted for the wine pairing option which was forgettable.  The waiter didn't really speak to what flavors they were trying to pull or how they marry to the dish.  And he took a while to get to our checks too.  However, the GM came to our table earlier and chatted with us while we waited for our food, and even delivered one of the courses.  Which I thought was very nice.  Maybe our waiter was having an off night.\\n\\nOverall,  a nice place.  There are many options in Point Orlando, and maybe this place is still trying to figure out where they fit in.  I don't want to give up on it yet, so I may update this review on a different experience.\\n\\nYelp 100  69/100"},{"name":"Joy Teriyaki","address":"8136 SE Foster Rd, Ste 280","city":"Portland","stars":"3","text":"I had the spicy teriyaki bowl, for $4.99, and received a generous portion of both chicken and rice.

They were even able to take same-day reservations for a party of six.\\n\\nBut the service was horrible. And again, it's not like they were cruel, or rude, it was just too damn busy. They had too many customers, and clearly not enough staff. Not enough waiters on the floor, and definitely not enough bartenders or cooks. As an example, it took an hour to get a glass of wine. After three requests. \\n\\nOur appetizers came out swiftly at the beginning of the meal. They were excellent. Again, I can't emphasize enough: the food was fantastic.

He had been to Hy's for a guys' dinner out and really enjoyed it so we made reservations.\\n\\nThe layout of Hy's Encore definitely gives it that ol' steakhouse vibe, with the leather booth chairs and separate bar area...with a magical stone tunnel that takes you to the dining room or the Land Where Steak Is Consumed.  All of the staff are very courteous and service is prompt.  We opted for the chateaubriand, which feeds two people and is prepared tableside.  For dessert we had bananas Foster, which I had never tried before.\\n\\nThe food was delicious and like other reviewers had said, the bites of beef just melt in the mouth.  The bananas foster was fun to watch being prepared, since it gives off an impressive WHOOSH of flames when the waiter lights it on fire.  Presentation was on-point, and I noted that an adjacent table was eyeing our food despite the fact they had already finished eating. \\n\\nDue to the restaurant space being not capacious (this is downtown, after all), noise levels can get high depending on the other diners.  There were probably about 3 other large birthday parties going on, with one in particular getting pretty boisterous despite being in a separate room (many rounds of shots were heard to be consumed).  So, I would say Hy's is great for a date, but maybe not so great if you're looking forward to soft, romantic conversation.\\n\\nThat being said, I'd be back for the food alone; the quality of food and service make up for the higher price point but for a special occasion it's worth every penny."},{"name":"Salty Sow","address":"1917 Manor Rd","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"Very diverse food experience.

I'm typically a huge fan of any Korean influenced menu, but I do believe this one fell a tad short. I gave it 3 stars for selection of toppings, concept, and flavor of the sauces. Everything else left something to be desired.\\n\\nFor starters, I got the purple rice base, tofu, and an assortment of vegetables such as edamame, carrots, and cucumbers. I will say, they do have a fairly large selection of toppings/sauces. I also got a side of kimchi (I'm a bit of a connoisseur), and a container of miso soup from their \\"free\\" soup well. \\n\\nThe food itself was poorly executed. While the flavor was decent, the tofu itself was cold and hard. Some pieces I would go as far to say crunchy. I ended up going through and picking out all of the tofu. Then I was left with just vegetables and rice. I also tried their spicy chicken, from my friends bowl, and was also disappointed because it was very dry and chewy. The rice also was underdone, still a little crunchy for my taste. \\n\\nThen I tried the kimchi, which was extremely disappointing. It was way over-fermented. There was no crunch, and a strong vinegar flavor comes to mind. It wasn't really spicy either, so I tossed the rest. \\n\\nOn to the miso soup, I thought. Although it was free- how can you mess up miso soup? The answer to that- not enough miso and too much water. It was just very bland with minimal tofu and spinach to scoop from the well. Not something I finished either. It is a very cool concept, giving away free soup- just wish it was more tasty. \\n\\nOverall, I ended up still hungry and not satisfied with what I ate.

We walk in around 1pm. We had a party of 6 and was told that it'll be a 15 minute wait. Fine. We all sat in the lobby area, talking and carrying on light conversation, while we anxiously awaited our much anticipated dining experience. 15 minutes go by... we are still waiting.

Many black businesses make it harder and harder for us to support them, because they appear to lack certain \\"customer service skills.\\"  Many times, they are downright rude and act as though it's a burden for them to serve you and this is very unfortunate.  This is not a relfection of Gladys Knight and Ron Winans, but they really need know what's going on and they need to find out who is running her restaurants and get some friendly, professional, QUALITY people in there, that know what they're doing and are more than willing to treat their paying customers with respect!

He came back twice to the register to ring up more, and I was just letting him finish them before me, but he never looked me in the eye, never said anything to me at all. Even when the manager came to ring me up, the waiter came to the register to have the manager finish his credit tips, and the waiter still never said a word to me or even apologized for ignoring me.

Excellent brisket, kickass pulled pork, and spicy sausages...I am surprised to say that their brisket even beats the amazing Snow's out in Lexington.  What separates LB's fare from other places is, IMO, the bark.  I'm not sure what smoky concoction this is, but the barbecue gods definitely blessed LB's with this.  A little salt, a little pepper, and a bit of smoke...it's to die for.\\n\\nOf special mention is the beef rib, which I hear is the first thing they run out of on any given day.  I can see why - buttery tender, throw-away-the-knife meat pleasure.  Pull off a hunk and give it a swim in their excellent BBQ sauce and let it melt in your mouth.\\n\\nOK, what about the wait?  Honestly, if you're visiting from out of town - or are a busy person who wants to make sure you get to try a beef rib - email them 4 days ahead and let them know a) what items you want, and b) what time you'll pick it up.  Then show up, wave to the nice people in line, and pick up your order.  You'll pay about a 15% premium for doing this, so budget accordingly.\\n\\nNow, if you're OK with waiting, what does it look like?  Here are my two experiences.\\n\\n1) Arrived at 10:45am on a Saturday in early-October. I ended up as the 20th or so person in line for when the place opened at 11am. By 11:50 I was at the window at the line was out of the food truck lot.  Pleasant waiting experience as everyone's kind of charged and the smoke smells so good; however they ran out of beef ribs by person #12.\\n\\n2) Arrived at 10:45am on a Wednesday in mid-April.  I was 4th in line, though since I ordered ahead I just went up to the window, identified myself, and was served right when they opened. \\n\\nObviously, the time you go will affect your experience.  Plan accordingly, fellow Yelpers!\\n\\nIt goes without saying that this place pegs the 'CTJ Scale' at 5 stars, as noted below.\\n\\n5 out of 5 stars: Come-to-Jesus good. Would be OK passing on after finishing a plate here.\\n4 out of 5 stars: Come-to-Mary good. Would be OK being seen eating here by Mother Mary.\\n3 out of 5 stars: Come-to-Joseph good. Would be OK having a beer here with Jesus' Dad.\\n2 out of 5 stars: Come-to-the-Apostles good. Meh. Wouldn't have my last supper here.\\n1 out of 5 stars: Come-to-Nobody good.

She has heard of this place before, but I haven't, so especially more the reason to try the food! It's labeled as a pop up restaurant, where it takes over a different restaurant's venue during the weekends. There was a little bit of a wait when we got there, but I have a rule where if there is a wait, it is a wait worth waiting for. So we waited for about 30 minutes, occupying our time with the Where's Waldo books near the front, with other options available as well. After getting seated, we were presented with a pre fixe menu, where you choose a drink, a savory entree, and a sweet entree, all for $22 with a $4 service charge that essentially covers tip. There are sides that are available for extra cost, but just be prepared to pay $26 otherwise. They have 4 different savory dishes, and 3 different sweet dishes, so a possibility of 12 different combinations. The food was great!\\n\\n- My combination: baked eggs surprise with a fortune cookie waffle and orange juice. The baked eggs on the bottom were my least favorite part, but the potatoes were really great with the sauce that they put on the top. The waffle itself was great, the only thing I was wishing for was more! The fortune cookie part is called as such because of the crushed fortune cookie on top of the waffle with the other toppings, but at least they give you your fortune!\\n- My girlfriend's combination: crispy pork ribs with amaretto funnel cake and caramel hot chocolate with toasted marshmallows. The ribs provided a decent amount of meat with the funnel cake that reminds you of the fair. Surprisingly, one of my favorite parts was the hot chocolate, which was super rich and deep with flavor.\\n\\nDefinitely one of the more unique brunch dining experiences that I have had since moving to Portland seeing that the menu is pre fixed and the dishes itself are fairly unique.

First, I love this place. I've come here in the morning for a cup of coffee and to work from the upstairs area. The atmosphere is relaxed, the people are nice, and most important, the place does not feel pretentious unlike some other coffee shops in the area. Better still, the food is incredible. I've had the biscuits and gravy which are incredible. A little sweet a little savory. I've also had the Freebird which has become my favorite sandwich in Portland. The soft bread goes well with the sweet jalapeno cole slaw. The chicken can stand on its own and it very moist and tender. The bacon ties it all together to make a very flavorful sandwich. I also love that this place has a bar. So far I haven't found anything on their menu I don't like. If you're in the Pearl stop by for a cup of joe just to try it out. If you like it, try the food.

We were very excited that the Gallo family decided to open a shop in Powell- we have enjoyed Gallos in Arlington and the tap room on bethel.  These two restaurants have set the bar pretty high for little sibling.  Service was slow- we ordered several appetizers and drinks as well as entrees to sample.  It took about 40 minutes for apps to come out.  We ordered pierogis, mussels and fries, chicken and waffles.  Pierogis were very good- caramelized onions on top and well cooked.  The chicken and waffle was great- I loved the combo of sweet maple syrup and salty heat of the hot sauce on the chicken.  It was a good balance.  I was disappointed in the mussels.  I love mussels and we were excited to try this dish.  The wine sauce was bland.  The portion size was generous but mussels were small and had a subtle fishy flavor.  Several were not open.  Plain fries rested on top- I wasn't sure what to do with them.  The wine sauce didn't have enough flavor to accompany the fries and they had no garnish (shaved parm would have been a nice addition).  We ended up just dipping in a side of ketchup.  \\nFor entrees- our party ordered oyster po boy, pizza slice, wings.   Oysters were very good- cooked well but bun (hoagie roll) needed sauce instead the oysters were very lightly brushed with the house remoulade which was delicious but I got more on the side for dipping.  The bread was plain and too thick.  Pizza and wings were okay- not memorable.  We ordered NY style buffalo wings and cheese/pep pizza.  Wings were a little soggy.  \\nWe ordered beer and a bottle of white wine- I was surprised that the white wine wasn't served in a chiller- it was just set on the table and got warm.  Given location (not in heart of downtown Powell) the food is really going to need to stand out to compete with the other Powell restaurants.  The gallos have a great reputation and I'm hoping that the kinks get worked out!

Riverside, is a recent addition to the Austin gourmet food truck scene.  Like many food trucks, it sets itself apart by creating unique signature dishes and doing them well.   At the Giggling Goat, these dishes are the cabrito and pork burgers.  Both are a distinct change from the all-American beef based burger and well worth the detour.\\n\\nThe cabrito burger was sweet, moist and topped with sunflower sprouts.  The pork burger was surprisingly delicate and paired with Granny Smith apple slices and feta compote. Both dishes were served with Japanese potato fries, which had the taste and texture of a sweet potato/ plantain hybrid. If you can't stomach burgers, they do have several other entrees, appetizers and salads on their menu. The menu is predominantly meat-centric coupled with a few vegetarian dishes, and as a whole the food is moderately priced with all entrees under $10.\\n\\nIf you are like me, a proprietor with a colorful history always adds to the dining experience. Owner Chad Nunez started his career as a dishwasher, but eventually opened and operated restaurants in the Caribbean. When he needed a new challenge, he started an organic goat farm where he raised his livestock for meat and cheese.  His interest in goats stemmed from what he humorously calls his \\"lactose intolerableness\\".\\n\\nThe Giggling Goat has embraced new technology, allowing patrons to submit an order with the ease of sending a text message.  For those less-techie, you can still call in your order or walk up to the window - but the texting option is great perk.  The service was prompt, the trailer was clean and inviting, and my only real complaint was their lack of seating. On the night I went, there was only one table and no more than six chairs. I wasn't sure if this was the proprietor's way of encouraging his patrons to take their food home, or if the trailer was so new that they had not had time to invest in more seating.\\n\\nThe combination of excellent burgers, solid service and reasonable price is enough to ensure my continued patronage and I would encourage others to try the Giggling Goat, even if it's out of their way.  The trailer is parked next to the Amli building on E. Riverside and it is open Tuesday through Friday from 12pm-10pm and Saturday 4pm-10pm.

It is nice to have something healthy to choose from in this fast food world we live in. However in terms of bibimbap the food just really didn't make the mark for me. Nothing was bad about the food, but nothing was great or stand out either. If you had traditional bibimbap you're used to having a runny egg over the top of steaming hot ingredients. Here the rice is warm and so is the meat but its not steaming hot. The ingredients that are added to it are limited and all cold items. The only eggs that they had the offer was a scrambled egg omelet style cut up into thin ribbons. The sauces are available on the side which is great if you're going for portion control, but once again the sauces are room temperature and add very little to the dish in my opinion. By the time you have created the bowl there is very little flavor and the food is lukewarm. It is unlikely that I would choose to eat here again, but if I was with a group of people and they suggested the spot I would not tell them no.

HUGE portions, including a HUGE glass for my diet coke which was kindly refilled often, but the food itself was alright.  To be fair, we only had two pasta dishes for lunch, so unsure if we missed out on ordering any specialties.

Then checked out John Mueller Meat Company b/c it was close by ... and it was also closed.  Shoot.\\n\\nSo I scooted on over to La Barbeque, which was a little further down from where we were staying ... but at the end, it was the perfect place to go.

They did run out of ribs but we had a pound of the brisket ($15.99/lb), a half pound of the pulled pork ($12.98/lb) and a house-made sausage (unappetizingly called \\"Texas Hot Guts\\" at $3.25 a link).  Gotta say, the brisket was frickin' amazing ... so tender and succulent.  The pulled pork was also good but a bit fatty (would have been better on a sandwich).  The sausage was not a hit - very dry and seemed overcooked.  You get free slices of white bread (although if you were going to fill up on carbs, go for the potato salad.  Very good).\\n\\nIt's bare bones - eating on outdoor tables and benches (covered, which was a good thing b/c of the rain) but such a fun experience.

The crispy brussels sprouts leaves were umamilicious, and the farm salad was zingy and flavorful.

We were seated immediately, which was a good sign. The atmosphere is much more soothing than many of the bustling restaurants in the area, which made conversations easy. \\n\\nOur party of five ordered four entrees and an appetizer, with the intention for everyone to share. There is a policy that every person must order at least one appetizer or entree; meaning three people could not go and split two entrees. \\n\\nWhen I asked how many raviolis were included in an appetizer, the waitress informed us that there were five. Thinking we would each get one, we were dismayed to find only four on the plate. Not wanting to set a bad tone for the rest of the meal, we didn't mention it. \\n\\nThe four main dishes, a margherita pizza, a garlic and oil penne, a chicken parm on linguine, and a chicken and broccoli fettuccine alfredo, came next. Our waitress was nice enough to bring some spare plates, as she knew we'd be sharing. The pizza was by far the best dish of them all, with just the right amount of sauce and cheese and an almost sweet crust. The alfredo dish was next, likely because it used their \\"fresh\\" fettuccine for a $3 surcharge. There was nothing special about the chicken, and the broccoli was sparse but tasty. The last two dishes were where most of the disappointment was. The chicken parmesian itself was good, but the linguine it was served over was just lukewarm and somewhat rubbery, with a watery tomato sauce lacking in flavor. At least there was a lot of it (we took some of that home; none of the fettucine remained). The penne was by far the worst. Lukewarm again, and very mild in flavor, no one in my family could be troubled to finish it. \\n\\nIf I can impart a takeaway lesson, it is to pony up for the fresh pasta, or go right to pizza. The stale tasting \\"standard\\" linguine and penne are not worth your time or money, and that's a shame."},{"name":"Ovation Coffee & Tea","address":"941 NW Overton St","city":"Portland","stars":"5","text":"The friendliest coffee shop I've ever been to!

No, really - comparable to the best trailer food in Austin - I'd put it in The Odd Duck's class, and that's sayin' something. \\n\\nStarted with the fried Brie salad - a very good lightly fried brie with greens, fresh berries, nuts, grilled bread and a really really really good dressing that we almost took home to figure out what was in it but decided that would be sneaky.\\n\\nNext came the piece de resistance - the Lamb Burger. Holy Crap it was good. The chef/owner explained he buys a whole lamb and processes it himself - does NOT buy ground lamb but grinds it himself and mixes it with brisket fat for flavor/moisture, mixes in fennel spikes and his own blend of herbs/spices. Juicy, tasty, delicious, and several other positive adjectives I can't think of right now. The burger was served on a fresh sweet bread roll and a side of Japanese potatoe (spelled especially for Texas Dan Quayle fans - both of you) fries.  Hint: This burger pairs well with a medium-bodied red wine - bring your own. Also, the portion sizes are just right - we spilt one salad and one burger but were very satisfied with the portion sizes. Good value here.\\n\\nThe only down note - the seating was bad. Apparently several of their art deco metal chairs and tables had been heisted lately, and they were all chained together by another trailer owner (who was absent this night and thus could not be unlocked) SO we sat in a circle of locked chairs. We were told this will be addressed, that a dining/seating upgrade is on the way. Don't let this dissuade you - VERY much worth the trip.

If you are looking for a typical Japanese restaurant, look elsewhere.  Tanuki is extremely small and intimate, with minimal tables, some seating at the bar, and 6 stools at a counter in the front window.  Low-key Japanese decorations (hanging lanterns, real (gasp!) chopsticks) in Asian pottery complete the laid-back, warm atmosphere.  \\n\\nWe arrived at 7pm on a Saturday night, and I was afraid we were going to meet a huge crowd.  To my delight, we were seated in the window stools immediately (which were my preference anyway).  The concept here is great - everything centers around drinking.  You order food to accent the drinks - so perfect!  We decided to start with some hot house Sake (very smooth) and some Asahi beer (a full Liter for $7!).  Now for food...oh the menu!  I guess it changes all the time, but it is quite a long list of superb Japanese delights.  It is organized into different sections, including Saki, Drinking Snacks, Stuff on Sticks, and Plates.  \\n\\nWe tried as much as possible, and here is the rundown:\\n\\nDrinking Snacks:\\n\\nOshinko ~ Japanese & Korean pickles.  Fresh blend of 5 different types of pickles, all described by the waitress as they were delivered.  Perfect with the Asahi!\\n\\nMyulchi bokke ~ wokked sweet&spicy dried anchovies.  These were simply just not good, not in taste or texture.  Skip them.\\n\\nOjingohchae bokke ~ wokked spicy seasoned dried squid.  These went oh so well with our Sake!  An amazing drinking snack indeed.  \\n\\nLap cheong ~ griddled cured Chinese sausage w/housemade HOT fermented mustard.  This dish had loads of potential, and the sausage was quite interesting.  The sauce, however, was not HOT as stated, and really did nothing to compliment the meat.\\n\\nPlates:\\n\\nWakame-su ~ mixed seaweed salad w/cucumber, lotus & special vinegar sauce.  A light and refreshing option in between the wonderful meat dishes we ordered.\\n\\nOysters ~ 4 Kusshi oysters on the half w/kimchi shave ice.  What else could possibly go better with beer and sake?  \\n\\nNiku dango ~ wild boar meatballs simmered in sweet shoyu bbq sauce.  Seriously, we got done eating this and said it was the best $6 we had ever spent in our lives - MUST order. \\n\\nOn top of providing a wonderful atmosphere, food and drinks, Tanuki is reasonable priced - woo hoo!  They also have a MEAN Happy Hour from what I was reading, as well as Daily Specials (some you can see on their website). \\n\\nThis was a great night out.  Inventive, well-crafted Japanese food served with flare and with PLENTY of drinks.

I would even go so far as to stand outside this place and pay people to not go in here. THAT is how much I hate Mamma Maria. We had our wedding rehearsal dinner here a few weeks ago and they totally screwed us over, in more ways than I can count. \\n\\n- They charged a full rate of $75 per person, for kids. Kids that did not eat the appetizers, the salads, the entrees offered, or the dessert. Basically, the kids (well, the ones that stayed awake long enough to eat) each ate a small plate of pasta. For $75. Given the fact that we had 30 adults eating the full priced meals and drinking a lot of wine, you think they would have given us a bit of a break on the kids. Nope.\\n \\n- Their function menu includes 4 courses (apps, salad, entree, dessert). We started at 7pm. We did not leave there until after 11pm. It took them over 4 hours to serve us. That is absurd. As a result, several people had to leave early to take their kids home (they were falling asleep at the table) or relieve their babysitters. Those folks never even got to eat their dinner (although we were charged for it).\\n\\n- Do you know what happens when you have close to 40 people sitting around waiting, waiting, waiting for food? I'll tell you what. The staff just keeps pouring more and more wine. In fact, they apparently poured so much wine that they ran out of the initial red that we ordered and replaced it with $150 bottles of wine (without confirming it with the host of the party).\\n\\nWhen all was said and done Mamma Maria billed us 30 bottles of wine (we only had 23 wine drinkers!). We seriously doubt that each wine drinker had more than a bottle of wine each. But, we were there for 4 hours thanks to how painfully slow their service was, so who really knows?  We were so surprised by that number that we politely asked to see the empty bottles, but they refused. After a bit of questioning on our part, they did agree to take 5 of the $150 bottles off the bill. How big of them. \\n\\nKeep in mind, they automatically got 20% gratuity on the cost of every bottle of wine they poured. Even all of those glasses that were nearly full when we left that night. Gone to waist because after 4 hours of sitting, many people were just too tired to drink anymore or even eat dessert.  \\n\\nAnd speaking of dessert, the one thing we coordinated well in advance was that there would be at least one chocolate option on the dessert sampler. Out of 4 items on the sampler that night, not one of them was chocolate. \\n\\nThe service was flat out terrible and in some instances, rude. I asked the servers to please ask the kitchen to speed things up and I explained that it was getting late and we had kids there and that we had a big day the next day. This was after hours had passed and still no entrees had arrived. Do you know what he said to me? \\"We have a whole restaurant full of customers downstairs that we have to take care of.\\" That may have been true, but who says that?

I am thinking back and honestly can not remember when I got that angry/annoyed with staff, and wanted to speak with the manager.\\n\\nNeedless to say I received very poor customer service here 2 times, and 3rd when I wasn't even there...let me explain.\\n\\nIncident 1* Girl 1 (G1) takes my order in a bitchy tone for no apparent reason. It goes on the screen for Girl 2 (G2) to make it. I go to the bathroom, the drink should be made by the time I come out, because this is what good coffee houses do! So G2 didn't even start making it. Then while I stand there in front of her, she starts. Then she uses 2% milk, instead of what I designate, I had to tell her that it was wrong, because she didn't notice otherwise...then brushed it off like she knew. Then she uses the wrong tea bag because G1 didn't specify on the screen that I ordered that. Then after all of this, it's made shitty, but whatever I leave because I got my drink literally 15 minutes after I order. I can deal with this maybe on one occasion seemingly as G2 was new, but not anymore from the same person.\\n\\nIncident 2* I come again, it's the same combo of G1 and G2 working. So I am not oblivious to peoples signals, like some may be. When I walked in G1 signaled to G2 with her hands, and her mouth saying like look that look it's that girl. And G1 gave G2 this look. How rude. Anyways I order the same drink, G1 wasn't being that bitchy today. G2 makes it, and tries to make small talk when I could care less. Then I taste it, and it didn't have enough vanilla. I bring this up to G1, and she got so annoyed, like I am not asking you to solve a organic chem problem, am I? She almost grabs the cup out of my hand to put more vanilla in it, but seeming as its such a issue, I just leave. \\n\\nIncident 3* Probably the worst experience out of the 3, and I wasn't even there! So my sister goes in for me one day, and gets the same drink. G1 took the order, and then says to my sister (with a immense amount of attitude) as my sister was describing it, \\"Are you sure you don't want it with soy milk.\\" Then my sister tells G1, \\"What's with the attitude.\\" G1 says, \\"Well there is this girl, this girl who comes in everyday....no every other day to get the same drink.\\" My sister says, \\"You mean my sister,\\" in a firm tone. G1 shouts her little fucking mouth. Seriously, what if I came in every single in the morning (which I don't) to get my drink for the train to uni, or like many people--for work. A lot of people at a lot of different establishments go in for the same beverage, and its their \\"usual\\"...and while those establishments remember your order and make it before you even order, here they obviously ridicule it. \\n\\nAlso while G2 was making another drink prior to mine, my sister witnessed both of them talking about their plans for the weekend and the like, in a loud, obnoxious tone...this is something you should clearly do in front of customers eh! Also she witnessed something that shouldn't be tolerated at all. G2 was making a drink, and she used the wrong ingredients that the customer specified. When G2 gave the customer the drink, she said to G1 after, \\"I don't think they'll notice.\\" Uhmmmmm what if they're not like me, who don't ask after the drink is made if it has the right milk or whatever, and they put their trust in you, to make their drink correctly. What if they the customers had a life-threatening allergy, then what would happen you idiot, you would be liable. Seriously I was shocked. \\n\\nI don't go out of my way to make employees lives hell, but here it was needed. I got in contact with the manager and I told him everything that happened, he was very appreciative, and said action would be taken. A few weeks after being in contact with the manager, I saw new, much friendlier employees working. I still saw G1 working but not G2, wonder what happened...\\n\\nIts quite interesting what people will do without authority because all of this happened without the manager prevalent."},{"name":"Salty Sow","address":"1917 Manor Rd","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"I was tagging along on my bf's business trip to Austin last year.

It's been amazing to see the place progress through its renovations. One thing that has remained the same, however, is the awesome food. You can cook directly on the table if you order two meats, I believe, or you can have them cook it in the back (but where's the fun in that?). Half of the experience is cooking with friends on a table-top grill, so we always opt for that option. Bulgogi and kalbi are so yummy-marinated really well! Other must tries are their seafood pancake and soft tofu stew with beef. The meat comes with the traditional banchan and each meat order comes with a bowl of rice! Really fun and yummy place to dine with a group, with your boo or just with yourself!"},{"name":"Smokehouse 21","address":"413 NW 21st Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Just having moved to the area we were just looking for something to share for lunch while running errands and all of the reviews looked very promising.  The primary reason for the low rating was partially due to the quality of the food, but primarily due to value.  We took the order to go, so I don't know if that had something to do with what I'm about to write.\\n\\nHaving been in the restaurant business for many years I get it, trust me.  Anytime you see where a product is sourced from on a menu that means higher quality, more pride and care given to preparation, and of course higher prices or lower portions due to the increased cost of the product while still wanting to provide value and remain profitable. Unfortunately, this was just a little much this time.\\n\\nThe sides (mac and cheese and greens) were excellent and fairly generous, but in the case of the combination plate, where we chose ribs, brisket and pork cheek, the meats were just plain skimpy.  \\n\\nOk, sure, it's 3 meats, but wouldn't you say that 3 small slices of brisket the size of a silver dollar, 2 small nuggets of I assume pork cheek, and 3 ribs, 2 of which were the smallest tip  end of the rack (smaller than baby back ribs) is just a tad small? The brisket was fantastic, the ribs small and on the drier side, and the pork cheek really, really firm, though not dry, just firm.\\n\\nThe sauces were very good, the service for to-go polite, the space small but efficient.  My only comment on the space itself was actually the floor.  I don't know what happened that day, but it was like walking in an ice rink- the floor was super, super slippery.  I don't know if anyone else has experienced this, but this is a big potential liability issue.\\n\\nWould we be going back?  More than likely no, which is sad.  It's close by, the food is pretty tasty, but the value is just not there for us."},{"name":"Assaggio","address":"29 Prince St","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"Came here on Sunday night of Boston Marathon weekend.

The interior is beautiful and romantic. Walls and walls of wines to choose from, sorted by \\"new world\\", \\"old world\\", and then reds/whites. My boyfriend and I split a Hook and Ladder red blend, and our friends split a Riesling. You get to walk around and literally pick your bottle off the shelf. The whites need a few minutes to chill, but it's not bad and the waitress filled them up after ~8 minutes to hold them over until the entire bottle was cold. \\n\\nI got the \\"award winning\\" veal meatball and our friends got the equivalent flatbread. We all loved it. Later I was craving chocolate and split the pot de creme with my boyfriend. Really good, but also very rich and covered in whipped cream. Probably won't get that again... but I still do want to try more things off the menu. The wine flights also looked interesting and I might try one of those next time. The $8 corkage fee was no biggie to me. Our bottle of wine was $18 anyway, so total it's not bad (all bottle sold at state minimum, so they range from $12-$40+).

I don't mind waiting so waiting for good food is no issue but the mere fact that there is someone in leadership who feels it is ok to be rude, short, disrespectful and do favors for people that he feels connected to is a problem...... A negative nasty attitude is contagious and if he keeps infecting customers and staff either the place will close or need new staff.

The biscuit was nice, but too heavy for me. The eggplant was surprisingly good - crispy on the outside, squishy on the inside. Covered in lightly shaved cheese, it was very tasty with the tomato dip.

There's also a  build your own option where you can select from a large assortment of additional ingredients.\\n\\n It's worth noting that their menu is vegetarian friendly, there are a lot of healthy choices, and Chow Bing also goes out of their way to purchase from natural / ethical / sustainable suppliers . \\n\\nGetting down to the food, I went with the Roast Pork over noodles and I thought it was pretty good. The pork was slow roasted and very tender and the Hoisin sauce gave it a good dose of sweet. \\n\\nOne friend ordered the 5 Spice Beef which he described as a bit bland and unimpressive. Two other friends had chicken salads that they gave mixed reviews of.

I walked in by myself as I was waiting for friends to finish watching a show across the street and I wanted to eat dinner. I asked if I could sit at a small table and didn't want to sit at the bar because I wasn't going to order drinks. I even pointed at the small two top I wanted to sit at. It was slow at the time I walked in so I didn't think it would be a big deal. Instead the hostess takes me to a counter where she just hands me a menu. I wait for 10 minutes and not once has anyone walked by to acknowledge I was there or offer water or take my order. I asked the hostess if a server was going to come by and she said I had to order at the bar but if I was uncomfortable with that I could move upstairs. This was not explained to me when I was sat. So I get off my seat and walk towards the bartender which was standing at the other end and I give her my order. The hostess finally comes by with water,napkin, and utensils. When my order arrived and I started eating, not once has someone come by to ask how my food was or if I needed anything else. Not even the hostess who's hostess stand was next to where I was sitting. Finally when I finish my meal and my water glass was empty, a waitress comes by to take my dirty plate away. I give her my dessert order. Once dessert arrived and I started eating it, again,not once had anyone checked to see how it was or how I was doing. Then, a man in slacks, collared shirt, with a tie on who appeared to be the manager, kept walking around checking up on the staff, but not once acknowledged my presence. After I had finished I had put all my dirty plates to the side to make it clear I was finished but still no one came. It was as if I was invisible. I felt like just walking out. So after getting tired of waiting for someone to bring my bill, I finally get up and walk to the bar and ask the bartender to hand me my check. This was such an awful experience. It felt awkward being in there. The food was good, but the horrible service makes me not want to come back. My friends finally got out of their show and I was going to have them meet me there, but I was so  upset my the lack of service I had them meet me elsewhere"},{"name":"Chick-fil-A","address":"2855 NE Town Center Dr","city":"Hillsboro","stars":"4","text":"We love the food and is a very nice place!!!

Drizzled with a crossing of mayo and sitting on a bed of tomatoes and other vegetables. The texture of the cakes were consistent, no shells left unpicked. The flavor was alright, they did lack strong crab flavor, likely because the cake itself didn't have a high ratio of crab to filler. However, the searing was good and the cakes were cooked well.\\n\\nYing's beef - Beef stir fried in a thick, teriyaki like sauce topped with dry fried green beans and sesame seeds. The flavor overall was good, but the sauce was a little overly salty. The beef had a bit of a crunch on the outside and maintained a soft enough texture on the inside.\\n\\nDrinks:\\nLychee-tini - Pretty good, strong lychee flavor.\\nSangria - Alright, not a huge fan of sangria but there wasn't anything they did wrong with the drink.

The atmosphere was so cozy that we decided to settle in and order a bottle of Villa Maria Sauvignon Blanc and a caprese salad. After chatting over a delicious glass of wine, we decided to go all-in and order dinner despite the amount of food we had already eaten that night. I ordered the Chicken Picatta, and my friend got the Linguine with fresh White Clam Sauce. \\n\\nThe Chicken Picatta was insanely delicious and may be the best I've ever had. It was served with mashed potatoes and fresh spinach. The mashed potatoes were a little soft and creamy for my liking, but they were really tasty. The spinach was perfectly cooked and seasoned with just the right amount of fresh sliced garlic. When I ordered dinner I thought that I would take half of it home, but this was so good that I ended up finishing everything on my plate. The portion size was just right. Not some super sized \\"fat American\\" portion you'll get at most restaurants, and not a minuscule amount that you get at snotty 5 Star restaurant. \\n\\nMy friend's Linguine and White Clam Sauce looked heavenly. I can attest to the fact that her dad makes the best version of this meal that I've ever had, but she really enjoyed Assaggio's version. I was impressed that the linguine was served with the clams in the shell, proving that this was indeed fresh sauce and not from a can. \\n\\nI can never choose a favorite restaurant in the North End, but this was a great find and off the beaten tourist path.

I'm a big fan of Thai as is my boyfriend and we're always on the lookout for new places to try. I found the menu online and we ordered from that. Word to the wise, prices have gone up on some entrees by a dollar. I got the tofu pad Thai, and the boyfriend got the crispy pork. We ordered the chicken satay as an app, but due to a mix up, they gave us chicken pad Thai instead. \\nThe crispy pork was a bit of a joke. There was nothing crisp about it, and it was dry from what appeared to be over cooking. Not very much in the container as well. The side of rice didn't fill up the standard Chinese style takeout container; it came to about the halfway mark. It truly tasted like something we could have made at home - all for $16. \\nThe tofu pad Thai was better, but if this was the first time having tried tofu, I'd have been turned off of it for good. The tofu actually was burnt on some of the edges - pretty amazing. It was tough to chew. The sauce used was alright, but on the sweet side, which I thought was unusual. The portion size was good. The price was reasonable at $12. \\nI also got a Thai iced tea, which was pretty flipping tasty. That was the best purchase that we made at $3. \\nWe didn't try the chicken pad Thai - boyfriend tried a piece of the chicken and was singularly unimpressed. He reported that it was so over cooked that it was sticking to his teeth. \\nAll in all, a disappointment. Maybe it was an off night for the restaurant? I don't know that we'll try it again, simply for the fact that it totaled up to $45. That's pretty expensive for another test run.

There are a variety of tables include a few large rounds in the back.

The staff was friendly and helpful, making plenty of recommendations.  They were fast, courteous, and help with any special requests. Not spectacular but very solid.  No complaints only positives.  1 Star.\\n\\nFood - We ordered a number of dishes.  First of all, it was very traditional with great presentation.  Our papaya salad with dried beef was a great starter, tasting nice and fresh.  Our egg rolls were wrapped in rice paper (Vietnamese style) and taste great, but they were WAY to greasy.  I went off the path and ordered grilled beef rib with vermicelli.  The beef was a little tough and more Korean style, and I was hoping to have something more like grilled beef.

Sometimes the extra star is given for value, but it's really all about the food.\\n1 Star - Will I come back? - If I know for a fact I'll return, I'll give this a star.

Typically I do not eat \\"parms\\", however I figured when in the North end they will at least be passable. This one was awesome - in fact I am still eating it as left overs. Crunchy but loaded with delicious sauce, thin but meaty...very good. The pasta is worth the $3 extra for fresh too. You can buy it there if you like it as well. The only caveat is things must have picked up and got busy, as the line formed out the door, and the tables around us were NOT getting their food. Eating dinner next to a family of 5 with a screaming toddler who WANTS HER PIZZZZZZZAAAA isn't so fun.

Thankfully, Hanabi is not in the business of disappointing its customers.  \\n\\nWhile it's true that the Korean flavors of my Kimchee bowl did not dominate the overall flavor profile, it would also be accurate to say that they certainly didn't diminish from it either.  And in any event, this was a good bowl.  I generally like a rich broth, but this was definitely more than serviceable.  The only one I like better in Austin is Ramen Tatsu-Ya.  Noodles are somewhat thick if you like that style.  The add-ons are all quite delicious though I was hoping for a bit more spice from the spice bomb.  Chashu (pork belly) was nice and tender, the eggs could have benefitted from a bit more soy treatment but were tasty, sweet corn was very sweet, and shoots added a nice textural crunch.   Add in a super bubbly and cool waitress who complimented by Japanese pronunciation (which is actually not the greatest) and you have the makings of a great bowl and great service.\\n\\nWhile I wouldn't describe this as the most representative bowl to what you find back in Japan, it is certainly worth a try even if the Korean novelty factor is not as omnipresent as I expected.

I'm already making plans to come back weekly to my new favorite casual North End restaurant.  LFG's (as I'll call it so as not to spell the whole thing out each time) is a casual, family style restaurant with plenty of room and *gasp* actually reasonable prices -- a nice break from Hanover St.'s overpriced gimmicky 10-seater joints.  A warm fireplace greeted us walking in, and our server was very attentive and knowledgeable. We went on a weekend, so the 5-special sampler was not available; I'd advise trying it if you go during the week. Our group skipped appetizers, and devoured the bread with tableside-made dipping sauce: olive oil, garlic, parm, and pepper flakes. A shame, I saw another table's calamari which looked amazing. \\n\\nLFG's is marketed as a \\"red sauce\\" style Roman cuisine, with enormous portions, and this is certainly the case. My chicken parm came on a massive bed of perfectly al dente linguini (or ziti, if you prefer).  The chicken was cooked perfectly, with a non-soggy breading even with the heaping of cheese and sauce.  My wife ordered a chicken piccata with ziti -- the chicken was fork tender and lusciously moist, with a bold and sharp piccata sauce. Our friends ordered a ravioli dish in meat sauce (I didn't catch exactly what it was, but it tasted like a standard 4-cheese ravioli). The ravioli were large, fluffy, and stuffed full, but the meat sauce was the real winner. People say things have \\"bags of flavor.\\" This had suitcases of flavor. Flavor on top of flavor. Huge meaty taste, mixed with the rich sauce and just tastefully on the edge of being over-seasoned (a really masterful balance; however if you are particularly sodium sensitive I'd advise mentioning that).  His wife got a chicken marsala that looked good, but I didn't get a chance to taste. \\n\\nWe loved that the soda came in oversized glasses, thus not necessitating a refill every 2 seconds. We loved that there was no wait at brunch-time (just after noon) on a Sunday. I loved the fact that the restaurant doesn't take itself so seriously, and even has a \\"Challenge\\" portion for competitive eating. We loved that the portions are enormous -- even by fatboy standards, there's enough for two meals in every entree. The prices are very reasonable -- our meal for 4 with drinks and a garlic bread app (which our evil friends finished while waiting for us to arrive) was still less than $100, or less than $25/person. When you consider that you are getting at least two meals worth, that's a bargain."},{"name":"Applebee's Grill + Bar","address":"10004 NE Halsey St","city":"Portland","stars":"2.5","text":"So Sad.  This was my mom's favorite neighborhood restaurant.  So, to celebrate her birthday a group of our family took her here.  First, we ordered 5 meals and 2 appetizers.  The appetizers we ordered were the artichoke and spinach dip and the crunchy onion rings.  The waitress only brought 2 appetizer plates because she said they didn't have more but would bring the rest of our plates as soon as they come out of the dishwasher.  Looking around the restaurant was only about 30% full and it was just after 6 PM on this past Friday night.  We never got our appetizer plates so everyone huddled up to enjoy them.  The onion rings were good but the spinach and artichoke dip was gross.  Almost no cheese or creamy sauce, it looked like they had saute'd the spinach and seasoned it with a light sprinkling of cheese.  OK, on to the main course.  2 of the dinners were steaks.  One steak was cooked properly, the 2nd steak was over cooked.  The mixed vegetables were almost uncooked.  My son ordered the garlic mashed potatoes.  They looked like a plastic mock up for use in a photograph.  These were not fresh made and had to have come out of a plastic bag and heated in a microwave or somehow steamed.  Not hot in the middle, they definitely looked like a mushroom shaped, plastic mock up. With my steak, the carrots were hardly steamed and as crunchy as if they were completely raw.  The zucchini was similarly hard and crunchy.  I don't eat broccoli so I can't comment on them.  2 of the meals were the oriental salad and both of our family members ordered grilled chicken.  They must use pre cooked and pre packaged chicken.  Again, I find it very, very hard to believe that this was made fresh.  It looked like a pre-packaged, grill seared product that they forgot to heat up or boil (in a plastic bag) long enough to heat up. Both came with barely any salad dressing and we had to ask for more on the side.  Our final meal was a chicken and cheese penne dish.  Nothing strikingly wrong but just not a great meal.  The final straw...since it was my mom's birthday we asked if they had a candle to put in a purchased dessert.  Absolutely not, was the answer.  They are not allowed to bring out matches or fire to the tables, was the response. No attempt to recognize her birthday, etc.  I was shocked.  Finally we ordered some desserts.  Best part of the night.  We did enjoy them.  Just prior to leaving the manager came over during his rounds and asked how our dinner was.  He tried to comp us part, or all of the meal but we declined.  We were not looking for any free meals.  We paid our bill and left. I should have read the other yelps as it would have let me know that if we really wanted to go to an Applebee Restaurant than we should have gone to any one of the other Portland area franchises.

Admittedly, I'd met up with friends who'd already been there for a while, but the servers looked like they didn't know what had hit them. And likely, they didn't. It was busy and I'm not sure they were used to all the walking back and forth, there's quite a bit of space from the bar and kitchen to the outside seating. I imagine it will get even more challenging in the hot summer months.\\n\\nThe food was just okay. I was under the impression that this was a new gastropub, but I did a little research and realized that's not the concept. Still, the cauliflower gratin was terrible, I felt like I was eating cereal. The balsamic reduction made up for what the dish lacked... a true gratin. It was more like cauliflower baked in milk with some cheese thrown on top. The cauliflower was too crunchy, the cheese not enough, the milk, way too much. The octopus was just okay. I was thankful for the olives as the menu description really didn't seem to be what we got. I so badly wanted to like it, but I didn't even feel it necessary to dip what looked like perfectly good crusty bread into the broth (and isn't that the best part?!). The chicken and apple sausage plate was all baguette and though the sausage itself was good, the plate itself felt lackluster, it needed just a touch of something more. \\n\\nFries were good. The best dish we had was the ox tongue slider. It was DELICIOUS, thankfully (or unfortunately?), it was the very first menu item I ate. The dijon was perfectly tangy and you simply can't go wrong with arugula and pickled green tomatoes. The sliders truly set the bar and perhaps that's why everything else tanked in comparison. The cookies and milk dessert was a hit and though not otherworldly, was a decent way to end the evening.\\n\\nI will definitely go back, see what's changed... I know if anything, I'll absolutely enjoy some delectable drinks alfresco with some great friends. \\n\\nContigo, I'm totally rooting for you!

That was the most interesting thing about this place - the menu was fancy pants and expensive (ox tongue sliders!? rabbit & dumplings?) but seating was all outdoors, and the vibe was casual (and yes, the patio is dog-friendly). Location seems so random...I think that's part of what makes it cool - doesn't really seem east Austin.\\n\\nThe good: Love the huge patio. This will be unacceptable during the summer months, but right now its perfect! Happy hour prices are reasonable enough you can branch out a bit a try those ox tongue sliders for only $2 (taste like brisket btw), or some house pickled items like sweet potatoes (interesting, worth trying). Also, they have a pretty fantastic drink menu here and during HH most are $6.  The drink menu was a bit different from what's posted online, so I can't tell you exactly what I had, but everything I tasted I very much enjoyed. (Note they have a few \\"normal\\" items on the menu as well, like beer and a burger)\\n\\nDownside: I spent $40 dollars and was starving an hour later. I really only ate a couple of pieces of pickled stuff, one slider a handful of spicy nuts, one slider, few green beans (just ok, sauce needs more siracha!), some Brussels sprouts (yum!), and two thin slices of eggplant (see below). Boo. Had we only eaten during happy hour, I might say 5 stars due to the great patio, and unique food and drink selection (oh, and parking!). But my appetizer/dinner was the Pork Liver Pate for $7. It consisted of two thin slices of eggplant fried and drizzled with honey. Amazing, but not a lot of food. The pate turned out to not really be my taste...maybe if I'd spread it on the bread slices and thrown the eggplant on top, it would have been more filling. Ah well. Maybe I should have ordered an entree. The hamburger entree looked pretty tasty, and came in at $12. I guess I've seen worse, but the $2 add bacon up charge really gets to me. \\n\\nAgain, good food, fun drinks, great atmosphere. I just didn't feel it was a great value for a group (which is weird since they clearly encourage that by the seating arrangement). It was a split check btw, amongst 5 people... I did get to try a lot of things....Perhaps if I was on my own I could be careful to make more economic choices.  So for value, I'm saying only 3 stars. \\n\\nUPDATE: I have been back several times now for drinks only. That being said, for patio, HH, and drinks, 4 stars. They have brunch too which looks tasty, and I could see this being a perfect setting for a (expensive) Sunday Funday.\\n\\nPS.

Needless to say, it ends up being more like Shitrento's.\\n\\nWe order calamari, a caesar salad, cannolis, and a piece of chocolate cake (I know, I know, I said gluttonous, remember?!!?).\\n\\nThe calamari literally smelled like it had been sitting out for two weeks.

Midtown, your days as the go-to place for the best that Atlanta has to offer are numbered... numbered, indeed.\\n\\nWelcome to SOPO and even So20, South of Ponce and South of 20. This is where it is all happening now.. What you won't find... million-dollar lofts, 2-lb dogs, and mandals.  What you will find is an eclectic, energetic, and hungry community.\\n\\nAs part of this community, I have long hungered for more tasty East-Asian food that does not come from a place that also sells Philly cheese steaks, and Buffalo wings.  Well, my hunger pangs were loud enough that Spoon answered with their second venue near us on the border between East Atlanta Village and Ormewood Park.  Add Grant Park, and honorary Cabbage Town, you have So20.\\n\\nSo far we have only done take-out from here.  We spied them on a regular trip to the establishment next door (Morelli's Ice cream!), when I grabbed one of their menus.  A few days later, we just had to try them out (okay, then next day later).  I ordered the Kang Keaw Wan -- Green Curry, and the wife Beef Pad Kee Mao (there might as well not be anything else on the menu for her), we topped that with a side of basil rolls for an app.  The food was ready in 15 minutes, and was very reasonably priced ($30).\\n\\nThe hostess was highly personable,  made sure that everything was satisfactory, and let us know that they will soon be getting their liquor license.  While the Thai-tini can stay in Midtown for all I care, booze is definitely appreciated in So20.\\n\\nThe food... where do I start about the food?  The basil rolls were very fresh, they were clearly made to order, as they had that snap, that  elasticity that only comes with a fresh roll. The peanut sauce that came with them was sweet at first, but hit you with a good burn.  Then we moved on to our Pad-Kea-Mow and Curry dishes.  Again, there was that snap, another great spice, and another, and wait, more snap, more new and fresh tastes and tingles.  This place was all about fresh ingredients and over-indulgent, and complimentary spices.  Portions were good too, enough to feel full, but not so that we can make a whole second meal out of leftovers.  We enjoyed everything tremendously.\\n\\nI am cautious about giving out 5-stars after just one experience, but will do so here.  No fear, I will be back soon, and will not hesitate to dock, if necessary.  Lets just hope that it doesn't come to that.\\n\\nWelcome Spoon.

We made reservations a few hours before, but when we arrived at 2:30 in the afternoon the place was nearly empty. This might not always be the case, so call ahead.\\n\\nWe didn't get a choice of tea, though they had a good selection of specialty teas like rose tea, lavender, Earl Grey and more on their menu. We did get a choice between coffee and tea though. Little odd, since this is a high tea set. Right. Since we were sitting down for a high tea, I assumed we would be getting a pot of tea. Not so. We were given a mug of hot water and a Twinings Darjeeling tea in tea bag form. Right. They automatically bring out little pitchers of cream (with a Darjeeling? oy) and were accommodating when I asked for milk. Normally, of course, Darjeeling doesn't need milk at all, but this was the powdery bits type tea (aka poor quality.) Also, when I had drank my cup of tea, they came around to fill back up my mug with hot water. Since I didn't want hot water that tasted like a hint of tea, I asked for another tea bag. They charged me for this, but never said so until I got the bill. Not too impressed with that. Also, they leave the hot water ready to go in glass pitchers on the bar counter for easy refilling. When the waitress refilled my cup, the water was lukewarm. \\nThe tea aspect of this \\"High tea\\" was positively dismal. If tea is your thing, then come here with rock bottom expectations. If the tea sandwiches and desserts are your thing, well they did a much better job on that front. \\n\\nThe tier was dropped off without any explanations of that was served. While I appreciate the fact that the server didn't have English as her language, an attempt could have been made. If you have allergies, be warned, you might have to tread blindly through this mine field. The sandwich was something you'd find from a deli, but the other savory foods were good. One was a tuna and egg combo, the other was a salmon and crepe mix. I did not like the salmon with the sweet crepe - just a little odd. The scones were rubbery, a sure sign of an inexperience hand over mixing the dough. The flavours were good, and the jelly/jam provided not nearly enough to cover both scones. Here is a tip, leave the scones alone for now. \\nThe desserts on the top tier, like most high tea tiers, were the most fancy and delicate. They included a mango panna cotta that I wouldn't be surprised was from a grocery store, a strawberry tart that was delicious, and a chocolate mousse cake that had a chocolate ice cream puff on top. Very good! And once you've cleaned out the tiers (except for the scones, you haven't touched the scones yet right?) the experience isn't over yet. The server comes out with the very unusual addition to a high tea, chocolate fondue and fruits. Between the two of us, you get four slices of banana,  four slices of kiwi, four slices of apple and four marshmallows (so two each per person.)  Not all that much fare when you compare it to the vat of chocolate it comes with. This is where your scones come in. Once you've cleaned out the fruit and marshmallows, start tearing up your scones and dipping them into the chocolate. The jam/jelly it comes with doesn't really compare to the molten, liquid chocolate you could have instead. \\n\\nAll in all, this isn't the place to go if you are a big tea person. But if you are on a date, then this is a fabulous place to go and have little desserts and chocolate fondue.

Apparently you make the taco here. Whatever...this place has a great rating, I'm about to eat some fine tacos. No cheese or sour cream, no tomatoes? Fine. That's not Mexican style anyways. I go straight onion and cilantro from the veggie bar. I pick up the barbacoa taco....the first bite is.......fatty. Almost completely fat (but with onion and cilantro!). Yuck.

I don't remember exactly what it was called, but I got the fettuccine Alfredo with sausage and it was great. The Caesar salad was also pretty good. The only thing that was lacking food-wise was the cannoli, as I did not care for the filling in the slightest. \\n\\nNow, on to the service. I should note that I am a server myself, so I am usually known in my circle of family and friends as being the person who's super lenient and forgiving when it comes to service errors. With that being said, this was some of the strangest, most uncomfortable service that I have ever received. I do not remember her name, but she was an older women with short salt and pepper colored hair. \\n\\nWhen we first got sat, our server came over and took our drink order. I got one of their house cocktails and my dad ordered a beer. We told her we needed a couple more minutes to look over the food menu. 3-4 minutes pass, she brings my dad's beer and takes our food order. 15 more minutes pass, so a total of about 20 since first taking our drink order, and I still hadn't received my cocktail. My dad flagged down the server to ask about it. She then tells me that she needs to see my ID before getting it?!? I'm completely fine with showing her my ID, but why didn't she ask to see it 20 minutes ago!! I was completely taken aback. If we hadn't flagged her down, would she have ever even asked for my ID or have given me the drink that I ordered? I have no idea. I felt like I was in the twilight zone. Being a server myself and knowing the ins and outs of serving, I still could not justify this weird series of events with any explanation. \\n\\nThe only other thing worth mentioning is that throughout the meal, she acted very awkward and quite literally hovered over our table, just standing there about 1 foot away from my dad's back. It made me feel uncomfortable and majorly took away from our dining experience and overall ability to enjoy the food. I'm not sure if it's this servers first restaurant job or what, but maybe this restaurant would benefit from doing working interviews with servers prior to hiring in order to see if they can comfortably serve and make guests feel welcome/normal.  \\n\\nEven with the really bad service, I'm still giving this place 3 stars because it's new and I'm guessing their still working through the kinks that come with opening a new restaurant.

Right next to them was Fruit 'n Smoothie Sensations.  Their display case was awesome.  Just a bunch of cut up fresh fruits.  Maybe they were plastic because they all look so good.  Either way, it was way cheaper at around $5 for a smoothie.  I looked at the choices and decided to go with the \\"Belly Blaster\\", just a mix of every fruit you could imagine.  While deciding, the nice cashier asked if I wanted to sample some of the gelato that I didn't notice on the right side of the counter.

Everything else is sweet wonderful flesh that, when cold, is the pinnacle of refreshment...So anyways, I had a taste and I was hooked.  It was like they creamed a whole mango and made it smooth.  Yet everything that I dislike about mangoes was gone. Sometimes mangoes are too sweet.  The dairy portion took out some of the sweetness and replaced it with a fullness of flavor.  It was ice cold as gelato should be yet not hard like ice cream.  Obviously there was no trace of seed.  I ordered one immediately, and threw in some \\"mixed berry gelato\\" too.  \\n\\nThe smoothie was standard smoothie fare.  The mixed berry gelato was...mixed berry gelato.

They also offer a variety of fresh-baked scones that looked marvelous. My only big complaint is that my latte was a bit lukewarm. Although I am sure the barista would have fixed this most graciously, I'm not one to complain (especially after I'm already out the door).

So, here goes.\\n\\nI'll start this by saying this restaurant is fairly new, and this was the first large party that they had to handle, but there was no excuse for what happened that night. A pre-meal meeting and some planning could have saved this event.\\n\\nService - Friendly, but not organized...at all. When we (my fiancee and I) arrived, we were promptly greeted, led to the party, and given a menu. Only a few people were there, but as more people began to trickle in, the staff soon realized there would be more guests to come and attempted to accommodate. They knew well in advance that we were coming...I'm talking a couple of weeks. I'm wondering if either they were given a smaller RSVP count or if they didn't expect everyone to show, or if they weren't ready for the amount of people. You can tell this was their first time handling a party, because they rearranged seating several times and made some mind-boggling logistics choices that separated some people from the party altogether, and almost had the guest of honor (GOH) sitting with his back to half of the party. Having been a server, I suggested the GOH be seated at the end facing everyone. Problem solved.\\n\\nAnyway, we ordered onion rings, fries, and a few frappes as appetizers. No joke, it took over 30 min. for us to get what we ordered, and when it finally did arrive, it arrived in stages, so the frappes arrived 15 minutes after the apps. The apps were only being shared by 3 people, if that! So it's not like it was a lot of food! We watched other tables around us getting drinks, before we got one of ours.\\n\\nSpeaking of drinks, my guess is that they don't teach the 50/50 rule here, because one of the servers definitely picked up my water glass by the rim...where my mouth goes. O.O I was mortified, and refused to drink from that cup anymore. I've seen first-hand, behind the scenes what some servers do with their hands, and it's not pretty. Anyway...\\n\\nWe then scrambled to order our entrees to avoid another wait. Good luck tracking down the servers to do this. There were a bunch of random servers (no-name basis) working with us, and there was no rhyme or reason to when they actually started taking orders. In addition there was no rhyme or reason when it came to serving the food. Food was usually auctioned off and sent to the wrong tables. No one knew who ordered what. There was clearly no table number or seat number system. Food often arrived at the table with each person waiting almost 5 minutes until the person next to them got their food, even when they ordered at the same time.\\n\\nWe then noticed that other tables in our party were getting their entrees! When did they start taking entree orders?! My table ended up being the first group in the party to arrive and the last in the party to actually get their entrees. My fiancee and I ordered their veggie burger, Black Bean and their Chickpea Burgers. It took 40 min. for these 2 burgers to hit the table. They're beans! Not meat that needs to be well-cooked...BEANS! Five other people in our party ordered their mac/cheese when I ordered, and it took them 30 minutes also. My fiance got his food last, 30 min after EVERYONE, because the kitchen messed up, and kept coming back promising \\"2 more minutes\\". They took it off the bill (which they couldn't split, not even by tables), we wrapped it up, and left. By that time, we were ready to leave anyway. The whole situation was VERY UNCOMFORTABLE.\\n\\nFood - After looking at the menu, we ordered fries and onion rings, as there were no appetizer choices on the menu. The onion rings and fries that we ordered for apps were delicious. The onion rings were a bit oily, but they were huge and they were served with a house-made ketchup, which was also hearty and delicious. The fries had some sea salt and rosemary sprinkled over it, which made them very aromatic and added a nice effect. The frappes were delicious, though! Thick and tasty, and they gave you lots of it! I'd come back for that! The veggie burgers that we ordered had delicious toppings that were selected from a sizable list of options, but that's all that was that good. The buns were good, but the burgers themselves were like paste! They mushed out when you bit into them. According to them, this is why it took my fiancee's food 45 minutes, because supposedly, the burger kept falling apart on the grill. FOR REALZ! This is what you guys do, you make veggie burgers. How do you ruin your own specialty?! 45 minutes, though?! For all that mushy consistency, it wasn't even worth the wait!\\n\\nPrices: Good. You can eat well for under $20. That would keep me coming back.\\n\\nI might come back one day, but never with more than one other person."},{"name":"Hanabi","address":"2525 W Anderson Ln, Ste 120","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"Great food!

We went on a Saturday evening just before the Bruins game expecting it to be busy and it was absolutely packed. I must admit I do feel bad writing a mostly negative review because they were so busy but I do feel like its justified.\\n\\nFirst of all, I really felt like the service was lousy, we had to flag down our waitress and ask to order our meal after waiting a solid 20 minutes. I'm fairly certain we would have been ignored the whole night if my beer didn't need refilling. We also had to ask twice for water, the first time she said sure no problem when she came to check if we are enjoying our meal (which I might add was literally while I was in the middle of chewing my first bite) and then we didn't see her again until she came to take our plates away which is when I asked for the second time about my water. I understand it was busy but I genuinely felt ignored the whole night and when we did interact with her, she was off putting to say the least.\\n\\nNow lets talk about the food, I ordered a Ted Williams which is basically a fish sandwich, with fries (onion rings in my case) and baked beans. The bun tasted stale and after eating a third of it I felt like I couldn't eat any more so I just took the fish out of the sandwich and ate it like that. Normally I would have let my server know that I thought the bun was bad and asked for just another bun but she was too busy flirting with some guy to check on us. The onion rings were mediocre, no complaints but nothing special either. The baked beans were served in a nice little crock, except I think I got a total of five beans in it. Although, I will admit those five beans were pretty delicious. \\n\\nFinally, I would like to talk about pricing. I felt like they were overpriced on just about everything, some more than others. I felt like the sandwich at $11 should have been like $8 or 9. The steak tips our friends got were almost $17 and were overcooked. (Would have sent them back but the waitress was nowhere to be found once again). Alcoholic drinks were a little pricey but more within reason but I must say $3 for a fountain soda is a little much if you ask me. Same price for a cup of coffee that was just over half filled.\\n\\nSo in conclusion, I will not be visiting The Four's again. Oh and to top it all off my girlfriend at the time and I both felt extremely nauseous after eating here so if you are planning on visiting this restaurant then I would recommend bringing some Tums for good measure.

Something on the sandwich was really, really salty, so that threw me off a bit. Otherwise, it was a decent lunch. A little spendy for BBQ (over $10 for the sandwich, side and soda).

I think I have found the best biscuits in Portland after a long, sometimes painful journey. Tilt's biscuits are outstanding and their cinnamon rolls are exceptional!\\n\\nI'm a huge biscuit lover, as can be verified by my ample waistline. I was so in love with another highly-reviewed place before I got there that I was so sure I'd found the perfect biscuit, after all, how can so many people express so much love? Disappointed, I met Tilt with trepidation. I'd been disappointed so many times before... I was wrong to fear. Fear is the little mind killer... If you have no other reason than the biscuits, you have got to try Tilt. I opted for the biscuits and gravy and I couldn't have made a better choice. Honestly, I make outstanding sausage gravy at home. Tilt's version was so much better and gave me new ideas on how to improve my own version. It's happened only once before in all my chowing down. I also felt overwhelmingly compelled to order a cinnamon roll after I saw it, calling out in an insidious voice. It did not disappoint. It could've been a little more gooey in the middle, but the bread was tangy, the sweet parts wonderful, and I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it. I was all enamoured of Maggie's Buns until I tried Tilt's version.\\n\\nThere are little conceits that every joint has to try in order to stand out. Tilt's use of shop towels in lieu of napkins is an example. However, this totally works!  The conceit of a restaurant that purports to be a workingman's option is hammered home and a bit overwrought, but still, the staff is friendly and the food options (at least those I've tried) are really stellar! The food was delivered to the table when it was ready, so there's that. The delivery of food on quarter sheets with parchment is sort of fun for a little while, but I really kind of prefer an actual plate.\\n\\nI have to admit that there's a little bit of a learning curve as it relates to ordering and service. For example, when you order coffee, you take your receipt to the coffee station. I opted for plain old joe instead of anything fluffy, but I was rewarded with great coffee and good conversation from the barrista, who had a little bit of Kurt from Glee going on. \\n\\nGiven my hyperbolic review, why is this only four stars? I do think the conceits are a bit much and the ordering/service methods are a bit confusing for a newb like me. I'm excited to try the pie next time as it also looked outstanding, but for now, I think four stars is a fair rating. If I exclusively rated the food I've had, it would certainly merit five stars, but I've already explained what I've had and related it to the service methods. Do try it out!"},{"name":"Szechuan House","address":"3466 Cambie St","city":"Vancouver","stars":"3.5","text":"Take Out last night, have been looking for an authentic Szechuan resto downtown or closeby, other than Szechuan Chongqing on W Broadway which is really good. \\n\\nThe hostess was very helpful in helping select spicy dishes, ordered Szechuan Chicken, Shrimp in garlic sauce, Szechuan style fried rice, steamed rice.

It was a hodge-podge of accents smacking overall of the nineties.  It was screaming to be toned down.  The service was friendly but left a lot to be desired.  We spent quite a bit of the evening scanning the masses for our server.  The food is okay, not stupendous, but not bad either.  However, certain elements of the menu begin to taste a tad too much like uber-glorified chain food.  I think I would have noticed this regardless of knowing the place was a chain.  And the prices for the level of quality was ridiculous.  We had a \\"that was okay, not too bad\\" meal for about $100 a person. The cocktails were good-my favorite part of the meal.

My friend asked if I wanted Vietnamese because she hadn't had Vietnamese food in a while. Me and Vietnamese food = yes please. So we came across the good word for the Green Lemongrass and went inside. \\n\\nOne of my favourite things in the entire world are salad rolls. First I hate when you ask for salad rolls at a restaurant, and someone bring spring rolls (two different things). Second I hate when you get Thai chili sauce for dipping instead of that delicious, heavenly, peanuty sauce of aweseome that normally accompanies salad roll. Green Lemongrass gave me real salad rolls, and the real peanut sauce. These were so good I could have just had two orders and considered it supper. \\n\\nOf course I had a meal too, but the odd thing is I can't remember what it was called. It was a vermicilli bowl, and it had prawns and seafood in it. Either way it was so good. I love how fresh tasting, light but filling Vietnamese food is. My friend ordered a beef dish and urged me to try a little, and it was amazing. There was a lot of food (of course I had the salad roll appetizers too) so I ended taking about have my main meal home, or back to my hostel. \\n\\nThe restaurant itself is nice, clean, although a bit smaller. The service here was courteous and professional. We didn't have to wait too long for our meal, nor were we rushed. There were only a few other people dining aside from us.

At both restaurants I ordered a Caesar salad and shrimp cocktail to begin.  The Black Point treatments of these classics was clearly more in line with the tastes of diners who know what they should expect them to be.  The cocktail sauce was clearly house made by someone who knows how to make it compliment seafood. And the salad dressing had a great deal more character at Black Point.\\n\\nThe entr√©e 12 oz. filet was worth noting. It's wet aged prime meat prepared perfectly.

Beyond that, this donut was fairly dry and flavorless, except for the mint glaze. I haven't found the ideal gluten-free donut yet, but I'd say Kane's is the best texture I've tried so far. For the price and the texture, these are unfortunately an easy pass.\\n\\nCookie Dough Vegan Donut ($3.00) - update as of 9/30/18\\nYeast donut with chocolate glaze topped with chocolate chips and bits of cookie dough. The cookie dough is okay and the chocolate glaze is stellar as usual, but the dough on this was wayyy too chewy. I definitely don't remember VG vegan donuts being so chewy in the past.

But alas, no. Oh well, we won't be coming back.  The logistics of trying to get food, drinks and a table were confusing and chaotic.  We had no less than 5 employees explaining to us the complex rules of trying to get food at Contigo. We never did figure out \\"the system\\" and had to go eat elsewhere after one hour spent and one beer.\\n\\nWe came on a Tuesday night in time for Happy Hour. Hostess said we could order from the bar.  We stood at said bar unnoticed for a few minutes. Then we saw an empty seat and sat down and were promptly escorted out of seating, and back to the patio. We had to be on The List to sit at a picnic table.   We just wanted some happy hour grub and a beer, so we declined being seated for dinner.  Tried to flag someone down for a menu (no luck), to order food? (nope!) and again, the hostesses came over and told us we could \\"order drinks from the bar\\" - we wanted to eat!  Happy Hour FOOD!  But you can't get food at Contigo unless you sit down.  \\nYou can't stand and eat, and you can't stand at the stand-up tables and eat.  You MUST sit. That is The Contigo Rule.  Otherwise, no food for you, Pesky Customer!  However, the problem is at happy hour, there are no seats. Therefore, no food.  Finally, a kind patron was leaving and gave us their table.  Alas, one hour had passed in this fiasco and happy hour was over.   This was my 2nd try at Contigo and they blew it again.  Never coming back.\\n\\nMy first time at Contigo we had dinner and when it arrived my companion whispered, \\"It looks like we'll have to go out to dinner again after we finish here.\\"  His chicken dish was teeny!  Barely any food at all, and for $16.  And my hamburger\\nlooked like an itty-bitty little patty sitting in the bun.  $12 for this hamburger? You can get an awesome burger at Hopdoddy for $6 bucks that blows this one away.  I did eat it, and it was super-salty too, so not even an amazing $12 burger experience,just an overpriced salty burger.

I have been here at least once a week since a few weeks after it opened. As a vegetarian who isn't a huge fan of eggs and doesn't usually have many options at a typical brunch place, VG is heaven-sent! Although I have to say my favorite thing on the menu isn't breakfast, it's lunch -- the melt. It's pickled veggies and tofu and horseradish...YUM. \\nOn the negative side - I haven't found anything else entree-wise I like as much as the melt. I feel like the veggie burger is a little meh - mostly because the toppings are not that great (mostly cheeses). I would love regular sliced mushrooms (your only option is portabellos) or jalepenos or avocado or or or..the list goes on. Why the hell would I put brussels sprouts or black beans on top of my burger (two sides they offer)? THAT MAKES NO SENSE! And actually now that I'm writing this I don't think it comes with a pickle (no pickle with a burger? travesty!!)\\nSame goes for the grilled cheese. I think what I like the least actually are the tomatoes they use here. I ordered a grilled cheese with tomato once and instead of getting a regular slice of tomato inside as expected there was a chunk of roasted tomato inside, flavored with I think fennel - not a pleasant taste and not one I'd expect in a grilled cheese sandwich. Same fennel sneak attack happened when I asked them to add tomato to a breakfast sandwich I ordered. NOT a fan. \\nI really love the chocolate peanut butter frappe - how it's non-dairy, I have no idea, but it's super delicious. Oh and THE DESSERTS! non-dairy cheesecake. it's amazing.\\nOne last complaint - still giving 4 stars here to be generous (more like 3.5) and because I really want to support a veg-friendly place - but sometimes they can be a little consistent with the sides. I've gotten large scoops of potato salad and small scoops, sometimes the potatoes are hard and sometimes they're mushy - but by and large this place is great and I'm so glad it's open. I may be a little harsh with my review but it's only because they are *so close* to being a truly great place with some tweaks.\\n\\np.s. what happened with their pre-opening signs promising they'd stay open late? i think they close at 10 on the weekends!"},{"name":"Gladys Knight's Signature Chicken & Waffles","address":"529 Peachtree St NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3.5","text":"After seeing a special about this place on TV I had developed high expectations.

I'm not someone who cares enough about my restaurant experience to rate and review every restaurant I try.  However, my experience with the poor service, and lack of integrity from this restaurant forced my hand.\\n\\nWe came here for dinner on a Saturday.  For a hole in the wall restaurant in chinatown, the atmosphere is actually above average.  However, that's pretty much where the accolades end.\\n\\nWe ordered the boiled shrimp, pan fried noodles with beef, stir-fried clams in black bean sauce, and the eggplant, abalone and salted fish hotpot.  Overall, the meal was mediocre at best,.  The shrimp didn't taste fresh and was a bit larger than what we were used to (which is not better, given it's priced by the pound and smaller shrimps taste better).  The clams tasted like the were pulled from the frozen foods section.  The pan fried noodles were passable; but then again I haven't heard of any restaurants being able to screw up something like that.  And finally we have the eggplant hotpot...\\n\\nWe spent almost our entire meal intermittently searching for the abalone in between bites.  We finally gave up and called over our server to express our grievance and utter confusion.  Her explanation was that when we ordered, we didn't explicitly state that we wanted the abalone included, therefore it was left out.  So we asked, well did we order the wrong dish and ended ordering something else that was priced differently?  At this point, a guy, whom I assume was the owner/manager explained that we ordered something else and that the eggplant hot pot w/ abalone actually cost more.  We immediately scanned the menu; lo and behold, there's only one version of that dish, and we were charged the full price.  \\n\\nI'm sorry, but when i indicate my order on a menu, I don't expect to have to read aloud every single ingredient in order for nothing to be omitted from the final dish.  In addition, I don't expect to have the owner literally lie to me about different price points when clearly there's only one.\\n\\nIn the end the owner took a measly $2 off the bill for our troubles in an effort to get us out of the restaurant during dinner rush.   My man, keep your $2, I'd rather you get my order correct.

I often times venture to this restaurant before I go to a concert at Club Royale next door. I finally decided to write a review because of mine and my group's experience last night. I had made reservations a few days in advance and called the day of to make sure the reservation was all set. My party of 5 arrived at the exact time of the reservation, and we waited at least 15 minutes to be seated (which is understandable since the party before us was having a delayed turnaround time). When we got to our table, there weren't enough seats to accommodate everyone in the group. Our server also had a severely bad attitude from beginning to end. I must say the service at Abby would be the only reason I stopped going there. It is beyond inconsistent, and I felt really badly because my friends were visiting from DC and Toronto, and I had suggested Abby for dinner. This was one of their first nights out in Boston, but our shoddy waitress's demeanor really set an awkward tone for the beginning of the night. I wish I had gotten her name so I could say something to the manager, but as somebody who works in the customer-service field, I can understand that sometimes there are off days. However, I do not understand why she felt it necessary to take her frustrations and project them onto us. We did not have any outstanding demands, and we did not even make a fuss about being seated late or receiving a table that was too small for the entire group. The cherry on top was when the waitress gave us our check when nobody asked for it, and we were not even halfway done with our food and drinks. Needless to say, I won't be bringing any of my friends to Abby again because of these huge oversights in the wait staff's service. I hope management reads this review and has a meeting to go over best practices for exceptional customer service. I myself deal with customers 10+ hours a day, but I always make it a point to ensure all my customers are well-accommodated because that is the name of the game.

We ordered 3 meals (combo plates) and 4 appetizers for 6 people (one a child) and it was plenty. However, after we'd ordered two appetizers our waiter suggested two more, and we thought they came with the meals. They didn't.

Hanover street in Boston has this place beat at every block in terms of the food experience.\\n\\nThe other thing that really set this place back is significant lack of investment in the wine list. Italian places of this scale, should have a serious wine list. The wine list here is poorly thought and very young such that most of what is available should not be consumed for 3 - 4 years.

So when I saw Chow Bing's menu had items such as Wonton Nachos and Chinese burritos, I let out a loud sigh. \\n\\nI mean a General Chicken Tenders burrito?! Nawww, son. Naw. I was so not having it. \\n\\nUntil I ate a bite of Chow Bing's Wonton Nachos and I was like, \\"Why in the heck didn't someone think of this before?! This is genius!\\" \\n\\nChow Bing's Wonton Nachos are traditional nachos made with wontons in place of tortilla chips. I loved the presentation and the lightness of this appetizer. The wontons are light, flaky, and crispy.\\n\\nThe texture of the wontons, the ingredients in the nachos, and the spicy cilantro sauce drizzled on top make the Wonton Nachos a standout on the Chow Bing menu. \\n\\nThe Lobster Philly Wontons were another hit at Chow Bing. The flavor of the lobster is not overpowering, and the house sweet and sour sauce is a perfect accompaniment. I would love to see more lobster in the wontons, however. \\n\\nMy husband ordered a Roast Pork Bing. The Roast Pork Bing is a burrito filled with roast pork, vegetables, and white rice. It's kinda like a garbage burrito on acid. My husband loved the roast pork marinated in Chinese red wine sauce, but he was disappointed in the lack of flavor of the white rice. \\n\\nI ordered a \\"build your own\\" fried rice Bing Bowl. I built my bing bowl with organic tofu, scallions, grilled onions, chopped peanuts, purple slaw, and pickled carrots.\\n\\nI'd definitely recommend you forgo the white rice, if you order a Bing Bowl or Bing, and you use a sauce on your fried rice. Without sauce my bing bowl was disappointing. However, a generous drizzling of the house sweet & sour sauce made it come alive.\\n\\nOh, did I mention Chow Bing also has Boba Tea?! Boba Tea made with alcohol, to be exact. \\n\\nI ordered a non-alcoholic Mango Pineapple Boba Tea. I liked my boba tea because it was not sickening sweet, and it had a smooth texture. It was more of a smoothie than a tea, actually. Unfortunately the tapioca pearls used in the boboa tea were too hard.

Generally, I'm not a huge fan of fusion cuisine, as it pairs complimentary flavors across different types of Asian cuisine.  The great thing about Asian food, is the pairing of contrasting flavors (whereas in western cuisine, complimentary flavors are paired).  Again, you can use the word fusion here very lightly, as this doesn't quite qualify as fusion as far as the dishes go.  They just simply have some of everything on their menu.\\n\\nThis place reminds me of a similar Thai quick serve chain in Ann Arbor, MI, called No Thai!.  It's not the same thing, but the same concept, and honestly, I think Twelve Hours is better!\\n\\nThe first time I was here, I ordered the lunch special with the Street Noodle Soup, fried Shu Mai, and fried dumplings.  The appetizers were delicious.  I also received a side salad and a beverage (I chose Thai Iced Tea).  The side salad was interesting.  I can't put a finger on what's in the dressing, other than that it's tangy and delicious, with a hint of what I think might be horseradish.\\n\\nNow as for the Street Noodle Soup.... I was in heaven!  The first bite put a smile on my face.  The flavors were just simply amazing.  The broth was flavorful, contained a good amount of meat, and the noodles were plentiful.  Also in the dish were pieces of chicken, fried wonton strips, cilantro, bean sprouts, shrimp, and half a hard boiled egg.  Although tasty, the dish did seem to be a bit heavy in the sodium department.\\n\\nThe second time I came here (it was so good that I came back the next day!) and got the lunch special with the crispy chicken pad thai, green Bermuda triangles, and seaweed salad.  I received the same side salad again, and opted to get the Thai Iced Tea again.  The Thai Iced Tea is very good!\\n\\nThe Green Bermuda Triangles were interesting.  Crispy on the outside, squishy on the inside, with an interior texture not unlike Chinese taro cake/pudding.  Eat them while they're hot because they're totally gross once they cool down.  The seaweed salad is the fusion part I suppose, because that's a Japanese thing, not Thai.  It was a very good typical Japanese style seaweed salad, made from rehydrated seaweed, sesame seeds, sesame oil, and rice vinegar.\\n\\nThe crispy chicken pad thai was wonderful.  The portions were plentiful, and it came with what appeared to be an entire breaded and fried chicken breast.  Now, I elected to get a regular pad thai with crispy chicken, not your typical crispy chicken pad thai where they use egg noodles that crisp up in the wok.  Again, this dish as a bit heavy on the sodium (especially in the chicken), but still delicious nonetheless.  I'd like to point out that I'm not on any sort of reduced sodium diet, or have any qualms about consuming too much sodium.  It's just that the entrees here are noticeably slightly over seasoned and make me thirsty after the first couple of bites.\\n\\nI wish this place was along the way on my evening commute (it used to be before my employer moved me to a different location! Darn it!) so that I could simply grab take-out every day on my way home.  The portions are very large for the price, and I think I might have to start finding excuses to come here in the future!

Went  in this past friday and enjoyed my meal. The salmon  dish on the  charcuterie  board was warm and  it's never been served to me that way before- not as good that way but  certainly could overlook that because  they make it there in house and i can see being low on a busy weekend and having to get some before it cooled. the bread has also changed on that board- the new bread REALLY is not as good.\\n\\nMy food was good- so was everyone elses. Server was the problem( christina)- she was just not someone who should be in a service role. She never filled waters and never checked on us; she wasnt friendly in general but When I realized that the wine we had ( from the reserve list) seemed to have a cork in it she became  very defensive. Turns out it was a huge block of sediment not cork. The manager told us they never really serve that wine so they didn't realize it was like that. ( even though the guy helping the waitress told us it was very popular and  we have actually had it before twice and it had been decanted for us).\\nI didn't like being treated like that by Christina and her manager- i don't think it was  the  main manager because I have seen other managers in there in the past; one has actually decanted that same wine for us.

Served with oil containing Parmesan cheese and cracked red pepper, the dipping oil was very tasty!\\n\\nThe salad was pretty standard, fresh romaine with cherry tomatoes, cucumber, red onion and olives.   It took about 20 minutes for our lunch entrees to arrive and the portions were very generous.   The shrimp was cooked perfectly with a great strong garlic (which we loved) taste  The eggplant parm was thinly sliced lightly breaded and the veal was very tender.  I prefer a lighter, less hearty sauce but nevertheless, it was still good but my friend didn't think the red sauce was anything \\"special\\".  There is a $3 upcharge gluten free pasta which my friend is appalled by but it was very similar to \\"regular\\" pasta, not gritty (usually corn based) or mushy (usually rice based).\\n\\nWe couldn't not have been more pleased with our server, the food was good and plentiful.

Everyone around us seemed to be enjoying their meal, which definitely adds a nice touch to the dining experience. \\n\\nMy friend ordered the calamari and mussels, while I ordered the pesto scallop (one of the specials). We also split a bottle of white wine, which was decent for the price of $30. Our food didn't take too long to arrive, given how busy the place was, and it was delicious! The scallops were very well cooked, and my friend seemed to enjoy her meal as well. The portions were also very good, not too big or small. \\n\\nThe waiters were professional. I take a while to eat when enjoying good food, so my friend was done way before me. Nonetheless, the wait staff left my friend's plate until I finished as well, so not to rush me. Shortly after I finished my meal, they asked if we wanted the bill. Sometimes that can come off as pushy, but given that it was a Saturday night and we were taking up valuable table space, I was fine with it (plus it was tactfully asked). \\n\\nOverall, an enjoyable experience that checked off both my friend and my wishlists. While I'm still curious about other restaurants in the area, this is a place I wouldn't mind eating again on my limited time in town."},{"name":"Assaggio","address":"29 Prince St","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"I'm left puzzled because of all of the great reviews at Assaggio. I told my daughter that for our last night in Boston we had a choice, we could have Italian or seafood, as we can't get things like Ipswich clams or haddock where we live (but we can get great seafood) and we can't get Italian food worth a flip unless we make it ourselves. She wanted Italian.\\n\\nIf anyone from Assaggio is reading this - please, turn up the lights a bit more because the place was too dark. They definitely are going for a romantic setting, but the tables are far too close together to achieve that. The decor was also a bit dated.\\n\\nThe menu is old school Italian, which is both good and bad. If you're looking for a menu that has core pillars in classic Italian dishes that have been around for decades, this is a great menu - and there are some modern dishes sprinkled in.\\n\\nMy daughter ordered ravioli in  a marinara sauce, and I ordered veal Parmesan, along with starting with a classic style antipasto misto salad we went old school across the board. My veal was, a bit of a let down. No, don't get me wrong, it was prepared well and it was tender, but the cutlet was anything but; but more like a breaded veal steak. The pasta was overcooked which was pretty surprising for me.\\n\\nOur waitress was rather inattentive, seeming more interested to have conversations with her coworkers than serving her two tables. \\n\\nI didn't find Assaggio bad, and it certainly bests any local offerings in my home town, but there is much better in the North End - or maybe I just caught it on a bad night."},{"name":"Life of Pie Pizza","address":"3632 N Williams Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"Best pizza in Portland.

I passed by it and immediately I loved how cute and European it looked.  I was hunting for a good dessert so I decided to explore the area more but eventually came speedwalking back.  I was yearning for ice cream so I made a beeline for their gelato but I couldn't help but be tempted by the assortment of biscuits, such as mini elephant ears, an array of biscotti, chocolate coated pizzelle, and other italian cookies.  They also had cakes and truffles!  I decided on a strawberry gelato scooped onto a mound of pistachio gelato (strawberry is always my control test - I'd like to consider myself a frozen dairy product connoisseur - and pistachio was what sounded good to me at the time), along with one (just one, ok???) chocolate cookie that was studded with pistachio nuts.  The verdict?  It was perfect.  I'm excited to come back again to try more of the biscuit varieties (and other pastries - they also had croissants and spanakopita) as well as the other exotic gelato flavors, like fig and baklava. There was also a sit down section, so will have to coax the boyfriend into coming back.  AND it was established in 1938 and I'm a sucker for old places; I'd like to think they've been around for that long for a reason.

We first visited Nashville and later came to Austin. First thing I noticed was how friendly people were in Nashville and Austin. I've lived in Cali my entire life and I knew giving Californians a good name while visiting Austin was very important. We first decided on Salty Sow because of the amazing views on Yelp. We went about 7:00pm. We walked in and saw no one waiting at all. Parking wasn't bad. We got into the restaurant and the host (male, young) was very rude to us. I was so disappointed by this because I was really taking note on how this city was. He said the wait would be 1.5 hours. He explained because of the rain (it was barely sprinkling) that they were only seating half of the restaurant. We told him \\"we will wait\\". My boyfriend and I decided to wait in our car. 25 min passed and I decided to go inside and ask how many people were before us. I went to the same male host and he looked super annoyed that I was asking. He said 10 people were before us which I found so strange because no one was waiting. I went back to the car so sad that the host was being so rude. It made me want to leave but we were already waiting and I really was impressed with the reviews. We waited some more and it was about 50 min we waited at this point. My bf and I both decided to go back inside and ask how many more people now at this point. We go inside and say \\"hi how many more people before us\\"....the host annoyingly grabs two menus and says \\"JUST seat them outside\\" handing the menus to a young female. At this point I'm fuming! \\"JUST??? Seat them outside\\" like we are just some leftovers??? I am disappointed at his attitude, and I'm disappointed at this whole time we were waiting in the car and they told us they were only seating inside! It would have been polite to be notified!!!! \\nThe female young other host seats us and I tell her politely \\"can I just express that the male host at the front was extremely rude and I didn't appreciate it\\" she said she will tell the manager.

I set the timer on my phone and we waited another 3 minutes before someone asked us what we wanted to drink. At any restaurant you are supposed to wait at least 30 seconds for at least eye contact. \\nBy the way, while we were outside, I noticed a couple who came literally 5 min after us when we put in our name! And they had their FOOD AND DRINKS! It is as they say them down literally while we were waiting in the car! I was so confused and annoyed. I told my bf if our waiter is anything like the hostess we are leaving. \\n\\nLet me express that the waiter was AMAZING! He was beyond kind! Because of him, I salute this place. Because of the host, I hate this place. Because of the food, I love this place. The waiter, I wish I remembered his name. I can tell you what he looked like. He was tall skinny young and green eyes!!!! He had dark tone skin color and super polite. Reminded me of Dr. Avery from Greys Anatomy. He apologized for the wait and apologized for the host.

After all, you can't have too much vegetables in your diet.\\n\\nNow back to it's authenticity.  I don't think it is authentic at all.  I think it is a very well done burrito tuned to Americanized taste buds; think of it as a very fancy Taco Bell -- with real meats and vegetables.

Unlike Franklin's, they don't have chairs to let people use while waiting in line, but I don't see why you can't bring your own. All of the seating is bench seating outdoors so make sure you pack your sunscreen, hat, and sunglasses. There are also some other food trucks around in case you want a coffee or a snack. They also have a keg of Lone Star that you can help yourself to, so that's a nice touch. \\n\\nOnto the meats: I tried the brisket, beef rib, and pork ribs. The brisket was definitely the star of the show, and I actually like their's more than Franklin's brisket. Both of the ribs were really good and fall right off the bone, and beef rib in general is not as common so you should definitely get one. \\n\\nTip: They usually run out of brisket by 3 or earlier so make sure to come earlier. They will offer you the chopped brisket, which is fine in a sandwich but is nothing compared to how the slices of brisket are. In fact, I would even go as far to suggesting to hop out of line if they run out of the sliced brisket."},{"name":"Happy Tree House BBQ","address":"105 - 8171 Alexandra Road","city":"Richmond","stars":"3","text":"I went to this place with a group of friends and paid for dinner. Unfortunately, several people got food poisoning afterwards, though I did not, so I can't say with 100% certainty.  In any event, the bill came out to be about $300. On my credit card statement however, I saw that they billed me two times for that amount. I called them to let them know that they double charged me, but they said that they did not and hung up. I ended up spending 20 minutes with the credit card company to initiate a charge back.

An autumn classic that tasted heavenly. I normally don't like sweet entrees, but the ravioli was so plump and lush, and the sage butter was amazing. \\n\\nFor entrees, I got the Rabbit. One of the most interesting dishes I've ever had. It's not actually a favorite taste in any way, but a really unique flavor. It's hard to describe, but it's like what wine does to some dishes. The meat was tender but chewy, the pappardelle pasta was thick and fresh, and the rosemary seasoning was just a crazy fantastic way to season the dish. I've recently decided I want a bunny, so I may never order this dish again. But I'm glad I tried it.\\n\\nThe boyfriend got the Veal Chop. I preferred that dish in terms of taste (can't go wrong with savory meat), though I don't regret mine. The garlicky broccoli rabe was fantastic and the chop was breaded to a perfect crisp. Mmmm!\\n\\nThe restaurant is definitely a stuffy, heavy curtains, thick upholstery, type of place with lots of refined, elegant, 50-something people talking about their many sojourns to Paris, Rome, Prague.

I had to say something, because honestly, it was pretty unusual. She seemed embarrassed and said that yes, they aren't in season right now. This is true. Watermelon is not in season in January. I would suggest that another fruit be chosen. It is just something that really rubs me the wrong way. If you wouldn't eat it, don't put it on my plate.

After our dinner and drinks the General Manager came over to ring us up (I believe his name was Cody?) and asked if we wanted to go on a tour! AWESOME!!

Look for the music place which is right next to it, I kept seeing that but Spokesman is hidden unless you know what it looks like. Once you walk in it's pretty cool. It appears to be a converted garage with lots of seating along the walls with outlets and free wifi to get some work done. There's also a long line of draft beers and a little water station. I wanted to eat breakfast here so at first I was disappointed in the very small breakfast menu (lunch menu included sandwiches but it started at 11:00am). The breakfast menu is granola and yogurt, pastries, or soyrizo wrap. At first I considered just getting food elsewhere but then decided a breakfast wrap would be fine. Could not have been happier with this decision! It is less of a wrap and more of a panini. It is toasted and crispy on the outside with a warm vegetarian filling on the inside and comes with two spicy dipping sauces. I live an hour away and I would seriously consider returning just to taste this soyrizo wrap again!"},{"name":"Carmelina's","address":"307 Hanover St","city":"Boston","stars":"4.5","text":"Went for dinner tonight for my son's birthday.

That being said, as far as I'm concerned, it's really about locations, convenience, and when I'm in the mood for their turkey meatloaf or the grilled mac & cheese.\\n\\nBut if I'm being too presumptuous in assuming most have already been to a Flying Biscuit Cafe, long story short: Atlanta-based, mostly-breakfast-but-good-all-around-menu-and-known-for-their-hearty-biscuits restaurant that has now since expanded generously throughout Georgia, Florida and North Carolina.  The tastier, heartier, more satisfying alternative to a Denny's, IHOP or any other greasy spoon dive when you're in the mood for breakfast food.\\n\\nAnyway, I'm going to go out on a limb and say that the Buckhead Flying Biscuit might just be the best location in the city, in my humble opinion.  The \\"native two\\" (Candler/Piedmont) FBCs are simply put, too crowded, and most of the times, a nightmare to park for to be worth the trouble.  Parking is one grievance, that once overcome, you're subject to the egregious wait times, that they'll ask you to wait outside, for obvious reasons, and the wait times get a little lengthy due to people camping out to hope to see Baton Bob march by, that they simply eat too slow, or are too mesmerized by the hipster-y \\"originality\\" of being at one of the originals.  Either way, I've found myself less and less inclined to go to the original locations, simply because it's a bigger pain in the rear than it's worth.\\n\\nIt's not often I give Buckhead praise, but back to the point, I'm going to say that they have the best Flying Biscuit in the city.  Simply put, they have the same issue of wait times that can be long, because when it comes to breakfast/brunch, business is bumping there as well, but because it's not a monumental pain to get there, it's not so much of an issue.\\n\\nConveniently located right near the Tower Place section near Lenox Square, it's a place easy to get to from 400 or if you're traveling down either Piedmont or Peachtree Rd, as well as close to a MARTA stop, which works great for tourists on foot.  For those of us driving cars to get there, it may appear inconvenient to have to pay for parking, but as long as you're not planning on eating for over two straight hours, Flying Biscuit will graciously validate your parking, and alleviate that anxiety just like that.\\n\\nIt's a Flying Biscuit with plentiful, convenient, sheltered parking.  A pretty far cry from the Midtown locations.  Speaking of shelter, the entrance to the Buckhead FBC is also sheltered, so when you're inevitably forced to wait outside because the place is packed, it's not as inconvenient, especially if it's raining outside.\\n\\nAesthetically, the inside of the Buckhead FBC is comparable in size and seating capacity of Candler Park's, I would say, but the fact that it's not essentially a repurposed house, it feels vastly more spacious and breathes better, as well as makes it not feel so cramped and crowded. \\n\\nThe bottom line is that I put a lot of weight into convenience of location, to which I think Buckhead's FBC excels at in comparison to the other locations.   The food is all about the same, and the service is as respectful as you give back to them, so I've personally never had any problems with that.  Basically, if I have to entertain any out-of-town guests who have done their homework and want to go to Flying Biscuit, I'm taking them to this location.  Also being in Buckhead, which most tourists still seem to think is the bee's knees, they still feel like they're in the middle of the city while I'm just relieved that my bumpers aren't going to get tapped, and my doors have less chance of getting dinged."},{"name":"Dizin FruttiBerri","address":"127 Mt Auburn St","city":"Watertown","stars":"5","text":"Whether you are Iranian, Middle Eastern, have had Saffron icecream, or not, you should hurry and try this place becasue it is AMAZING!

The place doesn't seem to have A/C, and in Florida this is the eighth deadly sin. There's one TV on the left side of the restaurant as you come in, usually with some cartoon on for the children of the employees. You will usually come into a completely empty restaurant, even though there's ample seating. There is a reason for this. \\n\\n2) Do not get delivery. Just pick it up if you're ordering Chinese in this city, period. This isn't New York. Deliveries can take up to an hour or more (and I basically live across the highway from this place). They only deliver within a 4 mile radius too. There's also the typical $15 minimum, $2 charge and a tip only to have lukewarm food by the time it gets to you.\\n\\n3) Don't expect 5-star Chinese food from what is essentially a 3-star take-away.\\n\\nAside from that, the food is pretty good for what it is, and the portion sizes are rather large. I personally think they have some of the best fried rice. It's not as salty as typical Chinese, so the MSG doesn't kick you in the mouth when you eat it. It is a little pricier than typical Chinese take-aways of this quality. \\n\\nIf you want something to pick up on the way home or at lunch, I say why not?"},{"name":"Shula's 347 Grill - Lake Mary","address":"2974 International Pkwy","city":"Lake Mary","stars":"3.5","text":"Very disappointing experience. For starters, the salads did not taste as if they were fresh. We both ordered filet mignon steaks, my wife requested medium well done and I requested medium rare. My steak was served with a bleu cheese topping, which I did not request, and which I agreed to just push off to the side. It was quite clear that the preparation of the steaks was switched, my steak was medium well done, my wife's steak was medium rare. When I pointed this out to the waiter, Danny, he insisted that my steak was actually cooked medium rare and the lighting in the restaurant made it appear medium well done. Considering the supposed quality of this restaurant (not to mention the prices), this was not the response that I expected. I at least expected some kind of apology for our experience up to this point and for the waiter to resolve this. I decided not to make this experience any more unpleasant and not to argue.  (Perhaps I should have, but I believe that it's restaurant management's job to ensure quality service, not mine.) Eventually the waiter did agree not to charge me for a second glass of lemonade.

Then we got the bill - no discounts, never got an apology - our waiter completely ignored the whole situation.
