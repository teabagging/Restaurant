I didn't have it, but the creamed kale was apparently quite undercooked and tough.  With 4 people, quite a bit was left.  My filet was delicious, although unevenly cooked.  The sole was a hit, as was a burger.  The chicken schnitzel was nice, but too thick.  It and the steak should have been offered with sauces.  The asparagus was very thick and hard to cut but the flavor was lovely.There were four desserts; the warm chocolate cake was nice, but came with about half the ice cream necessary to have a little bit with each bite, and a tablespoon at most of raspberry sauce.  The lemon cake was superb.What we disliked intensely was the noise.  The bar was actually quieter than the restaurant, where music was so loud that conversation was nearly impossible, even with the person next to you.

Most of the dishes included on this menu were ones I usually ordered so I was happy about the meal to come. The big let down was the meal came in super tiny portions and I and my girlfriend ended up having to order more food just to feel full. The food was not as good as usual but the place seemed really busy due to the Groupon promotion. The service was particularly crappy on this day as well with food taking too long to arrive and waiters who didn't seem to care.Still, my experience in the past has been great and the food is usually very good. If you go, make sure to order the Ginger Beef and the Szechuan Green Beans. Definitely my two favorite items on the menu.

I arrived early on so I was able to eat a light dinner here and have plenty of beer. The beer menu is impressive. They have about 30 different beers on tap, many of them are  local beers and craft beers. You have two options for drafts, 16oz or 23 oz. It's definitely a better deal to go with the 23oz. The beer prices were...odd. A 23oz glass of, say, Lagunitas IPA is about $8.50 (I'm ballparking here). However, the Bud Light is barely less expensive. The prices were craft beer were awesome, better than some bars that specialize in craft beer...but the Bud products were very overpriced. Usually places use Bud Light as a cheap option, but I'm pretty sure they sell a bottle of Bud Light Platinum for over $6.The food was good. I shared the Pork Street Tacos and the giant pretzels with my girlfriend. The tacos come out in a platter for you to put together yourself. I liked this touch and was definitely not expecting it. The pretzels were HUGE, and they come with mustard and a Sam Adams Cheese Sauce. The cheese sauce is frickin' amazing. I am so glad we decided to order those.Our private room quickly filled up, and while we only had one server, she was wicked attentive. Despite having to take orders for over 20 people, many of whom were ordering different drinks and food items left and right, she never forgot anything.

Well, it might be too early to judge since I've only ordered once, but it was an impressive meal.I got the lamb vindaloo and asked for very spicy, pashwari nan, and kheer. I was happy with the vindaloo because it was spicy just the way I liked it. I have high tolerance for spice, so it wasn't hell-ish spicy, but spicier than what other places make, which is a good thing. The pashwari nan was yum!! The highlight for me though was the kheer. I grew up with English rice pudding, and this brought back memories of the good old days. I haven't tasted kheer like this in years! The only downside is that the serving was so small, like 1/2 cup that I was left hanging. I really wish they increase the serving size because I literally need 4-5 times the portion they give now. Otherwise, I'll have to learn to make my own kheer to enjoy every single day.I really would've given this place a 5 star, but the teasing portion of their dreamy kheer tells me that I gotta take a star off.

Eventually, he agreed to seat us together, but seemed to imply that he was doing US a favor.  Not a very good first impression.When we arrived, we did have a moderate wait before our table was ready (about 15 minutes), but we were seated together.  Our waiter, Sean, was very good.  There were times when he wasn't as available as we would have liked, but it seemed that he was working too many tables, as were most of the other wait staff.  He did his best.Sean was good at recommending wines that pleased everyone at the table.  I have the Silver Palm Cabernet.  It was a very nice table wine.  I had the Bruschetta, which was crisp and flavorful.  My main course was the Fettuccine Calebrese, also an excellent choice.  Others in our party were equally satisfied with their choices.Walking into this restaurant, I was ready to give it a 2-star rating because of our initial experience on the phone, but the food and Sean's dedication to our table made it a 4-star rating.Make no mistake, the management needs to attend to managing all aspects of the experience, specifically, their phone etiquette and their staffing levels.

The atmosphere of this place is very classy, I wish I knew more about interior design to describe how sleek this place is.

The andouille was fresh and complimented well with the flavorful bacon. Baked beans were doing a decent job with filling me up, but I managed to wipe the skillet clean. I'm not a fan of foccacia, but their offering was very exceptional as it was perfectly baked. Crisp on the outside, soft on the inside. My second visit, I had the Tangine. (Poached eggs, spicy tomato stew, red pepper, merguez sausage, moroccan olives, cilantro. Grilled foccaccia). This was quite the plate. Poached eggs were beautifully cooked into perfect spheres and the stew was very fresh and hearty. Perfect to have on a colder day as it ignites your taste buds. In addition, a serving of fresh hummus on the side was fantastic. The foccaccia bread complimented well with this dip. Cafe Medina dethroned Plum's Cafe as my favorite breakfast place.

I was instantly greeted by two staff and I didn't have to wait long because I sat at the bar.The bar is decorated in the same blue and rustic colours-- very old school :) The staff is very attentive and warming; having informed me about the hook under the bar for my bag, serving water immediately, asking how the meal is going, having small talk with the customers, being at your service within a few seconds of looking up, and presenting the plates with a smile.I got a waffle with plain maple syrup. I watched them work as the prepped the ordered. All the waffles were lined up to be plated. Presentation is consistent; all plates were wiped and the napkins and plates were perfectly aligned to your table when presented.The waffle is chewy but still crispy and light. It's just like eating a funnel cake or a doughnut.Food is familiar and established and they have their service down pat. It's not just that they serve with a smile, but they are very efficient and precise in doing so. Nothing is done sloppy here. You get quality.

There is a huge selection for both breakfast and lunch, but personally I have never made it past the breakfast menu when I order.  I have tried a variety of the omelets, and there is no skimping on ingredients.  The eggs are of excellent quality and they have all been cooked and finished to perfection.  My only issue was with a bacon omelet that actually had too much bacon.  I never thought I would say that in my life.My go-to choice is the combination breakfast which I usually get with one pecan pancake, two eggs, and the home fries with the occasional added side of bacon.  (You can choose home fries or bacon on the combo.)  The pancakes are enormous, so unless you are fond of taking pancakes home, one is plenty.  For the pecan pancakes, the pecans are lightly toasted and more than generous.On the lighter side, the breakfast salad is a delicious yogurt with a lovely blend of granola, fruit and honey.  My sister got this last time and we shared off the combo and both left stuffed.  The service has always been friendly and helpful with suggestions.

It was the perfect carb-loaded breakfast that we needed and I always leave utterly satisfied but with some motivation to go running later.The biggest reason for the update besides the delicious food is that Husby parked the car and walked through some people to stand in line with me.

The staff made me uncomfortable, used an angry, stern voice and showed very little compassion for me. Having spent the weekend at a funeral mourning the loss of a loved one, this interaction was highly upsetting. While I admit, I should have called ahead to ask if dogs are welcome - previous Starbucks experience had be believe there would be no problem. I understand my own fault in this situation, but am still deeply put off by the lack of empathy and lack of compassion from the staff. I was kicked out with no coffee and no compassion.

For proteins -  at the end of the self serve line, staffs await to cut you the weigh and type of meats - we went with 1/3lb pork ribs, 1/3lb chopped beef, 1/3lb moist briskets. Compared to Rudy's (the only other Texan BBQ experience I'd had thus far), all the meats from Terry's were too salty. Not sure if it was because of the dry rub? or their seasonings? We had to douse a lot of their sweet BBQ sauces on to mask the saltiness. In addition, their cuts of meats felt as if they were just lower grades - their moist briskets were almost entirely fats, their chopped beef were shredded leftovers, and their pork ribs were also insanely fatty. I spent the majority of the time scraping edible pieces. The 4 sides - I did like that their sweet corns were in a thinner sauce and their beans were less ketchupy. But their Mac and cheese and potato salads I could do without - very generic, out of the microwaveable dinner tasting. Overall - not sure if Terry's BBQ reflects austin's standard but definitely not the best of any BBQ places we've had. We did however enjoy the post dinner - smoker tour!

The plan - go to Nuba for dinner, then next door to the Tiki Bar for drinks. We're a little older, and lot of my friends had kiddies at home, so an early dinner followed by drinks suited us fine. We were poised to hit a restaurant and a bar at non-peak times, drop a few grand, and be gone before it got busy. Any proprietor should drool at this.I called ahead and was told that for large groups they do a fixed menu, and that they don't reserve at the Tiki Bar, but since it'll be early, we should have no problem getting seats for our group afterwards. Sounded great to me.The room is nice, the server seemed great. The food quality was pretty good, but the quantity was a joke. $20 a head gets you significantly less than if you ordered a-la-carte. Pita with hummous with baba ganoush and tabouleh to start. Yummy. Next dish is a bit of Najib's special cauliflower (best cauliflower on earth), mini falafel, delicious fresh feta, and other delights. The meat was on the side...one seriously overdone lamb popsicle (Vikram Vij would weep) or marinated prawn per head. That's it.  My wife is barely 100 pounds, and she was still hungry. I'm way more than 100 pounds, and I was still starving at the end.But to the TIki Bar we were to go, so the bills started coming. I kid you not - from the time the first bill comes to the last takes nearly an hour. At this point of the epic review, I invite you to read my other reviews. I'm not a cranky guy - I eat out a lot, and I'm pretty forgiving and understanding. I've eaten at Nuba many times at the downtown location and once at the Main St. location, and always enjoyed it. I'm embarrassed that I brought my friends to this place and livid that I had to spend my birthday twisting the managers arm to try to get my friends bills settled at the restaurant. The manager did manage to get us seats at the Tiki Bar, so at least that.I don't chuck out one-star reviews often, but considering how much fun tonight should have been, and how lame I feel right now, I feel the review is deserved.

The cream filling was excellent but thought the puff itself was a little doughy and not the best I've had."},{"name":"Gus's World Famous Fried Chicken","address":"117 San Jacinto Blvd","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"A native Memphian, I had to do a double-take and gave myself a good dose of whiplash when I first saw the Gus's sign downtown a couple years ago. It's taken me awhile to write this as I felt the need to do my proper research given my history with Gus's. In short, I have Gus's in my blood having eaten at their original location in Memphis since I was a wee tot, and let me tell you, I am one tough cookie to please. I have been very critical of this location's performance and have come to the conclusion that they have yet to let me down! The crispy, juicy (but not too juicy!) goodness of their chicken with that slap yo mama kick of spice transports me back home at first bite. The best part, there is NEVER a bad bite of chicken (you know what I'm talking about - the kind that ruins the whole meal - yeah, not even a speck of gristle on these babies, ever). The meal isn't complete without full servings of their tangy, crunchy, heavenly fried green tomatoes and fried pickles. A word to the wise, don't even think about stepping foot in here without ordering BOTH of these or you'll be missing a kaleidoscope of flavors that'll knock your bobby socks off. The mac n' cheese rules too.The meal isn't complete without a sampling of their scrumdiddlyumptious pies. The chess pie tastes like coming home and jumping into a soft bed of sweet goodness...you'll want to roll in it, it's that good. If this tells you something, when they first opened, my boyfriend and I chose Gus's for our Valentine's Day dinner (over Uchi and Justine's, yes, I'll say it - RECOGNIZE!). Our request for dessert was a slice of each flavor of pie, which I proceeded to rabidly consume like a voracious lioness in the wilds of Africa (sorry, babe). Another perk is that you can watch while they prepare your food, just like back home - only pride, nothin' to hide! Do yourself a favor, set that greasy burger down, back away slowly, and hightail that hiney to Gus's for some REAL food!!"},{"name":"Myers & Chang","address":"1145 Washington St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"Went for 1st time yesterday.

We probably could have ordered and eaten two more but found some self-restraint deep inside to walk away.A funny aside- while we waited in line, one of the chefs dropped an entire tray of freshly iced donuts face down on the ground.

I got the Zuni Roll, it was good. Turkey, cheese, and bacon with a super interesting (in a good way) cranberry sauce. Kinda like an upscale post-Thanksgiving sandwich. The cranberry sauce was good and not spicy, but who really wants spicy cranberries. The potato salad was actually really good.

There are no TV's (yay!) and the music and space is quiet enough to facilitate hushed conversation. The value for money is outstanding -- the seven-course tasting menu is still priced at $50, just as it was when they first opened!The only thing some people might find objectionable is the tiny dining room, which leads to being in very close, conversation-overhearing, proximity to the tables beside you. Sure, I prefer to have a little bit more privacy, but they're working with the space they have, and the food will knock your socks off and totally compensate for the lack of elbow room.

Today I got a chance to try it.The menu has a lot of great sounding items, the most interesting items were the shrimp & grits, fried green tomatoes, po boys, meatloaf, chicken & waffles, pimento cheese dip. They also have organic roasted chicken as a healthier option to the signature fried chicken.My first attempt to visit was on Monday the next week after their opening, their menu, website & Yelp says they are open Mondays but they were not on this particular Monday probably due to opening week growing pains, fair enough. So I tried again on Tuesday, I got there a few minutes after 11 and there was already a 30+ minute wait. So make sure you allow plenty of time to order and eat. They do have a takeout window on the side but it's not open yet, it's not clear if they do takeout orders at the counter, you'll likely have to wade through the sea of people blocking the entrance unless you enter via the back patio. The good thing is the dining room is quite large with many great wooden tables and chairs and even more picnic tables outside. Their hours are: Mon-Fri 11-2 and 5-9, Sat 11-9, closed Sunday.There is a small parking lot but just like 4 Rivers which is constantly packed this one was too, it was easy to find parking not far down the street and there are no meters in the surrounding blocks.The ordering process much like 4 Rivers is a cafeteria line where you tell the 1st employee your order and she writes it on a sheet which also serves as your placemat on a tray, then the next employee puts your sides on etc.The bread pudding I liked but probably too sweet for most folks, I like the krispy kreme bread pudding from 4R better, I'm not sure what this bread pudding was made from, it was not as firm as the 4 Rivers version.Many of the desserts look quite good such as the Pecan Pie and the Cherry Hand Pie.I didn't have anything as good as the 4 Rivers brisket which I believe is worth the 30 minute + wait. My favorite item was the Mac and cheese, 2nd best was the pimento dip, very rich though. I still will reserve my full judgment until I try the po boys, meatloaf and a few other items. I'm not a huge fan of chicken, so I'm not the best to judge that item. The seasoning on the chicken was good, very full of black pepper.I'm a huge fan of well made grits but these were not flavorful enough for me, they were quite creamy which is a great start a little more cheese or seasoning would make them great.They have a soda machine with unlimited refills & iced tea as well.Mr. Rivers himself was there working the line and later working the room meeting guests.Overall it seems to be a good value for the money, slightly cheaper than 4 rivers."},{"name":"Schmidt's Sausage Haus","address":"240 E Kossuth St","city":"Columbus","stars":"4","text":"The food is so-so.

I suggest you bring a book you've been meaning to read, like I did thankfully. Gotta keep that hanger at bay!They really know how to brunch here. Everything was just scrumptious! I ordered the Waffler, which is allows you to pick two waffle choices and have half of each. I highly recommend this option for people who love waffles and like to have different flavors in the same meal. I chose the Lyonnaise and the waffle of the month, which was Summer Berry. A savory and sweet combo that's hard to beat in my books! I mean just look at the picture!!Food technicalities: The waffles were crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside, just how I like them!!! The cream on the Summer Berry Waffle half was amazing and the berries tasted fresh. They give you a generous amount of ham on the Lyonnaise Waffle half, but not an overflow of sauce, which I truly appreciate. Too much sauce always quickly turns into a soggy waffle. Also, in the Lyonnaise half of my dish, I thought the arugula brought nice, subtle notes of bitterness to the mix.\\n   \\nThere is no doubt that that Waffler disappeared completely and real quick.

Go for extra cheese and a minimum of toppings; anything else will overwhelm.  The real star of the show is not above the crust but below it.  Great texture and taste.

After looking at several restaurant choices we decided to stop at Yak & Yeti. It is a Pan Asian cuisine. The ribs were a ginger barbecue and the house special fried rice had shrimp and other chopped up meat in it we had linguine tossed with onion and garlic saut√©ed mixed vegetables spicy slaw red cabbage with ginger onions and scallions. The atmosphere was booth seating and wooden tables. Lots of Asian artifacts decorated the two floors. Friendly service and waiters willing to please. We sat on the second floor with a view of discovery Island and Himalayan mountains in the backdrop. Many people scurrying about walking through Asia to discovery land  and Africa. Our dining experience was very comfortable. The food was very tasty seasoned well and spicy. I recommend this restaurant if you like spicy  foods with Ginger. So my fellow Yelpers anytime you're in animal kingdom come and check out Yak and Yeti. Make sure you come and hour early for lunch because or make  reservations because this rrestaurant gets very crowded and it's harder for walkins. Enjoy!! Oh and let me say portions are large we had lots of food to take home that evening.

But luckily, we got our dish fairly quickly so it wasn't an issue.Although they listed several Ethiopian beers on the menu, they were all out of them which was disappointing.  We ordered the combo meat/veg platter.  Overall it was quite good - I particularly loved the kitfo (which they cooked medium) and the red and yellow lentils.  There were a couple of veg dishes that were a bit too sweet for my liking and the Doro Wat had some odd spice to it that I wasn't very familiar with.

He asked, \\"what else?\\" after every word I said.  I felt like I was being interrogated.  On the online menu, no greens were listed under side, so I asked if there was any.. He asked, what size immediately and what else?  I placed my order and he said has to take my cc number.  Understandable considering it's so hard to park that they require that.  But I honesty don't trust this guy in the phone who will be taking my cc number.  I said I'll just come in and wait instead and he just hung up on me.  I can't believe that I exactly came in anyways!!! The same guy took my order when I got there.  He was still rude but was less so when I was staring at his face.

This place is quite small, I would guess 50 seats max, and 10 of those bar type seating.    The menu was small, but from what we found it changes regularly so I can see that being a repeat customer would have it's advantages!   There were 6 types of oysters available as well as a menu that could incorporate oysters or allow you to not have any oysters!  Being from Maine, I had to have the New England Clam Chowder.  It didn't disappoint.  The \\"cup\\" was a hearty portion (though a full bowl was available as well) and it didn't try to be stingy on the clams.  Delicious.  We opted to have all six types of the oysters.  1 was downright awful.  3 were very good and two were exceptional... so we ordered more of the two that were exceptional!!   The options tonight were from Maryland, Virginia and Florida.  Our waiter let us know that the options change weekly.While on the subject of the waiter (his name was Andrew), he really made the night.  He knew the menu and the restaurant.  He knew we were first timers and realizing we were having a good time, he told us about the specials they had on various days and really made us feel like he wanted us to come back.  Not because he wanted another tip, but because he knew that he was representing a product that was indeed worth coming back for.  The combination of the food and his service was more than enough to want us to come back.We didn't have desert, but since we were sitting next to the expediting area, we got to see several come out on the line.  They all seemed very visually appealing and well proportioned.    We will definitely be back.  And I hope that if you are reading this that you give this small, intimate and unassuming venue a try.

So many places we tried were closed because it was a Sunday - and I'm glad that we found this restaurant open!  I'm a VERY picky eater and was hesitant about some of the choices, but I was pleasantly surprised and happy we gave bartaco a try.  We started off with some fresh guacamole, which was tasty and not too spicy for my taste.  The chips were also fresh and warm and tasted great.I had the rice bowl with the sesame ribeye (minus the kimchi) and it was delicious.  The flavors were a great mix, and although it was a bit spicy for my taste (and the server did warn me), I'd happily order it again.  I then ordered a pork pastor taco and I wasn't happy with that at all.  It tasted more of the pineapple than the pork, and some of the pork chunks were more fatty than I'd prefer.  My husband had a total of four tacos:  sesame ribeye, duck (his favorite), fried oyster and baja fish.  He was happy with all of his choices.  For dessert we shared the Churros with chocolate sauce, and the Key Lime Pie in a jar.  The Churros were fresh, hot and tasty and the chocolate sauce was fresh and thick.  The Key Lime Pie was some of the best we've ever had.  We explained that we were new to the restaurant - and especially the way to order what you wanted - and every question we had about ingredients or flavors was met with a smile and a full explanation.  I wasn't sure which beer I wanted to try and after telling the server that I enjoyed Sweetwater 420, she suggested 2 different options that were close.

Once we did proceed to order, the food did not take too long to come out. (which was great). When the food came out the server dropped the few of the little fries that were on my plate, landed on the floor (pretty disappointing). He did however, emphasis strongly that there were no free refills on the lemonade I had ordered. I might be overreacting but I gave him a blank stare and said \\"well that doesn't matter to me, may I please have a lemonade\\"  I'm not going to pull the \\"race card\\" but after that comment I felt extremely uncomfortable.My friend found an onion type object in her drink, we immediately called the manager over who then took the object and questioned our speculations.

I'm still giving them 4 stars because I've had better there previously, and it is sort of my fault for ordering the iceberg I suppose.

Baked Zitti is pretty standard and Palm Tree Grill's version was nothing to write home about.  The sauce was tangy and sweet, the pasta was cooked well but the cheese. Oh the cheese!  It was just a clump of half melted cheese on top of the ziti.  The ravioli with sun dried tomatoes and marsala sauce was delicious.  I opted for no meat so I can't write on the actual menu item.  The marsala sauce was rich and complimented the sun dried tomatoes.  The complimentary garlic rolls come out with one's meal and were pretty good--a bit dry.  I wish they had come out with the salad.  Overall, it's a decent restaurant in an adorable city.First complaint:  They don't serve their full menu during lunch but it's not indicated on the menu.  Second complaint:  The biggest disappointment and one worthy of complaint is that they serve soda in A CAN!  I just don't understand.  I was so bothered by this that I decided to look up licensing agreements between restaurants and soda companies.  From my research, it's much more prudent to invest in a fountain machine.

I have no problem paying premium money for premium ingredients but, despite what they would lead you to believe, this isn't the case. Not only will you not find a price anywhere (until the cash register) you will have to pay 10-15 for a conventional burger alone! If you want fries, that'll cost you, if you want grass fed beef, that'll cost you, what it costs you will find out when at register. When we made it through the huge lines (which I understand they can't control) and paid $40 for two burgers, fries and a salad we were assigned a table and waited for our food to arrive. After a short while our fries came out luke warm and were completely over salted and seasoned. I guess they make a big deal about cutting there own fries, probably why you only get a small handful for $6. The salad came next and was actually the highlight of the meal. The burgers were barely warm when we got them and relatively bland. All in all I will never come back to eat average burgers and ingredients for a premium price.

That said, if you're bringing a date here to have a super awkward conversation or break up...I'd chose a different spot.  They've been good to recommend delicious wines that are inexpensive, which I always appreciate. Their pasta is also super fresh and changes seasonally.

If you like and I mean really like vegetables-- a good salad, a well crafted kale dish, freshest of the freshest local produce--THIS IS NOT YOUR PLACE.  There is no serious attention to vegetables, fruits or grains.  The food here is really rich, covered with sauces, and lots of fried options (i.e. the chicken fried egg...).  Also, the place is really loud--we could barely hear one another across the table.  And we spent our hour and a half meal sitting on stools--not the most comfortable environment.  As for the sharing food thing, we ordered 10 dishes for four people.  Most dishes afforded us one good forkful per person so I estimate that I got 10 forkfuls of food.  Since most dishes allowed one good bite and one good swipe at remaining sauce, I didn't really get to satisfy my curiosity about the innovative food combinations.  One bite of the very creative dishes and you ask:  What's in this?  YOu can't really answer because you don't really get a second bite.   So be aware that you will sample some really rich, very creative, well served foods and if you are in the mood for this type of dining experience, well, be prepared to wait and then enjoy...."},{"name":"Artemis Cafe","address":"1235 SE Division St, Ste 112","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"I love Artemis.I worked nearby and used to go everyday.

Excellent customer service, pretty good coffee & snacks, as well as a decent amount of outdoor seating. The venue is setup to cater to more of the crowd that gets coffee to go. This was evident in seeing the limited amount of interior seating (about 5-6 chairs), plus a smaller bar area that is without chairs. The barista indicated that there isn't any WiFi here, so you'll have to suck it up and use a substitute if you think that you'll get any online work done here.

I have never drank at the bar because I will never drink and drive, but I imagine that if I did it would be awesome, 6 free pool tables, video poker.... can't beat that.  Again, Although I have never drank at the bar I give that 5 stars.  The food is cheap for lunch so I did not expect it to be that great, and it never has been that great but it is for sure edible.  The crab puffs AND  egg rolls are GREAT.  With any chinese food that I have ever ordered (including PF Changs) the chicken and beef taste too soft and weird.. like dog food.  When I make it at home it is perfect, I can't imagine what they do to it, to make it so nasty.  Maybe they all buy poor quality meat.  Anyways, I asked for a cup of hot tea, I did not get it.  They are supposed to open at 11:30   i called at 11 27,for a to go order and no answer  11 30....no answer, 11:40 ...no answer,  11:45 no answer,  11:50 no answer, 11:55 they finally picked up but said the cook just showed up so it would be 20-25 min.  We decided to eat in.  Showed up 20 min later, and the food still took around 20 min to get to us.  They only have one person working she was very nice but she had to be responsible for waiting tables, serving food and serving drinks for every one at the bar.  It was not her fault for taking for ever i guess, they need to staff more people.  So, of course it took FOR EVER, to get the bill, and another FOREVER to get it paid.  My wife left long ago with the kids and I waited and waited, contemplated leaving but decided not to as that is illegal.  While waiting I used the bathroom, I may as well have peed my pants as it would have most likely been more sanitary.  The bathroom was something our of a horror movie.  The whole place was kind of dirty and run down actually, the table was sticky, If they hired more people to work the lunch shift, purchased higher quality ingredients, completely remodeled the interior, and hired an interior designer and kept the place clean... i would give it 5 stars.... just a few small changes and it would be a perfect restaurant.  Oh.... one more thing... the waitress/bar tender call everyone Hunny, or Sweety, which is fine for a bar tender at a singles bar.... but when I am trying to order and eat lunch with my wife weird pet names are unnecessary.

It was a thoroughly disappointing experience. I ordered shrimp tacos and found that the tortillas had been warmed on a steamer. As a result, the tacos were only modestly warm and moreover, I hated the fact that they were not grilled. My friends also noted the same and complained about how the tortillas were sticking to their palate. That's of course a common problem when tortillas are not heated in the right way on a flat-top.Aside from the taco's exterior which was disappointing, I also found the filling to be very bland. The edges of the taco were devoid of any filling or even any kind of spread or sour cream and given that, I ended up not finishing my entire taco. Which, as my wife can attest to, almost never happens.Finally, it should be mentioned that like other fast-food joints, one stands and orders his or her food. In other words there is no table-side service. Overall our meal was so disappointing that once it was all said and done, we had to see a therapist, in other words, go to Ben & Jerry's and get some ice cream!"},{"name":"Milestones Restaurants","address":"2425 Cambie St","city":"Vancouver","stars":"2.5","text":"We had a party of 8 people and is like one of my worst dining experience ever...first, parking is horrible, u can only claim max. of $8 for a bill that is over $40 ( parking is $4/1.5hrs)...and they do the claim by party, so even split bill won't help....we sat down for 20mins and server kept come around to rush us to order....just to shut her up, we ordered a appetizer platter to share first.....in less than 10 mins, she came again to rush us to order our entrees....and the platter wasn't even ready...so we ordered, food portion is small, didn't taste that good....since we had 2 people having their b-day in July, we requested to switch our free dessert to appetizer ...however they said is set, cannot be change...at the end when we paid, we said they had problems with the computer (bill is not clear), then had problem with the credit card machine as well....we ended up have to put more money in the meter to wait for them to get us another credit card machine......WILL NEVER GO BACK!!!"},{"name":"Amrheins","address":"80 W Broadway","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"Hands down best brunch in the boston area!

My friend had eaten there a few days before and recommended it to me. To start off, the restaurant is super cute and inviting with great decor and fun music. We sat at the bar, but the back outdoor patio looked lively and really fun with couches and lights hanging above. It also looked like a lot of people were on dates, and the atmosphere I think is really well suited for a fun date night. When we sat down, our waiter Matt was very friendly and helpful. It was cool how you put a little card up on the place holder if you need something to get a waiter's attention. Also being able to choose and check what you want on a sheet of paper was easy and different and fun. My mom ordered the margarita to start and it was yummy. Not too sweet or salty and just strong enough. For food, we tried a few tacos-- the curry shrimp, duck, fried oysters, and steak. I think our favorites were the steak and fried oysters, but truly they were all DELICIOUS. My mom doesn't like onions and one of the tacos had onions on it and Matt (without even asking) ordered a new taco without onions, which was sweet of him. The tacos are quite small though, smaller than most tacos, but reasonably priced. I would say you should order 3-4 per person. They also use corn soft tortillas which I am not usually a fan of, but they really worked. We also ordered the corn on the cob-- AMAZING. Seriously. I love corn and am critical of it, but this corn was perfectly cooked (still crunchy but soft) and was doused in queso fresco and some other yummy stuff. I would come here just for that alone. The salsa verde was also unique and fresh tasting. Overall, great night out with mom!!! And Matt was the BEST bartender!!!! Only negatives-- NO TVs. I didn't mind, but my mom was disturbed by this. Also only valet parking if that's an issue, but it was really easy."},{"name":"Scramblers","address":"567 E Livingston Ave","city":"Columbus","stars":"3.5","text":"My team and I from NCH across the street have been coming once a month before work.

The wait time wasn't too long and the ambience in the place was nothing to write home about, what can I really expect at a corner pizza spot? So I grabbed the pie and pulled out my wallet. Here comes my favorite part about this place, immediately followed by my least favorite part. The total came to less than $10, which is unheard of in a big city for a large cheese pizza. I've ordered 2 slices in New York for more than that. That was my favorite part. My least favorite part is the fact that I was not allowed to tip. I paid with a card and there was no option to leave gratuity.

But the one thing that really really bothered me was that the donut wasn't warm. With melted chocolate on top, I just had this idea in my head that the donut was going to be warm and when it wasn't, I felt incredibly let down.

All of the food was very appeasing and the Lobster Rolls in particular did not disappoint. Of course it's an Oyster Bar, so I had to give oysters a shot for my first time. I was a bit skeptical at first, but my sister and law said she'd do an oyster shooter with me so we went for it. Surprisingly, they weren't half bad, maybe because they were on a half shell?

The total at around $80 for two seemed steep though. I think there was s disconnect between the establishment itself and the price of the food. We probably paid about the same as we would pay at any place on the Cape, but since we were eating in a glorified warehouse and not a shack on the beach, I wasn't thrilled.

We were supposed to come here a week earlier but they somehow booked us for the following week. They definitely need better management. However, their food is worth the wait. I shared a Soupe √Ä L'oignon Gratinee for appetizer and it's the best French onion soup I ever tasted. For the main, I personally ordered their Canard Confit and it was delicious. The meat was tender and fell off the bone, the sauce was delicious and the use of goat cheese for the salad was just right. Not too much that it's overpowering but enough to give it a kick. I also tried their Le Steak Frites, cooked medium rare. They definitely know how to cook their steak. Their Cr√®me br√ªl√©e was good, not the best I had but definitely good. My bill came to be $30, which I think is a steal for French food with this quality. As for service, despite the wait and the reservation mix-up, the staff was friendly and efficient. I never have to ask for water to be filled, they always top it up right away. To sum up, the food and the service is 5 star, enough for me to forgive the wait.

The owner was uncommonly and genuinely friendly and polite - things you always expect from an establishment, but don't realize how rare it is until you actually come across it. Our orders have been delivered on time and the food is delicious. The crust is perfect - chewy and cooked through under the toppings (but not jaw breaking kind of chewy. Perfect kind of chewy). The toppings were all fresh and weren't sparse. The caprese salad is refreshing, made with nice, fresh produce, a healthy slab of mozzarella, and a lovely reduced balsamic glaze. The garlic knots could use a bit more garlic in my opinion, but that doesn't stop me from fighting my family for the last one. We decided to make our own creation tonight and it was amazing. Even the delivery driver said his car smelled delicious! We chose chicken, roasted garlic, artichokes, basil, mushrooms, and black olives. If the owner is reading this: that was fantastic. My little eight year old gobbled two giant slices down and wanted more. I had to cut him off, much to his disappointment. My only critiques are that the pizza is barely warm by the time it arrives (not a major travesty, but a hot pie would be preferred), and I wish there was at least one other non pork option to choose from for pizzas. A spicy turkey sausage? Very thinly sliced steak (like ribeye used for shabu shabu)? I realize perhaps that's not very NY, but hot damn those both sound good to me. Thank you for such a great pie. I foresee many more orders in our future. Some day when we leave Austin, I know you'll be one of those places I'll wish I had nearby.Edit: they seem to have fixed the delivery temperature I had experienced.

I live down the street from Render and my boyfriend and I have become regulars there. I can't say enough good things about this place! Firstly the coffee is incredible. I don't often drink coffee, but their pour-over technique really accentuates the natural flavors of each distinctive blend in a way I can't help but admire. My boyfriend likes the Gavil√°n the best, but I think the most unique coffee offered is the Ididio, which has a pleasant blueberry flavor. In response to complaints about the price of coffee, this is definitely a \\"you get what you pay for\\" situation. The quality of each cup more than justifies the price. Additionally, there is always a blend available as a special (priced at $2.50), which is a great deal. I'm a tea drinker myself, and their tea selection is great as well as reasonably priced. The baristas always make sure that the water is brewed to the optimal temperature for the specific type of tea you choose and inform you of the proper steeping time. The Finest Earl Grey and Jasmine Pearls are my favorites there and are also a steal at $2.25 a pot. All teas are priced at $2.25 and you can get as many free hot water refills as you wish. The baked goods here are also wonderful! My favorite are the scones, which come from Three Little Figs in Watertown, and the in-house-made quiches are also very good. I have not tried any of their sandwiches, but I did sample the chicken salad (which was delicious). I recommend trying to snag a seat in the back section of the coffeeshop, a pretty little glassed-in gazebo.

My most recent visit will most likely be my last. The appetizer I ordered was served with a horrible sauce that was much different from what is supposed to be included. When I questioned it, the server took it to the kitchen and more than 10 minutes later, returned with a replacement that was mostly cold. By then, of course, the food for it was mostly cold. When my burger finally arrived, it was barely warm, yet over cooked. Somehow, they managed to over cook the burger without making it hot enough to melt the cheese. The cheese was actually cold. My ketchup bottle was empty, so I asked for a new one. The server switched it with an almost empty one from the next table. Under the fries was a fair amount of ranch dressing from what I assume was a dirty plate that my food was placed on. Once my food arrived, I never saw my server again until she dropped off the check. Over the past 2-3 months, each time I've gone there, the food has been lower quality than the last. This was by far the worst.

A guy sets a tray down just behind me as the waitress puts the queso on the table. The guy tries to put a plate of food down in front of me. I kindly say no, please take that back. We haven't even eaten our appetizer yet. I ask that in 10 minutes or so they can bring out fresh meals. She goes to get a manager. I assume things are going to get better but, no. They get much worse. She says she'll comp the queso but she's bringing the food whether we want it or not. My wife says never mind. We'll pay for what's on our table. Manager says that's fine. We are upset as we've never eaten here and the salsa and queso weren't bad and the prices were pretty good. But it's been a long day and I'd rather just go hungry than deal with crap service. So then the manager brings our tab. As she said she'd taken everything off except our drinks and the app as we hadn't eaten anything else. Accompanying her are two Austin cops.

My friend ordered the chicken and waffles and I ordered Nutella waffles with strawberries and bananas. For the price I paid, the portions were definitely on the smaller side.

If you've never heard of such comments about ramen, I'm talking about \\"Hokkaido Ramen Santouka\\", which is like three blocks down from Danbo. I had the worst experience with ramen at Santouka. The reason is because I was forced to stick with their options. They couldn't customize their noodles and broth like Danbo. For myself I got the Tonkotsu Ramen 'Miso' with thin soft noodles, standard broth, no lard, and little bit of spicy sauce. The broth was flavourful but not overwhelming with salt. Noodle was just how I like it but one criticism would be the wait time.

Could be true. Pastries here are much more subtle in texture, flavor and presentation than any other patisserie. Best macaroons I have had. Chewy, hard, and cold on the inside. kept in a temperature cold case; when you bite into them fresh out of the case the coldness of the filling creates a separate sensation you don't get with a room temperature macaroon. Usually the macaroons are filled with butter cream, the same type of non melting white frosting you see in a Safeway cake. Like eating an oreo cookie; lard + sugar. On macaroon day they had a cherry blossom macaroon which was not filled w/butter cream. Highly recommend any macaroon which doesn't have the white buttercream base. The flavors are more intense and they are probably healthier for you. Croissant: best I have had including France. Not overproofed, fluffy with air pockets perfectly distributed through out the pastry. Didn't taste like they used old butter like a flat costco croissant.Lemon tart: One of the best selling cakes,  cross between a lemon filling in a lemon merengue pie and a creme brulee.

Before writing this review, I was concerned that maybe I am a bit too critical  when it comes to dining out, but then I read the other reviews which completely reflect my experience at this restaurant.\\nMy husband and I were very excited to go with a family member who has eaten at Orinoco before.  We knew there might be a wait since it was Friday night in Brookline, so we were not surprised when the hostess/slash/waitress/dishwasher quoted us 30-45 minutes.   Unfortunately, it took that entire time to get one round of drinks while we waited at the bar.  The hostess also took away my seat at the bar to sit a guest who wanted to eat (am not sure how I feel about that). Please note- the bartender never apologized for the wait on drinks, complained that he was \\"drowning\\" and did not offer any compensation. However, he did promptly present me with a bill. \\nOnce seated we order appetizers and another round.  Not completely surprising our apps came first, which was annoying and we said so to our waitress. She eventually returned with two of the three drinks and left to talk to other waiting guests. Service slightly improved from there, and they eventually put our one flan on the house (hey thanks!)\\nI would like to think the service last night was a fluke and would consider returning.  \\nThe positives: Great food and drinks once you can get one.  The (obvious) negatives: service at the bar and on the floor. The owners may want to consider moving the kitchen staff  out onto the floor since they seem to be the only ones that know what they are doing and how to please the guests."},{"name":"Thierry","address":"1059 Alberni Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4","text":"When I was still able to eat dairy a few years back, Thierry was my go to.

My boyfriend and I took a trip to Disney back in May and he proposed! We had an amazing trip and the last day of our trip we went to The Animal Kingdom and stopped off in the Yak and Yeti retail store before heading back to the bus to go home. \\n  While there, I purchased a cute pair of shorts. They didn't have a changing room to try them on so I bought the size that would most likely fit me. \\n  When we returned home, I tried them on and they were a bit too snug so I called the store and spoke with an employee who told me if I sent them back with the receipt that she would send me a larger size. She even put a pair of the right size on hold for me. So, I packaged them up, sent them with the receipt and a note detailing exactly what we had discussed and added my phone number and address so they could contact me. \\n  A month passed. Nothing. So, I called and spoke to the manager. They said they hadn't received my return in the mail but that disney was really weird about getting the mail to the right places and that he was out of the size I needed but a truck was coming in on Monday and he would send me a pair then. \\n  Another month passed, it was July now.... Still nothing. Called and spoke to the manager again and he said that they were still waiting on the truck to come with the shorts?!? Really? This seemed odd to me as most retail shops had trucks come on a regular basis and he could have added my order to the next shipment. Still, I really had my sights set on these shorts that I over paid for in the first place (Disney prices are high) $40! Told him I could wait another week and left it at that. I gave him my number (again) to contact me when the truck came in. \\n  Now it is September, the summer is over and I still haven't seen the shorts nor heard from yak and yeti so I call the store to speak to the manager. He seems confused and says 'they still haven't come yet'? Ummm... Nope, that's why I'm frustrated and at this point I'll have to wait until next summer to wear them, I just want my money back!   The reason they get two stars instead of one is because they were kind enough to refund my money and the manager( on the phone at least) seemed like he really wanted to help me. BUT... When I got off the phone and checked my bank account for the refund it turns out that he CHARGED my account the $34.08 instead of refunding the money so now I am out $64.16 for a pair of shorts that I don't have! I have called the store back to rectify this problem but somehow in the last ten minutes the manager has disappeared! I left my number for them to call me back, which they did. Told me that he initially charged my card instead of refunding it but that he did refund it twice so that it should zero out now but that it won't show up on my account for another day or two as their refunds take that time to process. This has just been an ongoing headache. The manager was very friendly and apologetic but that doesn't change all the hassle that this process has caused.   That being said, if you shop here... Make sure you know your size because unless you live close enough to come back in for an exchange, you're likely not to get one. This is not the Disney Service that I am used to and that I expected. This was the only souvenir that I purchased for myself while we were there and I'm very disappointed that we could not make the exchange as I really loved this pair of shorts. \\n  I will probably stop by next time we are in on the off chance that they have something cute but I will be sure to know what size I need this time!UPDATE: After refunding my money, the manager called me back and apologized profusely for the way things happened and insisted on sending me a new pair of shorts that were the correct size. Within the week they were at my house with a complimentary Yak and Yeti tote bag as well. They fit perfectly this time and I'm so glad that I got them because they really are a cute pair of shorts. Thank you so much for correcting your mistake and going the extra mile to make sure that I was satisfied. It really showed that you care about your customers and wanted to right your wrong."},{"name":"Clay Pit","address":"1601 Guadalupe St","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Clay Pit is housed in one of my favorite buildings in Austin.

After we finished our bland calamari and overwhelming minty cocktails, the waitress came back and once again informed us of the slow kitchen due to Groupons. She also stated our dinner would be out soon. That was an understatement. (What is the definition of soon in your book?)We waited a painful 45 mins. We were pretty annoyed that she did not come by to give us any updates throughout. She walked by us several times avoiding eye contact. We were more angry that she was not upfront with us and said it might be over an hour wait or so. Honestly, we would've been more at ease if she mention that from the beginning.We were minutes to walking out until our meals came to our table. We decided to pack it to go. When our waitress came to give us our check she apologized immensely and blamed the whole situation on Groupon. Seriously? If your establishment could not handle the Groupons then why put it on the site anyways? I still did not fully understand the whole kitchen being slow situation. FYI it was not packed at all. There were other diners who walked out for the long wait as well. Good thing we spared them the embarrassing scene those others caused! If they were so overwhelmed by Groupons I can't even imagine what it's like on a regular packed night. I'm most upset that I felt the whole time they purposely trapped us in there just to make some money.

We started with the Pisa Tower, layers of fresh tomatoes, mozarella and basil leaves, drizzled with a balsamic reduction and olive oil.  Beautiful presentation and the oil and balsamic left in the bottom of the plate was good with the garlic parmasan bread that came out first.  For my entree, I had the chicken marsala, which was some of the best I've ever eaten.  I upgraded to a cesar salad, which was my least favorite part of the meal.  The dressing was served on the side, which I've never seen before, and the croutons were a bit burnt tasting.  My husband had the deluxe calzone, which was jam-packed with meat, veggies and cheese.  He said it was \\"all right,\\" but didn't leave a crumb, so I suspect it was pretty good.  House wine was pretty standard, I think it was called Citra.

We ordered about 8 things for 4 people.. which turned out to be a decent amount.. but I'm not sure if that's because we only got one dish at a time.. and filled up on tea... or if it really did fill us up... Well, the dim sum itself wasn't bad... (I couldn't find their sesame balls on their menu to order! :( that's my fav!--assuming they make it they way I like it)... We ordered the traditional stuff, chicken feet, shrimp dumplings, pork dumplings, etc.. We opted for this place mostly because it was the busiest in the area... we had to wait about 30 minutes... so we took a stroll around and saw at least two other places... but they were definitely less busy and one even offered a discount on dim sum! Overall, I think we had a decent dim sum experience... just wish the food came out faster... and that they pushed carts so we can see what we're getting!

Barley Swine reflects that development trend.  In some ways it is sad to see such rapid bulldozing and construction in what is definitely \\"Austin Weird\\" territory, although to be honest I would not mind trading a few more mediocre Casa Garcias for places like this!    Barley Swine is next to the Horseshoe Lounge, look for that sign first otherwise you could drive past this tiny building easily.  Went on a Monday night with a friend and was able to be seated right away.  For the small space they did a good job on the inside decor.  The wait staff is very attentive.  I try to eat healthy and an conscious about meats and cheeses  (I don't refuse such delicious offerings just aware of what I eat!), but these portions are so tiny there is no worry at all you will wreck your diet here.  Just large enough for a taste and share, that's about it. So is it worth the hype?  It is a solid 4 stars no doubt.  If you don't mind paying more for better service and finer things, sure give it a try!  Luckily no wait staff told me to split after we were done - I have to agree with past reviewers that is NOT a way to treat your guests and definitely not South Austin vibe.  I don't give it 5 stars because the local beer selection was a bit disappointing actually, and only 1 Malbec to choose from for wine.  Food was great as well as the service, but you are paying a lot for what you get.

My partner got the steak and eggs which was also excellent. The steak was way better than breakfast deserves. His mom got the reuben.

It has a delicious fruity flavor that compliments the donut perfectly. I expected to love the horchata donut as i love horchata, but found myself thinking the donut was just okay. The chocolate crunch donut was a huge favorite amongst my friends. It has a cream filling in the middle and the outside is a chocolate syrup and chocolate crunch. They absolutely loved this donut. It is definitely a must try if you are a chocolate fan. The donuts are all fresh and they just melt in your mouth. However, as soon as they run out of a flavor you are out of luck until the next day. They said they typically start running out around 5PM. I purchased the Stuptown coffee with milk as well and it was delicious, and went perfectly with the donuts. It was a bit sweetened but just perfectly, not too much not too little. I really enjoyed the look of the milk carton that it came in.

The udon noodle dish had a nice spice to it.  The pork belly rolls were good, but as can be the case, my piece of meat was fattier than I would have hoped.  The untraditional scallion pancake was different (aptly described as sort of a funnel cake) but I prefer the traditional style.  The lemony shrimp dumplings had more water chestnuts than shrimp in the filling.\\nThe service was not without issue.  We were given two different drink lists which made it difficult to know what was available, and one of our folded menus was completely blank.  Our waiter seemed to get lost on several occasions and we asked for all our dishes to be cilantro free and one dish they didn't remember this request.

The wine menu is limited but there are enough good red and white wines from Spain on there - we had a nice Rioja. I loved most of the tapas we tried. Particularly good were calamari in squid ink, beef tripe and ox tail stew with chickpeas, little clams in garlic sauce, little basque sausages, and the sweatbreads. The lambchops were a bit overdone but good enough. The only tapas I did not like was the boquerones (anchovies) ..usually a favorite but was way over-seasoned here.

But there's a reason why Andiamo Ristorante continues to make restaurant lists in Austin focused on hidden culinary gems, and I finally got to experience why.Parking: this place is missing the downtown parking experience, which is a good thing. Since it's located in a plaza, you should have no problems finding a parking space.Wait: Andiamo Ristorante has a decently-sized dining area. I went on a Wednesday night, and we were seated immediately. Not sure how the weekends are, but it looks like they do take reservations.Atmosphere: you'll feel like you're eating somewhere downtown due to the white-cloth experience that you'll get. The tables are neatly arranged, and everything was clean. The interior is designed to make you feel you're at a quaint restaurant in an Italian village. It's definitely a fantastic place for a date if you're looking for a romantic touch to your meal.Drinks: I shared a bottle of Lagrein Rosato (Ros√©) with the two friends that I was with, and it was a great wine for a hot summer day. No cocktail menu, but they had a nice wine list. Our waitress was able to speak to the various wines and provided us recommendations.Food: I started off with the soup of the day, and it was incredible. My entree was the Ravioli di Aragosta, and it was also exceptional. While you only get 5 pieces of ravioli, they are decent portions. Between the bread, soup, and ravioli, my appetite was properly filled by the end of the meal.Service: exceptional service all-around. Our waitress was friendly and knowledgeable about the menu. She also offered great recommendations. She was not intrusive throughout the meal, and this seemed to fit in well with the atmosphere the place is trying to promote. She always seemed to know when to come around to refill glasses of wine or water, and this speaks to the level of attentiveness she was maintaining.Overall, this has been my best Italian experience in Austin."},{"name":"Blue Star Donuts","address":"1155 SW Morrison St, Ste 102","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Maybe I just got the wrong kind of donut, but I wasn't impressed.

Half the coffeeshop gets tied up in the early mornings to accommodate this essential Austin pastime, which is usually alright. it's a charming acquiescence rather than an obnoxious fixture, this Yoga for the Birds.I have beheld this specter before, a thousand places in this town. He is much like that bum who wears the eight overcoats with his grocery cart before him, ballcap brim turned against the sun, glowering at traffic with sightless stares: a recognized Figure. Only this Cherrywood denizen cinches up his thongs so we can see them and shuffles his booted feet as often as possible to let us know he is walking, and happy to do it. He would be an effete cowboy in a dystopian future where painting and fashion are as valued as long hair.Elites' reviews are so boring: they don't even mention the haunting figures, the specters, and they make the place.All in all - good place for a date or to try your PUA skills or otherwise to digest some blackberry pie or scarf down a burger and beer during happy hour."},{"name":"Schmidt's Sausage Haus","address":"240 E Kossuth St","city":"Columbus","stars":"4","text":"This is our \\"go to\\" place while visiting Columbus.

I was a regular at Shucks  (Tin Can replaced). The vibe/atmosphere is pretty similar.There are large tables. Shucks used to have group seating but I haven't been subjected to that at Tin Can yet. I have come in twice and here is my honest opinion -Service: The first time 4 of us stopped in around 9:40. The restaurant closes at 10 and the server wanted to make that very clear. \\"Ya nothing is a big deal because  my boss lets me get drinks next door at old blind dog if my tables stay past 10 and people make me wait\\" I have to admit, I personally felt that was an extremely unprofessional comment, and also we were spending a decent bit of money so that was quite the poor judgement on his part. He also completely forgot my order, which was solely a dozen oysters. The second visit (tonight) i arrived around 8 and the waitress was very attentive and there were no issues what so everAtmosphere: As mentioned, very similar to what shucks was. Oyster bar, some limited maybe group seating inside and some nice patio seating next to Bua.Food: I have had 2 of every oyster on the menu, the mussles one of the \\"toasties\\" - the salmon and cream sauce. The oysters were OK. no real complaints other than the brine and juice were eliminated from the oysters so that they were very small in portion and a little dry, it was hard to taste any variance in flavor. Its great for the location, but it was no Kimball house. Secondarily we ordered at the recommendation of the waitress, the toastie salmon with greek sauce and the mussels. Both had decent flavor but I have to say there was a serious lack of sauce on both. The mussels were small in portion and almost felt like there was barely enough sauce for the bread served with it. They were a bit dried out and we had to scoop the small sauce on them.Same with the \\"toastie\\". There was plenty of salmon on top, but the barely moist bread underneath left a lot of, \\"i guess i need to eat the dried salmon of the top\\".overall I expect to eat here again out of convenience, and i hope i can try some other dishes. the first night i went a friend said he enjoyed the clam chowder.

I went there with two friends for my birthday, and they paid for me, and for three people with one beer and two teas, and then meat and sides it was $77.  So keep that in mind.  We had turkey, sausage, brisket, and ribs, (not a ton), but everything was good.

The menu at Parish is a collection of creations by various chefs around town.  About a quarter of the menu is vegetarian and I'm being generous by saying a quarter.  And I do not consider vegetarian appetizers meals, they're appetizers.    After contemplating the menu for a good fifteen minutes, I ordered a particularly messy egg sandwich- minus the bacon.  The bread was surprisingly cold, the frisee was wilted which made me suspicious that the bread had once been hot and it had sat before getting to me.  But the eggs were warm and the tomatoes were red.  I won't comment on the potato salad since it's not something I have ever enjoyed or liked.  If I could go back in time, I would have had to go a day before I actually went to Parish so I could order the Paoli's Peasant Panini-- which wasn't available the day I dined.  Price wise, there are other places I'd prefer to spend my money.  I don't think paying dinner prices for a sandwich is reasonable given the quality of my meal.  One of the couples who met on their blind date outside the cafe were seated near me and agreed to have a second date.

The menu is seriously complicated, and I feel like the servers, while friendly, take the attitude that you are rather stupid if you can't figure it out. You are supposed to mark up your own menu, and the utensil they give you to do so is like a green magic marker that is well on its way to running out of ink. So you are left to puzzle over the myriad menu items and scratch out your selections in cheap colored marker. For a place that is pretty expensive, they need to upgrade the service model.

I'm surprised by the comments made by some of my favorite Yelpers here, maybe because I saw Hopdoddy in an entirely different light than they did: I never got the impression this place was trying to be God's gift to hamburgers, I got the impression Hopdoddy is trying to be SoCo's Buzz Central, and they've nailed it. If you come in here believing this is Austin's Uchi/Uchiko for burgers, I think you're going to be disappointed - try thinking of it as a deconstructed Chili's or Hut's that's been gentrified and trendified for our hip and cool SoCo district. C'mon, the bar itself is almost a third of the entire seating area here, and if you think of the burgers as a surprising food bonus, then Hopdoddy starts feeling like a really clever concept. Having a random table assigned to you by the fast and friendly servers zipping around is no different than the random table you'll get with a restaurant reservation - if you don't like it, ask them to move you. Like any other cool and hip place in Austin lately, you're going to wait one way or another for something, whether it's in the food line for your burgers, or in the bar line for your booze. Just relax and enjoy the show. Incidentally, you can get and pay for your milkshakes directly at the bar. My bartender Steven took as much care preparing my double-chocolate milkshake as he did carefully topping off the champagne in the lovely Lorena O's mimosa. I admire people who focus on the job at hand. I thought the Magic Shroom and fries were decent - perhaps the burger a tad drier and the fries more limp than I like them - but the milkshake was tasty and everything nicely overpriced, which is perfectly on par with all the other venues here in SoColand. I didn't quite get the connection between the basil pesto and the Shroom burger, but you know, I don't get why people pay $400 for sunglasses either. Hopdoddy deserves props for giving free validation if you use the huge parking garage behind them. I was here for the enchanting Monica O's Hopdoddy ROTDC, and trust me on this one - if you're sitting directly across the lovely Lorena and the enchanting Monica and the fabulous Dej M, you're going to feel giddy, and you're going to want to dance. Would this have been an inappropriate action in the middle of SoCo Hipster Central? Pfffft, I think everyone here would have gladly paid for a second show."},{"name":"Rafiki Bistro","address":"1682 Massachusetts Ave","city":"Cambridge","stars":"3.5","text":"I absolutely love Rafiki.

It's about $10 per person and one of the only \\"healthy all-you-can-eat\\" restaurants I can think of. This particular Sweet Tomatoes had a rather odd layout. I think the space was under renovations but the various food stations were rather spread out. The salad bar was at the entrance of the restaurant and it was a little difficult to make return trips (it didn't deter us) and then the soup seemed to be over in a corner. Maybe they were trying to incorporate some exercise into multiple trips to the different sections of the restaurant? The quality of the food was consistent with every other trip I've had to Sweet Tomatoes. The vegetables on the salad bar tasted very fresh and there was great variety. And I always enjoy trying the different pre-made salads they provide, particularly the Wonton Chicken Happiness salad, which makes me very happy. There was also a nice selection of soups, and I thought the Red Beans & Rice stew was the standout. And with it being an all-you-can-eat setup, you can try anything you want and not worry about whether or not you like it.

Agreeing with most of the reviews here - this place is a small little gem of a restaurant serving delicious, healthy food in a homey, warm space. My friend and I started off with the shamo numtak appetizer- a yummilicious blend of chickpeas & mushrooms stuffed in bread and then fried. Talk about explosion of flavors and textures in your mouth! Then we had  vegetarian momos and the thhen tuk nood soup.  The momos are a must!  The texture of the dough is just right and the veggies and tofu filling is  wonderfully flavored. The noodle soup was a bit disappointing, lacking in flavor. The service is great - the staff checked in on us numerous times and were extremely attentive.  Prices are also very affordable and the menu is extensive.  I'll definitely be checking out this place again to try more Tibetan dishes."},{"name":"Shan-A-Punjab","address":"500 Harvard St","city":"Brookline","stars":"4","text":"UPDATE: The day after I posted this review, the restaurant called me and offered me free food if I would take this review down. Apparently it's bad for business. Since this review is 100% true, I declined, but I can't help but wonder how many other writers of bad reviews here have accepted...I used GrubHub to place an order earlier today. I was exhausted from my non-AC'd, \\"you-must-wear-pants-and-be-nice-to-the-customers,\\" job and damn near on the verge of passing out from starvation on this 100 degree day, and I knew some chicken biryani would be exactly what I needed in order to survive this godforsaken heat. According to my GrubHub app, I placed the order at 5:20 and had an estimated delivery time of 40-50 minutes. Now, I knew that I had to leave my house at 6:30-6:45 to drop a friend off at the airport, but a 50 minute delivery time would get my food to me at 6:10. Plenty of time to eat quickly and go, even if Shan-A-Punjab had been running 10-15 minutes behind schedule.Unfortunately, at 6:30 my food STILL HADN'T ARRIVED. This, friends, is 20 minutes behind the estimated delivery mark. I was obviously getting concerned as I was both starving and being depended on to make an international flight so I called the restaurant. I explained that I had placed an order 1 HOUR AND 15 MINUTES EARLIER that STILL HADN'T ARRIVED, and that I was going to NEED to leave soon. Thankfully I'd planned to pay in cash, so I didn't have to worry about charges on my card for food I wouldn't be home to receive. Anyway, the person who answered the phone contacted the delivery driver and assured me that he would arrive within 5 minutes.Fast forward to 6:45. I don't have a choice but to start to leave my apartment. The food hasn't arrived (now 1 HOUR AND 25 MINUTES AFTER I PLACED MY ORDER, 35 MINUTES AFTER ESTIMATED DELIVERY TIME), and I very sadly and hungrily begin helping my friend bring his luggage down to the car. We literally waited as long as we could, and if we'd stayed any longer he'd be in danger of missing the flight. As I'm standing in the middle of my street (literally in the middle of my tiny, one-block, one-way street) I get a phone call from the driver saying he's outside. I explain that I'm standing in the middle of the street and don't see him, he insists that he's further up the street and can't find my building number. I'd like to re-emphasize that my street is only one block long and I was standing in the middle of the road. This man was either confused or lying, because he was not there. I stand in the middle of the road arguing with him about his location for another minute or two. He continues to insist that he's on my street. Finally, I say, \\"Okay, I'm walking to my car now. If you're not here by the time I get there, I'm leaving.\\" He starts to get upset and is trying to convince me to wait. When I get to my car, my friend suggests that if he's close we can drive to where ever he is, so I start to ask the driver for his actual location but he HANGS UP ON ME. Feeling so grateful that these people didn't have my credit card info (but, you know, still hungry) I drove away.Three minutes later, the delivery driver calls again. \\"Okay, now I'm outside,\\" he says. I'm like SIR IT'S BEEN AN HOUR AND 40 MINUTES I HAD TO LEAVE and he proceeds to try and convince me to come back. I explained several times that I was driving someone to the airport and didn't have time, but he kept trying to convince me. At one point he asks if he can just leave the food on the steps, and I think he wanted me to agree and pay by credit card - which, even if I was interested in paying for food to be left out in the open, wasn't an option. Finally, I just ended the conversation with \\"Okay, have a good evening, bye.\\"Twenty minutes later, the delivery driver calls back. He left the food on my steps and he was going to just pay for it out of his own pocket, which made me feel bad (I mean, I'm sure the guy tried his best or whatever, and it's not my intention to put working peeps out of cash like that). I thanked him but said that he didn't have to do that, especially because paying by credit was not an option for me.About ten minutes after that, someone else called to apologize, said my food had been left on my steps and would be free. I asked if the driver was going to have to pay for it out of pocket, and the person said, \\"No, we're just giving it to you for free.\\" Not sure why the driver told me he was going to have to pay for it himself. Maybe it was another attempt to get me to offer a card number.Anyway, the food was on my doorstep when I returned from the airport about 45 minutes later. It was pretty good (especially considering that I was LITERALLY STARVING by the time I got to eat it - also, free food is pretty much always good in my book) and even stayed warm throughout the whole ordeal. I'd absolutely be willing to order from here again, if only the delivery situation hadn't been such a disaster."},{"name":"Phoebe's Diner","address":"533 W Oltorf St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"Delicious diner for breakfast/brunch!

I'm going to preface this by saying that I am a vegetarian and normally would have picked literally any other cuisine.  First impressions: The neighborhood its in is cute, we parked a ways away because we were exploring and had a nice little walk down brick paths.The menu said to ask about vegetarian options - they didn't seem bad, they mostly were just replacing the meat with extra grilled peppers and onions on the sandwiches. But I wasn't very hungry so I just ordered a house salad and a side of potato pancakes with applesauce.  The salad was the typical iceberg lettuce with a few shreds of carrots and tomato that you'd expect, nothing fancy.  Potato pancakes with applesauce tasted fine, and the portion seemed like the appropriate amount for the $3 I was charged (I think it was 5 or 6 mini pancakes).The place seemed a little tourist-y and stuck in the past - one of the menu items had a note next to it saying \\"first new menu item in 25 years!\\".

SERVICE IS AWEFUL!  Was seated in the back north corner-the pink room close to the kitchen door and restrooms (as a rule never sit here or in the bar, when the restaurant is busy.  The servers are always slow to check in with you.)  Our waiter Gage, who looks extremely young, was either very busy, or very inattentive. He came to the table to tell us he would be with us in a min....    Which was like 10.   Took our drink order.   Disappears.    Brings Queso, and that took a long time to come out.  Finally flagged him down to order.  It was one hour after we sat down and Gage reappears to ask \\"did you ever get food?\\"  \\"Umm...  No\\". Meanwhile the table seated about 10 mins earlier was served but apparently never got their margaritas as the manager went to apologize to them after she apologized to us.   When the manager apologized to us, she gave excuses.  There was a similar ticket, the kitchen stamped them both completed.  Understandable.  But as someone who worked in food service, I know that just walking back and forth between tables, you realize if a table hasn't been served and you become proactive before the table becomes unhappy.   When you're like dear Gage, and you go run of to wherever for 20 min periods, then yes.  When the kitchen messes up, it's going to be magnified by the fact that you never went back there.It doesn't take 90 mins to get tacos and a quesadilla.    But we left at 10:15....   95 mins after sitting down and not drinking.

Thirty minutes into waiting, we look over to see our other two friends eating their food. So we start talking about everything under the sun until we start getting lockjaw and cottonmouth, and still no food.

I love poached eggs so I had to go with the Tagine. The chorizo sausage was spicy, oily  goodness. The Foccaccia bread was so soft and perfect for dipping into the eggs and sauce. I would've liked if the server would've asked for how I wanted my eggs poached as they came very runny. The tomato based sauce didn't totally impress me, it reminded me a bit of plain old Ragu sauce. My boyfriend's Boulettes came with much yummier sauce and a delicious side of hummus with cucumber salad which was more exciting than my side of yogurt. Although the meatballs were a little on the hard side the symphony of the sauce, side, meat and eggs was pretty dang good. The Americanos were also very delicious. Felt the pain of the HST when the bill for 2 plus tip came to $45 bucks.. not a budget brunch!The service was super attentive, timely and friendly.

We ordered a few apps, the hakka eggplant, crispy spring rolls, and tea-smoked pork spare ribs. The spring rolls tasted a bit like scotch tape (probably not a great description for a food review, but my wife thinks pepsi tastes like band aids so I guess it's just a family thing) Anyway, I am a meat eater, I usually shy away from most things vegetable, but the hakka eggplant was so amazing that I was dreaming about it while I was eating it. In fact, I wanted to leave the restaurant so that I could come back and order it again. It was that good. It was one of those things that you didn't think could possibly be as good as it was. My brother ordered the tea-smoked pork spare ribs, I tried to wrestle him out of that and to get the pork belly buns or the dumplings, but he put up a good fight and boy was he right. We ordered another order to go.  If you just had those two things, there would be no more need for any more restaurants. Then other food starting coming to the table. Our waitress was wonderful she told us we would by happier if we ordered family style and shared instead of just getting our own items. (very right she was) and she warned us that the food would come out when it was ready and that was fine by us, and it did. Every time we took a bite of something, another dish appeared, it was magical.The restaurant is small, clean and worthy of every dollar we spent. Next to arrive was baby bok choy (yum), tiger's tears (grilled skirt steak, thai basil, lime, khao koor) big yum, and two sandwiches: grilled homemade 5-spice tofu (very good, but nothing I would order again) and a crispy pork belly sandwich (very good, but nothing to write home about), the sandwiches are served with these yummy pork rind like potato chip things that were great. Rooster sauce on the side was a must. Also, we had some kind of pickle plate that was filled with great things like hot peppers, kim chi, some slaw kind of thing and some sliced Asian pickles, all extremely good. There was a side slaw that came with the sandwiches that was not extremely attractive, but was absolutely fantastic. It looked like a pile of dry slaw, but underneath was a wonderful sauce that made it an excellent accoutrement. We had lots of sodas that come with fantastically twirled straws that made me very happy, the choice of Asian teas was wonderful and served in a wonderful iron tea pot, we finished the meal with French pressed coffee, and that was just wonderful too. There's just a whole lot of wonderful under this roof. I'm done.

I've been here three times now, once for dinner and twice for lunch. It's a little tiny place, maybe 7 tables (deuces) and the sushi bar which seats 4 I think. The sushi here is very meticuliously made, fresh ingredients and tasty!  The rolls I usually order are negitoro, bc, spicy chopped scallop and sometimes negihamachi. All very good, the spicy scallop is excellent, juicy scallops and mixed with hot sauce, some places I've been to just use a squirt bottle and squirt the sauce on top...not here. The bc roll is also very good, the salmon skin is actually crispy, again some places use too much salmon and not enough skin so it's not very crispy. For nigiri I usually order hamachi, amaebi, ikura, tobiko and toro, it's all good very fresh and delicately made. The service is very friendly as well. The price is very reasonable for the quality you get. My only gripe (which is why it doesn't get 5 stars)is that during lunch anyways, there's only one sushi chef working and the food takes quite a while to come out.

Honestly, it looked like any other buffet, just with bigger sausage selection.  You know... Mac 'N Cheese, beans, salad, mashed potatoes...  The basic Ponderosa line-up.  It was all pretty bland, but not bad.  They are known for the Bahama Mama Sausage, which is definitely worth trying.  I'd order it with a meal over the buffet though.  The sausages at the buffet were a bit dried out from sitting in the warmer for an extended period of time.  Also, save room for their famous Cream Puff.  It's not just hype from national exposure, it's the real deal.The service was pretty good, nothing to complain about really.  However, I think the staff is working around a difficult environment.  For example, the ceiling was leaking behind the bar and plumbing seemed to be an existing problem.  The staff seemed like a dripping ceiling was just another day at the office.

What a shame!Let me preface my review by saying that my husband and I have been so looking forward to eating here.  We're westerners, but have heard of the Locke Ober legacy as far that way as New Mexico.  Unfortunately for us we chose to go during restaurant week.  The place is cool--beautiful, old, ornate.  The cocktails at the bar were spot-on.  The menu looked fantastic.  But it all started downhill when I asked the waiter his opinion on what I should order based on my preferences.  He looked dumbstruck and when I followed up with, \\"Have you tried any of these?\\" he admitted he had not.  So he told us what everyone else seemed to be ordering.  Our appetizers--calamari and the risotto with peas and ribs--were split.  The calamari was HORRID.  My husband said he'd had better at Olive Garden.  It was so overly cooked it hurt to chew and literally broke like hard candy in your mouth--yuck!  My ribs and risotto were better, but nothing to write home about.  Then the entrees came.  Now, it should be noted that our items came in record time.  I mean, literally within a couple minutes of our ordering them.  A little disconcerting to say the least.  But back to the entrees... I ordered the spare ribs, my husband the chicken.  The chicken itself was of medium-grade quality, at best.  It was meant to have a rub, but only tasted of the grill it was cooked on.  Totally Applebee's worthy, I hate to say.  My ribs were better, but still uninspired, to say the least.  The saving grace of the meal was the dessert, but how hard is it to screw up lemon sorbet and vanilla ice cream?  The saddest part of the meal was that it tasted and felt like restaurant week was a vacation for the kitchen and waitstaff.Restaurant week should be an opportunity for an establishment to show new customers why they should become regulars.  Not to show customers why they should avoid restaurant week.  With the atmosphere and decor, Locke Ober could have been something special, but the food made it feel like a Furr's Cafeteria.  My husband and I would love to go back, order off the regular menu and give it another shot, but now we don't know if risking $250+ of our hard earned dollars will be worth it or not.  Besides, I feel a great restaurant should be a great restaurant.  Regardless of whether it's restaurant week or not."},{"name":"Soprano's Ristorante Pizzeria","address":"3990 Curry Ford Rd","city":"Orlando","stars":"3","text":"Horrible customer service! We tried to order a pizza with shrimp as a topping, which is listed as an available option. On their website it is specified that this is a double charge item. Their medium pizzas say that the toppings are $1.75, so this should mean that shrimp is $3.50. They told us that they charge $1.00 per shrimp and then asked us how many we wanted. WHAT? You mean I need to try to figure out how many shrimp, size unknown, that a 14\\" pizza should have? 8, 10, 12? Going with 8 this means you want $23.95 for 8? small pieces of pizza. That's pretty presumptuous in a town with a ton of pizza joints. We placed the order on hold.Unfortunately we could not get a hold of my mom, who was supposed to pick up the pizza. She got to the place and paid for the pizza before she checked her phone. After learning about them being ridiculous about shrimp she cancelled her order to get a refund. The owner literally YELLED at my mom at the restaurant in front of customers. Who does that? They yelled about the quality of their food, how great their shrimp was, how she was inept and didn't know anything about the cost of food, and how their pizza was cheaper then even Papa John's. I have no idea why that last came up in conversation.So what I understand now is that if you want cheap quality pizza then go here, but make sure you are prepared to be treated like an awful person and belittled by the chef.Oh, and please don't ask to add shrimp on your pizza.

It's located in a particularly busy square with many other popular restaurants around. Conclusion: rush hour = no parking! We showed up at 12:30 PM and it was busy. We took a few minutes to find parking. The parking lot is huge, so you will always catch the odd car leaving. The restaurant itself was packed. By that time, most tables were mid-meal. We waited another 15 minutes for a table. We ordered a congee, a noodle soup and a stir fried noodle. The stir fried noodle was served in about 10 minutes. 30 minutes later... the congee was still missing. The congee was for my colleague's young daughter, and she was hungry. So, we asked a server why the congee was taking so long. We ordered congee for her so she wouldn't have to wait very long for her food. Most places have the congee cooked and ready in a large pot. The server explained that they make their congee from scratch. She then made a nasty comment about how we should \\"do the right thing as adults\\". I'm assuming she meant that we should try to share our food with my colleague's daughter. Duh... we did. She wants her congee. I had the noodle soup with BBQ meat and Sui Kao. It was OK. On top of everything, our tea cups were never refilled. They really go to extra lengths to avoid eye contact with customers. The only way to get their attention is to yell.

I had been absolutely dying to try Orinoco, especially because La Casa de Pedro is good but I don't love their entrees. We have good family friends from Venezuela and although I have only been there once, my mother has been there a number of times. We were excited to try potentially find a new place for Venezuelan food!My mother, father, and I went for dinner on a Friday night around 8pm. We were greeted right away by the hostess (always a good sign). The place was packed, but we were really excited to eat there so we decided to wait. Luckily a table for 3 opened up in about 15 minutes. I did notice there was only one bartender who looked extremely stressed out, she was calling rapidly for others to come under the bar. We were seated about 3 booths removed from the door and every time the door opened you were frozen. I felt bad for the tables closer to the door because we had to eat with our coats over our shoulders. This made my mother miserable. The waitress was extremely friendly and knowledgeable but it seemed like she was one of 3 waitstaff there. Our drinks took an insanely long time but our food was out relatively quickly. For apps we got the tequenos (our absolute favorite thing) and the Verde empanada which said it came with \\"3 salsalitas\\" and a salad in the middle. The tequenos were WAY over cooked and they were covered in ketchup. The menu says they are \\"served with\\" ketchup but not that it is dumped all over it. My father does not like ketchup at all and it was kind of disappointing. The ones at La Casa de Pedro are much better. The empanada was good and so was the salad but there was no salsa or anything accompanying them? I didn't ask. So far into the meal, our experience had not been very good, because our apps were ok, we were freezing, and our drinks were taking forever. Our entrees though were absolutely delicious. I had a steak special that was amazing and very decently priced. It was cooked perfectly and topped with Venezuelan cheese and greens. My mother had the Pollo Adobo and my father had the Empanada Machada, which we agreed was better than the Verde.  The chicken dish was also very, very good.  On the suggestions of numerous other Yelp reviews, I ordered the yuca that comes with the mojo sauce (it says on the menu).  I even mentioned to our waitress that I was excited to try the sauce.  When a different server brough the yuca by itself and started to walk away I asked \\"Doesn't it come with mojo sauce?\\"  He said \\"Oh yea I can bring you some if you want.\\"  Of course I want it! It says it on the menu!At the end of the meal, we asked for Venezuelan coffee (that is on the menu) and we were told they didn't have any. The substitute coffee was practically undrinkable. For dessert we shared the Torta Fluida. It is described as a molten chocolate cake but it is more of a warm, chocolate liquid with really no substance. It was still good, but not what I was expecting.

Everything about the place makes it look like a quality establishment, but the food is just... bleh. On my first visit, I had an Italian Combo on Ciabatta. What it tasted like was a bologna sandwich on really good bread. In fact, the bread was the only good thing about the meal. Even the chips at this place are bland and lacking in salt. The second trip I decided to try something completely different and had the French Onion Soup. What a mistake! What I was served was a barely passable onion soup filled with some sort of shredded cheese that didn't melt (Parmesan? I don't know; it was mostly just salty. Unlike their chips) and a bunch of croutons that tasted like they were out of a bag from the grocery store. Again, the only good thing about the meal was the bread. My daughter had a pasta she liked (something Alfredo? I can't remember), but the chicken on top of it looked like it was from a can, and she admitted that that part wasn't very good. Really, at the prices they charge, why can't they produce decent food? It's appalling. Two stars because the cupcake my daughter got as a 99 cent bonus -- a triple chocolate piece of heaven -- was delicious. Otherwise this would have been a one-star review."},{"name":"Koji Osakaya","address":"1000 SW Broadway, Ste 110","city":"Portland","stars":"3","text":"Wow, I was surprised at how bad this Koji was considering that we liked the other locations.

I think Shigezo, around the corner, is the best bet for this part of town.  I stress think since my first experience was \\"incomplete\\".

Just awful.My family suggested we all eat at Whiskey's this past weekend before the Frozen Fenway games and I tried to sway their choice because I knew what I was in for.I've been to Whiskey's a few times over the years and have had horrible service and mediocre food (at best) each and every time. This time was probably the worst though (hence the review). I was late meeting up with my parents, aunt, uncle and cousins. We had two separate tables. I sat down with my cousins and it was very hard to track down a waiter. My cousins had ordered before I arrived so they were expecting their food any minute. We then noticed a table that had opened up near our parents so we asked if we could move which seemed to cause a major problem. Apparently when we moved, we switched waiters who did not communicate at all together. I finally got my order in and my food arrived literally one minute later so I'm pretty sure I got someone else's order or everything was so pre-made that it took 30 seconds to prepare it (gross). I had received my meal way before my cousins did and i had ordered about half an hour after them. When we approached our waitress about this, she had a very rude attitude and said that we needed to make sure that we paid for what we ordered. Ummm...ok, but we didn't even get our food yet?? My cousins waited another 15 minutes and their food still didn't arrive so we questioned the waitress again. This time she said and I quote, \\"This isn't my responsibility. You ordered it over there so your waiter from that table is responsible for your food,\\" and walked away. How nice. What she could have said was, \\"I'm not sure what the issue is but I'm very sorry and I will go find out what the hold up is. Thanks for your patience.\\" We never heard a sorry or anything besides a bitchy attitude. Finally my cousins food came out and they said it was cold. Unacceptable. Also, the food was disgusting. I get that they were busy but YOU ARE A BAR ON BOYLSTON STREET and they had to know that not only was there a Bruins game on TV but the Frozen Fenway games were that weekend. You need to learn to adapt. You also need to learn what customer service is. I hope to never step foot in Whiskey's again.

I say all that to say this the grits I had at this place was freaking amazing.  I had the burger and grits.  Never had that combo before but damn these mofos made my day.

So while headed to Mexico with a ridiculous 5 hour layover in ATL my colleagues (Korean and Mexican) didn't want fast food or expensive prepackaged sandwiches. To be honest we only ate at this place because it wasn't crowded.  This creole inspired place has changed my opinion of airport food. My burger was cooked perfectly and the bun was light and airy.  My colleagues had a blackened fish sandwich on the same type of bun.   (I don't speak Korean however two thumbs up is universal). I'm assuming they enjoyed because both plates where cleaned.

The rest of the group ordered burgers, 2 of the guys ordered the Big burger and they werent impressed, they both said the burger was bland and not a big fan of the swiss Foam. the RBQ burger was pretty good, The kid  grilled cheese was pretty good looking too.

I added the zeros and the signatures to both receipts- so I know for a fact there was nothing additional added, and my total was correct.

But not much  of an apology of reasoning for why/how it happened.  Not looking for  a freebie or handout- just a recognition of error....

These are not your simple donuts with basic frosting; these are some mad creations that just work made inside a chic modern interior that looks out into downtown Portland.  I had to choose three on my first visit since I couldn't decide.  Luckily I got their early enough to see all of their flavors, but I chose their passion fruit with cocoa, blueberry bourbon, and raspberry rosemary.  Good s$@t the passion fruit tasted like biting into the real fruit with the smallest hint of spice showing up on the end.  It simply was difficult to hold myself back and not shovel the whole thing into my mouth.  The blueberry bourbon was a delightful refresher and the raspberry rosemary was a surprisingly good marriage, but the passion fruit knocked it out of the park for me.

I am a fan of the famous Gourdough's food trailer and when my friends from out of town visited this weekend I knew we all had to try the new Gourdough's restaurant.  We went for breakfast around 11:30 on Sunday and had no trouble parking. The interior is all dark wood but the windows provide plenty of light. There were a surprising number of families with small children there, but be warned they only have a couple of high chairs available. Our waitress was friendly, helpful, and as fast with the drinks as she could be given the bar was a little slow with only one guy to crank out excellent $3 cranberry mimosas. We took advantage of the breakfast specials, a great a deal and a huge amount of tasty food. The New Jack City had a Gourdough's donut topped with a potato pancake, a perfectly cooked egg over easy, strips of bacon, gravy and grape jelly on the side. We also tried the equally great Petunia, which is the same as above except pulled pork is thrown in the mix. The Ron Burgundy (the burger with donuts as buns) was excellent as well - meat was not over cooked and the donuts were not greasy.You are not doing your body any favors by going to Gourdough's Public House, but if the idea of eating a burger on a donut bun sounds awesomely bad in a good way, then I'm confident you will enjoy your meal here. Somehow all these incredibly rich ingredients come together to make your mouth and mind happy.

Sadly I was unaware of both when I was walking down 21st on a lazy Sunday (6/3/12) looking for a place to grab a bite to eat.  Due to the combined indecisiveness of my girlfriend and me, I decided stop by Starbucks to get a cup of tea suppress my appetite.  Not a moment later we came across Anna's Banannas which I was stoked to find was still serving eggs after 2pm.  Despite their misspelled name and a dingy menu seemingly void of any standout combinations we decided to give it a try.  We ordered some eggs with sausage, a half sandwich, and a Rio bowl (total $13.90 + $2 tip), all while I held a Starbucks cup of tea in my hand (apparently contraband).  We found a seat on the front porch which was void of any patrons and lacked much foot traffic being pretty much the end of the line for 21st street.  After settling in to read the paper and chat with the girlfriend the guy who took our order appeared to ask if we wanted our order for here or to go. I said for here (because who orders eggs to go??). The following dialog ensued:\\n \\nWorst Server Ever (WSE): \\"Oh and by the way, you can't have a Starbucks cup out here\\"Me (taken aback): \\"Oh, I'm sorry. Can I have a different cup to put it in?\\"WSE (incredulous): \\"You want to me to put STARBUCKS in one of my cups?! No. I'm not going to do that.\\"  \\n \\nHe then retreated through the door back behind the counter.  Dumbfounded, I confirmed that the experience was abnormal with my girlfriend and decide to confront the matter and follow him in.\\n \\nMe: \\"I'm a bit confused; can we come inside and sit with my drink?\\"WSE: \\"Hey man; we are just a small independent business.  I can't have you advertising other people's products in here\\"Me: \\"I'm sorry for bringing this in but I just bought it and it is only tea.  I'm not going to be wasteful.  I can either put it in one of your cups or I need to cancel my order\\"WSE: \\"How about getting it To Go?\\"Me: \\"No, that wouldn't work.  We are on foot and live a mile away.\\"WSE: no response\\n \\nWe requested a refund, and then were rudely confronted by two customers (obviously regulars) as well, saying we ought to know better than to bring Starbucks in and that all businesses have the same rules.  I offer the contrary and wish them luck on staying open with such poor service, and take my $16 and Starbucks cup down to the Laughing Planet cafe where they happily take my order and let me - and the Starbucks cup I still have in my hand - eat on their crowded deck. By the end if all we were quite delighted with the rudeness of the server since our food at Laughing Planet was excellent, and the servers were nothing but pleasant.\\n \\nUpon looking at Anna Bannana's website I happened to see their motto is \\"friends don't let friends drink at Starbucks\\" and can almost see where they were coming from (besides the fact that that was my first time in the establishment so it is a stretch to say we were friends), and second of all being rude to newcomers is no way to make friends. There is a way to communicate your intolerance for Starbucks (consider posting a sign, perhaps?) that does not involve alienating your customers by being outright rude.

The curry sauce had a sour tang to it that absolutely turned my stomach. I couldn't place the spice, but every salty and sour bite Made me feel a little ill. The fish was perfectly cooked and fresh but was barely edible in the sauce. I love high spice and was ok with the spiciness of the dish, but my boyfriend couldnt choke it down, and he also found the sauce harsh and sour. Our stomachs were further turned by the discovery of a hair in the rice. Yuck.

That's a lot better than having the food on a greasy, salty, I'm-gonna-get-a-heart-attack side. Now, I'm not sure if the food itself is healthy, but it just tastes more healthy than your normal Chinese food.They do have their greasy menu items, but even the greasy dishes taste healthier than the similar dishes at other Chinese places.My only complaint about this place is that it is on the pricey side.

Additionally, the menu options felt limited for vegetarians, and I was very shocked to see that two eggs cost $8.

And sooo happy to have found it here in Thierry. Thanks to my coworker who brought in treats to share for her birthday last week (also lovely of her to be so giving on a day normally reserved for reception). She introduced me to the wonderful selection of macaroons (which were also delightful), but it was the pastries - one in particular -  that drew me. I'm not a big pastry person but another coworker and I were intrigued by what we later ascertained to be the apple tart, so I was finally convinced to have a little taste....and you know that moment when Cupid's arrow shoots you through the heart? Yep, it was like that, except he must have started at my tongue. Mmmm!That infatuation drew me here early on a rainy holiday Monday morning. I barely glanced at the other equally impressive choices both on display and on the menu. I did however order my usual soy chai latte for accompaniment. Another point of cheer: they presented my tea latte with coffee art. While this may not seem like a big deal to some, I must admit that I've always been a little secretly envious of caffeinated  beverages which are more often fancifully presented. I also note that there is an awesome heated patio, which I may move out to soon...

And my grandfather wondered who got to keep all that change in the fountain. Ha!Being new to this place, I immediately noticed the streamlined look the interior has. A light blue/gray paint covers the walls, with a dark gray bead board chair rail around the entire room. They have large stencil letters saying things like \\"opa,\\" and \\"olives.\\" The wording was a bit strange.We had a party of 6 and even though only 4 of us were there, we got seated anyway. Our server was a very chipper, thorough and efficient woman. I never got her name. Our drinks came out immediately. When the rest of our party arrived, she came right over to take drink orders again and for refills.We ordered a large Greek salad for everyone to share. Me and the hubs ordered a medium pizza, one half with the Greek special (gyro meat) and one half with the ham special (ham, pineapple and white sauce). Another couple ordered a small pizza with pepperoni and mushroom and another couple ordered a large with the veggie special and the ham special.Our salad was crisp and fresh. Our server honored our wishes and served onions on the side and with extra Greek dressing. I filled my plate with crisp lettuce, fresh tomatoes, onions, peppers and olives, then drowned it in dressing. It was refreshing.And the pizza! Wow! I immediately became partial to the ham special because the white sauce was so good. The pineapple was juicy and paired well with the ham slices. Oh my Lawd! I practically skipped the Greek side and dove right into the other half. I was surprised at good the pizza was considering their specialty is Greek food. Throughout the entire meal our drinks were constantly being refilled, extra napkins were delivered, plates were being removed and condiments were brought. After we ate, we got to-go boxes and sat around and talked. And talked some more. Then talked some more for good measure. You know how it gets with family when you catch-up, you just end up talking forever. Despite our long visit, we never felt rushed.

The last three items were decent, though the edamame was undercooked and the miso soup was nothing special. The other three rolls were disgusting- and I do not say that lightly. There was nothing that looked liked a scallop- it was just white, tough fake fish. The fish that was used in the spicy rolls was stringy and gross. The rolls themselves were constructed badly, but I don't even care about that; the fish was just absolutely inedible. All I can hope at this point is that I don't get sick.

Some of my friends were vegetarian, so that was a major consideration, and most of my friends are pretty cheap as another deal breaker. Plenty of places have a few vegetarian options, and your vegetarian friends will probably politely eat them, and not complain, but they may not be jazzed about the experience. As a good host, I think this: would I seriously consider eating this vegetarian entree instead of one with meat? or would I ignore it entirely, because it sounds awful?That is my metric for whether a food joint is good for vegetarians, and I am sticking to it. Being in the Back Bay limited our options, but Parish Cafe was close by enough to deliver good food for all to enjoy. They specialize in sandwiches at higher than normal, but not outrageous prices, and the sandwiches are pretty darn good.I got a meatloaf sandwich, accompanied with mashed potato. The mashed potato was good, not great, and the meatloaf was tasty. I wish that the portion size were bigger, but you can also rarely satisfy me on portion size short of an all you can eat buffet. Others with me had smaller appetites, so one girl filled up on her fried eggplant sandwich, and I finished it off for her.

My party of three ended up ordering fried pickles and green tomatoes for appetizers, a 2-piece white combo (breast and wing) with coleslaw and beans on the side, and a 3-piece dark combo (two thighs and a drumstick) with Mac and cheese and potato salad on the side. I got the dark meat for myself, and man oh man I'm not even joking when I said my eyes rolled to the back of my head when I bit into that thigh. Every bite was crispy and juicy, the epitome of a perfectly fried chicken. My boyfriend said he has never seen me as happy as I was while eating that chicken -- that should speak for itself. The white meat my boyfriend ordered was alright, a bit dry as expected and definitely not as delicious as my dark meat.As for the sides, the fried pickles and green tomatoes were delicious, though I wish they sliced up the pickles instead of cutting them the long way. The way it was cut made it hard to take even bites and I ended up just accidentally pulling the pickle out of the breaded coating. The Mac and cheese and coleslaw were good, but the beans and potato salad were just average. Not really important though; with fried chicken like that, I'd be content with mediocre sides any day."},{"name":"Andiamo Ristorante","address":"2521 Rutland Dr, Ste 325","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"When rating on the food alone, this place gets 5 stars. That said, the decor is very dated and the service isn't perfect. Their competitors are everywhere and have aesthetic environments that feel more with the times. This place feels like it used to be a flooring showroom that was taken over by someone who is passionate about creating true Italian food. So, you have a mixed environment. Most guests were on the elderly side but they clearly love a forgotten gem of Austin. I wish they would move to another location and update the aesthetic. If they did, I would be all in.

I've experienced better. I guess we should have known things were amiss by looking at the empty dining room at 6:30PM and Princess Parking *right up front*. Our server was very attentive, too attentive even. He tried to upsell EVERYTHING. We had to tell him \\"no thanks\\" about 19 times, and this was before we attempted to order. Once someone curtly tells you \\"no\\" for the 3rd time...do you realllly wanna keep pushing crap on them? Red Robin does. We had two burgers, the Whisky River BBQ and the Bacon Cheeseburger, with Bleu cheese. While the burgers themselves were juicy and cooked as we asked, it appeared they came from a box and that's just disappointing. At least buy the preformed patties that LOOK like hand pressed burgers!The burgers were pretty thin and didn't hit the edge of the bun on all sides. The last time I went to Red Robin (albeit 5 years ago) I didn't remember this being an issue. Like I said, they were alright...but when you advertise yourself as a burger joint and push the burgers...I think they should be badass and not just \\"ok\\". The fries. Blah. We ordered the \\"Parmesan Garlic\\" fries and were charged something like .79 cents. What we got were normal fries with a barely visible amount of parmesan and no visible garlic. I smelled it, I guess they were using garlic powder or something. Not really worth .79 cents. The biggest disappointment is the price, over $35 bucks for barely decent food. We could have went to Frans and got some excellent onion rings and a better burger for $12.00, so I don't really see the point of Red Robin.

Please read this if you have allergies.First, let me state that I have allergies - just not to wheat, cheese, most ranch dressings or tomato. And as such I ordered accordingly. I'd never heard of this place until tonight when it showed up on Eat24 as an option. Looking at the menu, it seemed like a great idea. I had just been complaining to a friend that it was hard for me to order delivery because there was often just one item at a place I could eat. I could get a drink at one place, a side salad at another, and entree at another.. which with minimum orders made delivery a hassle for me.So when I saw this place had Maine Root soda (one of the few soda brands I can drink, even though I can only drink a couple of their flavors), actual lettuce in their salads (not spring mix), and fresh basil as a pizza topping.. I thought I'd found heaven.So I ordered. And it came. I was expecting the soda to be in bottles, not realizing it was a fountain at the store. Ok, sure.. I can deal. Also I received no silverware, napkins, not even a straw. Evidently this is company policy unless you request it. A straw though seems like a no-brainer when you're delivering a cup with lid with straw hole.I ordered two sodas, got one. Not happy. But to add insult to injury, when I took a sip of my soda.. it wasn't the rootbeer I ordered. It was something else. Tasted like Dr Pepper or Cherry Pepsi. Which FREAKED ME OUT.. mostly because I wasn't aware Maine Root had that flavor, and I'm terribly reactive to corn syrup (imagine all the skin on the bottom of your foot peeling off within 24 hours). So I called. Got the manager. I asked about the soda. He said it must be doppleganger flavor or something? And confirmed it was Maine Root. He didn't seem that concerned that the order was wrong.  Then I mentioned allergies.. mostly because I wanted him to realize how serious the WRONG soda could be. I immediately regretted mentioning allergies. He freaked out. Like super freaked out. Wanted to know what I was allergic to (like he'd even have a clue, and my allergy list is too extensive to even list here, let alone recite on the phone)... and then saw I ordered a wheat pizza... and told me quite seriously that I should have ordered the Gluten-Free.Dude.. Don't assume you know what I'm allergic to. I'm NOT allergic to wheat. I am however allergic to almost everything that is gluten-free.From then on he barely listened to me. Instead he ranted aimlessly about their quality ingredients and what was in things that I didn't even ask about.  He went on a whole rampage about dairy being in things.. and eggs... Neither of them were concerns I had. He completely made them up in his head somewhere. I'd get two words out and he'd interrupt me. I asked about the \\"meal\\" on the bottom of the pizza.. \\"Is it semolina or co...\\" Interrupted me to tell me it was \\"Semolina.. it's a corn meal type of...\\"  In which I interrupted him, \\"Ok. Is it semolina or is it corn meal?\\" \\"Semolina\\" and just to confirm because I wanted to make absolutely certain.. \\"So semolina from wheat right?\\" \\"Yes semolina it's like corn meal\\"*headdesk*  I believe its' actually semolina as I'm not sick like a dog right now. But I didn't each much either because I still wasn't sure it wasn't corn.But he went on another verbal vomit about the pizza crust.. that it was unbleached, unbromated flour.  Which I decided to confirm \\"From wheat, yes?\\" and he replied \\"No, its' not wheat.\\" This went on for a while and finally ended with \\"Yes flour is wheat\\" like all flour everywhere was from wheat.*headdesk* Dude, you guys have GF pizza. How can you say \\"Flour = Wheat\\"?  From this conversation alone, I would caution anyone with a true medical condition that needs GF, to not order pizza here. I'd be scared for your colon.

Convenience would be by using the drive-thru service, which is known to be a bit slower than your typical drive- thru.The restaurant has a few options on the menu but I'm here for the beef. For just about $10.95 (before taxes), you get a meal consisting of large beef, fries, and large drink. If you want just a standalone small sandwich, it's $6.75 (before taxes). So, for a few bucks more, you get unsalted fries, and a beverage that is 75% full of ice. In my experience here tonight, it was pleasant eating my large beef, cooked medium well. Unpleasant eating the unsalted fries because I like some salt on them. If I saved $4, and just got the sandwich, I would then have extra money to buy a dessert across the street at the other restaurants. As for the exterior, the parking is scarce on a busy day. At this time of the day, I see 4 open parking spots. For a tip: if you like salt on your fries, don't forget to ask for some. The staff ask you, but just in case, remember to ask.

The classic tonkostu here is flavored with shoyu , so I would opt out for the shio broth with an egg and cloud ear mushrooms. Definitely stick to the standard broth with lard, or else you'll end up like me, regretting getting the light broth and not being fully satisfied. I also recommend getting extra firm for the thin noodles if you like al dente noodles. I ordered firm and they were still pretty soft after a few minutes in the soup.

The restaurant is very small, and you can see the authenticity when you walk into it. I waited about 35-40mins, which - I have been told by locals there - is very unsual. Usually people dont wait more than 10-15minutes. But honestly, it was all worth it.I had the classic, with thin noodles (cause they were out of the tick ones) I choose standard for everything except the broth, I asked for strong. Love the fact that you can customize everything. But I am the kind of customer that prefers to let them decide what for me which way is the best to enjoy their food. I am glad I did. It was the best ramen I had. I also had a side of gyoza, they were very tasty. That plus the ramen, I was full before I finished everything. It costed me $14 total.

But the burger (bacon double cheese) looked and felt small.  They might have misheard me or something, as they put mayo in.  The meat was still gristle-free, thank goodness, but I might be alone in wanting my burger seasoned.  I know - nobody does it, and I shouldn't punish SnS.  Would you eat a pork chop unseasoned?

Had it not been a cold January day, there would surely have been people sitting. The general street atmosphere of buoyancy, friendliness, and good health was so infectious that I began asking directions of people just for the fun of getting in on some talk.\\"This is the North End of 1959, and due to the artificial seclusion engendered by the elevated central artery of I-93, remained that way into the 90s.  I remember going to the North End back in the day and it being teeming with Italian immigrants who didn't speak a word of English.  They would be out on their stoops or in front of the cafes or just standing on street corners nattering away about whatever amongst themselves.  It always felt like such a real community where the neighbors knew about and cared for each other.Shortly before the Big Dig was finished, this rapidly started to change.  As it became easier and easier to get from Haymarket and Fanueil Hall to the North End, real estate started booming.  Property brokers caught on that this was prime real estate--kitty corner to the financial district and the seat of government, and utterly charming to boot.  The first people to start creeping in who weren't Old World immigrants were the gays (I partied with some of them on their tiny balconies in the late 90s), and the gentrification of the North End increased exponentially from there.The North End still has a lot of charm.  The windy, cobbled streets, jumble of architectural styles and bevy of pretty historical sites make this 1/3 square mile of land a real pleasure to traverse.  Coupled with the host of wonderful eateries and regular festivals, it's always a great stop on the tourist trail or night out.  But the sense of community that used to elevate this little piece of Boston to a truly unique urban enclave is rapidly dissipating.  I think this area will retain it's inherent allure--no one would be so foolish as to repeat the mistake of tearing down vibrant area like they did the West End.  But the days of immigrants flocking to the densely  populated, central city of Boston to make a new life are long gone, and the North End will increasingly find itself with an anonymous population of wealthy urbanites and the children of wealthy suburbanites."},{"name":"Comella's","address":"33 Main St","city":"Concord","stars":"2.5","text":"We're a little short on take out in Concord, so I was happy to see the opening of Comella's- I'd been to a few other locations.

I always feel like I am paying too much for something that I can make at home for half the price. That being said, Bukhara does have a few solid dishes and sides that I would recommend: the chicken tiki masala, samosas, naan is ok, puri is excellent. The complimentary sauces are good and add some needed flavor to some of the dishes. The vegi thali is what I ordered recently that comes with two different vegi dishes, puri, samosa, desert and tea. I received my dish promptly but had to ask one waiter twice and another waiter once before I finally received my tea. One of the vegi dishes with the chickpeas and potatoes tasted a little sour. We then ordered desert that was described as khulfi and was to have almonds and pistachios. Instead we got an oddly shaped vanilla ice cream with whip cream. There were no nuts and this is not the khulfi that I am use to. Have you ever tried ice cream that has melted and then is refrozen and has and odd grainy taste? That's what it tasted like. And no nuts either. When I asked the waiter if this was in fact what we ordered he sort of ignored me and then came back with a menu. I showed him what I ordered on the menu and he said that was what he brought. He didn't have an answer as to why it was different and walked away. Every restaurant has its bad days and bad waiters.

Beef was supposed to be filet mignon but it was very chewy and greasy. Lamb was horrible and mostly fat. Taking into consideration that lamb is fatty, that would be our mistake not theirs.

It was the first day of Restaurant Week, and I had been invited by my good friend Catherine T. to join her for brunch at Gusto Italian Kitchen & Wine Bar. I had never heard of it, and had certainly never known it offered a brunch. And truth be told, I was excited to see what sort of brunch options were available outside my tunneled vision that kept me tethered to downtown venues alone for my most sacred of meals.Catherine had made reservations at 11:00 AM, and we were right on time. We were seated indoors, and probably halfway through the meal, we thought we should have requested we dine al fresco on their cute patio. It was just as well, however, as the temperature was creeping up on us and--since I burn to a crisp with even minimal sun exposure--I try and stave off the march towards skin cancer every chance I get. Indoors was comfortable and just as pleasant. Course 1: Cocktails. Catherine went for the classic mimosa, and I started with the \\"Venezia Sangria\\" (Fresh Squeezed Juices & Fruits with White Vermouth & Prosecco ). It was an extremely sweet drink, one of those ones it would be hard to pound, even at brunch. Still, it was tasty. Course 2: Entrees. I really wanted to try their version of Eggs Benedict (Eggs Gusto), but I'd had so much of that lately I thought I'd try something different. Instead, I selected the The \\"Italian Job\\" Fritatta (Open Faced Omelette with Italian Sausage, Mozzarella, Goat Cheese, Red Peppers, Red Onion, & Oregano and served with Mixed Greens dressed in a Red Wine Vinaigrette). As a side note, if I recall, \\"The Italian Job\\" was a movie. I saw it exactly once, and the only thing I even remember about it was that I was supposed to buy a Mini Cooper. Product placement, FTW. Catherine ordered the Smoked Salmon Crepe (Savory Crepe with Ricotta and Spinach topped with Smoked Salmon and served with Mixed Greens dressed in a Red Wine Vinaigrette). I was slightly disappointed in the frittata. It wasn't terrible by any means, but as a whole it was dry and unremarkable; the only exceptions were the bites that included a very flavorful goat cheese. It was also not very filling; I could have probably eaten two servings and still had room for more. I noticed Catherine's smoked salmon that sat atop her crepes, and by noticed I meant I could not get over how RED it was. Even in the photo, I automatically think they look more like strawberries than smoked fish. I found out the salmon on the crepe was beet cured and the reason for its bright pink color; Gusto uses a steelhead salmon also known as steelhead trout for their cured salmon. According to them, it is sustainable, less expensive and tastier.  In any event, Catherine said she found the crepes to be passable. The atmosphere is interesting. Large stencils of Italian-related people and places grace every wall, although it took us some time to figure out what they were. I explained to Catherine that the people riding the scooter were Gregory Peck and Audrey Hepburn from \\"Roman Holiday\\". There was man leaning back in a chair that we both agreed looked like Jack Nicholson. It probably wasn't, as I can't seem to link him to anything Italian, but that's what we referred to it as from then on. You'll also see a plethora of Mona Lisa heads encircling the entire restaurant. So many in fact, that I couldn't help but mutter \\"Well, looks like someone really liked their Mona Lisa stencil\\". Maybe it was my delivery, or the fact that there really were a crap ton of Mona Lisa heads everywhere, but from then on my comment had given Catherine a case of the giggles.  Course 3: Dessert. Without any hesitation, we both knew we were craving the Olive Oil Cake (Orange Olive Oil Cake with Honey Syrup and Mascarpone Cream). My taste buds enjoyed the citrus in both the cake and the mascarpone. Catherine did point out that it was a tad dry in places, especially those that did not absorb the honey syrup drizzled on top. Still, this was easily stronger than the entree.The service at Gusto was just fine. The place didn't start really picking up until around noon, so we had a considerable amount of undivided attention for the majority of our meal. Catherine and I are in agreement on our final assessment. If someone were to ask if they should try Gusto, we'd say yes, but don't hold any wild expectations. It was smack dab in the middle of any rating scale. Keep in mind, I know nothing of their lunch or dinner selections, so I can make no claims or comparisons about their Italian cuisine. That I can try at a later date. As for brunch? I think there's a reason I gravitate to downtown. And as usual, the company was what really made this brunch experience the most memorable. 3 Stars."},{"name":"FLIP burger boutique","address":"1587 Howell Mill Rd","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"My first review of FLIP was completely favorable, but possible premature. I went back for a second visit for lunch today, and my experience was not nearly as positive (although this time I DID have the company of a fun lunch date).We arrived around noon, just beating a huge hour-long rush of people. Although we were seated quickly (at the bar), the food took a while to come out. Our burgers took about 15 minutes, and the post-meal milkshake took another 15-20 minutes. It seems that one person is dedicated to making milkshakes on one machine, which is apparently not sufficient.The food was also not as impressive; the bun was too hard to squish, and grease dripped all over my fingers as I took my first bite. Not good. The Burnt Marshmallow milkshake was not exactly what I expected, either; it was merely a chocolate milkshake with crisped marshmallows on top, I'm not giving up on FLIP yet--I'm sure they're still getting their act together...I'm just not as crazy about it as I was last week."},{"name":"Myers & Chang","address":"1145 Washington St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"Our most recent visit to Myers & Chang was just okay.

The couple next to us got the same thing with tofu which I didn't see on the menu but would definitely ask about as we would have gotten both items.\\n-The drinks: my hubs and I both turned some of their standard \\"mocktails\\" into cocktails- I added vodka to cucumber lemonade and it was sweet and refreshing- my husband added tequila to another previously non-alcoholic bevi and enjoyed that.

The main restaurant is closed for remodeling so only the takeout area is open now. Think a whole bunch of styrofoam: cups, plates (take out containers exactly), probably even forks and spoons if they could be made from styrofoam (paper). First thing I do is check the menu and ask \\"do you any chitlins?\\" They say no and everyone almost saw a grown man cry. Ok, after my mini depression I ask about the catfish (see previous review). No, not that either. They ask the cook, no all out for today as well. This place is not doing well for my mental health... Next try whiting, yes they have it. They flash fry it, it was done before I finished ordering for my whole family. Fish normally takes at least 5 minutes to cook...I try to get my son some fried chicken, sorry only 1 leg left and we can't cook any more 2 hours before close. Okay......Cornbread still the best, whiting was perfect, and my daughter devoured the pot roast. Chicken (thigh) was pretty good, cabbage was better than the greans, and tea was extra sweet like I like it.

We sat at the bar rather than at a table.  The bartender was a relatively pleasant man about 60 years old or so in a red T-shirt.  We decided to share the barbaqued lamb and sausage combo and an Italian cheese and onion pizza.  The pizzas are all one size and are sort of in between medium and large in size.  The lamb and sausage came out first, and was impressive, especially the lamb.  It's perfectly cooked and has a great natural flavor.  I added a touch of salt, but it's really perfectly fine as is.  The sausage is spicy and salty, and also good, but it lacks the wow factor of the lamb.  The plate is accompanied with hot peppers and bread, which is good for soaking up the excess juices.The pizza came next, and it features a corn meal bottom crust and cheese and toppings below the tomato sauce.  The tomato sauce is chunky and tangy, and probably the best part of the pizza.  The cheese is also good, as well as the crust, although I'm not much of a fan of the corn meal bottom.  The pizza is good, but not mind blowing.  It's actually more the barbaqued lamb which makes this place stand out, besides the atmosphere and tradition.The price is pretty good.  We were able to get 3 beers, a pizza, and a barbaqued lamb and sausage combo for $30.  We ended up tipping the bartender $10, which certainly perked him up.  I'd definitely come back, although it probably won't be too often since I'm seldom in East Boston.

However, the main draw - the paella - was overly salted to the point of being inedible. I very rarely send a dish back, as food is of course a matter of taste, however this time it was very obvious that this was not how the dish was supposed to taste. That alone would have earned this establishment a 3 or 4 star rating, since I did enjoy much of the rest of our meal. However, what really made things worse was getting the check and seeing that we were charged for the \\"portion\\" of our dish that we had \\"eaten\\" already (almost all of which had merely been relocated from the skillet to our plates).

The rice to avocado ratio was spot on and I really liked it (even though it is the type of food I would usually whine about how I could make it at home).While I was halfway through with the avocado maki, my tuna tidbits came out. The presentation was pretty appealing (I guess I didn't expect much from lunch specials) and came with six pieces of spicy tuna roll and three pieces of tuna sashimi on rice. I loved the spicy tuna roll because it was actually spicy (I deplore false advertisement) and there was tempura (or something crunchy in it) that gave it a pleasant texture. The filling to rice ratio was also good... my only minor complaint is that perhaps the roll should have been cut into eight pieces instead of six. I have a big mouth, but I could barely fit the entire piece in my mouth (I probably looked wickedly unattractive, like a chipmunk with its mouth full). I wouldn't recommend biting pieces of sushi rolls because you risk everything falling apart... so you just have to eat the piece in one bite. Even though I had to stuff my mouth six times, it was worth it. The sashimi was cut in a generous portion and laid neatly on top of rice. The service I had today was excellent. The servers were kind and prompt. I also dropped one of my chopsticks at one point, and a server came over and gave me new chopsticks without me even asking. When they gave me the bill, they thanked me and seemed sincere about it even though I only bought $12 worth of food.You don't need a psychic or Arnold Schwarzenegger to predict: I'LL BE BACK!"},{"name":"Signal Station Pizza","address":"8302 N Lombard St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Yum!

They called it bread but to me, it seemed more like thin soggy crepes. It tasted sour---definitely not the kind of flavor I'd look for when it comes to eating \\"bread.\\" They gave you a whole platter of this \\"bread,\\" though I must say, they do give you more bread than filling to eat with the bread. Some of vegetables on the platter was pretty good. The Salmon was my ultimate favorite though but just like the \\"bread,\\" everything tasted sour. I don't know if \\"sour\\" is a main component within Ethiopian cusines but it definitely was here at the Desta Resturant. We also ordered this Ethiopian soup that reminded me of Chili. It looked a lot like chili but definitely did no taste anything like it. The spices was too much for my taste buds to handle and just like everything else that we ate, it was sour as welll. \\nRegardless of everything, you do eat with your hands here which makes the experience more fun and authentic. \\nWhere as for the enviroment, it was VERY cramped.

Also, burrito was strangely spicy. Lastly, there are bums and weird people hanging out outside. What I do like: Burritos are very yummy. All the ingredients seem very fresh and are individually good. The steak, the guac, the rice, all are yummy. Together, they are delish. I think the steak at Chipotle is of better quality than the steak at Moe's (2nd best) and Willy's (3rd). I thought the staff was nice and friendly too. Also, sour cream is a free add on."},{"name":"White Coconut Thai Restaurant","address":"211 Middlesex Tpke","city":"Burlington","stars":"4","text":"I absolutely love this place!

Thanks goodness we did this because this place can have quite the wait.  We were notified via text our table was ready.  We had already looked over the menu so after a few questions were answered off to the buffet we went.  The applesauce is to die for!  Every piece of sausage, brat, meatloaf etc. was delish!  Our ice tea classes were refilled promptly the whole time and we were constantly checked on which we truly appreciated.  When it came time for dessert...we just couldn't decide.  We went with 2 items to eat there and one to go.  The cream puff of the month, pistachio,  was amazing.  The pie was amazing as well.  We finally dove into the peanut butter cream puff before heading home the next day and it was to die for.  We were shocked at the price!

Our friends ordered the $80 lobster, and it was huge and dinosaur-y looking. The loved it, which is what matters. I ordered grilled cheese and clam chowder, because #1: I'm poor, and cannot afford an $80 lobster, and #2: I wasn't that hungry. The chowder was fishy, and the grilled cheese was okay for two pieces of bread with some cheese in between.

Yet, when I walked in the door and said I was here to \\"meet a group of girls,\\" I was oddly flabbergasted when the host politely walked me to the right circle table. How did he know?!!Two of the girls came here for the gluten-free pizza dough and I take it their bacon pizzas were enjoyable from the fact that they ate mostly all of it and took the rest home, while I got the regular Italian Job pizza that was very good-- I liked the crust the most, which was dusted a bit with flour and baked. Because of the white sangria and polenta fries (let me emphasize: very large fries) I was pretty stuffed. I was expecting the polenta fries to be awesome but unfortunately, I thought they were just okay, maybe with more of a kick I would have enjoyed them more. I'd like to return to try the brussel sprouts and maybe an actual entree, but the saltimbocca that a friend got looked pretty scrumptious. With Apothecary nearby I'm not sure if it would win in a head to head for preferred happy hour, but the prices are very cheap at half off antipasti! Our waiter was gratefully polite, promptly brought out another water and replaced it while I wasn't looking (whoa!), and the service was very good. I wouldn't say I'm a fan yet, but i do think it's better than the 3-star A-OK so I rounded up. Nothing that really blew my mind, but I'd like to return and give another review for food.

After hearing good things and an amazing picture of the roasted lamb shank on Yelp (thank you whoever it was!), we decided to try Phara's first. The outside is pretty modest, aside from Phara's in large letters across the top. The parking lot is pretty small, but they have complimentary valet that could make your life easier. You can see a peek of the restaurant through the window, but you really don't get the full effect of it until you open the door! The dining area is dim but lit with starlights across the ceiling and is decorated with several pictures and posters! It's super quaint but don't make my mistake.... The patio is the way to go!!It's absolutely beautiful out there and full of character. They have several tent/booths, what look like group rooms, and a little stage in the center. They have live music, belly dancing and all that good stuff!The service is great! The restaurant is BYOB and they brought us out a bucket with ice for our beers quickly before they took our orders. We had someone with dietary restrictions in our group and they gladly went back to check the ingredients for what he ordered. They also were generous enough to let us move to the patio once we finished our meal. The food is delicious! But the restaurant itself is the standout here. My beef was a little dry but the la zeez garlic habanero sauce was on point. The hummus is definitely delicious and worth ordering. The roasted lamb shank was realllly tastey.

Upon entering the decor reminded me of a musty dungeon with out of date wood walls and cave-like darkness. The carpets were old and heavily stained (especially in high traffic areas). The floor was uneven in hidden spots which almost caused me to fall a couple of times when heading to the washroom, etc. Despite the dark and out dated decor, there were quite a few people in there eating and the wait staff looked very ragged and flustered by this. Needless to say, it didn't go over well with my dinner partner that we ended up waiting over 15 minutes for them to even bring us tea and ask us what we'd like to drink. Things got worse and we contemplated leaving when we ended up having to practically shout at a waitress rushing by so we could have our order taken.Not surprisingly, for the rest of the meal the service we received was rude and sloppy. The food was ok (just barely OK) as I found the broth to be flavourless and there was hardly any meat in either soup that was ordered (chicken ball for me and brisket for my boyfriend). I would not recommend this place to anyone.

Okay so we ordered a lot of food, but it was simply delicious...grilled razor clams with scallion-shrimp butter, watercress, grapefruit (2 orders of them and we all agreed that it was the best dish of the night...the grapefruit added a sweet but fresh taste to the already VERY fresh clams); woodbury clams with black beans sake, housemade black bean sauce (clams were fresh but the sauce was lacking in flavor); mama chang's pork and chive dumplings (delicious!); braised pork belly buns with bao, brandy hoisin and house pickle (pork belly was so tender and the sauce was spicy and sweet...divine); asian-braised soft tacos with pear, radish, chili-sesame salsa (these were good but the pork belly buns were better...the tacos were wrapped in corn tortillas as opposed to flour tortillas which I happen to prefer, so that was another reason that I did not love them); tamarind glazed cod with vietnamese jicama, mint, grapefruit salad (cod was EXTREMELY fresh and it was a nice big piece of fish); chicken and waffles with a ginger-sesame waffle, hot + sweet sauce (we did not initially order this dish but after seeing the table next to us get it we needed to have it. Glad we got it, the waffle was fluffy yet crunchy on the outside and the fried chicken was perfectly fried to a golden crisp and very moist meat underneath the fried coating); genmai fried rice which is brown rice, with toasted garlic, greens, beans, sesame, nori, farm egg on top (you mix the egg into the rice and it if you like spicy foods this is a great)!

The only reason for the 4-stars, rather than 5-stars, is the price is a little higher than I'd expect for the quality and quantity of food served.

She was very sweet and told us a table would be ready in a few minutes, we were amazed as this place was really poppin' and I was thinking we would have to wait for a while at the bar or something.We had a on the wall in the way back but none of us minded at all. I loved how I had a great view of the kitchen, I love being able to spy on the line and watch the kitchen pros in action.  It looked like a very smooth operation and the folks back their appeared calm and like they were having a good time.  If I were to work in a kitchen I would want to work in Coast's.Our server was really energetic, almost too much it seemed. I don't know if she was on a six pack of Red Bull or on some speed, but she was competent and pleasant to deal with.  The guys had their glasses of decanted wine and really enjoyed them, while i had a Rickard's White, which is a damn tasty beer that I never had. I LOVE CANADA!!We decided on each gettin the seafood platter as we were in the mood for seafood and it looked like a decent assortment.  The Copper River Salmon was perfectly cooked and moist. This fish has enough taste in it where it doesn't need any extra seasoning, I'm not a huge fan of cooked salmon, but this was excellent. The halibut was good but I've had better at a few other places. The tiger shrimp from Vietnam was very tasty, but c'mon you only get one??? It's not that huge of a shrimp, that sorta bummed me out.   The king crab meat was prepared tempura style and was MF'ing tasty as hell and I wished that there were maybe 5 more pieces of that.  What really exploded with taste was the gnocchi with some mushrooms (Chantrelle maybe?). The gnocchi were fluffy and dense at the same time, a real delicious treat.  The tomato gastrique that pooled on the platter was a sort of afterthought and didn't really add to anything, the steamed tomatoes were very fresh and exploded in your mouth though.One thing my friend Garret A. noticed is that there appeared to be no one over the age of 40 or with graying hair in the place and it was pretty packed.  Definitely a young high profile crowd. I don't think I've seen as attractive a group of staff or customers anywhere, not even LA or NYC!!So, yeah this definitely was the best restaurant that I dined at in my 4 days in Canada, I would love to come visit again.

I figured I would order a burger but once I saw they had a stout on draft, I knew a breakfast sandwich was exactly what I should pair it with. For once, my beer was more than my food, but worth every penny. I had a Ska Ten Pin which was listed as a stout (tastes very similar to a milk stout) but I believe is actually a porter. (Beer knurd! We looked it up it was so good). Anyway, the beer was fantastic, and my breakfast sandwich hit the spot. They were out of croissant so I had multi-grain bread, and thus was reminded of why I don't eat bread: it's like crack! The bread was buttered on the outside and grilled up like grilled cheese with a fried egg inside and loads of bacon. Ahhh.  Patio was large and they had live music that was pleasant - but loud enough that it prevented easy conversation. If that is what you are looking for, come earlier or just sit inside. Cherrywood Coffeehouse has everything: DAILY happy hour from 3-7, and all day on Tues, and most of Sunday (hello $3.50 Ten Pin!), open late, unusual beers, breakfast at all times, brunch, homemade pies (I couldn't stop drooling), daily dinner specials, wifi, free yoga (?!), dog-friendly patio, a comedy night, live music, and so on!! Meets every need. BTW, I could not get that sandwich off my mind; I went back the very next morning to snag another (to-go) with avocado added. For the record, that add-on was only .46 cents (suck on that Chipotle!)Edit: Have been back twice recently to get that damn sandwich and beer again. Also tried the a la cart veggie taco = a portable tasty salad!"},{"name":"Typhoon Asian Fusion Bistro","address":"10 N Sandusky Rd","city":"Delaware","stars":"4","text":"This is a new bistro, possibly under new management in the heart of downtown Delaware.  They have only been open for 3 days as of this review, so I'm keeping that in mind while writing this.  We came in on a Thursday evening and were seated right away, no wait.  First thing we noticed was the atmosphere. A nice clean and cozy environment with a nice full bar and sushi bar. An intimate atmosphere and not too loud, as I said, we were there midweek and not too late.  There was an overall feeling of newness, just mainly organization issues and streamlining orders and expediting, but nothing unexpected due to the recent grand opening a few days earlier.  Now onto the food. A very nice selection but not too much on the menu to overwhelm customers, the menu focused on the sushi and maki rolls, but had many other traditional Chinese restaurant-type meals as well as some Asian curry dishes and hibachi plates.  We ordered the seaweed salad and spring rolls as appetizers, both came out quickly and were delicious. The spring rolls were crispy and delicate and not at all greasy.  The dipping sauce was so amazing, it was a sweet plum chile glaze and I wanted more!  The seaweed salad was plated very nicely on a bed of greens and was seasoned perfectly.For our entrees, I ordered the Vietnamese summer rolls and the Sushi Rock maki roll.  The summer rolls were light, fresh and delicious, and were drizzled with the plum chile glaze which was a nice surprise!  They were very accommodating with my dairy allergy, even substituting sweet potato for the cream cheese within my maki roll.  The tempura shrimp in my roll was divine, lightly battered and again, not at all greasy.  My husband ordered the Harvest roll, which was topped with avocado, strawberry glaze and mango sauce, which worked well with the contents of the roll.  He also ordered a simple spicy tuna roll, which was a decent size for a simple maki roll, generous with tuna, and not too much rice.To be honest, our visit had it's highs and lows...the service and atmosphere when we first arrived was a 4, but as the evening progressed, due to some errors when they took our order and the constant wandering of expediters trying to figure what order went with what table, our rating probably dropped to a 2, along with the long wait for our entrees.  All of which, could very well have been first week jitters, and was all remedied in the end by the friendly staff, owner, and Chef.  We left happy, and our palates were satisfied by the original and vibrant flavors.  That, and the excellent service we received, is why we give this new bistro 4 stars and expect to return once the novelty settles."},{"name":"Medina Cafe","address":"780 Richards Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4","text":"ÁæéÂë≥„Åó„ÅÑ„Åó„ÄÅÂÆöÂì°„Åï„Çì„ÇÇ„Éï„É¨„É≥„Éâ„É™„ÉºÔøΩ?„Åß„ÇÇ„ÄÅÊñôÁêÜ„Åå„Åè„Çã„ÅÆ„ÅåÈÅÖ„ÅÑ!Âπ≥Êó•„ÅØ„ÄÅ„Åù„Çì„Å™„Å´‰∫∫„ÇÇÂ§ö„Åè„Å™„Åè„Å¶„ÄÅÂÖ•„Çå„ÇãÔºÅÂúüÊó•„ÅØ‰∏¶„Å∞„Å™„ÅÑ„Å®Ë°å„Åë„Å™„ÅÑ„Åø„Åü„ÅÑ„Å†„ÅëÔøΩ?..ÔøΩ?,2017-11-09 06:14:19\\n9gOBmODi5-XQ0EbIxkx2MQ,Leaky Roof,1538 SW Jefferson St,OR,Portland,97201,45.5174282,-122.69021570000001,4.0,284,1,Pubs"},{"name":"Pattycake Bakery","address":"3009 N High St","city":"Columbus","stars":"4.5","text":"Terrible customer service - staff members are both condescending and listless.

By the end, I was really upset that Christopher's patio seating was filled because it would have been much cheaper and much better.For an app, we ordered the fried pickle spears. these were pretty delicious though I wish the cornmeal coating was thicker and held on better especially when dipping into the sauce. It was nice to get the briny burst of the pickle. But for $9 we got about two pickles worth. Come on! It was way too little for the cost. Also, I started eating the watercress garnish (so I could taste the sauce without consuming the precious few pickle spears) only to discover many small dead bugs on it. Many. Smooshed into the leaves. Uuuughhhhhhhhhh. I get that it was garnish, but seriously, gross. Even if I wasn't supposed to eat it, it was still touching the other food!I got a south of the border burger. The fries were pretty delicious and crisply fried, but there was another problem of portion size. They are potatoes. There is no reason to skimp on potatoes. The burger, on the other hand, was thoroughly unenjoyable. The guacamole was underseasoned, the pico was thin and not chunky, and the \\"queso fresco\\" was tasteless, grainy, and wet. The best part of the cheese was that there wasn't too much of it to make everything even more strange and wet. But the whole burger was wet and not in a delicious juicy way. It was wet in a steamed way with no char or grill marks or brown crust or any Maillard at all. The burger meat seemed as if it were steamed because it was so wet and grey on the outside. And on the inside. The bottom bun disintegrated so much that I had to use a fork and knife. I guess the good thing about the burger is that it was large? But I would have rather had a smaller and significantly cheaper burger from Burger King which does a much better job of exposing their patties to flame and flavor. Or just gotten a fancy burger at Christopher's with more taste for 75% of the price.It would have been 2-2.5 stars for the overpriced pickle spears, but then they had to go and make me eat bugs."},{"name":"Blue Star Donuts","address":"1155 SW Morrison St, Ste 102","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Worth the hype.

I've been here twice and can honestly say my experience has been top notch both times.  The first time I was there on a date and we really enjoyed our food and customer service.  I ordered the Lamb Burger and was hooked.  I especially love the combination of the feta, marinated veggies, and pickled red onions.  That gave it more flavor...it was a sweet and tangy combination of flavors.  \\n \\nThe second time I came with my best friend and I ordered the Bison Burger and a Strawberry/Watermelon Mohito, which they have taken off the menu and should definitely return. It was one of the most refreshing cocktails I've had and with the Summer heat it definitely cools you down.  The waitress was super cool and had great things to say about the bartender, which lead me to believe that their is a cool working environment.  The Bison Burger was especially delicious...It came with bacon and egg on top.  I was delighted to know that I could get the egg fried instead of sunnyside up because it kept my sandwich from getting soggy.

It was rainy on Saturday, if you recall, and my hair really hates the rain.  I was lucky to find plush little washcloths in the Park Plaza hotel bathroom adjacent to the restaurant.  After reducing the frizz factor to a tolerable level, I proceeded to explore this hotel.  It seemed to strive for charm, with glitzy chandeliers, a cocktail lounge and some strange shops (Persian rug vendor, costume jewelry, etc.).  The restaurant had a strip club vibe, which seemed to clash with the attempting-to-be-classy hotel.  The stuffy upholstered chairs didn't really fit with their motif.  Service: Everyone was nice, but overly attentive.  For the period after they had served us our appetizers, we had three members of the waitstaff standing within 5 feet of our table, watching us eat.  Also, every time a bus boy or a server walked by, they would acknowledge us with a nod or a \\"hello.\\"  It was very friendly, but I would have appreciated a bit of privacy.  Sometimes it's nice to be ignored so that I can enjoy my dinner mate and my food for a few minutes.Food: Definitely the high point of the experience was the food (as it should be).  The bread basket had toasty cornbread biscuits with chunks of kernels, and they were served with a scented butter that doubled my LDLs.  I got the nachos with lump crab meat, black beans, and avocado crema.  Between that and a few nibbles of his skirt steak taco, we were pretty much full by the time the entrees showed up.  The skirt steak taco was so flavorful, and was well complemented by a lightly dressed salad.  I stupidly ordered halibut at a Latin steak house, but I was so tempted by the blue potato pancake, dandelion greens, and stone fruit that accompanied it that I could not resist.  He ordered the 1lb Kobe beef burger, which was served with Parmesan garlic fries.  I don't recognize a greater being, but this burger made me reconsider my atheism, ever so briefly.  It was so juicy, served with cheddar, bacon, onions, and a toasted bun.  I looked absolutely vulgar cramming that thing in my mouth, time after time (ummm... verging into inappropriate territory).  I think we both ate a quarter of the burger and did not touch the fries.  We're still working on both the halibut and the remainder of the fries ( the burger offered a delicious brunch on Sunday).  That burger- oh man.  That burger is worth the M.I.I pretty much can't not order dessert when out to dinner, and, for the first time, I should have refrained.  I chose the brown sugar cheesecake with peach crisp.  The cheesecake was... rubbery?  Whatever, who cares?

He was disgusted that I would not eat his undercooked food (not wanting to get sick), he made it sound like it was my fault for ordering the dish which was a menu item. Never once was I offered something different or a refund. I then asked for the contact info of the owner and the staff would not give me any information. They said the owner would not do anything about it nor would they care.

This is the first time I am trying Gourdoughs. ¬†Gourdoughs Public House is a restaurant in South Austin that serves sandwiches, salads, entrees, burgers, and donuts of course. They're famous for incorporating a donut into your order.  Looking at the menu, I was overwhelmed and wanted to try everything on the menu. They also had a full bar and had a separate menu for the drinks.  The vibe at Gourdoughs was really chill.  They were playing some music and had a basketball game going.  The outside is dog-friendly and they have water bowls you can use to keep your dog hydrated.  I went inside and there were a full bar and plenty of room to sit.  If you are planning on bringing a big party, I recommend you call them in advance so they can accommodate you.  I thought it would have been busy because SXSW was on at the time.  You can bring people who are under 21 until i believe 9pm.After a few minutes of looking, I saw the server bring out food for the table behind us. ¬†The one that caught my attention was the Country Clucker. The Country Clucker was a mountain that was layered with a fried chicken breast, mash potatoes, cream of corn and candied jalapenos. Cutting into the sandwich, you can hear the crunch of the chicken breast. ¬†My mouth watered and couldn't wait to try it. My first bite was amazing! I had a little bit of the donut, chicken breast, and the cream of corn. Everything went well together. The sweetness and fluffy dough of the donut went well with the crunchy chicken breast. The cream of corn help put everything together with its creamy sauce. ¬†The chicken breast was fried to perfection and it was not dry at all. It was moist, fluffy, and easy to cut through. The Country Clucker came with kettle chips that were freshly made. I would have preferred fries but the kettle chips were not bad. Everything was seasoned well and not one thing overpowered the other. Next time I go to Gourdoughs, I will try an actual burger. ¬†The Ron Burgundy caught my attention and I look forward to the next Gourdough around. (Sorry I had to do it).I ordered the Peached vodka ginger mule and it was refreshing and delicious. ¬†It was a warm day in Austin. We were sitting outside and the sun was hitting on us directly. ¬†The moment the drink caught my attention. I knew that was what I was going to order. When I finally received my drink. ¬†I was sweating and wanted to down the whole drink. I composed myself and enjoyed my first sip. The drink had a good balance between the peach vodka and the ginger beer. ¬†The first sip was refreshing with the peach flavor and on the backend, you get that slight bite of the ginger beer. If it wasn't for the price, I would have ordered another one.Overall, I enjoyed Gourdoughs. ¬†The items I ordered did not WOW me but the food was still delicious and enjoyable. ¬†I recommend this place to any tourist visiting Austin because it is a little different than a traditional burger spot and the proportions are good. ¬†Almost at the end of my Country Clucker, I was getting really full but I was at the point of no return and finished it.  I cannot wait to visit here again and try something new."},{"name":"Bugatti's Beaverton/Cedar Hills","address":"2905 SW Cedar Hills Blvd","city":"Beaverton","stars":"3","text":"Open ceiling and kitchen environment.

They're location is somewhat off the beaten path (in my opinion) but they have a phenomenal patio and a very nice serving staff. I have been here countless times and I have never had a bad experience. I was quite skeptical on my first time here. My friend said Ethiopian food was very stewy and weird. Boy was she ever wrong!Note: Ethiopian food is traditionally eaten without utensils so don't be alarmed. They have forks. Just ask. But if you want the full experience, do as the Addis Ababians do. Forgo the fork and use that bread! I recommend trying the fish tibs, asking them to make it spicy and layering it on top of shiro (chickpea pur√©e). The injera that accompanies most meals is definitely an acquired taste but if you like sourdough bread, the taste will be familiar. It's great for sopping up all those juices and morsels of deliciousness. As an appetizer I recommend the foul.

I got a really good lamb burger and my friend who joined me got a cuban pork belly burger. Both of these met the high expectations I had set for myself upon entering the place. Although this place has been open only 14 days it sure had a decent crowd. I plan to go back soon with a group of friends and try out their milkshakes (which looked real good) and a few more of their burgers.

The server places it on those metal pizza holder things in the middle of our table.  You know... the ones that keep it up off the table so it can be \\"out of the way\\"?  Well, it wasn't so \\"out of the way\\" apparently because when my 6 year old started shaking the parmesan cheese on his pizza slice, his hand hits the side of the pizza pan and the WHOLE pie goes sliding off onto the pavement.  Oh crap.  This is so typical.  I just shrug and say, \\"oh well... at least we all got a slice!\\".  BUT (and here's the awesome part), the server sees what happened, comes over and says she has another cheese pizza in the oven right now and that she'll bring it on over to replace the one on the ground!  She totally didn't have to do this!  But she did.  She even put it in a box and placed it safely on the table next to us so that didn't happen again.  This impressed me so much!  I mean, if you drop your dinner on the floor, tough luck, right?  Nope.  Not at Signal Station.So what did I think of the pizza?  I was surprised by how crispy the crust was, how tasty the sauce was and how gooey the cheese was.  This pizza was exactly like it was supposed to be.  It was a gorgeous spring day so we sat in the sun outside.  They do have a small inside eating area for those rainy days, too.  I will gladly come back here to try more than just a cheese pizza pie.  There are so many other toppings that looked delicious.  Plus the customer service goes above and beyond the call of duty.  Signal Station Pizza has earned a repeat customer in me!"},{"name":"Giuseppe's Ritrovo","address":"2268 E Main St","city":"Columbus","stars":"3.5","text":"After the first review, I had not planned on going back to this business.

As far as bringing groups for a dinner out, it's definitely a better option because it's always bumpin on weekend nights. Those things are neither positive nor negative for me when it's just two people, but what is important is that their awaze is the bomb. Their food in general is awesome. My boyfriend and I normally split the kitfo (raw, it's the only way really.), awaze lamb tibs and the veggie platter (yes, we eat a lot.) I'm getting hungry just thinking about how good it is.

My review is a guide on how to enjoy this place on a consistent basis without waiting forever in long lines or emptying your wallet.  I guess I would consider myself a regular at this point.  Probably one of my top 5 burger places of all time.Step 1: Go just before peak times, so ~11am for lunch or just before ~5pm for dinner.Step 2: Park in the lot in the back, they validate, and you don't have to deal with SoCo parking mess.Step 3: Get the basic burger (everything on it) with Frank's Hot Sauce on the side and the fries.  If you're feeling adventurous, get a fried egg on top as well.  Yes all those other fancy options are very tasty too, but this is how I can afford to eat here on the reg.  The basic burger is so much cheaper than the others, and I think just as good.  I've tried most of the others and I think you get diminishing returns with the higher end options.  This way, you spend just a little more than you might at a place like, say, Mighty Fine.Step 4: Pour the Frank's Hot sauce on your burger, on top of the egg, etc.  Squish it down so it will fit in your mouth.  Enjoy the juicy burger with oozing yolk mixing with the slight kick from the hot sauce.  Use the honey mustard sauce for the fries.  It's better than the chipotle ketchup, which I am not really a fan of.  I would rather they just had regular straight up Heinz, but oh well.Step 5: Wash it down with any number of tasty cold beers on tap.  So good.If you follow these steps, you can get in and out of there quick and easy without making a huge dent in your wallet.

My advice: choose multiple dishes that sound good or have a protein your recognize and then let the kitchen staff send them out in the order of their choosing. Put your stomach into their hands. Release control. There is an order to the chaos. The chefs will send out your meal so that each dish builds upon the last one until finally your palate reaches a crescendo and you declare this the greatest meal of your life.

In addition to gazing at the drizzles and the surrounding buildings by the Stadium Station through the windows, the restaurant also attracts a wide variety of patrons for people watching - from the Elton John glasses wearing crowds and film industry workers to those carefully groomed with the just-woken-up look and ensemble.

Although the egg was not kept whole as I expected and it came in a quiche form, the egg itself was very light and delicious.  The light texture reminds me of a common savoury egg custard dish in Chinese home-cooking made with just eggs, water and optional ground pork.  The lightness of the egg in my breakfast was well balanced with the richness of the smoked sockeye and cream cheese inside.  It was not a lumberjack breakfast but I was completely stuffed.

He is allergic to nuts but he is willing to take precautions and have it every once in a while to enjoy the goodness -that's high praise! While I believed my friend, I knew that I had to try this superior fried chicken. I went there for a late lunch which worked out well because despite that there were still quite a few patrons in the restaurant. I'd hate to see it in a mealtime rush. I ordered a three piece dark and subbed in the baked beans for collards. A Southern boy like me is a sucker for collards, and I had a tip off that they were good. My friend was right, the collards were delicious. However they played second fiddle to the absolute best fried chicken I've ever had in my life!\\nThe chicken itself is lightly breaded and is super crispy, it's also not very greasy compared to other fried chickens. They marinate the chicken before breading and frying it which gives it unmatched flavor, juiciness and some kick. Gus's is also really reasonable.

Crunchy outside, soft pillowy deliciousness on the inside.  Spicy!-Pork buns - if you're a fan of these in traditional dim sum, you won't be disappointed.  The pork is high quality, and is paired with a delicious sweet-hoisin sauce, lettuce and some kind of carrot flake (it's not carrot, i just can't remember what it is).  It's all folded into a pita-like wrapper - SO soft and amazingly tasty.  -Beef + Broccoli noodles - YUM YUM YUM.  Great flavor, good quality meet, tasty noodles.  Good portion size too!  Perfect for two people.-Tea smoked spare ribs - the rumors are true.  These are absolutely phenomenal.  Fall off the bone, topped with some kind of pepper + brown sugar crust.  I would eat 3 orders of these myself for an entire meal.-Coconut cream pie w/ lime whipped cream - awesome awesome awesome.  The lime is VERY slight as not to overpower the coconut.  The cream is amazing, and the best part is the crunchy, toasted coconut flakes on top of the whipped cream.  It really makes the dish, to have the combination of textures.Definitely go with someone whose food preferences match yours, so you can get a bunch of things to share.

Grouper and fries were fine. However the sandwich roll was freezer burned and the tomatoes were past their prime - dark red and gelatinous. Also the cole slaw was a waste of ingredients - very bland. The tatar sauce was extremely bland as well. It's like they didn't try at all to bring out good food.  It seemed like preparing it for us was a bother.

The ambiance is funky, fun, and relaxed. The service was good & Mrs. Chang was cooking which was pretty cool. The cocktails, Coco-Lime Cooler & Asian Mojito, were pretty good but a bit weak. However, we weren't impressed by the food. We did the Blind Date menu which was the chefs choice and I think that's where we went wrong. The Asian pickle plate is more like a collection of condiments not an actual dish. The crispy spring rolls were very boring and the shrimp+calamari vermicelli stir fry was very greasy and lacked flavor but the seafood was perfectly cooked. The mama chang's dumplings came with a great sauce & the bok choy with shiitakes were both delicious.Overall, I was very disappointed in 3 out of 5 dishes which were the \\"chefs choice\\". I may come back to give it another try but there are plenty of places in Boston for really good Asian food so I won't be rushing back."},{"name":"Render Coffee","address":"563 Columbus Ave","city":"Boston","stars":"4.5","text":"Like all my great find, I found Render through yelp! So glad I did, because I'd probably walk past this place completely unnoticed.  I've never really stayed long enough to bask in the environment, but I can easily say that the baristas here take their coffee craft to a whole new level. They are seriously, serious about their coffee. They weigh...not measure, but weigh the amount of water they pour into their pour over. WHO DOES THAT!?!?! Talk about consistency! And they're humorous and friendly too! And....they make the most amazing Hazelnut lattes ever, its a little pricy, comes in one size, but it's decorated with beautiful art, doesn't taste artificial and I actually think (never bothered to ask) they grate fresh hazelnut into each cup. Tastebuds blown! Perfect texture, milk to espresso ratio and temperature.

The service is extremely professional--friendly but not suffocating, the prices are great for the quality, and the food is well thought-out and expertly executed. On my visit, we ate a la carte because my dining companion had too many dietary restrictions to eat the chef's menu.  I ordered three courses: an heirloom tomato and burrata salad, steak tartare, and roasted squab.  The salad was delicious and perfectly room temperature to bring the full flavor from the slices of tomato and maximize the gooeyness of the cheese. The steak tartar (always a favorite of mine whenever I see it on a menu) was predictably delicious, and unique in that the steak was carpaccio diced into the tiniest of cubes. The squab, while delicious, was the only weak link in the chain. It was a little dry which is to be expected with that small of a game bird. However, the dish succeeded as a whole because of the moisture (and flavor!) provided by the sauce and polenta.I love this place so much that the next time I visit Vancouver I will return and order the chef's menu, a 5-course steal for only $50 CAD."},{"name":"Blue Star Donuts","address":"1155 SW Morrison St, Ste 102","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Blue Star Donuts is definitely MUCH better than Voodoo Doughnuts!

I would get the Buttermilk Old Fashioned again but I'm not a fan of chocolate so the ganache wouldn't be something I could eat often but chocolate lovers would rejoice.  The donuts are light and fluffy.I only wished they had more flavors available on the day I visited since there was some flavors listed in other yelp reviews that I wanted to try.  The staff was very friendly - can't beat service with a smile and a nice, 'How is your day going?' from the cashier.

In addition, there is a beverage section nearer the beginning of the line so you can get your drink and enjoy it while making your way to the place where you order.The burger could have been good.  The bun was nice and the meat was flavorful but for whatever reason my burger was so salty it was almost inedible.  Clearly a self-inflicted wound that I hope isn't the norm.  The truffle fries were good but a bit too oily for my taste.  Given that one person can share the fries and the burger is filling the place is reasonably priced.  Overall, it should have been a reasonably priced, tasty burger and a decent place to eat.  I'll cut it some slack for the salt hoping it was a one off screwup.

A store clerk at Warby Parker recommended Parish Cafe as a good nearby place to sit down and watch the World Cup while drinking a beer.As I huddled in a corner next to a wall outlet (so I could navigate my way out of Boston when the time came), I enjoyed the atmosphere of a pub/bar. The menu boasted dozens of beers and sandwich recipes from other chefs that were also proudly served at the Parish Caf√©. The atmosphere was extremely casual and like hanging out with old friends (even talked with the woman sitting next to me for a couple of hours about her yoga teacher certification and previous career as a newscaster). When her debit card was declined, the waitress even trusted her to come back the next day to pay for her meal! I would never have expected that to be okay, but she informed me that the Back Bay was a lot friendlier then one would think.The only way to describe the food: awesome. It's all so comforting and decadent. The atmosphere was young and casual with TVs at low volume and a background music that boasted more old school Britney Spears and Spice Girls than anything else.

Each staff member was attentive when needed and have some pretty interesting stories to tell.

I am almost sorry to say this may be the first negative review I have written on yelp. I am inclined to do so but I think you should at least check out Blue Star Donuts to form your own opinion. Here's my story.\\nWhen you are visiting Portland (I'm from NY) there are two donut shops you hear about -- BSD and VooDoo donuts. Last year when I came to Portland I just had to go to both of these places to get my donut fix. I went to Voodoo first (AWESOME but we'll get to more of that in a minute) then the next day at about 3:00 went to BSD. They were closed with a hand written note on the window that they had sold out. OK I could understand that but a little disappointed.\\nHere I am again in Portland October 2018. This time I'm getting BSD early (earlier) and it was a rainy Thursday at 11:00. Can't believe it -- they were already out of a lot of choices. There were more sings of TEMP OUT and SOLD OUT on donuts than donuts available. Now I already mentioned I'm from NY and I'm used to crazy high NY prices but $4.00 for a donut??? $2.75, $3.00, $4.00 -- REALLY???\\nI did buy one and you know want -- not that impressed. At that price I wasn't going to buy four of them to try and with the few choices I had it would be a stretch to get any I might be interested in.\\nAs I said early -- give it a try. You may have a different experience. And definitely go check out Voodoo Donuts -- great choices.

The wait actually wasn't bad at all (as in, it was pretty tolerable). Mind you, we had already eaten something beforehand in anticipation of the wait. Like many others, we decided to walk around downtown after we put our name down on the wait list. The hostess assured us that we wouldn't be crossed off the list if we didn't make it back on time. We returned to the restaurant 1 hr and 15 minutes later and there was a table ready for us. We always like to try the most popular and classic dishes on the menu at a new restaurant. From reading reviews of the restaurant, the two most popular dishes seemed to be the Fricass√©e and the Paella (which our waitress confirmed). We ordered those two to share. We also ordered a Salted Caramel Latte, a Lavender Latte, and waffles with a milk chocolate lavender dipping sauce.The waffles and the lattes came out first. The waffles weren't as warm as I had hoped, but I suspect that they would've been if we were there earlier on in the day. It was almost 1:30 pm by the time we ordered (the restaurant closes at 3 pm). However, that was my one and only semi-criticism of the food. The texture and the the sweetness of the waffles were perfect. The milk chocolate lavender dipping sauce was super smooth; great combination of melted milk chocolate with a hint of lavender. Both of the lattes were superb - the salted caramel and lavender flavour for each one, respectively, was distinct, but not overpowering.I loved both the Fricass√©e and the Paella - there was definitely something special about both dishes. The Fricass√©e was a hearty medley of braised short ribs, roasted potatoes, caramelized onions, applewood smoke cheddar, and seasonal greens that was topped with a fried egg. It also came with a slice of grilled focaccia on the side. I am not exaggerating when I say that the short ribs were incredibly tender - \\"fall right off the bone\\" type of tender (except there were no bones). The roasted potatoes were also very soft. The sauce was what really brought it all together. The sauce was tomato-based, with a bunch of different spices added to it. After mixing everything together, every bite was a savoury bite of goodness.Unlike traditional paella, this Paella was made with orzo pasta instead of rice. The orzo is cooked together with some spicy chorizo, seasonal vegetables, avocado, and grana padano cheese in a spicy tomato salsa. Just like the Fricass√©e, every bite was full of flavour. The spicy chorizo really stood out to me - the spiciness of it was almost addictive; I just kept wanting more of it. The avocado and the egg was the perfect addition to the dish to give it that \\"brunch\\" feel.So ... I have to say that Medina is worth the wait and I would highly recommend it to anyone who hasn't already tried it. It's rare to come across a brunch spot that serves non-traditional \\"brunch food\\". The restaurant is open Monday to Friday as well, starting at 9 am in the morning. Our waitress said that the wait time is usually 30 min max until closer to noon. However, she did mention that a line usually starts to form outside the restaurant around 8:30 am ... so get there early!Read my full review with pictures at http://cyndod.blogspot.ca/2016/04/medina-cafe.html"},{"name":"FLIP burger boutique","address":"1587 Howell Mill Rd","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"The sweet potato tots and onion rings are a must.

Reservations are suggested as this restaurant is a popular place to host birthdays and celebrations, but they are great at accommodating large party groups. Since it was Easter weekend and last minute, we reserved our table at 9:45pm and were seated promptly. We were greeted warmly by our waitress. Do not be afraid to ask for suggestions! The staff are very knowledgable with the wine list as well as the tapas. She recommended the paella and squid ink fideos, which take at least 20+ minutes to prepare. As we were deciding on our tapas and wine, she rushed to place those orders in. A thing to be aware of is that the menu changes daily, so something may on the menu online but may not be served that day you go. However, our waitress was fantastic in making suggestions.Here were some of my favorites:CHARCUTERIE + CHEESE ($17.50 for three): I got the spanish ham and chorizo with a goat cheese called \\"cana de cabra,\\" which was not on the menu, suggested by our waitress. And to be honest, I do not like cheese, but this one has become my absolutely favorite! It was not only creamy and soft, but spreaded on top of their artisan in-house made bread, it was DIVINE! (mouth drooling as I reminisce). I had to ask our waitress for the name at the end of our meal and she was kind enough to write it down for me! The spanish ham was perfectly salty and thinly slice and the chorizo was just excellent.PENALOLEN CABERNET SAUVIGNON 2014 ($65): Another great suggestion by our waitress. This was a very easy red. I am not a big red wine drinker, especially the drier reds, but this was extremely easy to drink and paired very well with our charcuterie and cheese platter. It had a great body with a good spicy note that followed at the end. I love it! Definitely going to look for it around the city! The bottle costs us only $65, while a glass was around $12-15. SPICY EGGPLANT CAPONATA ($4.50) : Spicy eggplant in a tomatoey based sauce. It was not overly spicy and the eggplant was nicely cooked with just the right amount of bite.HANGER STEAK ($11.50): Perfectly tender, cooked at medium rare with a hint of truffle. Probably my favorite tapa!ALBONDIGAS ($8.50): Simple amazing meatballs sitting on top of a tomato sauce, you could tell that the meatballs were house made by how tender they were. We used the artisan bread to soak up that great tomato sauce at the end!PAELLA MARISCOS ($24.50 a person): Simply delicious paella, cannot find anywhere in NYC that is done just so simply and wonderful! The rice had a little bite to it, which I love. SQUID INK FIDEOS ($14.50 a person): The STAR of the meal!! Possibly the best squid ink pasta I have every had! It just indescribable the taste, but you will not regret it if you order it. Tender pasta noodles coated in squid ink. Many of the squid ink pasta I have eaten always were super vinegary and tomatoey, but this was beyond what I have ever tried. This surpasses everything and I would return just for this.

The waitress was very nice and attentive.We ordered Vegetable Korma for an appetizer, but they brought us Paneer Korma instead (their mistake, but it was tasty).For dinner we ordered Saag Paneer, and that was tasty.  We also ordered Paneer Tikka Masala.  I'm a vegetarian, so I was disgusted when I put in my mouth what I thought was a tough piece of paneer, only to realize it was chicken.  Needless to say, I was pissed.  The waitress was apologetic, and immediately put in a new order for Paneer Tikka Masala.  At that point, I didn't want any more food in my mouth.  The new dish was paneer, but it was so tangy that I didn't like it.The waitress brought us a dessert, on the house, but she didn't ask us first if we wanted that, or to have the inaccurate dish taken off the menu.  We really wanted gulab jamoon, but the dish we got was a very watery rice pudding.  The bill came, and nothing was subtracted for their error.  I went to speak with the manager, who promptly took the bill and subtracted $14 for their mistake.

What do I do you ask? Well I ask my good buddy Yelp! So Yelp says, this French food cart us pretty Damn good. We head over, and preview their lovely selection thru their window (conveniently placed about eye level for the young ones... Coincidence? I think not). So we decided to grab the chocolate mousse cake, smores brownie, an eclair, and some zucchini bread. At this very moment I am trying to convince my stomach that it can fit the rest of the smores brownie. Why such a hard sell to my digestive powerhouse? Simply because I already stuffed it with the chocolate mousse cake. It had some moist chocolate sponge on the bottom, and was topped with some dark bittersweet chocolate glaze, and there was some whipped heaven in between. Sadly, the smores brownie will get a pass for now but I'll be back soon to conquer it as if I was Caesar rolling back into Rome in my chariot. The zucchini bread was moist and flavorful as well. The eclair will have to hold off until morning to be devoured, but I have no doubt that it will be equally as tasty.

Santarpio's Pizza has been rated as a Best of Boston in Boston Magazine in 1995, 1996, 2000, 2002, 2005 and 2008. I guess I have to chalk it up to 'different strokes for different folks.' I just don't think it's that good.The pies are sloppily made with ingredients of mediocre quality, inconsistently baked and the crust has the texture of a burnt water cracker. To top it off you will likely have to wait in line (outside) and once seated you get a free side order of attitude from the staff.In all fairness I am in the minority. Santarpio's has a devoted following and gets tons of positive reviews on several online sites. I will not attempt to convert the devoted but I will list my reasons for giving it a big thumbs down.1.The pizza: Like I said, they're made with the care and attention of a truant to his homework. My biggest complaint is they keep their pies, more often than not, in the oven too long. The result is significant burnt spots on top - carbonized cheese, yum - and on then bottom. Inconsistency reigns here. The crust is dry and flavorless. Clearly many like it this way. I don't.2.The pie selection: The pies come in only one size. There are only nine toppings available - or 11 if you count cheese and extra cheese as optional. Peppers and hot peppers are two of the nine and another is anchovies, which for most means that they only have eight toppings. If you want something green on your pie you've come to the wrong place.3.The barbecue: The fact they have the gall to call this barbecue is an abomination to pit masters everywhere. They offer 'choice lamb' and 'homemade sausage.' But let's be clear, this ain't barbecue, it's simply grilled meat. Barbecue means 'low and slow.' The meat suffers the same fate as the pizza. Inconsistently prepared and quickly cooked to a blackened crisp. The lamb is cut into chunks, skewered and grilled. If they took the time to cut the lamb into similarly sized chunks they could cook it more evenly. Instead you'll find one piece as flat, dry and charred as jerky next to a plumb cube that's (thankfully) medium rare. And they will not ask how you want it. It comes their way, not yours. The sausage is reasonably good but not a stand alone reason to come here.4.The setting: Outside - Nestled next to Route 1A's flyover to the airport and less than easy to find, much less find a parking spot. One gets the impression that no valuables should be left in the car. At least you'll be able to keep an eye on your car as you wait outside. Inside - I'm sure the fans come here because of the kitschy throwback interior. But it's a fine line between kitschy and grimy. How the proprietor cajoled so many celebrities to adorn his walls is beyond me. Rachel Ray is excluded from this comment because she wouldn't know good food if she was force fed.5.The attitude: Service here is as inconsistent as the food, but with less variety. It bounds between disinterested to \\"Whadya lookin' at?\\" You'll either feel like an annoyance to your waiter or that you've been served by someone who was to surly to work at Durgin-Park.So let the fans line up. And if I'm missing something it won't be Santarpio's."},{"name":"Clay Pit","address":"1601 Guadalupe St","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Best food, best service.

The person who prepared it had put in a lot of effort and could given the dish any name he wanted and it would have been good. But when you put it as Dum Aloo in the menu, the expectation of customer is that they will eat spicy Dum Aloo.\\n4. The Goat Curry - It had Chicken in it and the lady said since all the meats is placed together, it may have fallen in. I am sorry but you have to be careful what you prepare and serve cause that is your business 101.She gave me 10% discount for the tea and goat curry mix up. What she failed to understand that for $50 dinner for 2 is not inexpensive and we go there to have a good food and not for 10% discount. If I can pay $45, I can pay $50 as well.Anyways, I always give any restaurant 2 chances to impress me with their food. Everyone can have a bad day and it will not be right to judge anyone on their bad day. So Cumins, please be more professional and careful next time. I will not be impressed if your restaurant has been there for 10 or 20 years but I will be impressed by your food and your service. Thanks,\\nNikhil"},{"name":"Wahoo's Fish Tacos","address":"2790 Pearl St","city":"Boulder","stars":"4","text":"One of my favorite fast food places - or should I say food served fast?!!

We had to wait over 40 minutes to get two pasta dishes and a pork chop. I had pasta (I'm vegetarian) but it tasted strongly like sausage, and my companion's tofu noodles were fried and extremely dry. There is no excuse to take that long to cook pasta that tasted like it came from a dry ramen package, especially with that kind of price tag. \\nI felt queasy the rest of the night because of the gallon of butter they doused my food in.

No worries though, I could always fall back on my trusted mainstay The Burger.Showed up around 6:30pm on a Thursday and the hostess seated us immediately. She was friendly and sat us at a booth in the back corner. Not sure if this was a reflection on my recent shaggyness ( My wife keeps telling me I need to shave and get a haircut cause I look like a homeless person) but was comfy all the same. LOL  The Servers are, as another reviewer described \\"beautiful young ladies in short skirts that are incredibly polite\\".We have a general rule, Either appetizer or dessert never both. So this time we decided to skip the app hoping for a good dessert. Ordered a Whiskey sour without looking at the drink menu. My bad on this one but a waste of perfectly good Whiskey. For some reason they shake it with egg whites. Next time I will know better and just order a whiskey straight up. (Some people cant just leave well enough alone and have to \\"Cheffy\\" up everything. I mean it's Whiskey for crying out loud..... Who puts eggs in Whiskey?)  Anyway, lesson learned, moving on. The wife had Sangria and she said it was very tasty.As usual, my intention was to order a burger but when I saw the short rib sandwich with caramelized onions I couldn't help myself. I ordered it without a second thought and my wife ordered the Spaghetti w/ Kobe meatballs. My sandwich was AMAZING! The short ribs were tender and must have just fallen off the bone onto the sourdough toast. The emmental was a nice compliment to the beef. Served with beef jus and fries it was really a very tasty meal. I ended up eating about half of my wife's spaghetti and it was also very good. Served with roasted tomato sauce on the meatballs, truffle mushroom cream on the pasta, and fresh ricotta cheese I dare say it is one of the best pasta dishes I have had in quite a long time.We ordered the Key Lime pie to share for dessert. As a testament to how good it was my wife said \\" I will only have one bite\\" and then promptly devoured most of it. Light creamy Key Lime filling on a perfectly baked graham cracker crust.\\nMmmmmm about sums it up perfectly. LOLAtmosphere was appealing. Service was prompt and friendly. Food was very good to excellent. Price was a bit on the high side but to be expected from the type of restaurant it is. 2 drinks, 2 large entrees, and one desert was about $70 with tip.

The food is tasty; if I was rating on taste alone I would give them 3 stars. However the portion size is embarrassingly small. I'm not overweight nor do I prefer huge portions but I have seen bigger portions on most kids menus. For example I ordered the new Fattoush salad today and finished it in 5 bites. It was made up of mostly greens, 3 olives, 2 bite size pieces of toasted pita bread, and a few diced pieces of tomatoes. Also hubby and I ate here a couple months back and ordered one of the $14 laffas and that too was pretty small. We split it in 2 pieces since the server suggested it is large enough to share and each half was smaller than my palm.

Ironically, everyone we were with were accepting of the situation because 'It's YardHouse and slow service is just part of it', but I was so surprised that the manager did not even apologize or try to make any amends for the situation. There are several other restaurants with equal or better food quality and service to match! I would suggest checking one of those establishments our before becoming here. As far as the food itself is concerned, as someone who has been in the restaurant industry and some of the people we were here with are professional chefs, for food to come out cold is completely unacceptable. Our friends pasta wasn't even reduced, the cheese was left gritty as if it was straight out of the plastic shaker from Kroger.

In addition the noodles aren't \\"hand cut\\" they are \\"hand pulled\\" and pulled excellently I might add. It seems they have one guy who does it and you can go up to the window and watch him in action.So the \\"Xian\\" noodles are their version of Cha Jiang Mien and I'm pretty sure the Red Braised Brisket Noodles reminds me of Pho Bo Kho which isn't too much of a stretch. Like the Pho dish the broth is hearty and slightly sweet. However this is a common overlap trend you find in the Southern Provinces of China when it comes to fusion flavors melded with Vietnamese and Thai influences. For a more classic NorthEast China beef noodle soup go with the Beef Hand Pulled Noodles.Overall the noodles were a lot better than the Sushi.

It stayed on my list for a while and I was glad that I finally found time to visit. I believe I visited on a Friday early evening... the line was already extremely long. Quite a long wait for us and I noticed that the line only got longer and longer... Just be prepared. The restaurant has pretty spacious space outside; however, inside was fairly small and tight on space especially between seats. We sat inside for the visit. Here are a few things that we've tried. Lamb Tibs, Salmon Tibs, and Goden Tibs. Lamb Tibs (5/5) was my favorite. Very tender and flavorful. Spice was just about right. They prep it well so no strong and unpleasant \\"lamb\\" taste left on which sometimes turn me off. I would totally get it again! We chose miser and injera as sides to go with. Injera was pretty good. It was pretty much just soft and spongy flatbread. Went well with the cooked sauces. Not a big fan of miser (red lentil bean stew) since I don't like lentil beans. So I can't comment much on that. Goden Tibs (4.5/5) was my second favorite. The sizzling prime short ribs was nicely marinaded in their own sauce and came with onion, tomato, garlic, and jalape√±o. I really like everything garlic so it was a enjoyable dish for me. Meat quality was good too. We had this one with Gomen... to me it's like collard greens but it was not tasty at all to me personally. Won't recommend. Last dish that we tried was the salmon Tibs (3/5). I probably won't get this again. It was fairly mediocre... salmon wasn't that fresh and didn't feel like it's wild caught but farm-raised... We tried the side with cabbage for this - just an okay. Wasn't super impressed by it. Overall, Desta serves pretty delicious Ethiopian food and definitely worth a visit! I would just suggest doing your research and try the dishes that are actually worth trying. If you can, maybe try visiting during the weekdays to avoid the long line!"},{"name":"Hopdoddy Burger Bar","address":"1400 S Congress Ave, Ste A190","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"The burgers are good - the overall business model is what makes this the best burger spot I've tried yet.  Everything is made from scratch, even the buns and the ice cream for the shakes and of course grinding their own meat.  There is an emphasis on sourcing local products (the chalkboard by the line lists what local farms the food has come from).  Their gluten free buns are as dry as any g-f buns are in most places, so I get my burger on a bed of lettuce and top it with bacon, caramelized onions, avocado, and a fried egg.  Who needs the bun with all of these topping options??We've also had the tuna steak \\"burger\\" which was amazing, the baby kale salad and other seasonal salads, most of the burger variations.  Have never had a bad meal.  They'll cook the burger as rare as you want.  I like that their salads vary slightly depending on what's in season - much better than keeping the same ingredients but having them be bland from being flown in from around the world.  They have a very wide array of drinks (I'm talking about the nonalcoholic drinks - everything from shakes and sodas to kombucha and tea).  Service is well-organized and fast:  even if there's a line it usually proceeds quickly.  I like that they assign the tables before you order so they don't process more orders than there are tables.When it's hot outside and there's a line outside, their servers regularly bring trays of water and samples of food to those waiting.  Again, good business model and good service.  They also have misters and shade panels to help cool off the line.Decor is nice - lots of photos on the wall of local and other musicians.  Would be better without all of the TVs.The only reason I don't give them five stars is that it's pretty loud in there.  Not as loud as the ramen place I just reviewed, but loud enough to make conversation a strain.

My 5 friends & I have known one another for over 30 years, having started our first jobs together after college. Over the past 2 years, one of them has been terminally ill, coming close to death several times. ‚ÄãShe's doing great now, but can only have limited amounts of sodium/salt in her diet. Eating more than the allotted amount can send her right back to ICU. Given this, I was a little nervous about making a reservation at M&C. When I first made the reservation, the person on the phone spent well over 15 mins. with me, going back & forth with the chef to talk about what sort of dishes they could serve her. She was so very helpful and reassuring, I wish I had taken down her name so I could sing her praises. When we arrived last night, the welcoming hostess immediately noted our menu restrictions, and asked us which one had the salt limitations. Our server, the wonderful Audrey L.,  brought over a specially edited menu that she created, which highlighted those items that had limited/no sodium. Now, if that's not above & beyond the call of duty, I don't know what is! Then, every time she served a dish to our table, she discussed its contents with my friend to make sure she knew what she could safely eat. We had a fabulous, worry-free meal with amazing service. My only complaint is that we were all too full to try the dessert menu (Next time!). I can't wait to return, and my friends feel the same way.Thank you for a great dining experience."},{"name":"Cherrywood Coffeehouse","address":"1400 E 38th 1/2 St","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"I am not hipster enough\\nMy ego is not big enough\\nThere is not enough angst in my life\\nI am not pretentious enough\\nfor me to fit in here or enjoy this place\\n...done"},{"name":"Locke-Ober","address":"3 Winter Pl","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"This is my hands down favorite place to eat in Boston.I cant say much that hasn't already been said - but I will say that every time I go somewhere new in the city - I always say \\"well...it was good, but not Locke Ober good\\"Attentive waitstaff who do things like ask if you'd like a sauternes with your foie gras (I love this kind of thing!) - not assumptive (nothing I like less than someone who explains something to be without asking - most famously the guy in Napa who said \\"haricots verts, those are green beans\\"), stodgy old menu favorites like the amazing lobster stew, good new things mostly French influenced - gorgeous, just gorgeous dining room.The type of place where you can sit unhurried have a meal that you will remember for a good long time and soak i the surroundings.I will continue to return, when I have the \\"means\\" ;)"},{"name":"Baby Acapulco","address":"13609 N I H 35","city":"Austin","stars":"3","text":"If i could give this location no stars i would. The only good thing was the mexican martini. We were initially seated in the newly remodeled section of the restaurant which with the exception of another couple was empty. Despite how empty the space was the host sat us at a table right behind the couple that was already seated, tables were too close. This new section is too industrialized in appearance & lacks the personality typically associated with Baby A's. We asked to be seated at a booth & we were moved to the original section of the restaurant. Here we had an engaging conversation with the lively chip lady, maria. After ten minutes of sitting we still hadn't been approached by a waiter. My husband called the restaurant and asked to speak to a manager. The manager did not take the call; we watched the host as he spoke to my husband on the phone & asked what the problem was. My husband explained that we had been seated and we had yet to be attended by a waiter. The host and my husband finally made eye contact after my husband waved at him from our table & the host set off to find a waitress. We saw him wandering around a bit then he went into the kitchen. 5 minutes later a waitress by the name of    Katheryn Came to our table and without a smile, greeting , or apology for wait, simply asked what she could get for us. We ordered our drinks and asked for some water. She brings the water and without a word, just walks away. My water was undrinkable because it had some white congealed looking thing floating in it. The waitress returned with our drinks and asked if we wanted to order some food. By this point my husband & i had decided that we would have our drink & some queso & go have dinner elsewhere. So my husband told the waitress that we would start with a queso. She takes the menus with her as she walks away without even asking if we wanted anything else. So as we wait for our queso, we see the waitress approach another customer and she spends ten minutes just chatting away with her. Two young men came in & sat in the booth behind us. The same waitress approached them after 5 minutes, with a smile, & took their order. The restaurant was pretty empty so there was absolutely no reason for the poor service. We saw the waitress consult with another staff person, who may have been the manager, twice during her service at our table. The manager of course never approached us, but he did have the audacity to wish us a good evening as we walked out the door!  We ignored him. As for the waitress, the only tip she received from us was a handwritten note stating that she must not like her job & that she needs to attend to & pay attention to the tables she is responsible for serving. We ended up at Woodrows at techridge for good margaritas and a yummy pizza delivery at Woodrows from the Brooklyn pie company! Great customer service & truly, honest to goodness friendly and welcoming staff and atmosphere. Highly recommend these two places! BTW, this is the 3rd Baby A's location that we have banned. We remain hopeful about the Stonelake location. My suggestion to the Management at the techridge location is train your wait staff on customer service skills!"},{"name":"Gus's World Famous Fried Chicken","address":"117 San Jacinto Blvd","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"Can I say WOW!!!!!

I have to say this was a mistake.   From the start, this was not a great experience.  Reviewing the children's menu with my 7 year old foodie, she decided that she wanted the marinara calamari, and would share my vegetables.   Our dining companion decided on the cedar plank salmon with maple lemon rub, and \\"spring dug\\" parsnips, and I decided on the Summer Shack version of surf and turf (garlic roasted rock shrimp and skirt steak with mashed potatoes.Well it came time to order; I started to order the marinara calamari for my daughter and was told that it was no longer on the kids menu.   To which I pointed out the menu sitting on the table where it was printed.  Then our friend ordered her dinner, and then came me.  I ordered my surf and turf, which on the menu comes with mashed potatoes, which I did not want so requested a side of green beans instead.  I was told that there would be an upcharge of $2, rather high for substitution side order.  Anyway, I then ordered the \\"cucumber iceberg and red onion\\" salad.  Choices of salad dressing were house vinaigrette or blue cheese, not a lot of choice there.  Ok, no big deal, I'm sure it will be ok.  We also got a small order of fried Florida rock shrimp as a \\"starter\\".Then the food starts to arrive, first came the starter and the salads.  It truly was a small order of rock shrimp, maybe 12 pieces.  My salad was exactly cucumber, iceberg, and red onion.  3 pieces of cucumber, and pickled red onion, the menu should have specified that.Dinners arrived; my daughter's calamari was packaged frozen calamari, at a seafood restaurant I would have expected it to have been fresh made.  Our friend's salmon was overcooked, and instead of flaking when being pulled at with a fork, it came apart in shreds.  The parsnips looked like a pile of brown goo on her plate.  My steak was mostly tasteless, the rock shrimp was good.  The green beans were overcooked, and had no taste at all; I had to put lemon juice and a lot of salt to get any flavor out of them.My conversation with the manager after we were done paid and heading out the door was pretty pathetic.  I pointed out the grievous mistakes that were made and all she did was try the \\"why didn't you ask to talk to me sooner, I would have taken stuff off the bill.\\"  My response to that was that I was not looking for a free meal, but they had issues in their kitchen and wait staff that needed to be addressed.My username here is ExChefinMA for a reason, I have a culinary degree, and almost 20 years' experience in the restaurant industry.

We were originally planning on a bottle of wine, two apps, split entree, and a dessert with coffee- that's my and my better halfs standard way of checking out a new place. We ended up cutting it short after trying their first appetizer.The wine was great and the meal was as follows..Asian Spiced Pork Belly- the pork belly was well cooked and seasoned, three quarters of each piece were melt in your mouth delicious. The pickled veg on the other hand was essentially over dressed(the veg was LIMP) and there was so much rice wine vinegar without balance, that the dish tasted like we were doing shots of distilled white vinegar. It really felt that the veg was sitting in the bottom of a six pan soaking in the pickling mixture. Couldn't find enough of the fennel or 'Texas honey' either.. Not a bad app, but not great either.Fried Oysters- the oysters were fried perfectly, the undressed raw bell pepper hack- of- a -salad served alongside the oysters was un-meaningful and lame. If you want to put something on the plate, make it mean something. The potato chips served on the dish were under the hot oyster, so instead of being crisp they were initially scorched-over cooked, chewy, and uneventful. The whole dish needed salt-BAD.We cut our meal there. The food was really just lacking finesse and final seasoning. I would like to ask the kitchen if any of their cooks actually taste their food before plating and sending it out. Our waitress, Jillian, was great and attentive to start, knew her wine list. While she was on point (but like another reviewer noted) it seemed like the majority of the staff was irritated by us eating there in the last hour(we left by 9:15). Just a bad vibe from the rest of the staff and with a final ticket of $46.00- for two apps and a glass of 8 dollar wine each, my boyfriend and I just felt HAD. The food was just not exciting or well executed enough to charge those prices with the dim ambience offered.

I always go for the buffet so I can try a variety of foods.  The reason why I do not give them 5 stars is mainly due to the limited selection of meats at the buffet as it's typically chicken and goat.  Although I do believe they have the best chicken tikka masala which is always served at the buffet.  No other place has the same flavor as this place and it surely is the best.  I can eat naan with just the sauce and feel satisfied.  \\nThe weekend buffet is what excites me every time due to their selection of chaats including their pani puri and samosas.  They have made 3 different combinations for me which always brings me back for seconds.  This is only served during the Sat, Sun afternoon buffets and on Wed evening for the Indo-Chinese buffet.  The Indo-Chinese buffet is also tasty due to the fact they serve tandoor chicken wings instead of the chicken breast--the wings are much juicer and seem to absorb the flavors better due to the small piece of meat that is marinated.  \\nOverall, I prefer this Indian buffet over all the other ones that I've tried.  Their service is also excellent as they recognize their customers and will ask about other visitors you've eaten with at previous visits.  They are friendly and attentive to your needs and never hesitate to make your visit worthy of the $ spent!"},{"name":"Halal Bros","address":"1910 W Braker Ln","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"I really enjoyed this place.

You were to third base with me on the 1st date. I was ready to go all the way on our 2nd. But you pooched it. And now our love has to be fruto prohibido. I came in the first time on my lunch hour, attracted by your claims of homemade tortillas. I love those on a restaurant. You rocked my world with asada tacos and a pretty fair veggie tamale. The tortillas were toe-curling, the asada tender and perfect. I knew I must have you. I brought my wife here (mistake #1) to share in the carnal desire. However, since she is not a carne-vore, she chose a vegetarian burrito. She does not have the fire in her loins for the meats. However, upon getting all up in that burrito's guts, she found that it indeed had two pieces of meat inside. I know you didn't mean to do it, baby, but you cannot mess up like that. What was going to be a truly open and special relationship now has to be our dirty secret. That reminds me...you need to clean yourself up a little bit, baby. The first bite is with the eye, you know. Tidy up a bit.Now I must  see you only in fleeting encounters. A lunch hour here, a weekend dalliance there. Invariably, I will be solo when we meet.

The three of us all got some version of Pad Thai - all were fabulous and were generous in portion. The service was slightly slow towards the end, we waited for a while for our food to be wrapped up and to be given the bill.  A server that was not ours actually took the plates from our table.

It's on my list of top 5 restaurants right now. I'll try to keep this short. Order the datiles. Either for an appetizer or dessert. They are almond filled dates that are wrapped in perfectly crisp bacon. They are the perfect combination of sweet, savory, crunch and chewy. My husband and I like to order these after we eat the main dishes because they satisfy that dessert craving without busting your gut. EVERYTHING here is good! It would be very hard for you to order something that you don't like, unless you're a super anal picky eater. The Atun: Seasoned seared tuna on a bed of greens...it's really fresh and light and perfect for when you aren't super hungry but just want to taste something delicious. When I am hungry however, which is most of the time, I go for the Lomito which is on the 'Specials' menu. It's Guyanese cheese atop of what I believe is a 7oz. sirloin, cooked to perfection (or however you like, medium is perfect to me.) It's just so decadent and tender...I often reminisce about it for days after eating it (I love food.) Seriously, if you haven't tried this place you need to try it. One warning though. If you order the Arepas which are these cornmeal tortillas filled with pork and other amazingness...just know you might not be able to finish your main course. My husband makes this mistake every time. He orders them because they are so good...and they are...but then he's stuffed because it's a pretty huge appetizer. So get them to share with others or just know that you will be leaving with a doggy bag. I usually order the beat and goat cheese salad. A lot of restaurants do this exact same salad but they don't do it like Orinoco...I don't know where they get their cheese from but it's like no other.Get there early! and by early I mean 5-5:30pm if you want to get a seat at the bar. Yes, I said it. Just to sit at the bar you need to get there early. If you want and actual seat at a table I would say get there even earlier or be okay with waiting because this place gets packed very quickly. You might get lucky but if you're really hungry and don't want to wait long, just get there early. We only got a table one time which is fine because the bartender is so friendly (Gabby, I think,) and she is great entertainment. They don't take reservations but the hostess told me that friends of the owner do get them so don't get all huffy and mad if you see a bunch of open tables but they refuse to seat you. The food is worth it and the staff is super attentive and friendly so trust me, you won't even care to wait or sit at the bar. I just love the atmosphere here, it's very lively and the decor is colorful and inviting. Can you tell this is one of my favorite restaurants? This place is a bit pricey but if you're a true food lover, you won't mind and it's always nice to splurge a little ;-)"},{"name":"Tavern in the Square","address":"1815 Massachusetts Ave","city":"Cambridge","stars":"3","text":"I've been here a few times spread out over the years.Stump Trivia. It seems that Stump does all of the trivia around town, and unfortunately I don't like it. A little bit slow. On my last visit I had the White Truffle Mac and Cheese, and added chicken to it. It was delicious, but I wondered why I was spending $17 on mac and cheese (13.99 plus 2.99 for chicken). Our server was good, even though we were a bit slow in ordering. Water was kept up to fill. The location is pretty convenient in Porter, right down from the station. There is some outside seating, and the inside is covered in TVs, especially in the back. Lots of seating means that its possible for large groups to go here. I'm only giving three stars because of the price of my mac and cheese, and the opportunity to go back and try something else. The menu seems massive, and I had a hard time choosing something. 10+ pages.

They have an extensive list of wines by the glass which is great for pairing different wines with the various courses. The pate is absolutely outstanding. Salads were fresh and crisp.

I had the chance to try the soondubu jigae (spicy tofu stew) as well as the bibim naegmyun (spicy cold noodles). The tofu stew had a few side dishes that came with the meal. The portions are pretty large and there is complimentary seaweed soup that is self-serve.Its definitely a good deal for the price.

My bf and I went on a Tuesday night so it wasn't too busy. It is public seating which seems to be a common theme with the new places that are opening on the South side. I haven't decided if i am a fan of this or hate it, but it worked for us since the couple next to us was just finishing up when we got seated. Cozy place with a friendly staff. The wait staff is very knowledgable on all the dishes, which I think is very important in the restaurant industry. They gave us their suggestions and favorites that were on the menu for that day. The menu is always changing which is nice and keeps it fresh. They suggest 3-4 plates per person so we ordered 6. They have a really nice wine list too and will give you their suggestions for a wine to complement your food choices. Everything came out in a timely fashion and was AMAZING, inspiring and unique. The flavors were blended together so perfectly and everything was just well balanced. I found myself scraping the plate on each dish and in fact they will give you a spatula so you can ensure you get every last piece or drop. I will definitely be back especially since they now take reservations and to try the desserts!

We just hiked from South Station to the Renaissance and were refusing to go out into the cold again for dinner. Therefore, we dined at the hotel's restaurant, MC Spiedo. We were greeted after a minute by the hostess and seated at a little two person table by the windows. Normally this would be fine with me, very cute, however it was freezing cold and those windows are not forgiving. I had to ask the man who poured our water if i could move. He moved us to a booth in the middle, which was still cold but a little better and I wanted to get along with dinner.After we received water we waited for awhile until the server came over. They weren't packed but maybe understaffed or who knows. The server was pleasant and he took our drink order. Then disappeared and took an even longer time coming back. There was a large party going on which may have something to do with us, but again I'm not sure. I saw the manager (or someone who looked like the manager) catch us out of the corner of his eye and noticed we both looked bored (rightfully so I was hungry and ready to head back to the room). He came over with our wine and poured both our glasses - great, Houston we have wine.  The pinot noir was actually pretty good, a little acidic but not overly so.A little while later two more people joined us at our table which was a surprise. The waiter came over a while after that to take their drink orders and finally take our dinner order. I was told the soup was quite big so all I ordered was the soup and my partner got the veal burger with polenta fries. My soup, the eggplant puree soup with mint, was okay at best. It was almost too salty and more like gravy than anything. I even found a piece of smoked meat in my soup. I'm not a vegetarian AND it tasted better than my soup so I wasn't discouraged but if I was a vegetarian I'd be pissed. I heard the pizza was good but I can get pizza anywhere.My partner had the veal burger which was bland and I ate two out of the 5-6 polenta fries. They were okay. That was dinner.For breakfast on Sunday morning I actually enjoyed the food. However, all I got was the (cheaper option) breakfast buffet, with coffee and a juice for $16. This included fruit, smoked salmon, brie, bagels, capers, onions, toast, cereal, hot oatmeal with golden raisins and brown sugar. The more expensive breakfast buffet includes bacon, sausage, meat and waffles / pancakes. In my opinion you can get everything you need in the cheaper option unless you're really the mood for pancakes with blueberries on top...A coffee will run you $5 so it makes sense to get the breakfast buffet given most of the other options are $14 - $21 + coffee separately at $5. There are other options for food in the seaport so I suggest only going here if you're limited to dining inside the hotel."},{"name":"Hopdoddy Burger Bar","address":"1400 S Congress Ave, Ste A190","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Finally got my chance to try Hopdoddy this week.

Luckily the folks running the show have got the crowds under control too, otherwise the place would be unbearable. I like that they will take a drink order from you while you wait in line. Yes, it is a long line. They move it along as well as they can. No need to worry about a place to sit in this little spot. Someone will come along and reserve a table for your party just as you are about to order. The place is clean and organized. The burgers are fun and unique. Yes, of course you can get a basic burger, or pretty much whatever you'd like. Then there are some great burger ideas, like \\"Twisted Swisster\\" which included of all things, Swiss, as well as some mushrooms and some roasted red peppers. This was not my order but I'm told it was delicious. The child ordered her usual bacon-cheeseburger. When she didn't finish, I gladly helped. Typically I can do without bacon or cheese because they're never worth it. This was good though. The cheese was cheddar and the bacon was thick and smoked. And the fries!

After a particularly sweaty session at Red Hot Yoga nearby earlier last week, I was intrigued to find a valets running around parking cars, but no restaurant to be seen. A couple of google searches later, I learned it was a new place called The Painted Pin. And it looked awesome. I knew I had to bring my friends to check it out! This venue is tucked away off of Miami Circle. Early Sunday evening we arrived and had no problem getting a lane to bowl- it's first-come-first-serve, and no reservations allowed. I like that concept. I filled out a card with the 5 folks in their party and shoe sizes. We arrived at our lane and shortly after so did a box of shoes- nice touch to not only have them delivered but also to have a place to store our normal shoes while we played.I ordered a bourbon punch, and while the drink was delicious, it was tiny! The drink was served to me with the glass half-full, that must be the cool new trendy thing to do, but it left me feeling like someone had taken a nice big gulp out of my drink. For $9 - not impressed with the quantity or quality. I later ordered the Aviation and the same story- this is probably the tiniest little glass I've ever been served a cocktail in. That one was a bit stronger, but $8 for a tiny drink?? Boo. I was most looking forward to the cocktails here as I had heard the guy from the Spence helped create the cocktail list, but in the future I'll be sticking with beer for the best value. The food my group ordered was good. The loaded fries are a good choice for a group. I liked that they gave the traditional loaded fries a little step up with fresh onions,  big thick chunks of bacon (or possibly pancetta?), and cheesy goodness. The cheese plate was good - loved the jam - but felt there wasn't a lot on the plate. It would be a good thing to order if you're on a date.We finished one game of bowling in an hour - that's with 5 people and liberal breaks for eating/drinking. We wanted to check out the rest of the venue and $35/hour for the lane is a little pricey anyway.  Additionally I think we were all feeling a little uncomfortable with the tight quarters at the lanes. Whoever was sitting closest to the lane always had to stand up for someone to get by to play. I can't imagine what this would be like if you were playing with more people in 2 lanes (1 table dedicated to every 2 lanes). But the couches are definitely comfy! We headed for the ping pong room, easily the most fun all night. I really liked how this was in a completely separate room so the balls aren't escaping all over the venue. It was tight quarters (again another theme) to try to get to the other side of the table. After ping pong, we went down to the basketball and skeeball area. The basketball area wasn't made by a professional; the balls kept getting stuck above a bar and making a loud clanging sound. There wasn't any timer or point-keeper so...it was more like a place just to throw some free throws, not really a game. We never did get to check out the dart board or the skittles game. Skittles actually looks pretty scary (or dangerous!) so I'm actually okay with missing out on it. My total came to $47 - 2 cocktails, splitting of our 2 apps, splitting of the lane cost,  shoe rental, and tax/tip. Not totally insane for a normal weekend out, but we definitely didn't have a full meal and my drinks were so tiny. \\n \\nOne thing that appealed to me is that this venue is 21+ after 7:30pm! However  we saw children lingering about until about 8:30pm, a little bit of a bummer, but probably more of a problem on the weekends.I did notice they have a DJ on some evenings and I am really more interested in talking (and hearing!) my friends, so I'll be avoiding on those nights.HUGE props to our server, Kristen, who totally made the experience. She kept one tab for us no matter where we were, and so we just had to pay one bill at the end. I'm sure they won't be doing that as the place gets busier, but it was a nice touch for us. She gave great recommendations and a fantastic overview of all that the Painted Pin had to offer us. Definitely ask for her!! There were a few things that didn't feel right: a free pizza that at first was an \\"extra\\" and then was a \\"compliments of the kitchen\\" among other things. I also noticed they already have folks writing shill reviews...please don't go down that road. Please.Don't let my 3 stars fool you, you should definitely check it out. For me though, it's a been-there-done that. Don't feel any particular need to return in the immediate future, especially knowing my money will go further at other places.

Our waiter, an older gentleman, was incredibly efficient and we had a great time joking around with him.  We enjoyed the older charm of the restaurant.  The only negative I can say about the place would be to have more than a one-seater bathroom.  We were a pretty loud and rowdy group but everyone around us seemed to be having just as much fun as we were.We ordered a couple pizzas, a couple orders of their barbecue, and a couple salads.  Many carafe's of their house wine were enjoyed, some even enjoyed a little too much.

I got a croissant au jambon and a chocolate marquise, which seems to be a best seller since practically everyone in front of me got this cake.Croissant au jambon: 4/5; not the best croissant I've ever had, but still delicious and enjoyable\\nChocolate marquise: 4.5/5; wonderful interplay of different textures and flavours. I particularly enjoyed the thick layer of caramel near the bottom. It probably would be even better if it was salted caramel.So based on food alone, I would give this cafe a 4/5. However, I was a bit disappointed by the service. Don't get me wrong, the staff weren't rude or anything, and I'm sure that they're doing their best, but there seemed to be an overall lack of organization. The person who took my order wasn't the same person who wrung me up, and the cashier initially mistook someone else's order for mine. I don't want to be too picky, but I did expect a bit more in terms of service for a place where I'm paying $8 for a slice of cake. Nonetheless, I still thoroughly enjoyed the food, and I'll probably be back to try other goodies, specifically their tiramisu."},{"name":"bartaco","address":"969 Marietta St NW","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"I've been to this restaurant a few times but it wasn't til recently I had a bad experience with the valet. I got my car back and it was pulling to the right. I get my haircut nearby and I noticed the valet guys driving the cars like they were in nascar to the parking lot where they put cars. And the roads that they speed down have pedestrians on a narrow street with cars parks on both sides of the road. The road is extremely bumpy and speeds should not be near what these guys are doing. They hop in cars and redline them all the way up the street. Someone should really speak to the owner and seek anew agency to facilitate the valet services.

The murals and decor are a bit over the top but it does create a fun atmosphere.  We ordered the margarita and the Pizza del buonguastio which is a potato, proscuitto, rosemary, and gorgonzola pizzas.  Both were quite good however, I preferred the margarita.  The sauce was fantastic, crust crispy but not burnt, perfect amount of cheese and basil.  The second pizza could have used less potato and more of the other toppings, but again, the crust was perfect.  We ate them right up.  We also ordered a canoli to split for dessert  and were pleasantly suprised to find it was very similar to something you'd find in the North End.  All in all, a very good pizzeria, great sauce, crust, toppings,  good atmosphere, full bar with a decent wine list, and all reasonably priced.  Not too much to complain about.

It was my works after work bar and I lived next door on Gloucester street for 3 years. So normally during my wedding week I wanted to take my wedding guests there after a sox game to show them where I used to have all fun my when I lived in Boston. Not only did I not know a soul who worked in the joint I was just totally shocked at how much this place had changed and not for the good. First of all it was a Wednesday night and the bar was dead. I brought in close to 30 people to celebrate our upcoming nuptials and this bar staff couldnt have been any ruder to me and my guests. We were questioned on buying shots. Like who they were for and that they could only serve four at a time. I have NEVER in my life heard such a thing. They even cut a friend off who barely drinks and who had one beer the whole night. When I questioned them I got complete attitude from every waitress, bartender and even the manager. I was totally disgusted and embarrassed by how poorly these people were acting in this place. Their whole attitude was unreal. I dont know who those lil girls think they are with their little tight outfits on. I wasnt impressed and neither were any of my friends. They wouldnt allow any of us to order shots or drinks at this point so I exchanged some words with both the bartender and their manager and let them know how poorly they were portraying Boston. I took my party and went to the Pourhouse who was happy than heck to have us there and we ordered as many drinks and shots as we wanted. So I am just letting you know if you want to go there this is what you are in for! So disappointed by this bar considering how much business I had given them in the 3 years I lived there.

It's a classy place to spend a convivial evening. Only problem? The food is actually only average at best.  Sure, some dishes are expertly done but i feel that if their specialty is seafood, it should hit a higher note.  \\nSablefish is usually done well, but their performance on lobster and crab are average....at best.  Lobster should not be cooked to the point of rubberiness and the crabs should have firm shells, a sign of freshness.  To be clear, this is not a complaint, it's an observation.

On the other hand, I LOVED the frosting of the red velvet cupcake... it was right on the money, but the cake did NOT taste like red velvet. More like a yellow cake with red food coloring. Still yummy though. And the egg nog... I didn't really give it a chance, because by the time I got to it I was on a crazy-ass sugar high. I will say that I love sweets and am pretty easy to please when it comes to all things sugar. But I wasn't completely blown away by the cakes.

The roasted vegetables looked and tasted like they came out of jars.  Two of the four meats were tasty, and none of the cheeses were particularly good.  The real disappointment came with the entrees, though.  The spaghetti  came with six tiny meatballs.  The pasta was a little overcooked; the sauce and meatballs were equivalent to what I'd expect at a place that costs about 1/3 as much.  The risotto was not risotto-- it was rice, and not good rice at that.  The sauce was box-like.  The seafood was also pretty horrible.  The shrimp were amazingly overcooked, the scallop was slightly overcooked but not seared at all, the pieces of fish still had inedible skin on them, and the mussels were sandy.  We though we could finish up the meal with some nutella bread pudding, because how could that be bad, right?  Wrong.  It tasted nothing of nutella but was very boozy and chewy.  Moreover, they served it ice cold.  Based on the food, I give the place 2 stars. The service was fine, but we waited 45 minutes even though we had a reservation.  The place was tiny, but cute--- that is, until friends of the servers showed up to start drinking and smoking at around 10:30 pm (they were smoking outside, but standing at the open windows still chatting with their friends who were right inside, so the smoke in the restaurant was pretty overwhelming).

Thankfully, there are a lot more options now."},{"name":"Cumin Indian Restaurant","address":"1025 Polaris Pkwy","city":"Columbus","stars":"4","text":"They were serving this in my workplace's cafeteria, so I can only rate based on what was available. They were serving their Chicken Tikka Masala, Saag (spinach) and some sort of peas and potatoes curry with a side of basmati rice and naan. The tikka masala was AMAZING. I like spicy food, but not so spicy that nose is running. The tikka masala was the perfect level of spiciness, it was just so flavorful. The saag and peas/potatoes were meh. They are the reason this is getting a 3-star. Plus overall the presentation was really unappetizing looking. The naan was also great. It was really warm, soft naan that held up well.I probably would visit the actual restaurant to try the buffet since I was so impressed by the main entree."},{"name":"Terry Black's Barbecue","address":"1003 Barton Springs Rd","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"we arrived after 12pm on a Sunday. The line was not long. i like the open space (indoor and outdoor seating). I also like the selection of appetizers you can choose before you get to the meat. I dont know if it's because I've been eating all meat the day before and the morning of sunday, but their green beans were exceptionally tasty! perfectly cooked with garlic / shallots with just the right amount of saltiness. The mac and cheese was standard - nothing special.because we ate so much.. we only got a 1/3 lb brisket to share between four people. Trust me .. it was more than enough at the time for us. we were able to sample and have a bite to compare all the other places we had just tried.Brisket here is good, nice bark, tender, and moist. The bark was flavorful and not super salty or peppery. I would love to come back here again and try their beef rib. It looked really good but i just couldnt handle another bite full of meat. the prices are reasonable here - i think it's cheaper than la Barbeque too. plenty of parking spaces as well. this place is good enough for me to come back w/o having to wake up and stand in line at 9am for a place to open at 11am. Staffs there are cool! they even gave us a little tour in their smokehouse. that was really neat!"},{"name":"The Breakfast Club","address":"270 Western Ave","city":"Allston","stars":"4","text":"Are you a child of the 80's, and a John Hughes fan? \\nLooking for simple but well made breakfast fare?Try this cute diner.

The decision was made to go here because Canton Cooks was closed (so sad).  I was really looking forward to trying a new authentic Chinese restaurant especially when I heard that the chef used to be a head chef at Canton Cooks.  I was expecting the food to be good given that the chef was from Canton Cooks, my favorite Chinese restaurant in Atlanta.  However, now I know why Canton Cooks got rid of this chef.    Was it the best?  No.  Was it the worst?  No, however, I've definitely had better.  The dishes I almost always order at every somewhat authentic chinese restaurant are sauteed snow pea leaves, mapa tofu, and salt and pepper shrimp with shell.The snow pea leaves needed just a little more garlic, salt, pepper... well, just about everything.  It was edible, but bland.The mapa tofu needed a little more of everything as well.  BLAND.  My friends' kids loved it, which means it was only on par for the very young, immature palate.  Disappointing.  How can you mess up mapa tofu?The worst was the the salt and pepper shrimp.  The only time I had worse salt and pepper shrimp was at a cheap Chinese buffet.  This dish was also BLAND.  The poor shrimp was missing its salt and pepper.  Again, not the worst Chinese food I've ever had, but not the best.  I would eat here again if I absolutely had to, but I wouldn't ever choose to eat here myself.  If you're out in that area in the mood for Chinese, on a day other than Wednesday, then just go a little further down the street to Canton Cooks.  It's far superior to China Cooks."},{"name":"Chung's Asian Cuisine","address":"731 Granite St","city":"Braintree","stars":"3","text":"The food is great,exactly the way we want it.But the customer  service sucks big time i bought my kids in the returant the waitress and the waiter fought with us because we tip them 1 dollar.

Jonathan basically described it as a picnic on a plate, which was very accurate. It had a hard boiled egg (which I wasn't interested in), tomatoes, olives, avocado, prosciutto, ciabatta bread, and a little bowl of olive oil and spices. Oh man. That was so good.

So I know what they offer... I had pork belly, duck, oysters and fish tacos and some chips and salsa..The pork belly was soo good, they have a few sauces made in house that are amazing. It was cooked perfectly and melts in your mouth. Fried oyster tacos were also really awesome, had some awesome aeoli sauce in it, and duck was amazing and not chewy at all, just soft and mushy but still in strips.What really made my first trip was the service. My server was awesome and really friendly and fast... I came a second time and had a different server who was also really nice and friendly... they seem pretty happy and are on point with service and getting all that I need...only thing is say is price is a little high, but I know I'm paying for the quality so it's worth it to me..will be back, and happy I found this place"},{"name":"The Big Kahuna","address":"","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"I work downtown and I eat at Mimi's a lot.

I found this place one day at random as I was riding my bike to Zilker for a relaxing afternoon.  I recently made a trip to Lockhart and really enjoyed the bbq there, so I recognized the name and whipped in for lunch.  I started out by mentioning Lockhart and they seemed pretty annoyed and mentioned that they weren't affiliated with them or something along those lines.\\nThe only complaint I would have is with the sliced brisket sandwich I ordered recently.  Instead of taking the brisket and slicing it right in front of me, some guy off to the side had (what appeared to be) a less than impressive foil of already sliced brisket.  I love ordering sliced brisket sandwiches at most place I go because it's easy to eat and I usually would take the bread and make a sandwich anyway.  This is the first and only place I've ever been that didn't cut it from the same brisket as all the others.  The sandwich was still good, but it was very clear that it wasn't the same brisket that I would've gotten if I just ordered a 1/4 pound of it.\\nLast time I went in, I chatted with the guys as they were ringing me up and I accidentally left my blue tooth speaker on the counter.  It's what I keep on my bike while I'm riding around and it's about a $65 speaker.  I didn't even realize I'd left it there until the lady brought it to my table and I was really glad she did because I would've been sad to lose it.  \\nBottom line: unless I want to stand in line at Franklin (no thanks) or even for an hour at LA BBQ then this place is pretty good and consistent."},{"name":"The Crepevine","address":"249 W State Rd 436","city":"Altamonte Springs","stars":"4.5","text":"Crepe vine was my happy place while in college in Tallahassee.

The naan was wrapped separately in foil and the rice (prettily studded with turmeric-colored grains among all the white grains) and chicken were packaged in separate containers. They even included a paper plate and fork and knife.It's a little on the high side for an everyday lunch, but not unreasonable compared to other takeout places. That's more a function of my budget, I suppose, than a comment on the cost of their food. They do have a lunch menu that offers a budget price for slightly smaller portions.

Coles notes version:- I am enjoying conversation with my friend, he spills alcohol ALL OVER my brand new phone (literally dripping wet)- A simple \\"sorry\\" is all that would have been necessary, but no.- Not only does he not apologize or attempt to clean up his clumsy mess, he has the nerve to implicate that the whole situation was my fault, exclaiming \\"You should keep your stuff closer to you...\\" Really?  It was 2 inches to the right of my plate, but even that's beside the point.  If I weren't with my good female friend who I hadn't seen in ages, I would not have swallowed that pill.

On the other hand, the Ahi Tuna Nachos were kind of nasty - substandard ingredients covered with overflavored sauces so you won't notice.Also be forewarned that the 'chai' on the menu consisted of a bag of Twinings in a metal pot - not chai as you might expect it in Anandapur.All that said, the service was good, the theming fun, and the atmosphere perfect for a break in a busy hot day in Animal Kingdom."},{"name":"Xian Sushi and Noodle","address":"1801 E 51st St","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Still sitting in this restaurant, waited 15 minutes for the check.

Don't know how that one happened.  My friend loves to come here and play pool, but we typically go during the afternoon when it isn't packed.  There are a dozen or so pool tables that can be used for any period of time (I believe you pay by the hour or half hour).  The tables are a bit run down, but they serve their purpose well.While playing during an empty afternoon, I had to walk up to the bar to order a beverage and nachos (not that I cared all that much).  Once we had our beverages, the servers were more attentive (probably because they wanted a tip?).  The nachos are huge, way too much for two people to enjoy.  At one point you could order a half order, but it isn't advertised on the menu.In between the pool areas is a bar and sit down section.  On the few nights I've been, they are packed with people enjoying the variety of beers on tap.  Beer in Boston is shockingly more expensive than my current location in Ohio, but I've been known to enjoy one of their imports when I'm feeling frisky.

Forget Zanmai.  Drive a little way out east and be prepared for real, quality sushi.  This place really is the best-kept secret in Boulder.  It's not trendy.  It's not hip.  It's not packed, or loud, nor do you need to wait on the sidewalk for a half hour to get a seat at the bar.  Rather, it is peaceful, elegant and the food will blow you away. Head Sushi Chef Beni-san recently completed a stint at Nobu in NYC.  Not that this is a be-all, end-all recommendation, but it does indicate the gentleman knows his fish.The nicest thing about Akiyama is the sheer unexpectedness of it - you'll find this tranquil Zen oasis plunked right in the centre of the Gunbarrel strip mall / King Sooper's shopping centre - right between a (terrible!) dive tex-mex joint and a quickie-nail salon.Walk in the front door, however, and this could be any of the high end sushi bars I've been to in NYC, SFO, DC, Monterey, LA, Maui or Aspen.  And it blows them all away.  And while Sushi Sasa in LoDo is very good, this place is spectacular, with the same attention to detail and full course menu options, but just that little extra something that makes it all come together.They have a standard compliment of the now-standard rolls and salads.  Forgive me a touch of snobbery though if I find things like '69' and 'Rainbow' rolls to be 'Engrish' sushi - they're westernized, and in my opinion analogous to an appletini or cosmopolitan as opposed to a perfect gin martini.  Tasty enough, and ok for a certain mood, but not the genuine article.  Where Akiyama truly shines is in their standard  nigiri and sashimi offerings.  Buttery soft hamachi, saba, squid or amaebi literally melt in the mouth.  They're one of the few places I've found to use fresh wasabi, rather than coloured horseradish paste.  Service is always prompt, considerate and friendly, even when they've had a full house.  And although I've only been there a couple times in the past six months, the host and chef still remember me.  When it's not hopping busy (only on rare weekend nights), the chef has sometimes been known to offer samplings of different fare.  Overall I get the impression that the folks who run this place are in it because they truly love the food and want to show it off to the clientele.Oh and the single most unique thing about the Akiyama sushi experience?  Free, abundant parking!  I don't personally have a car, but this is one of the things I know puts a damper on my friends' LoDo and downtown Boulder dining experiences."},{"name":"The Painted Pin","address":"737 Miami Cir NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Such a fun bowling spot with great food and drinks.

Out shopping for bridesmaid's dresses for the day, we had a reservation for 12 here because our first choice didn't take reservations and there were too many of us to chance it.

The menu is a good size, not overwhelmingly large and they have brunch on the back, which a bunch of us didn't realize. A few ladies ordered drinks since it was a celebratory kind of day. One of them was wrong so she mentioned this to the waitress and not that I saw but apparently was replied with an eye roll! Her \\"new\\" drink came back 20 minutes later and was still incorrect so we just decided to give up on that front and order our food. I got the quesadilla because I wasn't wildly hungry and some other dishes people got were the cobb salad, the burger, a ruben, and a lot of people had the onion soup. They brought us bread baskets but then immediately following brought us our food, appetizers and entrees at once. And the cobb salad came absolutely last, with some waiting involved, which was odd. The waitress continued to be kind of rude, she must've been having a bad day. The food was okay, nothing I'd go back for. Everyone seemed to like their food fine. At one point the manager came over to talk to us about how things were going and thanking us for choosing his restaurant.

A couple of friends and I split the meat platter (lamb and sausage) and 2 pizzas, garlic/sausage and onion/mushroom/pepper. The meat came out first with a hunk of bread and 3 pickled peppers. The lamb was cooked perfectly and the sausage, which I heard is made in house, had an amazing crust on it. The pizza came next and though it was pretty greasy a couple of shakes of parmesian soaked it up. The crust was soft, thin and had an amazing crunch due to the corn meal used on the bottom. One friend commented on the \\"peach\\" color of the pizza because of the perfect cheese/sauce ratio. It was perfect, really. All pizzas from the Allston/Brighton area since have paled in comparison.

The baristas are always cordial and just about every time I request something a little different from how they usually make my lattes and coffee, they come through. Also, for those environmentally-conscious, students-with-loans (me) and frugal spenders out there, you save $0.25 when you bring your own cup!

There can be a wait during peak hours (20+ minutes) as the space is relatively small, but when you land a table, OH BABY!In the times I've been here, I've only gotten the soups, particularly the Beef Noodle and Red Braised. The Red Braised has a little more flavor due to the rich broth, and that'll likely be my pick from now on. Everyone has their own preferences on the type of noodle, but I prefer thicker noodles, so I choose between the spaghetti or pappardelle (thick and flat). Portions are huge, making the soup well worth the cost.I haven't heard good things about the sushi (and the ramen), and I wouldn't advocate for you to try.

I still enjoy HEB orange juice, what does that make me. Skinny's menu is divided simply into sweet juices, green juices, and smoothies. There! Easy. I have pretty simple tastes, so I usually stick to the Weller (strawberry banana) or the awesome Downward Dog (cherry, blueberry and peanut butter) both of which are consistently awesome. It is also amazing how filling these smoothies are. However, I am the biggest fan of their juices. I am downright frightened of some of their juices (cilantro in a juice is just not appealing to me) but their fresh-squeezed (no, really, they do it right there in front of you) orange juice and apple juice is AMAZING.

We arrived around 11 or so on a Thursday morning and were surprised to find the place packed. Luckily they have a back room as well so we only waited a few minutes to sit down. My husband had a cappucino while we waited and he raved about it - so much that he actually got another coffee at the end of our meal.The back room is nice because there's a lot of natural light coming in, even when it's a gray day. We decided to split a waffle with berry compote to start (great, unique as it's a bit crispy on the outside and soft on the inside). Then my husband got the breakfast paella and I got the cassoulet. Wow, both were amazing. We tried each others and then joked that we could switch halfway through as we both liked them both, but that didn't happen :) it was a really filling meal and the foccacia bread they make is perfect for scooping up the beans in the cassoulet. The fresh squeezed OJ was great too. Highly recommended."},{"name":"Golden Swan Restaurant","address":"5380 Victoria Drive","city":"Vancouver","stars":"3.5","text":"The food wasn't great.

However, I expect my order to be wrong, so I ALWAYS check now before I leave.This happens whether they are busy or not, so its not like my order is getting lost in the madness.I do like the fish tacos with the jalapeno sauce they use, so that is what keeps me coming back.

We are new to drinking Cortados and try to get it every time we find a new coffee joint.We really enjoyed the ambiance of the coffee shop, and despite the open space, it still felt warmer and cozier than Octane.

The workers were nice enough to hand out small little paper fans and cups of iced cold water to tame the heat because you wait in a line outside before you wait in another line inside. I sat outside under an umbrella they have for tables dining on the outside of the place while waiting for my boyfriend and friends to wait in lines to order. The burger bouncer dude told me to get up since the table was \\"reserved\\" and the people should be coming out any minute. Um, I've been sitting there for like 15-20 minutes before the little number (meaning it's reserved for a guest) ever even hit the table. I thought that was pretty rude. And the funny thing is, after I got up and waited in line inside, the waitress gave us a number and it ended up being the same table I was ALREADY SITTING AT THE WHOLE TIME.

That said, there isn't a whole lot else I dislike about Schmidt's.  The atmosphere, for one, can't be topped, although you should prepare to bump elbows with the guy at the next table, as this place is small and in demand.  I always start with the pretzel nuggets, which are the highlight of the entire menu, in my opinion, and put ballpark pretzels to shame -- especially when you slather them with the pungent mustard on the table.  The Bahama Burger Special is my favorite entree... just a big ol' slice of sausage on a bun.  It's supposedly \\"hot-n-spicy\\" but I don't get any heat; no matter, it's still delicious and goes perfectly with potato pancakes \\"und\\" applesauce.Schmidt's is a great place to take your visitors if you want to impress them without taking out a second mortgage.

I was expecting just a Blueberry taste but you can definitely taste a little hint of Bourbon bitterness, and the spice of the Basil. It is a fine crafted Donut that I thought would be my favorite. However, the Buttermilk Old Fashioned was even better. The crispy outside of the dough combined with the heaviness of the cake like batter won me over. Usually I prefer  Raised Yeast over Old Fashioned but, in this case, it was the opposite. The Buttermilk Old Fashioned is lightly glazed but just to the right amount to add a touch of sweetness on top of the dough.This place definitely portrays the saying quality over quantity.

For the non-spicy folks beware as the chicken come with a tad spicy kick. Another plus for Gus is the meat comes in a good size no matter what you're getting, which is a pleasant treat when you are craving for all the fried chicken in the world. No petite chickens here. I also love that the menu comes with a good option to mix and match dark and light meat. I'm taking off one star for their sides, which are merely average and pale in comparison to the chicken.

Nothing short of that would be expected from this Buckhead Life Group restaurant. For couples dining at Kyma, I would recommend ordering one of their whole fish options. These dishes might not be cheap, but undeniably, you will not regret it. Last time out we ordered the lavraki (seabass). If you are not a seafood lover or if you are expecting a Greek meal that is NOT seafood, this probably not the place for you... but that's not Kyma's fault. Your non-seafood options are things like Filet Mignon and Lamb Chops, which I'm sure are great, but there's really no reason to eat those if you do like seafood. The service is always top-notch and the interior is modern and chic. Kyma sets the bar very high for any restaurant in Atlanta to aspire to achieve.

I had to wait about eight minutes for her to fix a drink order during which she passed our table three times (she forgot to bring a slice of lime with the drink). The brewery has some of it's own brews but nothing really stood out. The food itself was very good I thought. I had a small pizza and the cheese and ingredients tasted great. I would go back, but wouldn't make a habit of it."},{"name":"Blue Star Donuts","address":"1155 SW Morrison St, Ste 102","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Yeah!

The service was hard to get used to, I once brought a friend who was so upset by one of the waitress that he accused her of being the \\"worst waitress ever\\". I was a little hesitant to go back after that, worried that loogies and other unidentifiable substances would appear in my scramble.

The food is excellent, provided you are looking for something that will fill your stomach and then some. Their bratwurst, mashed red potatoes, kraut...I haven't eaten anything there that was less than excellent, and I'm apparently not alone in that opinion, since Schmidt's has always been packed to capacity every time I've visited.Before you even enter, the ambiance is part-old world charm, part kitsch, but overall the place has a charming exterior and interior. It's a good thing that there's so much to catch the eye, because this brings us to the few negative aspects of Schmidt's.First, expect to wait a while for a table. The shortest wait I ever had at Schmidt's was half an hour, and it's my understanding that they do not accept reservations. Granted, I've only visited Schmidt's on weekends, so I can't speak to how long you'd expect to wait other days of the week.Second, once our meal was over, we had to wait forever for our check. I love a restaurant that doesn't hustle you out, but in this case, it was pretty clear we were ready to leave. Getting our check took around fifteen to twenty minutes. I suspect this might be a function of the server we had, as this is the first time that has happened.Overall, I'd definitely recommend Schmidt's for the excellent, affordable food and the atmosphere. I would not recommend it as a spot for a first date; Schmidt's is typically fairly noisy and it's definitely not the most intimate dining environment you'll encounter. I would definitely recommend it as a place you visit after you've known someone a while or with a group of friends or family members.I hope to visit again around Christmas, as I have to imagine that the charm of the place would be increased around the holidays, particularly with a fresh blanket of snow on the ground."},{"name":"Barcelona Wine Bar South End","address":"525 Tremont St","city":"Boston","stars":"4.5","text":"The service was excellent.

Eggs Benedict with bacon is fantastic - I could eat here every day !"},{"name":"Barley Swine","address":"6555 Burnet Rd, Ste 400","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"This review is from September 2013 when Barley Swine was still doing the a la carte menu. Barley Swine is quite small with enough room for about 30-40 diners at a time. The format at Barley Swine is small plates and they recommend 3-4 plates per person. Note: we enjoyed dinner here before they moved to a tasting menu format. At this time, the tasting menu is the only option. The menu looked so good! I was tempted to order one of everything but Adam and I decided to restrain ourselves a bit and start with 6 plates. Our server informed us that if we wanted to add on more dishes later, that would not be a problem.We started with a couple of drinks. Adam went with the Hops and Grain Red Rye Ale ($6) and I opted for the 2012 Gramona Sauvignon Blanc-Gewurztraminer from Penedes, Spain ($12). Adam had read about the various breweries in Austin that were producing some really great beers, so he started out the night with the red rye ale, which had a pronounced caramel malt flavor. My sauvignon blanc was light and refreshing with floral and fruity notes-a great way to start the meal.The crab salad, yogurt, chamomile, melon, crispy grains ($13) arrived soon after. The fresh melon and tart yogurt went beautifully with the sweet and savory crab salad. The crispy grains gave the whole dish some much needed texture due to all of the soft components. It was a lovely way to begin the meal.Adam was really loving trying all of the different Austin beers. Up next, he went with a Hops and Grain Pale Dog Pale Ale ($4). Adam enjoyed the maltiness and the little bit of fruity hops of this beer.The green chile bacon mousse, tomato, fried pork skin, potato ($10) had looked interesting and it definitely did not disappoint. The green chile bacon mousse had a great pork flavor mixed with a tinge of spice. It was an excellent accompaniment to the simply-prepared tomato, potato and the fried pork skin.At this point, I had finished my glass of wine and while looking through the menu a sake that was made in Austin caught my eye. Not something you see every day! Maybe it was due to our recent trip to Japan or the sheer novelty of it but after speaking with our server, I opted for the 4oz of the 2013 Tumbleweed Junmai sake ($14). It was different from other sakes that I have had but there was a nice tartness and grapefruit aroma to it.We had heard some great things about the scrambled egg, shiitake dumplings, smoked roe, almond ($13) and this dish was definitely not over-hyped. It was our favorite dish of the night! We even considered ordering a second but by the end of our meal, we were too stuffed. The creamy and slightly runny scrambled eggs with the delicate shiitake dumplings bursting with flavor was incredible. Getting a bit of all of the ingredients was a fantastic mix of creamy eggs with the umami-filled dumpling with the smoky and fishy roe finished with the crunch from the almonds. A really unique dish that made us go back for every last drop. If we hadn't been in public, we would have licked the plate clean!At this point in the meal, I decided to switch back to wine and went with the 2012 Ch√¢teau de Pampelonne ros√© from Provence, France ($12). This light and airy ros√© had a dry and fruity finish that was perfect for the hot weather in Austin.Since Adam is originally from New Orleans and I'm a sucker for all Louisiana cuisine, we definitely wanted to try Barley Swine's interpretation of gulf shrimp, andouille, stewed okra, hushpuppy, hollandaise ($13). We loved that they even fried the shrimp head for us to enjoy. The crispy shrimp head went well with the perfectly cooked - and sweet - shrimp. The light yellow/green rings on top were pickled peppers that added a vinegar-y, spicy  and crunchy addition to the dish. While the elements were all very New Orleans-esque, the spices used were much more Austin. It was a great melding of the two cuisines.Adam was enjoying the Hops and Grain brewery beers and decided to order the The One They Call Zoe Pale Lager ($4), which our server mentioned was her favorite beer. Adam absolutely loved it and ended up ordering it many, many more times during our time in Austin. Adam enjoyed this hopped lager with bright citrus and flowery flavors. I'm not usually a beer drinker but agreed that this was one was light and easy to drink.There were a few specials on the blackboard at the front of restaurant and after taking a look, we opted for the pig tongue with refried hill peas, grilled okra and hot sauce. We're suckers for offal. The pig tongue was perfectly cooked and if you didn't know it was pig tongue, it would have passed for many other cuts of meat. The tongue was tender, seasoned well and grilled giving it a great crust on the outside. The peas and okra helped to lighten the dish a bit and the hot sauce helped to cut through the fattiness of the dish.For the rest of the review and photos: http://adamandvivian.com/"},{"name":"FLIP burger boutique","address":"1587 Howell Mill Rd","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"I came here with very high expectations being a fan of Richard's from this time on Top Chef.

Though their prices are a bit higher than average (some of the per slice rates on their specialty pizzas are as high as $4.75), they use top quality ingredients and often come out making you feel like you got what you paid for. Some of their more awesome additions include: Pulled Pork Pizza (bam!), Eggplant with Basil Pesto, Shrimp, Bacon & Sausage, and so forth.One of the best bonuses about this place is that all of the tables have bottles of honey on them, for dipping your crust into when you are finished: free dessert. I don't know why I've not seen more places do that: it's a great idea and that alone makes me want to go back to Mojo.In addition to their variety in toppings, they have a ton of other choices in the realm of sandwiches. The calzone was a little small, so I don't know that I'd recommend it. They also have quite a selection of wine and beer.

I was in town this past weekend in Austin for a bachelor party and multiple Lyft drivers recommended Gus's and man am I glad I went. Gus's can be considered both a fast food joint and a sit down restaurant. They offer tons of seating and works great for small parties or large groups. Just make sure you go early or be prepared to wait as it is always busy.  I got in near opening on Saturday and it was pretty packed already.From initial glance Gus's is your typical fried chicken place that offers all the fares of comfort food. They sell chicken by the piece or you can get large combo orders. They have your typical sides ranging from mac & cheese to potato salad.My group and I put in a large combo order for 30+ mixed chicken and sides that included baked beans, cole slaw, potato salad, and fried pickles.The side orders were all very delicious but the fried pickles stand above them all. The pickle was so delicious because they use the perfect amount of batter where it didn't taste like just dough. Eat this fresh you will not regret it!The chicken was unbelievably good. I must say the chicken at Gus's is 1 one of my top 3 favorites of all time. The skin was very crispy and tasty. It had the perfect amount of seasoning on it and was crispy enough to really hear that crunch. There is nothing more satisfying that hearing that perfect crunch when you bite into fried chicken. The inside however is where things get even more delicious. The meat was ridiculously juicy. I am not sure how they do it but each chicken was perfect. You can dip it with sauce if you like but the seasoning itself is good enough to enjoy without it. Once you eat a bite it is almost impossible to stop. I definitely found my new love.Overall, Gus's World Famous Fried Chicken lives up to its name. The ridiculously delicious chicken will have me coming back the next time I am in Austin. In fact, I may have to make a quick weekend trip soon just to have this again!"},{"name":"Golden Swan Restaurant","address":"5380 Victoria Drive","city":"Vancouver","stars":"3.5","text":"Just working on dinner now @ this classic Chinese restaurant.

Having not had any Asian food for the entirety of the trip and not having eaten all day, I ordered both the Dan Dan noodles and the Nasi Goreng.  The Dan Dan noodles had a good amount of heat (as it should for a Sichuan dish) and the texture was great.  However it was too salty.  Balance is important in a Dan Dan dish just because there are a lot of dominant-tasting ingredients, but I mostly tasted salt.  The Nasi Goreng was nice, but something felt like it was missing.  Normally I am a fried rice fiend and will go into a trance where I wake up and the fried rice is gone, but I couldn't get into this dish.

If it's not, I dare say you'll probably still enjoy yourself.This is going to sound lame, but one of my favorite parts about this place is the way they use the cardboard carriers that beer comes in to house their hot sauce, ketchup, salt, pepper, etc.  It's just do dang cute.I like the patio at Cain and Abels -- in fact, I've never sat inside before.  I always order fried pickles, which are good but not the best.  Really, it all boils down to the fact it's just a fun place to hang out with friends and drink beer.I'm vegetarian, so I don't really have a lot of options because their selection is mostly limited to the typical bar food offerings.  However, they do have a really great field greens salad with a balsamic vinagerette and blue cheese.  It's not cheap, but it's good.They allow under-agers in before 7PM, which is nice.  And every Monday night during the school year they have INCREDIBLE specials on their huge, juicy cheeseburgers.  You can get one for like under $3 bucks!  As I said, I'm a vegetarian, but my friend swears by them!"},{"name":"Lower Mills Tavern","address":"2269 Dorchester Ave","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"This was my 2nd time here..and ooh it will NOT be my last. I was greeted at the bar by one of the most competent, friendly bartenders I have met in a long time named Taylor. This is saying something because I personally do not drink alcohol and sometimes bartenders tend to \\"skip over\\" me at the bar, Taylor did not and her service was impeccable. Back to the meal, I ordered the Mixed greens salad and it was more than fresh....Need I say more? Entree time: when I go to any restaurant I have to try the steak tips. It is pretty much a measuring stick for me. These tips came with  cheddar and scallion mashed potatoes, sauteed spinach, crispy shallots and garlic bread. I ordered them medium rare and they were cooked to perfection. The combination of all the above was something I truly took my time enjoying, which was rare for me. :)  If you are looking for a great neighborhood restaurant with a great atmosphere and outstanding service, try the Lower Mills Tavern. I am from Gloucester and plan on going there much more often now.
