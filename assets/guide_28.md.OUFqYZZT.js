I say this first because what I'm about to tell you may initially have you saying, \\"pass\\". I've been to multiple ramen places around metro-Atlanta including those in Duluth/Gwinnett area and this place would make it to the first round of my ramen draft. Not a #1 or #2 pick but top 5. \\n\\nSo is there a theme with ramen joints that it should have hella limited seating? I swear it's a thing. Well seating is very limited with both indoor (table & bar) and outdoor seating. You're guaranteed to be waiting 30/40 mins - an hour whether you come during the week or on the weekend. Came here around 7PM on a Thursday = an hour wait for first available. Same time  on a Saturday = 40 minute wait for first available inside. Parking isn't an issue. \\n\\nIt's a nice place to go for any occasion whether it be just a casual dinner or a date! Just do not take a large group of more than like 4 people. EVER. Unless you just don't want to eat. Hunger and Mario Kart have one thing in common...it can make you choose one thing over your friends. \\n\\nIt's a bit expensive. The ramen bowl is a good size bowl. Not too small but not a large/medium pho size bowl you typically see at pho restaurants. It's a upside down cone shaped bowl so in appearance it looks big but it's small. If you order a combination, you will leave adequately full. Not like Nori Nori/KBBQ shameful regret full, but like I can walk to my car and chase Pokemon if I have to full.\\n\\nYou're looking at $11-14 per ramen bowl. The combination option, which includes two appetizers of a small salad and dumplings or curry rice or something else, will add another $4-5. Look at the photos I posted. You get the combination and you will leave satisfied. I didn't like the salad. Dressing was funky tasting. The Tokyo Curry Rice was delicious! The Tonkotsu Spicy Ramen was awesome! The noodles were cooked so that it wasn't hard but not too soft, which is important because you don't want your noodles to get soggy while you eat nor do you want to be eating tree limbs. \\n\\nI feel this place is a bit on the more expensive side, but I would still come back for sure. Good service, cool atmosphere, and good food."},{"name":"Andina Restaurant","address":"1314 NW Glisan St","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"I had really high hopes for this place and although it was good it wasn't amazing.

The waitress, Cara that we had last night was incredible.  All four of us at the table have worked in the restaurant industry in the past, and it is sometimes hard to just sit back and relax when we go out. Cara nailed it with wine suggestions, timing of the courses, and overall knowledge of the menu. She was friendly and enthusiastic and we all really appreciated that. She really helped make our night special, and to be honest - if the food was terrible I would still probably come back.  Also - I think David? was the bartender, and he made our drinks perfectly and did not even hesitate when we started asking him for something off menu.

I know this because the first time I walked into the small, masterfully-lit establishment, I felt party to an immaculate conception. It was instant. In evidence: a lush cluster of small chandeliers, room center; re-purposed wood, fashioned into tall table stools; a handsome bar area, complete with equally-handsome and knowledgeable barkeeps; a $35 menu for any three menu items - and you can elect to have all three be desserts. Why would I not be with child immediately upon learning this? It is only the right thing to do.\\n\\nI did not have three desserts, if you can believe it. Instead, I have been three times to make sure I try as may items as possible, though it is difficult to not gravitate towards favorites. The menu is seasonal, and while the theme is French, it isn't the sickness-inducing, overly-rich food I associate with French cuisine. My visits have featured appearances by the rabbit terrine, persimmon and arugula salad, poha-crusted fish, antelope with liver, and pistachio custard. \\n\\n...That I recall. One of these dining experiences was during a splendiferous engagement party, and our meals were perfectly paired with wine so... I can't tell you what happened towards the end of that meal. Maybe immaculate conception. Or mortal conception. I don't know. But I do know that everything - every single sauce, drizzle, persimmon seed, fish-crusting component, server recommendation - was impossibly wonderful. For the engagement party, we sat in the gorgeous outside area to start, and I become exhausted trying to communicate the magic - The Magic - of it all. Whimsical and stunningly lovely in a way that things no longer are. \\n\\nThe good news is there's a specialized power field at the front threshold that undoes unwanted celestial knocked-uppedness upon leaving the restaurant.

You just can't find them in the states very easily (closest I've found is Bahn Mi) and the website menu sounded like the real deal. \\n\\nI went and first ordered a chocolate torte, cafe au lait with soy milk and a slice of cake to go. Haven't tried the cake yet, but the torte was amazing. Rich, dark, dense layers of fudgy chocolate ganache and thick, dark cake. I couldn't even finish it. It would've been great paired with a good coffee cut with milk, but when I got my drink it tasted like hot water and a little soy milk - barely any coffee. I guess my bad for ordering with soy milk and ordering a cafe au lait at all. It was horrible. I suggest sticking to French press or any of their regular coffees with refills and make your own. Also, these 3 things were expensive - reasonably so for delicious, delicious baked goods, but my wallet hurt a little. Especially after seeing how small their baguette sandwiches are (esp compared to the ones in France, and those were better quality and offered a side and drink for 4 euros, so comparable pricing).\\n\\nThen I ordered two sandwiches to go (one for me and one for my sister). I ordered the chicken salad on a croissant for her and asked for the Jambon et Fromage (written LITERALLY as that and described as \\"Ham with cheese\\" on the menu). I was asked by the staff if I want cheese. Yes. I said. I want cheese. Its a Jambon et Fromage sandwich. He informed me the cheese was extra. I stared incredulously. \\"Excuse me? But its a Jambon et Fromage- its ham and cheese sandwich. And it doesn't come with cheese?\\" So I switched my order to a Turkey and Brie sandwich and paid my $13 plus tip and sat down. It took a long time for my sandwiches to come out. I left to meet my sister after checking that there were two and the top one was chicken salad. \\n\\nThey got my order wrong. Instead of turkey and brie, I received a turkey-cheddar-bacon melt on a greasy croissant (the ones at highland bakery or, hell, even Dunkin Donuts are comparable) and by then it was cold. I was pretty unhappy. The chicken salad has dijon in it and its noticeable, but it tastes like they've added sugar or simple syrup or something. Straight sugar. Nor even apples or grapes. I remember reading a chef's comment that \\"if something isn't made well, people adjust it with sugar and salt.\\" I don't know how its made, but I've had better from McDonalds. The stuff with the nuts and apples. Yeah. \\n\\nTL;DR: Their baked goods are pretty good if you live nearby and want to pay for \\"french pastries\\" without going too far. Stick to the plain coffees or make your own. Bring your own lunch. Or get the pate sandwich and pay a lot for not a ton of sandwich. It's pretty good. I'm pretty unimpressed and won't be paying for their sandwiches or more than a cup of black coffee while meeting friends.

I decided to see what the hype is about at this restaurant. I didn't have reservations so I sat at the oyster bar for starters. I started with a variety of oysters, which were good but not any more special than the local oyster bar. Surprisingly I ordered around 9 oysters and recieved 4 crackers. (really) The  peel and eat shrimp were very sweet and juicy but unfortunately, it seemed like they dropped the shrimp in an Old Bay seasoning bucket. I love spice but that was over the top. I then had the lobster roll which was good but definately not worth the $21 price tag. I have had better or comparable lobster rolls in Atlanta for less. The star or the night for me was the grilled octopus. This had flavors bursting throughout my mouth. The drinks were very good especially the shots with the oyster.I tried the pickle juice shot and it was surprisingly very smooth. \\nThe biggest issue of the night was the staff. The bartender had the personality of a saltine cracker. She was not rude but not engaging or having a personality. I tried to engage her in conversation and all the time thinking- how did you get this job? I had to ask for water 3 or 4 times and she was right in front of me. She actually filled her own water glass a couple of times before filling mine. Go figure.  The guy who was cooking was creepy and all the time staring  making the stay quite uncomfortable. maybe I was looking for a different vibe based on all the reports of this place being the \\"IT\\" place to be. Maybe I will check it out on the weekends and it may be different. I might suggest giving the bartender a shot or two to loosen up a bit."},{"name":"Voodoo Doughnut - Old Town","address":"22 SW 3rd Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"This place was highly recommended by a friend of mine to check out during my visit last week.

Oh, did I mention long line and hard parking? Yep. I came in the morning around 9ish. There was anot-so-long line but since there's 6 cash register, it went fast. I suggest choose which doughnut you want while in line (and don't go overboard like I did) and don't forget to bring CASH. They only  take cash, however, they have ATM machine inside (it was broken when I was there). We got the voodoo doll, capt crunch, cock-and-ball, mafia, etc... All were good."},{"name":"Lenoir","address":"1807 S 1st St","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"My wife and I went with another couple on May 3, 2012. Four people is the perfect number here as you can have one of everything and share. That's what we did. For what we had, the food pricing is very reasonable, something we appreciate and applaud. The cheapest red wine -- a delightful Granache Sablet -- was $40, which isn't stratospheric by any means, but it would have been nice to see a couple of well chosen $26-32 bottles (and we would have had more than one!). One of us had white by the glass. We all liked the wine.  \\n\\nThe menu is divided between green, land & sea, and dessert.  All of the very fresh. locally sourced vegetable dishes were a big hit.  The way the loquat sherbert mixed with the tomato salad with hints of tamarind was unique and wonderful. I loved the course stone-ground mustard sauce under the artichokes; everybody had their forks in the chickpea panisse. What a great start!  \\n\\nWhen we got to \\"land\\" and \\"sea,\\" our favorite was the fluke crudo, which  was outstanding!  Reminding us of one of the best innovative dishes at  sushi standouts like Tomo or Unchi, it was a delight in every respect.  The shrimp grits dish was good but did not dazzle.  Nice big plump shrimp and good grits, but a bit pedestrian for the hype this place has generated. The game plate (I called it the Hudson-on-the-Bend special) featured quail, rabbit, and surprisingly good goat (not called cabrito here, which is brave). All were devoured but none rocked our world.  Overall, I would go back only for the fluke, but had no complaints about the others. \\n\\nDessert was a favorite, on a par with the fluke: the mango tart with plump blackberries was so good, we ordered another to split. The chocolate creme was also very nice. Be sure to at least split a dessert here.  They do it very well.\\n\\nSo, to sum it up: great place for people who like innovative cuisine with the freshest ingredients.  A tiny place, not snooty or stuffy. Our waiter was informative, not afraid to share his personal opinions (a nice touch).  He was very well acquainted not only with the wines (his forte) but all the menu items.  He was pleasant, helpful and non-intrusive. Perfect! \\n\\nThe food was very very good.  I place Lenoir in the same category as Wink and Barley Swine -- smaller, chef-owner places driven by innovation and whatever is fresh today.  Wink's menu changes daily; Lenoir and Barley Swine seem to have a new menu only every month or so.  I know the owners put their hearts and soul into this place and I do not want to be negative about what was a very nice evening at a very reasonable price, but  if there was room for improvement, it would be in the land and sea entrees.  I found the entrees other than the fluke a bit less exciting than Barley Swine and the experience not as polished as at Wink. Given the hype and the RAVE review in the local Austin-American MIStstatesman, I expected a bit more of a dazzle factor in terms of the explosion of unexpected and amazing flavors -- something accomplished with the  loquat sherbert and tomatoes (and again with the mango tart), but not anywhere else.  I'm no chef and can't give advice, but to maintain the buzz, the combinations of flavors on the entree items needs to be dialed up to a little more of a \\"wow!\\" like I have experienced so many times at Wink and Barley Swine. Throw in a $28 red and a $30 white, and I'll be back as often as the menu changes. Great job by owners, servers and kitchen for a place open only a few weeks!"},{"name":"Voodoo Doughnut - Old Town","address":"22 SW 3rd Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"Tourist trap with mediocre doughnuts.

Apparently, I was charged 18% mandatory tips, or about  $17 bucks (not sure if this is the living social stuff, or couple meal stuff).  On my way out, (upon receptionist's question), told her that it could've been better.  Manager came out and game me the free entree voucher, which was nice of him.   All night long, my little one was having a stomach ache, while I also had the cramp in my stomach (I had a couple of bites on her grilled sandwich).   I'm not sure if the grill sandwich is the reason behind or not, but it's too coincidental.  As for the free entree, probably I'll toss it to the trash bin...

The cheese that has built up on the side of the pan gets brown and crunchy and thats why the corners are the best part of a Detroit pie!!! explaning that just made my mouth water!! \\n\\nSo I walked up and met the crew!! the place is awesome and the owner has a bunch of Detroit tattoos!! He is awesome and really laid back and chilled!! I love this trailer and I love that a little piece of back home landed a home in Austin!!!\\n\\nYOU HAVE GOT TO CHECK IT OUT!!! GET THE CADILLAC PIZZA!!!  it is all good!!!!\\n\\nI cant wait to go back!!!\\n\\nDETROIT LOVE!!"},{"name":"King + Duke","address":"3060 Peachtree Rd NW","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"First visit to King + Duke.

Both were good, although I didn't find the deviled eggs anything above what I couldn't make at home. I then ordered the NY Strip for my main course but, be warned, it is super salty. I couldn't even eat more than a third with the salt overload. I wish they would lay off the seasoning so I could have tasted more of the actual meat but if you like salt, then go for it.

The non-vegetarian favorite is their veggie burger with the spicy pesto - definitely a dish I recommend to those dining at Bouldin for the first time or bringing their non-veggie friends. Their BLT is just as delicious. Put the pesto on everything - it is godlike and it's almost tragic they don't sell it separately because I would love to put it on everything I eat at home.\\n\\nTheir pink lady drinks are easily my favorite thing about Bouldin Creek.

With the successes of other wonderful Atlanta eateries (JCT, No 246) under his belt, I was nothing but OPTIMISTIC when I was told we had gotten a reservation at Ford's new sustainable seafood place on my latest visit to Atlanta! Optimistic ... AND excited!  \\n\\nSo, let's (again) get the basics out of the way:  \\n\\nTHE ATMOSPHERE:  Smith Hanes did a wonderful job with this project.  The main dining area and bar are open and airy and bright, yet still cozy.  For a moment you believe you're in the warehouse district, but then you feel like you're in your  favorite local watering hole.  And, I can only think of the words \\"upscale beach\\" to describe the Oyster Bar (Think: The Hamptons and Destin collide, gracefully).  The scene is hip.  It's a \\"true\\" hip, though - one that you know is here to stay.  And with so many restaurants coming and going in Atlanta, that has to be a great feeling.  And, stay, they want from you - When I sat down, I felt I was in for the long-(gastronomic) haul.  It was comforting to know that they want you to come in, sit for a spell and \\"enjoy\\" your meal, instead of rushing your table out the door.  And \\"enjoy\\" I did - BOY oh BOY did I ENJOY!  Could it be that I was dining with some of my favorite folks, one of whom just happens to run the largest seafood distributor in the SE?   I think not.  I think that's just how they do it there - there was no special treatment for me (other than I got a first hand narrative of what was yummy on the menu that night).   Ford wants you to feel comfortable and enjoy yourself (i.e., you can play putt putt out front) - simple as that.    \\n\\nTHE BAR:  ohhh yesssss ... the bar.  Where it all began.  For starters, it's gorgeous - a towering wall of glass and bottles.  And it's comfy for \\"a drink at the bar\\" kinda evening.  It also serves up some crafty cocktails: The Truth as We Know it martini of pink gin and bitters, the Port Antonio, which is a couple different rums, Kahlua and cinnamon, The Old Salty Dog , which was my first choice of the night, and, as it always goes with this group, BUBBLES!  They've also got some tasty craft beer behind the bar, and if that doesn't do it for ya, well, order yourself a Miller High Life!    Now, for the good part ...\\n\\nTHE FOOD:  Where to start?  Of course seafood was in my repertoire for the evening, whether I was eating from my own plate or from the plate of others at the table!  We started with the oysters - In fact, we liked those so much we got a dozen ... then some more, and they were served with these  homemade crackers to die for (I will settle for nothing less while eating oysters now - Guess I better let the folks down at AJs know before next my next beach trip).  We had all three salads: Simple Salad with the shaved celery and herbs (my plate), a Little Gem Salad with the meyer lemon and anchovy dressing, and a spicy arugula salad with the peaches and Farmer's cheese - all were absolutely tasty and beautifully presented.  Since the papa-bear didn't want a salad, he indulged in the Angels on Horseback, which are fried oysters with pork belly, and served with these amazing little \\"toast points\\" - a decadent griddled piece of bread (like grilled cheese without the cheese - they needed their own top billing on the menu, IMHO). One of the young ladies at the table ordered the mussels with the spicy green curry broth, and I have to say that I'm thankful I was seated directly to her left - so I could taste that TOO.  \\n\\nAll of that yumminess was followed by our main dishes:  Alaskan Halibut, plated with grilled Hen of the Wood (mushroom), a red snapper dish, the roasted Georgia trout, served with marcona almonds and a pickled celery, the Fish & Chips (three cheers for my choice), which was ale battered haddock (traditional), and for the one meat-eater at the table, the skirt steak with a romesco sauce, which was out of this world.  Not a complaint at the table.  \\n\\nAs if that wasn't enough, we still wanted more, believe it or not.   However, we needed a little break in our consumption activities, and decided to utilize the 7 minute drive home for that very purpose.  But we took home one of each of the FIVE items on the dessert menu that evening - the buttermilk donuts (served with sweet corn ice cream and pepper jam!) were my favorite, but the chocolate \\"cloud\\" was a wicked treat, too!\\n\\nChef Adam Evans - who is from THIS side of the time zone, (Muscle Shoals), went to Auburn and worked his way around the Craft family of restaurants after he left New Orleans and the Brennans - will not disappoint!

Definitely recommend ordering from the top level's donut options on these rotating examples for you to see and choose from. The ones are the top are the fun flavors and much larger in size than he bottom layer ones. My favorite part of this place is the unique exterior and interior decor. Glittery brick walls with pink metal separaters for the line. Inside had a large fake donut on the ceiling with two very interestingly designed chandeliers to go with the theme of the shop.

I would definitely recommend the restaurant invest in a water purification system . It tasted like aquarium water . now om to dinner. I had the mongolian beef it was just plain gross.  I paid $18 for a bunch of soggy onions and very little beef.  The other people in my party were also very disappointed in the menu. You get sub par Chinese food at highend prices.

I can't make up my mind on if this should be my last visit. \\n\\nI've been raving about Mary Macs all week. I even set up a date. My date was more excited than I was.\\n\\nWe decide to go for dinner instead of after church, so that we avoid the Big after church crowd. We get there are 530-6 and kick up to find parking right in front of the restaurant. So far so good. \\n\\nThere's a small crowd so we're told that it would be a 15 minute wait. No biggie. I get it. We maybe waited 5 minutes before they have a table for us. Boom! Great start. That was pretty awesome.\\n\\nWe're at the table and our serve comes, we order tea for our drinks and take about 10 mins to look over the menu. When she comes back, we say \\"we're ready to order\\"...she reminds us that we have to write our order on the little slips they give you. Cool. No problem, that was my fault. Maybe ten minutes later she finally comes back to pick up the slips. \\n\\nI order a seafood combo with catfish and shrimp and my date orders fried chicken. The food comes out fast. Like super fast. The only problem was: they brought both of us fried chicken. I don't trip, I just look for my server. She's nowhere to be found. It's be just under ten minutes. I grab another server to ask her to for help finding my server and she says \\"nooo honey I can help you\\". She was very nice. She took the food over to my server and told her there was a mistake. The server didn't believe it at first and thought that I wrote fried chicken but she quickly realized that she made the mistake. I'm annoyed now because it took 15 minutes to bring my corrected plate. Which was a tad disappointing. 8 shrimp and a catfish filet that's on the smaller end. Honestly It would have been better had I kept the chicken plate. It wasn't worth the money. The food was great but the seafood wasn't worth it. \\n\\nSo we get a Togo box, we only needed on because I finished all of my food. I'm telling you, it wasn't much at all. After we get a Togo box, she refills our tea...and disappears for 20 more minutes!!!!! When she finally came back, she still didn't have the check. So we ask her for the check. She brings it, I Check to see if we were atleast given free sweet teas because of the terrible service....nope!\\n\\nI left left a very small tip. I wanted to leave no tip but that goes against everything I believe. I'm a heavy tipper typically and I am one of those people that tend to tip to \\"make up for any bad tips some people may leave\\" it sucked to not really til her, but I had no choice.

It gives you a glimpse into a home kitchen complete with the welcoming family. We tried the vegetable platter and the tilapia along with a meat patty appetizer. This was only our second taste of Ethiopian food, and I was holding my breath hoping that the food was good. \\n\\nAlthough it took a while for our food to get to the table, it was well worth the wait. The food was more flavorful than the food we had at the other restaurant we had gone to. It was awesome! I now want to learn how to cook Ethiopian food!

I get a clean, fresh arugula salad, limoncello and Salsiccia peperoni pizza every time. I've yet to leave unhappy from the food. One thing I particularly like about Pizzeria Locale is their menu layout. The pizza is divided between red and white sauce options. There is never ever this  experience of getting a pizza that is not what you thought it would be because you weren't careful enough to read every ingredient (because you were so excited to have pizza and assumed that it would be red sauce. What business does pepperoni have commingling with white sauce on a pizza crust?). If I get a pizza, even with the most amazing ingredients, and it has white sauce/olive oil, I am not excited. \\nTheir gluten free crust is delicious, though I prefer the traditional. It's best to get your own pizza too, unless you're sharing equally, but beware, someone is going to get robbed, there are no pizza rollers to be seen in this establishment. \\nThe interior is industrial-chic-vintage-subway tile bathroom-esc. Tiled places are delightful, think Casamento's in NOLA or Grand Central Station oyster bar.- but new and improved. Pizzeria Locale always has gorgeous fresh flowers and pleasant, helpful staff, two extra gold stars in my book."},{"name":"Fresh To Order","address":"1260 Cumberland Mall","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"If you're tired of processed, fried food; give Fresh to Order a try.

Back to the Newsburg, I loved every bit of it except for the volcano pastry in the middle, which I would be more than happy to do without since it didn't seem like a necessary piece in the dish with all the rice.

The interior is beautiful, but still cozy, like you can let your hair down and really enjoy the experience! Our waiter, Billy, is freaking hilarious. We've had him twice and he really knew how to give the full dinning experience between really great *and honest* recommendations and just being entertaining! I will ask to be in his section again if I'm going for the full dinner.\\n\\nMy 2 only complaints are that it's mandatory valet, which caused a bit of a wait, and we didn't know on our first trip and had to scrounge for cash to tip. However, their tips go to a charity and the valets are paid hourly, which I think is awesome, so I don't mind the wait and giving a bit back to the community, especially after indulging at 2UL! :)\\n\\nThe only other bummer thing is that our 2nd trip, we set closer to the bar, in a booth, but the band was so loud, we couldn't hear ourselves across the table - and we're loud people! \\n\\nAnyway, it's a great date place, I totally recommend it!"},{"name":"Frank","address":"407 Colorado St","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"That bananas foster.

We went for the music as my fiance's sister knew the band. The band was great. If you like jazz, they were excellent. Everything else was odd.\\n\\nThe place was packed, every chair was used. It was hard walking between the tables. After a while I realized that there were only two employees, one person acting as the bartender/waiter, and the actual waiter who may have been doubling in part as a cook. There were about three or four other people just helping out intermittently. But they were affiliated with the band in some fashion. It was a strange evening. The friends of the band wanted the evening to go well, so they were clearing tables and helping move chairs around etc.\\n\\nThe actual staff was trying but how can only two people server 40+ people? One person said they were short-staffed, but that seems to be a consistent complaint. After we were seated we had to beg someone to serve us, the bartender brought one round of drinks and appetizers, and that was it for well over an hour. The owner obviously needs to hire more help. That's blindingly obvious.\\n\\nWe eventually were able to order dinner, but it took so long to come out we would have canceled it if we could have. By the time we caught someone's attention they said the food was already cooking and almost done. The meals were simply prepared and competently done, but it over-priced for what you got. The portions were very small, the ingredients were not expensive, and it was something you could easily make at home. The drinks were so-so.\\n\\nIf we had to do it all over again, we would have eaten somewhere else first and just ordered two bottles of wine as soon as we arrived.

So with the high reputation that Home Slice has w/pizza lovers, and being set in the heart of SoCo, a true Austin hood, this was my designation to satisfy my taste buds and get on my way to become \\"One w/The City of Austin.\\"  \\n\\nI ordered from the outside window and being mid-afternoon, the service was quick, but sorta felt a lack of atmosphere sitting outside waiting for my slice of pie. Venturing inside I felt like I walked through a space time continuoum and landed into a wet dream version of pizza heaven. Seeing the decor and the spirit of the people, and especially the employees, I could feel my ch'i rising like as if Super Mario had just gotten a magic mushroom. I've always had a dream of walking into a pizzeria and seeing someone behind the counter throwing pizza up in the air and catching it and throwing it back up again, with some sizzlin tunes in the back. Home Slice made that dream come true within a matter of seconds of walking in. \\n\\nSeveral minutes later after oodling my surroundings & the cute counter girl, my name was called for my slice of pie. First impression honestly wasn't that impressive. I had heard that the slices were larger than the norm, but mine seemed like to norm. Initially I thought I might have gotten the runt out of the group, but everybody elses slices seemed the same size.  Being NY style, I knew I wasn't going to get full with just one slice, but considering the price, almost $4.00/slice, I didn't want to go broke just trying to satisfy my appetite, cuz it can get costly at times. \\n\\nBut moving onto the slice itself, I'm sorta glad that I didn't order 2 slices, cuz the taste just wasn't anything special. There weren't any ingredients that \\"Oooh'd\\" or \\"Awwe'd\\" me or made me put on my Chandler face (http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2149/1966584925_5d4062a647.jpg ). For almost $4.00/slice, I really was expecting more in the taste bud department.  Now maybe I don't have enough NY experiences in my life to be a fair judge on their style of pizza. But idolizing the Ninja Turtles growing up, I did my part to give all pizza a chance. \\n\\nFrom my standpoint, I think the heart & soul of this place is within its location + decor + service, not within their pizza.

The way that the staff treated us, worked with our party, and generally went out of the way to make sure that we were ok--and the KIDS were doing well, was just completely amazing.  The customer service was hands down the best we've ever had in town.  \\n\\nFrom the garlic knots to keep the kids from being to whiny, to giving then dough to play with and be entertained at the table, and even having storage for our stroller, it was as though the team at Home Slice thought of everything.  Home Slice has been a go to for my partner and I for a while, but after our experience Saturday night, I can easily say it will be a family favorite for a long time! \\n\\nA shout out to the manager that was there Saturday night and the amazing host.

I got the Arnold Palmer--lemon filling with strawberry frosting. The icing was thick and gummy kinda like toothpaste. The donut part was okay in terms of moisture and texture and all that. I couldn't get through the donut without wigging out from the sugar high. My sister liked her coco puff donut though!

You see, I try to hit up the Red Pagoda on a regular basis. A very regular basis. Don't judge me by my check-in count; I tend to stroll through their doors once per week.\\n\\nSo, what keeps me coming back? Easy: the vegetarian peanut pho. Filled with a generous portion of veggies, tofu and rice noodles served in a rich peanut broth, I haven't found any dish quite like it in the city. I'm quite shocked that other Vietnamese restaurants haven't caught on yet, actually. To top it off, at ten bucks a pop (including tip), it's an affordable indulgence that keeps my vegan heart happy. For the non-veggies out there, they also serve a chicken or beef version of this dish. That being said, you don't get the vegetables in the broth, so my meat-eating boyfriend even prefers the vegetarian version. \\n\\nThe Red Pagoda offers take-away, but unless you have giant ramen bowls at home, do yourself a favour and just dine in.

I was stunned to see two $25 corkage charges on our check.  Now, most restaurants will charge a corkage fee, though there are some very good ones that don't.  And I understand.  There are glasses to be washed, and that risk breakage.  And the server has to be attentive in keeping glasses refreshed.  Our server never bothered pouring, nor did we get new glasses when we switched from white to red.

It isn't really close to anything central, but if you need a hotel in town, do consider this converted elementary school.  It's fun and inspired and unlike any place else I've ever seen.  This is my 900th review.  McMenamins skips the queue because I love it.\\n\\nWe stayed in the Counting Room.  All of the rooms occupy former classrooms, and ours had a cute counting theme.  It was spacious and comfortable, though not opulent I suppose.  The bathroom and shower were on the small side and we weren't sleeping on thousand dollar sheets.  There were no TVs or mini-bars.  McMenamins is not a five star hotel, if that's what you're looking for, but it's awesome enough to make it worth the stay if you don't need your pillows fluffed and shoes shined.\\n\\nThe out-of-the-way location of the hotel was not a problem for a couple of reasons.  First, it was actually very close to adorable Alberta street, where we spent the evening walking around and getting dinner.  Second, the hotel itself was a bottomless source of entertainment.\\n\\nThere was booze everywhere.  The hotel is home to a handful of bars, from the tiny Detention Room to the massive two story Boiler Room.  We took advantage of a few, all of which served a McMenamins menu.  Some portion of the beer is brewed on the premises in a two hundred square foot microwbrewery of which we got a quick tour.  I loved that we were allowed to take beers pretty much anywhere in the building.  Most of the time when I stay at hotels, I feel like I'm staying in a room and just a room.  At the Kennedy School I felt like I was sleeping in one corner of a giant playhouse.\\n\\nAs for the booze quality, I wouldn't say it was top notch but certainly decent, and I went to bed very happy.  We tried a few beers, my favorite of which was the Hammerhead.  There was a raspberry beer in there, too, the Ruby, which I didn't actually care for.  I also had a sweet tea cocktail in the Boiler Room that was pretty tasty.  I wouldn't recommend the food.  We munched on Cajun tots and fries.  The tots were passable, but the fries were terrible.  They weren't even fried all the way, just oily half-raw potato.\\n\\nEven if I weren't a guest at McMenamins, I would've loved to visit just for the movie theater.  I wish so badly that I could tear it from the ground and forcibly transport it to Los Angeles.  Since we were staying at the hotel, we got complimentary entry to all movie showings.  As it turns out, the tickets only cost $3.  For a quarter of the cost of your average movie outing, you get an absolutely unique experience.  There aren't a lot of options and most of them are kind of dated, but it doesn't even matter.  Movie \\"posters\\" in the ticket area are drawn in chalk on a blackboard.  We saw Cyrus and I really enjoyed the movie.  The movie itself could've been a lot worse, though, without ruining the evening.  We got a pitcher of beer to watch it with and settled into one of hundreds of broken-in sofas set up in long comfortable rows.  If this theater were in my neighborhood I would go every single weekend.\\n\\nAs you can tell, we got a lot out of the Kennedy School in a single night's stay.  All told, our bill was a little under $180, for the room and all our food and drink, with movie tickets and parking included.  If we'd had our swimsuits, we would've taken advantage of the soaking pool, too.  I was absolutely taken with the magic of McMenamins.  It was an unforgettable night, and it alone was worth the trip to Portland."},{"name":"Shinkansen","address":"84 Massachusetts Ave","city":"Cambridge","stars":"3","text":"### HAVE ONLY ATE HERE AT LUNCH ###\\nIf you are positively hungry!!!!

The bean sprouts are uncooked which is usually a little alarming to me because I don't know if they were washed properly. But what doesn't kill you makes you stronger. Bottom line is, the broth is good and noodles were properly cooked.

The food is quite good, and it all comes with a generous glass of lemonade or sweet tea. (I'm assuming there are more drink options on the menu, but that's all I saw on the tables around me.)

I'm assuming that it is valet-only, given the location on Ponce."},{"name":"Element Bistro","address":"6315 Lookout Rd","city":"Boulder","stars":"3.5","text":"My first visit today and we arrived with a large group.  It was last minute and they were able to accommodate a 10+ group on a Saturday Night, albeit past the typical dinner hour.  The staff were helpful and seated us even though the majority of our group had yet to arrive.  I'm sure if the restaurant were busier we would have had to wait until our entire group arrived.\\n\\nThe menu is so wide and varied with so many choices.  I wish some of the appetizers came in dinner portions with sides.  Crab cakes come to mind.  Our group finally arrived and our server was gracious and patient with us as it took a while for everyone to say hello and then look at the menus.  Thank you for your patience.\\n\\nI ordered chicken tenders for my daughter.  She seemed to like them.  They had a real homemade crunchiness on the outside that you don't see very often.  The server brought those first as requested so I could feed her first while everyone was deciding.  You would be surprised how many times people don't listen and wait to bring it out all at once.\\n\\nMy wife and daughter ordered different wines they enjoyed.  I ordered the cucumber basil tini and I HIGHLY recommend it.  Nice and refreshing on a summer eve, not too sweet not too alcohol forward.  I also ordered the game sausage sampler for an appetizer.  The way the menu read it appeared there would be four different types of sausages, but who knows I might have glanced over it too quickly.  Elk sausage, pheasant sausage, and rattlesnake sausage all with sauces or accompanying tastes that were quite complimentary.  I especially liked the pheasant sausage.  The sausages were passed around the table with only a few takers for a taste.  If you're going to eat what you have at home, stay home!  Now I have some leftovers that are going to make an awesome omelette. \\n\\nBoth my wife and I had the Bison Tri Tip Au Poivre.  Tri tip can be a very difficult piece of meat to get just right.  I didn't taste any seasoning on my steak and both my wife's and mine were a bit gristley.  It seemed like a small piece of the tri tip, which generally comes in a roast of around 3 lbs, was cut off and then prepared like any other steak - hot seared outside.  Big mistake in how that was cooked.  Slower indirect heat for the entire roast and cut like roast beef.  The bison came on a bed of black garlic mashed potatoes.  The black potatoes were not as visually appealing as I would have liked and I could not detect garlic as advertised.  My wife liked the potatoes, I just felt they needed some seasoning.  On top was watercress mista - not plated with the best visual look.  If you want to add an element of freshness go with watercress micro-greens or use what you have on the outside of the plate; it did nothing for the dish and was a distraction.  On the outside of the plate was this spicy chutney that went very nice with the steak.  I will not blast the restaurant for the preparation of the tri tip, but note it should be done a different way.\\n\\nMy daughter had the roasted pork tenderloin and it looked quite yummy.  The portion of vegetables that came with the dish was almost more than most people could eat.  But hey they're vegetables and should be good for you.\\n\\nFor desert we had the carrot cake - oh so delicious.  Had to take most of it home because the slice was quite generous.\\n\\nA note to management about the service.  The service was good, but it is your fault our server did not know particulars about the menu items or drinks.  I asked about several entree items and they apologized they were new and had to ask.  The menu is not that extensive and at your price point I expect the servers to tell me how things are prepared or what a certain item is in layman's terms.  I'm sure your other customers feel the same.\\n\\nOverall we had a good experience at the Element Bistro.  Tighten up the execution on training and a few things on the dishes and it would be a slam dunk for 4 stars.\\n\\nPS check in on YELP and get 10% off your bill."},{"name":"Flying Wedge Pizza","address":"3357 Cambie Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"2.5","text":"This Flying Wedge Location has been on that corner for a long time serving their  overstuffed slices of pizza.

We had dinner on the patio, surrounded by plants, bougainvilleas, and romantic outdoor lighting.  We ordered wine, appetizers, and dessert.  Everything was exquisite - the food, prices, service, and ambiance were exactly what we were looking for.  We shared the following appetizers: \\n- Mussels (\\"dirty\\" meaning with french fries) - These are in a white wine and garlic sauce.  The menu mentions a creamy sauce so I was expecting something much creamier, but it was still tasty, light, and good for french fry dipping.\\n- Escargots with polenta, garlic, and crushed tomatoes - Good, but not the best I've ever had.\\n- Scallops on a bed of corn, onions, and truffle honey - I'm not a scallop-kinda-girl, and this one was my favorite! \\n\\nFor dessert, we couldn't decide between the flourless chocolate cake, the cr√®me brulee, or the profiteroles.

Although I generally like the food and atmosphere, now it's time to break from the crowd and register some negatives of my experience on May 11, in order of importance:\\n\\n - Beware of the middle tables in the main dining room.  The air vents blow directly, and strongly on them - to the point I had to put my glass on my menu to keep it from blowing away.  One member of our party had to step outside to warm up.  This really detracted from our dining experience.\\n\\n - The charred octopus - I have had it all 4 visits and normally love it.  But this time it was prepared with too much spice and seemed a bit overcooked.  Frankly like the octopus at Baraonda more than this version.\\n\\n - Not sure why they think they need piped-in loud music to complement the dining experience.  It does not enhance the experience.\\n\\n - Frankly, the servers and bartenders at Lure are more professional and personable.\\n\\nSo The Optimist is certainly good, and the location is very hip.

Nonetheless any time someone asks what a good pizza place is, we always tell them Home Slice.\\n\\nRight across the street from Gueros and Hop Doddys, Home slice has 2 prime locations right next to eachother on South Congress.  1 location is for take out only, but the other allows sitting down to enjoy a fresh pizza. Typically there is a wait on Thursday, Friday or Sat nights (also Sat and Sun during day) but its well worth the wait. The tables and chairs are a little kiddish but dont let that stop you from enjoying a dinner here.\\n\\nThe drinks comes with the almost crushed ice thats easy to eat with your teeth and make the drinks very cold (sorry I love that ice). You can enjoy a salad for 1 as an appetizer or for the whole family, which are served with fresh baked rolls.\\n\\nThey have a few specialty pizzas or you can create your own. Typically the pizzas are very large no matter if you order a medium or large. I always go with the Pepperoni and Mushroom pizza. The waitress will set down a pizza tray on a stand at your table before the pizza arrives. Once the pizza arrives you can tell its steaming hot out of the oven. \\n\\nWe usually ask for ranch to dip our pizza in which tastes like its made in house, but this I am not sure of. The pizza slices are large and hot when they come out so we usually use a fork and knife until it cools off a bit. The crust is crunchy on the outside and chewy on the inside. It is perfect and beats out any franchise pizza crust by far.

It was our first time and needless to say it will be our last.

Also, the flies in the main dining area and the musty smell near the bar did not help. While the appetizers we ordered were fine, the entree is where the problem reared itself. My mother order Lobster fried rice, the lobster is supposed to be tempura battered, however it came out with the consistency of double-battered fried chicken;  which was strange, because the calamari also had tempura batter, but it was extremely light-which we enjoyed.  Needless to say, my mother did not like it and wanted to order what my father had instead (which she tasted and knew she would like). This is when the fine print on the menu was brought to our attention-which basically says no substitutions, and if the dish has been prepared correctly,  you cannot send a dish back because you do not like it.  I've never been to a restaurant with this type of policy and frankly I find it a bit off-putting. With that being said, we did get the issue resolved (after about 20 min), but it ruined my birthday experience.

The food doesn't have to taste good because the owners know people will come due to the foot traffic.\\n\\nAs I walked in, I was immediately thrown off by the gift shop and the slogan, \\"Oldest restaurant in America\\".  If you are visiting the New England area....I am sure you are going to run into a lot more Oldest Restaurants so don't pee your pants from excitement.  Gift shops to me are always a bad sign because 9 times out of 10, the shot glass is going to be of better use to you rather than wasting your money.  As we waited an hour, longer than the quoted time, I enjoyed a 7 dollar Sam Adams.\\n\\nWhen it came to ordering, I looked hopelessly at the menu.  Everything seemed so bland and very boring.  As I was looking, some overly sweet corn bread was plopped onto the table.  It was not tasty, I liked the prepackaged oyster crackers for the soup better.  The food is expensive.  If you eat there, expect to pay market price for a lot of their items.  Since I wasn't moved to spend money, I opted for their \\"Number 1\\" clam chowder and a side salad.  Well, I am from the South and I think I have made better clam chowder on my own.  It wasn't even hot.  The salad was good though, but it was just baby spinach and romaine with 3 unripe baby tomatoes and cucumbers.  Yet it was 5.95, so I would advise to just go to the grocery store and buy a bag of salad and call it a day.  My friends ordered the baked scrod.  Boring, lifeless, and overly buttered, I was happy to say I did not waste my money on that meal.  Looking around the room at what people were eating, I would have rather ate the hot dog off the children's menu in the end.  Too bad I am not 12.\\nLastly, the service is what killed me.  Rude hostess and waitress.  Being a waitress before, I know it is annoying to split checks, but I have done it.  Yet, when we wanted it done, she said \\"Sure\\" hurried off and basically plopped the new checks down annoyingly.\\n\\nDo not waste your time dining here.

Next up was what I had been reading soooo much about- lobster Mac & cheese. Hands down!! This was a great combination of spicy and cheesy and oh my the lobster just balanced the two perfectly adding texture and a little saltiness.  It became an immediate staple for me and for a starter, was a really good portion- (see pic) I got filled up off it alone. That and the sweet drink concoction alone would have been enough for my palate, but I am a Pad Thai feign, so I had to try the Tiger Prawn Pad Thai (see pic). This was one of the best. Using the larger sized shrimp was a excellent idea. Kudos to the chef. What was unique about this dish from other Pad Thai  entrees I've had was that it was well seasoned enough to not require too much of the red chili paste you normally get. The flavors of all the ingredients weren't overpowered by the paste, so you could appreciate each of their distinct tastes.

This place definitely feels like a middle of nowhere place... though I'm sure Somerville would be quite annoyed with me if I described them as nowhere.

It was cold at first when we came, but the server was happy to turn up the heat for us.  \\n\\nMr. Boss started out by ordering a great red wine, which I wish I had remembered the name of because I would love to order it again.  Everything was raved about on the menu... I was torn between the risotto pescatore and the veal toscano, and in the end went with the veal.  AWESOME!  I hardly ever order veal (not a political thing... just never really order it) and I am so glad I did that evening.  Meat was lovely and the sauce that came with it was supremely sublime.  It came with raviolis that were also fab.  Everyone at the table got something different, and if they were my friends instead of my coworkers, I would've asked to pick at their plates.  I especially wanted to try the gnocci, which came out in a deep ramacan and covered with cheese and sauce.  Everyone expressed that there meal was delish.\\n\\nI can't decide which was better, my entree or my dessert.  We got an almond torta and hazelnut chocolate ice cream to share.  The almond torta was amaaaaaazzzziiiiiinnnnggg.  It was super light with great flavor and just hit the spot.  \\n\\nThe whole meal was fab.

If you get the 'untossed' shwarma salad as I suggest above, it'll set you back about $12."},{"name":"Home Slice Pizza","address":"1415 S Congress St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"Always great pizza and cold beverages!!!

Wasn't really sure what that was, but oh well, back to my review. I decided to take a lady friend of mine to the Assembly Row area for a little walkabout and taking in of the different eateries in the area. We went on a Saturday night and the wait times for like 30-55 minutes. We couldnt get in anywhere. So, we decided to bite the bullet and wait at the River Bar. River Bar told us 35 minutes, and viola!  - they had a table for us ready in less than 10 minutes. That was pretty awesome, even on a Saturday. \\n\\nWe went inside and the place was packed but nothing that was an obscene amount of people. The layout was trendy and the bar was a good setup from what I could see. We were seated in a nice window seat, and also given the option for an outdoor bar as well. We ordered drinks, and I went with what they called a Radio Flyer. It really got my wagon going for sure. The drink was very tasty, although my lady friend's wasnt so much. Drinks were made in an average time, and maybe a smidge longer, but given that they had a full house to contend with, I cut some slack there. \\n\\nThe atmosphere was sort of loud, but to be expected for a Saturday, and the wait staff was professional and attentive. I was happy to be there, and made to feel like they were happy to have us there. They knew their house menu pretty good, and recommended my drink to me, which I enjoyed. Then we decided to order the food. \\n\\nBoth of us ordered the Grass-Fed Burger, and when it was served, it was smaller than I expected (more like a slider than a full burger), but man, what a flavor. It was the first burger I ever ate that had bacon-filled spring rolls on it. The burger was done, well done, to a crisp, but for the life of me, it was a very tasty burger. It was served with a side that looked a lot like coleslaw,but nonetheless, yummy. \\n\\nI really liked the River Bar, and it was definitely a very nice, clean, and professional place to go to for a nice drink and quick bite to eat. I am a fan and will definitely go there again when I am in the Assembly Row. The location on the water was really cool too. I also liked the idea of the outdoor patio with the fire pit in the middle.The only complaint I had with the place(and some may say I'm petty but, oh well), was that there was no \\"hook\\" to really make it stand out from the other places such as a signature dish that you just had to have, or a drink that everyone talks about. Having been to many different bars and restaurants in my lifetime, I just didnt feel that the place made an impressionable dent in me as being one of those places that i will truly remember and will stand out in my mind of other restaurants or bars. With that said, I want to in no way take away from the integrity or the value of this bar as a place to go on a Saturday night if you are in Assembly Square. This was a good first place to go, they did a good job all the way around with my experience. I will go back for sure when I am in the area, or if I can sneak away from work."},{"name":"Voodoo Doughnut - Old Town","address":"22 SW 3rd Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"Lives up to the hype.

The complimentary dips that accompany the bread are amazing, I've never tasted anything like the it, especially intriguing was the peanut-based sauce. The bread was sadly just ok, I think it would benefit from being toasted or warmed up. I will say I was very happy with their vegetarian menu, part of my fear was that Peruvian food might not be vegetarian friendly. This menu rocks. We started with the papas appetizer with 3 types of potatoes and 3 sauces.This dish was just ok, everything was cold which wasn't very appetizing. Fans of papas bravas will not be pleased. I ordered the quinoa risotto and it was superb. I daydreamed about it for a week straight afterward. The quinoa wasn't too thick, it came loaded with fresh veggies, and drizzled with truffle oil with a slice of unctuous melty goaty cheese. This was savory, veggie, textural heaven. My accomplice had the stir fried mushrooms and garlic rice dish that was also really good, and the pineapple mojito, perfection.

You can get this gluten free. A good dish but not as amazing as the octopus or the lamb.\\n\\nEven though we were pretty full, we decided to order dessert. The chocolate andino brownie is gluten free, made with quinoa, with a chocolate ganache.  We liked it but it wasn't impressive.\\n\\nThere's a full bar with wine and cocktails. The El Anticuado is the Peruvian cousin to the Manhatten. Bourbon infused with coffee beans and mixed with a citrus chancaca syrup, served on the rocks. There's a Bartenders Choice which rotates regularly; when we were there it was called Pachamama Refresca, which is pisco with strawberry puree. Both drinks were really good.\\n\\nThe service at Andina is fantastic. The owner, Doris Rodriguez de Platt, stopped by our table during dinner to ask how we were enjoying our meal. She explained the history behind lamb dish and how they had spent a couple of years perfecting the octopus so it would be tender.\\n\\nI wish we lived closer to Andina so we could could go back sooner."},{"name":"Voodoo Doughnut - Old Town","address":"22 SW 3rd Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"Got a special order from here with a unicorn center piece I was asked if I would like anything specific on it I mentioned it was for my birthday and they could go crazy and let me say they didn't disappoint they went above and beyond what I imagined I almost couldn't bring myself to eat it since it was so beautiful all the donuts were delicious!!!!!

I hadn't realized at the time that the restaurant just opened a week before I had gotten there.  I made reservations for a Tuesday night, just in case I needed one.  We got there and it was hot as Hades in the restaurant and relatively empty.  We were seated downstairs in the middle of nowhere without air conditioning, but were offered a fan (WHAT?!).  We asked for a booth which we were moved to, but it was just too hot for us to remain in the restaurant since we were sweating so bad so we discussed amongst ourselves that we should probably leave.  Our waitress was very nice and accommodating and sought a cooler place for us to sit (which should have been the 1st thought), but anyway.  We were brought water glasses prior to being moved upstairs to a cooler location which was being reserved for larger parties.  Much more comfortable.  Next thing we know, the waitress went downstairs to our old table and grabbed our old glasses of water to bring to us.  Huh?  Just refresh everything since this visit isn't going that well.  Ok, moving on.  We order and realize that the items on the website do not coincide with what they actually have available :(  Ok, moving on again.  Some lady comes by and says she's the manager and to let her know if we need anything.  Cool.  We get our food which took a very long time considering nobody was really there.  I ordered the beef short rib and got just that....1 small short rib.  Now for $28 I should have had enough on my plate so that I wasn't hungry when I left.  I had a problem with that.  The short rib was very tasty, so it was too bad that I didn't have enough to really grub.  The mashed potato puree underneath was watered down :(  The peach cobbler was thrown together and slapped with a piece of raw dough on top that didn't get cooked all the way.  I actually liked it, but my friend didn't.  The salmon was fishy and the grits with the shrimp and grits were watery.  Then when I tried to explain how disappointed we were with how things went the so called \\"manager\\" walked off like she she didn't have time for a complaint and could care less.  This establishment had lots of potential, but Tip is gonna have to get a service staff and mgmt who know the business.  You just can't hire everybody in the neighborhood to run your business.  The upscale service ought to match the upscale price and edifice.  This was a let down at another black owned establishment.  If they really want to get it together, go visit Caper's in Kennesaw, GA.  A black owned and totally booked restaurant with class and service and quality to match.  I want this restaurant to win, but they have a ways to go.  Our dinnerware was old and borrowed and bent up silverware.  For a restaurant that JUST opened, somebody has really dropped the ball.

Portion sizes were surprisingly large for a place like this.  I was expecting teeny tiny food but we all definitely ate very well.  The salmon chips are wonderful--a huge potato chip piled high with smoked salmon and capers was the perfect appetizer.  The empanadas were stuffed with savory, tender brisket (oops I broke my pescatarian rules for this one!)  The calamari was light, crisp and just spicy enough with a great cream sauce lightly drizzled over it.  For my entree I got the seared tuna--best I've ever had hands down.  It is served atop a huge bed of edamame and avocado salad with a few slices of tomato and cucumber throughout.  The tuna was so perfectly seared and the spicy sesame sauce (get it on the side!) was a great compliment to the dish.\\n\\nI left very happy with a belly full of carefully prepared, somewhat healthy food, a few great drinks, and good times among co-workers to wish one fairwell as she goes to Iraq to serve our country!

Two small pieces, but more than enough for breakfast. They were cooked well, but um it should come with some gravy because it's Cubed Steak and not steak Steak. So it was a little dry. The grits were good but needed plenty of salt. I would be remiss if I did not warn you that they had a lot of butter in the little container of grits.

We were seated right away (we had reservations which are recommended) and our waitress was super friendly and knew her wines well.  We order the meat and cheese plate and were blown away with the portions and quality of the food.  I had gone to CRU earlier in the week and ordered the same thing but there was no comparison.  After that we had the sunchoke and butternut squash antipasti which were served cold and were great.

Anchovies has fantastic food, spectacular drinks, a moderate price, and a kitchen that is open late all the time. It is one of South End's gems. I have yet to discover a place in Los Angeles that can capture its vibe. \\n\\nI spent many years in Boston working as a concert and theater producer and event marketer. We hosted many events at venues all over Boston including restaurants. Anchovies was one of the best places to take 1) friends for late night drinks and food, 2) date, 3) out of towners. I hate to be in-descriptive, but everything about Anchovies is great to me. I remember it fondly, and it will always have a very special place in my heart. Nothing will probably ever replace Anchovies. \\n\\nIn terms of food, they have (I am convinced of this) the world's best Chicken Parm. It's served steaming hot and it melts in your mouth. The dish is accompanied by a side pasta (you choose the pasta) and a salad with vinaigrette or blue cheese dressing. The mussels with white wine sauce is excellent. The tomato and cheese bread is excellent. Everything is excellent. The price point is also more than reasonable. \\n\\nAnd the main star of the show  is definitely their Stoli Rasberry Cosmopolitan. Even famous LA joints can't make it the same way Anchovies' bartenders make this drink. It has a perfect balance of sweetness and alcoholic content. Their wine selection is good too, but all of their cocktails are great. They even have several Boston micro brews on tap. \\n\\nThis place is slammed every night around dinner time so prepare to wait in line. And in the winter time in Boston, waiting outside might be really rough. But late night, the kitchen is open until 1am everynight. I remember many late nights during the week when friends and colleagues and I would get off work late and head over for a great dinner and then stumble home drunk from their cosmos. \\n\\nIf you're ever in Boston, I would not miss trying this place. I am afraid to post this because it's such a great kept secret that making it too commercial might ruin its vibe. I'll see you there next time I am braving the cold in Boston."},{"name":"Panahar - Bangladeshi Place","address":"3375 Buford Hwy NE, Ste 1060","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"The food was simple and light and so-so.

I would've liked to take my time and enjoy a leisurely meal in my pretty curtained booth over tea (they don't serve hot beverages for lunch. The waiter told me that there is no chef here for lunch, they only heat up food that a woman brings over). I would not return because I went there twice for lunch but had to leave because their buffet was empty - this was an hour before the buffet time ends.

The first was several years ago with my wife. We sat at the large table at the very front of the restaurant and had a, generally, good experience (mainly, I now see, due to that specific table - more on that in a moment) although I can't say that I was knocked out by the place. This time, however, I saw proverbial cracks in the fa√ßade - some my fault, some the fault of the restaurant. \\n\\nI had my mom in town and thought that it might be nice to take her somewhere for breakfast with a more Portland feel like broder. We arrived 30 minutes early to find no line (Yep, NO line.) so we drove around for ten minutes. When we returned, the line was to the end of the block and we were still 20 minutes prior to opening! From that point, we waited over an hour on the very top of the waiting list. In fact, they sat at least two full tables of people lower on the waiting list while we waited. We asked why we were being bypassed, and he responded that it was due to our having a child with us. Apparently, the child-specific table we needed was casually being occupied. Hmmm.... So we wait.....and wait....Finally, we were seated at a table that, no kidding, is small enough to seat two dwarfs let alone two full-grown adults and a child. Perhaps they gave up on our table for 2 1/2 and just gave us the table for 1 1/2....Upon seating us, they removed the booster seat which completely mystified me - I asked for it back. The rest of the meal was, no kidding, a battle to get the right number of napkins, silverware, and room to breathe. That, and the ableskivers that my mom makes are way less cakey (better) than theirs. The service wasn't bad - it was just clueless, the restaurant seems desperately short of space, and the \\"flow\\" is terrible. Sorry, but I was in the mood for a decent breakfast not for a hassle a la hipster. I won't be back which probably won't affect them much.

Pricing can be a tricky thing so I won't address it too much here.\\n\\nPanahar was the first time that I've ever tried Bangladeshi food (being the food loving explorer that I am), and let me just tell you straight forward...it's freakin delicious! Being a first timer with this type of cuisine, I honestly wasn't sure what to expect flavor-wise, so I went with my gut instinct and did a little research on each dish that stood out to me. Funny enough, because of this restaurant, I now have food favorites that I can now say stems from the Bangladesh region (which is cool being able to say).\\n\\nFirst off, everything that I've decided to try off the menu was either \\"pretty good\\" or \\"this food taste so damn incredible, I'm pretty sure they serve this in heaven\\" which is probably the greatest compliment that you can give a restaurant. Keep in mind that I've ordered online exclusively so I can't speak for the full in-house menu as I'm sure I'm missing out on certain items.\\n\\nMy recommendations? My first instinct when trying foods that are foreign to me is to give the mixed sample tray-like items a shot as you somewhat get a good grasp on the different tastes and textures of said restaurant. If you have a similiar mentality, I'd easily gravitate towards the \\"Mixed Tondoori Platter\\" which will include five different tandoori items: chicken tikka, chicken tandoori, sheek kebab, lamb tandoori and shrimp tandoori. Again, this is a nice way to dip your feet into this deliciously exotic new world of flavors. If you're familiar with this type of food already then I suppose you'll enjoy it, but I can't necessarily compare to other places. Again, this is my first time with this type of cuisine.\\n\\nIf you think of sample platter and say \\"Screw that! I want an actual plate of food!\\" then look no further as I more than highly recommend the Lamb Tikka Biryani. I'm pretty sure the chicken version to this is delicious (and cheaper), but this particular Biryani tasted like Heaven opened up its gates and said \\"I know you're not ready to come up yet, but I just wanted to give you a little taste of what to expect\\". The rice and lamb is well seasoned and the spice level is perfectly balanced (if you're tearing up a little from the spiciness...it's tears of joy). The lamb is NOT chewy whatsoever and is pretty tender. There's also a balance between rice and meat so there's no cheaping out happening here. \\n\\n...You get your money's worth of food at this restaurant. \\n\\nAs for appetizers, I've only tried the chicken shingara which, like everything else, is packed with flavor. It almost tastes like a mini roti from back home (I'm from St. Thomas) with a extra little something to make it unique. Whatever it is, it blew my mind how good it tasted. The dipping sauces that accompany them are perfect add-ons and the shingaras themselves are sizable enough for the price range and taste quality.\\n\\nLast, but not least is the Mixed or Garlic Naan. Just......just do yourself a favor and get either one of them and I promise that you won't regret it. I've never had Naan before, but now it's a staple side bread option for me because of this place. It pairs perfectly with everything else, so trust me when I say that the couple extra bucks is worth it. It's almost a mandatory side order really.\\n\\nConsidering that everything that I've just praised up and down came from online delivery that usually takes a pretty long while to get to me, I can only imagine what the food taste like freshly made on the spot and seconds away from my overly excited taste buds. Would I recommend that you go to the restaurant? Again, can't say since I personally haven't but considering the quality of food that you get...at least take it into consideration. \\n\\nP.S.\\nFree tasty rice pudding and a bottle of water!!!

I added a side of the creamy collards to the existing side of mac and cheese because when you're married on valentines day, who needs to hold back?  my husband ordered the scallops, and so while we waited for our grub we enjoyed a \\"thief\\" of keg wine.  good for the price and since we arent wine snobs, tasted great!  dinner came, and wow what a huge slab of brisket!  it was good but not as juicy and rich as the brisket that was in the empanadas.  sides were good but it seemed that everything could have benefited from a bit more salt.  by his report, my husband enjoyed the scallops.  said the grits were great.  didnt have dessert since we were planning to go elsewhere for it but made a run to the restroom before we left.

In terms of food quality, somewhere in between Saki Maki and Kishimoto with the latter being by far the most exceptional Japanese food on Commercial Drive.    I would describe Tatsu's food as excellent as well.  Where they lose marks for me is on the timing of their service.  Tatsu has a sushi bar and a back kitchen.   They seem not to consult each other on timing. Almost consistently during my first several times there, in ordering with my wife appetizers and mains, the dishes would come to our table all topsy turvy.   ie. Main for one of us first, the other of us waiting, then an appetizer at the end, etc.  It got a bit laughable, as it stands out from most restaurant practices, but I confess it was irritating as well.

I usually get the truffle fries and mushrooms for sides, both great. I was disappointed with the mashed yukon potatoes and the corn polenta on my last visit.

That said, Atlantans flock to new restaurants the moment they open in desperate need for something new in their palate and (let's face it) to be a bit bourgeois, and claim they've \\"been there and done that\\".  \\n\\nI am going to speak from two points of view.  \\n\\n1) from an event planner point of view as I had a private dinner for 15 last Thursday hosted at The Optimist and \\n\\n2) from a normal patron,s point of view from my dinner with a few girlfriends celebrating a 30th birthday on a Saturday evening.\\n\\nTo begin with, it's obvious The Optimist is a bit overwhelmed with the response they have received from the community.  They haven't had a ton of corporations utilize their space, so their knowledge with food and beverage minimums and contracts are still being tailored as well as their response time (for Corporate America's point of view).  However, AbbyKate (event manager), in the end winded up delivering as needed.   The restaurant was flexible in my requests and constant change in numbers.  AbbyKate also met with me unexpectedly the Saturday before my dinner to show me the space I had requested for my group and took the time to give me a tour of the space, which I greatly appreciated...especially considering how busy they were that evening.  My internal client who the dinner was hosted for, thoroughly enjoyed the atmosphere and the food (albeit it was a bit slow...but they are serving 15 people at once, so that's a little expected for a new restaurant...which is why they push to order from a tailored menu as opposed to a la carte).\\n\\nNow, for the review you are probably most waiting for - my personal experience.  The valet parking was atrocious.  The poor valet has to work with a woefully inadequate parking lot and tons of impatient, hungry people.  That said, if you can cab it, do so and be dropped off on Howell Street, not in the parking lot as it's hard to turn around.  We managed to get a resi at 9:45 PM (made four days prior) and they made great timing in having us seated 10 mins prior to our reservation.  I was a bit apprehensive when they mentioned the air conditioning was not working to it's fullest potential, but at least they told us on the phone when confirming our resi and were fully apologetic about it.  Aside from the TERRIBLE noise level (all concrete),  I loved the place.  \\n\\nI ordered the east coast oysters (half a dozen) with the shoe string fries.  Their homemade crackers were delish as well as the perfect, fresh oysters I slurped down eagerly.  Our waiter was incredibly knowledgeable with the menu and helped my friends make their orders.  While the sticker price is on the high side...everyone agreed that their meals were beautifully presented and well worth the price.  I think it's funny when people complain about the portion size, because the portion size is exactly what we SHOULD eat and is healthy amount of food, but definitely not a Chilli's or Outback restaurant portion (nor should it be).\\n\\nI'll be coming again, as I love the Westside, the restaurant staff's professionalism and service...and most importantly they have the best oysters in town."},{"name":"Blue Dahlia Bistro","address":"1115 E 11th St","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Whenever I recommend a great brunch/breakfast to an out of towner I always recommend Blue Dahlia.

I dont understand the rave on this dish here. Taste nothing spectacular or different from the typical wonton.\\n* pho cocktail - it is a tasty drink but since I had such a great Pho cocktail in vietnam, this one got a high bar to surpass which it didn't.

I also loved the complimentary bread and the top-of-a-can dipping sauce. Who the hell thought of it?\\n\\nBut yea, this place puts way too much emphasis on sodium. I found their food incredibly salty to take in and didn't really like the other stuff.

I frequent their sister restaurant, ONE Midtown Kitchen, and it is still my favorite restaurant in Atlanta. \\n\\nLet me start with saying that I am in the restaurant industry and I am very patient and understanding when I visit restaurants.  My partner and I were celebrating our three year anniversary so when I made the reservation I asked for a quiet table in the corner or a booth. We were seated in the middle of the restaurant at a small awkward table.\\n\\nAfter being seated for about 10 minutes our server came by, he was very polite and informative.  He went over the wine program and cocktail list and said he would be right back for our drink order.  20 minutes (and I'm not exaggerating, it was literally  20 minutes) went by and he came back for our drink order.  Once we ordered it took another 15 minutes to get our drinks.  Finally the drinks came and we ordered our appetizer and entrees at the same time. The restaurant was only about half full. \\n\\nThe calamari was okay, not the best though.  So after our appetizer came out we didn't see our server at all. Well, we saw him walk past our table but never stopped by.  So I start to notice that no one in the kitchen was doing anything (it's an open kitchen) except for closing down.  It has now been an hour since we ordered our meal.  I was patient because we ordered our app at the same time and we were talking and enjoying our evening but an hour is ridiculous.  I see the chef looking around and approaches our server. They both looked confused and thought that we already had our food.  Meanwhile, four tables around us that came in after us had already eaten their meals. \\n\\nThe food finally comes after waiting for over and hour and i was thinking \\"This will be worth the wait\\". Nope!  I ordered the chicken and it was dry....like really dry.  My partner ordered the trout and it was over cooked but he was fine with it.  I NEVER send back food but I just couldn't eat the chicken.  The server suggested that I take it home and put some BBQ sauce on it and reheat it.  I think he meant well but I'm sorry, I'm not going to pay $20 for chicken that I have to take home and doctor up to eat it.  \\n\\nIn the end he took my meal off the check, which I really wouldn't have expected but I didn't eat any of it.  He acted like he did something for me that was not normal practice. Being in the industry I know that if someone doesn't eat their meal, they shouldn't pay for it. \\n\\nThe ambiance was great, food about a 2 out of 10.  A manager never stopped by to check on us or apologize for the quality of the food.\\n\\nSadly, I will not return to this restaurant or recommend it to friends."},{"name":"Joey's Thai Cafe","address":"195 Elm St","city":"Somerville","stars":"3.5","text":"Joey's provides a fast, friendly, affordable answer to Thai cravings.

My fianc√© and I have visited the restaurant on numerous occasions and we've brought both friends and family with us to introduce them to the great food. Of all the many times we've been there, only twice - TWO TIMES - have we received good service; once while sitting in the back 21 and up bar area and once by a woman who I believe was an old Howard's waitress (slender, shorter dark hair). I worked in the service industry for 6 years at a few different restaurants and I am dumbfounded at why they can't get it together. I have never been there when it was busy enough to warrant waiting 10 minutes for a drink in the bar area. My fianc√©'s drink had been sitting at the service bar for so long it was watered down by the time it made it to the table. Tonight, we were waiting on a box and the check and we observed our server, standing in plain view, standing around chit chatting (with our box in her hand) with other waitresses. We have about decided that from here on out we are just going to order take out.

This place is baffling because it could and should be amazing -- I want it to be great, my go-to place.  The problem isn't the service; despite some other reviews, I've found the service to be prompt and professional. And I've found their fries and their veggie burger to be very good.  \\n\\nBut Grass Fed, at least the times I've been, seems to break several fundamental rules of burger cookery: \\n\\n- The meat: the burgers are startlingly flavorless.  For a place that trumpets its sourcing, it's shocking that the burgers are so bland.  Their blend might need to be rethought, maybe adding some aged beef to the mix. \\n\\n- Seasoning: I feel like a good burger is amply seasoned with salt and pepper, but the burgers I've had are severely underseasoned. (Meanwhile, the fries were perfectly seasoned.) \\n\\n- Above all, a burger cooked on a griddle should have a deep sear, the Maillard reaction creating an intense umami flavor on both sides of the burger.  Instead, the burgers I've gotten here look like they've come out of a steamer.  Maybe the griddle at GF is not hot enough?  A novice cook with a screaming-hot cast iron pan and some salt and pepper could, with some direction, produce a better burger than what I've had many times at GF.  \\n\\nPlease make your burgers delicious!

I watch what I eat, try to eat my veggies as much as possible (I actually enjoy them), and I stay pretty active. I tell you this because I don't get out for junk food much, but when I do, I want it to be great. I've only been a handful of times and haven't tried a host of items from their menu, which is a fairly vast menu by the way. I mean, would you expect to find shrimp on a menu at a place like Zesto? I dunno! But there is shrimp on the menu, and jumbo shrimp at that. Haven't been to the Zesto web site yet? Check it out! It's actually a pretty good web site complete with menus for all of their Atlanta locations. So, of the items I've had here, there has been the chili dog, a couple arctic swirls, and a cone. All has been enjoyable, and memorable, even. Just last night I had a hankering for an ice cream treat, and so I went to get my Butterfinger Arctic Swirl. That, for those of you non-Zesto'ers, is a frozen ice cream concoction of vanilla soft serve blended with a candy favorite. For under $4, this treat packs some serious punch, as does their chili dog. I scarfed that thing down so fast, I swear I could have eaten at least a few more, and it's probably a damn good thing that I didn't. But, I will go back for another at some point, and I will certainly be back for my future ice cream hankerings.\\n\\nSo what else is the draw to this place? I mean, if burgers, fries, chicken wings, and ice cream aren't enough, then there is this. Last night I watched a homeless guy have a side of french fries with three cups of ketchup singing along to an oldie but goodie on the Zesto radio. He was just chilling out, enjoying his fries and a good song, awesome. What's good about that is it doesn't matter who you are when you come here. They welcome all. And the customer service, it's a standout actually. When handed my change last night, the lady at the register says enthusiastically, \\"thank you, baby.\\" I like that, and it makes me want to return for more. Honestly, it seems like most of the employees I see working there are always having a pretty good time, and who doesn't like to have fun at work?\\n\\nThis might not be the place you want to frequent if you're trying to watch your waistline, but if you just need some good, old-fashioned, fried food and ice cream, accompanied by plenty of fluorescent lighting, then look no further.

You have to spend a minimum of $25 per person to get a window seat in the lounge.  I understand that this is Top of the Hub, and that everyone wants to sit by the window, but come on.  This place is too classy to be so openly tacky.  Implying that I'm not important enough to warrant a window seat because I only want to enjoy the view with one drink is a tad rude.  2. You cannot reserve seats in the lounge.  I understand that this is true of most establishments, bars are typically first come first serve, but the lounge is where all the action is.  If I want to reserve a seat right by the jazz band on the night of my birthday I feel they should be able to make this happen.\\n\\nAnyways, I left my complaints for the end because I didn't want to deter anyone from making the trip.

The breads that they brought out consisted of 2 small pieces of cornbread, 2 rolls and 2 small cinamon rolls. All were OK, nothing special. I decided on the beef pot roast, and my wife had the meat loaf. The pot roast was more fat than actual pot roast, and was pretty bland. My wife's meat loaf was actually pretty bad, maybe not the worst that I have ever had, but certainly not in the better. We both had the deserts, with my wife getting the banana pudding and I getting the peach cobbler. I'll have to say that both were very good, although I had asked for the cobbler to be ala mode, and it was not. A word of warning, the sweet tea has so much sugar in it that it is like trying to drink syrup. Overall we were very disappointed here.

Why go and support McDonalds, Taco Bell, Burger King, KFC, Wendys, Cold Stone, Subway, and so on? These places have systematically and coldly taken over the national food scene by using the cheapest ingredients, pre-packaged frozen systematic meals that are identical across the nation, ridiculously cheap prices for the polystyrene food on dollar menus, overpricing for everything else, rude underpaid servers on way less than minimum wage, and a ridiculously expensive mass brand advertising campaign that gets inside the heads of all the kids and the 20somethings and keeps them under the illusion that if it's not a brand name, it's not worth visiting. They spend all the money they should be investing in food and service, in advertising and cornering the market - the local places can't compete - and someday all we will be left with is the same chains serving the same food all over the world. That is our future. It's the way we're heading and you know it. Every time you eat at a bland national chain, you buy into that, you support that. Boycott chains. Support your local eateries.

They charged me for 2 Diet Coke.  5) Since I was starving waiting for my seafood paella, I decided to keep the medium rare steak since we've sliced through it. I didn't want the wonderful steak to go to waste and did I mention I was starving? 6) 15 minutes later, my seafood paella arrived. 7) My friend's medium well steak didn't arrive until 2 of our friends were done eating. I eat on the slow side. She asked hers to be packed up to go. 6) We got the bill and there were no discount of any kind for the inconveniences we went through. Not even for the steak that was cooked wrong. 8) The manager came and instead of making things right, he informed us we could have given back the steak and not have to pay for it just like the duck paella. What?!?! They better not charge me for the duck paella since its not what I ordered. He was firm on not doing anything for us. He informed us the bread was comped.

You had to wrestle the oyster with a fork since it was still attached to the shell, making it a tattered mess by the time it's detached. Maybe if they supplied a shucking knife I'd have finished their job. \\n- Lots of shell bits and no oyster liquor\\n- Only one variety available on the day that we visited. Technically 2 varieties: you could get 1 at the raw bar (Blue Point) , and only 1 at the dining tables (from Delaware). So why can't you order Blue Points from your table? Ya got me.\\n \\nThe only upside: it's reasonably priced. 6 oysters will cost you $11.

In fact, I'm very tempted to give it a five, but something about it didn't quite hit that mark. \\n\\nWe decided on Dynamic Dish after going on recommendations on Yelp.  I was skeptical because similar writers had ranked Sunflower Cafe a bit too high in my opinion.  The restaurant is located on Edgewood.  It is easy to miss if you're not looking for it.  It's simple storefront was much more modest than I was expecting, but I liked that.  It isn't pretending to be something that it isn't.  The environment is very welcoming and it would be a great place to have dinner with friends.\\n\\nThe menu is very simple.  There were really only two sandwiches, one salad, a few desserts, and one soup on the menu.  When we went up to order, there were a couple more selections offered, but they keep the offerings limited.  We had read about the BYOB policy beforehand and I wish we had.  \\n\\nThe dishes are simple looking, but have incredibly creative and good flavor combinations.  One of our dishes was a lentil pate and apple open-faced sandwich.  I don't think i would have ever thought to put these two food items together, but the combination was quite lovely and exciting.  The dishes here are very thoughtful and creative--textures, balance, and aesthetics are well combined.  \\n\\nThe service was nice too.  Our server was very good about giving us a heads up that it might take a little time since it is a very small operation, but we didn't mind the wait.  It really take so long either. \\n\\nThere are only a couple things that could have gone a bit better.  There  could have been a better progression of the food.  The food is just brought out when each one is ready.  Also, they ran out of some of the items.  This wouldn't have been a problem except that the menu was so limited already. Also keep in mind that the parking is on the street and the area can get pretty crowded.\\n\\nOverall, I love this place.  It is my favorite vegetarian restaurant in Atlanta, hands down, and one of my favorite in this price point!   It is the first place that I've been excited about actively recommending in a while.  It is also refreshing to see such innovation in food.  I'd recommend this place to any vegetarian OR non.  I'll certainly be back.\\n\\nMore pics : http://vyatl.blogspot.com/2008/06/weekend-of-food.html"},{"name":"Wu Er by WOW Barbecue","address":"320 Washington St","city":"Brookline","stars":"3.5","text":"Excellent place for Chinese BBQ!

We went in the morning, and there was a line building inside the restaurant. The restaurant rules are you order first and then once you are paying, they have people who will help seat you at a table. Surprisingly, the line went very fast and it was all a very efficient process and we were seated and eating in no time. They have a lot of great choices of dishes which means I will have to go back. I had an omelette with American cheese, with a side of Cajun home fries, wheat toast, and avocado. My father had the Huevos Rancheros amd my mother had the Malted Belgian waffles with blueberfies and strawberries. All the ingredients were cooked well and delicious. \\n\\nI think the reason why I didn't give them 5 stars is because there wasn't anything special about the food to make it stand out. But maybe that wasn't their intention.\\n\\nOverall, the environment was great, the service was excellent, and I will definitely be returning! Next time I go, I would like to try the French toast or pancakes."},{"name":"Hao-Q Asian Kitchen","address":"3742 Far W Blvd, Ste 113","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Like some other reviewers, we have gluten allergies.

We hadn't been too thrilled with the Chinese food options in Austin prior to becoming GF, and were sure things were only headed south, but instead we found this gem! We had lemongrass shrimp (beyond tasty, really packed a flavorful punch) and spicy green beans (yum!). The chicken with broccoli was also good, though the brown sauce had an after-feel that was just a tad powdery.

Good deal right? Yes! So we used that and to our surprise you can even switch out the wine for any alcoholic beverages and if you go above $14 then you just pay the difference. I am an avid beer lover so I was ecstatic, plus it was hot outside and a nice frosty glass sounded refreshing. \\n\\nWe got the muscles to share and they were super yummy! It was a big portion in a delish garlic wine sauce. The server seemed a little distracted but it was a busy night, he was still able to get our complete orders in a timely manner.

I've only been here once so far, but I went alone and overheard many things that made me think that this place is A-OK.\\n\\nFirst, the couple in the booth next to mine had a gluten allergy and were vegan. The server listened to their food requirements and then assured them that there were dishes that they could eat, then helped them figure out exactly what they could eat. They seemed to love what they were brought.\\n\\nI overheard a worker at the hostess counter picking up phone calls for to-go orders, and for every person that called, she learned their names and had a short, friendly conversation with them -- evidently the regulars are well taken care of. \\n\\nAlthough the food did take a little while to come out (I expected pho to not take 20 minutes), it was very delicious, the broth was perfect, the meat were all tasty (I got the P1, the pho with everything, so seafood, beef, chicken), and there was enough for 2 meals.

The food, ambiance, service - all very good.  I really enjoy the warehouse-turned-restaurant trend and Two is no disappointment.  As with all warehouse-type places, it does get loud and tables tend to be close together, but in this particular spot that doesn't seem to take anything away from the experience.  If you are looking for a quiet dinner, this isn't the spot.  It's very high-energy and lots going on in this place.  \\n\\nWater glasses are never empty, food is prepared and served  quickly.  The calamari is good and a very generous serving.  The baby back ribs were also quite nice and more than enough food.  They were very tender and just fell off the bone (so no mess when eating them!).  The BBQ sauce on them was perfect too. \\n\\nTry some of the infusions on the menu.  The Castaway was spot-on and very refreshing.\\n\\nThe bread and chili oil/ balsamic vinegar came out after the food was delivered which was a bit strange but no biggie since our food came out so quickly.\\n\\nThe parking situation leaves a little to be desired.  It is valet only which is OK upon arrival but  leaving is always a problem as there is always a wait to get your vehicle and there isn't much standing room for all the people piled up waiting.  \\n\\nReservations are a must unless you get there very early or don't mind waiting a very long time for a table."},{"name":"Muchas Gracias","address":"5207 E Mill Plain Blvd","city":"Vancouver","stars":"2","text":"I am giving them 3 stars only cause it was the only place for mexican food when i lived out there.

My sister and I were joking that it was a rite of passage for anyone to go there from the Boston area. Most men take girls they  are trying to impress on dates here. Since my sister and I had never been, we decided tonight was the night! There was so much anticipation built and the hype was at an all-time high. We had dressed up, made a reservation for 7 PM on a Friday night. We were staying around the corner at the Westin Copley so we were close by. I definitely recommend setting a reservation, especially if you're looking to dine on a weekend. It was difficult for me to call in to make a reservation, so I made my reservation easily on OpenTable. I also called right before we got there to confirm. We were sat at an amazing table that lines the wall. The idea is that you have a remarkable view of the entire city. I would ask to be sat alongside the window. We were greeted by our incredible server, Leo. Right away he carried good vibes and we knew we would be taken care of throughout the night. We joked around with him and got his backstory and told him ours. \\nWe were definitely in martini mode, so I got my classic dry, Ketel martini with olives and my sister got a specialty martini called the BlackBerry crush. It was delicious. For those of you who want to try something different and don't prefer sweet drinks - this will be great for you. We noticed that there was a fixed menu that they were offering for a total of $75. It included for appetizers, the fillet, and dessert. If you wanted to increase that amount to $115 - it included wine pairings. Since we had already ordered our cocktails-we decided to split the fixed menu. We were hungry but not starving. They also serve you complimentary bread. Leo allowed us to split the fixed menu which was nice because not all restaurants would allow that. It was a perfect amount of food. We wanted to experience variety and that is exactly what we got. The only thing that really stuck out to us was the pumpkin gnocchi on the menu and that was included in the fixed menu as well. We got to share a delicious crabcake, a light and fresh salad, the pumpkin gnocchi, for appetizers also the the filet was delicious and cooked perfectly and the cr√®me br√ªl√©e wasn't an amazing finish to an already amazing dining experience. The only problem we encountered is that, upon ordering the fixed menu-we had told Leo to give a little bit of space in between each dish so we could talk about it and enjoy it. There's nothing worse than when a restaurant serves you everything at once and you feel like it's a race. I think that was taken a little bit too seriously since there was a huge wait in between or appetizers and our meal. My sister and I had plans to go out after and we actually never ended up going out since there was about an hour to an hour and 15 minute wait to get our food. By the time we were done with our filet and dessert we were definitely ready for bed! We had asked Leo to bring out the desert and the bill right away after we finished our filet so there was no more waiting! Leo did just that and we were out soon. We figured we would be spending a lot more, but all together with tip, tax, our appetizers, meals, cocktails, and dessert we paid $180. Really not too bad. Under $100 a person for such an incredible dining experience. If your server will let you, and you're not starving - I do recommend a fixed menu if they have that available available when you go. Overall I highly recommend this for the experience itself, the atmosphere is great and the food is good."},{"name":"Voodoo Doughnut - Old Town","address":"22 SW 3rd Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"The line appeared to be very long, but it actually moved fairly quickly.

I really wanted to like the food I got from here but I wasn't that impressed by the burgers at such a high price for such a small burger. The arugula on my cali burger wasn't fresh. Also, the fries were subpar with what I expected from ordering truffle fries.  They must have been just fried in truffle oil and had grated Parmesan cheese thrown unappealingly on top. There were several  balls of grated cheese in the large truffle fries that we ordered. The seating was quite odd and I feel as though they could do a little better with that to garner more customers.

The people working there were really nice, and the food came quickly.\\n\\nBut then we get to why I gave this restuarant a 2/5. This is because of the food itself. The food is pretty bland and very simple, something that you can easily make at home rather than go out and order it. I got the 2 tacos and the side of \\"nachos\\"- notice that I used quotation marks. The side of \\"nachos\\" that comes with almost every order are just bland, not fresh tortilla chips with NOTHING on top. They dont put any cheese or veggies on top- just....chips. If you want something on your nachos, they charge you a dollar or so extra for equally bland, melted cheese.\\n\\nMy older brother described it best: the only reason why you'd ever go is for their sauces. That's it. It's literally no wonder that they have a wide selection of sauces; their food is boring!

It's a 24 hr a day gathering place with a warm atmosphere accentuated by custom-made chandeliers and French-themed artwork. \\n\\nThe food is a mix of delectable savories and stunning desserts. The baguette sandwiches have a lovely crust with a deep flavor. I highly recommend the sandwich aux jambon avec formage, a simple French standard with flavorful ham and cheese. The soups are equally good and housemade such as their leek, potato, and spinach. \\n\\nThe colorful assortment of french pastries includes an enticing array of French macaroons, fruit tarts,  and their famous sea salt caramel brownies. Not too sweet, the crunchy brownies are coated with a gooey lightly salted layer of caramel  that blends a perfect amount of sweetness and chocolate. \\n\\nMy only criticism about the restaurant is that their portions are a tad small, but I prefer to think of them as more European.

The Diablos Rex, Voodoo Doll and Cock-n-Balls are simply creative spins on traditional doughnuts. \\n\\nCreativity along doesn't make for a great doughnut shop, hence the 3 star rating.

The fried grouper was flaky and light over comforting red curry. The lobster fried rice was well seasoned and the tempura lobster tail was generous. The lamb was savory, perfectly cooked, had a carmelized sauce, and was served with kale mashed potatoes and a red curry that was perfect with the meat. \\n\\nTo top it off, the servers were friendly, funny, and offered helpful suggestions for drinks and food.

He didn't come over to ask me if I wanted another knife (which I asked for three times before he finally realized I seriously needed a knife, and when he bring me a knife he brought two...assuming I'm clumsy?) No, he came over to grab a towel and clean the speaker off.

Also, I would have loved at least one water refill and it's apparent the other servers don't help out in that way because there were several servers that just walked on by my poor empty cup of water...\\n\\nPro: I did like the mason jar touch for the water, although that's not really a service category but whatever it's a pro.\\n\\nB. Proportions: \\nCon: Our \\"could feed 4\\" appetizer of chili cheese fries had one tiny dollop of sour cream on it. Dude, how awkward for my friend and I to try and eat and not be the one to take more or the last bit of sour cream.  Tasty meat from what I tried, but holy cow, the size of our buns! (no not the one squashed in their chairs) I ended up taking this massive submarine style bread off and just eating the hot dog and it's toppings. The hot dog by the way, was the same size as one from the store, not jumbo sized that is. So imagine: wee hot dog in a massive submarine size bun...poor fella, didn't stand a chance!\\n\\nPro: if the proportion was equal then I'd say great size for price. Hot dogs themselves were tasty.\\n\\nIn the end, I enjoyed the meal only because I was with a very close friend who needed to talk and that's exactly what we were able to, at least until the end, when a bunch of people were up on the indoor balcony section doing a pod cast or something? Random...some randomness is good, but this one? Was not. At least let the people know who are going to be seated near that balcony, that a live podcast was going to go on at so and so time so we can have the option to sit somewhere else.

Try the Warm Chocolate Cake!  I know it's a staple at many restaurants, but this one is sure to please.  And of course don't forget the breathtaking view!  I went once when it was raining, still managed to enjoy the view, a few times when it was sunny (gorgeous) and even once when it was super cloudy and foggy, and when we got to the top we couldn't see a thing!  But we felt like we were floating in the clouds (looking for a silver lining?) and it was actually pretty cool.  I imagine if we had gone in that setting at night it would have been a different story...

I came in to unhappy employees but didn't let the lack of customer service effect me, I ordered my food and get what I usually order but as I sat down to eat I didn't enjoy it because the child that made my order put too much sour cream. I was basically eating sour cream and rice and it was disgusting who eats food like that? I tried mixing my guacamole and meat with it but it didn't satisfy my taste and I noticed an employee walking by to clean the restroom and I caught her attention and told her I can't finish my meal it is unpleasant and I would like a refund. She explained that she would have to get her manager and she did and I explained how dissatisfied I was with my meal because I was basically eating sour cream and rice and he rudely told me \\" No! I'm not refunding your meal \\" I asked why he simply said because I ate out of it he refuses to refund me my money for some trash. I wasn't having it, I was most definitely not going to stand there and argue with a senseless, careless, emotional-less manager who doesn't believe in refunding people their money for disappointment. I throw the bowl straight in the trash in front of him. I choose to eat at chipotle at least twice a week due to my busy schedule at work and I never have complained before even when they gave me the wrong online order, they placed too much salt in the rice or the time my guacamole was brown because they placed it in the heater waiting for me to pick it up. You would think they train managers to look at the factors and do people training and learn how to handle situations. I never once heard out of him a \\" I understand your meal was not to your satisfaction, I would be more than happy to give you a replacement meal or your money back\\" \\" I'm am sorry about that ma'am I understand where you're coming from I most certainly wouldn't have enjoyed a meal like that. \\" it's called customer service that manager should take up while dealing with customers.

However, they do their jobs with a smile and are nice enough. \\nIn terms of food, the calzone I had was surprisingly good. Mussels and littleneck appetizers were pretty tasty and seemed fresh and seasoned just enough. I've had the truffle fries which are nice and thin and pretty crispy and generously garnished.

We called to make a reservation but they don't take reservations anymore.  We were told to get there by 5pm to get in for the first round even though the restaurant doesn't open until 5:30pm.  We arrived around 5 pm and there was a line up already.   They started taking names at about 5:15 and we got one of the last two tables.   There is very limited seating so get there before 5 or you have to wait 2-3 hours to get in.   We ordered appies (the Octopus Carpaccio and Bone Marrow Escargot).  Both were mediocre-bland and not very flavorful.   We read all these reviews of the Duck Ragu so we ordered it and it was a disappointment.  It was also bland.  The pasta was cooked nicely but the flavor of the entire dish wasn't very good.  The duck was overcooked and dry.  Looked and tasted like crockpot duck but with no flavor.   We also ordered the Chicken Liver Tagliatelle which was better.  It tasted a bit better than Hamburger Helper.  Again not fabulous but edible.  We brought a nice bottle of wine.  Corkage was $20 which was ok but no stemmed glasses.  I absolutely hate drinking wine out of a rock glass.   Kinda killed the wine for me.   Not sure what the hype is about this place.  Pasta is average.   Service is good but that's about it."},{"name":"Home Slice Pizza","address":"1415 S Congress St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"I decided to start with the atmosphere considering there's more to say about the ambiance than the food itself.\\n\\nAtmosphere: It's pretty hip. We decided to stop here for dinner after a long day at SXSW. I must say the wait here is outrageous, but well worth it...I guess (I'm still pondering about that one). My bf and I could have opted on getting a pizza outside the restaurant window, but we wanted to sit inside and rest while the air conditioning was on. We decided to put our name on the wait list and waited what seemed like forever (around 30-40 min). While waiting on the patio (they had chairs and tables for people who ordered outside), the waitress/hostess was kind and offered us drinks since we were in the blistering heat. Yes, we kicked ourselves by not ordering at the window considering we could have been finished and be on our merry way by the time our table was ready.\\nOnce we actually got in this place, it was very dim lit with candles. Dare I say, but this could be a very romantic place to take on a first date. Not pretentious, but very laid back. We sat at a table where there was a booth on one side and a chair on the other. We were sitting at the end of the booth where there were people waiting for the restroom (it was a never-ending line. No joke). Our waiter just pulled the curtains and made sure we were not disturbed by the people in line. That definitely helped because I didn't even noticed them while eating.\\nOur waiter was awesome! He was extremely welcoming. He took care of us right away and made us feel like we were the only ones in the restaurant. He even took my phone and charged it in the office because I was expecting a VERY important phone call. Overall, he made the experience very fun and we gave him a huge tip for helping us out and for making it a positive experience.\\n\\n\\nFood:\\nThe pizza is pretty delicious. Unfortunately, they don't serve by the slice if you are dining inside the restaurant. You have to order a whole pizza. Too bad. I really wanted to try the chicken and spinach pizza, and my mouth was all ready for it, but alas we decided on pepperoni and sausage pizza (to be economical-they charge you like 2 dollars each for additional toppings). They served it on an elevated pan and the pizza was huge and was made of thin crust.  The sausage really looked like sausage-not the small chopped up ones you normally see. Score! We ended up having to take half of the pizza back to the hotel with us. As for leftovers, even after microwaving it it still tasted pretty darn good.\\n\\nI can't wait to come back and try their other dishes!. I will definitely be ordering the chicken and spinach pizza slice at the window!\\n\\nRatings: To be honest the waiting might have killed it, and after two weeks since eating there  I don't find myself salivating for it.

You also have your choice of toppings of fresh ingredients like spinach, roasted tomatoes, onions, cheese, etc. \\n\\nMy sandwich + the Scoutmob discount came to an even cool $4 and I was able to enjoy it out on their patio.\\nThe sandwich was decent, I kinda wish that it was slightly warmer since the temperature was not even throughout, but it was still tasty. I am not sure if I would be quite so thrilled if I didn't have my Scoutmob because $8 seemed a bit steep for a wrap."},{"name":"Boi Brazil Churrascaria","address":"5600 International Dr","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"Been to several other Brazilian steakhouses that I can compare this to, found that it was similar in most areas.

You're more apt to find me in jeans and a t-shirt than slacks and a button up, and more likely to see me devouring a steak than braised lamb and profiteroles.\\n\\nThat said, I do enjoy the finer things in life (I do KNOW what braised lamb and profiteroles are, so that counts for something), so dressing up and taking the girlfriend to the Top of the Hub for her 21st was not only a treat for her but one for me too.\\n\\nThere are people that will say most of the positive ratings here are based on the view, and to that I can't necessarily disagree. This is the finest view of Boston you'll get short of the observatory, and you can soak in in while you sip a drink and partake in a meal. Naturally, the location of a restaurant is reflective of it's price, and given the fact that the Top of the Hub is on floor 52 of the Pru, I hadn't planned on docking it for it's price tag - it's an expensive place and makes no attempt to hide it.\\n\\nSo the view and the ambience are top notch, and can't truly be matched at any other restaurant in Boston. Going for dinner or drinks at the onset of the evening is a great idea, so you can watch the sunlight fade and the city lights take it's place. It's qualities like this that make the Top of the Hub unrivaled in the ritzy eatery scene in Boston.\\n\\nThe service matched the atmosphere nicely. Our waiter was attentive and kind, offering not only efficient service but recommendations for us. He knew from the manner in which we handled ourselves that this was likely a rarity, and he accomodated us well.\\n\\nThe food was good. It wasn't unbelieveable, and I know many will come down hard on a place such as this when the price tag doesn't match the quality perfectly. I'll fully admit that the 10 oz. veal sirloin I had was, frankly, not anything impressive. If I were to weigh the bill specifically on that, Top of the Hub would have come up majorly short, but as it stands I know the bill factors in many aspects of the experience. The Creme Brulee was great, though - no negative marks for dessert.\\n\\nWhen the bill came, it was easily the largest bill I had ever paid at a Restaurant for a two person meal.  But it wasn't a difficult thing to stomach, either. I could've saved some cabbage by taking my girlfriend to the Outback, but I wanted an experience. Would she have been able to consume ritzy, high class food while surrounded by equally ritzy individuals elsewhere? Would she be able to look over the lip of her Cosmo and see the city ablaze with lights?  \\n\\nI contend that she wouldn't, and that's why the Top of the Hub is a Boston legend."},{"name":"Pai kin Kao","address":"80 River St","city":"Cambridge","stars":"4","text":"We ordered the buffalo tenders (medium) and a small garlic fried rice with mango habenero wings.

None of us had been to Anis in quite sometime - it's a little too easy to forget about, tucked away on a little Buckhead side street - but now we had a reason!!\\n\\nI was exhausted from a busy week of road-tripping for work, so just sitting down at a cozy bistro-like table was pure pleasure. Our waiter was attentive and helpful. There was a large crowd having a wine tasting fundraiser for some local charity in the large room immediately adjacent to our table, but the hostess kindly shut the doors to block out their noise.\\n\\nOverall, the experience was good. The three stars are for two main reasons: my entree and the overall noise level of the place - it's just plain loud on the large patio, which is where a majority of the restaurant's seating is (it's covered and heated). It was difficult to hear each other talk at times, and some of the tables, like ours, are a little too close together.\\n\\nWe started with the calamari, which was good though a tad overbreaded (but big enough to share between us all) and accompanied by a nice, slightly spicy and creamy tomato sauce. My mom raved about her trout, which was accompanied by artichoke hearts and asparagus and a light lemon butter sauce. Dad got the osso bucco which was very good, juicy and delicious; I tried it and agreed. \\n\\nI was leaning towards the saffron pasta with monkfish but our waiter discouraged me from ordering it and steered me towards my other inclination, the filet. I think I should have gone with my first choice. My filet was cooked right, temp-wise, at med rare, but the outside was pretty charred, which I don't like, and it was salty. While the Lyonnaise potatoes were tasty, the haricots vert were also salty, too much so to eat.

Sadly this visit was my first and unfortunately will be my last. \\n\\nI'm all for supporting locally based restaurants and black businesses. However, there were so many things wrong I just don't know where to begin. But I'll try. \\n\\nFirst off, I came with a group of friends with one whom made the reservation in support of the live performances that were showcased. There was an issue with reservations and communication between the event planner/promotion group with the restaurant's evening management and team of associates clearly didn't have the proper relay. The expectation was set that we would have a table in the area which the music and the artists were located. After several minutes we were seated upstairs in a room where there were three booths and maybe three collapsible tables with folding chairs that you would see at a family game night or a bake sale. The candle was not lit and had ashes and melted wax on the Mainstays candle dish it sat on. There wasn't any music playing to give the room some ambience until 25 minutes into our visit--and the music sounded like a distorted mix from music file on a smartphone plugged with an AUX cord. There was a woman who appeared to be a member of management helping the server out in the room but she didn't display nor exhibit any professionalism that you would expect being in a restaurant. \\n\\nAs for the food, the appetizer (AKA \\"Small Scales\\") was pretty good, despite that we had to eat with our hands use the cocktail napkins as we didn't have any saucers or silverware. Anyhow, we didn't receive any place settings until after our meals arrived (over 30 minutes later)and we had to stop the food runner (who didn't know their table numbers) to ask for silverware and napkins. The catfish wasn't bad (but it wasn't good) and the macaroni and cheese was TERRIBLE! Macaroni and cheese, especially baked, had absolutely no flavor and I had to attempt to Doctor it with the ramekin of hot sauce. I could've done a better job myself since baked mac and cheese from scratch is southern staple. Not all of this group enjoyed their dishes as the flavor was lacking and some of it came to the table a little cold. I'm sure the food had been sitting for a while. \\nWe also observed the same \\"manager\\" bussing a table but rather than simply removing the tablecloth on the collapsible table (it had food stains on it from guests who paid their tab and left) she was scratching the dried on stain with her nail!! For attention to detail, the tablecloth should ALWAYS be replaced after guest leave and the table is reset. \\n\\nFor the price you're paying, you could VERY WELL visit another establishment where service is a priority and the server actually follows Standard Operating Procedures and also caring about attention to the details. People remember those small touches and the food could be subpar but the service is great--patrons will return just for the experience! But service and the taste of the food is less than stellar, it's a bad combination. \\n\\nI have worked in the restaurant industry for several years on and off- and an aspiring restauranteur myself. I am in the business of meeting customer service needs. Building that brand and providing exceptional service establishes loyalty and that lasting relationship, it grows the business and the clientele. People will want to tell others--local and visiting guests that \\"this place\\" is somewhere you MUST visit at least once because it's everything. As a former server, I understand the demands of the position and volume on a shift can be a challenge- and the automatic gratuity protects their earnings. However, gratuity is not a right!! It is a privilege. You must provide a level of service that will show you've earned it-included or left for the customer to leave when the check is closed. No server should EVER be too comfortable to provide A-1 service for every interaction every time. Coming from this, I am still in the business of customer service. I am very patient because I understand the challenges and qualms that come with the job. However, my experience was less than positive. And being in this industry the expectations are much higher because you also provide a level of service that is required because it is part of the job.  \\n\\nScales 925 has some work to do!

The show was a lot of fun for kids and adults alike, and we had a very good time as a result.\\n\\nThe food and service were acceptable, but not particularly good.  While everything sounded great on the menu, the food that was brought to us was really just kind of average diner food.  I had some pancakes.  They were acceptable, but not especially good.  Everyone else's breakfast sandwiches looked kind of mediocre.  The potatoes were really greasy, but the sausage was dry.  It was fine, nothing too bad, but it wasn't all that good either.\\n\\nOur server was very nice, but everything was slow as hell.  She apologized that they were short staffed, so that doesn't help with the speed, and the table of about 20 behind us who all were on separate checks slowed down the works too.  Our food took forever to come out.  It was fine because we were enjoying the show, but it wasn't ideal.\\n\\nThe beer list is solid.  Lots of choices on draft and in bottles, and many local favorites.  I'm told the bloody Marys were very good.  But the bar was out of glassware and was refilling people's pint glasses, which is a no-no, and they didn't have enough glasses to give you a glass with bottled beer.  That's pretty bad planning.\\n\\nI'd go back if there were another good show (certainly for the Shazzbots, who were very good) and I wouldn't try to dissuade anyone from going, but I don't think I'd make a special trip back for the food or drink.

The vegetarian sitting at the table beside us looked on in horror as we devoured the 1 kilogram slab of glorious bone-in ribeye known as \\"The King\\" - along with the accompanying roasted marrow bones, smoke box cornbread, and a salad for good measure. But that was just the icing on the proverbial cake - everything about this place is top notch, from the ambience and service to the food and drinks. The only thing that could have possibly made the experience better was if they issued customized t-shirts to patrons who successfully defeat the King. \\n\\nFood: King+Duke is one of the newest installments in Chef Ford Fry's growing culinary empire. The menu is predominately comprised of New American fare, most of which is cooked in the restaurant's twenty-four foot, custom-designed hearth. My partner and I opted to start with some wine and the candied lamb belly appetizer, which was situated on warm flat bread and topped with sheep's milk feta and marinated cucumbers. The flavor was impeccable. For an entree, we opted to share the much hyped \\"King\\", which was perfectly cooked and among the best rib-eye I've had in some time. In addition to the marrow bones and salad that accompanied the entree, we also ordered the smoke box cornbread, which was topped with country ham and served with jalape√±o butter. We decided to forego dessert, but the options were tempting. \\n\\nService: Courteous, competent, and conscientious. The bussers were quick to fill water glasses and the food was delivered promptly considering how long it takes to prepare such offerings. However, I will say that the waiter had the charisma of cardboard - his personality definitely didn't match up with what I've come to expect from other Ford Fry establishments. \\n\\nAtmosphere: The interior of King+Duke is classic Ford Fry - complete with subtle colors, gray oak floors, and leather accents throughout. The dining area isn't particularly expansive, so the tables are fairly close - however, not so close that you're sitting on the lap of the diner next to you. There's also an intimate bar area and small seating area toward the front. My only qualm with the atmosphere was the dress of the clientele - for that price  point, I was expecting more than strip mall jeans and t-shirts. \\n\\nCost: Expensive by most casual dining standards. \\"Bites\\" are $5-$8, starters are $8-$16, entrees are approximately $15-$50, and entrees for two are $55-$125. I will note that the prices are actually slightly higher than what's noted on their online menu. For example, \\"The King\\" is listed for $80 online, but actually costs $87. Sides are $5-$8. \\n\\nOther: King+Duke is named after characters in Mark Twain's \\"The Adventures of Hucklberry Finn\\" - the name is a nods to classic literature and American traditions, and thus, the primitive hearth approach and locally sourced dishes. The restaurant is open daily for dinner and Monday-Friday for lunch. The outside bar opens daily at 5PM. The restaurant also offers an exclusive five-course chef's counter tasting menu ($75/person) - two seatings are available for parties of 2 guests each night."},{"name":"El Burrito Azteca","address":"1942 N Rosa Parks Way","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"It's been a lot of names, but still my favorite neighborhood haunt.

If you pass up an opportunity to eat at Cadillac Cafe, you are doing yourself a major disservice.  This is my all-time favorite breakfast joint in Portland, hands down!  The cafe is very popular, so odds are you'll find a line when you show up.  The wait times have never been so long as to be unacceptable to me though.  The food is well worth the wait, regardless.\\n\\nThe decor of the cafe is great, with a real pink Cadillac located within a glass viewing room inside.  The atmosphere is cool enough to go with friends, family, a date, or just solo.  It's a restaurant though, so the outstanding food is what keeps me coming back.\\n\\nI love omelets and I love avocados, so the Sonora omelet more than satisfies my love for both.  Avocados, crunchy bacon, cheese, fresh tomatoes and black olives, all stuffed inside fluffy eggs to create this miracle of food.  It could quite possibly qualify as my personal choice for last meal on Earth, because it's that heavenly.  The home style potatoes that come with it are savory and a perfect complement to the omelet.  If I'm not in the mood for an omelet, the French toast is amazing (as others have said) and is the clear-cut #2 breakfast option for me.  The portions for both are large and guaranteed to fill you up.  I always pair my breakfast here with one of their blended fruit smoothies -- I strongly recommend the blueberry.  The prices are not bad and the service is typically wonderful, except during very busy times (but who can blame them then, right?)"},{"name":"Poor Calvin's","address":"510 Piedmont Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4.5","text":"Fried chicken with lobster macaroni is clearly a staple here, great for some good southern food.

I'm a Chinese northerner at heart, but even for a sodium fiend like myself, the zajiang noodles were too salty (I actually couldn't eat any of it). The beef noodle soup was a bit heavy on the mala (numbing and spicy peppers), moreso for my southern-Chinese friends than for myself, but it could be toned down a few steps. I went on a limb and got the chicken cartilage as well, as I have had good experiences with that in China. However, these came out a bit cold. Flavor was excellent, but was hoping that there would be a bit of meat attached. Also, given that this was our first time here, we depended on our server for guidance on portion sizes and we ended up ordering too much. Still, I will be returning if only for the lamb kabobs.

I first saw this place on the Travel Channel and I always made a mental note that if I visited Portland, I will stop by here and eat the original Voodoo donut. That is exactly what I did. I was so excited when I arrived, I think everyone knew I was a tourist. I didn't care =p. I did the typical pointing and dazzly-eyed-wondrous staring and even snapped some photos. (\\"It's ok! I will never see these people again...or will I? =o\\") Anyway... donuts were pretty cheap. Kudos for them not hiking up the prices to trick tourists. Well to be honest,  I don't know the market rate for donuts, but seemed fair to me. As for the taste... it just tasted like a donut :p. I enjoyed eating my voodoo doll until I got to the center. Forgot it had jelly in it (supposed to be \\" blood\\")... I am not a fan of jelly donuts! So ended up tossing most of it. Still, 4 stars for the experience. Plus, staff was really welcoming and kind. Cash only! Oh, and they also serve Stumptown coffee, which goes well w donuts of course :). \\nQuick note: BTW, I read an article that a Voodoo Doughnut is opening up in Los Angeles, right by the Universal City Walk! Still glad that I was able to make it to the original one."},{"name":"River Bar","address":"661 Assembly Row","city":"Somerville","stars":"3","text":"Love the atmosphere at Assembly Row anyway, plus they had a nice menu and the food had great flavor.

They have a nice selection, including for vegetarians (which we are) including small plates, large plates, and sides. The cocktails were also very good. We had green beans which were perfectly cooked al dente with a garlicky bean sauce on top. It sounds strange, but was very interesting and very yummy. We also had a zucchini pancake with some type of tomato butter on top. Large enough to share and also very tasty, even without the butter. The service was fast and polite. I will definitely be back.

It feels old, and has all the charm that goes along with it.  For example, a tiny furry friend ran across the floor.  Strangely, it didn't bother our group - because since it is on a pier/dock area...shouldn't some critters be expected?  We mentioned it to our server, who followed up on it!\\n\\nWith that said, the food was great - albeit pricey.

I can't remember all the other donuts we ordered, because they are all gone now. The only complaint I had was with the Fruit Loop donut I had.

It is in a location convenient to friends in the Hollywood area and I like the in and out free self-parking and the bar and restaurant options on site. The main side with the classrooms which you can stay in are fun in concept yet dreary and cold temperature. I prefer the English Wing but that isn't why I'm writing this review. I just had the worst experience there this week and I have to vent..\\n\\nI booked a hotel night directly via the website for the the hotel/McMenamins. Easy. At check in I inquired about the possibility of extending another night. The very UNpleasant lady at the front desk (glasses, shorter) was very unhelpful and gruffly told me to call in the AM to see if they had rooms. Ok, I figured- not a big deal.... That night I was in bed in my room when I decided to go online to see if I could book the next night so I didn't have to go to bed wondering if I had a room the next day. Well, you can't book short notice on the McMenamins site so I went to Hotels.com and I was in luck! It said that there were two rooms available in my wing with a King Bed (what I was already in). I booked the room, received my confirmation then went to bed. In the AM I called to make sure I wouldn't have to change rooms since I just booked my second night in the exact same room when I was told that \\"Expedia sucks\\" and how Hotels.com is a part of Expedia and how they don't like them for random reasons. Since this is not my issue I listened but only could say that their relationship with Expedia isn't my issue.. they told me that I could not stay in my room and that they would have to move me to a smaller bed in the part of the hotel I dislike as the English wing was in fact, sold out. I couldn't understand why they would move me when I am already in my room rather than simply relocate a person yet to check in to whom they would give my room to? Also, as a long time loyal McMenamins loyal you'd think I'd have SOME courtesy - but no. After multiple calls to management and the Hotels.com site it was decided that I would leave the hotel and Hotels.com would relocate me. Here's the hilarious part... after being rude and unbending in allowing me to stay and being as unfriendly as possible - I got a call around 1PM telling me that they have \\"great news\\" and that I could stay as another guest upgraded from my room to another room (?). Well, check out is technically at 11AM so why would they call me at 1PM? I told them that I had already left. They then asked if I was at my new hotel (?) - I said that I wouldn't be back.

I went with the Junkyard Dog -- amazing spicy mustard, tangy yellow pepper rings, tomato, and a full-sized pickle slice that spanned the entire thick, toasted bun.

My brother is in town for a few weeks and I thought to myself, what a great opportunity to knock out two birds with one stone, show my brother downtown Austin and check out Frank! \\n\\nI like the layout of this place. They have the old school ceiling fans that are all run by belts connected to one central motor. They also have a lot of natural wood decor which I thought went well. The place is also surprisingly larger than you would think as it is a long place with a second floor towards the back. \\n\\nI wasn't impressed with the service. It took us a while to be greeted, like five minutes or so. We ordered our drinks, two sodas, and those took about another five minutes to get back to us. I guess drinks are kind of a pet peeve of mine. I wait tables for a living and I always try to make sure the drinks are on the table and are always full. They are a top priority to me. Needless to say, our server and I do not share the same priorities. She was basically an absentee waitress and the fact they use small mason jars for drinks basically set themselves up for failure in that department. \\n\\nI ordered two dogs. The first was with cheese and sauteed onions and the second was the same way but I \\"porked it\\" meaning they split it and fill it with American cheese then wrap it in bacon and fry it. I got them both on baguette rolls and added ketchup to them upon arrival. On the side I also got a side of the waffle cheese fries which come with bacon, sour cream and chives as well. I ordered mine without sour cream but it came out with it none the less. It wasn't not a huge issue but paying attention to detail is important for me. \\n\\nThe food itself was pretty good (even though it took about 25 minutes to get to us.) The portions were large so I couldn't finish all of it but I thought it was decent. The fries could have used some kind of seasoning but they were not bad by any means. The dog that was \\"porked\\" was really good, even though I'm sure I'll be having an angioplasty any day now because of it. \\n\\nOverall, I thought this place was decent. I was expecting a lot more but I naturally set the bar high. I didn't think my server was that good but I can't speak for the rest of the employees as they all looked like they were running around a lot attending to their guests. I'd tell you the name of the server to avoid but she never even told us her name!\\n\\nI wouldn't make a special trip in to this place but if you have some time and are in the mood for an alright hotdog/beer combo check this spot out."},{"name":"Voodoo Doughnut - Old Town","address":"22 SW 3rd Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"Service was helpful.

One might imagine that they thought she didn't want any blue cheese and tried to scrape it off. There was that little. \\n\\nEven without much of a crowd, the service was sub-par.

Boardgames are having a neat little surge or popularity at the moment, so it's great to have a place to go play with a group if you don't want to bother your neighbors or have the space to host. I would consider myself an enthusiast, so while this venue might be perfect for a novice, I definitely saw some areas where they could improve.\\n\\nThe space they've designed is pretty perfect. I love the \\"Mom's basement\\" feel to it. Mis-matched tables and chairs, art that consists of vintage board game packaging, and big and small tables for various sized groups and games. Other reviews mentioned bright lighting, but I have to say that I found that to be an advantage, as many of the advanced games have detailed instructions and cards with itty-bitty type. The only issue I really had with the space was the volume. This place could really, really use some acoustic dampening. The game we were playing was involved, and around 10pm we had to give up because we couldn't hear  over all the other players. Consider that when choosing a game: perfect for fast-paced card games, not so good for detailed RPGs. My guess is that it might also be difficult finding a table after 10pm, so come early if you have a big group.\\n\\nThe game selection was truly spectacular, there are many games available for all different interests and experience levels (Though I was told they don't allow Cards Against Humanity, probably for obvious reasons...). The game sommeliers were fantastic, and really understood the whole gaming concept and the needs of their patrons (I ordered Earl Grey Tea and our sommelier instantly put in the order as \\"Earl Grey, Hot. These guys get nerds.) One sommelier  literally spent a half hour teaching our group a new game, and repeatedly checked in on us. Other somalliers frequently stopped by to watch, offer tips, and take orders. \\n\\nTheir food and drink selection leaves a little to be desired. Though I found their hot drinks to be exceptional (the lattes are especially lovely), they only have fancy bottled sodas, and the only snack available was pretzels. The beer was a little overpriced, especially for a place designed to keep you in your seat for a few hours at a time. I would love to see Kingmaker embrace the culture even further, by offering the type of refreshments you would have eaten during a middle-school game of D&D: Mt Dew, Pepsi, Doritos, Pizza Rolls, etc."},{"name":"The Eisenhower Bagelhouse","address":"3990 N Interstate Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"5","text":"\\"That was a delicious bagel.\\"\\n-Me \\nTalking about my Lox on Siracha Garlic and Onion Bagel."},{"name":"Jalisco's Restaurant and Bar","address":"6601 S Congress","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"I was impressed by the selection of food.

The beer prices were stellar. \\n\\nAppetizers were regular queso and especial queso. The especial came with beef, guacamole, and pico hidden under the queso, ultimately making it easier to stir but the additional ingredients were cold enough to nearly congeal the cheese, nearly.
