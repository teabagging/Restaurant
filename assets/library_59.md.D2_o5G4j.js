Our waiter was extremely polite, we ordered food which came out rather quickly. We were happy, til I tasted the veggie quesadilla I ordered. I ate a small portion of it (legit one triangle of the unevenly cut quesadilla) it was flaccid and wet. Dripping water and what looked like oil. I couldn't really eat the rest so i returned it. Once I did the waiter took it uncomfortably and walked away. After about 15 minutes of waiting he came with a manager who asked me what my problem was in a more or less confrontational attitude. \\n\\nI explained that the quesadilla was awful to which she told me I ate over half. I explained that I ate the rice and would be happy to pay for that. She told me no and said that I ate almost the whole thing. My partner being uncomfortable didn't want this to escalate as she continued to argue with us while people watched and the waiter stood in disbelief. I then asked for the check as I wanted to leave extremely upset at this point.  The lady made me wait 20 minutes for the check. At this point livid she comes to the table. Saying \\"just this time I'm going to do this but next time...\\" implying that she removed the order. \\n\\nI said there won't be a next time... stopping her before she could finish she then walked away and recharged us the full amount returning a few minutes later. \\n\\nContacted them via Facebook to see if this was seriously how they do business.

One Italian place was fully booked, another one didn't have availabilities right away, but checking OpenTable, Pasta da Pulcinella had a few slots available. Done! The setting was really neat, in an old house in Midtown. There was an appealing patio with seating but due to the finicky summer weather, it was deserted. \\n\\nOur trio shared the bruschetta ($6) and gorgonzola walnuts & goat cheese truffles ($10) as starters. I should also mention that there was complimentary bread served as well. The bruschetta consisted of crostini topped with either shiitake-eggplant mixture or tomatoes and goat cheese. The three cheese truffles were coated with herbs and poppy seeds. The accompanying veggies were really good. Then there was a dollop of smooth ricotta cheese to the side. Interesting. The bruschetta was pretty standard; the truffles were good.\\n\\nMany mains sounded terrific, and it was hard to decide on one. Eventually I settled on the tortelli de mele ($16) since it's the house signature dish. This entree nabbed me with the combination of Granny Smith apples, sausage, and paramigiano filling in ravioli, all in an appetizing brown butter and sage sauce. If you like ravioli, Pasta da Pulcinella is your spot! Usually pasta places seem to have 1-2 ravioli options, but I counted 5 on the menu here that night, wow. The ravioli wasn't bad, but I probably was secretly hoping for a more powerful apple taste since I love the sour punch Granny Smith apples have. I thought it was minimal. The pasta itself was okay however I think a few other restaurants around town may have been able to squeeze out a few more happier looks from me.\\n\\nTo round out the dinner, I ordered the cheesecake of the day ($6) which was chocolate. The cake part was excellent and just how I like chocolate cheesecake: rich, dense, and full of chocolate. However, the crust was a nonexciting graham; I believe a chocolate cookie crust would've worked better. Our waiter actually steered someone away from the cannoli. The resulting selection, chocolate later cake, was rather delectable. The tiramisu-eater seemed to like that dessert.\\n\\nOur server was very hospitable and knowledgeable.

I would be first in line to buy it in bulk if they would just package and sell it.\\n\\nThis is a go-to spot for friend reunions for me.

Pretty sure the sauce came from a jar.  But worse was even though they weren't busy (only ONE other table had people) - tables were dirty and we had to wait for a seat - unless we wanted to ask the one other table of people to move, so some of us could get behind the loooong row of tables/chairs lined up (or, I suppose, sit in a line, beside each other).  Only 4? tables had \\"table cloths,\\" and all of them were the cheapo plastic (which is understandable considering what you're there to eat) but they were worn out.  I happen to know that Meijer is selling cheapo plastic table cloths for $2.99 each.  $12 would go a long way, JP!  Then the staff person acted like she was doing us a favor cleaning off a table (wiping all the food from the prior guests onto the floor with a big towel, leaving the table sticky and certainly not clean) and taking our orders.  One of us had noticed the price discrepancies in the prices of the sides, and she said she didn't know why there were price discrepancies.  (crickets....)  Our meals came and there were two rolls placed on top of the meals and they were obviously not freshly made, not warm, just bleh.  The sides were a JOKE.  They came in these tiny little cups & approximated 2 tablespoons full.  It didn't matter though, because they were absolutely TERRIBLE.  The baked beans were indeed not baked, and had the same jarred sauce as the ribs.  The potatoes au gratin were cooked beyond recognition and I doubt made that day, and I certainly doubt made from scratch.  We had no silverware, had to ask for that.  We all got one napkin each.  At a BBQ restaurant???  No wipes.  We asked for more, didn't get them, so one of us \\"stole\\" some from one of the loooong row of tables/chairs.  No one asked if we needed more drinks or if we wanted anything else, if we were happy with our meals, nothing.  The one good thing I can say, is that the ribs were tender and not overcooked and were pretty good, considering the \\"typical\\" tasting sauce.  For three people, for what I just described, it was $64.  SIXTY FOUR DOLLARS !!!!\\n\\nStay home, folks.\\n\\nIt's such a shame too, because the restaurant is at a small airport and not in an area over-populated with restaurants ... the atmosphere COULD be really cool, the food COULD be really good, and the place COULD be packed with hungry, appreciative guests with people standing in line to get in the door.

Your burger is served in foil, and for a moment you may even be convinced that In-N-Out has made its way to the East Coast, but it only takes one look, or perhaps bite, to remind you that you are far from California.\\n\\nLees, to me, is the type of place that should have peaked in 2006, when the Super Size Me era was convincing Newton liberals to shop local.

Italian food deserves all caps because Italian food is tear-inducing yummy. I love my pasta, I love my cream base, and I love my wine. So, I'm always on the lookout for great Italian joints in ATL. I suggested Pulcinella to my friends when I did a quick search for Italian on Yelp, and boy am I glad we came here! I literally wolfed down my food without sharing because it was that good. Okay, maybe I shared a bite or two. I ordered the Caprese ($7) as appetizer and Tagliatelle Verdi Alla Bolognese ($17) as entr√©e. I also tried my friend's Bruschetta ($6), Chicken Cannelloni ($18), and Lobster Ravioli ($19). \\n\\nMy Bolognese though... that's some mouth-watering pasta. It's spinach tagliatelle with a hearty rag√∫ made with veal, beef, onions, carrots, celery, tomatoes, and a hint of cream. THAT SAUSAGE! So savory and juicy. What I love about this? This dish was the only one on the menu that was of ginormous proportion. I love food and I have a big belly to fill and I can't help but have an upside-down smile at some of these miniature entrees that I would need to eat three of. But, this Bolognese was the size of my head (YAS!). Plus, so hearty, so yummy, so much flavor! \\n\\nThe next thing that stood out to me was my friend's lobster ravioli. The cream sauce the ravioli was served in was such an intriguing concoction. The flavor as it first hits your palate, is completely different from what you taste after.

Was it a lackluster impression on me?  Maybe.  But one thing's for sure.. it's truly NOT a lackluster spot for the locals.  Lines out the door for dinner.  Same southern-style bites.  Same Mark and Stormy with slightly less spicy bite than the one made 8 years ago though...

Love that!  (no one hates to make the liaison feel bad about relaying the information to their barbacks and chefs).\\n\\nSo, to sum it up... still going strong, clearly.  Some slightly weak spots food/drink-wise, but I love the consistency in flavor offerings.  And will plan to go back for fish and chips (hoping they're as good as 8 years ago!)\\n\\n--------------------------------\\n\\n11/14/2008\\nEn-route to Redbones via Highland Ave, Dave and I drove by the adorable blue sign exclaiming in white swirls \\"Highland Kitchen.\\"  Let's check it out! we said to each other through telepathy.\\n\\nThe variety of simple and intriguing menu items offered at a reasonable range of prices is what finally drew us in.  Upon entering, we both notice it's instant charm through metallic-flecked paint and sheeny menu.  Bar area with plenty of bar-area seating to the left, open dining area to the right.  The lighting was just right and the decor was subtly funky with great colors to boot.  It was relatively early and we were seated right away.  Fantastic!  \\n\\nImmediately, I knew I would have to report back to Yelp on this one.\\n\\nI couldn't help but begin to describe this establishment as a strange, but powerful love-child of Green Street, Hungry Mother, and what once was B-Side Lounge.  Why?  Perhaps it was the deviled eggs offering, or the blue cheese fondue, maybe it was the lengthy listing of sides from smoky collards to mac n cheese to a bowl of pickles or olives, or perhaps it's southern hits of gumbo and fried plantains.  Who knows.  But to the credit of HK, it shouldn't really be compared to others.  It's definitely unique in itself.\\n\\nItems to note:\\n + The Mark & Stormy was a drink of dreams.  Simply, it was made with Makers and Chili-infused Ginger Beer.  The flavor was a perfect balance of spice burn and sweetness.  I couldn't get enough.\\n + The fish & chips were prepared the proper British way: thick-battered and a whole fillet.  Steamy, properly seasoned, and just plain yummy.\\n + The cuban reuben was pressed proper, topped with pickles, cheesies, pork, and corned beef (or pastrami, crap, i forget), perhaps not on a flat grill, but still well pressed and not over-greased.  Okay, also, it was my first cuban.\\n + The snack list is pretty sizable.  Makes me wanna go just to get drinks and snack foods instead of dinner.\\n + Live music on Sundays, no cover charge, starts at ten.  I'm going on 11/30 for Michael Tarbox.  Whooo!\\n\\nOverall, I wasn't disappointed really about anything except that I wish they gave me more pickles."},{"name":"Pine State Biscuits","address":"1717 NW 23rd Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"I had a fried egg over hash browns with saut√©ed mushrooms, onion and cheese.

Their milk teas and bubble milks are always super creamy and even as the ice melts don't taste watery. Be aware that this place is a pretty hard on the wallet.

The tea was pretty sweet with a nice fragrant lavender flavour and the egg pudding was wonderful with a good spongy texture and rich taste. One thing I don't like here is that they don't advertise the option to adjust sugar and ice levels for drinks (maybe it's possible to ask, but I've never tried). Generally the ice level is pretty reasonable but the drinks may run a little sweet for some people.\\nMy waffle was alright, the texture was good and the honeydew flavour was there, but it was very very subtle - there were about 3 bites I took where I would have been able to tell the waffle was honeydew flavoured if I hadn't already known.\\nI think the design concept of the shop is cute with the wall of small goodies and bubble tea paraphernalia for purchase, and the amount of seating is ideal, but it's rather cramped - it seems like they could try to rearrange a little so that the main counter is more accessible."},{"name":"Salt & Straw","address":"2035 NE Alberta St","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"Of course we needed to cram another ice cream stop into our days in Portland.

A photo of a bowl of ramen with beef labeled bowl of ramen with beef that has beef, egg, bamboo shoots in a brown broth resulted in a bowl of noodles (not ramen) in clear broth with shredded beef, no bamboo shoots, no eggs, and a completely different vegetable. \\n\\nWhat was the response when we asked for the menu and asked why the photo doesn't match the dish?  Some finger pointing to some fine print on the menu saying the photos don't represent the dishes. \\n\\nWhat the?????  When did restaurants start having fine print on their menu stating that the photos aren't representative of the food?\\n\\nWhy bother even having the photos?  It felt like a major bait and switch!  $18 for a dish containing 10 pieces of shrimp when the photo for the same dish had maybe 20 pieces of broccoli (all nowhere to be found)  and copious amounts of shrimp with walnuts (walnuts nowhere to be found). The sauces weren't even the same. \\n\\nI think it would be ok if they simply served smaller quantities of food matching the photo or even subtle differences but to be completely missing major elements of the pictured dish is very weird. \\n\\nThere were no apologies for this. Just pointing to the fine print. \\n\\nTHAT SAID...\\nWhatever was served was made pretty well and tasty for me. I think the chef definitely can cook well and that maybe whoever did the marketing for the restaurant has NO IDEA what they're doing. \\n\\nI don't think anyone likes to be fooled though so it's really a shame what they're doing here. I can't possibly be the only one confused about misrepresentative photos so I'm surprised that they haven't already done something about it.

I ordered my food @6:30-6:45 as I sat at the bar. The bartender placed my order & brought my beverage. I ordered simple apps: fried cauliflower & chicken quesadillas. The fried cauliflower came out 7:55 they were soggy & not good. I asked about my quesadillas I was told they would be out shortly. I asked if Management was available I was told he was too busy, I was meeting someone @ 9:30 nearby so I asked the bartender to remove quesadillas and cash me out it was about 9:10 when I left and had not gotten anything not an apology, no food nor the dessert that I came in for. I frequent Cheesecake Factory Cumberland often and have NEVER received such bad service. I feel my time is very valuable and I wasted over 2 hours at a restaurant where I didn't get any food. I called today & spoke with the manager Christy, she apologized and said she didn't work that shift last night. So I asked for the GM or DM and she told me she wasn't allowed to give out that information and referred me to call the corporate office tomorrow. This is the most ridiculous & irresponsible way of handling a paying customer.

Otherwise there is a parking garage (free) and a parking lot (free) with an attendant booth about 2 min walking distance from Southern Kin. I will warn not to park in the parking lot of TJ Maxx and the other stores in that plaza as the sign says the lot is reserved for those customers and violators will be towed, so park at your own risk if you choose. With that being said, \\n\\nLet's begin with brunch on a Saturday afternoon. Now you can make reservations here but both times I went on a walk-in basis. The place itself was nice decorated and has that homey atmosphere with a little spunk. The hostess' were friendly and you are given the option to opt-in for text message when a table for your party becomes available. Now this place first impression really had me way to excited to try everything as I'm one of those people that stares at everybody's plate as I make my way to my table: golden biscuits here, chicken and waffles there, gravy and biscuit down there, chicken everywhere. Jeez I couldn't wait to place an order. My friend and I ended up indulging ourselves in the chicken and waffles with sides of home fries (pickles top the fries btw) and biscuits. For the portion given, the price was reasonable. The biscuits are BEYOND good, please try. The combination with the honey butter and/or jam is divine. The waffle even had a kick to it, it's not your regular buttermilk waffle. Honestly, we devoured our food so fast, honestly a great impression. The only thing I was not crazy about was the hot sauce, but I'm really picky with my sauces; I like a serious kick and heat. I could pass on the hot sauce, but everything else was magic. \\n\\nDinner on a friday night was okay to be real. I wanted my friends to try to the biscuits so bad again, they were good but as good as that first time I went. Two of them had the chicken and waffles, both waffles were way too crunchy. I personally tried the shrimp grits, I was good but not good enough to make me want to order it again. It's just missing a certain kick to really bring it to the next level. I would like to add that one of the cooks sneezed and did not really do so into his arm. Now I don't mean to be super intent about this, but if you're around food please take extra precaution and at least WASH YOUR HANDS BEFORE touching a plate.

The lady at the cashier, I was not sure if she was punking me, acting to a play a part, or that was just her normal self.  She was overly friendly (I am telling you, I get southern hospitality, but this was borderline eerie), and tried to fill me up on more than the biscuits.  When I ordered the biscuits, she insisted a sauce to them topped in, since she insisted, I told her I will get hot sauce on both (or Nashville style, which is 50 cents extra).  I paid, then went to the other side.  Food came out pretty much instantly.\\n\\nThe lady who gave me the food said the sauces are in the jars.  Whatever the hell that means.  I mean, yea, I see them right in front of me, but what was the \\"Nashville style\\" I just paid for, what was that?\\n\\nIt was time to see what it was all about.  When unwrapping the biscuit, I noticed no sauce on the biscuits.  So, is Nashville style just a scam?  I proceeded to cut the biscuit into 3rds.  Mind you, it is a small biscuit.  Is the value there?  Not really.  But the one alarming thing is that even though I had a small 1/3 of a chicken biscuit, it was kind of tough to swallow.  I needed an entire glass of water to rinse down a kid's size portion of chicken and biscuit.\\n\\nI think the unfortunate thing is that since I had that going on, I couldn't really capture a flavor profile.  Was it sweet?  Was it salty?  I really can't provide that answer for you.

The chicken parm was the largest piece of crisp but tender breast I've ever had and the cheese perfectly melted.  The lobster raviolis were enormous and there were 8 of them in a creme sauce with even more lobster tossed in.  The octopus appetizer was also huge and well prepared!  However, given the wait, we were expecting to be absolutely blown away by some magical flavor profiles and we weren't. Sure we would come back, but would we wait over an hour?

This location is always busy when I dine here which is a good sign even though their spacious restaurant. There's different dining rooms which I liked. There is a second level dining room that opens up to offer outdoor seating in warmer weather. On the first floor, there is a dining area with tons of booths, a bar/kitchen in the center, and a covered patio dining area. For parking, I just park in the shopping center next to it because there's almost never any parking spots in front of the restaurant. \\n\\nFOOD:\\n- Chips & Salsa: chips & salsa are complimentary at all times. The salsa is very unique and different here. The salsa takes very tomato-like with a hint of cracker pepper. \\n- Guacamole: I liked the Guacamole. It went great with the unlimited chips.\\n- Queso Americano: Also a great dip for sharing. Could not get enough of queso!\\n- Salmon Salad: I am a fan of this salad. I don't think you can go wrong with this salad. The agave green chile vinaigrette that came with it is very good.\\n- Steak Quesadilla: very good and cheesy. This tastes great with the queso, salsa, and guacamole dips.\\n- Nachos Cinco: I thought these nachos were okay. \\n- Steak Tacos: the taco entree comes with three tacos; two dips: salsa verde and salsa; Mexican rice; and refried beans.\\n- Pollo Adobao: I really liked this entree. The two grilled chicken breasts are juicy and tender and it goes great with the red pepper sauce. Underneath the chicken breasts is the sweet corn risotto. The risotto was very good. The entree was so plentiful that I had a bunch for lunch the next day and it all was still good.\\n- Carne Asada: the skirt steak was very good and it went well with the chorizo mashed potatoes (which I found very unique).\\n- The drinks are pretty good here. I liked the pomegranate margaritas. \\n\\nService is pretty good. One time I dined here for a friend's birthday and they gifted the birthday girl with a tres leche cake with a lit candle which I thought was nice.\\n\\nOverall, I will continue dining here as I would like to try more of their entrees.

As it was our first time, I had to order a good sampling, so I went with the \\"Pit Boss,\\" which consisted of three meats and three sides. I ordered the smoked turkey, brisket, pulled chicken, and added the pulled pork for the meats. The mac & cheese, brussels sprouts, and pit beans for the sides. My wife got the fried chicken basket (all thighs), with sides of fries and the bread & butter pickles. \\n\\nOverall, everything was pretty good. First, the meats. The brisket was a bit dry, so eating the fat cap was necessary to really get the best of the meat. The slices were also really thick (1/2\\" to 3/4\\" thick!). The pulled pork was also a bit dry. The pulled chicken and the smoked turkey, though, were really good! I tried the three sauces, and all were pretty good. Their hotter sauce was my favorite, but beware of putting too much on. The first few bites don't seem hot, but it builds quickly! Their mustard bbq sauce is good, as well. The sweet sauce was my least favorite, but it wasn't bad. I like when places let you control the amount and type of sauce, so you can explore a bit. The pork \\"needed\\" sauce to me, but the rest of the meats had enough flavor as-is. My wife didn't LOVE her fried chicken, but didn't hate it either. She put it in the average rating, but perhaps would've liked it better had it been more than just thigh meat. \\n\\nThe sides were good, as well. The pit beans were really tangy and sweet, and full of meat. A really heavy side, so I'd recommend for smaller plates/combos. The brussels were also really good. The mac & cheese was pretty basic, but no complaints. The b&b pickles were good, but could've been a little more crisp. The side of pickles onions seemed odd, but I made good use of them (I love pickled onions!). The fries were good, but standard crinkle fries. \\n\\nI also ordered the \\"Bramblin' Man\\" cocktail (I think that was the name). A Jim Beam-based cocktail, with cider shrub. A perfect Fall cocktail, and the apple crisp garnish is so good, I wish I could've had a bowl of those as a side!\\n\\nOverall, the only real shortcoming was the dryness of the brisket and pulled pork, which can happen from day-to-day and brisket-to-brisket, so I'll have to go again before I assume it's always this way. Otherwise, I was happy with our first visit and wouldn't hesitate to return!

The food is four stars. My main issue was with the bartender and her lack of service. \\n\\nLet's break it down... First impression of the place, the hostess opened the door for me as I was walking up (yay), I met my date and sat down at the bar, which is literally right at the front door (yay lol) and made a silly comment about the sun which was shining brightly through the front windows (we had just been through a constant three days of clouds and rain so it was a lovely surprise). The hostess and bartender laughed and joked with me about the sun, I love instant connections like that. (yay) Little did I know, that would be the last time the bartender would acknowledge me (boo). \\n\\nMy date and I were at the bar for another five minutes while they were prepping our table and she (bartender) never asked if I would like anything. The restaurant was buzzing a lil with customers and there was one other person besides us at the bar. I finally got her attention again and asked for a water and at the same time the hostess informed us our table was ready. The bartender replied, \\"There's water on your table.\\" WOW really?! I get that she wasn't excited to serve a water but had she paid me any attention before, I was wanting a water and prossecco; I had just given up by that point and opted for one. My date (whom she had served a beer to before I arrived) even jokingly made a comment asking what I did to upset the bartender. \\n\\nOnce seated I finally had some water and ordered the prossecco from our server. Food and service were both four stars. We split the bruschetta and I had the chicken ravioli which was delicious and perfectly spicy. Lots of excess sauce on this dish (thanks to our server for informing me). My date had the house special pasta. I ordered a glass of red to go with my entree, which I had to remind the server of once my entree arrived. Of course we joked that the bartender knew who ordered it and still didn't want to serve me LOL.\\n\\nWe split the tiramisu (not the best but ok) and a couple of cappuccinos. My only issue while we were dining was we were interrupted twice when we first sat down bc apparently my date hadn't left a signed receipt at the bar. Now I fully understand servers (and in this case the bartender who decides who to serve) need receipts to close out a tab. Could this not have been brought with the bill for the meal instead of interrupting us about it twice?\\n\\nThe atmosphere is incredibly charming and a perfect date spot. Prices are very reasonable and food is delicious!

We asked the waitress if we could have them sing to him or something for his birthday (he was so excited for this as he's never been able to do this) the waitress told us they don't do that and walked away. She didn't offer anything else at all. She also seemed super annoyed with us from the start when we didn't order appetizers. At the end of our meal we asked the lady at the front if this is typical and she said the waiters/waitresses usually get to choose if they want to sing but typically they bring out a dessert. I also looked up online at other Chuy's and saw they do sing and usually bring a dessert. Not sure why our waitress handled it so poorly but it broke my 4 year old's heart. I hope this doesn't happen to any other little kids and that this review will get management's attention to address this issue with their employees.\\n\\nUpdate: I reached out to Chuy's corporate and no response.

We were there opening weekend around 5pm and there were about 12 people in front of me.  Now I know that it sometimes takes a few weeks (maybe never) to work out the kinks in someone's business, but when you say you are open I assume you have trained your staff.  The woman taking orders clearly wasn't trained.  She had no idea how to use the POS system, what prompts would occur when someone ordered something, etc. I felt this was really unprofessional on the owners part.  You only get one chance to make a first impression and mine was that this place was half-assed.  It took over an hour to just place my order with only 12 people in front of me.  Completely unwarranted and uncalled for, but the real problem was that no one addressed the people in line. It wasn't like there were 50+ people and that was the reason why it was taking so long, it was because they were not able to take orders efficiently because their staff was not trained (well). At another well respected BBQ place in Orlando \\"cough\\" 4 rivers \\"cough\\" we've received water, lemonade, even samples in line.  The owner nor any of the staff even said anything to us, offered us some water, maybe a sample of the Que, nothing.  \\n\\nMy wife sat down while I was in line, and the waitress walking around asking if people needed anything completely ignored my wife but helped the couple next to our table.  When she was finally able to get service, the waitress asked if someone was in line.  We thought this was odd, since why would my wife be sitting there if we weren't getting food?? Just a running theme for this place that their staff are not trained well to deal with customers.  My wife had the salad with beets in it, and she did not care for it. I have to say it was a little sad.  It was a whole plate of frisee without much for toppings.  She would break a smile when she found a teeeny tiny bit of beet but that would be wiped away by the fact that there were maybe 3 bits in the whole salad.  For the price you expect more.  Fries seemed to be of the frozen variety, and the yucca while good is better at Black Bean Deli. My wife enjoyed the corn, and I tried their ribs and butter chicken taco.  Butter Chicken was pretty decent but i dont' know if I'd get it again.  Ribs were out of this world, but could have had a little more bark to them (if you know Q you know what i'm talkin about)  After reading reviews of their other sandwiches and the bread being meh, i might stick to ribs or brisket.\\n\\nSo after all of this why did I give them 3 stars? Well, 1) Mills needed a BBQ joint.  Sometimes I don't want to drive to Winter Park to get good Q.  2)While I don't care much for the BBQ sauce I tried (I asked for spicy and sweet and was only given one little cup of sauce so not sure what they did there) their Ribs are hands down my favorite in Orlando. 3) I like the concept of BBQ fusion, and would like to see it thrive. \\n\\nI won't be back for a few months. I just don't have the time, energy or effort to deal with untrained staff so hopefully they get that fixed, but I would like to come back and see if anything has changed."},{"name":"Las Palmas Cuban Restaurant","address":"351 N Donnelly St","city":"Mount Dora","stars":"3.5","text":"OOOOOOOO WOW.

I didn't get that fresh, doughy taste from the actual flatbread. I was expecting something more like naan. The Thai Chicken comes with carrots, cilantro, grilled chicken, crushed peanuts, and a peanut sauce. It was good but nothing to write home about. The weirdest part was the cilantro didn't taste like cilantro, in my opinion. I'm not sure if this is because the peanut sauce masked the flavor or what but it was very strange. \\n\\nFlats will be my new excuse to take walks down the Centennial Park."},{"name":"Cuon - Vietnamese Street Food","address":"600 SW 4th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"My husband and I were traveling from San Diego to Seattle and decided to stop off in Portland to sight see for a couple hours and to grab dinner while we did so. \\n\\nNot accustomed to the cold and rain, I declared pho sounded like a grand idea.

Mississippi.  My daughter and thought we would try for brunch on a Sunday.  We arrived about 11:00 a.m. and there was barely anyone in the place.  Seemed inviting though with fire pits, heated patio and just an overall cozy feel from the wood decor.  Immediately upon entering, I think even before the door shut behind us, the Lady Gaga look a like bartender let us know that we have to order at the bar.  Like we didn't see the huge sign indicating \\"Order Here\\", so I guess that's a problem for people.  I found the bartender a tad aggressive and would take that as frustration after a long day of serving, but the place wasn't even open for like an hour.  I ordered a Bloody Mary and asked for it not to be too spicy and she told me they basically have one speed but two versions - basic with not so special vodka and regular garnish, and better label vodka and more garnishes.  I wasn't looking for cheeseburger slider as a garnish, and house vodka is fine with me.  It turned out to be a good drink, just perfect in spice, and I was happy for $8.00.  So, we proceeded to order at the bar and find a seat.  My daughter ordered the eggs benedict and I order the fried chicken sandwich.  Both were just okay - nothing special and really presentation could of been better.  I could tell my daughter was not thrilled with her food, and there was barely any hollandise with the benedict, but we were both too afraid to say anything because Gaga was leering at us.  The benedict comes with potatoes with peppers and I swear I think I saw this exact same potato dish as frozen food at the market.  It didn't look good and tasted as it looked.  My fried chicken sandwich was on a very large bun and was okay - soggy in places and the fries that accompanied my dish just were trying too hard with parsley and cheese.  A basic french fry would be just wonderful.  I think this place would be fun on a cold winter's night with a glass of wine and a burger.

Prices are reasonable, saw lots families with kids there, service though good...a bit inexperienced (for instance the server setting her tray down on our two top table that was already small, lol maybe it's because I've been in the restaurant industry for so long that I notice these things). Food was ok. Definitely much better food and quality at other places around the area. We both got the roast beef dip and fries and an appetizer of these cheese rolls. It wasn't great but not terrible and did the job of filling us up. Atmosphere isn't anything special, there wasn't even background music on, space is small.

To start I really love the open layout and outdoor seating. It's really nice to have it opened up on a nice day. The staff were not just pleasant, but extremely helpful in assisting us with creating our perfect salad. They also let you sample dressings before committing. We started with their signature garden soup, which was really tasty. We ordered a couple of different chicken salads as well. The chipotle cream dressing definitely has some kick. I could eat it for a bit, then it was too much for me, but my friend likes spicier foods and really enjoyed it. We found that we like the heavy chop because you really get a bit of everything in each bite. Also much easier to eat. We had them do a light dressing and then she put some more on the side, which I think is the best way to go. It gets good and mixed in, but we could also dip our chicken chunks into the dressing and were able to add more later. Some people were complaining about the price, but we found it reasonable, especially for what you get. We had salad for 2 meals, and even if we hadn't tried the soup, we still would have taken some home. It also was still really good later that night. I think the heavy chop helps it hold up better. My friend has a sweet tooth and wanted cookies to go, so of course we did that. They were chocolate chunk and super delicious. I don't know about the comment of 2\\" cookies from a previous post, but I'd bet they don't know how big 2\\" really is. The cookies were thick and definitely bigger than 2\\".

You know those mornings.  You feel as though life has kicked you in the back of the head (repeatedly), possibly kneed you in the gut, and definitely at least slapped you across the face a few times.  \\n\\nOn these dreadful mornings, just about anything will do, as long as it's got some protein, a healthy dose of carbs, and at least a little grease. And coffee... lots of coffee. These are the days that we'll settle for anything as long as it's quick and it quiets the grumbling beast inside and greases the skids. \\n\\nIt was on such a morning that I stumbled upon Toast, a little unassuming neighborhood cafe on 52nd and Woodstock. Not only did it deliver exactly what I was looking for, but it gave me much, much more. \\n\\nThe menu is a mish-mash of creative inventions (sweet onion tart with poached egg and hollandaise sace on top), standards (french toast), and dishes you wouldn't normally see on a breakfast menu (a breakfast club sandwich).  The signature dishes, of course, revolve around the house-made thick-cut white bread toast.\\n\\nThis morning I opted for the blue plate special, pulled pork shoulder braised in a slightly spicy sauce piled high on a thick-cut piece of white toast and topped by a pached egg. This came with a rosti (a little round hash brown cake). The pork was deliciously seasoned and the combo of swine, egg, and bread was a godsend to my roiled and hurting stomach. My dining companions Ryan H ordered the French Toast (what one would expect to be a somewhat signature dish), and it was decent but not great. The slices were thick, grilled then baked, but the flavor was less than \\"amazing\\". His toast came with bacon and some fruit. \\n\\nThe highlight of the meal was probably the blueberry muffin I started with. It was a house made muffin that was tasty in it's own right, but when cut in half and grilled to a golden brown with a little butter on the flat iron, it was nothing short of stellar.  One bite and the deal was sealed. Grilled muffins are THE way to go. Yum. \\n\\nAs should be the case with all diner-style establishments, the coffee is strong and black. It's from some local roaster, which I appreciate, but still not as good as the thick, deep flavors of stumptown.\\n\\nThe breakfast bloodies and spritzers looked divine, and even though some hair-o-the-dog would have been a cure-all for my mid-morning hurtin', I opted to try the good ol' fashioned cure - time, food, and rest. \\n\\nThe service was top-notch. All friendly, all welcoming, all smiles. In fact, when the owner noticed that the pork on my order wasn't piled as high as the others coming out of the kitchen he, without asking, had another helping of the braised meat delivered up to me, just to make it complete. I had to ask why he was just handing me more food... That's what I call customer service. :)\\n\\nAll in all, I was very impressed with my food, but not quite as enthralled with the French Toast. It was good, but not stellar. For that reason alone, I am holding off on anything more than 4-stars until I have sampled some more of the menu. \\n\\nGood stuff, this Toast.

Went on a Saturday night and it was packed. I thought this would be a good sign and the pleasant aromas upon walking up to the establishment gave a good omen. That is where the pleasant experience ended. I walked up to see a long queue and then someone mentioned that there was no seating available at the moment and that I might want to get it to go. On the side they did have a place where you could order separately to get your to-go orders and the service was quick. This ends the last positive things I will stay about this restaurant. I ordered the two meat platter featuring the pulled pork and brisket. They enclosed two small packets of sauce and it appears you only have one choice of sauce. The pulled pork was inedible it tasted like cotton balls it was so dried out. I could taste that there was smoke flavor but even with the corn syrup sauce it was inedible. The brisket was better and it had a decent taste but again it was not tender it was dried out and probably the worst brisket i've ever had in my life. I did not try the chicken or the sausage that might be better; however, I would not return just to try them as a gamble. The two sides I had, macaroni and cheese and baked beanswere okay; however, I don't go to a barbecue restaurant just to enjoy sides.

Upon driving up and walking into 5 Guys, I was struck with a case of the disbelief giggles when I saw the red, black, and white color scheme along with the special potatoes in bags and the employees in red hats and t-shirts...deja vu for any exiled Californian.  But I thought to myself, I've heard some good reviews of this place, and there are tons of people here, much like In & Out, so I tried to keep an open mind.  \\n I was excited to see a 'small burger' option, so I ordered that with 'everything.'  Their version of 'everything' is lettuce, tomato, pickles, mustard, ketchup, mayo, grilled onions and mushrooms.   I was excited, because usually grilled mushrooms and onions are something you pay extra for, but here, they are standard...I would soon understand why.   My husband ordered a regular cheeseburger along with some fries to share and a couple of drinks.   \\nWhile we waited for our food, we snacked on some free peanuts that were offered around the dining room, which I thought was a fun, if not sort of out of place touch.  The wait wasn't too long until we were diving into our burgers.  \\nFirst off, and the most disappointing part, was the boring, soggy bun.  It was one of those pale, nondescript sesame seed buns that was way too soft to hold a hot greasy burger that had three condiments and a ration of fresh veggies and not fall apart.  My bun was instantly soggy, since it wasn't toasted or griddled, and was way too soft to stand up to all of the fillings.  The burger itself was quite tasty.  Moist, cooked nicely, if a little well, and slightly greasy like a good fast food burger should be.  I liked the fresh veggies and the combo of ketchup, mayo and mustard is always a welcome addition for me, but the so called 'grilled mushrooms and onions' were definitely not well cooked and added no flavor.  The onions were not even close to caramelized and the mushrooms were little slimy bits of veggie flesh that just fell out.  \\nNow one thing that could be deceiving about the sizes of the burgers is that the small size is actually just a regular sized burger with one patty.  The regular sized burgers have the same sized bun as the small ones, but offer two patties of beef, and 3 shock-inducing slices of American cheese for the cheeseburger that would make any lactose-intolerant person like myself go into dairy shock.  \\nThe fires were slightly thicker cut fries cut fresh from Idaho potatoes and were cooked nicely.  The only downfall was that they were so heavily seasoned that even I was getting a little throat-burn from all of the salt  (and people...I LOVE SALT).   \\nAll in all, it was a decent fast food burger and fries...far better than the likes of any of burgerville or mac d's...but, of course not up to the level of perfection that one would expect from a place so well-reviewed.  But if you think about it, the only two locations in the Portland area are in Beaverton and West Linn.  Most people in these neighborhoods are not native Californians and therefore have no idea how a fast food burger could be better than that.  But that's ok.

I never like that and I have to add a lot of salt and pepper to be able to really eat them.\\n\\nThe pancakes are ok - though I dunno why for the orange/cranberry one they would use dried cranberries?  That was an unpleasant discovery (even tho it states it clearly in the menu its dried) - it really just gave a super bad texture to the pancake to have to chew these dried hard cranberry bits.  At least soak them in some orange juice to plump them up a little bit before putting them in the pancake?  That one really needs a do over on the chef side. \\n\\nEverything is just ok.

The street is literally missing huge chunks, the parking (2 spots!) is in front of an abandoned or soon to be abandoned store and a liquor store that must double as a human trafficking safe house. The entrance to the restaurant is littered in trash, broken doors, old charcoal bags, stray pans, it's a mess. \\n\\nInside the restaurant was a little better but the outside seating (under a roof) was covered in pollen and dirt and we had to ask for them to wipe down the seats and table before we would sit down. He did wipe them down but when another family showed up, not one mention of \\"let me wipe these down for you\\". \\n\\nService was quick and as I said the food was good but we had 2 different waiters so one was never sure if the other knew what was going on. When we asked for more water, instead of bringing a pitcher of water, one of the waiters came out with 4 smaller plastic cups full of water and proceeded to pour it out of the little cups into our much larger styrofoam cups. Even my kids looked at me like WTF?  \\n\\nService wasn't much better for the people sitting next to us. The waiter brought out a vinegar based bbq sauce in a large squeeze bottle. The bottle accidentally fell over and proceed to douse the customer right in his lap and chest. The waiter panicked and grabbed the bottle to upright it but in his haste squeezed a huge portion of the sauce right into the customers chest, face and eyes. The waiter, instead of helping the man to hopefully regain vision in the eyes he just flooded with pepper vinegar simply said \\"It ain't BBQ if you don't get some on ya!\\"  My wife and I are horrible people and laughed about the entire incident for at least 15 minutes once we left. \\n\\nNot to sound sexist but this place needs a woman to run it.

When we took the bag back to the counter, and told them we were missing the sauces, she gave us an attitude, and then proceeded to say that they were out of the extra sauces we ordered. They could have told us before hand, but they choose not to. To top it off, once we got back to our hotel, we noticed our food order was also wrong. The chicken was bland and didn't have any flavor. The fries were good, and the sauce that we were able to get was ok. We have tried other Guy Fieri restaurants, and we have always had a good experience and the food was excellent.

The menu changes daily, and if you don't eat pork, the menu could be very tough - the menu is heavy on hot dogs, sausages and other pork products.  The first few times I dined there, I was surprised to not find steak on the menu.  \\n\\nThe set-up of the place (not sure if it qualifies as a fully-fledged restaurant) is a little odd.  There are just a few tables with mostly bar/counter seating.  There isn't much of a place to wait for a spot to open up, so you have to wait around the butcher block/kitchen island thing which is a little awkward because you feel like you are standing in the middle of the restaurant (which you actually are).  And the area is so small, it doesn't accommodate many people waiting...and you feel as though you are so close to the other patrons that you could be having conversations with them....\\n\\nThe wines are good but pricey.  I think the place is better as an early evening stop for a light snack and a glass of wine rather than dinner....or even a night-cap after dinner at another restaurant in the area.

No one told us they kept a wait list for the pool table either, after 20 mins another patron kindly let us know. At the table next to us, the manager was approaching three young ladies...two of which were heatedly refusing to eat and pay for cold food. They got up and walked out. It was after midnight and we decided to just bite the bullet and go to the area where waiters were to get something to eat. They took 10 mins to seat us, even tho it was late and it wasn't crowded. The waiter was rude and seemed aggravated. The girl who was supposed to have cleaned the area was visibly upset when we asked that she clean up the food she missed under our table.

We are on a short stay from the US and didn't have a chance to exchange US to Canadian dollars yet. They accepted USD but be forewarned that they will try to rip you off. We were a party of 6+ which they added a 10% gratuity charge on. When we asked what our bill would be in US dollars, they added an extra $7 and told us it was the tip. Sorry but the tip, as clearly stated on the bill, was already included. Per exchange rate, I should've been quoted $7 less, even factoring in gratuity charge. Waitress had a smirk on her face during the whole transaction. You can tell a lot about an establishment by how they treat their customers. The staff here was not honest and does not treat their customers with respect. It makes me question what other corners they would be willing to cut (in quality or safety) to gain an extra dollar at the customers' expense.

Now,  we love spicy but these seriously burned my mouth.   They were beyond hot, more than any other one ever had.   However,  what puts this place to a five star is their low prices and the variety and taste of salsas.  I tried all three levels of salsas and each was excellent.

As a Vietnamese food lover, Cuon really does it right.\\n\\nWe ordered the rice plate, vermicelli bowl and some spring rolls. With each option you can choose 2 different types of protein. I was able to try all of their options and they're all delicious! My favorites were the pork belly (amazing) and grilled meatballs. The other key component of these street foods are the sauces. The fish sauce was great, but I wasn't a big fan of their hoisin sauce or peanut sauce. The peanut sauce wasn't traditional and tasted more like a curry sauce. Portion size is solid, but pricing is a bit higher than other Viet restaurants. Each main item was a little over $10.  \\n\\nService here was really fast and friendly.

A carafe is only $5.00. \\n\\nBut the Bloody Mary Bar, that's the gem of this event. Order it (only $6.50!) and you'll be handed your glass of infused tequila on the rocks with a salted rim. Then you have your choice of mixes: Zing Zang for you pansies out there, and Swift's Attic's house mix for a more spicy, robust and flavorful experience. It's a rich, thick mixture with jalapenos, pepper and a house recipe of spices. On top of that, choose from Spanish Olives, Bleu Cheese stuffed olives, horseradish, all sorts of peppers, a vast array of hot sauces, fresh lime wedges, spice mixtures, bacon, celery... anything and everything a person could want in a Bloody Mary in any combination, it's spread before you. \\n\\nFood-wise, if you have a less adventurous palate, opt for the Straight Plate. It will come with lovely sourdough toast, scrambled eggs (scrambled easy - but I'm sure you could specify otherwise), the most baconrific bacon you've ever put in your mouth, crisp taters,  and antelope breakfast sausage patties. If you haven't had antelope, you have to try this. So lean, not a bit greasy, tender and bursting with flavor. Ermahgerd good. Also: their portion size is perfect, not too large, definitely not too small. It's Goldie Locks approved. \\n\\nFrom looking at the brunch menu that was set before me and the brunch menu I see on their website, this is going to be a revolving door perhaps. I had an heirloom tomato starter that was flavorful, served with a nice dressing and fresh arugula. Our table also ordered the oysters, which were ooooooh so not my cup of tea.  The brine was overpowering and, in my opinion, had been supplemented with salt. It was like being dunked in the ocean by your buttheaded brother while your mouth is agape, choking down salt water and screaming \\"But whyyyyyyyyy!?!?!\\". It burned my nose. That being said... I'm overly dramatic and unsophisticated and I take my oysters out of the shell, plop 'em on a cracker and douse with lemon, horseradish and cocktail sauce. And I scream \\"But whyyyyyyy!?!?!\\" when I eat anything, so don't let that dissuade you from trying them. It's probably just a \\"me\\" problem. I also may have some unresolved angst towards my brother. \\n\\nMoving on. The Foie Gras PBJ Pancakes are definitely a fixture on the menu and a must-try. The idea itself is decadent, the reality, even more so. The Steak & Eggs were a big hit at our table as well, and their fries are beyond yummy - golden crisp and covered in a light, flaky cheese. *Muah*\\n\\nService is kind and prompt. My hat's off to Cody Budua, the assistant GM, for being wonderfully involved, welcoming, and helpful even when his shift ended. He even put my kiddo in an under-the-table prison of barstools, humoring her as she gallivanted through the lounge area. She eventually won over the parole board and was released on good behvior, being rewarded with PopCorn & A Movie - Their must-try dessert. Thanks for putting up with us!!!\\n\\n(On that note, no, I would not necessarily say this is somewhere to bring your children, especially for a crowded service, UNTIL they are of the age of being capable of sitting still and displaying good manners.)\\n\\nI'm definitely a fan and I'll definitely be back - Hopefully on the 24th with a bachelorette party for Brunch...

Beef brisket was reinvented and made delicious by Pg Floyd's I understand a bit more recently. Though I am no historian, or historically accurate, historically speaking this brisket is reminiscent (taste-wise) of a great barbecue place I went to once in Nashville, TN. \\n\\nWe went to Pig Floyd's last night for the first time to have some dinner and I was blown away! I had the Mills50 Cheesesteak. Their brisket is so good! It has a delicious smokey flavor, is juicy, and has perfect texture - not too chewy or hard and not too soggy either. I was also impressed with their homemade pimento cheese. I wish I could describe the pimento cheese to you but if I did then you wouldn't have to go try it for yourself. Just do yourself a favor and go try the cheesesteak. It's not your typical cheesesteak. The portions were good and the fries were excellent and seasoned to perfection. They have other interesting things on their menu like tacos, platters, and some gluten free options. I am also intrigued by the Matahambre sandwich which I will more than likely try at my 2nd visit to Pig Floyd's. \\n\\nIt's a pretty cool-looking place too with rustic design, metal seating and a cool (though small) bar. It's okay though because if you come here you're going for the brisket and not for the bar. However, in a nice Ball brand mason jar I did enjoy a Cigar City Maduro beer which they had on tap who's smokey hues went well with my smokey brisket. \\n\\nOh I also want to mention they have a nice, spacious outdoor eating area but we didn't eat outside because we figured it was probably too cold for our baby (yes, this place is family friendly so it should get another star for that). \\n\\nSo this place gets 5 stars from me for having amazing smokey brisket, a welcoming atmosphere, decent prices, beer, and an interesting menu with a range of choices that ignite my curiosity."},{"name":"Primizie Osteria Italian Cafe And Wine Bar","address":"1000 E 11th St, Ste 1500","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"This place is surprising.

I was familiar with lingui√ßa and yucca but had never had muqueca - on the other hand I've had my fair share of caipirinhas. Muqueca is a dish which inspired the restaurants name and the specialty there; in a nutshell it's a stew, traditionally with seafood and herbs in it, with no water in it and cooked over a long period of time. Variations have since been created and I ordered the one with plantains and tofu as my entree. Before the entree I had lingui√ßa and yucca as an appetizer, which came served with a side of a wonderful sauce of some sort. It was delicious. So was the caiparinha which was one of the best I've had since moving to Boston. \\n\\nThe prices are perfect, the service friendly and prompt and despite the long lines, it was well worth it - a very enjoyable, flavorful and fun meal.

The issue being that I had already waited an hour for the wrong thing to be delivered, so I asked if they could place a credit on my account since I'm a frequent flyer at this location, the woman who answered the phone said that she could give me $2 off my next order. Since that wasn't acceptable for me, I mean the delivery charge alone is $3, so she said she would send her driver out, to collect the pizza.  \\n\\nSo I left the pizza out on my front porch, I wasn't going to wait for the driver.

We came in to the restaurant and waited 5 minutes before anyone acknowledged us. When we were greeted we asked to sit outside but she sat us at a dirty table and told us she would send someone to clean it, don't know why she couldn't clear it herself but ok. Anyways nobody ever came to clear our table until we had to ask the young waiter to clear it for us (I must elucidate that himself and the bathrooms are the only nice things about this place). The waiter took our orders promptly however this was not reflective of the waiting time that was to follow. After waiting 35 minutes for our food it finally arrived. First off all the food was cold when we got it, not even luke warm. Just soggy and cold. I got the toasted ham and egg sandwich with a hash brown, the sandwich was alright but the hash brown was totally under cooked. Two of the girls got eggs and they weren't cooked the way they asked but this wasn't too much of a big deal. The worst part was my other friend got the club sandwich which was presented awfully. The bread was tiny and squashed it didn't even look like a sandwich. She complained to the waiter and he apologised (the only apology we received on this regretful afternoon) and said he would get a new one from the chef, however a couple of minutes later he returned with the same sandwich and told us the chef said it was fine and he wasn't going to make a new one. My friend asked to see the manager, so next thing the manager came down seeming quite vexed and irritable and ACTUALLY told us the sandwich was perfect and to eat it. The manager finally agreed quite begrudgingly to get the chef to make a new one. 25 minutes later a new waitress arrived down with another sandwich. At this stage we had all been finished our food for ages. \\"Finished\\" as in finished eating it not finished off the plate. All the food was absolutely disgusting, maybe it would have been a little more edible if it was served hot but overall the food was horrible. The waitress came to clear our plates and not once did she ask how everything was or if it was ok for us. I paid $13 for mine which is an absolutely outrageous price for a shabby sandwich. The customer service was abhorrent, I could never in my life imagine treating customers the way that so called manager did to us. One positive to be taken though was the young waiter who originally served us was very good and attentive, its just unfortunate he is working in such a horrible place. \\n\\nUltimately my advice to anyone thinking of going here would be stay far away from this restaurant."},{"name":"Hop's Chicken","address":"675 Ponce De Leon Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3","text":"I can't believe how bad this was!

The server, with a snotty attitude, replied that they couldn't do anything that was \\"off the menu\\".  We should have left at that point.  \\n\\nI ordered the yogurt \\"salad\\" for $9, which turned out to be, literally, a cup of yogurt with oil drizzled on top (this was not mentioned in the description) with a so little shredded cucumber in it that you could scarcely taste it, and no spices to speak of.  This was a \\"salad\\"???  By the time I finished trying to scoop out the oil (who wants worthless calories), there was little left.  And seriously???  NINE dollars for a cup of yogurt???  This could win the price for the most over-priced item I have *ever* ordered in a restaurant.\\n\\nNext up was the chicken kebab, at $18.  It was billed as \\"chicken and vegetables\\".    The chicken arrive- a grilled chicken breast, quite tasty.  But the \\"vegetables\\"?  Literally a quarter of a tomato, sliced in half, and 2 small narrow strips of some kind of green pepper.  Nothing more than a garnish.  Seriously???  $18???? \\n\\nNo one ever attended to our table.

The restaurant is located in an extremely trendy area near city hall with lots of cool boutique shops and eateries. When we got there we thought the menu had great variety, however we were one of two tables in the place on a Saturday night, when the restaurant across the street was packed. We were wondering why that was the case. Then we noticed the extremely loud phone on the wall right by our table was ringing off the hook. We thought that was an odd location and annoying, but because it was a hole in the wall was accepting of the ambiance. However when he waitress took our order she was not very social, didn't recommend anything or tell us about the specials.  We ordered appetizers, Pad Thai and coconut curry. We eagerly awaited out appetizers, but after 30 mins we sent out a search party!  Unfortunately the waitress turned easily frustrated and told us her sob story about the ton of take out orders they got in!  She had a very rude tone with my wife and did not apologize or promise to get out our food at any reasonable time frame, so we asked to leave. The only thing I actually tried was the Thai Iced Tea and that had a sour after taste. After asking for the manager who never came, we walked across the street and to BurgerFi. The nicest thing they did was give me my money back for the tea as my family and I were walking out.

I barely remember my last experience so I basically had a clean slate. I called 2 days before for a possible reservation (we needed a late one ideally 830) and fortunately they had an opening at 9, which was a little bit later than we wanted but we went with it. We ended up showing up 8:30 figuring we would get a drink at the bar and we were pleasantly surprised when we were seated right away. \\n\\nThe decor is nice, dark lighting, ideal for couples or maybe a small group. The tables are a little bit close together, but still probably more spaced out than most restaurants in the North End! \\n\\nSince it was Valentine's day, and both of our favorite pastime is eating out, we decided to go ALL OUT... and there were no regrets. We ordered drinks, he got a chianti and I got a mini bottle of prosecco (my favorite!). The waitress was BEYOND helpful from the very beginning and incredibly engaging and not to mention fast which from experience I know can be challenging on such a busy night. \\n\\nWe ordered the Antipasto for an appetizer and it complemented our fresh rolls and olive oil wonderfully. There was more than enough and the plate featured fresh mozzarella, provolone, a variety of olives, DELICIOUSLY fresh and thinly sliced proscuitto, salami, pepperoni, artichokes with some type of balsamic glaze, and tomatoes. \\n\\nFor my entree I got the filet minon, and with it we were able to choose 2 of about 6 side options. I chose the fresh grilled vegetables and potato gratin. I must say i was MORE than pleased with my entire meal. The steak was cooked perfectly and it was the largest size portion of filet i've ever seen!! Melt in your mouth delicious. The potato gratin was one of the best thigns I've ever eaten, and the vegetables were not as flavorful but cooked to perfection and drizzled with olive oil. \\n\\nin all honesty I don't even remember what Joe got... I know it was some type of fish and I know he finished it in less than 10 minutes and practically licked his plate clean. So I'm going to go with a positive review for that one... \\n\\nOBVIOUSLY we couldn't help but order dessert... so to go with my delicious shot of espresso we decided to get the chocolate lava cake. This dessert is generally very difficult to screw up, but this was really something special. Homemade whipped cream on the side and I was definitely put over the edge after that one. \\n\\nbut overall the entire experience was phenominal, and going anywhere on Valentine's day is putting a restaurant up to the test.

And while I would normally write a 4 or 5-star review of this place for its concept, atmosphere, offerings - I am purposely dinging it because sometimes a place that is fabulous, gets a little too fabulous and all that fabulosity gets in the way...and it all becomes pretentious.\\n\\nFor many years this was a really mediocre coffe shop, then a feeble attempt at a restaurant (where all entrees were just premade then nuked when ordered) - and then Butcher Shop appeared.  And conceptually it's really cool on a lot of levels - by day act as a high end butcher shop with funky meats like speck, proscuitto, pate - by night turn into a funky dark bar, serving finger food and ecelectic wines and beers while you wait for a table across at B&G.\\n\\nThe bar itself is decent-sized, and there's a decent selection of tables along the windows - not to mention, feel free to use the butcher block in the middle as a SRO hangout to enjoy your wine and apps when there's only SRO available.\\n\\nSince they originally opened they have added entrees (granted only 4 choices are so) - and I am not sure if solely that addition, or something else, pushed them ever closer to the edge where you go from funky to effing pretentious.\\n\\n5:00pm on a Thanksgiving weekend is usually dead if you want an early bite in this city - the city typically empties out for 4 days -  This year was no exception.  \\n\\nThis place was empty except the bar.  Every table but one was empty.  Perfect - pop in for a few glasses of beer or wine, a couple of salads/cheese plates - a nice quick little meal before heading off for more shopping or whatever.  Just what the doctor ordered.\\n\\n\\"Sorry, these tables are for people ordering entrees - you are free to stand at the butcher block\\"\\n\\nAnd that's when you realize that standing at the butcher block in an otherwise empty restaurant is much like being the first and only one on the dancefloor at a club.  Essentially you look like a retard - and for no good reason.\\n\\nLook, I know why you have those rules - to make sure a few drink sippers don't monopolize a table during a busy time.  And I repeat my philosophy that restaurants (when empty) should grow a pair and say \\"Hey look, you can have a table - but if there is a wait for a table and you still decide not to eat, I am going to need the table\\" - that puts it all on the customer to decide if they want to agree to the rules or go all Elaine Benes at the butcher block.  \\n\\nGrowing that pair would have resulted in us getting that second glass of wine, those apps/salads - which, in total would have put us well over the $100 mark btw.  \\n\\nBut instead we moved and found a more accomodating competitor which deserves the extra stars.\\n\\nMaybe next time"},{"name":"Five Guys","address":"2606 Cedar Hills Blvd","city":"Beaverton","stars":"3.5","text":"I always enjoy a fresh juicy burger at 5-guys.

Meat, cheese, beer, bread? That sounds like a place I can get behind. And overall, I think they are on the path to something good, but they're not quite there yet. \\n\\nI know they just opened, so I can't be too hard on them, but there are some things that I feel the need to point out:\\n\\n1. I was excited for the pretzel and ordered a big one for our group to share. It was half good/half bad. One part was plump and chewy and delicious and the other part was scrawny and hard and could barely be bitten into. Looking around at other tables I noticed other pretzels were fully on the plump and chewy side, so this can be chalked up to inconsistency and hopefully fixed. \\n\\n2. They charge $1 for a tiny thing of mustard for your pretzel. Yes, ONE EFFING DOLLAR for something that should be considered part of the pretzel order to begin with and that is the size of the little paper containers you put your ketchup in at P. Terry's or Wendy's. Ridiculous. \\n\\n3. The corned beef sandwich was the saltiest thing I have ever tasted. Almost inedible (almost ..). It took two more beers before my tongue no longer felt like a slug that got the wrong end of the salt shaker. And at $8, it was pretty damn small and came with absolutely nothing on the side. \\n\\n4. The beer selection was good, but it could stand to have more than 3 out of 22 be from Austin. One of my friends got a lukewarm beer, but the rest of us had some tasty pours. \\n\\nAnd speaking of pours, I did notice that the pours were inconsistent depending on the bartender you got. Ours were uniformly well done, but I saw some that came out with 2 inches of head, which has become a distressing epidemic in this town. This is especially sad given the rise of places in Austin that want to charge NYC/SF prices for their beers. We decided to adjourn to Lovejoys after we ate for an equally good beer selection, consistent pours, and geographically correct pricing. \\n\\n5. The staff were all super friendly, helpful, and knowledgeable. Nothing but good things to say about the folks we had contact with. \\n\\nBottom line for me at this point is great concept, \\"decent\\" execution.

A bunch of chicken, peppers, onion, other goods, and maybe, maaaaaaybe a shred or two of lettuce. In other words, my kind of salad! We asked to make this extra spicy which I highly recommend. This was definitely the best dish and if I came back I would try the Larb Salad.\\n\\nLast up was the Me Ka Tong (wide noodles with flank steak and broccoli). I saw maybe 2 broccoli florets and 2 pieces of steak, so this is perhaps mis-named. In retrospect, this is something that should be split between at least 4 people who want a couple bites of noodles. This was way too many noodles for two people! They were good but not amazing.\\n\\nThis place is huge, and they have an awkward open space to the side with no tables where it looks like a live band could perform.

The nachos had a weird cheese almost like melted velveeta but thicker and not as good. Made the chips soggy and not really that great. I didn't eat much of that. The Mac N' Cheese bites were pretty good but not amazing. I also got a pink cocktail drink but I can't remember the name. It was very sugary and I didn't finish it. I woke up in the middle of the night with stomach cramps and ended up becoming sick that night. The next day I felt fine and as that was the ONLY thing I ate that night I can only attribute it to that. Nobody else in my group became ill and felt fine so it might've just been a fluke. I've been to cheesecake factory multiple times in my life and will continue to go, just not order this particular meal again.

The pho overall is one of the best this place doesn't have choices they only have one kind which is the beef pho.. LOL \\n\\nThe rice plates/noodle plates overall is good. The pork patty/nem nuong is on point very flavorful and sweet. The chicken and pork are both seasoned well and gives a big portion of meat I even think too much but its okay! The roasted pork now this is THE BEST ROASTED PORK EVER... I'm not even kidding the meat is still juicy while the skin on top is very crispy somehow.. I couldn't believe it even putting it in the fridge overnight and reheating it the skin is still crispy I'm impressed. \\n\\nThe drinks here are on really good. They don't have it right now but the Ginger lemonade is very good.. also helps with sore throats I hope they bring it back soon.\\n\\nThe taro milk tea here is AMAZING fresh taro milk tea sometimes its a tad bit too thick but overall its really good. Try this with chia seeds! sounds weird but its not lol \\n\\nThe fresh rolls here are good but a tad big overpriced same with the Vietnamese sandwich... but I still get both anyways.

Nope, your bar just sucks, in my honest opinion. Other than the few common craft beers, the rest were American piss-water.

First impression: it's small. And cute. There is more seating area outside than in, but if you're lucky, you can snag the one large table in the back. I like the simplistic, straightforward menu and although I am usually not a meat-and-sandwich type of girl, a lot of the items looked surprisingly appetizing. I was craving salmon but given my newfound lactose intolerance, I decided to forgo the bagel/cream cheese and went for the gravlax (cured salmon) Caesar salad instead. What I liked about it: the greens were greens. Dark, delicious, good for you power greens. The salmon was wonderful - thick (but not too thick) and fresh. The caesar salad came with a balsamic vinaigrette that I am glad I ordered on the side and a few pleasant surprises: fresh rye bread croutons (yummy but not as crunchy as I like), fresh mint, pickled cucumbers, and two perfectly deviled eggs. I also ordered a jelly donut to go, which sadly looked better than it tasted.\\n\\nOverall, this is a good place to go to for lunch but I think the options are pretty limited if you're a picky eater or have dietary restrictions (lots of bread and smokey meats).

I got a combo steak and chicken bowl with mash (which is a great choice for brunch if you're eating a bit early), and the creamy sauce. While it is more expensive than your typical chipotle order, this is disney, so with that in mind, the prices are reasonable.

I've written in past reviews that I wouldn't really consider Atlanta's Italian food scene to be anything special, but there are a few old standbys that can't be overlooked - La Grotta, La Tavola, and of course, Nino's. (Dolce and BoccaLupo and the rest of the new Italian joints are a much different story!)\\n\\nNino's is what I would consider to be an \\"Old World Italian\\" restaurant, meaning it would feel right at home in a neighborhood in NY or Boston. The decor is dated, but in a way that I find charming. We're talking white tablecloths, dim lights, leather booths, brick archways, etc. It's a great option for date night, or any meal you'd like to feel a bit more intimate. Something about the lighting makes you just cozy up to whoever you're there with. \\n\\nOne thing that makes this place stand out is the service, which is nothing if not impeccable. The waitstaff work as a team, keeping an eye on everyone and making sure that you've got everything you need. Perfect example - we weren't crazy for the balsamic-roasted eggplant served alongside our burrata (mostly eating around it) and the server noticed from across the restaurant and came by to ask if he could replace it with something else. I love that attention to detail. \\n\\nThe menu is pretty large, and as everything is cooked to order you can make any sort of request you want. My BF doesn't eat pork, and it was very easy to get substitutions as needed. \\n\\nOn our most recent visit, we split the Burrata appetizer ($11), \\"served with prosciutto-roasted vegetables and arugula\\" per the menu. Because of the no pork thing, we wound up with a bed of arugula, thickly sliced fresh tomatoes, and balsamic-roasted eggplant all lightly drizzled in EVOO and balsamic. (To be honest, the eggplant was not my favorite flavor in the world but everything else was so light and fresh. Lovely, and a pretty large portion for an app.)\\n\\nThe BF ordered the Zuppe di Pesce ($28), a traditional Italian seafood stew, but expressed concern it wouldn't be enough food. The server suggested he add linguine and it came out on a thick bed of pasta. It was more than enough; he couldn't even finish the bowl, and said he really enjoyed it. \\n\\nI went off menu and asked for Pappardelle topped with the house Bolognese sauce, which they priced out at $16 for me (making it a cheaper option than almost anything on the menu, entree-wise). The dish was perfect - such comfort food for a chilly January night. \\n\\nPrices are a bit high, I'd say, but not to the extent that it would keep us from dining here again. (Dinner for two including a pretty decent tip was around $70.)\\n\\nParking limited not in lot size but in space size!

When we arrived, we knew we were ordering our normal burgers and fries but we were trying to figure out what shakes to get. I was excited about the shake of the month, s' mores, so we asked the young guy behind the counter how it was and he grabbed the sign off the counter and stuck it out at us. I told him I was aware WHAT the shake was, we were wondering HOW it was. We just decided to order the shake and hope it was what we wanted from it. The guy then told us hold on, let me pass the shake order on to the girl making shakes, left the counter to tell her and came back. When he returned the girl who was making the shakes was in tow telling him how much she hated him and then stormed off to make the shakes. We felt awkward and took our number to our table. As we were sitting waiting, every time a shake got ordered the girl at the counter got mad, which made me feel guilty for ordering the shakes because it was obviously annoying her. When the shakes arrived I was sad to see the marshmallows were not toasted and the shake was poorly mixed. The burgers were amazing and the shake was yummy once we mixed it ourselves, but the girl freaking out every time someone order a shake made me feel awkward and overall, this was the first time I didn't enjoy my experience. The entire time we were there the staff was goofing off, and my boyfriend commented that it seemed like the manager had the night off, leaving the staff to play around. I don't know if they were overstaffed or don't have enough responsibilities but I was shocked about how they were acting. I ended up just getting a box and taking my burger to eat it when I got home.\\n\\nOverall the food was what we expected but the staff made the meal unenjoyable.

The onion rings were huge, and the dipping sauce hit the spot, but the sandwich was just okay.  Generally, when you order a club sandwich it's on larger-than-average bread because... well, think about taking a slice of bread from a normal store-bought loaf and cutting it into fourths. You're left with some REALLY tiny wedges. That's what was done here, and the result was disappointing and inconvenient.  The sandwich itself was too small and the wedges fell apart immediately upon trying to pick them up because they were just too narrow. The sandwich tasted okay but wasn't different or special.\\n\\nThat said, I have been here once before and I remember being happier with my selection then, but it was over a year ago and I don't remember what I ate so I can't really base part of my review on that.

In the 90s, the restaurant was located on Peachtree.  These days, it's oddly (to me, at least) located next door to CosmoLava, near the Crescent Ave. club/bar district.\\n\\nThere is no free parking for the restaurant.  Instead, you either have to park in one of the pay lots nearby or parallel park in one of the metered spots on the street.  If you aren't staying for more than a couple hours, it's normally cheaper to street park than park in one of the pay lots ($5).\\n\\nReservations are recommended.  You can make them for free on OpenTable.\\n\\nThis restaurant is ideal for a date as the setting is intimate, elegant, and romantic.  The candle-lit tables are covered in white tablecloth and oil paintings decorate the walls.  It feels like you're dining in a nice home, sort of like Babette's Cafe in Poncey-Highland, if you've ever been there.\\n\\nPasta Da Pulcinella has a simple, but very appealing menu.  While the menu is only two pages, almost everything looks good.  The left-hand side consists of salads and pastas which have been the restaurant's mainstays since 1994.  The right-hand side consists of specials which change twice weekly.  You can see examples of some of their specials on their web site.  Expect to spend anywhere from $15-20 for most entrees.\\n\\nI've tried a few of Pulcinella's dishes.  They include:\\n\\nRegular Menu Item:\\nTagliatelle Verdi Alla Bolognese - housemade spinach tagliatelle with ragu\\n\\nSpecials:\\nPumpkin Ravioli - with browned butter, sage, toasted pumpkin seeds, dried cranberry, and cranberry juice reduction\\nGrilled Veal Chop - with walnut Gorgonzola mushroom stuffing, served over asparagus risotto and Worcestershire vinaigrette\\n\\nThe ragu in the tagliatelle is made from veal, beef, onion, carrots, celery, tomatoes, and cream.  It's a well-balanced, full-flavored meat sauce.  The spinach tagliatelle, along with all of the other pasta here, is made in-house.  This is a pretty basic yet fulfilling dish.\\n\\nThe pumpkin ravioli was a seasonal special.  It was very good.  The ravioli were very delicate and savory.  I'm used to ravioli with creamy sauces, but this dish was different.  Not as much sauce.  Instead, the ravioli were eaten with pumpkin seeds and dried cranberries.  Expectedly, it had a bit of a tangy taste.  I want to try their other ravioli dishes in the future.\\n\\nThe veal chop was delicious, but fatty.  The chop was huge and the walnut Gorgonzola mushroom stuffing was amazing.  The stuffing was aromatic and mouth-wateringly flavorful.  The risotto had slices of asparagus embedded within and it went well with the leftover, mild Worcestershire vinaigrette (I mixed the two together).\\n\\nService is excellent.  The entire staff is friendly and attentive, particularly the British-accented ma√Ætre d'.  Shout-out to Dylan, who provided great service.\\n\\nIn the end, Pasta Da Pulcinella gets a solid 4 stars out of me.  It's ideal for a low key, high quality Italian meal."},{"name":"Highland Kitchen","address":"150 Highland Ave","city":"Somerville","stars":"4","text":"So my boyfriend and I went last night becuase we saw Highland Kitchen on Phantom Gourmet. \\nHere is our rating of it.\\nFood:\\nThe food was Okay, and by okay I mean just okay nothing great, nothing fantastic nothing super.

We had an early dinner so it was pretty empty and service was extremely fast (and good- waitress checked in on us a lot.) We got a nacho appetizer to share and I got the grilled vegetable enchiladas. The nachos were good but a bit on the cheesy side for me (I'm more used to mozzarella than cheddar cheese). The grilled vegetable enchiladas came with a large serving of refried beans (my favorite!) so that was a huge plus. The salsa was also very fresh. The enchiladas themselves could use a bit more flavor, and the tops were coated with sour cream, which I prefer to be on the side. Another small thing is there are a lot of chipped areas in the paint on the walls, and a fresh coat would really help the place look more clean. The other parts of the interior design are cute and thoughtful and the chipped walls just don't jibe.

The sides of mac & cheese, slaw, and baked beans were fine - pretty standard fare at a BBQ place.  But, the BBQ is where they really fell down.  The chopped pork was extremely greasy, to the point where we left 50% of it on the plate.  The brisket was tender enough, but had a lot of fat on it that could have been trimmed off, if not seared off in the cooking.

I owed them a revisit a LONG time ago after one of the owners (no, not Mr. Ricker) reached out to me in regards to my original 3-star review and tried to make things right. Like an ass, I ignored that offer and went on my merry way, not even updating my review to indicate how nice it was that the business cared about my less-than-stellar experience and wanted to address the issue. \\n\\nFast forward from 2009 to 2012 and I can say that between the original follow-up from management, some changes in policy, and my retrying the food, I'm squarely impressed. \\n\\nPing no longer has that strange policy requiring you to order a minimum of 2 skewers of each type. Yay! We sampled a ton of different items for that reason alone and were summarily impressed by most, including the grilled shishito, the grilled pickled octopus, the quail eggs wrapped in bacon, muu sateh pork, shrimp and more. The only real dud was the eggplant - fairly boring. But that goes for most eggplant on a grill. I'm convinced grilling is not a great way to cook eggplant. \\n\\nThe other dishes we sampled were also quite moving - the pork steamed bun, the fried fish with spicy red sauce, the \\"egg salad\\" (a hard-boiled egg chopped with various herbs, scallions and a nice tangy fish sauce) and the yellow curry. While the Yellow curry was a little heavier on the lemongrass than I like, I'd easily order everything else on our plate again in a heartbeat. \\n\\nThe space is fun, the service is nice, the drink selection is good, especially if you like whiskey. That's one thing I always appreciate about Andy Ricker's bars... heavy on the whiskey. \\n\\nIt's been a while since I've been to Asia and maybe that distance has made it easier for me to spend $3.5 on street food skewers. It still stings a little, though (depending on which skewers I'm ordering). I think that the skewers here are a treat, but I'm actually even more impressed by the other dishes I've sampled, and I plan to return soon to make my way through even more of the menu."},{"name":"Maurizios","address":"364 Hanover St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"We came upon this small restaurant by chance, and were pleasantly surprised by the food, the atmosphere, and the service.

I also ordered four tacos ($2 each on Tuesday), listed according to how good they tasted: Taco Carnitas, Portobello Taco, Fried Chicken Taco, and Fish Taco. The Taco Carnitas was flavorful. The Portobello Taco was spicy but yummy as well. The fried chicken taco and fish taco were decent. It slightly bothered me that the bartender asked if I wanted the fish grilled or fried, and I asked for a grilled fish taco but received a fried one. That's not a big deal, though. What bothered me much, much more was that the upstairs bathrooms were disgusting and there was a dead fly in my to go box.

I ordered the gyro platter and it came faster than anticipated which is always a good thing. The to-go container was very neatly packaged which I always can appreciate. \\nThe gyro meat was shredded into tiny bits, and was nestled atop a bed of rice. The rice is neon orange (I thought it was shredded carrots at first!) and seasoned well. The platter also came with diced tomatoes, shredded iceberg lettuce, a little cup of red sauce, a cup of white sauce, and four little pita points. The red sauce is to me the perfect amount of heat for a hot sauce, but I think it would be considered extremely hot by most people, therefore if you have an aversion to spice I do not recommend you put it on your food. \\nThe white sauce is surprisingly bland. It's mayo with herbs, and I like mayo sauces so that didn't bother me. I would have just liked it to be a little more flavorful, perhaps with garlic? I mixed the white sauce in with my platter and gobbled the entire thing down in a matter of minutes, but I couldn't help but feel like it was missing something. In either case I know my feedback doesn't mean anything, since Halal Guys has been established for almost 30 years with presumably the same recipes so clearly know what they are doing. Overall very tasty and filling and a good option for lunch.\\n\\nEdit: also, the items on the ubereats app are more expensive than they are in-restaurant. I assume this is to make up for the percentage of the sale that Ubereats takes. For instance a platter is $10.95 instead of $8.99 and falafel is $2 instead of $1.

I don't like salsa from a can and I am fairly confident that this was canned. They served it with some pretty good potatoes, but they could have used some more seasoning and about 2 minutes less cooking time. \\n\\nMy wife's french toast was pretty tasty. My kids ordered pancakes which came with a side of bacon, sausage or ham and a small cup of fruit salad. The portions are definitely kid size, meaning small, which allowed my kids to clean their plate (very cool camping plates, BTW) rather than having a huge amount of leftovers which I always feel obligated to eat.

This place came up on Yelp and from the looks of the user ratings, I decided to give it a try.  This place is freakin' good!!!  How good you ask if I am using three exclamation marks at the end of such a bold statement?  Well, let us just say that I went back to this place twice more within the week to experience as much of the menu as I could since everything I ordered was delicious.   This place is definitely five-star worthy as the food and service were stellar.  Here are some of the things I remember getting with the French toast being a repeat choice because I am a huge fan of French toast in general!  \\n\\n** Griddled Bacon Wrapped Date (with maple syrup & almond)\\n** Open Faced Monte Cristo (with spiced maple)\\n** Auntie Paula's French Toast (with rhubarb-berry maple syrup)\\n** Moroccan Chicken Hash (with harissa cream & over easy egg)** Tasty Muffin (with fried egg, ham & cheddar cheese)\\n** The English Breakfast (with baked beans, over easy eggs, bacon, roasted tomato)\\n\\nBy the third time eating here, it was so difficult to choose as everything I had in the past was absolutely top notch and wanted to eat it again while being fought by the urge to explore more dishes.  Tasty n sons has an extremely diverse tapas style menu that caters to all taste palettes for any foodie who appreciates a great meal from a place that will deliver 100% of the time on what they do best.  Another interesting aspect of this establishment is that there is a meat deli shop at the back of the restaurant, which is pretty cool and not very common.\\n\\nWarning:  This place gets very crowded during prime eating hours since it is very popular which results in a decent wait time.  Also, I have learned from my experience and from watching Portlandia that apparently people here like to brunch very hard.  On our way out Sunday to head home, we arrived here at 8:45AM with a 9AM opening and 25 people waiting.  By the time 9AM rolled around, there was a huge line with about 70 people waiting to get in and get a piece of the culinary action.  You know a place like this doesn't have an insane line unless it's for a good reason, like serving awesome food!

The biscuit came with a honey butter that is similar to Texas Roadhouse' bread butter. It was okay, but I've tasted better ones at Sweet Cheeks. I got the turkey leg that came with corn, mac and cheese, and cornbread. The fried turkey leg tasted okay, but I assumed it would be juicier or more flavorful. It was a little bland in my opinion. The corn had a delicious sauce on top that made it taste even better. I wish I knew what the sauce was. The aged cheddar mac and cheese was the best side of them all. It even came in a mini skillet!

I wasn't completely blown away by the food, but it was definitely above average.\\n\\nThe chips and salsa are good.  Although the chips weren't warm, they tasted homemade and were soo addicting.  The salsa was pretty good too--good amount of spiciness.  \\n\\nWe also got some guacamole, which I probably wouldn't order again.  It was different than typical guacamole in that the avacado, cilantro, onion, etc. wasn't \\"mashed\\" together, it was served in chopped up pieces.  Although it was really good, the big chunks were kind of hard to get onto the chips.\\n\\nI do have to say I was pleasantly surprised at how good the margaritas are here!  I was nervous they were going to have that gross artificial sour-mix taste, but they were soo delicious...and strong! We spilt a pitcher between two people and could definitely feel it by the end of the meal :)\\n\\nFor our entrees, we chose the Pollo En Mole (chicken in mole sauce) and the Barbacoa De Puerco (pulled pork shoulder served w/ tortillas).  We thought both dishes were pretty good, but not excellent.  I think both could have been made at home and tasted the same...we weren't blown away.  One complaint is that the rice that comes with your meal looked liked regular brown rice.  I would have preferred Mexican-style rice instead.\\n\\nGiven the good chips & salsa, tasty margs, above average food, and the affordable prices, I think this is my new go-to Mexican spot!"},{"name":"BARbacoa","address":"2036 North High St","city":"Columbus","stars":"4","text":"So I've been to Barbacoa about three times now. Each time I have had some sort of BOGO coupon or free taco coupon. I don't think I would eat here unless there was some sort of promotion going on. The prices of the tacos are quite high especially considering you can get authentic Mexican street tacos anywhere in Columbus for $1.75-$2.00 per taco. The tacos here are about double that price. I understand it is a fusion restaurant and the tacos are really delicious. I love the pork belly and bulgogi tacos, but I don't think I can justify paying those prices when there are plenty of other substitutes around. I feel like I could go to Moe's, Qdoba, or Chiptole if I'm craving Mexican and I'm near campus.

We (party of 2, my bf and I) came to Bahama Breeze to enjoy that breezy atmosphere almost ended up at the corner of little additional dining room kinda table. We found the room at the bar so we ended up sitting at the bar which We were very happy with. It's a new place and everyone there seems not know what they were really doing.  Understandable....  Personal opinion.... Drinks were kinda weak... Cheddars next door serves better drinks I thought...  Another personal opinion they need to have at least a few senior bartenders.... I ordered Cosmo and came out on the rocks....  also I only tasted cranberry juice and simple syrup, maybe like half shot of vodka.  I didn't taste any vodka, definitely no Cointreau or no lime juice at all.  I know what Cosmo taste like. I always order Cosmo every place I go and also I make my own!  I didn't say anything... But that was a huge disappointment.  It's a classic cocktail that any bartenders must know how to make it!!!!!  Food was good.  Guacamole appetizer was very tiny.  Ahi tuna app was good but the picture in the menu looked much bigger in portion.  For $13 tuna could be thicker?!  My skirt steak entree (medium rare) was really good! Steak was prepared exactly how I expected!  I told my bartender I wanted to substitute all the sides on this entree to broccoli and green beans but broccoli and green beans came as extra sides...

When I called the store to inquire about my order, I was placed on hold without my permission and then the attempt to have them help me was dysfunctional at best. I overheard someone, probably the manager, in the background yelling to the man miserably suffering thru trying to help me on the phone to just tell the customer the deliver guy is out and will probably be there soon.

The trace of habanero scorched my throat on the way down, which made the rest of the meal slightly painful, so I might water it down a little if (when) I come back. The goat curry also lived up to the hype by being remarkably tender and not overly goaty.

My wife (who spent 12 years in the restaurant industry, including a James Beard award nominated one) and I ate there for the first time last night, and we both agreed it was all around one of the Top 5 meals we'd ever eaten. From start to finish everything was right on point.\\n\\nWe started with the Duck Ham, as others here have written much about. Almost like a duck bacon, served with pickles. Great flavor and very unique offering. After that we moved on to the Green Bean Salad with apricots and almond butter. I could have eaten this all day as my meal. Every ingredient was so fresh and balanced well with the others. All the vegetable plates sounded amazing and I can't wait to try more. \\n\\nFor our entrees we enjoyed the Halibut with Fava Beans, and Pork Confit with Rainier Cherry Mostarda and Hazelnuts. The pork was a very generous portion, and perfectly prepared. Crispy on the edge and fall-apart tender inside. Seriously one of the best dishes I've had in town. The halibut was also cooked perfectly - crisped on one side while flaky and juicy through the rest. The accompaniments on that dish were a little too 'green' tasting for my liking, but my wife loved it. \\n\\nWe added some beets with house kimchi and ended on the panna cotta with fresh peaches and dehydrated strawberry dust. The service throughout (on a Tuesday night) was perfect, and way above what you normally see in Portland. Our server glided through the meal, never leaving us to have to ask for anything while making friendly and spot-on recommendations. My only wishes are that they would offer 1 or 2 more meat/entree dishes. Keeping a chicken entree and perhaps some kind of vegetarian (pasta?) dish on the menu would give a few more choices. Also, I would love a gluten-free chocolate as an addition to the desserts, perhaps a chocolate budino.\\n\\nThe drinks at/from the bar were also very creative and made with attention, and the happy hour offers a great tasting menu.

From the moment we walked in to departing, it was just a meal experience I wish I didn't have. \\n\\nWhen we walked in, it was a little odd to see the layout of the restaurant. I don't recall what was in place before Dos Madres, but I'm pretty sure it was a pizza place (attn: brick oven in the kitchen?) We walked up the host stand, where no one stood. After we looked around for a minute or so, a server walked up and asked if we were dining in. Yes? She was rather nice and showed us to a table. Not sure that having a host stand or area is really all that necessary. \\n\\nNow, I always appreciate chips and salsa as they hit the table at any Mexican restaurant, but these were pretty awful. The inconsistency was pretty astounding -- tons of chips stuck together, half were only partially cooked, others were heavy over-fried, and the flavor was pretty awful.

Though none of us obliged, I'm sure it would be a great idea upon another visit. \\n\\nFor my entree, I decided to go with shrimp tacos. Since this is an item I typically wouldn't order elsewhere, I wasn't sure what my expectation should be. I wanted two tacos and both with flour tortillas. The plate came with rice and beans -- both of which were pretty good. As soon as I bit into the first taco, I knew something was off. It was like biting into all of the right texture, with zero punch of flavor from the corn salsa or what you would expect to be flavorful, grilled shrimp. The only thing I tasted was the queso blanco and it was pretty horrible. It had some seriously pungent flavor and it masked any other hopes of other flavors playing with one another. I didn't end up eating any more of them, unfortunately. \\n\\nMy wife's tacos, however, were great! Veggie tacos with a really great crema on top. \\n\\nTo make matters a bit worse, our server wasn't exactly present throughout our meal. She stopped by after our food was ready only to bring the check. Empty glasses aren't a huge deal, but not exactly fun. \\n\\nI really wanted to like this place.

After moving away from Portland, part of me wanted to \\"unfollow\\" them on facebook, as an act of self-preservation once images of a summer peach flavor arrived on my iPhone. However, even at a distance you have to applaud creative flavor combinations--and who am I to act as though I don't \\"Like\\" Salt & Straw. When I returned to Portland in November, Salt & Straw offered a Salted Caramel and Thanksgiving Turkey ice cream, as well as flavors including corn, cranberries and ingredients arguably more adaptable to ice cream.  The Thanksgiving Turkey ice cream was incredible. It was salty and sweet, had crunchy bits of real turkey in it. Who knew?! Salt & Straw--that's who. The split cone of the turkey and the honey lavender paired very well together, which the richer caramel nicely offset by the lighter, clean taste of the lavender--both brought together by the honey notes. Frankly, I don't know why you're still reading this (unless you're already in line at a Salt & Straw and are reminiscing their seasonal flavors--otherwise, go to Salt & Straw and enjoy the beauty for the rest of us."},{"name":"Ty Ginger Asian Bistro","address":"5689 Woerner Temple Rd","city":"Dublin","stars":"4","text":"This place is great for lunch or dinner.

The wine was quite good.  The presentation of the food was beautiful--some of the best I've seen.  The dessert was also fantastic.\\n\\nWhat was missing was flavor, though.  Three courses in, I was questioning whether I had burnt my tongue or I had a cold I didn't know about, except here or there we'd run into something on the menu made by someone else (ie, Tails and Trotters rillettes, etc.) that would be great.  Everything made in house (except dessert) was bland to the point that I felt sorry for it.  \\n\\nOn top of that, several ingredients were missing which is unforgivable at this price point, especially since they only have to plate 20 or so a sitting, but still find a way to make that take a half hour.  \\n\\nFinally, the general concept of the seating is flawed, in my opinion.  I don't mind waiting 20-30 minutes per course if I'm having a romantic dinner, but I don't want to sit and make uncomfortable small talk with middle aged tourists and have to turn 90 degrees to even see my wife.

Your food is made to order. For example, my daughter's ravioli pasta was not rolled and cut until the order was put in. HUGE portions. Great service. \\n\\nI had the Bolongese for $17 and was given a portion that truly could feed four people. I was given a choice of six or seven pastas and I opted for the spaghetti. The meat was a mixture of ground veal, pork, and beef. While the Bolognese sauce was delightful, the pasta was divine. I never before have had a pasta dish that I have enjoyed as much as a filet mignon. Seriously, it was that good. \\n\\nMy daughter's cheese ravioli was out of this world. The ravioli is as big as a turnover or a empanada if you are familar with what that is. Huge. There are three on a plate. The cheese filling was amazing. You take a bite of this ravioli and the flavor matures in your mouth. With every bite, it just gets even better and then you are hooked. You have to have another bite.\\n\\nOur server was Zane and he was really an interesting guy and very friendly. The hostess was Jeanie, I think, and she was very friendly and happy. Service was excellent. \\n\\nWe went at 4:30 because my daughter and son-in-law knew that it is very difficult to get in during the prime dining hours. And it was \\"slow\\" for them. There were actually two or three tables in their small restaurant that was actually empty. Didn't stay that long and it was filled by 5:30.\\n\\nTips: Only groups of six or larger can make a reservation. On some nights, your wait can be up to two hours. Some reviews mentioned going across the street to their bar and enjoying drinks while they wait. At the time of this writing, the bar looks closed, maybe for renovations. THEY DO TAKE OUT!!! So if you are in the area, bag the wait, order over the phone, pick it up, and eat at home.\\n\\nIf you do not care about any of the above, just know that the two hour wait is SO worth it.

We ordered 1 pancake for our toddler but got 3 (she barely finished one). The food was tasty and came out quickly. Large portions also. The service was quick and the waitress was very personable and friendly. A few more people came in while we were there but it wasn't very busy. There is lots of seating space, including bar seating. Would certainly go back and try different things. Maybe a good place to grab lunch as well."},{"name":"Jester King Brewery","address":"13187 Fitzhugh Rd","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"This brewery is really a neat addition that we tried out on a recent trip to Austin. There are really 3-4 different things happening here. First of all is the beer/brewery where you can visit multiple bars to get drinks. There is a line, but it moves pretty quickly. Second is the tour of the brewery which is open to the public and free. On the day we went, it was really full of people and the tour guide seemed like this is not his usual job. He was honestly less than enthused, but did share some drinks during the tour. We were not really impressed and left before the tour headed upstairs for it's third and final part. The third part of Jester King is apparently a new addition as the brewery took over a restaurant that is on the grounds. This restaurant features very fancy nouveau types of American/Italian cuisine. We had 3 items and I wouldn't recommend any of them. I found them bland and boring. Honestly, we were less than thrilled that we drove out to the Jester King Brewery by the end of the visit. But there were tons of people around the beautiful grounds and outside seating who seemed to be really enjoying themselves.

Space is extremely limited, with only 4 booths and a small number of bar stools at the counter (which might be a drive behind this move). To get a spot, you have to show up in advance of the opening time and add your name and number of diners to the pen-and-paper waitlist hanging on the front door. This is a first come, first served operation so no reservations, call-aheads, nada.\\n\\nMenus change frequently, but there is a standing Omakase option for $40pp, and this is what I opted to do on my visit. I assume Omakase options change depending on the menu but on my visit, each diner gets the first three items (soup, salad, and vegetable option), then one of the two meat courses (pork / chicken), one of the two \\"other mains\\" (gnudi / porridge), and then a smaller sample of the desserts. You can add other courses as desired.\\n\\nThe pop-up does not have a liquor license so this is BYOB. We bought a bottle of wine at the Inman Park Market and carried it into the restaurant, which provided wine glasses and a bottle opener without a corkage fee - always appreciated! \\n\\nOverall, the food was great.

Getting there is a bit of a pain by mass transit, though there is a nearby orange line stop. I walked there once from Cambridge, which was slightly terrifying. On the bright side, there's parking for days if you drive. The biggest benefit: it means this place is big and you won't wait two hours for brunch. In fact, we didn't wait at all! Plus there's a great mix of indoor and outdoor seating. \\n\\nTHE DIGS: I love the design. It was clearly inspired by real Southern restaurants, but doesn't try to fake authenticity. I love the giant industrial fans, mis-matched china, and annotated drink menu. \\n\\nTHE DRINKS: Cocktails I've had weren't my favorite. Bloody Mary was a little too sweet and syrupy, and neither the pecan bourbon drink or the raspberry mint drink were to my taste. But who needs cocktails with a bourbon and whisky list this big?! They offer a huge variety, including flights. \\n\\nTHE FOOOOOOD: Oh god yes. This is my favorite Southern food in the Boston area. The menu is varied and nearly everything I've had was phenomenal. The only thing I'd pass on were the pimento cheese fritters, even though I love pimento cheese. Otherwise, it's all amazing. I love the chicken and waffles and mac and cheese (served in a stupid cute little cast iron). The tomato pudding blew my mind. It was like delicious tomato chutney bread pudding, and totally different from anything I've ever had. My absolute favorite is the gussied up chicken and biscuits. For $9, you get a great buttermilk biscuit, topped with a big piece of glorious, juicy, crispy fried chicken, and smothered in sausage gravy. I deeply regret writing this review because now I'm craving it again. You've gotta try that gussied up biscuit. It's not a new invention, but it's a really well executed classic. \\n\\nIn short: I'm obsessed. It's good for a group. Waits are short. Food is amazing.

We went for lunch on 4/27/12 - arrived at 12:15 - 4 of 12 tables empty yet we're told there's 3 parties in front of us on the wait. Shockingly, we're shown the place across the street -Prima e Dopo - and told we can get a drink. Not everyone starts having cocktails at noon. And I agree with the others about the who cares attitude found at the door.  I guess Prima e Dopo translates to \\" first dope who comes in\\".  We also wait 1.25 hrs and watch as the locals slide in & get immediate seating. They take your cell # for the wait list but never use it.. We stay in our car and watch party after party get seated- way beyond the 3 we're told. It doesn't take long to figure our the game here. When the hostess sees us watching her herd parties across the street from the bar to the restaurant for the 5th/6th time, she motions us to come in.\\n\\nWaiter (Marco ?- goatee,shaved head) treated us like dirt. Waited 15 minutes + before he even came to table.He clears table & put down paper napkin & a fork- nothing else. Finally returns and takes order & never comes back to the table. Busboy gets us water & salad - one on a plate, one in a salad bowl. Tells us they ran out of bread - more will be coming out of oven soon. When bread finally arrives, it's ice cold ! - Must be a new kind of refrigerator oven. Never got knives until we asked after the salad is served. Salad itself was a lifeless lettuce setup you'd find anywhere.\\n\\nMeanwhile, Marco stays up by the kitchen and hugs his pals when they come in.\\nAfter 45 minutes of no food with newer arrived parties already being served their main course, ( a single diner came in after us, ordered, served and finished his meal while we still waited),we asked about our order. Hostess looked at us like we were trying to rob the place.Still, no Marco to our table. Another waitress came over and gives us the what's your problem attitude. Our simple problem - no food after 2 hours of the Rino's experience. At that point, we threw in the towel and left.\\n\\nWe saw the table next to us- they both ordered the halibut special - we looked at their fish- obviously overcooked and dry as a bone. Place is busy with carry out orders. They are getting many tourists who want to know where Guy Fiere sat and take photos outside of someplace you'd never give a second look to if it hadn't been on TV.\\n\\nThey're running a real scam by deliberately keeping tables open for the friends/locals while pushing the wait times back for the tourists/clueless so you'll go to the only place available to wait within blocks of the restaurant to wait to be called.\\nAnd that's at lunch, imagine how they can fleece the dinner crowd.  \\n\\nThey should change the name of the place from Rino's to RICO - as in corrupt operation like the feds say !"},{"name":"The Smoke Shop BBQ - Seaport","address":"343 Congress St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"The food was good although it took longer than expected.

The drink itself was a little off-putting. The matcha powder is mixed with vanilla powder so the drink was overly sweet with a bitter aftertaste.

I am not sure if I buy this because we sat down at about the time the Taste was scheduled to conclude. Also, if the kitchen was so busy preparing food for Taste that it could not get out regular orders I think it reflects some poor planning and management on the part of the staff. Our case seemed to be the rule rather than the exception as we saw several servers come out with trays of chips and few bringing actual meals out to tables. \\n\\nAfter an hour and half of sitting on the patio without food we found our waitress and told her that if our food had not yet been started that we would just take our bill for the drinks and chips and leave. Unfortunately, she returned with only our bill and we went home to fend for ourselves.  Granted we went on the busiest night the place has probably ever seen but I can only cut them so much slack.  I mean, how long does it take to make a taco.  Nonetheless I remain optimistic and hope to give Holy Taco another chance to win me over soon... on a night when they have a better chance of actually getting the food out the door."},{"name":"Caf√© Annie","address":"131 N Orange Ave","city":"Orlando","stars":"3.5","text":"This is the most disgusting  place.

Home made ravioli, filled with a variety of fillings, is the house specialty.  They are famous for their Tortelli di Mele, ravioli filled with browned Granny Smith apples, sausage and parmigiano and topped with a brown butter, sage and apple cider drizzle.  A menu of house favorites is complemented with an equal number of rotating daily specials.  I had one such special, ravioli stuffed with bits of roasted chicken, black beans and corn and topped with a spicy tomato sauce.  It was unique and tasty and the ravioli were large and plump.  My dining companion had the chicken cannelloni which consisted of 3 Italian crepes stuffed with chicken, spinach and ricotta.  One half of each crepe was covered with a tomato basil sauce, the other end by a creamy gorgonzola mushroom sauce that was heavenly.  It was excellent comfort food.    The caesar salad was very average with an uninspired dressing, although it had nice large pieces of shaved parmegiano on it.  And the bread was downright blase with hardly any taste.  Neither one match the quality of the pastas being served.  \\n\\nServers are knowledgeable about the menu and offer excellent guidance when trying to decide between entrees.  All servers wear a black fedora as part of their uniform, which I found a little cheesy and not in keeping with the feel and atmosphere of the restaurant.\\n\\nThe main room was completely occupied by a corporate group of 30+ on the night we dined and it made for a noisy room, although the atmosphere usually tends to be quieter and more romantic.  More intimate seating is located just past the bar or outside on the porch.  The large group seemed to throw service a little out of sync.  \\n\\nEntrees are reasonably priced at $15-18, with appetizers running from $4-8.  Two entrees, two caesar salads, 4 glasses of wine and tip came to $88 for two people.  Add another $3-5 for parking across the street."},{"name":"Rize Artisan Pizza + Salads","address":"675 N Highland Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"We've been wanting to try Rize pizza for some time and glad we did!

I always love when restaurants have a small menu because it usually means that they make sure everything on the menu is near-perfect. I started out with the Oddly Enough drink which was very interesting and pretty tasty. They told me they are removing it from the menu since the tomatoes used aren't in season, though. Next, they brought us out the cheese & charcuterie board which was amazing. I loved dipping the meat in the horseradish mustard. Next, they brought out the deviled eggs. These were pretty good but nothing that special about them. I preferred the crusted soft-boiled eggs on the cheese board -- super unique and delicious.  Next, they brought out the poke taco. I really liked the marinade on the salmon. The peak of the meal was probably the scallops - these might've been the best scallops I've ever had!! They were really fat and juicy with a little crust on top - I could tell they lightly torched them. My mouth is watering from thinking about them now. Finally, they brought out the oyster mushrooms. I was pretty full by this point so I gave most of them to my boyfriend but man were they delicious. They almost tasted like a steak! Since it was my birthday, they let me choose a dessert. We agreed on the brown butter blueberry tart. It was pretty good but I wasn't a huge fan of the citrus accents - I would have preferred more of the brown sugar taste to come through.

We were seated in a lovely booth with a view of the beautiful kitchen. For the amount of patrons in the restaurant, the kitchen did not seem at all overwhelmed. They all worked together seamlessly. Aside from the amazing food the we had, our waiter was the best part of the whole experience. Jason was absolutely outstanding. He was so incredibly kind and attentive. After we stuffed our faces with shrimp cocktail, baked stuffed clams, buffalo chicken dip, lobster bisque, and all the salads on the menu, Jason read off the extensive dessert menu. We were stuffed and politely declined. He said, \\"If you had to choose, what would you have gotten?\\" We said the flourless torte, of course... chocolate!

The toppings are all pretty unique and fresh, allowing for endless combinations. I added avocado for $1 and they gave me half of the avocado. Tell me anywhere else in town that does that.

I think their service faltered a little due to rush of customers they had, but it was understandable.  For our first courses we chose the butternut bisque with creme fraiche (which was a little on the sweet side) and the butternut white bean hummus.  The portion of hummus was enough for 4 people and it was served with a very hard, crispy cracker/flatbread.  I think that the nice, soft bread they served when we sat down would've complemented the hummus much better.  It was tasty hummus, with a sweetness to it as well.  While our first courses were brought quickly, we had a much longer wait for our main courses.  This afforded us time to order another drink.  On Sundays, they have happy hour all evening, which gives you a couple of dollars off martinis.  I think that also decreases your amount of liquor as well.  The glass was only about 3/4 full.  They carry Redstone Meadery's black cherry mead, so I jumped at a glass of that.  It was tasty as usual with its hint of sweetness & tartness at the same time.  In addition to the cocktails, they have a good beer selection that varies from many of the standards you'd find.  We were happy to see they carried Boulevard out of KC.\\nThe lamb shank main course was fall-off-the-bone tender and not a hint of dryness (which we seem to encounter at other restaurants) and it was served with perfectly cooked cauliflower and chard, and a few pieces of gnocchi.  The house made papparadelle was also delicious with a broccoli pesto, which I have not had before.  I enjoyed the variation to standard pesto flavors.  The pasta was tender & rich with a creamy cheese & sauce coating the noodles & mushrooms.\\nFor dessert we had the chocolate torte which was incredibly rich ... very good & silky smooth, but rich.  The stuffed pears were filled with ricotta & lemon curd which was good, but unfortunately the pears felt a little hard.  The cherry sauce provided a nice tartness to the dish.\\n\\nI have a Groupon to use, so I'll definitely be back to give 4580 more business.

The dimly lit room has funky light fixtures, which catches the eye and makes the place feel less serious. When our party first walked in, the hostess greeted us warmly and walked us toward a high top table. Usually, I don't like eating a meal while sitting on a stool, but I didn't want to be \\"that person\\" so I obliged and thanked her. I actually, didn't mind the height so much because the atmosphere was very fun. I did notice the variations of chairs at the table, and quickly picked the one I thought would have the most back support and comfort. Even though a high top table gives off a not-so-fancy feel, the decor is very trendy and dimly lit. \\n\\nThe waiter handed us the menu that featured specials and I quickly noticed the craft cocktails seemed uber fancy. I ended up ordering the Nutty Professor, because I was so intrigued by the description: macadamia nut liquor, with Bombay gin, and lemon. Perplexing, right? Curiosity was answered with taste buds bouncing around the spectrum, zesty to nutty to sweet. I wish the drink wasn't on the menu before my meal, because it really should've been ordered post meal, since it was dessert level sweet. It was odd sipping on that, while eating bacon wrapped dates. Speaking of, the dates were nothing special, the bacon was cooked just right, it tasted great, but didn't blow my mind with awesomeness. We did wait a while for the entrees. However, I was with great company (my fianc√©, aunt, uncle, and cousin), and our jovial conversation made the time pass quickly. \\n\\nWhen our dish arrived, I was immediately jealous of my fianc√©'s order. The pad Thai smelled delicious and looked great! The kohlrabi noodles was a trendy substitution for common rice noodles. If you aren't familiar with kohlrabi noodles, they're a vegetable noodle made from cabbage. Yes, this means that your pad Thai will be semi firm to the bite, with more of an al-dente texture, instead of the usual smoothness that comes from regular noodles. My fianc√© loathes mushrooms, so I was really surprised when he agreed to split this entree with me, and even more surprised when he ended up loving it! I really enjoyed the peanut sauce and noodles. Those two ingredients were the stars of the show. The Oscar winner for tonight, went to my dish, the Korean BBQ flank steak. The kimchi jumeok bap cake was delicious! Jumeok bap, in Korean, means rice fist. (Thank you to our waiter for explaining that to us!) It looks like a crab cake and is fried on the outside. The inside is rice and kimchi (fermented vegetables). It was insanely amazing! Fried to perfection, soft on the inside, and the crunch from the veggies was the perfect touch! The cakes are served underneath the steak. The galbi sauce, flowing from the steak to the jumeok bap cake, really made them stand out. It is a bit awkward to try and cut the steak and the jumeok bap at the same time, so I decided to separate the two. From this entree, the steak was the least to stand out. There was nothing outstanding about it; very yummy, but the sauce and fried rice cakes stole all the attention. Since my fianc√© and I aren't fans of sweets, our table decided to get our sugar via wine. All in all, Swift's properly accomplishes \\"farm to table\\" Korean flavors in new and excited ways."},{"name":"Claypot Hot Pot & BBQ","address":"8291 Alexandra Road, Unit 105","city":"Richmond","stars":"3","text":"All you can eat which is nice.

Plenty to share even when a third friend joined us. I've been on a mushroom kick lately and took the recommendation from the chef of the mushroom ravioli. Omg...SO GOOD! I ate every bite even though there was really enough to save for a second take home meal! Both friends ordered the prime rib special and were equally pleased with their meals (although smartly not over indulging and taking half of their meals home!).

I liked the flavor combo of the blueberry crumble, but wished they used real berries. I guess wife liked this place because she finished her super matcha AND helped me finish mine as I had to tap out . The ginger tea was in-your-face, which I liked, and paired well with the sweet waffles. This is a clean space with efficient service. It's a bit pricey, but the desserts were a generous size.

And the quesidilla ain't Jenny Craig friendly, but it is a ooey gooey cheesy delight! And the price at Taqueria Jalisco?

It also has an open kitchen design which doesn't help the noise or hi-temp situations. And why is my beer being served in a mason jar? Pint glass, please, or just give me a friggin' can. I like the idea of ordering up-front to free up wait-staff and keep prices low but, half of a tiny chicken is still $12. But the chicken was delicious. They must marinate it in something before it is fried, and the crunchy fried onions they top it with are good, too. The pickle is tasty but, if you are sensitive to spicy foods then stay away from the red chili; it will blow your lips right off your face like a capsicum hand-grenade. We also got the beef cheek curry and roti dish. The meat itself was very tender; you can mash it apart with a fork, almost like a piece of brisket. The roti was fresh, crispy, steamy, and tasty. The curry, however, was garbage; if there were any spices in there other than cinnamon, we couldn't tell, because cinnamon is all you taste. In fact, my girlfriend could only describe the taste of the curry as a thick \\"liquid Red Hots\\". There may be other items on the menu that were better than the curry but, we'll never know. From now on, we'll be ordering fried chicken to-go, at $23 for a small bird - sigh"},{"name":"Downlow Chicken Shack","address":"905 Commercial Drive","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4","text":"I came around 4pm.

I as able to try their tamales also and that I would recommend. Their red sauce is nice, almost like the red sauce in chef boyardee, acidic and sweet with a beefy flavor. They have nice fluffy rice and good beans. The space is nice, lots of roomy booths. They have quite a large patio area also. The service is normally fair to very good, no major problems there.

Mother of all healthy hipster lunch/brunch restaurants (or should I say child?). Anyways, I should first clarify that I wasn't driven to write a review for this place on my first visit, but rather I've been coming here pretty frequently during my lunch breaks when it's not too busy. \\nI usually only order the plates they have that you can build yourself (I'm far too picky for one of their signature bowls, but we'll see), which are almost too simple, but still filling. It really depends on what you get inside your plate, as I've had days where I've been dissapointed with my plate and others where I've been completely astonished. All I know is that the brussel sprouts and the tofu here have killed it every time. I would warn you, though, to watch out for the price, especially when building a plate because the sides and protein can add up fast.\\n\\nAs for the service and ambiance, I've tried both to-go and eat-in, so here's what I've got:\\nTo-go orders take maybe 5-10 minutes to prepare which is crucial for me because as I said, I rely on this place to feed me in under thirty minutes whenever I'm out on lunch - and it's always done just that, though there have been days where I've skipped going here altogether because the line is pretty much out the door and I hadn't had time to call in a to-go, but that's weekend rushes at the Domain for ya.\\nEating in is a rare luxury for me, but it's so worth it. This place is so light and open it's nice to just sit and read or people-watch. The people handing you your food once it's ready like to go a little above and grab you silverware and napkins too. One thing I wish I'd known is that they sort of expect you to leave your dishes at your table once you're done. I guess I thought the walk-up ordering system came with self-clean up but I was wrong.

The drinks were great, the beers on tap are extensive and anyone could manage to find something to spark their fancy, and the food came out really quickly. There was a rather obnoxious man sitting at the bar by himself drinking beer and attempting to FaceTime multiple people, another couple came in, and I believe they were regulars because they quickly became agitated with the loud patron and ask Joey for the manager, but Joey was great and instead of involving the manager her politely and quickly went up to the obnoxious male and asked him to lower his voice when on the phone.

I ordered a house margarita and the Chicken Taquitos plate, with no sour cream, no beans, double rice. The whole table got their food except me and another person and we had to wait quite a while after everyone had gotten their food before we did. Someone at our table was waiting on jalapenos with their meal and never got it after asking for it three times. I had a big whopping dollop of sour cream on my plate but that wasn't a big deal, one of my table mates just scooped it off my plate. The Chicken Taquitos was very very dry and the cheese on top was chewy. It is almost as if the cheese was melted and then my plate sat under a food warmer for a while. Even drenching the taquitos themselves in the yummy salsa that I loved couldn't save it. At this point I wished I ordered something else but since I got my food so late, I just stuck with it.

Unfortunately, we had found a rubber band in one of the salads and showed it to the server. Immediately after, the server brought it to the kitchen staff and raised it to their attention. Not long after, the manager came to speak with us and comped the meal with the rubber band in it, as well as offered to bring a new meal out. Things like that happen, we are all human after all and it's how they handled it so well afterwards that show they care.

The location was nice, we got there a little too early and headed over to Neighboring hot spots while we waited for our reservation time! We were greeted immediately and offered to hang our belongings on the coats rack and then seated.  The staff was quick and very friendly!! They catered to our every need without any hesitation.  The experience and price, to me, was worth it!\\n\\nWhat I loved was that our party was a party of three. They sat us appropriately, so we could enjoy conversing with each other: two facing and one on the end! Even better was their attention to detail and the fact that they were very good allergy friendly place.  They confirmed my friends allergies and ensured with each meal they served we were given detailed description and reminder that their meals did not include food allergies they provided Beast.  The meal started off with a nice bubbly drink, one of us a non drinker, so they poured her a non alcoholic beverage. They also served a tasty starter, steak tartar on a crisp potato chip.\\n\\nIt was six courses and man it just got better each time.  The first course was the Kona Kampachi Crudo. Oh so light, tangy and savory.  One of my favorite dishes of the night.  The second course was a potato gnocchi! They were pilllowy and soft, melting in your mouth.  The saut√©ed mustard greens added a bitter bite, I absolutely loved and the breadcrumbs added some texture.  This was my favorite dish of the evening! The third course, a rack of lamb was cooked to perfection.  The pur√©e and herb salad was delisicious.  The fourth course was an escarole salad.  The vinaigrette was amazing and the crisp escarole held well against it.  The fifth course was the cascades creamery glacier blue cheese on a sweet raisin walnut bread and lime compressed apples.  What a combination! The cheese was so creamy and not too pungent.  Last was the Sorghum castellated cake with sorbet and quinoa crumble.  Who knew quinoa was a definitely match  in texture and taste with sorbet and cake.  A very light and not overwhelmingly sweet dessert!  The icing on the cake that finished the night off great were the foie gras bon bons.  They offered coffee at the end of the night as well.\\n\\nMy night was made when we were able to hit chat with the staff and take a picture behind the counter of the open kitchen.  What a great experience, definitely want to try the brunch service since we enjoyed dinner so much!

The menu really reflects a lot of classic Charleston inspired dishes, which is very uncommon to find in the Boston area. \\n\\nI have to point out the AMAZING decor, ambiance, and service.  I loved all the details that they put into the restaurant to make it feel like you arent in Boston.  All the service staff and manager was friendly and attentive. It was their \\"soft\\" opening and you can tell because of the extra attention that was paid.  Of course, there were a couple of small snafus during the whole process but I am sure those details will be ironed out eventually.  Portions were decent and prices are what you would expect for a trendy restaurant.  Coming from the south, I expect southern food to be cheap!\\n\\nLets get to the food.  Its good!  In my opinion, the stand outs were:\\n- Hogs and hooch bisquit exceeded expectations.  We really debated on the appetizers (they call it small plates) because nothing really stood out to us.  We decided on this one because I love fried green tomatoes (very Charlestonian).  It was a mini sandwich with a fried green tomato on top with pepper jelly, pork belly in the middle, and a biscuit on the bottom.  It all worked really well together and was a great starter for our meal.  I would have never guessed what it was based on the description.  \\n- Waffles and spicy maple syrup from the chicken and waffles.  It was crispy on the outside, had chives inside, and just overall really tasty. My only complaint was that the jar that they served the syrup in had a small mouth, I am a dunker so I had to cut mine in small pieces to fit it.  \\n- Mac and cheese and cornbread from the rib dish.  My god, that mac and cheese was to die for, not too creamy, not sticky, and with crispy breadcrumbs on the top.  It didnt feel like I just ate a stick of milky butter.  The cornbread was probably the best I have ever had in the NE.  It was slightly sweet, not too crumbly, moist, and crispy on the outside.  I couldve eaten blocks of it.  \\n\\nAs for the stuff that was good but could have been better:\\n- The fried chicken was juicy on the inside but the fried area was not my preferred taste.  Typically we are used to flour but I think this was cornbread?  It was crispy but kept falling apart and it wasnt salty enough.  Cornbread always has that hint of sweetness and thats what it was. \\n- The ribs were flavorful and juicy.  It was somewhat falling off the bone and slightly on the tough/dry side.  I liked the BBQ sauce, it was sweet and tangy.  I imagined much bigger ribs like Blue Ribbon's ribs.  It was not as good as that.  \\n- Mud pie was everything I could want in a chocolate pie.  It was decadent, sweet, shareable, and satisfying.  My only complaint was the crust!  It was really tough and dry.  I am not sure that was the right crust to use on this particular filling.  I think this crust was meant more for apple pies.  \\n\\nOverall the meal was great and we will definitely come here again to try out other dishes.  The pork chop and catfish will be our next dishes!"},{"name":"Swift's Attic","address":"315 Congress Ave, Ste 200","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Having an amazing past dinner experience here, I have been excited to try their brunch.

On its Facebook page, Little Trouble is described as \\"if Blade Runner was a bar.\\" For those unfamiliar, Blade Runner is a 1982 Ridley Scott sci-fi movie starring Harrison Ford. It takes place in a futuristic dystopian urban setting and is filmed in a neo-noir style. Here's the trailer if you're curious: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPcZHjKJBnE.\\n\\nI guess Little Trouble might be more accurately described as \\"a restaurant/bar inspired by 2019 Los Angeles as depicted in Blade Runner.\\" It's really neat. Here are similarities I noticed between the movie and the business:\\n\\n1. In the movie, the parts of LA shown look much like Chinatown with bright lights/signs and Chinese text everywhere. Little Trouble is an Asian fusion restaurant with Japanese characters printed on the restroom sign and on its cocktail napkins.\\n\\n2. In the movie, there's a scene where Harrison Ford sits down at a bar to eat a bowl of noodles. He even snaps apart a pair of those disposable wooden chopsticks before beginning to chow down. Little Trouble has a bar, you can order noodles, and they even have the same wooden snap-apart chopsticks.\\n\\n3. Several shots in Blade Runner show businesses sporting lots of rows of neon lights. That's the most striking thing about Little Trouble -- all the rows of red and blue neon lights. They really give the space a trendy and unique ambiance, a vibe you'd expect to find only in the most cosmopolitan of cities (but nope, this is Atlanta). The large illuminated logo hits you immediately as you walk down the entry hallway. It's almost as if you're walking down a dark alleyway in the movie.\\n\\n4. Most of the scenes in the movie take place at night. Little Trouble is only open in the evenings, from 5pm until \\"late\\" (~2:30am on weekends), Monday-Saturday. This place wouldn't look the same during the daytime. Nightfall is what really makes it shine. The dim neon-lit environment casts lots of silhouettes and shadows, reminiscent of the modern film noir style shots in the movie. Just check out Little Trouble's geotagged Instagram photos. People love posting pictures of their silhouettes posed against lighted backdrops.\\n\\nWhen I first heard the name \\"Little Trouble,\\" I immediately thought of the 1986 John Carpenter action-adventure movie Big Trouble in Little China (starring Kurt Russell and Kim Cattrall). It was released during the same era as Blade Runner and takes place in San Francisco Chinatown. It wouldn't surprise me if this movie influenced the name.\\n\\nLittle Trouble opened August 6, 2015 inside Westside Provisions District. It's located beneath Marcel. The bar was created by the same folks behind Victory Sandwich Bar and Paper Plane (Paper Plane closed August 29, 2015).\\n\\nThe bar serves cocktails, sake, wine, and beer. I don't really drink, but I have tried one cocktail: the Improved Whiskey Cocktail ($10) made with rye, maraschino, absinthe, and angostura bitters. It's their version of an Old Fashioned and it's pretty good.\\n\\nThe food menu is short and sweet featuring items like pork rinds, wings, skewers (\\"Meat on a Stick\\"), fried noodles, and tempura. These are more small plate, shareable portions (izakaya style) as opposed to full-sized entrees. Here's what I've tried:\\n\\n* Blistered Shishitos - sea salt ($6)\\n* Ceviche - hamachi, cilantro, mango, ponzu ($9)\\n* Thai Beef dumplings - chili, cilantro, fish sauce (5 pieces, $8)\\n* Char Siu Pork Bun - pickled vegetables, cilantro, sesame mayo ($5)\\n* Braised Beef Bun - red cabbage slaw, red chili mustard ($5)\\n* Snapper Ramen - coconut snapper broth, tomato, carrots, Fresno chili, beech mushroom, egg ($14)\\n\\nIn general, I think the food is pretty tasty. I can't say I've had a bad thing.\\n\\nThe Blistered Shishito peppers are delicious, served charred and glistening. A terrific bar snack. The Ceviche is fresh and flavorful. In addition to the menu ingredients listed above, the seafood dish comes with corn, purple onion, cilantro, and sprouts with a side of thick, crispy, fried wonton chips. The Thai Beef Dumplings are similar to potstickers. The vinegary fish sauce really makes them taste great.\\n\\nBoth the Asian bao (buns) are A-OK. I think I like the Braised Beef Bun better than the Char Siu Pork Bun. The Char Siu Pork Bun seems to have a higher veggie-to-meat ratio. The Braised Beef Bun tastes richer and fattier.\\n\\nLittle Trouble serves two kinds of ramen: Tonkotsu (with lamb belly) and Snapper. This is the first Snapper Ramen (or any kind of fish ramen) I've tried. It's good. The broth is noticeably fishy, but not in a bad way. All of the ingredients are fresh and the presentation is nice and colorful. I really like the small beech mushrooms, with their firm texture and nutlike flavor, and the other veggies as well. Portion size is small.\\n\\nAttentive service. Hannah is fantastic.\\n\\nValet or park for free in the adjacent WSPD parking deck."},{"name":"Tang's Wok","address":"16209 SE Mcgillivray Blvd, Ste S","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4.5","text":"Me and my husband always eat here.

It's been a long time since I ate BBQ and my boyfriend and I wanted to try something new so we came here. We've always been hesitant to come here because it looked pricy. To our surprise the prices are a little more than your average BBQ but the quality and quantity make it well worth every penny if not a bargain.\\n\\nThe retaurant has a great feng shui. It's similar to the food style with a nice balance of home-like and modern. You order at a counter and then pick your table. As first timers we weren't sure what to order. The cashier was very friendly and helpful. After much struggle we decided on sharing. I got the 1.5 rack of oak wood smoked ribs for $15.99 which comes with two sides. I chose the Grilled Mexican street corn w/ chili-lime butter and cotija cheese and fries. My boyfriend got the 2 meat combo (pulled pork and Brisket) $14.99. For his two sides he got steamed veggies and plantains. Everything was absolutely delicious and mouthwatering but we both decided the ribs we ordered weren't enough and we could've ate two more racks. They were the highlight of our meal. So scrumptious!!! I also loved the chili lime flavored corn and the plantains were so sweet and flavorable. \\n\\nThe best part about Pig Floyds besides the amazing food for us was the allergy awareness. They accommodated all my boyfriends allergies. This is something 4 rivers and other places don't do. It was nice for him to be able to try multiple sides and all the dishes they offer.

I was in a breakfast taco mood and searched the Yelp App one weekend looking to do a Taco Adventure.  There are so many taco options out there and sometimes it's tough to find a place that exceeds expectations, but low and behold Tierra Linda Taqueria kept popping up with respectable reviews and they did not disappoint.  This gas station taco place turned out to be pretty darn good as I was impressed.    \\n\\nIt's located inside the Shell Gas Station on the 183 south service road.   Seating is close quarters with a bar area that holds about 4-5 comfortably, they are nestled between a Cell Phone Service Provider and a Bitcoin ATM.  Yeah, you can buy Bitcoins via ATM now - what the...?  FYI one BC is going for about $10K now.  But I'm not here to invest into some high risk venture, I'm here for some quality tacos.  \\n\\nSo far we've tried the Chorizo Egg + Cheese (solid), Potato Egg + Cheese (excellent), Bacon Egg + Cheese (good), Egg Ala Mexicana + Cheese (awesome), Al Pastor (good), Fish (Tilapia) Tacos (excellent), Beef Fajita (very good), and Carne Asada (flavorful).  The first visit we ordered 5 tacos and the bill was $12, they only charge 35 cents for cheese for which they give you plenty. It all tasted good and you didn't get that sluggish feeling afterwards.  \\n\\nMy favorite b-fast taco by far is the Eggs Ala Mexicana, it's got eggs + jalapenos and is light and fluffy.  I always add cheese and avocado to it. \\n They have a 2 taco plate with rice and beans for $6.99 which is very reasonable.  Corn tortillas are made in-house, none of the tacos were greasy and everything was cooked to perfection.  There are 4 salsas to choose from - 2 greens, 1 orange habanero, 1 spicy red.  The spicy green (jalapeno + garlic + oil mix) is my fave.  The tortas look good, I haven't tried the chicken fajita yet, and their burrito looks very appetizing - which they also grill.  That's definitely on my to-do list.   \\n\\nThe tacos here were so good I went back the following weekend and it was the same quality and consistency.  They have some regulars there, for which I now have become one of them after hitting them up several times w/in the past few weeks.  Not open on Sundays, breakfast served all day (yay!) and the service here has always been prompt and courteous.

Literally a minute drive from my house. It's never out of my way, and my toddler loves him a cheese roll up. This staff is operating on a level I didn't even know possible, like I actually have had in depth conversations with my friends about this Taco Bell and it's staff on numerous occasions. It is nothing less than perplexing. Why am I writing a review for a Taco Bell? Who knows. No one needs a review for Taco Bell, you know what it is, you know what you're paying for. But here we both are. \\n\\nFirst off, I swear the hiring criteria here is: you must either be legitimately the nicest person on planet earth or you have to be on quaaludes 24/7 and have minimal grasp on how to function as an adult. It's about a 50/50 mix. I get tons of compliments on my hair and nails. One guy will recognize my car and tell me to come up to the window when I get to the speaker. I usually only order a Mountain Dew (why is Taco Bell Mountain Dew vastly superior to all other Mountain Dews?), he usually gives it to me for free. The nice employees will say hi to my kids and just generally live up to the \\"nicest person on planet earth\\" label. \\n\\nBut man, if you're rolling up at midnight or later you are in for a treat. And by treat I mean ineptitude so astounding that it can't be anything but absurdly hysterical. I'm not being sarcastic, I genuinely love these late night adventures. I could probably write a blog about the ridiculous things I've had grown adults do and say at this location. \\n\\nOne night, I have a conversation that follows:\\n\\"One large Mountain Dew and one quesadilla.\\"\\n\\"Wait, a quesadilla? Like with cheese?\\"\\n\\"Yes, just the cheese quesadilla.\\"\\n\\"So one cheese quesadilla.\\"\\n\\"Yup, one cheese quesadilla and one large Mountain Dew.\\"\\n\\"A Mountain Dew?\\"\\n\\"Yes.\\"\\n\\"... what size?\\"\\n\\"A large.\\"\\n\\"So a large Mountain Dew?\\"\\n\\"Yes, and the cheese quesadilla.\\"\\n\\nThat's not an exaggeration, I pulled into the parking lot after to text my friend the interaction that had just happened. And, I was given a medium Mountain Dew and a chicken quesadilla. \\n\\nAnother night, it was around 1am. I have a clear view of the store once I pull onto Worthington Galena. Theres no one else at Taco Bell. No one had recently left before. No one was behind me. It was just me and had been for a while. I order a drink, those chicken nacho chips they had at the time, and a cheese roll up. Dude seems flustered taking my order but nothing I felt the need to write down immediately after, I pull up, hand him a $20, get my food and remind him I had a drink. He gives me the wrong one and has to make another. I pull out of the drive thru and realize my order is two quesadillas, two soft tacos, and a bean burrito. There was no one else around for him to accidentally mix up our orders. When I came back he admitted he must have heard me wrong. Please take a moment to compare the order I placed to what I got. What in the actual heck. I had paid for this big order too so he ends up pulling $15 out of his pocket and hands it to me. \\n\\nI have numerous other late night incidents like these but I feel like the aforementioned visits paint a clear visit at the levels of nonsense that can happen hear. Any fast food chain would be a 3 star due to lackluster food quality and mediocre service but the sheer absurdity of this place earns an additional star. Thanks for the lols Taco Bell quaalude users, you've made my nights infinitely more amusing over the last two years.\\n\\nEdit: not even 24 hours after this post I stop by for a, you guessed it, large Mountain Dew. The man is barely audible over the speaker. The total was $2.14. I hand him a 5 and 14 cents. He hands me a Baja blast, I tell him I just wanted the regular Mountain Dew. He hands me another drink, and $2.75 in change. He walks away from the window. Okay then. I drive away, my drink is a diet Mountain Dew.

I had a shrimp special on pasta in a garlic olive oil sauce, and it was fabulous. Again, I had so much that I couldn't finish it!

It reminded me of a futuristic drug den, that I would spend my teenage years doing illicit drugs and straight chillin.  With that being said, I made it here a few times.  While, most of the other visits were from a while ago, it seems for the most part, things are about the same (with a few drink/food menu changes).\\n\\nDepending when you come, expect to be carded by security.  After that, your choice is at a hostess stand- either go to the left for the bar area (which is kind of small, imo), or right for the dining.  Mind you, if you need help making up your mind, this place when it comes to food, is like small plates- kind of like the concept at Victory (where small sandwiches reign supreme).  Can you get full? Of course.  Just not on a 22oz ribeye.\\n\\nI have eaten here and sat at the bar a few times.  When I dined here, I came with 4 of my friends at the time.  They had an option called \\"a little something of everything\\" which literally included one of every food item.  And yes, I have done this twice.  It costs in the $100 (sorry can't remember the exact) range, and you do not get a discount.  However, it is nice to sample all they have to offer.\\n\\nThe food is alright I guess.  I mean, if you want a pregame spot, I would recommend this place to get a few snacks and get primed for the big night out at whatever club you are going to that night.  If neon or loud music isn't your thing, steer clear.\\n\\nThe food ranges from $3-14 and comes in the form of skewers, buns, and finger foods, and the heavy hitter, the Shoyu ramen.  They have about 4-5 veg options as well.  The chicken wings, green beans, and steak skewers are usually popular.  \\n\\nFor the drinks, they have about 7 \\"15 minute cocktails\\" (that's what he refers to crafted cocktails) that range from $10-12.  If you are new to trying Japanese whiskey, this would be a good place to try it in one of their cocktails- like the Stray Tiger or the Hi-T (which also comes in a pitcher, $45).  The hidden gem here, is the 12oz Sapporo draft, which is $4.  I could honestly give them a $100 bill and tell them to keep pouring until I piss myself.  Speaking of, the bathrooms are on the dining side, look out for coke baggies (you didn't hear that from me) in there.\\n\\nMy most recent visit here, I brought my friends here (who came from the Bay area) to get some drinks while we were waiting for our reservation upstairs at Marcel.  The bar, to say the least, in typical fashion, was mobbed.  While, it isn't anything I am not used to, the music was pretty loud as well.  Kind of hard to carry a conversation.  Which, was kind of good, because if I had to listen to the 5 foot douchebag with the pink sweater tied around his neck try to hit on another girl, I would have planted his face in one of the nearby high tops.\\n\\nSo, yes, unfortunately the basement crowd from Ormsby's can spill out over here.  The mixed drinks are decent here, but when it gets crowded, I would recommend getting something simple, if you are trying to get drunk quicker- like shots or something.  \\n\\nIs it unique?  In Atlanta, I would say so in a sense.  Strippers still love taking their pics in front of the neon sign, so I am glad to see even after a few years, the novelty hasn't worn off."},{"name":"Flower Child","address":"11721 Rock Rose Ave, Ste 120","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Great place for healthy options and place for conversations.\\n\\n  The nice things that I appreciate here is comfortable environment and the staff is willing to cater your meal to your selctions.\\n  Lots of simple and clean healthy choices here at the end of the street and you have time to sit and enjoy your meal with conversations as well.\\n\\n  Fresh salads and good proteins."},{"name":"Eat Me Thai","address":"6364 Fraser Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4","text":"This place is a hidden gem.

I love the atmosphere... modern and zen.   Lots of light woods, white gleaming spaces, and matte blacks.  It was pretty busy during a lunch time but everyone was fairly quiet... a lot of people working on laptops and enjoying a coffee or a light lunch.  Personally, I was about the coffee and that case filled with one of the best looking pastries in the city.  I was floored when they said they did everything in house... most coffee spots get them trucked in.\\n\\nFlat White - While I really enjoyed my flat white for the flavour... I'm sure this wasn't a true flat white.  Though the microfoam was fairly well... there was a lot... like latte cappuccino which is ok.  People dont always get the right balance.  I felt this was still a good flavour ... it was definitely pushing the boundaries of my acidity acceptance.  Strong orange pith notes come though.  4/5\\n\\nPistachio kouign amann - Dear lord... why didnt anyone tell me that Nemesis knew their way around butter and sugar like this.  I would have come here WAY sooner since it was so closed to my place.  Caramelized crisped crust that shatters perfectly on first bite.  Rich pistachio cream baked in between buttery layers.  Need I say more?  5/5\\n\\nNot all baristas know flat whites but I was hoping Nemesis would have figured that part out.  BUT those kouign amanns... give... give it all and I would be very very happy."},{"name":"Prime Pizza","address":"5290 Riverdale Rd","city":"Atlanta","stars":"1.5","text":"Not even worth one star. Food was absolutely disgusting. The guy only brought half our order to the hotel room after an hour of waiting?! Is that a joke?? Who delivers food and brings half of it?! You had one job bro. You didn't even try!! I had the lamb pizza. It was actually olive cheese pizza. There was 4 specks of lamb on it. And the cheese was cold by the time it got here. My husband had a calzone. It was literally a pizza folded in half and baked LOL. CALZONES DONT HAVE SAUCE INSIDE. You might need to know that before making them!! ***EYE ROLL SO HARD MY EYES ARENT COMING BACK.*** The cheese bread was sub sandwich bread smashed together. So when you peel it apart, the cheese is only stuck to one half. It's seriously the worse food I've ever seen someone attempt to make.

I told a friend that I'd meet up with him at Tasty n Sons. I got there, and he was sitting at a table with 3 other people I had never met. Introductions were made, and prosecco was poured into my glass. I caught a glimpse of the menu, and said to my friend, \\"hey, is this the same people that do Toro Bravo\\". And he says, yeah, he's right there (i.e., across the table from me). So, that's how I came to meet the lovely owner of Toro and Tasty.\\n\\nA lot of the menu was on the table already, and more continued - apparently because we had to critique as much as we could. So, here it goes:\\n\\nDRINKS:\\n- Rite of Spring: very refreshing and a favorite at the table.\\n- Dim Summore - I love the ginger in this drink. It gives it a little zing that you don't normally get in a bloody mary.\\n- Ruby's Nanny - mostly your typical, solid, delicious bloody mary.\\n- Vampiro - definitely MY favorite drink of all of them... I love the orange in there, with a touch of honey, it's little sweet - and then the jalapeno gives just a little spice. Yum!\\n- Honeycomb cocktail: just a touch too bitter for me, but good if you are an anise fan\\nThe boneshaker: My other most favorite on the list, so good it could get me into big trouble. Kinda like adult lemonade.\\n\\nFOOD:\\n- Toast & Jam: um, okay - this is not your normal toast and jam. It had Teleme cheese, and the jam must have been homemade. It was creamy, fruity, and the bread was buttery. So good.\\n- Fried Egg & Cheddar Biscuit - we had both the sausage and the chicken options. It rivals Pine State. The only thing that it doesn't have that Pine State has is the amazing gravy. \\n- House Bacon Burger: Okay, I HAD to have the burger. I thought that it was perfect - bacon for the salt, delicious blue cheese. But get over to Bamboo for the best burger of your life. I promise.\\n- Monk's Caroline Cheesesteak: It was a cheesesteak. Good, greasy, cheesy. The meat was awesome - no gristle here!\\n- Polenta & Ragu with mozzarella and fried egg: I don't remember.\\n- Burmese Red Pork Stew: I remember, and it was awesome. I love the eggs on pork. It's a great combo.\\n- Pork Cutlets: This was a lovely dish... anything fried is good for me. Well, when I say \\"good\\", I mean I like it!\\n\\nSWEETS:\\nWe had both options... the chocolate chip cookies were fantastic and the ristretto was creamy and dense.\\n\\nThe atmosphere ROCKS! The wood throughout, the tall ceilings - but even though they are tall, it still has a warm and inviting feel. Something that can sometimes be lost when the ceiling gets too far away from you. The colors are great, and it's always nice to have the kitchen right there. The staff was great, of course... and for sure I'd eat there again and again... I would not complain one bit."},{"name":"Giggles Comedy Club","address":"Prince Pizzeria","city":"Saugus","stars":"3.5","text":"You won't be disappointed with the comedians at Giggles.

Sure the view isn't all that scenic, but the little waterfall, the flowers, and a good meal with friends is definitely my scene. \\n\\nFor an appetizer, I usually share the queijo fresco con tomates.. pretty much the Portuguese version of an Italian tomato/mozzarella bruschetta. I LOVE the Portuguese white cheese that comes with the plate.. and they serve it with enough tomatoes to last you for dayyyysss (line your pockets with ziplock bags, perhaps?). I think it's a plate good for 3.. with 2 people, you'll feel slightly full and rethink your entree. I'm a fan of the steak sandwich for an entree. It comes with some oversized bread, but it's always cooked just the way I order it. I also recommend the filetes de peixe fritos (fried fillets).. but only if you get another entree and share both with a friend. It's really just too much fried on one plate for one person (or at least for me it is). OOH.. and the fried potatoes are especially tasty (and plentiful as a side dish for entrees)! \\n\\nThe service is fantastic and the waitresses have always been charming and forgiving when I pronounce my dishes incorrectly. My one complaint is no complaint at all.. they're too attentive and well..

I normally am the type of person that believes in \\"If you have nothing good to say, just don't say anything at all\\" but this happens to be one of the exceptional cases where I feel like, I owe it to my fellow yelpers to prevent more people falling for this (based on its exterior appearance).\\n\\nMy wife and I got here because we were having a busy day and had to skip lunch so were soooper hungry. We didn't bother looking up reviews on yelp (rare case where we didn't bother) and thought -- it seems nice from the outside and how bad can someone make 'standard fare Indian food'. They have a lunch buffet for $11/ person and we arrived just after that ended so we were essentially going to pay $14/ person. Which would have been fine, except it seemed like most of the dishes were either left in place from lunch or reheated and served (can't be sure, because, we weren't there earlier). After we tasted the food we instantly opened up yelp on our phones to check reviews and were expecting no more than 2 starts and were blown away by the 4 and 5 stars. I wasn't able to figure out why -- but it now makes sense. I think most people that have rated this high just don't know better. For instance, check any Indian sounding name or anyone that eats Indian food regularly in the list of reviews and I'll be amazed if you show me even an average review from such person.\\n\\nThere were about 3 people in the restaurant (that could likely seat about 50) and yet, the 'naans' and the 'pakoras' were half empty (down to the last few) and stale. The 'channa masala' tasted like someone went and bought a bunch of canned garbanzo beans and tomato sauce (also canned) from safeway, mixed and heated them together. Absolutely no taste of channa masala in it. The Baingan (eggplant and potato) was undercooked (the eggplant was hard) and soaking in oil. The palak panner was a smooth blend (no visible signs of paneer blocks in it). Probably the only thing that seemed like it wasn't ruined was the plain dal (one of the easiest things to make in Indian cuisine) -- but, at $14/ person, I think the bar ought to be higher than that! After I could barely eat anything from my first round of the buffet, I set my plate aside and ask the lady if it was possible to get some fresher naans and pakoras. She brought them out and they were fresh indeed but there was no salt in the pakoras. At that point, I thanked her for trying and gave up on trying to salvage this. Paid and walked out. My wife (who was a lot hungrier than I was) ended up eating a proper meal somehow, only to end up  throwing up most of it, when we got home.\\n\\nMy suggestion -  Drive ~4mi north, west or south and go to any other (literally any other) Indian restaurant (I've visited them all) and you'll be better off."},{"name":"iPho Noodle House","address":"3005 West Lake Mary Blvd, Ste 108","city":"Lake Mary","stars":"4","text":"We recently discovered this restaurant in Lake Mary.

Olive Oil was one of the most unique flavors I've tried, but I don't know if I could eat an entire scoop. Strawberry Honey Balsamic with Black Pepper was okay, but I didn't find it that great. That being said, I am a bigger fan of more indulgent flavors. I personally hated Mince Meat Pie(a seasonal flavor), because it kind of tasted like a trail mix blend?

The dumplings were so juicy and flavorful, and the skin was nice and chewy (this isn't the fried version btw). The shrimp rice noodles were by far some of the best I've had, with the texture being so delicate and soft but held together well, and although the shrimp in them were small, they were juicy-- must be because they're close to the harbor?

Jester King Brewery shares a same plot of farm land with Stanley's Farmhouse Pizza both with there on farm structure but maybe 15 feet from each other. Jester King is known for using wild yeasts in their beers.

The Das Wunderkind! was a nice sour, not puckering but what seemed like perfect summertime drinking to cool down from the Texas heat. The Mad Meg, did not leave me much to remember but it was a tad sour, and the winner of round 1 has to have been the Black Metal, it was dark, strong, slightly sweet as it rolled down the tongue and to the back of the throat. It tasted like a bourbon barrel aged beer simae to Goose Island's Bourbon County. \\n\\nSecond round I had the Wytchmaker - earthy, floral rye IPA with tropical fruit notes, Farmhouse Rye IPA 7.6% ABV; a Tepache Especial - sparkling dry pineapple wine, 7.2% ABV and a 2013 Perennial - sparkling cider with Texas apples, aged in okay 6.8% ABV. (Tepache Especial and 2013 Perennial made by Argus Cidery). The Wytchmaker is a great, mildly hoppy definitely with hints of tropical fruits along the lines of guava, papaya, mango. \\n\\nIt's a beautiful farm with outdoor seating (so make sure you go when it's not too hot out). If you're hungry, you can get pizza from their neighbors at Stanley's Farmhouse Pizza, in the adjacent farmhouse, they do have indoor dining, a bar and water misters hooked up for those hot days. \\n\\nGreat brewery, but not everything's served in from the tap, some are served from bottles chilled on ice, but it's still a nice craft brewery different from most other craft breweries, this sort of reminds me of a local Southern California craft Belgian-style brewery, The Bruery, in Placentia, California in Orange County but with less beers."},{"name":"Fullerton Wines","address":"1966 NW Pettygrove St","city":"Portland","stars":"5","text":"If you are looking for a place to taste wonderful wines and meet great people, this is the place.

It was a rainy dreary day in Portland and initially our intention was to go to Screen Door. We drove by and saw a very large line. We decided to give it a go and drive around to find parking - no such luck. We also realized we forgot to bring umbrella's so we chose to find some other place to eat. Somehow Tasty n Sons came up and we decided to give it a go.\\n\\nWe made our way over and drove around the area to find parking and fortunately did about 2 blocks away. There were about 10 people waiting for a table and my husband put our name in. The young man up front told him the wait time (about 25 minutes on a Saturday afternoon) and mentioned that the bar seating was first come first serve. Well, leave it up to my spectacular husband who found two on the end - perfect!\\n\\nWe sat down got menus and started scouring our options. The bartender was awesome! We chose coffee cocktails, my husband Pick Me Up and myself a Rumble Bee. Both were so very well crafted and easy to drink (probably could have had about 5 of them). Our second round of drinks included bartenders crafting for my husband a gin based tart drink and myself a smoked pear Old Fashioned both incredible. The bartender here is just so talented.\\n\\nFor food we chose two items to get and split - Nashville Hot Chicken Sandwich with chips and the new menu addition Smoked Pork Sandwich with french fries. The food came out quickly and as prepared. The Nashville Hot Chicken Sandwich was first. The chicken was amply breaded, moist/tender, and a great level of spice. We ate the entire thing in about 4 minutes it felt like. Now, the chicken was good but when the Smoked Pork Sandwich came out I knew it was something special. IT WAS TO DIE FOR! The hatch chili cheese sauce, fried onions, jalapeno escabeche, and crusty bread were perfect. This sandwich is perfect! There is no way to describe the smoky, salty, wonder that this sandwich is. The poor chicken sandwich was amazing but was just average in comparison to the pork.\\n\\nI loved the decor, the staff, the food, and the neighborhood. Tasty n Sons is a part of a chain of Tasty and you bet I'd enjoy any of them without caution. \\n\\n* Also, having recently relocated from NYC I was dying for food of this level and Tasty n Sons delivered!!!!!!"},{"name":"Commodore Lounge","address":"1650 W Burnside St","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"\\"The Commie\\" was my neighbor.

I remember walking to the front to order and making eye contact with the chefs in the back. I really felt like I was looking into a Spanish aunt's kitchen and peeking in to say, \\"Feed me!\\"\\n\\nI had to order enough food for some hungry people back home so I got 15 tacos: 5 al pastor, 5 carnitas, and 5 pork something. Sorry, the last 1 wasn't memorable so I didn't bother to remember what type it was. I made my order and waited 10 minutes or so. There were tvs playing a soccer game so everyone dining at the time was certainly engrossed. \\n\\nI brought the tacos home and had everyone try 1 of each kind. As I was opening the containers, I noticed that they wrapped each taco in parchment  paper so that they wouldn't stick together. So thoughtful! Anyway, each box came with 2 types of hot sauces. I definitely need to ask for extra sauce next time since they were so good!  Out of the 3 type of tacos I ordered, the al pastor was hands down the most flavorful one. The tacos here use a corn tortilla that's larger in size in comparison to other taco places I have been to. I'm mentioning this because each taco comes with 2 corn tortillas, which fills you up pretty quickly.  \\n\\nNot the best taco place in Orlando, but it WILL hit the spot.

I've been here twice for dinner and yes, it's \\"meh.\\"\\n\\nThat said, people I've gone with have mostly liked the place.  One of my co-workers swears by the Goat Stew, which I have tasted and really liked, but other than a couple of signature dishes, I was not blown away.  (And how often do you want to eat goat anyway?)\\n\\nThe dishes seem mostly unusual, but are not necessarily good.  I'm not convinced that adding some spice or \\"heat\\" to a dish necessarily makes it tasty.  Yes, the calamari is spicy and so are the Buffalo Brussels Sprouts, but honestly, big deal. Making something hot isn't the same thing as adding depth of flavor or any complexity to the dish.  And generally, I've found here that the spice kills the flavor of the main ingredient.\\n\\nI'm also a little confused when people describe this place as \\"Southern.\\" Just because collard greens are featured as a side, Monday night is Fried Chicken Night, and you can find the occasional beignet at brunch doesn't make a restaurant \\"Southern\\" - any more than adding spice does!\\n\\nLast time I was there, I had a fish special which was tasty but nothing to write home about.  Fish, rice and a little savory relish on top will always be decent.  The second time I went, I had a black bean veggie burger, that tasted like... black beans.  Fortunately, I love black beans, but again, there was nothing to really set the dish apart, except for the guacamole on top, which was very good.\\n\\nFinally, I find that getting in here and parking is always a drag, not to mention the no reservations/no-seating-your-party-until-everyone-arrives policy - which in my experience has been inconsistent at best and sometimes, even involves \\"scoldiness\\" from a hostess - but only if you're lucky! Two times i've been and someone in my party has always gotten a ticket. Somerville is just brutal that way, I know, but this really isn't the restaurant to take that chance on.  They do not encourage lingering, anyway. They want you to eat and get the hell out and the people at the door are  actually not shy about letting you know that.  The waitstaff, which is superb, is in no hurry, however, and both times during which we did linger, we've left substantial tips to make up for the lack of turnover.\\n\\nI guess if I lived in the neighborhood or were more of a hipster, I'd rave about this place too.

I've come to hate brunch, not because of brunch itself but because of the inconvenience it represents, from waiting in line for hours on a weekend morning to paying ridiculous prices for eggs. I've come to feel the same about tapas, too - too trendy and not enough bang for your buck in most cases. So when Don B said we'd be going to a breakfast tapas place that was likely to have a bit of a wait on a Friday morning, I was skeptical. But if the five stars above didn't give away the ending to this story, let me just give you a spoiler alert - it was ALL worth it! \\n\\nFirst of all, the wait wasn't terrible when we went just down the street to Ristretto and got some delicious coffee to sip on while we waited. By the time we returned, we had two spots at the counter looking out onto the street. Fairly cozy quarters, but totally enough space to enjoy our meals because they were small plates that came out one by one. \\n\\nEverything we had was delicious, but the standout for me by far was the Burmese red pork stew over rice and with eggs two ways. The most comforting, flavorful dish I've had in a long time. In fact, many of the dishes here come with an egg or two thrown on top, and that's just the way I like it. Even the non-eggy dishes were a hit, from the chocolate potato doughnut (a star in a town filled with famous doughnuts) to the bacon wrapped figs (sounds like a played out app but somehow they make it unique  here). \\n\\nI just wish I had the stomach to try every single thing on this menu. And with their surprisingly reasonable prices, I probably could do that without going totally broke.

Ordered a bunch of appetizers and small plates and shared them amongst our group. This included the Handmade Potato Gnocchi, Mussels, Ricotta And Mozzarella Fritters, Buffalo Fried Brussel Sprouts, and Fried Calamari.\\n\\nQuality\\nHighland Kitchen has a very interesting and eclectic menu. They definitely do not conform to one style, but most of the dishes seem like spins on classic items. Not wanting to commit to a single item, as a group we ended up selecting an assortment of dishes. First out for us was the Handmade Potato Gnocchi. Probably my favorite item of the evening, it was served with a short rib ragout as well as some parmesan. It was the short rib that really made the dish, as the tender meat paired extremely well with the gnocchi. Next was the Mussels, served in a wonderful coconut-curry-lobster broth. The mussels were fine, but the broth was excellent. I could have used more bread to sop up every drop. The Ricotta And Mozzarella Fritters were a fun item. I think they needed a bit more mozzarella and a bit less ricotta, but they still worked with the tasty dipping sauce. The Buffalo Fried Brussel Sprouts were probably the weakest dish. I thought the combination of buffalo sauce and brussel sprouts would work, but it just made them a mushy spicy mess. The Fried Calamari, was okay, but I would not order it again. I thought they used too much breading, and I would have liked them a bit crispier.\\n\\nQuantity\\nAfter spending most of the day at a brewery, we were looking more to snack that to eat. Therefore, a bunch of small plates seemed like a good option. Three of us shared the five items and we all left more than satisfied.\\n\\nValue\\nSince we stuck to the appetizers menu, none of our dishes cost over $12. The rest of the menu seemed very affordable as well, with most entrees in the $15 to $25 range.\\n\\nAmbiance\\nHighland Kitchen is located in Somerville, Massachusetts, just north of Boston. It is found near a busy little intersection. When you enter they have a bar area to your left and then dining room to the right. The bar is fairly large, with a single television posted in the corner. The dining room is relatively big, however still not enough to satisfy all demand. Blackboards hang from many walls displaying both food and drink specials. The decor is pretty simple, aside from these strange light fixtures that hang from the ceiling. The music was alternative rock, but with the sounds from the kitchen as well as the large crowd, it was difficult to hear anything.\\n\\nCrowd\\nHighland Kitchen was an extremely busy spot on Saturday night. We seemed to arrive at the perfect time, as several tables had just gotten up, so we were able to sit down almost immediately. The folks that arrived after us were not quite as lucky. Unfortunately they do not allow reservations, so you may have to wait a bit for a table.\\n\\nService\\nDespite being busy, they were able to quickly find us a place to sit. Our server was at our table almost immediately and the food came out surprisingly fast. An excellent job on a night where the crowd easily could have slowed things down.\\n\\nParking\\nLimited street parking is available in the area. Keep an eye on signs if you do decide to drive, but I would recommend using a car service.\\n\\nExtra\\nI feel like to get a full impression of Highland Kitchen I would have needed to dive into the entrees. The appetizers and small plates were hit and miss, but that would not deter me from visiting again."},{"name":"Tasty n Sons","address":"3808 N Williams Ave, Ste C, Hub Building","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"Everything was delicious!\\n\\nThe potatoes bravas were probably my favorite, followed by the fried chicken biscuit. The asparagus was okay, and the biscuits with blueberry compote dish was the reason for the loss in star. The biscuits seemed a little stale, while intentional, was not what I expected. I like the idea of letting the harder biscuit soak the blueberry compote, but I just wasn't a fan, especially of the sprinkled sugar on top.\\n\\nService was great, and they were playing quite a few of 90s r&b jams which I loved. The layout wasn't super impressive, so I wouldn't go for the milieu. \\n\\nNonetheless, the place hit the spot for brunch, and you probably can't for wrong with anything you order."},{"name":"Cafe Fresh Bagel","address":"1155 Washington St","city":"Norwood","stars":"3.5","text":"First experience at Cafe Fresh Bagel this morning. I will never go back. A customer in the store had an issue with how long his order was taking and asked for a refund. The customer wasn't happy and was rude in the manner he was asking for his refund, but a employee of Cafe Fresh Bagel escalated the situation and was completely unprofessional. This was a Sunday Morning with multiple families in the store and the employee came out from behind the counter yelling profanities at the customer requesting the refund and threatening to fight him. When the customer picked up his 2 year old daughter, the employee continued to shout profanities at the man and his daughter. The customer exited the store with his daughter and girlfriend and the employee followed them into the parking lot continuing to yell profanities threatening to fight. \\n\\nI was there with my 4 year old daughter and I could not believe how unprofessional this employee was. We will never be back and I'm sure most of the families at the store during this incident will not be returning as well."},{"name":"Hop's Chicken","address":"675 Ponce De Leon Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3","text":"I had the chicken biscuit. While the flavor of the chicken was okay, it was overlooked and tough. I decided to give the place another try before posting a review.  After my third try I have determined they don't know how to cook chicken, only burn it."},{"name":"Pig Floyd's Urban Barbakoa","address":"1326 N Mills Ave","city":"Orlando","stars":"4.5","text":"Ughhhhh, NOOOOOO. Absolutely NOT! While I'm a huge fan of the original Pig Floyd's, I was not at all familiar with barbacoa barbecue  and in my opinion, barbecue sauce and barbacoa should never even be on the same plate, much less ever touch. I think it's important that employees ask if customers are familiar with barbacoa or they've ever tried it, give a description, and then let them decide if they still want it so they don't end up dropping $25 and still leaving hungry :("},{"name":"Southern Kin Cookhouse","address":"500 Assembly Row","city":"Somerville","stars":"4","text":"Southern Kin was great!

Inside seating is ample and their dishes are just out of this world. \\n\\nA must have starter has to be the fried yucca. It's similar in taste to a potato and has the most awesome creamy, starchy texture on the inside and crispy, crunchy layer on the outside. When combined with either the spicy Brazilian sauce (spicier than expected!) or the savory dill sauce, you can't go wrong with this! \\n\\nAlso ordered the seafood casserole and fish and shrimp moqueca which were also fantastic. Each dish was chock full of seafood and the rice in the casserole dish soaked up all those lovely seafood juices. Unreal! The fish and shrimp moqueca also have a lovely savory broth that's extremely flavorful. These two are definitely must haves! \\n\\nIf you like some sweetness to your dishes (and also enjoy plantains) then get the lasagna de banana which I thoroughly enjoyed (but didn't get this time)."},{"name":"Southern Kin Cookhouse","address":"500 Assembly Row","city":"Somerville","stars":"4","text":"Just moved here from LA, first time at Southern Kin, and I was blown away.

It was one of those nights when I knew that I wasn't going to get home in time to make dinner. My son and I decided on taking out Pei Wei because it was close and we've enjoyed the food there before.\\n\\n I got the bento box which allowed me to choose from any menu item, some sushi, between dumplings and a spring roll, and a salad or edamame. I got Kung Pow steak , spicy tuna rolls , some fried chicken dumplings, and a salad. My son got the orange chicken and all the same things I did. I ordered a Polynesian poke bowl for my husband. The Bento boxes run about $10 and it's a lot of food for the price. I like to to have a little of this and that when I eat so the bento box was a good choice. The Kung Pao steak was very tasty. I liked all the veggies and the peanuts in it. I really liked it a lot except for the fact that there was a ton of grease in the container after I ate it. I got it with brown rice which was pretty dry even for brown rice. the spicy tuna rolls we're fairly good. They had a kick to them. The salad that came along with them you was a nice size and tasted fresh.. the Asian dressing that comes with it is really good as well. \\n\\nMy husband did not appreciate his poke Bowl. Only because I didn't realize it would have so much cilantro. I didn't order it without the cilantro and he wasn't able to eat it because it was just like they took fistfuls of cilantro and put it on there. He despises it and my attempts to pick it all out for him were not enough because the kind of just stuck to  everything. I guess it was my fault so because I should have asked.\\n\\n The food came out quick and everybody was very pleasant at the restaurant. I will be back because for the most part I always enjoy their food. I like the fact that I can order extra vegetables and brown rice instead of white and now they even have cauliflower rice as an option. This place is always a healthier option than fast food in my book when you need a quick meal to go."},{"name":"The Picnic House","address":"723 SW Salmon St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"The menu is eccentric but the food was amazing.
