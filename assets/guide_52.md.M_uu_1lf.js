Anyway, we had a 60 person dinner event and decided to use Kennedy school gymnasium. they were good at figuring out the projector for our slide presentation, everything looked nice and they set up a bar in the back. However, the food allotment was uber stingy.  they had crudites for an hour before the meal and all of the celery was brown at the edges. Don't know when they made the veggie platter--must have been the day before. the meal (each of us paid $40-- which included the meal and the space rental) was spring salad, penne pasta, and a lasagna-like chicken and pasta with cream sauce dish, and garlic bread. We ran out of garlic bread and when we notified the waitress she said , \\"sorry that's all we have for you,\\". Then we ran out of the chicken dish before everyone went through the line so the last people didn't get any. Again the answer was, \\"sorry that is the last of it,\\" most of our group was over 60 years old, so i don't think people took big portions. then we ran out of penne pasta too.

The manager must have heard about the pizza order because by the time it arrived suddenly there was more garlic bread and penne pasta--but no chicken dish. The penne pasta, which was the vegetarian option, didn't have many veggies in it, only enough to make it look pretty. Then there was the gluten free option--they made enough for whoever pre-ordered--was a square block of sticky rice with 2 roasted carrots on top. that's it--no protein, no sauce. just plain white rice with 2 baby carrots. The dessert was the icing on the cake--mini desserts, each about 3 bites. Again enough on the platter for everyone to have about 1. coffee and water was included in the $40 price. Stingy. i have been to a lot of conferences and group functions before never have i seen such a stingy allotment for a buffet style dinner. Kennedy school has a garden on site, and maybe they only cook from their garden? it's beginning of May. maybe all they had was spring mix growing? they should buy some food at one of portlands many farmers markets.

Very thin crust, but substantial enough to contain the cheese, sauce, and toppings.

You are greet by a very nice server who walks you through the menu and begins the meal with a round of rolls, cornbread, and cinnamon rolls. These are pretty good. Sometimes, they will offer you cornbread and this dipping soup (can't recall the name, I believe its the water that they use to cook up okra or something). If you're a sweet tea fan, don't forget to order this here!\\n\\nMy favorite dish here is definitely the chicken fried steak. Be ready to be hit with a very significant food comma! It has a hefty serving of peppery gravy over the quite a decent serving of chicken. It is also served with two sides that you can choose! There are many, but I tend to go for the souffl√© and mac and cheese. I also know some of the appetizers here such as okra, which I don't like personally, and the fried green tomatoes are quite popular. Back to the steak, I find the food very tasteful and well cooked. I've been here quite a few times and the food has been very consistent. The only downside here is price. Obviously given the location, the amount they charge is still a bit higher, but the food is so heavy you feel full nonetheless.\\n\\nService is usually spot on.

Waitress took our order which included a red sangria and a lime margarita, a sharing appy, burrito and enchiladas. Appy came, no drinks, no cutlery, no\\nSide plates. Usually I judge a Mexican restaurant by its complimentary salsa and chip. Never got the chance, never have I ever not gotten chips and salsa in a Mexican restaurant. Then my burrito comes and not my husbands dinner. I end up having to eat, still no drinks, had asked twice by now. Finally half way through my meal, the other plate comes. Still no drinks. When they do come the sangria glass was dirty to the touch and tasted average, margaritas was pretty good. Food over all is sub par, no salsa, runny guacamole, kinda bland. I could see we were not the only table being served inconsistently. They told one family they could sit at a dirty table in which they did. It was embarrassing to see them still sitting there with dirty plates all over their table when we left. Reasonably, I would of been able to look over scattered service if the food would of been amazing and fresh, but it's just so basic. Can't even imagine what take out would be like. A real let down.

Even though little things kept cropping up, mainly with the the presentation of the food, we enjoyed the dinner.\\n\\nMy reactions and comments:\\n-- My house salad was delicious and huge; it was meant for two people to share, but I knew I would only want a slice or two. The dressing was light and the tomatoes, cucumbers, shredded carrots and cabbage were sliced or chopped perfectly, though they were hiding underneath the lettuce, so it was an upside-down salad.  \\n-- My salad came with two garlic rolls! They were crunchy on the outside, soft and airy on the inside but needed more garlic inside and out. One had only a couple flecks.\\n-- The sauce is full of great herbs and cooked until it is the right consistency for pizza, a little thick and spreads evenly; without a doubt, delicious. But why does a little sauce on the side cost 50 cents?\\n--While the price is less than East Side Pies, the topping aren't nearly as plentiful. The meatballs were cut like hotdogs for a toddler and half the pizza had 50% more green pepper pieces than the other. \\n--Our server should earn server of the year.

I love to eat out -- that's not an anniversary joke and pause for groans -- and she loves to read. So what could be better than Sunday brunch at Frank and a short walk to Book People?\\n\\nI had taken my two boys -- then 17 and 12 -- to Frank for lunch during SXSW just to show them how amazing Austin could be, even if they couldn't get into 99% of the live shows. I had also gotten a good tip from Robbie at Local Coffee in San Antonio (www.localcoffeesa.com) that Frank was an awesome place to go and the food was pretty good.\\n\\nRight on both counts. When my boys went for lunch, the food was good. Nothing spectacular, but good. It was the atmosphere that popped the place over the top for me. Top-notch graphic design, a smart chilled interior, and ultra-cool clientele and staff made Frank an instant hit for me.\\n\\nWhen my wife and I went, it was a much much hotter day, the hottest this year in fact, 109. And we had the misfortune of being seated in an odd, forgotten attic of sorts. We felt like \\"that\\" brother that Ma and Pa keep in the basement when company comes over. We asked to be moved to a better spot in the attic, which did make a difference, but it still wasn't the best. This was shaping up to be a pretty sorry experience, a real disappointment given how much I'd hyped the place for my wife.\\n\\nThen the food came. Listen...if you've only been to Frank for lunch or dinner, you've missed the best they have to offer. Brunch food was extraordinarily good. I had the corned beef hash which comes with two eggs and toast with apple-butter. My wife ordered a la carte, basic breakfast fare: eggs, bacon, pancakes. Both of our meals were scruptious, attic or no.\\n\\nWe left contented for Book People and ended up spending so much time there, we had dinner at Frank again on our return trip. It was the just good food that I was expecting, but we finally got seated in the main restaurant area.\\n\\nOne note. I get that bacon is the latest ironic-cool thing, but the chocolate-covered bacon was not a naturally good thing. It's a fried-to-dry single piece of bacon that is dipped in some of the best chocolate you'll ever eat. Then that is dipped or sprinkled with fat crystal sea salt. For my time, give me that chocolate and skip the salt and bacon.

At first glance the Ocoee Taco Company doesn't look like much, because it really isn't much. It's a very small restaurant that seats fifteen people at most. But you don't really go to places like OTC for the look, you go for the taste. Overall it's pretty delicious. I've tried most of the menu and overall the food is well prepared and tastes good over other causal Mexican stops around the city. I've certainly tasted a much more unique pallet of home made Mexican food here than most other spots. Now although I do enjoy OTC a lot, I will say that nothing their has exceptionally stuck out to me over other restaurants around the city. The food is good, but I wouldn't really say they have the one staple dish that makes you crave going their. They do have vegetarian dishes which I find to be quite tasty and accommodating. So overall for the food, it's good and you should definitely try it out. However I will note that because it's such a small establishment (which really shouldn't even be a factor), you will probably have to wait at least twenty (20) minutes to receive your food. The restaurant can fill up quickly, especially around peak lunch and dinner hours so don't be surprised if you're forced to wait a little longer than normal for your meal to come out. I find this to be a little surprising actually, because a majority of the dishes in themselves are very basic and come in much smaller portions than most other Mexican establishments. Also parking can be a burden, do to it's small lot, so get their early or find a close place to park.

The look of the place is very hip and modern, yet classy and comfortable.  As I drove up I noticed there was only one way to enter the parking lot, and the other driveway is an exit only, so be careful you enter the right way, there was signage to indicate this but as I will get to later, some people just don't follow signs.  As I pulled into the lot I noticed it looked pretty full, but I was lucky that someone was pulling out just was as I pulled in so I was able to grab a spot.  I can see the parking situation here being a problem on busy days/nights since their own parking lot is not huge.\\n\\nThere is a really nice outdoor covered outdoor patio, and I can see this being a very happening spot on great weather days, but I was by myself and decided to just go inside and take a seat at the counter top.  The inside has a nice long counter area , as well as several  tables and a few booths.  I really liked the decor inside.\\n\\nThe menu is pretty much like the menu at the downtown restaurant, with a few more burger variations and a few more appetizers.  This location also has a full liquor license so you can get your fave beer or alcoholic drink and they had some interesting \\"milk shakes\\" that were alcoholic...might have to try one of these out next time.  The server came up to me as soon as I sat down and handed me a menu.  I decided on getting the \\"Cowboy\\" Style burger, single...which is a single beef patty with cheddar cheese and bacon, a crispy vidalia Onion ring and BBQ sauce on it. Along with the burger I ordered  a side  of Onion rings, and a sweet tea to drink.  My order came out pretty fast but instead of Onion rings they brought me French Fries.  I told my server and he apologized for the mix up and said my Onion rings would be right out, and since they already served me the French Fries I guess its proper policy that they can't give them to anyone else so he said I could keep them if i wanted them anyway.  The burger was awesome, very fresh and tasty and juicy but not too greasy.  The fries were fine, nothing special, but just OK . While waiting for my onion rings to come out the server came by to apologize for the mix up and brought me a complimentary order of the \\"Cheesy Poofs\\" while I waited for my Onion rings.  These were pretty tasty, but probably not something I would order again.  Finally my Onion rings came out and they were worth the wait.  The Onion rings had a nice italian flavored breading on them and were very fresh.  So overall, loved the burger, really liked the onion rings, the fries were fine, and the \\"Cheesy Poofs\\" were ok if you are into that type of thing.  Service was fast and pleasant, and the Sweet Tea was really good to ! \\n\\nNow to the parking situation.....As I was pulling out of my spot and driving out of the lot , and its only one way through the lot, someone that does not follow signs decided to drive into the lot from the exit, and we were facing each other bumper to bumper at the back of the building, and I had several cars behind me so there wasn't much I could do....luckily I was able to pull all the way over and the other driver barely got by me, but I can see the parking situation and the one way lot causing some confusion and frustration when this place gets really packed.\\n\\nI will be back for sure, they have some of the best burgers in Atlanta in my opinion !"},{"name":"Juliano's Pizzeria","address":"15606 SE Mill Plain Blvd","city":"Vancouver","stars":"3.5","text":"The pizza is wonderful.

I was craving Mexican food after recently coming back from a trip to San Francisco (post holiday blues, sigh) so I decided to stop by here. Ordered a beef tongue burrito and some beef and lamb tacos. I suppose they are authentic if authentic means operated by people of the same culture/ethnicity of the food they are making/selling. However, as authentic as they may be, you can tell the food is not made with love and care. My burrito came lukewarm and it quickly turned cold (it was probably microwaved?). I also find it weird that it came on a plate and I was given a knife and fork to eat it instead of wrapped in tin foil. Everything just disintegrated as soon as I cut it, and it turned into a sloppy mess like I was eating dog food. The beef and lamb pieces in the tacos were not tender.

It is solid--great food, outstanding service and a warm ambiance.\\n\\nWith the assistance of our excellent waitperson, the four of us shared:  \\n\\nCONCHAS DEL SE√ëOR DE SIP√ÅN:  Quinoa-crusted diver scallops perched on top of wilted spinach and potato-parsnip pur√©e, with golden beet and crabmeat \\"cannelloni\\", and a duet of red beet and passion fruit reductions.  These were the freshest, best tasting scallops any of us had tasted in forever.  The puree of wilted spinach and potatoe-parsnip was a great complement to the scallops.  I love beets and the \\"cannelloni\\" was very unique.\\n\\nBISTEC NOVOANDINO:  Seasoned Cascade Natural filet mignon, grilled to order, topped with king oyster mushroom salsa crilloa and black beer sauce, accompanied by a traditional humita and a saut√© of fingerling potatoes, aj√≠ Amarillo, celery root, leeks and fris√©e tossed in achiote oil.  This was not your ordinary filet mignon.  It had the best taste and was perfectly pink.  The black beer was unique, but so tasty.  \\n\\nSECO A LA NORTEA:  An old family recipe; lamb shank slow-cooked in the traditional Northern Peruvian style with cilantro, black beer, aj√≠ Amarillo, onions and garlic; served with a bean stew and salsa criolla.  This is an awesome dish.  This is the best \\"comfort\\" food and we loved the way it was prepared.\\n\\nARROZ CON PATO: A gourmet version of an iconic Peruvian dish; pan-seared duck breast and crispy duck confit served over cilantro-infused rice with red bell peppers, peas and carrots.  The duck was another awesome dish.  \\n\\nAs much as I like to try new things, I would order the same four dishes again.  \\n\\nWe arrived at the Portland Airport mid-afternoon; we made a 5:30 reservation.

We had not seen our family in years everyone was from out of town and this place turned our family dinner in to a nightmare.

There wasn't much soup, and the wrapper was a bit too thick. In my opinion, the thickness was great to prevent busting a hole in the XLB when transferring it from steamer to spoon.

I might be expecting a little bit too much for an italian restaurant in Orlando, but this place was not good at all. Not just the food either. \\nMy wife and I were drawn to the \\"Grouper Special\\" we saw on the sign outside and decided to eat here. When we walked in there were at least half a dozen servers sitting around by the front door (not the sign you want to see walking into a restaurant). \\nWe were seated with our 2 kids and the waitress presented herself, asking if she could start us off with a drink. It was really hot so I just wanted some water, and when I declined the bottled water, she kind of made the \\"great this isn't going to be a big ticket table\\" type of face. She then tried to sell me the \\"buy a bucket of Sangria or something and we will give you some bruschetta for free\\". When I told her my wife and I didn't drink, she then became throughly uninterested in us. \\n\\nWe then ordered the lobster ravioli appetizer and some chicken fingers for the kids. The rav's arrived smothered in what seems to be their \\"signature\\" carbonara cream sauce. Totally not fresh ravioli's (trust me, I am a frozen ravioli detector) and they were not hot at all. The sauce was VERY salty and it seemed as if they intentionally tried to hide the flavor of the raviolis by dousing them in it. This was a total mess of a dish; sloppily put together with no imagination whatsoever. There were some artichokes and sun-dried tomatoes that looked as if they died a slow death in the vat of cream sauce. \\n\\nSo we then ordered the grouper special, and I was thoroughly irked by the fact that my wife and I wanted to split this dish, and they had the nerve to charge an additional $3 to split the dish. If this were a classy restaurant with good food, I understand the economics behind it- you want to recoup some of the expense of the seat, but in a place like this, they have no business charging. In fact they have no business charging anything at all. \\n\\nThe Grouper dish arrived split between my wife and I, and it seemed as if they were trying to intentionally send us a signal that they were displeased with the fact that my wife and I wanted to split the dish. I had seen several entree's leave the kitchen, and I can tell you that our dish was intentionally under proportioned. Which, had the food been good, I might have been even more upset about. The food was awful. The Grouper was just as over-seasoned as it was overcooked. Dry, under portioned, and (not fresh), and the pasta was covered in more cream sauce. That was the whole dish. \\n\\nI literally would not go back if the food was free. Except for the bread- the bread was good. If you could sit down and just eat free bread, I might go back. Thats why I gave them two stars. The bread. \\n\\nIf you are serious about eating good italian food, do not go here. You will be left thirsty from the over-salting, and paying way more than the food is worth. \\n\\nYou could probably get better Italian food in Korea."},{"name":"Voodoo Doughnut - Old Town","address":"22 SW 3rd Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"Voodoo's is a fun experience with decent donuts.

The jalapeno salsa only had a kick to it. I only liked the bread with the jalapeno dip. The passion fruit was way too sweet for bread.\\n\\nHere are all the dishes that I've tried:\\n\\nEmpanadas de Carne -- BEST EMPANADAS IN THE WHOLE WIDE WORLD. Ok, maybe not the whole world... but seriously best empanadas I've ever had!!!! The meat is so perfectly seasoned. But get this, they put POWDERED SUGAR on top. Squeeze a little bit of lime juice inside and you're good to go. Man, this dish is to die for. I would come back just for the empanadas. Medium sized comes with 4 empanadas. \\n\\nPicadillo Acebichado - Filet mignon tartare. Pretty tasty, but I've had better. Also, a small portion for the \\"medium\\" sized\\n\\nPalta Rellena de Cangrejo - Mmmm, the topping is good! Nothing really interesting, but good.

Seasoned to perfection.\\n\\nMixta Nikkei - Yum, this dish was delicious too. Interesting taste!\\n\\nCeviche 5 Elementos - Love this kind of ceviche. Fresh fish!! It comes with sweet potato & corn and you're supposed to mix it in with the fish. I've never had sweet potato & corn with ceviche before, but I don't think I'll ever eat ceviche again without it!

Even though it was after lunch (like almost 3pm) the place was packed and had about a 20 minute wait for a table and a fully seated bar.  I guess that's to be expected during SXSW, even though we weren't within the usual SXSW bomb radius.  \\n\\nI asked the harried bartender (one of at least 3-4 that I saw) for a beer recommendation out of what was on tap.  It was hard to hear him over the din of the restaurant, but I went with it and wasn't sorry when the beer came.  Cold, delicious, and refreshing!  Still not totally sure what it was, though.\\n\\nAfter pondering the menu (I always want to eat EVERYTHING), I asked another bartender for a recommendation.  He offered the Southern Boy (a sausage) and the corn cup as his favorites.  Again, I went with it.\\n\\nThe food took long enough to get to me that I was half way through my beer and more than half way to a nice buzz by the time it got to me.  I was actually starting to worry that they had forgotten about me, since it seemed like people that had been seated after me were being served.  But the food was hot and yummy, and I was a bit buzzed, so any worry was forgotten once the food arrived.\\n\\nSouthern Boy:  bun was a bit chilled, and overwhelmed the star of the dish, at least for me.  I ended up pulling off about half of the bun so that the bun to sausage to topping ratio was a bit more to my liking.  The Southern Boy is Blackened, split Vienna Beef Hot Polish link dressed with caramelized onions, crispy pork belly, pepper jack cheese and Dr. Doppelg√§nger BBQ sauce.  The onions definitely dominated the dish, but the nuggets of pork belly were AMAZING.  I wished that there were more of them.  So good.  mmMMMmmm ... pork belly.  The sausage was hot, well charred and flat out yummy.  The sauce was good and fairly plentiful, but the cheese seemed to be a grated-on after-thought.  As a cheese lover, I wished that there was more.\\n\\nCorn Cup:  Consists of grilled corn served off the cob with chili mayonesa, lime juice, cilantro, and cotija cheese. This was just a smidge spicy and made me feel like I was being just a teensy bit healthy ... but really, it had cheese and mayonesa on it ... who am I kidding.  This is not a healthy dish.  It was flavorful and crisp, but I'm not sure if I would get it again.\\n\\nAll in all, a good, filling lunch, but I have to admit, I felt like I wasn't really cool enough to eat there.  So many hip hipsters, so few people of the unremarkable variety like me.

I've been to quite a number of ramen places (Totto ramen, Santouka, Pikachi, Shabu & mein, yume wo katare to name a few) in Boston, and Ganko's miso broth is as close as it gets to how it tastes in Japan. When it comes to ramen, you want to find a place that has a small menu- literally 10 or less items- which is the case with Ganko Ittetsu. That's how you know that they truly specialize in delicious, well prepared ramen. \\n\\nIf you are pulling up for the first time via google maps, stop looking for a big sign that says \\"GANKO ITTETSU\\". Probably everyone has made that mistake and double checked the address if they werent forewarned. It's actually located inside a little shopping center with a bunch of other shops you probably wont go into. The door in is just to the left of a hair salon.  \\n\\nMy usual is the miso w/ black garlic oil. The egg is always cooked perfectly soft-boiled, and the soup is well flavored. The black garlic oil adds JUST the right amount of extra flavor, would highly recommend it. Ramen noodles are chewy/bouncy, never overcooked.\\n\\nIn terms of price, it's about mid-range. $14 and it comes with a whole egg, corn, and 2 slices of pork belly. Not like Santouka, where every little add in costs an extra $1-2, which brings your $14 ramen to $19-20. \\n\\nI will say the only negative is that it's a tiny little shop, and a wait is pretty much always expected at busy times (which is the case for most ramen places in Boston).

The whole experience added up to a relaxed and delicious meal with moments of surprise and delight. \\n\\nYes, the prices are higher than the fineness of the food would suggest, but the food is only part of the equation: there are the ingredients, the ever-changing menu, and the sum of the experience.

Therefore, I was willing to try the one in Brookline, expecting to be the same, or at least very similar.  I was wrong.  First off, I like to try a place at least twice before I give it a bad review someplace, unless the place is unclean or the staff is exceptionally rude.  \\n\\nI remember trying this Brookline location of Jae's years back, and I wasn't happy with it then, but it was not the worst experience.

It wasn't horrible, but it was pretty bland, the sauce seemed like it was from a jar and the noodles were mushy and unappetizing.

Boy, that was a mistake.  \\n\\nIf you tell them that you won't be ordering from the wine list, expect serious attitude. We certainly got our share.  We had stir fried vegetables with fried rice noodles.  My friend ordered a miso soup with her meal.  The miso soup was tasteless and watery.  When she asked about it, she was told that it was supposed to be that way because it was early in the evening and it boils down as the evening goes on.  Um...what?  It would have been nice to have been offered a replacement for the soup or at least an apology instead of a defensive remark.  Secondly, the entre we ordered was stir fried vegetables with fried rice noodles.  It WAS HORRIBLE.  The noodles had the texture and taste of uncooked spaghetti (not exaggerating).  Actually, uncooked spaghetti would have tasted better because, for some reason, the noodles were bitter.  With the vegetables, all that could be taste was the raw garlic.  They were barely cooked as well, but not in a good, al dente way.  The hostess was nice; the waitress was rude from beginning to end.

The smoked salmon O.E. roll came wrapped in cucumber rather than rice which was interesting. My boyfriend commented saying there was too much cream cheese which overpowered the salmon and cucumber. The caterpillar and red dragon rolls were both quite good, and the prawn tempura was nice and crisp and was served with a few broccoli tempura too. The portions for the sashimi and tuna tataki were HUGE! The tataki was cut and seared well, but I found the sauce to be a little bland. Usually at other sushi restaurants, it is a bit sweeter.

Think about the best kolache you have ever had - was it the ranchero at Kolache Factory? Somewhere else? Was it the fillings? So few places focus on the bread, it is more about shoving so much junk in there it not only blows your skirt up, but indeed entirely off as with the Factory's ranchero, the bread is such an afterthought as all the flavors and textures propel themselves through your mouth into your wildest dreams at night. Frank focuses 100% on the bread and it is so amazing- tasty, pillowy soft, not too buttery, deliciousness that it almost takes centre stage away from how great the dog by itself is - plump, thick, juicy, but not salty at all. It only takes a tiny bit of ketchup to bring the plain jane home and make it one of the better hot dog creations I have ever had - and it was just three things. I can see why Moon Tower Inn in Houston completely copied this style - it works in my mouth so well.\\n\\nThe draft list changes constantly so that's why it is not on the website and don't even bother trying to use the yelp reviews either. My first choice they \\"had\\" like in theory but they were out, so I had to go with a second choice that no other review has even mentioned yet. So they have beers but just be flexible about it - and if you want Bud Light you are going to be so overwhelmed with the options here you might just wet yourself (or you might just be a really, really drunk UT freshman.)\\n\\nThere was a minor sense of community here too. My single ladies table was conveniently situated next to a large table that was empty up until the Bacon Makers had been finished and my beer appeared. A large group of what I assume were freshmen, though even 1Ls look like babies to me as old as I am meow, sat down. One of the boys quickly spun around, he had already had a few I am guessing, meekly and exceedingly polite for a drunk person apologized for the noise his group might be making. I don't know if that is an Austin thing but I am from Boston and Southie trash has the same attitude as the standard Houston people that they owe you nothing and will make ALL the noise in the world without ever feeling the slightest bit of remorse.\\n\\nOutstanding place for an alcohol and a delicious hot dog.

The patio, atmosphere and quality of food are all top notch (and deserve at least 4 stars).  The menu is unique in Atlanta and very French indeed.  The prices, on the other hand, are much higher than I remember.  I realize prices need to be adjusted for inflation, but it seems that Anis charges a premium these days because they can get away with it.

The crush was solid and it was good for folding.  The toppings were top notch and the pieces were giant.  Now this pizza was pretty good.  Although I feel like some improvement could be made on the crust around the edges.  The dough was good, don't get me wrong.  Throw in some butter and Parmesan on that bad boy and you might have an A+ pizza.  Now of course this is my preference of course.  \\n\\nATMOSPHERE:\\nWe sat outside while we waited to be called.

Either I've had some AMAZING risotto in my gluttonous past, or The Bancroft's risotto was remarkably bland and flavorless. Furthermore, no amount of salt and pepper could remediate the situation, despite my valiant efforts.

She was quick to take our food and drink order, but we waited 50 minutes for our food. That's not the server's fault, at all, though. That's on the kitchen. The service, in general, was as prompt as it could be, and still very friendly. When the food got there... the mediocrity was insane.\\n\\nAll of the sauces were too sweet. No tang. No heat. Just sweet. The mustard sauce tasted like honey mustard. The two regular sauces, of which one was suppose to be hot, had virtually no difference. And the vinegar sauce? Let's just say vinegar and overly sweet don't mix well.\\n\\nI had the meat combo plate with sliced brisket and pulled pork with collards and baked beans (they were out of stew). The pork was a little dry, but not too bad. It had decent flavor. The brisket was dry, chewy, and had zero char or flavor. And, again, the sauces were too sweet to put on anything. The baked beans were also overly sweet, and the collards had a metallic/sweet taste. So weird.\\n\\nMy wife said her BBQ tofu had great firmness, but that the sauce had zero flavor. After trying the four I had, I couldn't believe it wasn't even sweet, so I tried it. Yup. Completely bland. She did enjoy her kale and other side (I forgot what she had other than kale).\\n\\nOur kids loved their PB&Js. The bacon we got for one of them, though, was as hard and dry as could be.

With Bob Likes Thai's recent lunch menu increase to $12 - and their removal of the Pad Thai from said menu, I was ready to give Jitlada's $11.50 lunch menu a try.\\n\\nIf I had to boil down Jitlada to one word it would be thoughtful.  Though the restaurant is on the smaller side, it has a really nice feel to it.  Calm and quiet, with plenty of seats available when I visited a few days ago, I immediately felt relaxed upon entering.  They were playing soothing jazzy music at just the right volume - just loud enough to be heard, but quiet enough to carry on a normal conversation.  This is one of the things that annoys me about other restaurants.  They play their music so loud that it's impossible to talk across the table with your lunch companion.  Loud music does not good ambiance make!\\n\\nAfter ordering, two spring rolls came out of the kitchen quickly, with a good amount of dip and a couple sprigs of parsley.  Thoughtful and unexpected.  Within ten minutes of ordering, my pad thai arrived.  It was well presented, with a salad and a few small slices of strawberry and orange on the side.  The salad was the perfect size and well dressed, although after devouring it I found a small pool of dressing at the bottom.  No matter!  The orange and strawberries were another surprise treat - something I've never seen before from a Thai restaurant.  As for the Pad Thai itself, it had plenty of chicken but was a little bland for my liking, and I would either order it spicy next time or try something else on the menu.\\n\\nThe service was another high point.

Drinks start being served at 11AM, so plan accordingly if you choose to go this route. \\n\\nAs everyone has said, the wait can get ridiculous here, but the good news is that it is always worth it! Every time I come here though, I feel like they tell me that my group is being seated next, but someone else always get seated first. It's probably because of the size of my parties, but they don't always do a great job of communicating how the line works, especially with the folks who come in with Yelp and people who are waiting for others. Be forewarned - they only seat completed parties, so better tell your late friends an earlier time ;)"},{"name":"Arby's","address":"4950 S Cobb Dr SE","city":"Smyrna","stars":"3","text":"The service here is always impeccable.

I'd eat one everyday if my daily sugar consumption wasn't as high as it already is. And living in Seattle, near not one, but two Top Pot locations, I get my fair share of deliciously fried dough. But on a recent trip to Portland, we decided to stop by this Oregon staple. \\n\\nThere was a line out the door, which I expected, considering the buzz on this place, but it was impressive because it was past 11pm and also 35 degrees out. I think we stood for maybe 20 minutes. Our cashier was super friendly and helped pick out a dozen. Price for a dozen ranges, and depends on whether you go for a classic dozen (I'm guessing regular doughnuts, none of the fancily decorated ones), or pick out your own. I ate four of them and then promptly wanted to die from the sugar rush. Doughnuts are definitely indulgent, dense and packed with sugar. My favorite was the one with crushed oreos and peanut butter drizzle. \\n\\nStill prefer Top Pot over Voodoo, but I love that Voodoo is open 24 hours. Only four stars however, because as nice as our cashier was, she forgot one bacon maple bar (we ordered two). So we received only 11 doughnuts despite paying for a dozen (and the bacon maple bar is $3 each!) In retrospect though, 11 was probably enough. \\n\\nPS.

Of course, I dislike waiting in lines (especially for brunch) as much as the next person.  But, let's face it: no matter where you go, you're bound to be in line for Sunday brunch.  And yes, this line is an hour long from the door...but at least it's inside?  Oh, right...and did I mention that the line actually does serve it's purpose?  You can always find an open seat to eat your made to order brunch.\\n\\nI'd say the food is worth it at least once.  The texas french toast is mile high.  Pile it high with fresh fruit, and you're set for the rest of the day.  The \\"homefries\\" are tater tots (yum!).  And get the turkey sausage early because I hear they tend to run out.\\n\\nA few things to know: the line is always long, so grab a cup of coffee and a friend (or book) to keep you company; don't go in large groups (two is a good number); make sure you don't bring much in with you--you'll need to carry your food to your seat (and step out of the way of the busboy every ten minutes); and...to avoid the line and the chaos...it seems that they do do take-out....\\n\\nBottom line: I think this is probably the cheapest brunch on Beacon Hill.

Very conveniently located to the AT & T Conference center at UT and the Doubletree on Lavaca for out of town visitors and a place where one can find parking for all localites!!.  This is a tiny bar which does a small menu and wood fired pizzas.\\n\\nOn a recent trip I walked into this place during lunch and found  this place pretty packed but magically a table opened up when I walked in.  I sat down ordered a drink and the pork and veal meatball appetizer and the salad special which was a fennel and frisee salad with roasted beets tossed in a roasted citrus vinegraitte.  The waiter was very friendly and asked me if I wanted everything at once or coursed out and I asked for it to be coursed out.  After a pleasant wait, the meatballs arrived.  There were 3 meatballs floating in a slightly thin arrabiata in a ceramic bowl with melted cheese no top. The meatballs were a little firm I thought but that worry was soon dispelled when I bit into them and found a very flavorful and tender mixture which had a mirepoix mixed in with the pork and veal. This was an excellent meatball where you could taste the pork and the veal added the necessary tenderness serving as a perfect foil for the slight acidy sweetness of the sauce which finished off with a gentle warming kick.  This is where the slightly thinner sauce paid off since it penetrated the meatballs adding to the flavor.  An excellent start to the meal.  When I finished this, I had another short pleasant wait and the salad was served.  \\n\\nI right away noticed that this was arugula and not frisee and was very very sparse on fennel.  But apart from that, this salad was done right.  This was a nice pile of absolutely perfectly dressed arugula, with toasted walnuts and beets interspread throughout the salad.  A perfectly composed bit combined the peppery arugula, sweet earthy beets and the vinnaigrette adding that touch of complex tartness to the bite with the finish of a crunchy toasted walnuts bringing it all together. \\n\\nThis place was so good that I stopped by later in the day and tried a pizza.  I asked them to make me a pizza that combined some of my favorite flavors and they gladly obliged.  Nobody writes about this pizza, but it was excellent.  The dough was obviously well fermented and the crust came out perfectly crispy yet slightly chewy with the toppings contributing well to the crust and making this a toothsome pizza.

America's oldest tavern 20 feet across the cobble stone ally isn't any better. The Bell In Hand has a dozen flat screens, all black decor and blasts out top 40 hits while the waitresses wear booty shorts.\\n\\nAnyway back to the Union Oyster House.....\\n\\nWe came with a large group of 8 and was told 30 min wait, an hour went by and I asked again and they said the table was being cleared, 30 min later I ask again and they say they mixed up tables so we waited a another hour and by this time it was 9:30 when we were seated. We had 2 small children who were asleep and our Grandma who was ready to kill. \\n\\nAfter the 2 1/2 hour wait we were seated right by the dish room where we heard ear piercing slamming of plates and glasses every 5 seconds ...but hey at least we heard reviews of the Lady Gaga album by the whole wait staff the whole time we were dinning with a special rendition of Poker Face by a waiter giving pelvic thrusts into our wall separating us from the dish room. \\n\\nNow to the food......\\n\\nWe all ordered something different and kept it seafood. The prices are high but it is in a tourist area and I figured...OLDEST RESTAURANT ????? IT MUST BE WORTH EVERY PENNY ....RIGHT ?\\n\\nWRONG\\n\\nThere was more lobster sticking to the shell tail than what was pulled out. It was so dry it almost sucked up half the butter in the bowl. My scallops that I asked to be braised were covered in bread crumbs and slopped up with tar tar sauce.......I ate one to amuse myself and it was so gummy and chewy it left a paste on the roof of my mouth. I sent it back and said \\"just throw these in the broiler with a little butter\\".......after a 45 MINUTE WAIT ON A RETURNED MEAL....which should have taken 5 minutes because by now it's 10:30 and we were almost the last table left in this DUMP.

Oh yes plus we recieved one round of water in the 2 hours we were there. We actually had grandma going to the wait staff area to fill up drinks.....one waitress said \\"thanks for the help, Granny\\"...we also got a round of beers 30 minutes after we ordered them and they were piss warm.\\n\\nBut I had to say something to the manager. In my 28 years of eating I have never once asked to speak to a manager at a restaurant and I had some less than desirable meals but this was the ABSOLUTE WORST DINNING EXPERIENCE OF MY ENTIRE LIFE.

He took off a gracious 5% of a bill that was $396....hahahahahahaha HAHAHAHAHAHA \\n\\nThis place is a joke and I have a feeling the owner passed it on to some idiot in the family and they have no idea was hospitality is let alone how to even prepare food.

The meats were kept very cold (mostly frozen, which is a good thing) at the food bar, which was kept very clean. The veggies seemed very fresh (minus the water chest nuts which were obviously canned). The spice/sauce bar was very clean and had all the things you would expect. They also had curry powder (use sparingly) and lemon pepper, Parmesan cheese packets, chili powder and some sort of fried spicy peanuts that were good. \\n\\nThe cook at the grill was the typical Hispanic fat guy that looked like a prior Mexican drug cartel thug that didn't speak much English and made you feel intimidated if you didn't leave a buck in his tip jar. Not really a friendly chap, but he did an acceptable job cooking the food and keeping the grill clean. The manager(s), all Asian of course, kind of just stood around gazing into the tables of people, pulling aside and criticizing the waitresses for who knows what... well, probably because the waitresses acted like they've never waited a table in their lives, and constantly pandered us needlessly to the point of annoyance, in an attempt to satisfy their Asian bosses vulture like gazes.  \\n\\nThe restaurant itself was very clean. Nice carpeting throughout, quaint detailing and decor on the walls, and they even have a big gong, that for reasons I don't know, an employee would smack every now and then.

We went semi-late on a Sunday night and the first clue should have been the long line and not very many people eating. The line was very slow because I think the workers are not properly trained or unmotivated to do things quickly. I ordered one chicken fajit burrito that was suppose to be naked. It wasn't so I mentioned it again, and she till insisted that it be in a tortilla. She asked me what beans I wanted and I said its a fajita aka. No beans. Then the burrito was passed on to the next guy who was having issues with the order before mine. Two guys were trying to wrap a large burrito and needed another tortilla. Then the other person had a salad and the guy was trying to top it with the sour cream and guac but the sour cream spilled over and the guac fell off. So that left a mess on the prep counter. Meanwhile the guy behind me needed a quesadilla for his child's kid meal so they were trying to get the extra tortilla, the quesadilla and my burrito done at the same time. The girl with the tortillas wasn't hearing they needed a tortilla until the cashier said it. Then the guy was having a hard time wrapping my normal burrito (would have been a lot easier if it was naked like it was suppose to be) and getting the quesadilla ready. I finally got to the cashier and he kept trying to give me the child's chips from the kid meal. I asked for a small drink and they were out of small lids so he gave me a large for the same price, which was fine. But when I got to the drink counter, two of the sodas were out of order and the area was not clean.  \\nAs I sat there eating, I watched as the line continued with only a few of us eating.

It's tucked back in an industrial area so you feel a little incredulous as you pull up the ramp for the free valet.\\n\\nThen you notice the cars. As we got out, there was a Hummer, an Audi and a gorgeous BMW roadster pulling in behind us. \\n\\nThe guests were as glittery as the vehicles. Long-legged debs with tiny purses and huge heels. Well-proportioned men in designer jeans and slick jackets over t-shirts that probably cost more than my mortgage. The dress is \\"smart casual\\" which means \\"you'd be smart not to dress too casual for dinner here.\\"\\n\\nWe walked through the door into a huge space, dimly lit with massive red fabric chandeliers and tiny gas lights quavering  enchantingly on the walls. A massive, ethereal mural of a girl with fish and tigers graces one wall but the back of the restaurant is an open air panorama of the high rises of Atlanta and the greenway.\\n\\nThere was an intimate bar area with a live jazz band, and set right in the center of the space, a secondary kitchen where you could watch chefs preparing meats and appetizers over huge flames. \\n\\nThe atmosphere was posh, modern and urban but not stuffy at all! It was quite crowded and loud with tons of people having a great night out. I don't do snooty and this place was upscale without attitude. \\n\\nAll the staff were lovely, from the hostesses who greeted us with \\"Happy Anniversary\\" to our charming and energetic waiter. \\n\\nAnd most importantly, the food was astonishingly good. We tried the salmon chips - cool and creamy - and the pimento cheese hush puppies - AMAZING! They had a spicy-sweet green chili compote on top that, combined with the salty cheese and crunch was perfection. \\n\\nI made the reservation because I heard the had the best brisket in Atlanta and I think it's true. My meat, a big ole' slab of it, was perfectly cooked and deliciously seasoned, incredibly tender... So good I was humming in happiness as I ate. \\n\\nMy husband had the steak with bleu cheese,medium rare, and it was cooked right and well seasoned too, but he said my brisket beat it and I agree. \\n\\nOur server brought us a free dessert because it was our anniversary, how sweet! It was a toffee, caramel, sea salt blondie with a touch of ice cream - dreamy. We could barely eat it by that point we were so full.\\n\\nIt was just what I was looking for, for a special night out - a unique experience, a delicious meal.

I had never been here before, and the environment is definitely startling. It's very dark on the inside, with huge red lamps hanging from the ceiling. It has an Asian/urban vibe for sure. \\n\\nWe started with the calamari. I don't usually order calamari, but my aunt wanted to try it, so why not? The calamari were very tender, though I wish the coating had been a bit crisper. It came with a sweet mayonnaise/aioli-type sauce. The menu says it's a wasabi cream but it was not spicy at all. \\n\\nFor mains, my aunt got the goat cheese ravioli, which comes with fennel, spinach, and cherry tomatoes, all in a pumpkin cream sauce. It's an appetizer portion, but turned out to be the perfect size since we were saving room for dessert. \\n\\nMy entree was also on the smaller side, but it was completely satisfying. I ordered the scallops, which game on a bed of smoked gouda grits with a tomato broth and pico de gallo. I really enjoyed the different textures. The scallops were perfectly cooked with a nice sear on the outside. The three scallops were the perfect portion, especially since the creamy grits were on the heavier side. I didn't detect a lot of smokiness in them, but I still cleaned my plate. The tomato contributions also complemented the rest of the dish, adding a necessary acidic element. \\n\\nWe were undecided about what to get for dessert so we just ended up ordering two. I was feeling very fall-y so opted for the pumpkin pie. It was actually a small tart. The accompanying cranberry sauce was absolutely wonderful and really made me long for Thanksgiving. While the flavors of the pie were definitely delicious, it was nothing truly special. Still, I'm glad I tried it, though it was definitely a large enough portion for two to share. \\n\\nMy aunt opted for the white chocolate bread pudding, which came with a cinnamon ice cream that she particularly enjoyed. \\n\\nAll in all, I really enjoyed my meal here. The food was solid and I'd like to return in the future to try some of the salads and other appetizer dishes.

The restaurant itself is tiny.  It can probably seat 15 people max, and I saw plenty of people coming in for takeout.  My staple Thai dish is always drunken noodle, so I had to try it here too.  It's one of the best drunken noodles I've had in a while!  Very flavorful and especially spicy!  I had to order a Thai iced tea to balance out the spice a bit.  The dish also comes with a variety of vegetables, including celery, which I don't see in most drunken noodle dishes at other Thai restaurants.  The spice level made me slow down more since I'm usually a quick eater!  For all their menu items, you can order the lunch or dinner portion.  Prices are extremely affordable.  My drunken noodle with chicken was only $7.50 for a very generous portion.  If I lived closer, I would definitely be back more often.

So savory, juicy and delicious while you wait on your ramen and the ramen came out just in time leaving me about 3 pieces to nibble on intermittent ramen chow.

In 25 years of eating at different Chinese establishments, I have never had a bad experience until this place. The outside is very welcoming, like the most normal places, but when you get inside, it's the complete opposite.  I thought there was a chance that I might walk out with one less kidney than I walked in with.  The lights were dim and flickering due to lack of maintenance and the six fish tanks that they had were absolutely atrocious.  They were full of rather large fish with no moving water or oxygenation, but I guess when you're going to be someone's food within the next few days you really don't need oxygen.  Now on to the staff.  When we got there the only person at the host stand was on the telephone and acted as if we were an inconvenience. She continued to call someone from the other room in Chinese to help.  He was so upset he had to leave his computer game.  He started taking our order. Oh....by the way, just disregard the menu because it's completely inaccurate. They no longer make half the stuff on the menu and the combos are completely wrong. Finally after about 8 tries and massive confusion due to the language barrier we got our order complete!!!!! I was excited.  Now came the wait for the food.  It wasn't horrible, but some things took absolutely too much time to make.  I thought they had to go butcher the chicken for the curried chicken I ordered.  Finally, food is here!!! Time to eat, Krab Rangoon was average, calamari - average, egg drop soup, you mean \\"cum drop soup\\" (picture to come). The egg drop soup was this pail white color and very frothy. I thought that egg drop soup was supposed to be yellow in color. It genuinely looked like sperm.  Needless to say no one touched it.  As far as the rest of the food, it was very below average. I can definitely see why the original location closed down and I definitely don't see this location being in business for very long. I believe the only way this food would be good is if you have never eaten anything in your entire life.  Make this place your last resort restaurant. Even better, spend the extra $10 a person, throw on a nice shirt and go to Benihana.

I'm in Portland chaperoning 12 high school kids at a high school event, including my son. He and 3 of his friends asked me to join them at the donut shop this morning, so this place was their find. It's in a dicey area of town with the Gospel Mission, Salvation Army and a marquis advertising \\"female impersonators\\" (as someone once said - \\"it's bad enough we have women in the world, why would ANYONE want to impersonate them?\\") all within a short shout.  Voodoo Donuts has a cool, unique vibe and really amazing looking, imaginitively-created donuts. Names such as \\"Mexican Hot Chocolate\\" and \\"The Loop\\" (as in covered with Kellogs Froot Loops) come to mind. Consistent with the voodoo and death imagery you'll see throughout the place (right down to the faux bone through the nose of the cashier) there is even one donut with a pentagram on it. It's a lot of fun and a lot of sugar and calories.  I ordered a \\"Portland Cream\\" which was basically a custard filled raised donut with (way too much) chocolate on top.  I've only eaten the one donut so I can't truly rate the place for taste on such a small sample size, but my early sense is that the vibe and presentation are amazing here, and the donuts in terms of taste are well above average but not dazzling or world class.

We invited some friends to join us and they experienced the Broder wait, and we were happy to enjoy the self serve coffee set outside on this brisk fall-feeling morning... it was extra strong and I was sufficiently over caffeinated by the time we were seated a half hour later (part of the long wait was due to there being 5 of us, groups of 2-3 seemed to be seated within 15-20 minutes).\\n\\nWe dined on meatball, ableskivers, and a variety of skillets.  The ableskivers are good, but sort of more of a novelty, and unless you require a sweet breakfast, I would strongly recommend the meatballs, a breakfast bord, or a hash... they are all divine, and also sort of a novelty also, especially the bord with all of its adorable little bowls and plates that I would hate to have to deal with washing myself.

I have only come to this place at night so I'm not sure how busy it is during the day but at night, no matter what day of the week you go, it is guaranteed to be kind of packed, which makes sense because they have bomb pizza. The inside of this place is pretty homey however it's kind of dark, again, it might be because I've only come at night, but I feel like I would definitely benefit from a few more lights. The outside deck/patio thing is pretty nice to chill or eat at. They have a ping pong table outside too which is pretty fun to take advantage of when you are waiting on your table. One thing about eating outside is you might see a few cockroaches but that's only because you're sitting outside, so it's nature, right?\\nThe only appetizers they offer are garlic knots or a salad? Salads are never fun so I ordered the garlic knots. These things are hit or miss. Some days I have come and they are delicately warm delicious knots that are super soft. Other days I have come and they are hard as a rock. I guess it just depends, I recommend ordering them, maybe you'll get lucky and catch them when they are good!\\nAlright so now off to the pizza. I wish Homeslice offered a Hawaiian pizza or pineapple as a topping! I feel like this is the ONE thing they are lacking to make them an A+ pizza joint. Other than that, I don't have much critique. Their pizza is pretty much always spot on.\\nLastly, when you dine in, they give you your receipt inside of a little cup with smarties. I love smarties so it just makes them that much better!

Hospitality aside, their cupcakes are fantastic. I don't have a sweet tooth much myself and can't stand overly sweet things but I happily devoured these desserts and at 11 am, no less.

I've only eaten one so far (that's about how much my sweet tooth can handle) and it was the Chocolate Champagne and it was artfully done.

I then chose the shellfish platter with the $20 up charge since she didn't provide any limitations. Well guess what, she realized she messed up again and came back to inform us that she would have to charge us the additional fee if we wanted that. We opted out and she said she would bring us something special. \\n\\nThen first course came out - a Thai coconut soup and a butternut squash soup. The bonus was another Thai coconut soup. Yipee! We were thinking this would be a bowl of soup. Nope this is literally smaller than a shot glass. Next time keep your something special! \\n\\nEverything was fine until the third course. My husband selected the steak as his entree. Well I never knew steak could take like fish. We never send food back but it was too terrible to even eat. We sent it back and got the lobster roll. The lobster rolls came and it was ok. She forgot the warm butter and at this point we didn't even want to bother. On the other hand, my swordfish was fine but didn't get my wine pairing until I was almost done with my main course. \\n\\nThe bill came and she still charged us for the steak and by this point we were over the whole experience.

I ended up eating just a plain shrimp cocktail. It wasn't anything special, but it was Glutenfree.  My colleagues ordered lots of great clam chowder (they loved it!), sweet potato fries, fish and chips, and many other typical pub-type foods. Someone was raving about the sweet potato waffle fries, so they must have been awesome. (They aren't Glutenfree, so I didn't get to indulge.).

It's great.\\n\\nBut, the real reason I am finally writing a review for this amazing little restaurant is their awesome sub sandwiches. For over a year now, I have been on search of that Northeast-style sub in Austin. In Rochester, NY we had this awesome sub chain called Dibella's. I never knew how much I would miss it until I came to Texas, where apparently most people think that Thunderbird's subs are the best thing on earth, with their old flavorless ingredients, chewy bread  (or is it hot dog buns?) out of a box, and otherwise complete lack of flavor.\\n\\nEnter Home Slice. In a way, I am bitter that I have not tried getting a sub at this pizza shop right down the street from me, oh, say, over a year ago. I'm even more upset that my roommate waited to tell me that he's been getting subs here for a long time, and that \\"they are the only thing close to East-coast subs. I don't go anywhere else anymore for sandwiches\\".\\n\\nI was excited to try them, and finally I did. A cheese sub. Dibella's had mastered the cheese sub by basically putting 6 layers of cheese on amazing bagel-crusted bread. Then the mustards, hot/sweet peppers, fresh lettuce. Yum. Homeslice has come in a close respectable second place. I'm not so sure they bake the bread on site, but it certainly tastes fresh and is nice, warm, and toasted. It has that similar delicious hard crust that seems so difficult to find here.\\n\\nThere may have been one or two fewer layers of cheese at Homeslice, but that's OK. Who needs a pound of cheese on a sandwich, really? At least Homeslice actually makes a meal out of it, though. Unlike Subway or Thunderclouds.\\n\\nMy only complaint is that they can get really busy for lunch, because it is a pretty small yet popular place. And, the sub was, I must admit, a bit too oily. It didn't stop me from devouring the whole thing though.

I don't frequent hotel restaurants unless I'm staying in them, and even then my desire to do so is lukewarm at best.\\n\\nMade reservations for a Wednesday after work, got there early so stopped in the hotel bar (Driftwood Room) for a drink.

That's probably why I like it ;) just kidding, just kidding.\\n\\nWe were seated promptly for our table of four and immediately ordered a bottle of wine.  We all pretty much knew what we wanted to order so after the wine came, we got down to business. (all ordered off the PDM menu)\\n\\nGorgonzola cheesecake - this was the best thing we got to eat at the table.  It could've been served with more bread, but who are we kidding, I would've eaten that shit slathered all over my big toe.\\n\\nDeviled egg trio - man, all 4 of us should've just ordered the gorgonzola cheesecake, but nooooooooo, we had to be different.  It's deviled eggs. That's all it is.  Just a little bit fancy, with crab on one and bacon on the other.

Gnocchi was ok, I ate most of that.\\n\\nPepper Crusted Double R Ranch NY Steak - see above, except instead of swine, it's bovine.\\n\\nSeared Ocean Scallops with Wild Mushroom Risotto - my friend said it was okay, but I caught that fishy aroma before it even came out the kitchen. I don't eat scallops but I know it's not supposed to smell like ... well, really fishy.\\n\\nChef's Risotto - Chef's whimsy daily - whew mama, this one was a doozy. I thought it was a mushroom risotto but not like the one that came with the scallops.  She took one bite and pushed it away.

We had a reservation, and we seated immediately. From the outside, the place looks questionable (Ball Square is a little dodgy), and the BF was concerned when we saw the take-out entrance first, but once we got into the dining room, we were impressed. It was clean, and comfortable, and appropriately lit (i.e. not so dark I couldn't see, but not so bright as to ruin the mood). \\n\\nWe ordered a bottle of of pinot grigio for just over $20. Very nice for the price. We started with the arancini, which were HUGE and delicious. And super cheap at $6. \\n\\nFor our entrees we both ordered pasta with seafood (which this place seems to be known for). Mine had lobster, shrimp and scallops, the BF's had clams, muscles, shrimp and calamari. Both entrees were about $20. Very reasonably priced considering the enormous amount of seafood on each plate. You can get the pasta with either a red sauce (marinara) or a white (white wine and garlic) and you can order either regular or spicy. We both got the white, I went mild, the BF spicy. His was loaded with hot peppers, and packed quite a bit of heat, but he loved it. The only thing that would have improved my dish was some grated parm, which wasn't offered, but I noticed after that the table next to us had asked for some, and a cute dish was brought to their table. Noted for future reference. \\n\\nFor dessert we ordered the special, which was basically a ball of ice cream covered in a chocolate shell, cut into quarters, covered in chocolate sauce and garnished with strawberries. Amazeballs. \\n\\nThe bar was pretty hopping, the drink menu was interesting, and impressive-looking cocktails were being delivered all over the dining room, so I ordered an espresso martini with dessert (not on the drink menu). It was *sensational*. Honestly one of the best I've ever had (and I've had more than a few). \\n\\nOur waiter was pleasant and attentive (though not *too* atttentive) and very knowledgeable. And he didn't even blink when I asked if they could make an espresso martini (which was not on their extensive drink menu). Only downside was that he absolutely grilled my ID and asked me to smile like I am in my license picture (which is about 7 years old). I'm almost 30, so I don't expect to get the 3rd degree when I order an adult beverage.\\n\\nOverall, it was a great experience. We weren't rushed, the food was very good, and even without the coupon everything was reasonably priced. If I lived in the neighborhood, I'd probably make the bar a regular stop for cocktails and apps. As it is, the BF and I will have to plan a return visit soon."},{"name":"Poor Calvin's","address":"510 Piedmont Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4.5","text":"New spot near the FOX theatre.  \\n\\nHad the Mahi Mahi & my partner had the scallops.

The only saving grace was the bread putting that was amazing!!! And after having a mediocre meal very surprising.

Not even with out-of-towners (which this place must rely on to stay in business, since actual Portlanders seem to avoid it).  The food and beer are mediocre.  This is the Starbucks of beer in this town.  And the service is spotty at best.  We hadn't been here in a year or so, so we decided to go back and get some pizza.  We sat in the Boiler Bar, which is new enough that it hasn't yet developed the disgusting smell of the main restaurant.  The pizza was lovely.  The server was distracted, but friendly enough.  And I've always liked the idea of rescuing a unique looking elementary school and filling it with quirky art.  However, the uniqueness has worn off.  It would be great if they actually cleaned this place once in a while.  The carpet in the main restaurant is so dark and black with muck it looks like its never been cleaned EVER.  And that is perhaps why the whole place smells like rotten food, spoiled beer, and vomit.  The smell is enough to turn your stomach.  Disappointed that the place STILL hadn't cleaned up, we decided to eat in the Boiler Bar.  I do like the steam punk style they have in that section.  \\n\\nWe ordered pints.  I expected a full pint size glass, like they had on our previous visits.  We received what seemed to be slightly more than what would normally be called a \\"glass\\" of beer.  They charged $4.90 each for these glasses.  Okay, I don't mind the price, IF I GET A WHOLE PINT.  And seriously, for the PBR of Portland, you're charging $4.90 A GLASS!  I also noticed that what I once loved about their Hammerhead also tasted watered down.  \\n\\nThen I looked at what they charged for extra olives, which by the way, I have always asked for when eating here and always received at no extra charge.  In this case, they added $3.  THREE DOLLARS FOR EXTRA OLIVES ON A PERSONAL SIZE PIZZA!!!  Are you f**king kidding me?!  Fifty cents would be okay, but even pizza places only charge $1.50 for an extra topping on a large pizza.  \\n\\nSo they must have decided to CUT CORNERS AND OVERCHARGE in these hard economic times.  DO NOT GO!  If out of towners are curious, take a walk through, but definitely eat somewhere else, there are plenty of nice places only a few blocks away, even some that have much nicer microbrews if that's what you're after."},{"name":"Pita Grille","address":"4630 Wieuca Rd","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3.5","text":"Over priced.

However, I have to knock down a few stars for the extremely rude host staff.  Went here yesterday (01/06) around 11:30 and the place was maybe about 20% capacity.  We were waiting on a 3rd to arrive, and the hostess was quick to tell us they don't seat incomplete parties.  This is fine because I knew that already.  She said we could order drinks and go sit outside in the designated area (though the bar had only 4 people sitting at it). \\n\\nWasn't exactly comfortable weather to be outside but it was apparently very important to her to enforce the policy here.  Proceeded with my friend to grab a drink at the bar with intention of heading out.  Because we were seated and not standing at the end of the bar (per policy???), she came up to me and gave me a scolding that I should not be sitting down.  I explained to her that we were just ordering drinks and would be certain to skedaddle outside like we were told we had to do and that we were oh so very sorry that we didn't stand at the end of a nearly empty bar at the designated area and had the audacity to take a seat while we ordered drinks.  (The bartenders were great, by the way, and had no issue with us.)\\n\\nBeing treated like this makes me wonder if I even want to return here.  The managers need to seriously give their host staff a lesson in customer service.  Even if I had violated this very important policy, common sense would have told you that it wasn't a big deal for me to sit down for 3 or 4 minutes at an empty bar to wait on my drink order.  Me thinks it's the classic case of someone with little authority to begin with getting pleasure out of enforcing what they can.

I would suggest getting your morning doughnuts the night before in off hours or you will be waiting in a line around the corner. They are open 24 hours a day so pick a good late night time for your quick stop in.\\n\\nWe saw quite a few people walking out with full dozen boxes so clearly this was the right thought. Our tour guide suggested that the lines were the reason the immediate traffic lane next to the building was permanently roped off to auto traffic to accommodate the lines. There was also a security officer quietly hanging around the area so it seems well monitored and safe even though there is a huge transient population that hangs around the area. \\n\\nOut of the mixed box we got we tried the Grape Ape and The Loop doughnuts. The Loop was a fruit loop covered doughnut that was quite good but I have to say the unique flavor of the Grape Ape was the kicker for us.

I also had a softshell crab appetizer, which was very good.  They seem to be well-known for their brussels sprouts, which were a generous portion for 1 person.

With the prospect of heaps of fresh fruit over the fluffiest/crispiest waffle with a side of orange juice, I got my sorry butt out of bed at 6:45 in the morning! \\n\\nIt was a whole new experience going on a Friday morning before work. I had always braved the crowds on weekend \\"mornings\\" - never arriving early enough and always crowding in the line that weaves back and forth and right out the door. You end up getting way friendlier with Bostonians and tourists alike as you all crowd together in the line.  Meanwhile, seasoned Paramounters assure their newbie friends \\"don't worry, we will get a seat, really, we will...\\" And by the time your veggie-rich omelet with a side of perfectly seasoned salty potatoes is ready, magically a table of the perfect size will be just opening up. I swear, it works every time. It's magic. The federal government should study the Paramount, no doubt there's all sorts of usefulness that can be gained from studying the Paramount's magic seating. \\n\\nAnd this Friday morning, I was in awe - it took waking up at 6:45 and getting to the Paramount on a weekday morning when only MGH doctors and avid joggers were awake, but I found something I didn't think was possible - no line!!! I didn't believe it at first. Were we at the right place?? But suspending my disbelief, I walked right up to the front of the line (or where I thought it would be - without the crush of people, I wasn't even sure anymore...) and I was speechless. Without the 45 min wait in line, I didn't have time to make up my mind on what to order and change it and change it again. But safe in knowing that I've never ordered anything that wasn't amazing, I settled on a waffle with a massive pile of fruit and a side of bacon.

The available flavors are displayed in large rotating cases, providing a whimsical browsing experience. \\n\\nRegardless of their 24/7 hours, Voodoo is a busy place that nearly always has a line. I typically come here late at night and have never waited more than 20 minutes, but apparently mornings and weekends can be extremely hectic, so plan accordingly. \\n\\nWhile I have enjoyed every vegan donut that I've tried from here, my favorites are the vegan Voodoo doll, and any variation of their chocolate cake donut. The cute voodoo doll shaped donut is a classic vanilla raised filled with strawberry jelly, and topped with a rich chocolate ganache icing.

But sadly, right when we got in and sat down, they didn't even bothered to give us a menu. We sat there for several minutes, but still no menu from anyone, not even that waitress bothered to come back with any. I'm sorry but you have no excuse to mess that up. And get this, this actually happened when the restaurant was almost emptied..... yes folks, almost emptied..... at 1:30pm, when it was still considered lunch time for most people. Yet they messed up something as simple as bringing us the menu right away.\\n\\nAnyways, the food came in a relatively decent amount of time, the food was okay enough, and the prices was fair. Though I do have to mention that I had the Marinated sliced beef short rib and while it is decent, but a few of the pieces was half burnt and while there was suppose to be 3 strips which would make it 9 pieces, but I only gotten 8 pieces.

I will Yelp about one of my favorite restaurants in Boston, the Top of the Hub.\\n\\nA most wonderful place for a great dinner and a very popular tourist trap. The Top of the Hub is on the 52nd floor of the Prudential Center with breathtaking views of Boston, Cambridge, Somerville, Charlestown, Charles River & Bridges, the North Shore, Boston Harbor, and various Bohemian places in between. On a clear day, parts of Newton to the west and North Quincy way past the \\"gas tank\\" to the south can be seen. This is the perfect place for those special occasions such as romantic dinners, celebrations, or important business meetings. The menu here is very pricey, but this is one of those rare places that the food, the service and the atmosphere is worth paying for. I highly recommend making reservations unless you're just having for a few cocktails from the bar.\\n\\nI dined here a while back with a business associate and made a dinner reservation for 7:30 PM to avoid the peak dinner crowds. \\"Level 52 please!!!\\" \\n\\nWe were seated by a window with a spectacular view overlooking Downtown Boston, WICKED COOL!!! It felt like we were literally on \\"top of the hub\\" although the John Hancock Tower is technically the tallest building in Boston. Light jazz music was playing in the background. We ordered from the Chef's Tasting Menu (prix fixe) minus the wine pairings since we decided on cocktails instead. The portions for each course were small and very nicely plated. We had samplings of Foie Gras, Lobster & Avocado Citrus Salad, Pan Seared Sea Scallops, Rare Tuna, Beef Tenderloin, & dessert sampler (bite size). All of the food was very interesting and delicious. I think even my sister, a chef in NYC, would be very impressed.\\n\\nThe service here was stellar, attentive, and very professional. The pace of the meal was slow, but that's great so we could take in the views of the bright city lights and watch the planes takeoff and land at Logan. Our diligent waiter explained each course to us, described the food, kept our water glasses full, and kept the booze comin'. The best part was that my company picked up the tab for the $300 meal, much of it was booze. Drunky McDrunkerson has left the building!!\\n\\nI can't wait to have dinner at the Top of the Hub again.

Here is the description on their menu: Turkey Dagwood-slow-roasted breast of turkey, sliced thin & piled high gh, \\"Dagwood Style\\" with cheddar, lettuce, tomato & cranberry preserve mayonnaise on toasted country bread. Nothing was piled high at all, I believe that there was no more than one slice of each item on the sandwich and even with the salad that came with it, it was hardly worth $8.00. Other members of my party had \\"The Famous Roast Beef Sandwich\\", which turned out to be another disspointment. The sandwich was served cold (which is not mentioned on the menu) and was no larger than the Turkey Dagwood. Others got \\"Dave's Chicken Train Wreck\\" which received a more positive review.

I doubt you'll leave El Potro thinking it's the greatest Mexican food you've ever tasted, but I do think you'll enjoy the food and find it to be a good value for the price point."},{"name":"McDonald's","address":"290 Worcester Rd","city":"Natick","stars":"2.5","text":"I occasionally go to McDonald's because it is on the way home.

My only complaint with my experience was the amount of shrimp they included on the sandwich. For the price, there were very few shrimp. However the shrimp were excellent -- very lightly battered as opposed to a heavy batter a lot of places do. For my side I chose the Poblano Cheese Grits which were excellent. And Key Lime Pie which was fresh and very good.

Not much meat and the toppings didn't taste very good, especially the onions.

Even the stale and slightly tobacco aroma in the halls sets a special mood and tone that is unique. \\n\\nThe grounds are beautiful. The rooms are modest and lack the conveniences of a modern hotel, which is as it should be here. The lack of room TVs and minibars help play into the theme of days past, where you would get your hand slapped by the principal for even considering such things appropriate in an institution of learning. \\n\\nThe gift shop is awesome.

Not a bad place. I am always looking for those holes in the wall, and this is one of those gems. It is hard to get a place like this considering that everything around the Gahanna-New Albany area has popped up out of no where in the last decade, so finding a place that is not brand new and with a little character is nice. You walk in and it is a half hearted attempt at being an Irish pub but it works! Not to say they didnt do a good job but it it could have been anything, they went with an Irish theme. I noticed they recently got new tv's behind the bar which are very nice. It is one of those unique spaces where you dont feel too crammed even when it is packed, but at the same time even when it is dead, it still feels cozy and not cold. That's for the winter months.\\n\\nFor the spring and summer, this place has a rockin patio. The first time i showed up here was in the summer and i bypassed the whole inside and went around back. They have a full service bar and plenty of space. They had a performer Cliff Cody, great choice for this atmosphere. He was up there singing acoustically with a Bob Seger-esque voice. Everyone was tuned in and dancing or at least bobbing their heads, even the group of Golden Buckeye members that commandeered a  spot right up front were loving the music. I didnt mention this earlier but this place is also a place where you find it all. Something about it where you could have a staff of Abercrombie and Fitchers having a happy hour behind you, a couple of construction workers having a after work drink next to you, the local who hasnt left his post at the corner of the bar, a couple resembling my parents on the other side. This place makes every one feel right at home.\\n\\nAs for the food. Typical bar food. Pizzas are really good. Rest of the food, hit or miss i would say. But the real gem and i dont think many people know about this is the breakfast! No to many places are out there that do it all but this place does. If you love the Flanagans on Sawmill, this might not be the place for you.

Prior to this visit, I'd never even heard of Leaf. After this experience, I can't wait to return. From their abbreviated Happy Hour menu, my friend and I had three vegan items- a raw wrap, a seaweed fusion salad, and a raw Pad Thai dish. They were each $4.50, were good sized portions for the price, and were served up very quickly. \\nThe first dish we divided was the wrap. I thought I could stop right there and just order ten more of those. (Not all for today, of course.) Next we had the Pad Thai, which was on a par with the freshness and flavors of the wrap. Feeling pretty satisfied already, we split up the Asian seaweed salad and again had that same rush of flavor and healthfulness that greeted the palate upon first tasting the other two dishes. \\nIn the meantime, I kept ordering take-out orders of each dish as we tried them. I just knew I needed to have them again before I left Colorado. \\nAlthough we weren't in the mood for dessert, a quick glance at the dessert menu revealed a very appealing raw vegan chocolate mousse.

They use to have a great coconut shrimp appetizer, but it's no longer :( Got a side order of fries, they were cold and thin, looked like McDonald's fries, wasn't a fan of the fries. Grilled chicken Caesar salad was NOTHING to write home about, I literally had to \\"look\\" for the chicken. Only about 4 pieces about the size of my thumb, very disappointed since I'm eating healthy and making better choices I was hoping for more chicken. I asked for very little to none dressing, so they got that right. Place was buzzing with people, manager walking around stopping at tables to see if everything is \\"ok\\". Thought that was nice. But I probably wouldn't go back to eat there, but for a cocktail yes. No screaming kids, which is ALWAYS a bonus!!!!!!!!

It would be considerably faster to get here with a taxi but I had time to burn and I'm a cheapskate.  \\n\\nThe bus let me off literally in front of the school.  I was still two hours too early for check in but the nice gentlemen at the desk was still able to set me up with a room adjacent to the front desk (Jack's Room).

I saw the soaking pool and cursed myself when I forgot to bring my swim trunks.  If I was bored enough, I told myself I would just enter with my shorts.

I ran into a herd of tourists that were receiving an official tour of the school.

One of the bartenders and I had a conversation about Portland and the various oddities of the city.  I had pints of all the beers on tap.  They were all largely forgettable except for their Imperial IPA which I thought was really unbalanced.  It had an extreme hoppiness that was not balanced out by any malty backbone whatsoever.   I had the hummus, pita, and vegetables platter which was a nice snack.\\n\\nSometime during my stay at the Boiler Room, one of the bartenders cut me off saying I had too much to drink.  At the time, I was moderately pissed off about that.  However, in retrospect, she was right so I won't hold that against McMenamins.\\n\\nI then went to the Honors Bar which was a nice, intimate space with interesting decor.  The smallness of it helped spark conversation with random people (either that or the booze did the talking).  \\n\\nNext, was the cinema which was showing second run films.  I got into the theater for free since I was a guest of the hotel.  The theater was quite full as we watched \\"The Heat\\".  It was a jovial atmosphere and everyone seemed to have a good time watching the comedy.  The chairs were quite large and comfortable in the theater.  \\n\\nAfterwards, I went back to my room to rest my eyes so I can visit the Cypress Bar and The Detention Room later that night.\\n\\nZzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz....\\n\\nThe next thing I knew, it was morning and time to check out!\\n\\nI grabbed breakfast (a Greek omelette) at the Courtyard Restaurant.  The omelette tasted good but was a little too small for a breakfast dish.  Next, it was back to the room to grab my bag, check out, and off to the rest of my Portland adventure.\\n\\nI recommend Kennedy School as a great place to spend your first day in Portland.

We had no problem waiting for a table (we expect this without a reservation), so we put our name on the list and went to the bar to get a drink.  It took the bartender over ten minutes to get to us, and another ten minutes to deliver our drinks.  Once we were seated, we sat there for over twenty minutes before we were acknowledged.  If we didn't have full drinks from the bar, we would have walked out.  When our waiter finally came over, we ordered more drinks, an appetizer and a pizza to share.  The appetizer came out fairly quickly and was delicious, but the drinks we ordered took longer than the appetizer!  Finally our drinks arrived, and a little later, our pizza arrived.  It was not the pizza we ordered.  But at this point, we were ready for this whole experience to be over so we decided to just eat what we were given.  The pizza was fantastic!  However, the service was so poor that it ruined our meal.  Our particular server was constantly flustered and seemed confused, and while I'd like to blame the poor service on the fact that maybe he was \\"new\\", after reading other reviews, it seems to just be the usual for this restaurant.

My mother had Salade De Roquette which was delicious, but the same can't be said for the soup she ordered which was watery and tasted too much like Dill! My father had Sea Salt-Cured Salmon which he enjoyed whole heartedly. Our server (who was a white male with black hair and a beard) was very inattentive. (This is the same man who \\"greeted\\" us and who we saw smoking outside as we left.) He was more interested in playing around with his friends/fellow servers in the back then waiting on us. And he even forgot one of our desserts because he wasn't paying attention! I was also very disappointed because another group was there to celebrate a birthday as well, and they received an entire small cake and he sang happy birthday with the table. When we told him it was my birthday he simply brought out a slice of cake, small scoop of ice cream, small container of chocolate moose, and fruit. And he did not sing. I'm not asking for much, just to be treated equally. (And before anyone asks, their table size was the same as ours and if the cake costed more or took longer to make we would have been happy to pay for it and wait.)

So I have to give these guys some credit for being able to handle the kind of drunken abuse they did, and maybe that is why some people don't like it here, its NOT a nice sit down dinner kinda place, its more of a muscle your way to the bar and take over for a short notice event.

The food had been wonderful and the service exceptional. We had both taken the day off work and to celebrate, we decided to go to Folk Art for lunch. We had a very different experience. The lamb chop steak was mostly chop as it had very little meat in it and was mostly forgettable. My partner's pork chops were very small, though tender, but nothing special. The sides were small but good. The server was just short of surely. Having spent a large portion of my adult life working in F&B/hospitality, I find it unconscionable for a restauranteur to allow a server to put the check on the table before the plates have even been cleared, much less without asking if we want anything else, I would have ordered something additional as the lunch was small and I was still hungry, That option was never presented. With tip, the lunch came to $42 and was nowhere near worth it. Given we had previously had such a wonderful brunch experience, today's experience is really disheartening.

No, I'm not kidding. There was this scene with witches eating worm sandwiches. Twenty five years later I can eat the occasional hot dog but bologna is still a no go. \\n\\nWhen I lived in Providence, RI there was a Spike's just down the street from my apartment. I never ate hot dogs there, always opting for the amazing Chicken Ranger sandwich (BBQ sauce, bacon and cheese). I knew someone who was on the wall for consuming thirteen hot dogs in one sitting, I took his word that these were tasty hot dogs. \\n\\nI found myself with a group at Spike's last weekend, and I almost ordered the Chicken Ranger but in the interest of a better Yelp I opted for a German Shepherd (Spike's mustard and sauerkraut) with onions. I also shared an order of junkyard fries. \\n\\nToppings are a personal preference issue so let's talk about the main event. If I can't have a Coney Island dog from Worcester, MA or a Rhode Island wiener (not exactly a hot dog and possibly not legal everywhere) then this is my next choice. Spike's hot dogs look and taste like they are not a hodge podge of meat waste materials stuffed into a slick, taut casing; call it magic, call it willing suspension of disbelief, call it a notch above your average mystery meat log. \\n\\nSo why no five stars did you ask? Three reasons, some fairer than others; one, I'm not allowing my first five star review to be about f*cking hot dogs, two, the rolls are great but too big for a normal sized mouth and three, toppings placement needs work. Just about everyone orders at least two toppings. The preparer ought to put one under and one over the dog...that way you don't get the all toppings bite followed by the all meat bite when you are forced to eat this massive torpedo elevator style. Oh and don't order plain fries, they are not all that curly nor very seasoned, but all that takes a backseat when there is chili and melted cheese to save the day."},{"name":"Mary Mac's Tea Room","address":"224 Ponce De Leon Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"the fact that mary mac's is so well rated is proof that atlantans have no idea what being good at anything entails ... including college football, the dirty birds or just good eating ... ouch.\\n\\nthis place was so forgettable that i don't even remember what i ordered. prob meatloaf, and mac & cheese. it was just so bland, no flavor or character. this place should just be named tourist trap. i'm so sorry i insisted my local friend take me here. pricey for comfort food, too.  this place might be more appropriate for sunday brunch then dinner. i am so done with dining in ATL after this. maybe all the dining in ATL sucks because ATL is the only city which has waffle houses in the city limits (saving grace)."},{"name":"Frank","address":"407 Colorado St","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Frank is a charming place that has a lot going for it, despite a few kinks.

Starting with drinks, the Frank Old Fashioned and Pear and Apple Mimosas were more ordinary than their descriptions however the Red Headed Stranger was serious. Garnished with a cube of cheddar cheese, olive and jalapeno and a salted and peppered rim, this drink was an impressive interpretation of the same old brunch Bloody Marry,  And with a half-pint chaser of Pearl it was a hit at our table.\\n\\nHighlights - the chicken and waffles were well prepared and flavorful, the flight of sausage (yes, a flight)  were very nice, but with 4 different patties the flavors started to meld together after a while. The shrimp and grits were very nice with above average execution on the shrimp. Topped off with great, prompt service, a DJ and a downtown Austin vibe the experience was memorable.\\n\\nLow-Lights - The Texas Benedict seemed to be an afterthought (or forced necessity) on the menu with not nearly as much attention to creativity as he rest of the offerings. We are in Texas! ...and the pulled pork lacked flavor and was dry. The jalapeno hollandaise seemed to be the most promising but again no flavor and was served almost baked on the plate.  Eggs were over cooked and were promptly replaced with under cooked ones. I know they are just eggs, but 6 eggs wasted because of sloppy preparation made me sad.\\n\\nSummary - great menu, great experience, great service, great food BUT some simple execution errors and lack of quality control on some of the items left a bad taste in our mouths. We will go back though to give it another shot."},{"name":"Andina Restaurant","address":"1314 NW Glisan St","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"Tasty foods with unique spices . Service was good.

In short, I'm willing to overlook a lot of flaws during this \\"soft opening\\" but there are things going on that should not be when an owner has this kind of previous restaurant experience. Maybe they opened too soon? Dinner service only at this point. Lunch service starts in a few weeks. Clearly, they're not ready. Hopefully by the spring things will be ironed out.\\n\\nThe Good: The 15 minute wait for a table and the 10 minute wait for our food after ordering were both just right for a weeknight at 6pm. No issues. Lovers of bbq can be very picky when it comes to good food, and the pulled pork here gets a \\"just fine\\" rating, not bad, but not great. The ribs were great. The brisket was close to great, but just so-so as probably 40% of my serving was fat. Some eat it, I don't, so that was disappointing. The non-fatty pieces were fantastic. It's hard to beat finely sliced brisket, and this was cubed like beef in a stew. Different, but good. Sides were ho-hum. Fries are not worth ordering. The baked beans were good. The apple infused slaw got a good review. I would like to see Brunswick stew as a side, not a standalone pricey appetizer. And the texas toast was pretty wimpy. A good bbq joint needs some good cornbread or hushpuppies to accompany a plate. In sum, the food was pretty good if not a little overpriced. I'm not sure the two of us got $45 worth of food, but that's what the ribs/brisket plate and a pork sandwich ran. No alcohol. The menu is huge, so I look forward to trying many other options in the future.\\n\\nThe Bad: I don't want to be too harsh so I'll try to keep this succinct. Service was \\"mixed\\". You can be as nice and polite as possible, but when you promise to come back and don't, for a refill, for an extra plate, for the check, for a doggie bag...it got frustrating. The ribs were so good I couldn't finish the brisket so I wanted to take it home. The promised to-go box never came. Finally, the check came.  Then, finally, the correct check came. And then my plate was whisked away so quickly I couldn't stop it from happening. My brisket was gone forever. The main issue: probably 40 minutes elapsed from the time we finished eating to the time we left. That's a lot of waiting on the back end with nothing else going on... not a refill, not an offer of dessert, I could have just walked out I guess, but I did want to pay.  \\n\\nThe Bottom Line: A ton of fair to good to great bbq joints have opened in recent years around Atlanta to accompany the few great ones that have stood the test of time. I'm not going to write off The Craft Hog just yet but it could have been an immediate destination restaurant, and it's just not. The menu looked good enough that I want to go back and try various meats and sides. But it really just made me want to go to Old South right down the street. It's been there almost 50 years for good reason. Ebony and Ivory is not going to lose much business either as it stands today. Heck, I'd drive 25 minutes into town to go back to Smoke Ring any day or to Austell to Wallace's. Where's the smell, Crafty Hog? I good bbq joint can be sensed from down the street. There's just something lacking at this point. I'll give them another chance. The bar area looks good. Tons of TVs throughout. A back room (adults only/smoking/music venue I assume) is in the works. Again, lots of potential. They need to get their act together."},{"name":"Bouldin Creek Cafe","address":"1900 S 1st St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"BBQ Caveman Me no like this place.\\n\\nHealthy Fuel Exercise Me dug the Tofu Broccoli Salad, w/ Hibiscus Tea.\\n\\nService is relaxed and you should be too."},{"name":"Scales 925","address":"30 Ivan Allen Blvd, Ste 125","city":"Atlanta","stars":"2.5","text":"Food was amazing !

Never really impressed with food or beer list but they do have a ok set-up for sports watching if you can't find somewhere better. However, the service is far below average nearly every time and is the major reason to think twise about going here. Took a friend there for the 1st time during the Killingsworth street fair. The fair had a coupon to try out this place so we decided to give it a go. Our waiter, although he took the coupon, clearly didn't approve of the fact we had one for some reason. He took the coupons and actually wound up taking the entire pamphlet that contained said coupon. Maybe an oversight you might think. Well, he never returned so I noticed a pile of pamphlets in the bar and grabbed a few. When our items arrived he noticed the new pamphlets and says \\"oh no, you only get to use them once\\" and took them away quickly. Well yeah, I understand that concept just fine and had no intention of using it twice somehow but you guys were not the only ones in the packet with discounts and there was plenty of additional valuable information included. If you don't want to do a discount then don't put it out there. Bottom line, my friend who was trying it for the 1st time felt as though we were made to not feel welcome and he will not be returning and I doubt I will ever be giving it another try.\\n\\nBtw, don't order the hummus app. It had a normal amount of pita with just a couple celery and a couple carrots and then what amounted to about 2 tablespoon of hummus.

This restaurant did not disappoint!  Both vegan and vegetarian options were offered, which is rare at a BBQ restaurant.  One pro of this restaurant was that the menu organized the sides into the following categories: meaty, vegetarian, and vegan.  This was helpful because, in the south, steamed greens for example, aren't always vegetarian.  We decided to try the smoked BBQ tofu (vegan) with a side of the kale (vegan).  We also chose to do the vegetable combo (3 sides): hushpuppies, cole slaw, and the cheddar and smoked gouda mac & cheese (all vegetarian).  Steve and I shared everything, as we wanted to try as much variety as we could from the menu.\\n\\nOur lunch was delicious.  The BBQ sauce was amazing, not too sweet and not too smokey.  We dipped the hushpuppies in it, the sauce was that good!  We added the cole slaw to the sandwich which gave it a nice crunchy texture.  I don't eat Mac & Cheese often, but this was melt in your mouth goodness.  Everything was wonderful, but I have to admit, that as tasty as the sandwich was, I thought the tofu wasn't all cooked the same.  Some tasted a little more over done to me.  I would still recommend this place.  It doesn't look like much from the outside, and it is a little outside Atlanta, but both Steve and I felt it was worth the trip.

I had been following an Instagram food blog about Disney food options and the one day it was all about burger ratings at the parks.  The Backlot Express burger ranked very high for that specific blogger so I decided to add this place on my favorites list on My Disney Experience app so I would remember.  \\n\\nIt can be difficult to find because well, its in the backlot area :).  The food service area is tucked away on the inside part so you need to walk down a few stairs to get to it.  Anyway, there is plenty of seating both outdoors and indoors.  And some of the outdoor seating areas have a great view of the Star Wars attraction where Darth Vador and Kylo Ren test out young jedi training techniques (kid volunteers).  \\n\\nI had the Angus Bacon Cheeseburger while my fiance was bold and had the Royal Guard Burger.  Both VERY good!!! Do not be alarmed by the black bun on the Royal Guard Burger it was still very tasty and great consistency.  Plenty of fries (which were also really good), and it was nice that they gave you giant cups you could fill up yourself.\\n\\nWe ended our quick-service lunch with a Darth Vador chocolate peanut butter cupcake and a chocolate mousse.  Both surprising delicious considering this was just a quick-service facility.  I will say like most of the eateries in any Disney park that the food is probably very overpriced, however you get an extreme quantity of food so at least that is not lacking for paying so much.  And I was on the Disney Dining plan so the price did not really affect me so I did not need to pay attention.\\n\\nWould definitely recommend this place for a burger!"},{"name":"Super Mini Walnut Cafe","address":"2770 Arapahoe Rd, Ste 116","city":"Lafayette","stars":"4","text":"BEST Local Breakfast/Brunch/Lunch - EVER!\\nSo many healthy choices and options for Gluten Free and Vegetarian (Vegan, too!) but you can go for the pancake/waffle/bread routes if you prefer!\\nAnd the service is BAR NONE!

My friends and I agreed they were the best yucca fries we've ever had.  Also, the signature drinks were to die for, make sure you get one to start off the night.  Only 2 negatives, one, I think the pulpo is overpriced for what you get, and 2, it was so busy the night we were there, that the kitchen got DEEP in the weeds, and what should have been a 2 hour dinner, ended up being 3 hours.

This Grindhouse Killer is located off of Piedomont Ave across the street from Fat Matts ( another fantastic restaurant). \\n\\nMy fianc√© and I continue to rave about how fantastic the burgers, fries, and shakes are here. We have been here numerous times and have yet to be disappointed. Just make sure that you do not confuse this location with the one off of Edgewood. The one off of Edgewood is a sort of pop-up store located within a market with poor quality food, little to no staff, and a long as heck wait time for your food. ... But I digress... now back to reviewing the good Grindhouse. \\n\\nI usually go with the single size Grindhouse burger and make it a combo with fries and a drink for a total of about $10. They are pretty generous with the fries so I would only recommend the double if you are super hungry. The fries are crinkle cut and cooked to crispy perfection with just the right amount of salt to season them. The burger... oh man this burger is heaven between two toasty buns. It has gooey American cheese with caramelized onions, lettuce, Grindhouse sauce, and pickles( I decided to not get pickles on mine this time though). If you have ever had fry sauce before( all my northerners know what I'm talking about!) then the Grindhouse sauce is a version of this. It's sweet but also tangy so make sure you get a few sides of it to dip your fries in! I always ask for two sides of the sauce but make sure that they only charge you the 50 cents for 1 side of sauce because the first is supposed to be free. Don't let them hustle ya out of that 50 cents y'all! \\n\\nMy fianc√© and I together have probably tried about half of the burgers on the menu and have not been disappointed. They have fabulous onion rings and shakes as well. The cookies and cream shake was very satisfying. Creamy and thick just the way it should be. They also have a really nice selection of beer and hard core liquor if you're feeling adventurous. \\n\\nThe customer service is great as well. I have always had fantastic customer service and great conversations with the people that take my order and bring the food to the table. They also make really good suggestions if you can't decide what to get from their phenomenal menu. \\n\\nThe only real downside is that the parking here is a nightmare. There are about 10 parking spots total in this complex so don't be surprised if you end up parking on the street. This place is usually packed during lunch so there are a lot of signs saying you can't park on the side of the road. My suggestion is to park at the gas station or the side of the driveway next door like I did. There is a sign that says you can't park there but everyone does it so you should be alright as long as you get your order to go. There is also a Sprouts Supermaket across the street and down a little bit with a huge parking deck and it's free parking. Probably a better choice then parking in a driveway with a tow sign like I did. Oops! \\n\\nOverall, this place deserves 5 stars because the food is fabulous and the service is fantastic! The bad parking can't keep me away. Definitely give this place a try."},{"name":"Brooklyn Pizza","address":"1647 Arapahoe Ave","city":"Boulder","stars":"4","text":"Finally!

Probably true, but my praises to Home Slice either way for providing a beautiful evening.  I was not only invited, but also treated to dinner and joined by one of the owners, an executive chef, and an employee at the restaurant side.  We started with beverages outside on the vibrant and colorful patio which really captures a \\"feel\\" that is unique to Home Slice.  Hard to put to words, so you'll just have to go for yourself.  I enjoyed \\"Brooklyn Ale's Summer Seasonal\\", which I highly suggest, especially with the hotter months quickly approaching...  Once seated, we were greeted by our server who perfectly fit that same \\"feel\\" I mentioned previously.  He was not only friendly and helpful but he exuded all that Home Slice has to offer: something different, something great, something FUN.  We started with the antipasto plate: a variety of gourmet meats, olives, and cheeses, roasted red peppers, artichokes, garlic knot's, and everything else you need to start a meal off right.  I enjoyed my first chicken parmesan sub, which was delectable and filling.  I think at this point in the meal, I was full but that didn't stop us from ordering 3 one-of-kind pizzas.

I ordered the blueberry pancakes with ham along with a one egg on toast sandwich with a large glass of OJ.

They were good but some of the outer edges were hard almost as if I made them...which is why I eat out.  The one egg in the sandwich this time seamed like one egg which fell a little short so I stuffed my piece of ham in there to add something meaty.\\n\\nI thought my order took too long considering the place wasn't running at full capacity.  There is no waitress service since you stand in line to order and then basically wait for it with a tray.  My egg sandwich came out first and then I had to wait for the pancakes which were being held up by the ham.

Unfortunately the server broke the champagne flute into a million pieces when they cleared the table.

When we returned not 5 minutes later, our table was cleared and all of our stuff was missing and none of the staff around had any clue what had happened to it. It turns out the hostess thought we had left, so she took the things to the hostess station for safe keeping. So that was awkward, since we were only seated half an hour earlier and obviously hadn't eaten our meals. What really annoyed me about this was that now our table which was previously at the end of a row of tables was suddenly jammed in between two other tables at uncomfortably close proximity. So not only was our stuff missing and our table semi cleared, our seating situation had suddenly been downgraded without warning.\\n\\nI had the short rib and my girlfriend had the braised lamb and the food was tasty, but by the time the food arrived the experience had already been sullied by a disorganized staff who poorly communicate amongst themselves. We were offered no apology for our bad experience, either verbal or compensatory, and the hostess even gave me a sort of sheepish \\"I know we screwed up, but I honestly don't care that much\\" look as we walked out. Twice during the meal a manager came by to ask how we were enjoying everything, but not specifically addressing the problems we had already encountered, so it was clearly just a cursory gesture not resulting from actual issues we had faced.

Everyone there appeared adequately hip.  Me, not so much.  We brought our kids, but that wasn't the problem.\\n\\nThe first annoyance, (and this may just be a cultural generational problem, I don't know) was upon walking in and sitting down, rather loud pop-hiphop music was blasting directly above us at a volume loud enough that we just HAD to feel that slick groove while eating or talking.  There was just no way to avoid feeling like eating noodles at a dance club.  Now that is something I personally just don't like, I don't like a blasting dance beat while I eat, but I can imagine some very hip and cool movers and shakers really feel that is living.  I can understand it but in this case some of the music veered towards profanity with fvck after fvck making appearances.  Well as I said I brought my kids and I dont really appreciate that.  I don't think is necessary.  Do we all, including our kids have to eat to the fvck groove while eating??  There ought to be some reasonable limits on hipness, such that kids can go out too.  But then if they don't want kids or families there they need to put a warning up or something.  \\n\\nBefore I proceed here I will note that our main server was very nice and professional, chatted with the kids and I have no complaints.\\n\\nSecondly the food:\\nI got the spicy variety.\\nThe noodles were fine, tasty even, and totally lacking in multitude.\\nThe broth was overly rich for ramen, really too salty.  When broth is spicy and super salty that is telling you the chef's toolbox is just that limited.  The salty, spicy and overly rich broth reminded me of crappy Chinese food, and I have been to China enough to know the difference.\\n\\nThe flavor veggies and corn etc were nice, but there were exactly two little slices of pork and one half egg. Both of these were tasty and simply lacking abundance.   As someone else noted they could eat the whole thing in a few bites I concur.  For $14 bucks it was a bit of a joke as far as quantity.  If they want to sell bowls of noddles to the fashion-diet crowd they should make that clear and then perhaps they could charge an even higher price.  I think if they want adult males to visit they should spend the extra 32 cents on an adult portion.\\n\\nNow for the worst part; passing the halfway mark on finishing that big bowl of broth with a small amount of edible contents I lifted my spoon of veggies and corn to find a shred of navy or violet blue something-er-rather that I assumed can only have been plastic trash of some kind. I was understandably alarmed and annoyed and I called a second server over to discuss.  I asked her what this was and was it supposed to be in the soup. She took a closer look and said she did not know and would ask the chef, and then proceeded to use her two bare fingers to remove it from my spoon (which I was still using) and take it to the chef....  and then never returned!\\n\\nEventually I had to flag her down to ask for what if any response from the chef and the establishment on the whole and again she said she was not sure and it was probably packaging from one of the ingredients... and again that was it.  I was left having to come up with my ridiculously confused face for proper communication.  As she was finished telling me nothing important relevant to the actual issue and was about to walk away again I gave her a \\"suggestion\\" for professional service and restaurants that generally speaking if someone pulls trash out of their dish one would want to go to the chef and then come right back and report and address the issue.  She said she was planning on just dealing with it at the end, or something, I don't really get it.  She just seemed to think this was not a big deal, did not really care and neither did the chef.  it was basically, \\"oh, plastic trash in your $14 dollar food? Well, huh.. yeah, what were we talking about?\\"\\n\\nShe asked me if I would like the dish taken off the cheque or .. or what would I like as if it was confusing or troublesome that I might wants things.  Again I was confused because, well sure take it of the cheque but as a food service establishment I want them to CARE when they put trash in my food and not come to me asking what I want as if I have some issue about wanting things (like trash free food).  I think the establishment needs to proactively make amends, like they are adults and understand that trash in food is actually unacceptable.\\n\\nAt that point I just said, yeah take it off the cheque, whatever because I was tired of the infantile debate and the idea of explaining (obvious) professional food service to this server without getting paid for my consultation.\\n\\nI wanted to like this place.  It was just kind of cheaply flavored, overly rich, way too small for an adult male not on a diet, profanity in overly loud thumping music, absolutely clueless and unprofessional service and trash in food.

Unfortunately, this restaurant is not family friendly.  We brought our two-year-old daughter (who was very well behaved, BTW) for an early dinner at 5PM.  First, we were seated in the corner of the back room, I guess so we wouldn't bother the other customers.  As more and more diners were seated, they were seated as far away from us as possible.  I guess they were isolating the \\"breeders\\"?  Eventually, we were given a menu and our drink orders were taken.   There is no kid's menu, so we ordered a plain hot dog.  As we waited for a very long time, we watched the other guests get their drinks and food, and saw the manager/owner? visit every other table.  When the food came, it was tasty but cold.  Again, we waited a very long time for our check.  Our waitress came to the table three times, once to get our order, once to drop off the check and once to pick up the check.

It is usually crowded so I never suggest going there because I'm not the most patient person.  Something changed my mind last night and we asked how long the wait was.  It ended up only being about 10 minutes.\\n\\nThe menu literally had about 6-7 of my go to dishes.  Pasta Bolognese, tacos, Pad Thai, Cheeseburger, Chicken Picatta, etc.!  The waitress was friendly and attentive and the food was great.  I'll def. be going back.  My only gripe is that I wish it was bigger.  Maybe they will take over a space next to it someday...they'd certainly be able to handle the space!"},{"name":"Stammtisch","address":"401 NE 28th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"I really enjoyed my jagerschnitzel and my (sp?)

I came to Portland last year, never been able to stop by this place. Therefore, I come in after eating at sube restaurant (a sushi place right across from voodoo doughnuts). There was no line which was great because I hear the lines can basically wrap around the building practically. So once I'm inside I look at the great looking donuts circling in the glass and begin to figure out what I would like to order. As I am about to approach the counter and greet the individual (which was a bearded man with a net wrapped around his beard), walks away from the counter softly saying \\"I'm on break.\\" Then he asks (outloud) to a co-worker \\"am I on break?\\" I understand every employee deserves a break, but he made it seem like he didn't even want to assist me. There's one issue. The other issue was due to my inexperience of ordering donuts at Voodoo. First thing i explained to the individual was \\" So how does this work?\\" Stating the obvious that i have never been there before. He explained they way you could order donuts kind of low mannered and with the same attitude as if he just wanted to get off and go home, which i dont blame him coming from an employee standpoint. Idk if it was just the loud environment, lack of explanation, or my comprehensive undstanding that didnt give me the greatest experience. Therefore I ordered a classic order of donuts, not realizing that classic was literally donuts you could of ordered anywhere at any Joe shmo donut place. To my understanding, I thought classic was considered signature classic voodoo donuts that they have made before since they began, unlike their daily creative donuts. In my opinion, if I have a customer that doesn't understand how things work, I would explain my best to make sure I know what the customer is coming for, and trying to order. Therefore, I am giving this a 2 star rating. The donuts were good, but the service could step up for being one of the best donut places in town."},{"name":"Broder Caf√©","address":"2508 SE Clinton St","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"After living in the area for half a year we decided to check out Broder. Having relocated from Chicago where there's a pretty good variety of Swedish restaurants and brunch spots, we thought we'd see how it measured up. Broder is definitely \\"nicer\\" fare than the average Swedish diner/establishment.\\n\\nHowever, there are some factors that detracted from our first experience there. Timing is an issue. Brunch in Portland is a hot commodity and people seem willing (more so than I) to wait indefinitely. Broder was nice in that there was only a single party ahead of us, even though the place is somewhat small... still, despite that, getting a table took a reasonable amoutn of time. This made more sense when we sat down, when it took quite a while to order, and then an even longer time for our food to arrive. It's not that large of a restaurant, and I know they probably only had a single cook behind the counter, but 30-35 min for our straightforward order seemed a bit much. We saw my plate on the counter for a good 5-10 min before our other dish came out to us with it, so one was quite hot and one was slightly warm. The food itself was good (not what I'd call \\"great\\") although here's fair warning that the scramble portion is pretty small.\\n\\nAll of these complaints aren't intended to take away from the spirit of the restaurant, as it has potential -- it may have just been an \\"off\\" day. The menu is a healthy balance of traditional Sweden and a contemporary twist, and the interior is surprisingly comfortable given how small the tables are, all lined up railroad style. (You wouldn't know this from their website, which features a variety of nearly abstract detail photos of chairs and biscuits, but no useful view of the restaurant itself.) But a word of caution if you are hoping to be in and out in any reasonable amount of time... you won't.

Added plus that they use organic, locally grown ingredients whenever possible. \\n\\nA tartine: open-faced sandwich. So very simple in theory. At Blue Dahlia, so very elegant in execution. I have had just about every tartine thee, except for the shrimp (I'm never a big shrimp fan, so I indulge in other gustatory goodness when there). The turkey and cranberry, enhanced with a hint of butter on the bread, is elegant yet homey. It takes me back to leftover Thanksgiving turkey on wheat bread with butter that my mother made (only, this is better!). The fig and ricotta is divine, a dessert to share with your table if you want. Prosciutto, pesto, and fresh mozzarella; smoked salmon; hummus... all fantastic choices. \\n\\nAnd then... there are the salads! Perfect, delicious. The bean salads are hearty enough for a large hunger, and if you add a scoop of the oil-based (no goopy mayo here) tuna salad, you have fuel for your workout. Every soup I've had at Blue Dahlia has been lovely, from the chili chilly gazpacho in the summer to the luscious corn chowder to chase away the cold in February. Frittatas are full of savory goodness... you can get breakfast all day! And, if you just want to get a basket of bread and spreads for your carb cravings, you'll be treated to a great selection of sweet and not-so-sweet options, with generous pots of jams and Nutella (can be a bit problematic when the bees are about and you're seated outdoors). The dinner entrees have always been lovely, with the mushroom crepes being particular stand-outs. Their wine list is small but varied, and they have a respectable series of four on-tap beers. Zhi tea impresses the educated locavore who likes to go local, down to the leaf. And, if you have room, their desserts are just as scrumptious as everything else there. I remember a chocolate mousse cake, from one of the rare occasions on which I had room after my meal. I usually just manage to squeeze in a fresh-baked cookie. \\n\\nService is almost always top-notch: the only time I had anything close to an issue with service was when my party was seated outside and we were waited on by, I believe, a very new-to-the establishment gentleman. \\n\\nBottom line: Go to Blue Dahlia if: (1) you want to get out of downtown for lunch; (2) you want to impress your friends/significant others for a fabulous, food-enhanced conversation; (3) you want your friends to know what awesome taste you have in casual yet delicious dining; (4) You need a nice nosh before a night out; (5) you have an operational tongue connected to a functional digestive system."},{"name":"Voodoo Doughnut - Old Town","address":"22 SW 3rd Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"Two stars because I came here specifically for the friggin' bacon maple doughnut I saw Bourdain with on his show....but then couldn't have one because they didn't have any made.

The service level is more suited to a campus beer hall than a fine-dining establishment, with entrees literally thrown into the table for customers to sort out who got what, checks that have to be sent back for correction multiple times, and a general \\"so what?\\" attitude to all requests and inquiries.

No. But is it the best ramen I've had in the ATL and can their bowls satisfy my somewhat sexual, weekly ramen urges? Hell yes to both! I'm so happy this West Coast chain made its way to the Dirty Dirty. --Things to know: \\n*****\\nI. LOCATION & PARKING\\nThis Asian destination is located in the corner of a Sandy Springs strip mall. Free parking is plenty. Make your life easier, though, by parking farther away and taking a nice walk. Don't be that person driving around in circles, since you'll need to burn some calories from your meal, anyway. Speaking of food...\\n\\nII. FOOD & DRINK\\nDespite being open for only a few days, the kitchen brought their best. And thanks to our server and recommendations from fellow yelpers that have already paid a visit, we didn't have a bad thing there. \\n\\nMore about how they organize the food, they have a tapas section and then a bunch of sides/ apps. They're basically all the same. \\n\\nWhat we had:\\n\\n*Takoyaki: Ooh, these delicious balls of fried dough and octopus topped with a ton of tasty awesomeness is so delicious. And if you don't like octopus, I'm not sure if we can be friends. In fact, we can't, so don't bother contacting me. -If you like takoyaki, I don't think you'll be disappointed. They also come out fancy with sticks in them, too. #fancypants.\\n\\n*Jinya Bun: The thick braised pork with vegetables (basically a leaf of butter lettuce) is pretty good. I'm not feeling the sauce-to-everything-else ratio, but it's still tasty. I personally won't order it again, but it's decent for those that love baos.\\n\\n*Spicy Creamy Shrimp Tempura: The sauce has the consistency of Chinese walnut shrimp -- if you've ever had this dish -- and it has a nice kick to it. The batter is perfect, and I wish I ordered two. Get this.\\n\\nFor ramen, they have 12 or so different types of bowls and almost 25 types of sides. So if there isn't a bowl that you don't like, especially if it's customized to your liking, then you're that guy in the corner, sulking, playing Words with Friends by yourself. In other words, there's something for everyone.\\n\\n**Cha Cha Cha: Several servers said this bowl was their favorite and for good reason. The noodles are sexily, bootilicious thick. They didn't mess up the soft boiled egg, and the generous, fatty slices of pork chashu melted in my mouth. -The broth is decent; it comes with a lot of seasonings. And a garlic slut like me loves this bowl; however, I do think that the bean sprouts are unnecessary.\\n\\n**Jinya Black Tonkotsu: Like what a homegirl said on my Instagram post: \\"Once you got black ramen, you never go back.\\" I'll say, \\"Black don't crack, but this black ramen tastes like crack.\\" Regardless of these cumbersome cliches, this bowl is wonderful. And even though the broth isn't the most transcendent one I've ever had, it hits the spot. It's flavorful. It's milky. It has lots of fat. \\n\\nThe toppings are wonderful, too. The pork chashu, like the Cha Cha Cha, are cooked perfectly and plenty fatty. The healthy potions of scallions, kikurage (ear mushroom), dried seaweed, garlic chips, garlic oil, and fried onions are awesome supporting cast members. I got mine with corn, too, because I'm gangsta like that. --The noodles aren't overcooked, and they have a nice bounce to them. Oh, and the egg, that gluttonous egg, is beautiful (like the previous bowl I wrote about). \\n\\nIII. SERVICE\\nThey don't take reservations, and ramen whores (like myself) will have to wait around 45-60 minutes. Obviously, peeps will wait a longer time with a larger group.\\n\\nTheir hosts, who put up with countless questions over the phone, were very sweet. Also, the server that brought us our food didn't roll her eyes when asked questions. It took them a while to have our order taken and get our drinks, but that will be resoled over time. \\n\\nRegarding the speed of the food, it came out really fast. (Under ten minutes) So no qualms there. The manager even thanked us for dining with them.\\n\\nOn the real, I think the manager(s) is doing a great job, despite the horde of people visiting this small establishment.\\n\\nIV. AMBIENCE & D√âCOR\\nThe joint is pretty small. There are a few two-four-person tables along the right side, a bar in front of the kitchen and along the front window. There's outdoor seating, but it's hot as hell's ass outside, so don't bother checking it out right now.\\n\\nInside is sophisticated, yet laid back. You could rock some sweats or a four-piece suite, and it would be all good in the hood. \\n\\nV. PRICES\\nMost ramens hover around $11-14 bucks. Apps and sides are less than $10. If you know how hard it is to make ramen, you'll know that this place is very affordable (and cheaper than other ramen joints in the ATL).\\n\\nVI. OVERALL\\nI am so happy a decent ramen joint opened up in the ATL.

Came here on a chilly Saturday night. We ordered the Cadillac and the omnivore to go. We called ahead to avoid waiting in the cold. Showed up 25min after and pizza was hot and ready for take out!!!!! I couldn't help but to peak inside the takeout box... Ooohhhh so steamy.... We have never tried Detroit style pizza. One of the reviewers mentioned that it's like eating focaccia with pizza toppings and it kind of threw me off a bit since I don't like the firm and dough-y taste of focaccia bread. The truth? IT IS SO MUCH BETTER THAN PIZZA TOPPING ON FOCACCIA!!!!!! Super crispy and crunchy crust (think fresh deep fried funnel cake minus the sweetness), airy cotton-y super soft dough that's much thinner than real focaccia but a little thicker than regular pizza dough. And the topping..... OMG IT'S HEAVEN!!!!! The omnivore was definitely our favorite. The crispy pepperoni edges blended perfectly with the tender mushrooms. The red sauce gave the right amount of tartness to cut through the greasy (but delicious) topping. A lot of the other reviewers rave about the detroiter and based on the omnivore (less pepperoni than the Detroit but more veggies) I can definitely see why. \\n\\nThe Cadillac was a pleasant surprise. The salty prosciutto combined with the sweet and tangy balsamic sauce made the Cadillac taste closer to a Hawaiian (Cadillac is better of course). I would highly recommend it if you are into prosciutto and tangy taste.\\n\\nPro tip: when you take the first bite, start from the crispy edge and take the biggest bite you can manage. The best part about this type of pizza is in its crust. You will not be disappointed!!!!!!!"},{"name":"Voodoo Doughnut - Old Town","address":"22 SW 3rd Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"Fun Flavors and atmosphere, but a bit over-rated and over-priced.\\n\\nHowever if you've never been I'd say it's a must go just because it's such a Portland attraction.

They were so accommodating!\\n\\nThey have a great outdoor area that opens in the spring, and a fast valet system. We were seated immediately, and I started with the Oceanside cocktail. It was delicious! Everyone raved about the cocktails they ordered. We started with raw oysters, the shrimp appetizer, swordfish crudo, steak tartare, calamari, and fried oysters. They were all delectable. My favorites were the crudo and calamari. The shrimp dish was also delicious, but very spicy!\\n\\nFor my entree I ordered the lobster roll. It's SO good. I've ordered this in the past, but they now serve it with housemade BBQ chips. Others at the table ordered the mahi mahi special served with crispy prosciutto in a butter sauce, and the striped bass served with mussels. For dessert we ordered the blueberry pudding cake (somewhat like bread pudding), and that, too, was great. \\n\\nOverall it was a great experience and wonderful place to celebrate a birthday. It's beautifully decorated, and great for large groups.

Once you get to the counter to order you tell the cooks what you'd like and they were very nice in helping you choose what you wanted. \\nI got the breakfast sandwich with bacon and home fries on a bagel while my girlfriend got chocolate chip pancakes. We both thought our meals were very good and enjoyed the atmosphere of the restaurant, which was a bit different than your normal breakfast place. One other plus was the area we ate in because afterwards we went for a walk out to the Charles River, which wasn't far at all. \\nOverall this is a very solid breakfast place just be prepared for a little bit of a wait and the potential to wait for seats to open up."},{"name":"Budda C","address":"1223 Beacon St","city":"Brookline","stars":"3.5","text":"I loved their sushi!

The staff head count was very high compared to the people eating so it was not a lack of help. Food was okay (took a long time 45mins for the food to hit the table) but the coffee, oh the coffee-so bad, so they pride themselves on roasting there own coffee bean locally but living in the NW there is a min-standard and I cant remember being able to see the botton of a full cup of coffee ever (tea, yes coffee never)!! So overall the prices are around 30% high based on other resterants in the area for the overall expirance.

This very small restaurant offers reasonably priced Bangladeshi food.  The vegetarian dishes are much better than the meat dishes.  The owner and staff go out of their way to make you feel welcomed.  In fact I think their personal and friendly service is quite well known.\\n\\nBuffet is open all seven days, a plus.  Number of dishes is small, even by the standard in this town of the tiny Indian buffets.  Thankfully goat curry--my favorite--is available and delicious.  Naan is regularly brought to your table when fresh out of the kitchen.  Will I hit the lunch buffet again?  Sure, but I don't see that happening more than a couple times a year.      \\n\\nSpecials are always available for dinner, and sometimes a good bet.  I've found the sauces to be tasty, although simple.  But meats tend to be tough--a combination of leanness and overcooking.  Only the goat meat (thanks to its high gelatin content) escapes this fate.  Vegetarian dishes have great flavor and I especially recommend Channa Molsho-la and the spinach dishes.  I was not crazy about the biryani, finding it a little soggy and lacking toppings.  I also found the mango lassi a little thin.  One special I got though was dynamite--lamb in a mango based curry sauce.  Well balanced lovely flavor.  Too bad it's not on the regular menu.\\n\\nIn the end it's probably not fair to judge the food by comparing it to Indian cuisine.  Maybe certain things I thought were off were what Bangladeshi cuisine is supposed to taste like.  I still haven't tried the fish dopiazza.  It's their signature dish, and seafood figures (from my readings) very importantly in this cuisine.  So I will have to try that dish eventually to complete the evaluation.

The CONCHAS A LA PARRILLA was a huge seared scallop in a buttery, slightly sweet sauce, topped with crispy onion strands.  It was so good my husband ordered another.  The waiter suggested the MIXTA NIKKEI, which was also great although I thought the large deep-fried prawn on top was a little over-done.   At the suggestion of the waiter, we also ordered the EMPANADAS DE CARNE.  It was well-prepared, especially the flaky crust, but I didn't enjoy it was much as the other ites we had. \\nSpeaking of the waiter, he was very helpful, friendly and prompt.  There was also lots of other wait staff, so the timing of the meal went well.

A few other people have mentioned the food was not correctly spiced-- I love spicy food and thai food in general, so this is not a problem for me.  HOWEVER, you have to realize that thai food can be very hot and they have to season each plate individually-- They have to adjust it to the customer's preference.  And it's really hard to do this exactly right.  When I say I want it \\"hot\\" I mean I want it to melt my face off.... When other people say they want it \\"hot\\" they mean they want a mild salsa burn.  People have different definitions of \\"spicy.\\"  Some people say they want it \\"medium\\" but they really mean without any spice.  I think you find that at any thai place.  Best bet: if you don't like spice, order something less than medium.

Don't be confused there's seating area in the back that's reserved for dining but there's a few seat and small tables to sit at if you're waiting for a table. We were able to score some seats to enjoy our Fireman #4 and bask in the sun. I don't mind the wait here because it is so worth it. I LOVE THIS PLACE! We were just hanging out chatting when a hostess walked by announcing \\"Genny party of 2.\\" Oh snap that was only a 30 minute.

As we were wrapping up our order he noticed our pint glasses. My husband's was empty and mine was almost done. He said \\"I notice that yours is empty and you might need another one soon. Can I bring out a pitcher of Fireman's 4 for you?\\" Wow! Of course we obliged to the pitcher. How did he know we have Fireman's? Either a great observation, maybe a tip from the bar outside or a wild guest but that impressed my husband and I. \\n\\nOur salad came out promptly with 2 oh so warm yummy bundled carbs that you can call a roll. I't so good. Warm, crispy but chewy just like their crust. Then our pitcher quickly followed. Our server also went ahead and filled our pints up. The salad portion was perfect. We finished up our salads had enough room to breath and then the beautiful pie appeared on our table. Where do I begin?! The crust is just the right amount of thin that's crispy and still chewy. The sauce is very light but flavorful. It's just right. Pepperoni's are the perfect portion and they are all so crispy. The mushrooms are the perfect morsel size for every bite.

I had a discussion with the server that I want Medium Rare (warm pink center) but to err on the side of Medium if they tended to undercook their meat. I got Blue to rare - middle was still colder than room temperature. Seasoning was bland. They obviously expect you to order more toppings than just cheese and then maybe the burger would have held up. But I judge my burgers on meat, cheese, lettuce, tomato, onion. And temperature.\\n\\nTwo people ponied up and ordered the king. Both were disappointed with the quality of their cut. Especially not for an $80 steak a la carte. I would have been upset if that were a $10 steak I picked out at Publix. I would have kicked myself for picking such a poor cut. At $80 in Buckhead where I assume they get their Steaks from a quality butcher - I have to assume that we (bad) lucked into the two worst cuts of the night. I say I assume that because they can't stay in business serving food like that at any price.\\n\\nThis seemed like a really rough night for K+D all the way around. My experience was not horrible. Everyone was friendly. But there are too many excellent meals to be had in ATL for my best comment about your super pricey dinner to be that everyone was friendly."},{"name":"Mary Mac's Tea Room","address":"224 Ponce De Leon Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"I love this place!

I'd been sitting on the thing for months; and, almost missed the expiration date!\\n\\nWe had a hard time finding the place, which is on New York, east of Park Avenue.  We found parking on the street, as it was a Tuesday evening; and, Park Avenue wasn't as crowded as it would be on the weekend.

Another table, with two women were similarly seated; but, no one made an effort to help the woman with her chair (they are quite heavy; and, she was pregnant.)  Once seated, we were provided with water; and bread sticks, along with a pimento cheese spread accompanying the bread.\\n\\nWe were greeted by Pietro, who was thrilled to see the TravelZoo voucher; and, he explained how it worked; and, if we wanted options that were more expensive than those included, we would simply pay the difference.  To that end, my wife ordered the Chilean Sea Bass, which was a $6 upgrade; and, I ordered the half-rack of lamb.  To go with it, I selected a Reisling Kabinett for my wife; and, ordered a Rose for myself.\\n\\nBut, I am getting ahead of myself.  For starters, we ordered the Twice-smoked Fish Dip, which cam out in a large mason jar, filled with smoke.  Pietro opened it; and, we oohed and aahed at the puffs of smoke coming out.  The fish dip was quite mild, served with excellently prepared crostinis.  It was a substantial appetizer; but, we were hungry for dinner.\\n\\nMy lamb was closer to rare than I would have liked; but, was delicious.  It was coated with a nice spice rub, served with a few drizzles of mint sauce; and, accompanied by carrots two ways (boiled and puree); and, duck fat fried potatoes.  Everything was delicious; and, I couldn't stop until everything was gone.  My wife's fish was exceptional, rivaling the fish at Eddi V's and The Lake House, where my wife also had the Sea Bass.\\n\\nAll-in, we had a wonderful time; and, are already planning a return visit, without the TravelZoo restrictions.

Foursomes of ladies, sometimes with a man or two in the mix but always dressed easily, breezily, and beautifully. They entered in droves during the night I came with my own foursome. It was one of those perfect-temperatured evenings that ensured the pretty courtyard patio barely needed to lift a finger in the diners' seduction. With the abundance of reasonably priced cocktails, ranging from the humble but tasty Sauvie (vodka, vanilla liquor, and sours) to some unique, posterboard-paint-hued concoctions, the scene reminded me of a well-known, fluffy drink-toting group of gals. \\n\\nThat's right! The Golden Girls! Man I love the Golden Girls! They were feisty dames who didn't need to spout profundities about contemporary feminism and its place in one's quest for love and companionship. The Golden Girls had that shit down years before anyone could pronounce Manolo Blahnik. Plus, my band of diners and I fit the rubric set out by the women on The Golden Girls pretty nicely (or so we shall for the purposes of this review).\\n\\n*SOPHIA: My Not-Ma-in-Law, the elder stateswoman of our table. Not-Ma is not from Sicily but is just as exacting about her food as any Southern Italian woman. Have you ever cared for a baby? You try rocking, changing, giving milk, burping, and the kid keeps wailing for something without being able to articulate precisely what she wants? That's how it is to find food in Portland that Not-Ma likes. Yet she liked her stuffed chicken at Equinox. I tried a bite, and I understand why. It was moist and cooked exactly how chicken should be. Plus, it had bacon.\\n\\nDOROTHY: Deep-voiced and snarky, this could only be JorTer. JorTer ordered the pork tenderloin, which came in a pool of cilantro-citrus sauce and polenta. Did I ever think my sports-obsessed, PBR-bred boyfriend would ever seek out and enjoy polenta? I did not.\\n\\nBLANCHE: I'm going to make Baby BroTer the lascivious one of the bunch just because I can. Baby BroTer ate the enchiladas, which was drenched in this lovely sauce that contained just the right balance of sour cream, chipotle, mole, and onion flavors. I know because I ate it, too.\\n\\nYou thought I was going to make myself Rose, didn't you? Well, I'm not. But I will say that every dish on our table received raves, and with a very pleasant staff, you don't need me to be the fourth Golden Girl. You don't need a fourth anything, just get yourself up north and eat here.

I came after hearing glowing reviews, and from the minute I walked in I was impressed--the interior design is amazing!  They somehow made a tiny space work so efficiently.  The galley kitchen is open and in plain sight which means the chefs are under a lot of visual pressure and have to work quickly and quietly, while running a tight ship with clean workstations, which they did.  The cute staff members worked efficiently without running into each other which was amazing considering how little room they had to move.  We ordered brunch with fluffy apple fritters, eggs, delicious sausage.  The coffee was good and I really liked the touch of cute warm cream.  \\n\\nHonestly, my favorite part of the whole meal was the presentation.

That being said, when we left at four, it was already packed. \\n\\nWe get to our table and see that you basically write down your own order. A woman came by and checked our order and we told her we were new and asked if we did it right (okay, we did...it's just as simple as writing it down), and she was very gracious and went and grabbed our drinks: a Bloody Mary & a French Connection. I ordered the four-piece fried chicken (eyes too big for my stomach) with their cheese grits and their collards with \\"cracklin' cornbread\\" (this is apparently where you break up a little cornbread muffin into \\"cracklins\\" and put it in the collards with the collard juices. My friend ordered a one-piece fried chicken with their mac and cheese and this thing called \\"tomato pie\\" for a side. It's basically a casserole side dish with diced tomatoes, garlic, onions, and cream cheese. It's WONDERFUL and not heavy at all and I will be trying to find a recipe on it on Google right after I write this. \\n\\nOur waitress came by and gave us a little sample of \\"pot likker\\" with some cornbread cracklins to introduce us to it since it was our first time there, which was SO delicious. The greens were perfectly cooked and not bitter at all. She also introduced us to the \\"cracklins\\" part, where you literally just break apart the muffin so it can soak up the juices. YUM. \\n\\nShortly after our drinks came out, all of our food came out too. I bet they have a lot of giant pots and casserole pans going on at once, because it's very much southern home cooking and they were busy folks. My friend said her French Connection -- a tropical-looking drink that made me long for the Keys rather than our slightly grey, chilly weather -- was delicious. My Bloody Mary wasn't anything to write home about, but it was a good arrival drink to Atlanta!\\n\\nAll in all, my plate of food was pretty dang good, and probably made better by the fact that I hadn't had a meal in 8 hours. Cheese grits are hard to do wrong and the fried chicken was tasty, but boy, did they cook some good greens. I'd have to say that was my favorite part. While in my mind I'd probably say the food is 4 stars, our waitress was so welcoming, and I'm all about a good personal experience along with the food, so given the recommendations from both a stranger on MARTA and the concierge, plus the crowd of families in this place, I'd say it's a safe bet to visit Mary Mac's if you're in Atlanta."},{"name":"The Bancroft","address":"15 Third Ave","city":"Burlington","stars":"4","text":"Good God.\\n\\nMy parents are old school West Indian and are generally unimpressed with restaurant food.

Dad's birthday dinner so our party of 4 ordered quite a bit. Everyone had wine.  For starters we ordered clam chowder, seafood tower, prosciutto and fig preserve and seared scallops. For entrees we had the 12 oz filet, sirloin, salmon and duck. For sides we had Brussels sprouts, mashed potatoes and mushrooms. For dessert we had the apple tart tartin, blood orange cheesecake, chocolate cake, and ice cream. Cappuccinos, coffee and tea with dessert.  It was all awesome.  Everyone loved everything and by the end of the night the conversation at the table was basically everyone repeating \\"I'm stuffed\\".  We all noticed the excellent service which resulted in a 25% tip. Our waitstaff was outstanding and really made the night superb. They made my dads birthday dinner a very enjoyable night out. Food is expensive but worth the money. Our meal for 4 came to just shy of $500 with the tip. They even came to the table with some complimentary chocolate truffles with a candle for dad to blow out (but didn't sing happy birthday--thank god)! Very nice touch.\\n\\nMy parents have never been so impressed with a restaurant experience and they noted that both capital grille and Atlantic fish company were put to shame by Bancroft both in food and service.

Out waiter was nice but they don't really do much more than bring you a drink once.  Don't check back in.  Soda is cans so it not cheap.  Salad bad wasn't anything to right home about.  Other Brazil streak salad bars were much better.  Most of the meat was good. Pork was gross. The roasted chicken and garlic streak were our favorite.  We didn't take much when they came around first time.  Big mistake for us.  2 more tables got sat but 4 left before they came.  So it was only 4 times total in our area eating.  They keep coming around with food skipping our table.  Guess you need to stock up the first round or be ready to wait super long time cause you will get skipped every few meats.  Again meat was good but not best.  When you factor poor service I can't understand how people are giving this place more than 3 stars.   Tables have paper table cloths to help stay cleaner.  So clearly don't want to wash the cloth one as much.  Bathroom was crusty.  Missing tiles everywhere, some oddly put up stales that you can tell someone didn't know what they were doing, floors were slippery.  This is cheaper than many of the other Brazil places but I came clearly see why! We felt like they were avoiding our table.  I won't go back to this location.

A little thin. Not much thinner, but thinner.  Crust would be better if your pans were a little more burnt up and used looking...

We were excited to try out their pool since it was in the 90s and balmy, but the pool just happened to be closed that day so we were disappointed.  Since we were disappointed, we decided to try out their bars.  We went to Detention, which is a whiskey-themed cocktail bar - each bar has a different theme and beverage that they feature.\\n\\nThe cocktails were not the best I have had, but they were average and it was a unique experience.  I tried the Whiskey Old-Fashioned, which was a traditional, boozy old-fashioned with a large chunk of ice.  I was more impressed with the crispy, flavorful cajun tater tots.  The tater tots are a perfect snack to soak up the boozy drinks.  Kennedy School is worth going to for the unique experience, but I don't think their bars are necessarily the best cocktails in Portland."},{"name":"Holy Taco","address":"345 1st St","city":"Lake Oswego","stars":"3.5","text":"The lady behind the bar was very kind and on top of it.  The tacos were horrible.  Pulled chicken tacos were dry with no flavor.  The shrimp tacos were ok if you like mayo in your shrimp taco and consider three small shrimp enough to call them a shrimp taco.  The Margarita was awesome if you like a dominant taste of sweet and sour with minimal alcohol made from a mix I suspect.  Senor Taco has far better tacos than this place.

Finally made it out there for their lunch buffet. They did a nice job of remodeling this former Quiznos store. I thought leaving the mural of sandwiches alone was a nice touch.\\n\\nI was pleasantly surprised to find chaat on their buffet table. Never seen this offered at any other Indian buffet. The wafers were still crispy and the underlying garbanzo beans nicely seasoned. There were also pakoras which still remained crispy. The usual condiments of tamarind and mint chutney were available. I appreciated they also had pickles which is not often seen at Indian buffets. \\n\\nThere was the usual selection of vegetable dishes. One dish I rarely see at an Indian buffet is eggplant or bengan bartha. It was so yummy, I still think about it. There were some other vegetable dishes so for someone on a veggie diet, they would have a nice selection to make a meal.\\n\\nThe meat dishes included the usual tandoori chicken, butter chicken and a curry chicken. To go with the meat and veggies were vegetarian biriyani and plain rice. The naan was piping hot and I appreciated the fact that they bring enough naan to keep the turnover fast thus avoiding cold, hard naan. Everything was prepared well.\\n\\nDesert included kheer and carrot halwa. Both were tasty. The complimentary chai or tea was a bonus. I've only seen this offered at one other Indian restaurant in the area. \\n\\nFinally, service was excellent. The owner was warm and friendly. They have a Nepali waitress who provided excellent customer service with her warm smile and friendly demeanor. She came by often, checking on the customers, keeping their water filled. \\n\\nI'll definitely be back.\\n\\nUpdate: Returned after a few weeks for the lunch buffet. I wonder if they changed ownership. Food quality had deteriorated as well as service. Staff had changed and not as friendly as the previous staff. Plates were not cleared from the table. The last straw was their refusal to honor the coupon they had offered through one of the local neighborhood fliers. With many better choices in the area, I can't see myself returning here ever again.Changing from 4 stars to 2 stars."},{"name":"Am√©lie's French Bakery & Caf√©","address":"840 Marietta St NW","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Favorite bakery in Atlanta!

And worse is that you cannot get a rare or medium-rare burger... consuming 'quality' beef is really when I'd like a more 'rare' cooked burger but they won't do that for some reason.  The sides are ok and the beer selection is pretty good.  Essentially you are paying a lot for a burger, that you know is made from quality ingredients, but will simply not really impress you.\\n\\nIn this neighborhood a restaurant like this could have really knocked it out of the park but Grass Fed has fallen short so far in my opinion."},{"name":"Voodoo Doughnut - Old Town","address":"22 SW 3rd Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"Okay.
