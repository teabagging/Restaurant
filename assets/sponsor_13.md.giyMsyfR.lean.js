I recall the local excitement when Smokehouse opened up down the street from me in Washington Square and my disappointment when I tried it.  It seemed at the time that possibly New Englanders had a very different sense of what qualifies for \\"great barbecue\\".  I had resigned myself to the possibility that barbecue was a sacrifice that I would have to make if I chose to live in New England.\\n\\nAfter trying Sweet Cheeks twice recently, I have completely changed my mind.  Tiffani Faison gets it, and she gets it right.  Nothing on this menu is an afterthought.  Every item on my tray was clearly made with care and attention. And unlike many little barbecue joints in the South that typically have one show-stopping side, every side here was delicious with an inventive twist.  I particularly enjoyed the mac and cheese.  As far as the barbecue, it l seems like the emphasis is on Memphis and Carolina style (my favorites...might explain my bias towards this place), though they mix in a little Texas for good measure.   \\n\\nUnder the liquor heading, the house bill 819 is reason enough to come back to this restaurant again and again.  This and the bucket o' biscuits would make a great quick filler or late night snack.  Just an aside, whoever originally thought up honey butter is a genius and should be recognized as such.  \\n\\nService here was quick, friendly, and knowledgable.  I got the sense that our server genuinely liked the food she was serving.  The atmosphere is fun and inviting, and the decor looks like a mix of industrial and farmhouse.  I felt like I was right back home in the South again.\\n\\nI could imagine my friends taking their kids here, and it would be a great place to take a date to show your fun, relaxed side.  Maybe not a first date, though.

The staff are generally friendly, competent, and attentive.\\n\\nSo why not 4 or 5 stars?  Simple... the prices!  For years Rocco's prices were very reasonable.  Then around late 2014 they started rising... I think the owners might have been trying to improve the numbers to sell the business.  Then they did sell the business, and the prices rose again!

I was curious to see if they are just always on the other line taking orders when I call so I call while I am line. A girl walked over to the phone looked at it then walked away.

We got up to leave, walked right past a few of the workers and nobody even noticed we left.  If I were the owner heads would roll.  The only reason a place like this survives is the area seems underserved in general.  If this place was in Baltimore or DC it would be gone by now.

The first time I went was back in the day, perhaps 2005 or 2006 - a very long time ago.  Back then I was into sushi, but not a so called 'pro' at it.  My palate was still relatively green at the time.  I remember getting the avocado kama the first time, which was and still is a great tasting appetizer.  It's great because they slather all that mayo/srhicha sauce on top of it and everything is warm and gooey (in a good way) when it hits your mouth.\\n\\nThe rolls were awesome back then and we ordered 3 different ones this time around since the sashimi was so damn expensive: the southsider, ozzy2, and good times roll.    The rolls were great except for the good times roll.  Nobody at my table really touched that roll because I think the lobster in that roll was infused and killed with too much mayonnaise and made everyone feel a little sick when eating it.  The southsider is my new favorite - with yellowtail, mint and jalapenos! mmm.\\n\\nI absolutely love sashimi(raw fish by itself, no rice) and wouldn't mind eating a full meal of just plain sashimi, but I couldn't find it on the menu.  All they had was nigiri (the raw fish WITH the rice) unless I just couldn't find it.  Maybe I was mistaken about that part, but the seat we had was really really dark and the menu was kind of hard to read in the restaurant at 730PM on a summer night (still very bright outside).  \\n\\nIn conclusion, I would say this place is not for beginner's due to the high prices.  The most basic raw fish a beginner could try: the salmon nigiri was at a hefty price of 2.75 I believe.  That's just for one piece.  The prices go up from that....\\n\\nMy mom and dad got a bento box dinner with cod and chicken, and their chicken was not tasty at all.  That really knocked off a star because YES even though this is a Japanese place and you don't really go to a Japanese place for chicken, at the same it's a really, REALLY simple thing to cook and if I'm going to pay $28 for a bento box where I (a person who doesn't really cook much) can make the chicken taste better, yes you are going to get a star off your total rating.\\n\\nOur bill was about $50 a person for food and no alcohol. We didn't order as much as we could.  My mom and dad shared that bento box..so it was more like $60 per person assuming my mom and dad were one person."},{"name":"Wine30","address":"10835 SE Main St","city":"Milwaukie","stars":"4.5","text":"Enjoying a Lazy Monday at Wine30.

Olive and June has unfortunately both afflictions. The biggest problem with this place is the service was unbelievably lackluster. It can be a problem in Austin.  Many of the waitstaff in this city are just biding their time until their band makes it big or they get that marketing degree. I judge most restaurants by the staff. Austin suffers from a large number of unprofessional waitpeople. The hostess was incredibly lackluster in her wanting to seat us.  But we didn't take it personally.  She was that way with everyone.

Servers were very attentive and efficient in terms of every aspect; attitude was very friendly at the same time.

When the appetizers came on, I had the urge to cancel the rest of my order because I could eat 2 bowls of rice just with the veggie w/ bean curd dish alone.

It's an extremely simple dish with no fancy flavours yet so well executed. \\n\\nThe Xiao Long Bao was within standard but I've had better. The Dongpo pork has a lot of flavour but not too salty --- I don't even eat fatty pork but I couldn't resist. \\n\\nMy least favourites have to be the Pan-fried cabbage with bamboo fungi and tofu skin and the 2nd course of the Peking duck (the duck meat with stir fried with Chinese celery); taste-wise they were both simply too average...something almost every Chinese mom can create without spending too much effort.  \\n\\nI do like the rice cake too --- so happy that they were not lumpy, like they've been in the wok for too long which is very much of a common problem in a number of Shanghai restaurants I've been to.

Came here on a Tuesday late night with a friend after a long day at Magic Kingdom. The first thing we noticed was that every single table was beyond dirty. Half empty drinks, crushed napkins, and disgusting plates were upon every single table that wasn't taken. Also, there were approximately twenty (20) people just waiting to be seated, and the place was not even close to full, only there was one problem; there was no host to seat anyone. At no time did we see one single person working there or staff member. No host, no waiter or waitress, no busboys, nada. We waited there for about 10 minutes before making the call we had to leave. We were really in the mood for some Steak 'n Shake burgers and milkshakes, but with the state of this restaurant there is no chance we would stick around to find out. As we were walking out we encountered a father and daughter who said that they had come the night before and had the exact same issue. \\n\\nThis place is a prime example of a disaster restaurant. Corporate needs to come down and fire the management here. For a place that is so close to the crowds coming from Disney, they could make some serious money here at night. Instead, the management, staff, and anyone who has anything to do with this place need a serious lesson in How to Work in a Restaurant 101.

If we had paid $20-$30 for our meal, maybe we would have thought the food better. But for $65, it better be the best meal I've ever had. And it was far, far from it. The fish was served over a blue cheese risotto that had way too much blue cheese, and didn't pair well with the fish. My boyfriend's pork chop, while the favor was pretty good, was pretty dry.

I don't follow any diet regimen, but I am very conscious about what I eat and usually opt for low-carb, low-sugar options. Any time I have to resort to \\"fast\\" or quick-service food, my options are severely limited. Even so-called \\"healthy\\" places usually aren't as great for you as they advertise (looking at you, Panera.) SO, the fact that PowerHouse offers a big menu with a great variety and all of it really is healthy just makes my day. \\n\\nNot only is it healthy enough that I'm pretty sure my CrossFit coach would approve (I had to toss in the CrossFit part because if I don't mention it, my workout doesn't count), but it's super tasty. I normally hate tabouleh because it's often made with too much wheat and thus too dry. NOT THIS VERSION! It's basically all herbs, and it's so refreshing. I got the Powerhouse Salad with tuna and OMG the tuna. I should mention that I can't do boring tuna like those super-fit people do. You won't find me mixing up tuna + avocado in my spare time. I like the mayo-and-relish kind of tuna salad. That being said, their tuna is nothing like that and yet AMAZING. It was full of shredded carrots which added a light freshness to it and I'm pretty sure it didn't have any mayo. \\n\\nI also grabbed a Good Karma smoothie on my way out - mango, strawberries, and peanut butter. So tasty. Such a huge smoothie. \\n\\nThe -1 star is because it's a little spendy and while the salad was a good size, I still felt I needed a little something extra (hence the smoothie) afterwards. The smoothies are BIG though, which also contributes to the -1 star... I wish they offered a smaller size. \\n\\nThe staff seems like they're all family and were super friendly and accommodating, despite it being hectic in there.

People were forming a rather unmanageable crowd in the waiting area & you don't really know if they were waiting to leave or falling in line because the host/hostess were situated a distance away from the greeting area where you can't see them. When we were finally seated in the Hibachi table, the ambience was rather loud & chaotic. The space was limited, the tables were so closed together that you compete sound space with the neighboring diners.  A little music would have set a more somber mood. Soup is standard clear beef broth; salad comes only with the ginger dressing (both pretty good but nothing extraordinary). They also served both noodles & rice, the previous was oily & a little bland, would have preferred a double serving of rice (if I were given a choice). Ordered lobster & beef, both were cooked perfectly to my preference. My friend ordered chicken & beef but had to wait for both until the very end (and had to contend with eating some of the rice/noodles in the next 45 mins-1 hour or so because the chef cooked the vegetables, lobster, & shrimp--in this order-- first). Most Asians, me included, often prefer to have some sort of viand to accompany our rice/noodles which came a little late for his meal,  but then again he's White (and chef was from Turkey) so both didn't really care.  Also, like most Hibachi places I've been to, ventilation is poor so expect to smell like smoke after you leave. \\n\\nSynopsis: Traditional Hibachi place, don't expect anything exciting (including the cook's \\"tricks\\" & crude jokes unless, of course, if it's your first time in such a place)."},{"name":"Cactus Club Cafe","address":"1085 Canada Place","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4","text":"This is a great restaurant and location.

I am a foodie and fan of the Top Chef show, so my visit to Boston was not going to go without a visit to this restaurant. I went in the middle of the day, after the lunch hour in hopes that the chef would be in. She was not and the entire restaurant was closed due to a private party leaving only the take out option. I spoke with ther manger, Emma, who was very kind and understanding; really she was fantastic and attentive.  I'm not going to lie, this still made me a little upset and I didn't know what I was going to do. I ended up going on a walk to Fenway park. The famous ball park was another must see as a lifetime baseball fan.\\n\\nI decided to go back and get the BBQ to go, strategically timing the completion of my order with the Lyft ride that I had ordered. This was to minimize the amount of time that my food, more specifically my biscuit, would have to cool off. Emma greeted me again while I was waiting, she is really great. When my food was done Emma personally delivered it to me and offered a metal fork as a \\"souvenir\\" since I was unable to meet the chef/owner (Unfortunately this fork was taken away by hotel staff while I was working the next day). This was such a nice, thoughtful touch to a strange dining situation. I ordered the large platter (3 meats 2 sides) with brisket, pork belly and sausage. My side choices were the BBQ beans and potato salad. Most importantly, I also ordered the biscuit and honey butter, which is probably one of the most popular menu items. \\n\\nMy ride to the hotel only ended up being about 15 minutes. I must admit that my biscuit did not make it to the hotel, it was SO GOOD! I was quietly sitting in the back of my Lyft hoping that I wasn't being judged. My food was still warm and everything was really tasty! The pork belly was really smoky and crispy on top. The brisket had a great flavor and the sausage was very complex. The sides were good as well; the potato salad was not traditional and had a Moe refined flavor profile while the beans were fantastic in flavor but a little too hard for my liking.

If you and your staff had exercised good customer service you would have politely suggested that we can sit at another table just like your other customers were able to do. Instead, you came over to our table, and said, \\"you have to move.\\" Now, if you want to continue arguing about this that is fine.

My boyfriend and I had reservations for dinner, and we were seated right away.  There were many people milling around, either near the bar or just waiting for tables to open up.  Our table was the size of a small side table you would put in your livingroom.  For apps, we shared the Haggis and Neeps and Fall Vegetable Bridies.  Both were decent, but nothing extraordinary.  For our entrees, my BF had the Haven burger and I had a crusted salmon.  Instead of medium-rare, the burger was more medium-well (rough).  My salmon was okay, but I didn't enjoy the crust.  I think I was looking for something else from The Haven, and I just might not favor their type of food.

Unfortunately, that was not my experience in the restaurant part of Winflo tonight. I have leaving reviews that aren't 5 stars, they come so rare and in between, but tonight was really disappointing. \\nI was ecstatic when I saw that Erika Wennerstrom was going to play in the intimate \\"Listen\\" part of Winflo tonight, so I figured with my busy medical practice, my friend and I would be able to enjoy happy hour Before the show. I missed a phone call around 5pm, called back to double check if there was a problem and the gentleman that answered the phone would not confirm with me why I had a received a phone call. As time went on, I realized we were going to be about 30-45 minutes late to the reservation, so I called and let them know...I was told that it was okay and my reservation would be safe. We arrived, 45 minutes late to a cancelled reservation. The hostesses were not able to give me a reason why it was cancelled and continued to talk amongst themselves as to where to seat us...there were an abundance of tables and bar space open inside, but they seemed very annoyed and put-off by the fact that we were late, although I confirmed with someone earlier that it would be no problem. After a minute of talking amongst themselves, they offered us an outdoor table and we took it. The atmosphere of this place is great, wonderful porch, great part of Austin and awesome weather tonight. We wanted to try to snag some happy hour deals, as we had 10 minute left until it ended. We were told my hostesss that she would bring us happy hour menus to look over and she would send our waiter over to take our order. Well, she never came back and by the time our waiter came to greet us, 12 minutes after we were seated, it was passed happy hour. We asked if we could order a few items from the HH menu since we had been waiting so long, only to be told that the HH menu we had been looking at online, since the hostess never brought the hardcopy of the menu to us, was not served there anymore and we could not have two of the drinks that were offered on that menu. We were then confused and started asking questions, o oh to get the response \\"yeah, the management isn't that great, they don't update things very often\\". At this point, I just needed a drink and some food, so we ordered anyways. Polenta frieds, Misto tray and the marghertia pizza, an old fashioned and there signature margarita...the food came out before the drinks did. \\n\\nDrinks were sub-par, the ice had melted in them before they were delivered, meaning they had been sitting long enough for the ice to melt and they were watered down. Same thing happened when we ordered a second round of drinks. Food was okay, pizza could have used some fresh ground pepper, but there were no condiments in sight and no one to check to see if we needed anything until we were done eating. Misto plate was okay, blue cheese was delicious and so were the olives. Polenta fried with the marinara sauce was the highlight of the dining experience. \\n\\nAll in all on dining experience, it's one of the most disappointing places I have been In Austin since moving here a little over a year ago. I hate saying that, but it broke my heart a little since this place has some badass potential. \\n\\nQuick and easy review of the Listen Room...AMAZING and intimate and wonderful acoustics. Felt like a very sincere and romantic date, even if you're there alone. Comfortable space, great drinks and bartenders. Could not have asked for a better experience down there. The Listen Room saved this place for me, but I am more likely to go enjoy HH/dinner somewhere else before topping my night off with an intimate show here. \\n\\nHope the service gets fixed, as this was the worst part of my experience.

We had a few minutes, so we sat at the bar and ordered a pitcher of sangria. The bartender must have heard us talking about how it was her birthday, because he brought us the pitcher and also bought the three of us each a glass of champagne, which was really sweet. (I feel terrible, I should have gotten his name, but they seated us right after, and I forgot to ask!) \\n\\nThey seated the 5 of us at a six-top, and we started perusing the menu. Right after we had ordered, the manager came over and kindly asked us if we could do them a huge favor. They had a party show up that was larger than they had been expecting, and we would be saving them if we were willing to move to a different table. With no prompting from us, she offered to buy us our drinks for the evening, as well as dessert. We obviously agreed (almost like an extra b-day present!), and moved to a smaller four-top with an extra chair. The smaller table was definitely noticeable when the food started coming out, so we had to play around a lot with organizing it all, but that was about it. \\n\\nTo move on to the food, it was AMAZING! We started by each picking two dishes, and then deciding what we wanted more of.

I too, (as other Yelpers have stated) have seen this place while headed through Dripping Springs  towards Fredricksburg and Johnson City and always though it looked like a super neat little place to stop. I even scouted it out on Yelp and saw that it had good reviews. And all of the reviews are true - it's cute, it's quaint, it has a lovely garden, extra parking in the back, art for sale all over and fantastically delish salads, sandwiches, pastries, cakes, and coffee. So what happened to those last two stars? \\n\\nUnfortunately my Mom and I came in after visiting the Vintage Market Days this last Friday. Friday, I know, during the week - it was around 1pm so the lunch crowd should have died out. Apparently everyone had the same idea that we did, though. After the market, hit up Thyme & Dough. There was a line from the counter to the door - they were slammed. How bad could it be? We thought to ourselves. The line moved at a moderate to slow pace and the cashiers kept up for the most part. The price for that though, was once you got up there, they were a little short and everything was hurried. While the line was a little shortened after our lunch, my Mom actually went back up to grab some cookies to go and by then the whole ordering process - just for pastries was curt. \\n\\nFor our lunches, I had the Combination Salad with Tuna - it was more than amazing. Fresh lettuces, fresh diced apples, an amply large scoop of tuna salad in the middle, slices of provolone, and balsamic on the side. Loved it. My Mom had the Turkey in Thyme sandwich on Gluten Free bread, (thank you for having GF bread - and it was good, unlike others!) and loved her sandwich as well. We both also got the Hibiscus Tea and for some reason it was horribly bitter - not great.\\n\\nThe biggest issue I had here was that we waited for a VERY long time for our food. When we sat down with our letter on a stick, (their table marking mechanism) we saw tons of people sitting with no food. I think we waited around a half hour. Food was rolling out, but they were very obviously behind.\\n\\nSo you see, I'm very split. There are so many obviously fantastic things that are going on here, and I get that they were super slammed. I think this craft fair like happens all summer though, I think this was their last hurrah of the season so I'm sort of baffled as to why this place seemed unprepared.

I feel like bad tasting kim chee at a Korean restaurant is almost as bad as bad rice at a Japanese restaurant.\\n\\nWhile the quality/taste of the meat isn't the BEST I've tasted, its okay and about average price for Korean bbq.  The marinated beef was not the tastiest I've had, but it more than satisfied my Korean bbq cravings.

I would recommend if you don't have much of an appetite and you're going with only one other person to save some money and order ala carte.  The combination turned out to be way too much food for us. \\n\\nThe service was really good.  This is probably the 20+th time I've gone to a Korean bbq place and I've never really had anything (the meats or side dished explained) and the waitress took the time to explain everything in detail for me and a coworker who had never eaten Korean food/bbq ever.

This Mexican restaurant came highly recommended to me by a variety of compadres, Yelpers and non-Yelpers alike.  The Tucker location was the location everyone seemed to talk about, so I visited with Christopher P. as my \\"local\\" guide.\\n\\nTaqueria Los Hermanos looks and feels like any typical suburban Mexican chain restaurant.  It's located in the same strip mall as Publix on Hugh Howell Rd.  If facing Publix, the restaurant is on your left.  This restaurant is very popular, especially with families in the neighborhood, so expect the place to be packed with folks of all ages during peak times on the weekends.  They've tried to cram as many seats as comfortably possible in here, so when the restaurant is at capacity, it gets quite cozy (and also loud).  Seating consists mostly of tables with a few TVs playing ESPN interspersed throughout.\\n\\nMany claim Taqueria Los Hermanos as *the* best Mexican restaurant in Atlanta.  I haven't tried enough here to make that determination yet, but what I have tried was pretty darn good.  The restaurant serves the usual Mexican salads, nachos, soups, quesadillas, tacos, burritos, taquitos, and more.  Taco selection looks respectable and seems pretty authentic.  Tacos are about $3 each, burritos $8-9 each.\\n\\nWhere to focus your attention on, though, is the specials menu.  At dinnertime, specials include seafood such as salmon salad, trout sauteed with artichoke hearts, mixed grilled seafood platters and burritos (shrimp, scallops, tilapia, calamari, etc.) and other national specialties like pork adobado (slices of pork marinated in spicy green tomatillo sauce).  I'm not sure I've seen these kinds of dishes at any other Mexican restaurant in Atlanta, so it is unique.  Specials are a bit more expensive, ranging in price from $11-17 per entree.  It's worth it, however, as the portion sizes are ginormous.\\n\\nI heard the tamales are awesome here, so that's what I ordered.  They have two kinds of tamales here: (1) \\"Mama's original recipe\\" - spicy red chicken tamale + spicy green pork tamale with Mexican rice and black charro bean soup and (2) Brisket tamales - roasted and smoked beef brisket tamales served with lentil soup and sauteed spinach.  I went with #2 ($13.25) because our server said the brisket is better than the \\"original\\" recipe.  Christopher P. ordered the original recipe and it looked just as delicious.  I personally don't think you can go wrong with either one.\\n\\nFor the uninitiated, tamales are leaf wraps which contain masa (corn-based dough) and other fillings.  In my case, beef brisket.  You'll have to unfold the leaf wrap to find all the tasty goodness inside.  Be careful unfolding as the tamales are served steaming hot out of the kitchen.  The brisket wasn't the most tender in the world, but it was savory and hearty enough.  The meat had been pulled into thick chunks.  Thicker than most BBQ joints would pull it.  The masa was delectable.  With chips, salsa, lentil soup, and any other sides or apps you may have ordered, downing two tamales (two tamales comes with each order) can be a tall task.  You might want to take one home.  They taste almost as good when heated up in the microwave.\\n\\nThe lentil soup paired with the brisket tamales was surprisingly refreshing and appetizing.  Good, well-rounded flavor and appetizing consistency.  Complimentary chips and salsa felt and tasted pretty standard for the most part.  The salsa does have its own distinct taste, smokier than I'm accustomed to.  We also got an order of their cheese dip with jalapenos.  Good stuff.\\n\\nService was fantastic despite the restaurant being slammed.  The restaurant is staffed well and they know how to handle a crowd.  Good for them.  Our orders came out from the kitchen in a reasonable amount of time.\\n\\nBased on just one visit, I can see why people think this is the best Mexican restaurant in metro Atlanta.  I'd like to come back and try more dishes.  If you're a Mexican food aficionado, then I think Taqueria Los Hermanos is worth the drive."},{"name":"The Haven","address":"2 Perkins St","city":"Jamaica Plain","stars":"4.5","text":"This place is great.

I shall be back!"},{"name":"Stauf's Coffee Roasters","address":"1277 Grandview Ave","city":"Columbus","stars":"4","text":"Stauf's Coffee is hit-or-miss, unfortunately.\\n\\nDon't get me wrong: I love coffee, and I love bucking the establishment every now and then; but Stauf's -- in all its kitsch and hipster glory -- is in truth one part genuine and one part niche consumerism.\\n\\nI'm not trying to piss on anyone's gate, but good coffee is easy. I can get it anywhere (in fact, I know how to make it, myself); so let's nudge the altogether \\"expected\\" quality and selection of Stauf's aside for a moment. Instead, let's talk staff, non-coffee products, and atmosphere. (I've never tried their deli stuff, as a note.)\\n\\nThere is a 50% chance your particular Stauf's representative is either sleepy or outright stoned (albeit endearingly). Fact is: it *would* be charming, if it hadn't increased my wait time significantly on several occasions. I don't get bent out of shape if I have to remind someone that I still need my drink -- but I also don't like doing it.\\n\\nThe coffee and tea (beans and leaves) are overpriced. Going off of memory, you'll actually pay more for a pound of mid-range Stauf's than you will for a comparable Starbucks pound. Say whatever you want about local products and organic this-or-that; but I'm living in a down economy, dude. Taking a quick glance around at the various coffee-support products scattered about will give you an even sharper case of sticker-shock. Bring some disposable income if you plan on buying anything with \\"moving parts\\" or \\"steel\\" in the description.\\n\\n...and we circle back around to atmosphere. I know an establishment can't help who frequents it -- to a degree; but Stauf's clearly appeals to the \\"hip, young, Forrest-gump-feather-in-the-breeze\\" self-assured intellectuals of Columbus. This, to a politically moderate, 29-year-old professional, is sort of alienating. Perhaps it's only in my head, but there is a subtle pretension and smugness in the air. \\n\\nIn any case, I know many folks will fit right in at Stauf's -- and for a number of reasons. The coffee *is* good, and the chain is locally owned. Double-plus, on those counts. Like I said, however, I've never been blown away by the service, and pricing seems to be a bit inflated (especially for accessories). Don't avoid Stauf's, by any means (unless you're a conservative. You will burst into blue flames)."},{"name":"Taqueria La Fuente","address":"12198 SW Main St","city":"Tigard","stars":"4","text":"My husband and I WERE going to a different taqueria down the street a ways (will not name) but will probably not go there any more since finding Taqueria La Fuente.\\n\\nNo, they don't have a Taco Tuesday special, BUT the prices are still pretty reasonable.

We go on an off day to avoid the rush and required reservation needed on Fri/Sat, but still go around dinner time (5pm-ish). \\nFirst, the parking lot is tiny and very dangerous pulling in/out of. Be careful around rush hour. \\nSecond, the tiny parking lot  was packed, but there were only 3 other people in the entire Guest Area. They were in the patio for happy hour and had w/their dogs with them. Maybe their dog's drove there. I don't know? That being said...\\nThird, no one greeted us, no one showed us to our table, nor provided menus, utensils, napkins, nor a simple drink order like water for starters. We literally had to show ourselves to the patio, get the menus (etc), had time to use the men's room, and finally after about 10 mins, a waiter came to check on us. Seriously, we could've robbed the joint and no one would've noticed.\\n \\nThe waiter was very nice, so kudos on that, but it all went slightly nowhere from there.\\n\\nThe food was ok but really nothing even close special, or to say \\"Hey, I think I'll go back and try something else just to see what happens.\\" Nope, not this guy or my Mgr! And having ordered pricier dishes from the menu (about $15 each), you'd think the more expensive they are, the better. Nope! Yea the chips and salsa were good and so was the flan (so I heard b/c I gave it away) but the \\"meat&potatoes\\" of the meal was mediocre at best. \\n(Please note: I'm Hispanic and grew up on Mexican/TexMex Food...

BUT, I'm fair when it comes to judging this particular category of food which ranges from Grandmas in the kitchen to friends from Europe that make Spanish Rice and Mole for the first time in their lineage)\\n\\nIn conclusion, because we read a lot of good reviews and heard the urban legends coming from people that commute daily on S Lamar, the place was built up a bit and it sounded like a place worthy of a celebration or special event (or even taking a first date to which I almost did the weekend before), but sadly, I was really embarrassed w/the turn out. We ended up picking at our entrees, over-payed for sub par side dishes you can get at Taco Cabana or Chuy's, and left with a rather empty/disappointed/blah feel that made you wish you didn't waste the time/gas to get there in the first place, nor place your life in danger w/Southbound rush hour traffic. \\nI even waited a few weeks to write this just so I don't provide an emotionally charged review, but not even that made it easier to leave kinder words."},{"name":"Gigi's Cafe","address":"6320 SW Capitol Hwy","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"I have been here a few times and while the food is consistently great the service is hit or miss..

The Yuzu gives the typical heavy and salty Ramen broth a citrus and tangy flavor. It borderlines becoming almost a Thai dish. \\n\\nTonkotsu Shio - Creamy and decadent are just some of the words that can describe this dish - imagine Shin Ramen Black but x1,000,000. The pork broth has a richness and depth which makes every sip sinful. The noodles are think and cooked to have the \\"QQ\\" texture. The Chasu is thinly sliced so that it will melt in your mouth. The soft boiled tea egg is cooked perfectly with the yolk slightly runny. I can go on and on about each component of the dish, but it's better if you just order it. \\n\\nButa Gyoza - I'm a huge proponent of thin skin dumplings and Afuri has some of the thinnest skins. Not only are the skins thin, Afuri is still able to get that nice crunchy layer. The most interesting thing about the dish is probably the presentation as it's is served in a pin wheel fashion, bottom side up.\\n\\n\\nWhat I've learned from my brief stay is Portland is that the city does beer, coffee, and Asian food very well. Being a cold and rainy day, ramen definitely came to our mind. Afuri being close by, we decided to try it out. Straightaway, Afuri is not a esoteric ramen joint where there is only Japanese staff, this is more of the millennial hipster place with full sleeve tattoos, Scandanavaian-esque interior, and Western staff. Albeit Afuri checks all the marks for being trendy, the food is amazing. \\n\\nAfuri space is minimal and stark. It follows the adaptive reuse design trend which combines exposing the old structure of the building and contrasts it with clean minimal wood furniture. In this case, the wood furniture are the large communal wood tables. It's notable that the seating arrangements at Afuri are either counter/bar seating or \\"beer hall\\" style tables. A great feature of the space are the large windows, absence of walls (open kitchen), and high ceilings which make the space feel much larger than it is. \\n\\nWhen it comes to ramen, I'm all about the broth and noodles. Afuri has some of the most interesting and flavorful broths and the most \\"QQ\\" noodles. Reading the \\"About\\" section of Afuri, they pride there selection to open in Portland due to the \\"soft water\\" and the ecosystem being similar to that of the Afuri mountain in Japan. I usually take these self written theses with a grain of salt, but if \\"soft water\\" makes Ramen taste this good, I'm on the \\"soft water\\" band wagon.\\n\\nAfuri is some of the best ramen I have ever had. My consensus is the \\"Portlanders\\" who rate this place low just tells me that this city must have some of the highest expectations when it comes to food.

Yep, it's all fried, but they're really the perfect complement when you're drinking away on a weekday night.\\n\\nThe scorpion bowl was a blend of fruity juices--I could barely tell it was alcoholic, but the sound of my heartbeat and the massive spinning of my head told me otherwise.  The bartender saw that we were celebrating a birthday and gave me a free shot, trying--and failing--to light the top on fire; instead of chucking it down as I should, I actually tasted the alcohol on the most sensitive part of my tongue--gross!  To remedy, I dug into the crab rangoons, one of the worst inventions in food: fried dough and cream?  Might as well as call it heart attack rangoons.\\n\\nAnd why four stars?

If you could imagine eating mediocre (at least at this point in time) grub in the nicest of bungalows with unenthusiastic individuals roaming around, easily perturbed, then you might be dining at this new spot.\\n\\nFor starters, miscommunication encompassed our entire dinner. The hostess said that we could sit outside at one of the non-servicable four tables and order food from the bar to take back to our table; weird concept, but it sure sounds easy enough. As we order at the bar, the bartender says, \\"I can't handle this\\" and proceeds to call over another person to help her. I presume you should not admit to the customer that you are inadequate to do the task at hand.\\n\\nUpon ordering, two of the four at our table receive water and silverware. The other two did not get asked the entire meal if they would like water, even as they were refilling the two glasses already at the table. The worst mishap took place 45 minutes into the meal: my friend placed his order along with the group, yet his order actually never got sent into the kitchen. They expedited his food, so as to provide some saving grace.\\n\\nI understand that you do not provide top-notch service to the outlying four tables--while the lower outdoor tables actually necessitate reservations--but I would have liked a manager to have touched base at some point in the evening to check in on us. Maybe we just kept getting overlooked as four young guys, not aptly dressed.\\n\\nThe closing of the tab provided a final mess to end the evening.

As we waited for our group, a car that was waiting on 6th to enter just darted off, as the narrow two-lane valet area is just plain messy.\\n\\nAs you can tell, many a kink prevent Winflo from being the restaurant it wants to be, but perhaps with time, much restructuring, and far better service, they can come into their own.

True to the city it calls home, CBC's products, like other Cantabridgians (yes, that's what you call someone from Cambridge), they are often complex, cerebral, fun, and often odd and off-beat. I'm not sure, but they're probably also registered democrats (not saying that's good or bad, just if beers could choose a party affiliation...). I've had a whole mess of pretty cutting edge or otherwise unheard of beers here. They serve them in individal glasses, pitchers and the mythical beer towers that have gone extinct over in Boston and its burbs (Yes, Allston/Brighton IS in Boston). The more the merrier, but I think you need at least 2 people at a table per pitcher or 4 per tower. Why don't you do it? It's actually fairly cheap for their high quality suds (in a pitcher you're looking at around $4 to $6.50 per beer depending on the selection and I guarantee they'll be better than what you get for the same price out of just about any other tap in a 20 mile radius). Oh and don't be afraid to ask for a sample before you try out that 3-year barrel aged sour cherry barley wine or other concoction that sounds funky but maybe a little too funky for your liking- they'll be happy to bring you one on the house. Hell, I've seen 'em basically do free tasting flights for people, but I'm not that grubby.\\n\\n But don't let the name fool you! While the beer often takes center stage for me it does in fact share the spot light!

Began with the Starter special - fried mushrooms with pickled ranch dressing - and a mixed green salad. There was an assorted mix of mushrooms, served with tiny slices of sweet pickle, garnished with a rough chop of sorrel & accompanied by a dill-tasting ranch dip. My dining companion doesn't care for mushrooms, yet enjoyed these; they had just the right crunch on the outside, yet retained that burst of mushroom flavor when bitten into. The salad had a smoky tomato taste & the greens were fresh with a varied assortment of them. We followed the starters with Steak & Frites & Sea Bass. Without a blink our server asked if \\"medium rare\\" was all right for the steak (which in my mind, is the only temperature for a cooked cut of steak (although my Mom would argue for rare every time!)) The steak had a bit of wood grilled flavor, a charred outer crust & was served as recommended; medium rare. While flavorful, I believe the frites could have had just a bit more crunch to them.  The sea bass was expertly seared, the beets golden, quartered & paired with sweet & fresh oranges cut supreme. We believed the majority of our dishes paired best with white so ordered a bottle of a vin de savoie. We finished our meal with an order of their Beignets & Blue Cheese Pots de Creme.  The beignets were warm, light & dusted with enough powdered sugar to 'dip' into after each bite. The blue cheese pots de creme was incredible. My dining companion doesn't like pots de creme & blue cheese is her least favorite cheese...she said \\"two negatives make a positive which must be why this dish is fu(;ing amazing\\"!  I agree; the blue cheese pots de creme was indeed amazing; the flavor lightly sweet & the mouthfeel soft & creamy.

Not even close to being worth $8, but tasty none the less.\\n\\nLast night were were going to a Christmas concert (TSO) at Roger's arena and had time for a quick appy and drinks. We wandered around the area a bit and decided on Library Square.\\n\\nWe found a seat right away near the Foosball table. At first our waitress seemed quick and attentive, but things steadily began to go downhill. \\n\\nWe all ordered an appy/small plate at the exact same time as our drinks, so as to be speedy. Our drinks came out quickly, tasted good and we had some time for a Foosball game while we waited for our food. 3 of the 4 plates were brought out, leaving my boyfriend  waiting for his food. My friends started eating, and I picked at my spring rolls as he waited for his poutine. I figured our waitress was just making a couple of trips, but when she came back empty handed to check on us, I was concerned. We asked where his fries were and she just said \\"they're coming.\\" It would have been nice if she'd apologized for the delay. It's rude to serve 3/4 of the table and leave someone without their food.\\n\\nI excused myself to the bathroom, and figured his food would be there by the time I got back. Nope, but our bill was! It was messed up, so she changed it around a bit. Still didn't apologize that his food STILL hadn't come, even after I pointed it out a second or third time.\\n\\nFinally the fries came and Shane had to scarf them down so that we wouldn't be late for our show.  We paid, opted not to leave a tip and decided not to return in the future.\\n\\nIf the kitchen messes up and forgets to make someones food, that's fine. Own up to it. The waitress is the \\"ambassador\\" for the kitchen, and they all work together to make up a team. The cook isn't going to come out and apologize for missing an order, so she kind of is expected to say something. If she had have just apologized for the delay and had a better, more polite attitude, we would have understood and not thought a thing of it. \\n\\nSorry Library Square, but your food and drinks are overpriced, your staff is borderline rude. I'll be going somewhere else next time I'm in the area. I'm sure you won't miss me, as you and the other Donnelly public houses SOMEHOW rack in a lot of business despite your reputations.

Their standard offerings for all of their basic meals is bland and lackluster. The pita only comes with a slice of tomato, lettuce, and meat. Anything else will cost a minimum of 9.99 in their combo meal, which does allow you to add more items. Still, compare this to buying a pita at Hubby Bubbly for 5.99 where you get meat, hummus, and a ton of toppings. If you get falafel instead of meat, the price even drops to 4.99. I am not affiliated with Hubby Bubbly in any way (I just have delicious dreams about their falafel hummus bowls). I am using them as an example of a better competitor in the same cuisine style.

They offer an all you can eat shabu buffet all day on Mondays, and from 11am-4pm Saturdays and Sundays for $31.95.\\n\\nFiguring we could not consume enough meat, veggies, carbs and sweets to be worth the pricetag, we opted instead for bowls of ramen and some chicken wings.\\n\\nI selected their ORIGINAL TONKOTSU (PORK) RAMEN $14.00 (Soup noodles topped with char-shu pork, mushrooms, menma, scallions, nori, black sesame garlic oil, and a soft-boiled egg), while the spicy eater picked the SPICY TONKOTSU RAMEN $15.00 (Soup noodles topped with char-shu pork, mushrooms, menma, scallions, nori, black sesame garlic oil, and a soft-boiled egg).  The only difference was the dollop of spicy red sauce for an extra buck.\\n\\nThe generous portion of pork were sliced char-shu (Chinese roast pork) which were tasty yet rather commonplace in impression given my household's tendency to stock up on it weekly as some households do deli meats.\\n\\nThey let us mix up the chicken wings $5.75 for 4 pieces, so we got two spicy and two sweet soy.

I had a very favorable impression then, thought it was an undiscovered gem with extremely reasonable prices and delicious foods.  Under the same impression of cheap Mexican food, I insisted that we eat here for dinner.  \\n\\n1.5 years later, it was definitely busier, had almost a full deck of customers, cold margaritas and seemed promising although I did notice one red flag.  This very reasonably-priced hidden gem, now bustling with customers, had a special entree listed on their chalkboard for $15.99.  WHAT? Mexican food?\\n\\nBasically, the entire menu sports appetizers and entrees with the majority in the $10-15 range, which is more expensive than its competitors in the same South Austin region.  Beyond that, the interior and decor leave much to be desired, so I assumed perhaps the food would make up for it.  Not so.  The quality of the ingredients really were lacking as well.\\n\\nIn sum, you walk up thinking that you will get reasonably priced Mexican food in South Austin or at least get what you pay for, and you  leave feeling unsatisfied and taken advantage of.

Poorly executed.\\n\\nThe food itself is great. It takes all of 2 minutes to prepare it and you can get it to go or eat there. Three different primary options, the piada which is an Italian burrito, pasta bowl or a salad bowl. Pick your meat and toppings and you're all set. There is also the option of getting a side salad or cup of soup although it does not appear that you can order those individually. A (small) glass of wine is $1.25 and the cheapest drink on the menu.\\n\\nThat's the concept and it sounds great. Here's the almost complete failure to execute. The menu board is installed so that you read it from right to left (the way the line moves) but that is not very clear. The menu is not visible from the starting point because the vent hood is in the way so you have to walk past it, get out of line and then come back and explain to the other people that you aren't really cutting. If you want to add a cup of soup or a side salad, the menu shows that as the very last step but you apparently have to order it up front. And guess what? There's no upselling or reminding.\\n\\nCustomer service is atrocious. The customer in front of me was told that he couldn't add a salad without starting over and getting in line again thus turning a customer begging to spend more into an upset customer. I was only able to get a cup of soup after having told them that I did, in fact, tell the guy at the beginning and saw my soup waiting but they gave it to another customer. They don't have a better system other than smashing all of the food together at the end of the line so the cashier is constantly sorting it out. We ordered the glass of wine and then were asked if we were dining in or carrying out.\\n\\nOverall, the concept is great and the food was good but I'm not sure it is worth having to deal with employees who would fit right in to some government bureaucracy than a business."},{"name":"Flyers Wings & Grill","address":"5621 W Colonial Dr","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"Good wings, blue cheese cups are smaller than a shot glass, our server never came back or even gave us our check.

With so many to choose from, yet these little joints still always manage to be FULL. We initially wanted to go to another ramen place, somewhere, tried-and-true where we knew we would get a hot hearty broth. The line up there was out the door (can you guess where?) and with the temperature plummeted to freezing, frankly I didn't want ramen that bad.  \\n\\nhttp://www.coffeefoodies.com\\n\\n\\nThere has to be some another! Something new (not that new now since they've been in operations for some time) we haven't tried. Motomachi Shokudo, located a few stores down was actually not that busy.\\n\\n \\n\\n\\nIt must be a common d√©cor genre for ramen places to resemble the actual environment in Japan. Ramen joints in Nippon are all small and crammed. Motomachi is no exception. Although cutely decorated in wood bar tables, common long table, and rustic industrial painted concrete walls, the wooden stools were uncomfortable and not enough coat hangers to stash belongings.\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\nCuisine: Japanese, Ramen\\nPrice/Entr√©e: $10 - $15\\n \\nOut of 5... (1: Don't bother -- 5: Excellent)\\nFood: 4\\nService: 3.5\\nAmbiance: 2.5\\nOverall: 3\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe sticker price for a bowl was somewhat pricey - average $11.95 for a bowl. Perhaps this has to do with ramen noodles imported from Nippon Trends in San Jose instead of made in-house or simply located in the West End.\\n\\n \\n\\nShio Ramen $8.95\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\nLight flavourful broth. It is not as salty and loaded with MSG as some other places. Thin ramen noodles cooked al dente. Comes with chashu and corn.\\n\\n \\n\\nSpicy Miso Ramen with Organic Chicken $11.95\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDespite the tasty spicy broth, this ramen bowl does not come with the usual chashu pork slices and ajitama soft boiled egg. You may order them as an addition. Chicken bits are somewhat dry but well seasoned. The chilli oil drizzled shredded onions, corn, and lotus roots were a nice for it added texture to the noodle bowl. The noodles used here are slightly thicker compared to the shio ramen; the reason for this? I have no idea. Cooked al dente. The Onsen egg was delicious with the gel-like yolk.\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\nBamboo-Charcoal Dark Miso Ramen\\n\\nSomewhat newer to the whole \\"ramen\\" scene in Canada, is the play of use charcoal. The \\"cleansing\\" agent (traditional to Kyoto dishes) said to absorb toxins from the body; adds a smoky grey tint to the miso flavoured broth. This bowl is richer and slightly saltier when compared to the shio.\\n\\n \\n\\n\\nAt first glance you may wonder why Motomachi lacks a selection of Tonkostu broths as so many would jump to conclude.\\n\\nThis is the healthier alternative when Chef Daiji Matsubara decided to opt his concoction in a chicken-broth based for a lighter, less oily soup, and lower fat content. However, this is not the only reason. Motomachi is actually a sister restaurant to the Kintaro. Therefore, if you're looking for the Tokyo style tonkotsu pork based soup is shio (salt), shoyo (soy sauce) , or miso; whichever that may tickle your fancy, please hop over to Kintaro!"},{"name":"Shiraz Grill","address":"6427 Westwood Blvd","city":"Orlando","stars":"2.5","text":"This was a great, underappreciated gem in the heart of Orlando's tourist district.

The prices of their food is a constant deterrent, I have yet to locate the bathroom in all that hustle and bustle (although even if I did, I don't think I would ever leave my stuff unattended here), and for some reason, I always come here when there are crowds of young (read: the rude kind) college kids.

The food is still great but the today I had a very bad service experience with the waiter.\\n\\nMy wife asked for a lemon drop and I asked for fizzy lemonade. I've been coming for years and they have this amazing bubbly lemonade.  My wife said \\"Please, the lemon drop low in alcohol\\".  And I said jokingly \\"Yes, my lemonade very low in alcohol too\\" with a big smile on my face.  I thought it was an obvious joke but the waiter looked at me puzzled and my wife jumped in and said \\"He's joking, lemonades don't have alcohol\\" and I said \\"Yes, it's a joke\\". My intention was to make her smile because she looked so serious and she replied \\"Well, I'm busy\\".  I thought that was odd as the restaurant is 70% empty and it's a hot day (97F).  The restaurant does not have AC, which actually, I like that, good for earth.\\n\\nA few minutes later she came back and told my wife I just noticed they put ice on your lemon drop, is that ok? My wife \\"no, please change it\\".  She went back to change it and I drank from my lemonade and I noticed, it's not bubbly.  She comes back with something that looked like a lemon drop (right type of glass, sugar around the rim of the glass and no ice), believe me, the first version looked like a lemonade in a lemonade glass.  My wife tried the lemon drop and she was pretty unimpressed but I'll leave it at. I told our waiter that my lemonade did not have bubbles and she said I asked for a lemonade which then, I asked my wife, who was in front of me when I ordered \\"What did I say?\\", and she replied \\"You said fizzy lemonade\\". She wanted to argue a bit more and she replied \\"That's why I repeated back and said lemonade\\", what she does not know is that I've coming for years and when waiter usually replies back \\"lemonade\\" and they bring the right one, and then she added \\"I did not hear you\\".  At that point I had it and said \\"yeah, you did not hear me when I made the joke, and you did not hear me about the lemonade, so no more jokes, let's keep it really serious and lots of tension, that's why I come here\\". She apologized profusely and she left.  Then, she came back wit a second version of the lemonade and she left.  I tried it and still no bubbles. At that point, I took the lemonade myself to the guy serving the drinks and I said \\"Please, a lemonade with bubbles\\" and he he said, \\"oh ok, I was not there, so I could not hear\\". He brought the lemonade back (3rd time), and although I could not see the bubbles as in previously lemonades I had here, now I could at least feel a fizzy taste when I drank it I said \\"Yeah, it's good\\".  This guy said \\"yeah, you just wanted soda water with the lemonade\\", and replied \\"exactly\\".\\n\\nOur initial waiter did not come back to the table anymore.  Other service personnel brought the rest of the food and it was really good, like always.\\n\\nIn the end, I left 20% tip for two reasons.  Our waiter, she was stressed, it was really hot and perhaps she was having a bad day, so my compassion kicked in.  Perhaps, she's not even paid fairly, who knows? I have no idea but this Yelp review is not to get her in trouble but to make management aware that there are some issues and it would be awesome if they addressed them.  I typically see issues in service as management is not doing something right, so don't take it on the workers and just figure out what they need to be successful to have a smile on their face, so they're happy to work there.

Compared to that, Toji fell short on a couple fronts, but not by much. \\n\\nFirst and foremost: the banchan. I've never had the kimchee cucumber or the peppered bean sprouts before, which I throughly enjoyed. The thin strips of white radish were also very refreshing and the perfect palate cleanser. The only banchan I didn't like was the potato, which was just sticky with over-sweet syrup. My main issue with the banchan was that it wasn't served right away and that there weren't more varieties and more of it! \\n\\nI ate the \\"Dolsot Bulgogi\\" with Tofu. I wasn't expecting a soup, I thought it was going to be like bibimbap in the clay pot but with noodles instead of rice. Basically the dish was \\"japchae\\" but in soup. It was pretty good, as most things hot and fresh are. The broth was like a milder version of sweet and sour soup, but after a while I could start to feel the sugar building up in the back of my throat. It almost felt like I had a sore throat! The dish definitely could have used some more spice and a few more vegetables to add some color and variety. \\n\\nIf I come back to Toji for anything, it'll be to just try the \\"Big Bibimbap\\". For four dollars more you get basically a bathtub of rice and vegetables. It's enough to stuff 2 people well. As far as bang for your buck goes, it's a Big Bang. \\n\\nI'll stick to Nak Won though.

Barely, just barely, slid under the wire and got our drinks at happy hour price.  The Ciclista - Stash IPA with a bit of limonata, kind of an Italian shandy - was refreshing and delicious.  Lemon went surprisingly well with the herbal hops of the IPA.\\n\\nThe meal commenced with some small bites - piccoli piatti, as they are called.

Last time I got some kind of chicken enchilada dish (came with white cheese goo) that I was not that thrilled with (it was not very hot temp-wise), but after reading more, we decided to split the brisket tamale plate, and we got an extra soup (probably did not need it).\\n\\nThe lentil soup and shrimp/corn chowder are both excellent. The tamale plate also comes with sauteed spinach, which was basic (fresh) sauteed spinach.  I like greens, so I was fine with it.  \\n\\nThe tamales are huge and tasty.  I do think that they could spice it up a bit with some red sauce (like those at the buhi farmers market) or a slightly hot rub, but they were still good.  I realize that this is the Tucker/Lilburn area, and by default nothing is going to have a lot of heat.\\n\\nThe rice was fine, the beans average, not bad, not addictive.  The soups and tamales made the meal.  \\n\\nI think that this place is more of a 'plate' type of restaurant than a typical taqueria (where the specialty is very quickly made Mexican street-type food).  Thus, I'm not surprised that there's no salsa bar, and I'm not sure if they have room for such.  \\n\\nMy only gripes are that they need to build out a vestibule to keep  the cold air out, and they need to bring out two salsas to larger tables.

We have been loyal customers of Musashino for over 20+ years and are regulars of this place.  \\n\\nThe food here is consistently good.  Everything from appetizers tempura to sushi meals, to udon and noodles are consistently good.  They have a nice variety of choices including traditional sushi, rolls, to dinner plates for those who don't eat sushi.  Sushi itself is usually very fresh and good.  They are more traditional sushi style restaurant than others in town and that appeals to us.  \\n\\nThe service however is inconsistent.  Sometimes, service is excellent and other times, you were wondering when your water glasses are going to be filled.  And normally, we chalk it up to a bad night for server, chef, whoever and we're pretty forgiving.  But the incident a few nights ago, really turned us off.  \\n\\nWe arrived early but the restaurant was full.  The bar had some seating but seats weren't all together.  I asked the hostess if it was ok to split our party into a single and a 2 person group.  She said no problem.  We walked to the bar and as we take our seats, the host, a different person runs up up and says, we can't sit there and that they can't split our party and that their hostess was new and didn't know anything about restaurant policy.  I told the host that it would be like them serving 2 separate parties with 2 checks.  He said no.  You can't do that.  It's restaurant policy.  REALLY????!!!!  I can't make it any easier for them.  Filling their bar seats and doing 2 separate checks, so it's not confusing for the server.   This is completely an unacceptable level of service. \\n\\nWe definitely didn't ask for anything out of the ordinary.  But as loyal customers, we do expect good service.  This WAS NOT service.  Needless to say, we left.  Austin is full of really great restaurants eager to accept our money in return for good food and good service.  And we took advantage of that swiftly.  We headed to another restaurant a few minutes away, where we were welcomed warmly, served quickly and service was excellent.\\n\\nLike I mentioned. We love this place.

You can't go wrong with the Lapu Lapu, Jet Pilot, Cobra's Fang, Fogcutter, Lava Flow, Navy Grog, Mai Tai, Lei Lenai Volcano, and the almighty Zombie Punch ($9-$14). They offer a great mix of classic/authentic tiki cocktails and equally delicious inventions of the bar staff that are destined to be classics. The drink menu helpfully lays out drink strengths so you can pace your inebriation throught the course of the night (they limit two Zombies per customer, with good reason!). And that says nothing about the incredible selection of rums the place boasts! \\n\\nThe food's better than your standard pub fare, and there's something for everyone - carnivores, vegetarians, and even those avoiding gluten. I love the Puaa Puaa Pork ($7 or $8), the Hawaiian Bread, and the Bi Bim Baap. My husband loves their Kim Chee Dogs, and the Dog specials they run on any given night. There are always specials, and they're usually worth your time and very reasonably priced.\\n\\nThe service is fantastic, too - Blair (the owner), his wife Sarah, bar manager Mindy, and chef Beth are all super friendly and fun, but Pony is by far my favorite waitress - always lively and sassy. The place has gotten popular, though, so there might be a wait, but it's totally worth it.\\n\\nNow, *that said,* as far as Portland bars go, Hale Pele ain't cheap.

Their beer list is small, but they have a good selection of local beer on draft. They also seem to have a decent selection of creative cocktails and wine. Dinner was extremely tasty from the bread to the dessert. Not a single misstep. I had the Boston clam chowder and the rare yellow-fin tuna. My fiance had a small salad and the gluten-free half chicken with whipped potatoes and veggies. The clam chowder was perfect and was garnished by a delicious crispy clam. The tuna entree was really interesting. The individual aspects of the dish were good, but when they were mixed it really elevated the meal. Cooked perfectly and complex flavors.

They serve popular korean dishes such as bulgogi, katsu (both pork and chicken), jigae, ramen, etc. and add a unique twist on them. For example, the bulgogi was served in a bowl with rice and glass noodles--a little too greasy, and is topped with a fried egg and a special sauce. Overall, the flavor of the food is as good as it gets, but the portions are slightly smaller than average. The pricing ranges from around $7-$11. \\n\\nAmbiance: K-Bop has completely remodeled the interior (and exterior, I believe), giving the space a very clean and modern feel to this restaurant. It is rustic themed and has lots of natural sunlight coming into the space (aka: good for instagram pictures). There's also plenty of seating area to accommodate both small and large parties. However, the restaurant is small and might be crowded during peak meal hours, so don't be surprised if you're elbow-to-elbow with another party. I noticed that there was a lot of bumping around due to the narrow layout of the restaurant, which made me slightly uncomfortable, but it didn't really lessen my experience! \\n\\nService: The workers are quick on their feet and the food comes out quickly. This is a self-service restaurant (pay at counter / self-seating). Also, don't forget to clean up after yourselves! \\n\\nDrinks: I didn't purchase a drink, but I noticed that many people ordered bubble tea and seemed to enjoy it. For those who don't want to purchase drinks, water jugs are placed on every table along with plastic cups. The water is flavored with fresh lemon and mint, but I believe you can ask for plain water if you'd like. \\n\\nTl;dr-- Although the portions are on the smaller side, I truly believe the food is made with quality & served promptly. Plus, you don't have to tip at the end of the meal. The atmosphere is really clean and inviting, and you can tell the business cares about the sanitation and cleanliness for customers.

Next course was the braised short rib macaroni and cheese- which was also underwhelming. Barely cheesy and just felt like something was missing. The beef short rib was pretty delectable though.

Don't get me wrong, they're both fantastic at what they do, but some people prefer the tradition to the flair. I like both, so I'm going to side with Gari on this one. The specialty rolls are a little pricier than the standard tuna or California roll, but they're also very large and you don't need to order as much. I am in love with their Double Spicy Tuna and the Crazy Monkey Maki - both can do no wrong by me. \\n\\nThe restaurant itself is teeny tiny, but at 7:30 PM on a Friday there was no trouble getting a seat.

Architects, design gurus, or novices like me will really appreciate their deliberate use of color and texture to create a real modern and bright space in which to eat. The flatware is cool and their plating methods are clever. My friend ordered a sushi platter that came with tuna salad in a martini glass stuck to the plate with a dollop of green wasabi - looked very cool. The bathroom had a sink so modern, it took me 2+ minutes to figure out where the faucet lever was. \\n\\nWe also got a rice milk Saki, served cold which was something different for me, the hot-sake-only drinker.

I also tried Kome and had departed that experience equally underwhelmed. I resigned myself to a sushi-less existence for the duration of my time living in Austin.\\n\\nEnter Musashino.\\n\\nThis place outclassed, out-cooked, and out-ambiance'd the previous two restaurants on every level. From the moment you crest the staircase you're charmed by the decor - \\"traditional\\" without being kitschy, you feel as if you've parted the plant fronds and stepped into a private little neighborhood treasure just outside Tokyo. \\n\\nFrom the moment I walked in (and was immediately seated), every single staff member acknowledged at me, smiled at me, and joked with me. I sat at the sushi counter to get a bird's eye view of the action and I'm so glad I did. Watching the chefs work and joke around with one another under the ever-watchful eye of the master chef was a joy. I brought a book along but ended up dividing my attention equally between it and the kitchen.\\n\\nThough your server will take your drink order and bring you certain elements of your meal, the sushi chefs take your order directly when you sit at the counter. My server was wonderfully friendly, efficient, attentive, and warm, as was the chef who wrote down my sushi order. My server cleared all debris from the table as it occurred, which is key when you're sitting at a sushi bar as your piece of real estate disappears very quickly otherwise. I ordered the seaweed salad and a miso soup to start, four pieces of nigiri off the a la carte menu - fatty tuna, big eye tuna, fresh salmon, and hamachi - and the Spider Roll. \\n\\nI admit I was a little skeptical of a $7 seaweed salad, but this is a pretty substantial bowl of greens. Not only was there the expected seaweed and sesame, but there were beans and all sorts of other greens in the salad as well. I was pleased with it but admittedly only nibbled on anything that wasn't seaweed. \\n\\nThe miso soup was served piping hot with tofu chunks and scallion slices. No complaints there.\\n\\nThen, after what was hardly any wait at all once they observed that I had finished my seaweed salad, the sushi was pushed across the counter to me. This fish was perfect. The knife work was flawless (sushi cut beautifully and cleanly at the correct angle to the grain of the meat; no ragged edges; a very generous portion), the rice and fish were the perfect temperature, the hint of wasabi between fish and rice was just enough to complement the natural flavors, and when I turned the nigiri over to dip the fish lightly into my pool of soy sauce, fish and rice adhered together even when turned upside down. Every single piece of fish was fresh and melt-in-your-mouth delicious.\\n\\nThroughout my meal it was relatively quiet and serene in the restaurant despite the slow trickle of patrons being seated for dinner. The peace was a wonderful respite from the comparative din that necessitated shouting to be heard at the other sushi establishments I've visited in Austin. The service couldn't have been more attentive or warm. The sushi chefs did their job perfectly. It's only five minutes drive my house to boot. \\n\\nMusashino will most definitely be the only place I come for sushi from now on.

There is a lack of choices for BBQ in boston but this place does take it to a good level regardless of the other options around. I usually get a sandwich with some slaw on it and couple of scoops plus the absolutely amazing, magical, fantastical biscuits with honey butter.  I have liked everything for the most part (LOVE those biscuits!) but the meat is a bit dryer (it is sorta hit or miss with the quality and flavor) and would like a more varied BBQ sauce selection to offset it. Texas style screams big flavored but the meats come undressed and with only a mild sauce, vinegar based tangy sauce and extra hot sauce available it doesn't really come together and feels like I am missing an essential piece of BBQ - a great signature sauce.  I do like the idea  of the meat coming undressed, but it just doesn't work with the options they give you to dress it. Other than that, I have liked all my sides and they have great drinks and it is a great environment. The biscuits get ordered twice - a serving for the restaurant and a serving to take home. They are the best biscuits i have ever had (have I said enough about the biscuits? i can keep going if needed). I am a once every two week returner but it is slightly unfortunate that I hesitate to order certain items (not the biscuits) because I'm not sure if it will be as good as last time or if it will be better.

Surprisingly in all the time I've been in Portland, I have not had the chance to check out any of the Pizzicatos around town. I decided to finally check it out for lunch since I had been in the area to get my bike serviced. \\n\\nFirst, I was pretty impressed by what they did with the space. It felt very clean and snazzy in that uniquely quirky Portland way, with all the fixtures and centerpieces being made out of tin cans (I'm imagining that they were recycled from the ingredient containers they used). I do have to agree with W.D. in that the music that they were playing in the background was pretty bad, though.\\n\\nI had a slice of the Puttanesca and of the Thai Chicken pies. They were both very clean and well-prepared, as there was no huge excess of grease or sauce dripping all over the place, which I certainly appreciated. The flavors can together nicely, too, though I thought that the Thai Chicken could have used more intensity in its seasoning, as when I hear Thai, I expect bolder flavors. The crust was a bit thin for my liking, but had very good texture otherwise.\\n\\nOverall, I felt like it was a good experience. It certainly is not the best pizza in town, but it is better than many of the other options around. I honestly liked the space a little more than the pizza, but both were good. I do feel like I overpaid for what I got, but that's pizza in Portland for you.

I do wish both places would offer a special now and then or mix up the menu once in a while, but the old standbys (mushroom and caramelized onions or potato pizza yum) are satisfying nonetheless.  \\n\\nReally it's proximity to the movie theater is the biggest draw, and it makes me want to see my mainstream movies at Fenway now rather than at Boston Common theater."},{"name":"Ah Sing Den","address":"1100 E 6th St","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"Ah Sing Den is still one of my favorite cocktail bars in Austin.

I'm a light eater so I had the 'farm egg' polenta with wild mushrooms.  Let me just say that in our family we usually share our food and taste a little of everything on the table.  Not tonight... That plate WAS ALL MINE!  Of Course, I still tasted the risotto (creamy delight) and the ravioli, which was lightly drizzled in a corn pur√©e and white wine sauce that just begged for a piece of bread to wipe it up.  Our Gluten-free guest was delighted with her shrimp pasta.  She was too far away for me to swipe a taste of hers...  I'd like to say the deserts were awesome, as well, but to be honest, I couldn't eat a bite, but I have it on good authority that it tasted  delish.  Our service was provided by a delightful young lady by the name of Nicki.  I suggest you ask for her the next time you're in.

The inside of this restaurant is pretty quaint and there was a lot of noise. I couldn't really enjoy good conversation with my friends because I could barely hear them. The atmosphere wasn't the best. The food was good, it was pricey for the portion sizes (no sharing plates here) but I did think it was cool that you can watch them make the food from inside (they have a glass wall to the kitchen). Dessert was the only thing to rave about, it was delicious, albeit again expensive. Olive and June is certainly a place that has interesting dishes and seasonal food. But to me it wasn't spectacular enough to make up for the parking (of which btw there is very little unless you park a couple blocks up in the neighborhood), crowdedness, and price."},{"name":"Five Guys","address":"3208 B Guadalupe St","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"I really liked Five Guys.  I'll admit that, like Susi, I'm a little bit put off by the yelling as soon as you walk in the door--\\"Hey!  Welcome to Five Guys!\\"  They do that also at Firehouse Subs, and I don't like it there, either.\\n\\nWhat I did like was the burger and fries, and the very friendly service.  As soon as I approached the counter, they asked if I'd been in before, and explained the menu.  All of the burgers come with meat only (or meat & cheese if you get a cheeseburger) and there is a long list of items that can be added, all of which are free. I got lettuce, tomato and grilled onions, but they also have BBQ sauce, regular onions, jalapenos, sauteed mushrooms, and many other items from which you can choose.  \\n\\nThe cheeseburger was delicious, and very substantial (I got the double, which they call just \\"the cheeseburger\\"--if you want a single, that's the \\"little cheeseburger\\").  The fries were also excellent, very salty and crisp.  I have to say, I'm so tired of being served limp or partially cooked fries, and I was very happy to see that the fries at Five Guys are made with fresh potatoes, and that they are fully cooked to a nice golden brown color.  P. Terry's, please take note: this is how you cook fries.  \\n\\nAs much as I enjoyed the meal, you might think I would have given 5 stars, but there are a few minor things that caused me to hold back.  First, the grilled onions I got were barely grilled.  More like lightly sauteed, and they were made from chopped onions, probably the same onions that you get if you opt for the raw onions, just fried for a couple of seconds.  When I saw they had grilled onions, I expected those dark brown, caramelized strands of limp onions.  What I got was onions fried gently to the point where they are just beginning to soften, with no caramelization at all.  And the fact that they were oily chopped onions meant that a bunch would squirt out every time I took a bite of the burger.  To be clear, I still thought the burger had an excellent flavor.  It just didn't match what I hoped for when I ordered \\"grilled onions\\".  The other thing preventing 5 stars is the basic sterility of the place.  It has a definite Johnny Rockets/In-N-Out thing going on, with white and red tile everywhere, and red aprons on all of the employees.  That, combined with the over-enthusiastic greeting when you walk in the door (women are given an even more aggressive greeting) makes this a restaurant with a schtick.

It comes served open faced on a biscuit, (typically) with 2 eggs and a thick slice of cheese. It also comes with a side of some sort of preserve (blackberry, perhaps?). The verdict: I loved the egg and cheese. Overall, the sandwich was just okay, but that's only because I really don't like biscuits. As far as biscuits go, I'm sure it's a good one. It was flaky and buttery...something I'm just not into. I didn't think the preserves had very much taste. The sandwich was good, but I wouldn't order it again (due to my distaste of biscuit). \\n\\nMy experience there was wonderful! Like I said, the atmosphere is fantastic. It's a great place to just sit around, drink unlimited coffee, read one of their various magazines, and just relax. The only true negative about Northstar is the price.

I have been on many occasions. Its basically a glorified happy hour event that drifts into the later hours as the night progresses. The clientele consists of twenty and thirty somethings just off work who save that really fabulous office outfit for Wednesday knowing they'll be heading off to Urban to flirt and flaunt. Inside you'll find tables and an elevated bar area with booths. The place gets packed but nobody seems to mind. The idea behind the Wine Downs is for a flat $20 you get all you can drink pours of various wines as well as munchies until 8pm. The food is quite delicious for a buffet style spread. Chocolate fondue, pasta salad, cheesy potatoes, mixed greens, crackers with hummus, and of course the flat breads. Those aren't available until an hour or so in and go fast. So keep you're eye out for their appearence. You'll have to make a move if you want to feast on the breads of differing toppings depending on the cooks desire. The potatoes are my favorite option, I'm easy to please. But they really are delicious, my partners in crime coincide. As the inside gets over crowded people begin spilling out onto the large patio area. Urban Flats is set within the new courtyard area on Orange so there is plenty of room to spread out. There's a wine station inside and well as out, each with around 6 flavors to chose from. The staff is friendly so bring cash to tip. And if wine isn't your thing head up top to the full bar as many do. Urban Flats may see its prime on Wednesday nights but its a cute little place to hang out anytime really. Its got a more refined atmosphere than most places on Orange making it perfect for a night out with avid party personalities and types not into the bar scene alike."},{"name":"Diesel Cafe","address":"257 Elm St","city":"Somerville","stars":"4","text":"This is a great place to get some food, but a horrible place to get a table if it's any sort of busy in Davis that day (think weekends, exam time, etc.).

It actually wouldn't be a bad idea to go back towards to end of the season and pick up a few interesting pieces for holiday gifts because there wasn't anything unoriginal there. \\n\\nAfter awhile wandering around in the sun, my boyfriend and I got in line at a few different food trucks to get a variety of snacks, we tried the Prickly Pear-Ade from the Roxy Truck ($2, totally worth it) an $8 everything hot dog from the only hot dog truck, and the rosemary fries from Clover. i'd honestly pass on those next time, and opt for the extra money for the truffle fries from Roxy.

Well, let's start with what they did right.  The location is respectable, because it's within the shopping area, and the 1 star is for the modern look of the establishment.\\n\\nThe analogy here has the accolades of the movie Waterworld.  This movie was produced with the highest budget in history for its time and the public had great expectations, yet for some reason the film had some of the worst acting and an insurmountable abundance of miscues and continuity errors.  Sinju exemplifies every aspect of Waterworld from the price of the menu items to the inferiority and inadequacy of food and drinks.\\n\\nMy parents, brother and I ordered 4 sushi rolls (Las Vegas roll, Volcano roll, 911 roll, Spicy Tuna roll) and some special item salmon plate and 1 drink with a stifling bill of $83.95 not including tip.  This was one time, I wish I would have written their tip on a napkin and handed it to the owner, wait staff, and chef all at the same time.  The tip would have included the following:\\n\\nPlease keep your menu simple.  If you have a 7 page menu, then what you're telling me is that you don't specialize in anything and might as well join the carousel sushi joints such as Marine Polis and Sushi Boat.  The problem with that is Marine Polis and Sushi Boat does not mask what they're providing and charge accordingly.  You can eat for $10.00 - $12.00 per person and taste more flavor and uniqueness at these fast paced locations than you'll ever obtain at Sinju.\\n\\nThe size of the rolls were undersized and looked nothing like the photographs on their website nor menu and was so over sauce to try and mask the flavor of the featured fish items. \\n\\nThe appearance was demeaning to the art of all true sushi chefs out there and the overcooked tempura batter around the rolls was soggy to boot.  Either they needed to change out their fryer oil, or cook them about 2 minutes less to retain a light golden color instead of the burnt bronze that arrived soaked in sauce.\\n\\nThe wait staff was lackadaisical in their service and personified the attitude of a waitress at a diner that's been there for 28 years and would rather be at home in front of Maury Povich or Jerry Springer.\\n\\nAll in all, Long John Silver's would have obtained a better score."},{"name":"Kouzzina","address":"2101 Epcot Resort Blvd","city":"Lake Buena Vista","stars":"3.5","text":"Tried a sampler plate as the cinnamon stewed meat in the lasagna and chicken sounded delicious.

BUT what I do think that means is I'm judging their fundamentals. Anyone can throw a bunch of cheese on a dish and make it taste better. But I judge if your marinara can stand alone and still be a knockout dish.\\n\\nSo I ordered the basic lunch pasta with penne and marinara. I ordered using UberEATS, so that's a big plus in my book, since I'm usually stuck in my office during the day. Sadly, that's where the good points end. \\n\\nI'm sure the owners are nice and maybe their other dishes are good, but this was kinda rough. The flavor itself of the sauce wasn't bad, but that's because there was a TON of garlic and oil and honestly you could cover a shoe in oil and garlic and I'd eat it without hesitation.\\n\\nI included three pictures so you could see what it looked like when delivered, how much oil was in it (I still have a bit of a stomach ache an hour later), and how easily the penne pasta fell apart, it ended up looking like shredded pasta. Clearly it is either pre-cooked and then reheated (I know many places do this, but then don't cook it all the way the first time so it's not overdone when served), or someone overcooked it to death. I couldn't grab more than one on my fork because half of a penne would fall off. It made for a soggy texture. I also had to stop 2/3 in because of the mount of oil. Normally I go to TOWN on pasta (give me ALL the carbs), but I couldn't even finish this dish while super hungry. It was a real shame because of all the awesome reviews I read on here. It's hard to think it was just a fluke because it was such a simple dish, but hopefully they work on their oil servings and cook times. I will say, despite all my negative points, the actual sauce did taste good. Not life-changing, but not bad at all. That's the only thing that got this place two stars. Again, I'm sure the owners and other dishes are good, just not their penne pasta dish."},{"name":"Bar alla Bomba","address":"1101 E Burnside St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"In Portland, you really have to stand out from the crowd to make it, just because there are so many good options here. Unfortunately, Bar Alla Bomba was pretty lacking in the food department. The menu on the website looked promising, especially because I like small-plates type places, but it ended up being just mediocre. The portions were also smaller than they probably should have been for some of the dishes from $3 to $5. I wasn't expecting huge amounts and am used to tapas and small-plates style dining, but one crostini with some cheese and sausage for $5? C'mon.\\n\\nDish Specifics:\\n\\nThe polpetto con limone e burro montato alle erbe (octopus in whipped herb butter and lemon) sounded like a good idea but was completely overcooked and chewy. In fact, when my boyfriend took the first bite and I asked him how it was, it took him what felt like forever to respond, simply because he was chewing for so long. And it was served not in whipped butter but in a small bowl of a pool of melted, flavorless butter. Sometimes I'll end up finishing an OK dish simply because I'm hungry or it's not so terrible that I can't eat the rest, but not this time. Similarly, the Teres maggiore con salsa piccante nero (tender beef shoulder in spicy black sauce) was overcooked and chewy, but at least the sauce was good.\\n\\nSome of the crostini with various toppings like robiola cheese, prosciutto, sausage, lardo and mushrooms were tasty, but again, not quite worth the prices.\\n\\nWe had a feeling we would have an experience like this when we walked in and there were literally two customers in the entire place. It's also clear to us now why we they have an ongoing coupon at MercPerks ($10 for $20) to try and get people in the door. \\n\\nThe bartender was nice and the cocktails were good.

And reasonable prices to boot.\\n\\nI love burgers.  Who doesn't !?!?!*  *Vegetarians, Vegans, etc...*  Ssam Burger takes the American classic and adds a bit of Asian flare.  Like bul gogi?  Try the Seoul Burger.  Like bahn mi?  Try the Saigon.  Both are delicious.  And while Ssam Burger did not ask me how I wanted the burgers done, they came back a delicious, juicy medium.  \\n\\nSsam Burger also has good sides.  The Korean style sweet potatoes were very tasty as were the potato chips.  Next time I am going to try the lotus chips.\\n\\nThe restaurant itself is small, but it is charming for a quick burger joint.  I got my burgers to go, but would be happy to stick around and eat there.\\n\\nSsam Burger, if you read this, you need to throw a Thai burger on the menu.  There was a burger joint in Houston that made one with a tamarind glaze and green papaya slaw.  It was out of this world.  I was devastated when it fell off the menu for a Vietnamese style burger with p√¢t√©.  You seem like the right shop to bring this amazing burger back to life.\\n\\nA final note, I think the portion size of the burgers and sides at Ssam Burger is just right.  It is filling without leaving you full.  You can enjoy your burger without feeling as if you just put down enough calories to last your a month.

After specifying the size of my expected event, I was provided with a lunch menu that I could not even order from. After wasting my time reviewing the options, I followed up to ask for a canap√© menu, which only after my request, I received.

I asked to speak with the manager that I had arranged the booking with, only to be told she was not on premise and completely unavailable. I can't know for sure, but my guess was that the information was not provided accurately to the day-of staff, who were left to haul in tables and chairs to seat 44 people while our event had already started and guests were arriving to awkwardly avoid the chaotic movement in the room. I was informed afterwards that the front staff started to refuse entry to some of our guests, including a 85 yr old guest, because the room \\"was not ready\\" and she was left to sit outside, in the summer heat. Our food service was then delayed due to the turnover required and our function start time was completely delayed.\\n\\nOn a much more positive note, the rest of the staff and manager (I believe her name was Tess) on hand that day were absolutely amazing.

Based on the Yelp reviews we decided to visit Circosta's. \\n\\nWe went for an early dinner on a Sunday. The restaurant is located at the end of a strip mall, and is pretty small. The inside is decorated in typical Italian pizza place style, but it's clean and nice. Our server was very attentive and answered all of our questions.\\n\\nTo start we ordered calamari (our staple appetizer) and garlic bread with tomatoes and mozzarella. The calamari was a smaller portion than most places, and we all agreed that for the price we wouldn't order it again. It was fine, but not the best. The garlic bread was better, my only complaint was the cheese. I'm sure it was the same cheese they use on the pizza, but it just tasted a bit too much like packaged cheese. I wasn't crazy about it. \\n\\nOn to the entrees. They offer a early bird special that is a smaller portion, but includes a dessert (cannoli or spumoni, but they were out of spumoni the day we went). My daughter and I chose early bird portions, but my husband ordered a full portion of his dish, and others ordered off the regular menu (no early bird options). When our food came out our server had put in the early bird for my husband. He wasn't too happy about having his portion cut and he was planning on a dessert other than a cannoli. He was able to pay the difference to upgrade to a different dessert, but he was stuck with the small dinner. I don't think the server should have done that without making sure it was OK, and those of us that wanted the early bird were clear about it when ordering. \\n\\nBut back to the food. I ordered the eggplant parmigiana, which is my usual order. I liked it a lot, but it was coated with that same pizza-quality mozzarella, which I just really didn't care for. My husband had the fettuccine, and he liked it, he just wished there had been more. My son loved his chicken marsala.\\n\\nThe best entree overall was my aunt's Seafood Posillipo. It was full of seafood and she was really pleased with it. She reported that there was seafood in every bite, and she had enough left over to take a box to go. She did ask for more sauce to add to it, but otherwise, she was very happy.\\n\\nThe desserts we ordered were great. The servers told us that they get them from a bakery and everything they had looked fantastic. In addition to the cannolis we ordered a chocolate earthquake dessert and the cream puff cake. Both were delicious, but serious sugar overload.\\n\\nFor me the highlights of Circosta's were the desserts and the Seafood Posillipo. I think my family was mixed in opinion enough about the food that I'm not sure we would go back. It was OK, and I'm glad we gave it a try."},{"name":"Sweet Cheeks Q","address":"1381 Boylston St","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"Food is always better when it's free, and thanks to Chris C.

I left pleased, my dining companion left horrified, so I'll give them a 3 star to even it out. We came because a family member had given me a restaurant.com certificate and we decided to use it; I didn't realize it was all famous and whatnot until after I looked it up on Yelp, so that had no bearing on my decision to come here (but now I'm curious to watch that KN episode).\\n\\nI started with a bottled Sam, and the bread we received, while standard boring white bread, was at least hot, and was served with olive oil with basil which was nice. As an app, we split the buratta salad ($13), which was pretty tasty, 4 huge slices of beets and a big buratta in the middle surrounded by delicate greens and drizzled with balsamic. Would definitely order this again, both of us were happy with this solid choice.\\n\\nI got the pork tenderloin as my main ($23) and was really pleased. It came with 3 large medallions set on a white bean ragu simmered with pork bits, and it was just lovely... the pork was cooked perfectly, it was so tender and flavorful with the small drizzles of pesto on top, and the bean ragu was hearty and delicious. I totally cleaned my plate and would highly recommend this dish.\\n\\nMy dining companion, however, got the Lasagna al Forno ($18), and in her words, it was the worst thing she may have ever eaten at a restaurant. She described it as swampy, flavorless, mushy, and overall really unappealing, and would rather have Trader Joe's $3 lasagna any day over this (side note: TJ's lasagna is actually really good, so no slight to them). She couldn't even put her finger on what was wrong, something about the lack of cheese and too much overcooked spinach and strange-textured mushrooms and 0 flavor. Needless to say, with a ringing endorsement like that, I didn't feel like trying it myself, I'll take her word for it (she rarely has anything bad to say about food, so this was clearly serious).\\n\\nService was good, no complaints there (it was also 6 PM so the place was pretty empty). Ambiance was old school Italian, very subterranean and romantic but seemed pretty dated to me (did they really just redo the decor? Also the blue awning outside makes it look like an insurance company or something). We had a restaurant.com certificate so did not have to pay full price, which I thought was a great deal for my own meal, and at least helped soften the blow of my friend's terrible experience. \\n\\nSo the lesson of the day is, be careful what you order. I don't know that I'd return without the certificate, there was nothing totally special about Davide that would drive me here over any of the over Italian joints (I'd rather save my pennies for Mamma Maria's), but with a certificate and a thoughtful choice of food, it could be a decent night out?"},{"name":"Al Hawr","address":"3500 SW River Pkwy","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"This is a fantastic restaurant!

My wife's margarita was all mix with only a little tequila, but I'm sure they limit the alcohol on a $3 Margarita.  I love $2 High Life, so that won big in my book.

But come on guys, that is what goes for pancakes at brunch around there.  Literally, there was about 67 cents worth of food in three of the smallest pancakes I have ever seen served.  Call them \\"Silver Dollar Pancakes\\" and throw about 40 on a plate for breakfast.  In a town where places like Dan's and Kerby Lane weight the plate down on a small stack you gotta do better. Next, tortillas are supposed to be warm.  That little thing you put them in is supposed to keep them warm.  It does not warm them up.  When corn tortillas are cold, they taste like cardboard and are about as flexible.  Migas are good but not rolled in a cardboard box.  So here's the lesson.  Pay attention to the food.  You are an institution in this town, you need to act like it."},{"name":"Nayar Taqueria","address":"5919 SE Foster Rd","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"Vegetarians: don't be fooled by the vegetarian section of the menu.

My favorites are the octopus balls (careful, they come out really hot), kitsune noodle bowl, and and the sushi chu, which is the chef's selection of nine pieces of sushi and sashimi. You do not need to use wasabi on those because Tomi puts just the right amount in when he makes the rolls.

My friend warned me the place gets busy. I figured that meant good tapas. Wrong! Extremely disappointed.  First thing I noticed, there isn't a single person from Spain working there or eating there (always a bad sign) Not the chef, not the owner, not a waiter.. Right away this made the restaurant fall into a different category. The \\"I went to Spain on vacation and came back with a restaurant idea\\" category.  Ok, maybe that could work if you hired a chef from Spain.....If you're in the business of foreign cuisine, it is only true traditional/original cuisine if at least the chef or owner is from that place you're trying to emulate. \\nI wouldn't have cared had the food been good! How can I best describe it? Microwaved TV dinners served amateurishly, in a kitschy set up with props from home goods. Kids, the music was Salsa and merengue!  Spain has plenty of good music, but salsa and merengue is not part of it! Wrong Continent!\\n\\nMy friend and I ordered at least 8-10 different tapas. They arrived in minutes...A little too fast to be good, and so they tasted! Tasteless bland food. Almost room temperature. No oompf! Just blah. Not bad, fairly priced, but Blah! Even the meatballs that others were in love with on here, left me hanging. Coitus interruptus! \\n\\nWe were hungry, but overwhelmed with over sized want to be tapas.\\n Let me clarify that tapas are small tiny samplers. Also offered as \\"Raciones\\" and \\"medias raciones\\"  Racion being a bigger portion or plate and media racion being a little bigger than a tapa. Maybe 5 bites instead of 2. They are that small for a reason; THEY ARE NOT A MEAL!\\n\\nIn Spain you eat to enjoy food, not to just stuff your fat face. What you eat matters! Food is like sex! You don't just put out!  You also eat to socialize and enjoy family, friends, and loved ones. You take your time, smoke eat drink and repeat. You're never RUSHED OUT BY THE STAFF so they can re-sell your table!!! Did we ask for the check??? No, so don't leave it there!! We're spending money\\n\\nStaff was friendly, but clueless about wine and proper serving techniques. $40 bottle is really only $8-15 wine in the store, but still a fair amount to be spending in a diner. And diner style we got served! Wine was ok but wayyyyy to COOOOLD!!!  Ring, ring, hello clue phone: most Spanish wines are meant to be served at 17-19¬∫ Celsius...Especially Crianza Wines!!! That's a little chilled (below room temp) But not refrigerated ice cold!!!!\\n\\nBy the way Pisto Manchego is never served with canned-like veggies on Pizza like dough! It's supposed to be a mix of FRESH veggies, Manchego style! As in the region of La Mancha, were they have lots of TASTE and FLAVOR! \\n\\nTASCA=sustantivo femenino (taberna) bar, tavern; (bar de poca categor√≠a) poor class.

Also, the waitress stated they had no risotto and any dish on the menu which featured risotto would be substituted with rice.  Strange, because many of the dishes on the menu did indeed feature risotto, a much more complex offering than rice.  There was nobody in the restaurant.   Somehow, I think the lack of patrons at this restaurant might have something to do with the portion size measured against the cost.  Tasty, but would definitely not return due to completely dead ambience, small portions, and much too costly for what is served.

I hope to visit again soon because I'd love to try their BBQ (and it's a thrill to see Chef Faison). Until then, this review is just of their ramen night.\\n\\nTo start: check their twitter. Not only is it quite informative, their social media staff is quite responsive if you have questions. If you are interested in a ramen night, it's important to know what variety they are serving (can be vegetarian, tonkatsu, or other).\\n\\nIt's important to get there early. There was a line the night we went (January 19th, 2015), and they only make 100 bowls of ramen for the night. It was a cold and blustery night to wait outdoors, but the staff kept us warm with rounds of hot chocolate and togarashi popcorn. \\n\\nHonestly, their staff was as much a highlight of the evening as the food. Extremely personable, they were clearly enjoying themselves and made every effort to engage the customers.\\n\\nThe ramen that night was tonkatsu with pork belly. The limited menu included a few classic Japanese appetizers (grilled shishito peppers and tsukemono), some sake, and some Japanese beer. They also offered extra pork belly and their signature buttermilk biscuits with honey butter.\\n\\nBefore I start pointing out the flaws, I wan't to make an important note about the ramen: I loved it. The broth was luscious and salty, the noodles were the perfect consistency (it's great they've started using Sun), the soft-boiled seasoned egg was a nice twist on a classic component, and the pork belly was simply divine.\\n\\nThat said, it wasn't perfect. Their noodles are too short. I suspect it was on purpose (to keep people cleaner), but you couldn't get that classic slurp going. They could also use another 2 oz. of noodles given how much broth there was. As for the broth, seasoning was a bit inconsistent from what I gathered by talking to others near us. In general, the broth could have used a bit more depth of flavor - it fell just short on a  few umami notes.\\n\\nBut here's the thing: it shouldn't have been perfect. This is a barbecue joint experimenting with ramen, something that most purveyors have to dedicate their craft to. If you're expecting the best ramen of your life, go to a dedicated ramen shop. I loved this whole-hearted attempt at their own version and applaud the willingness to experiment. If you want to be a ramen purist, don't go.

This will be my first and probably last review on any business review website. Writing reviews is not my thing, but I just had to do one on Yuzu because I think people need to listen to what I have to say. I've been going to Yuzu ever since it opened. I go there couple times a month for business dinners and pleasure, and because of that I'm using a fake name so Yuzu doesn't know who I am when they read this. Sorry for the long intro.\\n\\nI am not giving Yuzu 3-stars for their food. Their food is 5-stars and has always been. I'm giving 3-stars for the change in atmosphere in the last year or so. I'm specifically talking about the customers who now come to Yuzu. People need to understand that Yuzu is an izakaya. It's a place to drink and the Yuzu family opened the place to be that way. They still try very hard to keep it that way, but I see they're struggling due to the new group of customers. Everytime I go there now I see half of the place eating ramen and only ramen. I sometimes see two people sharing a ramen. How rude can you get? People if that's all you're going to order, go there during lunchtime when the entire menu is ramen. Please show some respect to the Yuzu family. Their business depends on people ordering a bottle of sake and appetizers to go with it, i.e. spending $$$. Not two people eating ramen and chit chatting for an hour. I'm sure many of you have wondered why they close so early on Saturdays. It's because serving ramen all night isn't worth it to them, when they could be serving groups of businessmen that are ready to drink and eat all night.

I've gone to a number of Korean BBQ locations and have to say, compared to them... Danketsu is unfortunately subpar. \\n\\nThe location plays loud, pounding music - mostly electronic and some Top 40. Don't even think you can carry on a conversation because the music is so loud that you can't hear other people around you without yelling. Normally this location takes reservations, but they do not for Thursday night. I was expecting a long wait, but fortunately it was only 30 minutes... (that's not bad for some $12 BBQ!). \\n\\nThe college night has a limited selection... I would say compared to other locations, the meat quality is not as good. It comes with side dishes, but most are just mediocre and not mind blowing. Two sauces come with the meat - one is slightly spicy and the other one is a weird tomato flavor. Everything is edible, but it truly is not delicious, amazing BBQ. \\n\\nService is a little slow - probably because this location was so popular the waiters and waitresses run like chickens with their heads cut off. Weirdly enough, this place doesn't have soju! I have never heard of a Korean BBQ location without soju!! \\n\\nOverall, if I had the time and was hungry..

I am qualified to make this statement not only b/c my momsie is Southern, but more importantly, I was an obese child. I know my way around a biscuit. Real well. And these are great. Buttery, dense caloric perfection. Perhaps not as flakey as some would like, but to me, they were aces as I love that thick-sink-your-teeth in type thing. I would have preferred regular butter to slather on them instead of the honey butter stuff, but overall, a fan-effing-tastic way to start the meal. Whereas most ppl were all like \\"ohhhh, I can't eat an entire one by myself\\", I ate three. Because I am a champion. \\n\\nHush puppies (which yes, I did initially type as \\"pussies\\") weren't as successful - weirdly sweet, too greasy. The fried green tomatoes were breaded well, but could have used a dash or two of salt. Friends got a variety of trays and sandos - ranging from $11-26, although it includes two sides, it wasn't a huge amnt of food for the price, though it was rich. The brisket and pulled pork got the best reviews, the pork belly less so.\\n\\nIf you're going full veg, they can have anything fried, mac n' cheese (which was weirdly dry and unappetizing, a pass), and many of the sides (broc casserole, potato salad, cole slaw), though some of them have meat in them, so be sure to ask. I have zero idea what a vegan would eat here - oh, the farm salad (grapes, pecans, brussels, lettuce, parm) was actually pretty tight, so if you do sans cheese, perhaps you can hit that?\\n\\nPlan to spend $20-$30/pp - great cocktails, good beer list, wine is fine but nothing special, though it comes generously poured in a mini Mason jar, which always makes me happy. Vibe is muy casual - a little loud - hoppin bar scene and while the place isn't exactly sexxxy, we saw lots of first dates going down (and yelling timber, in honor of Flo Rida, duh), so it's pretty excellent people watching - bonus points for the fact that they do play oldies, so if we happen to cross paths there, get ready to hear me aggressively hum to Roy Orbison from across the resto.

Not that we wanted to wait in line, but a restaurant AND bar empty on a Saturday night????  Bad news.\\n\\nThe \\"hostess\\" seemed very put out by the idea that we wanted to be seated.  We then got shoved in a corner table, and ignored while a larger party that came in after us ordered and received drinks, and placed their meal order. No one had been by our table.  Now this may be understandable, if the restaurant is busy, but given there were total 5 tables in the place, ummm...\\n\\nSo I got up to approach the hostess, to ask for someone to take our order.  No where to be found. I stood there for several minutes before a waiter asked if he could help.  I was polite but said we wished to order, at least drinks, and would like to do so.  At that moment the \\"waitress\\" walked up to the hostess stand, and the waiter asked if she had been over to our table. She shook her head and walked away, it was extremely rude.  \\n\\nThe waiter, who seemed to be the only helpful person in the place, came over and took our order.  we ordered soft drinks, the brie appetizer and I had a salad, my date had shepherds pie.  The brie was decent, soft drinks never refilled (or even offered, we would have paid) my salad was uninspired, and the shepherd's pie did not look all that appealing.  \\n\\nThe waiter was extremely apologetic about the situation at the beginning--when he brought the check.  \\n\\nI give it two stars because the restaurant and bar appear nice.

My meal was amazing.  My experience with the staff was not.  \\n\\nThe Tuesday night hostess was rude and not at all accommodating.  Someone before me here used the word \\"stink eye\\".  I think that comes close.  Instead of being welcoming and making us feel like they wanted us there, she was not at all interested in attempting to give us a suitable timeframe in getting a table.  When we gave up our seats at the bar for an outside patio seat, we were told that they didn't have any avail with attitude from the hostess.  I said \\"I wished you would've told us so that we didn't lose our bar seats\\" and she rudely responded \\"well, you should have asked me first before you gave them up!\\"  Totally uncalled for.  Luckily, right at that time, another couple finished their meal at the bar and we were able to get a seat.  During the meal when we received our salads, the hostess came up to us and asked if we wanted to move to the patio then.  Why would we want to if we were already eating our meal? \\n \\nThe worst part was the bearded bartender was a total douche-bag as he seemed like he was trying to hit on my date while asking for her drink order.  Slimeball.  WTF?  He completely ignored my multiple requests for an ice water.  When our salads came, he only asked my date if she wanted pepper and never asked me.  Our entr√©es arrived before our appetizer that never came.  I asked him to please cancel it.  If this bartender spent more time concentrating on our order and any of our needs instead of trying to be smooth and hit on taken women, Winflo would be a better experience for all.  When I was leaving, the dining room was empty and as I walked by the hostess she looked up at me as to say \\"thank you, have a great night\\"....and recognized that it was me....and just looked back down and never said a word.  \\n\\nI take a lot of clients out to various high-end restaurants in town on a weekly basis and I will be SURE to NOT take any clients to Winflo.

I don't have any other place in Atlanta yet to compare to so keep that in mind.  I agree with Theresa H. on here. This restaurant is a solid 4.5 stars so I'm going to round up here.\\n\\nWe made a reservation for a Friday evening and drove up. They have valet service which I was surprised to see that none of the people inside knew whether there was a charge for valet... even though it was there valet. In the end, we settled on it being $2 to park not including tip. The attendant was great and we got inside to our table. The restaurant is built like a small Parisian bistro with their paintings of Paris streets. Brings me back to the cobblestone roads and people watching in front of the cafes. \\n\\nTonight we went with a beautiful Chateauneuf du Pape to start off. These are generally expensive so the price didn't surprise me. For those people who enjoy red wine that is bold, complex yet not particularly tanniny then this Rhone wine is one of the best. Just fyi! For appetizers we went with the charcuterie board and the French onion soup. Wish they came with more bread for the charcuterie board. It would be fun to display different types of bread that also highlight the delicious choices of meat that they put on the board. As you would expect for the French onion soup, a combination of savory, tangy and sweet that brings together the perfect umami. Delicious! The bread and the gruyere cheese on top always make this dish a favorite of mine. Remember that it generally comes out piping hot so don't burn your mouth like I did!\\n\\nFor the main course we went with the filet mignon and the duck confit which were both excellently done. The filet had a wonderful marinade on top served with fries (I guess that was a little unusual) and spring greens. The duck was crispy on the outside and yet they were able to keep the meat juicy on the inside. I thought these were great representations of good French cooking. You'll find many restaurants nowadays taking French food and adding little twists and turns to make it modern but Atmosphere sticks to the tradition. \\n\\nDon't forget about dessert because if you have a sweet tooth like me, everything on the menu will seem like something that you want. That is why we went with 2 desserts tonight even though we were already full. The puff pastry that came with the apple tart with crispy and buttery contrasting and complimenting the crispness/sweetness/tartness of the apple on top. And of course, it's always great with a side of ice cream. Have you ever had profiteroles? They are like a cream puff but instead of the cream on the inside, they put ice cream and pour chocolate over the top. \\n\\nThey are on the expensive side so they really aren't a restaurant you can eat at every day unless you are in the 1%. However, Atmosphere deserves more attention than what we saw on a Friday night and is a fun place for francophiles to have a celebratory or date night dinner.

Twice I'v taken olives half off the order instead of having them on the whole pizza and I'll see a charge for it. The first time this happened I had asked if I could take off olives and add pepperoni to the same side of the pizza and I got what I thought was a person cohesively and enthusiastically saying they understood. When I looked at the pizza on my kitchen counter I realized  half my pizza was just pepperoni with no other ingredients. So I checked the receipt and they ended up charging full price for a Chicago 7' plus an extra charge for pepperoni. So they charged me extra for a pizza and took off most of the toppings  \\nSince then I have received that charge for taking an item off the pizza and have had then forget items of 2 of the next 3 pizzas. I forgot to tell them about the first issue so I moved passed it but now that Yelp is asking me to review this place, let me do it. It sucks, its corporate and they make so many mistakes but don't give customer service to make up for it. I live in the area and started coming here after coming to a group dinner here months ago. However I'v realized that I have given this place too many chances. It's great for big groups since that's all I ever see in there is like 10+ tops and a few people in the bar area. That way not a lot of orders are getting sent back since your with all those people and don't want to hold things up. Ya, if I'd seem some customer service or if they hadn't messed up so many times recently then I wouldn't be taking the time to relate how that should earn them a proper 1 star evaluation for outright failing while trying to trick customers that their experience/food/service is better because of the corporate window dressing."},{"name":"Caffe Paradiso","address":"255 Hanover St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"8am on Thursday.

Their cocktails are fantastic (I'm a big fan of the foreigner during the summer, and the blessed italian otherwise). \\n\\nOn Mondays, they have 1/2 off wine by the glass/beer/small bites in addition to their normal 1/2 off apps and liquor. It's such a steal! The farm egg polenta is devastatingly creamy and the mushrooms add some necessary earthiness to the dish. I am also a fan of the pork meatballs and zeppole, thought I believe it has been recently replaced by the golden beet crocchette (also very good, though slightly sweeter). I have also tried the cheese and meat platter as well as the seafood fritto misto, but the texture of the fritto misto seems more baked than fried, which just isn't my thing.\\n\\nThe desserts are also scrumptious- I have tried the white chocolate semifreddo, chocolate budino, and the cranberry rose bombolini. The semifreddo is scrumptious, though it can get a bit heavy towards the end. The chocolate budino is my overall favorite, as it's got everything- crunch, something cold, something hot, and and something creamy. On the other hand, I could eat a tub of the cream cheese gelato that comes with the bombolini. \\n\\nThe service here is fantastic- the waiters are very attentive and try all of the dishes beforehand so they can make the best recommendation. It's a breath of fresh air, especially since Austin seems to be lacking in trained waitstaff. Oh, and the decor is spot on.

We Googled Mexican food in the neighborhood, and La Fuente came up. Feeling adventurous, we went for dinner...and our lives were changed forever.\\n\\nReally though, La Fuente is a delight across the board. From the time we walked in to the time we left, the charming hole-in-the-wall taqueria treated us like family. The staff were friendly and welcoming, and while the restaurant is not large by any means, each booth is comfortably spacious (a big deal to those of us who put more burritos in our bellies than we probably should...).\\n\\nAs far as food goes, I enjoyed how diverse the menu was. La Fuente offers pages of choices, but not at the cost of overwhelming the customer.\\n\\nOur meals: Burrito Con Carne (with seasoned pork) and an horchata, and a two enchilada plate with seasoned pork and steak.\\n\\nWhere to start? Their horchata! So quenching and piquant. It, like their salsas and hot sauces, tastes very freshly made. That's what set La Fuente apart for my wife and me; the flavors of even the slightest thing (like the salsa with the complementary chips) are eye-poppingly vibrant. When our dishes arrived, I didn't expect to actually taste so many of the ingredients. La Fuente, unlike most Americanized Mexican restaurants, has the wonderful decency to not drown every dish in melted cheese. Our food came naked and unadorned, giving us the freedom to top it with red or green hot sauce as we desired. The flavors lit up our mouths in the best way. The ingredients were able to breathe and commingle without getting muddy and saturated. The seasoned pork in particular blew me away. I could taste the char and crisp tingle of spice in every bite of my burrito, something I am not used to with the run-of-the-mill Mexican food in the area.\\n\\nAs you can tell from this review, La Fuente left more than a good impression on my wife and me.

We went at 7pm on a Thursday, and did not have to wait at all to be seated in the downstairs dining area. \\n\\nMy overall experience was a mixed bag, and here are some reasons why:\\n\\nThe good:\\n\\n-Unique atmosphere with live music and what I assume is a close to authentic German beer hall feel. It's a lot of fun. \\n\\n-Ample parking at the Grandview Yard parking garage.\\n\\n-The beer and food pricing is very reasonable. A 1 liter (~35 oz) jug of their Hofbrau lager was only $8.86. Their giant pretzel appetizer was $9.49. Their sausage sampler was $14.99. \\n\\n-The beer is pretty good. With that said, their lager is a typical European lager. Much more bitter than a typical American lager like Budweiser. If you hate bitter beer, you might not like their lager. I assume their Hefeweizen isn't quite as bitter. Hofbrau beers are available in bottles at your local grocery stores... it might be a good idea to try one before you go and order a 1 liter jug. \\n\\n-Guys will probably appreciate the outfits worn by the waitresses here. Ladies however may find this annoying.\\n\\nThe bad:\\n\\n-Their food isn't as good as Schmidt's. It's not bad, but if you don't think the food is amazing after downing a liter of beer, you're probably never going to find the food amazing. The pretzel was good. The sausage was mediocre. The saurkraut was straight up not good.\\n\\n-The service still has teething issues. As the photo that I posted shows, they severely underfilled my 1 liter jug of beer. As there was so much foam, I probably only got 750ml of actual beer. Our server also completely messed up our check when splitting it. This was a quick fix however. \\n\\n-The beer hall seating is probably too loud to have any meaningful conversation. So this probably isn't a good choice for a date. Also not so good with kids.  \\n\\n\\nI think next time, I'll just have appetizers and focus on drinking beer.

Centro lends a glimmer of hope.  \\n\\nHonestly I'm biased, most of my experiences there are breakfast oriented, but what a breakfast!  On the occasion that I make it there before breakfast happy hour ends, which is a great concept, there unique $2 dishes are ample enough to fill nigh any hangover for $6-8.  Coconut cream fried bananas, yes, they are as good as they sound.  Breakfast tacos, burnt grapefruit, really, some novel dishes.  They also typically have a special dish not on the menu that is almost always worth trying, from pork belly to a camarone fritata.\\n\\nSince I rarely make it before 11, I generally have to be satisfied with their $2 Mimosas and Bloody Marys.  The bloody marys leave a bit wanting on the tongue and the liver.  They're more bloody than mary.  Throw a bit more booze in there, some veggies, and some spice, and I'll pray at your altar.

It is located in the cooking school behind Irwin Street Market. Parking can be found in front of Jake's in a small lot, in a gravel lot behind Irwin Street Market, or along Sampson Street. Parking IS cramped, so if you have the option, drive the smallest car you own. \\n\\nAppa's is easy-to-spot by its bright green exterior. I arrived at 5:00pm and there were already people waiting. They also provided complimentary lemonade for customers as they waited in line. A line was not formed until 5:17pm when one of the owners informed us that we could begin lining up. Around 5:30, there was already a line wrapped around the lot. Moral of the story: come early.\\n\\nOnce you get inside Appa's, there is quite a bit of seating available. There are tables along the left-hand side, a sofa to the right, and patio seating out the double doors on the right. There's a table right behind the sofas where you can grab extra sauce, which I thought was convenient. For a small family of five who were running the business today, I was quite impressed with how quickly orders were being brought out. It took a longer time to order your food than to actually wait for your food to be ready. I ordered my food to-go and was pleasantly surprised that they had packaged my order in a bag, along with extra sauce of my choice and a napkin. I appreciated the small attention to detail as minuscule as they may be.\\n\\nI ordered a salmon sushi burrito with Appa's sauce (spicy mayo) which costed around $12. They also sell other goodies like macarons and matcha cream puffs (which are created by deliciowhso and varies weekly). The burrito was delicious- I enjoyed the crunchiness of the quinoa and the freshness of the lettuce and red cabbage.  They definitely don't skimp with the ingredients here- my burrito was stuffed! I did notice, however, that the pok√© bowls seem to be more worth the bang for your buck when comparing how much you get between the burrito and bowl. I do wish that the spicy mayo sauce was spicier! I enjoyed the savory sauce but I wouldn't describe it as savory; it's definitely much sweeter, but tasty nonetheless (and pairs well with the salmon!) In conclusion, I do recommend Appa's- just get here early, bring plastic, and know what you want to order."},{"name":"Blue Moon Pizza","address":"5610 Glenridge Dr, Ste 110","city":"Sandy Springs","stars":"3.5","text":"I came in for the first time today and had Cindy as my server.

Said I'd wait - and after a brief jaunt around the local shopping centers, I returned to an open seat, waiting for me.  No annoying blinking/vibrating device, not even a list, just the memory of a verbal transaction and the honoring of one's word.  Not the most economically viable way to go about things, but old-fashioned and charming if you will.\\n\\nThe lack of signage:\\nYes, I missed it on my first pass, but kudos to them that they rely on their product and not some big flashy sign to attract customers.  Yuzu was full throughout the night even though you can literally only see the sign from a certain angle!\\n\\nAs for the food, itself - it was good.  I went with the highly touted Kakuni Ramen and was pleased.  All elements had a good taste, with the dish featuring noodles of solid consistency, tender pork that melted in the mouth and a broth that was light, and palatably smooth.  Unfortunately, I didn't walk away that satisfied, but that's due to a personal trait of mine - i eat a lot - and ramen just never fills me up!\\n\\nI'm a harsh critic, and a place won't earn five stars from me unless it has that wow factor - part of the reason it's taken so long to go from consulting Yelp to Yelping.

You take excellent grade ground beef in combination with deep fried shoestring goodness, spicy mayo & wah - lah! A juicy, delicious, mouth watering burger...that can be found at Bamboo, Slow Burger, Killer Burger, Biwa...and the list goes on. This burger is nothing exceptional. \\nHowever, IF you make your way here, at least order the ribs. Fall off the bone, delectable & savory goodness.

Remembered orders by memory & food came out in a quick & timely fashion. As the last items arrived, she could clearly see that our drinks(cocktail & water vessels) were empty yet practically dropped the dishes on the table with no offer of refills or another drink. She could've easily sold us 2 more drinks & potentially another round of ribs, had she given us a chance to order, instead of running off. This night was a a week night and less than 1/2 of restaurant was full. Not busy at all.  Perhaps other servers were good, but this woman was NOT. \\nHer disingenuous \\"thank you\\" when dropping off the tab was icing on the cake of the entire downward experience.  \\n I used to be a server for years during my college years and due to my experience with the service industry,  I am conscientious, empathetic and a Very generous tipper. My experience with Val left me tipping her 10% (and I was reluctant to leave that).

We got there just before 8:30 one night, the first time I went on a Friday night, and we waited over an hour to get in. When we finally got in, we had to pay $15 cover. Library Square really isn't worth it at that point. The second time I went was for a birthday, so we got there at 6:30pm to make sure we had enough tables for our group (they don't take resos after 6pm). Luckily we snagged 2 booths and a table. Food was your typical bar food. I thought it was alright but nothing special. Drinks were your typical bar prices. I had been there one other time on a Saturday night and it was pretty dead.\\n\\nLIbrary Square is a pretty decent place to be on a Friday night as long as you are there before they charge cover.Otherwise, I would highly advise you to go elsewhere unless you plan on greasing the bouncers $20.

I'm not from this area, so maybe it was because of something I didn't know, but it was still weird to me). Actually, I was convinced this was going to be a great restaurant because of all the \\"Zagat rated\\" stickers posted up on the front door - not completely sure what that means, but I assumed that it meant that it was a good restaurant (haha). \\n\\nI walk in, and one of the first things I notice was that it was HOT. It was about 80? degrees this afternoon, and I had just come back from walking around a college campus so I was looking for some A/C. Apparently the A/C wasn't even on in the restaurant... a man had to tell the waitress to turn the A/C on. Next thing I notice is that there were about 6 tables out of the 10? tables occupied, but maybe only 1 table had their food served already. Anyway, so after we enter the restaurant, we just stood there awkwardly for the longest 30 seconds, waiting for someone to come over... I thought maybe it was one of those restaurants where you sit yourself down, so I sat at the closest vacant table with my family and grabbed a few menus from a podium stashed behind my seat. We took about 5 minutes looking for something to eat until the waitress hurriedly came up to us and said, \\"Oh\\" as if she never noticed us enter, then gave us different menus because apparently we had grabbed the wrong ones. \\n\\nThere was only one waitress and I assume one chef, so no one was getting their food on time. A family who had come after us had gotten their bread before we did - it was just the bread that everyone was supposed to get, but it took what felt like 20 minutes before we got our bread. Our main course took a VERY long time to come, and although it was delicious (I'm not that picky), it would have taken a much shorter time in other restaurants. \\n\\n\\nI probably would give this place 2 stars, but the food wasn't bad, and the restaurant seemed nice and cozy.

On top were two underdone eggs...aka the whites were runny.  Nothing is more disgusting than runny whites.  Seriously this was probably the worst food I have ever gotten at a restaurant. The only thing I ate on the plate was the lettuce garnish.  On top of it, the server recommended it.  Please go to Met or Joe's and get a normal brunch.

Our servers were very pleasant though. We came at around 7 on a Saturday and there wasn't much crowd, probably because the place is barely a week old. \\n\\nFood itself was tasty! I had the combo shrimp and clam bag ($19), husband got the shrimp and crawfish ($21) and my friend got the snow crab ($23). Would recommend the add on of potato and corn if you are hungry. We tried the Shaking Crab and House Cajun, but I couldn't rly tell the difference between the two. The sauce itself wasn't overly garlicky or salty which I think can very easily happen. Spice levels were as expected: spicy is actually spicy and medium is medium.

The restaurant is inside an old mansion, which is very cool looking and different. It's close to Rt 128 and a local shopping center. \\n\\nParking here is a bit weird and limited. There's a half circle out front with some parking spots. More spots are off to the right and behind the building. If you park on the side be aware that one section narrows down to a one car lane, tough to navigate and could be prone to fender benders if you aren't careful. Proceed with caution. Spaces are also limited so you may need to park on the street or across the way. \\n\\nOnce inside the restaurant there's a small seating/waiting area which is very compact. When I first entered I stood behind another person since I thought there was a line to check-in. Turns out that the waiting party just decided to stand in front of the entrance door, blocking other people from going in to check-in. GRRRRRRRRR!!!!!!!!!!!!! Please, if you have already checked in and just waiting don't line up in front of the door and block the entrance. Move aside and let others in. \\n\\nWhen I finally got to the check-in desk I was greeted nicely. I wanted take-out and the ordering was quick and easy. I paid right away and waited by the nearby bar. The downstairs bar was small but looked really great. Sichuan Garden does offer several specialty cocktails and I saw many go by. Most looked great. One did come back though, the diner complained that the cocktail had too much crushed ice in it. Having seen it, I did agree. The whole glass was filled beyond the brim with crushed ice. At $10 or more a pop, give your patrons their monies worth. \\n\\nWhile waiting I saw many delicious looking entrees go by with plump shrimps, plentiful noodles and plenty of hot peppers if that's what the dish called for. Soon my order was ready and it was double checked for correctness by the manager before I left. \\n\\nMy order included the standard scallion pancakes, Dan Dan Noodles and Chengdu Dry Hot Chicken (which I've never had). The scallion pancakes were ok but I've had better. They were hot and crispy on the outside but lacking in scallion bits that really make these a star appetizer. With more scallion these would be really tasty. The Dan Dan Noodles were a good sized portion for an appetizer. There was plenty of hot chili oil spiked sauce topped with noodles, ground pork and greens. Spiciness was good without being mouth numbing. The noodles were a tad overcooked to my liking. Chengdu Dry Hot Chicken came with a ton of chopped Sichuan dry peppers, chopped Jalapeno peppers, ginger bits and deep fried batter coated chicken pieces. The serving size was rather small, especially given the price of this entr√©e (over $14). It looked more like an appetizer sized portion. There wasn't a lot of meat at all. Some of the fried bits seemed to be only batter also. This was a true disappointment after seeing other good looking entrees. The spice level and flavor was ok but this is one dish I will not order again from here. \\n\\nHaving eaten at many Boston and San Francisco area Chinese restaurants, including those in Chinatown, I've had many great authentic meals. My meal from Sichuan Garden II was ok but not near the best I've every had. Takeout service was quick and correct. Eating at the restaurant itself may bump up the rating though. The mansion is very interesting and the cocktails look good.

AND where I waited 10 minutes for the bartender to even acknowledge I was there and ask me if I would like anything.  \\n\\nWe were seated (party of 4) in the dining room and the waitress was informative and knowledgeable about the menu and specials. We order the shrimp appetizer and the pimento cheese bread. Both were very good.   For the main course I had the hanger steak. First the presentation was horrible as it looked like someone just threw a handful of french fries on top of it.  I normally do not order hanger steak but someone recommended it to me so I ordered it after specifically asking the waitress about the texture etc as I normally find it chewy.  She assured me it was prepared to be tender. Well, it was prepared to be raw.  And I mean raw. I had a friend try a bite to see if I was being too picky and she assured me that it was horrible. It took 15 minutes for one of the waitstaff to come by our area so I could flag them down to take it back. They offered for me to order something else, but at this point I was not going to delay the dinner by ordering something else when my companions were already 50% done with their meal.  With all of this being said, I was not charged for the entree. \\n\\nWatershed is yet another \\"see and be seen\\" place in Buckhead where people go to say they went there. And yet another place where your evening starts with an engaging waitress who you never see again after placing your order and then you are left with a quality of wait staff that is sub par and needs to take an English as a second language class. \\n\\nI am making a few dining resolutions this year.  I am no longer going to places that force me to valet park. I am no longer going to places that seat over 50 people. I am not longer going to places that seat parties of over 10 people (we were seated next to a group of 20 and it impacted our service).

You can sit under umbrellas so you don't bake in the sun, and it's so nice to sit by the water (well, sort of near the water) and people watch. The seating inside the restaurant looked nice too. Maybe next time, we'll try inside so I can really compare.\\n\\nI would go back to the Seaport Cafe, and it was a nice enough experience. However, they really need to have faster service. The meal wait time was extremely long, and as I said, our waiter only checked on us when delivering the food and then the check. That service won't cut it in the long run as tourists in Salem, and regulars, tend to be picky about that sort of stuff. I wish them luck though, and did see a couple of meals that I would like to try. If you're passing by, definitely take a gander.

My favorite wines so far have been a Cabernet Franc and a Red Blend from South Africa as well as the Spy Valley Sauvignon Blanc from New Zealand. The only thing I wish they offered are wine flights. Since 140 different wines are offered, I would love to pay to sample a few for the price of one 6oz glass. Last night my friend and I went and our server, Tommy was very helpful in suggesting wines that we would enjoy after the Cab Franc and brought samples to the table. We were able to find a new wine that we loved and ordered a glass. Yet, I'd love to see wine flights added to the menu!\\n\\nThe small plates are delicious! Just be aware, it's a little expensive. The cheese and charcuterie board is $52! I'm definitely a cheese girl, but not for that price. As an alternative, the house made meatballs with polenta are incredible, the burrata is fresh and flavorful, the hummus and grilled octopus plates are light and delicious! \\n\\nAll in all, go and try Wine Bar George! It's a beautiful addition to Disney Springs. Even though you're surrounded by thousands of Disney guests walking past, you feel like you're transported to wine country. Grab a table inside or outside, doesn't matter. All seating is great and parking in the Lime Garage will make for an easy in and out.

Claims of farm to market, seasonal produce, impossible for a customer to evaluate, are called into suspicion by the alternatingly tasteless, over-salted, and mushy examples of swiss chard, tomatoes and carrots presented to us. Appetizers ranged from decent (a soup fresh from its fateful encounter with a Vitamix) to horrible (Crab crostini, inspiring honest fear of seafood poisoning: bland and tepid, on bread so burnt the gas from the stove could be tasted). Main courses, quail and pasta, served together, as is proper, but the pasta had grown cold. It was clearly finished before the quail was ready and had sat for some time. Meat was not bad, but nothing that could not be done at home. Tomato sauce tasted like it came out of a can. Plate presentation was poor, with some food trailing over the edge of the plate even as the plate was set before us.

Now the giant bugs are inside. In fairness, they are fewer in the cold weather, but as recently as a month ago, I saw several crawling around and was told by one (former) manager that they were even climbing *into* the milk carafes (in the self-serve coffee area)!\\n\\nThe food is OK but overpriced. The cakes are good, but I wish they would edit their menu, which reads \\"Shamelessly large slice of our gourmet cakes\\" because they have not served even remotely large slices in a loooong time. You get a sliver, for $5 plus tax. In addition to raising prices, shrinking portions seems to be how they increase their profits. The drip coffee is actually not good. It's better (to me) than Starbucks drip, but that's not saying much. The espresso drinks have a mixed reputation; I haven't had one in a while, but I found their mochas overly sweet and largely devoid of coffee flavor. A friend who's had a cappuccino there said it was great. Their espresso shakes are good.\\n\\nAs for the atmosphere, I appreciate that they tolerate people occupying tables for hours at a time while ordering only a coffee (free refills). But when there are people ordering meals who are unable to find a table large enough for their party--or any table, for that matter--the thing to do is surrender yours and move to the bar or outside (there are heaters and outlets on the back patio). Instead, you'll find lots of tables of students blithely ignoring the people wanting to dine in.  And on this topic: management is way too timid about the obnoxious kids who run power cords across the floor when they can't get a table close to an outlet. WTF? This is so obviously dangerous and a fire-code violation that I can't believe I've had to tell management, staff, and the fire dept about it myself, more than once.\\n\\nI've been going to AJC since I moved to Austin more than a decade ago. I haven't seen such a high staff turnover at any other place I've frequented. Managers and staff all moan about the low pay and the owners' misplaced priorities, and it shows in the high turnover and mediocre service (not that some staff don't want to do well, but there's a learning curve for new employees, and staff seem overwhelmed and undertrained).

Absolutely love it. About once or twice a month, my friends and I choose a restaurant to have brunch at, in an effort to mix things up and see what Boston has to offer. I'd never been to Stephanie's On Newbury as it didn't seem like anything special, and I had been weary of trying it, as the reviews I've read have been very mixed. In fact, I usually go to Abe & Louie's for brunch when I'm in the Boylston/Newbury area (great place--always good food and service, and their brunch is actually cheaper). But hey, what do I know? I should at least try Stephanie's so I can judge for myself. Um, I should have totally listened to my gut and gone to Abe & Louie's. \\n\\nI was mentally prepared for the fact that it would be spendy--it is Newbury Street, after all, but I wasn't prepared to be so completely underwhelmed by the place. First off, my roommate and I were late (never drive to Newbury St. It's my own fault that I forgot how awful it would be) so the rest of our party was already there and seated. Now this may just be me (and possibly because I've worked in restaurants), but the host didn't even show us to the table; rather he gave us instructions as to how to get there. I'd never been to the restaurant, and he tells me to go up the stairs. Wtf? What stairs? \\n\\nWe manage to make it to the table, and lucky us, there's a baby shower party next to us, so we're packed in like sardines (the people from the shower were very nice, though). But whatever, it's Sunday and prime brunch time. We had two servers (both who were working the baby shower), and they were okay. Not too attentive, but pleasant enough. We waited a bit to order, but while waiting, there was no bread. They didn't even offer us water--in fact, nothing was offered to us. Maybe I've become spoiled, but I feel like some sort of bread or baked good should have been offered. Especially at brunch. And especially at Stephanie's. If I can get bread and muffins from a restaurant that serves a $10 brunch, then I sure as hell should be able to get some bread for a brunch that I'm going to pay close to $50 for. But I digress. \\n\\nOne of my friends has a gluten allergy, so when we were ordering, the server had to keep checking with the chef/manager about what she could and couldn't have. I'm sure it was annoying, but it probably would have sucked more for all involved if she passed out or broke out in hives while in the restaurant. Turns out she couldn't have her first choice, something with a potato pancake (there was flour), so she chose the smoked salmon omelet. She was also told that she couldn't have the home fries, which accompanied the omelet, since they're cooked with the same utensils that they cook the other stuff with (and they couldn't--or wouldn't--use a separate pan/utensils so the girl could have some home fries). So our waiter gives her options of what she can have as a substitute: sauteed spinach, fresh fruit, mushrooms, a side salad. She opts for the spinach. And without telling her or asking her, they CHARGE her for the spinach. It's a measly three bucks, but it's the principle of the matter; they should have asked or at least have had the courtesy of letting her know that it was going to be an extra $3 for the spinach. \\n\\nI had also ordered the smoked salmon omelet, and it was okay, but nothing to write home about. I was ravenous, so I ate the whole thing, but I definitely did not think it was worth $15. I also had the home fries, which were curiously not hot--they were actually cold. One of my friends had the the quesadilla, and she said it was okay, and another friend had the crab cake benedict and said it was amazing. I'd say that I would get the crab cake benedict next time I go there for brunch, but I can pretty much guarantee that I will never willingly set foot in that restaurant again.

The Significant other orders the rich and flavorful Mongolian Beef, rich and sweet but still robust with beefy flavor.\\n\\nThe service is not bad, there's one guy and regulars will know who I'm talking about who loves to clown around with customers, quite the entertainer he is. \\nIt's a nice place to go late night but remember, CLOSED ON WEDNESDAY.

Should have gone somewhere else!\\n\\nMy wife and I had a wonderful experience at Sabatino's for lunch three weeks ago. We decided to make a reservation for New Year's with another couple and were expecting the same experience.\\n\\nOur party arrived 2 minutes before our reservation time and they said it would be a 20 minute wait. The four of us were understanding, considering this is one of the busiest nights of the year. After waiting a total of 60 minutes after that conversation, we were still standing on a cramped ramp, holding drinks from the bar, waiting for a table to open up.\\n\\nWe then asked if we could push two high top tables together since we had waited so long and they had remained open the whole time. One of the owners complied until she saw that my friend's back was pretty close to the table behind us and told us we would have to sit in a horse shoe as to not disturb the other diners. When my friend, very calmly, told her that the situation was unacceptable, she became angry, swore at him, and told him she wanted him out. This is not an inflated account. \\n\\nAt this point, I decided to be the bigger person and leave but pay the bar tab that was still outstanding. I met the other owner who was working the bar, Mike, who was very nice, understanding......like this has happened before. As we were standing there she came over to us and started trying to defend her actions. My wife then came over and told us she was uncomfortable and wanted to leave. She and another member of our party left the restaurant and were followed out by Mike and then the other owner, asking them to come back in.  She said it would only be a ten minute wait and she was sorry that she wrecked out night. We tried to put it behind us and decided to give it another try. This was a mistake. After another 25 minutes of waiting,  a reservation, and a confrontation- we left. \\n\\nWe ended up at another restaurant, 2 minutes away, no wait, friendly staff, and clearly a better choice."},{"name":"Tasca Restaurant","address":"1612 Commonwealth Ave","city":"Brighton","stars":"4","text":"Alright, kids - leave your large bags at home and keep your elbows in.

The pancetta, which I now know to be thick-cut bacon thanks to the thoughtful reply I got when I asked my server was somewhat hard to swallow at times but the taste was incredibly satisfying as was also the case for the farm fresh egg doused with a touch of chive. I usually have my eggs in scrambled form so the full bodied oomph of the egg was a robust surprise.\\nBe good to yourself and ask for second helpings of the blissful ciabatta bread. Offered with lemon curd spread it's heavenly. The lemon is a novel change of peace from the standard butter. Feels about the same going down but just as rewarding if not more so.\\nIt is in fact possible to order an entree combining tastes you wouldn't expect would work together but do. Such was the case with my ravioli. To many of us grapefruit is one of those morning possibilities. I don't tend to like it standing alone because the citric flavor is too jarring. In a pasta dish it offers a nice contrast to the creaminess of the noodles and mascarpone cheese. In a way I felt like Shawn did a commendable job luring me out of my usual cuisine comfort zone. Did it make me a grapefruit convert? No, but it did give me an appreciation for what citrus brings to the table and for how it enhances entrees if used  in sparing amounts.\\nOn we go to the true most important meal of the day...dessert. Sure you won't be as healthy hitching your wagon to dessert but in the grand scheme of things is that really a deal-breaker? Supreme props to the White Chocolate Panna Cotta. I would have concluded my meal a happy camper on the basis of the walnut gelatto alone but, as was true with the previous dinner courses, the dessert offered me multiple adventuresome tastes for the price of one item. The white chocolate mold was divine. The candied walnut balanced the smoothness of the chocolate and gelatto with an appealing crunchiness. I'd easily recommend this to future patrons.\\nOther Yelpers have talked about the how ambience was a strong selling point. I wasn't so impressed. Was a little too antiseptic in appearance. This joint is best appreciated either on the second level or, at least while the thermometer isn't in the danger zone, al fresco. The wrap around white leather booths were pleasant. I'm just saying Andiamo's is an example of an Italian restaurant that pays a bit more attention to setting a mood. However, that doesn't detract much from the classy dining experience Olive & June's treated me to. Within the first month it's already gotten tongues loosened and with good reason.

The sandwich was virtually inedible; it was completely doused in salt, burnt, and tasted like something out of a car. I cooked dinner for my girlfriend so she actually had something to eat. My Fat Cheeks tray was tasteless and cold and the brisket, pulled pork and pork belly were sitting in a solid 1/2 inch of a mixture of water and oil. The collard greens on the side weren't cooked through at all, and I barely touched the broccoli casserole. I put a slight dent in the mac and cheese, but every single item on the menu tasted like it came out of a box or worse.

This place smells better than almost any other restaurant I've been in I think.  The open kitchen lets the smell of quickly roasting pizza crusts permeate the entire establishment and, from the second you open the front door, you're about ready to steal a pizza from other happy customers just to bypass the wait while yours cooks!\\n\\nAnyway, I came here to catch up with a friend from college last night and we decided to grab a pitcher of Sam's Seasonal brew on tap (Noble Pils as of last night) and try two half-pizzas.  We went with the #1 (their version of cheese) and the #5 (a thin layer of mashed potatoes spread over a pizza crust).  Here's what we thought of the two pizzas...\\n\\n#1.  The cheese was gooey and the sauce had a great rustic texture to it with chunks of tomatoes and the right mix of herbs and spices.  Their grilling process for the pizzas gave it a great crispy and flavorful (think wood-stove) thin crust with the perfectly textured gooey toppings!  If you're looking to try their \\"grilled\\" pizzas but aren't too interested in venturing away from the norm, this will surely grab your attention and make you at least consider trying one of their other flavors!\\n\\n#5.  The potato pizza...Cambridge 1 describes it as \\"potato, fontina, parmigiano, romano, rosemary, garlic\\".  I'll go with surprisingly great.  With my friend going through a vegetarian phase, we couldn't go with some of the other choices (meat sauce pizza, grilled chicken with roasted peppers, or the steak and cherry tomatoes would've been my choices) so we decided to try the potato pizza, much to my skepticism.  Well, it's great...definitely worth trying!  It has the same crispy and flavorful crust but with a soft mushy mixture of \\"smashed\\" potatoes and original cheeses.  Having been on a diet this \\"cheat night\\" very much satisfied my consistent cravings for mashed potatoes!\\n\\nNow for the down sides...the only things holding this back from getting 5 stars for me were the volume and the service.  Because the seating arrangements are either long booths (that you'll be sharing with strangers if your party isn't large enough to fill one) or closely positioned tables, it tends to get very noisy.  We were sitting at a small table for 2 or 4 and we even had trouble hearing one another when the place got over a dull roar.  The service wasn't quite the drawback that the noise level was, but a couple things caught my eye.  It's a very laid back service environment from the hostess doing her homework at the windowsill bar upon the entrance to the casual attitudes of the waitresses.  Our waitress was attentive at the beginning, taking our drink order quickly and taking our meal order upon delivering our pitcher, but things trailed off after the food came.  I think she checked in only once in about 40 minutes and, when we were down to half a beer each, it took her about 15 minutes to deliver the check without asking if we wanted to try the ice cream tiramisu (their only dessert option) or have a glass of coffee (usually a staple when one or more people at the table has had three beers...).  I'll be fair and state that it was pretty busy in there for a weeknight and that she was friendly and a bit talkative through everything, but having read the comments on the service in other reviews I thought that I should at least mention my experience.\\n\\nAll-in-all, I loved the pizza and will surely be coming back when I'm craving a full-flavored pizza with a less-than-mainstream beer to go with it!

Not that it's a bad thing, definitely makes Pacific Poke who they are, but I found it difficult to match my toppings and I didn't want to give up a topping. I ended up going with avocado nori (+1 in custom bowls), pomegranate seeds, bean sprouts, green onion, wasabi peas, and seaweed salad, topped with wasabi mayo.

To finish off, I tried the strawberry green tea. It wasn't as I expected. The first sip made me think I had the wrong drink entirely. They changed the recipe recently and added yuzu (yuzu lemonade?

Besides the fact that I could afford it on my teaching salary, I also really loved most of the dishes I got-- specifically anything with goat cheese, the garlic shrimp, and the veggie tower (eggplant, zucchini, peppers perhaps?). I forget their \\"real\\" names.  There was also a live guitarist which was exciting. I only deducted a star because I have a hard time giving out 5 stars (I'm a perfectionist) and I wasn't thrilled with the short ribs. Also, it was uncomfortably hot in there. Otherwise, delicious. I can't wait to go back."},{"name":"Northstar Caf√©","address":"4241 N High St","city":"Columbus","stars":"4","text":"OK.. I will make a trip to Columbus just to eat at Northstar Caf√© !

The best part is that they're open until 0300, which gives another option for late night munchies.\\n\\nThe interior is a bit dated - the owners didn't renovate when they took over from the previous ones.  1990s-style wood trim, and bare walls with posters stuck all over.  The waiting area is woefully tiny, and the front door doesn't close properly.  Every time someone walks in, the entrance area freezes.  The waiting area got so full that we had a crowd of 6-8 people standing literally behind our chairs for 30 minutes or so as we were eating.\\n\\nStaff are a bit slow, but that's because the place is so busy it's a war zone. \\n\\nThe best deal seems to be the combination dinner.  It comes with soup and dessert as well.\\n\\nVegetable soup - a bit salty, but good flavour.\\n\\nSalty peppery lobster - actually quite well done.  Nice and flavourful, thanks to the jalapenos.\\n\\nDeep-fried prawns in soy sauce - not too salty.  Actually works well.  Surprisingly not too greasy, even though they're deep fried.\\n\\nGarlic pea shoots - nice light flavour.\\n\\nCrispy chicken - prawn chips were not as crisp as I would've liked (similar feel to Styrofoam).  But the chicken was very well done.\\n\\nSeafood and tofu hot pot - special mention.  Most hot pots at other places are a mush of sauce, but the ingredients on this one are nice and fluffy.  Normally I try to avoid such dishes, but this one won me over.\\n\\nTapioca dessert - served lukewarm.  Good flavour, and not too sweet.\\n\\nThe food here is very reasonably priced.  The bill was only $70 for all of the items listed.\\n\\nI will definitely be back.

Not only that, but the burritos were nicely wrapped (and didn't have sauce leaking out of the bottom). The tacos were crisp, had plenty of cheese on them and the lettuce was still chilled.
