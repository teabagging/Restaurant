Next time I'll order and pick up sides to go and leave the BBQ to my husband."},{"name":"Ramen Tatsu-Ya","address":"8557 Research Blvd, Ste 126","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"I got the tsukemen, my wife got the tonkotsu with a \\"spice bomb\\". We also ordered a chasu rice bowl and a side of gyoza. We weren't planning on eating that much, honestly. The cashier told us that the noodle machine was broken, so it might take up to 10-15 minutes from the moment we ordered for the bowls to come out, so it might be a good idea to get some rice bowls and sides while we waited. On top of the 15 minutes we had already been waiting in line outside, it was quite a wait, but really it wasn't a problem at all.\\n\\nWhat was curious to my wife was the fact our ramen came out really quickly. Within 3 or 5 minutes and it was brought to us. Great, right? But our rice bowl and gyoza came out 5 minutes after that. Awesome, right? But we could hear the cashier still telling every customer that their noodle machine was broken and suggesting more sides for the wait. Was this just a clever way of upselling? Was this an actual kitchen emergency that they fixed and nobody thought to tell the cashier? Was it deceitful? I can't really say. I'm not taking any stars offs for that, but it's something I do feel like is necessary to mention in case anyone else encounters a similar predicament.\\n\\nOnto the actual review. \\n\\nI'll start with the positives. The eggs were perfectly cooked. Nice and soft boiled, delicious tamari soy marinated, I'm sure. Noodles for the tonkotsu were really nicely cooked also, and perfect for slurping. Noodles for the tsukemen were also cooked really nicely. Good texture with a tad bit of firmness, perfect for slurping and picking up the tsukemen \\"broth\\". (See why I thought it was so weird that they said their noodle machine was broken? The noodles were the best part!). Gyoza were also cooked very well. Grilled on one side, steamed throughout, like every delicious gyoza.\\n\\nNow onto why I only gave 2 stars. Chasu bowl was not good. Meat was dry, unflavorful and it did not taste good. \\n\\nTonkotsu broth was not good either. It was underseasoned, lacked flavor depth and it was not hot when delivered to us. We thought it would be better with the spice bomb, but it wasn't very spicy at all. It didn't look like a home made spice that'd enhance the flavor either. It looked and tasted exactly like a spoonful of gochujang from the grocery store. Sorry, but if I wanted to cover up a weakly flavored broth with some store bought gochujang, I could've eaten at home. My favorite thing about tonkotsu generally is the flavor complexity from all the different components of the bowl. It didn't taste complex, it didn't taste rich and it didn't taste good\\n\\nThe tsukemen was not good either. I saw lime in the ingredients list and thought maybe there'd be a hint of it. What I ate tasted like pork ceviche. My Lord the lime flavor was overpowering. It blew my mind that they supplied an EXTRA lime in the bowl in case I wanted more. I get it. Some ramen chefs want a hint of citrus on the noodles. It adds a bit of flavor, makes you want a little more, but I think I can safely say lime is not, and should never be a star of tsukemen dipping broth. There was also a hint of a burnt ash taste in the broth, which I didn't dislike but it did catch me off guard. I'd say it was a decent little surprise. I feel like I have to say the conventional \\"I've eaten ramen all around the world, including Japan\\" line out there, and I know there are so many different ways that ramen can be made. You might like it. I did not like this version in any way. \\n\\nThe chasu for each of the ramen bowls was burnt also. I understand putting it on the grill, so you can have that nice char when delivering the food to the customer, or before the merinade process so you can seal in the soy/mirin/sake flavors, but it was burnt.\\n\\nIf you've never had ramen, you might give this place a shot. Once you're ready for the real stuff, barring a trip to Japan, head over to a nearby Mitsuwa grocery store food court to eat a good version. I'm never coming here again, even if they paid me."},{"name":"Stubb's Bar-B-Q","address":"801 Red River St","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"Definitely eat here in person for the full experience!

My chicken taco salad was very average without much flavor. The chicken was cooked nicely but had very little seasoning or flavor to it. I found myself wishing I could add actual salad dressing to it to add some flavor. I did find the black beans after I started breaking the shell apart. They were UNDER the taco shell, spread on the plate itself and the taco shell set on top. Not in the taco salad at all. That was different. My husband's fajitas were very average too. The cuts of carne asada were nicely cooked and good sized but there wasn't good seasoning or flavor to the beef either. \\n\\nWe left a little disappointed in the entire meal and went to look for dessert elsewhere.

BIG MISTAKE.\\nWent last Sat night and got the \\"first timer's treatment.\\"  Arrived 5 min early for our 6 pm reservation and waited 20 min for a table (expected this based on reviews, so not a big deal)\\nThe bread basket was embarrassing.  Cold slices of Italian bread w butter.  Come on, you're an Italian restaurant, at least serve bread fresh from the oven and give me some olive oil!\\nWe ordered fried calamari as an appetizer.  Waitress said they didn't have it.  Interesting, since you claim w your no menu concept that you can make \\"anything,\\" and we also heard another table ask what was in the frutti de mare and calamari was mentioned.  Not to mention, the pics of fried calamari on Yelp.  We decided to each order an eggplant rollatini instead.  $7.95 each? Highway robbery! The eggplant was sliced way too thick, there was too much ricotta cheese and not enough marinara sauce (which turned out to be an OK thing since the sauce was flavorless). The only thing that gave this any flavor was the tiny shred of fresh basil on top.\\nFor entrees I ordered the chicken marsala over homemade fusili and my husband ordered the fusili w meatballs. \\nThe marsala was made w CANNED mushrooms.  GROSS! The marsala sauce had good flavor, but they were skimpy w the pasta.

I ate all of my pasta and one piece of chicken (there were 3 pieces in the order).\\nMy husband was not happy w his fusili and meatballs either.  The meatballs looked (and tasted) boiled, not pan fried, as they claimed on their Phantom Gourmet clip.  There was no crunch to the meatball at all.

In the past, the spot was a little out of the way for me, but lately a lot of new shops and restaurants seem to be springing up in the Garden City Plaza. The area around B√°nh M√¨ Tr√®s Bon is definitely more lively now. \\n\\nThe restaurant is quite small with a few individual two tops, a large shared table, and a high top counter by the window. I dropped by at around 2:30pm on a Saturday and it was still quite full. Turnover looked quick. However, since there wasn't a waiting area in the small space, I ended up doing a stroll around the plaza to wait for the rush to die down. \\n\\nThe restaurant set up is a little confusing for first-timers. Initially, I thought this was more of a self-serve cafe set-up, as the first thing you see when you walk in is a cash till and a large menu beside it. However, I noticed other customers indicating their party size to the staff and waited to be seated. Staff would seat customers down with menus and glasses of water, so I guess they just had a bit of an unconventional setup. \\n\\nI sampled the b√°nh m√¨ platter (3 mini subs -traditional, meatball, and, chicken), as well as the grilled pork b√°nh m√¨ and the shrimp and pork salad roll. The menu is relatively smaller than your average Vietnamese restaurant, but there is still a bit of everything from Vietnamese cuisine for you to try. I would like to go back too try the pho or the vermicelli bowls next time, as they looked pretty good too. \\n\\nAll the b√°nh m√¨ had good flavour. The meats were very juicy and there was ample pickled veggies/cilantro/cucumber. The hot sauce and jalape√±os have a nice kick. Bonus points for staff being attentive and double checking that I was could handle the spiciness. Their baguettes have a thicker, hardier crust to it, giving the sandwich more crunch overall. Personally, I prefer baguettes with a thinner crust. The shrimp cracker for garnish was a nice touch. I also liked how they sliced the sandwiches in half for all orders. Not only does it make it less messy to eat, but also makes sharing easier. \\n\\nThe shrimp and pork salad rolls seemed like they are made to order as well. The leafy greens were fresh, vermicelli was tender, and the rice paper wrapping had that perfectly moist, elastic texture to it. \\n\\nWhile the seating was a little cramped, the space had a nice French cafe vibe to it. With the added decor touches and the quality of the food, I don't mind paying their slightly higher price point. They are in the midst of expanding the current space right now. I look forward to seeing how the expansion turns out.

Very standard side salad, but nicer greens than at OG. \\n\\nI ordered the Veal and prosciutto cappelini and the boyfriend order Tony's Own Fettucini. We were both pleased. First off, the portions were huge. Second, my boyfriend said the seafood in his entree was awesome, the shrimp was fresh and mild and the scallops were cooked perfectly. He really enjoyed it. Mines was great too, the veal was tender and the proscuitto was slightly crisp. The peas were perfect. The dish was seasoned correctly and the past was cooked just right. \\n\\nFor the two of us the whole huge meal was only $45 with tax, but with the Entertainment book coupon, it was only $30. Woot! It was much more satisfying and comfortable than a $70 trip to Brio. \\n\\nWill we be back? Definitely!

As others have noted the crust was a bit hard and dark on the outer edges and wet in the center. There was a LOT of pineapple which made my  teen happy. Overall it was an adequate pizza.

Got a large \\"Desano's.\\" Lower case m meh.  Don't, don't, don't believe the hype.\\n\\nIf yr craving a foldable slice of classic NYC St Mark's style pepperoni this place doesn't do that kind of greasy wheel.  ESPies has that kind of NYC, Joey Ramone approved style pie down & it's inexplicably hard for any pizzeria in Austin to match east side pies' version.  It ain't that hard.  Lots of by the slice shotgun dives do it all over the 5 boroughs all day long since the dawn of time or something.\\n\\nThat said, Desano's dough is great.  The ingredients are obviously fresh & sourced with intense attention to detail and care.  To the point you can see someone kind of wants a pat on the back about it.  To that I say quit fishing.  Shut up and bake pie.  The sausage was superlative.  The sauce and pepperoni were meek.  I found the crust thick,chewy & doughy and the amount of crust overpowered the amount of toppings.  Especially considering the $25 with tip for one large pie price tag. \\n\\nBut this is Desano's version of Neapolitan and this ain't that NYC kind of pie bruv.  \\n\\nThe space is nice and clean and brilliantly lit.  A similar dining area vibe to the one found at Hopdoddy, Mighty Fine, or Rudy's.  Elbow to elbow seating at long tables.  Similar clientele to those places too.

NONE of us will be returning. The service was terrible, the food was mediocre at best (I'm being generous here), and management is ill-qualified to address the concerns of dissatisfied customers. Management was condescending, insulting, self-absorbed, and threatened to call the police if we did not agree to tip our server a (completely undeserved) 18% gratuity which had been added to our bill without informing us first. \\n\\n\\nLong version for those interested in specifics:\\n\\nFinding no one to greet us upon arrival and seeing the \\"Please Seat Yourself\\" sign, we began to look for a table. After wandering around for a while (still with no greeting from anyone) and finding no available tables large enough to accommodate our party of 6, we began to move 2 small tables together. While we were doing this, a server walked by, giving us an irritated look (instead of offering to help us find a suitable table).  I asked, \\"Is this okay?\\" He replied, \\"Yeah, it's fine.\\" But his tone and expression indicated otherwise. He walked away. Turns out, this was our server.\\n\\nWe thought maybe his demeanor would improve after we'd gotten settled, but he was inattentive and carried an attitude like we were an inconvenience to him the entire night. I don't think he smiled once. We had to request water several times. We had to ask about the specials and even then, he rattled them off so quickly and with such disinterest that none of us could understand what he'd said. \\n\\nOnly 2 of the 3 appetizers we ordered were brought to the table. When asked about the 3rd one, he said he thought it was supposed to be an entree, so he'd planned to bring it with the other entrees (even though it was the same as one of the other apps that he had already delivered to someone else at our table). When he brought our food and drinks, he had to ask us who had ordered each item. Since we were a party of 6, I wouldn't have been bothered much by this, but it was just the attitude that accompanied everything. It was like he was just so put out by having to wait on us. When we finally sorted out to whom each item of food belonged, the quality of the food was far below our expectations (especially given the price point and the exceptional quality of previous visits). \\n\\nWhen he brought the checks, 5 out of the 6 checks were wrong. When he came back a second time with the revised checks, we realized that an 18% gratuity had been added to each check. When we asked about this, we were told it was \\"policy\\". This \\"policy\\" is not printed anywhere on the menu, nor was it verbally communicated to us. When we asked the server about this, he began to look over the menu, trying to find if the policy was printed on it anywhere. Unable to find it, he finally just said he didn't know if it was on there or not. We asked to speak with a manager.\\n\\nWhen the manager came to our table, things got even worse. She apologized for the fact that we were not happy with the service with very obvious insincerity. (She did NOT apologize for the poor service itself. The way she phrased it made it VERY clear that she was not willing to acknowledge that the service may, in fact, have been poor.) Instead of acknowledging the validity of our dissatisfaction (or better yet, just re-doing the checks without the gratuity), she indicated that we were to blame because we didn't complain and request a new waiter at the beginning of the evening. (Who does that???) \\n\\nI'll spare the exact details of the back-and-forth that ensued. Suffice it to say, this manager had no interest in addressing the concerns of the customers. She did not listen to what we were saying. Her focus was to find a way to convince us to accept the 18% gratuity. She tried to shift the blame to us, she tried to shame us into feeling guilty for not wanting to complain early in the evening. At one point, one member of our party said she did not want to sign the credit card slip (because she didn't feel she should have to pay 18% for poor service) and the manager told her that then she would just call the police. I am appalled that this manager threatened a customer with police action over a gratuity. No one was saying we didn't want to pay for the meal. We just didn't want to be forced to pay 18% for really poor service. All this manager had to do was remove the gratuity from the bill and let us pay what we thought was fair. Instead, she was condescending, insulted our intelligence, and because some members of our party were so offended, the situation ignited into a scene that affected not only our table, but tables near us. \\n\\nWhat was supposed to be one last memorable night out at one of our favorite old haunts with a friend who is moving out of the country turned into an evening we'd all like to forget, largely due to this manager's insulting attitude and complete incompetence."},{"name":"Bem Bom on Corrine","address":"3101 Corrine Dr","city":"Orlando","stars":"4.5","text":"Enjoy the food here but a 90 minute with is a bit ridiculous especially when there are hardly any people waiting.

I work in a customer service focused industry so when I'm not working, by default, I'm always keen on good and bad customer service cues...and let me tell you, Tommy EXCEEDED my expectations on customer service! He was very personable, friendly, funny and was able to work with us with swapping out certain sides as my fianc√© has certain dietary restrictions (Keto Diet). You know how in general you can tell when workers hate their job by the way they interact and how their overall demeanor and energy are?? Well if you have one conversation with Tommy, you can tell he absolutely LOVES his job by how he raves about the company and by how well he does it! A large party was sat right before us so of course it took a while longer for the food (which is out of his control) But Tommy kept us informed on the status of our order so we never felt like our order was forgotten. But oh boy once our food hit the table?!? The crabs, the \\"FLAVA\\" of the food was impeccable, hands down best kitchen out of all the locations too! He mentioned that this location was the training location and I see why!! There was literally NOTHING negative about our visit.

So yes, I have had the absolute best when it comes to ramen. Whew.\\n\\nThat said, Ramen Tatsu-Ya is not the best ramen you will ever have. But it is pretty damn good. It all comes down to the broth. Thick and hearty and cloudy, just like it should be. Seriously, the broth here is delicious and almost makes up for any deficiencies elsewhere. To supplement the broth, I suggest the spicy bomb. It's basically a mixture of peppers that adds a nice kick to your broth. And you can easily share a bomb, since I doubt one person will use it all.\\n\\nOn the other hand, the actual ramen noodles are simply bad. In fact, I wouldn't qualify them as ramen noodles. Too thin and too hard, the noodles are exactly the same as egg noodles in Vietnamese dishes. Normally egg noodle dishes come with a much lighter broth. So the thin, hard noodles they use here don't take advantage of the delicious broth. My friend, who is also Asian, agreed. The wrong noodles were used here. Which is a shame, because almost everything else was spot on.\\n\\nI look forward to seeing how Michi Ramen will compare, once it reopens. Ramen Tatsu-Ya run a tight, efficient ship. There is a line, but it moves smoothly. And you don't feel rushed once you actually do get to eat. But the lack of decent noodles keeps me from completely recommending this place.

You can tell who the tourists are and who the local people are for sure. Tourists = photos before eating, locals = no photos, and weird stares. \\n\\nI came here in the morning an hour after they opened and the wait time was 15 - 20 minutes. Not bad, during that time I ended up walking around the neighborhood. When they called my name to come in we were seated immediately. The moment I walked in, I saw a bartender just making drinks at the bar, the man was really cute. MMMM. Anyways, when we sat down the server, Peter, was just absolutely amazing! Ask for him next time you come in, he was so great to us! \\n\\nPeter, was awesome in suggesting us things to try and eat, giving us tips on which dishes and drinks he felt were the best deal, and just constantly checking up on us throughout our time there. When he came to take our order after giving us our drinks, he was amazingly quick and put our food order in right away. I ordered the Lowcountry Breakfast Shrimp & Grits ($15.25) and my friend whom I was sharing my meal with ordered the Screen Door Fried Chicken and Waffle ($11.25 for 1 piece of chicken).\\n\\nLowcountry Breakfast Shrimp & Grits: Yes the price is expensive for a breakfast and HELL YES IT IS WORTH IT. This dish was legitimately a dish I could not stop eating. It was so effin' good. It comes with 4 very large and well seasoned shrimp. The sauce they put on top of the grits were OUT OF THIS WORLD. Bacon, Garlic and Tomatoes along with some other magic juju blew my mind and my tastebuds were doing mini summersaults because of the flavor explosion. The grits were creamy, cheesy and just so perfectly cooked, I couldn't even handle. This meal also came with two eggs, cooked to your liking, and a biscuit which was just perfect. I would WITHOUT A DOUBT, ORDER THIS DISH AGAIN. Worth EVERY. SINGLE. PENNY. \\n\\nScreen Door Fried Chicken and Waffle: This wasn't as great as my Shrimp & Grits, but these waffles here are OUTRAGEOUSLY good. The sweet potato waffle reminded me of a pumpkin spice sort of flavor but better. Definitely beats Roscoe's Chicken and Waffles without a doubt. The chicken they give you is very large and was the perfect portion for my friend and I to split. A bit on the dry side, the chicken, this dish was great but I'm sorry I don't think I would order this dish if I came back because those Shrimp & Grits definitely got to me... but I would ask to order a side of these Waffles, they really were great. \\n\\nMy other friends got other dishes such as the Warm Shortcake W/ Seasonal Fruit ($8.50) -- a good portion but definitely left my friend a bit hungry even after consuming, -- Screen Door Praline Bacon Waffle ($9.50) -- the praline bacon WAS SO EFFIN' GOOD it blew my mind, a combination of salty and sweet and just perfectly cooked and coated, I was tempted to buy just a side and the Screen Door Fried Chicken and Waffle, 2 piece ($13.25).\\n\\nOverall, this place rocked our worlds. It is such a great place to eat at, without a doubt. Even though there is a wait, the wait is worth it! Screen Door definitely is a great place to eat at if you really want that \\"homemade, made with love and extra juju\\" type-feel of food.

That cool logo/mascot is great for tourist to get some fun pictures with and try a new local restaurant! Upon entry we were told there was going to be a small wait and they would text us when our table was ready--no big deal. We didn't receive a single text after waiting 20 mins so when I told the host he said oh no worries there's tables on the third floor just go tell them your name and your party number.... we wait for what?? \\n\\nOn our way up to the Thur floor the restaurant had some very cool attributes that made is very unique. Once we got to our seat our waitress greeted us and asked if she could walk us through the menu since it was our first time there but we already knew what new things we wanted to try! So i ordered the black and Brie burger--it was so DELICIOUS, the only problem with my burger was once I ate my way to the middle of it, it was SUPER RARE and i don't know about you, but I don't want to eat a raw meat hamburger  but from what I was able to eat it was great. I also ordered a shrimp tempura roll and that was wonderful as well. My two brothers (both buff young men) ordered the bento box, they were super excited to get a hamburger, sushi, fries, and a couple little typical sushi sides all in one order--when it came their expectations were super high for this deal but it was so small the \\"meal\\" couldn't have fed anyone with an appetite over the age of 5, not to mention it was expensive for what you're actually getting . So once we saw how little the boy's orders were we got a few more sushi rolls that were also great! \\n\\nI would have given the restaurant more stars if my burger would have been cooked to an actual edible temperature and if my brothers's orders would have been actual adult meals. Besides those hiccups this restaurant was a great experience and our waitress was very kind and attentive! \\n\\nIf you dine here make sure you ask about portion sizes and ensure that your burger, at a self proclaimed \\"burger and sushi joint\\" is actually cooked to a proper edible temperature!"},{"name":"Lonesome Dove Western Bistro","address":"419 Colorado St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"One of a kind!

A veggie burger patty is needed and I'm sure it's not the first they've heard of this.  However to be fair.........they do what they do best and there's better veggie options elsewhere.

We had WAY too much food.\\n\\nThat being said, the brisket was SUPER juicy and flavorful.  It has been a while since I've had brisket, but I'm pretty sure that was one of the best briskets I've ever had.  The ribs, sausage, and pulled pork were good as well, but not nearly as memorable as the brisket.\\n\\nThe sides weren't that great.  The person taking our order said the potato salad was \\"mustard based\\", and that made it sound appealing.  However, I'd say it was vinegar based, as that was all I could taste.  The slaw was good, but nothing spectacular. The pinto beans had piece of brisket in it, but it seemed the pinto beans needed to be cooked a little longer.\\n\\nIf you're military, you get a free slice of pie.  I didn't find this out until after our hands were all greasy, so I didn't take a picture of it, but I had the bourbon banana.

I think I had it for 3 more meals and it was almost as tasty each time.  The only downfall for my leftovers was my hotel microwave.\\n\\nBased on the time that I had to wait, about 2.5 hours total, I would say it was worth the wait.

He didn't have to explain much as their menu is quite simple which I particularly like.  My wife elected on the beef and barley soup along with a lobster cobb while I ordered the 10z filet.  Our starter was the crab gratin along with some strong libations such as 10yr Whistle Pig.  The hot bread is phenomenal as was the crab gratin.  Our dishes were amazing as well as my filet was perfectly seared on both sides and a nice pink (medium) in the center.  It was accompanied by a nice broccoli rabe which was not oily as one may see at other venues.  We finished the meal with a coffee creme brulee which was also heavenly.

It's a small bar, like maybe 8 seats max but the bartender was so fast and efficient at multi-tasking and making drinks for the whole restaurant. Every time food was delivered, the person would say enjoy and it was ready so fast!!! \\n\\nFood - omg the brisket was so tender and flavorful, gotta order it fatty! Jalape√±o cheddar sausage was good, you can taste the melted cheddar. Ribs were decent. BBQ sauce was yummy. I liked it mixed with the spicy BBQ sauce together for a kick and tang. I almost bought a bottle home to Cali but didn't want to check my luggage! The jalape√±o cornbread is also worth trying with real jalape√±o and corn pieces, and the honey butter complements it very well. The brisket chili was really good. The Fox-a-roni (Mac and cheese topped with stew) was good....unique but I think I would have preferred trying the stew and Mac and cheese separately. The stew overpowered the Mac. \\n\\nDrinks - Though they have a wide variety of drinks on the menu it would have been extremely helpful if the beer list included the specific type of beer versus simply categorizing. I had to google what \\"Sweet Water Blue\\" was. Which was a wheat ale enhanced with blueberries; it paired well with our meal! \\n\\nNote - if you are to order the combo plates and if you wanted the jalape√±o cheddar sausage, do not order it as an item! Because 2 items are $18, 3 items $25, $4 items $30 and to add the sausage as a solo item it is only $4. So my point is we would have saved $3 if we got 2 item combo plate and added 1 sausage for $18+$4=$22 rather than $25 for 3 items.

Fuck off. Everyone hyped this place up so much but when me and my friends got there we were thoroughly disappointed. I've eaten a lot, a LOT of ramen. The quality of ramen here tastes like a second hand, run down budget ramen shop in a hick town. The chashu was so hard, like I had to rip through it with my teeth to eat it. It was insanely tough and plain. It's supposed to be soft and tender but it was so hard and felt like they just overcooked it, froze it and then just put in the broth not to waste it. The egg was almost completely hard boiled when the yolk should be soft and have a sort of jelly like consistency. It wasn't marinated long enough either so it just tasted like plain egg in soup. Finally, the most important part, the broth, was so was god damn oily. I'm surprised I didn't get acne around my mouth the next week because of how oily it was. I couldn't finish it because of how god damn oily it was. And because oil is less dense than the broth, it's going to be at the top of your soup every time, which is why there can't be too much of it. Every time I drank some soup my mouth was just covered in oil and I had to wipe it off each time. Broth wasn't so flavourful either. Not horrible, but nowhere up to par of the title of best ramen in Texas. I wanted to like this place, but this is just sad. I wouldn't even come here again, that's how bad it was. I'm convinced this place was hyped up because of people who have never eaten ramen before. They ate here for the first time without knowing what they were eating, and just assumed it was good because it's 'exotic' and 'cultured' food.

I also really enjoyed their sausage but I thought it was on the smaller side. The one dish that I didn't enjoy as much was their pulled pork. It was good but it definitely needed to be just drowning in their sauce to have any flavor. As for the sides, the jalape√±o cornbread was just divine with their honey butter. I probably ate the whole slice by myself. The sides were good but nothing special. Just your average coleslaw and mac & cheese. \\n\\nWe were pleasantly happy with our meal here!

It's all Israeli style, so there will be minor differences than some are used to but they are amazing choices you won't find many places and gives you a chance to try something new.  I mean where else will you find an Iraqi Jewish breakfast sandwich?  \\n\\nTheir falafel sandwich comes uniquely wrapped in a stellar pita with grilled eggplant, hummus, roasted red peppers, fresh mesculin salad mix, and a slew of other things I'm forgetting.  The falafel itself is the real star, and grade A.  No dry mix here, it's green garlicky goodness and you get your money's worth.  $7 gets you a sandwich and it doesn't disappoint. What a great find.\\n\\nIt's tucked away in a small courtyard just up from Failing and Mississippi.  Luckily they have it all to themselves, and you can take your time at one of their picnic tables and not feel crammed in with several food trucks all giving you the stink eye for not eating at their place.  Plus they have a portable bathroom just behind them which makes a nice touch you don't have everywhere.  \\n\\nWell thought out Wolf and Bear!  You more than passed the test for this reviewer and unabashed falafel hunter!!!!"},{"name":"Franklin Barbecue","address":"900 E 11th St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"I've never waited in line for hours to try food before and wasn't looking forward to waiting at Franklin.

The problem with Bisq is even the service was disappointing. The waiter was extremely low energy and engaged with us minimally. Even when I asked if he had any recommendations, he said that the menu changes so often he couldn't offer any. He did offer some unhelpful direction saying the \\"first page\\" of the menu is small plates and the \\"second page\\" is more entree size plates... LISTEN there were only three things on the so called \\"second page\\" (fried chicken, cheese burger, and a bolognese dish) so why he thought this comment would be helpful is unclear. Let's get into the food...\\n\\nSpanish Octopus- this was pretty good. For comparable restaurants with 3 dollar signs, I have had similar dishes with much more flavor. But this dish is pretty decent. The spicy paste/sauce was the best part.\\n\\nChinese Broccoli- Also just okay. The flavor was kind of like a salsa verde sauce, which was one dimensional. Again, not enough flavor. We even added the spicy sauce from the octopus dish, because it just lacked in depth.\\n\\nFried Chicken- Don't believe the hype, this fried chicken was so disappointing. How can you only have two entree/main dish options and serve fried chicken like this???  The thing about fried chicken as a dish is it is so simple and such an American classic that you have to nail it. Why does the Boston food scene lack seasoning and flavor? Seriously, I have gone to fast food chicken places and gotten more flavor. I will say the texture was good, it was nice and crispy. But there was WAYYY too much breading. The chicken to breading ratio was really strange. I ran out of actual chicken and was only eating fried skins...ugh. And you know what, that may have been fine if it had a decent flavor. I am so skeptical of all you reviewers who recommended this chicken, it makes me wonder if ya'll have ever had genuinely delicious fried chicken. Underwhelming doesn't even capture the feeling.\\n\\nOverall, not impressed and won't go back again. At the end of our meal the waiter did not even ask how our dinner was, which is unfortunate because I was ready to tell them in great detail.  I try to be fair and provide feedback when it is sought out. When I go to a restaurant that has food that is just okay, I can usually look past it for a good experience or vibe. Sadly, it didn't make up for the lack of flavor so I can only give 3 stars. Don't waste your money here."},{"name":"Sugar Factory","address":"8371 International Dr, Ste 70","city":"Orlando","stars":"3","text":"I had such a great time here celebrating my anniversary.

Also, they claim to be \\"Indian Fusion\\", but at least what was available for lunch was standard Indian fare. Here's what I chose for the 3 item combo:\\n\\nSaffron Goat Curry - First off, I could not taste any saffron. Do they call it \\"Saffron\\" only after their name or is there really saffron in it? Hard to tell with no saffron flavor. Second, it was super salty and strangely tasted more and more salty the more I ate it.\\n\\nChicken Tikka Masala - It tasted like dry canned chicken in Campbell's tomato soup. I fancy myself somewhat of a Chicken Tikka Masala connoisseur and this was not very good in my opinion.\\n\\nSaag - This was pretty good, or at least seemed better when laid next to the other 2 dishes.\\n\\nThe lemon rice was good as was their naan which was fresh and crispy (probably the best thing on the table).

I didn't intend on buying pizza however when I walked in and saw the display of food, I HAD to walk out with something. I ended up ordering a pepperoni slice but then changed my mind bc it was so huge and I was supposed to have a big dinner later on, however when a fresh batch came out, I changed my mind AGAIN. I love how one of the employees asked twice if I wanted to pass up before giving in lol.\\nThe slices are pretty hefty and thick - oh and the freaking breadsticks....Jesus. I got the pesto basil or something breadstick and it was fantastic. I ate the whole thing even tho after the slice I was dying of a full stomach. And the ranch was also very good and tasty. Pretty creamy and you could tell it was authentic and homemade.

I love the atmosphere, the decor...something about it just draws you in.\\n\\nUnlike most places that would give you a bread basket to start, The Reef gives you Johnny Cakes. These are deep fried corn bread balls, which are super crispy on the outside and airy on the inside. They come with two sauces: One's a tangy hot sauce, which I'll get into later, and the other is a coconut mango butter. That butter is DELICIOUS! It's ever so slightly fruity and goes great with the Johnny Cakes.\\n\\nFor an appie, we ordered the Jerk Wings (12.00). The interesting thing about these is they're actually baked instead of grilled so they retain all of their juiciness. The marinade was interesting as it had strong cinnamon elements as well as hints of garlic, pepper, and all spice. \\n\\nWhile waiting for our mains, we ordered a Jamaican Homemade Ginger Beer (3.00) and a Pineapple Shake (4.50) to try. The shake was super creamy and was surprisingly not too sweet nor sour. The ginger beer was SUPER POTENT though! It was very spicy and tangy...great way to wash down any meal.\\n\\nFor a main, I ordered the Cuban Mojo BBQ Chicken (16.00). The rice was nice and tomatoey, but the chicken was a bit on the blander side...no matter, we had a lot of that delicious tangy sauce from earlier to use with it. If you're looking for a chicken dish to try though, I'd recommend the Jerk Chicken entree. It comes with that delicious marinade that they use on the wings!"},{"name":"Fox Bros.

Definitely had a heavy hand with the alcohol pour but not complaining, more of a good point. It was the best way to finish our visit to Orlando. \\n\\nFood: We started out with the appetizer of crinkle cut fried pickles. So delicious!! The gf and I inhaled them. Very crisp and satisfying!! For the main dish my gf order The Heavenly Veggie Burger and she said it was the best Vegan burgers she has ever had. She loved it and said the next time we are here, we need to come back. My main dish was The Boursin Bacon Burger. It was mouth watering delicious! I couldn't put it down. I ate it without setting it down, it was that good. \\n\\nService: We waited about 15-20 mins for a text saying they were ready to seat us. From being seated to getting drinks was maybe 5 mins and another 5-10 mins for the appetizer, and about 10 mins after that for the food. All were delivered right as we finished each item.

We had known about IVG and decided to use their ER instead of trekking back and forth to Boston. The staff at IVG were incredible. We had to visit them every 4-7 days for over 2 months. They were always attentive and caring every time we came. Our dog ended up having a couple surgeries there with Dr. Nicole Amato. I cannot say enough wonderful things about Dr. Amato. She went above and beyond for us and our dog. There were times we had to just show up in the office and she always made a little time for us. We had seen all of the ER doctors at some point in our visits, too, and were all incredible. We felt like we were a part of a little family. They made us feel welcome and never rushed us. And our dog, who really disliked being handled, was never afraid and allowed them to do his frequent bandage changes with little protest. When the cancer that was surgically removed came back we had to go to NEVOG in Waltham (who are also a wonderful group) but we would visit IVG and just bounce thoughts and concerns off of Dr. Amato. She was always ready to listen and give her opinion and support even though our dog was no longer her patient. The techs and receptionists who knew our dog often came out to say hello, too. Then the day came when we had to say goodbye; the cancer had won. I had called ahead to see if we might be able to schedule an appointment with Dr. Amato to have him put down, would she do that? She said she absolutely would be there for us and would even come in if we had to bring him on a day she wasn't scheduled. She and the staff were so compassionate, especially that day. We really felt our dog was special to them when they each said goodbye to him. A few days later we received a card with our dog's paw print on it and signed by everyone there. I am a dog walker and petsitter and I have made it a point to make sure my clients know about IVG Metrowest and how to get there.

Individually we all love them, but when you put them together something magical happens.\\n\\nMoojo has about 6-10 different cookies options.  If you don't want a cookie they have these waffle things too.  They also have gluten free and vegan options for those people out there.  I was in a chocolate mood so I got the rocky road cookie.  Then for ice cream they have a bunch of flavors to choose from.  I ended up choosing the cookies and cream on my first visit.  When the ice cream sandwich artist handed me my creation I could tell the cookies were slightly warm.  My first bite I am telling you was magical .. if you are one of those people that thinks magic doesn't exist then you have not been to Moojo clearly.  The chocolate chunks in the rocky road cookie were so creamy good.  The cookies and cream ice cream was paired perfectly. \\n\\nIf you are having trouble deciding what to choose they have some suggestions on the chalk board.  My girl, Kimberly K that was with me on my first visit did one of their suggestions - Bacon me crazy, which is a bacon chocolate chip cookie with vanilla bean ice cream.  My second visit I convinced Tiffany S that she needed some Moojo in her life too and she got the snickerdoodle cookie with salted caramel pretzel ice cream.  \\n\\nSo basically if you are looking for a little magic or joy in your life then look no further because it exists on the drag at this place called Moojo."},{"name":"Fat Matt's Rib Shack","address":"1811 Piedmont Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Why 5 stars?

Maybe it's the divey atmosphere of Fat Matt's that leaves you expecting something different. Then again, the best food is usually found in the dives. Maybe it's the seemingly standard, tangy BBQ sauce that accompanies these little treasures.

Possibly the best ribs ever, an amazing live band and football on a tiny TV in the corner. \\n\\nThis will absolutely be a place I return to the next time I'm in Atlanta."},{"name":"Sushiemon","address":"201 Massachusetts Ave","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"Pretty meh overall. I was really hopeful based on the reviews here that it would be a great AYCE sushi place nearby, but it wasn't that good. The price is obviously good (22$+tax+tip for sushi buffet, a little higher for sashimi). However, they're really not very generous with the fish to rice ratio. All the nigiri had very thin slices of fish, and the rolls were pretty rice heavy. The fish was reasonably fresh, but nothing special. The tuna in particular wasn't very good texturally. What is definitely nice is that they use warm rice, but it unfortunately didn't have a great texture. \\n\\nI hadn't had battera before; turns out, it's definitely not to my taste, as it's lots of rice and a thin layer of sour mackerel (can't blame them for that one obviously). The unagi avocado roll was SUPER sweet and soaked in sauce, the only true fail of the rolls and nigiri I tried. I'm not sure why a previous reviewer said the spicy tuna was spicy; it was not noticeably spicy at all. The main change in the spicy tuna appeared to be a mayo taste to the roll from the sauce. \\n\\nOverall, maybe it's better to get sashimi buffet here, due to the large amount of rice in their sushi. However, I don't think I'll be back, even though I live quite close.\\n\\nEDITED TO ADD: Looking at past reviews, it seems that it is a habit of the owner of this restaurant to bash people who leave even vaguely bad reviews. My previous review was honest about my experience. At no point did I ask for free food or a discount. I got the sushi AYCE because I wanted sushi, not sashimi, and so my review described the sushi I received. I ate all the rice I received, so I don't know why the owner is accusing me of wasting food; perhaps she has confused me for someone else. I have removed a star because the disrespectful response by the owner, and I definitely won't be back. There are much better sushi options in the area. (Please note: the owner edited her comment to remove some insults. It seems Yelp doesn't keep an edit history, but the gist of it was that I had bad taste, was asking for discounts and free food, and my two-star review meant nothing.)"},{"name":"Fox Bros.

We got here at 1230 one day and they were sold out. The next day we showed up at 1030 to wait in line for the best BBQ I could ever imagine! \\n\\n11 til the meat runs out is really how the place works. I have never seen anyone put more passion into their craft. I had the pulled pork and I was told I MUST have some brisket too. A few pieces were placed on my plate as I walked through the line. My husband got straight up brisket. The meats were so tender and full of flavor, they literally melted in my mouth. I loved the three sauces available at the table. All with a different flavor and depth. The sides of cole slaw and beans were phenomenal. I skipped the white bread slices they so generously offer with each plate. I did, however, opt for several glasses of sweet tea. \\n\\nAs we left, we were talking with some of the locals. We were told it is always packed no matter the day or the weather. They also told us not to tell anyone else about Franklin BBQ because they did not want the word getting out. Oops, I had to share.

I almost felt like there wasn't quite enough of the black squid aioli to go around.

I'm told NEXT WEEK. I ask how is that possible who will be doing your deposits, or tallies, and closing and opening the main store. The teen says well the manager is on vacation.

As it is on comm ave and sets itself farther from Newbury, you will find its less street crowded. \\n\\nFood:\\n\\n- (5/5) Buttermilk Fried Chicken wings with white bbq sauce, DELICIOUS! It's not too crispy outside, which I'm fine with but absolutely loved the super moist and tender meat inside. It was super juicy and the slightly tart flavor from the buttermilk was detectable. I didn't even taste the bbq sauce because the chicken batter was heavily spiced and flavored it sorta overwhelmed the sauce, which I'm totally fine with. \\n- (2/5) Warm Honey Glazed Biscuits, pretty disappointing. Biscuit was fairly normal tasting, dry. The sauces wasn't really anything to write home about. Ate one and didn't really bother with the rest. \\n- (3/5) Cast Iron Rabbit and Dumplings, honestly not really impressed with this. The flavors were off, the rabbit meat wasn't very succulent and was actually little dry even in the sauce. This is where you can dip the biscuit in to absorb some of the sauce. \\n\\nThe biggest downgrade to this place is how long it took the food to arrive. The biscuits arrived within 10mins but the rest didn't arrive for 25mins after so we didn't actually start on our entrees until 45mins after ordering.

When we walk in the host/hostesses were pleasant, but they were acting as if they dodn not know what was going on .... Anyways we were seated waaaaaaaay in the back (we had a party of 2) .... It took the server about 5 minutes or so for our server (Jamal) to come to our table and greet us ... \\n\\nOnce we ordered we waited a few minutes and he brought back our drinks, then the salad and bread .... There wasn't even enough salad in the bowl for both of us to enjoy ....\\n\\nThen the food comes ... I ordered a Shrim Fettucine .... When he dropped it off infront of me I made a face because it did not look the way that I am used to .... The tails were left on the shrimp (which is extremely annoying, because I now had to stick my fingers inside the pasta inorder to seperate it), The sause was seperated from the pasta (anyone who has ever been a server knows that that usually means that it was sitting in the window for awhile), and to top it off I had no silverware (so I had to reach over and steal dome from the next table) .....\\n\\nSo he asked me is everything ok, and I told him that it was annoying have the tails on the shrimp and it didn't look that hot, but i would eat it anyways.  He left and never came back.\\n\\nAfter taking a few bites of the pasta I realized that it wasn't going to fly and I wanted to have another one made.  So I sat there and waited for my server to return.  I sat there for at least 10 to 15 minutes (which felt like an eternity) .... Finally I flagged down another server and asked for them to ask my server to come over because I was not happy with my food.  She was very apolpgetic and took my plate.  Aboout 5 minutes later our server comes back. When I see him I say very sarcastically \\"Oh now you remember us\\" ... Apparently that was not what Jamal wanted to hear, he quickly got an attitude and said that he was already working on anoter plate in the back.  But he said it in the tone of \\"Why are you complaing to me right now\\".  I then went on to tell him that it would have been nice if he had communicated that with us instead of having us sit here for all this time not knowing what was going on ....\\n\\nHe got \\"offended\\" and proceeded to talk back to me as if I was in the wrong.  I just got annoyed and he started to walk away.  As he was walking away I turned to my friend and said that this was ridiculous that he should have come back to the table, etc. Well Mr. Jamal stopped and turned aorund and just stared at me, as if he wanted to call me some unflattering names and some more stuff.  I just waved him off and continued to talk to my friend ....\\n\\nAfter waiting for another 10 minutes or so I finally received my food.  By this point my friend has completely eaten his food.  Our server does not come back to check on me and he is nowhere in site ....  I finally get fed up and ask the young lady who was at the other table to please send the manager to the table .... The manager never comes ....\\n\\nBy this point I am exremely PO'd, but its my bday so I am trying to stay in a good mood ... So I ask the lady if she can just bring me a to-go container and the check .... She brings the check and he looks it over and gives her his card ... When she briings him back the check it comes without the itemized bill .... He takes a peak at it and thinks that the bill he origninally saw was a different amount then what the check was, so he wanted to see the receipt.  No one is there ... We sat there for yet another 5 minutes and then I finally got up and stood by the service door and waited for the first person that I saw ....\\n\\nA young man came by and I asked him to please ask Jamal to bring the itemized bill to the table ... As he left another young girl came by and I asked her what was the manager on duties name ..... She told me it was Fran and did I want her to get her for me.  I said no that I tried that already and she didn't come over so I was all set and I was just waiting for my check ....\\n\\nFinally I see Fran, not sure if she just happened to be walking by or is someone told her to come over.  She asked me what was wrong and I just tried to run everything that had happened back to her.  Oh did I mention that Jamal told one of the servers that he wasnt coming back to the table because I was acting \\"ignorant\\" ....\\n\\nSo to rectify the situation the manager took off our bill and gave us a gift certificate to come back.   Not sure if thats going to be happening anytime soon. I think the level of professionalism in this establishement needs a serious boost! \\n\\nFood was better the second time around, btw, but not worth the aggravation! IF i decide to come back, it will probably be JUST for take out ....."},{"name":"Tia's Waterfront","address":"200 Atlantic Ave, Fl 1","city":"Boston","stars":"2.5","text":"Solid three stars.

The mixed vegetables were wet and sloppy and the potatoes were packaged. I'm spoilt, ok, because I'm accustomed to yolks fresh cut truffle fries.

The Mac and cheese was the only dish that I had trouble finishing; it was just a little too rich for me, and I found that with every bite of mac and cheese I took I had to complement it with some beans or a mouthful of catfish.

Hopefully by then, you starved enough to eat pounds and pounds of BBQ meat. The question is was it worth it?... find out my secret \\"trick\\".\\n\\nThe briskets here are probably the best I had, it was tender, flavorful and was just overall perfect. This is the place to go for the briskets! We loved it so much that we ordered more on my second visit here so we can wrap it to go. Surprisingly, it was still just as great when you reheat it, just don't overheat it!\\n\\nPulled Pork was juicy, but a bit on the salty side. Great with the breads though!\\n\\nSausages, not the best I had in Austin, unfortunately. I was looking for that pop in the mouth, but it didn't have it. I thought that the sausages were flavorless in comparison to the briskets and pulled pork. I would order this again, but sticking with the briskets is the best choice. \\n\\nOverall, I think this is a GREAT BBQ spot. I was thinking about rating this 3 stars because I think service is just as important as food when it comes to rating... but it would be silly to give this place 3 stars. With that said, I hope the owners address the long waits. No place is worth a 3-5 hours wait and the owners of this place should address it!!! They need a system that folks reserve a time slot, pay in advance or something, time is of essence! I get the whole work up the hype, pregaming concepts, but I didn't see one face on the line that was thrilled. At least, they provide foldable chairs.\\n\\nSo anyways... the secret...Plan your trip in advance! and try to pre-order Franklins. Franklins allows you pre-order, minimum of 5 lbs of meat and you just walk in and pick up. We passed the crazy line when we arrived and just felt bad for people! In fact, you pick up BEFORE they open so its like VIP stat! Also the pre-order is lottery basis, so the more flexible you are, the better it is.

My dining companion had the 7 special which had awesome grits, biscuit, eggs and bacon.   Really a perfect breakfast combo.  The iced tea is phenomenal - it has a vague honey flavor to it.  We then tried some desert.  The coconut creme pie is amazing and the salted peanut butter cookie is also great.

We enjoyed both burgers by applying more of Camden's Catsup sauce. Bottles of this and the Fries sauce by the same Oregon based business are kept on the tables. Having mentioned the fries sauce, it would also be wise to get the Truffle Fries ($2.75) too. These are truffle oiled up and are glorious with the sauce. My only gripe was that the fries were more salty than truffle-y, but the sauce helped greatly in that respect.

My number one complaint.  SMELL.  Our convention was downstairs in the conference rooms there.  Apparently it had flooded several times.  So there was a musty smell so overpowering our guests were nearly throwing up.  On top of it was a sour acidic smell.  Our room was stinky with mold, but others on the same floor were too, so that was a no go on changing rooms.  The most horrific was the gang of young men roaming the halls teaching each other how to knock on doors to break in on unsuspecting guests.  I couldn't even sleep I was so afraid!  I told them this at the check out, was offered nothing but \\"I'm sorry\\".  I won't even go into the blood stains that hadn't been wiped off of the bathroom vanity.  I called the corporate customer service line and was told a specialist would return my call.  So far, no word.   So, to be quite honest, it is unsafe if you are a single female traveling alone.

With Cameron's recommendation, I also ordered a side of hand cut fries. This meal was entirely too good. The chicken was flavorful and the waffle was very soft! One of the softest waffles I've eaten. Almost dissolves in your mouth. The fries were also extremely good. They put Old Bay seasoning on these fries that set them OFF! \\n\\nDrinks: Out of the six of us, five wanted mimosas, so we ordered a pitcher of Apple Mimosa ($45). 1) For $45, the pitcher could've been filled to the top. 2) It tasted like champagne mixed with Angry Orchard. 3) A picture successfully poured a total of six glasses, so keep that in mind when ordering based on the amount of people you have. \\n\\nOverall, this place is delicious and a great place for brunch food.

Not only are there fewer choices, but the flavor is all wrong. Sweet paneer tikka masala? Overly salted pakora? And no naan except when the proprietor brings it in a shallow pan covered in foil. Can't say how the naan tasted because I was never offered any until I had eaten what I could. My stomach is not happy with me right now, and I'm sure I will pay for it later. \\n\\nIt seems like they buy bone-in chicken and just butcher it, literally, clean through the bone. I use the word clean extremely loosely: there were bone fragments everywhere within the watery sauces. The spice ratio was completely off, they clearly enjoy liberal use of cardamom but I did not enjoy it at all. \\n\\nThere was a forgotten takeout container in the dining area, and all the silverware and paper napkins on a large table in the dining room. At noon. Not even after lunch service. \\n\\nWhen I finally had enough of the crap sandwich of a lunch, even the checkout was busted. The proprietor couldn't fully turn the square screen around completely so I could sign because the cable attached to the tablet was damaged and would cause an interface error if it moved too much.

So, time for an update!\\n\\nOver the years, I will say that a lot of things have changed at FB, and a lot of things have stayed the same.  One thing for sure that has not changed has been how busy this place is, no matter what time of the day.  I went again last night (I mean, Monday at 9PM), and the place was hopping!\\n\\nThe one nice thing is the website layout- they have the full menu plus prices- however the booze menu is not online.  They have a solid selection to wet your whistle.  There are a lot of choices here, so doing your research is recommended before you come in.  I mean, you could order 5 types of meats and take home 3, but I would say stick with 1-2 meats at a time and keep coming back- I mean it has worked for me!\\n\\nParking can suck, even 10 years later, however you can make it happen.  It can get tight right when you walk in too.  But it is OK, you WILL get solid BBQ if you are persistent.\\n\\nThe service is usually decent, however, sometimes I notice little details can be overlooked (a few occasions we have had no chairs at our table or no rolls of paper towels and had to ask).  But its OK.  \\n\\nAnother awesome thing I DO enjoy are the classics like the Tomminator are still around and taste just as good as ever.  A good friend of mine (Charlie B) told me to get a Tomminator to go, let it congeal, and pan fry it the next morning (face down) and then slice it like a loaf of cholesterol goodness, and add a little more cheese and sauce- try it, then thank him.  \\n\\nOther apps I enjoy are the brunswick stew, the wings, and the Texas fries.  I did, however try the chicken fried ribs last night, and honestly, they were not my cup of tea.  And I love their ribs, and I LOVE fried food.  They were very hearty though- the app itself could fill up somebody.  The apps are hearty, so be mindful when ordering.  I do not recommend getting 2 apps then ordering the short rib or a 4 meat combo, you're gonna take half of it home.\\n\\nThe meats, I have tried em all.  They have sandwich varieties too, but I just can't not get a meat combo.  They do have some meat combo sandwiches, but, I like getting the standalones here.  My favorites are the short rib ($39, but a lot and worth it- limited avail), the ribs, the brisket, and the sausage.  One thing about  the sausage though is that @ $4 a link, they are inconsistent in size (last night my buddy got a 6 incher and I got a flaccid piece :/).  The ribs are good enough they do not need sauce.\\n\\nThe sides are solid too, along with the stew, the collards, the mac, and the frito pie.  That frito pie packs a punch.  However, all the sides are hefty- they do not go shy here.  They do have to-go containers for the sides too.  I am telling you- my buddy who is as big as me couldn't finish all of his food last night, I call him a rookie, but yea!  He had a lot to eat- lol.\\n\\nThe desserts are OK, I do like the red velvet cheesecake.  However, if you have the meat sweats, they have plenty of dessert places around the area (like Morelli's).  \\n\\nIt took me a lot of visits, but I think I finally have this place down and what I should order to not stuff myself or to walk out with a 5 lb to go bag.  I am just really glad that even after 10+ years, the flavors are solidly consistent- and I have not had dry meat recently either (knock on wood)- even after eating @ 9pm on a Monday night.  That last sentence there is what just made me change this from 4 stars to 5.  Any BBQ fan I would recommend to check out, not to be missed.\\n\\nI mean, is this the best in Atlanta?

If you want to add crema or pico it costs more. Boy, I'm glad we added crema because even that was dry and bland. I would have been even more disappointed if I had paid $3 instead of $3.50 and my mouth be even more dry. \\n\\nThird, the salsa that came with our chips had no flavor... it tasted like tomatoes... That's it. And the chunks were gigantic and hard to eat with the chips. And the serving was so tiny that we had only a few chips before running out. \\n\\nThe only reason why I gave them 2 stars and not 1 is because their margarita was actually very good. But that's it. \\n\\nSo if you want very overpriced, super bland and dry tacos come here. Otherwise, I would much rather go to La Taq not too far away from here. You can spend the same amount of money (or less) and literally have tacos a million times better.

Definitely wish I tasted more of the bacon and smoked cheddar, but it tasted mainly just like a regular corn hushpuppy. Still good, but it doesn't compare to the Praline Bacon.\\n\\nHouse-Smoked Beef Brisket Hash ($14.50): One of the \\"Daily Specials\\" that was available on 10/7/19. Fairly decent portion size, but definitely seemed like there could've been more brisket. The potatoes were EXTREMELY crispy and crunchy, which we both loved.

We ordered the Spicy Tonkotsu, Kiwami Tonkotsu, and Gyoza.  Agreeing with some of the other reviewers, the ratio of noodles to broth is off. Too much noodles not enough broth. Although, because tonkotsu broth is inherently richer and creamier than say, a shoyu broth, adding more soup would make the portion size too large. What it really needs is less noodles and more toppings, especially since there's only two thinly sliced cuts of char siu per bowl. \\n\\nSpicy Tonkotsu - Not so spicy. I'd say it's about equivalent to a mild jalape√±o. Broth was good and not too salty. It mostly tasted like shichimi (Japanese spice blend) and very subtly like bun rieu. I think too much of the chili oil was added, which overpowered the flavor of the base broth. Noodles were cooked perfectly. Char siu was ok. Ajitama was really good. Bean sprouts were soft (I personally like them uncooked upon adding them to the bowl, to give the overall dish more texture.) I was missing my other toppings. No bamboo or wood ear mushrooms. I didn't realize it until I looked up the menu again to write this review. It's a shame though, because the bowl really needed more toppings.\\n\\nKiwami Tonkotsu - The broth had a more complex flavor than the Spicy Tonkotsu. I would've enjoyed it more if the smokey flavor was less prominent. All the toppings were present, but in small quantity. Some corn would be a good addition. \\n\\nGyoza - They were a bit small.

Whatever it is, it's delicious and keeps me coming back. The hummus is well balanced in flavor, and has a nice little well of olive oil on top for dipping. The rice is nice and fluffy, although it doesn't seem to have much seasoning on it's own it pairs very well with the meat.\\n\\nThe plate is $9.00 which is pretty reasonable.

In addition, I was willing to try new restaurant and recommend others. \\n\\nService: Was greeted at the door with a pleasant greeting and everyone was very friendly. It seem it that they need a little more assistance because there was a line at the door, tables stayed dirty after customer left and orders would take awhile to cook. Unfortunately, they did not offer any specials or no recommendations.\\n\\nFood: My order was actually very good and hot. I order the pasta and beignets for dessert. Everything is cooked to order but there is unfortunate $1.50 up charge for any substitutions to your order. It is $1 for can soda or drink refills but small plastic cups if you would like just water.  \\n\\nOverall: I recommend stopping by if you really like Cajun food but there is a lot of work that need to be done. First, I would say the way you have to order your food, I think it is little weird. They instruct you to grab a menu off the wall and then find an available table and finally come back up to the counter when you are ready to order.  This may caused some confusion when a line of people may come after you have already located a table and now you have to wait a little bit longer to order and receive your food. They have very limited seating area due the stage in the front of the restaurant. I think the restaurant is not big enough for a stage at this stage of establishment but one day it would be a great entertainment for them. They already play great music at a wonderful level so guest can speak without yelling.

It was first recommended to me from a few nursing friends I have who work for Orlando Health Downtown. This place opens early (7 am on most days), serves early, and has amazing food. I know what you are thinking, serves early? Why should I care? The amazing staff, bartender, cook, and all those that go along with this place make this a wonderful haven for those who work overnights and then get out early in the morning. This bar came highly recommended so I visited during the late night hours, starting first with just drinks. The drinks are strong, the staff attentive and the prices great. After a few times coming in for just drinks I tried the food... and wow was I impressed. The food is no frills delicious. The chicken quesadilla is huge with plenty of filling, the burgers are amazing and the wings are some of the best I have ever had in Orlando. Now not only is this bar a stop on my crawl of the Mills/50/Ivanhoe area, it is the one place I go for food and drinks, a must visit location. This place is a small gem tucked away on Virginia drive and by far my favorite bar in Orlando. \\n\\nI also feel like I need to address the recent changes to the smoking policy here, as plenty of people mentioned this in their recent reviews. I have been to this place pre and post the smoking removal. As a former smoker the smoking never really bothered me, but I do know plenty of people and friends of mine that it did. I have one friend who couldn't even go into this place due to asthma issues, and she loves their food. Smoking is still allowed in the large back area, just not inside (which isn't the largest of areas anyway) and in the front patio of around 8ish tables. The new look has really cleaned up  the place and made it more pleasant for people of all types to come in and enjoy this place at all hours of the day. I can see taking my family during the day for lunch or brunch and then also coming back later that night to enjoy music and festivities. In my book, it is a smart move. \\n\\nOverall, I love this place. The drinks re strong, the food is delicious, and the location spot on.

The one thing that my wife and I liked the most was, at the end of our meal, (being that it was our Wedding Anniversary) we were offered dessert and it was very good as well. Our whole experience from beginning to end, on a scale from 1 to 10, I give this place an 11. The reason for the extra point is because the service was so outstanding that even management kept coming around to make sure that we were being taken care of.

I can't say that I was super impressed, not to say I wouldn't come back, but it wasn't anything super fantastic IMHO. \\n\\nFor our party of 5, we waited about 20 minutes, which we totally understood having come in around lunchtime. While we waited, I went to use the restroom. There was one for women, one for men. The woman's was occupied for a while, so the server suggested I use the men's. The stench of urine was overwhelming and I used the facilities as quickly as possible. \\n\\nOur table was right near the window, our drinks were brought quickly and our order taken within a few minutes. The food took about 20 minutes to come out. Not horrible, but I do feel they were a bit understaffed for how busy they were. \\n\\nMy sister in law and I ordered one of the same dogs, (Westside, Bestside) and it had an overwhelming amount of cold shredded cheddar on top. We both ending up flicking off about 1/2 cup at least. The dog otherwise was really good (I got mine charred). I also had one that listed jalape√±os, which my assumption was that they would be pickled or grilled, etc.. nope, these were raw jalape√±os with seeds and stems. There had to be 15 pieces on my dog. I got a couple bites in and ended up picking the rest off. I like some spicy food, believe me, but there is something to be said about eating raw jalape√±os that just takes over your palette. \\n\\nThe tots were really crispy and fresh, but the ketchup looked like it had been sitting out for days with no closure or cleaning of the nozzle. Next time I would probably go for a more standard dog, and tots and call it good! \\n\\nI got a side of broccoli to integrate at least one legit vegetable, but it was completely unseasoned (no salt, butter, etc), and half of the pieces were brown.

No hummus, no tahini, no discernable garlic mayo, no magic. \\n\\nThe chicken was on the drier side and the chunks were a little too big to be comfortable eating in a wrap, I felt like every third bite was just a dry hunk of chicken and nothing else. Also, I'm kind of not a fan of having fries in the wrap. They don't have much flavor on their own, and they weren't crispy or crunchy so they just ended up being a tasteless mash and I couldn't really even tell when I was eating a bite that had fries in it. I also have mad persistent garlic breath, which I know I should expect from getting a wrap with garlic in the name, but this is another level. \\n\\nThe staff was friendly, and I'll probably give them another chance.I'm thinking I'll try the falafel wrap next time and have them load it up with hummus or tahini or something.

I'm sure the other stuff on the menu is good as well but I usually like to stick with what I like. The broth is smooth. Full of fat but not overwhelming. There's sometimes where I can't finish the broth because it does get salty but most of the I end up finishing it because it's so rich. The noodles soaks in the broth well and I find myself ordering extra noodles as I find the portion size a little too small for me. The chashu is quite tender. This ramen also comes with an ajitama. Perfectly cooked, sweet, gooey, nicely poached. And this ajitama has been consistent every time I've had it. The best part is you don't feel groggy after eating the ramen. \\n\\nThe lines get long. Expect a wait when coming for lunch. I try to get there for an early lunch to avoid the lines. It's a little difficult to come with a large group because of space. But once you order the ramen comes out fast. Like super fast. I found myself ordering, eating, and leaving all in like 20 minutes. The ambience of this place is not quite for me but I can see others liking it. It definitely has a Japanese feel fused with the Austin hipster feel.

Things I recommend here are the beef teriyaki; their creative maki rolls; hamachi Kama (seared cut of fatty fish neck); hotate Hokkaiyaki (scallops, scallions, and enoki mushrooms baked in a spicy mayo sauce); and chicken wings. For their hot pot I recommend Tom yum and Kim chi flavors for their hot pot; king oyster mushrooms; salmon head; fish tofu; their meat and surf & turf combos; and the bevy of fresh veggie options such watercress and baby spinach. If you are new to shabu-style hot pot, be prepared for an intense infusion of umami flavors. Service here is meh but I come for the food as it makes up for whatever else is lacking.

It's legitimately known for some of the best Texas BBQ in the US, as well as a line that forms in the morning and gets ridiculously long until they are Sold Out.   Franklin Barbecue was the third stop on my Central Texas barbecue tour.\\n\\nMy Overall Rating - 5 Stars (Atmosphere, Service, Food, Return)\\n\\nAtmosphere -If you heard about Franklin, you've heard about the line.  It's true, you have to get there early.  My 8:45 arrival resulted in the 12th spot in line.  At first, you're thinking it's crazy to line up this early, but 100+ like-minded BBQ crazies are their to support you.  It's great to share stories.  Once you're in, you enter a small, but charming place with communal and outdoor seating.  It needs to be experienced. 1 Star.\\n\\nService - The folks here are awesome.  Shortly after 9, someone will come out and get an estimate of your order.  They do this to determine if they'll be sold out, and estimate the time you'll eat.  If you're at risk, you can decide to stay or risk it.  Once you're in, the Franklin staff know how long you've waited, so everyone is extremely nice.  You meat is cut to order (fatty or lean, you decide!).  Samples are given to wet your appetite.  They are professionals and they add to the experience.  1 Star.\\n\\nFood -The reason people line up for Franklin Barbecue.  It's because the meat is amazing.  Everything you have heard from or read is true.  The brisket is one of the best I've had (after la barbecue), and the pork ribs our just as outstanding.  Here's more of my breakdown:\\n\\nBrisket: A+ - Fatty, moist, super tender and amazing bark\\nPork Ribs: A+ - fall off the bone, amazing flavor\\nSausage: A- - Good smoky flavor but greasy\\nPulled Pork: A - Very tender/moist - needs to be in a sandwich\\nTurkey: C - Dry but seasoned well\\n\\nI'll pass on the turkey in the future, but everything else is amazing.  I came, I saw, and Franklin Barbecue kicked my$$.  We couldn't finish it all (darn), but our left overs lasted about 2 minters before being devoured by family.  2 Stars.\\n\\nWill I Return? - YES. It's worth the wait.  Franklin Barbecue has stolen the thunder from Lockhart.  The wait in line is part of this amazing experience.  If you love BBQ, this is a MUST visit.  I am lucky enough to cross it off my bucket list.  1 Star.\\n\\nMy Yelp Rating Scale (Sum of all parts):\\n1 Star - Atmosphere - Is it a cool dive?  Perhaps an upscale place?  No matter the type, atmosphere plays a big part and I'll give a star if I like it or thinks it has great charm.\\n1 Star - Service - You can have a great meal with bad service.  But that's also what can make a five star joint drop to four.  It's important to the dining experience that service is great and on point.\\n2 Stars - Food - I'll award up to two stars for the food, since this is the main reason we dine out.  Sometimes the extra star is given for value, but it's really all about the food.\\n1 Star - Will I come back? - If I know for a fact I'll return, I'll give this a star. A place has to make an impression for me to return. \\n\\nEach Category can be given up to 1 star except food (2 stars) because I consider all these categories important to the overall dining experience.

I ended up getting their seasonal special, a spiked pink kimono lemonade.

I got the chicken terryaki, miso soup, and sea salt edamame. She also brought be gluten free sauces (tamari and siracha) for my chicken. The edamame and miso was good but unfortunately the chicken was not. It was tough and somewhat rubbery so I didn't eat much of it besides the rice. \\n\\nThe others in the party liked the appetizers (garlic edamame, lobster spring rolls, fried rice) and said the rolls were decent. The food itself was nothing spectacular and the sushi was not too high of quality. The fish was cut thick. Additionally, the udon lacked a fair share of meat and was not greatly liked. For dessert, the cheesecake bites were good but the mochi was not. \\n\\nI would like to give it 4 stars but it just doesn't seem to live up to that. Maybe 3.75 stars for me.

This place is definitely very much a Korean bar through and through and delivers in that regard well. The alcohol is definitely where Sojuba shines as the Melona soju cocktail and the Screwbar soju cocktail were both refreshing and were fairly smooth. (Plus you get a popsicle). Regarding the food, the fish roe stew wasn't particularly filling and generally only had fish roe and fish cake. Gizzards are a workout for your mouth with a tough, chewy texture that may not be for everyone. (I tried it out of curiosity). The dumplings were ok but didn't really stand out.  However, the service was on point with Tristine being a pleasure to have as my group's waitress and she accommodated our needs well throughout the night. Usually, I am indifferent about the music in a restaurant but Sojuba earns major points for blasting Kpop that I ended up shazaming and started listening to. (Training Zombie by New Champ is one of my new favorite pump up songs). They do switch to more American music here and there, but you can also request for different songs that you like (another brownie point there). Overall, if you are ready to get turnt with soju to the tune of the latest Kpop or Korean trap, this is the place in Boston to visit.  \\n\\nIG: Mood4foodeatery"},{"name":"Holy Smoke Barbecue","address":"5251 N Hamilton Rd","city":"Columbus","stars":"3","text":"I love rib tips.

So creamy, rich, smooth and flavorful! Paired with the spread of mustard, aioli, raisins and picked veggie, it was amazing!! The combination of the mousse with the bread was beyond words! Great job Cocotte!\\n3) Beet salad: aesthetically pleasing, but taste was overshadowed by the chicken liver mousse. Not bad as a stand alone salad but doesn't even compare when served at the same time as the mousse. \\n4) Fish soup: a tomato based soup cooked with various seafood and fish. It's light and refreshing with a subtle spicy kick. I really like how all the flavors came together. Excellent choice of seafood they decided to use to make the soup. Delicious!\\n5) Leg of lamb with polenta: slightly chard exterior with tender interior. Texture of the tender lamb was pretty good, the taste didn't leave much of an impact on me. Overall, the presentation was nice, but I wasn't super impressed with the lack of flavor. \\n6) Roasted chicken with brown rice and egg: When you break the poached egg and the yolk seeps onto the brown rice, the outcome is so palate pleasing! There are two pieces of chicken served, one is dark meat and one is white meat. I have a bias for white meat, so I enjoyed that piece more, but both were very tasty. White meat is hard to make moist and tender, but Cocotte nailed it!   \\n\\nService: \\nSuperb service! Very welcoming and friendly! \\nFirst star of excellence for service: We were first seated in the middle of the restaurant and when a window seat opened up, I requested to move over. At first, the waiter said that window seat was reserved, but later on, he came over and told us that he checked and it wasn't reserved until 8, since it was only 6ish, he allowed us to move over. They helped us move our food and drinks over with smiling faces. \\nSecond star of excellence for service (prob deserve 10 stars for this): We ordered the leg of lamb and they actually got our order wrong and gave us the chicken. When we pointed that out, they went ABOVE AND BEYOND to fix the problem, not only did they let us have the chicken dish, they also made us the leg of lamb AND they offered to TAKE CARE OF THE ENTIRE BILL. This is the most generous, sincere and considerate gesture any restaurant has ever offered me! \\nWe ended up insisting to pay for the bill and they still comp'ed us the chicken and the leg of lamb entree, which is again, already very generous of them since we didn't ask for any type of compensation or complain. \\nWell done Cocotte, very impressive Service!! \\n\\nAmbiance: \\nVery cute, cozy restaurant. There are these cute cut up windows spanning two sides of the restaurant, which really provides great lighting and also a great for people watching. However, I have to comment that the chairs are very uncomfortable. The backing ends at a very awkward place on your back, so I found that I had to just sit up with no back support for the whole dinner. \\n\\nPrice: \\nVery reasonable prices for the quantity and quality of food. I think our bill would have come out to be around $60 if they had let us paid, which is not bad for all the delicious food and service we received. \\n\\nOverall: \\nHonestly, food would have probably been around 4 stars but the service is really beyond the 5 star experience.

Saw the Phantons review , decided to go in today with one other person. This place indeed does not have.a menu, the owner came to the table and very briefly explaned what they had made today (2 items )but it was a struggle to understand exactly what you could orderoother than that. Got two appitizers, some shrimp speacial they claimed theyre famous for...just several shrimp smothered in cherry tomatos cooked down a bit. They have no idea how to use spice, very very bland tasting and a complete bore. Second app was stuffed mushrooms.... bleck again ! Plain simple under seasoned stuffing, with a white wine sauce. They didnt use stuffing mushrooms, they were super tiny. Ok so on to the main course. One order ravioli, one order chicken marsala.  Once again NO flavor to the marsala, chicken tasted boiled as they obviously relied on the wine to cook through the chicken. It was gross. The ravioli entree was the only thing here that was decent. I mean the ravioli itself, which they do not make in house...the order it. The gravy, (tomato sauce to some ) was a pool of water. The plate runeth over with red water. No seasoning. (Again )  Please keep in mind this was served as five raviolis.  Yes 5! Now why do I say it this way ? Ill tell you... the ravioli entree must have cost over 20.00 !! This is with NO salad or side either.  You will recieve a check that simpley says the total. Nothing written on it than the total. You see whats happening here ? By not having a menu, this leaves the door wide open to charge what they want. In NO universe would I pay 20.00 for five raviolis, not even if they were filled with lobster!! \\n\\nIt is freezing in there.

The first time I had them was on Halloween when they rebranded the fries to something else (can't remember the name). I have to say, that time I really didn't enjoy the fries and found them extremely salty, but that may have just been for the Halloween special edition. However, since then I've had the normal rosemary fries several times and found them really addicting. \\n\\n- Impossible meatball sandwich: This one really takes the cake. My friend raved to me about it, so I had to check it out. And boy did it live up to the hype! I was blown away by how eerily close it tasted to real meat. But more than that, the meatballs were absolutely delicious! I savored every bite of the sandwich and was craving more. Seriously, go treat yourself to the impossible meatballs.

Sitting down at our cafe-esque table, we immediately broke open the menu, stylized with a nod to the underground voodoo culture of New Orleans.\\n\\nFor a drink, I ordered the B&B Hurricane, which was a flavorful rum punch and came out steaming, adding to the already New Orleans, voodoo vibe. For dinner, we each decided to pick a plate of our choosing and something we all wanted to share with the table. It's essentially Southern-style tapas, so there was more than enough to go around. Here's the lowdown on what we got:\\n\\nWarm Honey-Glazed Biscuits: these things are to die for. They're warm, flaky, and the crisp, honey glaze on top made for a sweet touch to a perfect buttery biscuit.\\n\\nButtermilk Fried Chicken: everything you could want from a piece of fried chicken. They were moist and fried to perfection, full of flavor and juice. We ordered two of the three sauces (one of them was a dry rub) - sweet and spicy and white BBQ. The white BBQ was definitely my favorite, and it had such a subtle but intense heat to it.\\n\\nConfit Berkshire Pork Belly Cracklings: typically I like my pork belly grilled, but these crunchy bites were pretty damn good. Again, packed with flavor and made for a perfect dish of crispy goodness.\\n\\nCast Iron Rabbit and Dumplings: this was a good dish. It felt more like a soup with some small biscuits on top, but the savory flavor is what drove it home for me. They didn't skimp on the rabbit, either, which I was very happy about.\\n\\nAged Gouda Mac and Cheese: this was definitely my favorite dish of the night. The mac and cheese was creamy, the red hot Cheeto crust was perfection and added a nice bite to the dish, and the pork scraps were a nice surprise to the already perfect dish.\\n\\nOverall, I'll be back to Buttermilk & Bourbon many times in the future.

I ordered their lobster ramen, it was delicious.. wound of liked a few more pieces of lobster, but none the less I enjoyed every bit of thiS meal and will definitely be coming back before I leave town. I will say it's a tad on the pricey side, coming from LA where you can get ramen pretty much anywhere. One order of lobster ramen, with gluten free noodles (additional $4) and a green tea ran me $30.

You really can't mess it up unless you buy Hatfield.\\n\\nLove all the sandwiches and offerings but, damn, are they ever slow movers.  I recommend taking lunch early if you want their stuff in any kind of timely manner."},{"name":"Franklin Barbecue","address":"900 E 11th St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"Was the brisket worth standing in the humid summer heat for 4+ hours? To be honest, probably not. But it was still pretty good brisket.\\n\\nI came in with the expectation that there was going to be a huge wait. It is, after all, Franklin Barbecue. What I wasn't anticipating was the crazy long line of over a hundred people at 9am on a Wednesday. I should've just come an hour earlier, so that's my bad.\\n\\nTIPS FOR YOUR VISIT\\n\\n- Come extra early. This sounds like a complete \\"duh,\\" but seriously, just come earlier than you think you need to. You're going to end up waiting forever anyway, so might as well get there earlier so you can stay out of the sun.\\n\\n- Underneath their stairway, Franklin provides a ton of complimentary foldable chairs that you can just grab and use while you wait. At a certain point, a worker will start handing out umbrellas to protect you from the sun--wear a ton of sunscreen anyway.\\n\\n- There's complimentary water up the stairs. Stay hydrated.\\n\\nTHE FOOD\\n\\nCaveat: As someone who didn't grow up eating much American BBQ, I can't say that I have a deep appreciation for it, so take that for what it's worth. If given the option between American BBQ and Asian-style BBQ (e.g., Korean BBQ, Japanese yakiniku, etc.), I'd opt for an Asian-style BBQ 9 times out of 10.\\n\\nComplimentary Beef Sandwich: While we were waiting in line, one of the workers handed out samples of shredded beef in a piece of white bread. I'm not one to turn down anything free, so naturally, I took one. Unfortunately, it didn't make the best first impression on me, as the flavor was a little sharp and the meat was rather dry. Still a nice gesture.\\n\\nBrisket: Very flavorful bark and extremely tender, juicy, fatty interior. The BBQ sauces on the side were also very well-balanced and nuanced.\\n\\nSausage Links: The flavor profile and texture were a little surprising. I can't say that I'm a huge fan. Looking at the inside of the sausage, it's clear that there was a lot of care put into the custom mix; however, the end product just didn't impress me.\\n\\nI would have ordered more, but I unfortunately had to rush to the airport. Another \\"duh\\" protip: don't go to Franklin when you're expecting to travel around lunchtime. Be a better planner than I was.\\n\\nTHE OPERATION\\n\\nAs someone who highly values efficiency, I must say waiting at Franklin is the ultimate test of patience. The wait is frustrating not necessarily because of how long it is but because of how inefficient the process is.\\n\\nFrom the entrance of the restaurant to the ordering counter, expect to wait at least 30 minutes. How is that possible? Because there's only one person cutting and weighing the meat at the counter. ONE PERSON.\\n\\nThey could hire more than one person to work the counter (since all of the product is ready to go), but that would make too much sense. I cannot wrap my head around what they get out of being this inefficient. They sell out no matter what; why not just sell out faster so everyone can go home an hour or two earlier (and happier)? There is no respectable justification for how slow-moving the line is. They simply don't give a fuck about making you wait.\\n\\nOVERALL\\n\\nWas it an experience? Certainly. Was the experience worth it? I mean... I probably wouldn't do it again unless someone begged me. The entire thing was an ordeal, and if you're prone to hangriness, I'd say go elsewhere for your BBQ fix."},{"name":"Art Bar","address":"40 Edwin H Land Blvd","city":"Cambridge","stars":"3.5","text":"Had the art burger on recommendations from the waiter.

He suggested cooking it to medium to \\"let the fat melt\\"...I have had Wagyu before and never heard this but we ordered at his suggestions.  At $115 for a piece of meat, yes, we had what I would describe reasonable but somewhat high expectations.  It was beautifully presented and then carted off to be carved.  The waiter announced he would be wrapping the bone to go and my husband had to wave him down and say  no that he wanted to taste/see if there was marrow, etc.  He kind of gave him a snotty look.  In any case the bone had a wonderful flavor and crust, however, the steak lacked much flavor.  We did have it medium and the \\"fat\\" did not melt but we did cut out large pieces of gristly type fat.  Not what I expected form Wagyu (which I have had before).  \\n\\nThe fries were ok, the roasted carrots yummy, and the Flan out of this world.  One person had the Posole which he said was amazing and looked the same.  Another couple had filet and only ate half saying \\"meh\\".  Kangaroo Nachos were not a hit but the sliders were.\\n\\nAll in all I wanted to like this restaurant so much and will give it one more stab.

Given how early I was, I was naturally the only customer in the place. While the dining room is small, it is warm and inviting. The bar has seating for 8, for those looking for a quick bite or happy hour. The music is just right, upbeat but not over doing it and certainly not so loud that you can't talk comfortably. \\n\\nThe menu is straight forward and simple. It's an obvious nod to their focus ensuring each dish is done well. I started off with the house salad which was simple enough and fresh. The spiced hazelnuts were a nice touch. For my main, I opted for the flat iron steak- although everything sounded good and it was a struggle to make a decision. My steak was cooked perfectly and the whole dish was really flavorful and comforting. The portion size was absolutely perfect. Although I deliberately stopped myself of finishing the whole plate so I could order a dessert. The creme br√ªl√©e was the perfect ending. \\n\\nWhile I was sitting at the bar and waiting for my order. I overheard what I can only assume is the owner and head chef expressing the importance of quality and freshness to a new chef. I think that speaks for itself in terms of what you can expect at Avanti. And as the clock struck 5, people started rolling in for dinner. Clearly a best kept secret of the locals. \\n\\nThey have a perfect selection of wines and a full bar to serve your thirsty needs. I didn't get to try any of the cocktails this time around but if their attention to detail in their food is any indication, I'm sure they are worth sipping on. \\n\\nI would love to have a local place like this in my neighborhood! Seeing as how I find myself in Portland on business fairly often, I will definitely return and look forward to bringing my colleagues here.

They can also connect 5-6 tables to make an extremely long table when you have a party of 20-30, which I have experienced before. Many of my friends have chosen SOJUba as the place to host their birthday celebrations. The food is always good and shareable; my favorite selections include the corn cheese plate and don katsu; their stews/hot pot selections are good for sharing as well. Having a celebration here doesn't come cheap though, because you can order a bucket of I believe 10 soju bottles (the  baller special) for a little over a hundred dollars per bucket, and if you're with a large party, you're probably going to be ordering about 2-4 of those buckets. They also have special \\"birthday\\" shots as well that you can order. They'd announce on the mic whenever someone orders the baller special or has a birthday shot coming out. They definitely hype you up so you order more, but that adds to the fun! If you plan on coming here with a large party, make sure you call first, because they can get extremely packed on the weekends. You don't have to sit in your seats the whole time, you can wander around, you can talk to people because you're bound to bump into someone you know there.

I was to have $9 cash back on a $31 total. I received no change as she decided to put the excess leftover from the tab onto my individual bill. I understand an unclaimed amount can be left over on bad adding, this has happened before, the server always comes out to ask how the remaining balance would like to be paid. Never is one supposed to automatically deduct it from whosever card or cash they so choose. She also argued with us on the 4Square check-in special. Each individual person much check in to unlock this 1 free hh menu item special. It does not designate any limitations of 1 per table. Apparently the manager has changed this and we said \\"Fine, though for the past year it's always been per person.

Of the 20 times or so I have eaten there, the ribs were always moist, tender, with every molecule full of smoky goodness. I may have had better, but this is damn good, and it's consistent. I often don't even use any sauce because the meat is so good.\\n\\n2. No matter how crowded or crazy it is, I've always gotten polite service. This may be me comparing things to Boston, where I'm lucky if I don't get a slap in the face for taking a millisecond too long to give my order and the fact that I always know what I want by the time I get to the front of the line (those people who hem and haw after they've had 20 minutes on line should be unceremoniously booted to the back with a menu stapled to their foreheads) may have something to do with it, too.\\n\\n3. Live music. Blues, R&B, rock, miscellaneous. This is a big draw. If I want to talk, I eat outside. And I do love being able to eat outside in January. Try that in Boston and you die.\\n\\n4. Excellent sides. Collards, fried okra, brunswick stew, cornbread--I've never had a bad side here. Not always the best in every category, but ever one is very good, even the potato salad.\\n\\nParking can be difficult on a weekend, as can finding a seat.

I ordered the Jalape√±o Popper Show-Stopper with seaweed salad and sipped on a Mango Ginger margarita while I waited for the food. The margarita was a little two sweet and the ginger flavor did not come through. It was still enjoyable, but not quite what I was hoping for and definitely not worth the price tag (as expected with most things at CityWalk). The bartender who served me was very nice and service was quick. I finished my drink and was out of there with food in hand in no time at all. \\n\\nI'm not sure the burger is really worth reviewing considering it made me very ill.

At the end of my day, I headed to CityWalk's guest service desk with receipt in hand hoping to get a refund for the money I spent on the meal. The person at the desk arranged for me to speak with Nick, the Assistant Restaurant Manager. The conversation we had was rushed. I didn't feel like he really cared about my situation. He took down my information but did not offer to do anything on the spot. He said I would hear back from someone with Universal in the next few days. It's been a week now.  I paid a lot of money for the park ticket and missed half the day because I was sick at his restaurant.\\n\\nMy entire experience at Universal was a waste of money, especially in regards to the dining experience they offer.

This place is within walking distance   (.4 mile) of the convention center yet you must navigate some of those streets that have many homeless individuals. No disrespect yet their behavior while we walked could be perceived as threatening. The restaurant is located on the corner and you need to be seated as you enter.

The menu is simple and one page long. I ordered the pork ribs and Angus beef. The rub was great and had a good smoke flavor tied in the 2 meats.

I took the back route so that I wouldn't get confused by the ramp situation on Moreland, and found a spot on the street nearby.  I found the start of our group at the bar, fried pickles already ordered.  I have quite the weakness for fried pickles.  The seasoning was great, though I prefer a firmer pickle to start (that's what she said) so that they're still crispy when fried.\\n\\nMajor points to the staff for being so cool with our large and ever-growing group.  We started with \\"9\\" and more just kept coming.  The hostess and waitress never seemed to mind, and even happily split all the checks.  I LOVE the laid back places that are actually laid back, not just about food and d√©cor, but also about service.  I was getting too ambitious as I looked over the menu at all the things that I wanted to try - brisket, pork, wings, pimento cheese, mac and cheese, collards - when Tulie gave me some good advice - \\"since this is your first visit, just start with a meat.\\"  So I stuck with the brisket plate with mac 'n' cheese and collards.\\n\\nThat was some darn good brisket, particularly the end portions with all the seasoning!  The sauce was a little too runny for my taste (since I prefer the thick mopping sauces), but had great sweet and spicy flavor.  I'm going to have to agree with Todd on the mac 'n' cheese - good, not great - the sauce was just too floury for my taste.  The collards were excellent - savory spice and good texture - not mush!  There were wings for the table, and yes they were excellent wings - nice and smoky.  Can't wait to go back to try the Pimento Cheese!"},{"name":"The Mighty Cone","address":"1720 Barton Springs Rd","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"While down on S. Congress for free SXSW music, there were two things I HAD to try, Mighty Cone and Home Slice.  I don't make it that far \\"below the border\\" (i.e. the river) often, so I wanted to cram them both in (literally in my mouth). Did I mention I went for FREE music?  So, yeah I'm a little cheap and all the things said here about the Cone being a bit pricey are true.  $10+ bucks for the combo chicken and avocado cone, and a Sweet Leaf.  I will gladly pay $1.90 for a honey mint Sweet Leaf as it has saved my life many years now at ACL, and what do we pay for it there, like $4?  But $7+ for the cone?  Those ARE festival prices!\\n\\nThe cone itself was tasty and I can see how it's one of the most popular dishes at ACL.  It's somewhat portable altho you certainly have to use two hands to hold it, and it's huge and bulky and hard to get it all in your mouth (I know, \\"that's what he said\\").  So I had to pick mine apart and was a little startled to find the avocado is fried as well.  I took my first bite and thought it was really mushy chicken , which almost made my skin crawl.  I loves avocado but this seemed a bit flavorless to me and an unnatural hue of green (maybe under ripe?).  I would skip the avocado next time cause the chicken and slaw was delish anyway.  Another tip is don't take the cone outta the paper cause it gets all drippy droppy.  I was glad they had the little picanic tables with the convenient cone-holes in them so you could set it down to open your drink, wipe your mouth, talk with your hands, etc.  \\n\\nI think it was brilliant of Hudson's to open this right before SXSW, our biggest event, but I don't see any other reason to eat here except in festival mode."},{"name":"Oishi Sushi","address":"8101 NE Pkwy Dr, Ste E2","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4","text":"Best sushi in Vancouver.

The scramble was really good when you got a bite with mushrooms, tofu, and peppers and went well on top of toast. Pretty big serving too, I was only able to eat half of the scramble because I gobbled up all of my potatoes! So tasty and crispy, one of the best sides of potatoes I've had at any brunch restaurant.\\n\\nButtermilk drop biscuits with gravy - You could tell that the biscuits are homemade and they have the perfect amount of crispiness on the outside but softness on the inside. I wish the biscuit was served hot but the gravy was warm and flavorful. I really like that they have two gravies for either vegetarians and meat lovers.However, I wouldn't necessarily want this as my entire entree.

Very few places know not to overcook this kind of yellow noodles and this place knows that keeping the elastic consistency of these noodles is important. The wontons themselves were a bit too big, which most people would actually compliment on but usually wontons are made small so that the skin used to wrap the noodles end up forming a \\"tail\\" and slurping the tail is one of the highlights of eating wontons. However, I love this place too much to fault it on something so small and the wontons themselves are filled with bitefuls of shrimp so you know that size did not make the owners skimp on ingredients\\n- Beef Tendon with He Fun = My absolute favorite here and it is what I order every time, without a doubt.

She KNOWS I'm a foodie I am, so after seeing it on t.v. she sent me the link to research and I found it worthy. Lol! NOT!\\nThis is my 1st review for food on yelp. I would want the truth & I've been haunted for a week now. Ok where do I begin?\\nWalked up to a guy with a apron on a stool on his phone. Oh ok. Me: Where do I order or where are the menus? Him: This is it, as he points to the counter. Me: Ok cool. Do you have anything spicy? What do you recommended? Him: No, but I'm the chef, what would you like? Me: The burger? None at the moment, so it came down to salmon. Him: I'll make it spicy, I'll hook you up. He even told me to Google him. So I'm super excited right?! I go find a table & wait for my sis. Let's dissect the downhill experience from here. \\n- it's a bit junky with STUFF and boxes in plain site. \\n- the children's play area was sad & maybe hadn't been disinfected since it was donated. \\n- the coffee brothers randomly in the corner, were coming in and out as they painted the outside wall. Not changing gloves, making coffee, touching paint buckets, cleaning agents and plain unsanitary to me. \\n- the kitchen was a bit unorganized. They had a tray of broccoli uncovered and just sitting out along with other food and STUFF. Yum right? \\n- everyone was trying to look busy, but forgetting they were working with food, that a person like me is WATCHING and realizing this is untrained family and friends put into place to help. I assumed. \\n- the \\"fresh\\" display of vegetables and \\"farm\\" produce didn't exist \\nThe owner(?) comes in the kitchen door with groceries from Kroger or somewhere regular in his hands. Vegetables, a gigantic tube of hamburger meat and just reg store stuff. No one washes their hands, they hack into this tube of hamburger meat to make the $8 burger, I continued to watch them pull regular store stuff out to make these simple food lies to serve the innocent and naive public. \\nMy sister in law has arrived and instantly she notices and starts questioning EVERYTHING I've already peeped out.  We're like, why us? Why can't we just get it right? Thank God there are lots of GREAT quality ran black owned businesses here in ATL, but sometimes it's like my PEOPLE get it together! After all, Oprah is advertised with this place. Luckily for them, it's a trendy city and a lot of people don't know the true quality of organic and sustainable food so they'll get by for awhile sad to say. \\nSo our favorite disappointment was the actual owner(?) or face of the place, that we decided knows \\"people\\", got an inheritance or was funded by someone and had a idea to open this place or SOMETHING we just couldn't figure it out. NO customer service, no gratitude, no acknowledgment to any of us, on his phone around us, in the kitchen while scratching his beard, walking around with his hands in his pockets, inside, outside, continuously walking through the kitchen, never once washing his hands or doing rounds to check on the tables. NOTHING! He was continuously on the phone in the open and we're like isn't that a office over there? Oh ok. He was unprofessional & it answered every question or concern we had. If this is how HE operates, then the establishment follows & it all makes since now. T R A G I C!\\nOh yeah! He did interact for a sec when he removed our farm raised salmon and mine with splashed with sirachi (SPICY \\"chef\\" stuff right), Mac n cheese (it was good) and my broccoli I saved with a caterpillar on it. Yep a caterpillar! He said much of nothing and showed the Google me \\"chef\\" cooking cousin and that was it. \\nSo I said all this to say, there is nothing farm, organic, sustainable or even quality about the food or place if you ask ME. The service and general understanding of a food business does not exist. What will save them is the trend and the desire of being associated with someone who is \\"somebody\\" in a city like Atlanta. I mean if Oprah was there and it was featured on Atlanta EATS(?) Or on t.v. then it's legit right? I can't say it enough that they are in the right city where enough people will BELIEVE what they are told because eating organic, vegan, clean and quality is new or nonexistent in a lot of peoples lives and once again it's trending. I was raised sustainable in the 80's in the tree hugging N.W. so I KNOW quality and authentic food when I see and eat it. Just nope! Nope! NOPE to this place! It's a fraudulent foodie establishment that will be around a little longer than it should because of folks lack of knowledge. Period. I hope I got my point across to those that are serious about food and service. We will not be back and I try and tell all my people to save some heart ache.

We had pasta Alfredo which was custom made for us (it was not in the menu) which I appreciated their willingness to accommodate however the sauce was broken when it arrived.  \\nOverall: I won't go back - price was way to high for the quality of what we got and there was so much wrong."},{"name":"Sarku Japan","address":"2901 S Capital Of Texas Hwy","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"This is my favorite Chinese restaurant at Greenbrier mall.

We decided to try out 7 Bites as a new dining experience and were excited over the high reviews. Once we arrived, I ordered the breakfast sandwich. Well, when they brought out the sandwich, it was runny egg (which was never given in the sandwich description). With me being 8 months pregnant, I cannot eat runny egg. So I sent it back and asked for the tuna melt instead. The staff then told me that I cannot change my order, and that I had to have the same sandwich. They did not remake it, but rather, threw on some hard, cold, over-cooked egg instead. I said, \\"I cannot change my order? This is tough and cold.\\" They said, \\"sorry ma'am, you can only have this order.\\". They refused to give us our money back, or even a gift card. Instead, they boxed up the cold sandwich and tried handing it to me, as my only consolation. Then they told me, \\"I'm sorry, we couldn't have given you tuna anyway, because you are pregnant\\". Excuse me, but I'm allowed to eat tuna in moderation, as told by my doctor. I have never had a restaurant treat me this way. I was in tears throughout what was supposed to be a \\"celebratory\\" lunch with my family, and it turned out to be the worst dining experience of my life. The staff was entirely unprofessional. When I told the manager that I am making a yelp review of my experience as well as sharing this with my entire social circle, she replied, \\"that's fine\\".

This establishment would serve the latter sort...  :)  \\n\\nEncountering Fatt Matt's for the first time, a customer will likely park nearby (because most, if not all of the designated lot will be full. They will be met with the site of a rather homely and brightly painted \\"shack\\" with red painted letters in a rather unaffected fashion.  They will be alternately encouraged and discouraged by the rather long, serpentine queue sometimes extending out of the glass doors that guard the registers and service counter.   Encouraged that their choice to dine at Fatt Matt's was a choice that many others could not refuse -- discouraged because it might take a bit longer to get at the ribs.  But the line moves with deceptive speed -- quickly bringing the rear to the fore, and delivering the goods with aplomb.\\n\\nThe menu is quaint and direct showing the specialties of the Rib Shack without subtlety.  Peanuts, corn bread and other goodies await, but it's the ribs/meats that really get the customers interested.  They can either dine inside with quaint criss cross striped white table cloth, or outside in red/yellow benches -- recalling picnic tables in the rural south.\\n\\nSo what about the ribs?  I'm not an expert on ribs -- and eat them only on occasion -- that is, unless you count Kalbi...  But Southern style BBQ ribs are appealing to me, but I rarely choose to eat them.  I enjoyed the ribs...  They are certainly flavourful, drenched in a thick, sticky sweet deeply-coloured sauce, glazing both the ribs and your fingers in a tar-ry fashion.  The meat is fatty and succulent, and vanishes as quickly as it comes (you have to fault the customers for that one.)

So I asked my dad what he thought of it, and he and the other elders thought that the shrimp had gone bad! So we didn't finish those 2 dishes.\\n\\nThe cold/pickled chicken feet were pretty good - not too vinegary, and had a good texture to it.  \\n\\nThe only really good thing was the vegetarian rice rolls (jai cheung) and that's cuz it was brought out to us on a special order.  It was hot, straight from the kitchen.  Tasty with the smooth rice rolls with a good balance of cilantro.\\n\\nEverything else was pretty forgettable.  The other good thing was that at  $117 (not including tip) for 16 people, it was a pretty good bargain.

They serve all the classic diner meals and sometimes with a twist, including shakes, burgers, eggs Benedict, pancakes, French toast, many with sides of seasonal fruit and/or salad/hash browns. I personally love the BC Benny or the Frank Sinatra Benny! 110% recommend!!!"},{"name":"Shamane's Bake Shoppe","address":"2825 Wilderness Pl, Ste 800","city":"Boulder","stars":"4.5","text":"A little out of the way but a great small place for drinks , soups and sandwiches.

Thankfully, Turner Field teamed up with him to open up a venue right behind home plate on the Terrace Level.\\n\\nNo, its not a restaurant, and they have 2 options: a $15 sandwich with chips, or a double order ribeye sandwich for $28.  I went here twice, and ordered the $15 dollar one both times.\\n\\nFirst of all, I would like to mention- this place DOES accept the Season Ticket Holder discount of 33% off your meal, so thankfully, I ONLY paid $10 for the sandwich- the only reason I tried it.\\n\\nThe first time I went, my buddy and I were the only people in line, we ordered the 2 sandwiches, and there were about 6-7 employees standing around.  It took about 3-4 minutes to get our sandwiches made (OK), even though nothing had to be cooked, and our side were chips.  I took the first bite of my sandwich, and I noticed 3 things immediately: it was seasoned almost perfectly, the cuts of meat almost looked raw (not even rare), and some of the pieces were wayyy too fatty.  Hell, the chips were pretty salty too.  I liked the jus though mixed with the bun- helped it go down smoother.  I remember going to work the next day, and my stomach felt like shit.\\n\\nBut it was seasoned so well, I wanted to give it another shot.  So a few weeks later, I went back.  I stood in line (empty) for about 2-3 minutes ready to order.  The same 6-7 people were all standing around.  Thankfully a tall gentleman finally took my order.  I paid, then he disappeared.  It looked like they were making my sandwich and then 2 more people came up to order.  They got served immediately and they almost got my sandwich, until I intervened.  The lady then asked if I paid, as I was dumbfounded she completely missed the transaction of me ordering and paying in front of 6-7 people.  Thankfully I got it.  \\n\\nThis time, the sandwich was thankfully cooked a little better, with about 4-5 pieces a solid medium, but one piece that looked raw (again).   I ended up eating it, I noticed though it was seasoned just as well as the first time I had it.  \\n\\nOverall, it is a nice change to overall ballpark food, but the inconsistency of product, the warm raw meat pieces (make me nervous about safe food handling temps), and the lack of service make me pretty weary of this place.  \\n\\nOn a plus side, if the meat was cooked consistently, it's some of the better stuff out there in terms of seasoned meat.  Also a plus on the ability for a STH discount.  I still wonder if it worth going for a third time..."},{"name":"Fox Bros.

I have heard many stories about Franklin's and was fortunate enough to take in the experience myself today. I must say what you hear is true. From the extraordinary long waits to the legendary BBQ, Franklin's lives up to the hype in my opinion.\\n\\nMy friends and I had a late night on 6th Street so we did not wake up early to go wait. But on our way to the State Capitol we decided to drive by just to at least see the wait with our very own eyes. We were surprised to see that there was a relatively short line. We soon learned why. The line had been cut off at 9am because Franklin's could not guarantee food beyond a certain number of people. Crazy!\\n\\nHowever, when I got in line, the chef informed that he was doing better than expected and that we would likely be able to get some food.  You can see from my picture that \\"some food\\" was a serious understatement.  The famous sliced brisket was sold out and because food was running low, the chef said he would create a tray with a bunch of items for us to try.  I think I got enough food to last me for the rest of the week.\\n\\nAll of the meats we tasted were so tender and full of flavor.  I only wished I could've tried the sliced brisket. But given the amount of food I got, I can't really complain. The pulled pork and the sausage were probably my favorite. The turkey was also surprisingly good since that was an afterthought for me.  To finish, we tried the bourbon banana pie and omg. It was a slice of heaven. So rich and creamy. Do not skip out on the pie!\\n\\nIn all, believe the hype but prepare to wait. We sat next to groups who began waiting around 8am and they didn't eat until 2. If you have the time and can endure the wait, I highly recommend Franklin's BBQ."},{"name":"B√°nh M√¨ Tr√®s Bon","address":"1840-4720 McClelland Road","city":"Richmond","stars":"4","text":"Really really love the pho here!

The crust is thin and absolutely perfect with the balanced ratio of chew to crunch crust - so yummy.  \\n\\nI ordered all three types of mozzarella on mine (that is some cheesy goodness) on top of the white creamy sauce which I really cannot taste but I know lends some creaminess to the pizza so its not dried out.\\n\\nI also chose the sweet fennel sausage, bacon, and ham for my protein. All of  which are crumbled really small and diced really small - would have been better being a tad bit bigger crumbles but good all the same and they meat is not greasy which is I prefer.\\n\\nFor veggies I chose  grape tomatoes, jalapenos, mushrooms, kalamata olives, pineapple, and capers.  These are much bigger pieces and very fresh.  The jalapenos are spicy though, not tamed - which is fine with me.  The only thing I regret about the veggie choices is the grape tomatoes - which are halved and fairly large pieces.\\n\\nOverall, I really like this pizza and plan to visit the restaurant to try other menu items.\\n\\nPros: No extra charges for the variety and amount of toppings, crust, Ovalini and Buffalo mozzarella, capers, quality of protein and veggies, and pineapple ratio (didn't spare but not too much - perfect amount)\\n\\nCons: large veggie vs tiny protein pieces - needs more balance\\n\\nI hope Lunch Drop keeps this as an option!"},{"name":"Screen Door","address":"2337 E Burnside St","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"We came here on a recommendation from a former Oregon transplant from Hawaii while we were visiting Portland. \\n\\nWe arrived at 11am on a Saturday and were given an estimated 1 hour wait for a party of 5.

Brought to you by Toptable Group (the same company responsible for Blue Water, Araxi, and West), I made sure to bookmark it for a future visit.\\n\\nSince it's run by the same company as Blue Water Cafe (one of our favs) and it's located just a block away, we shouldn't have been surprised that Elisa reminded us so much of Blue... right down to the blue napkins.\\n\\nWe started out our meal with a couple of non-alcoholic beverages... the Yuzu Charlatan ($8) with earl grey, lavender, and sparkling water, and the Shirley Yobs ($9). They also brought us out these complimentary amuse bouche (honestly can't remember what they were).\\n\\nThe complimentary bread and butter also helped to tide us over until our food arrived. The bread was quite crusty but it was a bit too dense/chewy for my liking.\\n\\nWe decided to order the Seafood Plateau ($59) comprised of kusshi + irish point oysters, shrimp cocktail, tuna tartare, cured hamachi, and cured golden eagle coho salmon.\\n\\nThe shrimp were quite large and plump and I was quite pleased at how the cured hamachi, salmon, and tuna turned out.\\n\\nFor our mains, we went with the Wagyu Hanging Tender ($34 6oz) from Brant Lake and the Jacob's Ladder ($38) with red wine braised certified angus reserve short rib. We completed our mains with a side of Brussels Sprouts ($10) fried with brown butter and topped with parmesan.\\n\\nThe Brussels Sprouts were good but quite oily while the short rib was super tender and meaty.\\n\\nThe Wagyu hanging tender (note that this shouldn't be confused with Kobe beef) was quite tender but I was a bit distracted by the steak knives that they use here. They're quite slender and remind me of throwing knives. Unfortunately, they don't make for good steak knives as I had a lot of trouble cutting through the steak (which is odd given how tender it was). Perhaps the one I had wasn't sharpened properly but I did see another patron having the same difficulty with his knife as well.\\n\\nAfter our meal, they brought us out some complimentary petit fours but we still wound up also ordering the Sorbet Trio ($12) which consisted of banana-passion fruit, cassis, and rhubarb sorbet. Out of the three, I was surprised that I really enjoyed the rhubarb the most... it had a very light flavour and not as tart as the other two.\\n\\nOverall, a pretty good meal here and there were definitely some high points."},{"name":"Flatbread Company Brighton","address":"76 Guest St","city":"Brighton","stars":"4","text":"Very good pizza!

Balls kept rolling way after the shot and that was kind of disappointing cause my friend and I paid to play on it. The food was not bad by any means (except the cornbread which was awful and cost extra) and for a better price I would definitely return. What I was most upset by here was the drink charge. Carbonated water from the tap is always free at every restaurant I have been to, but this place charged. I specifically avoided the option of the canned carbonated water because the price which the waiter knew, yet he didn't mention a price when I asked for it from the tap.

The only thing we weren't happy about was they couldn't split our bill based on separate tabs so we ended up getting just one bill. I think you're supposed to tell them before ordering if you want separate bills, and they can only split based on the seats.

I have had screwed up pizza on more than half of my visits.  It's sad and really pathetic.  This last time and the time before they blamed it on the humidity.  Hmmmm...ever been to Chicago?  It makes Austin seem like a desert - stop with the excuses.  You simply don't know what you're doing.  Simple enough - stop trying to copy Mangia & Conan's & take a trip to Chicago & find out what this pizza is supposed to be like.  You should be ashamed to call this Gino's East pizza.\\n\\nHere's the deal - deep dish is exactly that - deep dish - the sides are high, the crust is relatively thin - and the cheese is so thick you have to be careful not to choke on it - this is what it's not supposed to be: a 3\\" deep/thick crust, with a sparse amount of toppings. It's a pitiful copy of other Austin \\"Chicago-style\\" pizza - not anything like true Gino's East pizza.  What used to be a highly anticipated treat, is just another huge disappointment.  I'm sad.\\n\\n90 minute wait for pizza (after ordering) on my last 2 visits...for not-so-great pizza.  Yup, I want to cry.\\n\\n****************\\n\\nUpdated...still 5 stars, but I have concerns.  Please don't screw this up!  I've waited a long time for REAL Chicago pizza in Austin.\\n\\nFirst visit 6/26/15:\\n\\nYay!  It's finally open and I'm here.  I'm about to write on the wall, which is tradition at Gino's East!  Yippee!  This Chicago girl has been waiting a long long time for real Chicago pizza & not the imitation garbage that's available other places in Austin.\\n\\nFor opening week, it's really well organized & efficient.  The servers were practically tripping over each other taking such good care of us.  Very well done.  Honestly, I wasn't expecting it to be this well organized or good this early on.  \\n\\nThe bar area was cool with 4 very large TVs with something different on each channel (congrats US women's soccer btw), and a nice wine & drink selection.\\n\\nThe food...what I've been waiting for...for years and years and years.  We started out with cheesy bread & a salad.  One of my friends is also from Chicago & he was as excited about this opening as I was.  Both were very good & enough food to share between the 4 of us.  We also ordered a thin crust pizza (name started with a D) which had cheese, tomato sauce, pepperoni, basil & white truffle oil.  Honestly, the pepperoni (even though this vegetarian picked it off) overpowered the truffle oil, so that was a bit disappointing.  Don't mask that piece of heaven that is truffle oil.  The pizza was excellent - don't get me wrong, just couldn't taste the truffle oil at all.\\n\\nThe one weird thing, though...  The server asked us if we wanted our thin crust pizza cut into squares or wedges.  Ummmm...ok you Texas folk - get with it.  Chicago thin crust pizza is ALWAYS cut into squares.  Seriously, don't even ask.  My friend and I both kind of laughed about that.\\n\\nI'm looking forward to my return visit where I will order my old standby - deep dish cheese pizza and you can cut that into wedges.  My Chicago friend is excited to come back, too.  We are so glad Gino's East is finally in Austin!  Woohoo!!!\\n\\nThis pizza snob was very pleased!!!\\n\\nSecond Visit 7/17/15:\\n\\nSo...we returned 3 weeks after our first visit to give them some time to normalize & try the full menu.  My Chicago friend was eager to try the Italian sausage & I was excited to try my usual deep dish cheese pizza.  Let me start out by saying it tasted wonderful and I won't reduce my 5 stars because it's still the best pizza in Austin and the sweet sauce was perfection.  However, comparing the overall pizza to the real deal at Chicago Gino's East, this was a fail.  When they brought out our 3 pizzas, we were like WTF?  That's not Gino's crust!  There was at least 2\\" circle of puffy crust coming into the middle of the pie.  TOTALLY WRONG!!!  It's supposed to look like a sea of red sauce with a tiny bit of edge crust showing.  This was not.  All three pizzas looked the same, so they screwed all of them up.  Maybe a new cook?  I don't know.  We were sad.\\n\\nWe pointed this out to the manager at the end of our meal & he agreed that it was wrong.  I was very disappointed but will still go back.  However, I will talk to the manager beforehand (as HE suggested) because now I'm not so sure they really know what they are doing.  There seemed to be less cheese than in Chicago as well.  Normally, you practically choke on that cheese.  It was still very very good, just not up to true Gino's East standards and that was a big fat bummer, especially for the price."},{"name":"Fox Bros.

I know there are several seating areas outside the \\"Patio\\" but arent sure if there are any other patrons at that lunch hour.  I was wondering how come at that hour, there are NOT many other patrons for Lunch.  Is this a good sign or a bad sign?\\n\\nWe were given the menu.  The menu is \\"lengthy\\" hence there are plenty to choose for Everyone's Palate.  The prices at Hana Japanese Bistro are breakdown into these :\\n\\n*  Appetizers & Side Dishes ($3.50-$10.00)\\n*  Chef's Special Rolls ($6.80-$12.50)\\n*  Chef's Suggestion ($5.20-$16.00)\\n*  Asian Classics ($4.00-$7.00)\\n*  Curry Noodle Soup ($9.00-$10.00)\\n*  Main Entrees ($12.50-$15.00) to name a few.....\\n\\nWhile we go thru our menu, the server provide us Miso Soup and Pickle Vegetable aka Salad of some kind.

Perhaps with the dust of Togarashi on the Salad???\\n\\nA.W opt for Oyako Don ($8.50).\\n\\nWhile I opt for these items :\\n\\n*  Baked Mussel ($6.00)\\n*  Fried Calamari ($8.50)\\n*  Oyster Fry ($5.00)\\n*  Wasabi Tobiko Spicy Nigiri ($4.30)\\n*  Sweet Shrimp aka AmaEbi ($6.30)\\n*  Sea Urchin Nigiri ($9.50)\\n*  Eel (Unagi) Nigiri (4.50)\\n\\nBoth A.W and I shared the Roti Canai ($4.00)\\n\\nAs for Desserts we opt for Green Tea Ice Cream ($3.50) and Mochi Ice Cream ($3.95).\\n\\nThe service was prompt, inviting and efficient. \\n\\nHana Japanese Bistro, you have 3 stars in my books because :\\n\\n*  Most of the sushi/nigiri items I order was  A-OKAY, nothing stellar nothing fancy.  The Nigiri are slightly of small portion, aka the proportion of seafood compared to the rice portion NOT balance.  At least all the nigiri tasted fresh, NOT fishy at all.  Comes on my Sushi/Nigiri Plate, the pickled vegetables.  Was it beets of some kind??\\n\\n*  My order of Baked Mussels was \\"over-flavored\\" with the \\"Dark Sweet Sauce\\" hence making this item overly too sweet for my taste bud.  Please refrain from doing so.... *Sad Face*\\n\\n*  The Fried Calamari, though tender, the batter is too soft aka undercooked in certain areas.  Perhaps before the \\"batter cooks\\", hence when arrived at our table, the \\"battered\\" - Fried Calamari looks so pale.  I am still curious about the \\"dipping sauce\\" that comes with the Fried Calamari.  Hmm.....\\n\\n*  The Oyster Fry is A-OKAY.  Not too fishy.  Battered was done right.\\n\\n*  From A.W feedback, she was slightly disappointed with her order of Oyako Don.  Coz for one, the chicken was tough.  The rice was over-cooked.  The rice portion is more than the portion of chicken and the egg.  It was not \\"creamy\\" like what she prefers her Oyako Don to be.  *Sad Face*\\n\\nMy highlight meal was from the Roti Canai.  YES, finally an establishment, aka The Owner / The Kitchen crew who can make the ROTI CANAI, right.  The kind of Roti Canai cook in Singapore or Malaysia, with the correct consistency, flavor and portion.  To add the YUMMYNESS of this Roti Canai, Hana Japanese Bistro offer the Curry.  The kind of Curry I grew up with and even with REAL Curry Leaves in the Curry itself.  Stellar Curry to boot, Yo!  I so wish I could have more of this Roti Canai and the Curry.  Feel like \\"licking the bowl\\" during that lunch hour but I did not!  \\n\\nA.W like her order of Green Tea Ice Cream though I feel the Mochi Ice Cream was a let down.  *Sad Face*  \\n\\nTherefore, Hana Japanese Bistro, you still have plenty of room for improvement in my books.  \\n\\nI dont mind returning with Hubs when schedule permitting and perhaps see how it may differ and who knows, can get the chance to talk to Eric Chong, the owner of Hana Japanese Bistro. \\n\\n@126/2012"},{"name":"Super Fusion Cuisine","address":"54 Mt Auburn St","city":"Watertown","stars":"4.5","text":"I am forgetting how to use a fork and knife as we speak...

One was made of rice and the other was kani (imitation crab). I could definitely taste these two items, although they were a bit greasy to handle with my hands. There was a nice spicy kick to it from the jalapenos and spicy sauce. The vegetables provided a nice crunchy contrast to the softer tuna and buns. The veggies also provided a nice refreshing flavor to the sandwich. I did wish the fish (tuna) had a presence flavor in the sandwich. The tuna flavor fell in the background. Overall, still a good and interesting sandwich. The fries were delicious and well seasoned.\\n\\nThe \\"cowfish has left the building\\" burger is rich and tasty with its peanut butter, fried bananas, and bacon! I did wish there was some type of crunch or refreshing component to it though; maybe something like crunchy peanut butter (with peanut pieces) or maybe some lettuce.\\n\\nThe parmesan bacon truffle fries were delicious!! The cheese did get hard and chewier as it cooled down though, so eat these fast when they're fresh and hot; however, the taste was definitely there.

I liked the S'more shake a bit more as it tasted better and was more unique.  They had an issue with their ice cream maker and the person making them kept making mistakes. We eventually got the milkshakes about 30 minutes after ordering them. Our bartender got the floor manager and she was able to comp the parmesan bacon cheese fries for the long wait on the shakes.

And we walk into a pretty empty restaurant with 3 female workers in front of us talking to each other. This is where we should've left because it took the workers about a minute to decide they should stop talking and actually acknowledge us. Very unprofessional. Within seconds of any customer service driven business, you should be greeting your customers once they step foot into your establishment. This was not the case at RA Sushi but we let this go and asked for a table for four.\\n\\nWe were sat at a booth with our menus and it took our server, Melody quite awhile to greet us. When she did, she asked us if we wanted anything to drink - we all replied with water. Her response: Just waters? Another red flag. As a server, you don't give your customers an attitude and question their choice in beverages. It's part of the 101 basics in waitressing. Melody comes back with our waters and asks if we were ready to order. No speech given about tonight's specials, her recommendations, or her asking if we had any questions. We told her we weren't ready so she left and we sat waiting for her to come back for a good 10 mins. We even put our menus at the edge of the table to show we were ready to order. \\n\\nWe finally ordered our food and my friend is a Vegetarian so she asked if the spring rolls were filled with just veggies. Melody told her yes so my friend ordered them. Make note of this because it comes up again at the end of our meal. \\n\\nOur dishes came and for the most part, the actual raw sushi was very mediocre and tasted a little old. Big red flag for a sushi restaurant. But we ate it anyways because we were hungry. I ordered the steak entree and requested the steak to be cooked at a medium-rare but when it came out, the steak looked more like it was seared and the inside was still very rare. I really didn't want to complain because nothing good ever comes to when you return your food to a kitchen so I had my boyfriend eat majority of it but even he didn't feel good about eating it because it was still so rare. \\n\\nCome to the end of our meal and we're waiting for Melody to come around again. She finally does come around and my friend asks for a takeout container for her spring rolls. And Melody loudly says: You didn't even touch them! Um, I thought to myself - did she really say that? So quickly in defense of my friend, I said that she's not feeling well. Melody walks away and comes back with her container. We pay for our check and as we are leaving, we  notice that there are no \\"thanks for coming\\" or \\"have a good night\\" from any of the workers. Mind you the restaurant isn't slammed with customers at this point in the night. And had we known our meal would pan out the way that it did, we would have never stepped foot into the restaurant to begin with and by you reading this, I really hope you don't either. Save yourself the trouble and go elsewhere. Trust me, you will be glad that you did."},{"name":"No Mas!

The host was really, really on his game.  He told us it could be one hour to a bit over an hour, but to check back with him in 45 minutes.  We went up the street and had a drink, then arrived back at Screen Door in exactly 45 minutes.  He had just called our names and was ready to seat us. \\nWe were seated on the patio, which was cozy enough with heaters.  I just had to try the mint julep, an old favorite.  It was expertly mixed, with a great flavor, though I felt it could have been just a smidge sweeter.  If you've never had one, it's like a sweet, minty bourbon.  \\nI'm from the South, so I had great expectations for the food.  I decided to try the buttermilk fried chicken with mashed potatoes and collard greens.  The fried chicken was excellent, really crispy and tender, and the mashed potatoes were delicious.  The greens were also very good.  My partner had the barbecued brisket with beans and fried onions.  I tasted it all and it was all really flavorful and great.  \\nFor dessert, I had the lemon chess pie.  It was pretty good, but a bit on the overly intense side.  The pie was very, very lemony and tart, which I do like, but also very, very sweet, which I don't like.  They definitely could have used less sugar.  Nonetheless, it was tasty and had an excellent, flaky crust. \\nService was friendly and efficient, but a bit slow here and there.

On that, I took the chance and was not disappointed in the results. The sauce is just SO good. It has a rich, sweet, and flavorful tomato taste that isn't aggressive AND pairs perfectly with the wide range of cheeses they use on their pie. \\n\\nI had the classic Margherita, the Diavola, the VPN, and the special Pepperoni pizza (it was a group order). And they were all amazing. The bottom crust is relatively thin, but supportive. The outer crust is thicker and in my opinion a little chewy, and perhaps could benefit from garlic butter or a sprinkling of romano/pecorino (simply because my personal approach to pizza crust is to essentially NOT eat it, since it's just bread at that point), but I think DeSano's strong point is sticking to a very straightforward \\"THIS IS PIZZA\\" style, which I can appreciate. \\n\\nThe various pizzas I tried all had their own thing going; one was just a classic pizza, while the others played around with pepperoni. One had two types of pepperoni, while the other had sausage, and another had spicy red peppers (peppadew). Gotta say, the one with the peppadews was freakin' fantastic. The peppers were tiny, but biting into one with the rest of the slice just makes the experience so flavorful. I loved it. \\n\\nIt's tough as a customer reviewing food to balance between \\"what I want it to taste like\\" vs \\"what it does taste like (and is it doing it well?)\\". I really love the straightforward and totally spear-like focus of the pizzas, but I would love some flavor variation on the crust; but that's the thing! My own personal tastes enjoy a flavored crust, but DeSano does their pizza so well, the crust doesn't really need to be embellished at all. The pizza is at the core of the pizza (like it should be).

The mash potatoes are good and the saw mill gravy was tasty.\\n\\nNow the biscuits were very light and flaky, like my old cousin used to make and the cornbread is traditional southern cornbread, which is not too cakey like. \\n\\nThe only thing they are missing are yams.

I hope you guys have great success!\\n\\nHowever, my experience here was not so great. Walking in I noted that the extremely small dining room was being monopolized by what I thought was a staff meeting with a man who talked extremely loud. \\n\\nThis made for a weird \\"I shouldn't be here\\" feeling that almost made me not eat in, but I decided to go ahead and dine in.\\n\\nI ordered the Eden Burger and fries. There was no ice for drinks. Being hot outside I was a little disappointed to be met with room temp tap water.\\n\\nI was excited to try the burger but I found the bun to overpower the flavor of the burger. The burger itself crumbled as I ate it and I ended up having to get a fork to eat it because it fell apart and out of the bun. I think a change needs to be made. I feel like with a burger the flavor of the meat/insides should be more prominent than the bread.\\n\\nNow back to my dining room experience. While sitting there I was forced to listen to a guy who was apparently a former manager at chipotle for 3 years. He talked very loudly asking about food storage temps, food cooling procedures and if they would add a drive thru among a lot of other things. I could literally tell you every detail of this chipotle guy's resume at this point. I also heard the word chipotle about 4 million times during my lunch.\\n\\nSo I decided this must not be a staff meeting, this chipotle guy was on a job interview maybe? Either way... the whole experience made me feel like I walked into a company break room and crashed their lunch break uninvited.\\n\\nWhile all this was going on a delivery person came hauling a large amount of boxes through the tiny dining room and past my table twice.\\n\\nMy advice to you as a company is to hold your meetings/interviews off site or at least not in the dining room.

Right now, it is the second most reviewed BBQ place on Yelp in Atlanta (behind FBros), and is currently in round 2 in a BBQ competition via Atlanta Magazine facing off the place (I would pick FB any day) over it.  I used to come here before my Yelping days, and I didn't get it then.  I stopped coming, but then last night, I wanted to see the hype, or if it changed...\\n\\nUnfortunately, for me, it has not (except, maybe the prices rose a little bit).  Which absolutely breaks my heart, because the craft of true BBQ is not steam injecting or boiling meat, it is the craft of low and slow over (your choice) of wood.  But hey, who am I to judge, I haven't been smoking meats or anything the latter half (mind you I am no spring chicken either) of my life...\\n\\nI will focus first on the positives.  I would like to point out at that this place is open until 12:30AM (11:30PM Su-Th) on the weekends, where not many BBQ places can say that (again, if you injecting your ribs with steam you can stay open later because it is easier to make).  Also, the people I dealt with were very nice that worked there.  So, the service is a plus.  \\n\\nThey usually have a band playing, so keep that in mind.  They have outdoor seating if you don't feel like bursting your eardrums.  Ordering is simple- do you want a 1/2 or full rack of steam ribs, or chicken or pork.  Last night, I got the half rack and a Sweetwater Blue.  The total came up up, then I realized they don't have a tip thing on the receipt.  But a cash tip jar right there.  I didn't have cash on me, and I didn't read reviews before hand (came on a whim)- so I do need to go back and throw them some tip (karma).\\n\\nFood came quickly, and when I saw the ribs, I remembered why I had not been back in so many years.  The actual sparerib quality were OK, but slathered in sauce.  A few bites, had this interesting sweet (I wanna say brown sugar like) crunch to them, but that was about it.  The sauce was a little tangy.  In terms of fall off the bone, I actually had to use some effort on a few bones.  For steam, I would have expected the opposite.\\n\\nMy actual favorite part of the meal was dunking my white bread in the little container of sauce on the side.  Is that bad?  And is it bad that I felt bad and I almost offered my friend who just landed from out of town Woody's?  Is it also bad, I would rather go to McDonald's and get a McRib?!?! I mean, the atmosphere is cool, the service is friendly, the food comes quick, but honestly, I just don't get the hype.  #nothanks\\n\\nOh yea, and what is going to happen to the Chicken Shack/catering building?

New to us that is since Chuck's Wagon has been in business for a while now. So it seemed time that we gave it a try. Having just eaten at a similar diner establishment only yesterday I have to give the edge to Chuck's Wagon. The food here is a cut above.\\n\\nOur server was attentive and friendly and kept the coffee flowing. Whereas yesterday Marty's crisp bacon request fell far short - here it was on the money.  Yesterday his french toast was serviceable, here the pancakes were a light and fluffy surprise. Our eggs were cooked exactly to order (and we had opposite ends of the spectrum one wanting over hard and one over easy).  The homemade biscuit was also light and fluffy and quite tasty. The chicken fried steak - a test where diners are concerned with me, was well seasoned, crispy but not greasy with a flavorful sausage gravy to boot. And the grits were well cooked though I did need to add a good amount of salt to suit my taste.\\n\\nOverall, our food was really well prepared. The restaurant itself definitely gives off a local dive vibe. There are no secrets as all the working spaces from the grill to the dish washing area are open and visible to the customers so you are privy to the business end of things (aka organized clutter).

I rarely ever am willing to give up a 5-star rating but this place definitely deserves every ounce of credit.  I've been here twice in the past three days just to make sure I wasn't crazy.\\n\\nThis place is hidden in between a used car lot and a latino strip club, talk about ambiance!\\n\\nWe rolled up here on an extremely cold day.  My friend and I were absolutely starving so we let our stomachs do the thinking.  We watched as the dude working pulled out a JUICY, DRIPPING slab of BRISKET.  He sliced off the very tip and my friend and I just about died.  It was such a tiny piece of meat but packed so much FLAVOR.  I am literally salivating, as I reminisce about this first bite.   \\n\\nWe both ordered 2 meat plates, myself with brisket/ribs and my friend got sausage/brisket.  The plates came with a refreshing purple cabbage cole slaw (not the mayo creamy stuff people are used to) and a standard mustard potato salad, nothing to go wild over.  The meat on the other hand was just DIVINE.  The brisket was absolutely moist, but not over cooked.  It came with a side of \\"espresso bbq\\" sauce, a tangy, not too sweet concotion that this lil joint has created.  It just boggles my mind when I dip my brisket in it.  The ribs were perfect also, just tender enough to come off the bone, but not over cooked where all the meat is pulled off when you bite into it.  THATS GOOD BBQ!  The ribs had a nice peppery flavor to it.\\n\\nMy second stop we came around 2PM, but unfortunately EVERYTHING was sold out except the pulled pork.  My new friend who I brought this time were really sad, however the owner decided to give us all of his leftover pulled pork ( about 3/4-1lb of pork) and a couple of sides for half price.  Now thats what I'm talking about! \\n\\nSome southern hospitality!  That's why I absolutely love local business, not only are they working hard to provide you the best product, they take care of their customers.  I am not gonna claim that this is the best BBQ in the world but forget the rest of the places within Austin's city limits and forget Rudy's.\\n\\nThere are a bunch of gnomes and picnic benches so you can enjoy the sun while you eat.

Both the inside and patio are really ambient. It was relaxing, classy, and fun. \\n\\nBeing a new restaurant, I think everyone is still getting their footing as many staff members looked frazzled. While they absolutely got the job done, something was a little off still. For example, our server was knowledgeable and polite, but was a little slow to the effect that I was worried about his efficacy. However, he ended up pulling through at all the clutch moments. \\n\\nWe were seated immediately on the patio on Sunday at 8. I was pleasantly surprised as it was so beautiful out. The playing kids in the fountains were a happy amusement for us. \\n\\nThe menu was well put together. Lots of yummy choices. I'd have like to see more salads, but whatever. They were out of just two things while we were there, but nothing I cared about and I can't blame them. It was late Sunday night. We ordered the two sammies recommended by our waiter. I got the turkey pastrami Ruben. B got the bratwurst burger. Both were good, the brat burger the better of the two. Fries tried to be special, but were just fries in the end. I tasted no vinegar on the 'salt&vinegar' fries. The brat burger was helped immensely by the pretzel bun and pepper mayo combined with stadium mustard. Yum! The patty had great flavor too and advertised as House made. Recommended! The Ruben was good. A very competent rendition, but not really special and was very salty. There are many Rubens I'd prefer to this one, but I enjoyed this one despite those facts.\\n\\nOverall, we had a good time and I think we'll return, but mostly for the ambiance. The food was good, but not cravable, but I was enticed to try other menu items. They had a very reasonable price point.

Make sure to bring beers to pass the time and when you finally get your tray of meat, it will look like the most spectacular feast you've ever laid your eyes on. The experience is awesome, but I can't see waiting for that long whenever I'm craving some BBQ (which is often). \\n\\nAs for the food itself, every thing was delicious, but was it the best BBQ I've ever had? The sausage was the highlight of the meal--utterly spectacular. The brisket was very very good, but I liked J Mueller's heavily crusted and peppered brisket better. The turkey was super juicy thanks to a final dip through the au jus and was awesome. Sadly, I was a little underwhelmed by the pork ribs and pulled pork; both were good but not great. Sides of potato salad and coleslaw were solid. I also appreciated the three choices of sauce: brown sugar, vinegar, and pepper. \\n\\nWith John Mueller receding back to his mysterious and troubled ways, Franklin is the best BBQ in Austin for sure."},{"name":"Tapestry","address":"69 Kilmarnock St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"Beautiful, big space with interesting menu.

There was a lot of options to choose from, but the menu wasn't overwhelming. I tried two drinks that I really enjoyed. The food has good portion size, it was enough for each person (there were four of us) to try each New Orleans inspired dish. We thought the deviled egg toast was bomb.com. The small portion size also helped me save room for dessert -  the beignets were worth saving room for. \\n\\nThere also was a raw bar and a groovy side bar for those just passing through for drinks. I'm giving this four stars because, while kind and inviting, the service was a little slow. Sometimes the drinks would come out after our food, but it was opening week and the place was very busy.

It was great! While waiting for our food, an employee came in. The employee was male, Caucasian, with longer brown hair. He walked to the middle of the room (in between the back room and the kitchen). He had his phone out and my husband and I could tell he was on Snapchat. At first, I thought he was taking pictures of the kitchen staff. I then realized he was taking photographs of my husband and I while we were waiting for our food. He kept making motions and behaviors that are very consistent with people attempting to conceal that they are taking photographs, with the phone pointed in only our direction. Once finished, he would turn around and the Snapchat app could be seen on his phone. This happened multiple times. I was in complete shock! I made my husband aware of the situation and he saw what the employee was doing as well. I don't want to discredit any of the other employees who were working there today, our food was wonderful and every one who helped us was fantastic, especially the gentleman who helped us initially. However, the actions of the male that appeared to be recording or taking pictures of my husband and/or I made our visit extremely uncomfortable, and I would be hard-pressed to return to a location if an employee who we caught trying to sneak photographs of customers was present."},{"name":"Yebo Beach Haus","address":"56 E Andrews Dr Nw","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"What can I say?

We were able to sample the fish tacos, caesar salad, and crab dip before we ordered our main course. Everything was good! I especially loved the crab dip, very creamy with lots of crab and flavor. For my entree, I ordered the red snapper. It was good as well but not my favorite. This is a great restaurant for private parties, date nights, or even if you want to grab a few drinks. I would definitely go back just to experience it in the winter time! \\n\\nThe menu is limited for large plates but there is a bigger variety of small plates to try.

The place is massive, with an upstairs and downstairs, and it's always packed on the weekend, although getting a table relatively quickly is usually not a problem. The service isn't always polite or attentive (not unusual for an authentic Chinese place), but the key is to be aggressive - flag down waiters if you need something or chase after a cart if you see something you want but they've gone past you. Because it's so big there's always a lot of carts out, and I feel that the turnover of food is quick, which is good. There's also a lot of variety in their dim sum items, and the meals can be very filling while remaining just over $10 per person.

We cannot help but turn our heads to and fro because of their interior decoration. Pretty cultural! I loved it.\\n\\nMy choice of Chinese food is simple. House fried rice, beef with broccoli, chow fan (or fun?), tea and sharks fin soup. We ended up getting the Hunan fried rice - it was good enough by itself! Very tasty and very Chinese (meaning MSG-laden. Hehe. I love it.). I also ordered a cocktail that is pretty similar to a Mai Tai - I just forgot what they called it. Something like Maui something.

Will rank my dishes from the most amazing to just amazing. If you are a fan of Russell House Tavern (which I am), come here. If you aren't, come here anyway. \\n\\n(Note: the dishes are on the small side -- they recommended 18 dishes for the 8 of us, but we ended up ordering 16 and it was more than enough. The menu is arranged left to right from lightest to the heaviest.)\\n\\n1- Do not forget to order their vegetables. To have my tastebuds blown with a kale salad is pretty impressive. The kale and pistachio-buttermilk vinaigrette and broccoli with butternut squash puree were phenomenal. They were the perfect combination of juicy, sweet, sour, salty, crunchy, and soft. Don't poo poo them just because they're veggie dishes. These two dishes seriously made my meal.\\n\\n2- Berkshire pork belly - a heart-attack worthy amount of fat (in a good way -- isn't that what pork belly should be?) with savory grits. My favorite part was the strawberries paired with the grits. STRAWBERRIES. \\n\\n3- Corn pancakes - hot, crunchy and buttery. A little bit of breakfast didn't hurt anybody.\\n\\n4- Sweet corn gnocchi - FAT pieces of gnocchi, with fresh zucchini. The gnocchi isn't your average chewy gummy gnocchi -- they were crunchy on the outside and firm on the inside.\\n\\n5- Chicken fried rabbit -- who knew rabbit could be so juicy?\\n\\n6- We finished off with the clams and the carbonara, which were both delicious and meaty, but both were a little bit salty.

Everything was fresh out of the kitchen, and had spent no time under a lamp. \\n\\nThis is good in and of itself, however, while freshness lays a solid foundation, the flavors and textures are what really makes the meal. Fresh, bland goop is still not very appetizing.\\n\\nI had:\\n\\n- Chips and Salsa (of course)\\n- Pastelitos\\n- Taco and Enchilada (with Jambalaya)\\n\\nChips and salsa were pretty great. I loved the freshness of the chips (from the bar I saw them being constantly made). Salt level was on point too. The salsa was pleasant, with just the right amount of chunkiness. However, I would have liked to see just a little more cilantro and spiciness, as it was quite mild.\\n\\nPastelitos... remember what I said about freshness? These things were so fresh, they were impossible to pick up by hand! The chicken cilantro mix was solid, as was the sauce. My first critique is that I would have liked the dough to be a little thinner and flakier (as they claim). My second critique is that I would have liked a little more spices in the filling.\\n\\nTaco and enchilada (and jambalaya) were very subpar. The taco was filled with shredded chicken stewed in some nondescript red sauce. Not only was flavor lacking, so was texture.  \\n\\nNot only was it close to goop, but it lacked anything else: no onions, no herbs, no cheese, nothing. A tortilla and red chicken goop.\\n\\nWith the enchilada, it is almost a case of deja vu. It was smothered in some kind of cheese and bland sauce. On the inside was pulled beef. This one didn't even have a proper sauce! It was overly moist, as if it had been pulled out of lightly salted water. If the beef itself had some distinct flavor, that might offer some redemption... but no. Goop.\\n\\nJambalaya was decent, however while this one actually had some spice, I found it a little too wet and salty for my taste.\\n\\nFinally, there is a bit of pico de gallo that comes with this. I am happy that they included a fresh element to this dish, but it too was far from perfect. A little more herbs, spice (and maybe some lime juice) would have done a world of good. \\n\\nThe service was solid, no complaints, but they didn't blow me away. The location was clean.\\n\\nPrices were reasonable by themselves, but I would have rather paid twice as much for a meal that would put a smile on my face.\\n\\nAlso, be advised, containers for leftovers are rather small, and they do not offer bags (not even for 10 cents or what not)"},{"name":"Serafina Downtown","address":"10 High St","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"I think this is a great place to go if you're going to the theater, it's in a good location and they gave us a free tiramisu if you show them your theater ticket.

It looked so good but both of our dishes was over priced for no reason. My bowl was filled with majority rice and beans. The rice was suppose to be cilantro lime but I saw no green or taste any lime on our rice. \\n\\nMy friends quesadilla truffle was so greasy it was dripping grease. It had no flavor even with what they served it with. \\n\\nThe worst part... we ordered their dessert custard... after 15 minutes we flagged down our server to ask her to just put it Togo because we're trying to catch a show. Another five minutes later, she brings it in the Togo box and we paid. As we're leaving, we opened our box to find it burnt. It probably would've been good but I can't believe they would even serve that like this. \\n\\nOverall, way way over priced and the food honestly was terrible. :( I wish it had more flavors and worth the price tag but I wouldn't go back."},{"name":"Sforno Trattoria Romana","address":"1308 Pearl St","city":"Boulder","stars":"4","text":"Loved this place.

You even get a $30/bottle discount for any full bottles you buy to go!\\n\\nFirstly, a shout out to Division Wine Making Co and their Gamine project, which is sourcing both Syrah and Grenache from Applegate Valley AVA (west of Medford, and far south from the more well known Willamette Valley). The wines are spectacular and extremely affordable - the Syrah is out of this world.\\n\\nNext, I just want to mention that the staff were super friendly and helpful, which is somewhat contrary to some of the other reviews. They were really knowledgeable about the wines as well. I inquired about purchasing some of the Gamine Syrah, which wasn't on the wine list but was available for sale on the website and one of the staff tried reaching out to the Assistant Winemaker to ask if it was possible to have some bottles brought to the restaurant. Ultimately, we couldn't make it happen, but it certainly wasn't for lack of trying and I really appreciate that she took the time to inquire about this on my behalf!\\n\\nFinally, this is a great place to try out small batch, local producers (the half glass option is a great way to sample a lot on a budget, and without getting totally hammered).

Placed a take-out order consisting of swordfish, a meatball sub, and frutti di mare with pasta. Is there anything worse than getting all the way home and your food sucks or something is wrong. So my swordfish was over cooked to the point of being inedible. I venture back into the cold and return my dinner only to have the cook tell the hostess that this is the way swordfish is supposed to be and maybe I should change the sauce. What does that even mean???...and it really hit a nerve that he didn't just apologize and replace it. I mean, on the strength of him saying this is how the swordfish is supposed to be, is enough to realize this place is ridiculous...but it gets worse. \\n\\nAs I got no apology from the hostess, I proceeded to tell her to just give me a risotto figuring it may be quick even though they already screwed up my nice relaxing dinner with a lady friend. I waited 15 minutes for my food ( the hostess just handed it to me without saying anything) then went home. I get home and open the risotto and it's soupy af. Don't know in what region in Italy this may be the style, but perhaps it's the Central American or Brazilian way since all the cooks and staff are from these regions. That's cool, but you're billed as an authentic Italian restaurant so.... So then I opened my meatball sub which I asked for with no provolone and add grated Parmesan. Naturally, it had provolone and no Parmesan. I brought this back and asked for a mgr. A woman who was waiting on tables comes over to help me. I told her about both situations and the cooks lack of accountability and she apologized and had them make another sub. I also see the cooks with a smug look in their faces talking to the hostess and I could totally tell they were talking about me. While I was waiting I asked the hostess if the head chef was there and she said no. So this raised my concern about how nobody is held accountable as there is no management in the building ON A FRIDAY NIGHT. No head chef and a lead server running the front of the house. How much does ownership care? So the icing on the cake...you won't believe this. I watch one of the cooks drop a stack of to-go tins on the floor and from the feeling I already got from this place, my sixth sense told me to watch him. To see if he picks them up and puts them back on the shelf. I got my food and left but watched through the window and sure enough! These disgusting  oil picked the tins up and placed them back on the shelf! I raced back into the restaurant bc now I'm pissed at the lack of consideration for their customers and ask for this lead server again. I told her what I just witnessed and she apologizes to me like a broken record and goes to talk to the cook. I proceeded to tell her that  about to Yelp the shit out of this place and left. I kind of wanted to contact the board of health also! Lastly, I returned back home and the meatball sub was dry and had barely any sauce. Do not go here. Since the owners don't care and nobody is accountable, it's up to us to hold them accountable!

All I know is that we had a terrible experience regardless.\\nCame Friday night with my friend around 11pm. It's a pretty big restaurant with a more casual seating area, fancier seating area with tablecloths, etc, bar, and sofa/lounge area. Host told us we could sit anywhere, so we sat by the window in the casual seating area. We came intending to get some drinks, not food, so we only looked at the drinks menu. After closing our menu and deciding what we wanted after at least 20 minutes of sitting down, the waitress hands us 2 glasses of water, doesn't say a word, and leaves immediately before we can order. Okay, it's not super busy, but maybe she needs to help another table. We were going to order the Cranberry Crush and Vanilla Spiced Mule, but the waitress never came back. There were other tables around us getting served food and drinks and the waitresses checked on them often, but every time we tried getting anyone's attention, their backs were to us. Ignoring us? Really not noticing us? Your guess is as good as mine. \\nSo in total, we sat there 45 minutes. We had a shuttle to catch, so we just drank our water, and as we left, a waitress thanked us for coming. Like no one even noticed that we hadn't ordered/received anything.

We rented a car and sped to Austin and made it to Franklin's about 45 minutes before closing.\\n We were the last people in line until the very end when 5 minutes before closing a young family showed up. A young lady came out several times to check the line and advices everyone that there was a possibility that there wouldn't be any food left by the time they got to the last 10 people. Aargh! Grrrr! We were part of that group. \\n Immediately after her announcement a bunch of people in front of us decided to skedaddle. Some would say that they vamoosed but it was definitely a skedaddle. Anyway our chances improved and we decided to sit tight, but really we were standing.\\n The young lady came out and pasted a sheet of meat packing paper on the door with ancient Egyptian hieroglyphics which looked eerily, and suspiciously like English because I was actually able to read it and it read: we are out of food.\\nAnother couple left, and we stepped up to the young lady and told her we had come all the way from South Florida and could we at least go inside for some selfies. She told us to wait a few minutes for the group that had gone in before us, and if they weren't gluttonous swine, (she didn't say it, but that's how I heard it in my mind) then we might get lucky.\\n Turns out that the folks in front of us only ordered a couple of pounds of food and there was actually enough food left to feed us, the family behind us, and the quitters who gave up in front of us. Losers!\\n The only thing they didn't have was brisket, but the young man with the very sharp knife and scary tattoos told me he would hook us up.

Let's just take what he gives us, pay the young lady at the end of the counter, and slowly back out to the safety of outside where we could take our chances with the gun happy yahoos passing by us slowly in their two story pickup truck.\\" My wife looked deep into my eyes and nodded silently, which if you think about it is the only way to nod.\\n So I didn't get to eat Franklin BBQ's brisket, and no matter how great his pulled pork and sausages were I felt as if I had failed my wife, I felt as if my father had been right all along.

Ordering is similar to a food court restaurant, where the dishes are sitting out in trays under heat lamps or in pots. You simply point out what you want to eat with your rice.  The combo is a great deal, which is why I only come here for a quick lunch - the dishes were just okay but satisfies your cravings. \\n\\nI loved the lechon, as it's only cut up once you order.

I refuse to throw up, because then I would have to re-taste that god awful food."},{"name":"Alden & Harlow","address":"40 Brattle St","city":"Cambridge","stars":"4","text":"I came when this place first opened, I liked it but I wasn't super impressed.

There's a huge grill platform on the left side of the store open concept, where they stir fry all the fresh ingredients on it. I've also seen this at Mongolian Grill on Denman Street in Vancouver. \\n\\nYou can basically build your own bowl with a selection of veggies and protein, and you can also add extra egg and protein for a cost. There are different sizes you can choose from. Once you finished selecting the ingredients, you can pay at the front. There's also a vitamin bar where they make fresh juice and smoothies. You have a choice of noodles, white rice and wild rice to choose from at no additional cost. They will give you a list of sauce to choose from, you can mix it up on your own, or they have a list of recommended mix to choose from. \\nI ordered a regular bowl with wild rice and Vick's mix sauce. It was delicious! It's definitely compatible to U-Grill, which is a Japanese food court chain that has the same concept. What I like about good bowl is they pre-size everything and they don't charge by weight. So you have to worry about ordering too much. However, I would recommend for take out because it can get pretty smoky to eat in the store."},{"name":"Stubb's Bar-B-Q","address":"801 Red River St","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"My friends and I visited here for our first BBQ in Austin and it was a great choice.

Their signature BBQ sauce is delicious. The pinto beans are hot and tasty. I would def come back when I'm in Austin again."},{"name":"Franklin Barbecue","address":"900 E 11th St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"We decided to bite the bullet and head on upto Franklins BBQ this past weekend to see what the hype was all about. We had been holding onto a Franklin's BBQ gift card we had received about a year and a half ago and decided it was finally time to put it to use. \\n\\nWe arrived at 7:45 am that brisk Saturday morning equipped with sweaters, folding chairs, umbrella's, drinks and breakfast. So glad we brought our chairs because there were at least 50 people (maybe more) ahead of us in line. Apparently the first person to get into line came around 5am, which is crazy since they open at 11am. So we claimed our position in line and got comfy. Luckily, Legend Coffee located in the same parking lot opens early, convenient for the earliest patrons to get their much needed coffee fix. \\n\\nNeedless to say, it was an interesting morning of people-watching. Many people in line came from all over Texas and all over the nation to try Austin's famous Franklin BBQ. I felt sorry for some of the patrons who didn't bring any chairs. After waiting for many hours, they gave up and just sat on the ground. I also felt sorry for those who didn't check the weather forecast because it was drizzling on and off all morning, which eventually turned into heavy rain. Many people in line actually resorted to ordering folding chairs off Amazon Prime Now and had chairs delivered to them right in line. \\n\\nFranklin's opens their doors early just so people in line could order drinks or use the restroom. This I thought was pretty considerate. There was also a waitress going down the line selling beer to people waiting which I thought was cool. Franklin's definitely tries their best to make the wait more bearable for their patrons. They also happen to have a few chairs of their own that people can borrow while waiting in line, but I wouldn't count on it because the chairs definitely ran out quickly that day. \\n\\nA few hours into our wait, a waitress was going down the line and taking meat orders and letting us know what meats would be available once we actually placed our orders. I am sure the people towards the end of the line may have not had all options available. We were also told that our position in line indicated that we would be able to order around 12:45pm-1pm. \\nFinally, after what seemed like an eternity, we were placing our food orders at almost exactly 1 pm. \\n\\nNow onto the food:\\n\\nSince we don't eat beef, we ended up ordering 1 pound each of pork ribs and turkey. The turkey was moist and the bark on the turkey had flavor. I am thinking they use a similar black pepper based rub on all their meats. In order to ensure moist turkey, they dip the sliced turkey in a pan with drippings prior to serving it to us. The pork ribs were also tender and moist, fall-off-the-bone goodness. Even though we didn't order it, the brisket looked moist and temptingly fatty. EVERYONE who ordered the brisket looked like they were in meat heaven. \\n\\nOne thing that turned me off big time was that all meats were being cut with the same knife and same cutting board. I am sure they can find an efficient way to use different knives and cutting boards for their different meats. But after having waited over 5 hours in line, I just said screw it and tried not to think too much about it. \\n\\nWe ordered the coleslaw and potato salad. We didn't order the baked beans as it had beef in it. The coleslaw and potato salad though fresh, were very plain tasting and unmemorable. Their BBQ sauces were good, but the meats were pretty tasty and didn't need any sauces. \\n\\nMake sure you order the Texas Pecan Pie! It is heavenly and perhaps one of the best pecan pies I've ever had. The Banana Bourbon Tart was also pretty good; not overly sweet, but we preferred the Texas pecan. They don't make their own desserts and have them made by Cake and Spoon.\\n\\nNow the most important question: Will we ever go back? The answer is a big NO. I will NEVER wait over 5 hours for food ever again in my life. Although we didn't have their brisket which seems to be their crowning glory, I would not put myself through that even though their pork ribs were phenomenal. The entire experience seemed like an ordeal no matter how much we mentally prepared ourselves. We were also bound with the need to use up our gift card, so we kind of didn't have another choice except for their pre-order option which we were not going to do as it requires you to purchase a minimum of 5 pounds of food. \\n\\nAt the end, I am glad we are now able to say that we tried Franklin's BBQ which is an Austin institution, but we will not be going back.

We met with Victoria and instantly could tell a difference in the customer service we were receiving. We had purchased all new appliances but needed help with the design of the kitchen. Victoria came over 4 times to work with us bringing samples and ideas for the design before we even had committed to using her. We had never done a remodel so it was very reassuring having her help us. She has her general contractors license and was able to guide us through the whole process with electrical, plumbing, HVAC etc.. there is no way we could have done it all without her. \\nIn regards to the product and installation....AMAZING! My husband is a residential appraiser and sees kitchens every day. Without a doubt our cabinets and design are top quality. The precision and time Charlie (installer) took was beyond what I expected. We had some issues come up (completely my fault! I gave the wrong measurements of our vent hood to Victoria) and she figured out a solution immediately. There were many times during our 4 month remodel (it grew from just a kitchen to an entire floor) that Victoria was there for me to cry and vent to. She always has a positive attitude and nothing stresses her out. We also had our hardwood floors redone and went with a person she recommended. That team was also superior. Their bid was the same as other ones we had received but they provided more. \\nWe are going to be remodeling 3 bathrooms soon and we are DEFINITELY using Cabinets Unlimited. You seriously can't find anyone better at design, quality and customer service. \\nI wish I could give more than 5 stars for her. And just as an FYI I found Victoria and her place on Yelp!

When I went to visit today, they didn't have chips, because apparently they didn't turn out well. Not a problem. I ordered the brisket lunch special, which includes a side and a drink. I went with the baked beans, which have brisket mixed in with them, because I can't get enough meat. \\n\\nThe total was about $10, which wasn't too bad. The flavor of the brisket and beans were great, but the portion sizes are pretty small. I was still pretty hungry after my meal.

That being said, I spent an enormous amount of time researching the best places and I kept coming back to Screen Door, which was thankfully tucked right in the neighborhood my friend and I were staying in. \\n\\nScreen door's wait-time was long, but incredibly worth it. The cute, bright ambiance filled the restaurant and the waiters attended to us quickly. The chicken and waffles are of course a must, however, being from the South where this item is a staple, I instead opted for something the praline bacon waffle and it was the perfect choice of sweet and savory. Whipped cream, toasted pecans, and of course, the pralines make this dish feel decadent and because it's a brunch favorite an d who counts calories on weekends, why not divulge in the decadence? \\n\\nThe items on the menu really had a little southern charm meets Portland elegance and I'm so glad I chose Screen Door as our brunch spot for the trip.

They don't use cheap fruit juice boxes for cocktails, instead, they use real fruit juice. Mushroom risotto is a must-order side, it's creamy and tasty. Brussel sprouts and squash on the other hand don't have much taste. The only thing is that I had sable fish, and it was really oily, every bite I took was a mouthful of oil.

The pasta complemented the bacon and egg perfectly. It was a combination I would not expect, but it worked so well. Then, the secret burger arrived. The components of this burger change nightly, even throughout the night, the burger came out differently. Ours had a Parmesan crisp and shaved Brussels sprout salad.

We got there early enough to sit in the shade.\\n\\nIve also heard you can go around 130 and avoid waiting all together. Ive never tried this because you risk them running out of food.\\n\\n\\nThe order: Obviously get brisket. As your second meat, get the pork ribs. They have a really nice mustard rub and add some variety to your experience. Get at a pound of brisket and half a pound of ribs per person.\\n\\nThe sides are nothing to write home about. But, I do appreciate the vinegar based slaw. The potatoe salad is mustardy. Not a lot of mayo/creamy factor in either.

Fortunately, Ward 8 is there to come through like a super hero. We stayed at the Marriott Courtyard Downtown/North Station hotel for a few days, and due to events kept finding ourselves back at the hotel rather late and hungry. \\n\\nWard 8 is what you want in a late night destination: cozy, dimly lit, nice big bar with plenty of room to sit with your party without being nut-to-butt with the establishment's other patrons. You want to wind down, have your last few cocktails of the evening, and if you're like us: shove delicious food in your face. \\n\\nWe ordered whiskey. I was in a bourbon mood and went with Eagle Rare. My dad was feeling the scotch and went with Aberlour 12 (I think). Amazingly, Ward 8 has extra large cubes, which are similar to whiskey balls if you're familiar. This was a pleasant surprise. \\n\\nWe ordered the bar nuts and smoked wings. Not exactly sure what sorcery they use to make the bar nuts, but they are sweet, salty, and delicious. Paired very well with the bourbon. The smoked wings came out a few minutes later and were also very good. They were flavored with Frank's Red Hot sauce and my dad remarked they were some of the best wings he's ever had. Granted, it was late and we were intoxicated, but that is pretty high praise coming from the big guy. They were damn good. The wings also came with a celery/carrot/blue cheese medley that was also surprisingly good. My dad once again remarked that it was some of the best blue cheese he's ever had, but you could've guessed that by now. \\n\\nI think the bartenders switch to beer and wine only for the last 30 minutes of the evening, so make sure you get those cocktail orders in.

Our waiter was super nice and understanding, which we really appreciated. \\n\\nI did not know that this restaurant is more \\"family dining\\" rather than ordering your appetizer/meal. The waiter did warn us that the plates would come out in the order they are ready, rather than when all the food ordered by the table is ready. What ensured was awkwardness as two or three people's orders were brought to the table, while everyone else was left waiting. Yes, we took a bite to try out what others orders, but it felt odd taking their food. I personally only knew a couple of the people who came to the dinner and taking from the plates of people I didn't know was just awkward.\\n\\nThe food was good, but some things were way overpriced. We ordered the sourdough bread, which turned out were three slices of bread with some butter, and it cost $8. The bread was good...but not $8 good. I tried the fried rabbit, which was quite good.

Again, wanting to stray from the usual spots.  I have been keeping a watchful eye on this place and reading many reviews from fellow Yelpers.  We made a reservation last night for 8pm.  When we arrived, we found out that prom was going on; however, the prom crowd seemed to have dissipated by the time we got to the restaurant, as it was not crowded at all.  We were taken to a nice booth in the bar, which offered us a great view of outside and far enough away from the live music to hold a conversation with each other.  We were approached quickly for our drink order and informed that they were out of rib tips and pulled pork.  Ok, slightly disappointing, but we had to take into consideration they had the prom rush earlier in the evening.  I ordered the B & B Smokey Margarita made with El Jimador.  I like to try margaritas wherever I go, but it was not my favorite.  It was made perfectly, which fresh ingredients, but I was not a fan of the smoky flavor as much as I thought I would be.  For food, I ordered the smoked wing platter with mac and cheese and the vegetable of the day.  Let me start with the smoked wings.  There were eight.  The rub on them was delicious and they were cooked perfectly, and were pretty decent size compared to other places that serve wings.  They do offer to toss them in sauce and they have a sauce caddy at the table, but they needed nothing extra.  The mac and cheese was creamy and made with spiral noodles.  It was not orange, like cheddar cheese mac, but it was very mild tasting cheese with a nice seasoning mix.  Now...the vegetable of the day.  I did not grow up eating brussel sprouts and I did not start eating them until just recently.  The vegetable of the day was shaved brussel sprouts with onions and peppers marinated and steamed in the carolina gold sauce that is house made.  It was similar in texture and appearance to cole slaw, but the taste was phenomenal.  My husband got the brisket chili.  It was not thick in consistency, it was a thin, broth-like consistency.  A hearty portion and very good flavors.  We got to speak to the executive chef for a few minutes.  If you see him around the restaurant, stop and chat with him.  He is very friendly and is passionate about food.  He has a great vision and creative mind, so be prepared to experience great menu items from him going forward.

However, our experience this past Monday (Memorial Day) here for brunch was interesting to say the least. First, when we placed drink orders, I ordered a latte and asked for something other than whole milk and our waitress informed us that they may be out of skim milk, and that they were out of all pastries except one raspberry chocolate croissant. I wondered how they could already be out of pastries at 10:30 am on a Monday of a holiday weekend? It only got worse from there. They only had one piece of the vegetable frittata left, had to check on whether they had any of the egg white frittata left and turns out they were out of that too (again, how?), and they were out of coffee and rather than waiting until a fresh-brewed pot was made, gave each person that had ordered coffee a cup that was 1/3 full and said they'd top them off once the new batch was brewed. Additionally, we were seated on the patio and while waiting for our food we noticed our waitress was eating her breakfast/brunch right inside the restaurant by the window where we could see her! It was so odd and we joked at our table that she probably was eating the frittata and pastries that they must have run out of. I guess my thinking is, if you serve breakfast all day (which it says on their menu), and it's a holiday weekend, you'd assume they would not have a shortage of items, especially brunch items, before brunch is over. Anyways, the food we did order was good but not great by any means (hummus tartine = hummus on bread with avocado slices on top). \\n\\nSorry to say this, but I won't be returning and I recommend if you're in the area and want to grab a quick brunch on a patio, just go to Tacodeli instead!

However, we received no initial explanation and were simply left cluelessly waiting with an occasional stalling check-in, which made our otherwise nice and helpful waitress seem inattentive. Upon the sushi FINALLY coming out, neither of us were pleased with the taste. I personally ordered the Dion's OMG, which listed \\"spicy honey\\" as part of the description. I was expecting maybe a drizzle of sriracha-spiked honey or something to that effect. Instead there was a watery sauce with Cajun-like spice dusted over the entire roll, almost like a dry-rub. Gross!

He told me to dispute the charge and that it is his word against mine!! So unprofessional now I'm not gonna even eat this garbage food because I am so pissed. I have been a cook, bartender, and server my whole life. I work for disney...I would never accuse someone of scamming over 8 bucks especially when I offered to waste my gas and 45 more mins of my life to go get it, if they give me $8 of my $40 back or come deliver it 2hrs later and I still get no money back. Now it's about the principle of me paying for something I never received and the extremely rude and terrible customer service from this place, who's food isnt even that good...at all. STEER CLEAR!! I WILL NEVER EAT HERE AGAIN!!!!"},{"name":"Marco's Restaurant","address":"47 Newbury St","city":"Peabody","stars":"4","text":"If you enjoy under cooked doughy pizza this place is for you.

I recommend the Cajun pasta.\\n\\nIf you care to continue reading, let's get into it. When you walk up they tell you to pick a seat, look at the menu and once you've figured out what you want order at the counter. They have card games and dominoes for you to pass the time while you wait for the food. We ordered a little bit of everything. The Cajun pasta was probably the best dish we were served. I was a little disappointed with the chicken combo -- it came with only 4 small chicken wings, but like I said we ordered a little bit of everything so we had enough to fill us up. The Mac n Cheese was good. Better than anything you can get in a chain restaurant.\\n\\nNow for the problem and my reason for rating this place a 3-star: I wanted a beignet today, which was the reason we sought this place out and traveled almost an hour to get there. We ordered beignets along with our food. I figured they would serve those first. They didn't. It took 30 minutes to get our food and drinks. 30 minutes to be served tea. Seriously?? Okay. When they brought the food, the beignets were missing. I asked about it and the waiter/cashier asked if I wanted them with my food. Of course I said yes. 10 minutes later and no beignets. I asked about them again. The waiter/cashier said, oh they are dropping those for you now (No clue what that meant but it sounded like they were taking care of it). We wait another 15 minutes. And I ask again seeing as how we are basically done with our meal. The waiter/cashier says they will be out soon. At this point I get agitated because people are coming and going getting served their meals and leaving. I get up to ask for a to go box, and ask if we can get our beignets to go. The same waiter/cashier said sure. We wait another 10 minutes. We start packing up, and the same waiter cashier told us bye and have a nice day. I let him know that we are still waiting for our beignets and will wait in the front for them. Another waitress approached me and asked if everything was okay, and we told her we never received our beignets. She apologized and let us know that we are supposed to let our server know when we are ready for them so that they can be made to order. We told her that's exactly what we did, and followed up with the server several times. She apologized and said he must not of heard us ask.... Cmon now girl. After some fussing by the staff they began to make our beignets. So we wait yet another 10 minutes to have them made. The original waiter/cashier finally delivered our beignets and apologized \\"for the wait\\" although he really didn't seemed bothered at all.\\n\\nSO in summary, if you aren't in a rush and have 2 hours to kill, go for it. Like I said the food was great. I don't think I'll be coming back, which is sad because its important to support small businesses. It could've just been an off day, but it was enough of a headache to make me not want to return. I hope that your experience will be better than mine.\\n\\nAnd for those that are curious, the beignets were actually really good! Made a complete mess, but in a good way."},{"name":"Jake's Famous Crawfish","address":"401 SW 12th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"For some reasons I felt Jake's is a must eat place when I come to Portland but I think this time things might change for me.

We decided to try this place after a few friends recommended on a Saturday night.  \\nFirstly, place was deserted. We were also a little disenchanted by the shop lights and bland decor. Seemed more like a quick lunch combo place for the office crowd in this area. \\nAnyways, the main goal was to try some delicious momos (steamed dumplings) - which we did. Liked the momos, but yes, I've had better. Good dipping sauce, but I found the portion size to be small. Overall, I'd definitely order it again. \\nWe also ordered their chowmein but they were simply egg noodles with some veggies in soy sauce. Really small portion and there was no umami! Later I ordered he Narghisi malai kofta; the kofta texture was good, but a little heavy/tangy on a tomato curry sauce. I grew up eating this dish so I am really fastidious about this one. Usually malai kofta should have a cashew cream based sauce but this was more like a tikka masala sauce. \\nWe met the owner/manager - service was super fast and friendly. But I felt they are still discovering themselves. Trying to be a neighborhood restaurant and not specifically a Nepali cuisine speciality. I'd drive down there for the latter and not the former. \\nI little dash of color and flattering light to the decor, some more authentic Nepali dishes will add some character to this place. Until then I'll take a break.

And upon walking in I was really very excited after waiting 10mins to get in to order. Immediately was greeted by very hipster bartender who was so friendly and explained the menu. \\n\\nI'm from LA and have been to Japan so I am no stranger to ramen. I was excited though with all these nouveau 'bombs' so interesting. \\n\\nI ended up going traditional to see if they could get the basics correct. Had the Tonkatsu ramen and my homie had the Shoyo ramen. \\n\\nThe food came very quickly and everything looked pretty good. I took a star away due to the greasiness of the broth and one other for the price of the meal. The broth was thick but a little over salted and too greasy for my traditional tastes. The ramen was also under-cooked but maybe if I waited a few more minutes it would have been better...my bad. \\n\\nSo all in all I see why people come here. Decent ramen, fast with a trendy twist. I understand the premium price. You have to sometimes to bring something new to a non-traditional community. I'd come back as long as there's no lines.
