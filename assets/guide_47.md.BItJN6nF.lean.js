I called and made a reservation with the restaurant the week prior and upon arrival, was pleased to see they had set up a long row of tables for our large group, with menus and silverware at each seat.\\n\\nTostones is a casual Latin restaurant that occupies the old Alvarado's space and before that, Taco Bell.  As other reviews have mentioned, it's across the street from the new QT on Buford Highway, just south of I-285.  I like this place because it's a great value, even at dinner.  You won't find a single item on the menu over $7.\\n\\nMenu offerings include hot dogs, hamburgers, burrito bowls, maicitos (sweet corn), sides such as fries, yuca, rice, beans, maduros (sweet plantains), tortas (sandwiches), tacos, Cuban sandwiches, quesadillas, tostones (plantains grilled with cheese and meats), arepas (corn cakes), and a few other items.  They also offer a limited selection of beer and tropical Latin drinks (e.g. blackberry, mango).  The hot dogs and hamburgers have a Latin twist.  For example, one of the dogs comes grilled steak, green tomato, different sauces, crushed potato chips, and a quail egg.\\n\\nI tried two items last night:\\nChorizo Torta ($5.75) - sandwich with chorizo pork sausage, shredded lettuce, cheese, and sauce\\nSteak Tostones ($5.95) - grilled plantains topped with melted cheese, cuts of steak, and sofrito sauce (grilled bell peppers and other spices/seasonings) with shredded lettuce, sour cream, and chopped tomato on the side\\n\\nThe Chorizo Torta was not bad, but I was expecting more meat and other ingredients.  I'm used to tortas being huge -- not necessarily La India Taqueria huge (http://s3-media2.ak.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/shRNbBSD2b5dvVww5pVB8w/l.jpg), but something more along the lines of El Taco Veloz or Las Tortas Locas.  Tostones actually has one of the \\"smaller\\" tortas I've seen in Atlanta, though it's still a big sandwich.  The toasted bun was soft and the ingredients inside were tasty.  However, the sandwich was way too \\"bready\\" overall.  I thought the amount of chorizo was sparse.  If I want another torta, I'd probably go to ETV.\\n\\nThe Steak Tostones was good.  I enjoyed each bite of steak as the meat was tender and savory.  The plantains were a little tough, but I think that was to be somewhat expected given how they were prepared on the grill.  The sofrito and melted cheese went well with the beef and plantains.  I'd recommend ordering one of the tostones dishes.  It's in the restaurant's name after all.\\n\\nEach table comes equipped with four different kinds of sauces: tostones sauce, pink sauce, pineapple sauce, and chipotle sauce.  I didn't try any of the sauces except for maybe a sampling of the pink sauce.  It tasted mayo-based, similar to Thousand Island dressing.  Thanks to Angela H. for making that observation.\\n\\nI thought service was great considering the staff was prepared for our large party before our arrival.  They started taking food and drink orders right away and the kitchen did a respectable job handling the unusually high demand.  Not only that, but we were able to separate our checks.  The entire staff was friendly, hospitable, and spoke good English.\\n\\nTostones renovated its current space and it's much nicer than what it used to be when it was Alvarado's.  It's clean and new-feeling with flatscreen TVs playing ESPN (one of the display panels is rather large), new furniture and light fixtures, and a mixture of high top and regular table seating.  You can order at your table or at the register, dine-in or take-out.  Free Wi-Fi too.\\n\\nManagement should re-do the menus on the restaurant's web site, though.

(Not to mention the great ancient oyster bar on the main level and the dumb-waiters delivering beer and food to the upstairs dining rooms! So cool.) \\nBUT!!!

We had made reservations a few days ahead of time (anniversary dinner) so our wait was minimal - maybe 10 minutes.  There appear to be mostly small tables in this restaurant but it seems they cluster them for large groups.  At first they seated us at a small table next to two corridors on a half wall by the kitchen entrance; the other chair side of the table was at the main entrance to the dining room.  I didn't like the rushed feeling around the table nor did I feel like having my chair kicked throughout dinner so I asked to be moved to a table against a solid wall where there was no thoroughfare.

This isn't to say that the food was terrible - however, it was sub par for what they're shooting for. I'd compare Top of the Hub to the typical cruise dinner you receive in the main dining room each night.

I also had the beet salad, which was super fresh. It's really hard to screw up a beet salad but I have to give them kudos for presentation. We also received a chef's compliment of roasted horseradish squash with bacon, which was very tasty. Unfortunately the meal went downhill from there. \\n\\nI ordered the lobster linguine which by the description, reads to me like a cream sauce with fresh tomatoes chopped up on top. It's my fault for assuming that lobster pasta would be in cream sauce (cream accentuates the sweetness of the lobster), so I take the blame on that, but the whole bowl ended up being doused in stewed tomatoes which dragged the whole dish downhill. The saving grace was the amount of lobster - they chopped up a whole tail which I was pleasantly surprised with. My boyfriend's veal was average - nothing to write home about, especially for the price tag.\\n\\nI suppose it was my fault for having high hopes due to the location, but really, if you're going to run a fine dining establishment regardless of location there are key pieces that can't be missing.

I work for the city Convention & visitors bureau and so it is my duty and obligation to sell the city to consumers all over the country, including but not limited to highlighting the tremendous growth of the dining scene in Atlanta. Before last night, I would recommend poor calvins in a heartbeat. After last night, if I was starving and poor calvins was offering free dinner, I'd happily elect to starve to death. Unfortunately it wasn't just Calvin that was poor last night. Everything from the valet to the hostess to the manager (James, who I believe is actually just a bartender) to our server, even down to the Mac and cheese that had absolutely no flavor, was POOR at best. \\n\\nMy friend made a reservation for 5 ppl for 9:15p. I arrived at 9:18 but due to the absence of the valet attendant for about 10 mins (despite the fact that the valet sign was front and center) I didn't get inside until 9:27. I went to the hostess and asked about the reservation. Very loudly, in front of many other patrons she lets me know that I'm the first of my party to arrive, that they only hold reservations for 15 mins and that if the rest of my party isn't here in the next few minutes she will give my table away. She then walks away to assist another group of patrons before I could respond . Luckily (for her) my friends arrived not even a minute later (due to the same issue w/ valet) and after telling us she'd seat us AFTER the people that arrived on time (again, very rude and tactless) she gets us seated. Two more of our party arrived making our reservation go from 5 to 6 people. Ms. Hostess was not very happy and deliberately made our guest wait at the front while she came to scold us about adding another person. She finally walked them back to our table. To put the icing on the cake, another friend who lives in the apartment homes right next door, literally stopped in to say hello. SHE HAD NO INTENTIONS ON DINING. Again, here is the hostess and she is outright obnoxious, unprofessional, and practically spits at us that we cannot add any more people and our friend can not join our party. She then storms away leaving us all speechless. My friend found her own way back to our table. The only reason we didn't get up to leave was because it was already 10pm and finding another reservation at that time would be a hassle. Against our better judgement, we stayed.\\n\\nFast forward to the meal. The presentation was excellent. Everyone loved their food with the exception of one of my friends  who thought the chicken was bland and the Mac and cheese (w no lobster) tasted like Kraft Mac and cheese. She was right. Towards the end of our meal, the manager comes over to our table. We believed he was coming to apologize for the poor treatment we received from the hostess. Boy were we wrong! Mr. James (who introduced himself as the manager/ owner) tells us in the most condescending tone I've ever heard that we were too loud and that we caused 3 tables to get up and walk out. That we should use better dining etiquette and understand that people are celebrating special occasions and that we should respect that. Well I met with my friends to tell them that I'm expecting my first child, is that less special than anyone else's occasion? To add insult to injury, James never once apologized about the bad experience we had. Not once. He even came and took the server away from the table while we were talking to her. Which wasn't a huge deal because she cared nothing about our experience and only about her tip. How distasteful?! I have no problem if they are unable to accommodate last minute add ons. I also understand that a party may be too loud that they are disturbing other patrons. My issue with the staff at poor calvins was their delivery. Never in my entire life have I seen such a fine place run by such clueless people. Their service staff is literally a joke! a circus! an insult to even the service at IHOP! I am so disgusted with this place I can't stand it. I will never spend a dime in this restaurant or recommend it to anyone ever in my life. I'll share this experience with everyone who will listen. Take my advice, go spend your money where it is appreciated. This place doesn't deserve your time or your money. And James, please find an online service excellence class.

I'll admit, I didn't really believe him, as much as the dishes are pretty much the same. But to surprise him for his birthday, I planned a huge party with all our friends at Panahar. \\n\\nI had never been to Panahar before, but I called a few days in advance of the party to make reservations. Upon hearing of the occasion, the owner recommended that I go for a party package where they prepare a menu for me to look over and bring out a four course meal over time to limit ordering time and waiting for all our food.  I decided to go with this option and within 30 minutes had an email with a PDF detailing our four course meal and it's various options. It was amazing! Pakora, Puri Shrimp, Chicken Tikka Moshola, Shaag Paneer, as well as a few other dishes. There was even rice and mixed naans as well as Mishtee Doi (baked sweetened yogurt) for dessert. All of this would be about $22/person. I couldn't believe it. \\n\\nWhen we finally arrived, needless to say we were all starving. The Pakora came out quickly and was eaten just as fast, but after that we had to wait a bit for the food, being such a large party. But once the second course came out, it did not stop coming. Everything was absolutely amazing. The Chiken Tikka was tender and juicy, so unlike what is common in Indian restaurants. The Shaag Paneer (the equivalent of Palak Paneer) had a wonderful coconut flavor to it, and was one of the first dishes to be ate by everyone. The Shrimp Puri had wonderful color and was a lot of fun to eat. Nothing was overdone, and the spice level was perfect. When they brought out the yogurt for dessert the even brought one with a candle for the birthday boy. The yogurt is actually made in house. It's very tart and not like traditional yogurt. This was the only thing that a few in my party did not like, but I actually did.  \\n\\nBy the end of it, we were all in a bit of a food coma, but all agreeing that yes, Bangladeshi food is better than Indian food.

The restaurant was fairly full, but had a couple of open tables here and there.  We had menus given to us and then we waited.  We waited for 20 minutes before even water was offered to us.  The couple next to us experienced the same thing and I could also hear a waiter apologizing profusely to the table behind me for the wait.\\n\\nThe saving grace came after our order was finally taken that the food came out very quickly.  So my question is that if the kitchen isn't backed up, why is the wait staff unable to keep up?  It wasn't terribly busy and the wait was really unnecessary.  Dropping off water and bread shouldn't have taken that long.  \\n\\nThe food was good, but the annoyance of having to wait for that long when it seemed unnecessary and kind of tainted the experience for me.

Fruit wood smoked BBQ in an automated pellet fed machine is perfect for the novice entrepreneur and it shows. Unlike Pit or log stoked BBQ smokers, the flavor is predictable that will have you asking yourself the classic TV commercial adaptation of \\"Where's the smoke?\\"  Basically, it is a temperature controlled convection oven BBQ machine with a smoke chamber.  Not much craftsmanship needed here.  Although the rub is of fair tasting quality, the bark is of the typical cooking unit design and more soggy than crisp.  The Vegan & Vegetarian fair are a great addition, but over shadowing the caf√© is that the kitchen is grossly under staffed making many of the offered items often \\"out of stock\\" or service very slow and food served cold especially during busy meal time.

I like the cheap beer for sure (offsets the price of some of the dogs...which are a tad high considering we are talking about hot dogs).  I also like the concept, as I love hot dogs.  But to have a top notch hot dog place you MUST use natural casing hotdogs...not the supermarket packed weenies that Frank is using.  I thought their take on the Chicago dog was good toppings wise (and I grew up in Chicago), appreciated the freshly steamed poppy seed bun, but the dog itself was bad.  Vienna beef most certainly makes natural casing dogs, and every reputable hot dog spot I know uses some form of a natural casing dog, which have more flavor, are jucier, and have that signature snap.  \\n\\nI haven't had any of the sausage items, so I can't comment on that.  Wifey had the veggie dog, which she said was standard fare, and I am pretty sure she enjoyed it.

The shop itself is rather small and can only hold a small roomful of people but as long as you don't go in a large group,  seating should be fine. The place is dimly lit, like not in a romantic kind of way but just more so that it was a bit too dark and not bright enough. My 2 friends and I just sat at the bar. I like that the fact that their menu doesn't overwhelm you with choices as there are only three options. Each of us got a different item: the shoyu, the miso and the tan tan. I personally got the tan tan. The flavor is definitely a bit more drowned out even though the broth still had a creamy and smooth richness to it. I wasn't a big fan of the peanuty taste of it. There's the other fact where I see chili oil but I don't really taste it and it looks like it's just there to up my fat intake. If I were to come here again, I would probably get the shoyu instead. I got to try my friend's broth a bit and it was the savory flavor of ramen that I like. In terms of portion, it seems they are a bit stingy with how much they give you. It might be that I didn't realize I wouldn't be getting a piece of pork too. But they only give you one slice and anymore than that you have to pay extra.

Although a very close second.  This was definitely homemade (as in, no doubt about it), and creamy creamy creamy, with loads of clams and potatoes.. but I think the clam:potato ratio was in favor of the clams.. yay! :)  The salad was a basic spinach with goat cheese and pecans..  excellent and refreshing when paired with the soup.  And the burger..   YUM!  I was not expecting it to be so good (just craving some beef protein), but was blown away.  If the burger, soup, and salad was good, I can imagine that the rest of the menu would not fail, either.  \\n\\nThe service was again, A+!  I love Boston for that!

Since they opened, I've been about 10 times. \\n\\nUpon entering you can see the restaurant has bar space on either side, one surrounding the drinks bar, and area, and one surrounding the oven so you can watch the bakers make the pizza. The decor is straight lines and tile, black and white, with modern photographs of Milan. However, it hasn't completely lost it's Milano roots with a cool catholic Jesus and other decor touches. The religious statue is controversial perhaps, but I think it matches the modernist approach to the restaurant. \\n\\nI really loved all the tapas that we ordered from the meatballs to the grilled veggies. My salad as expected was excellent. As with Frasca, the kitchen is happy to accommodate allergies and was able to leave off dairy. My Bianca pizza without cheese was quite tasty.  Also, all the pizzas have a gluten free option, and I thought it was good. The gluten free diner who often accompanies me loves it.\\n\\nThe deserts are excellent, and sorbet is creamy and diary free, and the coffee is delicious in both caffeinated and decaf form. The cocktails that I've ordered were all delicious and can easily stack up as you forget how many you've tried.\\n\\nHowever, The best part about pizzeria locale is that they share a wine list with Frasca, so I'm usually happy to order Pizza and then have a delicious gruner or spatlese.

We showed up on a Friday night at about 7ish.  I should have known that it would be packed considering the Yelp buzz around this place.  It didn't even dawn on me to make a reservation.  The manager (He gave me his name and card but, naturally, I lost it) said that there was a small table of 3 opening up in just a little bit, and if I'd like to wait at the bar in Parkside, he would come get me and the rest of my party when the table was available.  I was totally ok with this, and had a lovely order of fried calamari with a delicious French 76.  Once my friends showed up, they dropped the bomb on me that one more was joining our party.  I knew this would be bad, as that little 3-top was the only table that looked even close to finishing dinner.  1.5 hours later we got a lovely table in the corner of the diminutive establishment.  The decor is minimal and not over-thought.  It was cozy and buzzing with chatter and people having a good time.  They had an impressive Italian wine list, although they were out of a couple of wines.  They've been open for like a minute people, give them a break.  The manager suggested a nice Super Tuscan that we all enjoyed.  We skipped the apps and went straight for the pizza.  We ordered the Margherita, Peperoni Americano, Bianca, and the Roasted Mushroom and Ricotta.  We reveled in the thin, charred dough, the perfectly fresh tasting tomato sauce, the rich olive oil covering all the pizzas, the creamy mozzarella and ricotta, the pungent herbs....\\n\\nThis is making me hungry writing this.....\\n\\nYup, we're heading out to Backspace right now.  Will finish review upon my return.\\n\\nOk.  It's confirmed.  I just adore this place.  The pizzas were perfect.  We had the Mushroom Ricotta and tried the Fennel Sausage and Roasted Peppers pizza for the first time.  The sausage was amazing.  Spicy and extra fennel-y.  Yum.  Still, I gotta say, the Bianca and Mushroom are my two faves.  The manager remembered me and shook my hand, welcoming us back.  Great touch, even better memory!  Speaking of this awesome manager, I'm assuming because we had to wait so long for a table on our first visit (which was our own fault) he brought us out 2 desserts on the house.  We thought we were full, until they arrived.  You would have thought we hadn't eaten for days the way we devoured those desserts!  Kind of embarrassing really.  They brought out the Ricotta Cheesecake with fresh berries and the Chocolate Budino (like pudding or pot de creme) with fresh whip and hazelnuts.  Best desserts I've had in a long time.  You know, this is the smartest strategy for a manager.  Bringing out free desserts for people almost ensures that these people will get dessert the next time they come in!  We don't usually order dessert as we are too busy stuffing our faces to maximus stomach capacity.  But as tonight has proved, I couldn't leave without ordering that Ricotta Cheesecake.  Tell you the truth, I doubt I'll ever visit Backspace without one of those cute little jars of sugary goodness.  \\n\\nSo unless your some expert home pizza maker, I believe you'll love this place... Remember, it's tiny!  Only 7, count them, 7 tables!  Make a reservation on their website to be safe.

The place is deceptively large and the decor is interesting and attractive (though the theme is not readily apparent to me, but that's not the first time). We had a really tough time choosing what we wanted to eat, especially considering it's restaurant week, but we powered through (HEROES) and actually just ordered a good portion of the small plates to share- they all looked so good. \\n\\nBetween us, we got the Butter Bibb lettuce salad, the lobster roll, the pulled pork sliders, the adzuki hummus, and the tuna cups. For dessert we shared the Godiva tiffin with sour cherry reduction and hazelnuts- that was pretty intense and unique. Totally delightful. \\n\\nThere was not a bad dish on the table, but I'm going to rank them from 1 to 5 for you anyway (again, HERO). You should just know that they were all really good and I'd order them all again. So a 5 is still like a 1 anywhere else.\\n\\n1) The tuna cups- raw chilled tuna with some sort of cilantro-y sauce and avocado in a shell. They were extremely fresh tasting and packed with flavor while not overwhelming the tuna.\\n\\n2) Lobster roll- I love lobster, but I don't normally order lobster rolls because I think they often are ruined by copious amounts of mayonnaise. This was perfect- lightly dressed, a grainy mustard dressing on the side, micro-greens on top of a toasted brioche piled with sweet lobster. Seriously lovely.\\n\\n3) Adzuki hummus- I love hummus in every form, but this had more complex layering than you usually find, and it was a treat. It was exceptionally creamy, and slightly spicy, and we kept going back for more. I was not very ladylike around this hummus. Oh well.\\n\\n4) Butter bibb lettuce salad- Butter lettuce is so tender- it's a real treat. This was delicately dressed and accented with hazelnuts. it was a perfect palate cleanser and very fresh tasting. I'm so glad the kitchen didn't drown it in dressing- the lettuce was still fluffy and perfect.\\n\\n5) Pork sliders- these were Asian pulled pork sliders. They were topped with some sort of cole slaw and in a sweeter sauce. They were very good and very filling. They come three to a serving and I don't think I could have eaten more than one. A very hearty appetizer.\\n\\nI am eager to return to De Novo- the wine list is excellent and diverse. Their restaurant week specials are quite reasonable.

As I sat in the comfortable dining room i read a little bit about the place, and some of the other reviews.\\n\\nI was a little bit surprised by the tiny portion of meat that was served to me,  The brisket was delicious, and the sauces were excellent.  I found the collards to be tasteless and mushy.\\n\\nWhen I finished my lunch I was still starving.....the value was not there.  If im going to pay more than $10 to eat lunch, I better be filled up long enough to last dinner.  Last time I ate at Fox Brothers, I paid high prices for lunch, but I had enough food to take home also.  I ate lunch at DBA 2 days earlier and had twice the amount of food for the same price.\\n\\nThey get points for quality of meat and sauce, but lose points for poor value.\\n\\nIll keep watching for reviews, to see if things change...or just wait till they end up on Scout Mob before I go back."},{"name":"La Brasserie","address":"1091 Davie Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4","text":"Yummy! \\nI wandered in on a cold rainy Vancouver night and found a warm pleasant atmosphere.\\nGreat service, wicked Suckling Pig, and cold Kronenbourg on tap.\\n\\nI will be back for the Sunday night roast."},{"name":"Two Urban Licks","address":"820 Ralph McGill Blvd NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"It's overpriced and the portions are very small.

I got the \\"Oh captain, my captain\\" which is topped with vanilla frosting and cap'n crunch cereal. It was super good!!

We got lucky, we went to Voodoo around 10:15 on Sunday morning and the line was only 20 or so people deep.  Additionally, we found parking right across the street.  So, the experience was super easy for us.  We were in and out in less than a half hour.\\n\\nThe joint is small.  But, they keep the line moving in an orderly fashion.  And, remember, you've (likely) had plenty of time in line to decide on your order, so be ready when you finally get up to the register.  This way, you can get in and out and let other people who have been waiting in line get their sugary doughy fix.\\n\\nWe had several donuts, and while I couldn't finish a single one, I tried 3 or 4.  My favorite was the now ubiquitous (thanks to Voodoo) bacon maple bar.  It was clearly fresh, the donut itself was pillowy and lighter than I was expecting.  It is heavily covered in rich maple icing.  It was rather thick, but good.  And, of course, 2 slices of bacon on top.  Bacon and just about anything sweet is good, and this is no exception.  The thing was so rich, I got halfway through it.\\n\\nI also tried the pothole, which is a chocolate cream filled donut with crumbled Oreos on top. I had one bite and that was it, it's just too much.  And, given the size and the number of toppings, difficult to eat, and it was even richer than the bacon maple bar.  My son wanted rainbow sprinkles, so I tried that one.  It was typical of that style of donut.  I also tried an apple fritter, which was very large (no surprise) and good, but definitely not as memorable.  It lacked the crispy bits that I love on fritters, but it did have plenty of apple flavor.\\n\\nI give Voodoo 4 stars because of the variety, quality, and price.  It's not cheap for donuts, but I don't think these are outrageously priced given the size and taste.  I would not eat a meal here, it was more the experience of simply going to Voodoo.  But, if you were to eat a meal, there is plenty of outdoor seating right outside the door, because the inside is tiny.  I would say that Voodoo has earned its national reputation, but that being said, had I waited an hour or more for these donuts, I would have given Voodoo 3 stars.  Under the right conditions (which we were lucky and found) it's a great touristy thing to check out in Portland."},{"name":"Voodoo Doughnut - Old Town","address":"22 SW 3rd Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"The line is sooooo long.

People's favorite are probably the Voodoo shaped donut. My personal favorite is the penis shaped! It was funny. It's like a Boston cream donut, but in a different shape. It is the most expensive of the donut that we got. It was the biggest one. \\n\\nOne of our friend that lives there told us that he sometimes come here after it closes or before it opens (I can't remember).

It's the most delicious eggplant parmesan in pizza form. Fried eggplant slices that somehow never seem greasy, yummy, ever-so-slightly chunky tomato sauce, just the right amount of mozzarella, and a chewy crust. Mmm...we typically pair said pie with a salad to make us feel a little better about loading up on pizza. I think I have a slight preference for the greek salad over the pear-gorgonzola greens because the latter can sometimes be a little heavy on the lemon juice. \\n\\nWe've done takeout at More Home Slice next door and table service at Home Slice.

I especially like how \\"allergen aware\\" the bakery is as a whole, given how many GF folks also have dairy and/or soy sensitivities. The prices are comparable to what you pay in the grocery store for gluten-free goods, and the product seemed fresher.

It's a bit german kitsch looking from the outside (being German, I don't know why they always do that..). Inside looked like a true German Bierstube/Gasthaus.\\n\\nWe ordered the potatoe pancakes to start and the waitress pointed out that it was still happy hour and we could save a few bucks if we ordered them of their happy hours menu, that was a nice touch.\\n\\nThe potatoe pancakes were good, a bit bland I found, but I'm pretty critical about German food anyways. With the applesauce on top tho, it tasted great...not having had German food in a while, we devoured them quickly.\\n\\nThe two main dishes we had were the Bavarian Schnitzel and the Kohlroulade. The Bavarian Schnitzel is a bizarre concoction that I've never heard of, but then again, I'm not Bavarian..I'm from Baden Wuerttemberg..:) Yes, there are huge differences in the regional german cuisine.\\n\\nThe Schnitzel tasted good with the mashed potatoes and they served it with garlic portobello mushrooms and feta cheese (that was the odd part). The size I found decent for the price we paid and the flavor was good.\\n\\nMy Kohlroulade was excellent, it was about twice the size my Mom generally makes them and had the consistency of a meat loaf but flavorwise it was really good. I loved the fact they gave you plenty of juice for your mashed potatoes. I love nothing more in the world than drowning my mashed potatoes in a good sauce.\\n\\nWe managed to finish both dished and were pretty happy about our choice for the night.

I go to the Sandy Springs location out of convenience and because it isn't as busy as the other location. I generally don't have a wait time at all when I come for lunch and pick up orders are always done on time or even before the estimated time.\\n\\nMy 2 favorites are the Sprouting Up and Cha-Cha-Cha ramen. As much as I like the ramen, I do think that there are a few areas for improvement. I think that the broth is a little too rich which makes it difficult to finish not only because of the overpowering richness, but also because it makes you feel incredibly unhealthy. I feel like I must be intaking a lot of sodium every time I taste the broth here. Because of this, I generally opt for the Sprouting Up ramen (not quite as rich) rather than the Cha-Cha-Cha. The Cha-Cha-Cha also comes with \\"very thick\\" noodles, which I feel at times isn't cooked perfectly. On occasion I have noticed that my noodles clump together and just isn't correct texture-wise. I do like the flavor when I'm in the mood for it though and the rest of the ingredients. I think the brussel sprouts in the Sprouting Up ramen are cooked amazingly and adds a great touch to the ramen, and the pork belly and egg in both ramens are cooked to the perfect degree. I generally order the Jinya bun as an appetizer; I think its a great complement to the ramen, and once again, the pork belly is cooked perfectly and seasoned well. \\n\\nMy main complaint, however, is the price for the quantity here. I feel as though for how pricey the ramen is in comparison to other ramen locations, the portion size is very small. In addition, adding toppings, which really don't come with many toppings as is, brings up your bill quickly. I added brussel sprouts to the Cha-Cha-Cha and my bill was already over $17 even after removing some toppings and requesting brussel sprouts instead. The Jinya bun is $4 for just one bun, which I feel is pricey for something so tiny. I wish that there was an option like 3 for $10 or something, and I would probably feel better about paying that. And for the ramen, I wish you could substitute toppings instead of still getting charged for a different topping after removing some.\\n\\nIn general, I do enjoy Jinya Ramen, and I do think it is a very convenient and quick location to go to. The parking lot is huge and you can always find parking somewhere (although at times you'll have to walk from closer to Lowe's or Chick-fil-a) as there are many shops and restaurants in the area.

I haven't had all the bowls around town, so I am open to updating my rating if I find something better. But for now, Umaido (and Hajime) has been dethroned. The service at the aforementioned places always made the dining experience subpar for me, but the noodle soup kept me coming back. I am happy that there are more players in the ramen game now.\\n\\nI have been lucky to come at non-peak times to JINYA and I haven't waited more than 10 minutes to be seated. I have tried the Tan Tan, Tonkotsu Black, Umami Spicy Miso, and Sprouting Up and think they are all fabulous. The service has always been friendly and fast and more importantly, the food has been delicious every single time. This last visit, AT, my sister, and I ordered the sweet potato fries and JINYA bun. Both were very tasty and came out at the perfect temperatures. My sister got the Cha Cha Cha, which I didn't try because the pork broth is blended with fish. No seafood for this one! She claimed that it was just as good as the Tonkotsu Black, which is what she usually goes for. I really liked the Umami Spicy Miso and asked for Kaedama, which is a noodle refill for $2.50. The broth and noodles were scrumptious but I felt that of all the ramen varieties I have had at JINYA, this was my least favorite. It felt a bit lacking. My second round of noodles was more abundant than the original amount of noodles and I wish there was more bok choy at the outset. Regardless, I was very satisfied.\\n\\nJINYA is a wonderful addition to the Atlanta food scene.\\n\\n[#Yelp365: 54/365]"},{"name":"The Paramount","address":"44 Charles St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"GREAT FOOD!!

They appear to be the last holdout in a run-down strip mall on Morse.

At this point in my journey . . . very low expectations.\\n\\nAntolino's serves up a traditional Ohio pizza - thin crust, with square cut.  The toppings do not quite reach the edge, giving you a tiny hilt of airy, crackery crisp crust to hang onto.  The sauce here is on the tart side, which offered a perfect balance to the peps.  Either the peps or the sauce had a spicy kick . . . nice, oh so nice.  I suspect the shrooms were canned, which is, honestly, the only reason for the one star deduction.  \\nMaybe I've lost my mind, or all the Yelp derision I've received over not liking Ohio style pizza has gone to my head, but this was really a very, very good pizza.

The bowls range from more complex (with lots of pre-selected ingredients) to simpler and easy to customize with just about any topping you can imagine.

If you are familiar with Intelligentsia coffee you know that odds are that the espresso was excellent and it was.  I was amazed that I was there on a Tuesday in the early afternoon and they coffee that I purchased had been roasted by Intelligentsia the previous day.  \\n\\nWhen I asked about purchasing cofee, our server went and got one of the people in charge of the coffee to discuss what was available (no 12 oz. or 1lb bags at the time but a 2.2lb bag was available).   When he rang me up for the bag of coffee, he also said that he'd comp the espresso, which was a nice gesture.

There's a big area in the front with a bar and little tables/stools for drinks and bar food. Great for post-work drinks and food. The restaurant opens up to a quieter area in the back for full-menu dining. It was pretty bumping once we left around 8:30pm, so I'd make reservations if you're looking to go on a busy night. \\n\\nTo start:\\nThe yellowfin crudo was fantastic. The yellowfin was fresh and melt-in-your-mouth delicious, and pairing it with pork rinds (?!) and grapefruit was a confusing yet genius combination. An excellently crunchy, fatty, and tart way to start our meal. I would definitely come back for the rest of the crudo menu. \\n\\nGiven my very recent obsession with deviled eggs, we opted for their deviled eggs and fried chicken skin. It looked nothing like the typical hard boiled/piped filling deviled egg, and it was delicious. The waiter mentioned the egg yolks are cooked in pork (?) fat for hours, which may explain why it was so tasty. Given their penchant for putting fried things on top of their food, I'd say Townsman does a great job at balancing textures.\\n\\nEntrees:\\nOur hazelnut porkchops (the online menu didn't show it, but you can get a 'for two' version of this, much like the Amish Farm Hen) were perfectly cooked. I'm always wary of getting porkchops, for fear they'll come overcooked. Great tart (apple vinegar) and bitter (chicory) ingredients to cut through the fattiness of the pork. Also, it was beautifully plated! Next up: That $100 steak. We drooled a little when the waiter brought it to the table next to us. \\n\\nThe only part of the meal I thought was less than spectacular was the brown bread (an homage to canned bread). Our service was attentive (at one point we had 3 different people come and refill our water) to standoffy and harried, but I assume it'll even out as they work out the kinks.\\n\\nTownsman is a little pricey to come often (not surprising, given its location), but I would definitely come here for a special occasion for some tasty food!"},{"name":"Panahar - Bangladeshi Place","address":"3375 Buford Hwy NE, Ste 1060","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"This place is a 6!

I wanted to get one tapas but $10 for half avocado with a little crab meat sounded too much to me.\\n\\nWe ordered Aji De Gallina (pulled chicken dish with peanut sauce, potatoes and garlic rice). It was good but a little in the sweeter side. Rice was very well seasoned and I could just eat rice on its own. We also ordered vegetarian Quinoa risotto. Really a lot could have been done with that dish but they seemed to not put any effort in it. Just some cooked quinoa with a couple of red pepper strips and one tiny blob of cheese and for $16!! Very expensive for those ingredients and preparation.\\n\\nRed Sangria was very good.

To start, we enjoyed a dozen of the Island Creek oysters. I really wanted another dozen because they were out of this world good. The only thing is that each one is priced at $3... which is pretty standard but never fun...We also ordered the tuna poke to share and it was incredible. \\n\\nFor dinner, I got the clam chowder and a warm, buttered lobster roll. Both were outstanding. Typically I don't eat the rolls but it was a brioche roll that tasted like pretzels, so heck ya I did. \\n\\nOther menu items people at my table enjoyed were the Oyster Sliders and Honey Biscuits. \\n\\nThe service was amazing too, and my menu was personalized with my name on it for my birthday.

You order your food at the counter and then sit down, so keep in mind no refills on coffee or drinks.

I'm usually wary of food carts (I know, not typical for an Oregonian) but a friend wanted to go so I went with it. First of all, parking sucks. I feel sorry for the folks that live around there (apartments right next door and townhouses across the street); I can only imagine the near-accidents that probably happen on a daily basis (just a guess, but I wouldn't be surprised). There's a huge grassy field on the next plot of land over; maybe it'll be turned into a parking lot for this hugely popular spot. Anyway, I looked up the cart offerings beforehand and I was excited to try A Cajun Life; I've been wanting to visit their location in Gresham and just haven't gotten to it yet. I ended up getting sushi and Lebanese (weird combo, but my friend did it too!) instead; looking at pictures on Yelp before writing this review, I realized that, while there, I didn't even see A Cajun Life. What? Where was their cart? I'm pretty sure I looked at every single place trying to decide what I wanted; maybe they aren't there anymore or maybe they were just closed for the day (I did notice an empty, closed cart while there). Who knows. So, I got 3 different types of nigiri at the sushi cart, all $3 or under: tuna was simply terrible (not fresh, strange flavor), yellowtail was an odd color (not fresh?) but tasted fine (yellowtail is my absolute favorite, so I was disappointed it wasn't better) but the salmon nigiri was actually quite good. Also, shrimp gyoza was great (I prefer steamed but the fact that they offered shrimp more than made up for the crunchy, fried version). Wanting to try more than one place, I also ended up with an order of grape leaves from the Lebanese cart and I'm so glad I did. They were the star of my meal. Simple (only rice, lemon juice, parsley inside) but tender and briny, with a delicious dipping sauce, for only $4. Overall, for the variety, I'd go back to Happy Valley Station. I would like to try the crepe cart and some of the hard ciders I saw on tap."},{"name":"Voodoo Doughnut - Old Town","address":"22 SW 3rd Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"Definitely touristy, but the prices were much lower than I had been expecting (most donuts were around $1.50-3).

It tastes much better than it looks. I asked questions of the cashier and she answered them. I couldn't decide between the Fatboy burger or the chubby decker. She said the fatboy is like a Big Mac. Special sauce lettuce cheese pickles onions on a sesame seed bun. As she described the Chubby Decker, a customer next to me said it's very delicious and highly recommended it. I took his recommendation and I liked it. What this place reminds me of is the food from Dairy Queen back when they served real food and you could smell freshly grilled burgers walking through the door. you know, the smell used to make your mouth water and you'd pray you'd get everything plus an ice cream. Well, that's what these burgers remind me of. When burgers from fast food joints were actually pretty decent. I highly recommend this place for families to drop in and grab some food to go for when you don't know what you want or everyone wants something different. They have wings, fish sandwiches, burgers, dogs, and even Mexican food. They also offer dessert items mostly ice cream based such as sundaes, cones, malt shakes and they even have slushes to drink along with fountain beverages and sweet tea. Since the space is cramped and there is barely any moving room, they do a good job of getting you in and out. The customer service is very lackluster but I guess it's to keep the lines down but they act like they are seriously bothered when you ask them questions. If you're not in a hurry and you're lucky enough to snag a seat, go for it. You sit in a swivel stool and eat off a counter against the wall. You can people watch as you dine. They have no tables and not much counter seating space. It's worth a try and I must say I'd come back here before going back to the varsity. This place is basically a upgraded version of Dairy Queen/McDeath and may even be reminiscent of when some of those places sold better quality food. Given the choice between them and here, I'd pick here any day. Parking is miniscule to practically nonexistent. Most people must walk over because I don't see them servicing the people they do with the miniature parking lot they have. They gave me a somewhat cold burger. I'm only giving it three stars for the swift service and the way the food tasted.

I can't can't even describe it other than a savory fish cheese cake. I worship almost all things seafood, so I was thrilled! \\nAfter our apps, Alana stopped by with her famous amuse bouche. We scored a kumquat with macerated pineapple. So crisp and clean, and another original idea! \\nMy entree was an incredible seafood pasta (again, so excited for a seafood surprise) that was a bit too salty, but amazing nonetheless. It was packed with calamari, crab, capers and tomato. There were a couple scallops thrown in, and the pasta was perfectly al dente. \\nThe boy loved his bolito misto. I tried the duck, but I could pass on the dish as a whole. I appreciate meat entrees, but I'm not a carnivore to the core like my boyfriend. \\nWe each ordered a \\"surprise\\" for the dessert, and his was better than mine. I hate pecan pie, and luck would have it, that was my dessert. The dessert for my boyfriend, however was a delicious Jeni's sorbet sundae with a fruit compote that was amazing. I am not a fan of Jeni's ice cream, as I prefer the now defunct Denise's, but this sorbet was incredible! I wish the homemade whipped cream had been whipped with confectioner's sugar, but them's the breaks! \\nI had a very strange \\"spring tonic\\" that was a little too radish-y for my taste, but the bottle of burgundy we had was good, albeit expensive ($60.00 after the corking fee). I finished with a digestif- a very strange, creamy \\"limoncello\\" that was actually really delightful, refreshing and tasty. \\nAll in all, it's one of the best dining experiences I have ever had in Columbus or elsewhere. This is clearly a gem in this strip-mall haven. Had our server been a bit more attentive for the entire meal, and not just sporadically, this would probably be a five star review. Another small qualm would be that our table was so wobbly that when my boyfriend cut his wedge salad, the action spilled half of my cocktail all over the table. When they didn't have the burgundy they wanted, they brought us another wine, which happened to be $20.00 more than the wine we had originally chosen. I realize that dining at a place like Alana's means you shouldn't think about prices, but that was a pretty hefty increase in price from what we had ordered. \\nI can't wait to go back to Alana's when I'm not paying!"},{"name":"Fizz Ed'z","address":"142 Pleasant St","city":"Malden","stars":"3","text":"I know it's getting no love here on Yelp, but I was partial to the old Honey Fitz and still miss it today.

Occasionally, they may give out free soup (some type of broth, red bean, or tapioca) before or after your meal."},{"name":"Lee and Ricks Oyster Bar","address":"5621 Old Winter Garden Rd","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"The exterior of this restaurant looks like a ship, and the interior is nicely decorated to give off a similar vibe. I went to this oyster bar with a couple of friends and sat at the bar, since we expected to order a bucket of oysters. Since we came on a weekday, the restaurant was quiet, with only a few other customers. Despite the dirtier look of the bar, which was full of oyster shells, the staff does a good job at managing the cleanliness of a seafood restaurant. \\n\\nThe staff was very efficient and got us drinks/took our order within five minutes upon arrival. They were very attentive of their customers; our server overheard that our phones were dying and directed us to their charging station! On the way out, she made sure to remind us that our phones were there, and not to forget them. Even while she was shucking oysters, she carried on our conversations and made us feel very welcomed.\\n\\nAs for the oysters, we were happy to see that they were quite large, despite not being in season. I was sad to see that there were only about 22 oysters in the bucket; I had seen other reviews where customers got almost 30! They gave us a packet of saltine crackers upon arrival, and squeezy containers of lemon juice and hot sauce, as well as cocktail sauce and horseradish. I was extremely excited to see the lemon juice in a squeezable container, which made it much easier/cleaner than squeezing actual lemons onto each oyster. With the experience of the staff, this oyster bar really has everything figured out, and I fully enjoyed my experience."},{"name":"Two Urban Licks","address":"820 Ralph McGill Blvd NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Me and a friend visited yesterday.

Bartenders were not serving the diners in the bar area at that point and were working the bar.  The runner delivered the food and then nothing.  They really need a dedicated waiter for the bar area.

The restaurant now had three tables and two wait staff, plenty of coverage.  The wait staff appeared extremely overwhelmed and food took a very long time to arrive.  It took four requests of two different servers to get a glass of juice.  I ordered egg whites, toast and bacon well done - a pretty simple order.  Adding cheese for an extra dollar was an option on the menu, one that I specifically did not choose.  The meal arrived with eggs covered in a thick layer of cheese.  I asked, \\"is that cheese? I did not order any cheese and cannot eat this due to a dairy allergy\\".  The owner proceeded to give me a hard time for not telling her about an allergy in my party.  Ah, (1) I expressly did not order the cheese, (2) why would I tell you about a dairy allergy if I was ordering something that is dairy free, (3) really, you're going to yell at me because you screwed up the order?  The toast came with no butter and I had to literally get up and go to the counter to ask for butter because none of the wait staff was in the dining area for a good 5 minutes.  The bacon (well done) was forgotten entirely and when I reminder the owner of this she huffed off, yelling ensued in the back, and a few minutes later some under cooked wafer thin bacon arrived at our table (I-Hop serves better quality bacon).

This was so weird to experience.\\n\\nOur waitress asked if we had come before and we were all new comers so she said she would bring out this soup/bread thing ( forgot what it was called) since this was their welcome to new comers. This thing wasn't that great.\\n\\nWe ordered via writing our order on individually papers that our waitress then collected.\\n\\nI had the 4 piece fried chicken with the famous sweet potato souffle and whipped potatoes as sides. I didn't realize that my souffle didn't have any marshmallows on it until I saw my friend's dish that was topped with it... this was disappointing..In addition, the sweet potato was way too over powered by the ginger in the souffle.. making it more like a dessert rather than a side. The whipped potatos seemed like food for those that don't have teeth.. it was way too soft and lacking texture. The fried chicken was okay, I probably couldn't have told you the difference between this or Popeye's - the chicken was nothing special. \\n\\nThings to note:\\n-Splitting checks was easy, just tell your waitress you want that in the beginning."},{"name":"Voodoo Doughnut - Old Town","address":"22 SW 3rd Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"Came here to see what the hype was all about.

The restaurant reminded me of being home in San Franciso, however our server was uninterested in us and when he visited our table he rushed us and only came back when it was time to pay. We asked for recommendations on cocktails, but the drink was not good. I think it was some type of cognac and peach. I can't remember the exact fish item I ordered, but it was crusted and had some type of pickled lime okra with it that was delicious. The only downside to the entree was the plating; it was less than horrible and very sloppy. I went Thursday and it wasn't terribly hot but the restaurant was extremely cold and the table next to me was mentioning it as well, but no adjustments were made.

After all, one of my favorite styles of sandwiches is the panini.  Hot, melty cheese, gooey, crisp on the outside - their sandwiches by default have all these yummy factors.\\n\\nWhile Cheeseboy itself isn't new in the Boston area (there is the stand in the center of South Station, never mind the two in the food court at the Pru and at the South Shore Plaza), this new site on Washington Street is their first local brick & mortar location.  They just opened on Monday, so I made my way there at the end of their first week in business.\\n\\nI was greeted on the sidewalk by an employee handing out their menu, and on the inside by a smily girl with a tray full of freshly baked chocolate chip cookies.  Why, don't mind if I do!  Thank you very much!  Though not warm, it was soft and chewy and very good.  They sell these for 2 for $1.\\n\\nThe single line led up to two order stations, where my Roast Chief order was taken quite promptly and politely (Italian/ Provolone/ Roast Beef/ Red Onions/ Tomatoes/ Creamy Horseradish $5.49 pre-tax) and then I waited on the side for approximately 5 minutes for my number to be called.\\n\\nWhich leads to my observation - this is a small spot.  Not only are there few seats for the eat-in diner (4 or 5 tables on the right, another 3 on the left) but there isn't a whole lot of room to wait by the soft drink fountain.  But they did manage to keep us moving, so despite the line that was still there when I left with my bundle, I never really got around to feeling crowded as I awaited my sandwich.\\n\\nThe Roast Chief was a rather good sized sandwich, though I managed to completely decimate it along with a shake I picked up from elsewhere.  The tomatoes not the most red, but the horseradish and the fresh red onions lent it a nice bite.  The roast beef was a bit tough in spots as I strived to tear off each bite, but on the whole it was satisfactory for the price.\\n\\n*** 5/29/2013 ***\\n\\nTheir 2nd week of business, and they are still giving out chocolate chip cookies to their customers as they wait in line.  How long will this go on for???  No matter, enjoy it while it does!\\n\\nGiving out cookies on a packed tray, the cookie girl also exuded customer service - offering to take my trash off my hands, grabbing a little cup of the chipotle sauce for me to try when I asked her how hot it was and she commented that she thought it mild.  Agreed, by the way.\\n\\nThis time around both cashiers were offering the Cheeseboy Rewards Card (a portion of each purchase of which are donated to Paul Newman's SeriousFun Children's Network), which gives you a free sandwich after you buy 7, a free sandwich on your birthday, and surprise rewards (unspecified) all year long.\\n\\nFor my lunch, I ordered the Make Your Own Italian Cheddar, pulled chicken, tomato, basil, spinach $5.49.  I dabbed on some chipotle sauce and enjoyed my sandwich posthaste - meaning, it went quite easily down the hatch.\\n\\nI didn't notice the first time around, but the tables in the dining area are set along a long cushioned bench on either wall.  There are no separate chairs, so each table is meant for one person apiece, unless you are comfy enough with your dining companion to cozy up together against one table, or are fortunate enough to grab two empty neighboring tables.\\n\\nOnce you account for tax, $6 for lunch these days is not bad, not bad at all.\\n\\nFYI - The Cheeseboy survey (found on the receipt) offer only allows one free offer code per 30 days.\\n\\n*** 6/11/2013 ***\\n\\nVery nice of them to donate 100% of today's sales to SeriousFun Children's Network.\\n\\nI picked up a medium fountain drink (free refills!) and a classic grilled cheese with tomato and basil in honor of that.  The 2nd half of my sandwich stayed melty till I got through with the 1st half.\\n\\nFor the first time, I noticed 3 stools along a short counter against the wall in the far right corner.\\n\\nFree cookies still live on!\\n\\n*** 6/26/2013 ***\\n\\nIf I keep coming here, I'm seriously going to gain weight, as their free cookies are nearly impossible to resist (well, I can't, although I saw someone else refuse one).\\n\\nSo, for the first time, my order was wrong - they prepared a Cheeseboy Classic when my receipt stated my order of their Tomato Basil Classic.  But (actually, huge BUT here), they redeemed themselves quite nicely as I was offered a free side or soup while I waited for my correct sandwich to be made.\\n\\nI went with the Mac & Cheese (normally $3.29 for a regular) and was asked if I wanted Chili with that (listed as Hearty Chili on their board, also $3.29 for a regular) as that's how the staff likes it.  Sure!\\n\\nIn summary, Chili was the overwhelming flavor of my side, surpassing even the cheesy sauce portion of the Mac & Cheese.  It was hearty indeed with huge red beans, obvious bits of ground meat, and diced onions and green peppers.  Good if you want something extra that's warming.\\n\\nService is indeed a plus here."},{"name":"Pinthouse Pizza","address":"4236 S Lamar Blvd","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"Late night Pizza bites!

My taste buds wanted to try something I haven't had before. Luckily my sig-o made reservations for Andina a few days prior, which is to keep in mind for Friday & Saturday dinners, as they are busy (like people standing by the entrance and sitting around waiting busy)! \\n\\nLive band, awesome music, the atmosphere is wonderfully accepting. The staff is kind, welcoming, and willing to aid you in your decision of meals. They were very observant on refills and any needs you had even in the busy setting = great service!\\n\\nHad ordered:\\nAs appetizers (small dish): picadillo acebichado (tartare) & conchas a la parilla (scallops). And for the main meal: seco a la nortena (lamb) & dorado al rocotto y kion (mahi mahi)... I couldn't pronounce anything so I had to point...\\n\\nThe appetizers were delicious, nothing to complain other than wishing we had ordered a larger dish as we ordered the small tapas size and it was like a party in our mouths. However, it was more than enough especially with the bread they offer with the muy delicioso salsa... I'm not sure if they switch the salsas up, but the middle one was too fruity for my taste.\\n\\nFor dinner I had ordered the seco a la nortena (lamb) and that was very good, tender, and balanced well with the beans and rice. My sig-o ordered the dorado al rocotto y kion (mahi mahi) and I enjoyed that more as I'm a saucy person... To enjoy the fish in the dorado al rocotto y kion you have to scoop the soup alongside with the veggies, rice, and fish to get the entire flavor or else the fish would taste a bit dull. Luckily, my sig-o enjoyed my lamb dish more and we switched mid-course.\\n\\nTo top our meals, I had ordered the guanabana drink - a frozen drink that tasted unlike anything I've had before... Well I lie, except for soursop with alcohol and nutmeg (and I haven't had this mixture, yet). It was presented well and tasted just as good as it looked.\\n\\nDinner overall was an excellent way to end the night, and my first experience with Peruvian food was 5 stars. From the reviews, I intend on trying out their happy hour sometime alongside their desserts that look to die for. Cheers to widening my taste buds! If you've never had Peruvian food or haven't been here yet, it's worth your time and business - guarantee!"},{"name":"Home Slice Pizza","address":"1415 S Congress St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"Nice pizza, busy place, affordable.

My family may be a bit of a hot mess (my sister spilled her mojito, my dad tipped over his chair), but none of that could stop us from having a great experience here the other night. Service was professional despite a few little snafus, food was decent, drinks were good, view was amazing. \\n\\nMy parents don't live in the area, so of course, we ended up at a touristy spot, which is what Top of the Hub is. I had a whole long list of other restaurants in mind (200+ businesses bookmarked on Yelp and counting!), but overall I was pleased.\\n\\nWe were seated at a table where we could enjoy a gorgeous view of wonderful, beautiful, amazing Boston. While we were deciding what to order, a basket of bread was brought out for the table. It wasn't warm, but it was freshly baked and quite delicious. They've got a decent drink menu, so I couldn't pass that up. Both my mango mojito and my sour apple martini were very tasty. \\n\\nIf you're not sure what to start with, I would go with the spicy lobster soup. It is thick, creamy, spicy (as expected), and full of succulent chunks of lobster. It was by far the best part of the meal, and I finished my bowl wishing I could have another, and another, and another... One soup, however, that I would stay away from is the clam chowder. It was watery and without much in way of clams.\\n\\nMy entree sadly did not shine as brightly as that amazing soup. I got the veal sirloin, and it was chewy and under-seasoned. Definitely the disappointment of the night. \\n\\nBut dessert hit a sugary sweet high note! I got the assortment of freshly baked cookies (yup, all for myself... but I shared!). They came out warm, doughy, and incredible in every way possible. Someone had overheard that we were celebrating my birthday, along with my mother's and sister's, so we each had a candle and \\"Happy Birthday\\" written on our plates, which was a nice touch.\\n\\nI mentioned earlier that there were a few little snafus throughout the evening. Hey, it happens! But what I really appreciated was how professionally they were handled. My entree was supposed to come with gnocchi, but I was given polenta instead. I informed my server of this, and was brought a whole bowl of delicious gnocchi in a rich, creamy sauce almost instantly. My sister was brought the wrong dessert, and same deal - she got a replacement within moments.\\n\\nSo while the food isn't always stellar, the experience definitely is.

So I started off in the hood near the colleges at \\"Busy Bees\\" and let's just say the ghetto drove this afr american to look for other resources. (see review for addtl story).  So my friendgirl that was with me, has been here a while and upon asking what other place she knew of, she immediately said Mary Macs.  Well I'd seen this place several times because I'd frequented \\"Entice\\" during the NFL season (Go Cowboys!) quite a bit but i did not know it was a soul food restaurant.  Soooo we go over there and I was thoroughly impressed!  I saw people waiting but i then found out it was because their entire party was not there yet.  So as soon as I walked up and gave my name and party of 2, the maitr'de said \\"right this way Nissa\\" and after being challenged for a first come first serve table by a lady in purple snake skin body tights with 4\\" pumps on a sunday at 4pm, this sounded like music to my ears.   \\n\\nSo anyway, the food was delectable!! I had fried catfish, fried green tomatoes and sweet potatoe souffle with cornbread.  But before you get to that, the bread basket contains not only rolls and cornbread but also sweet rolls...yuuuummy!!!

See i'm an old school \\"in the heat of the night\\" fan and one of the drinks I'd always wanted to try because of this show is a mint julep..well Mary Mac's has this on their menu!  So I ordered it and well...they don't crush the fresh mint up and use it as a part of the concoction so when you drink it all you taste is bourbon and sugar..no mint.  The only mint you get is the big green stalk that is sticking out of the glass and that does not add to the taste at all.. BUT i'm still a bourbon fan so it was all good.  Plus our waiter was great! He reminded me of the older afr american guy on \\"Dirty Dancing\\" that was the band leader. LOL!!  \\n\\nSo the prices were not bad and the food was great and so was the ambiance!

Remarkably unaltered, it's not the fancy poutine that so many gastropub restaurants are trying to class up these days. It's waffle fries, gravy out of a can, and plain ol' cheese curds. It's straight from Canada. And it's freakin' delicious.\\n\\nThe hot dogs, meh. There sure are a boatload of hot dog options. There's a vegan option, but surprisingly no fowl (turkey or chicken) for the non-red meat eater. The dogs were fine. I went with straight chili-cheese, not at all worth the $4+ sticker, and took a sampling from the other diners.\\n\\nMore than anything, the ambiance was just a bit off-putting for me.

Bacon, egg & cheese bagel sandwiches, strawberry/banana/nutella crepes, and delicious tortellini dishes--all delivered straight to my college dormitory after normal dinner hours. No wonder I gained 20 pounds my first year of college.   \\n\\nAlso, this place has clearly changed since I was last there.  It looks about 2 to 3 times bigger now.    \\n\\nBut from what I saw today, it has gone downhill.  Granted, my friends and i came here on, OF ALL DAYS, the day of BU graduation.  However, the restaurant was not overflowing.  It had a manageably higher level of customers, but not overwhelming.  The number of customers present matched the number of tables available relatively well.  With this in mind, I was disappointed.\\n\\nBreakfast was so bland compared to what I remember.  Their bacon used to be deliciously crispy and ever-so-slightly burnt which I love.  Today it was floppy and boring.  Their egg omelets used to be amazing--today it was clear that the cheese used was the overly processed fake kind.  It tasted, well... gross.  The hash brown potato pancake thing LOOKED cool, but it was not good at all.  Half of my \\"grilled\\" muffin was cold, leading me to think they forgot to prepare one of the sides.   \\n\\nThe crepes are pretty hard to screw up, and my friends seemed to enjoy theirs.  But really, the prices are relatively high for such a simple breakfast meal, and so I'd have expected something a lot better than what we got for the money.  \\n\\nAlso of note, I was disappointed by the service.  When we got in line, we were told that unless we had a table, he could not take our order.  We had just stood in line for 5 minutes when he told us this.  So we had to exit the line, wait for a table, and then get BACK in line and wait all over again.  It would have been nice if they had put up a sign or something, or announced this while we were standing there.  Also, he didn't even bother mentioning the possibility of take-out, which we might have been OK with.  \\n\\nI will come back here at some point in the future to see whether today was just a fluke, but for now I don't think this was anything close to the place I adored all those years ago."},{"name":"Two Urban Licks","address":"820 Ralph McGill Blvd NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"The atmosphere is unique and I enjoy the pillows at the tables.

I went and spoke to the Credit Union who suggested I might speak to the manager at the Gateway Carl's Jr  and warn him/her about what is happening at the restaurant.. \\n\\nA young man there told me the manager was gone for the day and he was in charge. I very patiently and quietly explained the situation to him. He said he did not understand. Once again I explained the situation and then he once again said he did not understand. At this point I simply asked him for a piece a paper and a pen to write down my contact info and asked him to give it to the manger. The young man wrote down the manager's hours for the next day for me on a slip of paper from the cash register then took my contact info that I'd written for the manager. Not once did I get loud, obscene, or vulgar with this young man. However it was very frustrating to try to talk to him and I did tell him if I did not hear from the manager I would call the police. \\n\\nThe next day I received a phone call from a gentleman who informed me he was the manager of the Gateway Carl's Jr restaurant. The gentleman did tell me his name once at the beginning of the conversation but I did not write it down and he never repeated it. The manager on the phone asked me what the problem was. I was trying to explain about both my cards and he kept interrupting me. And so the conversation went. I would get maybe three words out before he interrupted again. Finally he went into an angry tirade about how sorry he was that my card was compromised and that people steal identities every day. He said I could not prove it was stolen at his restaurant and that he had thirty employees and he could not, would not investigate or watch all of them because he had a restaurant to run.\\n\\n And did I have any idea how many calls he gets about someone stealing card numbers?\\n\\n After all his employees simply swipe the card nothing else. He also told me that I could call the police for all he cared, because that was the only way he was going to watch any tapes was if the detectives showed up and asked for them. Besides my card was a Visa card and the police would not get involved in something that cost a burger since Visa will just replace my money anyway. He then asked me if there was anything else he could help me with. When I told him no he informed me to have a good day and hung up. \\n\\nI sat there stunned looking at my phone. My wife and my two neighbors who had dropped by had to get my attention because I was simply numb. I love their  1/2 pound Mile High burger with no onions. It was my favorite burger.

It was sold as flights of mini hotdogs and sausages. We get seated and look at the tasting menu. It doesn't list anything as hotdogs, but several of the items are sold that way, so there was hope. \\n\\nI did get a FANTASTIC drink, the Triple Crown.  I never drink but this was a great beverage.\\n\\nWe wait and wait and finally our food comes. Except for my husbands' dish. For some reason they thought we wanted to share. They ask us if we want it still (duh!) and we are forced to share a VERY underwhelming plate. NO mini hot dogs, just 4 tiny slivers of sausage per each dish. The only thing that was slightly special was the Alligator Fritter. Unfortunately, they got cold while we were waiting for silverware and were terrible cold. When my husband got his hot plate, I ate one fresh and they were much better hot. Still, the plate was not worth the $12 by any means. Especially when it was advertised as something different.\\n\\nThe service was terrible. About 5 minutes after ordering our waitress came out to tell us that one of the dipping sauces for our fries is no longer on the menu. I'm sorry but if your menu consists of a photocopy on paper, REPRINT THE MENU when you remove something from it.\\n\\nWe waited for quite awhile to get our food, the server didn't get our order right. Oh, and no silverware. We waited  and waited until finally my friend got up and forced someone to bring us silverware as our waitress obviously forgot about us asking for it. And no one ever dealt with the fact that we had such terrible service.\\n\\nNow, I am not one to normally flip out on bad service. However, when you are paying so much for a hot dog, service should be part of why it is so expensive. And when you pay $12 for 16 very thin slices of sausage, service is everything. I was VERY disappointed. Wish I had just bought a hot dog as this ended up being a scarily expensive dinner considering the lack of food and service.

We had two ribeye sandwiches a filet plate and an Angus burger. We also had two cheese bite sides as well as a side salad. All were excellent. The steaks were done to medium and were grilled to perfection. The focaccia bread was tasty and fresh and the overall experience was a two thumbs up. The price was around $50 for four adults with 4 entrees and drinks, not bad for Disney area.\\n\\nTake a chance and head over to Steak on Fire, you won't be disappointed!!"},{"name":"Top of the Hub","address":"800 Boylston St, Ste 52","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"Nothing beats the view.

I stuck w/the Fried Flatbread w/Ricotta dip which was very disappointing for several reasons.  Bread was too dense and dip was bland, so you had two flavorless components.  In addition, why even mention nuts when there was barely a sprinkle of them that you couldn't taste?  My drink sounded delish', like the food but again another disappointing swallow.  Bartender insisted I have a glass of water saying it's policy when I simply did not want one and why waste it. \\nInterior is pleasant w/a good layout.

They were taking longer than their usual 7-10 minutes, which was already unheard of but like I said, I was used to it. 18 minutes later, this young lady pulls up and hands out a bag. Before she could walk away, I notice in the bag that was only one set of fries when we had ordered two meals. The lady rolled her eyes and had shortly returned with\\nmore fries. She was quick to disappear after that and my BF noticed that they didn't leave a sauce for his tenders so we pulled up to the window to ask for some.\\n\\nWe kindly ask for some ranch and the lady wanted to charge us 75 cents for one small cup. Even when we had told them that we bought tenders, they still insisted on the price. \\n\\nWorking in customer service before, I know all about the irrational customers from time to time, so I was calm the entire time I was explaining it to her. But she just threw an attitude from the bat. \\n\\nAnyway, we got our ranch as soon as they realized that we were holding up one of the drive-thru windows and 23 minutes later, we finally got our fast food and drove off.\\n\\nOh yeah and my boyfriend's lemonade was watered down, but I guess it was his fault for not tasting it while we were there, right?"},{"name":"The Fireside","address":"801 NW 23rd Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Fireside was amazing!

The wait time wasn't much different from any other restaurant.  I ordered the chicken and waffles!  Very good!  The wings were seasoned just right, not too salty nor too bland.  The waffle was perfect.  The gravy made me question if my uncle actually knows how to make gravy.  \\n\\nI think the wait staff needs some more refinement.  Otherwise, it was a positive experience.

We felt like we were in some third-world country.  The drapery on the windows looked like something purchased at a garage sale as did the knives and forks.  I  understand budget, but this was ridiculous.  Now, on to the food.  It's three courses for $35 which doesn't seem bad but the food was mediocre at best.  One of us had the chickpea salad which was a little pad of fried chickpea that tasted like polenta.  This was served with some chewy mushrooms and not-quite-cooked greens.  The other party had the beet salad with slaw, it was attractive but was a very tiny serving.  The two entrees we had were the roasted shrimp with grits and shrimp broth.  This was supposed to be a take-off of something from New Orleans, as best I can guess, but it failed big time.   The shrimp were mushy and the grits were covered in a shrimp sauce that made them almost unedible.    Nothing else inside the bowl.  That was it.  Three mushy shrimp which were neither spicy nor flavorful.  The fried oysters were good but again, there were only three small ones on the plate!  It was served with some nice steamed asparagus.  Desserts were strawberry pie which was a small round serving about 3 inches in diameter.  The crust was thick and came with a paltry amount of filling.  Taste was on the bland side.  The chocolate cream was served in a wine glass with a little bit of mushy strawberry mixed in and whipped cream on top.  Flavor was nothing to rave about.  In fact, I've made better chocolate creams at home.  Bottom line:  we went home hungry and extremely disappointed in the overall experience.

It came in an iron skillet - points for presentation!  The butternut squash was cooked through without being mushy.  I liked how some of them were browned a bit on the outside.  Their sweetness balanced very nicely with the freshly made pesto.  A win.\\n\\nWe got the bianco pizza because my friend just simply could not resist anything with ricotta, and it was definitely a good call.  The ricotta was so sweet and fresh and smooth that it was like heaven in your mouth.  There was just enough arugula to cut through the creamy ricotta so it doesn't get too overpowering.  I felt guilty that I was eyeing the pieces with more ricotta, but I exercised restraint since my friend was treating me to dinner and she was the one that favored ricotta.  I did feel the flatbread was a bit too hard on the edges though, to the point of being burnt.  They were crunchy and took some effort to chew through.\\n\\nThe dessert selection was actually not as interesting as the rest of the menu, but we got them anyways.  We got the ricotta cheesecake topped with apple and brown sugar crumbs.  Did I mention my friend had no resistance to ricotta?  We also got the chocolate custard with hazelnut toffee.  Again, the ricotta was really good.  Still that recurring theme of really fresh ingredients.  The chocolate custard actually had a decent chocolate taste to it instead of just being sugarly-sweet and chocolate-colored.  I could have done without the toffees though.  In fact I ended up not eating them, and only bit off the hazelnuts.  Both of the desserts were actually a bit too sweet for my taste, but mostly because of the toppings.  They were super cute though because they came in tiny mason jars.\\n\\nOverall a very nice dinner, and would be a nice place for a date.

However, my parents were in the city for a meal, and they'd been hearing about the place for a long time and wanted to give it a go (and they were paying).  Plus, since TUL is located right across from my building, it's an enticing choice when you don't want to deal with driving and parking.\\n\\nThe atmosphere felt very different on a Monday at 7 PM than it did on a Saturday at 9 PM (duh).  I mean, the d√©cor was obviously the same, but the light hit things differently and made it seem a lot less hip.  In fact, my dad even said he was expecting the space to be more \\"shi-shi.\\".\\n\\nFor appetizers, my parents chose the empanadas and calamari.  This time, instead of oxtail, the empanadas were filled with shortribs.  Also, I asked for the crumbled queso on the side, since I remembered it overpowering the dish.  The shortribs seemed a little less flavorful than the oxtail, but the meat was every bit as tender.  Also, the smaller amount of cheese let us really taste the crust and the chipotle sauce, which was definitely a good thing.  The calamari were, again, cooked perfectly and spiced nicely.  I love that dish's balance between spicy and sweet.\\n\\nFor entrees, mom went for the bronzed scallops with Gouda grits and smoked tomato broth.  The dish once again got a wonderful review.  Perfectly cooked scallops and creamy cheese grits?  How can you go wrong?!  Dad got the  Maple Leaf Farms duck breast, which was stuffed with italian sausage and served with cayenne sweet potato puree and ancho BBQ jus.  By far the best dish of the night, the flavors and textures were just amazing, even though the duck itself was just a touch overcooked.  I went for the wahoo with summer squash and sunchokes; it was light and tasty, but the fish was a little dry.\\n\\nOur server was friendly, engaging, non-intrusive, non-awkward, and just generally a fun and interesting human being.  He made great recommendations and chatted with us about other restaurants we've enjoyed (notably, The French Laundry, where my parents just dined last month).  He talked about his travel to Asia.  We debated about food blogging and molecular gastronomy and whether or not cupcakes have jumped the shark (they have).  I will certainly ask for him when I return.\\n\\nFor dessert. Mom got the chocolate mousse rice crispy treat, and she really loved the chocolate malt ice cream.  Dad got the bread pudding and said it was good but not great.  I got the cupcake plate (previous conversation with the waiter be damned), which had three varieties: chocolate on chocolate, carrot cake and cream cheese icing, and banana caramel with (I think) lemon icing.  The chocolate treat went right in the doggie bag for later, and I don't really dig on carrot cake, so that one went to my parents and they reported that it was one of the best versions of carrot cake they'd ever had.  The banana lemon cupcake was incredibly moist and delicately flavored, and I liked it a lot more than I thought I would.  The brown sugar ice cream that accompanied the cakes was absolutely amazing.\\n\\nSo, another very nice meal at TWO.  I don't know why people love to hate this place-it's tasty food in an interesting atmosphere with (in my experience, anyway) attentive service.

My wife and mother-in-law got their entree's delivered while I sat there for 10 minutes staring at an empty table. It was clear that they forgot about my food, but nobody came by and said anything about it. Then when I got the burger, I ate about four bites before I noticed a funny taste. I took the bun off and tore into the burger and it was raw. Not medium rare or rare - it was purple, raw ground beef. \\n\\nThe waitress was really nice about it and I'm a forgiving dude, but I also believe in making things right. The manager on duty came by and said that \\"I understand we had something a little undercooked. Sometimes they get a little carried away with the rare. We won't charge you for the burger.\\" And she left.\\n\\nWhat I got wasn't a little undercooked, it was dangerous. The waitress was totally grossed out when she saw it. I understand that stuff happens, but when you clearly forget a meal and then rush it through and serve raw ground beef, I want to hear \\"how about another entree free of charge?\\" Or maybe \\"here's a gift certificate because we really want you to come back.\\" Anything other than \\"this happens sometimes, we won't charge you for the inedible meal.\\" \\n\\nVery disappointing to get this from what's supposed to be a nice restaurant.

The waiter tried really hard, but many of the appetizers were not alterable. The bread itself is made with butter, though it looked delicious. I ended up trying the lobster roll, sans bread. Although all of the excellent reviews made me want to try it, it was just okay and overpriced at $21. I had the grouper entree, which  didn't need to be altered since it is pan seared in olive oil. It was tasty, but with very sparse accompaniments and slightly over seared. I ordered the beet, farro, mizzuna side to supplement, and it was tasty, but over salted and the yellow beets were very starchy. I had the cranberry sorbet for dessert, which was tasty but was overly generously seasoned with mulling spices. Nice idea because there isn't much you can do with cranberries, but it was over powering.

Voodoo is a tiny little shop so don't be surprised if there's a line extending outside the door. It goes by super fast unless you're stuck behind an indecisive donut eater. Voodoo is conveniently located next to a big alley filled with tables and plenty of seating if you want to eat your donut right away. \\n\\nThey do have a ton of options here, might as well get at least a dozen! All of their flavors are listed on a chalkboard on the wall, but some of the uniquely named ones don't have descriptions, so you might just have to wing it. There's a rotating donut case too if you want to decide by looks instead of description. I didn't want anything crazy but nothing boring either, so I went with the Portland cream donut, nicely described as \\"Portland's official doughnut.\\" Sounds good to me...and it was! It's chocolate glazed and inside there's a custard-type of cream... it almost reminded me of a Boston Cream Pie. The donut tasted dense and fresh, no wimpy grocery store donuts here. I also tasted my boyfriend's Voodoo donut and the Mango Tango donut. The Voodoo donut is more for its looks - since they decorate it just like a Voodoo doll. Tasty, but it's basically just a chocolate frosted donut. The Mango Tango donut was really good though - packed with mango flavored jelly and topped with a thick glaze. That was probably my favorite of the three, since it was the most unique... you rarely see a Mango donut at your neighborhood donut store! And we didn't eat it until the next night, and it tasted just as good."},{"name":"Two Urban Licks","address":"820 Ralph McGill Blvd NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Great atmosphere, great vibe, very attentive staff, amazing food.

I came with two of my friends on a weeknight around dinner time and the wait was ~25 minutes.  It's a pretty small restaurant inside a plaza and it gets pretty busy.  What's nice is that you can track your place in line via your phone (they send you texts) and you can also place your order before you sit down, to minimize wait time once you're seated.  \\n\\nSince there were three of us, and there are only three types of ramen on the menu - we tried all three - tan tan ($13), shoyu ($11), and miso ($13).  Side note: the tan tan is the only one that does NOT come with an egg!  Half a boiled egg is an extra $1.  Everything here is overpriced in my opinion.  I had the miso, and the noodles were pretty good.  The broth wasn't that savory - I've had a lot better.  Most ramen places also have the chili powder on the table, which this place didn't have.  You can ask for spicy garlic oil, which is also an extra $1.  We also shared the cucumber appetizer (only appetizer on their menu -- $5), which is essentially just large cut up cubes of cucumber with sesame oil.  Nothing special in my opinion.\\n\\nLet's just say that my friends and I weren't completely full when we left, and yet we dished out more money than we normally would for ramen.  I'm glad I tried it, but I likely will go to Allston/Porter Square for my future ramen cravings."},{"name":"Home Slice Pizza","address":"1415 S Congress St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"So glad they're st 51st Street so I don't have to schlep downtown and circle for 29 minutes just to find parking.

I probably went there about 50 times.  It's the only Chinese restaurant that I found in the greater Boston area that compared favorably to Chinese food in California.  For example, the salt and pepper spare ribs are pretty good.  \\n\\nOh yeah, don't go for the decor.  \\n\\nBut what puts Victoria over the top is the quality and price of the seafood, which you will *not* find in California.  Under $20 for (the signature delicious) twin lobsters??  $10 for a whole steamed fish?  Or two crabs?  This is the reason that when my California friends - no strangers to some of the best Chinese food in the US - visited me in Beantown, their favorite stop would almost always be the Victoria.  One of my (Chinese) friends told me, in utmost seriousness, that he would have considered BU more strongly as a college choice if he had known about the Victoria beforehand.  In a weird way, this restaurant is the ultimate fusion between the East and West coasts (sucks to be you, Ming Tsai!! ahem) and my pick for the best restaurant value in greater Boston.  In fact, nothing says Boston like hunkering down in Victoria in a raging blizzard, just you and some twin lobsters, eating like a king for a mere pittance.\\n\\nPro tip:  If you can't find parking along Comm Ave, just go a bit further and park in the free parking lot behind the big Shaw's.  There's plenty of spaces and they don't check, but if you're paranoid, take a trip inside the supermarket first and then sally forth out of the main entrance.  \\n\\nps.

I frequent the Davis Square Spike's, but I stopped by this Spike's when meeting a friend at Berklee. The differences between the locations are minimal. I'm a pretty big fan of hot dogs in general, and one of the reasons Spike's consistently disappoints me is that the ingredients and toppings of their numerous specialty dogs overwhelm the hot dog itself. So if you're the type of person who doesn't really like hot dogs, then maybe Spike's is the hot dog joint for you. \\n\\nFor me, there is only one truly good item on the menu: the Mutt, a plain all-beef hot dog placed awkwardly in one of those absurd New England-style top split rolls. (Seriously - their buns are terrible. Way too big and doughy.) If you order the Mutt, you can add a little green relish, mustard, and celery salt (or, if the spirit moves you, ketchup and red relish) from the do-it-yourself condiment bar. Order some curly fries and a soda, and you have a nice meal.\\n\\nThe other decent hot dog on the menu is the Junkyard Dog, which features a serviceable combination of brown mustard, chopped scallions, a slice of pickle, a slice of tomato, and some hot peppers. It's basically a Chicago-style dog a la Picasso: all the pieces are mixed up and wrong, but it still sort of works. When you're ready to move beyond those two items, you quickly find that Spike's Junkyard Dogs has taken an all-too-typical misstep. There are pizza hot dogs and buffalo hot dogs, reuben hot dogs and teriyaki hot dogs. These different dogs have clever names, and tend to work better as ideas than actual foodstuffs. (E.g., \\"The Contradiction\\" is a veggie dog covered in bacon. Nice concept, but it adds little more than a joke to the menu.) The specialty dogs don't taste like their names, they simply taste like the Mutt with a hodgepodge of toppings. There's too much going on, but there's also too little going on - each specialty dog consists of an all-beef hot dog (or a veggie dog, if you're so inclined) on a top split roll, with a lot of stuff thrown on and a funny name attached. That's it.\\n\\nWhen it comes to high-concept or gourmet hot dogs, I think there are two schools. The first believes that, with certain exceptions (including the great Chicago-style dog), you shouldn't need more than a sausage, a bun, and three additional ingredients. Keep it simple, and make sure the tastes and textures all mesh. You don't need a reuben hot dog when you could simply have a reuben sandwich...but if you want a reuben hot dog, do it well. Don't simply make a plain hot dog with reuben ingredients piled on top. The second school believes that the more ingredients you pile on, the better - especially if they're excessive, humorous, and challenging to eat. This can be fun, especially after a long night of drinking. But it's not what I'm looking for from professional hot dog purveyors."},{"name":"Bouldin Creek Cafe","address":"1900 S 1st St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"Been a loyal customer of Bouldin since 2004, and it just always makes me so happy to enjoy a meal here.

We did enjoy the atmosphere, though, truly a \\"dive bar\\" in the best sense of the term.\\n\\nFood-wise - while trying to temper our expectations, we each (two of us) went with the special, the $20 filet mignon. It came with a salad, shrimp, mashed potatoes, and cooked vegetables. Unfortunately, the steaks were very disappointing and the worst part of the meal. I ordered my steak done medium and the portion of mine was significantly larger than that of my boyfriend's. Additionally, mine was cooked unevenly, with half cooked medium and half cooked rare. The steaks also did not appear to have been salted. Our biggest complaint with them was that they were not seared first to make them crispy, leaving them with a mushy texture. The shrimp tasted pre-frozen, which makes sense considering the price. The mashed potatoes were also pretty dry. Unfortunately there was no part of the meal that left us satisfied. Maybe the Italian cuisine that is served normally is of a higher quality?\\n\\nConsidering the $20 meal, what we received is not super surprising (though I'd argue the quality of the combined meal elements was poor even for $20); however, I think many of the reviews give the impression that the food quality is very much above that of more typical bar food.

This will not be on the list. Not a terrible hot dog, just average. Barely.  Typical chain store. Simco's has nothing to worry about.\\n\\nWe got here around 11:00AM, the place was completely empty of customers. The girl at the counter did not looked thrilled to see us come in the door. She must have been the same person who cooked our dogs, because we didn't see anyone else working here, and they cook the dogs out of sight, which is where she went after we ordered our dogs. She gave me the impression she was new.  She seemed very uncomfortable working with the cash register, and appeared nervous. Maybe she wasn't confident with her English, but she did fine in that regard. She brightened up after we got our orders and she happily showed us the condiments section.\\n\\nThe bun they use here is special, it's not a hot dog bun, it's bread, maybe a sour dough, cut to accommodate the dog. This is better quality bread than you'll get with most hot dogs, but not really what I want when I want a hot dog. Hot dogs belong in a hot dog bun. If you're going to make hot dogs at home and you realize you're out of buns, you run out to the store, don't you? Do you shop around the bakery section asking yourself if that baguette might work, or maybe the focaccia...  no! you go straight to the bread isle and you get hot dog buns. Period. I bet a lot of people like these 'buns' a lot. I'm just a crotchety old man when it comes to hot dogs. Do it right.\\n\\nThese dogs are much thicker than regular hot dogs, which I suppose would impress many into thinking they're getting something special. I am not opposed to this variation, I think I might like this idea, done right. Too bad it wan't cooked right. My dog was not hot. It was warm, maybe even very warm, but not hot.  And there was no \\"snap\\" to it when I bit into it.. We walked into any empty store, and waited ten minutes for our dogs. That's OK, I don't mind waiting, but if my dog wasn't getting cooked, what were you doing back there?. \\n\\nA hot dog should show visible signs of being on a grill. You can taste the grilling marks on a properly grilled dog. This dog was not blemished with any signs of ever having made contact with a grilling surface. The dog had an institutional look, feel and taste, no personality, something that was made worse by the styrofoam container they put it out in. I suppose the styrofoam bin might be helpful when you're heaping chile and cheese all over it, but even McDonald's stopped using styrofoam many years ago.

I'm not going to come back here and waste my hot dog ration on mediocrity. My teenage son thought his dog, covered in chile and cheese, was just great. I bet most of the college kids in the neighborhood think it's great too. At 1:00AM after being out drinking all night they might start to look good to me too, but Simco's is a 10 minute drive at 1:00AM, and they're open late too, and unlike the college kids around here, I have a car.

Instead we stuck around.  There was live jazz and great decor.  Ordered the crabcakes and bacon & grits appretizers.  The crabcakes were excellent.  sliced raw peppers on top gave it some crunch, a slaw and sauce with it provided deep flavors.  The bacon and grits had some heat and too much pepper.  It really wasn't bacon, but rather pork belly with a seared top for a little crunch.  shrimp were in it too.

I love me a good burger.  I've been craving a good, juicy, medium cooked burger since the end of my pregnancy.  So, what better place to go for a burger than to Vortex!  However, Vortex won't allow babies into their bar so I had to find an alternative.  Interestingly enough, I saw a new burger place (Grindhouse) that opened right down the street from us so the hubs, the babes and I decided to try it out.  Well, I liked it!  I would've liked it more if the prices were 50 cents to a dollar cheaper, but I still liked it.  I ordered the yankee burger with onion rings and the hubs had the cowboy burger with crinkle cut fries.  \\n\\nThe yankee burger had sauteed onions, blue cheese spread, lettuce, and bacon.  My favorite burger at Vortex is the blue shroom so I got the yankee to do a little comparison.  I liked the yankee.  The single patty wasn't too big.  It was just enough for me to finish on my own.  The burger was cooked perfectly, medium well and greasy. The blue cheese spread was nice and thick, but not overpowering.  They were generous with the bacon, nice and thick and crispy, just the way I like it.  Overall, I was happy with my burger.  It was no blue shroom, but it hit the spot.\\n\\nI didn't care too much for the onion rings.  I don't know what type of batter they used, but they need to find a new one.  I was expecting a classic, crispy, beer battered onion ring.  Instead, I'm not sure what I got.  It was weird and I didn't like it.  \\n\\nThe hubs had the cowboy burger that had bacon, onion rings, BBQ sauce, and cheddar.  It was pretty good also, however, they didn't evenly spread the BBQ sauce.  The bite I had didn't have any sauce in it.  \\n\\nOur burgers were $6.50 each.  You can make them a combo for an additional $1.99.  Not too bad, but again, it would've been better if they were a little cheaper.  I'll probably go back again.

Sure the mushrooms were bathed in butter and were delicious, but they were the only element to the Funghi pizza. The Maiale had excellent prosciutto. But for $18, the crust cannot be soggy. Since they don't cut your pizza for \\"authenticity\\", perhaps something sharper than a poor serrated butter knife should be provided. Although honestly, there might not be enough room on the table for another knife. I can think of 4 local restaurants with equivalent or better quality pizza - although the prosciutto was delicious.\\nStarters - the Arancini were a neat snack. One bite each. Interesting that the menu uses the plural form, when each order includes only one. I guess that's why the $4 \\"Olive\\" plate uses the singuiar - since it included 4 olives, which were basic. I'd rather load up at the Whole Foods olive bar.\\nSalad - the arugula salad with parmesan was simple, basic, but unevenly dressed and salted. \\nWine by the glass seemed pricey. Beer by the 11 ounce glass was overpriced for Boulder. And only one local beer at a place called Locale?\\nService - our server touched the tings of my wife's fork. Probably because the tables are so tight and small that there's barely any space for maneuvering. Our plates were removed before all had finished the salad course and again before we were all done with pizza. Since the tables are so tight, every service involves jostling or touching your shoulder. Also, there's no room for the waiter to get an angle of approach, so they are  directly behind someone which is awkward.\\nThe space is cool, but very loud.

I can't recall what inspired us to re-visit the restaurant, but we found ourselves there last month.  Not bad, a bit schizophrenic (kinda like their orange color scheme - wow!)\\n\\nThe place was jam packed on a Friday night.  Like, on a cold February evening people-spilling-outside packed.  Risking a decent sized wait, I took a peek in the bar prior to putting our name in.  Each of the tables were full, but there were a few seats directly at the bar.  Cool!  Name goes in, we take one left, a right and we're in the bar.  Bartender's great - friendly, speedy and courteous.  I was moderately impressed with their beer selection, too.  For some reason I was expecting something to the effect of a couple domestic choices, maybe a Hefeweizen and a Dos Equis or Corona.  Nope, they had all of the above, Pacifico, a couple different Deschutes beers and Negro Modelo (I think).  Great!  The bar staff was quick to sling us some chips, salsa, slaw and bean dip, too.  Off to a good start.\\n\\nUnfortunately, after 45 minutes, I checked at the front and they had somehow skipped over my name for a table.  Certainly not a deal breaker, but unfortunate.  The list they keep is literally a pad and paper, which works, I suppose, but they could benefit from some upgraded technology.  No matter, they gave us the next available table.\\n\\nJust like everyone else has said, the menu's huge.  It's Cheesecake Factory big.  It's Claim Jumper big.  It's too big, in my opinion.  My opinion about dinner kinda reflects this.  I chose the chicken fajita enchiladas, and they were fine.  Rice and beans - also \\"fine\\".  Wife described her very basic vegan tacos as fine.  They were all just... rather non-descript.  I wonder if they wouldn't benefit from paring down quite a bit to a smaller selection of things that they're really good at, instead of enchiladas that are just... \\"fine\\".\\n\\nThis all results in a confident 3 star rating from me.

So they seem to be a Latin-American, catch-call restaurant. Their menu included hamburgers, hot dogs, burritos, tacos, tostones, arepas, cuban sandwiches, and others. Their menu looks all over the place with its variety of different Latin American cuisine. \\n\\nI had Arepa Ropa Vieja and Toston Pollo. The Toston dish, as said by the famous yelper, Chie K., reminds me of a pizza. It comes with cheese, meat, and a \\"crust\\". The \\"crust\\" is actually fried plantains. To me, it also reminds me of nachos where the fried plantains are the \\"chips\\" with cheese and meat on top. Also, the fried plantains were multiple pieces instead of one big piece. So you can eat it with your hands. \\n\\nI liked my Toston. The plantains had a nice crunch, and I liked the chicken. It did feel dry though. It came on a huge plate too. Based on the price, I thought it was going to be some dinky thing. I think 1 Toston and a side will fill up most people. \\n\\nThe Arepa comes out looking simliar to the Toston. Instead of having a fried plantain base, it comes with the fried corn base. The Arepa at Tostones Latin Cafe looks even more like a pizza. The Arepa is flattened and rounded, like a pizza crust, and it's topped with the meat. The Arepa tasted fine. The Ropa Vieja had good flavor to it. \\n\\nTheir sides tasted good. It's good as any other Latin American restaurant's side items. Their fried yucca was good and their fried plantians were good too. \\n\\nThe staff seemed friendly, have cheap prices, and they have decent Latin food.

There are no rules about how many selections you can make from a particular category, either-- if you want to eat nothing but fowl and red meat, you can get all three \\"Land\\" options.  Price per person is an incredibly low $35, and one can add an additional selection for an extra 10 bucks. \\n\\nAlthough I haven't tried everything on the menu, I'd be shocked if you could go wrong.

Standing in line is an event! Getting inside is an event! The hip divey pizza parlor vibe is something you have to behold! The employees who are infinitely cooler than you will ever be, but still very nice, given the number of people they have to deal with in a given day are awesome! The donuts are.....ok. I liked the maple bacon donut the best since it's a classic combination, the others seemed like forced novelty. \\n\\nBreakfast cereal on a donut sounds like a good idea, but is there anyone who can eat cap'n crunch without letting it soften in milk at least a little first? I was terrified for the roof of my mouth and my teeth. Some of them, like the cock and balls are funny renditions on classic donuts, but the thing is that they're mostly very sweet and if I'm willing to do without some novelty I can stop at nearly any other donut place on the west coast, (yeah, I had to specify west coast, I don't think NYC would know a decent donut if it slashed their tires), preferably run by vietnamese people and get something better, without standing in line.\\n\\nSo yeah, worth it once, for the novelty, and maybe if you're in the area and want a snack and there's no line then it might also be worth a stop.

There was mixed crowd at lunch, from families with little tykes to slackers with gauges to faux trendy urbanites.\\n\\nOrdered a waffle fry special as an appetizer.   Unfortunately it was brought out with the main order.     Don't any restaurants know the definition of an appetizer anymore?  It was fairly flavorful but the preparer seemed to just toss all the ingredients into the basket rather than attempt to actually place the chiles, cheese and meat on top of the waffle fries.  When I eat out,  I don't like to reassemble my food - that's why I'm not in the back kitchen.\\n\\nI ordered the Hot Polish (isn't that an oxymoron?) Dog but with a Frank Flapjacket (batter covering the innards rather than the typical bun).  Like any jacket donned  by Kirstie Alley it could not cover most of its  filling, resulting in sauerkraut spillage with every bite I took.  And  when I bite into a sausage I prefer one that's big enough to require some effort by my pie hole to engulf it..  That being said, it was relatively tasty and the flapjacket  provided a more interesting outer covering than your typical bun.\\n\\nOverall,  I liked the joint but the makers of Crestor and Lipitor would like it even more since your arteries will ooze with cholesterol after this dining experience."},{"name":"Frank","address":"407 Colorado St","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"This is a sit-down and order restaurant, so we expected more, especially since they took so long to prepare the hotdogs.

They were so meaty, and far from the thin and flat portions that I tend to expect at the price they sell them at.  Additionally, the meat falls right off the bone, but at the same time, the meat is not limp, soggy or rubbery; the perfect combination of tender inside and charred chew on the outside.\\n\\nBut what blew me away was the rub.  There's a tiny bit of heat, a little bit of spice, and not that I'm like that Picard-looking French guy from Sweet Genius that can decipher every flavor on a taste, but there are hints of other spices in there that stand out from typical rib rubs of salts, garlic, onion, cinnamon sugars.  It's clear that it is slathered on from the onset, and that some of it glazes a little bit while being cooked, leaving the end ribs as these marvelous bones with a slight glaze but generous remnants of the rub still on it.\\n\\nBurnt Fork had these four bottles of sauce on the table that were Memphis, Kansas City, and a Carolina-y vinegar as well as a mustard sauce.  I tried them all, and none of them were necessarily bad by any means, but the rub on the ribs was more than enough, and they did not need any sauce by any means.  I'm sure the sauces would go great with briskets and pulled pork, and I'll have a hard time figuring out the best combinations to my preferences because I most certainly will be coming back, but to dare try something other than the ribs is going to be a difficult choice to make.\\n\\nTheir sides I tried were fantastic too.  The fries were like the handcut variety, and they were served slightly soggy which I like, and served as good conduit to soaking up rib juice and errant rub, and what I actually used to try the variety of bbq sauces.  But also good on their own.  Typically, I'm not that big of a mac and cheese fan, but I really did like Burnt Fork's.  Served with gouda and cheddar cheese, it's cooked to where it all congeals together, but also not to where it's baked into a casserole-like consistency.  And by no means is it bland, which is what a lot of places' mac and cheese is, which is why I don't really care for it that often.\\n\\nPrices are fine and more or less pretty much fair.  Given some of the other places in Decatur I like to dine at, I'd say I'm paying about the same if not a hair less.  The establishment is a little tricky to get to, if you're headed north on Church Street, and they did not appear to have a very large amount of parking, but they are also not exactly a large establishment.  Not gripes, but pertinent information.  The interior is clean, and despite being a barbecue joint, it was nice to walk in and not get hit with that wall of melted pig fat musky smell.  And I had absolutely no complaints about the service I received.\\n\\nBottom line is that these are the best ribs I've ever had.  Thank god it's (somewhat) local to me, which means I'm most definitely coming back."},{"name":"Pei Wei","address":"12913 Galleria Cir, Ste 101","city":"Bee Cave","stars":"2","text":"For those of you on a diet (like me), eating here is simply delicious, fast and oh so easy.

Year one was the best but totally unplanned and we sat at the bar. The past two years we reserved tables this year being the earliest (maybe this was problem number one?) \\n\\nWe had a reservation for 5:30 and as usual were seated right away. The view is typically gorgeous but due to weather no one had a view that night except for the random cloud openings which gave a glimpse into what appeared to be Gotham City (very cool looking). Right off the bat we were given the prefixed menu. Once we placed our order the bread came out immediately. Then the soup within a couple minutes. The soup was delicious but the waiter and helpers seemed to be constantly checking in on us to see if we were done. Initially we thought nothing of it but then once our soup was taken up the entree was placed on the table. All of this within the first 15-20 min of sitting. Now maybe if you were looking to eat on the fly that would be great but the purpose of paying ALL this money is to enjoy your time, the food and the atmosphere. During dinner they asked me multiple times if I needed another drink when my glass was still half full but never thought to ask my husband who's glass had been empty for quite some time. After dinner they brought a salad. It came so quickly that I didn't know how I was supposed to start eating again. At this point we decided to just sit and chat a while which was when we began to get annoyed as staff kept asking if we were done. Dessert came and at the end of the meal we were just unhappy with our experience. \\n\\nThe overall issue had nothing to do with the food per say but with the service.

We knew that portions were going to be huge as soon as we picked up the bag... it was HEAVY.\\nWe dug into the sambukas as soon as we got in the car... they were delicious. They come with a small cup of spicy dipping sauce.

Be warned, the meat is intermixed with pieces of bone... but it is so flavorful and so tender! Literally falling-off-the-bone goodness.

Definitely worth a stop after a flight at neighboring Stormbreaker. If you're in a hurry and need to consolidate trips to accomplish both drunkenness and satiation, they have a few tall boys, including HUB's lager.\\n\\nThe burgers are a smidge on the quaint side, as the name implies. Im guessing the \\"big\\" in the name refers to flavor, which I can't really vouch for. In the fast food spectrum they can hold their own until you factor 5 Guys and In 'n Out to which case there really isn't much competition.\\n\\nWe ordered a vegetarian burger for the kiddo. For some reason their vegetarian is spicy. My toddler also thinks lemons and table salt are spicy, but still. I like ghost pepper sauce on my eggs myself, they aren't out of control by any means, but the average person can't handle heat. Thought it was odd they didn't advertise that it has some bite. A part of me appreciates the mentality that not all vegetarian food has to be bland, the other part of me doesn't want to give my kid my hamburger.\\n\\nI'm not sure if the staff is stoned right now, or just very recently, or they are stoned so frequently that their resting face is slack jawed and squinty eyed. Maybe its just a game they play to amuse themselves to get through an entire transaction without saying a single word. I don't want to be the buzz kill to suggest they *not* get stoned at work, I'm just suggesting maybe get stoned then have a Red Bull. This is Portland, you do you.

She chose Coast, and secretly I was glad it was her choice.  Opentable.com app opened and reservation made in less than 5 minutes.  Thank you technology. \\n\\nWe arrived a little early for our 5pm dinner reservation. I didn't realize that the place didn't open until 5, but the staff that was there at 4:40 advised us that we could order a drink, but the kitchen wouldn't open until 5.  \\n\\nWe were seated and placed our drink orders with Laurie.  She brought them to our table and brought my mother a frosted glass for her beer without having to be asked.  I knew then that my mother was going to be pleased, because weather a server knows it or not, that frosted glass thing can reflect BIG on the way my mother tips you.\\n\\nAbout 5 minutes after 5, Laurie came back with the daily \\"specials\\" and also informed us that it was Ladies Night.  Really, at a restaurant.  Okay whatever works.\\n\\nAfter hearing the specials, we placed our appetizer order and within a few minutes later we placed our entree orders.  While it didn't seem a long time for us to receive our appetizers, Laurie thought it had been a while and said she would check on it for us and came back with our crab leg starters, and everything was piping hot and fresh. Just the way I like it.  Maybe that comes from us being the first ones in the restaurant but since I am now a \\"regular\\" here, I haven't had a bad food experience here, so I'm going to keep it moving with saying that the crab legs were delicious and the only thing I would suggest is adding another butter cup to the order, the crab leg starter comes with two clusters of crab legs, 2-3 red potatoes and two corn on the cob nibblers.  That's speaks needs more butter, IMO\\n\\nMy mother chose the Fish of the Day which came steamed in parchment paper and  julienne vegetables with a white wine sauce.  It was beautifully presented and as she tore the parchment paper off, I could see that everything was steamed perfectly.\\n\\nI went with the Fried Seafood basket, and since I've reviewed on that before, I won't go into it again.

I'm one of those person that thinks that my mother can be TOO MUCH, but Laurie was genuine in her talks with us, and that means so much to someone like my mother, who gets a big kick out of people listening to her jokes, and never-ending conversation topics, and taking forever to tell a tale. \\n\\nAs we prepared to wine the dinner down, Laurie came and whispered to me that she was bringing something out to my mother, knowing that my mother had mentioned at least ten times that it was her birthday, I thought it would be some kind of treat, but was pleasantly surprised, when I saw Laurie come out with a \\"very decent\\" size slice of cheesecake topped with strawberries and some kind of drizzle on the plate and a candle all aglow.  Surprised because my mother had made me swear earlier in the week, that I wouldn't buy her a cake because she didn't want to be stuck with all that cake and no one to eat it and normally a restaurant doesn't do this unless you have asked them too, and I think you always need cake on your birthday, this was a way that I was able to keep my promise, and still get my \\"you must eat cake\\" mantra resolved.  Laurie even started out the Happy Birthday song and by now several others had joined us in the dining room and the people at the table next to us started singing along with us.\\n\\nAs we walked back to the valet, my mother gushed that this turned out to be the perfect day, rain and all, and she was so pleased at the effort that had been put into the day.

I am glad I was here with friends and not on a date because I wasn't embarrassed to get a little messy. \\n\\nI think Grindhouse is lost somewhere between 5 Guys and The Counter. They try to be a cool burger place that offers fancy toppings, but in the end they don't have nearly as many options as the counter, and if I wanted a good simple burger I would go to 5 guys (its cheaper). The problem is its not as good as either one of those places in my opinion.

The mention of this to most people evokes the image of a big plate of pasta topped by tomato sauce with giant meatballs sitting atop the mountain.  It's often dusted with Parmesan cheese.  Heck, don't you even remember that song from when you were young:\\n\\n\\"On top of spaghetti....all covered with cheese.  I lost my poor meatball...when somebody sneezed\\"\\n\\nAnyway, if that's what you come to expect when you think Italian food, then you're probably going to be A-OK with Reale's.  The northside definitely has a dearth of italian restaurants, so the GF and I decided to give this one a whirl last night.  Here's my review of what we had:\\n\\nFirst of all, the house Italian dressing could use a little more balance between the oil and vinegar (less oil, more vinegar).  It seemed to be missing some punch, perhaps due to this imbalance.  The salad was your standard iceberg/cherry tomato/onion fare.  Nothing outstanding.  Croutons made from the house-made garlic breadsticks (which were quite delicious) would have been a very welcome addition.  For mains, we went with the family combo, where we were allowed to pick three items from a list of about 10.  We went with the eggplant parm, the lasagna and the spinach ravioli.  The eggplant parm definitely stood out on this plate, with a good flavor and very tasty tomato sauce.  The lasagna was OK (not great), but whatever meat paste they put into it was definitely sub-par.  If only they had gone with a more chunky meat or even some chunks of sausage.  I barely noticed the spinach ravioli.  It was good, but not a superstar that I had hoped it would be.  \\n\\nOK, now how do I reconcile my rating and review?  Honestly, I'm a food snob.  I spent two weeks at cooking school in Sorrento, Italy last year.  I could make an eggplant parm in my sleep and love Italian food.  So I know that I'm coming from a biased opinion.

Pale plum sheers have been added, softening the light and the view of the building across the street. Nice touch. \\n\\nRachel was our server and she rocked. Friendly, hip and full of great recommendations for our first visit. We'll be sure to request her in the future. We started with the butternut squash tortelloni. Oh my. Supersized tortelleni filled with a not too sweet, not too savory butternut squash filling, served in a pool of sage butter sauce. (pic) Cooked perfectly, delish. The bread arrived just after our app and we plowed through the basket of savory garlic bread, toasted perfectly and not overdone. Fresh garlic was not at all overpowering. \\n\\nFor dinner the hubby ordered the lasagna and I went with the linguine with white clam sauce. What to say....YUM!!! The lasagna was a nice portion of layered meat, fresh lasagna pasta sheets, cheese and fresh marinara sauce. Not the typical brick of lasagna that you still feel in your tummy 3 hours after eating, even though it tasted so good going down. I rarely order clam sauce out, as my experiences has been so hit and miss with the quality of the clams in dishes past. Have no fear, shellfish lovers, this linguine with white clam sauce is a dish to order with enthusiasm. A nice portion of perfectly cooked linguine was served in a brothy wine sauce, with a plentiful portion of baby clams still in the shell. The sauce was a great balance of garlic, fresh clams and wine. The small flecks of red chili added a subtle note to the sauce and was not at all spicy. Hubby was envious after a sampling, so I shared my dish. He'll be ordering the linguine on our next visit. \\n\\nHappy Hour is from 5-7, beers are $3 and house wines are $5. The Santa Margherita 120 merlot I had was so-so and I'd definitely go a different direction next time.

The results crushed my foodie heart: I'm allergic to pretty much everything on the planet.\\n\\nThe horrible news: I have to abstain from everything I'm allergic to PLUS sugar, all condiments/dressings, pretty much anything delicious for 4 months.\\n\\nThe good news: hopefully this won't be permanent.\\n\\nThe really sad news: restaurants pretty much = not possible.\\n\\nWELL... not anymore! I went into Not Your Average Joe's with a nervous and heavy heart, feeling awful for asking about accommodations and substitutions and stuff, and I never expected how helpful and kind and accommodating everyone would be.

I was giving up hope. It's been a really hard journey with this road to health,...and the people at this restaurant treated me with such kindness it really touched me. And the food was scrumptious. I'd been here a couple times before I found out I was \\"allergic to Nature\\" as the host jokingly put it after we went over everything (I think that's what I'm going to tell people now! haha), and I can say the steak tips and the burger (with cheese and the bun and all the fixings) were both out of this world.\\n\\nThey also make an effort to use locally sourced ingredients, and they are completely flexible about catering meals to those who struggle with restrictions or just a picky palate. \\n\\nI can't wait until I can (hopefully) start reintroducing some of my favorite foods back into my diet once this hiatus is over.

Let's start at about a month and a half before my birthday. I knew I wanted my guests to have cupcakes at my tea party, but I was not impressed with most of the cupcakeries in Atlanta. I scoured yelp for reviews on cupcake places, and found Sweet Cheats! I hadn't tried their cupcakes yet, but the pictures featured on their website and their facebook page let me know right away that I must have them. It was around this time that an Atlanta venue, which shall remain nameless, informed me that they had double-booked me. So I was now on the hunt for a venue and desserts. I called Shirley, the owner, and she agreed to meet with me to discuss the logistics of my party.\\n I was pleasantly surprised with the location and appearance of Sweet Cheats. It is located directly across from Cabbagetown Park (which has a trail, swings, and a jungle gym for kids), and is nestled into what could be a house. At the tasting, Shirley and her staff were more than accommodating. She was even willing to make a tea flavored cake-pop (cruffle) for my party, which wasn't necessary after all. \\n\\nAnyhow, let's get down to the flavors:\\n\\nRed Velvet: This is not your typical red velvet. Usually I'm not a fan of this flavor because the cream cheese icing tends to be bitter and the cake itself can resemble the taste of chocolate or can be dry. Not so with sweet cheats. The cake is sweet and moist, and the icing is perfect, and never has that grainy texture of some of the cream cheese icings I have had before. (These were the first to go at my party)\\n\\nCr√®me Brulee: YUM! This is the vanilla flavor featured at SC, and it is unbelievable! The flavors are so genuine and rich, yet it's not too sweet. The closest flavor comparison I can give is buttermilk pancakes. \\n\\nLuscious Lemon: Not bitter, not sweet, but just right. This cake-pop was tangy and delicious. Perfect for if you don't want a sugar blast, but still want a treat.\\n\\nHeath Bar Cheesecake: One of the other guest favorites. This dessert is so rich. The mixture of toffee and cheesecake is genius, and is a must-buy at SC.\\n\\nKey Lime: My personal favorite. This cupcake is everything that is good about America. It is sweet, tangy (never bitter, like most key lime pies), and perfectly moist. I believe this is a limited edition flavor, but after trying the cake pop and cupcake, I hope Shirley makes this a permanent flavor.\\n\\nPlease don't waste your time and money going to these generic cupcakeries in Atlanta. Sweet Cheats is the real deal. The staff is friendly, it's never crowded, and it's pleasantly located across from a gorgeous park!"},{"name":"Min-Ga Korean Restaurant","address":"800 Bethel Rd","city":"Columbus","stars":"4","text":"Fried dumplings; tasty, airy fried dough, nice filling, great sauce\\n\\nKimchi dumplings; pretty good, filling was pork and kimchi, served in a light broth with more of that great dumpling sauce on the side\\n\\nSeafood pancake; near perfect, not greasy at all, the batter was fully set, the squid was actually really tender, my only critique is that cheaper baby/salad shrimp were used\\n\\nJapchae; really good, more going on flavor-wise than other japchae I've had\\n\\nBibimbop; good, a little plain due to its simplistic nature but very well executed\\n\\nKalbi; Crazy good, great flavor, impossibly tender.

I tried the triple chocolate penetration, voodoo doll, Portland cream and a couple of others. All of them were wonderful, especially with coffee.

I know that they are not aiming to be the old spaghetti factory, but in Europe the lack of bread served with the main course would not pass. I was lucky enough not to have to wait for a table. I don't think I would wait too long for another chance to eat at this restaurant despite the quality of their dishes. Also I can't help but feel a little bit uncomfortable spending 30 dollars on lunch (pesto gnocchi and a metro-ticket sized piece of lacklustre olive oil cake) while witnessing abject poverty and struggle to survive across the street.

HOWEVER, they offer walk-in seating at the chef's table. it's basically bar seating around the open kitchen.\\n\\nwe arrived at 7:40pm and got seated right away at the chef's table/bar. i loved the view. and because i love food and i love to cook, i obviously love to watch the kitchen at work! what i didn't like was the fact that the server station/kiosk was immediately in front of us at the bar. and i mean, it cuts into the station. so we witnessed some slightly frustrated servers dealing with the lack of kiosks and having to wait to use it. not to mention there was a lack of privacy for us. but hey! that's expected when you sit at the chef's table. no big deal.\\n\\nour server, erin (blonde gradated bob haircut with black-rimmed glasses) was fantastic! awesome, attentive, nice, honest and had some great suggestions. she shared the specials and noted that they were also listed on the menu. \\n\\nwe tasted:\\n1. salmon chips appetizer. yummy! had it before and wanted boyfriend to try it. he's not a fan of salmon, in general, but loved it! 4 big slices of potato chips slathered with a creamy cheese spread (i think), topped with some dee-lish smoked salmon, capers and red onion. boyfriend loved it! $9\\n2. wild boar ravioli. erin warned me that it was rich in taste. and it was. not your traditional ravioli. looked like big wonton wrapper filled with pureed shredded meat, sliced carrots, corn, and rich parmasan (?) cheese. lots of fresh cheese. then folded in half and cooked. topped with cooked greens, mushrooms, cheese. two of them served. each one served was about the size of my hand. $12.\\n3. beef brisket. served with slices of apple and mashed potatoes. not the best mashed potatoes i've had. and i love mashed potatoes. not special. i only ate one small bite of that. the brisket good, but not fantastic. a bit chewy actually. i personally love my friend's home-smoked brisket better. $20\\n4. ciabatta bread dipped in balsamic and olive oil. soft, fresh and tasty.\\n5. pumpkin bread pudding. served with a very small scoop of white chocolate chip ice cream. and some chocolate cookie crumbles. good. $7\\n\\nand i must not fail to mention the amazing ambiance and decor. love the design. the place was buzzing!  music was good that night but i prefer their blues and jazz bands. we stayed for about 2 hrs. overall, we had a great night there. the staff was wonderful, kind and attentive.\\n\\nmust try it! great date night. great for groups as well! but make sure to make a reservation days in advance. it's a great experience to sit at a table. the chef's table and the drinking bar is great too!"},{"name":"Anchovies","address":"433 Columbus Ave","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"The food was awful.

You will pay North End prices, but in general get more generous portions.\\n\\nI came here for the first time tonight with a friend. We had made a reservation late on a Tuesday evening but it wasn't necessary with the indoor and outdoor seating. Ordered the Fusilli Amalfi and Veal Toscana (each $18) as well as the Arancini appetizer ($6). The Arancini balls were huge and delicious although the risotto could have been more flavorful inside and the peas didn't quite go with it. The Fusilli was out of this world and a major difference between here and the North End is THEY DON'T SKIMP ON THE SEAFOOD! At least 13 pieces of fresh seafood total (including 3 lobster claws!) tossed in the most wonderful fusilli I've ever had in the area - completely in heaven. I highly recommend their white garlic sauce. The Veal proved that they don't skimp on the meat portions either and the sauce on that dish was excellent.\\n\\nIf my grad-student-paid wallet could handle this more often, I would be back at least once a month.

So I would suggest coming at a less traditional time especially if you have a bigger party. Also, they might seat you with other parties since they are trying to make the most efficient use of their space. Trust me, no seat goes untaken. \\n\\nThe ramen broth is like no other. I normally order the shoyu ramen, egg and karaaage (not sure if I'm spelling that correctly but it's the fried chicken). I think the combo is a very good economical option as it is only $15.

We ordered a few ceviche dishes and my goodness, it was like an explosion of flavors in your mouth, I had a tough time sharing these! On a side note, I absolutely loved the presentation of each dish, you could tell the chef took great pride in his work. Every dish was Instagram worthy! Moving on, the Patatas were incredible. Roasted potatoes with three dipping sauces, which were all great. I nearly licked the plate clean. The ACELGAS empanada was so good, we ended up ordering 2-3 dishes. PALTA RELLENA DE CANGREJO was also excellent, nice ripe, juicy avocado and tasty fresh crab meat on top. I tried my gf's ARROZ CON MARISCOS and was very pleased how the rice tasted. Sometimes you order rice dishes and the rice is dry and nasty, but this rice was cooked just right and there was a ton of scallops, shrimp and mussels in the dish. I never order paella, as it's almost always all rice and not even that good, this dish was excellent.

The food, ambience, service, and maybe partly being on vacation helped with it too...\\n\\nI had planned a trip to Portland a couple months ago, and had heard about this place from a friend. I made a reservation for 2 at 6 p.m. on a Saturday, knowing that we would be shopping beforehand and would be hungry early. \\n\\nWe were seated in the main dining room, and there were a few tables already filled. Our server was AMAZING. She was sooo helpful and enthusiastic about the food and giving us recommendations - she is probably the reason I am giving this place 5 stars. \\n\\nBetween my friend and I, we decided to do a tapas style dinner and ordered:\\n\\n- Chorizo\\n- Stuffed sweet piquillo peppers: very flavorful - the sweetness of the peppers complimented the saltiness of the ham very well. One of my favorite dishes of the night.\\n- Filet mignon tatare: Good, but just your average beef tartare.\\n- Duet of smoked fish: this was probably my least favorite dish. One was a trout (can't remember the other) and it was cold, which I thought was odd. I also thought both fishes were overly smoked. \\n- Grilled diver scallop: Scallops were cooked very well, and I loved the brown sugar butter sauce it was cooked in. The onions were OK - I thought it could do without them. \\n- Ceviche \\"5 elementos\\": Also another one of my favorite dishes. If you love ceviche, definitely get this!\\n\\nTotal was ~$100 before tip. I also ordered a glass of the sangria and my friend had a glass of wine. I wish California had the luxury of paying no taxes... \\n\\nWill definitely come back again whenever I'm in Portland!

We ordered around 4:45 and the first item didn't come out until 5:30. The item that came out was a pizza and not our appetizers, the rest of the food wouldn't be done for another 20 minutes. Does it really take over an hour to make a cheeseburger, tater tots, soup, and a salad? A friend and I ate our pizza because we were starving, but our other friend literally didn't get to eat at all, as her food came out too late. No waiter came to our table to apologize for the wait as we watched the tables around us receive their food even though they had arrived after us. By the time the rest of our food was done, we had already eaten what we wanted of the pizza, and we needed to be leaving as we had somewhere to be. So we declined to take the other food, paid for our pizza, and left. \\n\\nTheir excuse for the pizza coming out at a different time was that it was from a different kitchen, which we understand, but why did it take over an hour to make our other food, and what restaurants allow the main dish to be put out before the appetizers?

Then another person came over with these small pieces of Kobe beef on purple potato puree with some cream sauce. Our server explained it was \\"a gift from the kitchen\\". I have a feeling it was because of our delayed seating time, which really wasn't an issue but the small bite was SO good and appreciated :)\\nOur small plates came and they were equally devine. The empanadas are a MUST HAVE. they are dusted with powered sugar and served with a red onion/ tomato salad. I could've eaten 5, no joke. The stuffed avocado was fresh and palate cleansing.\\n\\nFor our main course my mom got the special of skirt beef with a mushroom risotto, topped with asparagus and tomato salsa. The sauce across the beef was spicy and complex. The meet was cooked to perfection.\\nMy entree was the quinoa crusted scallops. Three perfect little scallops on top of their own little bed of pureed potato and sauteed spinach.

Parking is tough, even on a weekday night. There was a cop stationed at the lot when we were there, and he blocked off the entrance with cones so we knew there were no more spots. Luckily, you could probably find street parking easily.\\n\\nThis place is massive. Just massive. It doesn't look that huge from the outside, but the restaurant is made of many large dining rooms. I will also say that from the outside, I expected it to look kind of dingy on the inside, but it's not. I promise.

And you have lots of people to eat with.\\n\\nOur server was Brooklyn, and he had a great sense of humor and rolled with the punches. He found out it was our first visit here, so he brought us all samples of the Pot Likker with cornbread. Delicious, never had that before. We also received a basket of cinnamon rolls (OMG YUM), yeast rolls and more cornbread.\\n\\nWe placed our order via actual order form slips, which was unique. I got the roast turkey with cranberry, cornbread dressing, gravy, plus fried green tomatoes and mac & cheese for my sides. \\n\\nThe food came out in a reasonable amount of time. I will say I found the gravy a tad salty, so I scraped a lot of it off. The cranberry sauce came from the can, I think, but I don't really care about that personally. Mac & cheese was decent, though not the best I have had. I think the noodles were too overcooked and it had a lot of ricotta(?) or something mushy in it. Fried green tomatoes were excellent and came with a dipping sauce. I also sampled Fiance's chicken fried chicken and it was MM MM GOOD. Yeah, I said it.\\n\\nI was way too stuffed for dessert, but Brooklyn talked us into it. We got the key lime pie and pecan pie. The key lime was most definitely the better of the two... that crust!

There was just something about it... maybe too much pecans in comparison to the sweet filling.\\n\\nEven though I didn't absolutely love everything I tried, I still think it was a five star experience and we plan to make the most of our time in Midtown and come back many more times!

As a single traveler w/ a nearly five year old in tow, obviously the bar and the theater which, for whatever reason didn't allow children in the late evening, were off limits.  Of course, on the one night of our stay, I had just endured the scariest drive of my life from Portland to the Oregon Vortex in Gold Hills and back again so I was in no mood to do anything but to stay on flat land and to not see another tractor trailer for at least a couple of hours until our drive to Seattle the next morning.\\n\\nThe best thing about the Kennedy School is the absolutely sweet neighborhood in which it is located. If I were to move to Portland, this is where I would live. Quaint houses, tree-lined streets w/ sidewalks, a friendly, progressive vibe, and lots of stuff in walking distance including an organic grocery store where we picked up enough crap to tide us over until morning since even the restaurant in this place doesn't seem to be very child friendly after 5pm. \\n\\nWith its spacious maze of art filled hallways perfect for roaming and abundance of blackboards and free chalk, my daughter loved the place. Unfortunately, she kicks in her sleep and rooms in the Kennedy School are only available with single queen beds with lumpy, rock like pillows. Fortunately, even if you were to turn on every light in the room, it would still be dim - great for sleep, not so much for anything else like reading any of a vast selection of books available in each room. We stayed in the \\"Crooked Room\\" (oft neglected nursery rhyme) and had a whole wall of huge picture windows blocked by equally huge hedges so that while the only thing visible to me was sky, my disrobing body remained invisible to any would be intrusion from foreign eyes.

Even the pollo places give you twice as much and free tortillas, amongst other things.\\n\\nI can usually get 4 meals for the same amount of money at one of the other Latin chicken places. This one gave me about 1 1/2. Combine that with a fair amount of waiting at the drive thru, and I'm not sure I'll drive out of my way again soon.

They give you pitchers of sweet tea instead of water, and they also had unsweetened tea for those who are a little more health conscious. And water if you want water. I also ordered the Georgia peach cobbler, which was good, but I was way too full to finish.

The place wasn't THAT busy. And a beer takes about 5 seconds to crack and bring over. I didn't get to enjoy my burger with a beer, as I'd hoped. It took another 5-10 minutes after our waitress came over before the beer and cocktail arrived and we were pretty much done with our dinner.

It took me a while to try it out. After sampling a large portion of the menu items, I can say that I enjoyed the experience, but I'm not dying to go back. The atmosphere is great. The food just didn't wow me.\\n\\nWhile the tables-crammed-into-a-warehouse-surrounding-open-kitchen concept is awesome, it made for an incredibly loud dining experience. That's not a big deal in itself. Spread around a giant booth, however, my party-of-three did quite a bit of yelling. What was also weird was the service. Everyone was very nice and friendly, but it was oddly paced. We ordered some appetizers to start, and within seconds, we had an overload of food on the table. It made me nervous - we were out for my boyfriend's birthday and were looking for a relaxing experience, not fast food! Later, we wanted to order more drinks and entrees. Our servers were nowhere to be found. The pacing of the meal was way off. I'm not one to nitpick about service, trust me. Things have to feel really weird for me to notice or comment.\\n\\nI was designated driver so birthday boy could get his booze on, and I tried just one of their cocktails. I can't remember or find the name, but it was the first one on the list: two to tango, or something? I liked it, even if it tasted strongly of tequila.\\n\\nNow on to the reason we really dine out: the food! I liked it. But it felt very generic to me, like the kind of food you can find at any contemporary American spot in Midtown.\\n\\nHere's the rundown...\\n- Salmon chips appetizer: served on a fried slice of potato, cut lengthwise. Tasty but a little bland.\\n- Tuna tartare appetizer: also served on the fried potato chip. One of my favorites of the night, even if some of the serrano chunks were overwhelming.\\n- Empanadas appetizer: loved the brisket inside, even if the pastries were overloaded by pico de gallo and feta cheese piled on top. Pretty tasty.\\n- Mussels appetizer: Served in a pot with accompanying delicious, hot, steamy ciabatta bread. Some were a little fishy-tasting, and the broth had a bitter flavor note that I didn't care for. I thought it may have been from the Swiss chard.\\n- Bronzed scallops entree: cooked to perfection, which means perfectly seared outside with a rare and creamy interior. The accompanying gouda grits and smoked tomato broth were tasty. Only issue was... there were three scallops on the plate. Three. That's not an entree- that's an appetizer.\\n- Bistro steak: Really good. I don't know what cut of meat they used, but it was perfectly tender and they nailed the medium-rare. \\n- Coconut mousse cake: Layered coconut cream with flaky pastry, like a baby Napoleon. Fine, nothing special.\\n\\nSo overall, the experience was fine, and a worthy birthday meal destination. But I don't feel the urge to hurry back for another meal there."},{"name":"Eastern Pearl","address":"2959 Vineland Rd","city":"Kissimmee","stars":"2","text":"I hesitate even reviewing so as to give it 1 star. \\nOrdered via the EA24 app at 10:15 p.m. (no knocking the app. It is wonderful.)\\nEta was given for 45 minutes. \\nWhen that passed, I contacted EAT24.

Had it been another day or time, then this review would probably have been quite different and I acknowledge that. \\n\\nThe story:\\n\\nI pulled up to the back patio of two urban licks on my bike (from the beltline) to meet family for Easter Brunch. I did not immediately see a place to lock up my bike, so I rested my bike on the edge of the deck in order to check if the front of the restaurant had anything suitable to lock up my bike.  Before I had a chance to look I was accosted by a manager who was fussing about not locking up my bike there. (he said he was a manager - i have my doubts from his immaturity)\\n\\nOkay - first of all - I would not lock up my bike at this location as there was nothing to lock my bike to. Second of all, if you're on the beltline, you should have a bike rack. period.\\n\\nI asked the manager where I was supposed to lock up my bike - not in a sarcastic way, but just merely asking where the designated spot for locking bikes was located. It had not even crossed my mind that a place on the beltline, with a path from the back patio to the beltline would not have a place to lock up a bike. He took this question to mean I was back-talking and the conversation only got worse.  He proposed I lock my bike to an 8\\" wide wooden rail (which my researched, carefully selected bike lock would not fit around) then he suggested i lock it to a sign pole that was about 4 feet tall with nothing on the top of it - someone could just pick up the bike, with lock attached, and walk away with it. It was clear this guy did not have a bike worth anything -- so I recommended they get a bike rack. i began to walk away, in order to find a suitable rack somewhere else so I could walk back, when this manager continued to berate me for my decision not to lock my bike up to these insecure locations. okay, now I'm frustrated, because not only is this place irresponsible for not having a bike rack, but they are mocking me for trying to be responsible with my bike. I am responsible with my bike and will not rely on others to watch it for me as I do not expect them to pay the $2,000 for my bike when it is stolen. I told the manager that he didn't need to be a d**k about this whole thing (which i should not have done- but this guy was arrogant and his recommendations were counter productive and stupid and I was getting pissed off at him and his smug attitude and his lack of knowledge and respect). to which he told me I was not welcomed. \\n\\nSo needless to say I did not try the food. The family waiting inside came out to the back patio to say hello to us. We then left - not having eaten or spent time with family.\\n\\nI don't think I want to repeat this experience.\\n\\nAt least I was able to tell people leaving the restaurant about my encounter while we were waiting for our family to come out. word. of. mouth."},{"name":"De Novo","address":"201 S High St","city":"Columbus","stars":"3.5","text":"We were really looking forward to trying De Novo but were ultimately disappointed with our experience.

Makes it hard to meet up with someone unless you want to stand in the rain. So props for Wifi. \\n\\nWe ended up at the Boiler Room and had a few beers each. And the soft pretzels. They made a mistake with the order but were ingratiating and apologetic about it. We did have to ask for our check in order to get to the movie on time but it was a pretty pleasant cozy experience overall. I thought the prices were kinda high for a middle class kinda person and a moderate experience. The beers were just okay, nothing stellar and I dropped $30. Idk, I'm not mad or anything but I don't feel that was a great value. I had the Purple Haze, it was pretty pleasant. I'd prefer a happy hour menu and prices. That woulda solved it. \\n\\nThe theater offered a ton of seating options: single seats, easy chairs, loveseats, couches along with peppered tables for holding the beers (or what have you). The sound and picture were alright, nothing stellar but they did the job. Water is avail in the auditorium and they deliver food to your seats which could be distracting to some but didn't bother me. \\n\\nThe seats were so comfy (and the beer so delectable) I SLEPT THRU HALF THE DAMN MOVIE. Ha! I mean, whose fault is that? Curse you for making me so comfortable! I always thought the Spanish Inquisition Comfy Chair was an empty threat. But never underestimate the power of a comfy chair. And beer. Is this what the rest of my life will be? Sleeping through movies that start at 8pm? :D\\n\\nTicket prices are $4 and that felt fair. \\n\\nDef a sweet little historic spot to bring out-of-towners that shows the flair of Portland and our weirdness. I don't know if I'll hurry back since it's such a trek from my place but if I were in the neighborhood, I'd def consider it. It's a solid option and a cool place if you've never been! \\n\\nIf you're unsure you'll dig it, come during happy hour and save some $$.\\n\\nAnd as a random aside, it didn't have the same creepy feel the Grand Lodge did out in Forest Grove. It felt wholesome and quirky, earnest...without being as dark and somber (grim, even) as Grand Lodge. So I prefer the energy here for sure. Different sides of the \\"serious\\" coin."},{"name":"Two Urban Licks","address":"820 Ralph McGill Blvd NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"I came here a couple months ago with my boyfriend expecting great food and was pretty disappointed.  On the upside the location and ambiance are great.  It is basically an old warehouse right on the Beltline.  From the outside it doesn't look like much, but the inside is huge, beautifully decorated and all and all just a really cool space.   Drinks are pretty good here as well.  We ordered the salmon on chips, seafood boil and the duck with fried rice.  I love pretty much any type of smoked fish but the salmon appetizer was reminiscent of cat food.  The texture was off and the smokiness was over-powering to the point of being unappetizing.   For the duck dish the duck was cold and poorly executed as it was over-cooked with flabby skin.  The fried rice tasted like something you might get in a frozen entree and I can make much better fried rice at home.  The seafood boil was, again, kind of cold but was reasonably tasty.  I was pretty annoyed that the meal was so lame because I really wanted to like this place considering I always hear people rave about it.

I went last week and had such a good time, i went again today.\\n\\nWent in last week for a business lunch (as usual) and we were seated pretty much right away. It was 11:30 in the morning and the place was already hopping. We were placed at a banquette, which means we were pretty close to our neighbors, but not enough so that it was weird or uncomfortable. The atmosphere is fun and laid back, but that doesn't mean you feel like you're at Denny's. The whole front of the restaurant is huge windows; combined with the high ceiling you've got plenty of natural light. They have a chic little Florida room off to the side with a fireplace. The coup d'resistance is the pink Cadillac behind glass. The whole place is clean and well-situated.\\n\\nI've got to congratulate them on their staff. I called for directions and they were friendly and accurate. Our server (pretty redhead, I'm so sorry I can't remember her name!) on our first trip was fantastic. All the servers are neat as a pin and do a great job. \\n\\nOkay let's talk food. Go hungry. Go starving. The prices are a little higher ($10-$15 per person, on average) but the portion sizes are HUGE. Plan to leave with leftovers or split with a friend. I'd also like to give kudos to Beth O. for pointing out that Cadillac is veghead-friendly. YAY! \\n\\nCadillac is located in that funky little neighborhood (Irvington?) north of the Lloyd Center Mall. They don't have their own lot so plan to gamble on street parking, or just hoof it. You'll need to walk off some of your enormous, insanely delicious lunch.

Our party had a selection of dishes, the haddock with red sauce, the fusilli-marinara (with seafood), a seafood fra diavolo, shrimp with papardelli in white wine-garlic sauce, and some salad starters. Overall mediocre. The salad was standard, goat cheese-greens-walnuts, but the balsamic dressing was gluey and overly mustardy. The walnuts were not toasted, just thrown on and added little. For the main courses the fra diavolo and fusilli were good, but not stand outs by any means, just the most palatable of the dishes ordered. A good selection of seafood, but nothing you couldnt do at home with a jar of decent marinara. The haddock was too be blunt, gross. Think fish sticks but mushy. I regretted tasting it. The white wine garlic sauce was limp and overly garlicked--no depth of flavor, poorly seasoned and I think the word wine was gently whispered over the pan. The pasta was a bit mushy, and probably sitting in the kitchen precooked before going on the plate. The wine menu was priced well and offered a nice regional selection but the quality of the two wines we selected (a Sangiovese and a Chianti) was unfortunately commensurate. The service though was excellent, and that along with the moderate price and acceptable marina dishes saved it from being a 1-2 star rating.

It was about 8 pm and there were about 2 other tables of people in the whole restaurant. What can I expect for the neighborhood, right?\\n\\nAnyway, we were whisked to a table near the windows (for a great view of Buford Hwy! haha) and a friendly man with a thick Hispanic accent took our orders for water and gave us time to peruse the menu. I was tempted by the plethora of Latin cuisine, like arepas (Colombian, rather than Venezuelan, corn cakes), tostones (fried plantains), maicitos (corn dish), Latin-style hamburgers and hot dogs, and tortas. Ultimately, I settled on the ajiaco, a hearty, Colombian chicken soup, since the website claimed that it was only available on the weekends. My sister-in-law went with the same choice.\\n\\nWe did not wait long before huge bowls of soup with chunks of different potatoes and corn came out. The nice server brought us creme fraiche/sour cream and capers to stir in. I was light-handed with the cream, but only because I watch what I eat. The soup was wonderful, but what really surprised us was when he brought us out plates with white rice, tomato/lettuce salad, and avocados to accompany our soup. When I eyeballed the extra sides, I had to convince myself that I could not eat everything. I managed to eat half the rice, but the avocado slices all went down.\\n\\nI wish the place was livelier (but alas, this is not Miami and the Hispanic community here has a slightly different culture) but the food is worth returning for. We both vowed that we'd come back, most likely to try the arepas and tostones."},{"name":"Mary Mac's Tea Room","address":"224 Ponce De Leon Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Definitely one of the best experiences for food and relaxing in the ATL!

So we parked around the corner and made a short walk to a long line.  Amazingly John himself quickly came up to offer us a couple of Lone Stars.  It was a bit chilly this morning, but a cold beer really helped the wait in line. \\n\\nAs we waited, we scanned the handwritten menu and noted that a few things were already crossed off - sadly none of the handmade beef sausages were available, along with pork shoulder and the pork ribs.  As we neared the front of the line, the fellow with the evil black marker appeared again and we held our breaths to see what fate would fall - gladly though pork ribs were added back to the menu.  The BBQ gods were kind.\\n\\nWe ordered a brisket, pork ribs, turkey and beef ribs (I naively thought to order a few and then rapidly realized that each rib was HUGE and defaulted back to one).  An order of potato salad and chipotle cole slaw helped to round out the meal.\\n\\nOur brisket was delicious with an amazing bark of salt and pepper crusted around it.  The turkey was moist and flavorful.  The St. Louis style pork ribs were fantastic and a contrast to the beef ribs which were so tender that the meat just fell off the bones.  The potato salad was great and the cole slaw had great chipotle flavor but lacked the spiciness  that I would have expected.\\n\\nSeating outside consists of about 7ish tables and they have a little area for a band to play as well.

Something with Hendricks Gin and something else I forget, but it was so sour it was undrinkable. The waitress was not accomodating about it, she seemed annoyed that I was sending it back and I did not appreciate her lack of customer service. At a nice place like this with very high prices, I expect to be treated graciously. I have been a waiter before and know that one server can't reflect on the whole restaurant, so I cant knock the Rossi too much because of one waitress, and in fact there was another bartender or waitress who brought some stuff to our table, and she was very nice and cool with some bright red lipstick.

I was only able to get one bite, but it was sensational. Just looking from the name, it sounds as if it was drenched in hot buffalo sauce, but far from it. It was coated with a light batter that consisted of the buffalo and caribbean spices. The sauce itself had a mildly sweet and a tangy finish to it. The chicken was juicy and fresh. Normally this kind of sports bar slash restaurants use chickens that are not organic.

I find the fresh garlic option amazing it's freshly minced at the table. They bring a jar of fresh garlic cloves out with a mincer, which you mince yourself, I found that pretty neat. We also had the fried chicken appetizer which was nice and crispy, but pretty fatty. Makes since considering it is the thigh rather than breast meat.

I turned to Yelp for guidance and it didn't let me down. I've traveled around Peru and have yet to find food in the states that does justice to the flavors of Peru, until now... \\n\\nI'm a huge fan of tapas. It gives you the chance to try lots of different things and in a place like Andina that's a very good thing. The menu is filled with amazing dishes and while the small \\"appetizer\\" sizes help to overcome any fear of commitment, the number of mouth watering dishes on the menu poses another challenge. Which to order first...\\n\\nBeing that it was a hot afternoon I opted for the Quinotto \\"chisaya mama\\". It was light, refreshing and an explosion of favors to wake up my palate. I loved the tenderness of the quinoa, the layers of flavor from the fresh vegetables, the the slight woodiness of the mushrooms and the bold flavor from the bits of Grana Padano cheese. Nicely washed down with an ice cold Peruvian beer.\\n\\nMoving on to the meatier options, I ordered the marinated beef heart kebobs. I really fell for these last time I was in Lima and Andina does it just right. Perfectly tender, juicy and really scratches that carnivorous itch. \\n\\nNot full but pleasantly sated I lingered at the bar where I was having my meal and listened to the live performance of a solo guitarist singing passionately in Spanish. Not fully grasping all the words I could hear the emotion in his voice as he sang. Very entrancing.\\n\\nHappily contented I couldn't resist just one more dish before leaving. The Pisco Sour I ordered was kicking in nicely and octopus seemed just the thing. The grilled octopus kebobs with chimichurri sauce were the best I've ever had. There were some meaty pieces of octopus for a skewer and cooked to perfection. Amazingly tender and the chimichurri sauce complimented it exquisitely without stealing the show.\\n\\nComfortably full I lamented that I was only going to be in town for three days and there were too many other great places to try to make it back to Andina on this trip. But it has been permanently etched into my very short list of favorite restaurants and it will not be long before I find another excuse to make the trip back to Oregon for seconds."},{"name":"Via 313 Pizza - West 6th","address":"600 W 6th St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"SO SO yummy!

Last night I decided on Alana's. \\nNestled in a Victorian house near the University, Alana's has a great seasonal menu and a large selection of wine - you may purchase bottles at the state minimum prices and drink it there for a $5 corkage fee. \\nAfter being seated I think I went a little crazy ordering a glass of wine, appetizer, salad and dessert. I said I was hungry. \\nThe wine was a very nice Argentinian Malbec, one of my favorites. Appetizer was a to-die for set of fried chevre' and leek cakes on a bed of beluga lentils. I could have eaten a plate of those lentils by themselves. The salad was made with julienne apples and almonds. It wasn't anything to write home about but the portion was pretty large for salad. For the entree I chose the butternut squash risotto. It was divine and the portion was enough for last night's dinner and today's lunch. Of course I saved room for dessert - the best part by far was the orange pound cake with a heaping scoop of salty caramel ice cream. Oh my... \\nService was faultless. My waiter, Courtney, was no neophyte. \\nThe bill came in at $58 and change - quite reasonable for a four course meal of that quality. \\nMy only constructive feedback would be the decor. Based on other reviewers' comments, I was curious to see for myself. The place is just a mess. If you just sat down without looking at a menu you would think you were in a Mexican cantina. The walls are sponged an orange color and the art (for sale) was just bizarre - alligators and little green, yellow and orange people painted on copper plates. The chairs are uncomfortable - kind of like ones you would see in a 1970's board room. The plates and cups are knock-off fiesta ware in a smattering of colors.

We went on a Wednesday night, and the restaurant was relatively empty.  We started out with a couple cocktails and were having a really good time so we didn't even notice how long it was taking for our food.  (I ordered a pizza and my date had the lamp lollipop appetizer.) After a bit we notice the table that came in after us had already eaten and paid for their food while we hadn't received our yet.  When we asked, the waitress explained the kitchen lost our ticket, and then the manager came over to apologize and she told us they would be coming our entire meal.  Mistakes happen, and they went above and beyond to correct it. Had I written this review after that experience it would have been 5 stars.\\n\\nWent back last night, and this is where it went downhill.  For our appetizers our friends ordered a salad and we ordered the pork belly appetizer.  For the mains we had two pizzas and a burger.  The waitress comes out with our pizzas and the burger to explain that the kitchen messed up & our appetizers would be out shortly.  Fifteen minutes later we had to ask the waitress if our appetizers would be out soon.  My fianc√©e had to wait about 15 minutes for his martini.\\n\\nWhen we finally got the duck appetizer it was very good, but our pizza was not.  We ordered the margarita pizza, which was very bland and dry (no sauce, only olive oil).  We eventually asked for a side of pizza sauce which she quickly brought out, but it tasted more like cocktail sauce than pizza sauce.  \\n\\nOur friend didn't want much of his salad after he had already eaten his burger and fries.  \\n\\nMaybe it is a fluke that the only two times I go to eat the kitchen messes up our order...maybe the waitresses were blaming the kitchen for their mistakes.   Maybe if they had offered to comp a round of drinks I wouldn't have been as annoyed, but we spent $85 on a dry pizza, a duck appetizer and a couple martinis.  \\n\\nMaybe we will go back....but not likely."},{"name":"Top of the Hub","address":"800 Boylston St, Ste 52","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"We were in town for only one night on our way up to Canada, and honestly the only reason I chose the Hub was because it was the most booked restaurant in Boston on Open Table that week.\\n\\nWould have been a fantastic view if it had been clear (definately a summer destination), the food was expensive but ok...

And it's starting to grow on me. Actually it grew on me a lot. I prefer this place to Willy's now. \\n\\nWhy? The meats taste slightly better. I love their pork. Also, they serve steamed rice with their burrito (although I doubt it's healthier for you, they probably use a ton of salt in their steamed rice). Some people hate the rice, I love the rice because I'm Asian.\\n\\nThey also give a choice between fajita style or beans style. I always choose fajita because I don't like to fart too much. And they have corn as a stuffing item. That also gives it an interesting taste and texture. Also, make sure to pay extra to get the guacamole in your burrito.

I hadn't been to voodoo in a long long time and wasn't impressed the first time around so I figured why not check it out. Fact is EVERYONE seems to be all about voodoo doughnuts. I was with my family, 3 small children my SO and myself and my SO just had to go and check it out and buy a doughnut. Well we got a doughnut each, I got a lemon filled doughnut, my kids got the most sugary eye catching ones they could find and my SO got 2 one bacon something and one I can't remember. I am not a sweets person as it is so when I do get a doughnut it's usually one of three types for me le.on, Apple fritter, or a twist, and mostly my choice depends on how much sweet I think I can handle at the moment. This day it was a lemon filled and it was ok. Not the best I'd ever had but acceptable as far as lemon filled doughnuts go. Would I run all the way downtown fighting ridiculous traffic and paying to park in some lot or on the street for it? NO. My daughter got a bubblegum doughnut because well it was pink AND had a piece of pink bubblegum plopped in the center. I tried to talk he out of it knowing color and a piece of what resembled the kind of gum you get from a pin√£ta don't necessarily mean a yummy doughnut but trying to reason with a 4yr old isn't exactly an easy feat when gum and the favorite color are involved.

From the moment we walked in, this place felt very cozy and comforting...almost like you were walking into the neighborhood bar that you've been going to for years. We were the largest party, so we were sat front and center in the restaurant. Here is where things get REALLY good. Our server was \\"Lola\\", and you couldn't write a script for a better character than what she is in REAL LIFE. Poor Calvin's needs to hold on to Lola forever, because she is making the dining experience THAT MUCH BETTER. She was not only very welcoming and FUNNY, but she was very well versed on the menu. Per her suggestion, my table had a variety of appetizers including Lobster Wontons topped with caviar, Lobster Mac N Cheese, Corn Dip, Fried Green Tomatoes, and Frog Legs. Nothing was bad...EVERYTHING WAS DELICIOUS....I was very skeptical about the caviar, but it was AMAZING with the Lobster Wontons. The corn dip was especially delicious. The Chef's Special yesterday was Trout served with Risotto and a Lobster Fritter. It was DIVINE! The cocktail menu is also very good. While I didn't partake, my friends raved about them, especially the Hennessey with grapes and brown sugar (the name escapes me). Needless to say, Poor Calvin's WILL be a staple on my restaurant Go-To list. I'm already planning a Brunch outing....I hear the Crab Meat Grilled Cheese sandwich is heaven on earth!!!!! Definitely make a reservation! This place is popular, but not big AT ALL. There could easily be a wait. Also, parking is not great, but such is life in this city. I would use Lyft if you don't live too far."},{"name":"Launderette","address":"2115 Holly St","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Solid food with lackluster service.

Our waiter was patient with us and we got our food fast and it was steaming hot. He was just a little slow checking back on us and we needed extra napkins and another set of silverware. And there was the issue of them not being able to split the check for a party over 4, that others mentioned. I knew about it so I was prepared but it it was still a pain. I had the bbq ribs, which were very good. Others at my table had the chicken and waffles and lobster and grits. Everyone enjoyed their dishes and the music playing was a nice touch. I only have 1 complaint. My 25 year old son met us there. We were already inside and seated. When I went to meet him at the door, I saw he was being patted down. Really? At a restaurant? It was not at night when it the place becomes a cub. It was 6:30 in the evening! Ok, I can understand if they feel a need to do that for security reasons BUT when we got there my husband was not padded down. So they pick and choose? I felt this was discriminatory.

It was very bland and the cheese wasn't melted to perfection - it just sort of sat on top of the sauce, if that makes any sense.
