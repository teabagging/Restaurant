However, it was slighty disorganized, but considering it was their first official day, that was expected.

We had the classic coldcut (if you are having a banh mi, you gotta try the original first and foremost in my books) and the bbq pork with kimchi.  The classic was filled with meaty goodness, but unfortunately the flavor in the pickled daikon and carrots was non-existent, big nono for me because I absolutely LOVE the pickled veggies that go on the sub.  Pate was great tho!  The bbq pork with kimchi was so flavourful - would love to have another one of those.\\n\\nThe baguette itself was a little too hard for my liking.  Not sure if it was because it wasn't fresh when I went or what the deal was.  It was also very skinny... which looked weird to me.  I prefer the traditional crusty baguette (hey, if it ain't broke, don't fix it).\\n\\nI would like to think that I would return.  At any rate, I am glad that I tried.

Our wait time was about a hour, so we headed down the street to a wine shop to kill the time, the bar inside Bakersfield didn't have any space.  I will still rave all over the guacamole, but now I'm chanting the praises of the Queso with Chorizo, seriously.  This isn't the cheap queso you find at other mexican places, it's legit the real stuff.  We both ordered 3 tacos, and devoured them quickly.  Our waiter (Ty) was amazing, it was a busy night and he had a handle on all his tables. Our only problem was there was a couple standing at the end of the bar (by the kitchen), that proceeded to pretty much made out and dry humped each other for the entire time we were trying to eat our dinner.  \\n\\nSecond visit for this review. A friend and I took my mom and her friends back to Bakersfield on Thursday night.  There were six of us so we were told it would be a hour, they ended up getting us in early, because a reservation didn't show.  I could say I was a little disappointed by this visit.  I felt like we weren't offered the same level of service I have received on previous visits.

People take a lot of time to write reviews, and if you want to have a thriving business nowadays, it's in your best interest to pay attention. \\n\\nAs others have noted, your food is good enough. I was bracing for a terrible experience as I tasted the Cornwall Pasty with Parmesan Tomatoes and Guiness Cheese Cauliflower. But, I relaxed with each tasty bite. I would have rated you higher based on your food alone. \\n\\nNow, let me get to the heart of the matter, and why I'm taking the time to tell you how to fix your restaurant so it doesn't go out of business like the multiple chains that have inhabited that place before you.\\n\\nIn my mind, I started calling your restaurant, YE OLDE HOOTERSE. \\n\\nAlmost every review has commented on your poor service. Let me tell you why you have poor service and a weird atmosphere: you're demeaning your diners by thinking that they want their adequate but unremarkable pub food, that is conveniently located on the way home from their kids' soccer game, served by young busty ladies in short plaid skirts. \\n\\nYou may have had a certain kind of douche-y Twin Peaks kind of theme in mind when you opened your restaurant, but the sexy ladies and overweight male managers sorta pushing them around dynamic is unsettling. All the men working were managers and fully dressed, the ladies not so much. Now, I'm sure hot young ladies can be good servers. It's not that. Our server was friendly and competent. But as a wife, mom, business owner, feminist, and person paying the dinner tab, I was uncomfortable that every girl working there HAD to have a low cut, tight t-shirt on, and a skirt that was cut in a really slutty way so you could see her  upper thighs. Maybe you don't know this about the ladies, but in a natural habitat, that kind of forced sexiness is often an act, and for a 'family' restaurant, it makes the entire transacation awkward. \\n\\n People who are coming to your restaurant don't give a shit about how sexy your servers are or aren't. They just want a service experience that meets or exceeds their expectations. In my book, that kind of great service comes when the server is allowed to be him or herself.  How about hiring servers based on their abilities and personalities rather than their cup size? Dump the forced 'hot wench' atmosphere, and let your restaurant become what it should be in that location--a meeting place for friends after work and families who live in the area. \\n\\nMark my words, if you keep up with the Ye Olde Hooterse vibe, you will have to close your doors at worst, and will be less successful than you really could be at best. This is the 21st century, and a forced and awkward sexualized dining environment which demeans everyone involved isn't going to fly.  At least not in Westlake. You could make your restaurant into a real pub, that had a sense of community and inclusivity. That'd be a much for authentic feature of a REAL PUB for your place than the old timey beer swag on the walls."},{"name":"Thai Passion","address":"620 Congress Ave, Ste 105","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"I loved the fact this place was open late, one of the only places you could get good food till 3am.

I went with a group of 8 on a Saturday night and once again, this place absolutely delighted me!\\n\\nI'll start with the drinks. My group ordered 3 bottles of red wine and not being a big red wine lover myself, I ordered a seasonal cocktail named the Garden Party. It consisted of Citadelle gin, Paula's Texas Lemon, strawberries, and basil. This cocktail was absolutely delicious and refreshing. The basil was a unique touch and gave the drink the perfect summer taste. At $10/glass, I highly recommend anyone to try it. You don't have to be a gin lover either!\\n\\nWe ordered tapas and small plates in several rounds/flights and tried just about everything on the menu since we had a large group. The fried goat cheese with honey is probably my favorite dish, with the cheese being so creamy and smooth it was unreal. The lightly fried squash blossoms stuffed with ricotta was also very savory. (I guess you can tell I like cheese and fried things, lol). Finally, the pork pinchitos were wonderfully spiced/seasoned and were very tender. Served on a small skewer, our group devoured them and ordered additional plates.\\n\\nI was not impressed with the lamb and tzatziki. I consider myself an experienced consumer of middle eastern foods and the lamb just lacked any unique or stand out flavorings/spices. The tzatziki was tasty on its own, but the lamb was really the centerpiece of the dish and should have been properly prepared. I will say that falafel was very delicious and shows that they can get some middle eastern inspired dishes correct!\\n\\nThe ambience of the restaurant was perfect and our group enjoyed a lovely table outdoors. After the sun went down it was quite comfortable. Our waiter, Jeremy (I think), was helpful, attentive, and funny with suggestions about wines/cocktails/tapas. I will say though, we gave him our check with a bunch of debit cards and asked to split the bill evenly among all the cards, and it took approximately 30 minutes for him to handle this. We were chatting and having a good time, but I could see where this would upset another group that might have had time constraints or a show to get to, etc. \\n\\nThe best part for me (as a poor grad student) was that the entire meal, plus two cocktails, plus tip cost me $27. That's 3 bottles of wine, 2 cocktails, about 15 tapas, and a cheese plate for desert, and it cost me $27 freakin dollars! The tapas are all very reasonably priced and when you're with a large group you get little tastes of sooo many plates until you realize, \\"geez! I'm full!\\" \\n\\nHighly recommend to someone wanting to try tapas and good drinks with friends. The more plates, the merrier!

If you're a fan of the movie and want to experience a meal with unique service, you may want to give it a go.  Book early during peak times, but those who walk up during off season will be surprised they'll get a seat.\\n\\nMy Overall Rating - 3 Stars (Atmosphere, Service, Food)\\n\\nAtmosphere - If you've seen the movie, you'll know it is set in a French castle/chateau.  The restaurant recreates the rooms and atmosphere in the movie.  There is a large, yellow dining hall that represents the dining room.  But those who are adventurous will want to choose the Prince's private chamber, which is dark (and a little scary for the kids).  You can also see the rose in one of the \\"windows\\" and every few minutes the room will come alive & becomes animated.  I'm sure the other rooms do similar things but this is the room we sat in.  1 Star.\\n\\nService - Technology plays a part here.  Once registered you'll get a red button that you carry with you.  You can place your order at a terminal or with a member of the staff.  Then you find a seat anywhere you want.  As long as you keep the button with you the food will magically find you.  It's actually pretty neat, but it's really counter service with a cool trick.  Drinks and silverware are located in a self-service communal area.  Now if you read the reviews most people will tell you to reserve a spot early.  We went during off season (late September), walked up for lunch, and was able to get a table with no wait!  It doesn't hurt to ask.  1 Star.\\n\\nFood - I'll admit; I think the food at Disney parks is good.  At Be Our Guest Restaurant, you'll get a French menu.  I went with a croquet monsieur, the signature baked ham and cheese sandwich.  The sandwhich is a good size with plenty of ham and flavor.  The crust was a bit hard though and I didn't even bother eating it.  The French onion soup was a little on the salty side, but was not bad by any means.  It has a generous melted cheese cap.   Finally, if you have kids - opt for the grilled cheese and hope they don't finish it.  1 Star.\\n\\nWill I Return? - No.  Honestly we walked up just to see why people waited so long to eat here.  We're still wondering.  It's good counter service style food, but I was expecting a big show or a Beauty/Beast sighting.  I'm glad I was able to experience it but would not come back. No Star.\\n\\nMy Yelp Rating Scale (Sum of all parts):\\n1 Star - Atmosphere - Is it a cool dive?  Perhaps an upscale place?  No matter the type, atmosphere plays a big part and I'll give a star if I like it or thinks it has great charm.\\n1 Star - Service - You can have a great meal with bad service.  But that's also what can make a five star joint drop to four.  It's important to the dining experience that service is great and on point.\\n2 Stars - Food - I'll award up to two stars for the food, since this is the main reason we dine out.  Sometimes the extra star is given for value, but it's really all about the food.\\n1 Star - Will I come back? - If I know for a fact I'll return, I'll give this a star. A place has to make an impression for me to return. \\n\\nEach Category can be given up to 1 star except food (2 stars) because I consider all these categories important to the overall dining experience.

On all three of our visits, the drinks came subsequent to the delivery of the appetizer. There is an obvious issue with the bar - which is a shame, as it is a good drink menu. There is no appearance of a manager or someone watching over the entire staff; food runners frequently do laps around the restaurant looking for the proper table, and there is a general lack of organization and efficiency that one would expect from a restaurant of this caliber.

I am not much on Blue Moon, but the Bloodthirsty Wheat tasted like Blue Moon if Blue Moon were still considered a craft beer.  We also had the Scottish Ale and the Pilsner both of which were really good.\\n\\nThe only reason I am giving Barley Brewing 4 stars is because I thought the portions of food were little disproportionate for a brewery/bar.  We ordered the crabcake appetizer which was delicious, but it was only one cake.  Which, I thought was a little odd, but the spanish slaw was good and so was the sauce that came with it.

The bartenders were amazing, the hostess was polite and cheerful, and our server Jill was absolutely, positively amazing.  More employers need to find servers like her.  Jill was timely, polite, and most of all honest.  We asked her opinion on beers and food and she told us and I truly felt that she meant it.

I was pleased that we were able to get all 14 of us seated together...  it wasn't very busy on a Tuesday evening and we had most of that room in the restaurant to ourselves.  The wait staff obliged our request to push several tables together into one long corporate boardroom-esque rectangle.  \\n\\nWe designated one person as an ordering spokesperson from our group, and she did a great job ordering up a good sampling of the many dishes available.  We got two huge plates - probably a good two feet in diameter - each loaded up with a mixture of meat and veggie dishes, in both mild/aromatic and spicy/berbere sauces.  The food came out very quickly - probably less than 5 minutes after our order was placed, and we all ravenously descended on the food.\\n\\nI love the style of eating with your hands on shared plates with a group of good friends.  I think it gets everyone pulled into discussing the many food dishes, what we each love, which ones were just \\"meh,\\" and so on...  keeping the conversation flowing.  However, I really would have preferred some plates for each person.  Tearing apart the injera bread and using it to pick up the mouthfuls of food is messy business, and I get self-conscious if I start to build up a pile of food detritus on the table in front of me.  Since we had only the massive platters in the center of the table to serve as plates, there was a lot of splattering to be had from the saucy dishes.\\n\\nThe service was decent but not outstanding.  Our food arrived quickly but wasn't hot; the injera was actually somewhat cold, like it had just been pulled out of the fridge.  And though our group was indeed pretty large, it took quite a while to get our drinks that we'd ordered.  But we all enjoyed ourselves and the food was damn tasty overall.  Having a big group allowed us to order more variety than would have been possible with just one or two people.  \\n\\nThe final tab including drinks averaged out to $18 per person, including tip, which I thought was totally reasonable.

The only thing that was just ok was the minced Lamb fried rice. It was good but I could've just had normal white rice.

The genre is a next generation counter service which adds efficiency at the cost of a personal touch. To start, you are able to enter the cast member managed queue exactly five minutes before your scheduled reservation. One person in your party checks in with their magic band and proceeds to a touch screen point of sale kiosk where you order from a limited selection of entries that includes: a protein infused salad; a tender, pork loin & vegetable plate or a few different sandwiches. You conveniently pay up front with a credit card within the food selection transaction. Your party then proceeds to self seat at one of three dining rooms -large, medium and small, each with a twist on the theme that includes it's own different ambient noise level and intensity of room lighting. After a very short waiting period, you are greeted by a CM with a warming tray cart who had managed to precisely locate your table through the GPS tracking of the magic band of the person that checked in upon entrance.

I also received visits from several other employees.  While the attention was nice, it seems that the employees were not looking at the needs of the table before they came.  They were asking me if I wanted a water refill, for example, when I had taken about two sips.  I thought it was a little much.  I thought perhaps that they had even recognized me from my previous review and were doing everything in the world to please me.  You know that law of attraction that says:  \\"The more you pay attention, the less someone likes you?\\"  I had a little bit of that going on tonight.\\n\\nThe key to service is noticing the customer right when they expect some service.

Luckily, we eventually got seated with our sleepy baby. \\n\\nThe beer so far is top notch but the food the second time was hugely disappointing. The first time we ordered Vera K and Fish & Chips, and both were very good. This time, we opted for a burger and 'The Horse.' Given the list of sandwiches, I assumed \\"The Horse\\" would be a delicious, warm sandwich, but what I got instead was cold deli meat, with large, chewy slabs of unrendered fat, cold cheese, and bread that crumbled apart, as soon as I picked it up. I hope they will consider making the sandwiches hot, so its impression is consistent with a $13 entree, rather than a $6 deli sandwich. At the very least it would be good to indicate which items are cold, so that peole don't order them by accident.\\n\\nBeyond that, the real trouble for me is their 'pickles.' Apart from being cloyingly sweet, they are, in fact, zucchini slices, rather than traditional pickles. Nowhere on the menu does it indicate this, or that they are within almost all of the sandwiches. I recognize that wouldn't be a problem for most people, but I am allergic to them, and didn't realize what had happened, until I began to feel gut-shot on the ride home, and remained in intense pain overnight.

On this occasion I had placed an online order (wow the convenience) and was going in to pick it up (I live outside the delivery area, which is sad).  This is where they fall short.  I walked in at 12:45pm on a Tuesday and the line was to the door (almost going out the door).  \\n\\nFirst, there is no where for the line to go because there is a bookshelf right by the door.  This is a problem as people are trying to leave and there is a line of people waiting to order.  Second, there was one girl working the register and no place for me to go but to wait in the line.  I had ordered, paid and my pizza was sitting there (on a warming shelf) and I had to wait for 8 people to place ordered before I could get my pizza.  This took 12 minutes.  There should be a place for me to walk up and grab my order and not wait in the line - period.  Once it was my turn, it took less than a minute for the woman to check my order and give it to me.\\n\\nNow let's talk food - I love their pizza.  They have a ton of Specialty Pizzas, but you can also build your own.  Their ingredients are always fresh and flavorful, crispy yet chewy crust and a fabulous selection of cheeses.  My favorites are:\\n\\nWhite Pizzas:\\nChicken in the grass - olive oil, Italian spices, Romano cheese, covered in roasted spinach and grilled chicken, and topped with four imported cheeses.\\n\\nThe Sicilian -sliced tomatoes, Italian olive oil, Italian spices, Romano cheese, onions and green peppers, pepperoni.  Note: you can get this with hot peppers if you prefer and sausage if you prefer.  I like it with the green peppers and the pepperoni, myself.\\n\\nSpinach and Ricotta - Oven roasted spinach, fresh mushrooms and onions mixed over creamy ricotta cheese and then covered with mozzarella.\\n\\nRed Pizzas:\\nThe Works - red sauce, mozzarella cheese, pepperoni, fresh mushrooms, green and black olives, green peppers, onions, and Italian sausage.\\n\\nAnd my favorite:\\nMeatza Pizza - red sauce, creamy mozzarella, pepperoni, ham, bacon, sausage, and ground beef.\\n\\nThe oddball that I enjoy: BBQ Chicken - grilled chicken marinated in smokey barbecue sauce covered with mozzarella and onions, topped with bacon and cheddar cheese.  I know, it sounds weird, but it's pretty damn good.\\n\\nI also enjoy their salads a lot. I usually get the Greek and add artichoke hearts.  My only complaint is that they use canned black olives instead of kalamatas.  It isn't a true Greek salad without kalamatas.  Those canned ones taste like the can, unfortunately.  But I enjoy the salad nonetheless.\\n\\nOverall, Galla's is a solid pizza joint with great food offerings.  They just have got to fix their in-house service.  I do need to come in and dine, but I just did not have the time yesterday.  I will give them a shot to serve me on site.  However, make a pick up line, Galla's.  I saved you time ordering online and you didn't have to process my credit card or take my order.  Least you could do is help me out by not letting my pizza get cold and let me run in and grab my food. And give the poor girl up front some help!!"},{"name":"Gordon Biersch Brewery Restaurant","address":"401 N Front St, Ste 120","city":"Columbus","stars":"3","text":"I don't see a need to write a novel here.

The restaurant focuses on northeastern Italy cuisine in a region called Friuli. I knew nothing about it before experiencing Frasca. Culinarily its not at all like central Italian food, which we most often associate Italian food with (See Pasta Jay's). Order the frico to start. Apparently its a Friulian classic and its simple and delicious. Ask your server about the dishes being offered that evening and how they connect to Friulian cuisine.

After seeing so many people suggest this place, it was on the top of my list of places to eat. Since we stayed at a Disney hotel, I was able to easily get a reservation for 6pm. You check-in at the front gate no more than 15min in advance before heading to the front of the castle. I specifically requested the West Wing so our wait was increased from 15min to ~40min, but I think it was well worth it. When you enter, you get a quick tour of the castle which you can explore in more detail after your meal. We were seated right in front of the rose which made for a great background, but a lot of the other guests that came through weren't that courteous and kept bumping into our chairs and table while we were eating, breaking whatever illusion was set. The room itself is the darkest of the three, but also the most intimate in my opinion.

I couldn't decide on which so I just got the sampler of three - a rose, chardonnay, and red. The red is what stood out to me, but it depends on what you're in the mood for.\\n\\nBraised pork (Coq au Vin style) - Delicious! The pork was so tender and the pureed cauliflower was a great compliment. I also really liked the broccolini.\\n\\nLayered ratatouille - My mom wasn't too hungry so she opted for this veggie dish with quinoa and bell pepper sauce. She's never heard of ratatouille, but she really enjoyed it. The presentation was also the nicest of the entrees.\\n\\nPan-seared chicken breast - My dad always gets chicken and there isn't much variety in what you can do. At least it was juicy and had good flavor.\\n\\nStrawberry cream cheese cupcake - I had originally come here thinking I'd get the grey stuff, but given the recent mixed reviews I decided to try this instead.

It's chunky (sometimes bordering on too chunky) and just has that super fresh garlic-onion taste. The chips are good, too and the best way to enjoy it is to supplement the guac with the salsa verde available in a squeeze bottle on the table. \\n\\nThe short rib taco is pretty awesome, as is the Chicken Mole. I've tried others but I think those 2 are my go-tos now. The short rib torta was pretty tasty (I mean, short rib, c'mon...) but it didn't come with many toppings, which was sad because I love the veggies.

I got a brisket plate with Mac and Cheese, and Coleslaw, while my friend got the Ruben Sandwich with Collard Greens and Baked beans.  Both dishes had Brisket on them.\\n\\nBrisket:  The texture was off a little.  I felt like I was eating corned beef, and not brisket, if that makes any sense.

I'm OBSESSED with the water spinach and beef salad. I've never had anything like it. I get it every time. You should too.

There's probably peanuts on a lot of things. Our waitress was so careful and diligent, and my friend survived. \\n\\nSo of course, you can expect the prices to also be a bit higher than your typical pho place - because of the service, because it's a sit down restaurant that you won't be rushed out of, because of the fresh ingredients, because of the decor, because of the special cocktails and because it's an upscale restaurant.

The turkey jicama sandwich was reduced to the size of a slider roll that could not contain its many components so it became impossible to eat.  They must have continued to reduce the size until it finally disappeared off the menu completely, they no longer serve their very best sandwich!  They also took away the chickpea sandwich and reduced their salads to the size of side salads but still just as expensive.  How much cost savings do you get by saving yourself a few handfuls of mesclun in each salad?  I understand the need to update menus but to take the most popular items away is probably a bad move, at least I know it has impacted my likelihood of going back.

That allowed the entree to catch up, and even pass, the prep time.  Most all selections were served tepid at best....those that were to have been warm!  BTW, the nachos were average.  The Grilled Chicken Salad was a just an okay salad.  The ribs were pretty good.  The Fish n Chips were good up to the bite that someone in the kitchen hid the salt that was to go in the salt shaker!  The Corn Flake Chicken tasted like chicken with corn flakes baked on it.  All was very average.\\n\\nI want Mikki's to make it.

I think this place has potential if they make a few changes.\\n\\nI booked a party for 10 people for a friends birthday last minute at Pizza Ludica. I was out of options on a Friday night, had been here once before just as they were rebranding to Pizza Ludica, thought the pizza was decent and remembered the addition of board games. The lady I spoke to on the phone had to double check the reservation list because there was already a large party coming in that night but said she would fit me in and took down my name and phone number. \\n\\nForward to the Friday night. We arrived on time for our reservation. There was no one in the restaurant at 7pm. Eeek, bad sign. One of the two males working there greeted us at the door and I told him about my reservation. He seemed shocked that there was one and said he didn't have any record (What about that other large party?). No worries though as the place was completely empty. \\n\\nIt took a while to place our initial drink and food orders with the waiter which was a  bit frustrating given we were the only people there. In fact during the entire night only about 3 or 4 other tables of 2 arrived and we constantly had to wave the waiter over to our table. It seemed like only one waiter was working and the other was more of a bus boy. At one point the waiter was eating dinner at the bar and we had to walk up to him and tap him on his back to order another drink. Maybe since the place is so dead they aren't used to so many people?\\n\\nThe positives are that the pizza is actually pretty good, beer is cheap, and there is a huge variety of board games. \\n\\nNegatives? Well you've read the above. Basically the waiters didn't seem to care or work very hard (considering our table would be most of their tip for the night). Also I understand they are going through some rebranding but just wanted to give them a few suggestions.... If you want to be a pizza and board game restaurant you need the atmosphere to fit that theme. The place is very formal, too bright, music too quiet (especially when playing loud board games) and the pizza oven makes the restaurant extremely hot.

Their best asset is their selection of eggs Benedict, far wider than any other breakfast joint in town. The home fries are also great (deep fried and crunchy, my personal preference). I've never ordered something that they screwed up, so no complaints on consistency. Portions are always generous! The only qualm I have with Grand Day Cafe, as with almost every breakfast restaurant in the world, is the quality of their coffee, which is always weak and bitter.

That combined with a Japanese chef and staff sounded really good in theory.  \\n\\nAfter being seated, I waited about 8 minutes before being brought tea and a menu.  The waitress apologized for the delay.  \\n\\nWhile I was waiting for her to return to place my order (it took another 5-6 minutes) two more tables came in and somehow got to order first.  Not impressed.  \\n\\nWhen she finally got around to taking my order, I ordered the Sushi mini udon combination and an order of oshitashi.  \\n\\nFairly quickly one of the assistant chefs came out from the kitchen and delivered a small bowl of miso soup to me.  I've never been a fan of miso soup as an appetizer, I prefer it either with or at the end of my meal.  So I let it sit for a while to wait for some of the other food.  The waitress came and said, \\"Oh, you got miso soup. You shouldn't have.  I'll take that back.\\"  Huh?  I don't want to know if that went out to another table or not, but it likely would have been better to just leave it on the table since it technically should be disposed of once it is with a customer.  Oh well.....1 star on the service.\\n\\nA little while later my mini udon appeared.  It was nice and hot, and the broth had a good flavour.  The noodles were cooked nicely, and overall it was a decent dish.  3.5 stars.

The spinach itself was nicely prepared and tightly squeezed to remove moisture.  It could have used just a tad more sesame oil or soy.  The cilantro sprig on top was a distraction I could have done without.  Overall it was decent.  3.5 stars.

They served this in two plates, with the first plate having 4 California roll pieces and a piece of unagi.  The California roll was a bit sloppy in its rolling style with 2 pieces falling apart.  The unagi sauce was overpowering as it was a thick dollop instead of a light brushing.  Overall not a good start to the sushi course.  The plate overall was sloppy, and I put the gari which was hanging over the edge back on the plate before taking this photo:  http://www.yelp.ca/biz_photos/coqxVbUYe61eO8Ip8ti_-Q?select=GiJN2r17B0KRBuenwzcaIA 2 stars.  \\n\\nNext was a plate with 10 nigiri.  This was a mixed bag.  Some were good, and some really were not.  Once again the plating was sloppy and I pulled the gari off the edge of the plate and put it down nicely before snapping a photo.  Several of the fish slices were badly hacked so that part of the sushi rice was exposed.  Several of the nigiri had sushi rice that was overly compressed, while others were falling apart.  Generally the overall dish gave a very sloppy impression, and I felt bad for the fish.  In terms of the actual fish quality it was also variable.  The ebi was overcooked and mushy as if it had been through a bad defrost cycle.  The salmon was fresh.  The saba had been hacked badly and was falling apart.  The tuna was slightly past its prime (fully edible, just not as fresh as I would prefer) and had some defrosting issues with the texture as well.

Carried it to us, that was the happiest I had seen anyone in this restaurant at all during our visit. They looked like they were having fun! Which is great! Aaaand then we sat there with no plates or forks for about 8 minutes as multiple employees walked around avoiding eye contact, and even someone who may have been a manager. So again we had to prompt service.\\n\\nI probably should have done a little digging before coming to this restaurant, as I understand every business has its days. It was a slow Sunday, around 7/7:30 pm with only a few tables. Yet the entire place felt in the weeds. I felt really bad for even asking them to present the cake, and felt even worse for asking my boyfriends family to drive 45 minutes to a restaurant I thought was going to be worth while.

Boma is a buffet-style (or as Disney calls it, \\"all-you-care-to-eat\\") restaurant at Disney's Animal Kingdom Lodge that has been one of my family's favorites for the last 10 years. Why? It is a value-priced buffet with a terrific assortment of African-inspired cuisine with some classic American favorites sprinkled in. This provides the perfect opportunity to explore new flavors without committing an entire entree to your selection while offering a small but satisfying medley of American food (chicken nuggets, fries, mac 'n' cheese, etc.) for picky kids and not-so-adventurous diners.\\n\\nI have been to Boma primarily for dinner but most recently visited for breakfast. Honestly, breakfast took me by surprise and was very delicious. One of my personal favorites was the fried plantains, which were incredibly sweet with a soft interior and firm exterior. You'll also find a great assortment of savory breakfast meats, delicious pastries (the french toast bread pudding was to die for), and of course Mickey waffles (obligatory at every Disney breakfast). For dinner, Boma offers a variety of African meats, poultry, rice, veggies, and desserts (Zebra Domes might not originate from Africa, but they certainly are an amazing mousse creation).\\n\\nThe ambiance here is also very enjoyable. Located two floors below the lobby (which is on the third floor), Boma is spacious and can even accommodate groups of up to 18 (on my last trip we were able to sit this many guests at one long table). You'll find African-inspired decor and architecture that will make you feel like a welcomed guest in a pleasant Zulu hut. After you're finished with your meal, you might want to head outside past the pool to take a look at some animals on the savannah or head up to the second floor for a drink at Victoria Falls Lounge.\\n\\nThe Cast Members (staff) at Boma are also incredible and very accommodating (it's that Disney service). Meanwhile, prices will run about $35-$40 per person for the full buffet.\\n\\nIn short, Boma deviates from the typical buffet experience and provides a unique culinary adventure through the African continent, all in an affordable, friendly, and comfortable setting."},{"name":"Mike and Lill's Black Sheep Pub & Grill","address":"5 Central St, the other day","city":"Peabody","stars":"4","text":"Just came in on a Sunday around 11 for breakfast/brunch and was not disappointed.

I go to Disney a lot, and at times have become \\"numb\\" to the amazingness of Disney. I understand that many save to come here and experience the magic, and at times I feel the magic still too (especially during the holidays in the Fall).\\n\\nAnyway, just want to preface that. \\n\\nI base my entire review on the food you receive in a restaurant with the price point this one has. The food was average. Nothing to write home about, but it was not bad. I had the French Onion soup and the Herb Crusted Lamb Chops. The French Onion soup was pretty mediocre. It looks pretty but once you dunk into it, there are hardly any onions. The best part of the soup was the cheese :)  The Lamb Chops were pretty good - cooked well, but not the best I have ever had either. Honestly, one of my favorite restaurants is Bonefish Grill and I think their lamb chops are AMAZING. For the cost (around $30) at Be Our Guest, just seems like you are getting cheated. You get what is equivalent to 4 chops, but they come out in a pair. \\n\\nMy husband got the scallop and shrimp puff dish. It was VERY mediocre. Again, looks pretty, but once you get into it, it is just a basic meal with no \\"melt in your mouth\\" feeling. Out total meal cost $100 with tip and 1 beer. We got water so if you were to get more alcohol then it would go up. For $100, I would have rather gone somewhere else.\\n\\nNOW the atmosphere / decor is great. You feel you are really in the Beast's castle. There are 3 dining halls. We were in the ballroom. Then there is the West Wing (where Beast didn't want Belle to go - which hosts the Rose) and then there is a room that is pretty uninteresting with a huge music box with Belle and the Beast dancing. It honestly reminds me of a cafeteria room.  But the Ballroom and West Wing dining halls are very nice and decorated to a T from the movie. I wish there were more character interactions or even some music playing from the movie. But really as far as atmosphere it is just mock rooms. Now the snow falling outside of the ballroom is pretty cool.\\n\\nLet's face it Disney is good with details. I just wish there was more - especially since the wait list is like 6 months in advanced. You would think they were giving away gold. I guess they are selling an experience to eat in Beast's castle."},{"name":"Happy's Bar & Kitchen","address":"1363 Boylston St","city":"Boston","stars":"3","text":"Bring back the old menu!

It was HUGE and pretty good, so if you've never had one, this place is a good one to try it out at. \\n\\nI think my favorite food though was the fried chicken wings ($12) we got as an appetizer. You could've got it one of two ways: with chili fish sauce or with butter, garlic, and green onion.

I don't know if they make them in-house, but the pastas are amazing every time. They cook the pasta al dente, but softer when applicable. I like getting at least one small pasta to split for dinner.\\n\\nThe rest of the menu usually has a meat, poultry, or fish main courses (rarely vegetarian). They do an amazing pairing job of the dishes with other creative flavors but not too wild. From my experience my least favorites are usually the beef and lamb; I would leave that for the steak houses.\\n\\nJeff Morgenthaler, the bartender is awesome; really, the whole bar-tending staff is actually awesome. I always order Manhattans as my first drink in all restaurants to gauge the bartenders; as a simple drink the balance is very important and to my surprise many restaurants get this wrong. Not here, they get this spot on every time. The daily punch is also a great option for something fun.

The breakfast sandwhich is the best that I have ever had.  A nice sausage patty rests on egg smothered in amazing melted cheese in between my plain bagel slices.  The precooked egg came from the refridgerator, but it tasted rather fresh.  The sandwhich was not small and it was a true breakfast sandwhich.  The cost is $2.62.  The onion bagel that I had in addition to it was good and I love their cream cheese.  I would not be surprised if the cream cheese was homemade.  The bagel cost $1.55.  It was a nice touch to observe the bagels being made via the see-through window.  You can also get deli bagel sandwhiches like turkey, pastrami and roast beef.\\n\\nNow lets go to the bad.  The smoothie was not that good, and to be honest, I have had better.  I got the lemonade smoothie which they claimed had fresh fruit and were \\"real\\" smoothies.  The smoothie was more water and ice than lemon and natural lemon flavoring.  It was not thick at all and not that sweet.  It was disappointing to realize that the large smoothie, at $3.80, cost more than the other two quality items that I have had.  I would not recommend the smoothies at all.\\n\\nNow, on to the ugly.  If you read the other reviews, you knew this was coming.  The wait is unbearably long.  I had to wait atleast a half an hour on this Saturday.  The service is polite, but it is way too long for an establishment that is not an actual restaurant.  I have never, ever, EVER, waiting so long for such simple food.  The worst part is the townies.

There was no sauce to speak of on one of the burgers, and the other asked for no sauce since \\"I can't eat cow milk or dairy, but feta or goat cheese is fine.\\" The 40 minute wait would have been at least understandable, had we not been the only seated table out of the nine in our section plus the fact that it wasn't even half full of people at that time in the whole restaurant. Also, the table that was seated after us AND ordered after us got their burgers way before us.\\n\\nA bug was discovered in the ravioli dish towards the end, which was remedied by comp'ing that dish and offering a free dessert for that person. We were not given dessert menus, which is totally fine, so when the waitress told us the dessert menu, we ordered two apple crisps, chocolate bread pudding (without a plate underneath, so it was a complete mess all over the table before the first bite), and a bacon caramel sundae. But only after she took one of our orders and walked away did we have to call her back to ask her to finish taking our dessert order. The bacon caramel sundae came out, but without the bacon, because \\"the bacon would be another twenty minutes and I didn't want to keep you waiting.\\" You know, without consulting the person who ordered it first. When my apple crisp came, it was smothered with ice cream and whipped cream and I explained again very politely that I cannot eat dairy or cream, and the waitress was totally pissed, despite me explicitly saying this earlier, plus not stating this fact as she's reciting to us what the dessert menu is since she never gave us a dessert menu (not our fault).\\n\\nThe only person at the table drinking only water for the evening never had their water glass refilled, despite finishing it part way through dinner. At the start of dessert, this person finally had to ask for \\"more water when you get a chance, please.\\" The water eventually came, at the end of dessert, and despite the waitress having at least a half full pitcher of tap water, she didn't even pour enough for half a cup. This was as the water drinker was reviewing the bill and about to pay.\\n\\nOh and the lamb burger was pretty meh (not recommended - the bread was the best part...I've had much better lamb burgers). I was given an option between a couple of different fries or a salad. I opted for the salad and got just green leafs (lettuce, maybe spinach, etc), but not even one piece of cucumber, tomato, any other vegetable. Is this what's considered a salad in Watch City Brewery?\\n\\nOh yeah, we sampled 3 different beers and 3 of us got beer but none were good. Thankfully the apple crisp was likely pre-made because otherwise it seemed like a possible destination for waitress tampering.\\n\\nTowards the end I was looking around for spots where hidden cameras might be hidden...I was convinced we were on a show about testing people's patience. Didn't see any.\\n\\n\\n***This experience was in January 2014, but I had emailed the review to myself after dinner and forgot to copy and paste it into yelp until now.

Like many Yelpers, I find the food portions here small for the price point, but we are in the Piedmont Park neighborhood. Compared to other dining options in the area, the value here is actually great. Ah-Ma's Taiwanese Kitchen prices their menu items in accordance to what their peers are doing. You must also remember that real estate is much more expensive in this popular Atlanta area than Buford Hwy. or the northern suburbs, where you can find good Asian food for pretty cheap.\\n\\nService is nice and I think both times I was here, one of the owners has been my party's server. I have eaten quite a few things, including Salt & Pepper Chicken, Xiang Chang (Taiwanese sausage), Beef Noodle Soup, Pork Belly Bao, Dirty Bird Bao, Veggie Bao (with tofu), Lu Rou Fan (minced pork with a half boiled egg), and Jade Tofu. Everything has been great. The baos are not big, so one for an appetizer works, but you will need 2-3 for a full meal if you choose that route.\\n\\nThe inside is kind of a modern industrial look, which fits in the area and gave me a different dining experience from eating at a more traditional Asian restaurant. If I am in the area and am craving Taiwanese food, I would not hesitate to return. Admittedly, I have two OTP Taiwanese places that I love, where I find my money goes a bit farther. That is not to say that this is a great ITP option, as it further expands the diversity of the Atlanta dining scene.\\n\\nIf you have not had Taiwanese food and you are scared to go to Gwinnett county (mostly Norcross and Duluth) or Buford Hwy., get your introduction to the cuisine at Ah-Ma's. Maybe it will pique your interest just enough that you will think about venturing beyond the confines of what you find safe.

The inside is clear and minimal.  The garage door still exists and is used for ventilation like Missions Coffee or Brothers Drake.

No more then 5 min pass by and 3 dishes come to the table , corn bread with a chili flavored butter which was honestly the best cornbread I've ever had in my life , yucca frites which is fries made out of the yucca root and topped with some kind of garlicky white sauce that was very tasty , and also the tuna ceviche which comes in a few pieces slightly grilled to rare tuna on top of latin fusion type concoction that they ask you to chop up and mix all together , delish ! Then we ordered two kinds of tacos , jerk spiced free run chicken and mole lamb albondigas  ! All I have to say is  OMG , those were the best tacos that I ever had in my life ! Then came out the char grilled flat iron  steak grilled in an incredible rub and sliced thin and put on top of Tijuana style baby Caesar salad and chorizo buttermilk mash potatoes , so good !

Unlike everyone else that was eating there, we didn't know this place existed until we realized we were hungry, and this was the closest place to eat. We were a little shocked to realize that reservations are made MONTHS in advance, but we wanted to try our luck and see about getting a table for 2 at 830pm. \\n\\nTo put it in a not-so-nice fashion, SUCKERS! We were sat before several couples around us that did have reservations, which was really nice for me and my husband. The whole restaurant is themed around Belle's big dinner in Beauty and the Beast, and they did a fantastic job with it all. You enter over the drawbridge to the castle, and wait for your waiter to call you, and you follow the waiter to your table holding a candlestick like Lumier- very exciting. \\n\\nThe inside of the place is absolutely stunning. It looks just like a scene from the movie. We were sat in the main ballroom, and there are two other rooms off to the sides. Once is themed to look like the West Wing (Beast's chamber), so it's darker and has ripped curtains, big windows, and the rose in it. What's fantastic is that there's an element of thematic surprise in each of the rooms. In the ballroom, the giant windows show a mountain range outside, with snow falling in flurries as you dine. In the West Wing, the red rose's petals slowly drop, and the slashed portrait of the beast as a prince progresses towards a painting of him as a beast. The Rose Dinining room has a giant music box as the center piece, which plays music and spins while you dine. \\n\\nNow, the food. It was fantastic. Absolutely great, especially considering that we were inside a theme park and we hadn't been impressed with any of the food until then. Everything we ate was fantastic. My husband started with the French Onion soup, which was delicious (I snuck a few bites!) and I had the seasonal salad trio. I was surprised that the salad trio wasn't actually salad, but a variety of fruits, veggies, and herbs that was surprisingly delicious. The watermelon mint salad was my personal favorite. \\n\\nFor entrees, i had the Thyme-scented Pork Rack Chop, which was amazingy. The sides were perfect, the pork chop was beautifully seasoned and cooked to perfection, and the au jus that came with it was the perfect compliment. My husband had the Grilled Strip Steak, and there was nothing left of it. He ate it all so quickly that I didn't get to try a bite! I'm assuming that it was delicious. \\n\\nThey have a dessert cart that gets pushed around, and we knew what we wanted before it even came to us. They have an assortment of cupcakes and pastries to choose from, all of which are beautifully prepared. We decided to split the strawberry cream cheese cupcake, because we were both so full we couldn't do one apeice. It was amazing. Moist, tastey, and just the right size if you're too full for dessert. \\n\\nIf we ever find ourselves at Disney World again, I'll be sure to make a reservation for a table. We were lucky to stumble upon one of the best and most magical dinners we'd had, but I don't want to take my chances of not being seated!"},{"name":"Tahini Mediterranean Grill Caf√©","address":"3100 Alafaya Trl","city":"Oviedo","stars":"4.5","text":"This is the real deal.

Black Lobster has always had good outdoor seating, so why not?\\n\\nCue retardery. \\n\\nFirst observation after being seated, a spotty long haired teenager wandering around asking if we'd ordered a plate of fried something that he had totally lost track of who it belonged to. \\n\\nOur server arrived. \\n\\nSo, I ordered a house mojito, while my son and wife went over the menu. What arrived was a tall glass of white rum with a couple of leaves floating in it. Undrinkable and clearly no muddling of the mint at all, what there was of it. I took it back to the bar and the bar waitress clearly had no idea how to make a mojito, so I was offered another drink in its place. I got a bloody mary - hard to mess that up right? Apparently, you can. What came tasted like a mix of vodka and tomato ketchup - a sweet bloody mary with some token horseradish swimming around in it.\\n\\nTime to order some actual food, so I got a half dozen mixed oysters. Not terrible themselves, but apparently the tomato ketchup theme pervades both food and drink and the dipping sauce was pretty much exactly the same as whatever mixer was in the bloody mary. Nasty.\\n\\nMy wife ordered a shrimp cocktail - a mess of leaves and some dry looking shrimp, with again, a dipping sauce of tomato ketchup. My son ordered a bowl of ice cream. Somehow, that came without tomato ketchup, which is good. \\n\\nCue drink order 3. Undrinkable bloody mary abandoned, I asked the server for a Harpoon IPA and she went off to order it. Approximately 20 minutes later she came out to apologize for what happened to my beer. I asked her what she meant. She said, they poured it, but then forgot to bring it out and it was now flat. Would I like another one? Also, what kind of beer was it again? I told her, it was a Harpoon IPA, like the one I ordered the first time. \\n\\nWanting something a bit more substantial to eat, I ordered a bowl of lobster bisque. This came out lukewarm and appeared to be an orange bowl of the tomato ketchup with some random cream. No pieces of discernible lobster.\\n\\nI ate a bit of this and then my beer arrived. In a chipped pint glass. \\n\\nFinally abandoning any attempt to eat food here, or have something resembling customer service, we got the check, witnessing some spotty long haired idiot once again come over and offer us a plate of fried something. \\n\\nAs we left, we observed three people so overserved that they couldn't walk up the ramp from the lower to the upper deck of the \\"restaurant\\". At around 6pm on a Sunday.\\n\\nTo the \\"management\\"... I used to live in Salem. I used to come here pretty often. I am not sure what has happened in the past couple of years, but this is the worst managed, worst served and worst dining experience I have ever had. And I used to live in Scotland. \\n\\nTruly I will never be back and I will be spreading the word. You're a disgrace."},{"name":"Bakersfield","address":"733 N High St","city":"Columbus","stars":"4","text":"Best tacos, margaritas and Mexican sandwiches!

We both work in the industry so we didn't want to complain but the king crab legs were 40.00, so we asked if they could heat up the crab legs, and her mashed potatoes. The bartender apologized and took the plates back, we had all ready waited 30 minutes for the entrees the first time and this time they came back in about 10 minutes. It was much better, but we never did say anything about her Salmon. The bartender did not bring us any silverware, he took our forks when he took our plates back.

I specifically asked if any of the other meats (brisket, pork, turkey) are local, and the cashier stated that they are working on a sustainable source for those meats, but currently only the chicken was local (in case anyone else is curious about such things). I also ordered a soda, because it's FOUNTAIN Boylan's soda! I've never seen this anywhere, and I was super pumped about it. My husband ordered a Seventh Son beer. \\n\\nI wasn't sure what to expect for the portion size because a lot of the reviewers seem to think they are too small -- I thought the size of the portion was perfect. I really liked how all of the flavors married together, and the chicken meatballs were not too overpowering. I do think that if I had ordered the brisket that it would have been too heavy of a meal with the mac n' cheese and corn cake. The corn cake looked like a giant corn pancake, and it did a great job of providing a solid base for all of the toppings.The salads here look bangarang, and I'd love to try one next time.\\n\\nThis is a really great space.

This restaurant is always busy, so we called 6 weeks in advance for reservations. We got a nice table by the window, that looked out on Pearl Street. They designed a special 4-course menu for Valentine's day, where you could choose one of two items for each course. We started out with an appetizer, and couldn't resist ordering the prosciutto plate, which had 3 different kids of meats on it, as well as bread sticks. It was amazing! Best prosciutto ever, and paired with a great glass of wine. They also serve fresh bread at the table throughout the service (bread courtesy of Udi's).\\n\\nWe wanted to really sample the menu, so we ordered one of each for every course (two total) and shared, so we could sample everything. Dinner started off with a broccoli lobster soup, which despite our doubts, was delicious - very creamy and the lobster added just the right flavor. The other dish was a fried egg - and not just any fried egg - this egg was boiled, then dipped in a batter and fried, but the yolk was still runny. First time we ever tried this and were pleasantly surprised. Then we moved on to short ribs that were shredded and wrapped in a thin dough - delicious. There was also a tortellini, with dried apples - this was an interesting flavor, very light. Then we sampled a rib eye dish and a scallop dish, both of which were mouth-watering. Desert was the only course we didn't sample both items - we couldn't resist the chocolate mousse cake with chocolate gelato, which was so rich and creamy, it was delicious.\\n\\nOur waitress, Rose was great. She helped us pair a couple of different wines with our meal, that really complimented the dishes we were having.\\n\\nEven for such a busy night, the service was great, and we really enjoyed the special menu. It was a very well carried out dinner service. From our viewpoint, everything was seamless and flawless. We didn't have to wait long at all between courses, and truly enjoyed probably one of the best meals we've ever had.\\n\\nAt the end of dinner, our waitress even took us for a quick tour of the kitchen and the new wine storage room that was just recently added when they expanded. \\n\\nThis was the perfect dinner for a special occasion.

I'm sorry others are upset by what many consider progress, but we live near the corner of 360 & 2222. We weren't too thrilled when Waterloo moved in and started doing outdoor live music events every month or two, but we learned to live with it. Same thing goes for the County Line. They have live music too and we've not complained once, even though we can easily hear it at our house when they play. We can also smell when their pits are fired up. I guess I should be complaining to the police that their pits are infringing on my right to breathe BBQ smoke-free air. What the HELL has happened to this city? People wonder why we've lost so much of our \\"Live Music Capital\\" moniker. I'll tell you why....it's because of whiny people who complain about live music.\\n\\nHere's a thought - as long as they're over by 10p, there's not much you can do. If it bothers you so much, and if what they're doing is not illegal, go ahead and MOVE! Nobody is forcing you to stay where you are.  Heck, mortgage rates are at historic lows and home prices are about as low as they're ever going to get. Why don't you get started and I'll call some movers to help you get packed? As another person who lives in the neighborhood, I like live music and am happy The Hub offers it.\\n\\nI agree with at least one other reviewer that thinks people complaining about the sound of live music in their neighborhood really miss the point of Yelp. Your problems with ownership/management regarding neighborhood issues shouldn't impact your review of whether or not The Hub is a good place to eat, but I guess that's the beauty of Yelp.

They spent so much money trying to make their restaurant look like a 1990s Starbucks that they have to pass the \\"buck\\" onto you. It feels like an airport restaurant that costs even more.\\n\\nBurgers: low-grade beef, poorly assembled, low-quality Sysco ingredients, flavorless cheese, hammered lettuce, pointless tomatoes, flavorless mimic of a brioche roll, way over priced.\\n\\nCrispy calamari: fishy smell, limp, cooked in oil that was old and too cold. A waste of an animal. The breading tasted like Playdough. Three people and we ate about half of it.\\n\\nBaked mac n cheese with fried chicken: Sounds good right? WRONG! (Think Charlie Murphy \\"wrong\\" here) - Velveeta runny mess (not a baked, maybe boiled?) with grilled chicken breast chunks stirred in, not even fried. Not even close to the description. Bad flavor too, but I think the heavies might like it because you can shovel it in if you get the plate up to your face just right.\\n\\nBoneless wings: not wings, but chicken cubes in slimy commissary sauce with chemical flavors. Chicken soaked in brine to keep it \\"fresh\\", but it's just mushy.\\n\\nOut of several of their decent beers twice. The beers we got were flat and had bar-line taste. Over priced.\\n\\nCleanliness: poor. Food on seats where bus boy left table wipings, appetizer plates brought out wet with food bits stuck on them, silverware had spots and dried food (nasty), two of our glasses had lipstick, real f*ing nasty.\\n\\nService: A joke - all three times. If it's slow (weekend lunch), chatty barbie chicks pay more attention to each other's stories  than the tables.  Water ran out repeatedly, never asked if more beers wanted, had to go to hostess stand to ask for check, then back again to get someone to pick it up.  If a manager worth their salt worked there, they would have fired those dunces on the spot for that crap. Medium crowd, lunch weekday: Even worse, no condiments offered (we all had burgers, which were served open-face, as if to accept condiments), then when we flagged a server and requested some, the dude just forgot about (I had to get ketchup from the bar). Again with the poor table attention, it felt like we were bothering them by being there. Friday evening: crowded, mega-slow, challenged staff can't keep up. Servers are supposed to take responsibility for ensuring food comes out of the kitchen right. Just a glance at our plates would have found the problems with each. Again dirty silverware.\\n\\nThe music they play is some sort of bad cover band mix. Hilariously odd.\\n\\nJust save your money, it's pretty much a dressed up Applebees.

Lots of families and groups of 2 and 4. We were seated promptly, then checked on a few times before our waitress came over to get our drink orders. While we were waiting, we chatted about the ambiance. The theme is a bit confusing; there's comics in the bathroom, Rock 'n Roll in one room, 80s in another, the cartoon logo, some type of western d√©cor by the main bar. A bit of a split personality.\\n\\nFirst off, this place is big. I believe they took over the old Beef O' Bradys (and then, Mango Spice for about 2 months), along with the space next to it. There's two bars, a large, full one in the main dining area, and a smaller one off to the side. The space seems (much) larger and brighter this way.\\n\\nWe ordered our drinks, water for me, keg root beer for the boyfriend. (Spoiler alert: The root beer was the best part of dinner. Either it's that good, or the food was that bad.) The menu is very, very large. A theme isn't made any more clear at this point. \\n\\nWe started with the Tenderloin Sliders. These came out about 15-20 minutes after we ordered them. Nothing special. Bread to meat ratio was off, and I think the meat was overcooked. 3 sliders come with the order.\\n\\nOur entrees arrived about 40-45 minutes after we ordered them. So we had a lot of time to observe those around us. Lots of unhappy families. People with crossed arms. Lots of food being sent back to the kitchen -- we saw 6 burgers go back at once. Walk-ins were told there was a 40 minute wait to be seated, since the kitchen needed to \\"catch up.\\" A bit after that, some others were turned away and told they weren't seating anymore. At this point, the restaurant was practically silent -- and not in a oh-my-God-this-food-is-so-good-our-mouths-are-full way. More of an annoyed-everyone-is-tired-and-wants-to-go-home way.\\n\\nOur food arrived. I ordered Baby Back Ribs with Mashed Potatoes (cold). My boyfriend was pleased with his Black and Blue Burger, but the side was wrong. The ribs were decent, but I had to request additional BBQ sauce to give them flavor. It was clear they were just squirted with a bit, not basted as the menu says. The meat was somewhat dry, but the sauce was good.\\n\\nIn the end, we were given 10% off our check because of the wait. Our waitress told us another table received a comped meal \\"because they waited for more than an hour\\" (not necessarily something you want to broadcast), and went on about how busy it was in there and how she couldn't keep up.\\n\\nI'm returning for lunch with a friend next week and look forward to seeing how the kinks are worked out between now and then."},{"name":"Wendy's","address":"7170 Sawmill Rd.","city":"Columbus","stars":"3","text":"Slowest.

I can't say that for a lot of other places I frequent.  \\n\\nAdditionally, the service is always prompt and friendly. \\n\\nAs for the actual food... I haven't had everything on the menu, but can recommend the spicy tuna salad or the fried oysters as an appetizer. As for rolls, I typically get spicy tuna, eel and shrimp tempura, which are solid and full-fulling. If you want to splurge the Thai Pham roll is pretty awesome and my favorite of the signature rolls. I've also had the Yummy and Tango Mango roll here which were both good, but didn't leave a lasting impression like the Thai Pham roll did. \\n\\nAlso, not hugely important... but the miso soup here is a step above what I'm used to getting from similarly priced sushi restaurants. It's not anything to write home about, but it also doesn't taste like it came out of a packet - which is oh so common at these type of places.

He had moved to Columbus from Indianapolis just to open this location. \\n\\nTurns out this particular Tuesday was actually just their second night open. I asked how it was possible I was just hearing about this and he explained that they had done no advertising or big announcements of any kind, relying solely on word of mouth. So zealous was I about their presence that the friendly barkeep gave my friend and I a shot of tequila on the house. This was late and the kitchen was closed, but I assured him I would be back for food soon. \\n\\nTurns out soon was the next day. This time the same friend and a few fellow travelers of hers joined us. The place was PACKED. We waited for about a half hour out on the patio, where cocktail waitresses still served us, prior to being seated. When we finally were seated, the food was, as expected, increible. That's Spanish, not a misspelling. The pitchers of margarita are pricey at, I think, $24, but you get a fair amount out of them. We could nearly get two apiece. Those tacos, so darn good.

We were here on business trip. Went for dinner based on reviews..after seated waited over 15 min for any one to even come to table, restaurant was not busy, finally  ordered and they were slooow to bring out order and when they finally did they failed to bring silverware. In fact random server brought food literally dropped it on table and walked away. We waited 5+ min and finally had to get up and go in from patio to ask for silverware at bar.  We got the quadruple meat platter with baby back ribs and lean brisket with Mac n cheese and collards. The food was another let down...Meat tasted boiled with only smoke flavor on outside.  In fact ribs were spongy and brisket tasted like boiled pot roast.  Ongoing service was no better and when we finally got the check and paid one of the waitresses brought out three free app cards. I explained we were from out if town and did not anticipate coming back to area so she could give cards to another customer. All she said was \\"sorry\\"  picked up cards and walked away. Only saw our actual waiter when food was ordered and once as he passed by our table then realized maybe he should check on us so he came back, asked if we were ok and literally left as words left his mouth.

If you're like me and don't have much experience with Brazilian food, then this is the place to start. The food looks less than appealing when it's put in the to-go boxes, but the taste definitely makes up for.

Too hard to resist, we went blazing in the night to the suburban-feeling Kitsilano area to find it nearly vacant at 8PM except for one young family with a couple of overly rambunctious kids. Family friendly is not how I would describe the decor, as the ambiance is darkly Italianate like a ristorante in a Venetian alley. \\n\\nJamie W. and I were seated next to the window facing the small street-side patio. It was nice except for the occasional kid who would bang his forehead on the glass staring at what we were eating. Although the slapstick factor was funny, the resulting bump made the brat scream into the arms of his indulgent, inattentive mother. The salads, both $8.95, were quite good. Jamie went for the classic Insalata Cesare which was gratefully not overdressed (see photo).\\n\\nOn the other hand, I had the Insalata Arugula, quite a busy concoction mixed with juliennes of pear, shaved parmigiano reggiano and pink peppercorn in a honey vinaigrette (see photo). The pasta dishes were pretty good. Jamie ordered the Pasta di Nonno, the pasta of the day, which that evening was a gnocchi mixed with salmon, basil and shaved parmigiano reggiano in a light tomato cream sauce (see photo).\\n\\nI ordered the more traditional Spaghetti Bolognese, although what came out were pasta seashells mixed with minced beef, veal and pork in a red wine tomato ragout and shaved parmigiano reggiano. No real complaint there except the sauce had a slightly overcooked taste. We were sufficiently sated and didn't try any of their desserts which look to be their speciality. Definitely worth a visit for a nice Italian meal in the Great White North.

They come with the deep fried pork belly, which was also good.  I had a dish with pulled chicken and parmesan cheese; the names are a bit tricky for me.  It comes with a side of rice, and the trick to the rice, as my friend Michael P. pointed out, was that they add butter to it, which makes it that much more savoury.  I also had the seafood chowder, which was very generously filled with a variety of shrimp, scallops, and mussels.  Even though it is a bright red, it is not very spicy.  The soup is good, but it is not think like a traditional chowder.  It has a lot of rice, too.  The drink I had was mad of corn, and the name evades me (I'm terrible at this).

At that time, I did not know any good Korean restaurants so I took him to this place, because I constantly walked by this place, and it was the only Korean place that I could think of that was close by. I told him to keep your expectations really low because Korean food in Boston is generally not as good compared to Korean food in Southern California.\\n\\nMy friend got sundubu jigae, (K9) which is a tofu stew with rice. I got japchae (HS6), which was a noodle dish made from cellophane noodles stir-fried in sesame oil. with sliced pork and vegetables. My friend actually thought the sundubu was great. I just thought the noodles were decently good and not really memorable. My friend told me that he really liked the food here, and was really glad he was able to get his Korean food craving fulfilled. If I wrote a review based on my experiences back in 2009, I would have given this place 3 Stars out of 5. \\n\\nI came back again recently with my brother, this time to order another Korean dish, which was Dolsot Bibimbap, while my brother got Ja Jang Myun. Dolsot Bibimbap is a sizzling stone bowl rice dish, with cuts of meat, carrots, bean sprouts, and topped off by a fried egg. It is a fairly popular Korean dish. Ja Jang Myun is a popular Korean noodle dish derived from the Northern Chinese noodle dish of Zha Jiang Mian, which loosely means \\"fried sauce noodles\\" in Mandarin Chinese. This dish is consists of a black bean sauce with fried ground pork mixed with the noodles. Actually, Buk Kyung is supposedly the Korean pronunciation of Beijing, the capital city of China. \\n\\nI really liked the Dolsot Bibimbap. I had to use the spoon provided to keep stirring the rice before it got overly fried by the stone bowl. The egg was freshly cooked, and the vegetables were also freshly good. The spiced sauce they provided put more flavor to the rice, and made the dish even tastier, despite the slight spice in the sauce. I also liked how they provided Miso soup with the dish. I have not found a Korean restaurant in Allston that actually provided soup on the side with a rice dish yet. Miso soup was decently good, it had a good amount of wakame inside. They may not have the best Dolsot Bibimbap in the world, but they can get the job done. \\n\\nI had some of the Ja Jang Myun, and I thought it was tasty. Loved the texture of the noodles, and the saucy flavor. I think it is a good value choice, despite the somewhat high price, but one bowl should get your stomach full. As for the banchan, the traditional Korean side dishes, I thought they were somewhat mediocre, but not terrible. The kimchi was satisfactorily good, the potatoes were tasty, and the eggplant was decent. \\n\\nService was actually effective. We got our dishes in 10 minutes. I liked the t-shirts that the servers wore, I think they said \\"I (heart) ja jang myun\\". One of the ladies who run this place looked really familiar. I heard that owner of this place also owns Myung Dong 1st Avenue, a Korean bar/restaurant that is nearby and open late at night. Interior was a little strange. There was a poster of Park Ji-Sung (a famous Korean soccer player for Manchester United), a poster of Rain (a famous Korean singer), a poster of a lady that looked a little like Hyori Lee (a famous Korean singer/model), and a poster of a famous American 1972 movie called \\"The Godfather\\", which looked out of place out of all the posters I saw. \\n\\nOverall, this is a fairly good choice to get some tasty Korean dishes, and found my dining experiences here to be not bad. This place may not be the best place to get Korean food, but I am fairly confident they can get the job done well and it's a good alternative to Korean barbecue if the other Korean restaurants in the area are crowded."},{"name":"Canton Buddha","address":"2900 Peachtree Rd NW, Ste 115","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3","text":"I live across the street from Canton Buddha, the food is a bit below average for its pricing, if it wasn't right across the street and open late night, I don't think I'd ever think of eating there again.

NY/Naples style pizza with no overbearing toppings or sauce, and not too much cheese so little grease factor.\\n\\nI suggest making your own pizza and go with the individual or large size (The 1/2 Meter comes out in a long rectangular pan and gets a little soggy in the middle compared to the traditional round pie which are the individual and large).  The shareable/family style salad that is avaialble for a minimum of 2 guests eating pizza is a great deal and very fresh.  The soups are all good too.\\n\\nSave room for dessert... the ricotta doughnuts are amazing... and it comes with 10 of them for easy sharing...and a dipping trough filled with chocolate and a side of whipped cream.... oh so good.\\n\\nP.S.

The atmosphere of the restaurant is very casual--with plastic plates and cups and plastic eating utensils, but that was A-OK with me given the festivities of the weekend.  It was refreshing.

First off, they provide free parking permit to park at the lot across the street, which is very convenient. They offer a variety of appetizers and yakitori (Japanese skewers), but the highlight here is definitely the Soba noodles. We ordered a cold soba with Uni (sea urchin) and a hot shrimp tempura soba. The Uni soba was so good!! The Uni is fresh and creamy and the soba is cooked perfectly tasted great with the fish broth. However, I didn't like the hot soba noodle too much as I think it was a bit too soft/overlooked.. The shrimp and veggie tempura pieces were delicious though. \\n\\nWe wanted to try sown toro sashimi (listed on the menu), but the they didn't have it that day :( We also order a green tea ice cream and Japanese cheesecake for dessert.

However, you are at Disney, so what do you expect.  I had the PBJ milkshake.  It is one of my favorite treats in any of the parks.  It is available at 50's Primetime or here at the Tune in lounge.

All the good items I would have ordered contained pork, so know that if you don't eat pork you may want to go elsewhere. \\n\\nI ordered the pickled vegetables which came in two separate bowls, (one pickled cucumbers and the other pickled daikon and carrots), a shirmp bao, and a vegetable bao. \\n\\nSadly the pickled vegetables were the highlight of the food chose. I don't know if I had high expectations from reading the Yelp reviews on the vegetable bao, but I was disappointed in it. The bao itself was nice, but the flavor of the tofu and veggies inside did not stand out for me. The shrimp bao was better than the vegetable bao, but it reminded me more of a petite bo'boy than a food item I would have gotten off the streets ofTaiwan (which is what I thought this was what Ah-Ma was going for) and relished. \\n\\nService was okay. The waiter was patient with my many questions, but I did notice one of the servers took our empty jar of water and never returned. But other than that, no complaints. \\n\\nI might make a return visit one day if there was a reason for me to be on this side of town, but only to see if their beef noodle stands up to others I've had in Atlanta.

My wife loves their cinnamon twists, and the teen boy loves the bear claws. (They do tend to run out of those, FYI.) Their apple fritters are excellent, too. The couple that own the place are very sweet. Often, the wife is behind the counter - she told me once that her husband is the one who gets up ridiculously early to make the donuts.  Their coffee is just basic coffee, so I usually took the donuts home - paired with a nice dark roast, it's a breakfast so good (and yet, of course, so bad)...

There was a steady stream of people in and out, but there was no significant backup. The menus are located at the counter up front, and that's where you order, pay, and pick up your food. \\n\\nTo the left, there's a large area for pitchers, cups, utensils, and water. A guy up front calls your name when your food is ready.  The mic makes every name sound like a variation of the same name, so don't be embarassed if you go up and discover it's not your food. Just don't run off of with it. \\n\\nEverything here is brushed and topped with some kind of oil. The naan had puddles of oil, the saffron rice was mixed with it, my dish lay beneath half an inch of it. I wish I were joking, but I'm not. \\n\\nNaan - Oily, but soft and fluffy. It had some nice crisp spots in the center. \\n\\nAachar Gosht - Very, very oily. Fragrant and aromatic, the sauce had lots of whole garlic and fennel seeds laced through it. BUT, I only had 2 pieces of mutton and about 6 pieces of bone. :( I had envisioned lots of tender, braised mutton and this was quite the letdown. \\nThe food may have been spicy and fragrant, but the oil and lack of meat just doesn't cut it for me.

It's really hard to find this Canadian dish south of the border outside of New Hampshire, but this version was excellent.\\n\\nMy husband had the pot pie, and the chicken pieces were generous, but the crust was too thick for a pot pie. It should have either been delicate and flaky, as one would expect, or a far thinner piece of the dense crust they chose to use. He had to hack through it to get to the actual pie with his fork, stabbing at it repeatedly in order to break it apart.\\n\\nMy lamb burger with red onion, feta cheese and balsamic glaze was delicious. No complaints whatsoever (other than needing a few extra napkins to control the mess I made!). I do take issue with the enormous pickle that took up residence on the plate, as it was the most god-awful tasting pickle I have ever had the displeasure of encountering. To borrow a line from The Oatmeal, it tasted a bit like Poseidon's salty butthole, only it was so vinegary I don't understand how anybody could possibly swallow more than one bite. Disgusting.\\n\\nFor dessert I ordered the S'mores jar, and the presentation is great! Tiny jar with a giant square of marshmallow on top. Unfortunately, it is near impossible to spoon your way through the marshmallow to the actual cake as it quickly becomes a sticky, stringy mess, and once the marshmallow begins to seize - forget it. This could also use some kind of sauce to break up the cake, but since there is almost no way to get to it without a scalpel or X-acto knife...\\n\\nI had heard a lot of issues with the service, which is one of the reasons I wanted to drop in on a Friday night. We had no problem with our server. It was moderately busy, but she always came by at regular intervals, and my husband always had a glassful of water.\\n\\nOverall, I did like the food, and I would not rule it out for a second visit.

Along the ceiling is a geriatric floral border and the landscape paintings that line the walls are forgettable, but tall windows let in loads of flattering natural light and lend an airy feeling to an early morning meal.\\n\\nThis menu is a crowd-pleaser, and a safe bet for even the fussiest foodies. Breakfast and lunch options range from classics like burgers and biscuits and gravy to grilled tilapia, huevos rancheros, and crispy stuffed portabello. I had my heart set on eggs benedict, and this place provides: no less than seven variations grace the menu, including shrimp and steak and even fried chicken, but the Eggs Blackstone was it for me. The grilled tomato fell apart on my fork, the eggs were perfectly poached, and the whole thing was swimming in rich creamy hollandaise and covered in crumbly bacon bits. The only thing that could have made it better was a slice of avocado - and it did.\\n\\nMy husband had the special, a crispy fish and bacon wrap that he crunched on happily between compliments to the chef. We ordered sides of fruit and hash browns to share, and I recommend you do the same. These potatoes are crispy shredded slices of golden brown deliciousness. There's hot sauce tableside (even Sriracha!), but feel free to be stingy - these bad boys are already tasty as is. The fruit cup was smallish but fresh, and added some guilt-free sweetness to the spread.\\n\\nService has always been aces for us, it's a friendly staff and they're quick with the refills. As a two-top we never have to wait long, and they're always accommodating when I request a booth. On my last visit the waitress was pretty and sweet and swift with our orders, you can't ask for much more than that. \\n\\nWith the chinzy decorations and familiar dining cliches, Grand Day can feel a bit like a chain. There's the First Watch-style health nut dishes, the Bob Evans-esque prices and plywood paneling.

The first obvious reason, which took a few minutes to figure out, was that there isn't a coat check (or wasn't on the Tuesday night I went).  Coats were draped everywhere, and the tables are pushed as close together as possible, leading to this chaotic, cramped vibe.  The ceiling is a beautiful cerulean blue, but the schizophrenic dance music they played bounced off of it from every angle and made a half-packed house sound (and feel) like a zoo.\\n\\nThe food was overpriced and too greasy.  Not very authentic on many counts.  I had the fettucelle with shrimp, and it tasted...off.  After a few bites I realized my mouth had the aftertaste of over-chlorinated water.  I think they may boil their pasta in city water, which in the area has a very strong taste.  The shrimp were of decent quality, and the cherry tomatos were good.  We had a few of the starters, gorgonzola cheese with honey, white bean puree, servicable but nothing to write home about.  My fiance ate the marscapone ravioli; they were very creamy and he seemed to enjoy them.  It also took a long time for the check to come, which was strange because at that point 3 or 4 members of the waitstaff were chatting away with each other.\\n\\nIn short, the food is average and the prices are what you'd expect for a restaurant right on the common.

They apparently visit this place all the time and thought that we would love it.  We were a little unsure, as we'd had a strange encounter with Ethiopian food in the past.  We decided that we were game, because after all, you can't let one incredibly weird restaurant ruin a whole cuisine for you, right?\\n\\nWalking in the smell that hit me was something I've come to associate with Ethiopian food.  It's not a good smell, it's not a bad smell.  I guess the best way to describe it would be \\"foreign\\".  I don't know if its the spices they use that fills the air and makes it smell like this, but I haven't smelled a scent like this at any other type of restaurant.  The last Ethiopian place I tried smelled like this, too.\\n\\nAnother thing I noticed when I walked in was that the atmosphere was only slightly less strange than the last place I tried.  This is what keeps this place at 4 stars rather than the full 5 it would otherwise deserve.   Sure, there's no kids sitting on the floor near the entrance, watching TV and doing homework, but it still feels awkward here somehow.  \\n\\nWe were seated in chairs that were cushy and upholstered in a carpet-like material.  I find these chairs to be part of the oddness of the atmosphere, because I feel like I would never see them in any restaurant (or anywhere else for that matter).   After a short wait our drink orders were taken.  Most of the table ordered the ginger juice, while I opted for a Mac & Jack.    We were given plenty of time to figure out what we wanted.  As there was a mix of vegetarians and omnivores at the table, we all opted to just get the vegan platter so that there would be no threat of meaty juices mixing in with the veg dishes, which my girlfriend and I were grateful for.\\n\\nIt took a bit of time for our drinks to arrive, and after a bit of a wait our food arrived as well.   The food was amazing.  Okra, potatoes, lentils, mushrooms...There wasn't a food sitting in front of me that I didn't want to devour like a madman.  If I had to choose a favorite, I'd be split between the mushrooms and the okra probably, but really, it was all amazingly flavorful.  Regardless of how strange I may have found the atmosphere before, the food draws you in so well that you don't even care about what's going on around you.  \\n\\nThis place changed my outlook on the cuisine completely, and since visiting here the first time we've become eager to find reasons to get together for Ethiopian food at Queen of Sheba."},{"name":"Ichiban Bakery","address":"1157 Kenny Centre Mall","city":"Columbus","stars":"4.5","text":"Ichiban is an amazing bakery!

I also tried the shumai, which was very dry. As for the dumplings, they were drenched in excessive amounts of grease. At one point, I gave up on finding anything good and decided to just go with salad, because there's no way that they could mess up salad, right? WRONG.

My partner and I decided to try Habibi after reading the rave reviews here on Yelp.  \\nUpon entering the tiny hole in the wall, we were greeted halfheartedly by what appeared to be a fourteen year old girl who pointed to a couple of seats by the window.  We took our seats and she handed us some dirty menus and walked off to chit chat with what appeared to be Mom and big sister behind the counter.  \\nWe scanned the menus and decided on the lamb kebabs, lamb mezze and majadra.  Underneath ALL of their dinner dishes it states: SUBSTITUTE SALAD FOR TABULI FOR $1.50.  While placing our order the fourteen year old girl said, \\"The lamb mezze doesn't come with a salad or tabuli.  If you want tabuli, it will be $3.00.\\"  We still had the menus in our hands, so we looked and it CLEARLY says right next to it on the menu:  SUBSTITUTE SALAD FOR TABULI.  We went back and forth with her a little and she wouldn't budge at all on this, so we said that we would just pay the $3.00 charge.  \\nAfter she left our table, we had to flag her down again and ask for water.  The customers at the table next to us ordered water for themselves as well.  A few moments later, the waitress delivered our water and kept our glasses full the duration of the meal; the table beside us NEVER got their water even after asking three more times!\\nOur food was brought to us at a very rapid pace.  It was almost like they were trying to rush us through our courses.  The tabuli came first... it was tabuli, nothing special.  Swiftly followed by the majadra and flat bread.  The majadra was horrible, to say the least.  It was dry to the point of being crunchy.  Anyone who has ever had good majadra would know that it should not be crunchy, but should be more on the creamy side.  The bread was nothing special either.  \\nThe main courses arrived about two minutes after the majadra and bread.  They are served on these giant gold leaf platters that are made out of some sort of metal (I believe it may have been copper).  The platters are appealing to the eye, but it made the VERY DRY food taste like the metal that it rested on.  The lamb kebabs and lamb mezza were overcooked.  The lamb mezza tasted like it wasn't lamb at all, but ground beef instead.  The Lamb kebabs were dry and rubbery and very hard to chew.  The dry meat was served on a bed of dry rice that had no flavor other than the metallic taste of the metal platters.  We quickly asked for the check and bid farewell to the poor couple beside us that were still trying to get their water.  \\nThere are other Lebanese restaurants in Portland that will out perform this restaurant on food, service, drinks and ambiance (the decor is god awful and there was no music playing, so all you have to listen to is the three vacuous women gabbing behind the counter).

Reservations are hard to make the day of, so I highly suggest making them right when you buy your park tickets and know when you're visiting the park.\\n\\nThe magic of Be Our Guest is that dining takes place in The Beast's castle, and you order magically appears at your table after you've sat down. When you walk in, you place your order at a touch screen and connect it to either your Magic Band (or you are given a magic rose in the castle). You pay at the station and take your seat. At lunch, you seat yourself. There are three different rooms to dine in, and they're all gorgeous: the ballroom (with snowy window at the back), the West Wing (dark, where The Beast keeps his magical rose), and the Great Hall (with a large statue of Belle in her yellow ballgown dancing with The Beast, and murals of scenes from the movie). There are cast members constantly pushing carts and cleaning the tables. All of the rooms have different tables of various seating, but the West Wing is very dark, so I wouldn't suggest it for those with poor eyesight or kids who are easily scared (my nephew, haha).\\n\\nYour food is delivered according to where the Magic Band/Magic Rose is located in the dining room. That means that person must be at your table for the cast members to find you. The condiments and drinks are self-serve along the wall of the dining room. The utensils are also there, but in a separate cart (It was hard to find them!!). \\n\\nThe lunch menu mostly consists of sandwiches for entrees, although my sister got the braised pork with potatoes and veggies. She loved her food, and the piece I tried was juicy and tender. \\n\\nI ordered the Croque Monsieur: grilled sandwich of carved ham, Gruyere cheese, and fries. The sandwich was delicious, and reasonably priced for theme park food. They give you a lot of fries, but you can substitute your side if you want something else. The bread has bits of hard grain in it which cut up my mouth; it's not bad but I personally don't prefer that texture in my sandwiches.\\n\\nI also ordered the Master's Cupcake: chocolate sponge cake topped with \\"the grey stuff\\". The cupcake is light and not too sweet. The grey stuff is a light whipped cream that has food coloring to make it grey. It's a simple and delicious dessert, although the metallic wrapping was really difficult to tear off. \\n\\nI think the hype to eat here is too much, but I had a great dining experience at Be Our Guest.

It wasn't as flavorful as a lot of brisket I have had and the fat was not worth eating due to it pretty much being just grease as opposed to other places where the fat contains a fair amount of flavor.\\n\\nThe pork ribs were pretty good. I feel like the rub they used had too much pepper in it and kind of made it taste like certain brands of beef jerky. The meat was a little tough on some of the ribs but overall they were pretty enjoyable.\\n\\nThe fries were somewhat between a steak fry and your typical fast food fry. They were pretty good tasting and had nice crunch but I ended up not eating all of them. Their fry sauce was pretty decent.\\n\\nThe mac was your typical mac that you would find at a barbecue place. It wasn't very flavorful and the bacon didn't add to it at all unfortunately.\\n\\nThe corn bread was more flour based than a lot of cornbread(s) you will find at barbecue places which I kind of liked but overall it was not especially impressive.\\n\\nThe service was excellent and we sat down and pretty much got our food right away.\\nAlex was the server.

LOVE LOVE LOVE this place.  I was one of the bazillion who was crushed once they stopped serving brunch on Sunday (gasp, clutching pearls as I type!) so the stars I am giving for this review has everything to do with customer service and nothing to do with my food.\\n\\nI walked into the restaurant at 10:56 AM on Tuesday, December 8. It was the hubby's birthday and he LOVES the salad and soup so I wanted to surprise him with one of his favorite lunches while he was at work. Anyways, the restaurant opens at 11 AM.  It's clearly marked on the door. I knew they weren't OFFICIALLY open so I popped in and let the girl in the front, stocking the drinks, know that I'll gladly wait till 11 AM. She smiled and let me know that was fine.  Knowing that my watch reads 5 minutes slower than my iPhone, I waited until my iPhone said 11:03 AM and I started the walk to the counter. I felt like I had something on my face 'cause the way the same girl was staring at me...I was concerned. As I was walking up, she asked me what time it was. I told her it was 11:04 AM (I walk really slow)...she said oh, we open at 11 AM.  I said, \\"...yep, I know....its after 11 AM.\\"  She then said the craziest thing...\\"well, if you could give us a few minutes, we'll take care of you\\".  My face had to do contortions....alot of them. I then walked past a bubbly lady that was doing some general housekeeping stuff and sat at the first booth next to the beverages.  I waited and I waited and I waited....until 11:16 AM.  This was the time on the TV (CNN was on and there is a clock at the bottom of the screen) and on my iPhone. At 11:16 AM, I was pretty pissed (on the inside only 'cause I hate outwardly pissy customers) and couldn't understand why NO ONE asked me if I was ready, needed anything, ushered me to the front to place my order, etc., so I walked to the front.  The girl who was the talking to me earlier was on the expo line and saw me come up to the register - of which all three still had the CLOSED sign up - and met me there. As she looked at me (with food in her teeth cause she was obviously eating right before...I watched her), she said (get this!!!)..\\"Yes?\\". WWWWWWHHHHHHHAAAAATTTTTT?!?!?!\\n\\nI then said, ummmm are you ready now? She said yep, thanks for your patience, go ahead with your order.  \\n\\nNow let me say this, I am certain the food was good.  It always is.  My hubby didn't complain and was happy to get it - thankfully, Fresh To Order was wise and brought corn chowder back! But geez, when its time to open, you are open for service.  If you aren't ready for service, don't open, or don't open your doors so that people who are ready to order, won't be annoyed when you clearly are focused on enjoying the last few minutes of solitude rather than deal with your first customer of the day.\\n\\nRant over and looking forward to coming in to get my own bowl of corn chowder tomorrow...however, I will be going to the Decatur location.  They are always ready at 11 AM!!!!"},{"name":"Zyka","address":"1677 Scott Blvd","city":"Decatur","stars":"4","text":"I went here yesterday with some friends and was very impressed with this location. \\n\\nThis place felt very authentic upon walking in.

The Chicken 65 is a must have... it was moist, spicy, and perfectly breaded. It was paired with a spicy yogurt sauce. The Tandoori Chicken and Butter Chicken were great as well. The rice is so goooodddd.... savory until that last hint of cinnamonny sweetness! \\n\\nDefinitely a really awesome experience. Good prices for the portions and easy to share with friends and family.

Wonderful fresh made flour tortillas with melted white cheese...and ...my favorite ingredients...but not today. Amazing how one employee can ruin a reliable breakfast stop. Attempted to order my usual 4 item breakfast taco...and I wanted two of them this time. Breakfast tacos are $1.49 for two items and $0.49 for each additional item. That would be $2.47 each ($4.94 plus 0.41 tax = $5.35). She places my order and asks me for $8.02. I ask her why she is charging me an additional $2.67. She tells me that is how the system is charging for the two tacos with four items. I show her on my phone calculator how the math is incorrect. She continues to tell me that is how the system is charging for two tacos with four items. I tell her I have been there everyday this week and have never been charged this amount. She stares at me. I tell her I have never seen her before. She tells me she works weekends (I feel sorry for the weekend crowd if she is overcharging them as well). I asked for a manager to help with the situation and she tells me she is the only one there (she apparently does not know there are people in the kitchen). \\n\\nIt is unfortunate when an employee is left to manage a restaurant alone who does not understand how the register works and cannot confirm that she is incorrectly operating the system. Even a simple math explanation fails to solve the problem. I am now uncertain what to do. When I go back again, and she is there to assist me, I know I will get nowhere with this situation. \\n\\nUnfortunately for me...I went on down the road to find breakfast...as I do not have an extra hour each morning to work through this issue.

I asked whether it seemed strange that a paying customer had no place to eat, while a group of  obvious non payers took up space .

This is a nice little feature that most taco trucks don't offer and certainly makes the experience more comfortable. It does, however, decrease the mobility of the truck and makes me wonder why they even bother with the wheels. Just make it permanent! \\n\\nFinding it is simple enough. It's directly across the street from the non-descript Stumptown roasters (not to be confused with the coffe shop itself) and next to an antiques shop.  \\n\\nMy only gripe is that they are not always open during their posted hours. In fact, the last couple of times I've been there they've been closed. I find this deeply unnerving but I hope it's just because they decided to take off a little early or something.\\n\\nUpdate: I just went back there today and picked up a business card with their hours. Turns out they're not open on weekends, which explains why they've been closed the last couple times I went, just Monday through Friday's, 11 to 7. Also, the tarp has been upgraded and there are corrugated plastic walls so you can eat in a fully enclosed environment.

After spending 3 days at Universal Studios, we needed a place to eat before the 3-hour drive back down to Southern Florida. The location is not very good. It is by far the sketchiest restaurant I've ever eaten at. The building itself was run-down and we had to walk inside to make sure it was even open. There was no wall between the restaurant and the thrift shop next door, so we had the privilege of watching people shop for clothing while we ate (my entire family couldn't stop laughing). The price is very reasonable for the amount of food we could get. Our seats were quite nice (booths) and the table was clean. However, unsupervised kids kept running past us with salad bowls, and one even threw salad onto another kid, making a huge mess. The salad was just greens in separate bowls that you could mix. Classic buffet. The pizza gets an A+. It tasted great and there was a variety of pizzas we could get. My family was pleasantly surprised. The dessert was impressive as well. There's also an arcade in the back of the restaurant which was fully occupied (with screaming children) while we were eating. The drink station was an utter mess, so be warned.

There is not much to say about the overall physical time spent here; it was just okay - maybe we just had bad timing.\\n\\nThe reasoning for my rating is due to being charged twice on my debit card. The drink I ordered was around 13 dollars and looking at my account history I have two separate charges of the same amount from here. They also processed it almost a month after we attended which I thought was weird. My friend also got double charged too. We know this is the bar's responsibility since we were so set on leaving ASAP there is no way we would have gotten more than one drink.

As soon as we were sat it went from a celebration to wtf is this a joke? First off we were sat in a corner right by the stairs which we thought we were thrown to the side. It took awhile for a server to come over and I mean awhile which has never happened before there and the restaurant was not that busy (If you are ever waiting awhile for a server to greet your table trust me when I say it's going to be bad service) A server finally came over with his trainee and it took a nose dive. The trainee was very nice but the trainer kept constantly disappearing. My friend ordered a Corona which was skunked so she sent it back the same with the next one which also got sent back, the mussels were very sandy so we returned those as well. Meanwhile we waited for long periods of time for refills on our drinks, salads and our meals all the while barely being checked on. I like to enjoy my meal and the ambiance there especially for that type of money. You expect a certain level of service and quality of food. I myself am a server so I expect good service I know how I take care of a guest and our treatment was deplorable. Being a server you have good days bad days things can get crazy busy with a million things at once and again it was not busy. So I can be more understanding than non-severs when things take a little longer or there's a mistake, but his meal was just a nightmare. Finally we got a manger involved both the general manager and regular manager came over which was a joke. They acted like they didn't care and didn't do much to rectify the situation. I saw plenty of other severs giving so much better service to their tables that it made me angry. Obviously our server couldn't handle a pick up table on top of his other tables he made that abundantly clear.

Had breakfast here this morning I had \\"The Sandwich\\" with ham, truly regretted that decision. Probably the most boring thing I've ever had. It is only egg, cheese and ham and they weren't lying, that is what it is. No flavor, no seasoning, so boring. My husband got the \\"Brother Bad Ass\\" he really enjoyed that and I had a bite, it was good. Didn't understand the cabbage on it, but the sandwich was tasty, so they get points there. But, that's it. The other item we ordered were their potatoes...wow, the worst potatoes I've ever had in my life. My 9 year old nephew could make better potatoes. First off, they were swimming in oil (I posted a picture), they had absolutely no flavor, they do not add any seasoning, not even a pinch of sea salt or something. They throw a few herbs on it and call it a day,  not enough to add flavor, just so bad. Really the worst part about them was the fact that they were practically raw. They were so under-cooked, a few were crunchy. It seems that root vegetables are not something they do well here, based off another post about squash I was just reading. Needles to say, we did not eat those and threw them away. They should really remove them from the menu. Even though the one sandwich was good, both my husband and I agreed we won't be returning, not worth the price."},{"name":"Pho & Pad Thai","address":"373 Washington St","city":"Braintree","stars":"4","text":"Not a fan, Yelp steered me wrong.

Today the wait staff was very attentive actually bringing my check and debit card to the register for me-- a change from past practice.\\n\\nThe small shop has also undergone a change as has the menu. Gone are the traditional boat service pieces that once adorned a back wall above the eight-seat sushi bar. The bar now has an austere character and new granite or perhaps marble counter.\\n\\nThe sushi/sashimi combination was exquisite with succulent tuna, yellowtail, octopus, shrimp, snapper and spicy tuna roll. It differed from my wife's regular sushi largely by quantity and the fact she had the requisite California Roll. I personally would have expected at least another sushi roll @ $32. Hey, who am I to knock? An order of eel maybe? But the large hot saki is worthy of the title and after two, what's not to like. \\n\\nThe minor lack of variety on the premium plate and the wait staff's over attentiveness almost to the point of nagging is what kept the restaurant under five stars.

The show is corny and fun and the actors are almost always hilarious and on point.  \\n\\nService has always been good to great.  We've actually had the same waitress both times and she's a riot.  Service tends to slow down and disappear though towards the end of the meal.  \\n\\nThe food is decent, typical down south home cooking for 200 of your closest friends.   You can tell that all of it is produced in huge mass quantities (they do 3 shows a day so you can do the math).  Starts off with a VERY basic salad of iceberg lettuce and grape tomatoes that is so overly dressed that the dressing literally drips off the pieces of lettuce on your fork.  The corn bread is good but nothing memorable.  Fried chicken might be the best thing on the menu.  Crispy, juicy, greasy...just what fried chicken should be.  The ribs I wasn't a huge fan of, slightly dry.   Mashed potatoes were made from real potatoes and I probably ate a full bowl on my own.  The vegetables I barely ate, too overcooked and not a huge fan of cooked carrots, which was the majority of the veggies.  As for dessert?  Strawberry shortcake was just ok.  Not sure what everyone is raving about?  \\n\\nAll you can drink sangria and beer is a plus for most people but keep i mind that the beer is normal bud or bud light and the sangria is so sweet it's like a kids grape juice on crack.  No thanks....I'll save my beer drinking for the good stuff at the countries in Epcot and all the other sit down restaurants on property.  Just because it's 'free' doesn't mean it's good.  Oh but the coffee? REAL brewed coffee, unlike the Nescafe syrup crap that is served at all the counter service place.  Glad that all the sit down restaurants at Disney actually brew the real stuff.  \\n\\nSo yeah... slightly harsh review but... it's true.  \\n\\nI'm never completely blown away by the show and definitely not the food so I don't go back willingly.

I have not had authentic French food like this anywhere outside of Europe. Chez Nous really does a five star job all along the way from sourcing the best ingredients, to expert execution and delivery, with impeccable teamwork and service. \\n\\nChez Nous has been open in Austin since February 1982, that's nearly 30 years! They survived the U.S. Recessions of 1980-1982, the early 90's and the Great Recession (2007-present!); impressive, and while just about everything else on the 6th Street strip has turned into something else over the years, Chez Nous is one of the few that is still there, keeping up their old school quality and tradition of fine French dining. ~30 years of stability says a lot about the quality and satisfaction that this restaurant delivers to its customers. For fine European cuisine, this is my favorite restaurant in the Austin area. Great for that perfect dinner when you're in the mood or a special occasion.\\n\\nFor dinner, the menu du jour is a fine deal with a three course meal for $26.50, described as:\\n1) CHOICE OF SOUPE DU JOUR OR SALADE LYONNAISE OR PATE MAISON\\n2) CHOOSE AMONG 3 ENTREES CHANGING DAILY (they also include a side plate of the most delicious grilled vegetables and potato croquettes I've ever eaten.)\\n3 CHOICE OF CREME CARAMEL OR MOUSSE AU CHOCOLAT OR BRIE ($2 more and you can choose from their full desert menu)\\n\\nThe wine list is nice and priced fairly, and they offer delicious, crisp and cold Kronenbourg 1664 (a 5.5% pale lager that is the leading beer in France) for $4 each. They also have an espresso machine to perk you up after the meal, which would go great with any of their deserts.\\n\\nYou start off with the complimentary bread and butter, a basic and an essential, and it couldn't be tastier. Each course seems to be better than the last, while nothing is lacking. The portions are perfect, you will leave happily full and will enjoy a nice walk back to your car, your down town residence, or to a nearby pub. \\n\\nIf you work in the area you may want to check them out for lunch. Don't forget, like many restaurants in town, Chez Nous is closed on Mondays.\\n\\nChez Nous: I love what you offer to Austin. Here's to another ~30 years.

In fact, the waiter (who did say he was new) came back a second time to tell us they didn't even offer lobster risotto, it would have been made with pasta.  This does not explain why we were served something completely different.  I wouldn't go out of my way to go here again but if I did I would stick to the apps which were excellent. The scallops were pretty good but not great.

Some friends took me and my mother out for dinner and they picked Wildfire.  I was excited to finally try it since I have lived across the street from it since the day it opened...plus being taken out for a nice steak dinner is never a bad thing.\\n\\nI was able to make a reservation online for a good dining time on a Saturday night (for 4 people).  We arrived and were escorted to our booth immediately.  Problem was, we got to the booth and the table across from it had a 2 or 3 year old little girl with them and they had put all of her things in our booth (dolls, crayons, etc).  We had to stand and wait for the waiter to hand the belongings to the mother.  While I put this off on the mother mostly - the waiters working the section (on a very busy Saturday night) should have handled it long before someone was taken to the table.\\n\\nSpeaking of which, our waiter was only so-so.  We ran out of drinks (just waters and iced teas) 3 different times and at least once he replaced my unsweetened iced tea with sweetened.  It was quite hard to flag him down once we placed out dinner order.  His only saving grace was that he handled explanation of the menu, specials and different crusting options well.  Otherwise, he was too overwhelmed with tables - because he basically ignored us.\\n\\nThe food, however, was a delight.  We started with the Four Cheese Crusted Portobello Mushrooms with Spinach and the Wood Oven Baked Goat Cheese which had a Tomato basil sauce and wedges of focaccia.  Both were surprisingly delectable.  The mushrooms had such a rich and creamy flavor from the cheeses were nicely cooked.  The goat cheese was devoured in about 5 minutes flat - the sauce was a wonderful addition to the gooey baked cheese.\\n\\nAround the table, the dinner options varied.  I chose the Char-Crusted Ribeye and opted for the mushroom crust.  It was impeccably cooked to medium-rare for me.  I decided I wanted a baked potato on the side - it was world's largest potato ever - seriously it was almost embarrassing.  No human could have eaten it all.  However, they only brought enough butter and sour cream for half of it (good thing since there was no way I could have eaten more than half.)  My mother had the Rainbow Trout with a Lobster Crust - she loved it, but says she could not taste lobster in the dish at all.  I guess there are other items in the crust that overpowered the lobster flavor...that or there wasn't very much lobster in it in the first place.  Our friends went with the Grilled Steak and Blue Cheese Salad (it looked delicious and received compliments) and the Cedar Planked Salmon with a Brown Sugar Soy Glaze (Walton said it was excellent, but it was a tiny piece of fish).  \\n\\nFor dessert (another kudo for the waiter was he convinced us we should get one), we got the trio of mini desserts - key lime pie, Snicker's pie and some third chocolate dessert.  All were yummy, but I am not a fan of the platter of desserts (usually made from some kind of resin) that waiters bring to the table to sell the guests on ordering - they really look unappetizing.  \\n\\nOver all, the dinner was nice (although I nearly died of thirst) and the food was delicious.  I'm glad we had good company to enjoy such a nice meal.  Just consider carefully before you go on a busy night.

Compared to the one in Allston, this particular location is very spacious. The service is great here and the food is absolutely delicious. First look at the menu: they have so many different kinds of appetizers, which is a plus. It ranges from kimbap to yakitori to sushi. Often than not, I find myself going to Korean restaurants with limited appetizers, i.e. no kimbap (which I get upset about), so I was pretty happy when I saw kimbap on the menu! As you flip to the next pages of the menu, you can see that there is a huge selection of soondubus. I literally went crazy and could not pick which one I wanted to order because I just wanted everything. As if there weren't plenty of choices already, you can pick combos along with it and the level of spice you want.\\n\\nAfter a long time of thinking and deciding, I decided to order kimbap and the seafood & beef tofu combo with bulgogi and rice. Everything was absolute perfection. The kimbap is made with spicy tuna. My taste buds were just dancing. The bulgogi was marinated perfectly and it was just SO good I couldn't stop eating it. The portions are pretty big too. It might look small, but with all the meat, rice, banchan, kimbap, and tofu, it will fill you up pretty quickly! Second time around, I ordered the ham and sausage tofu combo with bulgogi. Again, very filling, but so perfect on a cold rainy day. The soup and the tofu is so comforting. It is literally food for your soul.\\n\\nWhat I love about Kaju Tofu House is that everything is just REALLY comforting. It isn't an overly fancy korean restaurant. It's so casual and it's just perfect. You leave this restaurant feeling really satisfied and happy, along with a food coma (but not the terrible kind of food coma). Last but not least, everything is so yummy after re-heating if you have leftovers.

I've always liked hamburgers and am always on the lookout for the great ones, but I've had some time on my hands and decided to try three new places this week.  A few of my fellow food lovers recommended Joe's, so I decided to run to Bridgeport Village, have a burger and catch a movie while I was there. \\n\\nJoe's, at Bridgeport, is in a walk-up kiosk next to the Apple store, and few steps away from the movie theater.  I got the double-patty basic \\"Joe's Burger\\" and a seasonal shake - the Peanut Butter Cup Milkshake.  I'll get to this later. \\n\\nThe most important part of the burger to me is the meat, and at Joe's I think it's just OK.  It had a nice true beef flavor, but they were of the thin pre-formed type. The meat was moist and with their special sauce and all the fixin's, it was a good burger. Not great, but good. I'd happily eat one again. \\n\\nNow about that shake. For full disclosure, I must tell you that I love peanut butter and pretty much anything made with peanut butter will get my votes. This shake was really, and with the bits and pieces of peanut butter cups floating around the shake, it was one tasty treat. As I neared the bottom of the glass, I couldn't very well suck the bits and pieces up the straw, so I just popped off the lid, tipped my head back and let the last bits of shake and peanut butter cup pieces fall into my mouth. Heavenly!\\n\\nIf you are in Bridgeport Village, then Joe's is a good place to grab a burger, if you are hankering.

Don't go here if you want to be treated with RESPECT by your server. \\n\\nI had high hopes for this place since I love Italian food, and another member of our group had been to the North End location and recommended it. Our party of 4 arrived at 6pm on a Saturday and were promptly seated without a reservation-awesome. From there it was downhill. I was catching up with a friend I hadn't seen in a couple years, and from the minute we sat down the server was hounding us every couple of minutes asking what we wanted to order. Once we decided (after being asked for the 6th time) we had a couple questions on the menu. I am vegetarian and my fianc√© is vegan. While my fianc√© was in the middle of asking a question the server just left our table and didn't come back for about 5 minutes. Once she came back, I ordered a dish that had linguine, some vegetables, and shrimp. I asked to substitute the shrimp for mushrooms or if I could order the dish without it. The server started at me blankly and said in a rude tone \\"No. Why would you want to do that, it changes the flavor of the dish. Why don't you just order some pasta?\\" (Which is exactly what I was trying to do..) My fianc√© jumped in and asked if she had some recommendations that didn't include meat or cheese since we did not eat meat and and he doesn't eat cheese and she seemed appalled by us asking for any substitutions. She again stared at us blankly and said \\"No. This is an Italian restaurant.\\" She finally said she would ask the chef if he could make a substitution even though it wouldn't taste right. \\nWhen our food arrived, I was extremely underwhelmed. Neither my dish nor my fianc√©es dish had any sauce or seasoning--was basically some bland noodles slapped together with some veggies. The other two in our party didn't have much more appealing looking dishes. Once we were finished the server never asked if we wanted to see a dessert menu, she just brought the check assuming we wanted a single check even though we were clearly two couples. Rather than ask her to go back and split it; we put in two cards and asked her to put two items on one card and everything else on the rest. She told us she wasn't sure if she could do that because of the tax (?) and she would have to ask her manager. She came back and ran the check as asked but proceeded to lecture us that in the future we needed to tell her ahead of time (which we would have done if given any indication we were about to be rushed out with the check). \\nNeedless to say I will not be returning."},{"name":"Beulahland","address":"118 NE 28th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Such a cool bar!!!!

Foods that I'm used to seeing because of my ethnicity; Thai dishes, such as Panang Curry (chicken curry), and sweet-sticky rice dessert crepes. I didn't choose those dishes because they would have needed to be more than spectacular to earn a great review from me. I tried my best to not be subjective from the get-go, so I took a different route. I chose one savory crepe, barbecue pulled brisket, and one sweet crepe, caramelized pear. Between my friends, they ordered the rotisserie chicken crepe, the berry delight, and a Nutella filled crepe topped with ice cream. I managed to sample all of these except the rotisserie chicken, but for the purpose of this review I'll focus on the two dishes I ordered. \\n\\nCrepes Mille did a great job on presentation; all of the dishes above were served on thin paper plates and looked very appetizing. They would look even better on white ceramic plates if given the opportunity. On that note, it's also important to have your flavors well-balanced to compliment the plating. With that aspect in mind, Crepes Mille was mediocre at best.\\n\\nThe barbecue beef brisket was a great idea for a savory crepe, however, the execution of the dish was slightly disappointing. The meat inside the crepe did have some flavor but it was masked by the dryness of the meat. The sauce on top of the crepe tasted like your standard barbecue sauce and it probably would have served a better purpose inside the crepe to help give it a little moisture. Cutting into the crepe and trying to get a decent bite size also became a challenge because of the fibrous meat. In this case I think that a finely chopped beef or thin slices of brisket would've served as a better filling than the pulled beef. The actual crepe that wrapped the beef lacked flavor and could have easily been fixed with maybe a little more salt and sugar in the batter. As I stated earlier, the idea behind this dish was a great one but the execution of it needs a little tweaking. A little more barbecue sauce on the side would have greatly been appreciated and needed. \\n\\nThe next dish I tried was the caramelized pear crepe. I love caramelized fruits such as pears, peaches, and apples. The cooking of these fruits brings out their natural sweetness that balances well with a slight acidity tone. After all, who doesn't enjoy a bit of sweet and sour together. This crepe was topped off with a caramel sauce and whipped cream sprinkled with inklings of corn flake. My first bite surprised me a little with its sweetness. I made sure not to get any caramel sauce the second time to see if it was the caramelized pears inside the crepe that were overpoweringly sweet; indeed they were. The next couple of bites I incorporated the whipped cream with the pears and it helped tone down the sweetness a bit. Some might enjoy this and even make a case that a dessert is supposed to be super sweet but I'm going to make a case that a little acidity and a little bit less sweetness would've made this dish almost perfect. The caramel sauce looked great on the plate but I didn't need anymore sweets to add to this dish so I could have done without it. The whipped cream was too small of a serving for me since I needed a lot of it to try to tone down the sweetness. The corn flakes on top of the whipped cream added visual appeal but nothing constructive, taste-wise, to the dish. \\n\\nTo recap our visit to Crepes Mille I want to start off by saying that these dishes we tried weren't too bad. Each of them could use a little tweaking or maybe even tasting prior to being served. These are all easy fixes that can be done, if made aware. Now that I've thought about it, maybe I should have tried some of the Thai flavored crepes. I might do that on our next visit but that probably isn't going to be anytime soon.\\n\\nFor other reviews or recipes check out http://bistro331.blogspot.com"},{"name":"BC Sushi","address":"2126 W Broadway","city":"Vancouver","stars":"2.5","text":"Came here for late night with some buddies.

BOMA is a prime example of this rule, and also an example of buffets done oh-so-right. To get to BOMA, I take a bus from downtown Disney to Disney's Animal Kingdom lodge. It takes time, but BOMA is more than worth it.\\n\\nNever had African food? A lot of it is sweet. Kids will love this stuff, and if they don't, there's plenty of fried chicken and macaroni and cheese for them over in the kid's section. If you're like me and want some mac and cheese anyway, grown-ups can dig into that too, but of course you'd be missing out on hundreds of other flavors that BOMA has to offer. \\n\\nBOMA will overwhelm you, so try to start out with really small portions of everything that looks interesting to you. Once you discover what you really like, go back and get more. There's no way you can go to this restaurant and try everything you want, so do what you can to make the most of the time you have there. Eat slow and prepare to spend a LONG time there. As others have mentioned, this is the perfect place to bring a vegetarian, but worry not, there's plenty of great meat to be had, too. (Actually, there's plenty of everything.)\\n\\nIf you try nothing else at BOMA, try the soups. There's several different kinds of soup out at all times, and they're amazing. I also highly recommend grabbing some pitas and trying out the various types of hummus. Because this is ethnic food, you'll probably bite into at least one thing that you're not terribly fond of, but there's going to be a lot more that you love. \\n\\nZebra Domes. They are sort of BOMA's legendary dessert. (They have alcohol in them, though. Don't eat too many!) You have to try them at least once. Some people say they aren't all they're cracked up to be. I think they're a slice of heaven.\\n\\nThe service here, like at many other places in Disney, is top notch.

This was my first time sitting on the bar.  I had a few margaritas, which were tasty.  Sometimes the margaritas at El Azteca can rub me the wrong way but there was none of this on Monday.  I had my usual of salsa, cheese dip (no jalape√±o), and a side of ground beef-- I like to mix them together.  I had no complaints with my food.  As usual, the cheese dip was great, which is one of the reasons why I keep going back to El Azteca.  It also doesn't hurt that they participate in the Delta's Skymiles Dining program, which costs absolutely nothing!  I was disappointed with the bartender.

In Allston, the service is terrible, they don't ever check up on you, or refill waters, so I don't understand why the cups are tiny. The only time they pay attention is when you pay.

Orders were forgotten or mixed up.  People got their dishes at different times casuing others to wait before eating.  The bread basket was not refilled,  decaf espresso turned out to be the real thing, keeping me up all night, etc. etc.  The waiters were clearly inadequately trained for handling a group of this size.

Medium-sized, but with various compartments (and even at least one private room) that add to the intimacy. Music seemed a mix of both domestic and international ambient-type stuff that fit in well with the interior--not too loud. I can't imagine giving anything less than 5 stars for the vibe. Dim lights with teal, brown and maroon colors.\\n\\nFood: I got these croquettes that were a hybrid of Brazilian and Indian food--this is mostly a fusion place. I normally don't like fusion food, but these really, really good. The hamburger, however, was too overbearing because no vegetables were used to \\"lighten the mood\\"...you're simply bludgeoned with meat and gouda cheese...too rich. The menu changes a lot, so keep that in mind.\\n\\nMy gin cocktail was wonderful...still thinking about, and I'm comparing it to great cocktails had in Chicago and NYC. Also a pretty solid wine list with even some dessert wines.\\n\\nService: So this is the area that keeps The Consulate from getting 5 stars from me. First, let me state that everyone was nice and trying real hard, so I think this may be more an issue of organization and strategy than attitude. Also, the person I had was new (and made a point of saying so, which was annoying), and I'm not sure if I can say if she was all that \\"sharp.\\" The server at the table next me, however, was very sharp--anyone that can use the word \\"varietals\\" effortlessly and correctly when talking about the wine list is good at what they do. The biggest issue I noticed, though, was once the bartender made a drink, it would stay at the bar for a while until it was communicated to the server that it was ready to go to the customer. This process repeatedly took longer here than it takes at most places. Also, I'm certain I was brought the wrong wine since the dessert white wine I ordered was, well, a red.  \\n\\nOverall: Some hits, some misses, but the misses generally pertained to service issues that can be rectified (mainly by smoothing out communication between staff). I would actually come back here again since the interior and vibe were great, my first dish was really good and my first cocktail was great. I'll end by saying that I would prefer to see The Consulate succeed because I do feel that Atlanta's dining scene is better with it than without it."},{"name":"Pine State Biscuits","address":"3640 SE Belmont St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"I didn't even mind that my arteries were hardening with every bite.

Complete with flat screen TV blaring loud music videos?  And with bright bright lighting.  Well this is a step below, and without the charm or energy.  For a newly opened restaurant (1 week old) I am amazed how poorly set up it is.  Beyond that.. let's get to the food.\\n\\nWe ordered the combo sampler for 2.  At first glance $32.99 seems like it could be a bit pricey.. but let's see what we get for our money (~$16 per person).\\n\\nTHE FOOD WAS COLD.  Of 9 items which should be served hot, only the yellow looking lentil dish was properly heated.  The rest were barely warm.\\n\\nHow did it all taste.  Not bad at all.  However the salad tasted like it had Italian dressing that had gone slightly bad as if the salad was pre tossed and sat around for way too long in hot weather.\\n\\nServing size.  It comes on a huge plate, but there really isn't that much food.  More suitable for 1 1/2 people or one large guy lol.  Trust me, you've eaten more food at a Indian buffet the second you finish your 2nd plate.\\n\\nSo for $32.99.. that is really stretching it.  I mention Indian food because the flavor profile is similar for some of the dishes.\\n\\nI would strongly pass on this restaurant.  The price simply does not match the quality or portion size of the food.

I suppose she was right, but I still wanted my spicy stuff spicy, dammit! \\n\\nOne complaint I have with the food, and this is probably specific to ethiopian food and not the restaurant itself, is that since you eat it with your hands and the injara, it isn't served especially piping hot because, of course you don't want to burn yourself.  I just like my -hot- food -hot- and my cold food cold.  Also, I guess I'm not a huge fan of eating with my hands.  It's messy and not all that fun for me.

Finally, a simple solution to pancakes---cornmeal!!! Another one not to miss is their hash browns--they spread them out like a pancake so they are very crispy and take up the whole plate---mouth-watering!  Plus, wash all those carbs down with Stumptown coffee!  Yum!!!!  Definitely a fun place to visit and much more comfy than the SE location---way too small, crowded, and BTW--that location doesn't offer the blueberry cornmeal pancakes!!!

I normally don't dig soft shell crab but it's so good I could get another at Kurumucho.\\n\\n-Beef Taco (4/5): Can't remember the price but it was more than the average you'd pay for a taco and it's reasonable since their taco's are a bit bigger in size. They also load it with beef slices which makes up for the extra cost. Having said that it's a bit difficult to hold and bite. I'd suggest eating some of the fillings first. \\n\\n-Chicken Karaage (2.5/5): Been eating quite a lot of chicken lately and this one did not impress. It wasn't the battered enough and had barely any coating. The dip that it came with wasn't very tasty either.

MoPac, and I found them both to be... welll... mighty fine! So I'll say the same things here I said there. \\n\\nI order my burger medium rare, a little pink in the middle, and get my burger medium rare, a little pink in the middle. And it is very juicy and very tasty and I love that i can get it exactly the way I like it. It's gotten very hard to get a burger the way God intended them to be eaten ever since everyone got so scared of Mr. E. Coli. \\n\\nMy grandfather was a butcher, and when he brought home hamburger, fresh ground from lean chuck, it had to be eaten the same day he ground it or he would throw it out. In those days nobody got sick from \\"undercooked\\" hamburger. In fact, sometimes we just mixed in a bit of raw egg (pre \\"salmonella\\" days, too) and some chopped onion and ate it tartare style on toast. \\n\\nMighty Fine has captured a key secret of the old, golden days, and grinds their meat fresh daily, right out in plain sight, where you can watch them do it. So there is no need at all to have them cook your burger until it is dry and tasteless, like the places that serve hamburger ground and formed into patties at far distant processing plants in the far distant past. If you get a dry burger at Mighty Fine, it's probably your fault for having them overcook it. But if not, and if you think it is overcooked by mistake, they will remake a fresh one for you in a heartbeat. You just have to ask. \\n\\nYes, the lights ARE too bright, and when busy the place can be a zoo, but the friendly, family buzz can also be a turn on if you just relax and let it wash over you and carry you downstream. \\n\\nCoolest thing about Mighty Fine I discovered at Brodie lane, but that nobody has commented on? They have a high tech handwashing and drying setup in the dining room.  I think every restaurant everywhere should offer. First, notice that it is outside the restrooms, so there are no worries about picking up fresh germs on your clean hands, from the door handles, on your way out of the restroom. Second, you can put your hands as far into the whirpool wash unit as you like, so you can even get your elbows squeaky clean, if you feel the necessity. Third, the high velocity air blade dryer ensures that your hands get really dry and don't pick up any new germs from contact with damp towels. And it certainly inspires MY confidence in their food that they require all employees to use it before returning to work. \\n\\nIn other words, the burgers at Mighty Fine are cleaner and more wholesome than your hands are when you walk in the door, so scrub up, and stop worrying about how safe the burgers are. No reason to be uptight here. \\n\\nAnd yes, yes, the mid-sized crinkle cut fries (not shoestrings) are great, if a tad prominent on the peanut oil taste, and the trimmings are generous and fresh, and the hand dipped old fashioned Blue Bell ice cream milkshakes are a time capsule in themselves, and the tart lemonande is fresh squoze, although I tend to favor ordering an icy Shiner Bock to go with my Mighty Fine burger . \\n\\nAs for the few other items on the very limited menu, yeah they serve chili dogs and some other stuff, but who cares? Why even go there? That's like going to Ruth's Chris Steakhouse and ordering a salad. This is a good old fashioned Burger and Fries and Milkshake restaurant, by God, and a Mighty Fine one it is, so order a burger and fries and the beverage of your choice and ENJOY IT!"},{"name":"Chin Chin - Howell Mill","address":"1715 Howell Mill Rd, Ste C-16","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3.5","text":"So I've ate here before a few years ago at the old location and didn't like the food.

Nothing like the famous Taiwanese version. Very thinly sliced beef and small portion of it. And the soup had no flavour was like tasting boiled water scented with coriander. Want to like this place.

The decor is very quaint, with brick walls and small tables.  While they have great coffee/lattes and breakfast foods (esp. the egg sandwich), their sandwiches are what they are known for.  The sweet potato, apple, and avocado, as well as the Crema Grilled Chicken (chicken, corn, avocado) are probably the most popular, although the Fig/Brie is also very good.  Their baked goods are also always fresh and unique, different from the typical fro-yo and cupcakes that people usually get in the Square."},{"name":"The Locus","address":"4121 Main Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4","text":"This is my best discovery this year so far for brunch. I discovered that place using yelp and took my wife there. I went to that place 2 times.\\n\\nFirst, the staff welcome you like you are at home.\\n\\nThen, just after getting a coffee, they give 3 different kinds of bread along with 2 flavoured butter. The taste of these bread is fantastic and the butter taste great . I would definitively buy a multigrain loaf of that kind of bread. Seriously, I like bakeries and that bread is better than our good bakeries.\\n\\nThe southwest omelet is great. It come with great hash-browns and a few fruits. The waffle is excellent and it is a bit crispy.\\n\\nThe service is also excellent.

I ordered the breakfast pie and an espresso, my boyfriend ordered the turkey and avocado sandwich. His sandwich comes with a \\"salad\\" that is literally a pile of spinach with strawberries. The sandwich was just what it says it is. Bread, basic turkey, and avocado nothing else. The place feels kind of stale to me, it smells like cleaning products. My pie was good but I hate that you need to order more than one to not be hungry anymore. I also really hate when bakeries and places have fridges and they look so sad and empty and all the food looks stale which is what this place looked like. The food wasn't BAD but it wasn't really good either? I'm not sure what to review this place because I hated the atmosphere and display, but the food was priced at what you get, and the barista gave me a free shot of espresso, but I'm still soooooo hungry and angry and now I am looking for somewhere else to eat lunch again."},{"name":"Thai Fresh","address":"8409 SE Division St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Great Thai Food.

When I got home with my take out, I was surprised to see this disc of crunchy noodles with a tupperware of saucy pork to go with it.  I know it's just ignorance on my part, but it was pretty funny trying to figure out how to eat it!\\n\\nWe did notice that the plain rice we got with the General Tso's chicken was not short grain rice or sushi rice.

Yes, it was taken off the bill, but our whole meal should have been free. \\n\\nThat being said, my parmigiana was fantastic! Every bite was incredibly delicious--if only I could have eaten it all!

I have not found another pizza like it anywhere else yet, and if you know of one, PLEASE TELL ME.  The crust is deliciously chewy and smokey.

However, I would definitely order them at the level 2 spice to get any flavor out of the dish. I also tried some Kung Pao chicken my second time there and that was pretty good, but I would probably ask the waiter for more sauce as the chicken was a bit dry. The hot and sour soup that comes with lunch entrees tastes fresh and delicious. I think the lunch prices are really good here with the noodles only being 7.95 including soup and a side of kimchi. The dinner prices looked a bit more on the expensive side, so I'll probably just stick to lunch dishes. The bathrooms and restaurants are very clean.

I had Bacon and Jalapenos on mine.  I understand an upcharge for bacon, but the japs I think shouldn't be extra.  My first visit, I ordered the 1/2 lb burger and fries.  The burger was good, but I learned fast and ordered the 1/4 lb burger on my second trip, as the 1/2 was too much meat for me, bun/meat ratio wise.  The fries were ok, but were made alot better with the Lawry's seasoning salt provided on the table.  \\n\\nIn 3 visits, I finally ordered the chopped chili hot dog.  It looked sooo good, but upon consumption, was rather plain.  I wished the chili had some kick to it, or that the hot dog was juicy..  but it was neither.  The bun was also the standard 6 incher.  I think Sonic's chili-cheese coney has them beat hands down.\\n\\nOne other interesting fact is that the men's restroom has see through glass into the dining room.
