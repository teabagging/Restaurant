All things being equal, we would have gone toSantouka since it is our favorite in Los Angeles, and quite frankly, the best ramen we have ever tasted. But everyone here was going on about Kintaro, and if there was a line at that place, then this one was suggested as a worthy backup. Plus, one reviewer said it was roomier than Kintaro so we went for it. Big mistake. \\n\\nFirst of all, as we passed by Kintaro we noticed that there was not a line at all, but the ambience was decidedly dumpier (which is usually a good sign) but it was not all that much larger than our destination. Still we soldiered on to Motomachi. Big mistake.\\n\\nThe first warning sign should have come when we were seated next to the front door. Granted, this a great way to cool your soup, but it's not very comfortable to have a chilling blast of air and people brushing by you every few minutes. In fact, it's really annoying. \\n\\nThen came the ordering. There was only one ramen dish with spicy miso broth (my favorite), but it was served with chicken in it, so I asked to get it with pork in it instead. \\"No,\\" was the reply. Okay, well what about all these extra toppings on the menu? Can I order the pork and throw it in there? :Again, I was denied. So I went ahead and ordered the  spicy miso with chicken and a side order of barbecued pork, along with some kim chee. When they weren't looking, I tossed in some of the pork slices and hoped I would not get thrown out. Obviously, I was in the mood for living dangerously. Whoopee! My wife ordered the same thing and while she could tolerate the broth, she felt the ramen was undercooked. I held back on the broth with the intention of combining it with the wife's for the perfect leftovers. But I was getting thirsty. Where was that Diet Pepsi I had ordered? When I asked, they acted like it was the first time she ever heard of Diet Pepsi. Okay, it happens to everyone. Just like it's normal for a restaurant to not have any kind of sweeteners for tea--or anything else for that matter. No sugar, no sugar substitute, that's normal right? Uh, wrong. And weird.\\n\\nWith the door opening and closing every three minutes, we decided we would take the soup with us and finish it at the flat. But when it came to packaging the leftovers, we were informed that there were no containers to take the soup with us. The kim chee? Sure, they had a container for that, and for the pork, but nothing for the soup. Sigh. We decided not to take anything with us and just get the hell out of there.\\n\\nSo much for the service. The ramen itself? Not the worst I've had, but certainly not the best, especially when compared to Santouka. So I would not recommend this place, but we will be trying its competition up the street as well as the Vancouver Santouka, so an update is imminent."},{"name":"Bagel Palace Deli & Bakery","address":"2869 N Druid Hills Rd NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3.5","text":"I lived in Atlanta from 2002 to 2005 and man do I miss bagel palace!

Unless you order an al pastor taco at Anna's you get a boatload of crap all over it. this is not a taco, its a small unwrapped burrito. This won't ever be a problem at Felipe's unless you want it to be.

Looks like they have 'meet the brewer' nights with local brewmasters- also pretty cool.  Decor is sparse, but so what?  Have another beer.\\nThe food though is where stars start dropping off.  The steamed mussels appetizer was really good, but both entrees fell short.  Beet gnocchi for one was an inventive idea, but way too creamy, and the special fritatta fell short of being 'special'.  Even more than just mediocre food was that they were pretentious about it- I asked for ketchup with my fries - let me make that clear- all I asked for was Ketchup with my French (or American if you prefer) Fries, and was balked.  A nose crinkle- was I sure I wanted that vile sauce?  After I assured my server that I was indeed sure that I wanted Ketchup with my Fries, she did bring it, but was markedly colder to us after that.  I mean, wtf?

Nice selection, but our waiter did not know how to remove the foil from the bottle, poured it over the aluminum -- and then joked about the fact that he screwed up. \\nHe also poured glasses worthy of an all-you-can-drink event in Atlantic City. \\nAnd no, he never came back to pour more wine.\\n\\nThe food:\\nPizza from a stone oven sounds good, and their dough is good. But more is less. They put so many of their ingredients on the pies that the two varieties we tried were soggy beyond redemption. \\n\\nNot a single staff member of those who served us could pronounce the wines, the names of the dishes on the menu, let alone the word \\"espresso\\" properly.\\n\\nThe kicker:\\nAs we commented and complained our way through the dinner, the people at the neighboring table and a second couple at the bar chimed in, saying the pizza was definitely not even remotely Italian, that the service left a lot to be desired, and that the management did not pay attention to these deficits.\\n\\nWhen we talked to the manager, he quickly shifted from apologetic to hostile and denied that Mezzo is a \\"fine dining\\" establishment since the average check only runs in the $30 range -- as if lowering expectations were an excuse for having badly trained waiters. One look at Mezzo's press release, dutifully reprinted in local papers and websites, and you know he's copping out, as it's described as an Italian place allegedly filled with \\"spontaneity, fun and Italian lifestyle.\\"  Oh well...\\n\\nIn summary: \\nIf you want to show off  a wine list as thick as a small magazine and sell dishes which sound nice in a fancy setting, make sure the staff knows what you're selling, how to pronounce it, how to serve it -- and please respond to customer complaints while you still have the chance to win them over!

Dip 'em in some ranch and they're scrumptious!\\n\\nThe cheese bread is only $4.99 and it's a huge pizza basically with no sauce (I never get sauce on my pizza anyway)  So it's a bargain!\\n\\nI like the lunch options- salads are always fresh, the mini-taco pizzas are delicious, and for the price of chicken strips and fries, you can't get any better, hotter, fresher than here!\\n\\nPlus, I've never been charged for sauces, and that's awesome!  I hate when places charge for sauces, especially when you serve so many dippable things!\\n\\nCons:  \\nWe tried to order 2 orders of wings on a gameday, and were told we could only order 1 order.  What's the purpose of this?  If you know there's a game coming up, stock up better, or serve what you have and either go buy some more at the albertsons across the parking lot, or tell people you're out.  But don't limit paying customers on the assumption you'll sell out later, that's just bad business!\\n\\nWhen I first started coming here I always got 10 mozzarella sticks, I always got a side salad with my chicken strips and fries, and a large amount of fried pickles when I ordered them or fries with my strips.  Now the amounts have started to vary.  Sometimes I get 8-9 sticks, I don't get salad with my lunch strips anymore, the fried pickle and french fry amounts given have dwindled...and well that just sucks.  I want to know that what I'm getting will be the same ever single time I come.\\n\\nThe pizza crust is a little too thick/dense/biscuit like.  It's just not very good.  It needs to be thinner with more yeast...this is why I don't order pizza at this pizza place often, I'm reminded every time I get a mini, why I don't get a big one!\\n\\nOther than these few things that can be approved upon easily, my only other suggestion I have for this place is to serve larger containers of dipping sauces.  Instead of having to pour 10 individual ranch cups for times like gamedays where people get an assortment of apps, just pour a small soup cup worth, or something... less time, less waiting, less waste."},{"name":"Sweet Cheeks Q","address":"1381 Boylston St","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"Had dinner and drinks to pregame a concert and enjoyed every bite! \\n\\nI had a 'dollywood' to drink - very yummy.

The bowl came with a trio of square shot glasses with fresh chopped cucumber, tomato, and onions to add to the soup.  Unfortunately, the broth had an overpowering flavor of balsamic vinaigrette that make the dish way too acidic. Not inedible, but not to my liking.\\n\\nPortabella Mushrooms: healthy slices of portabella mushrooms came in a buttery sauce with crustinis.  The flavors really popped, and it was a nice salty, gooey, crunchy dish.  Great for dipping with the extra bread.  One of our favorite dishes of the night.\\n\\nSeafood pasta: not what we were expecting.  The linguine was chopped into little 1-in slivers. The flavors were sort of indistinct, with no real sauce to speak of.  The seafood itself was very well cooked, and the chef preserved each shellfish's natural flavors.  \\n\\nDessert:\\n\\nMolten chocolate pudding: came with a dollop of homemade whipped cream.  Very hot in the bottom of the cup, so be careful to let it cool a little before eating.  If you're a chocolate lover, go for this one.\\n\\nPastel Vosco: Sliced banana with a caramel sauce drizzle over a thick chocolate tart -- and of course, whipped cream.  This was absolutely divine.  All the flavors and textures complemented one another.  I'm going to be fantasizing about this dessert for a while....\\n\\nOverall, the evening had its pluses and minuses.  The excellent service made up for the minor atmospheric inconveniences. The food had its strong points and weak points, but reflected an overall standard of quality.

Fresh fish is a basic requirement of any sushi restaurant and Sinju definitely falls short. The service is no better. It's perpetually slow and the waitstaff is borderline rude.

Judging by the insane lines I had always seen wrapped around this popular dining destination, it was a smart move.  \\n\\nThe entire establishment was spotlessly clean, from the glass to the parking lot to the floors and restrooms to the seating and tables.  CLEAN.  And this not more than an hour after the lunch rush.  After every diner left their table, an attendant systematically wiped down their seats and dining surfaces with a mild chlorine solution that was still strong enough for me to smell from the booth across the aisle.  The courteous staff were all friendly and actually smiled and asked how they could assist us throughout the time we were there, but not intrusively so.  \\n\\nWe ordered the signature chicken sandwiches and fries with milkshakes and a couple of dipping sauces (they have many).  My fellow diner ordered her sandwich without a bun wrapped in lettuce.  The sandwiches were enclosed in a little skirt that caught all of the stray juices--a detail which made a big difference.  The food was fresh, hot and of an extremely high quality that did not taste like fast food.  I normally avoid chicken because it is nearly always overcooked, overseasoned or even rancid.  This over-the-top wonderfully juicy chicken was perfectly prepared with a delicately fresh flavor.  The sealed packages of tasty dipping sauces only enhanced the meal--they would make the food of several Chick-fil-A competitors much more palatable if I'd had the presence of mind to save some for later.  There was a thoughtfully provided basket where you could drop off any unused dipping sauces.  The milkshakes were also extremely good and definitely made of real ice cream--very rich and flavorful.  \\n\\nThe dining area was well designed with translucent glass panels around the booths to separate you from your diners on the other side--an attractively efficient use of space that kept the well-lit area from feeling too small or dark.  I took the time to thank one of the staff who was cleaning across from me--I was that impressed with the whole operation--and I filled out a glowing comment card.  \\n\\nNo wonder the place is always so busy.  Next time I'm out there on a weekday, it's my lunch spot for sure.  Other times, I haven't been able to get into the parking lot or drive-thru."},{"name":"Lure","address":"1106 Crescent Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"First time visit - really enjoyed it.

On the email it listed my account number and said I would receive the card soon.  It did not arrive within the time period promised or before my party.  \\n\\nMy 11 friends joined us and when I presented the email to the lady at the front desk she said they would not honor the rewards because I did not have the \\"Official\\" card.

While not the best food in the world Kobe's is always consistent and fun.  A shame the food was overshadowed by the attitude of management at the Kirkman Road location.  As I mentioned earlier our parties had spent over $2K dollars at Kobe's in the past year.  I am mystified they would choose to lose this amount of business over a $30 birthday reward.  I contacted their corporate office and was told they would check into the situation with the district staff and local management.\\n\\nEventually the \\"official\\" card came in the mail (I am guessing it was slow since it was the holidays) and I returned it to them.  A shame that a business I had previously enjoyed did not see the benefit of having effective policies in place to deal with exceptions such as the mail system or enough concern to take care of a return customer.

I was debating between Motomachi, Marutama and Santouka, with the latter closed the whole time that we were in the city (due to a fire from what I read).\\n\\nWe went to check out Motomachi Shokudo on a late Friday evening and the place was packed. It probably doesn't help how tiny this ramen's digs are. It can fit at most 20 people so wended up having to wait patiently while wafts of ramen broth tantalized our taste buds. Even crazier is the ramen shop a few paces down, Kintaro Ramen, had an even bigger lineup outside the door. Good for them though (apparently, they are owned by the same owners). Wish I could have tried a few more ramen shops but this was the one and only during my trip. Super sad, I know.\\n\\nWe were given the table right of the entrance, which unfortunately was the coldest spot to sit at, with the constant opening and closing of the main door. But that's easy enough to fix - just eat more ramen.\\n\\nWe were really hungry by then so we ordered extra noodles ($1.00 extra) for all of our ramen bowls:\\n- Petit BBQ pork rice bowl ($3.30) - nothing fancy but just like it sounds. A small rice bowl with BBQ pork, marinated vegetables, and Japanese mayo on top.\\n- Butchigiri gyoza ($4.50) - another appetizer while we waited for our ramen. You get five pieces and they tasted like every other gyoza I've had.\\n- Bamboo-charcoal dark miso ramen ($10.55) - this was my bowl and I was intrigued with the bamboo-charcoal factor. Ordering extra noodles definitely was a mistake (don't do it!). As for the broth, it was different than any other ramen I've had previously. Everything in the bowl was done well but nothing blew my mind. It was solid, but I was expecting more for Vancouver standards.\\n- Nama shoyu ramen ($9.55) - my mom's bowl which she enjoyed. I had a quick sip of the broth and it tasted light, not too salty.\\n- Spicy miso ramen with organic chicken ($10.50) - I sampled a bit of my dad's bowl and the broth had a nice spiciness to it.\\n\\nToo bad the Japanese style cold ramen is only available from May to October. It looked pretty appealing pour moi. I'll have to try it when I move here ;) I can't really compare to the other ramen shops in town (other than Santouka, which is a staple) but Motomachi is a pretty solid choice."},{"name":"Grapevine Pizza","address":"6462 Winchester Blvd","city":"Canal Winchester","stars":"3","text":"The meatball pizza is AMAZING!

Eight of us just came here to celebrate my birthday and had a wonderful time, as usual.\\n\\nWe had some excellent tapas/appetizers.  Our favorites (among those we ordered) were the Duxbury oysters (very fresh with nice accompaniments), the couscous con verduras (very tasty Israeli couscous w roasted vegetables), the Setas al Jerez (portabella mushrooms in a sherry cream demi-glace, maybe even a tad too rich, but oh so delicious), and the carpacio al atun (perfectly-prepared slices of rare tuna, pan seared on the outside, over a nice mango & black bean salsa).\\n\\nSome of the other appetizers/tapas were, I thought, a little less successful.  The gambas al ajillo (sizzling shrimp in garlic & chili) had a wonderful flavor, but suffered from using cheaper peeled shrimp.  The goat cheese empanadas were nice, but I didn't think the tart sweetness of the red pepper relish sauce was a good match for them.  The potato leek soup was very flavorful, but just a little too floury (which didn't stop us from devouring it), and I thought the beef carpacio tasted a little more like rare roast beef than really good carpacio.\\n\\nAmong the entrees, we especially liked the Cornish hen (perfectly seasoned and prepared), the osso bucco (excellent tender lamb in a beautiful sauce, served with with excellent rice with root veggies), and the zarzuela (very nicely done seafood in a delicious saffron sauce).\\n\\nFor dessert, the cranberry & apple pie, pumpkin pie and chocolate truffles were all really good, but the flan was excellent, and the pineapple and coconut cheesecake was outstanding.\\n\\nThe food does vary a bit, but a lot of the dishes are excellent, and even dishes that miss the mark are generally still satisfying and flavorful.

Maybe it's because the music wasn't blaring and there wasn't a plethora of flat screen televisions - but when we stepped in it felt like being back at home in an (albeit really nice, non-grimy, non-dive-bar) local pub.\\n\\nI think what I really like about it is that it is not like a \\"theme pub\\" like so many of the \\"Irish\\" bars are here. Even if there are Irish staff in the bars, they have this American vibe to them - as I said, not so here.\\n\\nThe food was really tasty - I had fish and chips, and the batter was great - like batter found in a GOOD pub or chippie - so maybe not 'typical'!! It wasn't either the 'breaded' batter or tempura batter that you often find here. It was nice and thick and crisp, with that slightly moist white bit where it meets the fish.\\n\\nHusband had steak pie, and again, he thought it was really good. We split the shortbread for desert. Didn't want to buy into the myth that deep fried mars bars were what Scots eat for desert! Probably will succumb at some point though.\\n\\nThe menu seemed great and will def be back to try more things. It is basically good pub grub that you would find in Scotland. I would hope that the chef will change it periodically though, because I can foresee coming back quite regularly.\\n\\nVery friendly staff was great to speak with someone from home.

I LOVE the atmosphere, it's nice and big, with an impressive amount of outdoor seating as well. That being said, it can be a challenge to find a seat during peak coffee shop hours, so be prepared for that and no matter what time of day, it's virtually impossible to find an outlet. Maybe it's their secret way of making sure people don't squat all day so everyone has a change to hang out?\\n\\nThey have a retail shop on one side and the coffee shop on the other, with tables to dine or work at throughout. The staff is always very nice and welcoming, laid back and often will strike up a conversation. \\n\\nIf you want to start getting serious about coffee and treat yourself to the real deal, they can hook you up with the right apparatus (french press, drip, whatever), help you select your beans and then grind them up for you, to ensure a superior at-home coffee experience.\\n\\nFoodwise, I used to come here for brunch a lot and the omelettes never disappoint. More recently, I tried a few other things and wasn't as impressed. The barley salad was incredibly bland, basically like eating a bowl of oatmeal without any other flavors. That doesn't mean it was bad, but it was a bigger helping than it looked like, and I was pretty over it a few bites in. The breakfast burrito (veggie) was mostly scrambled eggs that were very dense and overpowered the whole thing. They weren't light or fluffy and I wouldn't have enjoyed them as a side by themselves either. My boyfriend ordered the pancakes and they were beautiful and by the way they vanished, delicious too. \\n\\nI always go for the Oregon chai which I happen to enjoy very much, but at another coffee shop that will remain unnamed, there was some putting-down of Oregon chai, causing me to realize it's a standard product used at many stores. The barista promised me a \\"spicier\\" chai than Oregon, and he was right, it was very good. But if I'm at Stauf's, I'm definitely not going to complain about their Oregon stuff - it still hits the spot.\\n\\nLove this place, especially on a sunny weekend morning outside. Stauf's provides a refuge, a workplace, a meeting place, and a respite from hunger or sleepiness all in one."},{"name":"Cambridge Brewing Company","address":"1 Kendall Sq, Bldg 100","city":"Cambridge","stars":"3.5","text":"I have a beer loving boyfriend and Lhasa Apso with separation anxiety so I was psyched to find out that they welcome dogs on the patio!

And I didn't even try the desert!\\n\\nI have been going past the exterior of this wonderful kingdom of some mystical culinary land for about 3 years now, and I believe I have lost 3 irretrievable years of gastrointestinal bliss. Last Saturday, whilst attempting to celebrate a friend's birthday, we wound up outside the gates of this grand realm. It wasn't until we had stepped foot past the portals of this entrancing domain that we had realized we were about to be put under her enchantment.\\n\\nFirst to note, it seems it would make things a lot more fluid for the hostess if reservations are made in advance. Nonetheless, our hostess and waiter were grand guides through this wondrous land. (More on our waiter later.) The lighting, though some other yelpers may not enjoy it, was wonderfully romantic. I could easily see about the establishment, yet it was dim enough to evoke a certain mystery and allure to the events about to take place.\\n\\nWe had a party of 4 and started off with a pitcher of Sangria. It was not as strong as I like, but it was very smooth and fruity.  The bread with spiced dip was good, though the only reason we wanted more bread was for the Delectable sauces which accompanied the tapas we later ordered. The fried goat cheese was amazing. As were the duck leg, brie a la plancha, and homemade meatballs. The starts of our Tapas voyage were the Escargots and the Filet mignon in red wine sauce. The only wish I had was for some utensil to be able to get ALL of the amazing sauces from the plate to my mouth. The spoon simply did not suffice.\\n\\nThe mussels in tomato sauce were not as wonderful. Something about the flavor of the mussels with the tomato was a bit off to me. I could have gone without them, as was the case with the rest of the table. Next time maybe we will get the tres amigos or something with anchovies. I haven't had anchovies in ages and I fully trust Tasca to serve them up delectably.  Also, there are a couple of wines that I am looking to try when I come back.\\n\\nOur waiter (Chris I believe) was very courteous and attentive even though it was a very busy time. He was also well versed in the menu which helped in making our selections.\\n\\nIf my next visits to Tasca are as wonderful as this past one was, I may have to move to the apartments right beside it.\\nGreat prices for good portions of wonderful food and atmosphere."},{"name":"Annapurna Restaurant","address":"1926 West 4th Avenue","city":"Vancouver","stars":"3.5","text":"meh.\\n\\nOnly went here once (visiting from the US) but it clearly doesn't compare to now defunct Yogi's on Commercial Ave.\\n\\nThe food was fairly good and the service was slow considering that it was not crowded. \\n\\nLuckily there is an awesome vegetarian Mexican food place \\"Banditas\\" that makes up for the loss of Yogi's even though its not Indian."},{"name":"Centro Mexican Kitchen","address":"950 Pearl St","city":"Boulder","stars":"4","text":"Came in for lunch.

Taking the stairs is much faster than waiting along with the hordes of students for the elevator.\\n\\nThe interior of the restaurant is actually clean and somewhat trendy, with paintings on the wall.  There's a counter selling desserts and other confectioneries.  The place is a little deserted in the evenings, but there's nothing wrong with that in my books.  They had Spanish music playing in the background.  The waitress sat us down and gave us ice waters with lemon slices inside. Yay!\\n\\nOn Fridays they have $11 steak + prawns. On other days it's +$2.  The steak is actually quite good.  Sure the pieces aren't the world's largest, but I will gladly compare it to $30 pieces elsewhere.

My uncle suggested we go to BJ's because they had good beer and decent food.  I totally agree on that first point.  The beer is good.  I had a Hefeweizen that was totally tasty and summer appropriate.  That's where the better than average ends.  \\n\\nMy boyfriend (who is 29), forgot his ID, and thus could not get a beer.  Boo.  I mean, I get it, but frustrating.  Next up, the appetizers.  We had very standard chips/salsa and spinach artichoke dip.  I've definitely had better, pretty much, well everywhere.  Then there was a loooooong lag time between our appetizers and entrees.  I ordered a southwest salad with chicken.  It was, well, adequate.  The dressing was super duper salty, so I'm glad I ordered it on the side.  The corn was for sure from a can, the cheese a standard uber processed blend from a bag, and the lettuce really unremarkable.  Heck, even the avocado tasted meh.  And I love avocado!  The entire table was served....save for my poor bf.  His dish was apparently forgotten or something.  After 5-6 minutes, here comes his dish, and it's the wrong one.  Ok.  Just send it back.  Almost immediately, ta da, here is the right dish.  The refills on drinks took a very long time.  When my water was finally refilled, she filled it halfway.  Um.  What?  Yeah.  That pretty much sums up my BJ's experience.  Come for a beer, leave before you get hungry.  I also felt like the check was a bit more than what I'd value the meal at.  Two pretty meh, standard entrees and a beer for $30?  Nah.  I'll pass on this one again."},{"name":"Yuzu","address":"4130 SW 117th Ave, Ste H","city":"Beaverton","stars":"4","text":"Very authentic, very decent food, but not for vegetarians.\\n\\nThis place didn't have a lot of vegan options, which is understandable because the place is very traditional, but I really wish that they had a vegan ramen dish. \\n\\nThe ramen portions seem to be a decent size, but our party still ordered several appetizers and didn't have any left overs.

As I mentioned we \\"lost\\" our waiter sometime before we actually finished up and he was never seen again.  We had to ask for our bill and check out at the main counter.  This wasn't so bad as it gave us an opportunity to peruse the dessert cabinet and buy some take alongs.  However adding those purchases to our bill was not a streamlined process and created a bit of a wait which I felt odd.  My companion and I consumed our entire meal.  She had an omelette and said she would have preferred if the omelette was prepared with the ingredients in it rather than on it.  My sandwich was good.  The tiramisu that we both took home was the best part.  The fruit tart I also took home was good but the crust was hard to break with a fork and made for \\"tough\\" eating.

So I went on a Wednesday night at about 10 p.m. and most of the seats were being used and they were pretty busy. Now, I was expecting MUCH worse...but I didn't notice a cold and unwelcoming vibe, or surly and rude employees that ignore the customers. For the most part, our waitress was polite and helpful...she was quick and didn't mess up any orders or tickets. Overall though, there were some things I wasn't fond of; for example, like some people said...the vibe isn't super homey or welcoming and I also really can't put my finger on it. I guess it was weird because of the way it was set up in there maybe? It felt like the tables were everywhere but somehow also condensed and so close to the bars that there was a lot of foot traffic...which is all fine, but the volume wasn't consistent either and being with a group of people, that can make for some awkward situations. One second the music was so loud and the bartenders were talking so loud that our group was shouting to talk, and then within an instant they switched songs and it was dead silent. Also, their menu boards are convenient because they're digital, but they're kind of chaotic and the prices are SO small it was impossible to realize I was spending $5.50 on 10 oz of beer. Still not complaining, BUT we were there for a birthday and their website lists that they close at midnight, so that's what we expected. Apparently our waitress came and did her last call, but she didn't make sure everyone had heard and all of a sudden it's 15 mins to 11 and she seemed really irritated that we wanted more beer, but she complied. We had one member show up around that time that was trying to choose a beer quickly and she kind of loomed there and tapped her foot...he even tried to make small talk and she was just short until he ordered his beer. At that point I tried to ask if I could still order food from the happy hour menu and she was really short and snappy when she told me they'd closed the kitchen (mind you, this is when she shared that they closed at 11) and she also shared that she had no control over the website and she didn't know what to do about that. We weren't trying to argue, we were just letting her know and I totally understood that I couldn't order food anymore. With that all being said, I had a pleasant experience and I'd go again...they do have an extensive list of beers and it's a neat place. Personally, I think the happy hour food items are a little overpriced for the amount you get, but oh well. Also, I think our waitress was great...but maybe could've been a little nicer towards the end of the evening. Realistically, they're happy hour menu isn't that complicated and she could've told me the kitchen was closed and then for the sake of customer service, she could've gone to check and see if they had fries left or could whip up any of the dishes with minimal effort. Even if the answer had been no, it would've been nice if she tried.

I'm not a huge sashimi fan, but it was really flavorful.  Sushi Box A was $6.95, and it came with 4 huge pieces of tempura, 4 huge california rolls, and a large serving of chicken teriyaki over rice.  Maybe it's because I'm from Edmonton, but I would have had to spend over 3 times that amount to get the same amount of food.\\n\\nWe were completely stuffed, and even with tip our meal was just over $20.

In Japan its ramen wouldn't be my favorite, but in Portland it gets five stars simply because it's REAL JAPANESE RAMEN!  YESSSS! :D  Where other restaurants seem to start with a can or powder of something American, Yuzu's broth is light but rich, pork-based, and tastes like the real thing.  If you get the kakuni version, you get some chunks of perfectly-flavored pork--not too salty, but still lots of taste--that has been simmered until it's nice and soft, and served with plenty of melt-in-the-mouth fat still on it.  Perhaps not what most Jack Sprat type Americans are looking for from dinner, but those in the know (wink wink) are probably already checking what time Yuzu opens.\\n\\nThe hijiki salad was an awesome reminder of Japan too, but the serving was quite small.  I could have finished it by myself but had to share. :(\\n\\nThe mini katsu-don was perfectly fried, but we added some soy sauce to make the flavor a little more rich.  Also fried was the pork hasami-age, which had some shiso (beefsteak) leaves magically inserted into a cutlet, fried, and then served up with a salted plum dressing.  Oh, and we had the grilled eggplant as well.\\n\\nAll in all I would have liked everything a little richer, but we can probably take care of that with a request next time.\\n\\nJust 2 bummers, and both to do with alcohol:\\nOne, why is shochu so expensive??

The falafel was fine, but I think I was spoiled by one or two Gyro joints that maybe put more spice in them that give it some kick. \\n\\nOrdered the mint tea and the house yogurt mint drink.

Mind you, the restaurant has steep competition in Vancouver with the excellence that is Chambar.  I would say that the 'Asian' mussels are lacking in tartness and the broth was too creamy; the ginger and lime were not perceptible and didn't feel 'Asian' for that reason.

The potatoes under the steak was better than the steak itself.  I ordered yucca frites, and these somewhat satisfied my craving.  However, they were drier than I'm accustomed to eating.  I asked for some garlic sauce or ranch to doctor them up.  The server informed me that the chef was creating something.  It took a long time for them to bring it out.

Her salad was huge and definitely filling.  All the ingredients looked fresh and was good.  The chicken onion mushroom alfredo was ok. The chicken, I think, was breaded, which made it a bit heavier than I liked, but the sauce wasn't too creamy or buttery, so i was happy about that.  Don't get me wrong, it was creamy, but not 'i can see the butter pooling' creamy like some other restaurants.  it was a bit bland, so i added a little salt.\\n\\nThe bread service was nice, bread was crisp on the outside and warm and chewy on the inside, like good Italian bread.

You really can't go wrong with an army of smiling staff ready to brighten up your day. Usually walking in with my eyes still have closed, still half dreaming, they always greet me and brighten up my day. I seriously love these guys and gals.\\n\\nMy infatuation with Diesel Cafe started years ago when I was just a guppy swimming in the dating pond when my girlfriend suggested the place one morning knowing I could get vegan cream cheese there. I said sure why not being a bagel aficionado, I had to see how a Somerville bagel held up to the the Jewish Deli in Canton, MA my father and I would frequent when I was young. What started as a one time trip became an almost daily pilgrimage for breakfast before I would escort her via bicycle to her work morning after morning that autumn. Despite a Craigslist Missed Connections hoping I wasn't her boyfriend, and missing the bar of compliments I have already bestowed, that girlfriend three years later is now my wife. As cliche as an 80s t-shirt, Diesel Cafe is for Lovers.\\n\\nThese days we make breakfast at home, but never hesitate to walk down the street to get an \\"adult beverage\\" which is our code phrase for latte, and a joke since she is pregnant and for obvious reasons not drinking alcohol. We still reminisce about those nervous mornings early in our love life of  drinking coffee, and getting bagel crumbs on my backgammon set.\\n\\nThe best time to go here in lunch time on a weekday, for it seems other times are much more busy. The weekend is extremely crowded as is 6pm on a weekday when everyone gets off from work stopping in on their commute home. A fine selection of teas and treats with most baked good by the local Iggys Bakery. They are proud to be using local ingredients delivered by Metro Pedal Power and always have some very interesting, reasonably priced art for sale on the walls.\\n\\nThe downside to here is a lot of customers camp out for a long time, and its annoying when you have a group of four or five and can't get a booth because a college student is hogging one with a laptop, its worse when there's three or four college students doing this. Perhaps I'm more outgoing, but if I saw someone doing homework on a laptop while wearing headphones, and I was going to do the same thing, I'd ask if we could share a table. Be courteous to your fellow patrons!\\n\\nI wish that Diesel Cafe had a small stage/area for musicians. Their sister store Bloc 11 has an open mic on Thursdays but they close so early, that the start time of 6pm is inconvenient for most people. An open mic needs to be 8pm-11pm not 6pm-8/9pm. I definitely think Davis Square is a better location to attract local musicians and people to come watch them and buy coffee and sandwiches.\\n\\nIt seems most people already know about this great place, for every time I come here I always run into old friends, old roommates, coworkers, and acquaintances, perhaps its the Cheers of our generation.

Honestly, it's the only \\"fast food\\" drive-thru I'll use for meals, nothing else comes close. Their lengua tacos are gooood, as are the carnitas. Mango agua fresca is nice too, not overly sweet, and totally refreshing. And they take credit card, even if your order only amounted to like 4 bucks since each taco is like $1.30.

The bartender was AMAZING and deserves a raise with the outstanding level of service she puts out. We ordered the bucket of biscuits, and 2 buttermilk fried chicken plates. For sides I got the broccoli casserole and the Mac and cheese, and my friend got the cheese grits and baked beans so we could taste a bit of everything. The Biscuits were insanely delicious, light fluffy enormous clouds of heaven. For me the honey butter was a bit sweet but they paired very well together. Unfortunately this was the highlight of my meal. \\n\\nFor the sides, 2 of the 4 were very tasty, and the other 2 were not appetizing at all. The broccoli casserole was great, nicely cooked and cheesy. My friend greatly enjoyed the cheese grits, I have no opinion because i hate grits of any kind. The beans and the mac and cheese had very off tastes and not cooked right. The beans were hard in the center, and the elbow macaroni disentegrated on any attempt to use a fork. For me, the chicken was the worst of it. The entirety of the meal on the whole was very underseasoned so i had to ask for salt, but the batter on the outside didnt seem to have any flavorings at all. It was Also not coated correctly, chicken skin shouldn't come off in one solid piece and be soggy. Mine was also a bit underdone inside towards the bones, but the outside was very dark and burnt as if they had cooked it in oil that was way too hot.\\n\\nFor the price points, its very expensive and I was expecting a much better experience so i am not sure if we will be returning.

We started with the fried okra and the biscuits with honey butter. The biscuits were SO good. An absolute must try! I wasn't too crazy about the fried okra.\\n\\nFor my meal I ordered the tray with short rib, mac n' cheese and potato salad. Unfortunately the short rib was a little bit fatty. I would have been more upset if I was paying but instead I just happily picked around for the best pieces (which were fantastic). The mac n' cheese was super rich and creamy and the potato salad was great.

Sweet Cheeks is the best BBQ in the Boston area.  I've been to several - Blue Ribbon,  Red Bones, Fire Flys, etc. and, they can't hold a rib to Sweet Cheeks.

The brisket is moist and deeply flavored, the pulled pork is the best you will find, the beef ribs have a wonderful chew and taste heavenly.  But, some surprises too.  The smoked chicken and pulled chicken is the best chicken I have had anywhere.  I skipped it during dinner (why take up valuable room for ribs) and didn't try it until I opened up the left overs at home.  Wow!  What a great surprise.

I guess we arrived at the perfect time because there wasn't many people there.  \\n\\nWe ordered the Peking Duck.  I have only had it once so that is the experience I am comparing it to.  The price was very reasonable, only $35.99 and it was definitely enough for 3-4 people.  So, my friend and I had a lot to carry home.  I debated on either 4 or 5 stars, but decided to go with four.  Here is the reason why.  We ordered the Peking Duck and they had it at our table within 10 minutes.  The duck was already carved out, and I was looking forward to the whole experience again of them carving the duck.  Last time I had Peking Duck, it took them about 40 minutes to bring it to the table.\\n\\nNow that that is out of the way, I have to say the duck was very delicious.  The skin was nice and crisp and it appeared to be a \\"lean\\" duck as there wasn't much fat.   The meat was very tender and juicy.  The first time I had it there was a lot of fat.  I actually preferred this one.  The presentation was outstanding.\\n\\nThe soup that is served before the duck was very tasteful and thick, not watered down like some other types of soup.  I also ordered fried rice, since it only came with steamed rice.  I asked the waitress how the rice was cooked, and they said it would have peas and carrots in it.  Well, she forgot to mention the onions.  I didn't mind, but if I would have known that, I would have had them hold the onions.\\n\\nThis place is definitely popular on a Saturday night.  By the time we finished our dinner, there was a line of people out the door.  All in all, this was definitely a good choice for my birthday dinner.

There were no awesome options for beverages, so I just got water (I have to say, La Super Torta 2 WINS with the horchata). My friend followed my lead and ordered a taco and a burrito - I can't recall which meats he ordered, since we spent most of our time mowing (nom nom freakin' nom) and talking about grad student b.s. - but I do know he really enjoyed his first taco truck experience. I want to emphasize that this was indeed delicious - but as Nick mentions, not mind-blowing (whereas taco trucks of yore have blown my mind). In terms of my torta, the bread was not smushed much - and I have decided that this is sort of the determining factor for me. I did like the avocados in it, but I almost felt like they took away from the lack of meat in it. Sad face. \\n\\nThis taco truck seems very geared toward the Harrison West/Vic Village upwardly mobile yet still hip crowd - it doesn't seem as authentic as, say, La Super Torta or La Morena, which are in much more beat down neighborhoods and thus less concerned with pleasing white people's perception of Mexican food, and more with feeding people who are Mexican, or who live within the Hispanic community. I did not see any Mexican or Hispanic people eating here, so that was another indicator - not that they don't, just that at more authentic-seeming joints I have always heard Spanish spoken almost exclusively and felt a sense of ethnic community as friends and family of the owners frequented those places while I was there. \\n\\nI would like to take the boy here and see what he thinks.

Also, the food came out extremely quickly after we ordered. In another context (ie. a non-sushi restaurant) that would be a warning flag that the food was pre-prepared at the expense of taste and quality, but I made a special request that my spicy rolls be made without tempura, so the chef had clearly made them to order. On that note, I also appreciated that they accommodated my request without a problem. On the negative side, my request for extra ginger was dealt with in a very strange manner. My food arrived just before my friend's, and before the server had a chance to go and get my friend's dinner, I asked for extra ginger. Then the server brought out my friend's dinner, pointed to the ginger on her platter, and said something about that being the \\"extra\\" ginger. First of all, there was definitely no \\"extra\\" ginger anywhere to be seen. Second, I was the one who requested it, so I thought it was very strange that she was essentially telling me that she had put something I had requested on my friend's plate. I had to flag down the server again and reiterate my request. She tried to pretend that she had already brought me what I had asked for, but eventually she obliged. It was a tiny dish about twice the size of a loonie, just FYI, but at least she had finally attended to my request and the amount was sufficient.\\n\\nAs for the rolls, beyond my pet peeve of adding tempura to spicy tuna and spicy salmon rolls (WHY ruin a delicious sushi roll? WHY??), which as I already mentioned was dealt with no problem, I would say the quality was average.

I didn't really like the flavor of any of the beers.  The pilsner was ok but did not look like a pilsner.  It was very cloudy and I've never thought that a pilsner should be cloudy.  Not sure what the intention was, but it just felt lazy or miscalculated by the brewer.  The stout just wasn't a stout by any measure.  It was dark, that's about it.  I don't even know what style it tasted like, but not like any stout I know. \\n2.  I HATE that they serve the beer in \\"wicked cold\\" frosty glasses.  I assume this is either to be funny, gimmicky, or to cover up bad flavors (as flavor reveals itself at warmer temps).  Anyone I know who appreciates craft beer would agree that the beers, apart from maybe the pilsner, should not be served this way.  I enjoy tasting all the flavors and complexity of my beer and not having it all be killed by an ice-cold glass.  And to try to convince people this is a better way to drink beer is just misguided.  \\n3.  I am APPALLED by the fact that they try to create new beer styles by mixing two beers.  You do not make a brown ale by mixing a pilsner and and a stout.  And you don't make another style by mixing different proportions of the same two beers.  I don't even know what to say about this.  I started laughing when I saw them pouring the beer.  You are lying to your customers and cheating them by making them think they are drinking something they are not.  This, again, is so lazy it makes me sick.  Either brew the beer or don't brew the beer and be honest enough to serve what you actually created. Hell, you could have served 30 different beers.   \\"Hey everyone!  We have 30 beers on tap!!  We take two beers and mix them in different amounts to create 30 unique brews!\\"  Disgusting.  \\n\\nHere is what I liked:\\n\\n1.  The food was fine.  Standard bowling alley food.  \\n2.  When I mentioned that I didn't like the beer, the brewer introduced himself and was pleasant and receptive to my feedback.  Although he didn't quite understand what I was trying to say and was trying to humor me, he did not get defensive or argumentative.  He was clearly open to feedback, which is very important and something I respected.  However, I doubt I had much impact.\\n3.  The brewing equipment looked amazing and the location for opening a brewpub was fun.  I love bowling, and I love craft beer.  If I enjoyed the beer, I'd be there all the time!!!\\n\\nI'm glad this place seems to be doing well and some people seem to like it.  I want it to be successful.

Before going in, I asked the host to point out some foods that our son could eat because he hasn't built a good tolerance for spicy foods yet.  The host was kind enough to go through each of the selections and point out which ones he could try.  Best of all, they had mango ice cream!  My son loved it.  He also loved the crepes that we got along with the buffet.  It's always been hard to go to Indian restaurants with him but I think this one works for all three of us.  \\n\\nMy wife and I LOVED the selection.  The selection seemed a little different than other Indian buffets we've been to.  Maybe it's because the others were Mughali food, as another Yelp reviewer (Nadaa i.) pointed out and this is South Indian food?  Either way, it is very good. My favorites were the curry leaf rice and tandori fry.  I also liked the okra dish that they had and the 'other' chicken dish (not the tandori chicken - can't remember the name!).  My wife was a big fan of the tandori chicken and fish curry (along with the ones I loved too).  OMG I think I had 4 plates of food that day and didn't eat for the rest of the day\\n\\nThe wait staff was very friendly.  Struck up a good conversation with one of the younger ones working there.  He made a comment on my sport bike t-shirt and we began talking about cars and bikes....the usual guy talk.  The restaurant itself was very spacious and well laid out.  The buffet area was never too congested.  Everything is laid out logically (i.e. pretty obvious where the start of the line is although not everyone adheres).  There was never a shortage of food, especially considering we got there at 2:45pm (they close their buffet at 3pm but they continued to bring more food out).  I really appreciate that when lunch buffet restaurants continue bringing out new food even when it's near closing time.  I just hate eating stale food.\\n\\nThere seemed to be plenty of parking and the restaurant is very easy to find.  We will try to go here more often!

I was REALLY excited about writing a 5 star review after the nice drinks experience I had there on a quiet thursday night. I was going to talk about how much potential this place has, how well decorated it is, etc. Fat chance. \\n\\n Initially I went there on a thursday night around 10pm on a 'drinks' meet-up with a lady friend. I go out quite a bit in Boston and despite being somewhat retired from the 'nightlife' scene, still enjoy checking out lounges and new spots. \\n\\nThe potential of this place is great. Its very shiny, well done up, with a long bar, a small outdoor patio, and 2 rooms. The entire place is built like a green underwater version of Underbar, that's really the only place I can compare it to. \\n\\nThe bartender was a friendly asian girl with standard nightclub bartender 'dimensions'. She was peppy and served us quickly although we were the only two people at the bar for the hour that we were there. Drinks are standard high end lounge prices 12-13/pop. \\n\\nAs someone who enjoys going out, I have a lot of friends with disposable income who like checking out new spots. I had invited 2 lady friends to come because I got a text on my phone confirming a Svedka Tasting Event. \\n\\nThis was the event that ruined my desire to come here again, despite the Decor being AWESOME. \\n\\nThis was an absolute and complete failure as an event on so many levels its not even funny. Emerald, you cost me social clout with my female friends. As someone who goes out quite a bit, I was expecting a fairly packed night on Columbus Day weekend with free booze for an hour or two. I was expecting to leave extra tips for the bartenders to compensate them for the patrons that thought this was a 'free drinks, so no need to tip,' type of night. Instead when I walked in with my friends, I received a blank stare from the bartenders regarding the Svedka promo, and was then told \\"you can have any Svedka for $10.00. That's a tasting? Grudgingly, the GM authorized 1 drink or shot per patron of a Svedka-based drink. After the first 'shot' the bartender told me that 'of course nobody is going to let us drink for free'. If this is a Svedka tasting then the Svedka vodka is supposed to be free. That's why its a 'tasting event'. Since I had already embarrassed myself by inviting 2 friends there, we stayed, and paid. After spending an hour in a dead and empty room, we left to go to the W next door, where at least there were people. I'm disappointed that I was excited to show this place to my friends.\\n\\nApparently there is a 'dance license' which neither Splash, nor Cure, nor this place have...and everyone knows that you go to Cure and Splash to dance. Apparently the city has been really hard on this place over dancing while the same owners are busy building a brand new nightclub next door called '57'. \\n\\nThe reason I know this is from both previous reviewers, and from the GM of this place. How did the GM tell me? By confronting me about telling my friends that this place doesn't have a license to dance. The GM approached me and said that some of the staff reported that there was a guy 'badmouthing' Emerald lounge. BADMOUTHING? Are you kidding me?!??!!? A GM of a place approaches a patron and asks him why the patron is telling others that the place doesn't have a license to dance. A patron that isn't saying anything negative or vulgar. A patron that is simply discussing the lack of a license. A patron that is one of 10 TOTAL at an event, that was supposed to be a 'free' tasting event, that is total bust. \\n\\nIf they had wanted to 'squash rumors' as the GM said, instead of confronting a patron and embarassing that person they could have approached him with his two friends, and bought them drinks, or asked how they were enjoying the venue.  They would have found out that the patrons were disappointed and this could have been an amazing opportunity to buiid rapport with people who ACTUALLY GO OUT ON A SUNDAY IN THE RAIN and tell others about the new places in town. \\n\\nTotal and utter disappointment.  I didn't even get a chance to try any of the food, and sadly I think this place has a lot of potential but whoever is doing the promotions and running this place needs to re-evaluate their attitude towards the guests that actually DO show up and spend money at your establishment. The W and Cure were both full of patrons and got plenty of my money that night.\\n\\nAlso I noticed that 2 other people mentnoned being called out or asked to leave when they criticized the establishment in any way. This makes me think it is policy that is enforced. The reviews that mention this are 'filtered' - and may not be read by most people; sadly for this establishment, my reviews are never filtered since I'm an active Yelp participant.

The Greek lasagna was the star of the plate. I don't know what kind of cheese is on top but it was to die for. It was creamier and smoother than ricotta.  Looking back, because it's so rich, I think I would have trouble eating a full sized serving, but it was the tastiest dish I've had in a really long time.

I've known about Graffiti Burger for some time now but never had the chance to go and try one. This place is often compared to Five Guys. For those of you who may not know about Five Guys they are another burger joint created to be different...fresh, local, and big greasy messes. I found out about Five Guys back when I lived in Philly. In my opinion Five Guys is a wonderful burger place that has a few issues...they're too greasy, although size alone usually gets my husband in their door. \\n\\nGraffiti Burger, although a lot like Five Guys, is completely different. Besides being a Columbus only burger place (locations in Grandview, Clintonville, and Dublin) and unique in style and appearance (their store is truly unique! ..you need to see it to understand the crazy), their burgers are much better! Both chains have Jr & Original size; Jr being 1 patty and Original being a double (thinner patties just like Five Guys) $4.75-$5.75 for a jr and $5.99-$6.99 for an Original. I ordered the BLT burger (shredded lettuce, super thick cut bacon and tomato) and Tom got the blazzin burger (pepper jack cheese, chipotle mayo, seiracha sauce, and jalapenos) and shared a cheese fry. Both burgers were fantastic! I knew I liked BLT's and burgers and the concept sounds pretty easy & normal but by no means have I have had these flavors before. I cant explain it...simple bacon, lettuce, and tomato on a burger comes nowhere close to how good their BLT burger is despite having just those 4 ingredients. Together, however they tricked my mouth, the ingredients went far beyond just 'some normal burger' and my husband had the same issue with his. When I make burgers at home on the grill and put pepper jack cheese and jalapenos on them ..maybe even some chipotle mayo...again it comes nowhere close to theirs. The key here is their seiracha sauce; I know I cant spell it. It's an asian hot sauce that's PACKED with heat. Eat it by itself and you swear the burger is too hot to be eaten....but take a bite and it all melts together in perfect burger harmony bliss. No joke.\\n\\nThe fries are another issue all together. I don't like overcooked fries...who does?? So I really don't understand why anyone would like them. I've been warned by people that their fries should be looked over in favor of their burgers and I get that now. You don't go here for the fries. They're burnt, dry, and covered in some vinegar sauce that just makes them more weird. Obviously fresh cut potatoes, but ruined by over cooking...a real shame. So no five stars here.\\n\\nYou've made a customer for life out of us though. These burgers are simply the best I've ever had.

Ooh, take note however, the tables out in the gorgeous open air with a spa-tropical feel are rather inviting.  \\n\\nWhen I think of a drink that is my perfect drink, I think of a drink that is the Micha Caliente.

They have an attractive list of cocktails and vino but Micha will always have my total attention.\\n\\nFor dinner, we took the sharing amongst friends approach.  First and foremost, the grilled octopus & pork lettuce wraps are a must-have!  For those of you more cautious eaters, don't be turned off by the octopus.  Their octopus is succulent and soft, very scallop-like to be honest.  Our bartender taught us the unmessy way to eat our lettuce wraps.  First, dip the rice noodles in the magical Vietnamese sauce (that is so good I could drink it) and place these on your lettuce. Then dip your meats in the sauce and place them on the lettuce.  Sprinkle in a few wisps of mint, wrap, and shovel it in.  OMG!  I will never come here without ordering these.  Next, we were wooed by the scallop ceviche. Now, that's two dishes in a row that I am Gaga about.  Then, we went for the Steak Tartare and the Whole Rainbow trout.  Of all the years in my life, nobody has ever offered to debone my fish.  Yes, it's true! The bartender offered to filet my rainbow trout ever so gently while we gazed and snapped a few pictures (check them out!).  I like this royalty treatment!  And, now after my excitement of the filleting activities, we had to go all in for dessert.  I could tell by the little bit of extra oomph in my bartender's voice when he uttered the words \\"Coconut Guava Cake\\" that we were sold.  This is warm and full of toasted coconut cake drenched in the sensual guavaness and cream.  Dear Gawd!

There is a POPCORN BACON BALL. As you can imagine, it was magical. Actually, both were really good. I get the impression that the menu at Watershed changes often so you might want to get in your car right now and go over there and order a popcorn bacon ball. Just to make sure you don't miss out. For entrees, most of us ordered the veggie plate which was, by far, the best veggie plate in the history of veggie platedom. It had fried broccoli, sauteed swiss chard, mashed sweet potatoes, an eggplant concoction that was very good but I'm not sure what to call it, and pimento cheese cornbread. Other entrees at the table that were all enjoyed were halibut, salmon, and a pork chop with bacon jam. For dessert, we had the mini coconut cake which had lemon curd between the layers, a chocolate bourbon pecan pie, and a hot milk cake which was reminiscent of a tres leche cake.\\nService was really good which is always a gamble with a large party. The entrees are a little expensive but well worth the price. If you didn't have as much alcohol as we did, you could easily have a nice, three course dinner and get out of there for under $100 for 2.

The closest T stop on the red-line is Broadway- and then this market is about a ten minute walk from there. I think this is the perfect place to buy a gift for someone, especially if you're looking for jewelry. There's a good amount of art, clothing, and crafts, and if you're looking for furniture or antiques, the antique market is right next door. A very enjoyable way to spend an afternoon- I only wish there was something like this a bit closer to Cambridge."},{"name":"Stephanie's On Newbury","address":"190 Newbury St","city":"Boston","stars":"3","text":"I ventured out to this mostly fine establishment for the first time a couple weeks ago for a blind date. Actually I had to go there twice. The first time I was ooooh about 30 minutes late (yeah, I know, REAL smooth, but hey I was still getting used to taking the green line in from Riverside...and I didn't know her # - the dating service doesn't give them out). Anyways, I got there and asked the hostess if she saw a woman waiting on her own for a while and she was kind enough to try and find her for me, but, alas, she had left.\\n\\nOn the actual date a couple days later, I got my chance to taste what this place is all about. I asked the waiter which wine he'd recommend, and chose the one for which he gave his best Borat impersonation (\\"It's GOOD wiiiiiiine\\"). For the appetizer we had an awesome spinach and artichoke dip (2 things I'm strangely not into on their own, but together....mmmm). As a main course, my date had an (Asian?) chicken salad which she liked and I thoroughly enjoyed the veal parm. They fill you up too...I ended up having to bring mine home.\\n\\nSo given the quality of the food and the helpfulness of the hostesses and waiters, I'd have to give this place 4 stars, for dinner at least. This is a pretty happening place though and can get LOUD, so it's probably not the best idea to go here on an early getting-to-know-you date, unless of course you're both a couple of loudmouths.

My favorite was the tuna.  They all were perfectly seasoned and tasted amazing!  9/10\\n\\nEntrees: I ordered the Filet Mignon and I must say, it is the best thing I have ever tasted in my entire life!  I've been to a few restaurants with 2 Michelin stars, and Davide's Filet Mignon blows them out of the water.  It was tender and juicy, but the sauce was what captivated me. Out of this world!  \\nMy girlfriend had the Occo Bucco.  She LOVED it!  I tried it as well and the meat was so succulent and flavorful.  The Risotto that was a part of the dish was delicious and pretty filling as well.  Both dishes were worth every penny. 11/10\\n\\nDessert: I ordered the Tiramisu and it just melted in my mouth.  The perfect amount of sweetness to finish the meal.   8/10\\n\\nDavide's atmosphere, service, and food were wonderful.  You have to try the Filet Mignon!  It's worth the drive from anywhere.

The coffee at Impero, as the previous reviewers have stated, is excellent. \\n\\nHowever, there are other places to get excellent coffee and not feel like you are intruding (on what? I'm not sure...). \\n\\nI stopped in to Impero tonight on the way to Phia because I got my Small Business Beanstock discount card in the mail (omg! Sign up! Google it, central Ohioans, it's FREE!) and this is one of the participating local businesses. I was all super psyched because I love coffee - I (excitedly) explained this to the barista, who seemed unimpressed. Not mean or anything, just... unimpressed. Apparently I had interrupted his convo with a friend/patron. Oh noz. :P \\n\\nI asked about the SBB card, and he explained it to me - it's a good deal, whatever you order gets one up-ed in size fo' free. So I ordered a small Americano and got a medium for the same price! Yeah! And it was definitely a well made cup of coffee, fine people of Columbus. I recommend the coffee whole heartedly. \\n\\nI had some questions about beans (looking for a non-gross decaf... not for me, don't worry!), but our man wasn't super into having a convo with me about this, so I didn't end up purchasing what could have been a $15/lb bag of coffee from him. \\n\\nThe decor and affect are really nice in here, though one thing I noticed was that it was all men in the coffee shop. Now yes, I KNOW this is the Short North (although wow I just made a blanket generalization), I get it, I get it, but like the Boystown location Caribou Coffee in Chicago which is a gay guy pick-up spot (which is totally cool with me - except that women are looked at with Death Gaze, as though we're ruining what's going on), I felt like Impero risked losing me as a patron simply because I am a lady. Everyone else was chatty and pleasant to each other, but as I said, the barista made me feel a little like I was intruding. Now, this may not be true, I may just be traumatized by previous similar experiences, but I'm just saying this is how it felt to me tonight. \\n\\nI do, however, recommend this coffee shop, and because the coffee is so excellent, and because they're part of the SBB, I'd like to go back in the very near future, preferably in the daytime, to update you on the aforementioned situation."},{"name":"Best Burger","address":"185th SE Stark","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"OMG you want to try something awesome come check John out he is doing Burgers,fries,Hot Dogs,soups,pasta and ice cream YUMMMMMMM"},{"name":"Stephanie's On Newbury","address":"190 Newbury St","city":"Boston","stars":"3","text":"Their menu is very small, and doesn't change much.

The sashimi was outstanding, so clean and fresh and a great size portion. \\n\\nWe then got a few pizzas,  the asparagus tempura mozzarella tomato salad and truffle fries.

I will say that the consistency of all is the same....POOR execution.  The atmosphere is nice and cosy, basically like every concept these days, but the food lacked in many ways.  \\n We started with a salad of greens and Calamari.  The greens had little to no flavor, no seasoning and not much to get excited about.  The calamari was tender, which I would hope being that it is a seafood joint.  However, I felt the calamari could be a bit hotter and crispier.  The shallots, to me, made the dish less impressive.  Now to the main dishes. My wife had the seared scallops with butternut squash and kale.  We figured with the simple ingredients that this dish could be executed at a high level.  Wrong.  The scallops were not cleaned properly and it was very evident in every bite.  The squash puree was bland and cold( the puree might be correct being cold, but we did not know this before hand) and the kale was just simple kale.  Nothing special.  Now on to the other dish.  Crispy skin haddock.  First off, the skin was not crispy whatsoever, and while the scallop dish was under-seasoned, the haddock was completely over-seasoned.  I love well seasoned food, but this took my breath away.  The ragout below the fish did not compliment the dish at all and it was almost sour tasting.  The server did ask how things were and I did mention that it was too salty, and they did offer something else, but after eating a couple mouthfuls of salt, I declined.  The manager also came by to say that they were going to take the dish off of the bill, which I was grateful for the hospitality.  \\n The service was pretty good and that would be the only positive to the experience.

I unwrapped the taco to find a cheap chili made taco with three chunks of unknown meat. After putting the cilantro, onions, and salsa on top the first bite was the worst. The chili was so strong that I still can't decide what kind of meat was actually inside under all of this chili. Remind you the chili would have been good with a hotdog. I am extremely glad I further ordered at the drive-thru with a bean and cheese burrito that happily made our midnight munchies settled for once.\\nI am glad to say that I will not be returning to this location of Taco Cabana in the future."},{"name":"The Tavern at Camp Creek","address":"3560 Camp Creek Pkwy, Ste 110","city":"East Point","stars":"2","text":"It's 9/11 and Irma has knocked out power Georgia-wide.

We came back the next night, armed with a reservation at 7:40pm. However, this time it was quite empty and chill. The service was quick qnd friendly, and non intrusive. The dishes seemed authentic. We both had the udon with pork, and one sip of the delicious broth had us both stop our chit chat and get straight to sipping and slurping the yummy in my tummy noodles.

It is not that vegan-friendly. The piada, the pasta, and most sauces are not vegan. The only option that is vegan is the salad, but for $6.75 (only 20 cents less than the meat dishes) it is definitely not worth it. \\n\\nFirst of all, it is not, as claimed, a \\"chopped\\" salad. It is a TOSSED salad. Secondly, if you like to eat more than lettuce, you will be sadly disappointed. Although there are tons of good looking veggie toppings, the servers use wooden teaspoons to LITERALLY SPRINKLE the veggies on top, as if they were bacon bits or some other kind of garnish. When asked to put on more veggies, the workers copped an attitude, basically refusing to add them. The guy behind the counter even sarcastically starting dumping teaspoons full of onions into my dish, all the while giving me a defiant and mocking stare. In the end, there was no substance to my salad-- it was a bowl of lettuce with some color sprinkled in and overwhelmingly dressed. They skimp on the veggies, but are certainly not stingy with the dressing. \\n\\nThe customer service was not all that great. Aside from their apparent unwillingness to give me more than 5 olive slices, workers seemed unknowledgeable about the food and disinterested in finding the answers to questions about which things contained dairy and which did not. Very important to know, people, especially for customers with dairy allergies!\\n\\nI agree with what someone else on here pointed out regarding sanitary issues-- workers wear the gloves, but don't seem to understand the concept behind them. You do NOT touch meat or cheese and then veggies! You also don't touch everything else under the sun and then handle food with the same gloves!\\n\\nThe parking was ridiculous! The place was so crowded we had to park in someone else's lot. Inside, the music was so loud it felt like I was in a bar. I also did not appreciate the communal seating arrangement, especially given the volume of teenagers sitting around texting and taking up space.\\n\\nI do not understand the love for this place at all. I suppose if you like lettuce drowned in dressing, disenchanted employees without an ounce of service -orientation, and a crowded bar-type atmosphere, you are in luck. \\n\\nTo be fair, I went to the Sawmill Rd. location, so atmosphere and worker attitudes could be different elsewhere, but the fact still remains that the menu is not all that vegan."},{"name":"Samurai Sushi On Fraser","address":"6428 Fraser Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"3","text":"This place has been around for years and are known for their gi-normous rolls.

The steaks would be otherwise utterly forgettable if not for the truly outlandish price tag affixed to them.  I ordered the \\"101 Steak Delmonico 16oz\\" for a mere $46.  The steak was exactly what you would expect at an Outback or Long Horn (no offense to either).  Someone else at our table ordered the exact same steak and when compared side-by-side they appeared to be at least 25% different in size (and the larger of the 2 was not 25% greater than 16 oz!).  If they were 1\\" thick, I would be surprised.  Given how thin these steaks were, I guess I am not surprised that my \\"medium & Pittsburgh\\" request was going to be a problem...it arrived at the table neither medium (well done) nor Pittsburgh.  I will give the server and management credit for being very apologetic and promptly bringing me another steak that was in fact Pittsburghed.  Again, it was so thin that while charred on the outside, the inside was mostly rare but continued to cook on my plate.  They really did try to get the temp/order right but just as I would \\"really\\" like to play in the NBA, my mediocre athleticism and 5' 10\\" frame just isn't able to get it done no matter what my intentions might be.  I would not be exaggerating when I say that by the time I was done, 30% of \\"the steak\\" (in the form of inedible fat and grizzle) was amassed on the side of my plate.  101 Steak pushes a lot of sauce, butters and toppers which to me often signifies the quality of the steaks don't stand on their own merit and I suspect this to be the case here.  Someone else at our table ordered the NY Strip which was similarly unremarkable.  With restaurants like Hal's, Bones & Chops setting the bar, 101 Steak is at best a steak house impostor charging preposterous prices because just they have self-designated themselves as a \\"Steak House\\" in Vinings.      \\nThe meal and restaurant was not a complete loss.  I must admit that the sides were quite good. The Crispy Brussel Sprouts were very good, bordering on spectacular.  The Jalape√±o Corn Brulee was very good as were the Pomme Frites with Garlic Aioli and Steak Sauce.  The Wedge salads were quite underwhelming and in need of extra blue cheese for what was a pretty minimal about of \\"wedge\\".\\nIf I were a betting man, which I am, I would not bet on 101 Steak surviving in its present state.  I had heard from plenty of others about the shocking price tags for the relatively mediocre products but I had to see for myself. As others confirm the same, I suspect those who know better will stay clear and the efficient market theory will run its course and aptly punish those charging 5 star prices for 2 star steaks to adapt or migrate."},{"name":"Renata","address":"626 SE Main St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"I was excited to eat here.

Eight times out of ten, the places are overpriced, under-flavored, and have maybe one dish that they do \\"right.\\"  Haiku, though is one of the few that does so much really well that I am pretty comfortable recommending it.\\n\\nOne thing I like is just the look of the place.  Its a very pretty restaurant, with a soothing, elegant feel that I really enjoy.  The local art on the walls is a nice touch.  I also like the forethought that goes into the products offered in the women's restroom.\\n\\nThe service here is also great.  Our nice young waiter tonight was fantastic and went out of his way to make our meals the way we wanted without any feel of being imposed upon, even if we didn't order super expensive meals or drinks.  I appreciate that.  \\n\\nAnd the food...\\nHaiku talks about the poetry of its food.  If by poetry they mean flavorful, then they are spot on.  However, please note that flavorful in this case does not mean spicy, even when the menu item has spicy in the name.  Basically, if you are in the mood for spicy authentic Thai food or something of the sort, this probably isn't the place for you (although the server will be happy to help you out with extra sriracha or chile oil if you ask).   Of course, given the Japanese name, this is perfectly appropriate; a \\"spicy\\" curry or whatever in Japan wouldn't even rate a \\"mild\\" in the States.\\n \\nWhile I like a little kick to my curry, I am not fond of \\"spicy\\" and so was very happy with my meal, the \\"spicy\\" Vietnamese beef soup....better known as pho.  Again, it is not the least bit spicy. It is, however, very flavorful, especially when I asked for, received, and added some extra cilantro and lime. Now, it isn't the standard beef broth you get at the more traditional Vietnamese places.  Compared to say Buckeye Pho or whatever, the broth here is sweet with some sour and umami elements.  It also is pretty salty.  I didn't notice this so much when I was eating, but I was very thirsty afterwards.  Still, I really liked the broth with its complexity of the flavor and the sweet/sour tanginess. \\nHaiku's take on pho is also a bit unusual in that it comes pre-made, meaning that you don't add in the sprouts, meat, etc.  While this does take away a bit of the DIY fun of pho, it also means that all of the ingredients are fully cooked and flavored, including the sprouts.  ...it also means that there is more room on the table for other things and other people.  \\n\\nThis meal being a lunch deal, I also received a bowl of miso soup with tofu and a salad in a dressing with a similar flavor to the stuff used in most Japanese restaurants.  However, there was also something more to it, a more complex, sweeter flavor.  \\n\\nNot quite so sweet are some of the prices.  To be fair, the bill is pretty average for the area, the quality is better than most other places of this sort, and the portions are -huuuge-!  You can easily take home at least half of your \\"lunch\\" entree.  Still, things add up quickly, especially if you want to order a drink or some sushi.  The latter in particular seems a bit pricy to me, with even the vegetarian rolls around $8 each.  Dishes themselves are typically between $10~12 for lunch and $12~15 for a large dinner plate.  Seafood dishes are more expensive.  Overall, it isn't hard to get out of Haiku with a full belly and wallet, but you might have to watch what you order a bit if you are on a tight budget.\\n\\nAll said, I do recommend Haiku if you are on High and want something sweet and flavorful, or need a soothing place to get away from the chaotic mass of people in Brownian motion that High Street often becomes.  It would also be ideal for dates, a girls' night out, or other events of the sort...and whatever the reason will be, I look forward to my next visit."},{"name":"Milk Street Cafe","address":"50 Milk St","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"MSC used to be one of the best lunch places in downtown Boston.

The buffet is a sad sad case.  The food is laid out on two tables - one is the heated steamer you see at restaurants that and the other is a table with the food kept warm with sterno warmers.  The food really sucks.  I just can't tell you how bad the food is.  The food is cold.  I don't think they add any water to the buffet table to keep the food warm.  There are no signs to tell you what is being offered.  When a tray of food is empty, it does not get refreshed quickly.  The staff isn't too concerned with keeping the food trays filled.  I just don't know what to day.  I'd avoid this place at all cost if you are here for the buffet.

There was a decent size line to get in the place even though we had a reservation. The line is for all customers, so there were a huge amount of people without a reservation ahead of us. I heard multiple people without reservation being told it was a 30 min wait to get a table, but to stay in line so they could go inside to put their name down. Why can't the person manning the line use a clip board or ipad to do this? Keeping people with reservations from their table only makes the wait longer for walk-ins. (On a separate visit months ago, also with a reservation party and I had to wait to get our table more than 10 mins after the time we reserved because it wasn't ready yet)\\n\\nOn to the food and drink. Most of the table ordered burgers and sandwiches and two of us did not. Food took long enough that people wondered out loud when it might arrive. Burgers and sandwiches finally arrive. One friend is allergic to tomatoes and had informed the waitress but there were still two giant tomatoes in her burger (she was too shy to say anything so just took them off since cross contamination won't harm her). The friend and I who did not order sandwiches were told our plates would be out in just a second. Told friends not to wait to eat, but they insisted, until they realized our food was not coming anytime soon. Our food finally comes after everyone is halfway or more through with their meal. I ordered the modern bowl with avocado (one of three mix-in options), and my bowl showed up without it on the plate, waitress said avocado was on its way. I'm hungry so I start eating anyways. Once I get about halfway through the meal I finally see the waitress and ask about the avocado. She apologizes and says she'll check on it. Comes back a while later and says it on its way. A few minutes later comes half an avocado, grilled, still in the skin, making it very hard to remove skin completely to add to the few bites of food I had left.\\n\\nWent to visit washroom, and I could smell a putrid smell from the top of the stairs. Bathroom itself didn't smell as bad as I think there was air fresheners. Other people in the bathroom were commenting on the smell too so we chatted about it for a bit and ended up leaving at the same time. We noted the smell is the worst in the hallway and stairs, that the smell only goes away once you reach the open kitchen area. Gross! All of that nasty smell is wafting into the kitchen and is only masked because of food cooking smell. Makes me nauseous just thinking about it.\\n\\nWhen the dessert menus show up the waitress says that she will take my main off my bill and apologizes. This was very kind of her as I'm pretty sure it comes out of her own pocket and it wasn't her fault. We order dessert which also took some time. While waiting on dessert some other guests comment that theres seems to be quite a few waitresses/waiters who are standing around looking for things to do while there are a few running around doing everything. Two of us ordered lava cake and someone else ordered pie. Both lava cakes arrived cold, and both centres were nearly cooked through completely. Pretty pathetic and over priced, for a cake that clearly comes frozen from someplace outside the restaurant.\\n\\nHonestly I think this terrible experience comes down to two things. Bad management and a disorganized kitchen. Very easy things to fix but crucial to making sure guests have a good time. Being in company of great friends made saved the night, I just wish we had eaten somewhere else.

I usually don't get the sushi because all premade sushi seems to suffer from a decline in the rice quality. The hand rolls are probably the best choice out of the sushi cooler. The seaweed is separated from the rice and fish and you roll it yourself just before you eat it so the seaweed doesn't go soggy from the moisture in the filling.

The sushi here is excellent and ranks as some of the finest fish we've chomped on- be it Tokyo, NY, or SF (our previous cities of inhabitance).  Musashino is one of the few sushiyas that gets their rice right and the fish:rice ratio correct.  Restaurants can always mask the taste of their sushi with a ponzu sauce, a spicy whatever roll, or some other innovative concoction... don't get me wrong, they taste great but if you want to judge a sushi restaurant on their quality of sushi alone then try a plain order of nigiri maguro.  This is the benchmark for sushi and each one we've had at Musashino is consistently good.\\n\\nService is spotty- we've had it great, we've had it bad, and we've even had the Sushi Nazi that works the counter serve us...I believe he is the Master Sushi Chef as he alluded to it as we tried conversing with him in Japanese once.

I came in around 2:15 for a late lunch to order to go.  The host was friendly and helped make suggestions about what to order.  I ordered the vegetarian platter and took a seat at the bar to wait for my order.  I realize it's a weird time of day, but I found it very odd that no one was behind the bar.  No one asked me if I needed anything or even offered a glass of water while I waited.  There was only one other table of people there at the time, so  expected my food to come out quickly.\\n\\nWhile sitting at the bar, four staff members sat at the other end of the bar and apparently decided that is the appropriate place to sort through the clean silverware after their lunch rush.  Four people clinking silverware nonstop for 45 minutes is LOUD, by the way.  Had I gone to eat with someone else at the restaurant, there's no way we could hold a conversation over the level of noise.  Can this not be done in the kitchen??  It totally detracted from the bar atmosphere.\\n\\nAfter 45 minutes, my food still had not arrived and none of the four employees sorting silverware seemed to care that I had been sitting there with no attention that entire time.  I decided to go back up to the host to follow up on my order, but he wasn't even there.  After wandering around looking confused, the owner noticed me and apologized for my wait.  He let me know that no chefs were in the kitchen when my order was placed, so no one had made my food.  (How does that even happen?!?)  He said that he had stepped out for a bit but would never have let that happen if he had been there.  He assured me the food would be ready soon and that he was going to refund my order.  FINALLY, some good service!!  That satisfied me, and I was prepared to leave happy after all... until...\\n\\nThe owner said that my orders come with naan, so I thought well that's great, I hadn't realized that.  I don't know if I misunderstood him and he was saying they were out of naan or what, but there was definitely no naan in my bag.  Whatever, not a huge deal.  My biggest issue though is after all of this, THEY DIDN'T EVEN GET MY ORDER RIGHT!  I ordered a VEGETARIAN platter which is supposed to have 1 vegetarian appetizer, 2 vegetarian curries, naan, rice, and a dessert.  When I got home, I realized I had rice and 1 GOAT curry, no naan and no appetizer and no dessert.  Honestly how do you mess that up after 45 minutes??  It's great that they refunded me but this is not even remotely close to what I ordered.  Had I been a true vegetarian, I would have been pissed.  I eat meat, though, so I figured I would still give it a try.  I had no desire to walk back to the restaurant after the hot mess I'd endured.  I didn't really like the curry, but that may be due to the fact that I'm just not a huge fan of goat so others may have a different take on it.  I tried to eat some anyway because I was starving, but after finding more bones than anything else, I gave up on it and threw the rest out.  I should note that I'm not exaggerating about the amount of bones.  They literally made up 50% of my dish.  Some are skinny and sharp, others are huge, and some were so small I'd be scared I may swallow them or chip a tooth.  I don't know if this is normal in Indian dishes, but yikes, I will stay away from their meat dishes in the future.  I want to like this place as I live really close so I'll give it one more shot, but proceed with caution while they figure out how to operate a restaurant."},{"name":"Dan's Hamburgers - Austin","address":"5602 N Lamar Blvd","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"I have been eating at Dan's for 34 years.

Since transferring my prescriptions here over a year ago, I've had nothing but bad experiences here. These are the people who are supposed to be knowledgeable about my medications, side effects, etc and they can't even get things done in an efficient and timely manner. \\n\\nThe first issue came about when I requested extra medication because I was going out of the country. They said they'd call my doctor's office and insurance to get it rolling. One week later I call to check the progress and they haven't made any attempt to do either of those things and even have the gall to tell me that they don't remember me asking to do it. You don't remember? Don't you have some sort of system in place where you make notes about this kind of thing in order to ensure it gets done? These are the people who administer your medications...i sort of expect at least a minimum level of competency for such an important job...a mistake could mean someone getting seriously ill! \\nSo then I call my doctor myself to get the longer supply prescription sent over and once that's done i phone the pharmacy to let them know it's only the insurance that needs to be called now for approval. Two weeks later i come in again to hopefully pick up my medication and the woman at the counter (same one from last time) rudely pushes a number over the counter and tells me I have to call it to request a three month supply of my meds. I call the number and am told by my insurance that the number is for pharmacy use only and I should never have been directed to request a longer med supply, and that was the job of the pharmacy. When I tell the woman at the counter, she becomes indignant and I finally ask to speak to the actual pharmacist because there no way I'm leaving today without sorting this out now that I know they aren't in any hurry ( it's been three weeks since I first asked, I think I've been patient enough, I leave in three days now).\\nWhat if I was elderly and didn't heckle them for three weeks about getting my medication?

I also ask for my meds and am told they'll be ready soon. I go about my shopping and forty minutes passes. My friend goes to the counter and is told that they actually don't have his meds in stock and can he come back tomorrow...he was noticeably upset they hadn't even considered walking two feet to the waiting room and telling him this so he didn't waste forty minutes at the store.

The doors to the backroom open at 7:30pm. I showed up at 7pm, as suggested by the manager when I called, but I'd say showing up at 7:20 is sufficient for getting your desired seat. The room the show takes place in is a decent size. There are a few rows of chairs in front of the stage and then a number of tables (ideal for those ordering food) in the back of the room.\\n--The show is HILARIOUS! The format is a bunch of short stand-up bits from various comedians and then a 30 minute stand-up bit from the headliner. The short stand-up bits ranged from hilarious to just alright, but overall they were a good group. The headliner was absolutely hilarious and definitely the funniest (she was crowned the funniest person in Austin). They have a rotating line up so there might be some nights where it's not as funny, but it's free so there is absolutely no reason to skip it! I highly recommend you check it out! \\n\\nFood:\\n1) Triple Dip Combo (salsa, guacamole, and queso):\\nThe salsa had an odd flavor, the guac was very bland, but the queso was good. If you feel the need to have something to munch on, skip the sampler and stick with the $4 happy hour chips and queso since it was the only well made dip of the trio. \\n\\n2) The Ladybird (turkey burger):\\nThe Ladybird is supposed to have avocado on it, but they didn't include it for some reason. I'm not sure if they ran out or just forgot, but I was looking forward to that avocado because I think it pairs well with a turkey patty. Anyway, with or without it, the Ladybird is alright. It is nothing special, but it gets the job done if you're hungry. It comes with a side of fries, which I was a fan of.\\n\\n3) Creamy Chicken Penne Pasta:\\nThe pasta definitely has potential to be a pretty good dish, but the onions in it completely threw me off. They put WAY too many onions when there honestly shouldn't be any in the first place! The onions truly do not belong in the dish. Once I began picking around the onions, the pasta became much more enjoyable though.\\n\\nBottom line:\\n--Although the food was alright, I wouldn't recommend Austin Java as a dinner spot.

With dozens of local artists' work and kitchey things on the walls, its a true local place, locally owned and run.  \\n\\nTheir coffee and other drinks are definitely worth checking out. Their iced coffee is amazing and their green tea latte is unusually tasty and great with every sip. Their food and pastries are good as well. You can get a few things, hunker down and do what you need to do. Its not super loud, either, which can be blocked out by a pair of headphones and music. Its also worth mentioning that they have a large open window that when its nice out, the sun shines through so very nicely. Its great.\\n\\nAnother great feature is their pool tables. For 4 bucks an hour, its a decent deal.

Love the concept (and this area needs some good foodie places like this), decor was super cute. The only thing keeping it from a 5 was the under-trained staff. They were friendly, but clueless. The bowl is assembled along an assembly line (like Jersey Mikes/Chipotle), so it passed between 5 different employees. Somehow they couldn't manage to communicate my order from one person to the next. So they made it wrong twice before I finally gave up and just went with it. My husband paid before they finished with my bowl, but when I got to the end the cashier looked at my bowl critically. She asked her coworker if the ingredients I got were included (they were supposed to be) and the girl said she didn't think so. I chimed in that they were (referenced the menu). But she took her coworker's word over mine and rang me up for an extra $2. When she saw I was annoyed, she said they were getting in trouble for not ringing everything in. So my advice to the owners/managers is: 1) Train your employees better on the menu and what the ingredients are, and 2) Teach them customer service 101 - give the customer the benefit of the doubt. When your employees are more afraid of getting in trouble than of pissing off a new customer, you've focused on the wrong thing.\\n\\nI'll give them another chance because the food was good and I know new restaurants often have rough patches in the beginning.

The barg kabob and shis kabob were advertised as \\"filet mignon\\" but were actually skirt steak. I order filet mignon at almost every restaurant I review, and there is absolutely no way this was filet mignon despite being advertised as such. This is completely unforgivable, especially after spending $30 per person for dinner. The food wasn't good at all. The meat was chewy, tough, dry and over marinated. The rice lacked any flavor. The green peppers on the shis kabobs were actually banana peppers. The $4 side of vegetables were frozen and chewy. The bread was overcooked. All the food lacked any presentation. Service was friendly and good. We used to eat Mediterranean food every week for over 5 years when we lived in Chicago, and this was absolutely the worst we've ever had.

More people showed up at our party and even though the place was not busy at the late hour, the staff never tried to accomodate the extra people.   Again, the staff had an attitude that they were doing us a major favor, and seemed put off by the fact that they actually were waiting on us.

No Thanks. \\n\\nThen we spotted Stephanie's, on *duh* Newbury. As if, you were NOT to mistake this place for Stephanie's on Camden, or Stephanie's on Washington. Oh, no. THIS is Stephanie's on Newbury! \\n\\nI was ready to reach out and gnaw on a sparrow that kept landing not far from our table, I was so hungry. We ordered some fried green tomatoes. What on earth made me want to order a southern dish, smack dab in the College-Ave equivalent of the NorthEast? I told you, I was so famished. My best judgement doesn't occur when I am famished. \\n\\nThe fried green tomatoes had a heavy, thick crust on them (think a crab-claw or shrimp croquette) that ended with cornmeal. ALL WRONG- where's the light dredging of flour? The tomato within didn't have any seasoning on it (a pinch of good 'ol salt n' pepper is what it normally has) or even taste like a green tomato. It tasted like a tomato minion, like the ones in Bunnicula. \\n\\nThe clam chowder was not as creamy as I've had in other noreast places, but I prefer it this way. It did lack a clam flavor though, and hinted more of the smokey meat it held more of, and the plethora of potatoes made me refer to it as a potato chowder instead.\\n\\nI had the smoked salmon potato pancake- my mouth watered as I thuoght about the salmon boxty at Beckett's in Berkeley. What came to my table was barely edible. The mixed greens dressed with a light vinagrette was artfully contained within a smoked salmon retaining circle, but the potato pancake foundation it all rested on was what I would call a TRAGEDY. It looked deep fried, was very hard to cut into (even with a knife) and the inside texture was akin to an overbaked potato- dry and dense. I had one bite, gave one small sample to JR who made a face, and we banished it for the rest of the meal.\\n\\nJR's lobster pot pie sounded good in theory. In presentation it was better than it tasted- it held lots of plump, juicy chunks of lobster meat but the sauce was so creamy, if they pureed the whole thing in a blender you would have cream of lobster bisque.\\n\\nStephanie, you have prime real estate.

DELISH. It was browned just right, the flavors were wonderful, and the entire meal made me feel like I had been invited to a family picnic on the the lake. The tarter sauce - which I normally HATE - was actually quite interesting. A lot of lemon juice and a different texture made it very enjoyable for me. I was able to try my boyfriend's buttermimlk chicken (a boneless breast), very fresh cole slaw, and mashed potatoes. Everything was wonderful and the table of 17 had all smiling faces by the end of the night.\\n\\nYou can't wrong with the prices either.

Pretty standard stuff.\\n\\nAfter unsuccessfully browsing the menu for about 5 minutes, I decided to ask the waitress if it was possible to swap an item for another in some of their dishes. In particular, I was looking to swap the pulled pork in the carnitas scramble for just about anything (chicken, sausage, or just remove it altogether). This was sadly not possible, which leads me to believe this (and a few of their other dishes) are probably batch made beforehand, as opposed to being cooked-to-order. \\n\\nI ultimately decided to go with the Cobb salad as there wasn't anything else on their menu I fancied. The food came rather quick (again, pre-made?) and I was surprised to see the salad served in a taco bowl. In all honesty, it was quite embarrassing to be sat at such a restaurant and eat out of a taco bowl. First, a cobb salad has no connection to a taco bowl period. Furthermore, a taco bowl has no place at a restaurant like this (or any restaurant to be fair, even Chipotle is above that). The bowl added nothing to the salad as far as flavor or experience goes, and tasted like nothing.\\n\\nThe salad itself was mediocre at best. Some lettuce mixed with corn, a few slices of avocado, a couple pieces of blue cheese, and some very light dressing. It also came with grilled chicken, which had absolutely no flavor whatsoever and was very chewy. I ended up eating a few pieces and putting the rest off to the side. I opted out of the egg beforehand.\\n\\nThe plate the taco bowl was served on was small to begin with, and the bowl itself was very thick and took up a lot of space. This means there wasn't a lot of space for the salad, and I can with certainty say this was the smallest salad I've ever gotten as a main dish. \\n\\nAs far as pricing goes, the salad was $20. The other items were in the same range. I do not think this is the type of restaurant that can defend such a high price point for a salad, and certainly not worth what I was served. There are plenty higher-end nicer restaurants in the area that will serve you better food at a lower or comparable price. \\n\\nAs far as the service goes, it was lacking. To their defense it was a busy day, but not once did anyone ask how our meal was. When we were done no one took our plates away until we got tired of waiting after 15 minutes and asked for the check as our waitress passed by.\\n\\nThe restaurant itself is pretty nice though, and the location is great especially in the summer. Nothing beats people-watching on Newbury while enjoying a good cocktail. I am however sad to say I won't be coming back for brunch again."},{"name":"Bon Baguette","address":"13500 SW Pacific Hwy, Ste 92","city":"Tigard","stars":"4","text":"I've been waiting for this place to open since I shop at H-Mart all the time (it's located right across the parking lot from HMart)\\n\\nGot three sandwiches to go - #1 the special, #5 grilled chicken and BBQ pork (don't remember the number) Prices are slightly higher than Best Baguette or the joints on 82nd but pretty much in the $4/banh mi range. It's brand new so it's clean and spiffy (kinda reminds of Lee's Sandwiches but smaller) Staff are quite nice and while we didn't stay to eat, i did notice the staff being very accomodating and friendly to a family that was eating there.\\n\\nNow that I've gotten that out of the way...let's get down to the sandwiches which are just SAD.\\n\\nThe baguettes are too soft. If you take them to go, by the time you open your bag, it's close to hot dog buns in terms of texture. Strike one.\\n\\nWhere are the pickled radishes? And where is the soy sauce? (and even the carrots that were pickled barely tasted of any pickling. I actually picked out the carrots to make sure they were pickled because I didn't taste anything when I bit into my sandwich) All three sandwiches are so underseasoned that they were really bland. Are you trying to cater to the seniors that live in King City? Where is the flavor? Strike two.\\n\\nThe BBQ pork had gunks of inedible gristle. When I bit down and got a mouthful of gristle chewy soft (not in a good way) bun and no seasoning, I just had to spit it right out into the garbage can. I went digging into the sandwich to pick out the gristles. And still no flavor. I could claim this as the worst sandwich ever. Strike three.\\n\\nAt least the grilled chicken had some caramelized onions that added some flavor but still pretty bland. This is the only time I didn't want to finish any of the sandwiches. (And I will eat almost anything. even Hometown Buffet!)\\n\\nI've tried a good dozen banh mi places in and around Portland but this one doesn't even make the cut in terms of taste.

Some may say it's over-hyped, but here's what I observed:\\n\\n(a) FANTASTIC ambiance. Luxe, classy, lounge-y. Columbus sushi restaurants are typically larger than the sushi restaurants you'll find elsewhere (possibly because they serve other Asian foods, usually Thai) and this was no exception. They had one of those tables where you sit on pillows on the ground with your feet submerged beneath the floor. So sweet. We went on a Tuesday and it was pretty quiet, which was nice -- except for the small child at the table near us singing tonelessly for about 20 minutes. But I hear he is only there sometimes.\\n\\n(b) Knowledgeable and professional staff. True, I was a bit turned off by our server's overly-rehearsed uber-smooth spiel about the specials and \\"how you doing\\" and all that, but she was friendly, cracked jokes with us, and acted like she knew her stuff. (We didn't really test out her knowledge because we zoomed in on the party platter like it was the only thing on the menu.)\\n\\n(c) Reasonable prices! Surprisingly so. I barely glanced through their extensive menu (oh the paradox of choice -- it actually makes you less happy to have more options! look it up! science people) but I didn't see any prices on anything. The separate \\"specials\\" menu had prices on their fancy rolls, though, and they were surprisingly reasonable. Like, $7 for a specialty roll reasonable. (People, if you are going to go out for sushi, please expect a sushi price range!) We got a sushi party platter, which is 40 pieces consisting of nigiri & four rolls, for $48 -- not a bad deal, considering we could barely finish it between the two of us. I'd never gotten a big chef's choice \\"sushi boat\\" thing before, considering I like to micromanage my food - it makes me nervous to think someone else is deciding what I'll get to have when I could just order what I want. Plus, I worked at a sushi place for 3 years in college, and I always felt like those combination items were for people who didn't know what they wanted or didn't know sushi very well. But I decided to go with it, and it was fun - like a sushi adventure. However, I did order *one* thing besides the party platter because it caught my eye and sounded too amazing to pass up, and that brings me to my final point...\\n\\n(d) The Dragon Lady Roll. Oh my.

Walked in....noticed all the signs from around the world telling me what a fantastic burger I was going to get....blah, blah, blah.....So, the first thing i notice are the prices...yes there is a $5 burger...but wait no, it is really $5.29....and that is what you get a basic burger.....if you want cheese and maybe bacon (and who doesnt) mark that up to almost $7, and if you want a small fries add $3 and if you want a small drink add $2.....do your basic combo meal is going to cost you $12 plus tax....I opted for burger and drink only and paid a little over $9...for a burger....so I am thinking this is going to be GREAT!...right?  First problem...I order my burgers (and all my meat) medium-rare because I actually LIKE the taste of meat....well...but not here.....\\"well done is the only way we serve them\\" says the little girl behind the counter......and she adds \\"because the state says we have to!\\"......well, sweety, i am not sure what \\"state\\" you are in but here in Texas we dont have a \\"well done\\" law.....so she backs up and says \\"well, we serve them well-done because the company says we have to!\\"......and there you have it....anyway you like it as long as it is well done.  So, fighting the urge to pack up and move on down Guadalupe, I go ahead and order....order was out quick....about 3-4 minutes.....and she was right...well-done.  The meat tasted bland...not just well done, but well done and unseasoned....the burger meat at Wendys has more flavor...hell, roadkill would have more flavor.  I am guessing that they load it up with lettuce, tomatoe, pickles and mustard/mayo is to hide the fact that the burger has no flavor of its own.  Thank God I added cheese and bacon as those were the only two flavors I tasted.  So....not cheap, not cooked anyway but well-done and no flavor.  Can't say that i will be back or recommend it.  On a side note - grabbed a burger at Phils on Burnet next to Amy's......also expensive, but burger had flavor and I could order a beer.....much better bet for your $12....."},{"name":"Kadoya Japanese Restaurant","address":"1063 Davie St","city":"Vancouver","stars":"3.5","text":"Now I can comment about the service, which is odd since I was getting take out.

Get the Brussel Sprouts n' Cauliflower for starters! It wasn't anything I was expecting - the vegetables were fried (nice and crispy) and the original bitter taste was masked by the delicious balsamic and garlic flavour, so it was sweet, salty, and tangy. We also got steak, ribs, salad, tortiglioni, which were all amazing too. I got the mushroom cheesey burger, which also came with a bunch of crispy, hand-cut fries that I literally could not stop eating. My mouth is watering just recalling this meal. The chef, Gordon, was also kind enough to let us try a new dish he was making for the menu: gnocchi with truffle oil and onion strings. I didn't know gnocchi could be so good.\\nHighly recommend this place. It's only run by 2 people (I think just Gordon and the server, Paige) so it's super impressive that they were able to serve everything up in a timely manner, though I'll admit it was quite empty when my family and I were there for dinner. There was also a special being served when I was there, spotted prawn bisque. I learned from Gordon that a ton of work (like days worth of prep) and ingredients go into making it, and it really showed through when I tasted it.

The owner is a really sweet guy. He channels his warmth into everything he serves, but it doesn't hurt that he's an excellent cook. The falafel here is probably the best in the city--they are garlicky and crispy, but not oily at all. Very well executed, and a great vegetarian option.\\n\\nAs wonderful as the falafel is, I am always seduced by the shwarma. To the uninitiated, shwarma is marinated chicken, cooked slowly on a spit until It's completely succulent, whereupon slivers of the meat are stuffed into a fresh pita. The shwarma forms some kind of a synergy with the delicious hummus, tahini, and optional fresh, homemade hot sauce (it's called \\"harif\\" in Hebrew--this is the real deal. Timid American palates get the smoky baba ganoush instead). Last time I went I actually noticed two types of harif: North African-style, made from fresh red chilis, and Yemeni-style, made from green chilis. Get both if you dare.\\n\\nWhere this place really, really shines, though, are the virtually unlimited salads and toppings you can put on your sandwich/platter. My favorites include the chopped, fried eggplant, which goes great with the creamy tahini (sesame-based) sauce, pickled peppers, and the requisite tomato and cucumber salad that cools off your sandwich and gives it a nice crunch. Last time I tried the mango-vinegar sauce, an Iraqi speciality, and it was great. You can really go crazy here.\\n\\nThough the portions are generous, some friends of mine have wondered about the prices. They are slightly higher than what you might expect because this place is kosher, which means it conforms to very strict rules about the quality and origin of the meat it serves, and it is continually and rigorously monitored  by kosher authorities. Point being, if Sarah Palin had been vetted anywhere near this seriously, she would not have a show on Fox News right now.

The boisterous atmosphere of jm Curley's melts away as you enter a 40's-esque, speakeasy space with calmer music and quieter voices. Exclusive yet comfortable, you feel well taken care of. Considering we were the only diners for the first hour of our meal, our server (shout out to Domingo!) was attentive and friendly but not overbearing. Everything feels balanced, everything feels right.\\n\\nThe atmosphere flows right into the food. The basket of warm cheddar biscuits are served with honey butter which is salted at the table. The details are impeccable, and the taste even better. \\n\\nOur Gilt City offer was a 3-course meal with wine pairings. For appetizers, we could choose the wedge salad or the oysters. However, since they didn't have the oysters that night, Domingo said we could pick something off of the regular appetizer menu. The mussels fra diablo it is! This dish is comforting with a nice spice, and the wedge salad was the steak of salads, loaded up with blue cheese dressing, bacon, and croutons. We had to pace ourselves here, as these 2 dishes alone could have easily been our meal. This starting course was made even more splendid by the accompanying bubbles, which Domingo poured generously and often.\\n\\nFor the entrees, our options were the NY strip steak and the roasted lemon thyme chicken. One of each, please! Surprisingly, for a restaurant known for its meats, the chicken was the stand-out dish in my opinion. The lemon and thyme played beautiful with the gamey poultry. The steak, ordered medium, was prepared just right with a pink center and served with a large pat of butter on top and a tangy wine sauce on the side. The drink pairing was a fruity red which made both dishes even more delectable.\\n\\nThe dessert course brought a cinnamon strudel bread pudding with accompanying glass of sherry. The sherry was sweet, and the pudding was warm. Although the bread was tough in parts and rather heavy, it was a comforting finish to a hearty meal.\\n\\nPulling back the curtain to leave, it's a shock to reenter the loud jm Curley's and be ripped from the era of Bogie's.

When our waiter came to our table, we were blown away at his service and how nice he was - probably the only reason we would come back. When we first got our margarita, the entire pitcher tasted like that last sip that you don't want to waste but it so watered down that it's disgusting. Once we told our waiter he brought us a better one but still wasn't the best margarita we've ever had. Once we poured it into our glass it had more than a few floaties, very disappointing for a fixed drink. The food was luke warm and mostly forgettable but the drink was enough to not drive home ourselves. I guess I would say okay for a drink to get drunk but not good to enjoy the taste of the drink or the food."},{"name":"Stephanie's On Newbury","address":"190 Newbury St","city":"Boston","stars":"3","text":"Came here on a Thursday night around 8:00.

About 15 minutes after finishing she came over and we asked to see a dessert menu - 15 more minutes passed and no menu.

But, regardless, I ordered it, expecting it to be filling for dinner for just me, and it cost about $9, and I ordered their Caipirinha based cocktail for $10! And, it was truly amazing!! I was impressed by the drink, but overall for the amount of money I spent, my stomach was not satisfied.  I probably should have ordered their vegetarian banh mi for something a little filling, but again, it's hard to justify paying almost $10 for those, when you can get delicious ones for around $5.

The decor is really nice -- the owners have done an outstanding job of refurbishing the old State Theater into a charming restaurant.  \\n\\nAs for the food -- my wife ordered the Bistro salad which was excellent.  I ordered the corn chowder in a tomato puree which came off tasting like a cross between chili and corn chowder. In fact, it leaned a little more towards chili than corn chowder.  The menu is relatively short -- only 1 beef entree ($37), 1 chicken, 1 pork, 1 veggie and 2 fish entrees.  My wife went with the salmon ($27) which was very good but not great,  I had the halibut ($30) which was also very good but not great and the portion was not overly large.  All in all -- the food was very good but not quite what I was expecting for the price.

However, when my entree arrived, my high from the Queso was gone.  I thought I ordered carnitas, but after looking at my plate...not so much.  The correct way to cook carnitas is a slow slow process.  You shred pork and low heat cook it in a spicy sauce...for hours.  See, the timing is important because cooking pork that slow will make it so tender a spoon can cut through it.  Not to mention the immense flavor.  Well...my plate was cubed pork that I couldn't cut through with a CUTCO steak knife.  Trying to chew through the fat and gristle was another thing.  This was the worst representation on Carnitas I have ever seen, and trust me, I have seen some bad ones.  \\n\\nI should have expected a Tex-Mex place to not be able to m ake an AUTHENTIC Mexican Dish, but I was trying to be a believer in miracles.

The only problem was that we honestly couldn't figure out which sandwich was which, and think there may have been a mix up.

The atmosphere was great and the music was in the background, mainly Spanish guitar music that fit the place and food.

Tasca was absolutely perfect in this regard.\\n\\nThe food: They make their own bread, served with a bean paste as a complimentary appetizer and it couldn't have been more yummy. We finished it and were quickly asked by a wait staff if we wanted more (without having to ask ourselves!).

Both were OK, but nothing great, and at this point in the evening, we were already more than $30 in.\\n\\nFor dinner, we both got the Green Goodness which is gnocchi with roasted vegetables in an almond milk sauce.

The service is good, sometimes they can be a little rude but I'm sure it has to do with how busy it gets sometimes. Sometimes the lines are REALLY long, and I've had to leave a few times because I just don't have time to wait. But if you call and place your order ahead, you can go in and pick it up and skip the long line. It could be a little cleaner in there, and even a little remodeling might be nice. The prices are extremely fair for how fresh everything is, and the variety of bagels they have is crazy. Overall, I've never been upset leaving there, because as soon as the bagel gets to my tummy I'm happy."},{"name":"Waffle House","address":"1227 Virginia Ave","city":"East Point","stars":"3.5","text":"It's  kinda hard to write a review for this place because it's Waffle house. It's a hit or miss for me. Luckily this one was pretty consistent. Not the best or fastest  service bit it did the job. I would rather come here  than any other ones in the area. It's tucked away by alot of other restaurants so I figure if they want to make some money. You have to step that serving game up."},{"name":"Yuzu","address":"4130 SW 117th Ave, Ste H","city":"Beaverton","stars":"4","text":"Followed the trail of other yeeps and found this hidden gem and every word you read from the others is true.   Had the Kakuni Ramen and kimchi springroll--both were really satisfying.  The brined, slightly sweet pork belly chunks in the ramen broth were absolutely silken.  I didn't detect the spicy pickled kimchi flavor from the spring rolls.  It was more like a pork-laced fried cheese stick---and I would absolutely buy these in volume if I could.\\n\\nMy wife had a simple and deliciously clean stir-fry of bok choy and shiitake mushrooms with major flavor.  Slightly sweet with the right savory counter.  \\n\\nWhole meal + soft drinks was just under $30.  We'll definitely hit this place again!"},{"name":"MidiCi The Neapolitan Pizza Company","address":"999 Peachtree St, Ste 120","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3.5","text":"Good food and the music is best I've heard in 4 years living in Atlanta, better than the clubs. Finally owners that know good music and not the BS yank shite! Thank fuck!\\nTop notch, Defo more European than yank!"},{"name":"Felipe's Taqueria","address":"83 Mt Auburn St","city":"Cambridge","stars":"4","text":"When this place first came on the scene I loved it. There's nothing better than a cheap, fast, tasty lunch. The regular size burritos were just over $3.00, which made a lot more sense to me than getting some sort of warm asparagus and mushroom sandwich at Hi Rise for $9.50. (And if you add the cold leek bisque, it's like $15.00!) \\n\\nBut after awhile Felipe's started to seem . . . um, sort of skanky to me. Maybe it was all the gelatinous fat accumulating in the carnitas bin, or maybe it was the sweaty cashiers in their too-small shirts, but pretty soon I found myself veering in new directions. I'll definitely go back to Felipe's again, but it's no longer my default lunch destination."},{"name":"Tasca Restaurant","address":"1612 Commonwealth Ave","city":"Brighton","stars":"4","text":"I love the Sangria here. I am tempted to do unsavory things to get the recipe but I wont... I promise. I go in here quite often. It is a great little neighborhood gem. I have really loved about 90% of the things I have tried here. some of my faves include: The Duck Leg, the ham and chicken croquettes (the romesco sauce is delish!) the tenderloin meatballs and petite fillet. The leek tart is good but small for $5. The gambas smell delish and always delight a table of 2 or more. It is a fun dish to pick at but I wouldn't order it just for myself because it is really just small shrimp cooked in garlic and oil. They have done the right thing by changing the escargot dish to a more traditional  one, but my only complaint there is the bread isn't so great so it kind of defeats the purpose of getting the escargot. This is my first review ever but those of you who follow me will see I am \\"a dipper\\" through and through. I like my sauces and bread! I digress... Tasca is the best deal for a real meal around, check out their stimulus menu and you won't be disappointed!"},{"name":"Brookline Lunch","address":"9 Brookline St","city":"Cambridge","stars":"4","text":"Delicious breakfast, huge portion, cheap price and beautiful people.
