Also, don't go here if you're really hungry - only if you want a small and very expensive snack.\\n\\nAs someone who grew up in Asia eating Rotis on a regular basis, I was very disappointed by whatever it is that Hat Yai is calling Roti and curry.  I tried both the vegetarian and the chicken curries. Both were way too sweet, and the vegetarian curry had 4 miserable small vegetable pieces in it.\\n\\nFinally, the pricing is just shocking. Let me just warn you that the Rotis are suuuuper small. And the curry is very unsubstantial as well. So I basically paid $20 ($11 for chicken curry and $9 for vege) for 2 incredibly small pieces of rotis, and disappointing curries.  Total rip off.\\n\\nWe left feeling so hungry and cheated. In Asia, you can get a high quality authentic roti, with free curry, for just $0.75 a piece; $1 for Roti with egg. Now, I understand that cost doesn't translate comparably across nations, and that these foods are considered specialty items here whereas they're common place in Asia. But usually the food quality and quantity justify the cost, but not in this case.\\n\\n*Edited my original review to remove statements about them using frozen Roti. I was mistaken in that aspect.

Unbelievable.\\n\\nWe also ordered the Knackwurst, the New York Board, the mixed grill, and the sampler appetizer. The knackwurst with the pretzel bun is amazing.

How do ya screw up a meatball?\\nThe only thing I really enjoyed was the sweet potato fries. They were perfect in every way. Served with a sour cream dipping sauce. Huge portion. \\nThis is the third time I have been to this place. I like to try out a place a few times before writing a review.

There are two choices of pizza: pesto or cheese, and then you build your own.  We had a large which was 8 slices, 2 pieces a person, but no left overs :(  There is a small pizza as well.  I would recommend for 4 ppl to get a large and a small, to have leftovers for lunch the next day.

All of their rolls I've tried are tasty and they are not soaked in mayonnaise or other sauces like some sushi restaurants do. If you like hot tea, definitely get a pot of their green tea, it is genmaicha--green tea with roasted rice and has a yummy, subtle rice flavor. Tempura veggies are a great starter for the meal, a super light coating on tender crisp vegetables with a light dipping sauce. If you're low carbing it, there's a great option for that too--you can get a vegetable and meat plate served over your choice of salad instead of over rice."},{"name":"Subway","address":"1187 Highland Ave","city":"Needham","stars":"2.5","text":"Average subs, easy to get to and convenient.

We could see many other tables struggling with late food, as well, each with a manager fake apologizing to them, too. \\n\\nThe food had taken so long to get to us that it was cold when arrived at our table, which seemed odd given their explanation that it was the kitchen that was backed up.

She said the bacon couldn't be added to the omelette but it could be a side plate. I said okay.  And then I was charged $3 for a plate of bacon. This is not what I asked for nor how I understood the substitution. Since she failed to inform me of the charge, I refused to pay.

So we picked a Friday night and headed over right after work, got there about 6:15ish and low and behold, the place was already jumping and jiving.  \\n\\nThe experience really wasn't what I expected it to be.  The restaurant is much smaller than I imagined, which added to its charm.  Tables are set up in a diner-like fashion, but the lighting makes you forget that.  Light fixtures are cool once you notice them.  The bar seemed popular, apparently there was some local hot shot bartender that night.  Mixed drinks were noted as being very good.\\n\\nFood was definitely the best part of the night for me.  I left that place extremely satisfied and very impressed.  I had; shared a short rib app, some beet/goat cheese salad, and the winter vegetable pot-pie (special).  I also had several drinks and the bill was much less than I figured it'd be.  \\n\\nAside from the amazing food, nice atmosphere, great drinks, good locale, good service, & good prices, this place gets 5 stars from me solely because they managed to get me to eat brussel sprouts in the pot pie, which I somehow enjoyed very much.\\n**********************************\\nEdit: The veggies here are just amazing, they must get them from a local farm.

I ask for mine well-done as a rule everywhere i go.  They added some great stuff to the menu and the bar list.  Huge list of toppings for pizza, really anything you could want.  They will make any special orders or anything you want too.  Salads are great too, the beer is cold and the Chianti flows freely.

Everyone hustles, works as a team and obviously really cares about taking care of people and making great food.  They are proud of what they do and it shows.  They are friendly and really make you feel welcome.  Last time i was there I had to politely stop my server from re-filling my water every time i took two sips.

We passed the list around and handed them to the waiter. While P's language skills were not needed in the ordering, they came in handy when we had to stop items coming out since we totally over ordered. Lesson 1, with 4 hungry men, you should probably do a check on the ordering before blithely handing the list to the waiter. All items were good to great and the bill was reasonable considering how much food we had.\\n\\n* We tried the Sampan Congee, very good.\\n* We had 2 types of Turnip cake dishes and while they were redundant (see above) they were also tasty. Turnip cake with XO sauce was \\nsweeter, than the \\"Pen Fried Turnip cake\\" (i think they mean \\"pan\\" or not?). The former was cut into bite size pieces and served fresh bean sprouts. I preferred that.\\n* Beef tripe, chicken feet, sticky rice in lotus leaf, chow mein noodles, scallion pancake, ha gow and shu mai, were good but not standouts. \\n* Xiao Long Bao were the larger type, say a 3.5 out of 5.\\n* A few things like some of the buns we ordered I didn't try yet, but took some in a doggy bag.\\n* Totally legit alternative Dim Sum choice. \\n* Next trip here it's all about the soups.

The others ordered white wine or beers on tap.  Shared an order of roasted cauliflower (it had a great indian spices coating on it) and roasted brussel sprouts.  Some restaurants make them too greasy.  This was just perfect.  I had the salmon for the entry.  It was a very large portion, but was farmed and not wild caught.  This is disappointing because it IS the season for wild salmon.  The waiter did tell me it was farmed but that it had an interesting strawberry sauce.  The sauce was good and an excellent pairing with the mild fish.  I did not finish the fish because it was big and I am just not a fan of farmed (not enough flavor).  We split 2 desserts - the fried pound cake (we had wanted something else - cannot remember what - but they were out of it).  We also shared the Pavlova and it was big and with great whipped cream.

This is a place that  should have no trouble selling many folks from the get-go. The lady has mad charisma, and doesn't mind lettin' the gents know she's 58 years young (probably b/c she knows she's still looking good, certainly no more than about 35). She's had this cart here 9 months, and loves being in business there.\\n\\n\\n2.) Though blessed w/sundry charms (see above), ole girl was a little scatter-brained. Granted, it was close to the end of the day for her.  I asked for a combo plate to try as many of the meats as possible, and as spicy as she could make it.  She then pointed me to the ATM across the street. After returning from Peterson's a few blocks away, and telling her the closer ATM was all locked up, she said of the ATM, ie, the one she had just directed me to, \\"Oh, I know--- they're always shut down there, I don't know why\\"........ ????\\n\\n\\n3) Related to item #2, when I checked out my boxed up order, I saw that she had  made just the ribs. Hey, mis-communications happen, and if this was the worst thing that happened all day, I knew it was gonna be a friggin' f-a-n-t-a-s-t-i-c day! So I proceeded to (re) order the other meats: the pulled pork and hot link and by all means, pretty-please \\"make it hurt, don't go easy on me\\" w/the spice...\\n\\n\\n 4) When I finally got to sample her cooking later on, there was no heat detectable in any of the meat. No sir. This was KC, how sweet it is to be loved by you style. Lots of people love their BBQ this way. My teeth hurt just thinking about it.\\n\\n\\n5) The sides were, on the whole, the best part of the experience. The mac n cheese was insanely, gooey cheesy; almost soupy it was so generous w/ the queso. The greens were ok; she said she used smoked turkey instead of swine, which is fine by me, though I detected little if any turkey or smoke factor. The yams, which came highly acclaimed, lived up to the love. FINALLY, someone understands the proper ratio of nutmeg and vanilla, etc!! Along with Campbell's, these are the best yams I've had in Portland---- and possibly even the best. I have a very limited capacity to enjoy sweets, and this hit the spot perfectly. What can I say, to my way of thinking, yams can be sweet (though I also like em just buttered or w/a little seasoning sometimes, too), but meat should rarely if ever be....\\n\\n\\n6) In keeping w/the Grid-Iron themed-nomenclature, I asked the lady if she actually liked football, to which she gave a quizzical expression as though to say, \\"Boy, from what planet do you come, bringing forth such questions?\\" she then gave what I thought seemed like a highly impressionistic, stream of consciousness answer about devoting her Sundays entirely (and more than a little grudgingly, if I gauged her response correctly) cooking for the men in the family, who were in charge of the football watchin' and lovin'..."},{"name":"Moondogs","address":"3179 Peachtree Rd NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3.5","text":"Was relatively cheap, but definitely a young college bar.

Signatures is located right in the heart of downtown Gahanna across from the new Pigskin Brewery, and it has some great patio seating in the front facing Mill St. as well as the back where there looks to be a stage for live music. The inside is fairly large and has TVs on all the walls for some great sports viewing, and the bar looked to be stocked with local brews on tap! If this was a little closer to my 'hood, I'd probably be here all the time.\\n\\nAs far as the food goes, it's pretty straight forward pub grub with sandwiches, burgers, wings, etc. My buddy and I went with the buffalo chicken sandwich; mine was fried (of course) and his was grilled. I opted for the Hot sauce on mine, and it comes with tomatoes and onions and ranch or blue cheese dressing on the side. Well, the server thought we had ordered salads apparently, so those came out and we had to send them back. Luckily, the place was pretty much empty, so it didn't take too long to get new food. It happens.\\n\\nThe sandwiches were both tasty, and they gave me three, fairly large chicken strips on mine. The hot sauce had a nice kick to it, and I really like their ranch dressing.

At 5'4\\", I was the tallest of our group.\\n\\nGiven the size of the portions, I figured we'd share.  We saw the note on the menu saying that entrees can't be split, but we figured they'd say something if they weren't ok with it.  We ordered, our waitress waited a sec to see if anything else was coming, and that was it. We'd selected additional entrees if she wanted us to order one each, but she seemed to be ok with it and left without saying a word.\\n\\nThe food was, of course, absolutely delicious.  The 1-star rating comes from the fact that as the waitress brought our check, she rudely remarked quite loudly that they normally don't allow shared entrees, but that she'd let it slide this time. I pointed to our party and commented that they were tiny (even with the shared portions, we were still taking a LOT of food home), but she was indignant and reiterated that it was their policy.\\n\\nShe returned to the back where the other waitresses were standing and started talking to the other servers about our table.  It was extremely obvious, as they talked and stared at our table while we were finalizing the bill.\\n\\nI would have been fine if she'd asked us to order more entrees at the beginning, but to take a condescending tone at the end of the meal and then to blatantly talk about us with the other servers was unacceptable.  If she was really doing us a favor, she certainly didn't make us feel that way.  And to make it worse, she made no attempt to be discreet about it, speaking loudly enough for other tables to hear.

I haven't been back to eat because the lack of people in the place is eerie around dinner time. This visit, we simple partook of the full bar offerings. My friend ordered a couple of different bourbons, none of which were his more favored varieties.

Apparently, the bartender usually \\"warns\\" people who order the Pear that it's not what they expect... I tried it, it was awful... if the bartender has to warn folks to order it - just take it off the menu - and by the way - the Mi Amor is $1 less than the Pear - and though she didn't charge for the second Mi Amor, she didn't (supposedly couldn't) remove the Pear from the bill, so we effectively paid an extra dollar for the pleasure of a few disgusting sips of a drink that should be abandoned all together.

They're really unique and great that you can customize them how you like. \\n\\nAnother great part is the desserts! The blueberry cheesecake and the chocolate mousse were both amazing. Not only do they look beautiful but they taste just as good. They're small, which is a good thing when you're eating around the park all day (but also stinks because they're too good to end).

Despite being outside of the city, this Saugus location definitely gets busy on weekend evenings, so come early or expect a wait.\\n\\nI've recently started ordering a cup of their gumbo as an appetizer when I come here, and I haven't looked back since.

Needless to say, they are terrific as well.\\n\\nAtmosphere-wise, this place feels festive (there always seem to be a bunch of family dinners, birthday parties, and other celebrations going on...), and do be warned that it can get a bit noisy - but if your goal is to have a fun evening out, and have a drink or two without going totally broke, Border Cafe is your place."},{"name":"Rino's Place","address":"258 Saratoga St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"Holy cow!

Lights!  Action!  Arrrrgggghhh! \\n\\nThe latter  is my not so appreciative primal scream reaction for what otherwise might have been a four star experience for creative menu, good food and good service.  But the experience was diminished at dinner by too bright lighting and way, WAY, too loud music of a thumping beat mix discordant for pleasant, casual fine dining of the sort Accanto wants to provide.  Were I working out or dancing at a club or cleaning house I might enjoy the high volume, energetic beat.  For an evening here, not so much.  Given the plethora of great food options in Portland, while we're \\"AOK\\" happy to have tried Accanto and checked it off our \\"go to\\" list we likely won't make this destination again for some time.  \\n\\nVIBE\\nHigh ceilings, industrial meets classic, lots of windows for light filled space.  Too bright lighting and too loud, thumping music diminishes the experience.  Turn down the night time lighting and fix the music and this could be \\"ahhhh...\\" instead of ARRRRGGGHHHH. \\n\\nSEATING\\nHigh stools at bar and a table at the back of the restaurant.  Otherwise, all standard height seating; a very good thing!  Tables along window in front and along wall at side of the space might provide the best seating for being \\"in the vibe\\".  Seating is cheek to cheek, north cheeks and south cheeks, tight here.  You will know the details of your neighbors discussions whether you want to or not.\\n\\nMENU & FOOD\\nCreative and Italian themed menu divided into Antipasti (@$5), Primi ($8 - $13), Riso e Pasta ($14 - $18), Secondi ($21 - $23), Contorni ($6 - $7).  (Dessert menu offered separately with classics like Tiramisu @$8 or Affogat@$5.)\\n\\nWe started with a chickpea and caponata Primi.  Given my hubby's Sicilian heritage, we enjoy a fair amount of caponata and this was the first time we've been served that eggplant dish warm.  We liked it.\\n\\nI was only lukewarm on the lamb bolognese lasagna for flavor, texture and temperature at service.  (See A Cena for how to get this dish perfect from my view. Different strokes for different diners.)  My husband loved the papparadelle with braised rabbit, apples and chesnuts that was his choice.   The Brussel sprouts with chiles and anchovy as contorni choice were excellent.  These alone along with bread would be a great light meal.\\n\\nBread is a $2 charge here for Ken's Artisan served with Jacobsen Salt.  Bread service costs restaurants money and I am a supporter of them charging for it when they serve this top quality product.  \\n\\nLIBATIONS\\nInteresting and thoughtfully crafted wine list of  NW and Italian wines by glass and bottle.  Prices on par with other restaurants in class with glasses from $7 - $13 and bottles from $29 - $95.  Cocktails are @$9.  I liked the Sgroppino (prosecco, vodka, sorbet) I ordered. \\n\\nSERVICE\\nFriendly and efficient even if not as warm and polished as some of their \\"in class\\" competitors like A Cena and Ava Genes, both of which set the bar.   As example here, on two pretty basic questions for ingredients in two dishes, the server - who was clearly not a new recruit - had to check with the kitchen.  In this kind of restaurant, servers should know that through training or nightly line up.  And there was just the slightest bit of \\"we're too hipster for our customers and aren't they lucky to be here\\" in the tenor of service.  Unlike A Cena and Ava Genes where the tenor is \\"we are so glad to have you here tonight\\" for service. \\n\\nVALUE\\n1 Primi + 2 Pasta + 1 Contorni + 1 Glass Wine + 1 Cocktail + 1 Dessert = @$80  for dinner for two. \\n\\nTHIS N THAT\\n\\n1) RECENT HOURS CHANGE:  When we were there a few weeks ago, Accanto opened for dinner at 5:30p after lunch service from 11:00 - 3:00.  As we waited in our car on a cold Sunday night for them to open at 5:30, we saw other couples try the locked door (given the lights on inside) and leave.  Now Accanto is open straight through from lunch to dinner hour with the introduction of \\"cocktail hours\\" from 3:00 to 5:30.  Nice change.\\n\\n2) ACCESSIBILITY:  Level in and throughout.  Most tables are standard height.\\n\\n3) PARKING:  On street and can be tough to find in evenings. \\n\\n4) NEIGHBOR:  Fine dining, prix fixe restaurant Genoa, parent to Accanto, is next door."},{"name":"Border Cafe","address":"356 Broadway","city":"Saugus","stars":"3.5","text":"This place is always packed.

I am still mourning the ten bucks I spent there. I am shocked that it's not been shut down by the health department. I accidentally stumbled in because I had some errands to run in the shopping center. Boy, was that a bad idea. When my friend and I walked in we were hit by a blast of hot air, clearly the place was skimping on air conditioner. No one even noticed that we'd walked in. Before we were (finally) seated I went to the restroom.  The back of the place had a vague urine smell that became more pungent as I opened the restroom door. The toilet handle had been duct taped together. I should have gone running then. My friend and I were hungry though and had committed to an order of waters and plates. As we perused the buffet I quickly came to the realization that all of this meat looked perfectly horrible and I'd be sticking to more vegetarian fare. My brave friend confirmed that the meat was indeed horrible. I stuck with something that might have once been green beans and white rice and crab rangoon. The beans were drenched in oil, the rice smelled and tasted like it had been cooked in a dirty sock. The crab rangoon were rock hard and flavorless. Perhaps the most disturbing thing about this place was the amount of raw oysters sitting out in the  open along with sushi. Only someone with guts of steel would dare try either of these. The only mildly okay tasting thing we got was soft serve icecream (from a machine that looked as if it had never been cleaned) and the Chips Ahoy cookies serve on the dessert tray.

This was the cause of great mockery on Yelp and indeed the surrounding community. In addition, some of the mockery was earned in that, at the time, Holy Taco just wasn't that good. I'd eaten there a few times in those early days and walked away, head shaking, and preferring La Casita Cantina a hundred or so yards to the west. Sure the space, a converted gas station and taken over from the beloved Iris, was still pretty, but the menu did little to differentiate itself. AND they charged for chips in those early days.\\n\\nBut as time went on, La Casita closed and perhaps not so coincidently, Holy Taco stepped up its food game. They expanded their menu to include more \\"authentic\\" Mex fair. When elote (roasted corn on the cob), I took notice. Other things were added. Lingua (beef tongue?) Fried chicken hearts? Sure, it took a little time to shake off those initial feelings toward the place, but eventually I did. Now this is the sort of restaurant I can order a heaping plate of arugula and sardines, topped with a Meyer lemon vinaigrette and a shot of tequila.\\n\\nIn retrospect, I'm glad they stuck around. They provide both flour and corn tortillas, so my gluten-free wife is glad too. (Though she's not a big fan of their chips, since they've got a heft to them that she doesn't dig.

The service is great. The restaurant space is large so there shouldn't be a wait.

I used to love this place. And normally I would not post a bad review, but I'm not so sure now.  I used to go in for the BBQ chicken sandwich with cheese and bacon and it was utterly delish. And I loved sitting on the patio in the spring and fall for some relax time with friends.  I still love the patio, but not the food, or the service. Tell me peeps...what happened??!!\\n\\nHere is my story and Im sticking to it. \\n\\nI walked there with some local neighborhoodies on a Thurs night around 6pm.  There was NO ONE on the patio but our group of 6 people.  The inside was rather busy and small, but we didn't think it would be a problem to get a quick bite.  Two adults with us has 11 month old babies, but they weren't cry babies and they were sitting in their highchairs content. We all ordered a round of beers, then some food about 20 mins later.  Our server was actually nice, but I think she was overwhelmed. We were informed that she was training a server that night, and they only had one other server on.  Most of us have been in the biz before, so we understood that service might be a bit slower than usual.  Next thing we know it is 7:45pm and we still haven't got our food yet.  At 8:00pm, still no sign of our food. One person from our table went in to see what was going on.  She ended up asking to speak with the manager and the owner came out.  He was not friendly and did not help the situation at all.  He approached my friend, his patron, in a high anxiety defensive attitude right off the bat.  She explained what happened, and he actually printed out the server ticket, brought it over to my friend, and stated that we \\"didn't order until 7:20pm, so it is not his fault that the food isn't out yet.\\" First of all the ticket showed that the server forgot to put our order in.  \\n\\nBut Wait...I thought the restaurant caters to the customer?  \\n\\nWe are not a high maintenance group and were not looking for FREE anything!  We just wanted him to know that we had been sitting out there for an hour and a half waiting on sandwiches.  If they forgot to put in the order, fine...we probably would have been happy with an apology.  But the owner actually looked at my friend defensive and flustered and said \\"Im not giving you anything for free. You ordered late and we are busy.\\"  So we paid our tab which was $80 dollars or so. Half of us left, the other half waiting for the food to go. (which by the way they did not get until about 8:15pm)\\n\\nHe lost about 7 customers from the neighborhood that live within walking distance, and got a bad review. Over what?

I love BBQ and others can fight over which method of BBQ is the best but I appreciate ALL of the differing forms for what they are intended to be. Some say it is all about the smoke and some say it is all about the rub and some say it is all about the sauce. Pig Floyd's I will have to say fired on ALL cylinders. \\n\\nMost of my closest friends know that I am a hard sell on BBQ because living in Texas for a while gave be a passion for making BBQ. I make my own rubs and my own sauces and after about three years was able to impress several of the harshest BBQ critics I knew in Texas. That was a task in itself but it taught me how difficult it is to master the art of BBQ. I am by means no professional pit master but I took the time to learn the different techniques and make something that fit my taste buds and personality. \\n\\nI already did my homework on Pig Floyd's and heard remarkable things and my wife, who is a Texan by birth, wanted some smoky goodness. When we pulled up an hour before closing time on Mother's Day it was PACKED and we just assumed it was because of Mother's Day but after about 20 minutes in line and a very helpful encounter with the gentleman at the register, I had a feast fit for a king on its way to the table in a few. My wife opted for the ribs with some plantains and the corn. I opted for the two meat combo and added two more with coleslaw and rice and beans. The meats I opted for were Chicken, ribs and brisket from both sides of the brisket.  My usual unsweetened iced tea but with lemon since they did not have lime and mama just wanted some water. \\n\\nWhen they arrived with my meal, several of the other patrons were looking over as I took some pictures of that feast and it took up MOST of the table! I will start with the negatives...  My rice was a bit dry on the rice and beans and they did not have lime for my iced tea. I usually have a lot more to nitpick but if that is all I can bitch about, let us move on to the positives... \\n\\nThe cutting boards as pigs made a great presentation! The ribs were nicely smoked and had a perfect smoke ring. The meat was tender and well flavored. I even tried it with BOTH sauces, on the side OF COURSE, and BOTH of them were great. One added a nice sweetness and the other had just the right amount of kick. WELL DONE! The brisket was so tender I was able to cut it with a fork and the fatty end was so moist and tasty while the other end was not quite as moist and just as tasty. Cheers to the pit master for not making one end saltier than the other! That chicken was not as smoky as I personally like to make mine at home but the white and dark meat was moist and yet FULLY cooked. Not drying out the white meat on a pit is an art in itself! \\n\\nThat corn was fantastic and the char was a nice touch. That coleslaw was just amazing and I am not a huge coleslaw fan but this is the second place this weekend that made me rethink my opinion of coleslaw! \\n\\nWhile we were in line waiting we were talking to another couple that came there to dine. After they finished they came by our table to exchange notes on our dining experiences. They felt the pulled pork was a tad dry so I will have to try it for myself the next time and I expressed my feelings about my rice being dry. Well I had no idea the owner was standing near us and overheard the conversation while he was helping his staff keep the guests happy. After they left I requested some to go containers because I still had a mountain of food and went to go wash up. When I returned my wife informed me that the owner overheard me tell the other patrons about the dryness of the rice and brought her a big to go box filled with rice and beans. I opened it and it was not at all dry and that just took me by surprise. \\n\\nI called Thomas over to thank him personally and asked him if he would pose for a picture with me. I am a tall guy but he made even me feel short and that was a refreshing feeling. I informed him at that point that I was one of the Elite squad Yelpers and that I would be posting a full review later that evening. Well unfortunately I had several other reviews to write up from the weekend and called it a night before I could post my review in about three hours as I said I would. I later posted a tip on their Yelp page letting him know I would be posting it today instead. \\n\\nThomas...  You can bet I will be back to work my way through your entire menu and I really appreciated watching you work alongside your staff and that alone says a lot. When you just brought my wife a box of rice and beans after overhearing my comment; that tells me how much you really care about our dining experience in your establishment.

Sitting down in the food hall, I picked up my biscuit sandwich and the biscuit promptly falls apart.

The chicken itself was strange- partly juicy but partly dry too...not what i expected from a place that supposedly specializes in fried chicken. Maybe it was an off day.

It was after we were seated, that the service took a weird turn - literally, NO ONE came by to take our order. With all of the staff who were striding from one end of the restaurant to the other, you would think that ONE of them would slow down to see why we had no food or drink in front of us. Or, with the openly bewildered and questioning look on my face, you would think that someone would swing by to answer the basic question: \\"Are you the person I order my meal from?\\"\\n\\nTruthfully, if a diner has to ask \\"Do I order from you?\\", then the restaurant is dysfunctional in some way.

Such was not the case for my friend and me but that was probably because we rolled in around 3PM on a Monday. It was our last food stop on our Portland trip and we had been told that it was not one to be missed. I had a good feeling about this place from the moment I walked in. It was trendy but didn't seem to try too hard. Its decor still had its own unique character and the layout was a bit different than I'm used to. The front part of the restaurant includes a bar and bar seating. It is separated from the main dining room by the bar wall and makes the dining area completely unnoticeable from the outside.My friend and I sat at the bar and were given their happy hour menus. I took a look at the drinks and found that nothing really stood out to me. I asked the bartender if he could concoct something fruity and somewhat girly but still strong - we weren't driving, after all. He whipped up a blended cocktail that reminded me of the planet Jupiter. It was called the Hurricane and it was exactly what I was looking for. I enjoyed it. I also had a daiquiri which was on the rocks; I've only ever had them blended and mixed with a fruit such as strawberries. This one didn't have any flavor enhancing fruits and reminded me of a margarita on the rocks with vodka instead of tequila. The taste was subtle but the quality was there.\\n\\nFor food we stuck to the happy hour menu and ordered the potatoes bravas that were served with an egg. They were just ok. They could've been creamier and the sauce more flavorful. The potatoes weren't cooked and treated enough to hold their own flavor. They needed a good sauce. I also ordered some bacon wrapped dates as you can order these individually and I just wanted a couple. They were also just ok. Our experience was more mellow that I was expecting. Even our bartender and server were not as upbeat as I had expected. Maybe they needed some background music. I would like to see this place when it's more lively because I don't believe we experienced its full potential. I'll keep it in mind for the next time I'm in Portland."},{"name":"Denny's","address":"351 E Main St","city":"Apopka","stars":"2","text":"This is my second time here.

I ordered ice water and the 2 chicken enchiladas and salad with avocado on top from the Lunch menu. It was the worst Mexican food I have had in my life. The chicken was balls of hard rubbery something that didn't taste like chicken. It tasted slightly of cinnamon. The tortillas were incredibly thick. There was no sour cream as shown in the photo. The green sauce was horrible. The avocado was not as bountiful as in the photo. There were only 2 small pieces of avocado. The dry salad was comprised of lettuce, long strips of red pepper, very very long withered strips of carrot --- impossible to eat with a fork --- and no dressing of any kind. I felt ill eating it. I told the waitress I couldn't eat the salad and asked for a discount because the long strips made it inedible. I told her it was the worst Mexican food I have ever eaten.

Another thing that was frustrating was that my friends fountain drink was empty for most of time and she had to ask for a refill although the server had been by several times. \\n\\nMoving on the server brings us one check, okay maybe we didn't specify we would be separate but she didn't ask either so we ask if it can be separate. We go through each item and who it belongs to with the server. She comes back, the receipts were not itemized correctly but we were ready to go so we told her it was fine. \\n\\nThis place is obviously hit or miss. Sad because I was the one that actually recommended we go there after work since I had such a good first experience.

I ordered the pork carnitas with \\"mexican\\" macaroni and cheese and quesadillas. The pork carnitas basically tasted like pulled pork from any BBQ place in the south. The only thing Mexican about the macaroni and cheese were a few slivers of jalepeno that didn't really add anything to the flavor. As for the quesadillas, I've had far better from the frozen food section at my grocery store.

Kid with burger #2 was fine with the taste and texture (but for the last few bites) but kid with burger #1 couldn't eat it.  This is 100% an ongoing problem, very undercooked red meat. I don't know why they'd serve rare burgers in a kid's meal and honestly it didn't dawn on me to specify \\"don't bring us a rare burger\\" I've never had to do that anywhere else. But ok, no problem we can roll with the punches. \\n\\nWe asked to have it substituted for chicken nuggets, which the server happily did, however it never came out for the entirety of our meal. Our server, bless them, was so busy it seemed like they were under staffed or something, bc they were always attending to other customers. We waited a long time for refills, some of which never came, nor did any manager make the rounds or help their servers in any way. \\n\\nWhen we were able to flag our server down to ask if we could just have the outstanding meal to go bc everyone else was finished with their meal, they were dismayed that nobody brought out the substitute meal and told the manager. The managers solution when he brought the to go box:\\"I'll take it off the bill\\" which would maybe matter more if it wasn't 'Kids eat free day' but maybe he forgot. A free dessert would have been a better token of an apology than a free free item. :-/ \\n\\nOur adult meals were fabulous, we had a fish dish and a shrimp dish.

If I don't like the sauce, I won't like the pizza...cheese and toppings are secondary. \\n\\nWhen we moved to Stoneham I noticed a sign that offered a large cheese pizza for $6.95. $6.95? I'll try anything for $6.95! (Mon-Wed only)\\n\\nMy first bite of that cheese pizza told me I had made a great decision! I have since ordered pizza's with toppings and I have never had a pizza there I didn't love. \\n\\nI do not award four stars lightly, but for a neighborhood pizza place with a modest dining room that offers relatively quick service and a great value...I am a fan!"},{"name":"Ittyo Restaurant","address":"1815 Massachusetts Ave","city":"Cambridge","stars":"3.5","text":"I had high hopes for this place because my sister really likes it and I generally trust her judgement.

It was a bit overkill, and again, a dish that requires more than 2 people to eat. \\n\\nWe got the Muqueca Completa which comes with fish, mussels, clams, and scallops. I think. There was so much fish I had a really difficult time towards the end. I love how hot the seafood is and there is a lot of cilantro on top of the stew. It's a great dish to share and the flavor is very unique. I really wanted to try the Bahian style one (with coconut milk amongst other ingredients), but because I had never had a traditional Muqueca, I figured this was the more rational option.  \\n\\nThe hot sauce is VERY hot.

The Murg Masala (chicken in a tomato curry) was tender and loaded with flavor, but not at all spicy - at least not by my standard. But, my favorite (which I can't remember the name of) was a dish with nice tender chucks of beef in a dark rich flavorful sauce - it was awesome!

People are leaving! ... but we can't promise anything\\" followed by my asking \\"So 10 minutes? 15? 20?\\" which was met with more \\"Oh, sorry really can't say.\\" \\n\\nNow if that wasn't enough of a red flag -- I really wanted hot pot and walked in the rain past three similar not-full establishments to get to Claypot because a friend recommended it. I looked at the wait list and put my name down, there were only two names before myself and one reservation. So a few minutes pass and the group of people first on the list get seated and here's where weird things start to happen. About five different groups of people walk in together shortly after and they all put their names down. Over the next 20 minutes They were all seated, and every single time they did I checked the namelist and asked why they were seated before us (their names being below ours on the list and crossed off before) and we were met with \\"oh, uhh, you guys are next!\\" no fewer than THREE times. Only one group that went before us had a reservation, and they were seated half an hour after their reservation time, which scared me a bit. Fast forward, we left at 8:30 after we saw that several more groups were seated before us despite literally being walk ins and something was definitely up with Claypot. \\n\\nWe had two Caucasian people in our group and maybe that's why we weren't seated despite waiting for 50 minutes?

I love the small feel to the place and the communal tables, although the DC and me sat way form other guests, I think it is a great idea.  \\n\\nNot only did we get to eat great food, but getting to watch the staff prepare the plates was great fun and interesting.  Loved it.  Since the menu changes each week I won't say much about what I had other than I enjoyed it, learned a few things, and each course was stronger than the one before it.  Although, I can't say that for the cheese course.  Loved the cheese it just wasn't better than the zuccini salad with fried squash blossoms.  If you ever see squash blossoms at a farmers market in early summer, buy all you can!  They are great, and they were prepared perfectly the night I was at Beast.  \\n\\nThe lamb was also excellent, I admit to being a barbarina and tackled the bones.  Hey, I'm from out of town what do I care if the others guests or the one water watching me think I'm crazy?  That was damn good lamb!  Also, there are some real secrets in the romesco sauce, much more than basic roasted veggies I think.  I also recommend the wine pairing.  When a top notch chef is pairing the wine with her food, you are crazy not to give it a try.  Besides each course has its own sets of flavors and no one wine is going to carry you through all the way this lovely 6 course meal.  \\n\\nIs beast a splurge?  Yes it was, but know what?  It wasn't that expensive compared to other top notch food I've had around the world.  I spent way more at Daniel Boulud's place in Miami for only 3 courses!  How many of you blow $100 on a night out for drinks and dinner and a movie?   or how much do you spend on coffee each month?  Maybe not something you'll do all the time, but for an occasion, for a treat, beast is well worth it.  Or better yet, pack your lunch instead of eating out each day on junk and instead you'll be able to enjoy the great food at Beast every once and a while instead.  \\n\\nThe staff, Chef-owner, and Sous, were nothing but friendly and informative about the food and the wines. So not sure about other recent reviews complaining about that.

With the exception of the okra, if it's on the menu, I'm eating it.\\n\\nI have my favorite items, but really I love it all.  ALTHOUGH, I'm going to add one incredibly serious caveat... 4R needs to stop jacking around with the burnt ends recipe. 100% serious as a heart attack.  STOP MESSING WITH THE BURNT ENDS!!!!!!\\n\\nI'll get back to that, but the food is amazing.  The smoked flavor is strong and clean.  The meat is juicy and flavorful.  The crowds are here and the line can get a bit long, but the food is worth it.\\n\\nIf it's your first time here, grab a paper menu while you wait.  Know what you want by the time you get to the meat counter.  You order your meal with the first person, but you don't need to tell that person which sides you want.  Move down the line and the next person will ask you about your sides.  Most meals come with either 2 or 3 sides.  Then you get a drink and pay at the register.  They have a 4R club, so you can earn free food if you sign up.\\n\\n*TIP TIME* I'll add this to the tips section, but some people don't really read those so I'll put it here, too.  If you want to make 4R a little more reasonably priced for your family, order off the bulk menu.  A family of 4-6 people will save at least half off their bill by doing this.  You don't get the fancy menu items, but get the best food.  Order the meats by the half or full pound and get a sideboard of either 3 or 5 sides.  My wife & I do this for just the 2 of us and it still saves us $5-7 each visit.\\n\\n*BURNT ENDS RANT*  I love all of the meats, but my favorite is the burnt ends.  4R has classically served theirs in the pulled style.  I've read that in Kansas City burnt ends are usually served cubed, but most of the rest of the country serves them either in thin slabs (think bacon style) or pulled.  Recently, 4R moved from their classic pulled style to cubed.  Honestly, it looked like dog food and the bulk of the taste is gone.  Cube style, in my opinion, makes what is supposed to be the best of the best of the brisket into a chew toy.  They also seem to have altered the seasoning rub they use on this cut.  It went from my favorite to an item I wouldn't order ever again.\\n\\nThis must have caused an uproar because they have changed it AGAIN.  My most recent visit, I asked about it before I ordered.  The guy sheepishly told me that I wasn't the only person that hated the dog food cubes and I wasn't the only one who said it looked like dog food.  He said it was a big deal for a lot of people.  They have gone back to the original seasoning rub, but have gone to a combo meal on the cubing.  It isn't back to purely shredded meat in the pulled style... there are cubes mixed in.  I'm hoping they ditch this and go back to the original.\\n\\nI asked the guy to try and leave as many cubes as he could out of my meal.  He was great and tried, but said he couldn't be super thorough with the line as long as it was.  I understood completely.  He did a pretty good job.\\n\\nUltimately, they are jacking around with the best item on the menu and that stinks."},{"name":"Salvaggio's Italian Deli","address":"2609 Pearl St","city":"Boulder","stars":"3.5","text":"Probably my favorite sandwich spot in Colorado.

Maybe I was just expecting more as far as tasting room size meals, but I guess the portions match the pours for the flight we had.  Both on the smaller side.   Paying $15 for a flight was to me a bit much for the pour sizes.  \\n\\nYou just might want to go here after you already go somewhere else for dinner.\\n\\nWe had the baked garlic with brie and bread for i believe $11, This was tasty but nothing special.  We had the shrimp bruschetta and also a tuna salad and panini. Most items right around $8.

No offense to Grocery Outlet, I love that place.

I think the same thing happened to the guy to the table next to us, because he was choking on the strong vinegar while eating his salad.\\n \\nOur main dishes came out, and I was pleasantly shocked at how large the portions were. My lobster raviolis were large and contained a lot of lobster, but unfortunately it was pretty dry and overcooked lobster.

The arancini and  half order or Lobster ravioli were very good as appetizers. For my personal taste, there was too much cream with the lobster ravioli but I can see why this is a signature dish. No deductions. \\n\\nMy disappointment was with my linguine Vongole. This is a dish I have had at many restaurants locally and internationally including Italy. Unfortunately, Rino's version would score toward the bottom of the pack. The clams were slightly overcooked, it lacked depth (red pepper, pancetta, parsley?) and the over-all saltiness of the dish was overpowering. The home-made linguine was great and had a fantastic al-dente texture for fresh pasta but it was off the charts in terms of salt. Maybe the dish was seasoned twice by mistake or the pasta water was on it's last legs but I can't give Rino's more than three stars due to a dish I am left with the impression that I should have sent back but didn't (I can count on one hand the times I have sent food back in my 40years).\\n\\nAnyway, their are a lot of things I liked about Rino's including the atmosphere and service.

I picked one and commented, he changed some aspects and he came up with the perfect menu. Mark also sent me some wine suggestions to complement the meal. As you can see, this shows that Mark is incredibly flexible and there to please his \\"students\\". Last night we got to ArtEpicure and were wowed by the building, the Brickbottom Artist Association Building, and Mark's home. Mark and his wife have put together an amazingly beautiful and comfortable home. Now onto the food!\\n\\nAhi tuna tartar with sesame crisps - Mark purchased the fish at the New Deal fish market. It was so fresh and delicious. We even made the sesame wonton crisps. Since I love tuna and avocado more than anything, this dish wowed me. I plan on making it soon!\\nSweet potato samosas with date banana yogurt sauce - Very, very tasty. We cooked the dates, made the sauce, made the dough and the filling and then put it all together. The samosas and the sauce were a truly wonderful combination. I mentioned to Mark that I would not make the dish at home because I wouldn't have time to do all of that. He suggested buying Puff Pastry instead of making the dough! I would do this for a dinner party or something of the sort but it was still a process I couldn't squeeze in for a weeknight dinner.\\nSwordfish teriyaki with soba noodle and seaweed salad - the swordfish was TO DIE FOR. I put my fork into it and it fell apart. I have to learn to only buy fish of this quality. The teriyaki sauce was not too sweet like at a restaurant. Of all of the things we made, I think I will made the soba noodle and seaweed salad the most. It took 5 minutes, had few ingredients and would be great to pack as a lunch to school or work.\\nGinger rice pudding with pandan spices- I had never seen pandan spices before and my favorite color is green so I was very happy to have a green dessert. A perfect not-too-heavy dessert to end a wonderful meal.\\n\\nSo as you all can see, I am writing a rave review here. It is absolutely worth the price. Mark hosted us for 5 hours and made sure our experience was memorable. What kind of restaurant provides the kind of personalized service that ArtEpicure does?

There's also a hidden parking lot out back, a little hard to find but key to a timely arrival.\\n \\nI was very impressed with the bar - the wine list was very solid, affordable yet unique.  And the cocktails list - creative, classy, and oh-so intoxicating...  Recommendation: if you want something light and feminine without being overly sweet, try the Elder Blossom; St. Germain, orange blossom water and Prosecco.  Mmmm...The cocktail list also sports a Dark n' Stormy, which earns points.\\n\\nAs for the food, the scallops had great potential, but were disappointingly underdone.  The salmon was disappointing all around: too much panko crust and overdone on what was probably mediocre quality fish.  The filet mignon was also unremarkable, although I blame my friend for ordering it medium well - entirely her fault.\\n\\nOn the flip side, however, the filet mignon sliders were a masterpiece!  Simply amazing - my mouth is watering just thinking of them.  They're definitely a destination dish, something I'd drive out to Wellesley for in a heartbeat.  And the parmesan pea risotto that came with my salmon was incredible!  It's hard to find a good risotto, and this one blew me away.  Once the kitchen figures out the salmon (which I'm sure they will), this could become my second favorite dish on the menu.\\n\\nAfter watching too many episodes of Kitchen Nightmares and listening to stories from friends in the industry, I can only imagine the stress of opening night, and I was very impressed with how well the staff of Bobby's pulled it off.  They're only going to improve as time goes on, and I highly recommend you swing through and see how they're doing.

We also got the guacamole, which was excellent and plentiful. I normally think $6 for a bowl of guacamole is expensive, but based on the size and the quality, it was worth it. \\n\\nI got the carnitas, which looked fantastic when it came out, but was surprisingly bland. I mean, it tasted good, but what I generally love about carnitas is the big flavor, and this dish just didn't have it. It came with a side of poblano mac & cheese which was good but needed either a salty cheese or even just some salt (most common mistake places make in mac & cheese - it should always have one salty cheese in it!). \\n\\nThe little lady had the shrimp quesadilla, and again, it was fine, but the shrimp was clearly not fresh. \\n\\nMargaritas were good but nothing special. \\n\\nI definitely would like to give it another try, but right now at this price point (probably 25% more expensive than the typical mexican joint) it's more of a 2.5 stars.

We ordered our drinks with our appetizers and dinners. The appetizers arrived before the wine. When the wine arrived, I looked at my Merlot to see not one, but seven insects floating in the wine, one was clearly alive. I'm not sure about the rest. My husband took the glass up to the bar since we didn't see our server and the man who had seated us got another glass of Merlot, which he brought to the table. He never apologized, nor did anyone at any time. The bugless Merlot was not that great.\\n\\nFor appetizers, I ordered a Caprese salad and my husband ordered Bruschetta Napolitana. Conveniently, each came with four items, so we shared. I am always a fan of Caprese salad, but this was very boring. The tomatoes were pale and flavorless. I realize that it is June and not tomato season, but they should still be able to do better. The Caprese did have nice thick slices of mozzarella. The Bruschetta Napolitana was interesting and decent, if a bit messy.\\n\\nI had the Scampi Francavillese, which I thought was very bland. My husband had the Tortellini Quattro Formaggi. My taste was good.\\n\\nOur dinner was very disappointing and overpriced for the quality of the food. I had also expected that since there were seven bugs in my wine, they might at least not charge us for the wine, but they did. The total was $70 before tip.\\n\\nBackground: It was a Tuesday night and when we arrived around 7 or 7:30pm, we were the only customers in the restaurant. While we were there a woman came in and sat at the bar for a little while and another woman came in with four children, but they ate and left in a short period of time.

Chef Mark explained that his classes tend to be longer because rather than splitting us into groups to divy up the dishes, we cook everything together so that everyone learns how each dish is prepared and cooked. It also is more personable and Mark can give us more personal attention as a group. So make sure you do eat a little something before you go because dinner won't be served until late.

The most fantastic thing about this restaurant is as soon as you walk up to the fully packed bar, the bartender is right there with a drink menu to hand to you. Every time. I've never experienced more consistent, attentive bartenders before. \\n\\nThe second fantastic thing about this place is the menu. I want everything on it. We usually end up ordering a bunch of the small plates because we want to try everything, and there's still so much left for us to try. From the short rib gnocchi, to the shrimp and grits, to the quack and cheese (this better come back on the menu), it's all delicious. We've never ordered a bad thing here before.\\n\\nAnd the third fantastic thing about this place is we always spend less money than we thought it would be. Don't get me wrong, this is no cheap date, but you certainly eat/drink well for your money here."},{"name":"Cantina La Mexicana","address":"247 Washington St","city":"Somerville","stars":"3.5","text":"Came in here for take out with 3 others while passing through Union Square.

They seem to specialize in more exotic meats like rabbit, duck and veal, but occasionally go with game hen, chicken or beef as the entrees in their Prix Fixe menu.\\n\\nThe dining experience is unique with diners, often in couples, sitting at large tables and sharing some of the food family-style. Other courses, like the Charcuterie Plate were not family-style. This atmosphere allows the diners to make new friends and my wife and I found that refreshing. We even drove one of the couples, in town from Sacramento, back to their hotel after dinner (they had arrived in a cab).\\n\\nThe food is simply amazing. A variety of flavors make your mouth sing and the quality is top notch. Since the menu varies weekly, you will just have to experience the food yourself. My favorite was the Steak Tartare bite on the Charcuterie Plate, which is the only thing that seems to stay on the menu weekly.\\n\\nThe challenge with Beast is they book out sometimes a month in advance, but they post their menus only on Wednesday of each week. If you don't want one of the more exotic meats, you will have to cancel and rebook. It's sort of a lottery feel...and it took us months to finally book a reservation that coincided with a game hen-based menu."},{"name":"Highland Kitchen","address":"150 Highland Ave","city":"Somerville","stars":"4","text":"Brother, Can You Spare a Quarter?  \\nWhile the food was fine - I had a jambalaya that had too much broth - the entire evening was tainted twice by an incident I still have yet to understand.  When I first went in to the restaurant, I asked the hostess if she had change for the parking meters. She told me to go to the bartender. After he begrudgingly told me he'd give me quarters for my dimes, he then told me that 'the parking tonight was on him.' He then told me that 'it came out of his pocket.'  I had no idea what he meant because I watched him take out a roll of quarters from the cash register, crack it open and proceed to provide me quarters for my change.  Since I had no idea why he said that, I just decided to leave things alone. I walked out of the restaurant, fed the meter and came back in to the restaurant for my meal. \\n\\nThe food was good - not nearly as delicious as I had heard it would be - but satisfactory.  Between dinner and dessert, I realized I needed to put more money in the parking meter and so I asked our waiter to provide me change. A few minutes later he came back and told me that he was sorry, but they had no quarters to provide me. I assumed this was not the case and that it really had to do with the bartender. Since I was not interested in fighting with the bartender for 75 cents - yes,  THREE quarters - I just told the waiter to forget it.  \\n\\nA few minutes later, the host/manager came over to us and apologized again and said that he could sell us a roll of quarters. He said something about the restaurant not being able to accept any coins less than a quarter (last time I looked, the US government was still accepting dimes??!!!) and he reconfirmed the bartender's claim that the previous $1.25 came out of his pocket. To be honest, as a customer, I didn't really care about their ridiculous policy (aren't restaurants in business to SERVE the customer???) and I told him so.  I just wanted the conversation to stop. But, instead,  he said he was sorry again and said he was just trying to help.  Then, he accused me of yelling at him. (I was speaking no louder than he was). At that point, my friend was so frustrated that she said she couldn't believe they would make such a big deal out of such a small request.  The host/manager tried to make things up to us (though it was too late) by paying for our appetizer, drink and dessert. Nice effort, but, I would have preferred not to have been in such an uncomfortable dialogue with both him and the bartender. And, I will forever more remember this very odd, offensive policy of this restaurant and will not likely return. Indeed, when I speak of this restaurant with friends, I'm sure the first thing I'll mention will not be the food, but this rigid, esoteric policy.  \\n\\nReally too bad... Oh, and for the purposes of how a manager should act: s/he should never accuse the customer of yelling at him/her (especially when the customer was not doing so) and NEVER argue back with the customer after s/he says she is not yelling.  I wondered what his intention was in coming over to us in the first place: he only made the situation worse."},{"name":"Beat Brasserie","address":"13 Brattle St","city":"Cambridge","stars":"3.5","text":"Beat Brasserie in a nutshell, good ambiance/music, decent  wines on tap, OK drinks, OK food, total chaos from a service standpoint (at least for us). I can't endorse this place for anything beyond drinks and the ambiance. \\n\\nMy wife and I went here for Valentine's Day and it was one of the biggest sh*t shows we've experienced in a while. We called ahead to let the maitre d know that we would be 15 minutes late and he said no problem. We arrive to check in and were told they are running behind and to wait at the  bar. I went to the bar, ordered a cocktail, finished the cocktail and then stood there waiting for the table. We were eventually seated 25 minutes after checking in. It took another 15 minutes for someone to come check in with us and get the wheels rolling. \\n\\nThey had a $55/person prix fixe (rip off) menu for Valentine's Day and you could not order anything a la carte. Fine. I wasn't a huge fan of the menu so I paid an extra $12 to upgrade to prime sirloin steak. We didn't have any complaints about the food itself except that it was fairly underwhelming and not worth $55 or $67 in my case. The biggest issue was the time between plates. It took 20-30 minutes for each course to come out which left us getting hungry between dishes... It even took our pre-assembled desserts 20 minutes to come out after we were done. I had to ask someone what was happening. I saw other tables getting their food much more rapidly, which was confusing. I saw one table in particular that was seated after us, but who left before we even had our desserts.\\n\\nI had three different glasses of wine which were all interesting blends and pretty good. I'm a big fan of the Troublemaker blend.\\n\\nAll told it took us 2 hours to have dinner, which was just unnecessary. Way too slow. The bill with tip was $190. At that price I expect a much different experience and have had many great meals at that price point, so this just doesn't stand up for me.\\n\\nI will probably come back to this place to listen to music and have a drink, but I won't be coming back for food and  wouldn't recommend a sit down dinner to anyone."},{"name":"Sweet Hereafter","address":"3326 SE Belmont St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"I love the food and drinks here, and usually the service is top notch.

Always looking for new spots to try and this one sounded good. The first thing you note upon arriving are the wonderful smells emitting from the open doors. You order at the counter and the specials and parts of the menu are on the wall. \\n\\nIndoor and outdoor seating accommodates more than it seems so we didn't have a wait for a table.  You place your order, take a number and have a seat. They do request you order prior to seating yourself. \\n\\nTeen ordered a pork belly taco and a butter chicken taco.  She found the chicken to be burnt and did not care for it and so swapped out for a shrimp and sausage taco. She enjoyed both the shrimp and the pork belly tacos a lot. \\n\\nI was very hungry so opted for the Big Floyd sandwich. Pork and brisket with sausage on a large bun with 3 French fries on top. The meat was delicious. I asked for their sweet sauce and it has just enough of a tang to make it not so sweet. The bun fell apart quickly but I was just as happy to eat the meat by itself. I had a side of Maduros and must say they weren't my favorite. I love maduros and they are typically sweet on their own but these tasted like they have been cooked with brown sugar or some type of sweetener. They were just too sweet for my tastes as a side.\\n\\nHubby had the pork and brisket platter. Again he said the meat was smoky, tender, and delicious. His Mexican Street corn, which he gave me half, was so-so good. Cooked expertly and the cojito cheese mixture on it was amazing. \\n\\nThis spot was very good and we'll be back for sure to try other items.

The Burmese pork stew was bursting with flavor; it was a bit spicy, sweet, and savory all in one. The chopped egg is no regular hard boiled egg, but rather, one marinated in spices. Finally, the second egg with its runny yolk takes this entree to the next level. This is everything you want in a rice dish. \\n- Erin's sweet biscuits (Oregon berries, whipped cream) - We aren't huge biscuit lovers but these biscuits may have just changed our minds. The buttery and flakey biscuits are topped with light, whipped cream and surrounded by sweet blackberries. Without being overly sweet, this dish will adequately satiate a sugar craving. \\n\\n3.

The bartender remembered our names and was very gracious in helping us decide what to drink. But let me tell you, all the cocktails we tried were amazing! They were strong but smooth.

They cooked the Brussels sprouts to perfection and the Buffalo sauce accompanied with the dip completed the dish.\\n\\nRicotta and Mozzarella Fritters: The fritters were very light, fluffy and not at all heavy despite the cheese stuffing. However, we were not the biggest fans of the chili honey dip and found it too sweet for our taste.\\n\\nSpicy coconut curry goat stew: Read many reviews about how amazing this was and it looked that amazing too but the taste did not live up to the hype. The stew was a little dry and mixing rice with it was not a good idea either. The goat was cooked well and that unfortunately was the best part of the dish.\\n\\nAll in all, the place was very reasonably charged and the food was decent too but I would not return here to eat!

Suffice it to say - Chuy's fulfills a desperate need in the Orlando market. It is a well-run & well-funded Mexican restaurant that serves great (if not excellent) food. \\n\\nThis is not snooty high brow cuisine. This is also not some little hole in the wall bodega where you worry if there is a little extra protein mixed in with the rest of your food. This is a place for cheese topped goodness, creamy jalapeno sauce, and freshly made tortillas and sopapillas. \\n\\nMy girlfriend and I visited on a Thursday night right before the end of Happy Hour - thus, we were able to briefly take advantage of their free Nacho Bar (This is an incredible idea!). Nachos in hand, we had about a 20 minute wait before being seated. This was actually quite efficient as the place was packed. Upon being seated, we were greeted by our server and her trainee and quickly set up with drinks and an appetizer. As far as an appetizer goes, the Queso Compuesto is amazing - if incredibly rich and way more than we actually needed. It consists of their regular chili con queso with ground sirloin, pico de gallo, and a generous dollop of guacamole mixed in. Fantastic. \\n\\nWe decided on the Chuy's Special and the Chalupa/Enchilada combo. To be honest, neither of us got through all of our meals and we easily had enough for two more meals when we left. Everything was great but special props go out to the Green Chile Rice. You have the option of getting it or regular rice - do yourself a favor: go for the heat of the green chiles. It has a wonderful flavor. \\n\\nI finished up the meal with an order of Sopapillas which I have been craving for quite a long time. Freshly made and lightly sprinkled with sugar powder, they come in a pair with a side of honey. The trick is to tear off a corner and pour honey down into the pocket. Delicious. Though my girlfriend thought they tasted like chicken mcnuggets dipped in honey. So I guess they are not for everyone.\\n\\nTwo things keep this from being a 5 star review:\\n1. They have positioned themselves right in the middle of Orlando's Vacation Club mecca. This is great for them as they fulfill a need and they will almost always be busy. Bad in that traffic in the area is a pain in the butt. \\n2. Their chips, though freshly made, are a bit too thin to support the dips they use. Their dips are GREAT. But they need a thicker chip that does not snap easily under any kind of pressure. \\n\\nOverall: I will be back many times over, especially for the Happy Hour from 4-7 on weekdays. I had the pleasure of dining at Chuy's in Austin and i could tell that the quality/taste had made its way to Orlando.

Enjoyable, from the clean and elegant ambiance of the restaurant, the hearty pour of Barbera wine I had, the friendly and shockingly-forthright server, and finally, the delicious meal of handmade gnocchi with porcini and roasted corn.\\n\\nAccanto certainly surpassed my night's expectations.

Some of the flavors didn't work as well as the others, but there are some flavors I would come back for. There was a line when we arrived (around 7:30pm on a Saturday night), but it moved quickly and we were able to order after about 10-15 minutes. We decided to go with the Flight of 4 Scoops of Ice Cream ($9, http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/salt-and-straw-portland?select=4LSjADeI_JGzdT8s1toXmA#4LSjADeI_JGzdT8s1toXmA) and got:\\n\\n-Almond Brittle w/Salted Ganache: Yum! My favorite flavor out of everything we tried. The almond brittle was delicious on its own, and the salted ganache added that nice salty touch. Highly recommended!\\n-Sahagun's Oregon Kiss (Ribbons of Hazelnut Chocolate Gianduja in a Chocolate Ice Cream): Also very good, but this is coming from a sucker for gianduja. \\n-Sea Salt w/Caramel Ribbon: Just ok- I thought this flavor was overhyped. I think I was expecting it to be like Bi-Rite's Salted Caramel, and this was more like vanilla ice cream with sea salt and caramel.\\n-Stumptown Coffee & Bourbon: My least favorite. I thought the coffee/bourbon combination was too bitter, and it needed a little more sweetness to it. \\n\\nWe also split our samples 3 ways, and tried:\\n-Alma's Black Pepper & Chevre Ganache: Surprisingly good! I couldn't taste the black pepper much in the sample, but my friends said they got a hint of it. The chevre was very mild, but added a nice tangyness to the flavor.\\n-Love Potion Sorbet (Sorbet of Spiced Beet and Blood Orange, Splashed w/a Spiked Soda [Secret Blend of Spices/Herbs like Ginger, Chile, Cardamom (known for their aphrodisiac qualities)]): Yuck. I'm not a fan of cardamom, so it ruined this flavor for me. However, it was very refreshing, and I loved the blood orange flavor.\\n-Honey Balsamic Strawberry w/Cracked Pepper: Also yuck. Although I've never liked balsamic in dessert, it was way too strong here and overpowered the other flavors. Skip!\\n\\nWe were also able to try their waffle cone, since they had samples out. Although the smell was heavenly, and the waffle was good, it wasn't amazing. Overall, I enjoyed my trip to Salt & Straw, and loved the \\"flight\\" of ice cream concept since I love trying a variety of flavors instead of getting stuck with a huge scoop of just one flavor. My only gripe here is that there isn't much place to sit- only one table that seats 6-8 and a counter that seats 5, although this is probably their intention to get people in and out. It would've also been nice if there were a heat lamp or two placed outside so that people don't freeze to death during the cold nights while waiting for their ice cream (sounds kind of ironic, but it would be nice to have!). Parking here can be tough later on in the night since there are a couple bars in this area, but it was ok during dinner hours.

Newk's Eatery features sandwiches, soups, salads, and pizzas. On my first visit, I selected Newk's Favorite Salad. I don't know who Newk is, but I like his taste in salad! Grilled chicken, gorgonzola cheese, artichokes, pecans, and cranberries atop fresh mixed greens - what a perfect combination. It had a $9 price tag, but was worth it due to the portion and quality. My only (somewhat silly and minor) complaint is the bowl's uneven shape caused me to almost tip it over twice. I'll take a functional bowl over a trendy one anyday if it means saving my salad.  On my second visit, I splurged and got a half sandwich (turkey avocado) and half salad (caesar). The sandwich bread was nicely toasted up and I had no complaints about either the sandwich or salad.\\n\\nI found that Newk's has a lot of nice conveniences. If dining in, you take a number and they bring the food to your table as well as pick it up later. They have a grab-and-go section if you don't have time to wait in line. Complimentary pickles, garlic, and thin breadsticks can be found on a table in the middle of the restaurant - score! They even have a small sink outside the bathrooms to encourage hand washing. Another positive includes friendly and helpful staff. My sandwich/salad combo took a little longer than normal (I didn't notice because I was engaged in conversation with a friend!), so a manager came over to make sure I got my food. When I asked questions about ingredients in one of their menu items, even though they didn't know the answer right away, one staff went out of their way to find out the answer for me.

It was at the birthday girl's request that we venture to that part of town for their Monday night special.  Fried Chicken and Tiki drinks.  What an odd combination you may be thinking.  Erroneous I say.  Erroneous on both accounts. \\n\\nJenny and I got there around 630 and saddled up at the bar.  The bartender was super friendly and greeted us with a smile.  Jenny got The Airmail (white rum, honey syrup, lime juice and sparkling wine) and I got a PBR tall boy because that's how I do.  We sat and joked and talked shit with those around us, while waiting for the birthday girl to arrive.  We had another round and got hungry and decided to split the Short Rib topped scallion pancake.  The rich savory short rib paired well with the crispy scallion pancake.  There were some homemade pickles to bring in some much needed acidity to the dish.  At this point with a few cocktails and a lil snackey in our bellies we were feeling the flow.  Queue the jukebox.   Soul, reggae, rock, it was all there and let's be honest.  We rocked the shit out of that place.  It was about this time, when the birthday girl and others started to appear.    \\n\\nSo as more friends started to appear, we inquired about being seated.  Unfortunately, we could not start our meal without having a complete party.  I'm not a fan of this limitation as I had a solid buzz and was pretty hungry, not to mention I wasn't trying to make a super late night.  The Host assured us that as soon as we were a complete party he would seat us.   Again we drank (this is when I got the tiki drink- the potted parrot- it was pretty good despite looking like ECTO COOLER)   and waited, waited and waited for that cursed last person to show up.  Fast forward another 30 minutes.\\n\\nOk, I'll be the first person to admit I was getting a little cranky.  But then the food started to roll out, first came the Devils on horseback and let me tell you these things were unreal- salty, savory, cheesy, and bacony: just an overall party in your mouth.  Next came the Confit Buffalo wings.  Those were good but in my mind, when I hear confit.  It think rich flavor, fatty goodness.  These little guys tasted of nothing but buffalo sauce.  I mean, there were alright, would I get them again. Eh, probably not.  \\n\\nAccording to Richard C of the bostonburgerblog.com, the highland has one of the better burgers in Boston.  And let me tell you, Richard is a picky mofo.  I didn't think there was a burger  that he couldn't find 3-5 things that he didn't like about it.  So when he gave the highland burger two thumbs up, I knew, that I had to try it.  So Jenny and I split a burger and the Fried Chicken plate. The chicken came with collard greens, melt in your mouth mash potatoes and the best freckin biscuit I've ever had.  We got a salad instead of fries to accompany the burger.  And so it went down.  The burger was amazing, with cheddar and bacon and cooked to a perfect medium rare, the juices flowing out of this little sucker were the stuff dreams are made of.  The chicken, crispy, full of flavor was nothing short of heavenly.  I was approaching food coma status at this point in time and started to get really... really.... Tired.\\n\\nWhile I watched as my friends ate dessert, we sang happy birthday .  At this point my vision was a blur and all I saw was plates being cleared in front of me.

First of all, I don't tolerate the alcohol very well. It's not that I can't handle my liquor so to speak, but it can make me feel just rotten. Like, I need to go to bed now kind of rotten. Reds haven't always been friendly to me but lately, I'm being guided by people who know wine and steer me in the direction of organic and no added sulfites.

I had such high expectations that obviously could not have been met.\\n\\nOn the plus side:  We had two appetizers that could not have been better.  Stuffed mushrooms were savory, and although not the largest, certainly the most tasty. (Better than the Colosseum in Salem, NH.) The paper-thin braciole was wonderfully salty and balanced perfectly with a tart lemony vinagrette on a bed of greens. \\n\\nAs advertised: Rino's Special.  Two small chicken tenderloins, one veal scaloppini, and one solitary shrimp (come on, just one?!) sauteed with earthy mushrooms over linguini. The chicken and veal were fork-tender and melted in the mouth.  Impressive. A touch of brandy cream sauce was surprisingly not too heavy. The dish could benefit from a sprinkle of salt, but other than that, really no complaints. Nice.\\n\\nWorse than expected: The rib-eye pizzaiola was bland. The steak was a bit overcooked and lacked that fatty mouth-feel. The red sauce was disappointing.\\n\\nAll in all, Rino's offers a satisfying meal but it's not worth the price. Definitely not worth the LONG wait for one of the (10-12?) small, cramped tables.  Buyer beware: there is NOwhere to pahk the cah and NO indoor waiting area whatsoever!

It ended up being a bit dense at the end, but I would still order it again!  As for the pork chop - it was flavored really well and the meat was cook to just tender.

I called and spoke to the manager who saw the error when she pulled up my order. She apologized and asked if I wanted a full refund or just the $10 overcharge. I asked for just the $10 back. After waiting for the credit for two weeks I filed a dispute with my credit card company. This was an easy fix for Domino's and I am not sure why I had to resort to a formal credit card dispute.

The crustiness of the buns was the 2 days sitting exposed on the counter type. The burger itself lacked flavor and when it's both cold and flavorless you can't help but compare it to other burger places we've already tried and love.  Quite frankly, if the employee had greeted us the way I\\"m sure she was trained to, I could have gotten over the cold burger.

There was nothing that we had that was God-awful (though the steak tartar was so BLAND that we wondered if they had forgotten to season it).  The portion sizes were pretty even - our lamb dish for $11 had three bites of lamb that were tasty but when two of us ordered that to share I wish they had told us there was an uneven number to share.  There were two scallops that were well cooked with a nice set but very \\"safe.\\"  I'd prefer safe that is cooked well than going for a home run and missing. \\n\\nThe fig/blue cheese \\"bruschetta\\" was very good and a warm start to our meal...except it came after the tartar which was a theme of things just coming out at random.  \\n\\nIn fact, we had ordered a side of brussel sprouts that came out LAST 10 minutes after we had finished our scallop and lamb...and I don't think were coming at all until we asked the waiter (who seemed overworked and surprised by the busy restaurant)  if they were.  When he went back and checked he said they should be out any minute at which point we told him we didn't really need brussel sprouts for dessert since it had been awhile since our final courses were finished.  We had also ordered cauliflower that never came out either and asked him to cancel that as well.  \\\\\\n\\nWell for some odd reason, the brussel sprouts still came out (and were still on our bill) almost 20-25 minutes after our main courses had arrived...but not the cauliflower (which wasn't on the bill).  While the brussel sprout leaves (not brussel sprouts) were pretty good, my wife and I mentioned on the way home that both of our mouths tasted bitter - not a great dish to have as your last taste in your mouth.  \\n\\nWith all the mix-ups and uneasy service we decided to skip dessert....which is good because nobody even offered it to us and we had to wait around for the waiter to come by so we could get a check.  The manager had actually come over to introduce himself to the table next to us as they were finishing their meal... but we didn't get any visits or even an apology for the mixed up service. \\n\\nAnd not that its a huge huge deal but despite noting it on our reservation, not one person wished us a happy anniversary.  The venue has a cool vibe to it but was also very loud...which would be fun for a social night with friends but a bad choice for our anniversary to be sure.\\n\\nI got one cocktail and for two of us our meal came out to $93.00 with an 18% tip.  For that price we could've had a much better meal throughout Atlanta.\\n\\nSo maybe two stars is a little harsh but there was nothing that makes me want to give them more.

You are close to other diners, which is friendly though not romantic.  I have not had to wait for tables during the week but clearly others have had a different experience, and I wonder what that will be like in the winter because there is no place to stand without feeling in the way, unless it's outside on the street under the awning.  That may be where takeout becomes a better option. \\n\\nThe service is fine, efficient if the place is not absolutely packed, a little slow if it's busy.  I recommend you take your time and linger a bit as you would in the Middle East, or just tell the server up front if you expect to be in a hurry to make a movie or what have you.  Also do not hesitate to ask questions about how the food is prepared, if it's hot or cold, and so on, they are probably used to that as their dishes have traditional perhaps unfamiliar Turkish names, and they don't mind explaining.  \\n\\nAlso feel free to ask for the sauces on the side if you have any hesitation.  They are full of flavors that may be unexpected, so on the side you can control them based on your palate.  Often there is a heavy hand with the garlic in Middle Eastern restaurants, and I am happy to report they do use garlic here, but with respectful restraint.  \\n\\nI highly recommend the choban salad (lettuce-free, lemony, spicy, refreshing) and cacuk (pronounced jajuk), a cold yogurt soup (amusingly served in the kind of stoneware crock you would expect for the hottest French onion soup).   They have Ayran, a salty watered yogurt drink, which is a rare treat.  The yogurt used in all the soups and sauces is delicious, tart and not floury.\\n\\nSome people have remarked that a lot of the tapas are actually dips, and they don't serve bread with them, so use the bread on the table (which comes with a delicious red pepper dip gratis anyway).  Don't be shy to ask for more bread because you WILL run out due to all the dips and sauces you must scoop and soak up.   \\n\\nThe appetizer boereg with cheese (Peynirli) is a very big portion of two triangular flaky pastry turnovers, and would make an entr√©e with a vegetable or salad on the side.  If you're a vegan, they have a lentil kofte dish, but I would check to make sure there's no dairy like butter in it before ordering.\\n\\nTurkish cuisine makes use of a lot of lamb and eggplant.  Pureed eggplant is the base of the Sultan's delight, my favorite dish in the restaurant.  It is a large deep plate with chunks of lamb, and I could not stop eating it, even after I was full.  The pureed eggplant in the eggplant salad is also delicious.  The lamb chops have a lovely flavor, the meat is more well done than in most American restaurants (I prefer it well done personally) but thankfully not burnt or blackened.  The Bayti Kebab special was dense and spicy, which is traditional, as a result I could only eat half.  Be prepared if you are accustomed to lighter more delicate ground beef kebabs.  It has a flavorful sauce and a charming, appetizing presentation. \\n\\nOverall, this is great traditional Turkish cooking, highly recommended if you like Middle Eastern cuisines and want to try a new variation."},{"name":"Mr Everything Cafe","address":"899 Martin Luther King Jr Dr","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3.5","text":"Decided to let my coworkers know that sometimes they gotta try somethin a little different for lunch.

I've been to SanSai about 20 times and almost always order the spicy chicken plate.  It's usually very good, and the salads and grilled vegetables on a skewer that come with it are also usually very good.  Based on the food alone, and the phenomenally low price, SanSai would get a 4 to 5 star rating.  But there's one more aspect of a restaurant: service.\\n\\nOver the years I've found one server who's good, and all the rest range from average down to pretty bad.  Today I got the low end server and although the food was fine, she left a real bad taste in my mouth.\\n\\nHer whole demeanor suggested she'd rather have been somewhere else.  Granted it was 9 pm and they close at 10, but she didn't have to be so unfriendly.  She never looked me in the eyes and took my order as if she was doing me a favor.  I asked to have the dressing on the sides with the salads and they didn't come that way.  She did note that, but I always wonder, if you know it's not what the way the customer ordered, then why bring it to the table?  It then took her a while to bring the dressings, perhaps another five minutes.  The restaurant was virtually empty, but someone had come to the counter and she, the server, chose to deal with that instead of me.\\n\\nOne salad didn't even come with the toppings (sesame seeds and almonds) that it was supposed to.  Again, the server brought it out that way, indicating she never bothered to check to see if the order was right.  She also went by the table a number of times and even placed some new soy sauce on the table, but never asked \\"how is the food\\"?  When I pointed eventually out that the salad didn't have the toppings on it, she did offer to bring a different salad, but by that time I was mostly done with the meal and eager to leave.\\n\\nAll in all, it's an okay place, but watch the service.

And even then, my sister and I played food/drink swap because we ordered kind of similar things but only seemed to get each other's  food/drink and had to keep rotating our stuff.  No biggie.\\n\\nMy sister RAVED about the organic margarita, only to get one that tasted like 100% lime, but they did fix that eagerly, so that is a bonus. Mine was ehh, but I drank it.  I do not like sending back drinks to get fixed for fear an extra special ingredient may be added into it....you know what I am spraying....not that I am saying that would happen here, but I just don't trust anyone.\\n\\nWe each had one vegetarian taco, and for $2  I got three average bites of rice, beans, avocado, salsa, and...radish?  THREE BITES.   And in case you didn't know, Hobbits are taller than me, so I have a puny bite.  I was  still hungry, but I just did not feel like waiting another 30 minutes for another taco.  I went home and made more food.  \\n\\nDid I mention there were about 4 tables of people (out of 10-15 tables outside- no one inside) while we were there?\\n\\nOverall I would come here to enjoy the sweet patio and drinks (next time done by a friend) , but if I was dying from hunger I would not run here to get food, the 30 minute wait on a quiet afternoon for one veg taco was a little rough.   I have not tried the chips, but from what I have read on Yelp I am not sure I want to, but I might?  I am always a glutton for punishment!"},{"name":"Tasty n Sons","address":"3808 N Williams Ave, Ste C, Hub Building","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"Great happy hour!  $2 cans of German beer.

When I first got there, I saw the valet stand but was unaware that it wasn't optional, so I preceded to park. In the parking lot, the valet showed up and told me it was $10 to park or I could park on the street. The lot was fairly empty so I dropped my date off and found free parking a block away. When I walked in the place, it looked nice. We sat outside at the bar. It was nobody else there but the staff but it took a minute for us to be served and the bar needed to be wiped down. We ordered two bottomless mimosa. My date had the omelet with shrimp and crab, and grits. I had the chicken and waffles. After waiting a while for our drinks, we were feeling extra warm, only to notice the heat lamps were on in the middle of the summer. The staff quickly made the adjustments. When the drinks came, they were good. The bottomless mimosa comes in a pitcher. I'm not a major \\"drinker\\" but the 1 was enough for me. My date drank about half of hers. When the food arrived I thought my chicken was a little brown but I enjoyed my meal. Her omelet was reported as decent but she felt the grits were reheated and not fresh. The staff was polite and after the rough start checked on us constantly. On Sundays, Bottle Bar has a day party. We were just leaving as ppl started to come. I enjoyed brunch at Bottle Bar. I was considering getting a hookah but it was $35. I spent about $60 total on the drinks and food.

Maybe this shouldn't impress me so much, but it does. An informed staff - awesome!! I love that they let you, encourage you, even, to try all of the flavors. Makes for a fun experience, and I've been completely surprised by liking some out-there flavor that I never would have chanced, had I not taken a taste first. On my most recent trip, my favorite was the Blood Orange Chocolate Sorbet. Soooo good! And I'm always a fan of their brownie chocolate offering, and the caramel sea salt deliciousness."},{"name":"Pig Floyd's Urban Barbakoa","address":"1326 N Mills Ave","city":"Orlando","stars":"4.5","text":"We went in here today as we were craving BBQ and yeah it do justice to our cravings.The 1/2 slab of ribs were tender and the corn on the cob was very juicy.The other side apple fennel slaw was sooo addictive.The briskets didn't live up to our liking and the whole family didn't bother to finish that plate.The tacos we ordered were to die for and especially loved the shrimp tacos.They also customize everything if you have a family member with nut and sesame seed allergies.We loved this place would be back soon for the tacos and also to try out the other items on the menu.There was enough of seating outside and inside the restaurant as we arrived way early."},{"name":"Jim Dandy Drive-In","address":"9626 NE Sandy Blvd","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"Old, classic diner with lots to look at, including a TV playing the news.

I went through the drive thru tonight to get a chicken sandwich from the gifts earned through the app. (If you know how this app works then you know the more you order through the app the closer you get to a gift and how many gifts you can get). The chicken sandwich smelled really weird and not very hot and after getting home and looking at it in the kitchen light it seemed like it had some old caked up grease on it. This seems to be becoming a habit with restaurants in the area. And for a company such as Chick-fil-A I'm appalled. Closing in thirty minutes so they cook enough sandwiches for the rest of the evening and they can start cleaning the fryer. I've said it before on another review but I also work in the service industry and have worked for many top restaurant groups in Atlanta. People want to go home but the job is not over until it's time to lock the doors.

When I arrived the place was busy and noisy(which isn't necessarily a bad thing.)  Having not really paid attention to what BWW was really about, other than the whole buffalo wing thing, I didn't really know what to expect. \\nIt's pretty much a wing joint/sports bar, which is fine by me. Lots of beer, but how do Pabst, Bud, Miller, etc fall under the Premium beer category? I can't really tell you how the mixed drinks are, I didn't have one.\\nWhat we did have was a BBQ chicken sandwich and the boneless wings with the caribean jerk sauce. My brother ordered the sandwich \\"low carb\\" or wrapped in lettuce. We were informed by our kind and attentive waitress, Lindsay, that all their lettuce comes to them pre-cut.  That was a disappointment. Another disappointment was the fries, which were lukewarm and limp. McDonald's fries are better. \\nOnce our food arrived I was saddened to find that the boneless wings were nothing more than little bready nuggets of chicken. I've had better quality chicken nuggets at a fast food restaurant. Another disappointment was the quality of the blue cheese dressing used. In going through 4 little cups of them I don't think I came across one chunk of blue cheese. The caribean jerk sauce the little bready hunks were tossed in though was pretty good, with the promised heat, a bit hotter than medium on their scale. I did ask to sample the sauces and they were cheerfully supplied and labeled accordingly. \\nOverall, a meh eating experience, but the service was good and quick for how busy they were. I might go back to try the bone-in wings but at this point I don't know."},{"name":"Muqueca Restaurant","address":"1008 Cambridge St","city":"Cambridge","stars":"4","text":"Muqueca is famous for their stews served in clay pots.

It's a seafood stew with an abundance of fish, mussels, and shrimp boiled in a savory broth.

I had a raspberry and rosemary concoction that was so unique, well balanced, and delicious. I would definitely recommend their cocktail list. My husband's Long Island was more of a rum and coke, so I would stick to their menu.\\n\\n3. Cheese board: This is how a cheese board should be done! Generous helping of cheese and a medium-sized baguette. Easily shared between two people and probably could stretch it to four people. Delicious! Five stars! I love cheese!\\n\\n4. Food: My husband loved his risotto even though it had mushrooms. It was well cooked and appropriately creamy. My lamb chops were phenomenal. The tzatziki and the other sauce with the pine nuts and arugula, yum! This was truly a well thought out plate with layers of deliciousness.\\n\\nThe only down score here was that one of my three chops was under cooked, like still seeing a little pink before you cut into it. Unfortunately, it was the last one I cut into so not much to be done but the waitress did apologize and say she would let the chefs know. \\n\\n5. Price: Pretty spot on for Portland. We walked out of there with a $74 tab - 2 entrees, 2 drinks, and a cheese board (did I mention I loved the cheese?).\\n\\n6. Time: We were in and out of there, not rushing, in 45 minutes. This was great! I wonder if it comes from being across from the Schnitzer and people rushing to get to their show. So, if you are looking for a meal that will not drag on, this would be a great place! \\n\\nOther notes:\\n\\nBack seating section was darker/more intimate, we were seated in the front next to the windows and it had a more exposed feel, I would ask for a back room table next time. Moderate noise level, not horrible, but not quiet. Portions are appropriately sized her, nothing too big, but enough to make you feel like you are getting your money's worth."},{"name":"Dickey's Barbecue Pit","address":"8641 Columbus Pike, Ste 1240","city":"Lewis Center","stars":"3.5","text":"I had heard of this chain when I was in Greenville, SC and was excited to see a flyer advertising a location in Lewis Center.\\n\\nAs soon as I opened the door I was greeted by a wonderful smoky BBQ smell, wow!!\\n\\nWe ordered sandwiches and made it a plate by adding 2 sides for $3\\n\\nYou get to choose the meat on your sandwich and they will add pickles and onion too.\\n\\n1.

I know this isn't a go-round, but I should have paid closer attention to some of the reviews on here, and also the weird happy hour that never ends, and realized I wasn't going to be getting anything decent or above average. Hey, I tried! Partner and I stopped in for lunch, and were both less than pleased. I got the 3 hand roll special, with miso soup and choice of salad; $9. Ironically, the salad was the best thing I had there. I got the sumi salad, and the dressing and crunchy cabbage made for a tasty treat. Downhill from there. I got two spicy tuna rolls and a tempura roll. Spicy tuna was that unidentifiable fish mush. Not bad taste, but I'm 99% sure it's not a good cut or fresh. I ended up leaving 1/2 of the 2nd roll. Tempura roll had a small piece of shrimp tempura, a BUNCH of krab meat, and a ton of mayo. Way too much mayo. I only ate half. Partner's donburi bowl was rather boring for a spicy tuna bowl. Fish was meh, and he left half too. We're big eaters, so we came home and ate leftovers to fill the gap.

This is your traditional hang over greasy spoon diner. I rate the food around 5.5 out of 10, however, there's a kitsch which is the appeal. They don't have anything gluten free, however, they're more than willing to of course omit the bun from your burger. To soften the blow of the artery grease assault I ordered salad (even though my points allowed for fries). I taste quality but more grease than anything else. There's a charm which is why I want to come back. It is a somewhat Native Indian theme. I was thrown off that the owner wasn't Native. The souvenirs are cool.

I'd heard good things. I'd never tried Brazilian food but loved seafood and paella, so it seemed appetizing. But from where I lived in Mission Hill, it was quite a trek to Inman Square. I kept thinking about it, but it never quite worked out. \\n\\nThis past May I moved to Inman Square. Suddenly Muqueca was down the street. But I couldn't quite justify going to a restaurant above my usual price range for anything less than a special occasion-- not just on a whim.\\n\\nThen my parents came to visit. Perfect. I would show them the neighborhood and we would head to Muqueca for a nice dinner out. \\n\\nNow, you would think a place couldn't live up to the hype of over a year's worth of anticipation. But Muqueca did. \\n\\nTrue, the wait was long and service was slow. But we should have expected that showing up at 8 pm to a popular restaurant without reservations. And I don't mind slow service so long as the wait is worth it. \\n\\nI ordered the Mariscada-- I couldn't resist the chance to have crab, calamari, mussels, shrimp, and fish all in one. My mom ordered the Fish Muqueca, and my dad ordered the Shrimp and Fish Muqueca. Every bite was an eye-opener: we couldn't believe how much flavor was concentrated in every spoonful. My chunks of crabmeat, especially, were fresh and succulent. \\n\\nWe tried the fish gravy over our rice and enjoyed it. It reminded us a little of chutney, both hot and sweet. But we were astounded by how good our rice was even by itself, or with a little broth spooned over it. We're whole-grain aficionados and not typically fans of white rice, but we found ourselves enjoying it in a way we never have before. \\n\\nMy mariscada came with a side dish of plantains. I'm used to fried plantains that come with Caribbean food and was surprised to find that these plantains were different, arriving sauteed in a sweet tomato-based sauce rather than fried until almost caramelized. I still enjoyed the plaintains but it wasn't quite what I was expecting. Next time I might try the fried yucca instead. \\n\\nWe also enjoyed the juice bar. Ordering juice also ameliorated the wait for our entrees. My parents split an orange-mango-papaya drink and I had the blueberry-mango-passionfruit. Mine was good, but a little tart for my tastes, and I wished I had ordered the wonderfully sweet orange-mango-papaya juice. Which is one reason I'll have to come back. \\n\\nEven though our food took a long time to appear, service was very courteous and attentive. We never wanted for water and several different servers-- and I believe even the owner/manager-- checked in on us multiple times during our meal. \\n\\nThe food was beyond delicious and left us too full to contemplate dessert, as delicious as the desserts must be."},{"name":"Zaftigs Delicatessen","address":"1298 Worcester St","city":"Natick","stars":"3.5","text":"I was recently watching a food countdown show.

It would have been at least average, but I was quite put off when I pulled a long, curly hair from the cheesy goo.\\n\\nThroughout the entire meal, I was witness to a bathroom battle. One man was occupying the single toilet bathroom for about 20 minutes, while another man who obviously and desperately NEEDED to use that bathroom was milling around my table, waiting for his chance. I could see that he was very annoyed (rightfully so) and was muttering to himself. His wife actually stopped by to wait with him. She seemed very upset.\\n\\nMeanwhile, I'm sitting there, trying to eat my food and ignore all this drama. It made me uncomfortable to see the anguish on this man's face. I even heard his wife suggest using the nearby bathroom at Christmas Tree Shop. The man did not think he could make the walk. The man in the bathroom eventually came out, talking on his cell phone. The two men exchanged some angry words and a brief scuffle, broken up by the wife.

Both places are an all you can eat Japanese/ sushi place. The difference between them is the one in Brighton is buffet style where you go up to get your food as often as you like and whatever portion you prefer. This place, the food is made to order. I actually like the one in Brighton better and I will tell you why. Although only $5 more per person, they actually have more food selection. This place here charges extra for certain things like oysters and certain desserts in addition to the flat rate they charge. Certain food you order by pieces but others are whatever portion they serve and you need to finish that because they will charge you extra for wasting food. Or they want you to finish up as much as possible before you place additional orders. Felt as if we were being constantly watched to make sure we finished our food! The other place is not like this because you get whatever portion of anything you want. Because of that, you're able to try almost everything. Totally not like that here. You get full first since you have to finish whatever you initially ordered. This place is definitely good for a big group so that everyone can help each other finish the food in order to try multiple dishes. They do serve drinks unlike the other place. However, although cheap mixed drinks (about $5/10), hardly any alcohol in them; tasted like juice! Probably why they're so cheap! We had the scorpion bowl, Mai tai, and lychee martini. Moving forward, I would choose the one in Brighton over this place! Nevertheless, ambiance was nice and our waiter was nice, friendly, and funny.

Along the two farmhouse tables were a few companies of couples, with a battalion of five, and joint task force of three. Warm casual elegance as we watched our first course being prepared to attack our taste buds. A cold peach and tomato soup volleyed its way towards us, with a luscious crab salad garnished atop. The soup itself sang of summer days, and with the crab, the first course caught our breath with gasps. The cremant paired along effervescently. The down-to-business yet cordial waitstaff served the second course, charcuterie plate, with descriptions of each morsel. Designed so deceptively simple, each bite was better than the first. Steak tartare with quail egg was shamelessly decadent, while the foie gras bonbon topped with sauternes gelee made me shudder with joy. If the charcuterie niblets weren't enough, a verdant salad danced on our palate. Beast waylaid us with the third attack with its glazed pork belly. None of the guests I saw returned a plate that hadn't been licked clean. If the soup and salad sang of summer, the entr√©e roared! The wine paired with the pork belly was full bodied yet not too heavy to allow every nuance of the plate to shine, even the bachelor button blossoms. Salad of chicory with mint and a delicious anchovy lemon vinaigrette lightened our stupor. And then the cheese plate, three lovely bits of heaven accompanied with a fragrant local honey, candied hazelnuts, and the most divine apricot I've ever eaten. The white burgundy selection was summery and sumptuous. Finally Beast conquered us all with a luscious raspberry trifle and ethereal candied ginger tuile. \\n\\nObviously, Beast is a serious contender in the world of gastronomy. I loved being able to watch each course prepared and designed with precision and artful attention. The one battle Beast must address is the comfort of its guests:  chairs are dreadfully uncomfortable after a while. When one's tuckus annoys more than the gracious ambience allures, there's a problem.\\n\\nOne last mention of the staff. When we arrived at Beast, we noticed that a couple parked in front and entered a pub across the street. They left their dog in the vehicle on a summer evening with the windows cracked, yet the sun was glaring into the windows. I was concerned about the dog's welfare, mentioned it to Beast. The waitstaff was not only attentive to us as their guests, but also acutely attentive to the dog, and walked over to the pub to alert their staff about the potential threat to life. Several times between courses, our hosts checked on the dog. Good news, the dog's owners rescued him after an hour without tragedy. \\n\\nI cannot laud enough good about the Beast brigade.

Their Black Metal stout is big, bad and delicious. Their sour beers are world-class and I mean that in every sense of the word. I'd put them up against Belgian sours and New Belgium which had previously been my go-to for American sours. They even go beyond that by doing some sours that I can't imagine being done anywhere else.\\n\\nThe Funk Metal, which is a sour version of their Black Metal stout, is probably my favorite beer brewed in Texas and easily makes my top 10 beers ever. This includes things like bourbon-barrel-aged releases of already stunningly good stouts.\\n\\nTheir actual brewery doesn't let you down either. It's set out in beautiful hill country with home picnic tables and a pretty decent pizza place on the same grounds so you can eat while you drink.\\n\\nThe big, open, barn-style dining area is equal parts Texas hill country and Bavarian ale house making this a unique and charming place to spend time. They usually have music going on a stage in the middle as well. It's a great weekend afternoon/evening.

With good food this place could be a huge money maker and a great place to frequent regularly. A large part of their menu is Iranian food, so I thought maybe trying that would taste better considering it's owned by Iranians and should be authentic and the easiest thing for the chef to cook well. Wrong. Overcooked meat, bland and just overall unimpressive. The rest of the menu is worse, even the nachos are sub-par. The quality of ingredients seem to be lacking, the prices however are in keeping with higher quality food. I've never had a bad experience with service or anything.\\nThe grocery store portion is much better. Its convenient and they carry a decent variety of items although still catering to the local Persian community for sure. Their meat seems poor quality to me, do not go here if you in any way want organic, free range, etc higher quality meat. You won't find it. \\nTheir prices are extremely reasonable for dairy, produce and non - perishable goods. I do shop here often and find the service good, they've even brought in particular items I've requested because I'm there so often, which is nice they're so willing to accomodate their customers. \\nI've given 3 stars...mostly becuase the grocer would get a 4 and the restaurant a 2, so I split it halfway."},{"name":"Cafe Agora Midtown","address":"92 Peachtree Pl NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4.5","text":"Excellent little place in midtown.

Beers were way overpriced and the apps we had, while decent tasting, were likewise so.\\n\\nThe only reason for an extra star is the band who were playing Latin jazz with some verve.  Shamefully, they were relegated to a small, floor-level stage at the very back of the deep, weird grotto.  The band leader was clearly overmatched by his 6-string bass and continually behind the beat, but everyone else was excellent, especially the drummer (Mark?) who played actual music (for a drummer no less!) at EXACTLY the right volume level. \\n\\nIf I do go back, it would be to hear some more of that excellent drumming and Latin jazz.

Swagat always hit me the same way; the food was always OK, but rarely great and the service was usually just ho-hum.\\n\\nBut yesterday I was in the neighborhood around 12:30pm and decided on Swagat's lunch buffet.  Man, oh man, this has this place really elevated it's game in the months since I've been there last.  Quite possibly the best Indian buffet I've had in Pdx!\\n\\nI am a total Indian food slut: if we ever go on vacation for more than a few nights, and there is an Indian restaurant, we usually eat dinner there...and that's been going on since family vacations when I was a kid, so I've had Indian food in San Francisco, NYC, Seattle, Boston, London, Waikiki, Washington DC, even the island of Rhodos!\\n\\nI've tried everything from hole in the wall family places, to \\"gourmet\\" Indian - I much prefer the former, but in Pdx it seems like there's more of the latter (Bombay Cricket Club, East India Co, Plainfield's Mayur).\\n\\nIn the past I've preferred ordering entrees off the menu at Swagat over their buffet, but I was not terribly impressed by either.  However this last time we went the buffet was phenomenal.  They always have a great selection, with at least 2 lamb dishes (usually Keema Mattar and a less spicy version of lamb vindaloo), 2 chicken dishes (Murgh Makhani and Tandoori Chicken), to go with the 5 or so veggie entrees.  They also have have some salad, raita, veggie pakoras, sambar soup, naan, and mountains of delicious, fluffy basmati rice.\\n\\nWhile I appreciate that they offer 3 different chutneys, the mint is really the only standout - the tomato chutney is alright, but I really miss the standard sweet tamarind chutney.\\n\\nSo what made this visit better than in the past?  The curries tasted fresher, and there were lots of nice onions, peppers, and other veggies even in the meat curries.  In the past I've thought that during the buffet Swagat's curries have been a little bland, and really no better than a jar of \\"masala simmer sauce\\" you can pick up from the ethnic food section of most grocery stores.  I hate it when you can't taste the difference between a Korma, Vindaloo, or Makhani - sometimes a problem with the buffet at Swagat in the past.\\n\\nI don't know if they got a new chef or what, but each curry was distinct and tasty!  The only thing more immediately noticeable than the higher quality food was the renovated interior of the restaurant.  Swagat's Beaverton location always seemed a little cramped and chaotic, as it appeared to be a poorly converted old home.\\n\\nNow there is a little bar with a small selection of no-foolin' spirits immediately to your right when you come in the front door; this is the room you used to wait in to pick up your to-go orders, but now it looks as if they might try to turn it into a lounge where you could order a drink and maybe an appetizer.  Ultimately I don't know if there's enough room to pull that off, but it would be a nice touch.\\n\\nThe whole restaurant has been redecorated, and to great effect, with dark hardwood floors contrasting with pleasant off-white walls.  Simple decorations, such as jars of exotic spices on the walls, replace much of the more gaudy, over-the-top Indian artwork you see in many basic Indian restaurants.  Don't get me wrong, I appreciate traditional Indian artwork, and Swagat does retain some of these pieces, but sometimes it goes a little over the top and ends up looking kitschy.  Not here at Swagat!\\n\\nOverall the restaurant seems more logically laid out now, with the small lounge/lobby area up front, leading to a cozy middle dining room area with many smaller tables that can be pulled together for larger groups, and finally to what I would call the \\"main\\" dining area in the back - this is where the buffet is served.  I don't remember exactly how many, or how small the windows were in this room before the remodel, but now wall-to-wall windows across three walls, lending a very open and airy feel to the space.  It comes off much larger than it really is, even when there's a huge line for the buffet.\\n\\nAll in all Swagat has really stepped their game up in my book.  Now if only they'd add an Eastside location (in addition to Beaverton, they have a spot in Hillsboro and one on NW 21st) then I'd probably find myself eating there a couple times a week!"},{"name":"Only U Cafe","address":"5737 Dalhousie Road, Suite 116","city":"Vancouver","stars":"3.5","text":"This is pretty much the only place on campus that serves pancakes and other breakfasty foods. \\n\\nThe food is decent, nothing special.

For $11 I got the toast burger.  They used to call a burger on toast a lawrence burger in high school.  The meat wasn't bad, the lettuce crisp, the bacon chewy which is nice, but for the price I would have expected much much more.  It would've been nice not to have the blandest bread imaginable...whitebread, glorious in its lack of flavour.  The servings here are ridiculously meager, and thus ultimately unsatisfying when the check arrives.  For $12 you'd expect to get more food than can be fitted into half a can of Campbell's soup, but that's precisely what you get.  Apparently they may make bigger burgers at lunchtime so I may have to come back to give them a 2nd chance.  On the flip side, it's kind of nice watching the cop cars go by with lights flashing and their horns sounding their tune.------All right, the breakfast service is definitely better, although their burger is the same size, contrary to rumors so they get one more star from me.  Their pork belly is delectable, though they probably could have given bigger slices since pork belly is one of the cheaper cuts of meat.  The badass sandwich was nice and runny with crispy bacon.  I'd probably forgo the sausage turnover since it was a little dry and bland, though the crust was nice and buttery.  The potato rosti/hash brown was probably one of the best I've had.  Their desserts are okay I suppose, not too big on the pastries, but their whipped cream is adequate and they give you a sizable dollop.  I still think they should use bigger slices of toast, as well as having a larger burger option.  For $11 for a bacon burger, you need to expect more."},{"name":"Muqueca Restaurant","address":"1008 Cambridge St","city":"Cambridge","stars":"4","text":"Well..

Finally a dude walks up, he looks upset and right before I order the guy yells \\"we're out of ground beef, but can do steak and chicken\\". Next thing he looks at this older couple next to me and is all nice when he offers to replace their beef with steak or chicken. So then he comes back to me and I told him what I want and he asked steak or chicken and then tells me crazy price. I questioned it and he says \\"there is an up charge for the steak\\". So I'm all like \\"nah, you just gave it to those people and beef clearly isn't option.\\" This dude looks at me and says \\"it's not my fault that we don't have beef, I can't control that.\\" Y'all, I looked this dude in his eye sockets and said \\"it's not your fault that y'all didn't cook enough beef?\\"  I was over it, so I just left and I called the 800 number and they sent me 2 $5 coupons. Now onto visit 2. \\n\\n2. So I have 1 of my $5 coupons in hand and I drive over and order from the drive thru. I get up there and homeboy tells me \\"we don't accept these.\\"  I'm immediately shocked and explain to him why I have this thing and he was cool and went ahead and took it. But then he tells me that they ran out of the Cinnabon dessert that I just ordered and then I got home and my quesadilla was way over cooked. Whatever, it was mostly free, so it's cool. Now onto visit 3. \\n\\n3. Just now I go up there and I walk in this time. For starters the dude behind the register looks like a homeless guy they pulled off the street this morning. No uniform shirt, no name tag, shirt all dirty and wrinkled and he just looked sketchy. So I'm ordering and he just looks so angry to be alive and working at Taco Bell. When I'm done I hand him this coupon and he snaps \\"we don't accept these, you can't use this\\" and he tried to throw it away. We go back and forth, I explain how I got it and he tells me something about headquarters won't take them. They sent me the thing, why would they not accept it? So he gets someone else and she condescendingly asks how I got it as if I'm printing these in my basement so I can save $5. She finally says \\"we'll accept it this time, but we're not supposed to\\" as if she's doing me a favor. \\nThen the guy commences to tell me that I have to get some box, that I can't use it for what I ordered. Yet again, the coupon doesn't say anything about that.

The tour guide, who I think may have been one of the co-owners, felt really bad about this, so he gave me two very nice wine-bottle-sized bottles of beer to take with me.

Our list, let us show you it.\\n1. Local/ fresh/ seasonal: Restaurants that serve locally purchased and seasonal produce, cruelty free meats, and vegan/vegetarian options are always a bonus. Toast is about as local as you can get, serving fresh and delicious items from awesome P-town connoisseurs, whether it's veggies, meats, coffee, or juice.\\n2. Knowledgeable: We always feel that a restaurant can far surpass it's many competitors by being knowledgeable about the food they serve, what's in it, where it comes from, if they've tried it, and what they think of it. We want to know what's going in our bellies and if you think our bellies will be satiated. The very knowledgeable people at Toast gave us great recommendations and were happy and ready to answer all of our inquisitive foodie questions.\\n3. House-made accouterments: There is always originality in a restaurant that makes it's own versions of condiments, drinks, seasonings, etc. Toast makes their own badass hot sauce, which complimented both our meals and we think that making something common into your own unique creation, makes you stand out.\\n4. Good service: The service that the staff at a restaurant gives can make or break any one's experience, whether they're unfriendly or just inattentive. Toast's friendly service and smiling staff made our meal one to remember.\\n5. Atmosphere: We feel that the atmosphere of any eatery is a cornerstone to a positive nosh, heck, even distasteful art can ruin a good meal. Toast is a warm and bright environment with comfortable seating, good ambiance, adorable art, and overall aesthetically pleasing surroundings. We felt right at home as we dove face first into our delicious meals.\\n6. Coffee: Nothing goes better with a taste-bud-bursting breakfast than a strong cup of well crafted Joe. Toast serves a locally made coffee called Courier, which at first taste was a little weak for Jebby and I. The second time around was stronger and I sipped with pleasure, but Jebby felt it was still a skosh too flimsy. Obviously everyone has their feelings about how they like their coffee or don't like it for that matter, but for us, we like it strong, bold, and fragrant.\\n\\nThese six points are just an outline of how we like to grade our restaurant experience and I think we'd both agree that Toast deserves an A!\\nSo if you're looking for a locally minded, friendly, attentive, and unique meal, we would recommend you give Toast a try."},{"name":"Ristorante Molise","address":"464 Main St","city":"Wakefield","stars":"3.5","text":"A friend turned me onto Ristorante Molise a few years ago - what a great way to feel like you are in the North End in the suburbs : )  Excellent food - big portions and the owners and their staff are very attentive.

Dishes like sticky rice with preserved meat is also included in the price. On side there was also a small list of items you can get if you pay extra (ie. sauce, green onions). You get a separate list for things that can go on the bbq. Oh and there's oysters for your hot pot. The limit is 2 per person.\\n\\nWe were overwhelmed with all the choices so we didn't end up using the bbq or the steamer. All four of us were stuffed after 1.5 hours. We also go tofu pudding as dessert. I love the tofu dessert. I wish it were on the menu, I'd totally get all you can eat tofu pudding. It's even better than getting it some dessert places. \\n\\nThe service was prompt and they asked if we needed our teas filled. We might have been 5-10mins over but they didn't rush us out or anything. \\n\\nI'd suggest making a reservation if you've set your mind on having hot pot here.

I have not yet posted this online as I would like to give the organization the opportunity to hear my complaint in a private forum. \\n  I visited southern kin cookhouse on July 4th to celebrate with my wife and our two long time friends. We arrived around 3:30 walking in the front door to a large staff meeting on our right hand side with about 12 employees being lectured by their manager on hammering sales and getting the most out of the customer. Yes, I heard those exact words as I walked into the establishment. The hostess was asking us where we would like to sit and the manager looked at her and sternly told her where to seat us. Wow what is going on here!\\n The four of us sit down and wait about 15 minutes before we are greeted by our server as she was stuck in the staff meeting out by the entrance to the restaurant where everyone could see the discussion the manager was having, again lecturing his employees in plain site about upselling the customer. \\n  Finally we are greeted by Emily, a very nice girl however had no clue about anything going on in the restaurant and she made sure to let us know she was completely clueless. My friend and I asked what was on draft for the night and Emily responded with \\" I don't know, I'm not into beer but I can tell you we don't have the IPA and we don't have the house beer. \\" that's all she left us with and then asked my wife and her friend what they would like. They asked for a glass of rose, Emily told them they needed to get the \\" large format\\" because that's what she recommends. My wife and her friend asked how much comes in that and she said a little more than a glass. (Joke was on us because it could serve 4 people 2 drinks each).  Emily quickly left the table without asking my friend and i what we would like to drink. About 10 minutes go by and I have to flag her down to put in a drink order for my friend and I, Emily said \\"I'm busy I will be back with you\\" I get it but you never even took my friend and i's drink order. \\n She finally comes back takes our food order and myself and my friends drink order. \\n While waiting I got to watch an individual who may have been the manager but was dressed in a black shirt and sneakers behind the bar flirting with and touching the female staff members. I also got to watch him stirring the sangria with his fingers and throwing fruit into it as if he was shooting three pointers for the Celtics. At this point I am mortified and want to leave. As I look around there are multiple staff member hanging around the bar and not paying attention to anyone in the place. God I wish I just left.\\n   The sangria shows up and it's beyond enough to satisfy four people. Two girls just over 100 lbs each would never want that much sangria, what was this waitress thinking.  Btw the sangria was $68.00 and that's what Emily suggested for two women to split. Please don't forget it was also stirred by a staff members fingers.\\n   I really hate to say this but I will never ever go back and hope that we can resolve this so that I don't have to post this dissatisfaction on yelp. I expected way more from an establishment at Assembly in Somerville. \\n  I usually take my company's executives out to dinner at assembly when  they come to town. I always try the place before I take them, thank god I didn't take them here, I'd be looking for a new job. \\n\\nSorry to share this, I did not yet send it to the store as I don't feel the manager is capable of handling such an issue after watching him carry himself and interact with his staff during my meal there. \\n\\nPlease call me at anytime I am always available to discuss. \\n\\nThank you very much for your time,"},{"name":"Swift's Attic","address":"315 Congress Ave, Ste 200","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Swift's was pretty OK.\\n\\nFirst off, give credit where credit's due.

With that much time, you might expect a hand-carved mahogany interior with gold leaf, complete with cherubs and turrets.  \\n\\nBut no.  Even so, the new Zaftig's furnishings are much classier than their predecessor.  The tables are a little close together, but it's similar to other places.  And you'll still probably have more elbow room than you would at Kugel's.  The Brookline Zaftig's is much larger as I recall (could be wrong!).\\n\\nThere is now a tiny little bar area, though, which will come in handy for shoppers wanting to steel their nerves before braving the Christmas Tree Shops.  Though if you ask me, having a Deli next to the Christmas Tree Shops is somewhat jarring.\\n\\nOther reviewers are mentioning that the prices are high.  I agree.  The value proposition is not the big draw.  We ate breakfast and dinner, where I had stuffed French Toast and a hot corned beef sandwich, respectively.  My co-diners generally agreed that the food was good, not exceptional.  If the prices had been lower by 30%, I would have been delighted.\\n\\nOn the other hand, the waitstaff and management were very friendly and attentive.   Atypical of the stereotypical New York deli, to be sure.  They wear Zaftig's t-shirts that say \\"Best of Boston\\" on the back, but that refers to their Brookline location.  This new Zaftig's doesn't merit that designation yet, IMHO.\\n\\nDespite the expense, I'm giving Zaftig's 4 stars for good food, very good service, and a nice ambiance.  And also because they have a nice selection of deli meats, prepared foods, and desserts to go.  Again, on the pricey side.  But there really isn't anything in the area to compete - we needed a deli \\"real bad\\" around here!  Kugels is okay and cheaper, but not a very pleasant dining environment.\\n\\nSince they've only been open a week, I can only speculate how the place will change over time.

This is the worst burrito I've ever had.  And I've tasted some pretty badly flavored and overly salted ones.  But this burrito lacked in flavor altogether.  Imagine the worst cut of meat possible, gamy and without flavor.  They refunded me the charge for this dish, another reason why I'm willing to rate them with two stars versus one.\\n\\nMy girlfriend ordered a plate of chicken with rice, beans, and grilled vegetables.  If this were a vegetarian dish, she said it would be alright, considering that all the non-meat items were cooked well and tasted like what they were.

Simply tasteless.\\n\\nMy brother ordered the enchiladas: chicken, potato-chorizo, and the vegetarian option.  The potato and vegetarian enchiladas were fine, relatively bland, but okay.

The layer of crispy deep fry is very thin compared to that of fried chicken fast foods, which is a pleasant surprise and creates a nice meat/skin ratio with each bite.

After eating, I recommend taking a walk on the belt line after eating."},{"name":"Winsor Dim Sum Caf√©","address":"10 Tyler St","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"Let me start off by saying service blows. One of those places where they just work to do their job and not put in any attempt at customer service. Bummer because it's really not that hard to fake a smile, refill some drinks, check up on the table every now and then and ask \\"how is the food?\\" Really ups your chances of scoring a nice tip at the end. \\n\\n  Okay, so on with the food... I didn't feel like this was truly a dim sum experience and I've had dim sum on more than one occasion. I was expecting waiters to be pushing carts around, attracting us in so many ways a paper menu can't compete. Soo maybe not all dim sum restaurants are like that (just ones from previous experiences), considering this one referred to itself as a cafe. The menu itself was really small. I know the majority of dim sum variety are flour based, buns, dumplings and whatnot but I felt like the options were very limited to just that; starchy appetizers and barely any meals. I'm not saying that out of bias either because I do enjoy myself a good dumpling, I was hoping to see more greens if anything. \\n\\n  We arrived as a group of 6 and ordered a fairly decent amount. Lotus steam buns, roast pork dumplings, fried spring rolls (eggrolls, moreso), deep fried shrimp balls, chicken fingers and spare ribs with rice, baby bok choy with oyster sauce (really salty for my liking). So let me start off by saying the roast pork dumplings were actually pretty good. I'm use to eating their dumplings from the market filled with boiled eggs, if they add boiled eggs I think I would be in love. \\n\\n  The lotus steam buns were pretty flavorless, wouldn't order again. The fried spring/egg rolls were \\"meh\\", I've experienced better. The chicken fingers and spare ribs were totally not what I was expecting when I read it, but surprisingly pretty good. (note to reader: I wouldn't suggest ordering this if you're turned off by gelatinous meat. Otherwise, good flavor, not scary at all, just watch out for tiny chicken phalanges)\\n\\n  Lastly, let me talk about the fried shrimp balls. Great appetizer, not so great experience. We ordered this thinking it was solely shrimp meat in it (as the menu did not indicate anything otherwise), turns out it has crab meat in it. Let's just say, my poor ol' mother is highly allergic to crab meat and did not want to eat anything for the rest of our dining experience. I feel partly responsible because I was certain the shrimp balls only had shrimp in them and encouraged my mother to eat it... Up until I broke one open to find crab meat inside. Someone may reason that they are only imitation crab meat, but I'm sure even still there's some trace of the real stuff in that. In my mother's case she doesn't even need to eat a large amount to feel sick to her stomach. \\n\\n  I find this to be pure negligence, the least that could be done is a menu revamp. I don't speak just on my behalf alone, I'm sure anyone would want to be warned if something they order includes a potential anaphylactic shock. So not to be a complete sourpuss or anything, I just want to say that there are a few benefits to this place. 1) Reasonable prices (6 people, a decent amount of food= $36), and 2) Food came out quickly. 3) I guess if you're into quaint restaurants settings, steam buns, or fried foods this place is for you. \\n\\n  As far as whether or not I would return is debatable. Not all bad points, just not enough good points to convince me to try it again."},{"name":"Tasty n Sons","address":"3808 N Williams Ave, Ste C, Hub Building","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"Hold the phone.

Surprisingly, though, the charcuterie itself was unimpressive in my opinion -- so thinly sliced I could hardly taste it -- though the pate in our antipasto platter was delicious.  Once we finally got a table, we ordered some tapa-sized entrees.  Again, the squash and pesto pasta left us underwhelmed, while the beef tartare was fantastic.

For starters, I am not good at it, and I am generally not inclined to participate in activities that I am not good at.  It takes a lot of beer to make it fun for me.  Furthermore, I am squeamish about putting on shoes that only moments ago were on somebody else's feet.  How sanitary can that be?\\n\\nThe first time I went to Kings was on a date with a minor league baseball player.  You make a living throwing a ball at a defined target and you want to take me someplace where I will have to compete with you in a similar endeavor?  Strike one!  I suggested getting bumpers, to even the odds a little bit considering I don't think I could hit the broad side of a barn if my life depended on it, but he just laughed and said he'd go easy on me.  Yeah, but the gutters won't, buddy.  Needless to say, I lost badly, and we didn't go on very many more dates.\\n\\nI've been one time since, with a group of people, and wasn't any more impressed.  The food is just not that good.  The nachos are average to below average (I'm constantly surprised at how many places mess up nachos, especially since in theory they seem so failsafe!) and the buffalo wings, to put it mildly, sucked.  The sauce did not stick to the chicken at all; it definitely needed some more butter to give it a little cling.  The beer selection is also boring.\\n\\nLest anyone accuse me of hating on Kings just because I hate bowling, that isn't the case.  I always have a fabulous time at the candlepin place in Davis Square, and they don't even serve alcohol (of course, they do have a jukebox stocked with the Stones and Tom Petty, which I always enjoy commandeering for just a few dollars for the night).

About 15 feet wide by maybe 60 feet deep, the compact (200 sq ft) kitchen is very well thought out, with a stylish bar and adjacent stools for 8 or so.  Tables probably seat about 32.  It out-hips many Austin hot spots. \\n\\nFront of the house/back of the house partners Jerry and Julio clearly know something about food and wine.  They are delightfully modest about the place, just wanting to provide the freshest locally sourced ingredients possible--a strategy born of necessity.  There's little storage room in the tiny kitchen, so most items are brought in fresh every day, making for an ever rotating list of inventive tastes, from starters to salads, sandwiches, entrees, and desserts -- all made on site.  The only item contained in the small freezer:  their home made ice creams. \\n\\nOur terrific server started us off with a beautifully arranged platter of hummus, babaganoush, citrus marinated calamari olives and crostini.   Then we sampled a creamy and satisfying roasted garlic soup, made even more savory with a squeeze of fresh lemon juice. All tried and enjoyed a chicken, avacado and bacon panini, served with rosemary roasted potatoes and tasty homemade pickles. \\n\\nFinally, a rich four cheese macaroni to-die-for arrived, topped with whispy-thin fried onion rings and sprigs of fresh thyme.

You better like olives if getting this though. I ordered on side and still found some in salal plus friend who kept his in had tons & said they were a bit overwhelming. Also they mix with dressing before serving. Someone used way too much dressing.\\n\\nPersonal Deep Dish Pizza- Perfect.. Cheese on bottom crust cooked perfectly. Also 9 grain cryst very good.\\n\\nRattlesnake Pasta- Spiiiicy! Yummo! Jalepeno Chx Alfredo.\\n\\nAlvocado Eggrolls- A little weird. But some liked them.\\n\\nCajun Chx Sandwich- All spicy & flavorful. Special mayo with a spicy jack cheese & alvocado! Great mix of flavors. \\n\\nSliders- Way too chard & black on outside. Which made them super dry & chard tasting. I believe it was because patties were too thick. We ordered them well so I did put that into account but outside could still have not been so chard.\\n\\nMacadamia Mini Dessert- Just amazing. Served in a little hot dish with icecream on top. But don't let Mini fool you. It's still big enough for 2. lol.\\n\\nSERVICE WAS AMAZING! Erica was the best. We had her 2 out of the 4 times! I used to waitress for years off & on.. And I LOVED IT! I feel I was an awesome waitress, lol! so I'm oh so picky! And she ROCKED. She was so attentive! Always smiling. Very helpful with annoying questions..lol. And even suggested items like waitresses are asked to do :) \\n\\nCan't wait to come back..

Everything was packaged so well - all in aluminum trays. Chicken in one tray with vents cut on top so fried coating didn't get soft, roti in another, sticky rice and jasmine rice had their own trays as well. Same with the ground pork and curry. Pickled veggies, cucumbers/green beans (for the pork), fried shallots, the dipping broth for the chicken...all packaged individually.\\n\\nI had friends pick it up at 6:30pm and we ate probably around 8pm or so. Everything, like always, was SO GOOD! And plenty of leftovers as we didn't have the 20 people we purchased for.\\n\\nOur total was $300 and like I said...plenty of food.

I thought the korma was excellent, and the fiance said the goan fish curry was very good. The naan was just fine, and the raita was pretty good. The kheer was MAGNIFICENT. Best we've had in Austin. Dinner was served in kadhais - basically fancy metal dishes. Nice touch. You get a free lime soda-like drink with the meal, and complimentary mints and candies after. Oh, also these little potato appetizer things. I thought the samosas could have used a little improvement, but they were still good. We thought they were on the smaller side, too. We would have liked to have two types of chutneys with them, like most Indian food places serve, a savory and a sweet. But this is really petty considering everything else that was offered. \\n\\nThe bathroom is nice and clean. One of the spouts had cold water, and another had really hot water, but I'm sure they've fixed this by now. This place is so nice! We did not expect this place in a strip center, and we came in impulsively, wearing hoodies and jeans. They have a full bar, flat screens, flowers on the tables, upscale decorating. Really modern. Before we left we had two beautiful ladies come by our table and ask if everything was okay. I really get a sense of pride in their restaurant from them, and I love that.  One told us they are going to have live Indian music soon. That is so great! How many other Indian restaurants do this? (Rhetorical question, obviously. Answer: not many). We were really impressed with the ambiance, and the food. However, our waitress made us wait for the ticket, and generally was not very attentive.

She quickly glanced and said 'wonton soup'  which I said 'no' and pointed to the same item again while telling her the exact number. She took down the rest of the order and left. We waited an hour for the food. In that time, they took away our empty teapot and never returned.

We noticed two other tables who ordered the same dish after us already got theirs. \\nAfter trying to wave down and make eye contact with multiple waitresses and getting completely ignored, our friend walked up to our waitress and told her to cancel the noodles. \\nWe all got up to pay the bill at the front since waiting for service no longer seems to be an option. She said unapologetically 'We gave your noodles to another table'  and I said 'I know.'  Then, she had the balls to reply 'Well, you got the wonton soup so that covers the missing dish.' I was at a loss for words. We didn't get what we ordered and had to pay for her mistake. We paid the exact amount on the bill and did not leave a tip.  She was actually surprised.

Across from the new luxury condos/restaurants they built. There's metered street parking, a parking lot down the street, and a parking deck you can pay to use nearby off Crescent.\\n\\nDECOR/AMBIENCE: Love the look of this place! It does have a fresh Carribeam vibe, the dark wood floors, flowy sheer white curtains, exposed wooden beams ceilings, and music all add to the vibe of the place. You have to acknowledge the thought put into it, for example the larged tufted  seat backing for booth look to be more of a burlap/linen instean of leather or velvet. That color and look choice aids to the stylish carribean vibe.\\n\\nThe tucked away feel of the place would make me feel comfortable coming here alone and sitting at the bar.\\n\\nFOOD:\\nWe had the Jerk Rolls for appetizer, they were delish! Basically they're a carribean/jamaican spring roll. They also have other flavors like curry\\n\\nHe got Escovitch Tilapia that comes with cabbage, try rice and peas, and plantain. He loved it\\n\\nI got Brown Stew Tilapia that comes with the same stuff and it just wasn't good. I usually just get brown stew chicken, but took a chance, but that backfired.\\n\\nCoco bread- I love cocoa bread, I prefer mine slightly sweet. This one was basically just dough bread. I didn't like because it wasn't sweet, but it was good bread generally speaking.\\n\\nCarrot Cake- for dessert I got this and was see disappointed with all the raisins in it. Why is my precious carrot cake stuffed with raisins. It was pretty good cake, but I had to basically tear it apart and eat it as crumbs because of all the raisins. Please just cook moist carrot cake with NO raisins.\\n\\nCocktails- We tried 2 of the signature cocktails and they were pretty good.\\n\\n\\nSERVICE: Here's where the stars should fall. Alot. But I'm being nice since I'm carribean and want them to succeed. Buuuut service was slow, the server/bartender had some what of an attitude (she may have been stressed though b/c she was doing a lot, but still don't catch attitudes with smiling customers) and the guy bartender was sloooooow I mean he was clearly just a pretty face and is new to making drinks... we sat at the bar and it took about 20 minutes to get our drinks, haha. \\n\\nThey really just seemed to be very disorganized. Someone needs to just come and tighten ship and this place could be a huuuge success. Because everyone loves Jamaicans and their food PLUS you're located on the hottest block in the whole Atlanta. So, Stir It Up, Make sure your food is great (fresh quality and good flavor), make sure the kitchen has everything going out ON TIME, keep the place clean, continue to walk around happily engaging customers and you should be awesome! The owner was sweet btw, both her and Jasmine were doing there best to be friendly.\\n\\nPEOPLE/CROWD: Cool stylish mixed crowd. \\n\\nETC: I didn't get a chance to go down stairs to the lounge part, but I'll do that soon hopefully. Also they have different theme nights, go to their website to find out more information.\\n\\nThat block is becoming a little international food fare. There's this jamaican restaurant, a new indian spot across the street, an irish pub, sushi, a couple southern restaurants, mexican cantina, a new burger spot with good ole american fare, etc. I'm loving it!\\n\\nSUMMARY:\\n Everyone try them out. At the least \\"pre game\\" there with a drink and some jerk rolls! I hope they have success and continue to make improvements.\\n\\n***UPDATE***: I've gone several times since the review above and I the food just depends on who's cooking.

They were vegan and seasoned with ginger. The ginger made them sweet and spicy at the same time. At first the sweetness threw me off but I liked it.

In a room without air conditioning on a 90+ degree day, the chilled soup was a welcome first course.  Very floral and fresh, it was a little too lavendar/perfume tasting to me.  Maybe because I don't have much experience with chilled soup or edible flowers.  We chose the pairing flight, which offered a small pour of a specifically selected wine with each course.  It's odd to have a Portland menu sans any Oregon wine (bordering on sacrilege, actually), but paired so well with the simple, lovely food, it couldn't have been more perfect.\\n \\nBeast's signature meat tasting plate made all the little bites I'd seen on Iron Chef America real and tastable.  The blood sausage is rich, a bit smoky, like a deep country-style pate.  Loved the smooth, salty chicken liver mousse cut with a snappy house cracker.  The winner was the pork shoulder rilettes with Seville marmalade.  I could eat an entire trough of that candy.  Imagine the best pulled pork you've ever had, topped with a note of sweet citrus.  The fennel salad in the center, again, very welcome in the heat alongside the heavy.  Each bite is decadence squared.\\n \\nIn between this and the main course, we were treated to an \\"off script\\" intermission - a berry-something sorbet along with a red wine that tasted like jam and sunshine.  Those two playing on my tongue, basking in their season... probably my favorite taste of the night.\\n \\nBeef Cheeks might sound like something you'd pick up in the \\"Others\\" bin at WinCo, but this is an elegant, mild and tender cut.  And with that cloud of horseradish cream and sea of flavorful jus, how could you not ravage it? \\n\\nThe cheese plate featured mild selections, including a very good French soft-ripened.  I kind of gave up on these; quite a few imports have a funk.  The scene was stolen by the candied hazelnuts, spiked with a flowery honey.  \\n\\nThe point of the communal table was lost on our crowd - we were surrounded by unfriendly Portlanders (or maybe visitors from San Fran?  Portlanders are usually a *little* friendly), and they kept their conversations tightly to themselves.  But I was in good company that I don't get to see very often, so seriously whatever.

Emily trashed a near-and-dear to her heart successful restaurant concept and rebuilt, from her mac-and-cheese ashes, an entirely new dining concept and experience.\\n\\nHer risk is paying off well.\\n\\nQuaintrelle's farm-to-market (okay, okay, you're thinking you've heard this all before) fresh from the ground ingredients, leave no room for doubt her solid choice to shake-up her restaurant concept is a great move.\\n\\nAndrew and Annedira Beckham's equally risky wine adventure found its taste-mate and soul-mate in Quaintrelle.  Pottery teacher by day, wine maker by night, Beckham's pottery-aged amphora wine stands well on its own merit and partner well with Quaintrelle's fresh menu.  Both proudly boast (as they should) delectable creation made with intention.\\n\\nQuaintrelle's heralded chefs have worked in other Portland award-winning restaurants.\\n\\nBoth Beckham and Quaintrelle draw from raw Oregon soil,finished products that charm our palates and titillate our intellect.  Amongst the local product skillfully used in Quaintrelle's dishes, Willamette Valley quinoa. Emily tells us  this local grower delivers its goods with a hand written invoice and dirt under his fingernails.  More expensive than other quinoa, its texture and taste make the investment worth its weight in gold.\\n\\nBeckham's Olivia Rose of Pinot Noir (named for their youngest daughter) is a combination of dedicated fruit from multiple harvest dates, fermented, aged in oak, and comes paired with our first course of a summer squash blossom and crostini created from a combination of ingredients that baffle the imagination.  Vegetables, fruit, spices, presented beautifully teach us much about Oregon's soils, food chemistry and food presentation. The chefs deftly decorate ribeye steaks, lamb and other meat dishes with a sprinkling of edible seasonal flowers.\\n\\nMultiple courses kept revealing Oregon's bounty. Wine aged in pottery (created by Beckham's owners); dishes awash in locally grown produce, savory herbs and spices, did well to keep our gathering engrossed in engaging conversation. The Beckham's and Emily not only teach us about menu prep but also about the art and science of creating fine food and wine.  We leave not only with placated palettes but also with a higher food science IQ.\\n\\nThe piece de resistance is hard to determine amongst so many heavenly eating and drinking choices.  The Beckham's treated us to a \\"secret\\" desert Grenache unavailable for purchase.  It was the perfect complement to our coffee chocolate pudding and shortbread.\\n\\nVenture from the outlying west-side 'burbs to Quaintrelle and to the hillsides surrounding highway 99 to Beckham Estate Winery. It will not only pleasure your palette but keep money in your wallet, too. Our own back-yard is filled with fine dining and award winning wines both California and Europe envy.\\n\\nWhether you find Quaintrelle quelled and quaint, or you Bend it like Beckham, either way, you'll have an epicurean ball."},{"name":"Oriental Express","address":"7517 Cameron Rd, Ste 130","city":"Austin","stars":"3","text":"The food was ok   the wonton soup was not very good. too soft.  they split the tickets which we (to my knowledge we did not know they were going to do   I will not go back but the entrees were not bad"},{"name":"Chuy's","address":"7913 W Irlo Bronson Memorial Hwy","city":"Kissimmee","stars":"4","text":"My first time to chuy's.

While the food was delicious and carefully and beautifully plated, I wasn't blown away by the food nor experience.\\n\\nAs other reviewers mentioned, the seating arrangement is communal seating, meaning you and your group are seated at a table with multiple other groups of people. This can either be an exciting new experience or cause anxiety for those who aren't comfortable with the possible pressure of being social with strangers. Just remember that you're not forced to talk to other people if you don't want! But it could also be fun to share the experience with people outside of your group.\\n\\nWe were given six plates of food and two smaller plates of appetizer and dessert. Here's what I can remember:\\n\\n- Lobster appetizer: good starter, though I don't quite remember what it was\\n-Octopus with olives: beautifully plated and flavored. The octopus and accompanying sauce went well with olives (and I don't like olives)\\n-Truffle pasta: The pasta was topped with mushrooms, roe, caviar, and peas. I really liked this dish, though I don't really like peas in general, so that threw slightly off for me.\\n-Pork with blackberries, cheese, and vinaigrette: tasty and best when you fit a little bit of everything in one bite (berry, cheese, pork, veggie)\\n-Cucumber tomato salad with dill and cream cheese spread(?). I am not sure what kind of cheese it was, but it had dill in it and went well with the salad. It was a refreshing break in the meal.\\n-Cheese with crackers and sweet and sour sauce(?): I love cheese and will eat cheese by the bag or block in one sitting, but there are certain cheeses that just don't work for me. I don't know what kind of cheese this was, but my thought upon first bite was that it tasted like feet. However, the more I ate of it, the better it tasted! Don't let my first reaction deter you from trying this dish--everything works well together.\\n-Panna Cotta with berry sauce and sorbet: hands down my favorite dish of the night! Even my boyfriend said so and he does not like sweets. The panna cotta was light and went so well with the sorbet, berries, and sauce. I could've had two if I weren't so full from the meal.\\n-Macarons! We ended the meal with a sweet send off into the night.\\n\\nWe also paired wine with each dish, which was fun. If you are willing to spend a bit more for a more in-depth experience, I would recommend. BUT I don't think it was necessary to enjoy the meal. It just elevates the experience.\\n \\nOne more thing to note is that my boyfriend and I were celebrating an anniversary that night and had noted that in the reservation. The restaurant did not acknowledge this occasion at all. I don't really expect anything special for that, but having gone to other (cheaper) restaurants that give free dessert or wine without us asking on such an occasion, it makes it hard for me to rate Beast highly among places I'd return to."},{"name":"Highland Kitchen","address":"150 Highland Ave","city":"Somerville","stars":"4","text":"Worth the wait!\\n\\nWe went for brunch at noon on Sunday and had to wait about an hours.

They are such a long standing classic, romantic yet family oriented restaurant. Best cheesecakes you an buy from a restaurant. I usually order either the Lemon Herb Roasted Chicken or the Jamaican Black Pepper Shrimp. Both are just amazing. The lemon herb chicken is packed with flavors. You can definitely taste the lemon and it goes perfectly with the herbs. It's paired with carrots that are cooked just right. Not overdone and not too hard. The Jamaican shrimp is also packed with flavor which is a must. It's paired with rice and black beans and a diced pineapples melody. It's delicious. This location is relatively close to my job so I usually order Togo. They are pretty busy at this location so I would recommend to dine in if you have the chance.

They told me it was going to be about 1-1.5 hours for our group of 4, and that was okay. When our other friends arrived, we decided to grab a drink at the bar. Still with no buzzer going off, and obviously more time to kill, we decided to go and get some food in the restaurant next to the lanes.\\n\\nThroughout the whole meal, noooo buzzer. Finally after about a 2 hour wait, after we're done with our meal, and even lingered in hopes of being buzzed... we decide to leave. As I'm walking up to the counter to return the buzzer... what do you know... it goes off. I tell them that we don't need the lane anymore. Some guys had just put their names down on the list, had a 4some, and since we had just been buzzed, I asked if they could just take our spot. Unfortunately for those guys, that wasn't allowed and they would have to wait. I hope they got to bowl, as we left just before midnight, on a work night, w/o that opportunity.\\n\\n**Additional Edit**\\nA few hours after posting this, the GM contacted me.

It was a weekday, and still there were at least a good 40 minute wait to dine there.

It was meat, chicken and veal in some sort of cream sauce and fresh pasta. I recalled being overwhelmed after every bite, and time seemed to just stop. It was definitely one of those times where I just did not want the sensation to end.

It is chockful of extras, dressed up with sauces, and plated with colors and garnishes galore. Not minimalist japanese at all. This isn't a bad thing though. Sometimes we just crave savory things dressed up like dessert. \\n\\nI had been to a Sansai in LA before so I was confused that this place had a full sushi menu (the LA one only had \\"bentos\\" with choices of salads and CA rolls. \\n\\nIt has all day Happy Hour which essentially means the entire menu has inflated prices so tehre's a discount to be taken off. It's still rather reasonable though. I just find it silly to even say antyhing at all.\\n\\nWe like the one that is drizzled with spicy mayo and topped with fresh jalapenos. So not authentic, but we can never turn down anything spicy. See all the desserty platings in the pics. \\n\\nThe nice thing about dessert sushi is that it's rather rice heavy because of its creative rolls so be prepared to be stuffed. We always take at least 1 take out box on each visit.

What they were offering on their menu for this looked very appealing.  According to my directions, it was going to take 35 min. to get there.  But on a Friday early evening during rush hour, it took just over an hour.\\n\\nLocated on the top floor of Reunion Resort, it's a very inviting little restaurant.  It wasn't packed, but there were quite a few patrons.  We decided to sit outside on the pool deck where you have a wonderful view of the resort (also because, although it was pretty humid outside, it was like being in the Antarctic inside they had the A/C on full blast).  On a clear day, you can even see all the way out to I-Drive.\\n\\nWe ordered from the Magical Dining Menu.  They offered two different appetizers, two entrees, and two deserts.  Since there were two of us, we figured try it all :)\\n\\nThe portions were really small, but damn delicious.  Although we shared, I'll let Cristina review what she had.  For appetizer I had the Grilled Cheese and Tomato Soup (fire roasted tomato bisque, crispy pancetta, Cowgirl Creamery brie, manchego, grilled ciabatta).  Now I don't know if this is regular servings, but it was very small.  The Grilled Cheese sandwich tasted pretty good; very crunchy from the butter, but was about 1/8th the size of a sandwich.  I think he just cut off the crust and served it to me.  The tomato soup was served in a cup about the size of a shot glass.  Though it was a very small serving, I was very pleased with the soup.  Very creamy and tasted fresh.  Perfect.  Great appetizer, I just wish it wasn't such a meager serving.\\n\\nFor the entree, I had the Braised Beef Shortribs (Bleu cheese potato croquette, royal trumpet mushrooms, asparagus, gorgonzola veloute, bordelaise sauce).  We first laughed at the serving size.  It was about the size of a midgets fist.  But it actually ended up being the perfect serving :D  Anyway, the chef made the beef perfect.  It was very tender and not over cooked.  The sauces helped compliment the food.   I'm not a fan of mushrooms and yet I made sure there was nothing left on my plate.\\n\\nFor dessert I had the Housemade Gelato - Chocolate, Vanilla, and Cookies and Cream.  Pretty disappointed with this one.  It simply tasted like store bought ice cream.\\n\\nNow, although I'm not used to fancy restaurants and small servings, based on the restaurant, ambiance, and wonderful food, I wanted to give this place a 4-star rating.  But unfortunately I cannot.\\n\\nWhat dragged Eleven down one star was the not so great service from our waitress.  Aside from taking our drink order, meal order, and delivering our food, she not once came to ask us how we were doing or how the food was.  She never swung by just to check on us or make small talk.  Obviously we didn't feel very welcomed.  But it made sense in the end.  Upon taking a second look at the Magical Dining Menu we had, at the bottom in small print, it stated that there was an additional 20% surcharge automatically added to the check.  This girl was getting an automatic 20% tip from us, and it showed once we got the check - there wasn't an additional tip line for you to fill out.\\n\\nShe knew that she didn't have to try and work for the tip.  It's very unfortunately because we didn't get five star treatment from our waitress, yet she still makes out like a bandit in the end.  Oh well.\\n\\nAside from crappy service from Jeanette, we had a wonderful time.  Great ambiance, great view, and great food (though small servings).  It's quite a drive for us to visit, so I can't promise I'll be back anytime soon.  But definitely had a good time."},{"name":"Jester King Brewery","address":"13187 Fitzhugh Rd","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"Covered in hipsters, smells like shit (literally), and a failed attempt at sour beers.

As for their fish sauce, it's not stinky enough.  I'm serious.  The stinkier ones simply taste better.\\n\\nCuriously enough, this place takes credit cards.  This is the good news.

Seriously.\\n\\nOk. So the food. We started with the blistered shishitos and the grilled edamame served with pop rocks. Both were excellent. Fantastic even. I've never had grilled edamame and it was gooooood. The shisitos were perfectly cooked, tender, and delicious. The dipping sauce they serve with it was unnecessary and frankly, I'm not sure what it was. I was also impressed with how large the serving was.

I was essentially served a bowl filled with porridge like rice with 4-5 cubes of overcooked kabocha squash and a couple of halved shishito peppers on top. The difference in the consistency between the rice and the squash was indistinguishable. I felt like I was eating baby food and the ratio of rice to veg was 8:2. I was digging around looking for vegetables. Alas, they were gone and I still had a dish that was still mostly full. I think this is the only vegetarian offering on the menu. If that's the case, this vegetarian asks you to just take it off until you get it right.

Nice atmosphere, not too loud. It has a decent amount of personality.\\n\\nSERVICE: Our server was friendly, efficient and good at refilling drinks (water, ice tea and cocktails), the only issue was she was far too quiet, and the issue with drinks I'll explain in a moment could have been handled better.\\n\\nDRINKS: The drinks are the real downfall of this place.  My partner had two drinks - the first was the Defying Gravity (hendricks gin, strawberries, balsamic vinager, st. germain foam), which didn't taste of any of the the ingredients and seemed to be missing the st. germain foam). When asked, the server said \\"oh, the machine that makes the foam is broken, so it's not in there.\\"  No offer to replace the drink or take it off the bill. She SHOULD have come out and said \\"We can't make this drink properly, what else can i get you\\".  The 2nd cocktail, the Master Of The House (maker's mark, maple liqueur, peach puree, soda water) was just a strong bourbon drink with none of the ingredients. There's a serious problem with the bartending staff here, and as i said, the only flaw in the service was not communicating about the first drink.\\n\\nFOOD: So the food was excellent, but it is overpriced for the portion side.. We had a crab cake app that was delicious, but one normal to small sized crab cake. For $15.  It was delicious, but it was at best an amuse bouche portion, definitely not worth $15.\\n\\nFor mains, my partner had the daily catch, which was salmon over gnocci and he raved about it, and the bites i had were great.

If you make it to Lake Mary Blvd, you've gone too far! The township of Midway has a population less than 2,000 people but has the best BBQ that I have had in Central Florida. I will grant you that BBQ is very subjective and in the South, serious arguments are had about the art of meat smoking. I can say without Hyperbole that Joners Oaksmoke House is the best BBQ I have had in Central Florida. \\n\\nYou turn onto Broadway off of 46 and immediately to your right is Joners Oaksmoke House. It's a small building and when we entered, we found some locals relaxing and waiting for their orders to be filled. This is a Cash Only establishment, so make your way to the Racetrack down the road and hit up the ATM if needed. \\n\\nThe menu is written on a white board and has all of the offered items, even some which are currently not available depending on the time of year (we are totally coming back for the Goat and Raccoon in late October!). You can order the food in \\"Sandwiches\\" or you can order them in \\"Meals\\" with two sides coming with each meal. Sandwiches really just means small portion with two slices of white bread, which is the route we went because we wanted to try as many different options as possible on our first trip.\\n\\nOn our first visit, we purchased: Ribs, Pigs Feet and a Sausage. The ribs were A+ quality. This means they melt in your mouth, came easily off the bone and have smoke flavor packed into each bite. As many a BBQ aficionado knows, the cut counts just as much as the cooking method, and the meat was great. The Pigs Feet came with pig skin mixed with the some meaty knuckles. The skin melted in our mouths and was not too \\"pork rindy\\" as pig skin can often taste. It too had some great smoke flavor.\\n\\n The real show stealer was the sausage. Smothered in the Mustard Based Spicy BBQ Sauce and placed in a nice hoagie, the meat literally shoots juice into your mouth. From the moment I took my first bite, I knew it was something special. If you get multiple items, eat this last. Seriously, it made the Ribs and Pigs Feet taste less delicious in comparison, and the Ribs and Pigs Feet are top notch!\\n\\nIf you are looking for good BBQ, this is a no brainer.

I think I have had everything on the Tapas menu at least once at this point and enjoyed them all with my favorites listed below:\\n\\nBlue cheese fondue with chorizo and toasted bread: By far the most delicious cheese dip I have ever had. Order and extra side of bread because you will want to finish every last drop and for some reason there is never enough bread.\\n\\nThe BLT Aranchini:  Little fried balls of BLT goodness. Delicious!\\n\\nThe Fried Milk:  I know that it sounds weird, but these little coconutty balls of fried coconut  that you dip into sweetened condensed milk are just amazing. Heavy, but AMAZING.  Share them, of you will gain 10 lbs from one serving :)\\n\\nThe service is always friendly and quick. I almost think I shouldn't even write this review so it can remain my private little oasis, but alas....I must. Restaurants this good deserve the recognition!"},{"name":"Turner's Seafood - Salem","address":"43 Church St","city":"Salem","stars":"4.5","text":"This may be one of the most disappointing restaurant experiences. My party and I left here feeling not only highly dissatisfied but robbed actually. Onto the food and drink - calamari appetizer was like rubber; $45 lobster pie was some of the most overcooked I've had; shrimp pasta fra diavolo was served room temperature and had literally four medium sized pieces of shrimp in it; tenderloin medallions were cooked to the right temperature but tasted like it had zero seasoning and no flavor; potato and veggie sides were both undercooked and crunchy; $68 bottle of red wine (pinot noir) served about ten degrees too warm. To top off the night, an automatic 20% gratuity was added to the bill for having a party of ten (five of whom were children). Brought my extended family here, most visiting from out of town, looking for a great seafood experience for the folks who don't have \\"fresh seafood\\" back home...embarrassing to say the least to have made the fatal mistake of choosing Turner's. The lobster roll from Kelly's Roast Beef for less than half the price a few days later put Turner's to shame! This wasn't my first time dining at Turner's, but it's been at least three years, and will certainly be my last. Bad night in the kitchen perhaps? New owner or chef? Not sure, but I have to believe that the positive reviews bringing up Turner's overall rating on Yelp must be dated."},{"name":"Stir It Up","address":"84 12th St NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3","text":"I love Caribbean food so I was excited to try this place.  Needless to say, I won't be back.  A coworker and I went for lunch on 3/7/2014.  We didn't have to wait long to be seated but we had to wait for everything else!  We sat for 10 minutes until someone finally came to take our drink orders.  After asking a few questions about the menu, we realized that there was no white meat in any of the chicken dishes.  This was alarming considering the fact that their prices are at least 60%-70% higher than most other Caribbean restaurants ($19 for Oxtails!!!).  We finally ordered and we waited...and waited...and waited.....50 minutes later, our food finally arrived!  I had the Curry Chicken, which was ok at best but the portion sizes were very small.  If you want good Caribbean food at reasonable prices, I suggest you go to Scotch Bonnet or Mango's.  If you want to wait for overpriced food and small portions, take your chances with this place."},{"name":"McMenamins Tavern & Pool","address":"1716 NW 23rd Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"The WORST place & food ever! We waited more than 20 minutes for our drinks then we waited 1 hour for our food, which one of our party of four's fries were cold.  Chicken tenders and the fish & chips were tasteless. A family of 6 walked out due to waiting over 2 hours for food."},{"name":"Flats Handcrafted Flatbreads","address":"152 Walton St","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Went there for lunch on Friday. It was good.  Different, which was nice.  \\nI'd suggest paying with cash if you eat there.  They ran my card giving themselves an almost 50% tip (FOR COUNTER SERVICE?!? Not in a million years.  That sucks to do to customers.  Probably won't go back."},{"name":"Highland Kitchen","address":"150 Highland Ave","city":"Somerville","stars":"4","text":"Highland Kitchen has always delivered with reasonably-priced quality dishes and a unique menu.  Add to that an amazing drink selection and you have yourself a great place to be on any night of the week.  If you're looking for a quieter, more mellow dinner, visit Highland on a weeknight, but if you're looking for an upbeat and vibrant evening go on the weekend.  Its also a great spot just for a drink at the bar.. the bartenders are super friendly too!  I've always been pleased with my experience at Highland and will continue to frequent it in years to come."},{"name":"Salt & Straw","address":"2035 NE Alberta St","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"Fun flavors and worth the wait.  We love to take out-of-town friends....they groan a bit when they see the wait.  We spend time in line catching up and digesting dinner.  By the time we make it to the front of the line we are ready for ice cream.  The staff is always friendly and almost enjoy allowing you to taste several flavors.  Great company all around."},{"name":"Melton's App & Tap","address":"2500 N Decatur Rd","city":"Decatur","stars":"4","text":"Meltons could win a Michelin star for bar food. Its been consistent for the 12 years I have lived in Georgia. Its the neighborhood pub for locals with a great draft beer selection and fresh food. The buffalo tender sandwich is my favorite but you really can't go wrong with any of them."},{"name":"Pizza Hut","address":"11600 SE Mill Plain Blvd, Ste C","city":"Vancouver","stars":"2","text":"Firstly, you should be aware of the trend of reviews this location is getting, which have been HORRIBLE. I thought I'd give it a shot regardless, as I was hungry, and found out everyone has been right, and possibly were even KIND about their reviews, as this is by FAR the worst experience I've ever had with customer service, or lack thereof. \\n\\nI tried calling this location beginning at 11:20PM, with no one ever picking up the phone after multiple attempts of over 20 minutes. I finally drove there and arrived at 11:45PM, 15 min before closing, so that I could at least do carry-out. I was seen entering, though no one came up to me at the counter. I finally had to peek around the corner to seek assistance. \\n\\nSeemingly incredibly bothered \\"James\\" asked me what I wanted. I asked if he needed to answer the phone that was ringing at that moment, and he said \\"not really\\" ... I then let him know that was me still trying to call them, as I wanted proof that they could hear the phone, but chose to ignore it. He was less than impressed, and simply said they were closed. I informed him that the website states they're open until midnight, and that I had been trying to call for the past 30 minutes.\\n\\nHe said that regardless I wasn't getting a pizza from them, and that I  needed to leave. I refused, and he walked away telling some other guy (later learned this was \\"Justin\\") to deal with me. \\"Justin\\" just looked at me and also walked away. I called \\"James\\" back, and he said if I didn't leave that he was going to call the cops. I welcomed him to, as I said I was well within my rights to be there during OPEN hours, and wanted to make the purchase I had come there for. After much argument, he leaked that they had chosen to apparently close early due to low customer sales .... though they couldn't apparently be bothered to answer the phone to tell PROSPECTIVE customers that ... so thus further wasted my time by not picking up. \\n\\nHe kept saying he wasn't the manager, didn't have keys to lock the door (why it was apparently still opened), etc. I asked if there was a manager on duty, and he said yes, but didn't know where she was (this is a TINY store with no restaurant seating ... how they HELL does he not know where the manager is?!?!).  He at least informed me that her name was \\"Kayla\\".\\n\\nSo in short, I wanted to order but was not allowed to. In addition, I was treated with contempt, and flat-out the WORST customer service I've ever experienced. \\n\\nI'll never attempt to order from this place again, and can only pray that everyone there gets fired and the owner of this franchise gets a clue and starts fresh with staff that actually gives a crap."},{"name":"Salt & Straw","address":"2035 NE Alberta St","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"Alright, I admit it, this place IS worth all the hype! Yes, their lines are long. Yes, their prices are high. But the quality and level of ice cream they're churning out here is worth it! The flavor combinations have a umami-like quality, balancing sweet, salty, and savory alike. They truly have a flavor for everyone, including the picky, the vegans, and the adventurous. The flavors that fall onto my favorites list include: sea salt ice cream with caramel ribbons, stumptown coffee and bourbon, and wildflower honey with ricotta & walnut cookies. This truly is an ice cream parlor for grown ups; however, they do have traditional flavors for the kids too."},{"name":"Border Cafe","address":"356 Broadway","city":"Saugus","stars":"3.5","text":"Hands down the best Tex Mex food in the Greater Boston area. The salad dressings are made in house and are delicious. Jose's rice has just the right amount of heat and flavor. The Chicken Taco's are very reasonably priced, tasty, and very filling.

I've been going here for years and have never had a bad food item and am always more than full when i leave."},{"name":"Mocha Java","address":"3 Eastern Ave","city":"Dedham","stars":"4","text":"Great frozen drinks. The staff is very friendly and attentive to their customers. The espresso drinks are the best option. The other options like iced coffee is not my fav - but I am very picky. It is MUCH better than Dunkin Donuts and the sort ... but the Espresso drinks are REALLY where Mocha Java shines.
