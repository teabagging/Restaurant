We got a dozen, half East Coast, half West Coast.  Very good bread/roll service, could eat those till the cows came home: yeasty, buttery goodness. BEAUTIFUL, open dining space - and I love the Oyster Bar side as well...very retro-fun decor.  Service was quite smiley and eager-to-please.  Did not rush us, even though we stayed past 10pm just chatting and drinking wine. The scallops were cooked perfectly, and the beet salad was yummy.  Good wine selection too.\\n\\nThe not so good - while nice, the service was still a little stumble-y.  The server wasn't exactly sure where the oysters that day came from (other than knowing East Coast/West Coast).  Mind you, this isn't the usual douchey, \\"where exactly was this chicken raised? Free range? Heritage?\\" Portlandia b.s. The breed of oyster actually lets you know what they're going to taste like.  A Fanny Bay tastes waaaay different from a Malpeque, that tastes way different from a Kumamoto.  And the Optimist has raw oysters as a specialty, right?  Its prices reflect that ($2.50 - $3/per oyster), so the servers should know the daily selection verbatim. When the oysters arrived, they were just plunked down by a runner.  No explanation which side was from which coast, and we had to flag someone down so they could tell us.  We were also 1 short of a dozen (although once we brought it to their attention, they brought out four more, which was very nice of them).  The oxtail reduction next to the scallops--while the sauce itself was nice--it had dry, tough pieces of oxtail.  I've cooked oxtail before, so I know the reduction needed to just cook a touch longer to loosen the tendon of the meat. The gumbo was a little too salty, but the spice was nice.

It is also a plus that is is sold fresh and not packaged like what you find in supermarket, which tends to contain more fat in the sausages. The roast meats are also fresh and delicious and reasonably priced and equally delicious as from the more expensive stores in the suburbs especially when their daily specials are advertised. The bad side is that the store is not particularly clean as they leave all doors open, which means all insects can enter the store and a big no no for vegetarians or people who are trying to watch their weight.

Being alone, I quickly snagged a seat at the bar/counter and it was not long before a steaming bowl of spicy, umami goodness was placed before me.

I ordered a gin martini and she suggested Farmers Gin, which is organic. It was so different and unique - I can't wait to find it locally to have at home.\\n\\nWe started with the mussels, which were divine. Green curry and with a nice little piece of toast to enjoy the curry sauce. Then, we had our entrees... the most perfect fish preparations.

However, this is primarily because I tend to also check out a restaurant before I eat there.  Yet I still have my share of subpar experiences, and will rate accordingly.\\n\\nToday's lunch was suggested by a local attendee at the workshop I'm at.  He was returning the favor for a place I discovered yesterday that he had not yet tried.  I will have to thank him.  Cadillac Cafe is a breakfast/lunch/brunch place.  It has one of those \\"modern retro\\" interiors, and was busy & quite loud - since there waas patron noise mixed in with unblocked kitchen noise.  But that wasn't a negative.  It really just added to the feel of the place, and raised the energy in there\\n\\n My co-workshoper said Cadillac Cafe had a lot of good food, including their signature French toast; but he suggested getting the Bunkhouse Vittles, for a variety of foods along with one slice of their French toast. Now, while I was there at lunchtime, I do like breakfast for lunch at times.  Plus, the Bunkhouse Vittles consisted of chicken apple sausage, Cadillac potatoes (really just seasoned American potatoes), two eggs (which I ordered over hard), and a slice of that French toast.  The eggs and potatoes were fine.  The chicken apple sausage was well prepared.  It was good and grilled up with a light, yet savory, flavor.  The topper, though, was the French toast.  It's described on the menu as hazelnut, French custard toast.  That by itself sounds pretty yummy.  The hazelnut adds a real shot of flavor, and the custard amps up the richness.  Then it is also topped with a generous serving of chopped peanuts and a pool of butter.  Top it with some of the real maple syrup they provide, and ohhhh it was good!  In fact, it was so rich that I was glad to have a single slice that I could cut with the sausage and potatoes in between bites.

As with most places nowadays, Smashburger is best described as \\"fast-casual\\" meaning that you order your meal at the register and then sit down to wait a few minutes for someone to bring out your food. In this respect, Smashburger really should change their name to Fastburger. Our burgers arrived at our table literally within five minutes of paying for them. \\n\\nMoreover, the quality of the food at Smashburger is excellent. I decided to go with a chicken burger and a side of smash fries (ordered separately), and my burger was moist yet healthful with a multigrain bun, while my shoestring fries were crisp and delicious. I honestly hate shoestring french fries, but somehow the cut didn't even matter to me because the fries were so fresh. Also, I got a chance to try out the nutter butter milkshake and it did not disappoint! \\n\\nOverall, I loved my first experience at Smashburger.

For those of us who live in the community, the fact that Frasca (Locale's parent company/restaurant) would open a Pizzeria, for us common folk who don't want to drop $$$$ for great food, seemed like excellent news. Frasca has come to be one of THE restaurants to experience in Boulder, and as such has an outstanding reputation. \\n\\nSo why can't they succeed at making edible, delicious pizzas right next door? Not to knock anyone's skills (or palate) but I have a hard time believing that the \\"it\\" thing in Italian pizza is this: bland sauce, soggy, uncooked crust, and overpriced toppings. \\nCase in point, I ordered the funghi pizza first (first, yes, because I in fact sent it back). When they laid the pizza down in front of me I literally watched the water pool into the center of the pie. Not oil, not grease, WATER. So I think to myself, \\"maybe this is hip and happening in the food world, I will give soupy pizza a go\\". Had the flavor been outstanding, I would've asked the server for a spoon and gone on to culinary bliss, but, alas, it was salty water, soggy shrooms, and limp crust. I can't even do that at home ON PURPOSE, so 5 stars on being able to produce something that was an enigma of culinary failure.\\n\\nIn their defense, the server did replace it with a Margherita, which, while still soggy and limp, did have some flavor to it. I can also appreciate the locality and freshness of the ingredients used, but I can't stress enough that local and organic ingredients DO NOT EQUAL good tasting food. As of late Boulder's obsession with the farm to table movement has produced a bevy of fresh, vibrant, local BLAND offerings. Come on chef's, you still have to DO SOMETHING with the ingredients. Or, well, you don't, but don't expect me to come drop $14 on a bland, soggy pizza. \\n\\nTry it, maybe you'll like it, but I won't be making a repeat appearance at this Locale."},{"name":"Inka Chicken","address":"1707 Wells Branch Pkwy","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"BEST CHICKEN EVER!! \\nMy husband and I each got a 1/4 chicken with yuca and plantain fries(didn't post a picture as there are plenty posted here already).

Their menu items include \\"cock rings\\" for god sake... stop taking yourself and this place too seriously. \\n\\nIn short, Voodoo Doughnut is a high-energy, 24/7 machine of sugary awesomeness. The music is loud, the staff can be bitchy, and the atmosphere is awesome. Yes, there are homeless folks outside (it's their city too), and they are non-threatening, and will strike up polite conversation. \\n\\nThe line was to the door, but very fast (thanks to aforementioned aggressive staff). I had the Ol' Dirty Bastard. I'm not 100% sure of all the ingredients, but my best guess would be unicorn sweat, laughter of children, and Oreos. The first bite nearly sent me in to sugar shock. By the third bite, I had full blown Diabetes. Perfect. It was cold and rainy outside, and we stood in the middle of the shop eating our doughnuts, senselessly bumping into people, listening to the music, and watching what seems like production chaos to the untrained eye, but is really a well-oiled machine of happiness. \\n\\nIt's not that my standards are lower than some of the other petty reviews. To the contrary, they likely much higher, but I get what's going on here. Like me, you may be skeptical because of the insane amount of press Voodoo Doughnut has received.

Cocktails: excellent, although they had run out of the ingredients for the \\"Summer Spritzer\\" and had to make a substitute using Cocci Americano.  The substitute was great.  Moving on to the food, in my opinion the deconstructed deviled eggs were not a success -- there is something about mashing the flavors together with the yolk that cannot be substituted for by pouring a sauce over a hard-boiled egg.  The Boston Brown Bread was too sweet for my taste -- OK to eat on its own, but not what I want to clear my palate between a cocktail and wine, or between oysters and wine. Liked the oysters and the scallop ceviche. The head-on shrimp and the steak tartare appetizers were the best things we had. The lamb ribs were good, but lukewarm and in my opinion over-sugared.  (Too much sugar was a bit of a theme for me.) The special sweet potato with grilled okra sauce was amazing. So was the peach pie with bacon bits.  Service was friendly but spotty, we were ignored for a crucial time during our meal which was especially annoying since my friend was served an ice-cold red wine (no, not the kind of red wine you can drink cold) and we couldn't get the waitress's attention for ~20 minutes.  On the good side, once she saw the condensation on the outside of the wine glass, she replaced the cold wine with wine from a warmer bottle with no charge. \\n\\nSo overall -- mixed.  I'm a bit surprised, mostly it seems like a highly classy place but then they make odd mistakes with flavor and service.

Sorry, we're from Chicago, but those were the only two things we even knew about Oregon in general. So when we got to Portland, the number one thing on the list was Voodoo Doughnuts. We knew it was a tourist trap going in, but I didn't expect it to be this bad.\\n\\nThe line was not tremendously long, but we did have to wait in the rain for about five minutes before we were allowed inside. That's understandable- it's hyped up, and there has to be some wait even on an early Sunday morning. When we got in, we saw what we had seen on the shows before: the decor, the atmosphere, and, of course, the doughnuts.\\n\\nThe service was nice, and we got out quickly despite the immense wait we saw. We didn't really know what we wanted, but we picked whatever we saw that looked appealing to some groggy travelers.\\n\\nFast forward to the hotel, where we started eating the donuts. The first thing that overcame our senses was staleness and loads of sugar. The shop is open 24/7, so the donuts were clearly about a couple days old. They had the texture of about a day old munchkin from Dunkin Donuts, not so hard as a rock but just hard enough to make anyone be like \\"woah, this is stale.\\" The sugar was another big problem. One donut alone probably had all of the sugar recommended in a daily diet. The recipe must have called for one bag of sugar per donut. To top it off, the donuts gave me E-Coli, not a fun thing to have when you're driving down the 101 South through the redwoods.\\n\\nSo, I guess it boils down to \\"Would I come back if I was back in Portland?\\" And that answer is a definite no. Maybe I'm being a bit biased because of the fact I got sick from the batch of donuts I ate, but the donuts were NOT worth the hype or money spent on them. Their aesthetic is pleasing, and I can see why it got popular, but something went drastically wrong when we were there.

I had to see what all the rage was about.  I went on a Sunday late morning and there was a line snaking along the front.  After standing and waiting in line for about 20 min watching customer after customer come out of the store with a large pink box of doughnuts and smiles on their face I realized the signs that read CASH ONLY.  Seriously?  This was a surprise to many as they came close to entering.  Luckily there is an ATM, so you can eat the bank fees on top of your treats.  \\n\\nOnce inside, the cashier was simply not in the mood to be there. The doughnut options are spinning in displays but nothing to indicate what they are exactly.  Luckily there were a few floating menus out front, none of which made it to me, and an app online to read the selections beforehand.  The list is long, the options are so bizarre they require serious study, and frankly my memory is not THAT good.  I refuse to pay ATM fees and limited my order to whatever cash we had on hand the few doughnut options I was able to remember.  The price tag is appropriate for an over-sized popular novelty at the level of your run of the mill tourist trap.  \\n\\nThe result, good doughnut.  Seemed fresh from that morning, they were nice and doughy inside.  I'm glad I came, but I don't need to return.  I come to Portland often and this will not be a regular stop.  The parts that stuck with me the most: long line; poor customer service; high price tag; and a business more interested in avoiding taxes than offering the convenience of accepting credit cards to their customers.

It's a good mix and will keep you full for at least more than 8 minutes if you're trying to hold yourself over until your next meal.

I've spent all of last night trying do decide how to rate them. Without being able to give them half stars officially, do I feel they're closer to 3 or 4 stars? It's a tough call.\\n\\nWe first heard about this place years ago, but being clear on the other side of town, circumstances and laziness never allowed us to get down there. This week, we made it our mission to make the trek over.\\n\\nWe had read plenty of reviews about this place before heading in, so we were expecting and prepared for it to be a dive - albeit a friendly and quality one. \\n\\nWalking in, we spotted a sign that said \\"please wait to be seated\\", but it had been taken off its stand and left on a table next to the entrance. We paused at the entrance for a moment - some employees looked at us and then looked away. We sat ourselves at the oyster bar. A short while later, we saw some other people come in, and the manager showed them to a table, so now I'm not sure if we were supposed to seat ourselves or not. No harm, no foul, I guess.\\n\\nOur waitress/shucker (which I shall from henceforth call \\"shucktress\\" because it sounds cool) came over and sort of introduced herself. She was friendly, but seemed bored. She had been called in on her night off because they thought they would be busy and it wasn't. She gave us a few minutes to go over the menu. \\n\\nThe menu is small and understandably focused on seafood. Besides buckets of oysters or shrimp, there are a few bar style appetizers (jalapeno poppers and the like). If you don't like seafood, there are two chicken dishes to select from. Point is - if you don't like seafood, you probably shouldn't be here eating dinner.\\n\\nWe really wanted some drinks with our dinner, but they only served a couple of wines and beers here. This wasn't a huge surprise, but it was a bit of a disappointment. The beer selection may be ok for a lot of people - Bud, Miller, Killians, Corona - and a few others of the same quality (and lack thereof) - but there was nothing that we liked.\\n\\nWe knew we had to start with a bucket of oysters, and we'd go from there. Our shucktress came back with a huge bucket of oysters a minute or so after taking our order and got down to work. She made small talk while she worked, but was not super friendly - again seeming bored. Maybe we're just not interesting. I watched another shuckster (see, shucksters are the male versions of a shuckstress) interacting with his customers and he was friendly and chatty.\\n\\nWith few exceptions, the oysters were huge and meaty. They all tasted super fresh. For having only been a shuckstress since April, she was excellent at shucking - popping them open and placing them in front of us faster than we could gulp them down.\\n\\nAfter finishing our bucket, she asked if we wanted another. We decided that we wanted some cooked food. We love oysters, but they're not exactly the most filling things in the world. We asked if she had any recommendations. She said that she didn't like seafood - but that she had had the fried fish one time and it was pretty good. She conceded that she had covered it in just about every condiment available though - and at that point, anything would have tasted good to her.\\n\\nWith little guidance, we ordered some fried clams and the stuffed flounder. The clams came out pretty quickly, but the flounder was another matter. Apparently, the cooks couldn't find the flounder, and our shuckstress had to pull it out of the freezer and defrost it. Instead of both dishes coming out at the same time, the clams came out while the fish was being defrosted so it could be cooked. \\n\\nThe clams were tasty, but nothing special. They seemed a little overpriced for what you got: a plate of fried clams, a portion of unseasoned fries and a cup of very tasteless - what I think was supposed to be cole slaw. I was almost done with the clams by the time the flounder came out.\\n\\nUnfortunately, something came up and my wife only got to eat one bite (which she said was good) before having to go outside. While she dealt with that, I searched for our shuckstress. I finally spotted her on the far end of the bar in the next room - shucking someone else's oysters. That also explained why I had been sitting for 5 minutes with an empty cup of water. \\n\\nFor some reason each shuckster/shuckstress seems to ignore you if you're not being served by them. Even though I was looking around anxiously, all of the other employees just ignored me. \\n\\nBefore leaving, my wife wanted to use the bathroom - and came back out as quickly as she went in. She said it looked like the bathroom inside a trailer and that the door did not lock shut - describing it as \\"skanky\\".\\n\\nI really wanted to love Lee and Rick's, I just couldn't. The food aside from the oysters and shrimp just seems overpriced and unremarkable and the service has some serious shortcomings. If we had ended our experience with the oysters, I probably would have given them four or even five stars."},{"name":"Bouldin Creek Cafe","address":"1900 S 1st St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"I don't tend to post reviews unless I have something negative to say.. kind of like I have nothing to say about my (good) love life unless something goes awry.

(FWIW, the not-your-average house salad--with sundried tomato and gorgonzola--is quite good.)\\n\\nIt's a great place to grab an inexpensive, quasi-healthy meal, but as others have said--not if you're on a time limit. Also, you have to be into garlic if you eat here (fortunately, we are).\\n\\nSo, overall: Two stars for the service and three for the food. But one more gripe: Recently, they lowered the price on their add-on proteins for the salads. Now, chicken, shrimp, salmon, or steak tips are $2.95.

And the pours were pretty heavy. I enjoyed all of them. Note, they no longer have the 6 glasses of wine taster for $12 (too good to be true!). So I got a specialty cocktail instead.\\n\\nWe got a fish taco and cheeseburger slider to snack on. The grilled fish taco had fresh mango salsa on top. The slider had a green ranch-like sauce, which sets it apart from your average slider and makes it less dry. Prices are cheap, considering this is a tourist location.

This thai place had come up on numerous times when we were yelping while at vendor meetings in the area but we always seemed to choose something else.  When we left bloomie's we were very hungry. It was good friday, we hadn't had much to eat (on purpose per rules!), and my husband wanted food quick. So what was good flavorful food, that was healthy, not too expensive and seafood based? Thai. \\n\\nWe ordered 2 sets of spring rolls quickly. They had shrimp and were pretty tasty although I would have appreciated more herbs. The dipping sauce was standard sweet thai chili but the addition of chopped peanuts was nice. I would try other appetizers on a return visit for not only variety but also they didn't blow me away to were I would ignore their long list of yummy sounding apps.\\n\\nWe ordered a dish each, my husband shrimp pad thai and I ordered Soft Shell crab green curry. The soft shell crab usually comes with a choice of a ginger sauce or a yellow curry but I really love green curry and asked if they could do it. They granted my request. I was in heaven. The soft shell crab was perfectly fried, not too heavy but enough to get a good crisp. The green curry sauce was great and the perfect heat for my \\"mild\\" request (which would be like medium hot wings level of hot as curry has natural spices.) It was a perfect dish. I would gladly return any day for it. MY only fault with my dish, is that the rice was a little sticky/gummy. Not inedible by any means but a little underwhelming for a place who should be doing rice on point and lots of it all day long.\\n\\nMy husbands pad thai was very good. It wasn't as flavorful as other pad thai we have had. The shrimps were large and well cooked. He ordered it medium and it was a hair spicy but what made the spicy hard was that they seemed to use ground pepper poweder instead of the flakes or paste we are used to. At least with the flakes you can pick out some of the seeds or flakes and \\"cool\\" down a bite now and again. On a return we would order it mild and ask for the spice caddy. \\n\\nPrices were reasonable considering it was dinner and we had seafood entrees.

My Cuban sandwich was dry and the bread it came with was way over buttered. I tried my husband's breakfast burito and it was OK.

However, we live here, and had a rare opportunity to grab some nosh and a brew before picking up our daughter from track practice at Grant HS. \\n\\nApparently, nothing is open until 4pm on a Thursday. The original plan was to play some shuffleboard in the Boiler Room, and have a beer. Nope. The more $hitty part is that we decided to wait it out by having a beer in Courtyard. The ratio of servers (that I see) and customers, is almost even, yet even with being seen upon our entry, and several \\"look overs\\" the booth at the trio behind the bar chatting it up, drinking pop, did not get their attention. \\nI finally, (after 18 min.) got up and asked if we could get some food and beer. \\n\\nDamnit Mc's! Get it together. You're a \\nP-town staple that is losing locals because of this inadequate service ALL the time. Or, do WE not matter? \\n\\nBtw, the only reason I'm giving two stars is because the Equinox IPA was stellar.\\n\\nUPDATE:\\nWOW!

We're only here to visit, so I can't compare it to anything else in Portland.\\n\\nMy reference standard for Thai Food is pretty much based on Bangkok Cuisine in Fremont, CA (an offshoot of the equally good Amarin Thai in Mountain View) and various places in Berkeley, CA.\\n\\nSo we started with the Tom Kah soup. Not bad, a bit more sour than I like. But really the flavor is not right. If you want to know what Tom Kah should taste like, open a can of Amy's Organics Tom Kah Phak Thai Coconut soup. (After you have had the canned version and recognize the flavor, you will really appreciate well-done fresh soup.)\\n\\nThe drinks were a mixed bag too. I had Oliang (Thai Iced Coffee without the milk, you have to specifically ask for it) which was excellent. My SO went with Lemonade, which tasted like Country Time. We were hoping this would be something involving real lemons, especially since I've had some really great lime juice drinks in Thailand. There was a lemon slice floating in the lemonade, but that's as close as we got to real citrus on that one. So one thumbs up and one down.\\n\\nFor entrees we had the Asparagus Lovers (with Tofu) and Cashew Chicken. The asparagus originally came with chicken instead of Tofu, so we had to send it back. After we got all that straightened out, the food was actually pretty decent. The cashew chicken again wasn't quite what I was expecting. It wasn't bad, just not right. The ingredients were of good quality as far as I could tell. The asparagus was good, but not great (I had some great asparagus the night before, so i could really tell the difference). It was actually the most authentic Thai tasting dish, but it's basically just veggies stir-fried in Oyster sauce and garlic. The tofu was firm (which I like), but only mediocre in taste.\\n\\nThere was no Masaman Curry on the menu, which is a pity, since I tend to use that as one of the standard dishes by which I rate a Thai restaurant. (It is difficult to get right. I've been making it for 20 years and I'm still tweaking the recipe every time I cook.)\\n\\nKudos for offering brown rice, even though it was not on the menu. They also have a decent selection for vegetarians and vegans.\\n\\nThe ambiance was nice. We were there early for dinner and it was still light out. There is lots of glass to let daylight in. I imagine it would be pretty nice after dark as well.\\nLots of people with children, but it wasn't noisy. \\n\\nThere were five parking spots out front (plus one handicapped spot). Parking in the neighbourhood wasn't too difficult, but I could imagine we would have had trouble if we had been there at a more popular time.\\n\\nBottom line:\\nQuality food.\\nPrices on the high side, but about commensurate with the quality and quantity of food.\\nAuthenticity was low to medium.\\nVegetarian/Vegan friendly.\\n \\nDecent food, but if you're craving genuine Thai, you're probably better off elsewhere."},{"name":"Two Urban Licks","address":"820 Ralph McGill Blvd NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"MMe & mi side bishh went to Two urbun licks on valentines day we were greeted by expensive ass drinks but they were good so i couldnt complain\\nWe wur in this janke ass chair with 2 chain$z and were seated by some ratchet trick and i was bout to cut sum1\\\\VCALImari TWO sweet"},{"name":"Pizzeria Locale","address":"1730 Pearl St","city":"Boulder","stars":"4","text":"Burnt tasting pizza, but otherwise very good.  \\nWe has to send back both of the pizzas we ordered because they tasted burnt.

For dessert we had the Sundae which was amazing, but to be fair I have never had a Sundae I didn't like.\\n\\nOur waitress was very attentive and well versed in the menu: she informed us of the popular dishes as well as her personal favorites.\\n\\nIt is important to note that this restaurant is definitely pricier than your average Atlanta restaurant but not quite \\"New York\\" prices."},{"name":"Armando's Pizzeria","address":"463 W New England Ave","city":"Winter Park","stars":"3.5","text":"Worst restaurant in the entire world absolutely disgusting from service to the garbage food.

In fact, this is the 1st restaurant I tired when I moved here based on the recommendation of a Westerville police officer.  The restaurant is family owned and the family still works in the restaurant every day.  When I first started coming here, Pasquale's was tucked back in an alley off of State St and was a little hard to find. Despite being hard to find - it was always busy.  A few years ago, they were able to expand into a storefront that gives them visibility on State Street.\\n\\nThe restaurant is definitely NOT fancy and has the ambiance of an old Italian restaurant.  The food has a homemade quality to it and the portions are huge. I'm a big eater and I can't finish a portion of the lasagna - I always need a \\"to go\\" box.  Most meals come with a salad and garlic twisty bread with a dipping sauce.  Over the years, I tried almost everything on the menu and have never been disappointed. All of the pasta dishes are great and they also have some excellent sandwiches like their Italian sub sandwich.  The chicken and veal Parmesan entrees are exceptionally  good.\\n\\nThe house salads are very good - especially with the house Italian dressing.  Salads are made with fresh cut romaine, black olive slices, Pepperonis, banana pepper rings, and a bit of shredded cheese - a nice size portion.  The salad and the house dressing are very good.  They also have packets of other  dressings (blue cheese, ranch, lite Italian, etc.) but the house dressing is the best.\\n\\nOverall, the service is generally good but sometimes can be a little hit or miss.

Thankfully, this place is only 5 minutes from my hotel in Lexington!\\n\\nThis place is humongous, open concept, and felt quite futuristic. Not surprisingly the place has only been open for a year, hence why everything felt so modern. Immediately when we looked at the menu, the tomahawk steak attracted us. Since it was 40oz, I decided to share it with my mom and dad, and we ordered the seafood tower and Boston clam chowder as starters.\\n\\nThe clam chowder was easily the best I've ever had, and I was a little surprised it's in none of the best clam chowder lists in Boston. If there's places where the clam chowder is even better, I wouldn't even hesitate to try it. The seafood tower was also very good, with a good sampling of raw oysters, clams, shrimps, and lobster that all tasted delicious. Finally, the tomahawk steak was grilled perfectly medium, just as requested. In fact, when the tomahawk steak arrived, there's an indication on the platter that the steak is cooked medium. Despite its thickness, it was grilled perfectly to the point we didn't need to send it back. Well worth the $85 to share if you ask me.\\n\\nService is excellent the entire way; the waiter even apologized to us at first because the table we had was not balanced, but honestly that wasn't necessary.

After a good workout I was pretty famished and biryani is all I had on my mind. One of my buddies was down to meet up there around 8:30 pm and thought that would work after some pickup ball.\\n\\nHe got there a bit early and went ahead and ordered the Chicken Biryani to start. While I would have preferred to sample the goat or lamb biryani, I was very surprised by the flavor of the biryani. The bone in chicken pieces were quite succulent and there was a great buttery component to the actual rice. I'm assuming they are using long grain basmati rice. I couldn't get enough of some of the slightly fatty yet tender pieces in the biryani and I'm not much of a Chicken biryani fan. Maybe it was due to extreme hunger but that generally doesn't sway my palate regardless of how famished I am. \\n\\nMy friend also ordered samosas and said the veggie samosa was pretty good with a proper shell. I'm assuming not the Chinese wrapped samosas, authentic chew and crunch factor.\\n\\nI decided to ask the gentlemen taking our order what gravy he would recommend today and  was suggested the beef curry. This was pretty good as well, not overly oily or rich but great shining through of the cloves and \\"vagaar\\" for the base of the gravy. Beef was slightly overcooked but nothing proper hand usage to physically break down the meat didn't solve. Pairing this with the chicken biryani created a great flavor profile.\\n\\nThe last item I ordered was the Muglai paratha and it was purely delectable. I haven't had this dish in Atlanta since I've moved here. JUST GET THIS ITEM!!! It makes the Malaysian curry puffs seem like an evolutionary inferior product. \\n\\nOverall, the 4 items I tried were good with the Muglai paratha stealing the show.

I'm sad to say I had mixed feelings about this place. The margherita pizza was really very good- the dough was perfectly cooked with a sourness that I enjoyed, although believe that could have been toned down a bit. The disappointment came from the zucca picante. It might be my fault because I'm a vegetarian who cannot resist anything with pumpkin, so I ordered this without the speck without considering that the speck probably provided a significant saltiness to the pizza. Without it, the pizza was one of the blandest things I've ever tasted. I do recognize that the speck would have provided some balance, but there should have been SOME flavor in there somewhere.   The prices are also pretty outrageous...as in more expensive than NYC for a smaller portion, which is pretty hard to believe.

My friend and I are both vegetarians and there were plenty of options for us, but you have to ask about them - they aren't indicated on the menu at all. There are five ramen options that can be made vegetarian. I got the Karamiso (spicy) ramen, which was delicious, and there is additional hot pepper at the table if you want to make your dish spicier. The broth was very flavorful - not a guarantee with vegetarian noodle soups, as many vegetarian pho eaters can attest. Our server said that you get a free addition (e.g. egg) with a vegetarian soup (I assume to make up for the fact that it's the same price but you aren't getting any meat?). The soy sauce egg was nicely soft-cooked and definitely worth getting. Get the large size; you won't be sorry. It's normal-portion-sized. \\n\\nNegatives: It's loud - the noise reflects off the concrete interior, lots of scraping chairs that echo, and the servers occasionally shout something to each other - a certain phrase I couldn't make out. I'm not sure why they do it or what it signifies but it was jarring and interrupted our conversations. The noise was the biggest negative, but there are also some minor ones: no alcohol, tight quarters. There was a 30 minute wait at 6pm on a Thursday.\\n\\nThat said, though, it was really good ramen and I'm glad to know about this place now.

The tapas come in 3 different sizes: small, medium and large. Everything we ordered was in a small and the portions serve 1-2 people. The perfect size to get multiple plates to try a little of everything. My bf and I got 6 small tapas and 1 entree.\\n\\nWe ordered the following:\\n\\nBeef Empanadas: These were amazing! Flaky, buttery pastry filled with a delicious savory beef and olive filling, I would get a medium order of these next time.\\n\\nBeef Hearts: These were marinated, grilled and served like kebabs. Very flavorful but a little on the chewy side. \\n\\nSeafood Wontons: Very tasty. The wontons were crispy and had a mixed seafood filling and was served with a sweet and sour type of sauce.\\n\\nGrilled Diver Scallop: This was probably my favorite tapas. A large grilled diver scallop in a tamarind sauce with fried onions on top. Freaking delicious!! The scallop was perfectly cooked and that sauce was just soooo luscious and flavorful. I highly suggest getting a medium \\n\\nMixta Nikkei: This was okay. Layers of crab, avocado, and potato with tempura prawn on top.

Took the quick elevator ride and checked in for our reservation and was promptly seated. My boyfriend and I both started with the spicy lobster soup which was delicious! I order the Fra Diavolo for my main meal. It was alright, pretty average - I wish it came with a white sauce or was oil based as opposed to the red sauce. My boyfriend had the strip steak which was pretty bland he said, there was really no flavor at all. We both had dessert, him the chocolate cake and I had the pear tart. I wasn't a fan of the tart personally but he absolutely loved the chocolate cake. Overall it wasn't a bad experience.

They also serve boozy shakes that I would be interested in trying in the future. For 2.99 extra you can make your meal a combo meal that comes with fries of your liking and a shake which is a great deal! I made my own veggie burger and didn't get anything extra on it other than the normal toppings but made it a combo by getting sweet potato fries and oreo milkshake (I know great way to start the new year). You can get two patties on your burger if you need more protein but one is still satisfying. My burger had lettuce, tomatoes, cheese, jalape√±os, onions, and chipotle ranch dressing as condiments and it tasted amazing even though I didn't add anything fancy to it. If you don't want to customize your own burger, you can choose from one of the ample choices on the menu and each are uniquely crafted. \\nMy sister ordered a salad with a veggie patty in it and she was able to make two meals out of it. This is a great option for anyone that doesn't like to load up on carbs the way I do. She really enjoyed her salad and it was still good the next day because the avocados had remained fresh! My brother in law got chocolate peanut butter shake and that was amazing as well-it could very well turn into a guilty pleasure. The sweet potato fries were seasoned in a way I had never tried before and they are possibly the best sweet potato fries I've ever had. Another reason to come here is for the special grind house sauce. It's worth trying and goes well with the sweet potato fries.

So I was understandably disappointed when I came here with my family on a Saturday for lunch. The place was mostly empty, which should have been a sign, but we were told when we sat down that the kids hamburger lunch was not available due to there being no more hamburger. Had the place been packed, I would have understood this, but given that no one was there it seemed odd. We ordered the kids pizza and the kids grilled chicken, and my wife had the crab salad and I had the crab cakes. My crab cakes were served on an appetizer sized plate, even though it was labeled an entree, and the crab cakes were solid like hockey pucks. Consisting more of bread and seasoning than lump crab, they were accompanied by a miniature green salad that tasted like lemon Pledge because it was covered in a sharp dressing. My wife's crab salad was even worse. The menu claimed it was dressed in olive oil and lemon, but it barely had any flavor. The tiny shreds of crab, mixed with mushy avocado and wilted greens, tasted like nothing but ingredients on a plate. There was no sense that anyone in the kitchen had any flair for flavor or putting the barest effort into the meal. Even my daughter's chicken tasted like it had no seasoning, and was just a chicken breast cooked on a grill. My son did like the pizza, but it was the size of a cheesy pita bread. \\n\\nAll told, the meal came to $60 before the tip. When asked by the waitress how the meal was, my wife told her that the salad wasn't very good. Rather than offer an alternative, she offered to bring buttermilk dressing and acted like we had a problem for not liking the food. No bread was brought to the table while we waited 20 minutes for this mess. I will never eat at Palmers again, and I will tell everyone I know to not eat there. I hope that they are paying attention to these reviews so they fire their \\"chefs\\" and hire someone with talent. I can say that had we eaten at Panera it would have been a more satisfying meal (and I appreciate fine dining as someone who checks out 4 star restaurants on a regular basis). Go to Shubies in Marblehead for a better kid-friendly experience. I give Palmers six months.

Their attitude and willingness to accommodate really enhances the visit. I was there Thursday the 16th of April, with my Granddaughter and her friend from MN. First visit for both of them and they loved the building, the cornbread, the clam chowder, salad and the ambiance. I loved receiving the recipe for the clam chowder and the cornbread!

Hush puppies were very salty but also had powdered sugar on them. Very interesting.  The peppers were good, not too spicy. While the sides were good I didn't really see anything that I thought paired well with the fish. We then split key lime pie and chocolate desserts, which were tasty and big enough to share. Very nice dining experience. Favorites were the starters. All the entree fish were cooked perfectly and were extremely fresh.

The food was really good. The ambiance was really bad. The service fell somewhere in between.\\n\\nThe place is too small for its popularity. There are tables in places no one should be expected to eat. And generally, I have found, that if a party of two with gray hair shows up, you can bet you are going to be given that table. That is how this dinner started. We only waited 10 minutes for seating, a party of 8 left and they broke up the tables and assigned them out to the parties waiting. So we had no choice. Squashed between the water service prep counter and the passageway to the back and the counter seating in the back, we were nearly dumped on multiple times while servers were bumping each other and dumping water and dropping plates and stacking things inches from my elbow and face. Plus there was no ventilation and we left there just reeking from the oven smells. I generally have no problem with loud restaurants. In all of Boulder's trendy, busy places this is the first time I will comment on the noise. It wasn't so much the volume but the commotion. Music competing with loud conversations, and all the banging and dropping and slamming of stuff. Just  too much.\\n\\nThe servers were friendly and professional but ignored us most of the time. The place was busy but refilling water was done with such aggression that I thought there would be a major spill any time. We waited for our pizza course for about a half hour. They were preparing to-go orders in great piles just behind my husband. The oven is small, and making us wait for our table service while about a dozen to-go pizzas got done seems greatly unfair. Again, the place is too small and they should set up a separate to-go division with its own oven and staff..\\n\\nThe food, however, was excellent. So were the drinks. One of the better proseccos I have had recently and my husband like his beer. We had the arugula salad, really fresh greens, lots of parmesan shavings, perfect dressing in both flavor and volume. We had the pork meatballs with walnut pesto and we loved them. Hot, moist, lots of flavor, creative pesto. We had the funghi pizza and it was definitely large enough for two to share. Balance of cheeses (great combo) and mushrooms (including some rich porcinis) was better than most versions I have eaten. My husband had the budino for dessert and he loved it. I tasted it, but not being a great pudding fan, I can't evaluate it. I had the lemon meringue tart and it was perfect. Great crust, an appropriate balance of a short layer of meringue, nicely browned with a perky but not too tart lemon curd.\\n\\nSo will I go back? Last night I said no, I left more unhappy than happy. Today, I think I will give them another chance, go at a  different time and day and demand a decent table. The food was really good.\\n\\nYelp - aren't you glad I did not write a review on the spot on my iPhone? \\nAnd Locale- your ambiance is fixable and please rent another space for your to-go business."},{"name":"Andina Restaurant","address":"1314 NW Glisan St","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"One of my favorite restaurants in Portland!

Earth, land and sea, together as one.\\n\\nBeef tartare with raw egg. Bright red beef is topped with a house made mayonnaise sauce whipped with pickles, scallion, pepper and tarragon. A luscious yellow yolk floats on top. The finely chopped beef is spread thinly across a large plate as opposed to the traditional tall compact arrangement. Crisp potato chips are served to help scoop this rich meat.\\n\\nPork meatballs in gravy with shredded parmesan would put any respectable red sauce joint on alert. Tender and flavorful, the meat absorbs the silky yet thick red sauce. A perfect dish for sharing.\\n\\nRoast pork shank - too sweet but amazingly tender meat. The highlights of lingonberry were simply too sweet. The unctuous and fatty pork was hit too much by the sweet and sugary berries. \\n\\nThe drinks are tremendous.

The waitress had difficulty with basic English, and it took forever to put in our order. We ordered several mezze (babaganoush, kibbe, olives) and I ordered a lamb dish for the entree.

I just don't understand why we can't seem to get it right. Just because we put a famous name on a restaurant with a previous owner that didn't conduct business properly the first time, doesn't equal success....just my opinion. \\n\\nI live in the area and have given this place a chance. First when it was Venue...epic fail...then when it was Vibe...epic fail and now as Scales 925...semi epic fail. I'm saying semi only because it's still open. I wanted to love this place and maybe my expectations were waaaaaay too high. \\n\\nI walked over to this restaurant for its grand opening, which I was later informed it was actually a \\"soft opening\\". However, the door men were very polite as well as the hostess. The hostess talked the food up and actually gave suggestions on things to try. I wish I would have gotten her name. Anyway, we sat down around 9pm at a booth on the second level of the dining area. We did want to watch the final NBA game, but of course the projector wasn't working on that side of the restaurant so everyone was forced to watch one screen. I couldn't blame them because we should have gotten there a little earlier, so I will take the blame for that. Next, our waitress never came over because she was new and very inexperienced. Therefore, another server came over and proceeded to take our drink order. I requested lemonade and they were out. Then I asked for strawberry lemonade and they were out of that too, so I asked what do you have?!?! The waiter said we make the lemonade fresh and we haven't made anymore for the day. Ok...in that case, I requested sweet tea. Next I ordered the catfish that he bragged that I had to try. To bad I never got to try it. \\n\\nWhich brings me to the ugly part of my visit. About 30 minutes after I ordered, the waiter stops by to refill drinks and says, \\"ma'am your food should be right out. I saw them plating your order\\". I replied, \\" ok...thank you\\". After I realized that an hour had gone by, I hunt down the waiter to ask where is my food. He seems shocked and says, \\"oh lord, you haven't gotten your food yet?\\". Uhmmmm...no, that's why I'm hunting you down and asking. After he goes back to the kitchen to check on my food, he comes to our table and says, \\" we are out of catfish and the kitchen is closed\\". ((Insert mouth on the floor emoji)) I replied, \\"huh?! What do you mean?!\\". He replied, \\"let me go get my manager\\". I replied, \\"that's the best thing you've said all night\\". His manager Steve comes to our table to give me this sad ass apology and brings on the excuses. Main excuse, \\"we really aren't suppose to be open today, but we apologize for not letting you know we were out of catfish\\". Really?! If you weren't suppose to be open today then DON'T OPEN. If you aren't going to do it right then wait. Plus, it's apparent that there is no communication between the mangers, the kitchen and the wait staff on what you don't have on the menu. So now, that I ordered my food over an hour ago, remind you when the kitchen was open, I proceeded to try and offer a solution. Main reason because I'm starving and should have ate at Mellow mushroom where I know the service is on point, but I digress. My solution was to bring me something to eat. Some sides, cornbread, greens, mac n cheese just something.  Of course, he brings me some tasteless Mac n cheese with some semi- warm cornbread. At this point I'm hungry and need something on my stomach, so I ate just enough then went to zaxbys after...thank God they are open late. Of course, he comes by to check on us and gives us a business card. Not a card for a complimentary meal, but to contact him if we need anything. \\n \\nOverall, I feel this whole situation could have been avoided with simple communication. One way, is when the waiter put in our order, the kitchen manager or manager should have let the waiter know that they were out of catfish. Then the waiter could have came back to me and asked if I wanted to order something else. My issue is, that shouldn't take an HOUR to figure out. I love seeing African American business prosper, however I feel maybe T.I needs to be more involved until the kinks are worked out. It's such a nice space with great rooftop views. Plus, he did a good job with the renovations. I'm not sure it's upscale though...well maybe their definition of upscale is different than mine. Either way, I wish them luck, however I will not be back for another experience....I'm over it."},{"name":"Rosie's Coffee Cafe","address":"2330 Sylvan Rd","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Great little find.

We picked some items, they were mostlycal7fornia roll disguised with little bit of garnish, and the rice in thr sushi was too hard, like it was old.  And it was kind of off putting when the hot halogen light was hitting little bit of raw fish that they did serve (also little bit fishy).  And thdy made sushi with canned tuna, another thing that cheapened the experience was that they had cheap choco pie(korean moon pie) in the wrapper charging $2 when you can go to the korean market for dimes.  Same with the packaged toasted laver (seaweed) sheets.  As we were getting ready to leave, I noticed that the table behind us (hispanic friends of our waitress) were given menu to order from the kitchen.  And actually other tables as well.

And we didn't want to do much in the way of getting food, so we decided to walk down the Little Italy.  We had coupons for free food too (which we then promptly forgot to use) so it was an easy choice.\\n\\nAt 7.30pm it was packed.  No seats available whatsoever.  We decided to wait around because we knew it couldn't be too long.  One of the waitresses was even more super helpful by finding a larger table with a couple chairs at the end and asking the people already eating there it we could steal the end.  \\n\\nAs much as I love the pizza here, I really had to get the spaghetti!  This is a family owned business and they still make all their food (including the spaghetti) onsite.  Their spaghetti isn't your typical spaghetti.  It is made from egg noodles that are thick and have so much flavor.  Homemade, thick tomato sauce that sticks to all the noodles and actually tastes like fresh tomatoes.  \\n\\nTheir salads are some of the best I've ever had.  It has a lot of dressing on it which I usually don't like, but this dressing isn't heavy at all so it works well.  The spaghetti dinner for 2 has enough spaghetti for about 4 meals, 2 salads and bread.  The spaghetti also has 2 giant, delicious meatballs.  Delish =)\\n\\nThis is not haute cuisine.   This is one of those places where your meal is served in a foil pan and plastic plates.  But what you will get is a nice meal where you feel like they're feeding their family.  The staff is friendly and amazing.  The other patrons are friendly and will be more than happy to say hello and pass you some napkins if you need them.  There's an oldstyle jukebox, arcade games, and if you're a gambler, keno and Ohio Lottery are played here.  \\n\\nYou'd never guess this place was good.

How can u ever go to east coast and not get a Maine lobster??? This restaurant is literally the oldest restaurant in America. It's in the heart of Boston. When you walk into the restaurant you will see the fresh oyster and clam bar and a guy standing there waiting to shuck your oysters for you. Then right in front of you is their tank with all the live Maine lobsters. \\n\\nI chose to sit in a booth and was ready to get my grub on! I started out with the seafood appetizer trio. 2 Cherrystone raw clams, 2 raw oysters and 2 shrimp cocktail. I never even knew you can eat a clam raw, but a friend told me I had to try it...so I got the sampler for $13.99. when the sampler came out...I was like that's it??? Where's the rest of it? For $13.99 they sure chose the smallest clams, oysters and shrimp that I've ever seen! Well...I was starving! So I tried the raw clams for the first time. It was a little too clammy for my taste! Onto the oysters. They were pretty small but very, very good!!! Very fresh and tasty! The shrimp cocktail I could of done without. You're better off getting half a dozen or a dozen oysters by itself. \\n\\nNext...I tried a cup of their clam chowder for $5.99. It was one if the better chowders that I had while I was there in Boston. Nice rich creamy flavor. Good amount of clams and potatoes. \\n\\nFinally...I got down to the Maine lobster. You can choose a medium sized lobster that was about a pound for $26.95 or the large lobster that was around 2 pounds. Both of them were market priced of course. You can choose to have it broiled or boiled. Apprently the broiled lobster dries it out a little while the boiled lobster retains the flavor more. So I got the Medium lobster boiled. It was sooo good. I wanted more!!! The lobster was cooked to perfection and was super sweet! You don't even really need the butter or the lemon, but it never hurts to add more flavor! Yummo! \\n\\nI think next time I will get the large lobster! Lol. Although this place is a little bit on the pricier side....it's still a must try for the experience. I would go definitely go back and sit at the oyster bar to pick my own oysters for them to shuck in front of me next time.\\n\\nOne recommendation for the restaurant is that it would of been better if I got to pick my own lobster and oysters.

The last time, I was here, I had the lobster fried rice, which was good but did not meet my high expectations. What blew me away last night was the Red Velvet dessert. Wow! I have never seen a red velvet dessert wedge that big. My tip is that 2 - 4 people can  share the dessert.\\n\\nAmbience: It is intimate in the inside and gloom-ish but sometimes, feels too squished.\\n\\nLocation: I give 2.5 because it is sometimes tough to find parking and valet is unreliably available. However, it is easily accessible.\\n\\nService: Arguably the best part of my experience both times that I have been  here.\\n\\n\\nOther: Towards the end of dinner - between finishing dessert and settling the bill, my dinner date and I noticed a roach crawling on the table. My date quickly killed the roach with the glass and then showed the waiter. The waiter was extremely apologetic and took 50% off our bill.\\n\\nFast forward to this morning, my stomach has been hurting terribly and I have had to visit the glorious place a.k.a the toilet with an unpleasant release. I am not allergic to anything. So, my money is on the doubt of the sanitary standards that Poor Calvin's holds for their dining environment and arguably, the kitchen area.\\n\\nIn summary, I would love to come back to Poor Calvin's because it is very close to mine but that roach!!!!!!

It's pricey ($21), but it comes with a super generous amount of lobster meat with a mountain of shoestring fries (can choose to substitute the fries with different side, but fries goes best with lobster rolls) . And those were the best shoestring fries I've had so far (it only got a soggy towards the end) and the dill on top was great. Their (house?) ketchup was also more on the vinegar-y side, and that helped with keeping things fresh as everything was getting kind of heavy. \\n\\nMy boyfriend got the shrimp burger  and substituted the side for CORN MILK HUSHPUPPIES - \\"beignet style,\\" cane syrup butter. The shrimp burger tasted good, but became too heavy towards the end and was a struggle to finish. We both really loved the taste of the corn milk hushpuppies - a little bit of sweet and savory - and the cane syrup butter has a nice taste, but the butter-iness of it was just too heavy for us to handle.  We'd prefer it to be regular maple syrup instead of this version.\\n\\nIn the end, I managed to finish the fries and we took out 4 hush puppies. We microwaved them at 50% power for 15 seconds and it was nice and warm. It went great with coffee and drizzled with maple syrup!\\n\\nOverall, the food tastes great and they are generous with their portions. Everything was so packed with flavor but it does get heavy after awhile.  This place would make for a great place for a romatic/special occasion or business meeting, just get the seafood salad instead to avoid the heaviness. Impeccable service as well.\\n\\nTip: Avoid sitting by the window during weekday lunches as the sunlight gets very bright and the waitstaff know about it too. There's a mini-golf to play too that we forgot to check out during our visit."},{"name":"Rossi Bar And Kitchen","address":"895 N High St","city":"Columbus","stars":"4","text":"Hands down, the best margherita pizza in Columbus.  \\n\\nThin crust with nice eggy/yeasty flavor, the dough is strong enough for a little bit of resistance when torn, and never soggy at the center.

Perfect with a glass (or bottle) of the sauvignon blanc.\\n\\nOne more thing: I'm in love with the art deco wall units behind the bar.

I didn't really like the sausage as being from Chicago, I'm used to Chicago style sausage rather than sliced sausage.  I would have gone just pepperoni for my pizza but I wanted to give this type of sausage just one more chance.  The slice that I picked up was perfect.  You have that idyllic orange grease just dripping off the edge. The crust had that wonderful feel and crisp that you're looking for.  The cheese was delightful as well as it just stretched.

When we exited the elevator on the 52nd floor, we were eyeballed by two young ladies (we presume hostesses) and an elderly man who we thought was the manager or maitre d'. No \\"welcome!\\" or \\"How are you today?!\\" but more like, \\"why are you here?\\" Granted, we were not dressed to the nines but we all looked presentable, and the restaurant was EMPTY, besides maybe two tables of diners and a couple at the bar in shorts and t-shirts. We ignored the rude welcome and decided to stay to enjoy the view (which was spectacular). Our waiter was a nice gentleman, but when he brought our drinks, 3 glasses of sparkling rose and a Guinness, he tilted the tray and 2 of the drinks fell over and spilled on me, my chair, and my bag. The four of us are chill and would never make a huge issue out of an accident, but I was barely even offered a napkin (in fact after using my own napkin to dry myself off and my chair and my purse, no one ever brought me a replacement) and the original napkin, soaked with rose and Guinness, was never taken from the table. It sat on our table the entire time we were there. Yes the waiter apologized, but the manager never came over to ask how we were or to apologize. Instead he stayed standing at the host stand. And it's not as though he didn't know it happened, because when the drinks fell it made quite a loud noise. We made the best of our time there (between the four of us, it is impossible to have a bad time) but the check came (no, our drinks were not comped, not even two of them, not even one!) and that was the end of it. We left over 20% gratuity because that's what we do. And when we left the establishment, the three clueless individuals that so rudely sat us didn't even raise their eyes at us to say thank you for coming. In this day and age, how on earth are they able to make the rent and payroll when their customer service skills are lacking?? The view can't be your only redeeming quality. Shame on you all. Needless to say, we will not go back, nor will we recommend you to anyone, in fact we will go out of our way to steer people away from you. \\n\\nVisited May 2017"},{"name":"Taqueria Portland","address":"820 SE 8th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Love this place!

Should check earlier about the portions for the sandwiches. This has been pointed in another review earlier. The wait staff did not ask if we needed any help or wished, something that is very common in most similar stores around. We were just kept waiting when there were hardly any customer in line. The service staff at the front counter needs to be aware of such situations and be careful of the reputation. With so many good coffee shops in the area, without treating customers well, it will be hard to get a good market share.\\n\\nThe good side was the drinks were pretty good, less sugary, more normal flavor.

However, they use an electronic wait list system that will text you when your table is ready, so you are free to roam the area. \\n\\nTheir menu is ranges from $12-14 for a regular sized bowl of ramen. You can choose to +/- $1 for the large or small sizes, respectively. I do find it a bit pricey for the standard ingredients they provide. They also have combo options for $15-16, which includes your choice of ramen, soft boiled egg, and choice of side. The combo comes with a small bowl of ramen, although you have the option to upgrade. My friends who have gotten the combos in the past recommend going with the small bowl because it does end up being quite a filling meal. \\n\\nMy favorite thing to order is the tonkatsu cha su ramen ($14) with kara miso soup base. It comes with four pieces of pork. The kara miso broth is unfortunately an extra fifty cents, but I enjoy the added spice and flavor. I usually go with the regular sized bowl because it has the right amount of noodles to leave me feeling satisfied. \\n\\nIf you're looking to share an appetizer with a friend before the ramen gets to the table, I recommend the takoyaki (5 for $5).

We were extremely hungry and had not been in the downtown area of Columbus for many years, and so were no longer familiar with what was avaliable restaurant wise. Keep in mind it was rather late in the evening, but we managed to stumble upon De Novo; and were we ever glad we did. \\nA smoking hot jazz quartet was just finishing a set to a nicely appointed and kind of busy for that time of night restaurant.  We were immediately sat, offered beverages and given time to peruse the extensive menu and take in our surroundings.  Our server was jovial, knowledgeable and made a great evening even better by suggesting the evening's specials; Vietnamese fried chicken for the spouse, and I indulged in a divine club sandwich. We also enjoyed a tasty cheese tray that took the edge off our appetite,  but still allowed us to savor every bite of dinner once it quickly arrived.\\nMy only regrets are I did not surreptitiously sneak a photo of our plates: Chef arranged them prettily, nor can I  recall our server's name to give him a shout out. He was efficient, fun and even after a long evening serving, was still able to find some humor in the day.\\nWe have talked about our evening there many times since and plan to return in order to partake of the music, people watching,  excellent food and great service. \\nThanks De Novo!

We had been to a few other Ale House's, and generally have a pretty good time, so we decided to swing on in.\\nWas pretty surprised to see that this place was full, but not packed on a Friday night. We were able to get seated quickly, and we were off to a good start. Everything pretty much went downhill from there. Our server was a real nice guy, but seemed to be having a pretty bad night.\\nWe ordered a few beers and an appetizer to start off our meal. It took a few minutes to get our beers, as the keg had to be changed. No problem, I will wait to get my delicious Sam Adams draft. After delivering our beers, he took our orders for the main meal.\\nAbout 10 minutes later, our food arrived. Unfortunately, our appetizer never did. I was pretty bummed, as I really wanted some cheese sticks, but I was about to dig into my spicy chicken sandwich, when I noticed my girlfriend's order was wrong. We flagged the waiter down, to which he apologized, and went back to the kitchen to right the order. After about 3 minutes (meaning her steak sandwich had been microwaved), he came back and forgot the dipping sauce on the side. Again. After flagging him down again, he quickly got the sauce, and when he came back, asked if we needed more beers, which we did.\\nWe were starving, so we dug into our sandwiches, which turned out were very, very good (even the microwaved one!). The spicy chicken sandwich was very spicy, very tender, and very delicious. Fries were also yummy, and the meal was pretty filling. Our waiter soon returned with our beers, and my delight turned to horror as I discovered I was not drinking Sam Adams, but a Stella, which my girlfriend had ordered. D'oh! I was pretty upset, but figured our poor waiter had just had enough, and decided not to push the issue, and chugged it down.\\nWe decided to end our meal, and head out to the bar area outside, so we could just drink and be taken care of by someone else. The bar area was great- bartenders were awesome, and I drank delicious Sam Adams draft all night long! \\nOverall- well, our server made NUMEROUS mistakes... however, he was a nice guy, and the managers did stop by our table to apologize and comp us some stuff. The food was pretty tasty, and I had a great time. I would've given this place two stars, but because I did end up having a great time, and a pretty decent meal, I rounded it up to 3. If you're in the area and looking for a place to stop in and have beers, wings, and watch some sports on the TV, the Ale House is a great place to go. Decent crowd with lots of different folks in here, but a great atmosphere, and lots of beers on tap. The service just seems to be sketchy here, so if you're stopping in to eat, good luck to you! Would definitely recommend over some of the other places in the area, however. If I'm staying in the same hotel next time, I probably will stop in again, but it will just be for drinks."},{"name":"Voodoo Doughnut - Old Town","address":"22 SW 3rd Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"This should be a one time only experience.

Their quinoa patty wasn't messy at all.  It came with a brioche bun, lettuce, tomatoes, and red onions.  I think if it had an avocado in it, it would have made it better.  I've had a similar burger at Romer's and it was delicious. Most of the food I have tried is decent, nothing special.

A very young girl with another tired unfriendly face met us at the top of the stairs.A tired older lady took our drink orders with another man bringing water. When waitress came my wife had a half dozen oysters which were very good. We both ordered the seafood platter which came right away. The seafood platter was not that good. The fried clams were overcooked and dry. The fried scallops,fish, and oysters were good(only 3 shrimp).

They have decreased the size of the sandwich. It used to be filling. Today I could've eaten 2. Honestly you'll save your money by going to the market and buying the ingredients your self! Then you have bagels for 6 days. The only thing they have going for them now is the rosemary rock salt bagel is yummy. But now you have to buy 2 to have a full breakfast.

But there is really no excuse for truly bad service, and especially not particularly good food.\\n\\nWhen we arrived, the place was about 2/3 full, and we picked a table with barstools - unfortunately, the table AND the stools were sticky. We ended up cleaning them ourselves. When we finally got someone's attention, she still took another good while to come over, and then gave us \\"late night\\" menus. When she came back around a good while later, I asked why we had \\"late night\\" menus (which had no sandwiches on it, just the pizza - which we knew to avoid from Yelp reviews - and appetizers). She mumbled something about \\"too many people,\\" which made me think the kitchen was serving limited menu. No, she meant \\"not enough menus\\" - she was going to give us a limited menu SOLELY because there were not enough menus to go around - and without comment. Nice.\\n\\nShe finally rounded us up some real menus, and as she handed them to us she asked if we were ready to order. Um, can I get 30 seconds with the menu, please? She came back a good while later to take our order, and had a hard time understanding the intricacies of \\"no tomatoes or lettuce, but include pickles and onions\\" on the burger. Eventually the message was conveyed. About 40 minutes later (no beverage refills, no comment), our food was delivered - without silverware, without napkins, and without pickles (apparently they were out of pickles) - but WITH hair across the burger as she delivered it. Ick. So I asked for a fork - you know, to eat my salad, and while it seemed a real imposition, she went to fetch one. JUST one. No place setting for the bf (apparently he looks like the type who will eat with his hands and not require a napkin). It took her about another 3 trips to get his bbq sauce and both of us place settings. \\n\\nAfter all this, the food was mediocre-to-bad. Talk about chintzy - my fish sandwich had the fish filet sliced in half AFTER it was fried - I've never seen that before - so it was just one filet in half, instead of two little filets. Nice. And on the first try, the bun fell completely apart, as did the fish (half a filet doesn't hold together that well, it turns out). The fish was also . . . chewy . . . tough. The fries were cool, and went gross pretty quickly (maybe undercooked, not sure). The burger was bland and uninteresting, even with pepperjack and bbq sauce.\\n\\nEventually another waitress (maybe a manager) came by to give us beverage refills, and came by another time or two to see if we needed anything else. To give a frame of reference, at least two other people  asked us if we needed anything WHILE we were still waiting for our check.\\n\\nI can't imagine a circumstance under which we would go back."},{"name":"Union Oyster House","address":"41 Union St","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"This was one of the first meals of our trip and the last where we blindly followed a suggestion out of our guidebook without checking it against Yelp.

The ceviche was tasty and seemed to be a pretty generous serving. \\nMains were the filet (bistec novoandino) and scallops (conchas del senor de sipan). The three scallops were tiny compared to the massive bases of potatoes, and the crab \\"canneloni\\"...does not remotely resemble a canneloni. Wouldn't recommend this dish.

Thanks to the Yelp reviews, my dinner party was prepared :) However at the same time, the owner really is all about pleasing his customers - best example is telling us about the BYOB policy as soon as we walked in (& no corkage fee!), and directing us to the nearest liquor store with a good selection of beers & wines. They're also great about rewarding first-timers and encouraging their return by offering a 25% coupon that be used as many times for the next two months. \\n\\nEverything we ordered was delicious. I came with a party of 4, and 3 entrees (which comes w/ basmati rice) and 2 orders of naan was just the right amount of food. Of course the owner tried to get us to order a mango lassi, appetizers, chutneys, a 4th entree (since we had 4 people), and basmati rice w/ raisins for an extra $2 but we declined all that :) Thanks to the reviews, we knew portions would be generous. However note that when entrees first arrive, you'll think wow, portions look small. The sauces are rich & filling ... and the naan & rice will also fill you up fast. Just pace yourself and the amount of food will be just right.\\n\\nHere is what we ordered:\\n\\n\\"Teek-ka Moshol-la\\" (aka \\"chicken tikka masala\\") - $12. Delicious although come to think of it, I don't think I've ever had bad chicken tikka masala. This is my favorite Indian dish - which reminds me, I keep forgetting to ask how Bangledeshi food is different from Indian food. One friend liked the sauce so much he put the entire serving spoon in his mouth and licked it clean :) \\n\\n\\"Shaag Poneer Maang-sho\\" (aka \\"saag paneer\\") - $10. We ordered this dish w/ chicken. The sauce with this dish was very tasty, too. \\n\\n\\"Channa Begoon\\" - $9. This was a new dish for us. It's chickpeas cooked w/ roasted pureed skinless eggplant. Another winner and yummy dish. \\n\\n\\"Mixed Naan\\" - $3. This naan is stuffed w/ cheese, onions, and garlic - I would've never thought to order the mixed naan except the reviews were raving about it. So glad we did our research! :)\\n\\n\\"Naan\\" - $2. Also ordered regular naan to help sop up the deliciousness left in the three plates.\\n\\nOverall the food was really wonderful. Everyone enjoyed it. Service was very good. All us said we'd come back. I liked too that the menu prices already include taxes so the total bill ends up being a nice round number :) Since we brought our own wine, it ended up being just $9/person + tip. Now that's what I call an awesome deal :) \\n\\nFYI - definitely make reservations. This place seems to be quite popular.

Is it really voodoo? I visited Portland during December 2016 and of course had to stop by this place. Voodoo Doughnut is one of Portland's icons. This represents the creativity of Portland. They have multiple locations now but I believe this is the origin location. It's located in downtown near their Saturday Market. As we know they are super famous, the line can get long into the day. We got lucky to visit on a day that's snowing and freezing cold. There was essentially no line. I love how they present their creative doughnuts, like jewelry spinning around. Honestly, it is very difficult to read their menu. The best way to pick the doughnut is by looking. I had their berry hibiscus doughnut. It was bright pink berry sugar top with berry sprinkles. I love the taste of the doughnut, definitely one of the kind. Slightly on the sweet side of things but perfect with a cup of hot coffee. The texture of their doughnut is soft inside but slightly crispy outside. I would like it to be slightly warm if possible but overall excellent doughnut.

First off, I think a little bit of an exposition is in order.\\n\\nI met a friend here for dinner when they first opened.  It's located at the corner of Oak and Parsons.  He explained the concept to me, that the proprietors own a farm where they try to produce as much of the ingredients for the restaurant as possible.  Great, was my thought.  I had duck confit for dinner, and a lovely bottle of Chimney Rock.  I thought the wine was reasonably priced, and the bartender who waited on us was great.  However, I thought the preparation did not begin to do justice to the quality of ingredients they had to begin with.  My duck confit was greasy, and I didn't enjoy it, so I haven't been back since.  And, yes, for the record, I know confit means boiled in fat.  I have had duck confit elsewhere that wasn't greasy, just tender and yummy.\\n\\nOK, now on to the restaurant week review.  I ate here last night, because my better half chose this spot off the list of options. She has never been here before, and I was ready to see how they are doing now that they're settled in a bit better.\\n\\nOur server was good.  We ordered a bottle of Beaujolais.  All of the wine served is at state minimum, no corking fee.  What a wonderful approach, impossible to be a better deal.  That said, at $34 a bottle, the Beaujolais was an expensive one (for Beaujolais), and pretty awful.  So this is an area where more work needs to be done, whoever is picking out the wine needs to work harder, or they need a new sommelier.\\n\\nWe ordered and more or less split all of the following: root vegetable salad, poached pear salad, pork eggroll, duck confit tostada, seared scallops, stuffed beef tenderloin, chocolate bread pudding, and \\"banana-misu\\".  So, OK, it was $35/person here for restaurant week, and I notice that the entrees were $17-23 or so on the menu.  I watched the woman next to me get served a giant half of a chicken while drinking my wine, so I was really disappointed with the joneser portions we were served of everything, except dessert.\\n\\nThe bread was good, warm and fresh.  It came with carrot and ginger infused butter.  Were it not for the orangish color, I would've thought it was plain butter.  No discernable taste of ginger or carrot.\\n\\nThe salads came on tiny bread plates, and were difficult to eat as a result.  They were both very good tasting though, and the ingredients undeniably fresh.\\n\\nThe bread plates are back, this time mine has a fat eggroll on it, hers two tortilla chips.  I am sorry, two tortilla chips with stuff on them does not a tostada make my friend.  Her plate looked really anemic.  I stole a little piece of the duck confit off of one of the chips, and it wasn't greasy this time, so the food preparation is improving.\\n\\nWhen our entrees showed up, I started to get really sad.  I got a whopping TWO scallops.  Sorry bro, that's an appetizer, not a meal.  She got two tiny pieces of filet.  Both came with parsnips and carrots and some roasted potatoes.  We thought everything tasted good though, especially the veggies.\\n\\nDessert comes, and we finally got a normal sized serving of something it looks like.  The chocolate bread pudding was great.  The \\"banana-misu\\" was dry, and only faintly tasted of bananas.  Ended up leaving half of that, and that never happens, leftover dessert.  So they need to scrap that recipe or improve it.\\n\\nI felt weird leaving.  I think this is the first time I have went somewhere for restaurant week and felt ripped off for ordering the restaurant week specials rather than ordering off the regular menu.  I am also back where I was when I left last time.  I like the place, want them to succeed, strongly support the concept, but feel like I have no reason to drive back there and eat again.\\n\\nImprove the quality of wines you are selling, improve the desserts, and hook up people for restaurant week, don't slight them--might be the only opportunity you have to win over their business."},{"name":"Leaf Vegetarian Restaurant","address":"1710 Pearl St","city":"Boulder","stars":"4","text":"I once saw Vegan Ultra marathoner Scott Jurek here.

I've gone several times as this location is closest to my home, however; every single time I've gone there's a crazy long wait during off peak hours (e.g., Thursday at 8pm, one cashier, 12 people in line), the place looks like a disaster with trash everywhere, tables not wiped down, the bakery section looks like it has been ransacked by an angry mob, and service is painfully slow. \\n\\nMet a friend for a late dinner on a weeknight at 8pm. We were number 11 and 12 in line, respectively. One line opened, several employees milling about with no care.  I ordered a Sierra Turkey and soup and my food came within five minutes. My friend ordered a Sierra Turkey and chips and it didn't come for fifteen minutes!! Fifteen minutes at Panera for a cold sandwich?

Is it pancakes? Is it a donut? Is this that faux maple pancake syrup that costs $2 in Slaveway? With a side of bacon and a milk chaser. The chocolate penetration has chocolate icing and cocoa puffs, which is interesting because the puffs lend themselves as a major crunchy texture against the normally monotone raised dough.

After a full day at one of the Disney parks, we needed to stop for dinner.  We were all pretty hungry since we had only snacked in the parks trying to keep expenses down.  We chose Steak on Fire because mom wanted something substantial (not fast food) and we needed to keep the cost down (there are seven of us).  The first night we ate here (yes, it was so good we came back a second night during our week in Orlando) we ordered three steak kids meals for the little people, the big boys ordered sides so they could finish whatever meat the little people didn't eat from the kid's meals. Mom ordered top sirloin on a plate and Dad ordered the Brazilian steak burger sandwich.  It was all very good.  The little people loved their meals and ate most of them.  The big boys enjoyed their sides and the little bit of meat left to them from the kiddoes.  Ha.  Mom really enjoyed the steak.  It was tender and the sauce that came with it was amazing.  The sauce was vinegar based and seasoned well.  Everything did seem to need a little salt but I would rather have to add it than to have it over-salted for sure.  The second time we ate here we ordered one chicken kids meal and two steak.  The chicken was also very well done, tasty, and tender.  The big boys ordered sandwiches (a pork tenderloin and one of the steaks).  They both said they were very good.  The littles were not as hungry this night so we had extra meat to go around the table.  Our opinions on the side dishes:  Grilled vegetables were very good.  Mom enjoyed the roasted potatoes, but the little people did not.  Only one of us enjoyed the pineapple...to be fair, we are not a huge fan of cinnamon which is probably why it wasn't a favorite with us. One of the big boys ordered the golden cheese bites and ate them but said they were \\"odd\\".  The rest of us didn't try them.  Mom thinks she probably would have enjoyed those....maybe next time she will order them to try.  If we lived in the area this would become one of our go-to places.  For a partly counter-service establishment the food is really good and the pricing is on-target.  You order at the counter and sit down with a number.

Anis is wonderfully romantic. The atmosphere is very much what a French bistro is like. A lot of other yelpers seem to have problems with the service. We couldn't disagree more. The service (and pace of service) is very French. They aren't nearly as pushy with their people or their food. When I'm out and trying to have a nice, relaxing, enjoyable evening out I don't want to be bothered over and over by the wait staff. The servers at Anis are pleased to let you take your time with each course, and to let you digest a little between dishes. We appreciate this aspect of Anis very much.\\n\\nOn to the food. It's been fantastic both times we visited. On our first trip we started with the scallop appetizer. It was delicious! Just the right amounts of sweet and savory to compliment the perfectly cooked scallops. For dinner I had the Filet au Poivre. It was cooked perfectly and was extremely tender. It had a slight char on the outside to compliment the pepper sauce that was appropriately portioned. My lady friend had the Pan Roasted Trout. She loved all of it and actually ate her entire entree (which is a bit of a rarity). The dish was light but filling.\\n\\nThe second time we went we both decided to branch out a little bit. Again, we started with the scallops. Just as wonderful the second time around. For my entree I decided to go with the Veal Bistro Steak. It was marvelous. The veal was incredibly tender and cooked to perfection. The potatoes and mirepoix were cooked well with just the right amount of crisp and provided great accompaniment. My lady friend tried the Braised Veal Cheeks. This came out almost like a stew, with the tomato juice from the grape tomatoes and the garlic au jus blending together to form a delectable broth. The veal was so tender that it literally melted in your mouth. The overall flavor of the dish was nothing short of incredible.\\n\\nWe had dessert both visits. The first time we tried some of their homemade sorbets and also the creme brulee. The sorbets were truly wonderful. The creme brulee was also good but very standard. This time we had the warm peach tort and they surprised us with a complimentary order of their profiteroles. The profiteroles were extremely tasty.

The guy taking my order was friendly (unlike the one who prepared the food:/)  I ordered the 3 piece as my options were 2 and 3.  I am a dark meat man, and so ordered all dark.  The order taker - again the nice one of the two - said \\"all drums\\"?  Now...  I am not a petite flower.  I played college football on the line.  So you can imagine.  He said all they ever have are legs and wings.  Then I took a look again at the menu and it was $3 and 6$.  That math did not work in my mind.  I thought Id try the waffle also - nope - out of those.  :/  So I downsized my order to 2piece - cant see spending that much for a couple of legs...  jeez!  Same reason I dont go to KFC!  THe guy raved on the truffle mac n cheese so I took an order of that.  I was running out of options and HOPING that those legs would at the very least be LARGE! especially since that was about all the meat they offered.  \\n\\nI spent $12 on what turned out to be a mini leg - maybe a little larger then what you get at a wing place but had the same amount of meat on it as did a wing place drumette!  I looked at it, and there was only 1 leg and something that resembled a boneless strip of white meat.  I asked the cook/server guy and he said that the order only came or comes as 2 pieces.  He did volunteer to cook another but it started to rain and I was already perturbed.  The mac n cheese did not look near as good as the pics you see on here.  There needs to be more cheese to it, and the crumbes were very sparse.  The flavor was fine.  Just could be better.\\n\\nAll in all I doubt I will go back.

Yes it was different than regular siu mai at dimsum places, but I guess I was expecting a more traditional asian pot sticker dumplings instead of siu mai.

They say it gets up to 1,000 degrees in there, which is perfect for the type of food they serve.  We split the ricotta appetizer.  It was fluffy, salty deliciousness spread on dense, chewy foccacia (I think) bread.  Our pizzas were great too.  We got the sausage one and the mushroom one.

What comes out of that steel forge is a really chewy crust with nice char and bubbles, and cheese melted so quickly that it loses its heaviness.  No grease, no nastiness...Truly a great pizza, and one definitely worth trying if you want something that you can't usually find in Austin.  If you're a big eater, you'll each want one.

They did their job, but not much more than that.  It's not that they were rude or anything, just not as friendly as you might expect in such a cozy place.

I took the Travel Channel approach here and went with \\"if it looks good, eat it.\\"\\n\\nStarting with the food, everything was expertly presented and quick. I had samplings of several tapas, including the quinoa-stuffed peppers, beef heart skewers, and potatoes with dip. The peppers were so incredible that my vegetable-despising husband had two servings. The potatoes sounded so good on the menu, and they were good, but also were just potatoes. The beef heart skewers were milder than I expected, but I wouldn't consider them my favorite cut of beef by far. For my entree, I chose the porkchop on top of a chocolatey pepper potato stew. This was very delicious, though the pork may have been a bit too cooked for my liking. The combination of chocolate and peppers was fabulous, and the whole dish came topped with these Pikmin-shaped red peppers that surprisingly tasted like citrus fruit. It's a dish I could never have imagined eating before they brought it before my eyes--it was so unique. \\n\\nI'm a glutton for calories, so my favorite parts of the evening were the cocktails and dessert. I've had many pisco sours in several restaurants that weren't remotely Latin American, but the pisco sours here are perfect. The foam was thick and sweet with a light hint of bitters.

But as you walk into the restaurant, you can feel the history.  Maybe not as much as in historic Williamsburg, but it is still there.\\n\\nThe food was definitely delicious.  The mussels, basque style were very tender and flavorful.  The littleneck clams were also fresh and tasty although maybe a bit gritty, but we were forewarned of this on the menu.  They do live in the sand, so you can't be totally surprised by this.  Clam chowder was nice and creamy.\\n\\nFor main entrees, the american bouillabase is a unique dish.  It is like a stew based on a mirepoix broth of carrots, onion, and celery.  I found it a bit bland and one-dimensional, but would be good for someone who is into having an unadulterated seafood soup.  \\n\\nThe lobster scampi is a fantastically rich dish with already rich lobster.  The garlic butter adds a great flavor dimension and is so good on top of the linguine noodles.  The lobster newburg is the ultimate in creamy lobster fare as it is served on top of a flaky pastry shell.  \\n\\nThe shore dinner is a no frills straight lobster with potatoes and corn, reminiscent of the wonderful beachside clambakes of a bygone era.  \\n\\nThe Boston style baked beans were very good, in that it did not have an overly powerful sweetness.  The Indian corn pudding is a must try, as it is one of the most unusual desserts I have had.  Sweet, with a slight bitterness, it was a very unusual take on a corn based dessert.  I can't even tell if it was good or not, it was just bizarre, like peanut soup.\\n\\nOverall, I would say the food was very good, but I have to downgrade the rating due to the ridiculous wait.  During peak times, it can be well over and hour and we had to wait an hour and a half.  If the restaurant is packed, I can fully understand this, but they had about a dozen of empty seats and booths near the bar area that was closed off.  Not cool when you are supposed to be operating at full throttle and poor planning if it was due to staffing."},{"name":"De Novo","address":"201 S High St","city":"Columbus","stars":"3.5","text":"Came here for brunch with a friend, and everything we had was delicious! \\n\\nCreme brulee French toast: this was our favorite, not too sweet and not too heavy!\\n\\nCheddar and pork cheek omelette: This potatoes were tasty, and the pork cheek in the omelette was good!

I was very pleasantly surprised how good fried chicken could be. \\n\\nTruffle Mac & Cheese - I unfortunately didn't even get to try  this item because the other 3 individuals devoured it so quickly, it left my head spinning. All I can tell you is they absolutely loved it. \\n\\nBlack Eyed Peas - This home-style dish was incredible. Reminded me of how my mother used to make only better. I hope she doesn't read this because she would be sad to know how much better this one was. \\n\\nCorn - The corn was excellent. It had great flavor between the seasonings and the aioli. Our group quickly ate 4 pieces and wanted to go back for more.\\n\\nSlaw - I was initially worried about the slaw because I've had one to many family reunions where everyone brought Cole slaw. This wasn't my families typical slaw, the blue cheese flavoring  was outstanding.\\n\\nAll in all we LOVED Ms P's.

So disappointed. I have drove by this place a few times as I work in close proximity.. It's in the bottom of the sanctuary building in downtown Orlando, a prime location. I had dinner with my husband on a weekday night at the restaurant. Not sure if was there first week open or not but wouldnt be surprised if it was.\\n\\nSetting: \\nThe decor at the restaurant is rather nice. It has a warm and inviting look. We felt like the dining room was very loud however, even at approximately 75% occupancy. This is not somewhere I would go if your looking for a quite date night.\\n\\nDrinks: \\nMy husband wanted to start with a beer. Unfortunately they only had 1 beer choice which my husband didn't want so we went straight to the wine menu. The menu has a lot of wines to choose from but is not particularly exciting with the offerings. Most of the producers are names you can find at the publix right around the corner. Ruffino, mondavi, kendel jackson, etc. There were a few interesting wines listed but not what I would expect given the location/atmosphere/price point and the fact that it's owned by Funky Munky WINE company.\\n\\nFood:\\nOur friendly server let us know that their fryer was not working which eliminated our first choice, the calamari at the top of the menu.  We opted instead for the caprese salad. It was probably the best food portion of the meal but it was very basic. It lacked in flavor which made it blend in with similar offerings at nearly every Italian restaurant. I chose the chicken marsala for my main course and my husband chose the penne with vodka sauce. The food arrived after a lengthy weight which our server apologized for. The chicken Marsala turned out just ok. The sauce was sweet which I was not a fan of and the only thing it was accompanied with was a few potatoes under the chicken that are covered in the same sauce. My husbands pasta was very simple with just pasta and some grilled shrimp that came out dry and unappealing.  We both ate our meals but neither one of us were particularly impressed by the food.  We decided against desert amongst each other before the server offered but I wanted to end with a cappuccino. Im not sure what brand coffee or system they are using to make it but it's certainly not the quality coffee drink a fine Italian restaurant should be serving.\\n\\nOverall the service was good but if you call yourself a \\"foodie\\" or \\"wine-o\\" this probably is going to disappoint.

I can't help that hot dogs trigger bad memories. When I think of hot dogs, I think of certain moments in my childhood, where there was nothing left to eat in the fridge but that half-opened, wet, uninviting plastic pouch of minced and compressed meat. Hot dogs remind me of the effortless, slap it together, lukewarm or splintered from intense microwave heat sorta meal...the kind of meal that leaves you full enough not to starve, yet unsatisfied...still empty somehow. I am so scarred by memories of bad hot dogs, that I can't even fully appreciate Hebrew Nationals.\\n\\nThen came Frank.\\n\\nWhen my friend told me she was excited to take me for a hot dog, I obliged hesitantly. I'm not going to be rude. I'm Southern.\\n \\nNow to the good part: Frank Restaurant not only serves as one of Austin's most delicious eateries, but also as a cool music venue. If you want some live music and a beer, hit up Frank. If you want the most delicious hot dog you've ever tasted in your life (wherever you come from) go to Frank. And whatever you do, don't offer to split a hot dog with someone (no matter how special) unless you intend to order several dogs to sample the different flavors. You'll want a whole dog to yourself.\\n\\nI ordered the Jackolope. The sausage of this hot dog is a mixture of antelope (yes antelope), pork and rabbit. The casing of this hot dog is firm and slightly crisp, with a tender, hearty and succulent center. The meat is topped with sriracha aioli, melted cheddar cheese and huckleberry compote. The compote is slightly sweet, perfectly complementing the slight spiciness of the meat and the aioli. The stuffing to bun ratio is perfect. The dark, golden and tender Artisan bun is firm enough to hold the good stuff, but soft enough to bite through and melt in your mouth. \\n\\nWe also ordered waffle fries with Buffalo Bleu sauce on the side for dipping. The waffle fries are perfectly salted, nice and wide (crisp on the outside, and soft on the inside). The buffalo sauce is a mixed pleasure: spicy buffalo wing sauce tossed with blue cheese crumbles. My friend dared me to drink the leftover sauce. I told her she didn't have to dare me...it's THAT good. That, and there wasn't much sauce leftover! Instantly you're hit with the heat, but then cooled with the cream of the blue cheese.\\n \\nIf you don't check out Frank, you don't know what you're missing!

The seafood paella was extremely salty so the owner lady just took the plate away from me without explaining to me what she was about to do with the dish as she was too busy to explain while servicing other tables. The appies didnt come after thirty mins of ordering, so basically the appies and mains all came at once while my elderly parents were sitting on an empty stomach. The coleslaw that came with the fish and chips were just wrong; it was also extremely salty as well as SOUR!

Absolutely stunning views, specially at night.  \\n\\nThe service is good, depending on which wait staff is assigned to your table.

There was absolutely no one there how could the wait be so long (already) for 2 adults and a child. The hostess told us we can sit downstairs (open seating) and still enjoy salads, sandwiches and appetizers from a smaller menu. We thought that was perfect and were seated in a small room (6-8 tables) with two waitresses. We joked the whole night about this was their \\"B-Team\\" because the entire experience was horrible. Our waitress was very nice, but some people just aren't cut out for the jobs they hold. \\nThe tables were dirty and not bussed yet, the table we sat at only had 2 place settings and it took her almost until our meal came to bring the rest of the settings. One of us ordered chowder to start which never came out. When our meals arrived, we asked about the chowder to which she said \\"oh I'm sorry I forgot, I will grab it now\\" It was too late now since the meals already arrived so we said no thanks. \\nShe didn't come over to check on us, and as we sat eating others around us were coming and going and tables were being left dirty while more customers were waiting to sit.

Take note: \\"cuteness\\" is an unusual characteristic among breakfast/brunch establishments. More often than not you'll read about mountains of hash and seas of gravy, with adjectives like \\"copious\\" and \\"ridiculous\\" describing the portions. Broder is indeed cute, and almost entirely unlike the typical Portland breakfast. \\n\\nBut first, one unfortunate similarity: the wait. The ubiquitous long wait is alive and in full force here, and on top of that, the service is slloowww. Don't get me wrong, the staff are working their asses off -- I am in no way criticizing them. I'm criticizing the owner for starting a restaurant without the physical capacity to serve the room in a timely fashion. Whatever salary/benefits the staff members are earning there, considering the impossibility of their task, it's not enough.\\n\\n(One other complaint: music. People, I like Elliott Smith, but one song at a time, please. Don't play all of XO from beginning to end. Mix it up a little.)\\n\\nIn every other respect, though, Broder sets itself completely apart. As has been noted repeatedly here, the aebleskivers, Danish pancakes that look almost entirely unlike non-Danish pancakes, top a long list of really good reasons to eat here at least once. Honorable mentions: potato pancakes, baked eggs, and the whole notion of \\"salad\\" at breakfast. And smoked trout hash? You mean, you can make hash with a smoked fish not called salmon? Plus, the (stumptown) espresso drinks are vastly superior to those at most breakfast places I've patronized. \\n\\nAlso appreciated: the complimentary drip coffee they serve at the bar next door for those sad folks (myself included) who have chosen to spend part of their weekend morning waiting for a table. Not quite enough for me to forgive the wait, but it's a nice touch.\\n\\nI'm gonna have to figure out a place to put my deep loathing of having to wait for a table so I can come back soon, because there's nowhere else in town that serves breakfast remotely like this."},{"name":"Voodoo Doughnut - Old Town","address":"22 SW 3rd Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"this place is the definition of 'hyped up'. \\nalways a line.\\nthe donuts taste normal other that crazy designs made of extra frosting. too much if you ask me. ill stick to my normal donuts.\\ni liked the normal glazed. and the oreo cookie donut."},{"name":"Andina Restaurant","address":"1314 NW Glisan St","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"Well, I don't know where to begin.

This might have accounted for some of the noise.  No matter, the service was really excellent.\\nWe started with a  Pisco Sour cocktail.  It was wonderful!  Then we had a starter of some kind of stuffed pepper, very tasty, and a green salad also very tasty.  My husband ordered the roasted fish of the day which was Mahi Mahi and I ordered the pork loin dish, medium rare.  We waited for what we thought was a very long time (too long actually) for our orders to be served.  When they came, they looked wonderful.  My pork loin was a smallish piece placed on top of some sort of very tasty mashed stuff with a poached pear and a reduction of some kind over all.  Very good.  The problem was with the pork loin.  It was so tough and dry that I could hardly slice it with the steak knife they provided me with.  I couldn't eat it.  I'm wondering if maybe it sat under a warming lamp too long and dried out or ???  When our server came by after we were finished, he asked if he could box the meat for me to take home and I told him no, it was so dry it was inedible.  He took it and said he was going to the kitchen.  A very nice woman came to the table asking what the problem was and I told her and she said she would like the kitchen to re-do it but I declined her offer.  She took the entree off our bill and apologized.  Everybody was very nice and what was edible was actually very tasty.  They present a very unusual menu.

We're talking cloth tablecloths,  folks! \\n\\nWe made a reservation for 4 about a month ago for a Saturday night, whenever the menus were posted for the Dining Month. The reservation was honored and we were seated down in the quieter basement away from the live music. If you think you'd like to hear live music (I wish I knew this was an option) you can certainly note that in your reservation notes with Opentable. All I put was that we were coming in for date night and for Portland Dining Month. \\n\\nEvery single interaction we had with our servers and hostesses was kind and friendly. Sometimes, you don't get that in the restaurant business. \\n\\nI spoke with a server about an oyster sauce allergy and was met with understanding and lots of information. They took every care to make sure I didn't puff up like a pufferfish at dinner. \\n\\nFirst course was the potato/corn/cotija salad. The potato was playfully creamed, where you might have thought a potato salad would arrive with cold, skinned potatoes like your summer potato salads at picnics. Nope, this came as a colorful, chilled coiffure of whipped potatoes, a corn pico de gallo and cotija. Surprising, playful and a rainbow on one plate. I so wish I'd taken a photo but it was just too tasty. They do a good job at setting a nice casual ambience too, so you feel very comfortable talking among yourselves. We watched all the other dishes coming and going. The next dish, we all chose the beef tenders with rice and pomme frites. The sauce was so savory and good. And it didn't contain oyster sauce after all. She said they used something called mirin (a rice wine?) instead of oyster sauce. It was delicious. It held up well as leftovers the next day (I even had mine 2 days later, cold, for lunch and it was still so flavorful and tasty). The rice was buttery and well made. \\n\\nWe had a split of desserts, the men got the chocolate cake with the avocado creme anglaise schmear (I mean that in the most loving, positive way) and the girls got the alfajors, key lime and secured in place with extra dulce de leche. The cake was rich, to the point of a nut-less fudge and the avocado was the perfect buttery complement. The cookie was riding the sweet spot of crispy and crunchy, and moist and cakey. We all shared everything at dessert. \\n\\nEverything was tasty (not my experience at my other PDM stops this month), every person was friendly and accommodating and we will definitely be back! \\n\\nA few things we tried apart from the PDM menu, the scallops in brown sugar + butter - I don't have any words here except expletives, so just insert your beloved curse word of choice, drawn out in an food porngasmic way. 10/10 would recommend. The large order is 6, in 2 boats. The boats have a sweet, savory butter sauce. And I had the Inca Kola: lemon verbena cream soda. Fluorescent yellow and delicious. Definitely a flavor all its own.

Located in downtown Portland, Andina is in close proximity to a number of establishments and convenient to anywhere in the city that I can imagine.\\n\\nThe food here is delicious - you will love it as long as you are interested in something a bit different. I have never been to an upscale Peruvian restaurant, and in fact, I've been to just one or two Peruvian restaurants in my entire life, so my experience with this cuisine is limited. Regardless, it was quite good. We shared a seared tuna appetizer, feasted on the complimentary bread simply because of the dipping sauces, which were so unique and tasty that I couldn't stop eating. I had the duck breast and duck confit main dish with the cilantro rice, and it was excellent. Although I've finally decided that I just don't like duck breast (although confit is great), I wouldn't shy away from it at Andina if I were a fan of it in general.\\n\\nThe service was very prompt and attentive, and the manager provided a complimentary dessert in honor of our 5-year wedding anniversary.

Both were amazing. The Benedict came with tomato and spinach. The sweet nuts and bananas paired perfectly with the sweet potato waffle. However, the waffle was on the slender side, and there was just one. So you may want to order something else or double your order if you're set on waffles. My companions created custom omelets which received thumbs ups, and so did the coffees and bloody Marys. \\n\\nFor dinner, our party shared the not bad fried pickles ($4.25) as an appetizer, and I had the ginormous Cobb salad ($11.99) as my main.

I took one glance at the pork tenderloin among it's Spanish chorizo and verde sauce partners in crime and knew that was the dish I would order. The problem when the decision to order was that he, too, wanted that dish--and normally we would find a second dish to split the two, but not tonight. You see Boyd was working and according to our very helpful, attentive, and funny server, you wanted the pork tenderloin when Boyd was cooking. \\n\\nSo we both ordered it and the conversation came to a screeching halt as soon as it touched our tongues. Why? Because it was better than described. The portion was large. The verde soooo good and it came with the perfect amount of chorizo, potatoes, and kale. Paired with a brew and this date was off to an excellent start.\\n\\nIf I ever have a hankering for pork in the future (besides bacon, which as any bacon lover knows gets its own food group) I will come back for this dish.

This place is in the neighborhood and we've been super excited to try it, but it really fell short. To preface, my partner and I relocated from Chicago and our opinion is the same...it wouldn't last more than a few months. \\n\\nI'll just run through chronologically. The host was super friendly and welcoming.  Points for the inviting atmosphere. The bartender was...well, brisk is putting it nicely. We sat down to wait for a table at the bar, we had made reservations so we knew it wouldn't be long. They have some signature cocktails on their menu, and deciding to branch out this date night from either a local beer, or a Manhattan (yes, I'm an old lady and proud of it), I chose to drink a fig based whiskey cocktail. Not bad, it was just lackluster. Not great, not terrible, just nothing to really leave a memory. My partner had a negroni-same story. For a great negroni check out Billy Sunday in Chicago. The super friendly host came to let us know our table was free, and we asked if we should close out our bar tab (like ya do), and he promptly answered that the tab would transfer, as I hear the bartender mention that she doesn't have time to close out. She's also the type that yells at poor Damian to dry her glasses but brushes him aside to do it herself because he's not doing it fast enough. \\n\\nWe sat at a very nice table in the corner. Took a good while for our server to come around. The host, again, brought over a bottle of water and topped things off. We had some time to peruse the menu at the bar so we had already chosen in the 10 minutes it took for our server to appear. We ordered the house-made dolmas and baked feta to start, the involtini for me, and my partner chose the seafood hot pot. We also ordered a Fiddler on the park (best drink of the night) and a Goddard (second best). \\n\\nOur server did not return until I was done with my meal. The bartender brought us our cocktails, and a runner brought the food. Ran out of water halfway through.\\n\\nNow for the food, decent not outstanding. Judging from the photos here on yelp it seems that they have some trouble with consistency. Dolmas were served warm-weird. Baked feta was the best thing I tasted. My involtini didn't even look the same as the woman next to me who got it 45 minutes before I did. Good flavor of the two sauces it was served with. The seafood hot pot had good flavor, but the pasta was inconsistent with the style of the restaurant (elbow macaroni). Just seemed like to call themselves a Mediterranean restaurant it should be homemade (also for $26 bucks it shouldn't look like watered down kids macaroni!)\\n\\nAgain, the server didn't come back to check on us until I was done, although they checked on the larger table next to us even AFTER they paid their bill. I even stacked up all our plates so they would be picked up. Little disappointed I didn't give me an opportunity to check out the wine list to have with dinner. \\n\\nI'll check the place out again for brunch, which seems to be where the excellent reviews are stemming. But this place needs to strive for more consistency with its plating and presentation. I felt gipped when my food arrived, and for the cost (yes it is $$$) not acceptable. Lastly, they absolutely need to hire more staff. The lack of service (other than the host) really brought this review down.\\n\\nSo, here I sit...down the block drinking a beer at Eventide to write my review because I couldn't get my server to come back."},{"name":"Top of the Hub","address":"800 Boylston St, Ste 52","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"My mom and I were here for a nicer dinner in Boston and had an extraordinary time!

Since we have early travel plans the next day, we asked the waitress/owner to cancel the rest two dishes if they haven't been prepared.

Excuse me, it doesn't seem very convincing to state that after a 1.5hrs wait for three 5-min dishes. \\n\\nWe kindly asked her to cancel the two dishes that haven't been prepared (sliced eel and crispy duck) and bring on the tofu vegetable soup that has been prepared.

So far, I've enjoyed the sandwiches I've ordered. The chopped BBQ sandwich has an excellent sauce and is a bit addicting with a good portion size. The smoked chicken salad sandwich has a unique taste and was very delicious although I wish the bread was a little less toasty as it was slightly hard to eat. The chicken was a rotisserie type chicken so it was very filling and satisfying. The fried pickles are actual spears and not just those cut up slices that others make and the batter was crispy and delicious. The daily special today was fried chicken, mashed potatoes and green beans. The fried chicken is very tasty with a solid batter and nicely crisped with a good cut of chicken. The mashed potatoes taste like they were made from scratch as well as the gravy. However the green beans were not as fresh and crispy as I'd hoped. I prefer the prior owners version of fresh crispy green beans versus the bacon soaked type. I also sampled most of the gelato they offered and true to its name... Delicious! Seriously good made in-house gelato. The hazelnut chocolate is decadent but still light and the fresh orange cream is just perfect for an afternoon treat in the spring and summer time.  And they offer unique sodas from the fountain like orange hibiscus and pineapple cream soda. Great for the kiddos and families that frequent the Bob Bullock Museum.  I would like the lighting in the actual cafe to be toned down a bit also because I liked the warming light environment the previous owners had but it's not a deal breaker. It's a smaller menu offering than the previous owners but they seem to focus on perfecting their smaller menu which I don't mind at all.  Altogether pretty solid but more pricey than I'd prefer.

This is our waiter's fave thing on the entire menu.  It's covered in white gravy btw)\\n- Raisin/Carrot salad (made w/ mayo I'm sure, but tastes like it might be healthy and it was so good.  I want this at every picnic from now on.)\\n- **TOMATO PIE** (this is in caps because it was the best thing ever.  It's like a pizza casserole/pot pie? But southern? Sadly I did not order it, but my friend did and I basically ate all of hers).\\n-Cinnamon rolls (served with the bread and butter)\\nThe drinks were STRONNNNNG.  So if you're into that, that's good.

Our waitress was excellent and even sent us home with some extra cinnamon rolls to eat in our hotel room.  The place was totally packed on a weeknight, but it didn't seem to have any impact on the service at all.  I am so glad that we went.  The only downside was that I was so stuffed I thought I was going to have to be rolled out of here.

We literally waited a good 10 minutes to get a seat in a pretty empty place. Food was great and ambiance was good. Now when it comes down to paying. We tried to split the bill 3 ways and the waitress seemed to be very confused on what we where asking to do. Then it turns out they don't split bills. So she just asked for our payments and she would run them through the system. Two of my friends gave cards and i gave cash, without even giving us our separate totals she took our payment methods and went to run it through the system. To not go on, one of my friends was charged 6 dollars extra and my other friend got the total charged twice onto his card, and for me I didn't get any change back, they done took my $20 for the $14 dollar bill.

My 13-year old even commented that it was too sweet, and that girl seriously appreciates sugar. We were seated promptly enough and our server asked if we wanted soup, rice & wraps. Yes, yes and yes. But we only received soup (do yourself a favor & bypass the egg flower) and had to ask again for rice & wraps. Perhaps she misunderstood? In any case, after eating we hung around for 20 minutes because the kids wanted their scoops of ice cream and us adults wanted the check.

After some family from out of town came to visit and they wanted to go, it was finally time give it a try. The question was, it worth it? Sort of. It was worth trying but I don't myself going back anytime soon lest someone else was curious. I ordered the Truffle Mushroom Swiss with grilled chicken and overall found it very pleasing for my tastes. The truffle mayo was rich and full of flavor, easily the best part. The problem I had was that there was hardly any mushrooms, maybe 5 tiny ones near the center. The grilled chicken patty was almost paper thin, it's appearance close to a fried egg. The poor little patty was absolutely dominated by the egg bun. It wasn't a dealbreaker for me but for others, I could easily see how it could be. \\n\\nMy boyfriend got the BBQ, Bacon, and Cheddar. I did try a bite and thought the patty was savory albeit a bit forgetful but it was only one bite. He enjoyed it well enough but my problem was seeing the bacon upon arrival. It was limp and fat caked, if it were mine I would have returned the burger and his family professed the same. Something to look out for. A large order of the smashfries accompanied our fare, the basket the same size they give you for your burger. Easily large enough to split between two or more to the fact that we didn't finish it. The fries are shoestring and covered in rosemary, olive oil, and garlic. The flavors they choose pair well and make what normally is my least favorite type of fry cut into an addictive little bites.

He returned with a bit later with the opposite of what she had asked for. He tried again, we sat. Second try, no good. I finally asked if there were a sommelier, which they had. He came over and and a 5 minute discussion between the three of them commenced. Meanwhile we sat. Finally the a glass of wine was brought to our table and the rest of us finally got to actually order our drinks almost 45 minutes into our experience.\\n The food was good but it was obvious that they were shrinking portions done either because it was late in the evening or we were paying a discounted price.

But it is a good neighborhood spot that shouldn't disappoint if you order the right menu items. Overall, I think the 3.5 rating it currently has is right on target.\\n\\nI love the atmosphere here. It is darkly lit indoors with a cool bar and a nice outdoor seating area. The whole area- specially the outdoor area, where you are across from the Apres Diem outdoor seating area- almost reminds you of being in Europe (though you are in a parking lot, so this might be a bit overdoing it). The service is always friendly and prompt.  \\n\\nThe food is good, but the menu is not at all expansive and the options are frustratingly limited. In fact, the options seem to have shrunk recently. A lot of the dishes are also very similar- white wine based sauces, pretty acidic. For me, the highlights here are the patatas bravas, brussel sprouts, asparagus, and mussels. The jamon and cheese plate are also pretty good. I would skip the paella- its nothing special and you don't get that much of it for two people. I guess I would describe the food as semi-authentic, some dishes more than others, but if you've ever been to Spain, I wouldn't go in expecting food quite like its really made in Madrid or Barcelona. \\n\\nThe drinks here are awesome. They always have 4-6 good beers on tap and a great selection of bottles, and their white sangria and wine options are affordable and tasty. Their mixed drinks also look great, though I've yet to try them. \\n\\nTapa Tapa's biggest drawback is hands down its very limited menu and lack of variety. This is a place we would go to way more often if there was more variety, but you get to the point pretty quickly where you've tried everything. The price can also be steep for the portion size/quality of what you're getting. Its not bad by any means, but some dishes aren't anything life-changing and have a steeper price tag. Still, if you want decent tapas done quickly in a nice setting, you should check this place out."},{"name":"Two Urban Licks","address":"820 Ralph McGill Blvd NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"My wife and I dined at Two Urban Licks for my birthday this year.

I've been getting the Carnivore, but the other day I mixed it up and got a half Carnivore and half Rocket, which is Soppressata, mozzarella, shaved Parmesan and baby arugula on top. If you haven't had soppressata - think a spicy salami. This pizza had mad game. The dough on each one is a cross between deep dish and a hand tossed (Detroit style). \\n\\nThey're cooked in square pans and believe me when I tell you these things are DENSE. The carnivore has two freaking kinds of pepperoni, ham, Italian sausage and bacon under the cheese to basically pimp slap any other pizza you've ever had in front of its girlfriend.

It'll be like seeing your dad lose a fight. \\n\\nThey're pricy compared to your chain joints, but that's because somebody built this by hand from beginning to end.

We then ordered two shrimp cocktails and a half dozen oyster on the half shell. The bartender had mentioned that the Blue Points were awesome today, full and meaty, which I noted as the larger the oyster doesn't correlate to a better taste. They were brutal...huge oysters with a strange after taste and no briny sea flavor one might expect. I ate two just to be polite and left the others untouched. The shrimp cocktails looked raw and uncooked. Five small translucent shrimp per order that lacked any flavor or the 'snap' one expects with a solid cocktail. We even asked if they were undercooked and were told that is how they prepare shrimp. The bartender even brought a third order out for our review that looked even worse.

Most entrees are quite bland, with the exception of the chile rellenos, which are quite spicy. However, the cuisine overall does retain a certain homemade charm, and tastes very authentic, despite the toned-down flavor. \\n\\nAtmosphere: The dining room is quite small, but it feels inviting nonetheless. The atmosphere is very family-friendly, and the bar is out of the way. The lighting is very low-key and provides a very intimate dining experience. There are a few accent pieces that complement the style of the restaurant, but nothing too dramatic. \\n\\nDrinks: Definitely the highlight of the meal.

The smoky smell, beautiful garden area, and popularity also drew us in to check out Two Urban Licks. I'm giving it an A-OK rating because although I think it was a perfect spot for our situation, I wasn't blown away and don't want to mislead you.\\n\\nSo, as I mentioned, the place is right off the Belt Line, which meant there was a little path from it to the restaurant garden and patio area. One issue we first had is that there was no designated place for our bikes. We ended up putting them next to the steps that go up to the patio and locking them together. It worked fine but not ideal for a place in such proximity to the path. Maybe they prefer people not to come in off their bikes...\\n\\nAs many other reviews mentioned, it's is very trendy and modern - a huge space that seems to have been a warehouse in the past. We asked to sit closer to the outside (couldn't go on the patio, since the bocce ball league was there), and it felt more casual in that area with a mix of people coming off the Belt Line and nicer dressed people brunching. I should note that we came on a gray, rainy day, so I imagine it was less crowded than usual, and we had no wait.\\n\\nI followed the advise of the many reviewers and our waiter and got the salmon chips. My friend got the frittata and a coffee. I also had a Terrapin beer. Her frittata was large with some sort of pesto sauce on top and came with a nice mixed green salad. She let me have some, and I liked it a lot. We couldn't identify what was in the pesto, but it was nice and herb-y. As far as the salmon chips, the waiter was a little surprised I didn't get an entree as well - he also claimed the most expensive ($20 brisket) item on the menu as his favorite. I'm sure it would have been good too, but I was content with the salmon chips. That being said, I'm not sure why they are so lauded. Cream cheese and smoked salmon is not a new discovery in my world; especially with the red onion and capers, it seemed like a take on a lox bagel. I enjoyed the little zing of spice in the mayo, and I was impressed by the size of the homemade potato chips with the salmon on them, but really not worth writing home about (just on Yelp, apparently).

Shocked when I heard $91 and change.\\n\\nI was most interested in the heralded beef short rib especially since my experience with it to be the cheap tough cousin of the beef back rib that surrounds the ribeye and is typically used in braises and stews.\\n\\nWell I would not order the beef rib again if I go back. Burned on the outside, high degree of unrendered fat on the inside and tough and dry.\\n\\nAs for the brisket ordered moist and lean. Moist includes large chunks of the fat cap an inch thick that have not been removed. Lean is quite fall apart almost dry.\\n\\nThe sausage was nice, good texture, snap and seasoning. Pork ribs were also nice, moist and tender. The turkey was your basic deli case style formed loaf with additives and marinade that was oozing out its un natural moisture.\\n\\nThe sides were nothing to write home about. Squash casserole was gloppy, cole slaw over dressed and undistinctive, the beans were average and the potato salad was a salt mine.\\n\\nIt was tough to dispose of the bones, charred flesh, and excess fat at $15/lb because there was quite a bit.\\n\\nAll in all I would not wait in line and pay those prices again. If I wanted proper beef back ribs I would go to Salt lick or Iron Works. If I wanted better brisket I would go to Rudy's. Otherwise the sausage and pork ribs are up to snuff here but not at these prices and the possible wait.

Some flavors we selected just to compare to Blue Star, others just looked fun. We got: maple bacon, old dirty bastard, pot hole, Mexican hot chocolate, pink lemonade (a seasonal flavor, I think?), and Portland creme. I really liked all of them expect for the pothole, that one just seemed overly sweet and lackluster. The rest were excellent. They are not as \\"gourmet\\" as Blue Star, but they were moist and not all were overly sweet. I'm giving 4 stars and I'm glad I finally made it to Voodoo. PS just get both Voodoo and Blue Star.

She fainted, faint breathing, low pulse .. anyway, we all stopped eating and turned around to see if we could help and someome asked the waitress to call 911. So she's on the phone with the paramedics, and the hostess is trying to get around the woman who has fainted to seat more people. Those people stopped and were asking if maybe they should wait to see if this woman needs help. \\nSo I was already feeling like Ok obviously this place doesn't care about anyone. \\nThen the paramedics arrive and end up taking the elderly woman with them. Her daughter got caught up by the owner or waitress, not sure which of them made this executive decision but they still wanted her to pay for the barely touched food as her mom was being carted into the ambulance!

Nope. \\nI will say the chicken pot pie was yummy and I enjoyed it as left overs later that night. My Mac & cheese and mashed potatoes? Not so much.

She casually brought them over on her own time.\\n\\nAs for the food: my friend and I split a sausage board and an animal style fries with chicken. We gobbled it up. The freshly made sausages were all unique and flavorful. The fries were reminiscent of eating a burger at an old mom and pop stand. Great food. Crappy service. I won't return to have to deal with crappy service to get to great food. There's a lot of great food in Austin."},{"name":"Stammtisch","address":"401 NE 28th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"Stammtisch in Germany means a large communal table usually reserved for local regulars & their guests. I suppose at Stammtisch it's a hint for customers to share their tables when there's a capacity crowd. \\n\\nIt's located in an up & coming, slightly bohemian neighborhood comparable to Silverlake of old in Los Angeles before full on gentrification reared its head. Stammtisch is an old brick building w/ modifications such as large french windows, tall double glass doors that open wide to create an airy openness. \\n\\nDas Essen is excellent & cooked w/ a chefly hand. The chef here has done some time in culinary school or got some fine experience at some higher end restaurant.\\n\\n1) Currywurst is like sliced grilled Bratwurst w/ not just pork but veal added in. Ketchup is infused w/ a mild yet aromatic curry powder that was simmered together to mellow out & take sharp edges off the curry.  Exemplary pommes frites that were crisp, earthy, potatoey. Way better than what I had at a Schnell Imbi√ü in the Nollendorfplatz S & U Bahnhof.  \\n\\n2)  Miesmuscheln: Kind of a Teutonic take on Moules Frites without the french fries but french bread instead to sop up the broth. The creamy, ocean meaty mussels are cooked in white wine & bit of cr√®me fra√Æche. Chopped shallots, julienned grilled, herbed Knockwurst  are scattered around for a \\"surf & turf\\" effect. \\n\\n3)  Geschmorter Hasen is like a slow cooked confit in its own fat & juices along w/ bacon to add a cured smoky undertone. Leg & hind portion where the meat falls off the bone. The juices infused in the rabbit has a wonderful meaty Umami along w/ the bacon. Chiffonade of green chives adds a tinge of onion funk to the rich meat. \\n\\nPotatoes, flash fried fingerling potatoes, can be sliced up to soak in the meat juices of the confit. The tomato tatin reminds me more of a tarte Alsacienne w/ bright red sliced cherry tomatoes & carameized onions on a thin millefeuille pastry. This dish to me was the Meisterst√ºck of our meal this time around. Just wish there might have been bitter arrugula as a garnish to act as a vegetal counterpoint to all the great meatiness. \\n\\nOrdered Rei√üdorf K√∂lsch to pair w/ the meal, but I found this K√∂lsch to be weak, flat tasting, insipid. Nothing like the great dark golden, nutty tasting K√∂lsch I drank in K√∂ln/Cologne.\\n\\nOverall Stammtisch may well be the premier source of Deutsches Essen in all of Portland. Not that it's the same food, Stamm is head & shoulders above what Jake's DTPL can ever offer. 4+ Yelp stars."},{"name":"Mary Mac's Tea Room","address":"224 Ponce De Leon Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"I visited Mary Mac's Tea Room for the first time last Saturday (1/18/14) to have lunch with my girlie and I have to say that I was very satisfied!

The place has a very nice down home feel and the decor is very nice. Mary Mac's decor is full if rich history from the pictures on the walls to the street named dining rooms. A nice gentleman by the name of Miguel waited on us and when I told him it was my first time there, he kindly explained how to order (you write down your own order on sheets provided to curb mistakes). I was also given a free sample size potluck (collard greens with cornbread that you mix together) since it was my first visit. It was awesome to be such a small serving!\\n\\nI ordered the smothered chicken along with Mac n cheese and sweet potato souffl√©. The food was DELICIOUS!!! My girlie ordered the salmon croquettes, grits, and the sweet potato souffl√©. She was very happy with her food (I tasted the croquettes and they were good!). They give a pretty good size portion and were was good and full, so we had plenty to take home for later. The wait for the food was not long (always a plus), and the waiter was very attentive to us. There was a nice older woman that worked there who was very grandmotherly. She came up to me and started rubbing my back as she spoke, inquiring if I had been there before. I told her I had not and she told me that it was good to have and that she hoped I'd be back again. It was a good rub too!! She continued to make her rounds conversing and rubbing backs of patrons as she went along. I thought that was very sweet :)\\n\\n\\nOverall I was very happy with my visit to Mary Mac's and will be returning very soon for more good Soul Food!

We had a great server and had our food ordered and delivered in good time.\\n\\nI didn't love the terrible pretzel appetizer (they apparently had the wrong shipment and our batch was not what they normally serve).  I HATED the plastic / foam plates and cups.  If you are charging a premium, it makes no sense and feels really cheap wasteful to serve food on disposable plastic and foam plates and bowls.  It doesn't fit after such a nice renovation of the building. I also was taken aback by the extra charge to try their other BBQ sauces (how do I know which sauce I like before I've tried them?). Glad I sprung for it, because I never would have known I liked Carolina. Gold the best.

The decor and layout of any Tijuana is memorable and colorful.  You have to try Tijuana Flats if you haven't already, and you should go back if you haven't been in a while.  The food is good and you will not be disappointed."},{"name":"Don Dario's","address":"8801 S I H 35","city":"Austin","stars":"3","text":"Love this place!

We have specific waitress that always comes up to us when we go in, even if we don't get sat in her section.

We got chowder everywhere we went, and this just kinda tasted like campbell's soup compared to everything else we had.  The sea scallops were about less than half the size that I'm used to having up in MICHIGAN (which makes NO sense at all!) and the lobster was even more expensive than anything we have had in Michigan.  Maybe there is a reason for that, but if there is I don't understand it.  You should be able to order some maine lobster for cheap there.  Cheap was not the forte at the Union Oyster House.  Even the oysters were more expensive than what I have had in Michigan and I hate to say it, but I have had meatier oysters in Michigan too.  \\n\\nOh well.

I have a backlog of hundreds of eateries, and several of them are 5 star...I just happened to be in front of my computer while trying these out.\\n\\nI'm not a donut lover. My brother in law is, but I'm not. Krispy Kremes are great, but I also think Dunkin Donuts isn't too far behind. That should tell you how uncivilized my donut tastes are. But, despite the disclaimer, I can assure you, I have never had better donuts than these!\\n\\nFirst is the Bacon Maple, their signature. When I heard about it, I wasn't as disgusted as most people get. Think about it, how many times have you gone to IHOP and had pancakes or french toast or something and took a bite of pancake and ate bacon at the same time? It happens often! How often has your syrup bled onto the bacon? I bet just as much. This taste really isn't a foreign concept guys; however, kudos to Voodoo for actually putting it in donut form (which is a foreign concept). The maple frosting in and of itself might have been too sweet, had it been by itself, but the salty bacon really does the job to, not even it, but compliment it. And it's not a gentle compliment either, it's not yin and yang, it's a Big Bang of flavors to really show you the impressive distance between salty and sweet.\\n\\nNext, to settle down a little, the weak link of the show, the Cap'n Crunch (I think it's called O Captain my Captain or something). It's a white frosting with Crunch Berries cereal topped on it. My Crunch Berries have definitely been out too long, because they're not that crunchy anymore. This donut was pretty unimpressive. The taste of the Crunch Berries really outweigh any other flavor, whether there was supposed to be any flavor in the dough or the frosting. The frosting merely adds more sugar to the already sweet Cap'n Crunch. I didn't not like it because it was too sweet, I didn't like it because (not-so-crunchy factor aside) it just tasted like Crunch Berries.\\n\\nNow, back to the pre-grand finale...The NO NAME donut. What made this stand out was the peanut butter. Don't think I've ever heard of anyone putting peanut butter on a donut before. Chocolate frosting, rice krispies, and a drizzle of peanut butter. Since it's a drizzle, you don' t expect too much PB taste, but man oh man, believe it or not, it's the first thing to hit you! You take a bite and you hear your teeth crunching the Rice Krispies, and you feel your teeth sliding through a good 1/2 centimeter of chocolate frosting! You go numb for a fraction of a second in anxious expectation waiting to see what you're gonna taste, and like the initial bang of a firecracker, you get the peanut butter. Then just like how you see the BOOM before you hear it, you're suddenly smacked with the super intense chocolate flavor. Right ; however, the flavor rushes in all directions sort of giving you an outline of how big this flavor is gonna be, and then right after, it colors in between the lines as the chocolate sweetness just fills everything in between. It's so sweet it hurts your teeth! After it's over, as dessert (lol), you can lick your lips and you get a quick light encore of Peanut Butter.\\n\\nAnd last but not least, the grand finale. The mega Apple Fritter. This is my benchmark. Every donut shop I goto, I make sure to get one of these. First, the thing's huge. The diameter is about 1 1/3 iPhones (the long way....it's my only measurement right now). It's at least 1.5-2 inches thick. It's heavy, and it's goodness through and through: \\n1) Coating - The sugar coating around it is thick, as it should be, and when hard, should make a nice knocking sound on the table. You should be able to tap it with your fingernail...check!\\n2) Crisp - The outer layer of this thing, since it is deep fried after all,  needs to have a slight crisp. Plus, once you're chewing it, it needs to crunch in all the places where you're getting the coating....Check\\n3) Flavor - It has to have the perfect mix of buttery inside with the sweet coating on the outside, and also a hint of apple cinnamon. \\n4) Donut Air - All the sweet donut goodness makes the air around it smell like heaven. When you cook a donut like this, you trap air inside (I'm pretending like I know what I'm talking about). When you chew a decent size portion of this, you should be able to taste and almost swallow donut air. If you don't know what I'm talking about, oh well. \\n\\nIn the end, if you don't have a sweet tooth, this may not be the place. If you don't ever like supersweet food, don't ever come here. If you have the occasional urge to gorge on decadent sugar...this is it!\\n\\nWell, I'm about to explode now."},{"name":"Thai Noodles House","address":"2602 Guadalupe St","city":"Austin","stars":"2.5","text":"they dont even worth the one star. okay, almost all of the people i heard from, they say thai noodle house has bad service...and they're wrong. they don't only have a bad service...they have the WORST SERVICE EVER.

You can walk in and order prime steak sandwiches and walk out in a few minutes. The food quality is amazing. Steak sandwiches with peppers and onions just devine. Definitely order the potatoes as well. They come with this amazing sauce to dip in as well so maybe ask for an extra container of sauce. \\n\\nThe only reason I am deducting a star is due to the fact I have eaten hear 5 times but one of the times was a disaster. Ordered medium ribeye sandwiches and potatoes. WHen I got home both ribeye sandwiches were totally raw and the potatoes were hard because they weren't cooked thoroughly. I am hoping it was just a bad cook they either trained better or fired as it hasn't happened since.\\n\\nConclusion: If you are in the area it is imperative you try out steak on fire. Absolutely delicious."},{"name":"Mary Mac's Tea Room","address":"224 Ponce De Leon Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"If I ever was forced to choose my own demise, I would choose to live in this heavenly establishment and gorge myself on their scrumptious fixins until I was too fat to go on.
