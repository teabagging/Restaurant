Specifically: the shrimp bisque had a tasty tarragon flavor but slightly too salty; foie gras torchon came with AMAZING brioche toast but the foie gras itself was also heavily-salted (I never knew you could over-salt foie gras until today); grilled trout was nicely cooked but the fish was too salty and my husband said the brown butter hollandaise tasted like creme brulee; the lamb belly with bacon mayo had a very pleasant lamb flavor but again too salty to our liking, and it definitely did not need the bacon mayo.  Even the butter came with a thick layer of salt.   The only thing that was not salty tonight was the rhubarb soda- it was extremely light with just a hint of flavor.  \\nTo be fair, normally we would have a bottle of wine to go with our dinner and it might somewhat balance the salt.  Unfortunately since neither of us felt like drinking, the food became almost too salty to eat.  \\nI believe it is a nice restaurant but based on our experience tonight, we will not go back.

The steak and cheese was veryy messy and looked like it had been thrown together in 2 seconds, the grilled chicken was okay except they forgot to put on cheese which I don't know how since I asked for it melted. I would think they had just forgotten about us but the chicken dinner was cold and the fries were soggy and wet by the time it got to us so I'm guessing it was sitting out for a while.

She's a big fan of places that are allergy conscious, and all the gluten and dairy free items and the fact that everything was so clearly labeled was a big selling point to her.\\n\\nBeing opening weekend, and lunch time on a weekend, the line was pretty long when we arrived, but it moved pretty quickly. The staff kept things moving along the assembly line which was set up similarly to one of those popular sandwich or burrito places that you all know, and some love. Pick your bases (grains/carbs), proteins, veggies, sauces and they pile it into a bowl for you. \\n\\nYou can choose two bowl sizes: a pick four, or pick six. With the four, you choose two bases, a protein, and veggie, and a sauce. With the six, you get the two bases with two proteins, two veggies, and one sauce. \\n\\nSounds great.\\n\\nThe problem is that while everything we tasted was good (all topping out at \\"pretty good\\"), most of the options just don't really go well together. The selection for bases included three different rices, romaine, kale, sweet potato noodles, sweet potato mash, or quinoa. I suppose you could probably get two of the same base, but to us at least, none of those combos SOUNDS particularly appetizing. \\n\\nThe issue compounds as you start adding veggies and proteins. I wanted a sort of Asian bowl, starting with the idea of the coconut rice and the chia seed tuna poke. The veggie selection includes broccoli, sesame green beans, buffalo cauliflower, roasted mushrooms, roasted brussel sprouts, or braised kale and beans. Sesame green beans might sort of go with tuna, but eh.. kind of a weird combination, and that's the only one that sounds like a remotely good match. But guess what - they were out of green beans. \\n\\nAll in all, the food was ok, but the portions were not particularly generous. My four-bowl left me a little hungry, and the bill for the two of us came out to about $24. \\n\\nFresh Kitchen bills themselves as \\"chef inspired food\\", and I think the easiest thing they could do to fix the problems we had would be to create suggested bowls - inspired by their chefs. \\n\\nCreate a suggested tuna bowl, or suggested tofu bowl that customers can try as a reliable combination that goes well together. \\n\\nMy wife's hype level for Fresh Kitchen went from a solid \\"OMG\\" to a solid \\"it's OK, but I'd rather go somewhere else.\\""},{"name":"Portland City Grill","address":"111 SW 5th Ave, Fl 30","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Excellent food and drinks.

Pizza seems pretty basic, and yet so many places still miss the mark.  It's about the crust, the crust, the crust.  And Cosmos' crust is delicious.  Make sure you ask them to brown the crust just a little bit on your slice of pepperoni, and you will not be disappointed.\\n\\nThe other good thing is the gargantuan size of the slices.  For around $3, you can get a slice of cheese or pepperoni that feels more like two slices.  Awesome good value if you're trying to stretch your budget.\\n\\nAnd then finally, if you want to make a meal out of it, you can go next door to the 'Cosmos Pub' (??) for a pint of local beer and a gargantuan slice for under $6.  Try the spicy ranch if you want an extra treat."},{"name":"Food 101","address":"4969 Roswell Rd, Ste 200","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3.5","text":"Fantastic--one of my new fave places!

When we were seated at a booth but switched our minds, the host was kind and moved us to a table immediately. Our waiter (PJ) was knowledgable and attentive but not over-bearing.

My initial reaction was that the portion size was small (split between two people) however it was definitely filling. It was obvious that the food was well made and that the lobster was fresh. The New England Clam Chowder was one of the specials offered and it was among the best clam chowders I've ever had. \\n\\n4th Star - The dinner menu is exceptional. For dinner I ordered the \\"Big Bowl\\" or Mussels, Clams and Sausage. The sausage was more of a pepperoni than a sausage, but the dish was heavenly and the shellfish was obviously fresh. I would have appreciated more than one piece of bread to really enjoy the sauce the shellfish was cooked in. My boyfriend ordered the Shrimp Orleans - it was out of this world. Their menu includes a lot of \\"Orleans\\" style cooking and I'd recommend all of it. The shrimp dish was perfectly seasoned, flavorful and unique.

I should preface this by pointing out that my wife had lost her Texas ID and was provided a temporary paper ID from the DPS. We are 30 years old. \\n\\nMyself and a large party were meeting up for dinner and drinks before our corporate holiday party. This would have been an 8-top party for The Park on a Sunday night. My wife and I came and sat with the rest of our party and our server came to take our drink order. When asked for her ID, my wife provided her state-issued, temporary paper copy. The server asked for a credit card matching the name and went to talk to the manager. She came back saying she couldn't accept her ID. I was also able to provide my ID with matching last name and address.\\n\\nI asked to speak with the manager and he came to our table. A genuinely unfriendly bald man with glasses. Didn't get a name. He told me that it's against the law for them to accept anything less than a valid state ID for consuming alcohol, specifically quoting the TABC. I informed him that she had just purchased a firearm using the very same ID that he was refusing for a cocktail and that it didn't make any sense. He then told me that serving of alcohol was up to the discretion of the server. What? So is it illegal or up to the server? \\n\\nThe Park management: this was pulled off of the TABC website: \\"Texas state law does not require that a person over 21 provide any identification to purchase alcohol in Texas. There is nothing in the law that declares specific forms of ID as \\"valid\\" for an alcohol purchase.\\" \\n\\nWe eat out a lot, and we spend a lot of money when we go out because we enjoy the experience. Neither myself or my wife have ever been questioned on age with a supplemented ID and a wallet full of credit cards that match. I work in hospitality and genuinely can not figure out what the motive was here. No one was drunk, no one was loud or obnoxious. Our full party hadn't even arrived yet. There was nothing that should have set off a red flag for our table. This guy was simply on a power trip and wasn't going to back down and let an 8-top that probably would have brought in $200 walk. Shame. \\n\\nI should also add that during my conversation with this manager, an employee came up to ask him a question and he physically pushed her back into the kitchen.

With Magical Dining Month currently going on, we decided to give it a try.  \\n\\nLe Coq is located in a rustic (ie. run down) cottage/house in South Orlando.  The moment you walk in the door, you are transported to what I would assume an old rustic house would look like on the French Countryside.  Pictures and artwork adorn the quaint entryway, where we are greeted by the host and the smell of the bathroom.  While the smell of the bathroom is not overwhelming, it is definitely noticeable and causes one to cover their mouth/nose as they wait for the host to walk them to their table.  The dining room is seemingly split into the sections of the rustic cottage.  I believe our party of 6 was seated in the old Living Room.  The d√©cor and personality of the room felt a bit dated, but that could also be part of the charm.\\n\\nOnce seated, we were greeted by our server.  Our server didn't seem overly enthused to be taking care of our group, and that trend continued throughout the meal.  Le Coq is sold as a \\"fine\\" dining restaurant...I think.  The level of service we received would have been appropriate elsewhere, but not here.  One guest ordered a beer and was given a beer glass that had dishwater in it.  The server said, and I quote \\"that is probably just condensation from the refrigerator, it will be fine\\".  There was easily half an ounce of water in the glass.  Another gripe I had with the service was the fact that the server didn't remember who ordered what.  At a restaurant like this, there should be no \\"auctioning\\" appetizers and entr√©e's to the table.  It takes away from the \\"fine\\" dining experience. \\n\\nAll things considered, we were all still very excited for the food.  I started with the French onion soup, which was served in a tea cup.  The soup was delicious.  I continued my meal with the \\"Tornedos\\", which was one 4-6 oz filet served with carrots and mashed potatoes.  This was ok...I ordered my meat medium rare, it was close, but not perfect.  The most noticeable grievance I have is the size of the food.  I understand that Magical Dining Month encourages people to visit restaurants they wouldn't typically visit, but this is a tremendous opportunity to attract repeat customers by providing a memorable experience.  The soup was tiny and the steak was underwhelming.  Dessert was an apple tart that is served with a scoop of ice cream.  Again, just ok.  My wife bought up to the souffl√©, which I enjoyed.  \\n\\nThe last gripe I have is that the server couldn't split our checks for us.  Three couples were seated, 1 check was given.

It was his first trip there and of course as a carnivore, he had to experience the famous Thurman burger before he died.  It snowed that night which was lucky for us as there was no wait at 6 pm when we arrived.  We got a few apps for the group, pretzel bites, and fried pickles and both were delicious-especially the sauces.  Unfortunately, the service was terrible, even though it was not busy that night.  There was an older lady serving us, she was brusk and seemed annoyed that we did not know the beers available.    Anywho, we waited a while but got our burgers about 25 minutes after ordering.  Mine was delicious, the Western Burger with bacon, cheddar, and bbq sauce cooked medium and the fries might have been the highlight for me altogether.  The are large fair fries and came with my burger which helped me make the choice.  My BF had to disassemble his burger to eat it as the ham  slid off at his first bite.  His was just okay, he was disappointed in the meat, the toppings were wonderful though.  The other members of our party ordered the turkey reuben and a Thurman as well and they were happy with their selections.  The best part was we all finished our burgers!  Unfortunately, there was no prize from the clean plate club.  The waitress finally warmed up to us as she gave us our bill, having forgotten 2 beers and never asking if we needed another one.  I have been to Thurmans many times in college and they have great food but I don't think I would go there again unless I find out the service had improved.  The other servers seemed not to care either and having to beg for a drink is hardly the way I want to spend my hard earned cash.

They do not.  It seems like most people mention Magnolia Cafe and Kerbey's for pancakes in Austin.  (A few might mention the Omelettry and Star Seeds.)  But if you cross check reviews, most people who mention any of these places seem to slightly prefer Magnolia's over Kerbey's.  (PS, I found the opposite to be true for me.)  An additional warning sign that you should take seriously is that many Magnolia Cafe reviewers will also mention how dry the pancakes are at Magnolia.\\n\\nHeed the warnings.  The pancakes are very dry.  So much so, I began trying to figure out in my own recipe how much fat I'd have to remove to make it this dry.  \\n\\nOn the other hand, the pancakes look ok.  They have a nice rise.  And they are not tough.  But these are pancakes for people who use a lot of butter and syrup.  And the butter was not the soft kind scooped out--I got two cold pats wrapped in foil.  They also have a distinct aroma--not bad--but reminding me of Japanese crepes.  I think it's a lot of baking soda?\\n\\nI also tried the \\"Love Migas\\" (migas + butter/serrano/garlic) and it was not bad.  I can say the eggs were fluffy and fresh.  If you love tons of cheese, this might be for you.  My own feeling was it's all the calories with only half the flavor, as it tasted a wee bit under seasoned.  Nothing a touch of salt or salsa can't fix.\\n\\nService was not bad--much better than I had come to expect from the Yelp reviews, although this was at 10 pm on a wednesday night.

If you're expecting to drive here you're never going to find parking in the city, we had to spend 40$ on a spot down the street and walk a few blocks to get there. So, 40$ for parking and 8$ for a family sized bowl of glorious pho. You decide.\\n\\nPersonally, this was the best tripe I've ever had in my life and even the tendon - a part I tend to avoid in pho because it's rarely served right - was absolutely perfection here. I was impressed enough to bring others as the line died down, even ran into some friends inside - apparently this is the go-to spot for people who know good pho in China Town.\\n\\nMy only complaint, if it could even be called one, is the lack of a more French menu.

Typically I arrive half an hour before they open and avoid waiting in a que for upwards of 2 hours. On this September Wednesday I actually arrived 30 minutes after they opened shop and there were ample seats available.\\n\\nFor those who read my last review, you will see I gave Neptune less than satisfactory marks for their oysters. I got three oysters this time, Wellfleet, Island Creek and Katama bay. The oysters this time around were satisfactory. A more lively taste and texture, but the Katama bay was a little dirty, not the best shuck job. I still stand by my previous review and my statement that there are superior places in Boston to get oysters.\\n\\nNow, for the entr√©e. I got a warm buttered lobster roll with fries. \\n\\nThe lobster meat itself is excellent. Very soft with a slight chew. Fresh quality with an ocean essence. Butter and light salt-pepper seasoning.\\n\\nThe brioche roll is soft and easy to handle. Squeezable, flexible so you can fit it in your mouth.  The bun is grilled giving some sear marks and complexity. However, the bottom of roll soaked up a lot of juice and began to fall apart.I think a thicker heavy duty bread might be needed here to avoid soggage. \\n\\nThe fries are satisfactory. Salty and plain. The texture is lacking. Not fluffy or chewy. Mild slight crunch, which quickly disappears as they begin to cool off and they become slightly rubbery. Potatoes are roughly peeled, leaving some skin. The skin is charred and crispy, imparting a nice complexity. But again, the textural issue makes these fries just ok.\\n\\nThe lobster roll gets a solid endorsement despite the bun issues. Otherwise, proceed with caution.

I was told about this place a few years ago but could never be bothered to go,after tonight I regret not going a long time ago. The wait,even though long is totally worth it. I attended on a Thursday night and had to wait an hour and a half to be seated. The place is cozy, you're  going to be squeezing into your seat or squeezing in at the bar. Even though the servers are busy they are very attentive and very friendly, I would not have been upset if they were a little grumpy. The food is awesome,we started with fried clams which were perfect and the homemade tater sauce was delicious. The oyster were fresh even though it was 9pm, best that I have had in Boston and that includes Island Creek Oyster Bar . The Lobster roll was everything that you have read about on Yelp or heard from your friends. The Lobster overflowed out of the bun and was so fresh and tasty, the fries that accompanied it were difficult to ignore.I was actually eating off of my girlfriends plate even though I still had food on my plate, I guess I didn't want the meal to end. I predict that I will be waiting in line at least a few more times before the summer is over and I don't mind a bit.

But, since I felt like I was treated like a complete A-hole by his staff last night, I think they and potential customers should see this. Boston Pizza is just awful, and this location may be the worst one in Canada. I only went because friends wanted to watch basketball, but I will never step foot in another BPs for the rest of my life, no matter what event I miss out on. Terrible service. Terrible food. Not one positive aspect to our (7 person) visit. Arriving to a table on a Friday night only sit there for 20 minutes, then go to the bar and grab our own menus. Server comes, no mention of \\"hey sorry I didn't bring you menus\\" and takes our order. Half rack of the ribs, which became a full rack ($25) and maybe the worst meal I've ever been served. Brought out by a different staff member than our server, who simply plunked the food on the table and marched away. It looked bad, and one of my friends stole a fry right away, only to say \\"gross, those are stale and old\\". Worse than stale old fries at McDonalds. A little cup of cole slaw that looked sick and tasted at such. And the ribs were the worst I've ever tried. I knew they were bad just by sight, but cut into the middle to try and taste the best ones. Dry, mealy, overcooked (sorry, boiled), tasteless and just bad. And, for some bewildering reason, they did not remove the membrane from the back of the ribs...so you're eating gristle with bbq basting along with really badly \\"cooked\\" meat. Their menu says \\"Super tender, oh-so-slowly roasted pork back ribs\\" but it is so obvious these are defrosted, boiled, ribs that are then basted with sauce. Disgusting. A full rack of that garbage costs $25, which is a competitive price compared to places that actually know how to cook food. Never order the ribs. I gave up on the boiled mess and waited for 20 minutes for our server to come back to our table. He arrived, didn't ask if how things were, didn't offer to get drinks for the 5-6 people with empty glasses, and almost marched away before I could say \\"hey, can you take this too?\\". As he walked by a few minutes later I flagged him to ensure he understood I was sending that mess back, not that I was done, only to hear \\"well you asked me to take it away so I did\\". He asked me if I wanted something else and when I said \\"no thank you\\" I got a snide, \\"well, ok then\\". Again, no offer of drinks for the table. For some reason the manager came by and asked how we were doing, and though tempted to just forgo answering I did speak to him. He was quite receptive and was aware of the god-awful reviews on Yelp and elsewhere. Of course they didn't charge me for my order which I wouldn't have paid for anyway, and I pointed out to him that after I sent my order back and spoke to our server, he didn't come to our table for 25 minutes (still empty glasses everywhere). I assume our server went to find a safe-space free of micro-aggression (kidding, he went to the table behind us multiple times, but avoided ours). I left my entire group of friends because it was so bad, and heard after that it took 45 minutes to get and pay their bill after finally getting more drinks. This \\"restaurant\\" is an absolute disaster. And that's on top of the fact that Boston Pizza's food is terrible on the best of nights. Do not go here.

The cheese grits tasted like instant grits with a handful of cheddar thrown into them.  You can tell there wasn't much culinary creativity or effort put into the grits.

He would let people walk right in, cut the line, and not say a thing about who/what/where/when/why that was happening. It left a bad taste in the mouths of all those who waited for their turn.\\n\\nAnyways, as far as the food and drinks go: 6 STARS!!! Absolutely delish!!! we tried a bunch of different apps like: fried calamari, casear salad, grilled shrimp, spicy wings, and fish tacos (which were actually our least favorite). For entrees we stuck to what our waitress recommnded, the scallops and short ribs. Both dishes were unreal.

We spoke to the front cashier and reiterated that we asked for triple crispy wings, and they made them over. This time they were a tad bit crispier, but not much. My wings were actually not even edible because my mild wings appeared to be sauced in the same bowl my friend's Old Bay wings were. I absolutely detest the taste and smell of old bay wings.

Warning: very large serving sizes, will do as an entree in a pinch or for lesser appetites.\\nJambalaya\\nSubtle spice that lingers but not overpowering. I am a spice fiend and usually ask for enough spice to leave me speechless but it was pleasant and did not detract from the experience. Very filling. Rice was well cooked. \\nTender shrimp, not rubbery but not quite melting. Dependant a lot on seasoning, which was excellent. \\nChewy but flavorful sausage. Maybe more than i would have preferrered but still very good addition to the mix.\\nRice well cooked \\nPortion size decivingly big, get as appetizer alongside entree if a big appitite is present. \\n\\nYusu yellow tuna \\nRaw on inside crispy on outside.\\nMid tier seared sahimi fare although bamboo and masu are best at this game, if you have steak loving friends get this if you love sushi. You may convert them.\\nHot mustard sauce best sauce. Almost wasabi like in terms of horseradish flavor but still an agreeable accompaniment.\\nGood coating of what i believe may have been grated black pepper but helped if you prefer subtle sashimi and added to the additional salsa and kimchi additions. \\nWhich of which; the fruit salsa was generic, but fresh mango was a great touch to the nearly buttery tuna- pushed it into nearly buttery territory when combined with the sauces. \\nThe kimchi was unspicy but tart which added a good touch. I am a huge kimchi fan so i understand how different kinds can appeal to different audiences. This kimchi can appeal to most i believe. More like asian inspired sourkrout than authentic kimchi but still a good addition. \\n\\nPeking duck.not the moistest nor the most interesting. Cheap though for a leg. Go to seres for a good peking duck. As an appetizer? Very fun as long as not seeking authenticity.\\nKimchi was slightly saltier it seemed than the but accompanying the sashimi but may accoubt for duck blandness.\\nBuns steamed a bit chewy but combined with the slightly dry duck worked out nicely.\\nDuck more bland but extremely edible and tender and for 15 bucks made a very fun appetizer. \\nHoisin sauce was good and inviting and smoky enough. \\nIt gets pretty dark inside, which is great if your date isnt your idea of eye candy,  but mine is so definitely ask for a table candle (or two)  \\nService took a few minutes but for the happy hour section was not bad at all. My date is a little bit older than me and often servers treat us obviously differently than couples within the same age range of which treatment we thankfullly didnt receive tonight. \\nAll in all, a little overpriced,not extremely original but still worth it for the memory and view, which, having finally hit the foggy rainy bits, is just astounding (if you ask an autumn minded person like me)."},{"name":"Neptune Oyster","address":"63 Salem St","city":"Boston","stars":"4.5","text":"I was in town for a scientific conference in 2015, and of course, obligated to explore the beautiful area, Boston.

A hidden gem. My friends were so happy that we could actually hear each other talk, that it was happy hour, and that the place had a nice, relaxing ambiance. They were shocked they had never been to this place and were so happy after the meal.\\n\\nWe ended up with fish tacos, fried clams, and the duo dip. I agree with someone else's review where the crab dip was to die for, but the other dip was just all right. The fried clams were good, and fish tacos? Amazing.

A meal reminiscent of my nadir eating experience at Blue Hills at Stone Barns.   \\n\\nBut it wasn't perfect.  \\n\\nThe restaurant itself is quite small and perhaps even a bit cramped, but the setting is warm and intimate.  Perfect for a romantic date with a fellow foodie.  Our waiter was charming and informative, attentive yet sedate.  A continental class service. \\n\\nThe meal was a parade of delights and curiousities, starting with a pre-appetizer appetizer, offered by the house, of dried black olives, strawberry chips, crusty capers, olive oil jelly cubes, and other delicious oddities spread across a small plate, all made on premises.  Oddly, it looked like random debris found on the side of the road,  LOL, but was far more delicious!   We were also offered tiny cups of soup - a pea soup with bran ash (yes burnt bran ash -  but it worked!) and a mushroom barley soup, which was creamy and saturated with mushroom flavor.  \\n\\nThe breads, also home made, were delightful, chewy,crunchy flavorful and almost not in need of butter, they were so interesting.  Especially one bread the owners called \\"The Sea\\", which incorporated seaweed in the dough.  It was astounding.\\n\\nWe chose the prix-fixe menu, which provided my companion and I the opportunity to taste three courses each, and dessert.   We started with Smoked Hen Rillettes which were basically a hash made from smoked and brined chicken, that was out of this world. This was accompanied by a sprinkling of rye berries with walnut vinaigrette, thinly sliced radish, confit lemon, black mustard, and a smoked peppercorn tuile.  We also shared a salad of Spring root vegetables, which included fresh greens, an unbelievable handmade Burrata, shaved purple asparagus, and other unidentifiable root veggies, dressed in a poached egg vinaigrette, and fiddleheads! -- all delicious.\\n\\nSecond course was a Taleggio cheese custard in a chestnut flour, shortbread crust, with fennel, seared polenta, a sprinkling of chewy wheat seeds and again, a spray of unidentifiable vegetables to flourish the presentation.  If anything I would say the Chef has a tendency to over-load the presentations with too many ingredients, fine and unusual as they may be.  \\n\\nWas not crazy about the Warthog Wheat Spaghetti (if you read my reviews, you already know I'm not easily wowed by pasta - it just doesn't appeal to me that much - it's just starch, you know?) but loved the soft-Poached Farm Egg that came with it,  Again, all of it festooned with a pile of tiny and precious, odd veggies.\\n\\nThe third course lacked pizazz, in both of our opinions.  The Chicken Galantine and waffles with beans featured the most tender and succulent chicken, with tart,  burnt skin and moist, flavor rich flesh, but the waffles and beans accompaniment struck us both as a little coarse in flavor, and heavy.   The Sicuate Monkfish with fennel and mint leaves was also lacking in character, though if you wrapped a monkfish bite in a bit of mint leaf, which was very fragrant and sharp, it rescued the fish nicely .  I've only ever had a successful Monkfish preparation at Odeon in Manhattan, and I have ventured to try it many times, even to make it at home.  It's a tough fish to make well.\\n\\nAdored the wine we selected, which was a Sancerre, not too dry, but rich in flavor with a citrusy note - good for cutting through the myriad and diverse flavors.\\n\\nDessert consisted of a homemade Strawberry semi-freddo and a trio of home-made ice creams: peanut butter, buttermilk with thyme, and crunchy chocolate, accompanied by some excellent, strong coffee.\\n\\nBy the end, we were vanquished!  Comatose!   We enjoyed the meal immensely, despite our little criticisms, and would probably venture another visit, only this time foregoing the prixe fixe and choosing only two courses."},{"name":"La Posada","address":"505 Medford St","city":"Somerville","stars":"4","text":"I have ordered from this place three times so far.

It was cozy and gave us a little privacy, so it might be treat for couples out on a date night, although they only had one, so romance-seeking lovers may need to get there early to grab it. The other tables were larger, for parties of 4-6, so theres room to bring friends as well.\\n\\nLet's start off with our \\"appetizers\\", which for us was sushi. We got the standards, spicy tuna and spicy salmon. Now, my usual go-to sushi to test the quality is always the eel, but I didn't wanna fill up and miss out on the korean main course, so we kept it simple. The sushi was fresh and tasty, but definitely not the star of the show. I would come back for the sushi again, however, so its by no means a slouch.\\n\\nBefore the rest of the food came out, the waitress dropped off 8 or 10 tiny plates of side dishes, with things like pickled carrots, kimchee, some kind of preserved egg, and lots more. They were interesting, but some of them were hit or miss. I'll chalk this up to personal taste and leave it at that. \\n\\nThe Girlfriend ordered herself a Spicy Kimchee Soup, and I got the Beef Bokeum. Her soup came out in a very interesting looking mini hotpot, which thrilled her. Then came my beef - A pile of perfectly cooked, thinly sliced beef, with carrots, onions (regular and green) and peppers. It was delicious. I was already full halfway through the plate, but couldn't stop eating.\\n\\nPrices were decent - A little higher than I expected, but I believe the intention is to order things to share with others, which is not what we did. We wanted to feast, and we did. Overall, It's no more than I'd expect to pay on any other \\"date night\\".\\n\\nPortions were more than ample. The Girlfriend couldn't even finish her soup, and although I crushed the beef, I left a sad graveyard of onions, carrots, and peppers that I was just too stuffed to keep eating (and I would have).

The shellfish may not have been prepped  well enough.   We sat next to people who tried both the cold and hot lobster rolls and found the cold better if you added more mayo.  They had the clams and also found grit in their dish.   I guess we expected spectacular food given the hype.  There are better places out there in our opinion.

Based on some of the other reviews I steered clear of the fusion menu so I can't speak to that. My cocktail was 100% alcohol... which is cheaper in the long run but harder to drink. So all in all, very strange."},{"name":"Pine State Biscuits","address":"2204 NE Alberta St","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"Location- small, clean, and eclectic decor.\\nStaff- They has one friendly wait staff.

She was fussing at customers to close door even though the have a patio with the full door open into the restaurant. She was shouting at patrons to get in a straight line. For our first visit it was very unfriendly and unwelcoming. \\n\\nFood- Large portions, over salted everything. We ordered quite a variety. Even the cinnamon bun was extremely salty, grits too salty, hash brown heavily salted with bacon on top- salt on salt. Tomato's too salty. \\n\\nThe Reggie was good and not too salty thankfully. \\n\\nKetchup tasted old and had aftertaste. Not sure if it was an unclean bottle or if it was a special made ketchup.

We also couldn't decide between the platter or wrap... so we ended with the baguette.  The two main issues I had were the bread and toppings were a bit overpowering.  The baguette was delicious (and apparently from a bakery in Tucker), but thick and crusty.  The Indian has a cucumber salad as a standard topping and I could pretty much only taste the cucumber salad, bread and a hint of curry.  The chicken kinda got lost.  The Mexican was better, but the sauce was very spicy.  I like spicy food, but some might be turned off by this.  Again though, it was at the forefront, not the chicken.  I plan on giving them another try, but next time getting the chicken as a salad, wrap, or platter, and holding the cucumber salad if I get the Indian again."},{"name":"Neptune Oyster","address":"63 Salem St","city":"Boston","stars":"4.5","text":"My favorite seafood place in the world.

The place was a little emptier than I would hope for but it was a Tuesday night!\\n\\nFor drinks we went with #nostalgia and split a large form hurricane bowl (Pat O'Brien's, anyone?) which obviously tasted nothing like alcohol, as it should, and was delicious. Disclaimer that we got WAY more food than we needed, but we just wanted to try it all! We split the crawfish mac and cheese and garlic fries for apps - the mac was tasty, pretty creamy, but just okay, but the garlic fries were FIRE. Will be getting those when I return. Only comment on the fries is that the bottom of the dish is drenched in a puddle of oil and/or butter making the last 25% of the fries inedible. We then split a broil that we built, which was snow crab legs, mussels, and andouille sausage with the signature bootleg sauce, which is basically garlic butter with cajun kick. It was a little spicier than we intended, but did get the job done. The food was a little overpriced, but I suspect if you came with a larger group (maybe 304?) pricing wouldn't be as steep. \\n\\nAll in all while the food isn't the best cajun food I've ever had, this spot has a nice atmosphere and is different than most of the food you get in Boston, so it's definitely worth a trip."},{"name":"Taco Cabana","address":"9605 Research Blvd.","city":"Austin","stars":"2.5","text":"Not much unexpected from this Taco Cabana.

The food here is incredible, especially so coming from a place that has so many other high quality restaurants to compete with. \\n\\nThe Charcuterie Board was so strong coming out of the gate. It came had a lot going on on the plate, with a Chicken Liver Mousse, Pork Rillettes, Scotch Egg, Pork Tenderloin and Pork Terrine, all of which were great on their own, but the fact that you got a plate with them all together AND that they helped complement various salty, savory, umami aspects of each other made the board pretty spectacular.\\n\\nThe Grilled Pork Shoulder was equal parts tender, moist and savory complemented with an apricot mustard that gave a great well rounded blend of fruity sweet with porky meat. This up a classier version of pork and yams, now crank up the degree of taste and you should get the picture.\\n\\nThe Cassoulet  was this duck and pork sausage concoction that looked appetizing for 3 moments: when I saw the description, when i saw the plate as it came out, and when I was already half way done without realizing I'd been eating so much of it so fast. To be fair, meats are a weak point for me, but the duck and pork played well shining off the different aspects of the types of meat and while not being too meat-flavor-centric. \\n\\nThe Butterscotch Creme Brulee is definitely a must get.

After having had a few minutes to initially look over the menu, we were greeted by our waiter, Adam (quite nice and a striking resemblance of David Tenant / Doctor Who).\\n\\nMy fianc√© ordered a PKK, and I asked for our waiter's recommendation between it and the Donna Grande; he said the Donna Grande was a more traditional brunch option and suggested we get different ones and share (which we did). Having tasted both drinks, we both agreed the PKK was better (it was also 1.5x the price, but I think it was equivalently better). Next we ordered the Carbonara and the Penne Arrabiata (no pancetta).\\n\\nOur waiter asked if we would like a starter and recommended the caprese salad (I sometimes enjoy a good caprese and my fianc√© was game). It was TERRIBLE--absolutely no flavour: it consisted of 2 (maybe 3) quartered tomatoes, the most bland mozzarella I've ever had (I might be a bit bias growing up near a famous Italian district back in the States), almost no basil, and seemingly no sea salt (or dressing?). The only thing either of us tasted in the caprese was the black pepper the food-runner grounded for us. On top of the poor plating and the abysmal lack of flavour, I felt a bit betrayed by our waiter for his unsolicited recommendation. I cannot recommend enough that you avoid this disappointing and heinously expensive dish.\\n\\nMy fianc√© said the Carbonara was quite good (but not in the best-ever range) and was a good portion-size. My Arrabiata was okay: visibly the portion-size was the same, but as penne is hollow, looks are deceiving, and it was not sufficient. The predominant flavours of it were shallot and basil (pleasant, not overpowering); from what I could tell there was no pecorino whatsoever (a shame as I am a big fan). Also, the pasta near the edge of the bowl was a little luke-warm, but the pasta at the centre was sufficiently hot enough to heat the rest by mixing them together so I did not mention it to our waiter. I was pleased to have our food brought by the chef himself.\\n\\nWe felt the time taken for items to arrive was longer than expected but not unreasonable--perhaps a few extra minutes during what seemed to be a relatively average level of patronage. However, to my appreciation, my water glass was frequently refilled and never empty.\\n\\nWe had planned ahead of time to go elsewhere for dessert (Marble Slab Creamery).\\n\\nI had looked at photos of the food before-hand, yet I was still disappointed by the plating (food presentation).

Balancing need with form, a glassy status of the modern with the comfy environs of the old, the city's future with its past, this new setup adds excitement as well as space while maintaining the familiarity for habitual museum visitors like myself.\\n\\nThe new wing is on the eastern side where the sculpture garden once sat. Named after the family that gave the largest donation, the Walter Wing features large spacy lofts with crystal bright lighting and fluid versatility. It is really nice. From the outside the wing looks sci-fy, the second story overhanging the first, looking much like the rear rocket of a lego spaceship with a nine-by-nine array of glass planes framed by long green metallic bricks.  \\n\\nThe entrance is still in the back, near the revamped parking--free like the muesum on Sundays. The new lobby features a spacy atrium between the new Walter and older Ross Wings. A clean stairway with a glass rail rises up to the second floor. The endeavor glass works with their wormy shapes and candy colors float above. A copper wall brings a richness to the space. The eastern wall of the old Itailian Renaissance Revival building is embedded in the new, creating an interior wall reminding me of Ohio Stadium after its renovations earlier this century. \\n\\nI am happy that some of the charm of the old was kept. The rooms in Ross still maintains the quiet contemplation that seem to eminate off the marble floors.  There's improvement here too, including new beautiful molding at the Broad Street lobby, and new paints in its hall, highlighting the arching ceilings. The lovely center sun room remained smartly untouched with its neo-deco magnetism. \\n\\nThe new environs come with a new Cameron Micheal cafe which I didn't try. The gift shop is also improved. It seems like a more comfy Apple Store with chairs, than the 'field trip' stop it did in the past. The museum maintains its interactive focus with games, novelties, and fun on the first floor, as well as token voting in the exhibition rooms. \\n\\nThe sculpture garden is now out back and is larger. I'd imagine that more will be done with the plot in the future. \\n\\nIn all what a wonderful improved space, one that I look forward to seeing events, exhibits, and the 10,000 art work owned by the CMA."},{"name":"U-Sushi","address":"1393 Beacon St","city":"Brookline","stars":"4","text":"Great sushi and great service!

You know the stories.  They are not told in this town.\\n\\nIn Austin, the stories go like this: blockchain conference next weekend, brother, you there?; real estate coffee breakouts tomorrow A.M., you there?; Capital Factory singalong with the bald guy sucking the Future Army's dick, HH after - The Grove, my treat - great see you there; AFS anime special - hellz yes?; HAAM party, maybe that cute lead singer from that band will be there - purple smiley devil face?; the thing at the W with the big walk-in bathrooms, you know what's up, queen; the other thing at the condo with Rajit after; Franklin's, you know James Beard award winning FRANKLIN, the guy who, judging from the movie Chef, literally has no capacity to think about or talk about anything but beef - just look at the way he stares porky Favreau down as the guy just CHOMPS down some brisket \\"in character\\", yeah, THAT Franklin - his new project, table for 4, 8 PM, let's Uberpool; and of course, burgers - girl you know I love my Hopdaddy's (we spank our buns and they like it lol I love naughty inferences I like to think about fucking when I eat a 12 dollar slab of ahi tuna with lettuce and a bun) but let's talk about the real burger ass deal.\\n\\nIf you are sane, you are reeling from the mad drivel coming out of these demoniacal mouths.  There is something serious inhuman about the average Austinite, not the least their endless comparison fetish for burgers.  \\n\\nMoonie's comes up in the eventual \\"Best Burger\\" roulette game of average conversation.  Heralded as the best burger this side of the Rockies.

A corner store shanty is next  door, greedily guarding precious parking spots from being used by the burger seeker.  The place is a straight shot, reminiscent in buildout of a cheap taco joint.  You walk in, do an obesity check, and order.  One cannot eat this kind of food frequently without doing obscene amounts of labor to work it off, or your joints will grow in short time to loathe the host to mass you have become.  Of course, with a place that advertises for PT and FT cashier's and cooks and also plays the kind of soulless jukebox \\"friendly oldies\\" crap the wise in soul know to despise, you cannot trust the appearances.  Get in, get out.  Don't linger.  Don't make friends.  If you must order anything, get the Californian, or just a classic (cut the mayo).  Understand that this business does not understand yet how to make a webpage work, since their many branches do not share a menu, and the only menu on their main site is for a Cedar Park location.

There's nothing here.  You can write your name or draw a dick on a piece of paper on the wall.\\n\\nOr you can just walk out, and perhaps that's best, without ordering - and don't turn on the radio, either; maybe you can learn something about yourself in the ensuing quiet trip looking for something else before deciding it's better to just skip dinner tonight."},{"name":"Waves Coffee House","address":"100 - 900 Howe St","city":"Vancouver","stars":"2.5","text":"They have a $2 latte promo right now!\\n$0.60 for a flavour shot.

We (a family of four adults) arrived at 5:00 pm to get on the waiting list. Our trip to Tasty N Alder was highly anticipated and was to be one of the highlights of our trip to Portland. At 5:30 pm, we were seated; Tasty N Alder was full and had a queue. We were excited and hungry, and were anticipating an enjoyable meal.\\n\\nOrder (mostly facts):\\n* Draft beer\\n* House Made Pasta with black truffles & parmesan \\n* Bulgogi Short Ribes [sic] Brandt with house kimchi  \\n* Farro Risotto with sous vide vegetables \\n* Veal T-bone  Plume de Veau \\n* Cowboy Skirt Steak   Creekstone\\n\\nHits (facts and opinions):\\n+ Young and hip ambiance.\\n+ Draft Beer was excellent (sorry, cannot remember the name).\\n+ House Made Pasta: texture and consistency of pasta were such that I believe that the pasta was truly house-made; came with bits of black truffles.\\n+ Skirt Steak dish was undercooked; Tasty N Alder replaced it without a fuss and, in the end, did not charge us for the dish (I did not ask it to be removed from the bill).\\n\\nMisses (facts and opinions):\\n- hard wooden seats with no cushion.\\n- Tasty N Alder charged us $4 for a basket of bread (several slices) and a few cheap butter packets even though Tasty N Alder on-line menu shows \\"Bread n Butter\\" to be $1.\\n- House Made Pasta dish had only two flavors - salt and cream; I could not taste the truffles or any flavor other than overwhelming salt and cream.\\n- Bulgogi Short Ribs Brandt: some burnt pieces; much of the ribs was just fat; we ate less than half of the order; least salty compared to other dishes but still salty.\\n- Farro Risotto: again, only two overpowering flavors - salt and cream; ate about a third of the Risotto dish by mixing it with rice (see below).\\n- Another $4 charge for a small bowl of plain white rice (my attempt at making the Risotto dish edible to me by diluting the salt with plain rice; partially successful).\\n- Veal T-bone steak: one flavor that took over the bland meat - salt; my chivalrous (and hungry) son ate most of the steak.\\n- Cowboy Skirt Steak (a story follows): The steak was ordered at medium temperature. It came to our table burnt on the outside with raw inside. We could see that it was undercooked for the steak was already sliced. We requested more time on the grill for the meat (the dish was untouched). Our waitress told us that no meat goes back on the grill but they would make another plate of the same order. Some minutes later, new dish was brought. The new steak appeared to be cooked per our request. My hungry daughter ate two small pieces of the steak but could not continue saying that it is salty. I tried a piece of the steak but spat it back out. The steak was beyond salty. I am at a loss to even find an appropriate adjective to express the extreme saltiness of the steak. Acrid? Briny? Oversalted? Offensive? None of these words is adequate to express the acuity of the salty taste of the steak. The steak was inedible to me and even to my son who braved the salty Veal T-bone steak. Other portions of the skirt steak dish, e.g. beans, were also salty but not as salty as the steak. I do not know whether this was their typical fare or this was the cook's response to having the (first) skirt steak dish brought back to the kitchen.\\n\\nOther Notes (facts and opinions):\\n= Our table had two carafes of water; tasted like tap water; I did not ask whether or not it was tap water.\\n\\nFinal Thoughts (mostly opinions):\\n+ Good place for people who would like to take care of much of their annual intake of salt at one meal. (perhaps the restaurant should consider serving a slab of salt in place of a steak; this will save time and money, and they will not need to pretend that they are actually serving steak).\\n- Did I mention that every dish that we ordered was salty? And the skirt steak was inedibly salty?\\n- We left; some of us still hungry and having lingering bitter taste in our mouths, both literally and figuratively.\\n/"},{"name":"Lamplighter Brewing","address":"284 Broadway","city":"Cambridge","stars":"4","text":"This space is a cafe in the morning and microbrewery by early afternoon.

If you read FB's blog (which you should) you will know that he is a tough critic and I was looking forward to having his opinion as part of this series. It wasn't hard to grab a table, in fact, I was surprised to see how empty it was, though it was a weeknight. \\n\\nEverybody's has two sections of pizzas - the regular and the \\"Pizza Crisps\\", which are their very thin 13 pizzas. While the latter option sounded intriguing we ended up going with two medium regular pizzas - one cheese and one \\"Everybody's\\" (aka supreme). This was plenty of food, so I ended up having a lot of leftovers.\\n\\nI am not a huge fan of this style of pizza. The dough is very thick and cake like, and it was slightly undercooked. The sauce was sparing and unmemorable. There was more cheese than is usually necessary, but it kinda worked out with this size/thickness of slice. The plain cheese was the better of the two pizzas to me. \\n\\nWhile I don't have an extremely positive opinion of the pizza I tried that night, I must say that an affinity to this pizza may be purely stylistic. One of the blind tasters of my leftovers was actually a big fan of this style of dough, but the dough was the largest complaint from two others. Also, I tasted one of the reheated slices and I think the dough got a little bit better after some more time in the oven. \\n\\nI'm not extremely eager to go back, though I don't want to paint too ugly of a picture because I think there are plenty of people that could get down on this pie. You just have to like a very thick crust and lots of cheese, and I think there are probably plenty of people that are happy to accommodate that request. For those of you like me that like a thinner, crispier style, maybe the Pizza Crisper is the way to go. Anyone have any comments on those?\\n\\nRegardless of scores, Everybody's is a pretty fun atmosphere, is in a great location, our server was very friendly, and I enjoyed the company so I ended up enjoying my visit."},{"name":"Cafe Allegro","address":"12386 SW Main St","city":"Tigard","stars":"3","text":"Ok so let's be clear. I rarely hate a place so much that I bother to write a review for it. This is one of those places. I read the reviews before I went, and since they were mostly favorable I decided to get the Groupon deal and go. The service was fine, the place was hard to get to bc of construction, but again, fine. The food is my only complaint, but since I went there to eat I feel like it's a major one. We went on a Saturday middle of the day, and after we ordered I would bet my life that the sound I heard from the kitchen was the waitress starting a microwave. The food was lukewarm, tasted horribly like leftovers from the back of my own fridge (this is why I go out to eat), and was covered in gravy and cheddar cheese.  Let's be clear: I am no food snob. Not at all. But this was gross. I had the chicken and meatball risotto, and may I plead with you to never make this same mistake? My husband had something with squash and cheese and more gravy and chicken. Sounded great on the menu, but seriously. Don't do it.

I don't get what people are saying about their employees being rude. I have only had one bad experience and it was on a Friday night when they were really busy and my pizza showed up with the box smashed into a few of the slices. I called and the manager, Vane, (sorry I know I had to have spelled that wrong) was really friendly and gave me a credit for a free pie the next time, which was awesome because I had already waited like an hour and definitely didn't want to wait for them to send out another pizza.

There are 4 sauces available, all of which are good (I personally find the best combination is Jerk Beef with the Vinegar Sauce: it was incredible). They offer a variety of ribs, including an appropriately well-seasoned Memphis dry-rub that can't be matched in New England. The one thing I'd like a little more of is the smokey flavor you get with good pit smoked BBQ - this BBQ is cooked on a grill, not in the pit. \\n\\nIn speaking of the sides, many people gripe about the corn bread. It is not sweet, and is a little dry... but that's exactly how real Southern cornbread is made (sweet cornbread is an abomination). If you aren't using your dry cornbread to sop up collard greens and bean juice, you're doing it all wrong. All sides I found were the best Southern sides outside of the south, save only the Okra which was somewhat run-of-the-mill. \\n\\nRAVES: Amazing Beer Selection.

We got there around 6:15 last Friday night, and by sheer dumb luck, we managed to get the last two open seats, next to another couple.  Is it kind of awkward to sit at a table with people you don't know?  Yes.  But sacrifices must be made for a delicious meal, and I can say with confidence that it was worth it.\\n\\nWe started with a half dozen oysters, which were silky and delicate.  I loved the little sheet that described the way each one tasted, which made ordering easier for oyster n00bs like me and my boyfriend!  For our entrees, we both ordered the hot buttered lobster roll.  HEAVEN.  My question: why don't other places do lobster rolls like this?  Make no mistake, there's nothing wrong with the mayonnaise version, but the hot butter is such a lovely change!  I just don't see why Neptune has a monopoly on this.

You will never notice the venue at first sight.  Literally it's in the middle of Peachtree (the quiet part if there ever was one on Atlanta's main street)  It looks like it's in an old folks home when you get out the car and go into the lobby.  It's really misleading and will throw you off.  The thing is you can't see the ristorante from the street level even if you were walking.  It's an elevator ride away to the bottom. \\n\\nThe host greets you, blah blah blah.  Very positive as one should at any establishment.  The dining area is very cozy.  It is almost perfect in that aspect.  No wonder the place is always booked up because the seating is limited.  It almost looks like a hooked up furnished basement as far as space, the bar area, patio, etc. Nothing over the top, pretty simple to say the least.   \\n\\nAtmosphere is a cross between established couples and business colleagues.  The attire is a collar shirt, tie (optional), sports jacket (optional).  Definitely a place to bring the Mrs!  Don't bring no regular chick, don't bring no jumpoffs, don't bring no side chicks. If you just meet a female out in the city, yall exchange numbers or whatever.  You know how thirsty Atlanta can be.  Lot of women will try to hit a homerun on the first date.

I hammered them, straight heat seek destroyed them.  I guess I was kind of hungry at that moment.  They have an excellent wine list.  I prefer Merlot at the Ristorante.   The calimari was delicious.  It was not fried and it sat in a green juice/sauce.  Excellent! Excellent!  For my entree, I had the Quaglie Arrosto Farcite con Salsicce Italiane.  Basically it was some banging @$$ quail with stuffed sausage inside surrounded by a pool of Balsamic Vinegrette.  It looked like two roasted baby tweety birds.  Plus they provide you with the knife that looks like what Sharon Stone had in fatal attraction.  I guess if you going to \\"murder\\" some food, provide you with the baddest knife they had in the drawer. In addition, it was mixed in with polenta which tastes like a cross between upgraded grits and potatoes.  Impressed what they brought to the food front!\\n\\nI thought my waiter kinda sucked to be honest with you.  Pretty slow.  My initial order was taken by another waiter which is probably got a star deducted.  \\n\\nOverall, I'm a fan! I will return in the future.  The food was banging.  It is kind of pricey.

The wait for seats is not the problem- there are plenty of places in the area to enjoy a drink or snack before your table is ready. \\nThey don't take reservations, but you can go early in the afternoon to put your name down.

Would they hold it for 10 minutes (like some places in NYC do) or until you decide to waltz in? And what is their policy if I missed the call? I missed the call but called them back and no one picked up. They finally picked up when my friend called them back a few times frantically since we have already waited over 3 hrs for this much anticipated meal.

We ordered the littlenecks and sausage app and it was pretty disappointing.  Small, dry littlenecks and a few chunks of sausage that sort of looked like hotdogs.  After that warm-up I thought \\"they can improve from here.\\". Improve they did.  My friend got the trout, which was perfectly prepared and tasty, while I got the lamb shank.

I have a feeling peoples' impression of this place shifts dramatically based on the time of day they visit along with their reason for going, but for me it just came across as over-priced and over-pretentious, without really offering up much of the one thing I went there for, the view. Add to that dissatisfaction an abundance of annoying patrons (one of the few places I wasn't impressed with the characters that comprise this fascinating city), and my experience was quite short lived.\\n\\nEven from the fa√ßade (http://www.flickr.com/photos/wedoitforlove/4327109878/), Portland City Grill is an imposing presence, towering over the rest of the nightlife below. The ambiance screams of exclusive \\"city club\\" which may be why I dislike it so much, as I've never been a big fan of this style, even when it's well deserved. However, note that if you do go for this type of thing, that it's pretty much all an illusion. It's no more exclusive than McDonald's, as there were families with kids dining right next to what appeared to be hookers in heels, and high schoolers out somehow occupying several prime sections next to the windows. The biggest annoyance for me though came in several of the patrons who continued to talk to me long after my interest had waned, due primarily to their overly drunken state (which at around 8:30 was either impressive or disturbing). One guy even tried to get me to hook-up with his date, just to prove some point to her, of which I cannot imagine. Now, I've never been one to necessarily associate some bad clientele with the business in which they occupy, but I can definitely make an exception here, as it happened on multiple occasions in the short time span in which I was present.\\n\\nAs for the actual bar / restaurant itself, I opted obviously for the bar portion. The bar menu was unimpressive to say the least, and unbelievably overpriced for the few options available. I almost felt bad for one of the guys next to me who actually chose to eat dinner here, wound up ordering 2 dishes that came to over $30, and got a couple miniscule plates delivered. The beer selection is pretty much a joke, but at least there was a nice selection of wines (http://www.flickr.com/photos/wedoitforlove/4326403325/) to choose from. Given my obvious proximity to some of the best Pinot Noir in the world right now, I decided to go with a glass of Panther Creek. The pour was modest (http://www.flickr.com/photos/wedoitforlove/4327115728/), although I was mostly disappointed in their use of improper glassware, especially in a state which is renowned almost entirely for this one grape. As for the wine itself, it was fine, but not quite what I had hoped for at $13 a glass, although this was soon rectified by yet another random annoying guy who bought my drink in order to impress his woman after some brief conversation we had about weightlifting. I guess I can tolerate listening to idiot men speak if it means they buy me drinks...this must be what it's like to be a single woman dating in DC.\\n\\nThe view, really the only reason I chose this place over a multitude of other venues, was forgettable at best. I'm not sure whether Portland just doesn't have much to look at in general from a cityscape perspective (not meant to be an insult) or that it's just masked at night, but I really wasn't impressed at all, especially when that's supposed to be the main drawing point here. The pictures (http://www.flickr.com/photos/wedoitforlove/4327278128/) did unfortunately come out a bit too blurry to draw any observations from them, mainly due to the glare off the glass, so it's a bit hard to express just how mediocre the sights were, but it seemed to just be a collection of small buildings (http://www.flickr.com/photos/wedoitforlove/4326401245/), with very few things standing out with any significance. \\n\\nThere's no doubt this is a classy place, and I'm sure it would be the perfect place for many occasions. Going solo as a guy on a random Sunday night, however, is certainly not one of those.

I don't go as often as I used to but probably still get in every couple of months.\\n\\nService here has always been variable with periods of rain, sun and wind. I think it kind of depends on the day, the crowd (there's always a crowd), and whether the waiter was recently traumatized by a 10-top of tourists all going \\"ummmm, errrrr\\" over the menu for 30-plus minutes. (I have seen this happen. It's not pretty.) Usually the service is super-quick, but there was a period in 2007 (perhaps their blue period, who knows?) where I sat and waited, waited, waited for service. Lately though, they've been hustling people in and out so fast the hostess looks a bit dizzy.\\n\\nBut the food -- I've never been disappointed. Pho Pasteur is a solid standard in Chinatown. You know you're going to get good, and sometimes outstanding, food. Especially pho, of course.\\n\\nMy current fave is the pho with chicken; nice and hot, with plenty of flavor in the broth and lots of chicken. A couple weeks ago I tried their crispy tofu -- another winner, lightly fried and bite-sized with peanut sauce on the side.\\n\\nSo yeah, there's other pho places in Chinatown.

Not a good sign for a Mexican restaurant, though the outdoor seating was mostly filled on a semi-nice spring day. If we hadn't been meeting somebody here, we probably would not have stayed.\\n\\nThings didn't get better. We were told to sit wherever we wanted, so joined the people at a table outside. It took quite a while for us to be brought menus and water. After reading the happy hour menu we decided on a chili relleno, chips & salsa and chicken wings along with iced tea.\\n\\nOur relleno arrived first, and it was very bland. Not sure why they thought placing grilled onions and green peppers was a good idea for a relleno. We ordered the cheese-filled and there was not much in the way of cheese inside, though the chili itself wasn't too bad and was lightly battered.\\n\\nWhen the chips & salsa were bright next (we actually thought that they'd probably arrive first as you really don't have to cook those as opposed to a relleno), that was when our iced tea arrived, too. Got to say, these were the most flavorless chips we have experienced in a Mexican restaurant, as if they had been taken from a bag. The salsa seemed to be chipotle flavored and was chopped very thinly and also didn't not give much flavor. And the fact that we had to pay $1.30 for them on the happy hour menu didn't add much to the impression we were already being handed. We didn't even eat half the basket brought.\\n\\nThe chicken wings arrived next. Overly covered in a sauce that was definitely not very spicy as we had requested. Four battered sections (which was not a surprise because it was on the happy hour menu), but they were fairly cold when they arrived. Our iced teas were empty when they arrived, so we asked for more. One was brought back and we had to ask two more times before the second came. When it did, it was warm enough that the ice melted right away and had a lime while the others were served with lemon.\\n\\nService left a lot to be desired, even though as I said the restaurant was far from filled. The waiter argued with the table next to us. When our check arrived, the relleno was $2.00 more than what the happy hour menu stated. When asked, the waiter said that prices changed often (??) and he would check. That was sorted out and corrected, but still this was a very unpleasant visit.

Plus it promotes vegetable-eating (even if said vegetables are soaked in bacon fat or deep-fried)."},{"name":"Tasty n Alder","address":"580 SW 12th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"High quality food but be prepared for tapas pricing.

A crew of about 12 of us met at American Craft for some tasty brews, hugs, and boisterous catching up. We were having a grand old time. We were loud but relatively well behaved, isolated in the back bar. It was about 11:30 when the bartenders asked us to go to the front part of the bar so they could close that area down. However, there was no place for us to stand in the front of the bar, as we were such a large party. As the designated driver (and hands down the soberest of the bunch), I asked if they could simply close down the bar and we could walk over to the front bar if we needed more drinks. They said no. As we couldn't stand anywhere else, we had to leave. American Craft lost a ton of money, as not only do we drink a lot (minus the designated of course!), we also tip well. They cut our night short, and it could have been epic.\\n\\n2) Tonight. Came in with a few friends (with overlap from the Christmastime experience) for what we hoped would be a nice evening filled with dinner and drinks. We asked the hostess for a table. Her response, \\"actually the restaurant is really busy right now, we won't be able to seat you for 45 minutes.\\" Well, sure, the bar area and the few tables in the front area ARE full. But you have a whole back area that isn't open! Can't we sit there? No? It's a Wednesday night, and the wait time is 45 minutes? No thanks, American Craft. You have a huge space but refuse to let people come in. You just lost out on 5 dinners and a crapload of drinks.\\n\\nWith all the beers and the location, I had higher hopes. We just want to pay you, American Craft, in exchange for goods (beer) and services (bring us beer). Yet you don't seem to want that. My friend who was with me in both experiences labeled the joint as \\"off putting.\\" I completely agree.

The portions here are significantly smaller than NY such that most people should just order their own bowl.\\n\\nWe came during major renovations. It looks like they'll be expanding their space quite a bit which is a welcome change. The current layout would only accommodate about 10-15 people for seating. It seemed like most people were ordering for to-go.\\n\\nParking here was pretty difficult. we only saw 2 spots in the front and a couple on the side.

You can make reservations or just show up and expect a wait, which gives you the perfect opportunity to get to know the bartenders who will help you to find a perfect glass of wine. Seriously, their bartenders and servers are so well versed on their craft, that they take annual retreats for further education. I've very rarely met a wine at Murphy's that wasn't supurb. \\n\\nThe ambiance is very relaxing. Whether you choose to sit at the bar for a more personal and informal experience or opt to sit on either the covered patio or in the dining room itself, there's not a bad seat in the house. Rustic and homey ambiance placates the entire space. \\n\\nService is always wonderful. And servers have become some of our favorite friends that we love to see when we eat out. \\n\\nThe food? Well, it's pretty epic as well. Now, you're not going to have your mind blown (unless the pork shank is on the menu, in which case, close your app and order it immediately -- more on that in a sec) but you will have a wonderfully prepared dish. \\n\\nFor starters, the mussles or flatbread are easy favorites. The mussles, cooked in a beer reduction with onions and finderling potatoes are served with a smoked orange you squeeze over your shells and adds a beautiful layer of depth to the broth. The flatbread rotates, but is always a good bet and frequently serves as lunch for me. \\n\\nMurphy's fish is my favorite - whether you opt for salmon, GA Trout or snapper, expect the fish to be perfectly pan seared with a yummy crispy skin and garnished with a lovely sauce and additions ranging from polenta cakes to brocollini. \\n\\nMeat dishes are also very well done. Meatloaf: yes, steak: yes, guinness braised roast: yes, crispy fried port shank: HELL YES BETTER GET THIS THING INTO MY MOUTH HOLE IMMEDIATELY. Ok, so the crispy pork shank is basically this giant piece of pork leg served on the bone and braised in all sort of yummy before being flash fried to crisp it up. Usually comes with some sort of delicious roux of apples and cider and all things good. No, seriously, this thing is massive and massively delicious. And you'll look like Fred Flinstone while eating the damned thing. Beautiul. \\n\\nI won't belabor the desserts: just get some, they're good. Key Lime Pie and Banana Pudding are standouts. \\n\\nOn the way out, make sure to stop by the wine shop to pick up a few discounted bottles for the road and be sure to drop a dollar into the jar for a fresh baked cookie. \\n\\nLove this place more than words do justice. Did I even mention brunch? Do I even need to? Probably not -- it's one of the best in the city.

It's reasonably priced and I can usually get 2 meals out of an order. My go-to is their combination rice bowl. It has a proportionate amount of meat (lamb/chicken), veggies, rice and sauce. Get extra sauce on the side! You can't get enough of it and it's great when you're eating your leftovers and it's gotten a little dry. \\n\\nI'd shy away from ordering their baklava/ mint lemonade drink.

What has happened to you? When I got to Boston, I figured out pretty quickly that Redbones is something of a local institution. Whenever I would snobbishly complain about the lack of good bbq this far north, some local would always drop their dunkin in horror and semi-whisper aghast \\"but...but what about Redbones?\\". So I tried it.  And the first few times, I had to grudgingly admit that, while it probably wouldn't rate if plopped down somewhere in Memphis, Redbones had edible, and nigh on flavorful bbq.  The catfish is always pretty good, the drinks are strong enough, and while the ribs probably wouldn't make you sing \\"Sweet Home Alabama\\", they would generally satisfy the urge for southern cuisine.\\n\\nSo imagine my disappointment when my last trip out to Redbones ran amok.  I was feeling particularly carnivorous, so I went with the Barbecue Belt.  I was expecting ribs done three different ways.  What I got was three different forms of bland and chewy. No amount of sauce was saving these ribs.  I won't even get into the sides, which I didn't bother finishing. My companions didn't fare any better.  The displeasure was enough to cause open grumbling at the table about how bad the meal was.  Sadly, I lied to the (nice) waitress who came by with the standard question of \\"is everything ok?\\"  I mean, I answered yes, but that's because I didn't know where to start with just how wrong things were.  \\n\\nHonestly, I was a little embarrassed, as it was my suggestion to go to Redbones.  In my past excursions, it has usually been solid B grade bbq.  Sure, it was the holidays, and perhaps traffic was low, so the food had sat out for a while.

The fish was flavorful and the potato salad side was tasty.  The coleslaw was okay, with a hint of left outside the fridge too long, but still edible.  The ribs were alright.  There is no sauce on them, so you get to season with BBQ sauce as you please, but were perhaps slightly overcooked.  I did enjoy it and would go back.  The beer selection was enormous and would be quite enjoyable for a beer aficionado.  For dessert we split pecan pie and custard.

The smallest shrimps I have ever been served. The mango fish, which is supposed to be deep fried fish with mango sauce, came out as cold and floppy pieces of fish covered in sweet and sour sauce. But don't forget, the chunks of mango that they decided to adorn the fish with was supposed to justify the sweet and sour sauce as mango sauce. It was DISGUSTING. \\n\\nThe thing that REALLY ticked me off happened at the very end of the meal. I had ordered jasmine rice before and I was served white rice.

Then the waiter, who hid from us the whole night, hadn't even apologized for his mistake, had the nerve to tell me that white rice was the same as JASMINE RICE. WHAT WHAT WHAT.

Adding a boiled egg would have cost another $2.  I don't know if this is typical for ramen but I can get a larger bowl with much more meat and veggies for about $9 most places.

Really cool branding, a really fun space. It's great to have a pizza place with atmosphere. You can really see that they have put a lot of thought and heart into their business. \\n\\nHowever, the pizza just plain sucks. The dough is awful. Honestly, it tastes like the first pizza a person has ever made, using some shitty recipe on the back of a sack of flour. There is no flavor; the dough is not hydrated enough and the gluten is undeveloped, so the crumb is dry and mealy. (Look at the crumb. Good pizza should have an open, glossy crumb. This pizza has a tight crumb like a slice of cheap bread.) I don't get it. How hard is it to develop flavor in a yeast dough? It's not hard, it just takes effort. Retard your dough. Make a poolish. Use a starter. Up the hydration and knead it more. Use more salt and some oil. Do not use god awful semolina / cornmeal on your peels, which only burns and blackens. All this can be done with existing equipment. They just need a new recipe and some training.\\n\\nAnd the cheese sucks too. I'm pretty sure every single pizza comes with asiago as a default.  I'm not a huge fan of asiago so I get that there is personal taste involved here, but it doesn't make sense culinarily. Asiago does not go with everything. It is a sharp, pungent cheese, and it brings out bitter flavors. Why put it everywhere? That is a gimmick, not a culinary decision. \\n\\nThis place has promise.

If the doughnuts were even just so-so, I think it would still be worth a few stars, but luckily the doughnuts here are quite tasty.\\n\\nSo far I have tried the Vanilla Bean, Dark Chocolate, and Salted Caramel & Bacon doughnuts. To speak generally first, the doughnuts are very cakey and airy, so if that's the kind of doughnut you like, you're in business! All three were warm when I had them and were just the right size for me to be able to comfortably put away two.\\n\\nThe Vanilla Bean might be what you call their plain glaze doughnut, but are in fact a bit better because the vanilla flavor stands out against the overall sweetness. As a bacon-fiend, I was already inclined to like the Salted Caramel & Bacon and for the most part wasn't disappointed. If anything, that doughnut could have had a touch more bacon. Unfortunately, however, I didn't much care for the Dark Chocolate. I hate giving criticism without being able to adequately explain why, but honestly I'm not sure what it was that put me off, except maybe to say that it just didn't measure up to the other two, or it might have been a problem with the ratio of chocolate icing to doughnut.\\n\\nThe coffee was okay (for comparison purposes, my favorite coffee is Counter Culture). The staff was super friendly and attentive, which was quite impressive given how quickly everyone was working to get more doughnuts baked and set out (the line was OUT THE DOOR and almost the END OF THE BLOCK on both of my visits). And although I am not  a Vegan, nor do I require gluten-free products, I was impressed to see an array of both types of goodies available.\\n\\nI'm holding off on 5 stars until Revolution Doughnuts has been open a while; we'll call the 5th star the \\"enduring star\\" but for now I'll say that Revolution Doughnuts is a strong addition to a city with high food standards.

Neptune.\\n\\nI got there as early as I could which meant about 6:00 and for a party of one, a twenty minute wait was nothing (though by the time I left, a party of four would have to wait two hours!).

It was just the quality and presentation that I was looking for.  I followed that up with a recommendation from the afore-mentioned doorman which was the Neptune Burger.

The sauce was too heavy, I think it had goat cheese or something mixed in and I am pretty confident that they didn't season the chicken before breading it because it was really bland. It was cooked well though, the meat was moist and the breading was crisp. The mashed potatoes were okay, the spinach really can't be screwed up. \\nThe meal is just under $15, which I felt was too much for the atmosphere and quality compared to other Austin restaurants. \\n\\nMy husband had the burger, it was also mediocre. \\n\\nOur waitress was nice, but I think she may have had too many tables because we waited awhile after getting our waters to see her again. \\n\\nThey only have beer and wine so if you like to have a martini or other mixed drink you will be disappointed. \\n\\nI don't think you will be leaving in disgust if you eat here, but if you are anything like me you will feel disappointed."},{"name":"Match","address":"94 Massachusetts Ave","city":"Boston","stars":"3","text":"I first visited Match for their RSVP-only grand opening on Sept. 27, 1995.

There's also ample patio seating that could seat a very large crowd. And the menu is simple but looks very fresh and inviting. And yet the food is just kinda meh to me.\\n\\nI opted for a carbonara and the dish comes plated beautifully, especially with the coddled egg. But as a composed dish, it falls a bit flat - flavor wise I can see where they're trying to go: quality ingredients in the house smoked pancetta, a strong kick of salty, smoked meat to counterbalance the heft of the carbonara. Coddled egg for silky richness, parsley for freshness, fresh pasta to boot. And yet - can't quite describe the dish as anything more than a dysfunctional work team. The prominence of the pancetta's flavor profile (smoky and salty) in the quantity that was present was just overwhelming the taste buds - arguably too salty and smoky. And yet, it couldn't do its job to balance out the heft - I felt drowsy halfway through my pasta. Parsley didn't quite add enough pop either and the fresh pasta was a little overcooked - it was clumping together at parts. The egg was a nice touch but maybe I needed to add a second yolk as its not much to spread over a lot of pasta.\\n\\nThe garlic bread is a bit pricey, but its very refined. Confit garlic, freshly grated cheese on good bread. As artisinal a version as they come, but I miss the butter and stronger garlic profile as the confit garlic lacks the bite that I like - its a bit too mellowed out.\\n\\nPatrizi's could be awesome but either it was an off night or not quite there yet.

The name always reminded me of a naked Mathew McConaughey bonging out while bongoing a bong.. ah Austin the ol days..  So when the BBQ joint closed, I was wondering what would replace it.  Viola, Cuatros has opened in it's place.  It is a cool little burger joint.  I went for lunch yesterday, and had the Cuatros Chicken Sandwich.  Grilled  chicken breast covered in cheese and black olives, with avocado slices on top.  Not bad, but not great.  The bun seemed to be a biscuit, rather than the usual bunnage I'm used too.  I reviewed the beer selections, to find out they didn't have my beloved Live Oak on tap, so I had a fireman's four and settled in at the bar.  There are plasmas all over the place, including a big screen projection out on the patio.  I was just  going to stay for the one pint, but since they had footie on the telly I lingered.  The owner pulled up a stool next to me and asked how I liked my meal, and I mentioned to him I didn't care for the bun, and you need to have Live Oak on tap.  They have 20 beers on tap.  He listened and told me that  he is moving to a Cibatta bun, and he would be happy to put Live Oak on tap...  He appreciated my comments, and  told me that he wanted to hear the negative and the positive about his new venture... young guy, with lots of plans.  I returned to my office, and decided to take my clients up at 5pm for an appointment.  Here is where I really got a feel for what Cuatros is going to be.  It will more than likely take over from Cain and Able's down the street as a Frat/Sorority hang out.  Bummer.  The menu is Burgers and Taco's, a couple of salads, but pretty simple stuff.  The wait staff seems to be quite new, at least my impression, at waiting tables, and seemed a little meek at first.  I think they will get better as the restaurant gets its legs.  So overall, first impression not bad.  Once the frat boys puke a little here and there, and a Sorority girl blows someone in the parking lot, I think it will do just fine.

Really good.  I got the chicken and barbecue pork.  The pork has delicious, crispy skin and is nicely seasoned, definitely more savory/salty than sweet but I really like that as a change of pace as most chinese BBQ pork is way on the sweet side.\\n\\nThe chicken was delicious tender and moist white breast meat, also very nicely seasoned, and absent the usual bones that many chinese bbq places will give you as they cleaver the chicken bones intact and heap it onto your plate.\\n\\nAs others have mentioned, the soy ginger sauce they spoon over the rice is positively yummy! They also ask if you want chili sauce, which is your fairly garden variety aggressively hot chili oil with flakes chili sauce, but is a nice accompaniment nonetheless.  Also the vegetables are better quality and tastier than lots I've had with similar barbecue at other places.\\n\\nTo sum it up, you pay slightly more for slightly less food here than places like Best BBQ, but you get what you pay for in terms of quality and taste.

Parking is a bit tight and they do not offer much parking space, so I recommend finding a spot on the side of the street and then walking. \\n\\nAtmosphere: My friend and I sat on the patio, which was nice and offered views onto the street. It also has a warm and rustic vibe. When you first walk into the restaurant I was greeted by a very friendly host who asked if we wanted to either sit inside or outside. He then led us to our table which was very clean and simple. The inside of the restaurant features a wall of wine options that you can choose from and also features desserts that I think you can pick up for togo. Murphy's has a very casual laid back atmosphere that transports you to a Cali winery. \\n\\nFood/Beverages: We ordered the mimosas which were good because how can you really butcher a mimosa (juice & champagne)? I ordered the quinoa squash with the artichokes as an appetizer and a side of their mac and cheese. My lovely friend ordered their special, which was grilled scallops over angel hair pasta and tossed in a pesto sauce. The artichokes were very good because they were grilled and served with a delicious lemon aioli of some sort. I LOVE artichokes and boy, they did this artichoke justice. The quinoa squash was also delicious and perfectly seasoned. Many places usually offer bland vegetable entrees, but Murphy's seasoned this entree to perfection. It was surprisingly good. The thing that stole my heart was actually the mac and cheese. I love mac and cheese and this was some good ole mac and cheese. I think they used some sort of white cheddar and truffle oil, which complemented the cheese very nicely. I also loved the fact that they used a thicker type of pasta in order to catch every drop of their delicious cheese sauce. If you do not thick that the shape of the pasta affects how a dish tastes, then you my friend need to try their mac and cheese. It was goooooood. My friend's scallop pesto pasta was also very flavorful, light and filling. The pesto sauce was divine and she raved about the perfection that the scallops were cooked to.\\n\\nService: Our server was very attentive to us and made sure that we had everything we needed. \\n\\nOverall: Murphy's is a great place for a unique spin on traditional american food. Everything was seasoned to my liking and I will definitely be back to try some of their other offerings. Parking is a bit of a pain, but a bit of walking is not all that bad.

Brandon, our server, was appropriately enthusiastic, very knowledgeable, and gave us some spot on recommendations. Looking through the other reviews, I guess I was lucky enough not to have problems getting seated, or (the explanation I'm more inclined to believe) I went on one of the normal nights where getting seated fairly and prompted is a non issue.\\n\\nWe were seated on the patio in the back corner, which was a tad bit dark to really enjoy (beyond intimate, that is), but Brandon brought out 2 extra candles to give us some actual facial recognition abilities. My water glass never fell below half, but that's not to say there was an obligatory inquisition every time he hit hour table for a refill. He and all waitstaff that passed us were very sensitive to reading our signals as to whether we needed something or not. If we're making eye contact with you as you walk across the 20 yard patio, we're either checking you out or want your attention/help...both of which are excellent reasons to come see what we need. We were never turned down for service by waiters from other tables, and everyone was prompt with everything we needed.\\n\\nAs of late I've begun taking a closer look at the kind of liquor selection restaurants have, and this one hits the spot on Tequila, however the Scotch department is lacking. No matter what the fare, I think restaurants in Austin that want to at least appear to be catering to a higher end crowd should have a 5+ scotch list, with 12 and 18 singles at the very least, and hopefully some Blended's as well.

They called it a panini but it wasn't pressed.   The chicken was extremely thin.  It almost seemed that there was more breading than chicken.  And since it was pan fried, it felt extremely unhealthy.   I actually took the chicken from one side and moved it on top of the other side to get a good meat to bread ratio.   The sandwich had very little sauce and very little cheese.    But I guess what can you expect for $7.95?

Walking in at 9pm, the tables lining the sides of the restaurant are limited in number and the line to the cashier can get lengthy.  If you don't know what you want, don't worry.  Just grab a menu at the front, get in line, and relax cause it'll take some time for you to make your way up to the register.  At their peak hours, grabbing an available table seems like a daunting task, but like Chilantro's brick and mortar location, a table will always open up.\\n\\nI chose to get the Goat curry combo and my girlfriend got the Lamb curry combo.  The general wait time for those dishes was around 15-20 minutes.  Not bad at all, based on how busy the place was.\\n\\nFirst impression was the service.  You order, grab a seat, and they will bring your water and food to you.  They got the job done and polite.  It was a bit confusing if it's your first time here; you're just not sure what services they'll do for you and what you're expected to do yourself.  A bit chaotic, but not a big deal.\\n\\nCombos come with two large portions of naan.  And when I say large, I mean large.  Between the two of us and four pieces of naan, only two were fully devoured.  The naan were really fluffy on the edges and crispy in the center.  Pretty tasty and just as good as anywhere else.\\n\\nThe goat curry was delicious as well.  The ratio of curry and rice was perfect and the flavors were all there.  The vegetables are cooked all the way through so that every bite was soft and the veggies melted in your mouth.  The only indication of the limits of having a smaller kitchen next to campus was that the goat and lamb meat were not as tender or fatty as that of other Indian restaurants.  Nevertheless, every bite was consumed with gusto.\\n\\nThe dessert included with the combo was the Kheer (Rice Pudding).  Cold and sweet, it had a cinnamon-like component that may be satisfying for some people but not others.  I thought it was enjoyable, but my girlfriend found it to be too strong and overwhelming.\\n\\nBased on the two curries I've tried, they were comparable to that of other established Indian restaurants, with the difference being the tenderness of the goat and lamb meat.  Without a huge sacrifice in quantity, the price is good.  If you're looking for top notch, exceptionally cooked Indian food, look outside of campus.  But if you just want to get a casual, quick Indian fix in the middle of the week or late into the night that'll still make your taste buds happy, Teji's is an excellent option."},{"name":"Gringos Locos","address":"517 E Michigan St","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"Always reliable, and always great service!

I live less than 5 min away and I have driven by numerous times.  The well-designed ads have always caught my eye but I didn't make it in there for the first time until last week.  After entering, I was greeted by a lackluster employee.  My husband ordered the Mexican and I ordered the American.  I was flatly told there was no cole slaw.  Which is fine, except, have some pride!  At least appear moderately apologetic that a main item is unavailable.  I ultimately selected the Indian.  Sadly, the food was as bad as the service.  The chicken was dry and flavorless.  The Indian was bland and I wanted my meal to be over after a few bites.  The Mexican was a bit better bc the sauce had a kick to it but definitely not worth coming back for.  I'm really not sure how this place has 4 stars on Yelp.  Perhaps it was just an off night?

They do have a nifty text-based notification system for when your table is ready, so if the wait is longer you can walk around the area rather than standing in the cramped entry-way. Once you do get in the place gets loud during peak hours, so it can be hard to hear the rest of the party at the table. \\n\\nFor food, my classmates tried the Mahi-Mahi, Executive, Fried Chicken and Southern tacos, while I ordered the Executive, Southern and Lobster options. The rest of the table enjoyed all of their options; while I really liked the Executive and Southern I found the lobster flavor in the last one overpowering to the point  where it drowned out the chipotle sauce and slaw designed to balance it out. I wasn't a huge fan, but your mileage may vary. They do have other options such as nachos and skillets, all with the similar Mexican-fusion vibe. We also received chips and salsa for the table; the salsa was a decently spicy salsa roja and the chips were surprisingly well seasoned.

My family is from Chicago so I have been there to visit a number of times to visit.  The first thing I do when I leave the airport is head to Portillos to satisfy my undying craving for an Italian beef, Chicago dog, and a tamale, yes I get all three - don't judge me.  I have been on the hunt for a somewhat comparable place to enjoy these midwestern delicacies constantly since I moved to Orlando 8 years ago.  Not only did I find such a place when I found ChiPhi but they go above and beyond \\"comparable\\".  Bold statement alert - it is the most authentic Italian beef sandwich I have had outside of Chitown itself. From the bread it is served on down to the flavor of the gravy! It is delish!  I have not explored the world of the Philly Cheesesteak quite as much as the Italian Beef, however, I did recently take a trip to Philly and as any good foodie would agree it was imperative that I sample the top Philly Cheesesteak spots which included Pat's, Geno's, & Steve's, so I did.  I got the \\"Pick Two\\" option from ChiPhi since afterall the title is half of each city.  I enjoyed half of the \\"Wiz Wit'\\" Cheesesteak, a little Philly lingo I picked up on my trip which simply means with cheese whiz and onions, and a half of an Italian beef ,wet, with a side of gravy (I like more than 'wet' but less than 'dunked') topped with giardiniera hot peppers.    I have already raved enough about the Italian beef so I must say that the Philly Cheesesteak was just as authentic from the slab sliced meat (just as they do up North) to the imported Amoroso rolls!

After all, a friend had hyped Ajisen Ramen just down the street, an establishment that was decent, but lacked authenticity and taste.\\n\\nI am glad that I made the effort, as GMen has now supplanted both Kintaro and Motomachi as my favorite ramen establishment in Vancouver.  I later learned GMen is also owned and operated by Gyoza King, a name you can definitely trust for Japanese food.\\n\\nLike a typical Japanese Ramen shop, they do not have a menu that is 4-6 pages long (see Ajisen), but rather keep it simple and serve only what they do well.  You have your choice from four types of ramen: Tonkotsu, Miso, Shio and Shoyu.  The last two always seem to be sold out (at dinner time), and I have yet to successfully try a bowl.\\n\\nWhat I have tried however is the Miso, and I truly believe this is the best bowl you can find in Vancouver.  The broth meets the gold standard and is comparable with any ramen shop you'd find in Japan.  It doesn't feature a ton of additional ingredients, but some times less is better, and I certainly feel like that's the case here.  The pork is truly sublime and literally melts in your mouth.  It's hard to put into words, and is something you have to try for yourself.\\n\\nThere are other items on the menu, some standard fare (gyoza, pork slices, etc), and others a tad more unique (donburi rice dishes).  Ultimately, everything was good with no complaints.\\n\\nIf there was a small gripe I have with the place, it would have to be that it's closed two days a week.  This isn't a big deal if you have a comprehensible sign outside your establishment (they didn't), have a working telephone (they don't), or clearly indicate your hours of operation on your website (d'oh).  So let me save you the legwork and tell you not to bother going down there on Tuesday or Wednesday.\\n\\nGMen is a great new addition to the market.

It's really great. I recently stopped by to check out their Caravaggio exhibit (only $5 on Sundays for adults - the rest of the museum is free!), which was fantastic. I think a lot of people were expecting to see several Caravaggio art pieces, but it ended up being a biographical exhibit about Caravaggio as a man and revolutionary; it featured several artists who he inspired and influenced, which I thought was very neat. This exhibit came to be because of the bicentennial and because Columbus' sister city is Genoa, Italy. How cool is that?\\n\\nI think it's pretty easy to navigate CMA, which is great. I spent 2.5 hours there and could have stayed for at least an hour more, but I had to get going. I love that there is a family hallway with interactive art exhibits and fun ways for people to participate at the museum. People might complain about it being nosy with lots of strollers, but in my experience the Tim Burton exhibit at MoMA was waaaay more stressful (and loud!).

After surveying a handful of trucks, we couldn't refuse these glorious fries, especially after we noticed every other person placing a fry order. These \\"Bomb\\" fries are tossed in Thai Chiles, Thai Basil, white truffle oil and topped with finely shaved Parmigiano Reggiano. I'm pretty sure I fried the roof of my mouth as I shoveled multiple fries onto my taste buds, they were just that good! The basil added an interesting depth of flavor and balanced out some of the Chile spice. The Parmigiano Reggiano was divine, shaved to perfection and rounded out the white truffle flavor which can sometimes be overpowering. Bem Bom rolls around town on four wheels, but follow them on Twitter (@BemBomFood) for menu and location details!\\n\\nAnd next time you venture to Tasty Tuesdays, don't park in the surrounding business lots. They are serious towers. After a $140 ATM withdrawal and a trip to OBT, I reclaimed my car. Oops! Tasty Tuesdays occurs weekly at 2424 E Robinson St, Orlando, Florida.

Yes, the atmosphere and the service was good, and the menu was huge, and everything could have been so good, except for the food.  Now i'm no southerner, but I know that this was not good soul food.  It was ok, mediocre...my ribs mostly fell off the bone, but some of it was tough, the fries were very average...i think average describes the whole experience, so after all the hype, i felt pretty let down.

Haven't tried the weekend brunch, but I intend to, particularly the vanilla battered french toast. \\n\\nThey have beer and wine (and some tasty-looking treat called a Poinsetta), but I think you can bring your own liquor. May want to call ahead to see if that's true so you don't get arrested.\\n\\nThe ambiance has that cool, Austin-chic quality (not stuffy), and the service was friendly.

We came to visit the restaurant on the 4/16/2014 with the family. We've never been here and I visit Palm Bay quite a bit for business but because this was spring break for the kids, we decided to go as a family. \\n\\nWhen we arrived there were three full tables, probable about 8-9 people each. We walked in and no one seated us so we went ahead and seated ourselves. We waited while the one gentlemen was helping the larger tables and we waited patiently for about 15 minutes and no one came by. He continued to help the other tables and the one gentlemen did not even acknowledge we were even there. So my wife stood up and walked over to where the menus were located and brought it back to the table for us to view the menu and decided what we wanted. Now about 25 minutes had passed and still no one came by to stop even to acknowledge we were there, we decided to get up and leave. Not one person in the restaurant even came over to say they were sorry that the service was a bit slow for what ever reason. \\n\\nWe found another cuban restaurant about 13 minutes away that we were happy with. I  don't want to bad mouth this business and as I said above, I understand how difficult being short handed can be but I hope that someone does read this and take note, that if they would simply have acknowledged us at the table and let us know they would be with us in 5-10 minutes we would have gladly waited.\\n\\nI wish I could rate the food but I can't but I can say the service side needs a bit of help."},{"name":"Murphy's","address":"997 Virginia Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Went there for brunch on Sunday and I could not find a single thing wrong.

So we went in to get our favorite -- the Reggie Deluxe.  I was really hungry so I was eyeing up the cinnamon roll, but have had the Reggie Deluxe before and know how much food that is, so I abstained.  After we placed our order, we sat down and had some coffee.  A lot of time passed, and we hadn't received our order, but we weren't too upset about it, because the coffee was good and we weren't in a hurry.  The manager or owner or upper level employee of sorts came over to our table and said \\"I can see that you are almost done with your coffee, which says to me you have been sitting here for quite a while.  I want to apologize that we lost your ticket, but we have found it and your food is almost ready.  To make up for it I would love to give you a cinnamon roll.  I like to solve most of my problems with sugar.\\"  Not only did I appreciate his honesty, but I also appreciated that he addressed the problem long before we did or would have; and furthermore, offered a way to make it right.  They could have easily ignored the situation and just brought out our food with no explanation whatsoever and waited to see if we threw a fit (which we wouldn't have anyway).  It's rare that people take responsibility for mistakes without a prompt from the one that has been wronged.

It just really confuses me on how a restaurant is so about being gluten free. Yet all the workers have no idea what food allergies are. I thought that was the point but apparently this restaurant is all about the fad. Instead of actually being apart of the change.  Now we all know if this restaurant truly cared they would know about 20% of people who are celiacs are also allergic to corn and other grains. \\n\\nhttp://www.healthyjasmine.com/corn-and-gluten-how-similar-their-health-symptoms-overlap/\\n\\nhttps://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.mindbodygreen.com/articles/is-corn-the-next-gluten\\n\\nNow based in los angeles. I moved to austin to find places to eat that wouldnt try to kill me. And i must say picnik is the main one i trust. I came to this restaurant though because i have family visiting. And i thought how cool a 100 percent gluten free restaurant. They have to be all about allergies and understanding about the effects of it. And boy was i wrong when stating i was severly allergic to corn. The waiter sat there and literaly looked at my like a idiot. I might of well been speaking a different language.  They were rude and completely not understanding.  And told me its a corn restraunt. Sad thing is all i got was a baked potato and begged him to look at every ingredient because corn is always hidden. And asked to try not to contaminate me. How hard can it be one potato check, sour cream check and cheese check. Change gloves try to not cross contaminate me.  I was starving because i had been running around all day. My mom intown to visit and help. Because i have two babies under 2 and a husband whose in afghanistan. But here i am 3 bites in and the heart wrenching pain sets in. My lips start to burn. My tongue goes numb. My stomach wrenching in pain. It was a baked potato. How hard can it be. You pay 5 bucks for a potato i can make at home. And all because i wanted to treat my family. Not to even say they wanted cupcakes and they were stale and old. I could just make moist coconut flour ones at home. So now were heading home but i stopped at whole foods to get a water. And all hell is breaking loose now. I projectile vomit blood everywhere. Thats it the butter, sour cream or cross contamination there had to have been a hidden corn agent somewhere. But the guy swore no. And who knows if he looked. Now dont get me wrong alot of you will say if its that bad why go out at all. Well let me tell you as basically a single parent of two. Sometimes you just have to eat or maybe feel normal for two seconds. And i know if i get something like a closed potato my hopes are pretty high. But thats not the point if i went to a red lobster and got a baked potato fine call my odds with those damn biscuits next to my potato. But i didnt i went to a place which values 100 percent gluten free. Claim claim claim. To which is awesome because id be dead if it were gluten. But its the point dont put yourself on a pedistool with claims. If at the end of the day your clearly in it for the miley cyrus fad. 6 years ago i was diagnosed with a servere type of celiacs. I am allergic to almost all grains corn and wheat specifically and rice gives me leaky gut symptoms hightened. I havent eaten out in almost all of those 6 years. My husband and i  packed our entire lives and moved. So i could have a more semi life. I want to open a grain free mobile hair salon in a couple years. Thats all i could ask for so we moved to the paleo nation. Because thats typically how i have to eat and live with my condition. I have such a rare form of this disease. That even if i walk down the bread aisle i bloat and break out in a rash. But at the end of it all. I guess as i sit here holding my beautiful 6 month old at 30 years old at 5 am in the morning . I hope to see her graduate and get married one day. And my other babies. I chose not to allow my illness to win. I chose to wake up every morning and eat a strict diet. And not allow myself to die from intestinal cancer because of my intenstines bleeding all the time from mess ups like this. So next time anyone thinks that gluten is just a cute adjective or fad. Just remember one thing. I wouldn't work in a bread factory since im allergic to bread. Why work at a restaurant who climbs to fame for being 100 percent glutem free and not even understand the word. Or even yet understand that a huge population who is allergic to it is also allergic to corn. Or other allergens for the fact. For all of us out there just wanting to survive. Stop fighting for the movement and fight for a change. And at the end of the day have a lil compassion for people who arent as fortunate as you are."},{"name":"Neptune Oyster","address":"63 Salem St","city":"Boston","stars":"4.5","text":"Yummy and great service.

We first fell victim to their mistaken chalk-board menu, which displayed the wrong pricing and quantities, but even after referring to the take-away menu, all was not well, as they short-changed us one wing, and swapped us honey garlic flavour instead of hot, as we had requested. The wings themselves were of the smaller variety too, the inch and a half-ish per wing (length) sort. \\n\\nFor pizza dip, we were given the Hellmann's brand, of which I've never been a fan, as they always come out tasting really over-processed.

I joked about taking her to TGI Friday.  The joke was on me.\\n\\nInside, the place is very dark and kinda run-down.  I'm kinda grossed out that we had to take off our shoes, especially since the servers all run around with their shoes on.  We are seated in the far back corner, which was nice but we couldn't really see the belly dancing because she spent most of her time on the other side of the restaurant.  Is it in traditional Moroccan-style to stuff dollar bills in the belly dancer's g-string?\\n\\nWhen I made the reservation, I specifically asked for the 5-course dinner because I absolutely hate buffets.  The server informed us that the buffet was the only option.  It was not only more expensive but not worth it.  So, the server washes our hands in typical Moroccan fashion (though the American in me really desired soap as well) and we're off to the buffet.\\n\\nSides:\\nBread - pretty good, cakey not sweet.\\nSalad - iceberg lettuce, really?!  If you're gonna charge me an arm, serve the good lettuce please.\\nLentil bean soup - ehhh...\\nCouscous - flavorless\\nAfrican rice - dry \\nVegetables - ehhh...\\n\\nMains were ok: Beef rib, Cornish game hen, Lamb tagine, Tilapia.  I'm assuming they were all traditional Moroccan, tasty, but not a party in my mouth, more like an intimate get-together.\\n\\nDessert: \\"Chef dessert\\" - fillo dough with raisins and powdered sugar.  Mom and Boy seemed to enjoy.\\n\\nPoor service.  Only came to refill drinks once.  Server didn't speak English.  Bill was wrong.  I was already really annoyed by this point, but I told them, they fixed it, fine.  But the worst was when the manager lost my credit card and then accused me of not giving it to him!  It finally turned up - I think one of the staff rang it up.  I adjusted my tip (I HATE places that include gratuity for BUFFETS!), grabbed my shoes, and roadrunner'd outta there.

She told me I could look at the claws in the display case to compare sizes, I did look on my way out after paying $114 including an overly generous 20% tip. It wasn't the servers fault so I still tip well. So I checked out the claws in the display window and the Colosal claws were no different in size from the medium claws at 1/2 the price. So I left with a bad taste in my mouth. I would go back but buyer beware on the Stone crab claws pricing."},{"name":"LOCAL Public Eatery - Kitsilano","address":"2210 Cornwall Avenue","city":"Vancouver","stars":"3.5","text":"So, I decided to visit my bro on the left coast.

WOW.\\n\\n- Atmosphere -\\n\\nOkay, let's establish first, that the scenery and the environment where the Local is located is pretty damn incredible.  Kitsilano beach, on the south side of Cornwall - facing the water & mountains.  Spectacular environmental requirement met.  The interior is fairly spacious, well designed, dark woods and warmth.  Great, big patio.\\n\\n- Service -\\n\\nDespite the fact that it was a Monday evening, the Local was packed.  But there were certainly enough staff to manage the crowd.  We never waited for more than a few minutes for a drink or to place an order.  Service may also fall under atmosphere as well... not bad to look at either.\\n\\n- Food and Drink -\\n\\nOkay, I really REALLY like fish tacos.  I've had my fair share, and in various parts of the globe.  But NOTHING compared to what they're doing here.  No kidding, it was absolutely fantastic and if you order nothing else, this should be it.  I also ordered their Caesar, which came recommended, and that too was great - I'm still partial to the Rock Lobster version (how can you beat a lobster tail).  But everything was great.  Ordered the Crispy Chicken sandwich and a side of greens - bananas.  \\n\\n- Overall -\\n\\nI really want to fault the Local on something, I really do, because Kitsilano is not home for me, I don't want to be thinking about it when I return to Toronto, but I can't make a single complaint.

We got a seat at the bar, which I think is an awesome seat especially with our wonderful and knowledgeable waitress that served us.  We grubbed,... ordered probably more food than we should have, but ate them all.  All split between two people.  To share we got 8 oysters, the Johnnycake, a bowl of clam chowder, Uni toast, and the lobster roll with salad instead of fries.  Oysters were fresh and delicious.  The johnnycake was different, but extremely appetizing.  The clam chowder was good, but I feel like I've had better.  Being we ordered so much food, this is what I probably could've done without. Uni toast - savory, melt in your mouth, and my favorite. Lobster roll - ordered it hot with butter.  Delicious and has a huge amount of lobster. The only thing about the lobster roll was the bread was a little dry, so I didn't eat all of the bread. But overall, a wonderful experience.  Put your name down early and walk around.

I had the Tibby's Style 1/2 shrimp 1/2 oyster Po-Boy with half a Caesar salad.  The roast beef was maybe a step above Arby's.  The dirty rice has an unpleasant artificial flavor that makes you want to spit it out, the shrimp were rubbery, the oysters were microscopic, the remoulade sauce was pink mayonnaise and the Caesar salad was bland. Worst of all a Po-Boy  is supposed to made on a French Baguette, crunchy on the outside soft and delicious on the inside.  Tibby's serves a glutenous-rubbery-white bread-sad-substitute for a French Baguette.  I can say the iced tea was good. The restaurant is decorated nicely and is colorful but there are horrible acoustic issues.

Why you ask? TACO TUESDAY. I had never been to Tin Lizzy's for Taco Tuesday before, but after seeing their ad on facebook for $2 tacos, I thought \\"sure, why not?\\" The evening started great. We were seated at a high top table with a lovely card on the table advertising the aforementioned $2 tacos. We all ordered a plethora of tacos and even some to take home (along with the large quantities of margarita we had purchased). When we were brought our bills, we were devastated to discover not only were the tacos not $2, they were also not $3, but most were $4!! We called our waitress over and very kindly asked her to explain this situation. With a heavy eye roll and a bit too much attitude in my opinion, she informed us that the only tacos eligible were chicken tacos. I felt embarrassed honestly. I realized I had obviously overlooked the asterisk on all of the ads explaining that restrictions apply. I quickly picked up the card on the table and was ready to apologize when I discovered there were no restrictions. I even opened the facebook ad to check it. Again, no restrictions. We had even ordered chicken tacos and they were not discounted. The waitress then proceeded to claim even more restrictions on Taco Tuesday and when I asked her how I was supposed to know all of these unannounced rules, she simply rolled her eyes and walked off. I realized that this type of false advertisement and deception was not the fault of our waitress, and kindly asked for the manager. She would not get the manager and instead took away our advertisement so that we had no evidence of the restaurant's misinformation. She then proceeded to avoid and ignore our table completely until we finally had her get the manager. I have never experienced such rude management in my life. We simply asked to be informed of the taco Tuesday rules and not only would he not elaborate, he continuously asked \\"WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO DO ABOUT IT?\\" Um, easy, we just want you to not be full of shit. If your restaurant advertises something one way, you can't refuse when a customer requests it. Not only was the false advertisement a disappointment, I was flabbergasted by the complete and utter disrespect and disdain showed by both the manager and our waitress. They acted as if I were somehow at fault for their poor communication, marketing, and overall service and quality. \\n\\nI always have loved Tin Lizzys and I still do enjoy the food, but unfortunately I will be taking my business somewhere where I am not treated as poorly as I was on this fateful Taco Tuesday."},{"name":"Chago's Caribbean Cuisine","address":"7301 N Lamar Blvd","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"This restaurant was recommended to be by a fellow Yelper and I was instantly intrigued. A highly-rated Puerto Rican restaurant isn't something I see too often out west; however, I can say after trying it that I am glad I gave it a chance. I was raised on Puerto Rican food, so it always reminds me of my childhood and has a special place in my heart.\\n\\nThis place is tucked away on N Lamar Blvd and is the kind of place you would never know existed if not for sites like yelp.\\n\\nTo start, I had the Queso Frito con Salsa de Guayaba. Not a \\"home-style\\" or traditional Puerto Rican recipe (at least it wasn't any of the food I grew up on), but was tasty. You wouldn't think fried Queso Blanco with a guayaba salsa for dipping would be good; however, it honestly is. It's kinda like having cheese and fruit. The dish is playful and creative and I tip my hat to their kitchen.\\n\\nOnto the entrees. My partner ordered the Chagos Pernil Asado, which was pretty good. I love Puerto Rican pork and while I have been spoiled with better Pernil, their's is authentic and the flavor profile is what I was expecting. No one does pork like the Caribbean! The arroz con gandules was great and reminds me of some of my aunts'. I ordered the Puerto Rican Paella, which I would consider more of a fusion dish than strictly Puerto Rican; however, it was also good and very filling. My only complaint is that they use the dark meat which consequently has pieces of fat. It's personal preference, so if you don't mind the dark meat, don't let this turn you off.\\n\\nOverall, a pretty great restaurant. I do feel the prices are a little high for the food you are buying. The portions were large which kind of balances out the cost, yet I still feel like it's a little overpriced. In addition, they do not have a great selection of alcohol, only a handful of bottled beers, wine-based margaritas (eww), and wine. However, if you're looking for some good Puerto Rican food, I do recommend this place and will definitely be back."},{"name":"Pine State Biscuits","address":"2204 NE Alberta St","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"Solid biscuits, awesome OJ, long lines."},{"name":"Pepino's Mexican Grill - Portland","address":"3832 SE Hawthorne Blvd","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"I LOVE their pickled onion/carrot/jalepeno, and salsa (not so much the green and red hot sauce though).

The chowder was delicious and got our hopes up for the rest of the meal.  We ordered burgers and a side of mac and cheese.  The mac was pretty good but we had to wait ten minutes for silverware which we requested twice from the waiter.  The burgers were subpar.  My boyfriend's was overcooked and missing the bacon he had requested.  Mine was also overcooked but I didn't care as much.  We sent his back and waited a good twenty minutes for the new one which also arrived overcooked.  In the end, all three burgers were on our bill.  When the waiter came by to collect, he must have seen our faces and asked if the third burger was on the bill.  He then immediately produced a new bill from his pocket.  This seemed extremely shady.  Was he trying to see if we would just pay for it?  I don't know... but he briefly apologized and left it at that.   \\n\\nWe had high hopes for this place as their menu is quite impressive.

We've been here 3 times in the past 2 weeks and each visit was enjoyable.  The first time, My husband and I were just taking short walk after dinner at Tin Can Oyseter and as we walked by this new Hob Nob we were intrigued by the live music and welcoming layout.  We decided to have a drink especially because it was a beautiful night and the bar is set up so that you can either sit inside or outside.  The service at the bar was good.  My husband ordered an old fashioned which he said was really good.  I'm no expert in cocktails but he said they did it the right way.  My husband likes his drinks \\"smoky\\" and what they actually do is light a few wood chips and cinnamon stick in small bowl, then they cover the fire with the glass tumbler to smoke the inside of the drinking glass.  We thought that was cool, some places just add the smoke liquid.  Anyway old fashions were so good my husband ordered 3.  I had white wine so nothing really special to say about it.  The bar tender consistently kept filling our water glasses which is a good thing, one of those small things that many people don't appreciate but I do. \\n\\nThe 2nd time we came this place we had brunch.  The brunch menu has many interesting choices.  \\n\\nThe 3rd time which was a Wednesday evening we came for dinner.  Service was a little extra attentive this visit.  Did they read the previous reviews of people complaining?  Host was very friendly. There were about 3 open tables and the host asked us which table we preferred, we choose the table at the edge of the covered part so we can have fresh air without being totally outside.  The waitress was very nice too, not perfect - she looked young so she probably needs more experience.  But no complaints here.  \\n\\nBrunch\\n1. Pork belly, eggs and grits.  He LOVED it and would come back again.   The plate had a nice hearty slice of pork belly that was cooked to perfection.   It wasn't too fatty but still tender and it melted in your mouth.  The eggs cooked just right and creamy grits.\\n\\n2. \\"BYOB\\" (From the Build Your Own Breakfast) section.  Several choices.  You can choose: 1 item for $3.50 or 2 items for $6.95, 3 items for $9.50 or 4 items for $12.50.  I choose the 3 items which was more than enough: Biscuits with Sausage gravy, 2 eggs and French toast.  All were very good,  I would of liked more gravy which is me being greedy.  I would definitely go back for brunch.\\n\\n3.  Dirty Mary - same as a bloody Mary with olive juice added.  Get it, instead of dirty martini - its bloody Marie ;)  Nothing exceptional but decent.\\n\\nDinner\\n1. Appetizer Crab Dip - Oh my deliciousness...real crab in this creamy parmesan sauce.  Served with pita bread slices.  \\n\\n2.  Entr√©e:  Pig and Grits - Amazing!  It was braised pork belly with creamy grits.  Not the same type of pork belly listed on the brunch menu.  Since the pork belly is braised, it's so tender that it basically falls apart.  Served with the creamy grits.   This is a very heavy entr√©e and as good as it was, my husband could not finish it.  Especially because we had and appetizer before that.  So we took the other half for breakfast the next day (added some fried eggs to it).\\n\\n3.  Steak House burger - It was cooked perfectly Medium rare and just the right enough of toppings.  It usually comes with fries but I asked for a \\"Premium side\\" for an extra $4.  I asked if it was the same mac n cheese as the one from the entr√©e section which has truffle oil, there's also another kind on the kids menu which is plain.  The waitress said yes, but she was incorrect - that is just about the only thing that went wrong.  The side mac n cheese was the plain kind.  I told her I didn't like it so she immediately replaced it with the French fries which I would recommend.  I'll have to come back to the try the Entr√©e mac n cheese\\n\\nEach time we went had Live Music: Wednesday night and Sunday afternoon they had Live Music which we enjoyed very much.  The Wednesday and Thursday guy sings popular songs from classic to pop, but in his own interpretation with an acoustic soul vibe - he's part of the reason why we stayed longer than intended the first visit, we only wanted 1 drink but ended up having 3 each!  Sunday brunch had a different guy, who my husband recognized from the Ansley Hob Nob.  My husband enjoyed his music from last time that he bought his album from ITunes.  \\n\\nService overall was good.  From hostess to waitress. \\n\\nWow I think this is the longest review I ever wrote! If you're still reading...Thank you :)\\n\\n******Update 9/23/17.

I have been going for at least 15 years that I can remember. I don't think it has ever changed.  It's cozy.

They don't hesitate to bring another bottle as soon as you start getting low.  If you prefer something else, they have a full bar, so no problem.  I have never had to wait for a table, and they have a parking lot.  Like what you have read so far?\\n\\nOn to the food.  I noticed a few people complaining that the menu needs updating to make their dishes lighter and healthier, to cater to modern diets.  Well guess what?  Sometimes you want the classics with all of the fat, calories, and deliciousness that they were meant to have. I personally go for the chicken fried chicken.  Every. Time. It is coated in bread crumbs instead of batter, and very crisp. My friends lean toward the chicken fried steak, and are consistently happy with it.  The food won't blow your mind, but it's good in an old-school diner sort of way. The table gets a basket of toast to share.  For the prices ($10 and under), you get a nice portion of food. As Valerie mentioned all of the plates come with a mini brownie.  The perfect little morsel to end the meal. \\n\\nThe staff has always been super congenial and on the ball.

After discovering this place, I went there about 3 times a week for the first 2 or 3 weeks,  The people were fantastic, namely Tony and Stephanie, and the food was pretty good.  I have long craved having a reasonably priced neighborhood cafe and with this one being close to home I really wanted this to be the place I could hang out several times a week for dinner.  The pasta was good, the red sauce properly seasoned and fresh.  However, after about my 3rd week of going there regularly, things started to get bumpy.  The bolognese sauce was no longer fresh tasting, it had taken on that \\"re-heated one too many times\\" taste where the sauce is actually broken and almost metallic tasting.  The first time they served me broken sauce, I overlooked it as a fluke.  But the 2nd and 3rd time it happened, I realized they weren't interested in serving fresh food, just food, and they weren't willing to throw out, donate or discount any food they weren't able to sell while it was still fresh.  This is unforgivable to me.  Go, but don't get the red sauce.  DO GET THE TENDERLOIN TIPS!  WONDERFUL!  And although I liked the pasta dishes (at least before they started serving me old, overcooked red sauce) their so-called \\"zesty stuffers\\" were a total disappointment from the get-go. No matter which filling you choose, just awful.  Don't bother.  The fillings are so finely chopped up as to be unrecognizable, and downright skimpy in quantity.  And to boot, they completely fail their description of zesty...nothing tasted zesty about them at all so how they got that name escapes me.  Overall, this new location needs to install better lighting, stop serving too-old red sauce, and just ditch the zesty stuffers altogther.

That plus an order of the garlic bread, which had whole roasted cloves that you can mash and spread to your liking equaled perfection.

I am sorry if I  did not get to say hello to all my Yelp friends. \\nStay cool."},{"name":"Pho Pasteur","address":"682 Washington St","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"Pho taste just fine. Friendly staffs. Need to find parking spot. Bun Bo Hue is ok to try."},{"name":"Clerys","address":"113 Dartmouth St","city":"Boston","stars":"3","text":"Very popular spot to grab beers on the cheap if you work around Copley.  Not because Clery's is spectacular, but because everywhere else in back bay is swankier and less-accommodating to large mixed after work crowds.  \\n\\nThis is place is exactly what you think it is.  An after work bar with a skeevy downstairs dance floor. Annoyingly,  they serve standard bar food on square plates and serves their fries in cones, thereby justifying a 20% markup.  \\n\\nThere are, however, two big surprises.  The first is that they pour imperial pints from the draft--I love this.  Bigger \\nbeers=buzzed faster=easier convos with hated co-workers.  The second surprise is that every draft beer has a nice tinge of liquid rust.  They \\"Clerly\\" don't clean any of the taps.  WTF?\\n\\nIf they scrubbed the lines I'd love this place.  Nothing worse than a rusty Harpoon IPA.  But I'll be there on Friday!"},{"name":"The Goat Gahanna","address":"6400 Preserve Crossing Blvd","city":"Columbus","stars":"3.5","text":"happy hour 4-7 pm weekdays.

Yummy Korean barbecue that you can grill at your table or have them do it for you.  I love the tons of side dishes they offer, some of them were new to me (sweet onion, tofu).  My favourite were the gyoza and the beef bulgogi.\\n\\nThe service is fast, there is lots of parking, and it is on the pheripheral edges of Richmond so its not too crowded."},{"name":"Aprisa Mexican Cuisine","address":"2311 SE 8th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"If you live anywhere near SE Division and 8th Ave., you know how lucky you are.  Me, I work near Aprisa's and count myself fortunate, especially since we're nowhere near the food cart pods that are popping up all over Portland like forest chantrelles.\\n\\nI don't usually rate restaurants unless they're really bad, but this place deserves a much wider audience and longer lines in their drive-through (it's totally selfish, I want to ensure they'll be around for many more breakfast and lunch runs).\\n\\nHaving lived in New Mexico for several years, I can deem the food authentic, well seasoned, carefully prepared and not over-salted like that of the even more proximal Los Gorditos.\\n\\nPortions are unbelievably generous, and even though I swear I'm only going to eat half, and save the rest for a later meal or to share, I am finishing off an entire taco salad with hand-shredded lettuce, perfectly grilled steak, mashed avocado, black beans, cheese, and grilled peppers and onions, and even chowing down the taco shell, which I find inedible at most purveyors of Mexican food.\\n\\nSo far, I've had their breakfast burrito, steak burrito, chicken burrito and now the taco salad with steak.  I've yet to order something that didn't make me want to start devouring while still en route, and it's my happy task to make my way through the rest of their menu."}]`),N={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:z},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:6,poemsData:O,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.poemsData.filter(n=>{const e=this.searchQuery.toLowerCase();return n.name.toLowerCase().includes(e)||n.city.toLowerCase().includes(e)||n.text.toLowerCase().includes(e)}).slice(0,this.visibleCount):this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(n=>setTimeout(n,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},E={class:"search-container"},R={class:"card-container"},j=["disabled"],H={key:0},L={key:1};function F(n,e,s,f,i,r){const u=p("PoemCard");return a(),o("section",null,[e[3]||(e[3]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"üéâ Restaurant Reviews ü•≥")])],-1)),t("div",E,[e[2]||(e[2]=t("span",{class:"search-icon"},"üîç",-1)),b(t("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=h=>i.searchQuery=h),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[v,i.searchQuery]])]),t("div",R,[(a(!0),o(y,null,m(r.filteredPoems,(h,g)=>(a(),k(u,{key:g,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),r.hasMorePoems?(a(),o("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:i.isLoading,onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=(...h)=>r.loadMore&&r.loadMore(...h))},[i.isLoading?(a(),o("span",L,"Loading...")):(a(),o("span",H,"See more"))],8,j)):w("",!0)])}const D=c(N,[["render",F],["__scopeId","data-v-e3d395d1"]]),V=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"quotesmag/16.md","filePath":"quotesmag/16.md"}'),G={name:"quotesmag/16.md"},Y=Object.assign(G,{setup(n){return(e,s)=>(a(),o("div",null,[I(D)]))}});export{V as __pageData,Y as default};
