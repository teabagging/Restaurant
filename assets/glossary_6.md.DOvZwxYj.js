The look of the location from the street reminded me of the images from Bourdain or Zimmern on their many Asia trips (I, sadly, have never been there myself); open air seating, tin roof, picnic table-like seating, no frills, etc.\\n\\nWe didn't have to wait more than 2-3 minutes for a table to be prepared for us. Moments after we were seated, a pitcher of water was placed on our table along with some menus and a brief overview of how they intend their guests to eat: Family style. Which was plenty fine with me, if not just preferable, as I wanted to get a taste of everything.  A few moments later a small dish of freshly fried chili-lime peanuts was placed on our table as an appetizer.\\n\\nOur server was friendly and asked us if it was our first visit. She offered to make suggestions and gave us an idea of how much food she thought we should order.  She suggested 4-5 dishes for the three of us. We ended up only ordering three because we had several other food stops to make before heading back home to Seattle.\\n\\nWe ended up ordering the spicy fish sauce wings, pork satay and pork belly curry. The wings, to me, weren't as spicy as I expected (Full disclosure: I've done the Korean 2X fire noodle challenge and didn't want any milk afterward) and a bit saltier than anticipated, but super tasty, nonetheless. Other reviewers have suggested ordering the mild wings, which seem to be more flavorful, so my next visit will include them.\\n\\nThe pork satay was also very tasty, certainly not over-cooked and dried out. The peanut sauce they serve with the dish is plenty tasty and I ended up using the toasted bread to scoop up every last bit of it. Pok Pok also serves a bowl with pickled, spicy vegetables alongside the satay, which my friend found too hot for him, but he doesn't handle spicy that well.\\n\\nOur third dish was the pork belly curry. They serve it in a clay pot and the presentation reminds me a bit of a beef stew. The pork belly is cut with a fork tender and is delicious. The sauce doesn't really look like what I normally think of a Thai curry (This was browner), but I don't care what you call it, as long as it tastes great.

It wasn't even that long of a wait, maybe around 20min. After we got our seat on the bar (we had four people, so a table would have been way better, but we wanted to have our dinner fast as one of us caught a cold and we wanted to head back as soon as possible), and ordered four ramen (low sodium yuzu shio, traditional yuzu shio, garlic tonkotsu, spicy ramen) and a takoyaki. Waited about 30min and we saw bunch of other takoyakis and other food getting prepared right in front as we were sitting on the bar, but we did not receive our food. I asked our server and the server told us: \\"we are very busy right now so we might have to wait a bit more, but I'll check the order status.\\" After 5 min he comes back again and says \\"oh I forgot to put in your order\\". No apologies at this point so we didn't really feel good about being in this restaurant but after 5-10min our food came out and we loved the food. Oh also, the other server who actually brought our food specifically asked us who ordered the low sodium yuzu shio (which I ordered) and I got whatever he gave me, and that was not the low sodium one (we figured out at the end of our meal when we were comparing the broth). If I had some medical condition and sensitive to high sodium food, this would have been a more serious mistake. As we were not treated like normal, we at least wanted a proper apologies. We haven't heard a word \\"sorry\\" or anything that sounds like it so far. l explaind what happened today to another server who took care of our bill (as we couldn't find our original server), and all we got was \\"ok\\". \\n\\nWe can understand how a restaurant can be busy with many people flooding in, but we paid same amount of money for their food and services.

We were sitting at the bar enjoying our coffee and the entertainment of watching a busy Sunday morning breakfast rush.  At one point a server stopped to answer the phone, and then proceeded to take a to-go order for what must have been a party of 8-10.  The server was pleasant and took great pains to get the lengthy order correct.  I have to say, I was pretty stunned that someone would have the gall to place such a huge to-go order at 9 am on a Sunday morning, especially at a breakfast place that always seems to be jumping on the weekends.\\n\\nNot long after we finished our breakfast (delicious, as usual), the orderer of the to-go order arrived.  She was grumpy looking and demanding -- she asked for more items, and had additional specification for the items she did order.  Here's the amazing part -- the Slappy Cakes staff (at least 3 people were helping this woman by now) were unfailingly polite (even friendly) and helpful.  At this point, I would have considered civil to be the maximum required, but they continued to help this semi-rude woman with her crazy order and additional requests.\\n\\nI would generally recommend Slappy Cakes for breakfast for the food (and yes, the novelty of making your own custom pancakes at a tabletop grill), but now I have to recommend them also for really good service.

I had sesame tofu, which was below average, tough and chewy with little flavor from the gelatinous sauce; girlfriend had walnut shrimp, which was pretty solid but hardly transcendent.\\n\\nOn the plus side, the pricing is very straightforward, with no delivery fee and a no-tip policy. The pricing is higher than similar places, so it may be a wash cost-wise, but I do like the simple transparency of it. The food arrived quickly and it was hot and fresh - which I can contrast to experiences with third-party delivery like Favor, where I've wound up paying double the menu price and have food arrive late and cold on various occasions. The fact that they use company-owned delivery vehicles and operate without tips suggests they pay and treat their people better than average for the food service industry. Thumbs up to that.\\n\\nOn the downside, be prepared to have to set up an account before you place an order, and to research any questions on their site, since you can't call and ask. I asked a question using a chat popup, but gave up waiting on an answer, which finally arrived after the food did - too late to do any good. Setting up your account seems to store your credit card for future orders, without an option to opt out, which I'm not a fan of... and a $15 minimum makes it useless for me to order a quick lunch for myself when I don't want to leave my desk.\\n\\nI'm sure I will order from Tso again, when the convenience of home delivery seems especially appealing, and the idea of, ahem, \\"Tso-Tso\\" Chinese food feels right."},{"name":"Kasbah Moroccan Cafe","address":"201 NW Davis St","city":"Portland","stars":"5","text":"Delicious Moroccan food, great prices, and awesome owner and chef... also don't forget to try their Moroccan tea!

However, for the money spent the kitchen's products leave something to be desired. I've thought long and hard about this review, and the more I think about it the less I like my experience\\n\\nTwo coworkers and I traveled here from Marietta to celebrate a milestone in our project on my recommendation. Reviews from magazines mentioned this was one of the best steakhouses in America, let alone Atlanta, and I jumped at the chance to experience it with two avowed carnivores who are very enthusiastic DIY types that grill their own with care. It was an ordinary autumn weeknight with no special events that I was aware of.\\n\\nReservations were easy and despite the restaurant being full on our arrival 5 minutes early, we were immediately accommodated with a table. Impressive. The interior is dark and very loud; there are not many soft surfaces to soak up sound and conversations ricochet off the hardwood walls sharply. Linens and service ware were impeccable and the scent of Parmesan permeates the establishment, which I found intriguing. \\n\\nWe asked quite a few questions about the full menu, all of which were answered well. We then went all out.\\n\\nAppetizers were 1/2 dozen oysters on the half shell and the mojo rock shrimp. The oysters were just fine though a little cluttered in presentation, but the mojo rock shrimp was an excellent and easily-shared standout. The habanero was not overwhelming in heat, but definitely made its presence known in flavor. The portion was generous enough for a light lunch if eaten alone. The bread plate offered was good, with the focaccia the most memorable.\\n\\nMy main was the bone in filet special cooked medium-rare and accompanied by creamed spinach and a twice-baked potato. The potato of the day was \\"loaded\\" style with sour cream, cheddar, green onion and bacon. The creamed spinach was great and my steak was cooked properly even if it was over salted. The potato of the day was not what I ordered and I instead received a poorly made twice-baked that was studded with what I thought to be poblano or possibly jalapeno peppers. It hadn't been properly broken up and mixed and so would up being more like a spicy baked potato. It was also dry enough that I had to butter it, which in a twice-baked is simply unacceptable.\\n\\nMy compatriots went with more protein and no vegetable, one opting for a 14 ounce New York strip and the butternut squash risotto and the other for the 22 ounce cowboy bone-in ribeye along with mac n' cheese. Both ordered the scallops as a steak accompaniment. I managed to finagle a bite of each item, and both the steaks were excellent -- cooked and seasoned excellently; mine must have been an outlier. The scallops were among the best I have eaten and came topped with what I believe was a light crown of alfalfa. Sadly, the mac n' cheese was poor, with overcooked pasta and bland flavor. \\n\\nThe risotto...where do I start? If I had made this risotto, I would have discarded it. I'm proud to be one of the few home cooks who makes risotto himself and it's one of my favorite meals; my coworker had never had it and I recommended this classic American version. I was downright embarrassed at how poor it was. It was obviously not cooked properly, yielding tough grains of rice that had not properly soaked up the stock and softened. The process for making this had not been followed.\\n\\nFor dessert the three of us split the ice cream bonbons, which on this evening were vanilla ice cream in a hard, dark chocolate shell drizzled in a salted caramel sauce. This dessert blew me away in its quality -- easily the best dessert I've eaten this year. Great quality and perfect balance. One order is three pieces, and so it was just right to share for our table. \\n\\nThe food was certainly hit or miss. In addition to the above, my Manhattan was fine if unremarkable. Our waiter's service was impeccable; sadly his name escapes me at the moment. With a bill for the above (no alcohol) we were over $270.00. For that amount of money, the food needs to be perfect. As it turns out, I mentioned the potato snafu and was told that sometimes they change the twice-baked selection mid-shift if they run out and my waiter was likely not notified. It was removed from the bill without even asking.\\n\\nKevin Rathbun Steak is a steakhouse with great service that may is coasting  in the kitchen. It is my sincere hope that management reads this and reevaluates their line staff to be certain that the basics get done right. The waitstaff is excellent, but at this price point I can't give more than a two-star rating. The value just isn't there. Sadly, the expense also means I doubt they will get a second chance.

It used to be one of the seemingly worst pizza places back 10 years ago but somewhere along the way their quality has gone up, while the quality across downtown has plummeted with the rise of Megabite and Fresh Slice. Where those slices are horrible, lack any taste other than that of burnt meat and grease, 2001 Flavours is the best and most reliable cheap slice in town. The place is big enough so you can actually sit down on rainy days, the staff are ridiculously friendly some days, variety is there, rarely dealing with dried out slices, and who can argue with the prices.\\n\\nHonestly have no idea why anyone even bothers going to the places near by considering the \\"quality\\" comparatively. Keep in mind that it's probably a mean thing to do to yourself too often given that this is still a street-style slice loaded with grease.. so don't do it too often. If you've got a big more budget and less interested in the getting full aspect, highly recommend Goldie's down the street.... more $ but its the best walk-up slice in town.\\n\\n2001 Flavours also has a daily special, so keep an eye out for them"},{"name":"U & I Thai Fine Cuisine","address":"3364 Cambie Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"3.5","text":"I ordered yellow curry with chicken and coconut rice which was okay (coconut rice could have been more coconutty), and my boyfriend ordered the pad Thai which he said wasn't as good as Urban / Pink Elephant Thai."},{"name":"Mission Sushi & Wok","address":"1625 Tremont St","city":"Boston","stars":"3","text":"Mission is always very hit and miss.

It's still efficient, but even when it's not busy it feels like the servers zip by without much time. I've had to ask for the complimentary tea more often than not (used to be offered right away, oolong or green) and refills of beverages in general seem to be lacking. \\n\\nThis doesn't mean that the food isn't tasty, although the ramen has become somewhat inconsistent, but as a long time customer it's been a little frustrating because once upon a time service was spectacular. \\n\\nIf I'd come in during an off time, I'd usually have no problem getting a small table and eating quickly, but on this last visit, even though it was fairly empty, I was told I can only sit at the bar. I ate as quickly as I could because my leg was legitimately starting to hurt and skeddadled. A personal gripe with the bar beyond my bad knee not liking its depth, is that there is still no place to put a purse other than the lap. \\n\\nI'll happily get take out on my way home sometimes, but feel frustrated as a customer that the hospitality has gone down hill.

I ordered the papaya salad, the mild one of the two and Ike's wings...the not spicy ones.  The papaya salad was great, everything was really crisp and the sticky rice that came with it was awesome.

The Ike's wing were cooked perfectly and were really sticky and messy, they give you moist wipes to eat it with.

The divier the mexican joint the better the food! \\n\\nI started coming here when this place used to be called Alfredo's. It was really a forgettable mexican restaurant somewhat trying to mimic Muchas Gracias but just a lot more ghetto. I was actually surprised how long it was open and had a feeling that I saw that this place was gonna go out of business soon. Inconsistent hours, poor quality of food, and laxadazy service. \\n\\nWhen I saw the signs that a new place was opening up I was happy to see that someone was coming in and trying to revamp the place. It took a few months but I was finally able to make it in one day. My first initial trip was not very impressive. Had the Adobodo tacos and a Adobodo Nachos. Again a little on the forgettable side. I didn't want to dismiss it quite yet so I made another recent trip and the person that I spoke with was very helpful in finding my perfect meal. A chili Relleno Burrito with Barbacao beef.  Oh man it was like rediscovering the burrito for the first time all over again. Tender morsels of marinated beef with a chili relleno in every bite. \\n\\nThe best part of this place is their selection of hot sauces. My favorite is this green sauce that is made with Jalapeno's blended with olive oil. It take about 6 of those mini containers of sauce to work with the size of the burrito. \\n\\nTheir portion sizes are gigantic and the quality of food is great. On my last trip I had that Chili Relleno burrito with Barbacao and two Carne Asada tacos and I was only in for $7.48. Super super cheap considering how great their food is.

One of the owners was kind enough to walk me through the restaurant's most popular dishes, explain some of the more obscure foods and ingredients to me, and accommodate my sister's allergies (she requested that her vegetarian meal be cooked in separate cookware). He seemed to be making rounds at all the tables along with the waitstaff, ensuring every one's meals were on par. It's rare to find that type of customer service in family-owned restaurants. \\n\\nFor our meal, we started off with Chicken 65 and the Paneer Pakoras. The chicken was incredibly flavorful and cooked to perfection, unlike other drier Indian chicken dishes I've had. Our waiter informed us of the many (albeit fictitious) origins of the dish: the chicken takes 65 days to marinade, it's made with 65 different spices, etc. A little bit of Indian culinary folklore definitely added to the meal! The Paneer Pakoras were equally as amazing - spicy, crispy, and served with four kinds of chutney.\\n\\nI've never had Tandoori Salmon before, but holy moly...it's a must have! It came out on a piping hot sizzler and was certainly the highlight of our meal. We also had the Chicken Malai Kabob (per our waiter's recommendation) and Muttar Paneer, both of which were incredibly flavorful and fresh.\\n\\nAnd lastly - the ambience. I expected some rather blas√©, hole-in-the-wall decor, but this restaurant felt like a classier Indian restaurant. We were there on a Saturday night, so there was a belly dancer performance, which gave the restaurant a super-cool middle-eastern/Indian fusion vibe. We had the chance to talk to the performer as well; she actually studied Indian philosophy in India and can tell you a thing or two about it.\\n\\nDefinitely recommend stopping by!

That was my first exposure to Ricker's adventurous culinary style, and I made a mental note to myself to try this one on my next visit to Portland. Well, here I was with Jamie W. in the decidedly hipster Southeast side of town, an area we had never visited before but probably saw on 'Portlandia'. It turned out we had plenty of time to explore Division Street because we were told it would be an hour plus wait for a free table. They even had me upload a special app so I would know how many parties were ahead of me and plan our return accordingly.\\n\\nWhen we finally got our table, we were squeezed rather precariously between a large party of big-boned women at a picnic table and two guys who were seriously into their chicken wings. Going to the restroom became an acrobatic gymnastic routine that provided an opportunity to perform a Tsukuhara vault. I didn't medal. Jamie and I decided to share three plates, and it turned out to be a hit-or-miss affair. First up was their signature dish, the $9.75 Papaya Pok Pok Salad, a spicier take on a green papaya salad and purely vegetarian with tomatoes, long beans, Thai chiles, tamarind, garlic, fish sauce, lime juice, palm sugar, dried shrimp, and peanuts (photo: http://bit.ly/2yKRUGm). Upon request, the dry ingredients can be ground up in a mortar and pestle, which is where the restaurant name comes from.\\n\\nIt was certainly fresh and crunchy enough though a tad more sour than I was expecting. We then shared the $14.75 Yam Khai Dao, a refreshing twist on egg salad with lettuce, Chinese celery, carrots, onion, garlic, Thai chiles, lime, palm sugar, and cilantro. We had them add fresh prawns to give us more variety from the Pok Pok dish (photo: http://bit.ly/2KfJLe3). This was our favorite of the plates. The third was more standard, the $13.75 Muu Seteh, char-grilled skewers of pork loin marinated in turmeric and coconut milk and served with peanut sauce cucumber relish, and grilled bread wedges which seemed unnecessary despite its authenticity (photo: http://bit.ly/2lv3UCb). All of it was good, just not great, and perhaps we should have ordered a more intense red meat dish or even the wings. Or maybe I should go back to Brooklyn for my Pok Pok fix.\\n\\nFOOD - 3 stars...fresh ingredients but not as transcendent as I recalled from the other coast\\nAMBIANCE - 3.5 stars...yep, it feels like a more upscale Thai beach shack, maybe too much so\\nSERVICE - 2.5 stars...server was stretched and her thoughtful approach seemed at odds with the waiting throngs\\nTOTAL - 3 stars...is it an East Coast/West Coast thing?"},{"name":"Island Creek Oyster Bar","address":"500 Commonwealth Ave","city":"Boston","stars":"4.5","text":"With high hopes went Saturday night...\\n\\nMaybe an off night, but the experience was definitely not amazing or fabulous.

This is nothing more than a mediocre casserole of rubbery lobster.  It tasted old, and I repeat rubbery lobster.  There no doubt they whip up a batch every day or two and scoop it out of a chaffing dish and serve it up as a fresh dish.  Lobster should never be rubbery particularly with an ocean full of lobster literally down the street, less than a 10 drive from the ICOB kitchen.  Ate 2 bites, sent the rest back!

My wife and I were super excited about trying the \\"best Chinese in Austin\\".  We visited on a Sunday evening and the place was packed - line out the door.  They had a system in place for taking your party's name, but we didn't know what was going on until a guy walked by us with a clipboard.  All in all, we had to wait about 35 minutes to be seated, which isn't too bad considering how crowded they were.  I had read the reviews and two items, Peking Duck & BBQ Pork kept rising to the top.  My family isn't as adventurous as I when it comes to food, so the duck was out.  The left me with the BBQ Pork.  Service was a bit slow, but we placed our order for the pork, Orange Chicken, and egg rolls.  The egg rolls tasted different than I've had before.  There was an unusual spice that I couldn't place.  It caught me by surprise and I wouldn't order them again.   The BBQ pork arrived and it looked very good.  However, when I took my first bite, it was lukewarm at best.  Parts of the dish were actually cold.  Very disappointing.  The texture wasn't crispy, but more like a Texas brisket.  Flavor was unremarkable.  Not good, not bad, just eh.  Combined with being mediocre in temp, and it was a dish I wish I hadn't ordered.  The orange chicken, on the other hand, was all kinds of horrible.  Had they used good quality chicken, it may have been one of the better dishes on the menu, but it was more fat than it was chicken.  Such a shame.  I wonder how this place has received the rave reviews it has garnished.  Is the duck really that good?  Possibly, but I didn't see many people eating that.  \\n\\nI recommend you try Hao Hao in Round Rock if you're looking for some delicious Chinese food."},{"name":"Powell's City of Books","address":"1005 W Burnside St","city":"Portland","stars":"5","text":"I have a serious problem. I love books too much. I love reading them, yes. And I love smelling them, OK. But I also love holding them. And staring at them. And bringing them with me wherever I go. I own so many books that my wife and I are planning our home renovation around the built-in shelves we need to add to accommodate my collection. Books are my drug and Powell's is my dealer.\\n\\nMy wife and I made our pilgrimage to Powell's last fall. We were on a two-week trip to the west coast and we spent two full days of that trip perusing the aisles of Powell's. The first indicator that I had returned to the mother ship was when I stepped into the Fiction section. I found myself in the D authors and began walking down the aisle so that I could appease my OCD craving and start with the A authors. This walk from D to A took a full sixty seconds. Let's just stop and think about that for a moment. In my local store, the Crow (which I love), a walk from the D authors to the A authors is actually a short step to the left. In Powell's, it took me a full minute to go from one to the other. That's how many books Powell's has. \\n\\nAnd their selection is amazing. Not only did they have what every book store has (a mind-numbingly large collection of Jodi Picoult, Dan Brown, John Grisham, Sue Grafton, and Danielle Steele books), but every quality author (Kingsolver, Vonnegut, Franzen, Eugenides, Krauss, Rand, Updike, Walker, etc) was well-represented. Honestly, I've never seen so many Vonnegut books together in my life.\\n\\nFor the collectors out there, I bought a Vonnegut 1st, a 1st of I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings, a 1st of the Pulitzer-nominee You Are Not a Stranger Here by Adam Haslett, a 1st of War by Candlelight by Daniel Alarcon, a new paperback copy of How to Escape from a Leper Colony by Tiphanie Yanique, and I probably spent combined on all books what the Angelou book was worth on its own. Their prices are competitive.\\n\\nEvery other genre was equally impressive. Their poetry section was larger than most used book stores. Their travel section was bigger than some small cities. My wife found pretty much every home and garden and arts and crafts books she'd ever need. If you can think it, Powell's has it.\\n\\nAnd then there are the extras: decent-sized and well-maintained bathrooms; discounted new books; tons of autographed books (they practically have an author signing every day); a cafe that lets you read your selections and rest your feet until you get your second wind; and a staff that knows its way around books.\\n\\nAnd if you're still not sold on this place, one final note worth sharing: that two week trip my wife and I took on which we spent two days at Powell's ... yeah, that was our honeymoon. That's how great the place is, and, of course, how amazing my wife is :)"},{"name":"Life Alive","address":"765 Mass Ave","city":"Cambridge","stars":"4.5","text":"This is a great place!

The plate was heaped high with shrimp, broccoli, pineapples, raisins, and of course fried rice. All the ingredients ranged from superb to superlative. The broccoli florets were soft, but still had crunch; the pineapple cubes burst with so much flavor you would swear their trees were native to Boston and producing all year; the shrimps were large and al dente, to borrow a pasta term, because that's how perfectly they were presented on the plate. As usual, however, their tails were still attached, which I'm still awaiting an explanation on from the restaurant world.

It's bad enough that I now refuse to eat here unless calling in advance to place a takeout order--and that is no easy feat either. I have never had the kind of hassle with calling a takeout order as I have with Life Alive. You really, honestly need to allot 15 minutes to get it done--10 minutes to spend trying to call in amid constant busy signals, 4 minutes to call and get placed on hold, and a final minute to place your order. Any way you look at it, the process of even getting your food at Life Alive is cumbersome at best. Sometimes when I walk by, I think to myself, \\"Don't you people have something better to do with your time than spend an hour of it waiting to order food?\\"\\n\\nThat said: I must admit, the food is worth the wait and the frustration, making it hard to stop returning to this little oasis of deliciousness. The flavors that Life Alive concentrates into its sauces tap deep into that \\"must have more\\" nerve.

The \\"warm meals,\\" the centerpiece of the menu, really are not technically hard to prepare--veggies layered upon grains, plus sauce and tofu or legumes--but the sauces alone are completely transformative--and crave-worthy.\\n\\nThe staff really does try to compensate for the seemingly inherent inefficiency in the Life Alive system, but that said, the wait times a HUGE turn off, and I really really just want to see Gordon Ramsey come in here one day and show this place how to maximize its potential.

(Well made, too.)\\n\\nThe pork chop was done almost perfectly: tender and juicy, and an excellent cut. (I only ate half, so the expense of the evening was partly made up for by lunch leftovers the next day.) The only downside was that it had been brined perhaps too long -- it was too salty, mitigated only slightly by the caramelized onions and sweet potatoes.\\n\\nThe star of the evening, though, had to be the Caesar: beautiful leaves left whole (as they should be); perfect dressing; delicate seasoned croutons; shaved parmesan.

And what a great experience it is to cook your own, at a griddle right in the middle of your table!\\n\\nI love dollar pancakes, and as far as I know, there is nowhere else to get them in P-town.  But now, I can make my own little tiny crispy pancakes.  I also hate under-done pancakes, but here I can grill them as long as I want to!  And add my own toppings?  Stellar!\\n\\nWe started with a bottle of buttermilk batter (shared between us), a lovely wine-tarragon apple sauce and walnuts for the toppings.  The table was already stocked with 4 different syrups and butter.\\n\\nAfter that was gone we were hooked,  so we ordered a bottle of pumpkin batter, and chocolate chips as the add-in.  The griddle stayed hot but not too hot to smoke the oil or burn us.  I liked being able to wait a couple of minutes between pancakes.  It forced us to eat slowly and really savor the food.\\n\\nAfter that bottle of batter was gone we ordered the savory bread pudding, which was an amazing concoction of veggies cooked in the bread, and sausage gravy to pour over it.  I wanted about 4 more plates of that.\\n\\nThe whole entire bill for two people? $15.  And we were stuffed.\\n\\nAnd there was so much more we wanted to try - the \\"Slappy Hour\\" menu includes a $3 grilled cheese, a $4 Slappy Joe, and the aforementioned savory bread pudding for only $2.\\n\\nInventive drinks, great service, fun music, cool decor, wonderful looking food on all the menus (check out my photos)....the best part?

Awesome.  The Game Hen was a close second in terms of the dishes we ate.  Also liked the Papaya Salad, and the Duck Salad, while good, had some unexpected chunks of organ meat, so if that's not your bag, beware.  (For the record, I really liked it).  I've never been to Thailand, but I would imagine this is as close to authentic Thai street food as you're going to find stateside.  Seriously, though, get the wings.  Also get some peanut sauce.  I was literally eating it with a spoon.    \\n\\nThis place would be a five star, except for the fact that Yelp scoring is based on ambiance, service and food.  This place has a cool atmosphere and for the most part the service was very friendly, save one moment that really irritated me.  The wife was digging in on the breast of the Game Hen and decided she didn't want to eat it like a carnivorous beast (behavior that in no way phases me, of course).  So she asked one of the server/bus guys for a knife.  He somewhat scoffed and begrudgingly with attitude presented us both with steak knives a few minutes later with nothing more than a grunt.  I get that it's Thai street food, but my internal dialogue went something like \\"listen you hipster *&^%, just because your new Chinese symbol tattoo is blistering and chaffing your back, don't take it out on me.\\"  When it comes to dining, I'm a firm believer that the customer is always right.  Let people eat things the way they enjoy them.  They're the ones paying.  So if the lady wants a knife, give her a knife.  \\n\\nThe hostess was also friendly.  And our waiter was super helpful.  The one thing that confused me, though, was that towards the end of our meal two four-tops in our dining area were set and empty for a solid fifteen minutes.  As we exited the restaurant, the place was a mob scene, so I don't think they are terribly efficient in terms of seating (and given the wait times at this place, that's a bit problematic).  It could also be a staggering thing with the kitchen, but it just didn't seem like the tables should have sat empty for such a long time.  (And for the locals that are reading, we did the Matchbox Lounge trick and the time elapsed was way longer than you would expect for someone to close the tab and cross the street).  \\n\\nSo on a return visit this place would probably get a five.

I think I just liked the name (I'm a sucker for exponents).  I won't be back.\\n\\nWe had some bland crab rangoon-type things, and a whole bunch of sushi.  I'm a sushi freak - I've had sushi in probably 30 states - and I've eaten at extremely fancy places, $150-per-person omakase places with sushi as part of the meal, places where the fish is flown in daily from Japan (no joke).  But I can still get down with a place like Ru San's (sacrilege!), because it's tasty and I get what the place is all about.  But this place just sucks.\\n\\nThe rice honestly tastes like my friend's first attempt at making vinegar'd sushi rice.  The fish was barely passable, and overall everything was extremely bland.  We ordered sashimi, nigiri, and rolls.  The sashimi was just ok, the nigiri suffered because of the amateurish rice, and the rolls were just plain bad.  Note to thai-sushi places: putting excessive cream cheese in everything isn't fooling anyone.\\n\\nI have no idea how good the Thai is here, so I'll give it 2 stars, but I'm not going back to find out."},{"name":"Bistro du Midi","address":"272 Boylston St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"Fantastic!

Got the white pizza, which I'm usually a fan of, and proceeded to eat it - until the last piece.  I picked up the last piece of pizza and found a bandaid wrapper underneath on the plate.  Not the actual bandaid, but the wrapper part that you have to take off in order for the bandaid to stick to you.  \\nMy friend and I proceeded to bring this to the attention of our waitress, who in turn got the manager.

We did continue with dessert (as it's made in plain sight), and the restaurant also brought us a  third dessert compliments of the house (on top of the two we already got with our prix fixe menu).

We stayed at the Commonwealth Hotel (hotwire deal) for a weekend getaway in Boston. My husband and I aren't great fans of raw oysters...the texture and the way it slides down the throat was just too much for us. But we still ordered the fried oyster slider. The sauce gave it a great kick! Our waiter was extremely nice and was extra helpful about recommending a Sherry for us to taste. Unfortunately, Sherry is just not me. I ended up getting a Riesling. We also got a clam chowder along with the oyster slider. These two are must try! I loved dipping the sour dough in the clam chowder :) The butter was honey spiced so it was super duper yummy. For main course I got the salmon while my husband got the scallops. I have to say, the scallops was OUT of this world. It was extremely delicious. The carrot puree was the star of the dish. You just want to lick every single morsel off the plate! My salmon was good but ok. I think next time I would try the monkfish!! To finish off, we had the banana cream pie. OH GOSH. YOU MUST GET THIS! GET TWO! GET THREE! Eat it all! The crust was graham crackers. Then it was a single layer of thickly sliced bananas. Then a layer of banana cream.

The price tag is equivalent to a weekend dinner buffet at other Asian buffets, but it's well worth the price.  Great selection of nigiri.  In my weekday lunch, I was able to sample salmon and red snapper.  Fish quality is 4 out of 5 stars.  There are a ton of rolls at this place - and way beyond the typical California or Philadelphia roll.  The rolls are very creative - quite a lot of combinations of fish with spicy sauce, cream cheese, peanuts, and vegetables.  The pieces are big, but some of the rolls were too sweet.\\n\\nThere is a cold vegetables section, which for the most part I avoided because I really liked the sushi.  The bok choy and mushrooms were well cooked.  Chicken katsu was a little dry.  Same with the gai lan which was served in the cooked vegetables section.  I do have to compliment the sauteed cod, which was actually moist and tasty - definitely above average for a cooked fish dish at an Asian buffet.  The teriyaki was also very good.  Not too fond of the gyoza or the items at the robato grill, but maybe that's just me.  For dessert, there's a variety of cakes and soft serve vanilla and green tea ice cream.  Okay, but the green tea flavor was a little bitter in my opinion.\\n\\nTo recap, best sushi selection that I've seen at a sushi buffet considering both variety and quality.

That's saying a lot considering how vast the store/building actually is. I almost felt compelled to leaving bread crumbs behind me so I could find my way back to the entrance of the store because it was soo big. The numerous floors of books took us nearly 2 hours to walk through. Mixed with new and used books is a great place for coffee as well. Powell's was great for gifts too. I was able to buy all of my unique souvenirs here at very affordable prices.\\n\\nAs a visitor to Portland, Powell's Books was one of the highlights of my trip. Tablets, ereaders, and smartphones are obviously the way of the future but I firmly believe there will always be room for books in peoples lives.

Both were okay, but really nothing special.  On my last go round I decided to go full on carb glutton and try the tantalizingly titled Green Chile Macaroni with Grilled Chicken.  While it mostly tasted pretty good and the portion was was huge, I got a few bites of chicken that were majority fat and that is enough to turn me off on this dish for life.\\n\\nWhere I've found the restaurant to shine is in appetizers.  When you are seated (and sometimes when you're waiting for a table) complementary cheese popcorn is provided.  I personally dig that a lot, saltiness be damned.  Also, jalapeno cornbread mini muffins are provided complimentary as well.  While I think the muffins could use significantly more jalapeno and moisture, the thought is nice.  As far as paid for starters, the  corn dog shrimp is unique and fun.  The beer battered asparagus is also a very solid option.  My personal favorite starter at Moonshine is the calamari.  It's thin cut, fried, crispy and served with a delicious marinara, just like I like it (no fancy pants non-fried or thick cut calamari for me).  It's among the best calamari I've had and the portion is large enough to satisfy 4 or 5 as an appetizer.\\n\\nThe service at Moonshine has been pretty good, though a couple of times I've had to wait longer than quoted.  On my last visit, my server reminded me a lot of Tobias from Arrested Development (I couldn't work/drink up the courage to ask him if he was a \\"never nude\\" though).\\n\\nMoonshine's atmosphere is fun and young, but not out of control in my experience.  The dim-ish lighting and stone walls furnish a mid-scale cave-like dining atmosphere, which is pretty interesting, especially in the cooler months.  Everywhere I've sat in Moonshine is pretty loud, so be prepared for that.\\n\\nParking is a little tough at Moonshine and you're often looking at having to valet at $6 + whatever tip you choose to give."},{"name":"Nori Nori","address":"6690 Roswell Rd, Ste 2110","city":"Sandy Springs","stars":"3.5","text":"Best seafood buffet I have ever been to.

On the website it says \\"Dont't forget about our Bottomless Mimosas & Specialty Bloody Mary's!\\"   (their typo, not mine for the word \\"don't\\")\\n\\n\\nWhen we got there and reviewed the menu, it said only the Mimosas were bottomless. On the menu it also said the Bloody Marys came with either bakon vodka or pepper vodka. My friend got there before I did and had already placed her Bloody Mary order. I asked her what vodka she chose and she said that the server didn't ask her for her choice. When her drink got there I tasted to see if I was going to order one myself. Her drink was absolutely disgusting. I typically love Bloody Marys. I have had them many ways at many restaurants and up until yesterday, I never tasted a Bloody Mary I didn't like. Everyone tasted their drinks and EVERYONE thought they were gross! The 3 people that ordered the Bloody Marys told the server that they wanted something different. At that point, the owner/chef came to our table, (Jordan Wakefield, we didn't know that at the time) He was visibly irritated. He informed us that he had been making the Bloody Mary mix for 3 years and that he didn't want to take it off our bill. We explained that we didn't want him to take it off the bill, that we just wanted to let them know that it tasted bad and we wanted a different drink. He definitely didn't treat us like valuable customers. He removed the drinks from the table. Then, some of our party ordered the bottomless Mimosas. I have had countless bottomless mimosas at many brunch spots around ATL. These had hardly any champagne. They were so orange. The birthday girl had to send her meal back as well. Her eggs Benedict was overdone. Of course at this point, after the owner being irriated, the server was not going out of her way to be nice either. The rest of the table ordered drinks and we literally watched them sit on the bar for 15 minutes while the server was chatting with another employee. Food and drinks came SO SLOW. The place was NOT busy at all. When we got the bill, they took off 50% of the price of the Bloody Marys and they charged us 17% gratuity. I think it so tacky when a server does that. I used to be a server and another guest is currently a bar tender so we are good tippers. I always tip good, well over 20% even if the situation is bad because I know how it is in that industry. \\n\\n\\nPros:\\n\\nThe BBQ sliders were delicious. The meat was perfect. The \\"white sauce\\" on the table was so freakin good! I put it on my sliders and dipped my fries in it. The gator tail was very good as well.\\n\\n\\nTip: try the BBQ sauces on the table before putting it on your food. The signature sauce is very smoky in flavor (sounds good, but trust me, it really isn't) \\n\\n\\nIMO, this place does well because it's in a great location in Castleberry and there isn't a lot around there. It's very convenient to the dome. However, if they don't change their attitude and service, they won't get any repeat business. \\n\\n\\nI guess we should have seen it as a red flag when we read on the menu that they only take take stuff off the bill if it's blatantly  cooked incorrectly. It said that people have been abusing the system. Maybe they should look into WHY so many people are sending stuff back. Maybe it's their recipes."},{"name":"Pok Pok","address":"3226 SE Division St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"On my first trip to Portland 2 years ago I came to Pok Pok and thought the food was amazing.

The lamb is excellent but the star is the chicken which is perfectly marinated and seasoned. It is juicy throughout and perfectly cooked every time. I have never had burnt chicken here...Not once. The sides are also perfect as the baked potato is flavorful and well seasoned. The rice is an excellent side and they give you enough to satiate your tastes without over stuffing you with unnecessary baggage. The salad is exquisite as it is crisp to the bite, fresh, and well seasoned with feta and an olive oil based dressing.\\n\\nThe pizza and pasta are also really good as it should be considering 'pizza' is in the restaurant's name. The pizza has a nice crust which is appropriately thick and has a nice crunch to it. The cheese, sauce, and toppings are always top notch and their pizza has become one of my favourites in Vancouver. The pasta is also extraordinary as you get a huge amount which can last you two meals (or one if you're a big eater like me). If you asked for it baked you really get your moneys worth because they load it with cheese which is awesome. \\n\\nOverall Olympia is a great restaurant. Delivery is quick and the service in the restaurant is awesome. They make a real effort to remember you so you get this familiar vibe every time you go back.

I checked them out online beforehand, and although I didn't immediately feel drawn to a particular dish, we came anyway because it looked interesting and sounded cool. \\n\\nHappily, they had Mac and cheese on the menu... Which is basically my kryptonite. And here's what I loved: I asked our server on a scale of 1-10, was the Mac a 12. And she... Was honest with me: she said it's kind of new, so she hadn't tasted it yet. Apparently the sauce looked amazing, the bread crumb topping looked heavenly, and I appreciate honesty far more than telling me it's delicious when it isn't, or when you haven't had it. So. I got it. \\n\\nFriends. FRIENDS. It's a 12. If you're into mac, you must get this mac. The sauce is perfection in the flavoring, and the parsley in the topping is perfect. And the serving is massive. Especially for $10. \\n\\nNow off the mac train: we also ordered the salmon dish($16), which came with squash and peppers, the pork belly French toast with grits ($13), and the shakshuka($10? 12?), which was well loved among people who have come. The shakshuka is this cool tomato dish with okra, bell peppers, and a fried egg on top. Served with flatbread.

Like most, I had heard many great things about the kitchen: this could possibly be the best French restaurant in the city.... It's not. And the reality that anything besides the food has caused my humble opinion to be brought down to this level speaks clearly to something that is glaringly wrong in the way BDM conducts its operation.\\n\\nWe set a reservation for 8:30pm on a Saturday night, and while I was surprised that they had availability on short notice, it did not seem all that alarming and no red flags were raised. After all, our first and second choices were booked, so this was a good opportunity to check out a new spot for us that had a table open. Arriving promptly at 8:30pm, we spent the next half hour waiting to be seated. Not so much as a greeting in that duration, as I watched hosts fumble about their station, somewhat frantically, and through the dining area. Note, that there were only two parties (including ours) waiting. A lot of spinning wheels over a seemingly manageable sized crowd. \\n\\nOnce we were seated, my date and I took in the restaurant's ambiance. I noted that the decor was impeccable; I couldn't have possibly dreamed up a more fantastic and smartly designed dining room if I tried. The space was full with families, older 40-50 something couples, and seemingly Boston's shi-shi elite. The pretentiousness aside, we remained somewhat optimistic despite the really sour note that had already set the tone on what would be a not-so-great idea.\\n\\nAs we were talked through some of the menu items and specials, I couldn't help but notice the heavily perspiring server reading from a card. I thought that to be quite out of the ordinary for such an esteemed dining establishment and more questions throughout dinner were left unanswered without the slightest intent on finding out answers. Nonetheless, our order came as followed:\\n\\n- We started with a nice Ch√¢teauneuf-du-Pape at about $85 (maybe a $20 markup); it opened up quickly and held a nice earthy texture throughout dinner. It seemed a little tannic, but this could have just been my over-thinking it.\\n\\n- Sweet Corn Soup, Ricotta Gnocchi, Chanterelles, Thyme $11- Nice, soft and delicate; could hardly tell chanterelles were in this dish though\\n\\n- Spicy Lamb Tartare, Quail Egg $11 - big, hearty flavor, absolutely mouth watering!\\n\\n- Grilled Mediterranean Sea Bass, Slow-Cooked Fennel, Sauce Vierge $28 - not even close to worth the price, forgettable flavor profile\\n\\n- Classic Bouillabaisse $29 - great flavor, no saffron (seemingly) and the fish was cooked perfectly. I know John Dori isn't all that common in this town, but I struggled with the price on this one too. Still, and excellent stew.\\n\\n- Lavender Beignets, Chocolate Sauce $9 - a dessert I'd rather forget. Just seemed too much like eating donuts. I've never had beignets like this; just seemed very pedestrian as was the chocolate. \\n\\nOverall, this was a very disappointing experience at over $250 for two people. I could say that it was worth another shot, maybe at the bar, but really at this price; why? You've got one chance to make it in a sea of excellent restaurants, and if you take people's money without regard for a FULL dining experience then what does that say? It's sloppy and rude. Your food may be really good, but I don't want to feel like I'm 19 again, waiting in line on Lansdowne Street  to get into Avalon.

Despite my butchered attempt at reciting my order in Spanish, she was really nice and friendly.\\n\\nAfter sitting down, we were offered menus and complimentary chips and salsa.  Their chips have a lot of substance as well as a big crunch.  Their salsa may not have the taste of fresh tomatoes, but it definitely has the right level of spice, where your tongue can feel the heat, but it's not too overwhelming.  Definitely a fan.\\n\\nI ordered three tacos: the Pastor (marinaded pork), Barbacoa de Chivo (goat), and Lengua (beef tongue) tacos.  You could choose to have the tacos in a flour or corn tortilla, and I had all three of my tacos to have a corn tortilla.  I typically don't like corn tortillas, but theirs were toasted, had a lot of substance, and tasted great.  I felt like I was eating two layers of hearty tortillas rather than a weak piece of bread - a plus!\\n\\nThe Pastor had a tasty and strong flavor from the marinade.  The pork may not have been as tender as I hoped it would be, but the taste was surely there.  Also some pieces of pork were 80% fat, which greatly contributed to the flavor.\\n\\nThe Barbacoa de Chivo is a rare find for a taco, and it was made deliciously.  On the first bite, you could taste the gamey-ness of the goat.  The goat dripped oil packed with intense flavor.\\n\\nSome restaurants serves beef tongue that is way too overdone.  The Lengua here is very tender.  The couple of fatty pieces already make this taco worth getting.  However, It would be nice if they were cooked in a way that would bring out more flavor from the meat.  But if I came back, I would get this again!\\n\\n3 tacos for a little under $6?  A great way to grab a quick and cheap meal that'll still stimulate the taste buds.  No heavy sauce or excessive spices needed at La Fruta Feliz: for each taco, it's all about the meat's original flavors.

(The only other restaurant around Boston where I've experienced something similar is the host/hostess crew at Abe and Louie's).\\n\\nDetails:\\nWe arrived about 10 minutes early for a 7:30 reservation and after making our way to the Hostess station, we were asked to follow one of the other hostesses, and she ultimately came to seat us at a table next to the doorway in the back of the resraurant that serves as the extrance/exit for the service crew into/out of the kitchen (I assume).  As we arrived at the table, I asked if there would be another table for 2 we could have to which I was told no.  I then asked if she had any idea of when a currently occupied table for 2 would be expected to turn over.  Her reply was \\"the current wait is 1hr 15min, would I like to wait?\\"  This is where I started to get pissed.  How many people who have a reservation are going to say, \\"Yes please ... I'd like to wait another hour plus for a table???\\"  In my estimation, and based on the tone in her voice, she was trying to be a pain in the a&&.  More to the point, she didn't answer my question which was simply, I'm willing to wait for a while if there will be a table for 2 that was going to turn over in maybe 30 minutes (i.e. a table that sat down around 6ish pm).  Her last comment to me was \\"would you like to sit at one of the high top tables\\"?  Again, as the high top tables are located in more of what I would consider to the bar area and there were easily 40-50 people just standing around those tables, it again didn't seem to be a reasonable alternative.  Long story short, we sat at the table we were given and laughed it off as best we could -- nothing like being given the worst table in the house and then being treated like you are out of your mind for suggesting to them that the table sucks.  (In truth, if we hadn't been out for our wedding anniversary, I would've walked out on the spot and let her and her manager know what they could do with the table).  Fortunately for us ... it was our anniversary, and we stayed, becuase what followed was unreal!\\n\\nFirst off, kudos to our waitress.  She was a wonderfully cheerful person with a great sense of humor.  She stopped by the table within a minute or two of us sitting down and through some combination of her welcoming us and a couple of other comments she made, she had both my wife and i laughing in a couple of minutes.  \\n\\nAs for the food....we decided to go with heavy apps/small plates and then finish with an entree.  We started with the Clam Chowder (ridiculous flavor, and just the right thickness!!!), 2 Oyster sliders (neither my wife or I are huge oyster fans, but these things were breaded and fried perfectly, and were definitely worth returning for), and a half dozen shrimp cocktail (perfectly crispy, and absolutely enormous...at $2.50/shrimp, I actually felt that it was the same price as if I bought them at a fish store and made them at home ... huge bargain in my estimation).  For the next round, we had an order of the mussels in the white wine sauce (these were good, not great .. didn't love the sauce they were in, and it seemed a little fishier than most mussel dishes we've had over time), 2 more oyster sliders, the crab cake (1 huge cake, seemingly with very little filler in it ... it had to be 80+% crab meat in it .. cooked perfectly again), and although it seems a little weird, I also ordered a biscuit (as there was a Salted Honey Butter w/Cayenne that was brought to the table to go with a basket of bread) -- I thought the butter on the buscuit would be killer.  (In truth, the biscuit, which is a monster in its' own right comes out with honey & butter over the top to begin with.  It was a little denser than many biscuits I've had, but it didn't take away from the enjoyment in any way.  It was awesome ... completely unnecessary...but was so good, I kept picking at it through the rest of the meal.  It easily could've been enough for 4 people to pick at.\\n\\nWe wrapped up by splitting the Lobster Roe Noodles entree that I've heard so much about in many of the reviews on yelp.  Great call!  While the description/idea of having pasta with braised short rib and lobster may sound a little different/odd, it went together perfectly.  The tastes married perfectly...and as the dish was a bit heavy (not to mention all of the previous food we had eaten, splitting this entree worked out better than I could've hoped for).\\n\\nTo ICOB's defense, this is graduation season and anyone foolish enough to go near BU for dinner in the midst of this chaos deserves what they get.  At the very least the dinner service was spot on, and the food was killer!"},{"name":"Milwaukee Market Creamery","address":"1342 Hornby St","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4.5","text":"* The Japadog of Frozen Desserts *\\n\\nSo Japadog became a Vancouver craze by introducing Japanese flavours to the common hot dog:  http://www.yelp.ca/biz/japa-dog-vancouver-2#hrid:AU8LQg2aEV3RSOedGR9BiA\\n\\nMilwaukee Market Creamery seems to be going the same route by fusing Filipino flavours with a classic Wisconsin frozen custard base - I bet you can't find these flavours in Milwaukee!\\n\\nThe tropical theme continued with this latest visit.

I love sangria.  I love garlic.  I do not love garlic infused sangria.  Maybe this was just my imagination.  What was not my imagination, however, were the chipped glasses that we all received.  Any restaurant with chipped glasses automatically gets points taken off.  \\n\\nThe tapas were above average.  The espinacas (saut√©ed spinach with figs, honey, and garlic) was amazing!

The menu is divided by kind of base booze (bourbon, whiskey, tequila, rum, gin), and then further by the kind of ice that is contained in the drink (long pours, fizzes, stirred, and ??? can't remember). \\n\\nSpeaking of ice...that's a big draw here. They have a GLORIOUS Clinebell ice machine which allows them to make crystal clear ice in any shape/size/amount that they want.  For example in the long pour drinks you get one ice cube, but the cube is as long as the tall glass and helps your drink stay cold and more importantly, the ice doesn't melt as quickly, so your drink really maintains its proper taste and integrity.\\n\\nEach of us got two drinks, and a different drink each time. We all tried sips of each others' drinks and I can say that EVERY drink was PERFECT and DIVINE. All were expertly made all well in balance and as a bonus their appearance, bar ware, glasses, etc. were also gorgeous. I can't remember all the names of the drinks we got, but I do remember that I decided they had both the best Sazerac and the best Manhattan in town. A bold claim ...I know.\\n\\nObviously, I feel very passionate about this place. GO and you won't regret it.

The cutter's choice, tender, and chicken. All 3 were AMAZING. I asked to also sample the sausages which were both meh (original and jelpeno). Couldn't sample the ribs because they were \\"on the bone\\". Too bad. For sides, I tried the cream corn and beans. Cream corn was far superior.

It was not the tender, soft, juicy meat that I had sampled. It was hard, dry, looked old and overcooked, and INCREDIBLY salty! To the point I had to down at least 4 cups of water as I ate it. So sad about that because it was so good when I first tried it.

Just try a piece. Or four. It really is that good. Plus, it's free, and will make you feel .1% better about the $80 seafood platter you're about to get.\\n\\nThe seafood platter here is overwhelmingly huge and delicious... it's actually the biggest one I've ever seen. But here's the important part: it has best oysters, best scallops (with black sesame seeds, thanks), meatiest lobsters and shrimp, and most fantastic littlenecks I've ever had. Even the cocktail sauce is phenomenal.  \\n\\nAs far as cold lobster rolls go, this one takes the gold. Kettle chips and slaw seal the deal as the perfect textural accoutrements. I recommend ordering one as an appetizer, because they'll cut it into four little sliders for you so that the tasting fun can continue. I also tried a cod dish served with ricotta gnocchi, which was incredibly tender and savory. The serving is pretty hefty, too.

It didn't help that family groups of 10 were taking up most of the restaurant's capacity. Once we were seated, everything moved fairly quickly. Now on to my meal...\\n\\nPepper Lunch is a restaurant where you can cook your own meal (mostly the protein component) off of a sizzling hot plate. I'm serious the heat on that hot plate is legit! I had the Beef Pepper Rice, which is off of their classic menu. It included thinly sliced rare beef (which was slowly cooked by the hot plate) around a nice portion of rice and corn topped with pepper seasoning. The finished product is essentially a fresh serving of beef fried rice. Overall I really liked my meal. I enjoyed the experience of cooking the meat and mixing everything together. They had additional sauces on the side which you can add to your meal and so you can adjust flavors to suit your personal taste. My favorite was their miso sauce.\\n \\nSidenote - At the table next to us they made an error on the customer's order. They accidentally added an egg to his lunch!!! What a lucky accident!! Who wouldn't love a surprise egg in their meal??? How could he say no?? Don't worry he didn't. \\n\\nOverall, I had a lovely experience at Pepper Lunch.

Specialty pizza for $2.25.\\n\\nService: The friendly and helpful staff will warm up your pizza without you asking when you order one that has been out of the oven for a while.  \\n\\nAmbiance: This is a very cozy and can get very busy during lunch hours.

The thought that I might not get another opportunity to eat here since I'm from out of town is depressing, to say the least.  Years ago, I started out hating oysters, then thinking they were okay, then really enjoying them, but this place skyrocketed them to one of my favorite foods.\\n\\nIsland Creek is a beautiful place to eat at in Boston, away from the congested areas with throngs of people and cars.  Located in a hotel right next to the Kenmore station, it's not a far walk if you catch the subway.\\n\\nMy friend and I sat at the bar to eat, since we couldn't secure a reservation, and since there is no wait to sit there.  At ~$3/each, oysters in Boston are not cheap, but they are worth it.  I love the concept of an oyster bar, where you can select oysters from specific areas.  I started out with six oysters...one Island Creek, one Flying Point, one Blue Pool, one Northern Cross, and two others that I can't remember.  They were all SO good though.  They serve them with a vinaigrette, some cocktail sauce (I suspect, but never tried it) and lemon wedges.  Whether I ate them plain with lemon or with the vinaigrette, they were all incredibly good.  My favorites were definitely the Flying Point and the Island Creek.  Blue Pool had a buttery finish but it's itty bitty.  Overall amazing oysters though.\\n\\nWe also each had a fried oyster slider on a brioche bun with lime aioli and arugula...it was VERY good.  The oyster was plump and almost tasted \\"chicken fried.\\"  The no-shell mussels with white wine, shallot, parsley and what I think was pearled couscous were awesome.  They were served with grilled bread which elevated the dish further.  The ceviche with basil and cucumber, I believe, was the best I've ever had.  \\n\\nWe finished the perfect meal with the lavender cream filled doughnuts with berry coulis.  I could drink that coulis, it was so delicious.  I didn't catch the taste of lavender in the cream, but no matter.  \\n\\nI loved our entire experience.  Our server was friendly and eager to give us suggestions when ordering.  I wouldn't even mind going back here and having to sit at the bar and put up with the annoying people who insisted on standing right behind my chair half of the meal.  I think this is a must in terms of restaurants to eat at in Boston.  FYI, you can buy Island Creek oysters online and have them overnighted.

I won't use the most overused and superfluous word used in reviews, 'authentic', I'll just tell you, the kitchen and staff speak Italian, the ceiling is covered with Football(Soccer to us Americans) jerseys, you can't tell by the size and decor if you're in a nice restaurant, deli or wine shop and dishes are available here you cannot find anywhere else in Portland. So if that's authentic to you then it is.\\n\\nWe went last night for the third time and my high expectations were topped. Whenever I come here I always get the initial feeling that I have crashed a private party, the staff seems aloof and harried, I wonder if I can get a table....etc. \\n\\nWhen we arrived last night (A Friday) the place was packed, we were told to expect a 15 minute because we did not have reservations. There was one table for two at the window open and we assumed it was set aside for a reservation, the guy at the front kept checking his watch and the reservation list, finally after a very short 5 minute wait, he seated us at the open table. Snooze ya lose!\\n\\nWater and bread with the most delicious olive oil, were immediately brought to the table, a menu bearing waitress soon arrived with and told us about the specials:\\n\\nWaitress: \\"Tonight's specials are Rabbit with sauteed vegetables, a braised lamb shank with Polenta and.........\\"\\nMe: \\"Do you mean Osso Bucco?\\"\\nWaitress:  \\"Yes, it's just whenever I say Osso Bucco people ask me what it is\\"\\nMe: \\"Well you don't have to explain it to me, I know what I'm having\\"\\n\\nThe rest of the night I heard her explain the specials several times and never once heard her refer to it as Veal Shank again.\\n\\nAs I said, the place was busy, packed to say the least, and the staff was doing their best to get to everybody, I did have to hail a person once to get some wine delivered, but they answered my request quickly and congenially. \\n\\nI had the Osso Bucco (Surprise!) and a delicious salad of fresh greens with apples, nuts and a very light vinegar and oil dressing. My wife had the pasta with the wild Boar sauce and the same salad. Everything was incredibly delicious, perfectly prepared and portions were generous; we brought home half our entree's. The carafe of house wine was also delicious. \\n\\nI mentioned that whenever I first arrive here, my general feeling is one of ambivalence from the staff, and this time as in times past, it soon melts away and I start getting the feeling I am at a family party. Shortly after we were seated, 'Papa' arrived. I say that because everybody was calling him Papa. He was a spry elderly Italian gentleman that stopped by every table to refresh waters, pour wine and engage in a little conversation. He certainly made the evening more enjoyable and from his interactions with other patrons I witnessed, I gather he made it enjoyable for others too.\\n\\nAs we left, I basked in the feeling of love from the food and the staff, and probably the wine too.

When I lived in Lowell, and now when I visit, I'd try to make an effort to stop by and have a plate of pure joy! \\n\\nNow that I am suffering from a health issue and can only eat food that isn't laden in herbicides, pesticides, gluten, sugars, growth hormones and antibiotics, I am thrilled more than ever that there's one close to me now. I cook organic all the time now but sometimes I just want to eat out, and now I can. I do prefer the atmosphere of the Lowell restaurant over the Cambridge one though, and I'm hoping that when they finish downstairs they'll make it as inviting as the one in Lowell.\\n\\nAnd for all the reviewers who claim there's no scientific evidence to back up the claims that organic food is better for you, that's simply not true. There's plenty, but you must read all scientific evidence, not just the kind that's funded by the food processing industry.  Unfortunately, that's the kind that winds up in the mainstream media, so you must do your own research to find the real evidence.\\n\\nBut who needs a scientist when you have common sense that should tell you that food laden with chemicals and meat loaded with antibiotics and growth hormones is not good for you? Have you noticed how many people are on medications these days and how many people suffer from chronic fatigue syndrome, acid reflux, IBS, candida albicans, depression, bi-polar disorder, hypertension and of course cancer, not to mention the rise in cases of autism and alzheimer's disease? All of these and many more relatively new illnesses and \\"syndromes\\" are a result of chemical and hormone laden and nutrient poor foods no one should be eating.  \\n\\nOrganic food is simply food that isn't tainted with poisonous chemicals. Sadly, because so much of the soil in the US has been depleted of nutrients, even organic food is not as nutritional as it once was, and is why people should take vitamin supplements. So the issue is not about organic being more nutritional as it is about not possessing toxic chemicals. Even still, organic is more nutritional when grown sustainably, and farmers practice crop rotation, which limits nutritional leaching of soil and the need for chemical pesticides and herbicides. \\n\\nBut seriously, why would anyone want to eat pesticides or meat tainted with growth hormones and antibiotics in a land where waistlines are evergrowing? They say the French eat more fat than Americans and yet they're not fat, and we certainly are. Why do you think that is? Part of the reason is that growth hormones are banned there as well as other toxins.\\n\\nSo if you're wondering why you can't lose weight, consider eating organic only, visit Life Alive for a delicious plate of pure joy, and see how quickly that waistline shrinks!"},{"name":"Keke's Breakfast Cafe","address":"4430 Curry Ford Rd","city":"Orlando","stars":"4.5","text":"This was my second time to visit.

The restaurant is oriented toward the West and the breeze that blew almost constantly kept it feeling delightful (not sure that would be the case later in the day).  \\n\\nAs to the meal, the high points were the Blueberry Pancakes, which my wife had and the Sunrise Bowl, which I had.  First, the pancakes; they were fluffy with just the right consistency, not overly sweet and you could barely tell that it was somewhat healthy, ahem, with quinoa and greek yogurt as two of the ingredients.  She could not have been happier with this dish.  \\n\\nThe Sunrise Bowl was quite a revelation.  In addition to eggs, it had ancient grains, sweet potato, grilled portobello, avocado and hemp seed, which all by itself would have been crazy good and totally different than anything I have ever had for breakfast/brunch.

What are they thinking and why didn't anyone ever think of this before?\\n\\nUnfortunately, there was one downside to our experience.  I ordered the Scratch Bloody Mary.  My advice is that they \\"Scratch\\" this one off of the  menu.  It tasted like a watered down marinara sauce and no matter how much salt I added to it, it was just awful.

Ajitaro is inconsistent as when I ordered it before, it came with vegetables; however, this time it just came on a bed of blanched beansprouts that I couldn't care less for. The gyoza was not worth the $4, and that is saying something. It had hard edges and was definitely purchased in bulk and cheaply, as the gyoza ripped apart once dipping in the ponzo sauce. The chopped scallop roll was decent, that being the very best part of the meal, despite its loosely put together appearance. \\n\\nOur waitress (long, reddish hair tied back) was incompetent. Understanding that this is an AYCE restaurant, I would expect far more staff in a restaurant as popular and known as this. When asked for one glass of water, she dropped off two and a large, full pitcher of water, which, I suspect, as a waitress myself, was for a different table, as no other tables of less than 3 people had pitchers. \\n\\nShe was very loud and sociable, but not to the right people. She joked openly in Chinese with her female coworkers. The male servers, honestly, seemed far more competent and capable of efficient service, as they were evidently annoyed at the unprofessionalism of their senior servers, and they always had food on their trays, unlike my waitress, who never had a tray of food. \\n\\nWhen I initially waved my waitress down for some extra teriyaki sauce, she made eye contact with me and smiled. I assumed she was approaching me, but she only ignored me and carried on. She was also incapable of bringing me my bill, which, I might add, is also traditionally given when someone also asks for their meal to be packed up, but even when requested twice, she didn't bring it.\\n\\nI ended up having to go to the front cashier to pay, and it was a struggle to even WANT to tip for their service.

It's some variation of a mini don, a ramen, and 4 pieces of sushi (I've gotten 4 every time despite the menu saying 3 - no complaints haha). You're only limited to the regular ramen or the spicy version of it though, and I always go for the spicy. The broth here is definitely a bit more on the creamier end, but not as creamy as Santouka's (which I'm not a fan of). I said the ramen here ranks second to Pikaichi in Allston for me. I've also tried their mapo tofu ramen which I thought was a-okay. It's kind of a weird combination of texture and flavor.\\n\\nEven though this is a ramen place, I have to say their sushi is so fresh and delicious. I've never been disappointed with the few pieces that come with the combo. The salmon is SO good here! I've tried some of their other rolls too which were good (I can't remember which one though). The takoyaki is good, a bit on the smaller end, and the fried squid legs were delicious, but I'll probably pass on the sushi burger. I don't know what I was expecting to be honest but it literally comes with your regular supermarket sesame bun - not worth the money.\\n\\nThe main reason for my review today though is because I literally just finished eating my take-out salmon sushi burrito. I haven't been to the restaurant itself in a while but I see that this is a new addition their menu - in with the hype! At $10.25, it's a bit thinner in comparison to other sushi burritos I've had but it's worth it. There isn't anything similar to this in the area and the salmon is fresh like usual.

Spinelli's used to have some of the best food I ever had. Their ingredients were fresh and homemade. After the old owner, Joe, left a few years ago it has consistently gone downhill. Everything is pre-packaged. Nothing is made in house anymore. On my latest visit I ordered a simple ham, egg, and cheese sandwich on a croissant and what I got is pictured. The croissant isn't even real.  It's white bread. No flaky crust like you'd expect. It's not light like you'd expect. It's heavy white bread cut to look like a croissant (and there's an up charge for that!). The sandwich itself had little flavor and a lack of ingredients that didn't even occupy the entire sandwich, as you can see. Wholly unappealing. My normal fare is the turkey artichoke panini and even that now lacks the same fresh ingredients it used to. It's now a salty yet bland (try to figure that one out) remnant of itself that is missing the roasted red peppers and even the artichokes sometimes (how do you forget an ingredient that's in the name of the sandwich?). Their once glorious soups are either out of stock or taste like they came from a can (the last time I got tomato bisque it was acidic and had a metallic flavor). I've attempted to call when mistakes are made but there is never an answer. It's sad to see such a once wonderful neighborhood deli decline into mediocrity, all to save a dollar (which is, I assume, the only reason to change ingredients). There used to be lines to the door. Not any longer. Even the staff are lackluster with a slowness that had me waiting 15 minutes for a simple sandwich (no other customers). The interior has even changed to include fewer tables and a bland, boring decor that isn't reflective of the vibrant neighborhood they are a part of. Spinelli's used to be a favorite. I've given them chances off and on over the years. It's been disappointing and now I am done with them. If someone from Spinelli's reads this: get your act together. Stop cutting corners. You had a fan base. All you had to do was keep everything the same. You didn't and now your loyalists are gone. Look at the other bad reviews. Take them to heart.

I'd heard great things about this place, so we decided to try it. We walked in around 12:30, and there were quite a few open tables. We waited at the front for a few minutes, and we didn't see a host/hostess at the podium. Of course at most restaurants, this is code for \\"seat yourself\\". Not here, apparently.\\n\\nWe sat down and immediately started getting angry glances from the waiters and the woman who turned out to be the hostess (apparently she was M.I.A. when we walked in). Every time the hostess would walk by with a group, she would shoot us an angry glance out of the corner of her eye. The waiter in our section would take the order of the adjacent table, walk by us without saying a word, and take the order of the table on the other side of us. (C'mon, if we screwed up, just tell us!). Finally we started getting a bit frustrated after 10 minutes of being obviously ignored, and we tried to flag down a waiter to ask if we should go back up to the front to be seated. The waiter in our section looks over, sees us trying to flag him down, and immediately turns around and walks off. We tried to flag down the waitress in the next section over and the hostess, and the same thing happens: they glance over, then turn their nose up and keep walking.\\n\\nBy now we're in a pretty bad mood, and I don't know what compelled us to stay and be seated. We get seated in the section with the waitress who ignored us earlier, and she seemed pretty terse with us the entire time.

Too spicy for me but if you like spicy, this dish has your name all over it.  The pok pok lunch special is a perfect meal with all the wonderful blend of flavors ranging from sweet, spicy, and savory.  The curry noodle soup was good but not the best I've had in PDX.

Their dry aged steak for 2 , consisting of a filet and strip, gives the Cowboy Ribeye - which is outstanding and dreamy- a run for its money. I have trouble when I go here deciding between the two. The steaks are so well seasoned. That's the thing about Kevin Rathbuns food- at all his restaurants- it's like he's the seasoning God or something, because everything is just seasoned to perfection. The jalape√±o creamed corn is out of control fantastic as well. Service is impeccable every single time. The bread selection is quite fantastic as well.

I arrive around 7ish and my friend dropped me off to wait on the line so he can find parking. The wait was about 2 hours due to the fact this place is pretty compact. Had about 3 tables for 4 people, 1 table for 6 people and 2 tables for 2 people. There is only 1 waiter ,1 cook and like 2 dishwashers. The kitchen is open and you can see all the food being made. So when we finally got seated, we were requesting to put in our order; however, the waiter says he'll be back in a few minutes. Well after waiting for for 2 hours, you'd probably have read reviews on yelp and know what you'd  want to order or try. The waiter comes back about 10 mins later and takes our order. We ordered the Calamari meatballs for appetizer and Lobster fra diavolo and Aglio Olio( Ground squid saut√©ed with garlic and olive oil ink pasta) for entree. The waiter was very nice and told us that we can change the Lobster fra Diavolo to a one person portion which cost $52. The usual order is for 2 people and goes for $79. I never had calamari meatballs but this was pretty good.  The flavoring and tomato sauce was so good my friend and I started just eating the tomato sauce after we've cleared the meatballs. The Lobster fra diavolo had a mix of lobster, shrimp, calamari, mussels, clams and some spaghetti. The tomato sauce that it was in was so tasty. It tasted like the sea and mostly mussels. The ink pasta was definitely something I still think about and crave for time to time. It is very flavorful and the ground squid is just the perfect match with the garlic and olive oil. Definitely a must try. I gave this place 4 stars because of the wait for the seats, wait for ordering and the wait for getting the check.

Let's be real, when you think about Florida, cheesy and tacky usually come to mind; however, this place is anything but. \\n\\nOur room was very nice and clean, accompanied by a huge and spacious bathroom. A plus was that we had a balcony overlooking the (side) pool area. \\n\\nThe service we received from staff/housekeeping was excellent over the four days. I never had any issues, and all were very polite. \\n\\nI tried several restaurants on the hotel grounds, as they were home to a few of the cocktail parties during the conference. Wonderful food, great wait staff! \\n\\nThe pool area was extremely large, and the lazy river was perfect. There were several kids around, but that's never bothered me. Sometimes it was hard to find a pool chair, but again, that's to be expected when you're in Florida during March! The servers in the pool area were all very friendly and helpful.\\n\\nDuring my stay, I booked a spa service at the Ritz (connected to the JW). That, too, was excellent and a perfect way to spend a stormy afternoon. \\n\\nTo be completely honest, I wasn't expecting to like the hotel as much as I did. Great job, Marriott. I will recommend this to others looking for a place to stay in the Orlando area. The only reason I knocked it down to 4 stars was due to pricing on some items ($14 for a small tube of aloe!) and the fact that their Wi-Fi was not working almost the entire time I was there.

It was a Friday night and we went there a bit early since they don't take reservations on weekends. The decors pretty simple with a touch of Greek favor in the new renovation from the last revue. On that evening, wee ordered the Rabbit Kalamakia, Moussaka and Country Lamb. The Rabbit Kalamakia was great. We loved the tender rabbit loin sausage wrapped in smoky favor bacon. This dish would be great for a wine tasting appetizer (white wine especially) or share it among friends, because one sausage popsicle would satisfy one's palate (I would think). The Moussaka was good. The dish was cooked perfectly, well- balanced of mixed eggplants, zucchini and ground beef and it was not greasy unlike other Greek restaurant (stacked with cheeses and olive oil). However, I would loved to have more of the Bechamel sauce on the side because I believed it would enhance the favor of the dish and it refreshes one's palate. The Country Lamb was the best dish for the night. The roast lamb was tender and melts in your mouth as advertised. The rice, lemon potato and other veggie were all a great compliment to the dish. As a noted, the lamb dish is portioned for two or more, I definitely recommended to be share.\\nThe services for this place was pretty good. The bartender/waitress had a great attitude to her job and knew her position in the revue. The only thing that I did not like was the speed of the service. I felt a little rush and we finished our dinner in an hour. I guess the manager may want to slow down a bit and let us enjoy our experience.

It wasn't jazzy and it definitely wasn't romantic. Despite the ambient lighting and the decor, the atmosphere just felt nightclub-ish and wrong. The live music was also lame. I expected jazz and got a cover band instead with a lead singer who seemed drunk and immature for a middle-aged man. \\n\\nSecond, the service. Our server was nice enough, but he didn't demonstrate a mastery knowledge of the menu when I asked him about drinks and dishes. Worst of all, the tip was added to our bill when he brought it out.

Really?\\n\\nHave to admit, I was skeptical... drove by many mornings to see the Fish Market sign and the shaded windows at the sushi venue and thought to myself, 'aww, love the local fish market idea. Gotta check it out. Oh, its next to a sushi place. Wonder if they're related?'\\n\\nSo, on one hangry afternoon, I decide to give it a try.  Its 3:30, so I'm not expecting a line or anything.  But there are other people dining as well as people picking up takeout.\\n\\nTo my pleasant surprise, the fish market is connected to the sushi restaurant and offers a simple selection of popular choices, including sushi grade salmon (cod, tuna, swordfish, scallops, shrimp, and oysters).\\n\\nOkay, so the sushi restaurant.  I'm giving 4 stars because I'm in Reading and the pricing here is phenomenal. Fish is much better than pricing suggests.  I ordered the Chirashi, a selection of raw fish served with rice for $13. Unbeatable price.  I also ordered a cup of miso soup ($1.50), which was served with a crab stick.  Not necessary but memorable.  The gyoza ($5) left me with a bit to be desired, though, and left me curious about other kitchen items.  And I'm sad I didn't go for a special maki, 10 piece monsters for as little as $10.\\n\\nIt's a small place, not pretty, but quaint, not a place for a first date and no high chairs or changing tables for babies.

Anyway, Haily, an employee at the bar who helped us with our take out order was amazing. She was extremely friendly and knowledgable about the food (especially as they just opened). Definitely the highlight of my visit was customer service from Haily. She also made sure that my order was put in quickly and made within 10 minutes (WOW!

Dishes we ordered: artichoke pizza, tomato & mozzarella pizza, the Moroccan half chicken, and the grilled chicken salad. Everyone loved everything! The pizzas looked wood-fired (my favorite) and had good ratios with thin crust, ample cheese, and fresh toppings. The Moroccan chicken was devoured by my friend, he loved it. The chicken salad was very fresh and had tons of add-ins: cranberries, manchego, almonds, dates, with a champagne vinaigrette that I simply must find the recipe for! The best part I think was the desserts. We had the chocolate cake, the lemon tart, and the strawberry rhubarb crisp.

The wings were fragrant and delicious! The chicken was juicy and the skin was crispy -- just the way I like them. The sauce was unevenly mixed onto the chicken because some wings were too salty. The veggies that came with the wings helped ease off some of the saltiness. The spareribs were tender, but without the two sauces that came with them, they would be bland.

Add in the fact that they're open late on Sundays and serve super-fresh seafood and it was a perfect storm. \\nWe could not have been happier with our experience. I know previous reviewers mentioned poor service, but I think they may have been dining during the peak hours,  because we received amazing service from Zach. I told him about our special occasion and he brought over some amuse-bouches as well as a free biscuit. He also recommended some superb cocktails. We had the clam chowder, oyster sliders, lobster roll, and lobster roe noodles. Everything was amazing- super fresh, super flavorful. I should also add that I am not a huge seafood fan, even though I grew up in MA. I will eat and enjoy seafood if it is high quality and prepared properly. Needless to say, everything we ate was seafood and I absolutely loved everything. Our pace slowed toward the end of the meal as we got too full, so Zach brought over a digestif (on the house) that helped a lot! When we were done, we asked him where we should go for just one more cocktail and he recommended Hawthorne, a sister cocktail lounge just downstairs. He escorted us, let the bartender know we were there and we continued to receive superb service (and more free stuff!). I like to think that this is partly because of my boyfriend's and my winning personalities, but both establishments also seemed generally hospitable.

Since we were on a schedule, we sat at the bar. \\n\\nLet me start by saying (as other reviewers have) that the food was very good. We had the Queso Laredo (cheese dip with beef) and a chicken quesadilla. Both were very good, though to finish the queso would have required a second bowl of chips. We also had a beer each, and they showed up promptly (albeit switched). \\n\\nThe service experience, however, left a lot to be desired. Not that the staff were rude or slow; it's just that they were nervous, error prone, and very uncomfortable. Our bartender was very nervous, edgy, and awkward. After switching our beers around (there were only two of us), he took our order. A few minutes later, he came back telling us that the ceviche (our original order) wasn't available, then launched into a long rambling explanation of how that was weird, because he just ordered it for someone else. We had to cut him off to order our queso. When the queso arrived, the waiter who brought it seemed confused or disturbed that we needed chips with which to eat it. At one point another waiter snuck up behind us to ask if we needed chips and salsa (long after we'd already been there). \\n\\nAlso, this place is expensive. Our two beers and two appetizers cost $30 with the tip.\\n\\nAgain, I want to stress that the food was good. The two star review is primarily based on the awkward service and price.

The seasoning on the super fresh tilapia is perfection, the creamy chipotle sauce was awesome, and the cabbage slaw was great... Not for those who are sensitive to spicy food as it has caramelized jalape√±os in addition to the mildly spicy chipotle sauce. I'm sure you can special order them not spicy if you're a weenie   :p\\n\\nAfter chatting with our server outside, we found out he's the owner and that he will be opening during the week soon, and that he eventually wants to serve beer, which was the only thing missing.

The island creek tasted very pure and I kind of used that as a baseline to judge the other types of oysters. The rocky nook in comparison is more sweet whereas the sippica and wellfleet tasted more salty. I had all of them with only a few drips of lemon juice since I feel that any of the other sauces would take away from the actual experience and taste of the oysters. The only thing that's a bummer about this place is that since it's so popular and famous, the wait was a good hour before we got seated on a Sunday dinner night.

I'll pass. I love looking at all babes, right guys?

So I guess I'll start there. Bathroom is decently decorated, but only one urinal? Also what's up with the soap container being awkwardly placed and the hand dryer on the other side of the room? (Side note: no paper towels?!? This is America not the Middle East, stop being so frugal and buy your random passer byers that need to pee some paper towels so they don't have to wipe them on their pants because then air dryer is so weak. Thanks.) \\n\\nI didn't want to be a complete hobo so I grabbed me a drink as to not be rude. They have a good draft selection and plenty of bottled beers for an enthusiast like myself. So you won't go thirsty. The 'tenders were pretty cool and seemed knowledgeable. \\n\\nI didn't get any food but I saw the waiters carrying it around (seemed like 100 people work there, do they just hire people to walk around?) and I must say I would have eaten any of it (No not because I am a fat) because it looked and smelled great. \\n\\nIn conclusion this places gets downgraded from 5 stars to 3 stars because of the vacant hostess (nice butt though), one urinal and lack of paper towels.

This place is about the food, not about the ambiance.\\n\\nOne oddity about the menu: no appetizers.  Pok Pok touts itself as family style, but I think this is a slight misnomer.  Family style (too me), means really large servings of food that may be a little costlier per dish, but the portions more than make up for it.  Here, the dishes are small, not so expensive ($8-14/dish) and  are intended to be shared. The portions are akin to large apps.\\n\\nOne cool thing the menu does do is talk about the food, not just in terms of ingredients, but also in terms of what sides might go with it, or whether it is a favorite, a traditional dish, etc.  \\n\\n- We got the spicy wings: a favorite - and cooked to spicy perfection.  These were more savory than truly spicy, but did leave a warm feeling on the lips.  Yum.  Can see why this is a fave.\\n\\n- Also got the Herb Salad (Yum Sumaa Phraa): carrots, cashews, parsnips with a very subtle flavorful light sauce/dressing.  My friend liked this enough to overcome her dislike of carrots, which should say enough about the goodness of this dish.\\n\\n- Finishing out the meal were the pork ribs (though honestly these were more bone-in medallions than true).

Take away food that is an honest, high quality home cooked meal!  What a way to end a long work day on a Friday.  Didn't feel like cooking and stopped here to give it a try.  I heard about it through friends and seeing a story on Chronicle.  \\n\\nMy partner and I ordered the mushroom tart and arugula salad to split, along with a chicken dinner and pot roast dinner.  Upon seeing Mexican chocolate ice cream and flour-less chocolate cake, how could we pass on that?\\n\\nI was impressed with all the thought that went in to the menu choices (including creative items for vegetarians and vegans), and packing for take out. Each dish had simple and clear instructions on how to heat, treat and eat, and all the packing is environmentally friendly.\\n\\nBut let's get back to the point:  the food. This is not food for people that like bland. The tart had an amazing pastry shell and the mushroom filling was packed with flavor.  The arugula salad was fresh and was well balanced with fresh pear slices and a lovely soft blue cheese added. I had the pot roast dinner that had perfectly roasted and seasoned fingerling potatoes and brussel sprouts and my partner had the statler chicken plate with broccolini and panzenella.  The meats were prepared so well that after heating them up at home they were cooked perfectly and not dried out whatsoever.\\n\\nFor good measure we also had the mexican chocolate ice cream and flourless chocolate cake.  If you like chocolate...nuff' said.  My only constructive criticism would be that there might have been just a few too many chocolate chunks in the ice cream.  Normally I would not call too many chocolate chunks a bad thing, but chewing on a lot of frozen chocolate took a little bit away from the creamy goodness of the ice cream itself.  Maybe it was just a fluke of the batch.  I would be happy to try it again to see :) .....\\n\\nI love to cook and I love high quality, creative food, but some days I just don't feel like cooking.

Do something simple and do it really well, and you'll have me hooked. So when I ordered I went simple.\\n\\nThe tortilla soup was done quite well, so well, in fact, that it left me wishing I'd ordered a bowl instead of a cup. Also had to try the shrimp corn dogs because I was curious. It's exactly what it sounds like. The shrimp was cooked sufficiently, and the corn dog batter was thin but good. Nothing about then grabbed me and made me say, \\"These are awesome!\\" They're exactly what you'd expect from the name and competently executed. Nothing more. Nothing less.\\n\\nAfter that I thought I'd try the chicken fried steak, the most straight-forward entree on the menu. As a wise man once said, if you're going to open a restaurant in Texas, you'd better be able to make a decent chicken fried steak, and even though Austin is only Texan in the most technical sense of the word, I thought it applied. Solid portion size on the steak. When you get a chicken fried steak your first thought is supposed to be, \\"Man, that's big.\\" They got that right. Otherwise it was once again a competent job. The steak was good. Nothing special or outstanding about it, but just very good. Exactly what I wanted out of a chicken fried steak. The steak fries were also done well. In my experience thick steak fries often translate into not quite cooked through. Not the case here. These were good.\\n\\nThe one thing that I can legitimately call great about my experience was that my server, Tom according to my receipt, was super friendly and very attentive, even after I'd been there a while and he had several more tables going.

We were smart (or lucky, depending on your perspective) and arrived at 4:30 PM, so half of the restaurant's five or six tables were half-empty, but within half an hour every seat was full and there was a line out the door.\\n\\nFirst impressions: Wow, this place is tiny. The entire restaurant fits in a space only slightly larger than the kitchen in our apartment. Small isn't bad in this case. Normally I tend to stay away from the small and cramped restaurants in North End, not because I hate small restaurants, but because there are plenty of larger restaurants that serve great food without a cramped feeling. Here, however, sitting up against a wall with the kitchen literally just two feet behind me created an ambiance larger eateries can't replicate.\\n\\nBoth of us were famished and couldn't resist the urge to load up on bread, which was more than passable.

A bit more sweet than I expected. Fish was well-cooked. I expected nothing less.\\n\\nThe squid ink pasta was the reason we decided to come to The Daily Catch in the first place. It definitely lived up to expectations. The alfredo sauce was superb -- thick, rich, and heavy without overwhelming the palate. Textbook. Squid ink pasta came as thick noodles. It was hard to identify why the squid ink pasta tasted so good... it just did.\\n\\nI've never had calamari meatballs before, but I'd gladly order them again. You can taste and smell the squid pretty clearly. Otherwise, it's just like a regular meatball, albeit with a very spongy, springy texture. The sauce was delicious -- we used the bread to mop everything up.\\n\\nService was extremely fast and to the point, but friendly. We were in and out in about 45 minutes.\\n\\nIt's not quite a 5-star restaurant -- impressive, sure, but somewhere short of amazing.

It was juicy and tender, but....that's it. There was nothing more to it. The beef wasn't particularly dry-aged or otherwise well-settled or supremely cut.

We opted to sit at the bar to get dinner and drinks. It took at least 10 minutes for someone to acknowledge us, even though there were three people working the bar and it didn't appear to be super busy. We ordered our drinks and an appetizer and mentioned we would be getting dinner as well. We got our appetizer, ate it and waited a while before we could get the attention of our server to finally order our meals. I ordered a gf flatbread pizza, which was great. My bf ordered swordfish, though he was served salmon. We had to get the servers attention again and tell him there was a mix up. He admitted it was his mistake, he had put in salmon rather than swordfish and said he would correct it. He had my bf keep his sides in the meantime, which thankfully he did because  when he finally got the swordfish, it was served with sides that were cold. I was done eating by the time my bf got his meal, I tried to wait to eat with him but it took a while and my food was getting cold. In addition, the couple next to us were also having dinner. They were at the end of their meal when we sat down. I could tell because they had all kinds of plates around them, appetizer, salad, etc. that could have been cleared since they were clearly done with them and just about done with their main course. I mention this because the dirty plates were pretty much on my place mat and made things very crowded. Again, it took a while for a server to finally come over and clear the plates, but that was only after they got their check.  Long story short, it was just not a pleasant experience. And to top it off, I forgot to give my number for the loyalty points and the server didn't ask, so we didn't even get credit for the bad experience.  I gave it three stars because I am sure we will try it again, given the gf options and our past two experiences, I just don't know that we will sit at the bar again.

There were about two mussels out of twelves that were moist. Also they weren't easy to come out of their shell, they were so over cooked half of the mussel would get stuck and string back like an elastic band. Ugh. The fries were good, but hard to ef that up.

I would have liked if it was a bit on the spicy side, but that was easy enough to correct with hot sauce.\\n\\nMy other goto now is the Cancun combination plate which comes with a pretty big steak enchilada that has the steak actually pretty tender and flavorful. Also comes with a chicken enchilada covered in one of the best sauces I have ever had from a Mexican place which is a poblano sour cream with a poblana drizzle, just added to the flavor of everything when you spread it around. It is so good. And not to forget the cilantro lime rice which is one of my favorites anywhere I go is a must have from here. It is an explosion of lime flavor and cilantro with every bite making it the perfect side for everything else.  (If you don't like lime do not get it, its strong)\\n\\nOverall this place is going to become my go to Mexican from now on as so far all the food I have tried has been really flavorful, cooked properly, and has arrived hot and fresh tasting.

They rotated the original design 90 degrees counterclockwise to make room for a higher priced (enclosed) addition. \\n\\nPrices were high, but have either increased or the portion size was reduced; newcomers will not even blink.... The former basket of churros is now 2 small sticks of cinnamon sugared extruded fried batter, and what could be cheaper to make???

The outside looks like a makeshift of wooden beams and planks to form a shelter home, while the inside are just packed with tables and chairs with a vinyl plastic cloth covering the table for patrons to eat off of / easy cleaning.  The only walls are literally the 3 that are holding the structure up with the front of the restaurant being an open space so you can literally see the entire restaurant from up front. There is a menu on a stand that's outside for patrons to check out to determine what they want to eat while waiting (and TRUST ME, the waiting time was over an hour) or for people to take and go. This saves time since then people don't have to bother the host/hostess for a menu. \\n\\nI cannot attest for eating inside the actual restaurant (just know that it's always super packed because there was not a free chair in sight when I went), but for those that want to take it to go, there is a small area off to the right hand side of the restaurant (where the utensils and to-go boxes are) where there's a small window to talk to order to go. I eventually decided on Ike's Vietnamese Fish Sauce Wings and I do not regret it one bit! I paid and got my order within 10 minutes or so.\\n\\nWhen I opened to to-go box - the smell of fish sauce and BBQ enveloped my smelling senses and gnawed at my stomach to just take a bite.

In a rare turn of events we were seated almost immediately after waiting only a few minutes in line (It was a Wednesday night, afterall). The servers were polite and friendly, but seemed to be stretched too thin and were definitely bustling about with little time to breathe. Overall, the restaurant was comfortable and the atmosphere casual. \\nI ordered the vegetarian Khao Soi and the mango alexander. The mango alexander was out of this world: creamy coconut milk, mango, and fresh lime zest mixed with vodka. Unbelievable cocktail. My noodle dish was also incredible- very different than currys I've had before. The flavors were light yet somehow complex- a coconut based broth that achieved that perfect Thai balance between sweet, spicy and savory. The noodles were perfectly prepared, and soon after ingesting them they wrapped around my soul in a tight, warm embrace. Lots and lots of tofu too!! \\nSince I'm a veghead I wasn't able to try the other dishes ordered at the table but from what I hear they were pretty spectacular.

Everyone looked a bit confused as to whether we should just dive right in or wait for some kind of intro, and I think they could have easily remedied this by bringing the drinks/food out right when the event started instead of prior to seating.\\n\\nFinally we got started... the manager would give us a spiel on the cocktail, and then the pastry chef would comment on the desserts she had made, and then we'd try each while they walked around to interact with the guests. We got some helpful tips (\\"try both ways, eating first and then sipping, and sipping and then eating\\") and it was neat to chat with the pastry chef because she's obviously passionate about what she does. But I thought they left too much space in between each pairing (it doesn't take 20 minutes to finish a bite-sized dessert and drink your 3 oz. cocktail)\\n\\nAs for the food: I was a fan of almost all the desserts. The tiramisu had too much bitter chocolate powder on top that made it unappetizing (plus I accidentally inhaled it which wasn't fun), and there was no rum which was too bad because that's the main reason I like tiramisu. But the others were all really solid, especially after learning about what went in to each and why the chef made the choices she did. I was impressed with the cheesecake, it was light and flavorful and not like a typical NY style, and the Chocolate Decadence was rich and velvety with a great flavor that got even better as it got warmer (that was one of the tips given, to heat it up).\\n\\nDrinks were less than impressive, I really liked the St. Germaine Sparkler, but the others were just average (the 'mojito' wasn't really a mojito, the Tropical Sunset tasted like college aka your run-of-the-mill Sex on the Beach, the Espresso Martini had begun to separate).\\n\\nI thought this was a decent deal, they were all tasting portions of course but I was satisfied by the end. I liked hearing from the pastry chef which added to the experience, and she did have some tasty desserts to share. But the whole set-up/schedule was strange and the cocktails could have been better."},{"name":"Boston Common Coffee Co.","address":"515 Washington St","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"Pros:\\n-4 new creative donut flavors every Thursday! Find out what they are the night before by following @bostoncommoncoffee on Instagram.\\n\\nCons:\\n-Can't get your heart set on the awesome donuts, because the flavors are infrequently repeated!\\n-Dough is on the heavier/butterier side; yeast donuts in particular seem a little bit oily \\n-Vegan yeast donuts are too chewy and not very flavorful. Go to Veggie Galaxy for a better vegan donut! \\n-Not always possible to reserve a donut in advance, despite what staff may say on the phone (I didn't have one waiting for me after I called and asked to have one placed aside...)\\n\\n--\\nDonuts are $2.48 each (EDIT: 8/18 now they seem to be $2.70 each)\\n\\nUbe w/ Coconut Milk Glaze\\nUbe (purple sweet potato) cake donut with coconut milk glaze. The glaze tasted standard to me and the color wasn't the bright purple color you'd expect from an ube dessert, but the texture of this cake donut blew me away. It was incredibly moist and had a delightful crispy exterior. The flavor was very subtly sweet which was complemented by the glaze instead of being sweet on sweet. There were some small bits of ube inside (not sure if intentional) that added to the texture/color. I never wanted this donut to end. Easily the best donut I've had from BCCC (maybe I'm biased because I requested it during one of their requests for ideas...?), and one that I hope will return some day!\\n\\nChocolate Chip Cookie Dough\\nEssentially a Boston Cream (yeast donut with chocolate icing filled with vanilla cream/pudding) topped with cookie dough and studded with chocolate chips in the filling. I love that the donut was more than just cookie dough added on top--the chips inside added great texture and did make it seem like a different donut flavor. The dough was thick and buttery--still a little too chewy, but much less so than the vegan version. The chocolate topping was the perfect balance of sweet/bitter. Overall, a solid donut. \\n\\nMint Chocolate Chunk\\nYeast donut topped with green colored mint glaze and chocolate chips. The glaze was a bit \\"toothpasty\\" on it's own, but overall wasn't too strong. This was an okay donut but would have been much better with a chocolate cake base.\\n\\nReverse Boston Cream ($3.26)\\nYeast donut with a milk chocolate mousse-esque filling topped with vanilla frosting. This is possibly the heftiest donut I have ever encountered. It was huge and generously filled. Given that the dough itself is fairly heavy and buttery, this will hit you hard. The frosting on top was overly sweet. However, the best part of this donut, and what makes it worth trying once if it's repeated (it has been before), was the delicious chocolate filling--I was expecting straight chocolate pudding but it was much richer and creamier. \\n\\nGlazed Cake Donut\\nPlain glazed cake donut. This one was huge in height and definitely required some squishing in order to bite into it. The glaze was a little too sweet and the exterior had only a very slight crisp. The cake-y interior was soft and a little chewy but mainly tasted like cinnamon, and you could see the flecks of cinnamon inside.\\n\\nCannoli\\nYeast donut filled with cannoli filling (ricotta base with chocolate chips) and topped with a nice subtle lemony glaze, chocolate chips, and cannoli shell pieces. The donut was overcooked and the filling didn't make me think of cannoli as it was too runny. Creative, though!\\n\\nChocolate Covered Chocolate Cake\\nChocolate \\"cake\\" donut with chocolate icing. Weirdly tasted in between yeast and cake, which was disappointing. The chocolate flavor also wasn't very strong. \\n\\nVegan Coffee Oreo\\nYeast donut covered in coffee glaze and topped with Oreos. The vegan dough was super chewy and the only flavor was the coffee glaze. The Oreos didn't add flavor or even texture because they were stale. Will likely avoid vegan yeast donuts in the future.\\n\\n--\\n\\nI have to give BCCC high marks simply for their creativity: coming up with 4 new and interesting donut flavors every single week would be a huge accomplishment for a donut place, let alone a coffee place! However, I'm staying away from the vegan yeast donuts and it seems like it's tough to actually have donuts put aside for you."},{"name":"Island Creek Oyster Bar","address":"500 Commonwealth Ave","city":"Boston","stars":"4.5","text":"Yup.

Szechuan beef was so spicy one of my family members almost had a medical event.  It contained mostly huge pieces of green peppers, large quantities of whole red Chile peppers and water chestnuts with a few pieces of beef.  Pepper Fish Fillet was mostly fish flavored breading.  The House Special Chow Fun had the most ingredients, but was still mostly noodles; the overall flavor impression:  soy sauce flavored egg noodles.\\n\\nWhat I like about Chinese food is the interesting flavor combinations, vegetables, meat, noodle base all complementing each other.

Instead of focusing on the food and staff in general (all are excellent), I was to focus on something important: the gluten free menu. My girlfriend has Celiac Disease, so outside of Disney World and a handful of other locations, it is difficult to find somewhere good she can eat. We saw that they had a gluten free menu, and upon arrival, it was a true actual menu (not just a portion of the regular one). All of the staff was exceptionally knowledgeable about the disease and the precautions for food preparation. We were advised that the owner herself suffers from Celiac Disease, and that is one of the primary reasons that they go out of their way to ensure an incredible array of food for those that suffer from it or other gluten-intolerance diseases. My food, which was not gluten free, was amazing, and it was one of the best pizzas that I have had in years (and I mean that). My girlfriend said with zero hesitation and no exaggeration that it was the best pizza that she has ever had. Their regular menu and quality of service alone would have ensured that I recommended it, but add in the gluten-friendly menu and other items, as well as the very fair price and awesome employees, and it ensures we will be going back over and over.

Here's the mediocre execution -- the counter space is too small so your plates will be half on the grill, and you barely have enough room at the table for all the toppings.

Great hibachi station, and as many rolls and nigiri and sashimi as you could hope for for 30 dollars. The one thing I really disliked was the sashimi. It was badly cut, especially the tuna. It seemed that they didn't remove the connective tissue, which resulted in very chewy pieces of raw fish that did not go down easily. They were also drenched in some sweet sauce. What? Why do that for sashimi? I hope it's not to mask the lack of freshness. It seemed the majority of rolls were also sweet, which drowns out the flavor of the fish.\\n\\nOn the topic of freshness: the quality has gone down over the years. The raw oysters were a dull color and had none of the sheen or freshness that I used to love; same with the sashimi, which had more fishy taste than usual. \\n\\nThe hot food, however, is consistently pretty tasty and is an improvement; they do many preparations of shrimp and they do them all well.

Vivo has been my favorite Mexican restaurant in Austin for the past two years now (ever since I found the place). The staff is amazing, from the bus boys and waiters, to the managers, I've never had anyone working here give me anything less than 5 star service. The food is fantastic, my favorites being the shrimp relleno, steak Jalisco and pollo vivo. If you go for lunch, the puffy tacos, verde and chili con carne enchiladas are soooo delicious! And their tortilla soup is seriously the best I've ever had. I also like that they serve a whole grain brown rice, a healthier alternative so that you can order desert :) The margaritas seriously are by far the best I've had. The house is a classic staple but they also have some really tasty more exotic ones. The bar staff (and all other staff) are all very friendly and I always enjoy my conversations with them. I live more than 30 minutes away but it is completely worth the drive!\\n\\nI was actually eating at Vivo last night and had to listen to some of the rudest people I've ever heard, going off on one of the Managers. It was something about them not accepting a gift card for a different restaurant. What kind of people complain about not being able to use a gift card for an old restaurant that has been closed for several years, at a new place? I saw that they posted reviews about it and the poor customer service, I couldn't help laughing at how inaccurate their reviews were! The manager was extremely nice and accommodating to them, even got the owner on the phone (at 9pm) to help resolve the issue. If I was him I would have thrown them out and banned them for how rude they were! So if you see two recent reviews about them not accepting gift cards, please know that the people writing them are despicable and everything they wrote was completely false. JD was the manager working and handled the situation very well (as well as he could for people who obviously just want free food and are used to complaining and getting what they want everywhere they go). I also want to give a side note that Anayeli is my favorite server, she is amazingly sweet and has a great memory! She always remembers things we talked about the last time I was in, and knows all my favorites!

The very last time we had delivery, we called to say it had been an hour (we only live 2 miles from the restaurant) and they challenged us.  No apologies, nothing.

I've been to every wing place in the Orlando area and I haven't found any better than these. They have a few different sauces to choose from. My favorite is the regular bbq sauce. I've tried a few other tai sauces that were good but I can't remember their specific names. The chicken is really tender and juicy and they have a great flavor! \\n\\nLast but not least I recently tried their calzone and it was really good too! Way better calzone than Mellow Mushroom.

The red sauce had depth, which was nice. The black ink pasta had zero flavor difference besides being thicker and chewier than the linguine.

Flavor wise, it's about the slow smoke, and the rub (spice) which to me, is the marginal part.  I have never seen a pit ,or any type of smoker.  I CANT TASTE any smokiness in the meat, and it has no real char crust either. The other meats I have tried at Rudy's left no impression other then the the Baby Back ribs  which I dunked in sauce. ( I do like the sauce) For people looking for real deal Texas BBQ, head out to Lockhart where you will truly find some of the best BBQ in the world."},{"name":"Pok Pok","address":"3226 SE Division St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Pok Pok was a very good Thai place to try.

I moved to Austin on a Friday and bought a GPS Saturday morning because I knew I would get utterly lost without one. Sunday morning I met up with a friend who happened to be here on business and we wanted to go Magnolia Cafe on South Congress after being recommended to do just that. The wait would be up towards an hour there, so with growling bellies, we sat in the car. I said \\"I could do...steak\\", hit up the Points Of Interest function and picked out the American Steakhouse category. \\n\\n\\"Moonshine Patio Bar & Grill, huh? Well, all right.\\"\\n\\nNearing the place, we realized we'd made a good choice - the banner promoted brunch and in we went. I only wish I had been more hungry to try everything out.

We sat outside on the covered patio with a huge Christmas tree and I enjoyed the fact that the coffee was drinkable. In America. Who knew?\\n\\nI decided to come back for dinner and did so no other day than New Year's Eve with a couple of friends and my girlfriend. We ordered our not-too-expensive and actually quite potent signature drinks (can't remember the name, but they had some variations of Cosmos and some variations of Long Islands) at the bar before being promptly seated (reservations were a must). \\n\\nPro Tip: If you're hungry and want a starter, go for the Moonshine \\"corn dog\\" shrimp with Honey Mustard & Blueberry Swirl. Just do it.\\n\\nThe food was good but nothing amazing. The prices are not very high for the size of the portions. This is not haute cuisine, it's comfort food that'll get you full and happy. And the drinks will most likely get you drunk, if you let them.\\n\\nThe decor is awesome (I love exposed brick), the water jars are funny, our waiter was nice and helpful but not overly intrusive and it didn't put a huge dent in my wallet.

I go to the Brassica on High Street quite often.  I actually hold the Duke title on yelp for the Location on High (Pats myself on the back). And I've been waiting an awfully long D**M time for this one to open!\\n\\nBiggest question i had to myself before coming: Would I get the same quality with the food as I do with the High Street location. Answer is: Yes. The food is still incredibly good. The thing i love most about this place is how all the flavors differ, but all come together in such harmony. I don't want to seem sappy, but I love this place lol. I would never think of getting things like Eggplant and Cauliflower. But it all pairs so well together, and everything is very good. Make sure you are not afraid to go and try things you THINK you won't like here. Because I promise you it will work and you will like it. Also everything is fresh and you can tell everything is quality food. \\n\\nMy go to meal is: Sandwich with Hummus, Crispy onions, half Brisket/Glazed Bacon, Pickled Cabbage, Extra Special Sauce, Eggplant, Cauliflower, Carrot. Then I always have to add on the Brassica Fries (Which are seasoned perfectly) w/special sauce, and a Mint Pink lemonade. You have to try that lemonade by the way. It's so refreshing. But let me let you in on a TIP that nobody is doing, that everyone should be..... Put some fries into your sandwich, it's so good. I've yet to see anyone else do this. But my goal is to have everyone doing this by years end lol. \\n\\nFirst impression when i walk in, is that this location is a lot more open and brighter. It is still very aesthetically pleasing. There is more room to move about the seating area, and the windows all around allow more natural light to enter the building. Everything looks high nice and gives you that feel that this inst just some rush job to get another location up, They wanted to give it that same high quality experience, that you get with eating their food. \\n\\nThe customer service was really good. Like the location on high, the employees were friendly engaging. This must be something they look for while interviewing because I can see it's a standard that they set for when they hire people. I've never had a bad customer experience ever at the high location, and from the looks of it I won't have one here either. \\n\\nSo im giving this 5 stars. Another great restraint by brassica. I'd recommend this location to anyone. This location is more kid friendly because of where it is at and how open the place is. Bexley was the perfect part of the city for them to expand into. You can't really get much better than Brassica."},{"name":"Pho Basil","address":"177 Massachusetts Ave, Ste A","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"Went here with my two sisters and I WAS HOOKED.

We were in the area looking for a coffee place and happened to stumble across Java Monkey.  The outside of the restaurant is interesting as it is split into two different areas, an outdoor seating area and then the main enclosed area.  Of course I did not realize this at the time and actually thought that the outdoor area was another restaurant and so payed little attention to it.  The inside of the restaurant has all of your normal coffee house type decor like a comfortable area with couches and stuffed chairs and then a bunch of tables and chairs also .  Both the coffee bar and wine bar (pretty cool to have both) are up a couple of stairs which reminded me of the stairs from a split level house.  Whenever we arrived later on a Sunday afternoon I was surprised to see that the place was almost completely filled and my girlfriend and I were happy to take the last table available inside.\\n\\nI decided to get my usual here, an Americano, while my girlfriend went with a green tea.  Whenever my drink came out I was confused about it as it had ice in it.  It was called an Americano though and since it was a fairly warm Spring day outside I just went with the iced version.  It ended up being a fairly bitter and I can't say that I was satisfied with the taste although it did do the job in getting me caffeinated.  My girlfriend had much better luck with her green tea and enjoyed it.\\n\\nThe bottom line for me is that I might come back here in the future.

From the outside, it looks tiny! Once we went in though, House of Tofu Soup was actually incredibly spacious. \\n\\nThe menu here is pretty simple, and it should be since they really only specialize in tofu soup anyways. That said, they also have Korean classics like Bibimbap and Japchae. \\n\\nAfter ordering, the standard Korean appetizer plates arrived! The eggs aren't actually appetizers, they're for the tofu soup. I was a tad disappointed to find that House of Tofu Soup provides little scoops of mashed potatoes instead of the sweet chunk potatoes, but they were quite good too. Seaweed and kimchi kept us all happy. \\n\\nI got a combo ($15.99), and I decided to get one of our favourite dishes to ensure that we leave full. Mamdeukee (or the thing with lots of Korean rice cakes) is one of our favourite Korean dishes of all time. Weirdly enough, House of Tofu Soup serves their rice cakes on top of dumplings!\\n\\nThe dumplings were a welcome surprise, but only when we ate them right away. There was one that we left for a while, and it soaked up all the spicy sauce. Soggy dumplings are sad dumplings.

I wish we had a full stone bowl each!\\n\\nAll of our tofu soups initially looked really boring. I actually put an egg in there already too, but it sank right into the soup!  After mixing it up with a spoon, the magic happens. Deliciously fluffy tofu disintegrates into the soup! Careful with the egg though, it took us a while to cook it properly!\\n\\nThe tofu soup was good, but I did find the price of their food to be on the high end, considering the portion sizes and what actually goes into the dishes (really, the tofu soups are mostly tofu).

I order my food (chicken shawarma and a greek salad) and begin a conversation with Tunisian Drake, who is an incredibly nice and genuine person. If there was one of him at every food service counter in this country, we would be a happier people.

That was the moistest, best tasting gyro meat on this side of the world. I honestly thought it was prime rib sprinkled with magic gyro flavoring for how tender, juicy and all around amazing it was.

It seems to indicate a certain level of indifference as most managers and business owners take time to monitor customer feedback from online reviews, especially one as visible and well-regarded as Yelp. Instead of responding to my specific points, you go on the defense and simply state that the waitress had worked there for 2 years and only received good feedback and denied any knowledge of the incident (lol, of COURSE she did!). She was very pleasant but after I pointed the fruit fly out to her, she never reappeared at our table and after waiting 30 minutes or so, we had to go to the bar to have her summoned from the kitchen for our bill so we  could leave as my friend had to pick up her young son. I never blamed her for the presence of the fruit fly on the lettuce on my fish sandwich nor did I tip her under my usual 20% although I was disappointed she didn't take it off the bill and ignored us after I said something about the fruit fly, mistakenly thinking I would not properly tip her. I do not attribute issues with food prep and handling to wait staff and have had relatives working in the food industry for years and have nothing but respect for their hard work. Your response, Lisa, seems to deflect from my feedback. If you look through my other reviews, I provide very balanced feedback and frequently give 4 and 5 stars to businesses.

For takeout, I would suggest something like the Famous Rumanian Pastrami or another one of the signature sandwich options, since the specialty sandwiches tend to be VERY heavy on the sauce and even a short walk back makes for an extremely soggy sandwich. The grilled sandwiches hold up a bit better as well since the toasted bread is a little sturdier. They slice their meat pretty thin which is sad for those of us who like thick meaty cuts of pastrami. Prices can be a bit steep (~$14 for a sandwich) but portions are gigantic and can be split for two meals if your sandwich doesn't fall apart within an hour. \\n\\nLine can get pretty long during the lunch rush, but I've found that they're pretty empty after 1pm if you are inclined to wait that long.

Apparently, the owners of Taipei Cuisine (up the road in North Quincy) opened this ramen/Japanese restaurant and some of their employees are here now. Upon seeing the Chinese-style grand opening flowers up front...what did you expect from Quincy?\\n\\nThe name of the restaurant is rather misleading. True, there are some ramen options here, but the swath of sushi choices makes you wonder if they care more about sushi than ramen. It's almost as if they pull you in for ramen, since there's a dearth of ramen in the area, but hit you with numerous of sushi options. \\n\\nI went for the regular ramen and received a nominal portion. I'm not a fan of Hakata-style, but the noodles were decent. It just tastes too much like angel hair and it can easily get mushy in a broth. Speaking of which, the bland broth was a bit below average. The pork, which pretty plentiful, was just passable in flavor.\\n\\nThe second time I visited, I went for one the lunch combo of pork cutlet curry on rice and a regular ramen. The pork was a bit small but it was fairly tasty. The bowl of rice is pretty sizable, though there's not much curry. The ramen was disappointing. There were only traces of pork and far less than what I received my first visit. In the soup, there was Chinese pickled mustard greens, which shouldn't have surprised me. And no, we're not talking about tsukemono, but actual Chinese pickled mustard.\\n\\nPrices aren't all that impressive, with a ramen lunch combo being around $13.

The atmosphere is great and service is pretty attentive. \\n\\nCame on Tuesday, 3rd January 2012 with 2 friends and we ordered the following:\\n\\nCalamarrs Fritos ($4 on tapas Tuesdays) - These were not bad. Totally worth the $4. \\n\\nPiquillos Rellenos ($4 on tapas Tuesdays, Roasted red peppers stuffed with ground veal and mild chorizo sausage, served with light sherry sauce) - My friends had mixed reactions to these.  I liked it, however.  \\n\\nAlbondigas ($4 on tapas Tuesdays, veal, chorizo and pork meatballs in piquant tomato sauce) - I'd order this again; however, the dish didn't come out very hot. \\n\\nCroquet as de Pollo ($4 on tapas Tuesdays, hickey and Serrano ham folded into bechamel and deep fried) This totally wasn't what I expected.  It was lacking in flavour and tasted off. I probably wouldn't order this again. \\n\\nTortilla Espa√±ola ($5.95 potato and onion omelette) - This didn't have enough potato and too much egg.  It was more of a fritatta than a tortilla espanola... I wouldn't order this again.  \\n\\nCordoniz de grilladore ($10.95m Marinaded and grilled quail served over saut√©ed spinach, dressed with honey, garlic and figs) - My friends and I didn't care for the quail; however, the spinach was the highlight of the evening.  We wished they had a full dish (or salad) that was just the spinach....\\n\\nCostullas de Vaca ($18.95 beef short ribs with Rioja wine, oven roasted tomato and elephant garlic, served with potatoes) - The beef short ribs were not very tender.  I had expected this dish to be braised, which it was not.... totally missed the mark with this dish. Would not order it again. \\n\\nPato a la Parilla ($12.95, grilled duck breast over a chocolate port sauce) - The duck portion was very small, and the flavour was off... it didn't taste anything like duck. We were most disappointed by this dish. \\n\\nAlmendrado ($7.95, crisp, warm almond pastry served with vanilla ice cream) - This was just an almond croissant warmed up with ice cream on the side.  I seriously doubt this was made in-house. \\n\\nPudin de Pan ($7.95, bread pudding with Spanish brandy, served with ice cream and white chocolate sauce) - We actually enjoyed the bread pudding.  The portion was huge, and we couldn't finish it all.\\n\\nOverall, Ceviche is A-OK.  Our server was absolutely wonderful, and the atmosphere is quite good.  I'd come back, but would only order tapas and the ceviche (which we didn't order this time around). \\n\\nAlong with 3 hot teas ($4.50/each), our bill came to $94.20 + 6.13 tax + 20.00 tip = $120.33 for our table of 3."},{"name":"Life Alive","address":"765 Mass Ave","city":"Cambridge","stars":"4.5","text":"OMG I love this place!

It is, in fact, just a great oyster bar/seafood restaurant with dim lights and an environment that is perfect for a couple or a group of 5 couples. The prices on food was not all too ridiculous, but remember Boston is a magnet city for tourists so it's okay for places like Island Creek to mark up their foods and be just as competitive as their neighbor. \\n\\nWhat you might find steep are the prices for the oysters and raw bar (especially when you're from the South and you can get a dozen mud oysters for $6), BUT I would give anything to have East Coast oysters transported into Houston's oyster bars. My boyfriend and I shared a dozen oysters (6 different kinds) and it was SO WORTH IT. As a foodie, I clearly live to eat so I can definitely taste the difference in each and every oyster I tried.... let me just rephrase: OYSTERS DO NOT TASTE THE SAME!\\n\\nOYSTER BAR\\n* Well Fleet - Medium in size, these oysters were just too sweet for me.\\n* Moon Shoal - With a smooth coppery finish, this oyster worked its way up to my top 3 favorite of the bunch. I thought these oysters were much larger than others, so maybe a little more bang for your bucks here.\\n* Spring Creek - These oysters are classified as \\"salty,\\" however I didn't taste it. In fact, I thought it was sweeter than expected but the overall taste of the vegetable finish was on point.\\n* Sunken Meadow - Wayyyyyy too salty.\\n* Moonstone - Similar to the Moon Shoal, this oyster has a coppery finish but also a sweet one, as well. It made for another great oyster!\\n* East Beach - The favorite of the entire bunch at Island Creek. It was smooth, fat, and just the right amount of sweetness and saltiness to it.\\n\\nFOOD\\n* Oyster Slider - If I didn't know it was an oyster slider, I would just think I was eating brioche with an awesome sauce. As much as I want to love this appetizer, I was a bit let down... I mean, WHERE WAS THE OYSTER?! Overall, the slider did not fall too short of expectations. It was hot, sweet, and savory with one hell of a bomb sauce.\\n* Lobster Roe Noodles - Here's a dish that truly did not live up to its expectations or hype in the least bit. I felt it was no where near worth the $32 it was priced at. When I hear the name \\"Lobster Roe Noodles,\\" I'm gonna think Lobster. Roe. Noodles. What I got was noodles and braised short ribs. This dish should have been named Braised Short Rib Noodles because there was no roe and minimal lobster. Given, the braised short ribs were delicious and melted in your mouth with its tenderness and flavor, but why highlight a seafood that you're gonna barely use in the dish? Overall, a decent choice but not worth $32 or the name.\\n* Sesame Chili Green Beans - We needed some greens in our systems and were lucky to find this side dish. It came out quick and hot! Covered in a nice chili powder while sitting in some hot sesame sauce, the green beans were crunchy and a nice touch to a day full of heavy foods.\\n\\nSERVICE\\nI expected good service, but our waiter was better than expected for a night extremely busy. He was nice and super helpful when it came to ordering oysters. He recommended 5 really good oysters with just 1 that didn't turn out so hot. He was quick to respond and it honestly didn't hurt that he was easy on the eyes (oops hehe). When the bill came out, he gave us a \\"little treat from the kitchen,\\" which turned out to be a peach sorbet.

I had no idea the size, and scale of this place. \\nIt is quite impressive. \\nIf you are visiting Portland this is a must do. Take a few hours and grab a cup of coffee  ( thy have that too !) their selection is overwhelmingly delicious !\\n\\nI don't know how they do it - but keep doing what you do ! Because it really is awesome."},{"name":"Oath Pizza - Coolidge Corner","address":"276 Harvard St","city":"Brookline","stars":"3.5","text":"Although this place is adorable & has tasty pizza, there is no reason for it to cost so much. Like seriously, I can't believe how much it is, it's pizza for cripes sake. You want fancy pizza, then come here & spend more than it's worth. The people working there are friendly & attentive."},{"name":"Habibi Lebanese Semoran","address":"6651 S Semoran Blvd, Ste 108","city":"Orlando","stars":"3.5","text":"It's always good to give things a second try. Came here about a year ago and was very disappointed. So when the fianc√© recommended we try again I was hesitant. So glad we came back I love Mediterranean food and they did not let me down this time. friendly service not very busy. Everything is fresh and clean. Had the Beef and chicken Shwarma mix Sanwich. We will be back!"},{"name":"Deacon's Corner","address":"101 Main Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"3.5","text":"I love greasy spoons.  I love diners.  I love breakfast.  I really wanted to love Deacon's for so many reasons (mainly because it's so close to home)... But it failed miserably in every way.  \\n\\nThere were about 6 of us, and all had different things (egg breakfast, salad, sandwich, burger, chicken fried steak, pancakes etc.). Everything was at best mediocre going down to inedible.  Pancakes taste like pork, even if you get them solo (not so good for vegetarians), steak was like leather & way overpriced (as is most of the food), salad was pathetic.  Even the coffee was barely passable.\\n\\nNot to mention we waited too long to get seated when it was not that busy, and the\\nwaitress had no clue that the chicken fried steak was actually steak & not chicken.  Service was indifferent & unapologetic about mishaps.  Really left us wishing we had kept our money & stayed home & fried up a few eggs.\\n\\nNo second chance for this place - and I always give second chances.\\n\\n*This is a long overdue review from several months ago*"},{"name":"Din Ho Chinese BBQ","address":"8557 Research Blvd, Ste 116","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"We really enjoy Chinese cuisine and without a doubt Din Ho is one of the best we have found in Austin."}]`),R={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:z},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:6,poemsData:O,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.poemsData.filter(n=>{const e=this.searchQuery.toLowerCase();return n.name.toLowerCase().includes(e)||n.city.toLowerCase().includes(e)||n.text.toLowerCase().includes(e)}).slice(0,this.visibleCount):this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(n=>setTimeout(n,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},E={class:"search-container"},D={class:"card-container"},j=["disabled"],N={key:0},G={key:1};function L(n,e,s,f,i,r){const c=p("PoemCard");return a(),o("section",null,[e[3]||(e[3]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"üéâ Restaurant Reviews ü•≥")])],-1)),t("div",E,[e[2]||(e[2]=t("span",{class:"search-icon"},"üîç",-1)),b(t("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=h=>i.searchQuery=h),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[v,i.searchQuery]])]),t("div",D,[(a(!0),o(y,null,m(r.filteredPoems,(h,g)=>(a(),k(c,{key:g,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),r.hasMorePoems?(a(),o("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:i.isLoading,onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=(...h)=>r.loadMore&&r.loadMore(...h))},[i.isLoading?(a(),o("span",G,"Loading...")):(a(),o("span",N,"See more"))],8,j)):w("",!0)])}const H=u(R,[["render",L],["__scopeId","data-v-b61326fb"]]),K=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"glossary/6.md","filePath":"glossary/6.md"}'),F={name:"glossary/6.md"},Y=Object.assign(F,{setup(n){return(e,s)=>(a(),o("div",null,[I(H)]))}});export{K as __pageData,Y as default};
