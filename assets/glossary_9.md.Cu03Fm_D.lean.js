I can't eat cucumber or avocado, so I don't really do rolls and can not vouch. I defer to my husband, who fell in love with their inventive, but not too crazy creative rolls. He really loved the mango/tuna/avacodo roll, as well as their unagi roll. I loved all the nigiri I sampled, including a wonderful snapper and what I'm rather sure was real flippin' kani (crab). The ebi (shrimp) was wonderful and their tuna was very par for the course. The wasabi was excellent, as was the ginger, and I love my ginger, so I've become a bit picky.\\n\\nI didn't go too crazy at the robata grill, as they mostly had skewers out and I was so enamored with other sections.

The sweet corn crab cakes were PERFECT, I tell you, PERFECT. I could have eaten those for the whole meal and been happy. There was also a wonderful whitefish that was cooked just right.\\n\\nDessert station was okay. I highly recommend the pineapple cookies and the mixed cake rolls.

I'll start off with the cons (since there were not very many).  It is very hard to get a reservation at Island Creek, especially on a game night.  It took going on a Monday to get in at a reasonable time (9pm), so if you want to go, I would recommend planning way ahead, or strategically scheduling dinner there on a non-game and non-weekend evening.\\n\\nOnto the good stuff.  Our table was just being set when we arrived at 9.  Often times, when going to popular restaurants, I have still had to wait for a while to be seated, even if I have a reservation.  Our waitress was great, she offered her opinion when asked, and made some terrific recommendations.\\n\\nThe food: We started off with the smoked trout, two types of raw oysters and the oyster sliders.  While the trout and raw oysters were both tasty, the oyster sliders were out of this world.  They came lightly fried with a spicy sauce on a buttery bun.  If we hadn't ordered just one per person, I probably could have eaten the entire plate of them.  For entrees, everybody was pleased with what they ordered, but I think the standouts were the Seafood casserole, and the Lobster Roe noodles with short rib.

We waited until our 8 year old daughter had a weekday off of school knowing the wait on the weekends was at least an hour or more. So we were a little surprised when we walked in on a weekday morning and the wait was 45 minutes to an hour. By the time we got seated we had two very hungry girls (my daughter and her friend) ready to eat. At first, our male waiter was nice enough, explaining to us how to use the grill. I am strictly gluten-free so I ordered the gluten-free batter for myself, while the girls and my husband ordered a chocolate batter and peanut butter batter. We decided that we would cook all of my gluten-free pancakes on the grill first, not to cross contaminate with the other batter. Unfortunately, this ended up to be a gooey, pile of batter mess! We specifically cooked the pancakes in the middle of the grill as we were told and we even turned up the griddle hotter so the pancakes would cook better. No matter what we did, it was just a big mess! I finally had to track down our waiter to come over to scrape our grill and start all over again. He seemed very annoyed with us that we could not get it right the first time, but he even stated (AFTER the fact) that the gluten-free batter was trickier to cook with than the other batters. I finally decided to have the cooks make my gluten free pancakes in the back so the hungry girls could get their pancakes on the griddle faster. Unfortunately, the annoyed waiter did not scrape our griddle very well and the regular batter quickly started sticking to the grill. No matter what we did (adding lots more butter to the grill/more oil), most of the pancakes ended up sticking to the griddle and becoming a big mess! The girls were good sports and quickly realized they would not be able to do any of the flipping of the pancakes because they were sticking so badly. We thought this would be part of the fun for them to do the flipping, but that did not happen. At the end, the girls were actually cheering when we could flip a pancake that didn't look like a big pile of batter. We did get a few decent pancakes out of the whole experience, but not enough to make it worth it. In general, the waiter seemed very annoyed with us the whole time even though I tried very nicely to explain what was wrong and to get his help. \\"Snarky\\" would be a very appropriate word to describe our waiter for this whole experience. There were two positives to our experience at Slappy cakes: one was that my gluten-free pancakes from the back came out huge, beautiful and very yummy! If we were to ever return, I would definitely order my gluten-free pancakes from the back and not even bother with putting them on the griddle. The second positive of our experience was that our waiter did take off the bill some of the fillings and my gluten-free batter that did not work. Of course, I would expect for them to take these off the bill since we did not eat them anyway, but I was happy that I did not have to argue this with the waiter. All in all, the girls left full and happy, but my husband and I left a little frustrated and exhausted with the whole experience."},{"name":"Kevin Rathbun Steak","address":"154 Krog St","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Never disappoints.

I have been going to New Brothers since the week they opened in Danvers. Before they moved to Danvers, I was always in their Peabody restaurant. They were always excellent. This night, I ordered three different items and two of the three were a disaster. \\n\\nOh boy, was I craving a nice toasted Rueben sandwich. I asked for the corned beef Rueben sliced nice and thin (they also have a turkey Rueben) with extra dressing on the side (I was willing to pay for the dressing - not a problem). What a disaster when I got it home. As I took a bite, I realized that something did not taste right. Plenty of corned beef, Swiss cheese (I think), some dressing (Russian or Thousand Island), but now for the setback... instead of putting the sauerkraut on it, they used coleslaw. I took the sandwich apart to check it out and sure enough, there were the carrots and the coleslaw. YUCK. If they ran out of the slaw, I wish they were honest and told me so I could of changed to another sandwich. I don't like being deceived like that. I am shocked that this restaurant pulled something like this because they have always been decent. It ended up in the trash. They NEVER put the extra salad dressing in the order, either.\\n\\nWell another friend of mine wanted some nice Greek lemon soup..... a large (not the quart size) with some soup crackers. Anyway, she opens it and it was beef stew. Ugh. I wondered why no soup crackers in the bag, but I let it go... instead they packed in a pita. She likes their beef stew but that is not what was ordered. If they ran out of it, they should of told me when I picked the order up and maybe the soup could of been substituted with something else. Usually you get about 6 pieces of beef in their stew and there were only three. Another dissapointment. She wouldn't eat it because that is NOT what she wanted. \\n\\nA third friend wanted the stuffed cabbage roll dinner. He said it was good. I had to ask for the dark rye on the side twice. As I was walking out, there was no rye bread so I had to come back and ask a third time. \\n\\nIt was extremely hot in there. I saw a bag placed on the counter near the cashier. I thought it was for another patron as there were other people coming in and picking up their take-outs. I had already paid for the meal and took a seat near the register. It sat there and sat there and the cashier looked at it several times. Then she decided to sit down and grab a bite to eat... as the bag was still left on the counter getting cold. I timed it and the bag sat there for almost TWENTY-FIVE MINUTES. When I found out it was the order I placed, I was not happy. \\n\\nThis turned out to be a $30.00 waste. The guy with the cabbage roll dinner did not want to eat with the two women (my guest and myself) sitting there with nothing to eat. So, we gals ended up ordering a pizza and garden salad and having it delivered. \\n\\nKary has always been so nice and he was there when I went in. There were several patrons in the dining room but NOT in line. Not sure how my order was screwed up so badly but I am shocked to say the least that this happened. I feel guilty for even writing this but I am sure they knew that the order I went home with was NOT what I ordered and I live outside of Danvers and was NOT going back to exchange it in the severe heat wave we were having."},{"name":"Slappy Cakes","address":"4246 SE Belmont St","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"For two weeks my poor husband had to listen to me whine about craving pancakes!

We just stuck with the buttermilk batter for this trip and chose chocolate chips, blueberries and lemon curd for our toppings.

We were greeted as soon as we arrived and picked a high top towards the front of the restaurant.   Samantha was our server and she was awesome! She was very conversational, friendly, and did a wonderful job overall. Our glasses were always full and she made sure to always check on us while we were waiting. \\n\\nThey offer some really cool and unique menu items that you are more likely to find in big cities. Although their sushi donut and sushi burger are on my \\"must try\\" list, I went first with the crab bao and the pork belly bao. They were recommended by another foodie and were both excellent. The crab bao included crab salad and was served with a side of melted butter It was definitely worth the price, as it was filled to the top of the fried bun. I drizzled a little on top and was in heaven after the first bite. The flavors were incredible and unique. It was truly one of the best things I have had in a while. The pork belly bao was equally as good. A good sized pork belly that was cooked perfectly and flavored well. Next, I had to go with the bulgogi cheesecake. It sounds really different, but believe it or not, the sweet bulgogi paired well with onions, peppers, and provolone cheese on a soft baguette. It was amazing and there was plenty left to eat later. Lastly, their volcano roll. The presentation was beautiful and it was a great roll. The fish tasted fresh and it was a very good version of a volcano roll.\\n\\nOverall, my friend and I were very please and are already talking about making the drive back. This time I think I am going to try the sushi burger. A couple seated by us ordered one to share and it looked incredible! Make the drive, it's so worth it!!!\\n\\nTip:\\nThere is a parking lot in front with a few spots dedicated to Wave."},{"name":"Don Asado","address":"18385 SW Alexander St","city":"Aloha","stars":"4.5","text":"Great food.

I like the decor and overall feel. We arrived around 3:30 and wanted to sit outside but at this time the only outdoor seating was bar service. So we found a table and went to the bar for menus. We were given lunch menus and drink menus and returned to the bar to place our orders. One of my friends ordered her meal as I waited next to her. Another bartender approached me and asked for my order. I ordered the equinox farm greens salad with no cheese (I have an allergy) and turkey on top(extra $). The bartender told me lunch was no long available (it was 4:00pm on the dot) and I would have to order from the snack menu. Dinner would be available at 5:00pm. I was confused and asked if it would be possible to get lunch (since my friend who was ordering at the same time as me was getting a lunch menu option). The bartender said he would check and later returned to tell me they would do it. I was grateful for the \\"extra effort\\" the bartender put in for me but was slightly disappointed when my salad did not have squash on it as described on the menu. The turkey was cold cut turkey. It was good but there really wasn't much going on for a $13.00 + salad. The mixed drinks had good reviews but for 11.00 each they were pre made and served in small plastic cups (I realize this is for safety but I've never been a fan).

These were such robust sections before, and they've been decreasing in size the last few years. It's sad. I'm sure that it's an economic thing, and if more people bought that stuff, they'd have more. It's just that these were a few things I couldn't get elsewhere, and they were part of what makes Powell's special. What makes it so different from other bookstores. It was like a collision, a huge store with a great selection, but it still had that grimy feeling of the bookstore where the only employee is the old man crank who sits on a stool all day. I liked the mix. It's not for everyone, but I liked it. Probably because I'm slowly (okay, rapidly) turning into that crank, and I'll need a job sooner or later.\\n\\nI love you Powell's.

Why are my attempts at finding the perfect local deli to satisfy my turkey sandwich cravings constantly foiled by the blandness and spotty service of places like Spinelli's? Must I continue aborting these plans in lieu of trips to Giant Eagle for supplies to do it myself?\\n\\nConsider this review a desperate cry for help. With the exception of Katzinger's, which is the subject of an entirely different review for another day, I have yet to find that can even outdo Spinelli's at their own game, hence the two stars as opposed to just one. Don't get me wrong here- the items on the menu here are edible and at times remotely satisfying, but this place is otherwise marred by circumstance that is seemingly never going to be fixed.\\n\\nThe most obvious one is the service. The general idea behind a deli is that it's a relatively quick place for one to drop by on their lunch break in order for a quick sandwich and a coffee. Apparently the people running the show here never got the memo. It's unclear as to who's job is what behind the counter, and it's not uncommon to see one person running the register, slicing bread, and preparing sandwiches all at the same time while the other person stands idly by the grill doing not much else. \\n\\nThe Ruben is the true test of any self-respecting deli's clout, and Spinelli's failed miserably. I'm sure there was a dollop of thousand island dressing hiding somewhere under all that sauerkraut, but you sure could've fooled me. Upon my next visit, I set my sights lower and ordered a lowly turkey sandwich. After waiting a good fifteen minutes for the thing, I started to think that it may have been a better idea to go next door to Giant Eagle and do it myself. After finally picking up my food at the counter, I proved myself right. It's not that it was terrible- in most regards a turkey sandwich is a turkey sandwich, and this was no exception. It just didn't make sense to me to wait fifteen minutes for such a mediocre creation when I can purchase the goods to do a better job myself for about half the price. \\n\\nThe only bright spot at Spinelli's is the bagel selection. On both occasions that I've stopped in for a quick (a term to be used lightly, obviously) morning snack, the simple bagel with cream cheese option has never let me do. I was staring at my watch the whole time it was being prepared for me, but at least the bagel was fresh and chewy. \\n\\nThe verdict: if you've searched high and low for a more economical alternative to the pricier fare at Katzinger's, keep looking. And while you're at it, please let me know what you come across, as I'm on the verge of giving up."},{"name":"Mango Mango Dessert Atlanta","address":"5177-A Buford Hwy NE","city":"Doraville","stars":"4","text":"The mango desserts were good and the atmosphere was hype!!!

However upon entering Life Alive I felt...confused. The line of patrons nearly reached the door and I felt disoriented, like I was standing in a San Francisco-Amsterdam love child on shrooms, when logically I knew I was in the middle of Central Square. But when a place is that committed to their aesthetic though, there really isn't anything but to surrender and go along for the ride, even if it did mean trying to suppress the judgment of a storefront sign and menu written entirely in Papyrus font (who uses Papyrus?!) \\n\\nThese disclaimers about the ambiance are mostly in jest though as the food more than made up for our amusement. I had ordered \\"The Goddess\\" bowl with an additional side of squash, garlic, and avocado, which consisted of a mix of carrots, beets, broccoli, dark greens, and tofu over short-grain brown rice with their Ginger Nama Shoyu Sauce drizzled over it. My friend had gotten \\"The Miso Masterful\\" with additional garlic - udon noodles in a dark barley miso broth with toasted sesame, broccoli, carrots, seaweed, and shitake mushrooms. Both of these entrees were superb - all of the produce was crisp and delicious and both the Ginger Nama Shoyu Sauce and the miso broth were incredibly flavorful. The additional money spent for the squash, avocado, and garlic add-ins was also well worth it as both provided a creamier contrast to the crunch of the rest of the meal. And while my rice could have been served warmer, the udon noodles were pleasantly well cooked and a great choice for the grey February day. \\n\\nThe only less enjoyable portion of the meal was both of our juice selections proved mildly disappointing. My friend's \\"Simply Alive\\" juice (lemon, spirulina, honey, and water) was definitely an acquired taste, which reportedly got better however it reminded me too strongly of traditional Chinese medicines to fully enjoy. Similarly, my \\"Thrive Alive\\" juice (a combination of carrot, apple, and ginger) was fairly overpowering on the ginger and while searching for ways to adjust the taste I was once again completely perplexed as I stared at the jar of powdered nutritional yeast and a squeeze bottle filled with a mysterious orange liquid that was only labeled as \\"Dancing Passion (Vegan)\\". \\n\\nOverall despite my quips regarding their atmosphere, Life Alive is a definite new favorite lunchtime spot. While sitting in the cozy, mismatched furniture of their downstairs area, it was near impossible for my grumpy carnivorous self to not be grudgingly charmed by how the waiter nearly sang out the ridiculous meal names and by the quality of their food.

I think the experience is especially good for kids because of the fiery \\"wow\\" factor, but it's even fun for adults if you get a decent chef and there's enough alcohol flowing.\\n\\nThe hibachi is acceptable here.  It's not original, or even authentic, but I'll never be disappointed with grilled meat and veggies over steamed rice.  Add a cold beer to the mix and I'll always be satisfied.\\n\\nI don't recommend the sushi, unless you want something fried, and there are plenty of rolls to choose from that should suit your fancy.  The sushi rolls are the one exception to an otherwise overpriced menu, most of which are just $8.95.  If you are a true sushi aficionado, you will be disappointed at Kiku, so it's probably best to just avoid the nigiri altogether.\\n\\nThere are plenty of beverage choices at Kiku, but I recommend skipping the sugary specialty cocktails (unless that's your thing) and grabbing a beer instead.  They've got the typical Japanese offerings .. Kirin, Asahi, Sapporo .. along with domestic and other imported beers available.\\n\\nGenerally speaking, at least for the hibachi meals, Kiku is overpriced.  My chicken and steak combo, which came with a really watered down soup, a very boring salad, decently prepared meat and veggies with a bowl of steamed rice was $17.95.  I had enough to take home for lunch the next day, but it's just not worth the price.\\n\\nIn a nutshell, I look at Kiku as an event place.  It's fun for a group ... holiday dinner, out of town guests, or a birthday party for kids.  I've been to Kiku about 5 times over the years, and I've always had decent service.  I know what to expect here and I know what to avoid so that I won't be disappointed."},{"name":"Baraka Cafe","address":"812 Memorial Dr","city":"Cambridge","stars":"4","text":"It could have been a 5/5 but our server (which I believe he was the owner) made me drop a star and it's cash only!\\n\\nFOOD was Delicious!!!!

From the comfortable and welcoming yet energetic, swanky interior, to the (almost) seamless service, to the freshest, most delicious oysters and seafood, Island Creek and Executive Chef Jeremy Sewall can do no wrong. In fact, pretty much the only thing I dislike about Island Creek is how impossible it is to get a dinner reservation between 7 and 10 pm anything less than three weeks in advance. \\n\\nWe had our first meal at ICOB last winter and have been going back once every couple of months ever since. The Lobster Roll is AMAZING and definitely gets my vote for best in the city. I'd never been much of a fan of raw oysters before coming here, but their namesake, the Island Creek Oysters, made me an official convert. This variety is omnipresent on their menu and always worth getting at least a couple of, but the rotating cast of other East and West coast oysters usually contains a few other gems, too. My personal favorites are the Kumomoto and Kushi.\\n\\nThe very fully stocked bar consistently turns out creative drinks--many are a success, but the occasional dud does lurk in their extensive cocktail list. Ask for suggestions based on what you like instead of just ordering blindly. On one visit a mixed drink came out tasting uncannily like a shot of whiskey, but our server quickly noticed that we weren't loving the drink and replaced it with another one more to our liking. Save for one lackluster experience with a less-than-pleasant, but still accurate, server, this attention to detail and graciousness is ubiquitous in the restaurant and one of the main reasons we keep coming back. On our first visit we were treated to complementary after-dinner drinks, and when we returned for my birthday, a delicious slice of cake. These little extras go a long way in making guests feel special, and certainly cultivate that warm, fuzzy feeling that keeps us coming back again and again.\\n\\nThe oysters, lobster roll, burger (topped with a fried oyster!), and crab cakes are great and motivation enough to brave the Red Sox crowds at Kenmore, but the ambiance and service are what really helps Island Creek Oyster Bar stand out in the Boston restaurant scene."},{"name":"Thai Wok Kitchen","address":"5000 E 4th Plain Blvd, Ste A101","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4.5","text":"So happy with this new place.

Knowing that this restaurant has been featured on Guy Fieries Triple D show, you would think that the owners would make sure they came up with a better ordering system. Why does this place have counter service when they have expanded their restaurant to accommodate a full service dining mentality? You can't expect to be efficient when you STILL want guest to order at the counter and then find a seat. It would make the experience SO MUCH BETTER if they would have servers assigned to sections and have guest sit down with a menu instead of forming a long line at the counter. The saving grace for our visit was our server Nick who was EXCEPTIONAL! He was kind, patient, funny and you can tell he truly cares about each guest.

Additionally, while the brisket on my first visit was well marbled, smoky, juicy, and perfectly seasoned, this visit found brisket that was obviously pre-sliced and shriveled and dry from sitting in a steamer tray too long.

I arrived at the restaurant excited and ready to write a 4 or 5 star review. However, as much as I tried and tried to make myself like the place, I really can't call it more than \\"ok\\". \\n\\nWhen we arrived, there was an hour wait for two people at lunch. We were informed that we could order to go and eat our food at the picnic tables across the street along with the people eating from the food carts in that area. We decided that this was the best option, as our time in the area was limited. I decided to try the \\"Kai Yaang\\", since the menu listed this as the restaurant's \\"signature dish\\". My husband had a grilled sausage dish. \\n\\nThe time we waited for the to go orders was reasonable, although we were a little confused by the multitude of empty tables we saw in the restaurant's outdoor dining area given the one hour wait time. When we got our food, it had some nice flavors, but portions were definitely small. While the food definitely wasn't bad, neither dish was particularly memorable, nor would we return to have them again.\\n\\nOverall, I don't personally think Pok Pok is worth a one-hour wait, but of course since I've only tried two of their dishes, I would say it could be worth a try if you have your heart set on going.

For the restaurant, it's really the best bang for their buck.  The popcorn was topped with what looked like paprika, but it mostly just tasted like regular popcorn.  Can't complain though, it's a pretty unique concept.\\n\\nThe \\"Corndog\\" Shrimp has its pros and cons.  If you're thinking Shrimp tempura, you'd be wrong.  The batter is thinner, so the flavors of the shrimp is in the spotlight.  The batter isn't as crispy, but tasted good.  The shrimp could use a bit more seasoning as it was bland for my taste.  However, we both agreed that we would definitely get these again.\\n\\nThe trout was a big disappointment for me.  This dish consists of two filets topped with the cornbread stuffing.  The fish wasn't overcooked, but still far from the best I've had.  The cornbread stuffing was salty and together with the flavors from the trout, it just didn't have the quality taste that I expect from a $23 dish.\\n\\nThe Chicken & Waffle, on the other hand, was simply high class.  The best chicken and waffle that we've had, and most of the credit goes to the waffle.  Made from corn meal, it was crispy while having a soft, flavorful, and addicting filling.  Quantity was excellent as well: a huge waffle with four chicken strips.  If you have trouble deciding what to get, stick with the classics.  And when it comes to Chicken & Waffle, they do it very well.\\n\\nService was excellent!  Despite having smaller water glasses, we never ran out.

The seating was good, I'll give it that, but just look behind the sushi bar (or all around for that matter). There's junk all over; a small shelf has the remains of a paper roll, a sloppy can of pencils, paper with hand written notes, a jar of spice that doesn't have a home, a happy kitty, and one of these huge paper lanterns that's just taking up needed space. Then there are the piles and piles of plates. Did any planning go into decent storage? There's even a tacky calendar hung on the wall. Take a look at the cold storage for the fish. Hm, hm, hm. Not good. \\nNow, if the look of a place doesn't bother you, then by all means, try it out. But don't expect much from the food. The albacore was warmish (I like my sushi cold, don't you?) and the choices were few. Too bad.

They have always had every book I have ever been looking for, and lots of other awesome finds. They have decent prices, and rockin' nik-nacs. But when ever someone suggests making a stop at Powell's, I must let out a big grown of 'pleeeease not now.' Actually finding your books takes some times hours of back and fourths, and 'oh wait, maybe it was over here' 's. It is often very un organized, and is near impossible to find any help. I found myself running, literally running, after this person, dodging through the mass crowds of people, sliding behind people between the narrow isles, and jumping hurdles over the children laying in the middle of the floor. And she magically disappeared. As they some how always do. Not to mention the fact that there are about 4 benches in the entire establishment, which of course are always taken by the same people for hours. As well as the jungle of a cafe that seems to radiate hipster rays. And last but not least, the bathroom. Holly hell and God all mighty, save the souls of which are unfortunate enough to have to use the bathroom while trapped in this madness. There was poop on the floor. Poop. Toilet paper not just covering the floor, but the WALLS. Gives me nightmares of the things I've seen in that bathroom.\\nThe moral of the story is, if you would like a wide selection of books as far as the eye can see, dazzling nik-nacs, along with an awesome leg and buns work out from all the standing, stair climbing, and sprinting after the librarians, and want to face your OCD and germaphobia, then Powell's is the place to be."},{"name":"Reunion Caf√©","address":"7900 Lake Wilson Rd","city":"Davenport","stars":"3.5","text":"Stopped here with my wife on the way down to Florida, Meh was just about right for the review... staff were friendly enough, the food appeared to be reheated and lacked any real flavor...\\n\\nThe bathroom was awful, had to hold my breath while in there...\\n\\nI believe there is better out there, I'd say pass on this place!"},{"name":"Casa Alvarez","address":"3161 Walnut St","city":"Boulder","stars":"3","text":"I used to hate Mexican food, now it's one of my favorites! Simple ingredients with tons of flavor if done right. Unfortunately Casa Alvarez has a lot to learn as do most Mexican restaurants. As always free chips and salsa are a bonus which they do offer! My most recent experience last week will be my last as I've given this restaurant too many chances. My usual favorite at any Mexican restaurant is a beef burrito or beef burrito supreme. In the past which was only a couple weeks ago, my burrito came cold as it usually does. This signifies to me that they make up the burrito with cold ingredients, then place the plate in the oven for a few moments then come to your table and say \\"be careful, the plate is VERY HOT!\\" They forget to tell you, \\"but the food is cold\\". I do not believe this was one of those instances where someone just messed up. I believe this is lack of caring for what their customers receive as I get this repeatedly from this establishment. This past week I decided to give them one last chance, I order a beef chimichanga. How can you go wrong with a chimichanga??? It's fried right, so it couldn't possibly come out cold? WRONG! IT WAS COLD and not fried I might add. They skimped on my entree 100%. Not fried and cold = not good. I also got it smothered in green chile which was also cold... the worst.

I appreciated the selection of tea and packets of cookies with the in-room coffee maker.  The pillows were very comfortable and didn't flatten out immediately like some hotels.  The shower was a tad small and I had to adjust the shower head before and after to prevent water from going outside and all over the floor when turning it on.  The shower ceiling also seemed to get darker like there was water seeping into the sheet rock.  I was tempted to call maintenance because it really looked like a water leak at first but then seemed to dry out like normal. \\n\\nThe breezeway that connects the JW and the Ritz was not in service during my stay so they had us walking in the staff hallway areas to get between the two.

My big complaint is when I checked out, I asked for a receipt to submit to my employer and was told my stay was comped for being bumped.  I asked to confirm and the employee went to back to check with her manager and confirmed no charge.  Then I return to work and explain I have no receipt and the stay was comped only to be told the next day that a bill was sent to our travel coordinator.   The mix up was incredibly annoying and time was wasted trying to figure out where the miscommunication was and if payment was necessary.

A group of friends went here to watch the UFC fight and there were no seats as expected, so we were just standing around the bar watching the game with the buzzer for a table.  The hostess told us that the kitchen was closing soon and that we're unlikely to get a table and that we're free to grab a table after 11:30 pm if we see an empty one and we returned the buzzer. Everything was fine till then. We quickly found an empty table and grabbed it as the hostess has told us to.  We sat and there were a few empty glasses and $20 left, so we logically thought the previous group left and left a tip. The server rolls up and says \\"you can't sit here,\\" so we said, \\"the hostess told us we could, can't we?\\" in a very polite tone cause we were mainly confused, and then she replied that there are still people sitting at the table. Hm really, so we said, \\"I think they're gone cause they left the money.\\" So she quickly grabs the $20 without a word or acknowledgement or apology for getting things mixed up, but that's alright. \\n\\nIn about 10 min, this big guy - who seemed to be the server's supervisor- comes to our table while we're watching the game, that we paid the cover for - and says \\"you guys need to call it a night.\\" Really confused, we asked why. So shockingly, he says that his server told him that we /THREW/ money at her when she was trying to clean the table and that we told her off to make her go away.  What?? As confused as we were, we tried to ask, \\"no that wasn't our money, the previous people left it,\\" but the guy WOULD NOT LET US EVEN FINISH THAT SENTENCE.  We were trying sooooo hard to just say that ONE sentence cause that's what happened and that it's a big misunderstanding and that the server's a ho because SHE's the one who was trying to lie to us cause she didn't wanna serve, and there we were, unable to even finish a sentence as the guy would not even hear our side. Then, he says \\"if you don't leave right now, I'm gonna call the police and have you arrested.\\" What the heck? I've NEVER been kicked out of a bar simply because I'm never violent or disrespectful and this guy just wouldn't hear us out! \\n\\nSo, without a choice, we walk to the bar to close our tab and while we're waiting for the bartender, a bouncer approaches us and starts saying \\"you F**king mother F**kers, get the hell out\\" and just more f and s and d words and my guy friend was HEATED by this point. very understandably. He's 6'5'' and could punch the hell out of either the stupid supervisor or the bouncer moron, but we didn't do that cause we're better than that and didn't wanna get in trouble for no reason.  As we're waiting, I gently tab the supervisor and really really politely said \\"Sir, I'm sorry this had to happen but could you hear me out for 1 second?\\" then he leans over and I say \\"That money wasn't even ours and we just said that the table seemed to be empty when she told us we can't sit there.\\" He replies with so much pride and just simple rudeness, \\"Oh, so you just threw money at her, that's really cool.\\" \\n\\nWhat the hell man?? First of all, I have no money to throw just so that someone goes away, and second of all, I'm not that kind of person. I've been a server before and I know how hard it is, why would I do that to anybody? I'm a normal, polite, not to mention sober, person and it was just SO frustrating that he wouldn't listen AT ALL. What kinda customer service is it?? We got kicked out because a server LIED cause she didn't want to serve another table, and because the so-called -supervisor wouldn't let his customers even explain what happened.  \\n\\nIf I had the authority, I would shut this place down IMMEDIATELY.\\nWe didn't even get to finish the game we paid to watch and it ruined our night completely when it was one of ours birthday.

While the server was friendly, the food, including an appetizer took forever.  My partner suggested we just get the check for the app and head over to Trader Joe's for a bite after we hit the hour mark.  The server apologized and blamed it on a full restaurant, but they actually weren't full.  There was no wait for an inside table when we arrived.  On top of the ridiculously long food wait, a neighboring table (we sat outside) was disturbing all tables around them with one lady in their party laughing ridiculously loud.  I mean really loud, like a hyena.  A server or hostess had to close the door to restaurant due to the noise and a gentleman from a neighboring table eventually got up, went over and told them they were being very disruptive a no one from True Food asked them to quiet down despite obviously disturbing all diners around them.  The shocking thing is once the gentleman who asked them to quiet down left, 2-3 True Food servers came up to the offending table and told them they were fine and don't worry about it.  A lady from a neighboring table of 6-8 ppl who were the most disturbed by this rude group couldn't believe True Food's response either.  Very disappointed in how True Food handled this situation even more than the incredibly long wait for our order.\\n\\n***Follow up - True Food's GM, Ryan reached out to me almost immediately to apologize for a less than stellar experience and to let me know he would do everything possible to rectify the issues. Ryan was sincere in his desire to make his restaurant a great experience which I appreciate.  He also offered a gift certificate which I declined as I don't yelp in hopes of getting gift certificates, but the gesture was appreciated.  We will give True Food another try.

The location had a couple families eating inside around lunch time.  The place appeared clean and nice.\\n\\nWhen ordering, I asked what the most popular item was and a gyro was suggested. My friend ordered a traditional gyro with french fries and I ordered a chicken gyro.  We also ordered a house salad to share.\\n\\nThe gyros were served by the family's older son, who was polite.  The side of French fries was very small.  The gyro had very little tzatziki sauce on it and quite flavorless.  The chicken was in the form of identically looking, spice-embedded, thin, rectangular slices and came with iceberg lettuce and a small squished slice of tomato.  The pita was slightly warmed.  The entire gyro was very sub-par and I've had way better, so I was really disappointed.\\n\\nWhile eating our gyros, our house salad had not yet been served and we asked about it.  The son and mother had a disagreement over whose fault it was that it was never made.  The $6.99 salad was brought out after we finished our gyros and was served with iceberg lettuce, a sprinkle of thin veggies, sliced green olives and per our request, no chickpeas but with feta cheese.  The salad was served with a cup of creamy Italian on the side.  The salad was also underwhelming and we were not interested in forcing ourselves to eat it.  I was hoping for more of a true Greek salad.\\n\\nThe food was priced as follows: chicken gyro $6.99, traditional gyro $6.99, fries and drink $1.99, Mediterranean house salad $6.99 = $23.  I felt that quality for the price was not worth it at all.  In addition, all hot foods, including french fries, are warmed in a TurboChef oven (think Starbucks oven), as identified by the owner in another post.\\n\\nWe truly were hoping for great food and great service but unfortunately, this establishment misses the mark.  If you're looking for Mediterranean food, check out a highly-rated restaurant only another 10-15 minutes away on 192 called King O' Falafel... they have amazing food."},{"name":"Kacey's Home Cooking","address":"3925 Lavista Rd","city":"Tucker","stars":"2.5","text":"If you're in the mood for canned slop and hateful service, come on down to Kacey's Home Cooking!

I was ok with this given Pok Pok's reputation and popularity. My Wife, and my friends went over to their Whiskey Soda Lounge to hang out while we waited. The service at the lounge was very good, a great bartender who was very friendly and humorous. After at least and hour and a half I asked them when our table was ready, he told me he was not sure. I decided to just find out for myself and walked back over to the restaurant. When I spoke with the host, she looked up and down the list for my name and said that she was going to lie to me and make something up but she was new. The regular hostess came back over and I asked her when our table would be ready, she also looked up and down the list for our name even though we were clearly the next in line. She then looked around and said \\"I guess I can seat you now.\\" Then after being seated we waited for quite a while for our waitress. She finally came over, didn't say her name and then proceeded to ask what we wanted. Since it was our first time we all asked for her recommendations. She replied by saying \\"It is all good.\\" Trying to ask more specifically what she liked she again said \\"It's all good.\\" Our food came out in a reasonable time and the only saving grace was the quality of food. It was really top notch and made the experience worth coming back for. I can't say the same for the service. It seems that Pok Pok when it comes to service is too cool for school.

It was bad enough having to wait in line outside in the rain, but having to watch the seated patrons eating through the glass while you wait is particularly torturous in itself if you're famished and already salivating. Thankfully, Mike's Pastries is right across the street, so if you want something to munch on during the long wait, it's readily available. \\n\\nGoing in,  I already knew that squid ink pasta was a must-try, so I split a puttanesca squid ink pasta and an order of fried calamari with a friend. The calamari was decent, and the squid ink pasta itself was quite nice. The puttanesca dish as a whole, however, left much to be desired.

The Nook is not one of them.  I realize that its proximity to Piedmont Park means that as long as the beer is cold, \\"they will come\\".  Unfortunately, I discovered that The Nook no longer carries my first choice of beverage although they did a few weeks ago, but that's okay, I can adapt. \\n\\nAfter checking with the bartender, the server came back to tell me that he would bring my second choice (which he didn't actually bring with him.....he had to go back to get it).  I ordered the meatloaf sandwich and my husband ordered the french dip sandwich.  After 10-15 minutes, the waiter returned and said \\"you are going to kill me, we are out of meatloaf sandwiches\\".  I guess because he felt that not carrying a beer I liked is egregious enough so  that not having the food I wanted would really put me over the edge.  So I picked a club sandwich which I though would be quick because now we had been here for a little while.  About 10 minutes later, the waiter returned, looking very sheepish, and told my husband that they had \\"just sold the last of the french dip\\" so he also chose some else without looking.  Now we had been there nearly 40 minutes and were reordering. The waiter said the manager had offered a free dessert to compensate to which my husband replied that we don't eat dessert but he would take a free beer.  The waiter said he would see what he could do.  \\n\\nThe food eventually came but was not worth the wait.  Cold tater tots and slimy club sandwich that was constructed in such a way that it fell apart upon trying to pick it up.  It looked mighty impressive unless one wished to eat it and then it was just disappointing.  My husbands hot dog was dried out and unappetizing. Upon dropping off the food the waiter had again mentioned something about adjusting the check due to the items not being available and the increasing long wait.  The free beer never materialized and upon receiving the check, we realized no adjustment had been made.  \\n\\nAs we left, I stopped by the hostess stand and interrupted the woman who was engrossed in social media apps on a phone that she was holding strategically below the top of the stand but not out of sight.  I asked for a manager and was a little surprised to be told that it was her.  As I explained our experience to her, she only looked at me blankly.  No expression, offer of apology or understanding so I kept talking, thinking she possibly didn't realize how long we had been waiting or how bad the food actually was or that we had been led to believe we would receive a token free beer or discount which were not forthcoming.  I eventually finished with \\"and the fact that you are doing nothing but just staring at me is really annoying\\" (well....to be honest I didn't say annoying).  We had just paid $45 for food we didn't want or enjoy and the Manager honestly could not have cared less. We won't go back but unless people complain, they won't improve so if your experience is good, that's great.  If not, please tell them so.

Dessert was a cake with blackberries and HIggin's vanilla ice cream. \\n\\nIt is a bit pricey $115 per person but I think its great!

Pok Pok can be best described as a Westernized Thai and Vietnamese blend.  I have had a lot of both Thai and Vietnamese food in my life so I have some perspective here.  Overall, this place is extremely overhyped and offers nothing extraordinary whatsoever.  All the food is pretty much drenched in spices, salt, and fish sauce.  First, let me say that the service was fine; wait staff was friendly and helpful.  One waiter was about to place a dish on our table and realized something was wrong and immediately took it back without any hesitation (appreciate that).\\n\\nSo I'll go through each dish we ordered.\\n\\n1) The famous chicken wings (1 star).  We ordered a plate of spicy and a plate of non-spicy.  Nothing special here whatsoever.  I have had much better wings elsewhere in various Asian restaurants.  The flavors were not unique nor interesting. Very salty and heavy in fish sauce.\\n\\n2) Papaya pok pok (2.5 stars). Pretty standard papaya salad compared to most Thai restaurants.  I recommend skipping this dish.\\n\\n3) Neua Naam Tok (flank beef salad, 2.5 stars).  This was one dish that was decent because it simply wasn't as saturated with spices as others.\\n\\n4) Kai Yaan (game hen, 2.5 stars).  The chicken itself had decent flavor and tender.  The sweet/sour and tamarind dipping sauces were a little interesting, but again too salty and heavy in fish sauce.  Overall, this dish is acceptable because you can control the amount of sauce you put onto the chicken.\\n\\n5) Fried whole fish (1 stars). This was a special of the day item. It was a whole white fish (tilapia?) deep friend then buried in a mix of fried garlic, chili peppers, and other spices.  Again, this was dish was just an overload of spice, salt, and fish sauce. \\n\\n6) Cha Ca Va Long (catfish over rice vermicelli, 2 stars). The mix of herbs and spices give the dish a distinct taste but is hard to enjoy when the dish is just drenched in oil.  Take a bite of this and your mouth will be awash in oil and herbs.\\n\\n7) Thai iced tea (2.5 stars). Pretty standard.  It comes in a bottle with Pok Pok's own label so it looks like at least this product is standardized.\\n\\nOther thoughts. Rice is extra: $2.50 - 3.00 per bowl!!!  You are given a fork and knife (instead of chopsticks, but are available upon request). This strongly indicates that this restaurant does not cater to customers familiar with Asian restaurants.\\n\\nMy final thoughts are to look else where for food in Portland.  I only went here because of the hype and despite going in with an open mind and trying to keep my expectations real, this restaurant was a big disappointment.  I have had much better food at many other restaurants.  This place does not offer good Thai nor Vietnamese food.  The them at Pok Pok can easily be summed up as a heaping overload of salt, spices, and fish sauce in almost every dish.  While I appreciate the service by the wait staff, I can't help but give this place 2 stars just because the food is truly so sub-par."},{"name":"Burdock","address":"2702 Main Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"3.5","text":"Immediately, the grilled beef brisket ramen caught my eye and it proved a fairly satisfying and flavourfully comforting dish.

A table in the back went up 3 times stating they had to get going and had been waiting over an hour. When they finally got their food, it was 2 plates of pancakes and 1 bagel with fruit.

When we did get our food, it was not good at all. The \\"homemade corned beef hash\\" was literally about 4 slices of corned beef deli meat, stacked up and sliced into rectangles, with eggs on top. I was SO disappointed after that wait. No shredded meat, not mixed up with veggies and potatoes. The homefries were delicious and I liked that the whole meal was served on Staube cast iron. We were pretty bummed over all, and the meals were $13 each which does not even begin to seem worth it, for waiting an hour for slices of deli meat. Also the women's bathroom was really gross, all wet, dark and dirty.

Be that as it may, last night being Friday I thought I would treat the family to a delivery from BP in New Westminster.  First time ever ordering in from BP (have always eaten at the restaurant itself, although not in New Westminster), and the fact that a menu had arrived through our door was more than serendipitous.  We made our choices and placed the order over the Net (very convenient), although after I had submitted the order I paused to reflect on the extremely high price.  I managed to assauge my financial conscience by reassuring myself and my husband that it was a \\"treat\\".  This seemed to lessen the pain of purchasing a very expensive meal at a pizza joint.\\n\\nThe order arrived within the allotted time (40 minutes) and we opened the containers with gusto.  First disappointment:  the food was not hot.  It was, in fact, barely room temperature.  Second concern:  except for son's burger, the other items did not even resemble what we thought we had ordered.  A nice bonus for first-time customers is the addition of some free Bandera bread.  Third set-back:  this bread was too salty to eat!  It was actually unpalatable.  We each had taken a slice and immediately threw it in the garbage.  On to the meal...son reported his burger as being \\"good\\" but I noticed he had thrown more than half of it in the garbage.  Our meals:  fourth major disappointment.   Suffice it to say, both of our meals were the worst ever take-out food we have had (and we have had many take-out meals over the decades).  I truly mean, absolute worst.  My order was cold (tasted like it had been taken out of a freezer and microwaved, but the centre was cold), and my husband's meal was so spicy (and he loves spicy food) that it, too, went the way of the rest of the order.  He said all he could taste was tabasco sauce.  Ugh.\\n\\nWe did call the restaurant to let them know that the food was really terrible, and the manager very kindly offered us a credit; however, this is a mixed blessing, as I truly believe we will never order from Boston Pizza again, it was just that awful.\\n\\nIn summary:  The food was unpalatable and extremely expensive.  The addition of two desserts really beefed up the total cost of the meal as well, and they, too, sadly were not enjoyed.   Would most definitely NOT recommend this restaurant."},{"name":"Lucy's On The Fly","address":"2043 South Lamar Blvd","city":"Austin","stars":"3","text":"Great spot for fried chicken and comfort food.

Service here and everywhere else in the hotel is top notch. Very friendly and accommodating. The bar service was always great, no complaints at all. Like any bar/restaurant, busy hours are busy! You may need to wait a bit if you don't make reservations in advance. When it's crowded, a good amount of noise from the bar reaches the surrounding tables (the bar area is open, not separated). The food is slightly higher priced but for a date night out I think it's generally worthwhile. However, I went to the lobster night once-- never again! I expected the wait for a table-- the food came pretty quickly after being seated and eating the soup. But wow, was the food bland. I've never had a lobster anywhere else that was so tasteless. Not worth the cheap deal at all, and at the price of two lobster meals with a date/drinks/tip, definitely not planning on trying it again.

Overall I've had great service here but last time I don't know what happened because we ended up getting ALL of our food at once, apps & entrees, and when we said we weren't ready for everything at once we saw the server (or a server, since you get like 15 people waiting on you) put the food on a tray to the side and bring everything back when we were ready.  I don't know if that was a communication mix-up with the kitchen or what regarding when the food came out, but there's no way anyone should've brought us entrees before we even had a chance to eat our appetizers.\\n\\nFood/drink: excellent!  Brunch is really nice and priced well, so I really recommend that.  I also recommend making reservations because brunch is only offered on Sundays and I bet it's getting more and more popular.  Dinner is great too.  You have to try the oyster slider at least once; ditto for the lobster roe pasta which is totally craveworthy.  If you still have room, do yourself a favor and order the biscuit, which is huge and doused in honey and amazing.

Me and my special lady are both Platinum Elite with Marriott and used points to stay at the hotel. First they charged a resort fee that was 19 dollars, annoying but I guess somewhat standard in this day and age. Next they charge 25 dollars a night for parking. This is preposterous. I understand if you are the Ritz Carlton in Manhattan parking spaces are sparse and you charge an absurd amount for guests to park, but this JW is literally in the middle of nowhere with an infinite amount of potential parking spaces. So we ended up paying 44 dollars a day to stay at a hotel that also cost like 200k Marriott points. Thats silly\\n\\n2. The TV's in the rooms have a little connection box where you can plug in component or HDMI cables. I didn't bring my work bag so I didn't have an HDMI cable with me. The  little information card says \\"connect with provided cables\\", I couldn't find a cable in the room. I called the front desk and they said one would be brought up and it was after about an hour. Come check out time I see they charged us 30 dollars a day to rent the HDMI cable that was allegedly \\"provided\\" according to the card in the room. 30 Dollars. A day. Even the charlatans at best buy don't charge 30 dollars for a cord and you end up owning that. I am pretty non confrontational but there was no way I was paying 120 dollars to use an HDMI cord, especially given at no point did they say they would be charging me for it. I talked to the front desk, then the manager for about 20 minutes and they wouldn't budge. So I stepped away, called the Platinum hotline and in 2 seconds they called the hotel and had the charge removed. \\n\\n3. The internet- should be free due to Platinum status, should also be covered by \\"resort\\" fee... they still tried to charge us for it. \\n\\n\\nBasically, this is supposed to be a really high end hotel.

I ordered the Farmer which is a biscuit, fried chicken breast, pecan wood smoked bacon, cheddar cheese topped with gravy with a little bit of apple butter.

However, once you've been going there long enough, it just becomes part of the scene because the food outweighs everything. \\n\\nIt's also really difficult to just walk in during the weekend to enjoy a meal.

I did note they are expanding into more space and maybe they will become a real restaurant. The owner is verrrry friendly and outgoing and a real hoot to talk to. The food was OK but nothing I would venture back out for. The meatballs obviously are the stars here. My wife had a smash and I had a mine over. I ordered the bean ragout which tasted like pasta faglio only there just wasn't very much of it it as I expected it to be on a bed of ragout. My wife's smash was tasty and tasted better than mine but the bread left a lot to be desired (We are very bread critical). We ordered an appetizer of focaccia which was four very small soft pieces. It was okay, again nothing to write home about. The meals were accompanied by a two-bite salad so that was disappointing. Also they came with a small side bread and I mean small. I got three meatballs of substantial size but they were bland with minimal cheese covering them and frankly packed too tight.We make our own chicken or turkey meatballs (we get many compliments on them) and they are light and crumbly as I cook them in the sauce. These were too hard. There is no d√©cor to speak of so don't expect it to be like a restaurant. Takeout seems to be what they are pursuing. Poor location in a small strip mall right off the highway you can easily miss it. I also did not like watching the many smokers hanging and goofing around outside of the sports bar in the same strip. The Italian music is a nice touch and relaxing. Overall I got mixed vibes from this location as it seems to not know what it wants to be. Points for making everything fresh.

It comes with the pita wrap, your choice of white or seasoned rice, and a drink for $7.00. When I got my food the presentation was also lacking. The rice came in a Styrofoam bowl and then the falafel pita wrap was wrapped in tin foil and placed on top of a paper container that one would normally see fries in. The wrap was literally balancing on top of this container because the wrap was too big. It didn't make sense. Anyway the seasoned rice was a bit dry as was the pita wrap.

I also knew that going in, while Com serves up some Vietnamese dishes, it is mainly Vietnamese-French fusion. So I will say from the get-go that if what you are seeking are the Vietnamese basics, like spring rolls (goi cuon), pho, rice/meat (com), noodles/meat (bun), subs (banh mi), you are just better off going to any number of Vietnamese places off Buford Highway. While Com might have them as well, they are jacked up in price. \\n\\nLet me give you an example. Com -- a rice dish with grilled meats, pickled veggies and fish sauce. Pretty basic and simple dish. It will run you about $7-8 at places like Pho Dai Loi. At Com, there is a BASE price of $10. That's right, $10 for the rice, which apparently is infused with pandan, so it has a green color. That's about the only difference I can see between that and typical com. In fact, Com's version comes with peanuts and crispy onions, which does not compare to the usual pickled veggies... those are the best part! If you want meat, it's an additional fee. Shrimp at $5.25, beef at $3.25, and so on.\\n\\nAnyway, after balking at the idea of base prices for things such as com, bun and pho, I decided to go with the grilled chicken and shrimp satay. It was served with a soy-chili dipping sauce, steamed broccoli and \\"rice macaroni.\\" The chicken breast was pounded extremely thin and placed on the skewers. I got four shrimp, one on each skewer. The steamed broccoli was there, as well as the \\"rice macaroni.\\" It was essentially macaroni shaped pieces, but made with rice flour instead. It was... odd. Very mushy. Not good. So I skipped the macaroni and ate my chicken, shrimp and veggies. It tasted fine, but was it worth anywhere even close to $13.75? Not a chance.\\n\\nMy co-workers and I got three desserts to share -- the peach melba crepe, banana and nutella crepe and the million dollar cake, which was brownie, cheesecake and chocolate mousse layered in a cake. All the desserts were very good. If anything, the crepes were a tiny bit on the tough or overcooked side, but I enjoyed them all.

The pork belly/shoulder was for me the winner: perfectly sweet and savory and bursting with flavor, while the pork itself was beautifully juicy and tender. The papaya salad was quite good. The crab (which you don't actually eat) is merely there to deepen the flavor. Interestingly, the papaya salad was the spiciest of the three dishes, and by far spicier than any papaya salad that's ever crossed my palette. (All three dishes were actually pretty spicy, which is a definite plus!). The boar was also excellent and totally unique. \\n\\nWe got there kind of late on a Sunday night and endured a 30 minute wait. This place is obviously insanely popular, so reservations are wise.

The food is outstanding, you can literally watch it cooked in front of you, and the service is much more professional than you expect; they certainly have serving people down to a science.  Part of that has to do with the fact that almost everything is self-service, the only thing you tell them at the counter is what you want, and how much of it.  Gotta go for the moist Brisquet, as it's fork tender, and has a delicious pink smoke rind, and just falls apart when piled up on a slice of the white bread they give you.  I was able to try their sausages as well, along with their Potato salad, and both were fantastic.  All of that, and their prices can't be beat for the quantity of food you get.

When I saw \\"Southern Comfort Restaurant\\" on the sign, I swear I could hear a chorus of angels....but then again, I was fuckin hungry, hot, and somewhat delirious.\\n\\nTony's is a cute little joint.  It's not so little, actually and they have plenty of tables with green checkered tablecloths and curtains.  The menu is full of Southern classics--a dilemma for me because Austin is as close to the South as I get most of the time so I had better choose wisely.  I was torn between country fried steak and chicken and waffles.  Because I'm a scientist of chicken and waffles, I chose the latter.  (Also, the menu said it was a \\"Belgium [sic]\\" waffle which I thought was cute.)\\n\\nI must say, it wasn't the perfect chicken and waffles.  The waffle was slightly undercooked and not crispy enough.  And I vastly prefer chicken thighs, but they only serve boneless breast.  But the chicken was very juicy and well-seasoned. That's about all I can say about the food.  There was no groaning in pleasure or excessive licking of chops.  \\n\\nNormally, in a situation like this, I would give the place three stars.  However, everyone here was really super friendly and nice and it made up for the ok food.  On my way out, the cook (presumably Tony?)--with a droopy chef's hat, chilling out in the dining room watching a basketball game--smiled and asked me \\"Didja like the foooood?\\"  all casual-like as if I'm a regular.  There are other pluses to Tony's.  First, I ordered iced tea and I was asked if I want \\"regular\\" or sweet tea.  Hellooooo, sweet tea!!  I wish more people would ask me that question when I go out to eat at home.  Second, the sweet-voiced waitress was wearing a Misfits shirt.  You will have to go there and see her to know that you wouldn't necessarily peg her as someone who'd wear a Misfits shirt.  But when I asked her if she's into them, she said that she had a glow in the dark Misfits shirt that someone stole so she had to replace it with a non-glow in the dark one.

So we got on the bar waiting list and within no time we were sitting at the bar ordering drinks and food! We started off with a draft beer (me; Brown Ale) and a Toronto (my buddy). The bartender was awesome - knowledgeable, efficient, and friendly (but not all in your business, if you know what i mean). After reviewing the menu and discussing with the bartender, we decided on an assortment of raw oysters. Honestly I don't remember the exact ones we got, but they are all from the northwest and for the most part were very flavorful - briny, fresh, and just very, very good! After that we settled into another round of drinks, me another beer (this time the house draft lager) and my friend another Toronto (my now he thought he was in Canada!). We moved onto the next course, me the clam chowder (I am in Boston, right!) - super good - fresh clams, bacon chunks, potatoes...the only complaint, if you call it that, is that it wasn't as creamy as I thought it might be - but still it was very good! My colleague got the Salmon Tartare - which came out as a beehive looking thing, which he said was very good - I will have to take his word for it. OK, so another round of drinks and onto the last course of the meal, which by now I hope you realize we were getting stuffed and decided to split a \\"Today's Fish Selection.\\" The day we were there they had swordfish as one of the specials, which came with gnocchi and fresh vegetables, so we decided to split the dish - which was the perfect amount of food.

There are some others that are better, a lot of others that are worse, but the best thing to compare them all to is the easily accessible and quite good barbecue of Rudy's.  I usually just get the lean cut brisket there.  It's smokey and sufficiently tender and moist.  They never run out, and it's consistent throughout the day.  Most barbecue places are good from 11-2 or so, and then it tastes like you're eating jerky.  Rudy's does a ton of volume and is a great stop even for dinner.  Their brisket is not quite as tender as a few other places, but is still a solid choice.  Their prime rib is a pretty solid value as well if that's what you're in the mood for.  The highlight for them is their sauce.  It's a little bit spicy for some people, but just right for me.  I also enjoy the creamed corn.  It's a little sweet to eat as a course, but I usually just have it as my \\"dessert.\\"  The thing that I probably appreciate the most about Rudy's is their commitment to not having a line that takes forever to get through.  They have a single line, but 5 or 6 people working at a time so you can get your food quickly.  Other places are a good option if you think you'll be hungry in an hour or 3, but Rudy's will get you your food quickly and with a smile.

Aside from my university bookstore, I have never found books so specific to my area of study. I know my friend feels similarly. They have pretty much everything imaginable. What's even better is that you can hang out and read as long as you want. The employees don't walk around and glare at you while you peruse and read, which is very much unlike the typical bookstore experience where you are pressured to purchase a lot at high prices.

The kiosk is located in between Armani Exchange and Macy's on the first floor.\\n\\nI've got to admit, I don't give most mall kiosks any thought.  However, Macaron Queen has a nice little operation going on.  The Parisian-themed kiosk really stands out from other kiosks inside the mall.  It's heavily decorated in pink and other bright, cheerful colors.  There's lights, models of a Ferris wheel and the Eiffel tower, and stands decorated with real macarons.  It's playful and whimsical.  Even the lady who works here wears a cute pink dress with a colorful macaron-printed apron and a macaron hat.\\n\\nThe kiosk sells prepackaged bags and boxes of macarons along with bottled refreshments.  Macarons are delivered fresh each day.  The macarons are stored in three refrigerators at the kiosk.  Due to increasing popularity, the third fridge was added in June.  Flavors change daily.  Flavors I've seen include:\\n\\nVanilla\\nKey lime\\nRaspberry\\nCoffee\\nWhite chocolate mango\\nWhite chocolate raspberry\\nChocolate\\nPistachio\\nCoconut\\nSalted caramel\\nHazelnut\\nLavender\\nRed velvet\\n\\nA bag of three macarons starts at $3.75 ($1.25 per macaron).  You can purchase up to a 16 oz. box for $45.00.  All of the macarons have been pre-assorted, so you can't choose the flavors individually.  You can request custom macaron orders through Macaron Queen's web site.\\n\\nI've only tried a handful of flavors (e.g. raspberry cream, pistachio, red velvet cake) and so far, I've thoroughly enjoyed what I've tried.  The macarons are indeed fresh, incredibly delicious, and addictive.  What's amazing is how enticingly tasty and authentic the macarons are, yet they're lower in fat and sugar than traditional macarons.  Macaron Queen uses a relatively healthier macaron recipe.\\n\\nIf you're ever at Lenox and want a sweet snack, definitely swing by and pick up some macarons from Macaron Queen.  You won't be disappointed.  These are also a great gift idea."},{"name":"Arleta Library Bakery Cafe","address":"5513 SE 72nd Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Today I had the biscuits and gravy and The Portlander.

Drink the Thai or Japanese beers or go with whatever microbrew they happen to have.  The various hard liquors are also reasonably priced, so if you aren't a beer or wine drinker, scotch under $10 is a bargain.\\n\\nChicken Wings - get them spicy, and don't wuss out.  They aren't all that hot.  It's giant fried chicken wings, tossed in a spicy paste mixture with some chili flakes.  Finger lickin' good.  Wet naps are provided.

However, the attitude and organization of the front of the house the past couple times I've visited has been awful enough that I may have to overlook the fact that they continue to offer delicious food.  \\n\\nI gave my name and phone number to the hostess, and was told it would be a 45 minute wait.  She asked me three times to repeat my name and number, and then correctly repeated back the information to me.  Over the course of the 90 minutes we waited (which wasn't even the main issue - I've lived in Boston long enough to know that you'll wait for a table on a Friday night), I watched open tables sit there without the hostesses moving groups.  I checked in with the hostess who had taken my name and was told in a very snotty manner that they were \\"calling down the waitlist\\". I knew this was a crock because this also happened in February, and I had purposely been watching them and did not see one of the four hostesses pick up their phones for at least ten minutes.  In the meantime, even more tables opened, and the original wait time they had told me continued to increase.  Over the course of the wait, I watched 3 groups leave after waiting, 2 couples complain, and one group even came over to commiserate with us about the awful service after noticing that we had also been standing around while tables sat open.\\n\\nMeanwhile, the bartenders (who are always very nice and efficient if it's a slower night) were too busy coordinating the reserved spots at the bar (which I can only assume was chaos because it was so clogged from the inept dining room hostessing) to actually SERVE drinks.  We waited 10 minutes to be served and were openly told by a bartender that we had to wait while he discussed the seating wait list with his fellow bartender.  I know this is the same process they have at Eastern Standard, so I'm unclear as to why its not as successful at ICOB.\\n\\nFinally, I checked in AGAIN, and it turns out that after repeating my phone number back to me correctly, the hostess had actually entered my name AND phone number incorrectly, and had been calling the wrong number. This is ridiculous, and while she gave us a verbal apology, it meant nothing after her previously horrible attitude throughout the process.  \\n\\nICOB has amazing food, ambiance, and knowledgeable waitstaff.  Everything AFTER dealing with the disorganized and rude hostesses was wonderful, but having that experience when first walking into a place is absolutely enough to put a bad light on the entire night.  Because of this (and this pains me bc I really did/do love it here) - Food and waitstaff are 5 stars, but hostess experience makes it a 1 star.  \\n\\nBoston seafood is extremely competitive and you can get similar quality food somewhere else.

Let's go see the gang, try to remember what we liked when we were young, & get us some pizza.\\n\\nYummy. Just like we remember: large slices with a ton of toppings on a delightful chewy crust.

I went in the afternoon with around 7 or so other people to this place as a part of a food crawl.\\nI got to try 2 tacos and a sample of the hibiscus tea, as well as the churro. I believe the tacos were chicken and pork. \\n\\nUpon arriving, one of the cashiers greeted us and explained what drinks they had. She was very nice and patient. The tacos came shortly after. \\n\\nThe tea was fruity and sweet, a little reminiscent of sangria actually (which I love). The lime chia drink was pretty much like lemonade. \\n\\nThe tacos were AMAZING. The last time I had a handmade corn tortilla was when I was in mexico, and the ones they had here were even better actually - softer and more pliable and you could really taste the corn. The chicken one had a light flavour and it was a little soggy. The pork one however was delicious - the meatiness was cut through with the sweet pineapple. \\n\\nAnd the churros - fantastic !! They had the PERFECT chewy but not too chewy texture and the crunch. However I would have preferred a little less sugar and more cinnamon, and since Im not a fan of caramel in general, I would order it without the sauce next time. \\n\\nOverall I love this place !

I looked on the site and saw that the apps were half off from 430-630. Cool with me, I was game to go.\\n\\nWhen we first arrive, we are delighted to know that valet isn't a set price, they work off tips (cool, we took care of him later that night). Upon first walking in, I really liked the decor. It was dark and sexy, and had a cozy vibe to it despite the place being kinda empty when we arrived. They also have a pretty nice patio too (though it's facing the street).\\n\\nSo we sit in the bar area, looking around for someone to help us. Looking around, hmm, no one I guess. So I finally walk over to the bartender and ask him can we see some menus. He hands me a stack and I take them back over to my party. We sit for another 5 mins looking over the menu before a waitress finally comes up and greets us. \\n\\nLooking at the menu, I wasn't to thrilled at the prices for the drinks, but I figured maybe they packed a punch for the price. Wrong! I orderd the Tequila Bliss (Patron-Patron Citronge) and it was so-so. So I went ahead and order my apps, the Buca Beignets and the Buffalo Chicken Lollipops. \\n\\nWe sit and chat while we wait for our food and the show to begin. The food was really good. I would reccommend the Buca Beignets to anyone. And the wings were just right, not too hot at all.\\n\\n But feeling thirsty, I tried for another drink. I ordered a mojito (someone else in our party had one and it looked great). Got that, sipped it down, and still,nothing. I wanna give them the benefit of the doubt and blame it on my alcohol tolerance, but I don't think that was the case.\\n\\nOverall it was a good experience. The house band was good and they had some great (and one bizarre) performers go up.

My second visit wasn't as favorable.

I was shocked since I heard ICOB is the place to visit for on-point seafood in Boston, and swordfish isn't the hardest type of fish to prepare properly. In retrospect since I'm particular, I wish I'd advocated for myself and foodies world-wide by sending it back (not in an offensive way, but simply because it's wrong to eat food that puts you in a bad mood), but I was REALLY hungry. I will say the coconut curry sauce could've been more plentiful because it was delicious and could've countered the dryness and lack of flavor of the swordfish. The veg on my plate was well prepared too. \\n\\nBanoffee pie - very good. Lacked in presentation (needed something else around the plate for visual appeal), but tasted good nevertheless. The crust was really tough and needed more butter to give it a salty richness (I make a lot of graham crusted desserts) and moisture.

This is slightly sweeter.\\nSwami - Very similar to the above with the exception that it uses a curry sauce on the rice instead of cheddar. Go for this if your into indian food or want something more savory.\\n\\nA last tip, this place gets extremely busy, do yourself a favor and once you know what you like here.

My first time was not stellar as the wait for a gyro plus salad was a good 20 minutes when the place was pretty empty. This last visit sealed the deal that I won't be returning.  It started out fine.  My husband and I were jovial and the young woman behind the counter wrote our orders down. Chicken sandwich and a gyro with salad.....with tomatoes.  With the cost of tomatoes now you must request them which is completely acceptable. I appreciate that my husbands chicken sandwich was made to order and that the seasoning on the fries was actually good which ends the positive feedback for my review......\\n\\nWhen we were leaving I noticed wow the bag was really light.  I got home and oh my food wasn't in the bag. How convenient?! I asked my husband to call them while I drove back.  I got there and they had to unlock the door for me because they were now closed.  I told them they forgot my sandwich and the owner, I assume, said he was making me a new one. They put my sandwich on the counter and when I went to take it I asked if there were tomatoes and the young woman replied no. I then asked for tomatoes and she was not happy and I when I got home I realized that they kindly gave me the shavings of the exterior of the tomato. How kind.  It did match the lovely wilted lettuce and hard as a rock gyro meat on the sandwich.  The owner then insisted I take a piece of baklava which I ended up throwing away. As I was leaving the employees decided it would be funny to yell at me several times, \\"have a good night!\\"  I'm glad they found their mistake amusing.\\n\\nOn a side note they do have some makeshift planters outside.

I would have kept coming back everyday if only we had more time is Boston."},{"name":"Pok Pok","address":"3226 SE Division St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"I freaking love this place. We always spend way too much here, and get way too full, but everything is so good. For the first time recently, we actually ordered dessert. Which was amazing. I usually don't get dessert at Asian restaurants, because I'm not a fan of the flavors, but my tastes are changing a bit on that front, and the desserts here were killer anyway. Also, this last time I finally tried the drinking vinegar. It is like a vinegar soda, so it's a bit sweet, and a bit of that tang. I loved it, my husband hated it. So that will depend on your taste.\\n\\nSo, I love to read the negative reviews of places, because some complaints are legit, and others are not, and I make up my mind to try a place based on whether the negative reviews have merit in my own opinion. Below, I just wanted to take a moment to address some of the more common complaints about this restaurant, and give my own opinion on those issues.\\n\\nFirst, be prepared to spend some money here if you want to enjoy yourself. This isn't your standard $8 for a meal and leftovers type of place. The portions are small, and served family style because you are intended to share them (one reviewer complained that \\"his\\" meal came out later than the rest of the family, but you shouldn't be ordering separate dishes here. Yes, they do have the right to serve the food in this staggered manner, and no, you shouldn't overburden the kitchen by demanding that a large party get all of their plates at once in a family style restaurant). \\n\\nThe amount of flavor created for each dish takes time and effort, and so you will pay a premium for that. Just because it's Thai (inspired) doesn't mean it's going to be cheap. I had to say that because a lot of the negs are mentioning price in proportion to quantity of food, but it's not about quantity, it's about quality. If the food is not to your taste, fine, but expecting massive helpings like you would get in a noodle place... well, you should've looked at the photos. \\n\\nAnother common complaint is the wait time. This restaurant is on the No Wait app, so heads up. Use that if you're impatient. Otherwise, put your name on the list, do some shopping or have a drink at the WSL. One more, I see a lot of people complaining that the FISH SAUCE wings are too salty. One reviewer even complained that they smelled like.... FISH. So if you don't know much about Asian cooking, and you are trying this place on someone's recommendation, be advised that fish sauce is salty. The wings are salty, but delicious. If you don't like fish sauce, though, you probably won't like the wings. I personally don't think that they use too much, and they've been consistent every time I've had them. I'm sorry for anyone who had them on an off night, if they were really too salty, but to me, they are perfect."},{"name":"Clay Oven Indian Cuisine","address":"7696 W Irlo Bronson Memorial Hwy","city":"Kissimmee","stars":"3.5","text":"We're from out of town and we stopped in because they had a solid vegetarian menu.\\n\\nThis place is fantastic....the food, the service, the space.

I would eat here all the time if I lived here."},{"name":"Thunderbird Coffee","address":"2200 Manor Rd","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Thunderbird's a nice shop. It has a bright and warm interior due to the (mostly natural) lighting with sleek and simple furniture. From my experience, the noise level's just right, both in music and in others conversing. The coffee's good, and they're one of the few in Austin providing Cuvee. I will say that the pretentious level is a bit higher here than other shops, but don't get too turned off by that.\\n\\nThe biggest problem with Thunderbird is the seating and parking. When this place is busy, it's nearly impossible to find a seat. There's a good amount of spots at the bar, but when those are gone, you're done, especially if you're in need of an outlet. I don't mind sitting outside, but Thunderbird is NOT the place to come if the weather isn't accommodating. \\n\\nOtherwise, Thunderbird's a solid choice for both caffeine and studying.

I ordered the pan fried chicken almondine with sweet potato fries. The pan fried chicken came with a tangy lemon cream sauce with artichokes that balanced very well with the chicken. When the food came out, servers came by with complimentary cornbread and butter.

They offer chicken tacos, beef tacos, cheese empenadas, and nachos.  Our group of 5 ordered all of these items, and we were all disappointed with 3 of the 4 menu items.  The tacos are served on 3\\" round corn tortillas, with a little bit of meat (beef or chicken, whichever you ordered) and topped with a dribble of salsa.  That's it - no other toppings that you would normally expect on a taco (cheese, tomatoes, lettuce, onion, peppers, sour cream, guacemole, etc....)  And to make it a \\"platter\\" they serve it with a plateful of plain old corn chips.  So, looking at it from a nutrition standpoint, it's pathetic (corn chips, corn tortillas, & a little meat).  From a flavor standpoint, it's awful.  Tried to zip it up with some salsa, but your choices there are Salsa Verde (which is a green, runny, watered down sauce with little to no flavor), or a Chipotle Salsa (which is more like ketchup infused with some pepper sauce - sweet & a little spicy, but no chunks of veggies anywhere to be found).  The cheese empendas were better than the tacos, but still way below the normal expectation for a Disney experience.  I will say that the nachos were actually decent, as has been mentioned by other reviewers.  So if you find yourself at this sorry little taco stand in Epcot Center, my advice would be to just order the nachos and skip the rest of the menu.  Like Chris S. said, the nachos for $9.99 were a decent option on this menu.  But they are the only one.  I'm not a chef, nor a taco snob, but I've had much better tacos at the local tacobell.  There are so many other much better places to eat in Epcot .  We just got stuck in Mexico because that was the last country we visited at 8pm, and the park was closing at 9pm, so we thought we'd give this place a try, and it had to have been the worst food I've ever eaten.  Trying to save someone else the same fate.  And, by the way, we also complained to the manager about the lousy food, and his response was simply \\"I'll take that\\".  I assume he meant he understood our criticism, because he probably hears it all the time.

Sweet potatoes tasted like they were canned, creamed corn had cornstarch dumped into it with sugar to create a clear gel goo corn dessert, the lima beans were mushy and might have been from scratch. The hush puppies were excellent and not too sweet. \\nBread - would you all PLEASE let the yeast rolls rise before baking them off!!!!! Do it like granny does! From what I could being an ex - baker, they take maybe frozen rolls, let them thaw a bit and before fully rising to be more fluffy, they are baked off prematurely and at this point, they are about impossible to fully bake off. They ones I sampled were still doughy and heavy in the middle. If you guys left them out a bit longer, you'd have rolls that come close to Ryans or  Country buffet - promise.\\nSalad bar - I liked it and found it decent, a few steps up from the salad bar at maybe a Stevi B's. Iceburg lettuce (spinach is in a side container) , not a one brown or wilty piece there. Plenty of fixings : cheese, bacon bits, cucumber, onion, corn, garbanzo beans; ect.  I liked some of the cold salads. The cole slaw and carrot raisin salad were homemade, the potato salad and macaroni salad tasted like it came from Sams or Costco. \\nDessert bar - you need to work on this some. Its pretty obvious that the cakes and pies were shipped in factory made. Quit being so cheap and make some signs for the pre-made desserts you buy. This can be done very cheaply and you wouldnt have people guessing at them. (ex pumkin vs. sweet potato) the so called fruit mix cake was a hot mess. I believe what you were trying to make a recipe called Dump cake, which is yellow cake mix with fruit cocktail. You can do better than that. The banana pudding was very blobby and foreign looking. Look at mixing up the variety like rice pudding or bread pudding. Just a thought.\\nService was good and the tea glass never got empty.

The popcorn chicken comes with fried basil and jalape√±os, which is my favorite part of the dish.

It was our first time and the manager greeted us warmly. We didn't know what to get, so she made us two custom-ordered pies with two flavors on each: a sampling of four different vegetarian pies. If you're a veg head like me, get the one drizzled in balsamic vinaigrette. You'll thank me later.\\nThe pies are small, so go ahead, eat a whole one yourself. There's no better feeling than scorfing a whole pizza in one sitting.\\nAll-in-all, this is a great pizza spot.

The lettuce was fresh though. I liked the hummus the best out of everything. It was light and flavorful on its own. But because everything else wasn't very good I found myself dousing everything with hot sauce to boost the flavor. \\n\\nWhen I talked to the staff they said the falafel is that way because they fry it early in the morning and then microwave it to order.

When I find a good one, rest assured I'll be back. And I've found one, for sure, and it comes with a nice face behind the counter to boot.\\n\\nWhich brings me to the best part of the restaurant, a slim, sparsely decorated space with a patio on the Drag: the man behind the counter, who was outgoing and engaging from the start. He began by telling us about the family's history. \\n\\nHis mom's Lebanese and cooks very authentically with no canned or frozen ingredients, he said. The family came to Austin from New Orleans and brought their po'boy-expert cook with them. We didn't try that part of the menu, but I trust him.\\n\\nThis place's take on the falafel wrap ($5.99) is pretty sincere, basic and filling. The spicy falafel was softer than I'm used to, but it worked well, mashing together with the hummus and tomato. The whole-wheat pita wasn't dry, as they tend to be.\\n\\nAnd best of all, it didn't dribble out the bottom and into my lap. I hate leaving a pita place with whitish drippy hummus stains on my clothes!\\n\\nThe date had the beef shawarma (also $5.99), which he seemed to enjoy, though he said the last few bites were eye-wateringly spicy. \\n\\nWe shared this odd dessert, Kanafeh (or a similar spelling -- it was a special just written on a white board), that included filo (phyllo) dough, mozzarella cheese, pistachios, sugar syrup, BRIGHT ORANGE food coloring over shredded dough bits, and some sort of fruity-flowery flavoring. Neither of us liked it much, and after about four bites, the $4 dessert went to the trash. But all was not lost. \\n\\nIt was a little odd that the counter guy was listening so intently to us, but when he saw that we didn't like the dessert, he was quick to offer a refund, then a replacement. \\n\\nThe cashew baklava (pistachio is also available) was mellow and sweet, and we devoured our slices in a couple bites.

I ordered there special soup, and my husband ordered there half a chicken menu item. The portions were VERY VERY small for the PRICE you paid. And, if you want rice to accompany your meal, (which is highly recommended by the restaurant), you pay extra. Menu items say \\"Need sticky rice\\" as a suggestion to accompany the meal, but are an added fee. (which is odd for Asian restaurants, typically rice is provided with a menu item.) I think they can get away with overcharging customers for there food because of there trendy location and atmosphere. Oh, and there 'drinking vinegars' are different, and very good, but very expensive for the amount of ice you receive, yes ice, not liquid, or actual drink.\\n\\nThe food was good, very fresh, unique flavors, but meh.

The last thing I wanted to do was eat at TGI Fridays or Joe's Crab Shack (located next to the hotel) the entire trip. After reading numerous reviews on the web, I decided to try out Ceviche one night. My travel companion and I drove to Ceviche on a Tuesday evening, there was quite a bit of construction around the area, and some of the roads were blocked due to a private party somewhere, but we managed to find pay parking just down the block from the restaurant. I was starting to wonder if I had made a good choice because we were right next to the interstate, literally parking beneath it and my first thoughts (after wondering if we were safe) were that this was going to be a disappointing meal. Once inside the restaurant, I immediately felt different. The ambiance of the building was other-worldly, or maybe just like being in Spain. The dark wood, the red paint, the huge paintings of matadors and dancers and the music really set the place off. The restaurant was very large and it was practically empty. We were seated in an area to the right of the bar and had the entire section to ourselves. Our waiter was very attentive and excited to explain how to order tapas. We ordered 7 dishes, some cold, some warm. They came out very quickly and they were all just fabulous. The serving sizes were just right, not overly large and we ate everything and left full, but not stuffed. When the bill came, I was quite surprised, I was expecting to be paying around 60USD for that meal, but the bill was under 40USD. The only negative thing about my experience here was sharing it with my travel companion, who didn't seem to \\"get it\\" and was almost on the rude side to the waiter.

No issues there but the rest of the menu items were rather small (serving size wise).  The pork skewers came luke warm and the cucumber salad side was screaming hot (which was great for me but NOT for my daughter),  wished we could have had to option to order it without chili peppers.   The game hen was good but small  (My 6'1 200 lbs husband left hungry) we didn't have another meat options (that we didn't already order).  I ordered the papaya salad which was perfect in heat factor and flavor but also very small.  \\n\\nNeedless to say we all left hungry and with a dinner size bill, that shouldn't have been the case.  The water, wasn't offensive to me but I would rather have cucumber flavored or roasted rice flavored water instead of the cooked rice flavor.  \\n\\nDrinks were all good.  The beer was a hefty size.  French press was good and strong and hot tea was flavorful.

At most Thai restaurants, you know exactly what to expect. Here at Pok Pok, you're guaranteed to be treated to some tastes that you probably haven't had before.\\n\\nThe food itself isn't exactly just Thai. There's lots of other influences there as well, such as Laos and Vietnamese. But it all comes together so well that you kinda just forget what kind of food you're eaten and just enjoy the food for what it is. Only the best restaurants seem to have that level of appeal, and Pok Pok is right up there with the best.\\n\\nYou gotta have the Fish Sauce Wings here. It's their signature dish for a reason. This is where it gets hard to review food for me, because the taste was so unique that it's almost impossible to describe. The flavor comes at you from almost every angle with these wings. They're sweet and savory and spicy and bitter and sour all at the same time. I don't know how they managed that level of culinary perfection, but mark me a believer in these wings. \\n\\nWe also ordered the Neua Naam Tok which is pretty much a spicy steak salad with fish sauce. They warn of an intense spice here but even my delicate tongue was able to easily handle it. Lastly we ordered the Muu Paa Kham Waan, and the boar meat just seemed to melt in your mouth. So damn good. My mouth is honestly watering just from writing these past few sentences.\\n\\nReally my only complaint about the meal is something that these guys have no control over. I wasn't a fan of the Beer Lao. Really did not have a good taste to it at all. I basically just ordered it to say I've tried it, and it'll honestly be the first and last time I ever order it. Not good beer at all.\\n\\nService was very attentive and nice and we were able to be seated pretty quickly. Price wasn't bad at all either, especially with the high quality of food we were served.

No other wing can come close!\\n2.Game Hen Salad- the meat was so tender and all flavors complimented each other\\n3. Pork Belly in Ginger Curry- My fav, so tender and flavorful... did i mention TENDER!!!!\\n4. Muu Sateh- stringing pork fat after the sateh is a genius little touch, the pickle relish and the dipping sauce is something you'll want to take home.\\n5. Boar Collar- Super spicy but the chilled mustards calm down your palette, I recommend this without hesitation because of how tender it is.\\n6. Broken Crepe- served with muscles that are perfectly cooked. not at all rubbery. the rice crepe tastes sooo good. kinda like Okonomiyaki \\n7. Ribs!!!- served with dipping sauces a mild crowd pleaser.\\n8. Clay pot prawns- Sticky mass of glass noodles with shrimp in a pot.\\n\\nWhile everything was awesome my favorites were the wings, the boar collar and the pork belly curry. We ordered a bunch of food and staged it in two courses. I suggest when going to any Thai place to do this \\"family style\\" approach. When I traveled to Thailand back in 2007 it is how we ate and how we saw others eating. Also get lots of rice at it soaks up the juices of what your eating and becomes so flavorful. I suggest 1-2 more dishes then people. Pok Pok does the best, and always will do the best, Thai INSPIRED food.

The napkin trick was also served with a tiny plate of chips.  The chips were unusual and kind of bland.  Upon inspection of their menu, I noticed their were tons of special house rolls embedded with the idea of using spicy tuna.  Usually, I would stick to the more traditional rolls to decide whether to come back or not; however, tonight, I decide to go against the grain.  I went for the special rolls.  Mostly because I like what I read in the description.  I ordered a Lenox Roll and a Sunset Roll.  As far as I could remember, the Lenox Roll consists of shrimp and crab meat wrapped in rice and top layered with spicy tuna and eel with both spicy mayo and unagi sauce.  I am very hesitant about mixing two many different types of meat in a roll, but this was pretty damn awesome and I really enjoy that spicy tingle tickling the bottom of my tongue.  The spicy mayo was definitely up to par.  Sunset roll seemed like a very good idea since the description said it consist of scallop and shrimp tempura.

The oysters were indeed amazing and fresh so I'll give five stars for that. Based on other reviews, we had the lobster roe noodles and the fried oyster slider. What I liked about the noodles was the freshness of the noodles; they're not out of a box or anything. They're smooth and had the right amount of chewiness just like any fresh pasta should. As a dish, however, the flavors really weren't that dynamic. The Brussels Sprouts were undercooked. I wished they had been fried and topped the dish to add another layer to the dish, as the dish needed more diversity of textures. The beef in the dish wasn't that great unfortunately. It wasn't as flavorful as I would have liked, and the lobster was tough to chew. Overall, this was only a mediocre dish, and for 34 dollars,I should have been WOWed! The oyster slider had potential but also didn't hit the spot for me. The batter gave the slider a slight bitter after taste and the bread was too dense.

There's every kind of food you can imagine and more restaurants constantly opening. I've been to many of them, but strayed from my usual favorites to try Habibi. I arrived about 40 minutes before closing on a Sunday night and was the only one there. The staff was outside smoking but walked inside to serve me. Two nice guys. They were helpful and maintained a clean restaurant with good service. \\n\\nThe food, on the other hand, was average. It's similar to every other Lebanese fast-food style restaurant you'll find across The State and I eat at a lot of them. In the last six months I've probably tried two dozen of these. What disappointed me here was the beef shawarma was tough and lacked flavor. The chicken was lukewarm, average at best. It could have been due to the time of day, but every meal should be perfect regardless of what time of day you serve it. My rice was also hard. However, I did enjoy the hummus. To me, an amazing Lebanese restaurant makes their own pita rather than buying it in bulk. This place serves store bought pita. Make it on site and the customer would be thrilled. \\n\\nI'm sure this isn't the normal experience, but unfortunately it was mine. I ate about one-third of my dish and left the rest. With so many other choices nearby I won't be back, but I'm sure others will have a better experience. I wish I did too.

After the incidents described in the first update, I contacted Heidi, the CEO, and I was incredibly impressed by the level of professionalism, and the way in which my feedback was received and acted upon by Heidi herself, and one of her managers, Brett. I agreed with Brett to continue visiting Life Alive in Cambridge for two weeks, and then write a follow up review. So, here is that review. \\n\\nOverall, the Life Alive team have done a really great job in really taking on board my comments and experiences, and addressing them, I saw changes in a couple of days. It's *really* impressive to see such a degree of change in customer service in such a short space of time. Also, within *two* days, the service at the register was exactly like the way it used to be. I was greeted, my order was repeated back to me, it was friendly, and fast. That's no east feat, it was really very, very different to what we experienced in the past month. The service is friendlier, the atmosphere is definitely friendlier and more chilled. \\n\\nHowever, there were still some issues - though to be fair, there is only so much one can do in two weeks, though these errors continued throughout the two weeks and surprisingly, mostly by one of your managers. I was not looking for errors, I was not overly critical, I just ordered the things I normally order, ate in, and also ordered takeout. We had several problems with smoothies again, and again, the management team have been in touch, and have been working hard to rectify this.  I am empathetic, I know there is only so much that can be done in two weeks, but small things were not dealt with, and it just gave rise to too many errors, and with each error, my patience was running quite thin. I do understand why on Yelp, there are people who have had one bad experience, try you again, have another bad experience and then never return. I've been coming to Life Alive since day 1, and even with all of the errors, I kept returning again and again, - but the lack of consistency just drove me crazy. I have now left the United States, and work in Europe, but if I was still in Cambridge, I would, I imagine, try you again sporadically, but I would find it difficult to come back as a regular customer, 3-5 times a week, the way I used to.\\n\\nSo why four stars? Well, I love the food and I love the smoothies. I do think that for\\norganic food on the east coast of the United States, it is a fair price. Coming from the UK, and having lived all over mainland EU, food in the United States was a complete culture shock. I refused to eat out in the entire 5 years and cooked all of my meals - until Life Alive opened. I saw that people on yelp wrote that they could get a fruit smoothie/juice cheaper elsewhere - but they completely ignore that fact that yours do not contain high fructose corn syrup, xanthium gum, and goodness knows what else. I'm also really impressed by the commitment from the Life Alive team, and Heidi the CEO. The really sprung into action, and did all they could to rectify the errors I described in my previous update. There is no way, they could implement all of the necessary changes in two weeks, but judging by the changes I have seen, I am confident that they will iron out the creases eventually. \\n\\nHowever, lack of consistency with respect to pricing and the dishes and smoothies themselves to me seem like a really serious issue from where I'm standing (the customers point of view), and could potentially loose Life Alive customers."},{"name":"Moonshine Patio Bar & Grill","address":"303 Red River St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"I like this place mostly because of the vibe of Austin.

We ended up going with something else for dessert.\\n\\nAll the wait staff were super friendly and professional. During one point in our meal, I watched the staff re-set a table. Ever watch NASCAR? Me either... but recall those clips of a team descending onto the car as it pulls into the pitt and they have like... 30 seconds to change/refuel EVERYTHING with precision. That's what this was like. Their attention to detail was amazing. I saw the girl refluff  napkin three times before she was satisfied. Good for you girl!\\n\\nOk.. ok.. ok... onto the food! We split the artichoke appetizer... SUPER delicious! Not too greasy (even though it was deep fried) with a nice spicy sauce. Breadsticks were great too... with olive oil infused with... oh drat... something that escapes me now. \\nFor entrees I had the wing of skate and ratatouille while Red had gnocchi with pesto. Both dishes came out quick and were DELICIOUS. My skate's texture was just right and was buttery-good... perhaps a smidge too buttery if I were to nitpick. Red's gnocchi was very rich, but balanced by the sauce and the veggies.\\n\\nFor dessert we split the lavender beignets. Which... were very light on the lavender... but that's ok. They were still great - crispy, airy, goodness dipped in chocolate sauce. The waiter also brought out a nice treat from the chef... flavored marshmallows!? One of the flavors was olive oil... which was surprisingly scrumptious. I'd be interested to see what else they can do with that.\\n\\nThe ambiance was great... low-key and friendly. Soft lighting, not to crowded with tables, fireplace... a great special occasion/big date place. The bar downstairs looked pretty cool, and I'm assured that they have a nice bar scene with good drinks.\\n\\nWeighted pretty heavily in this review is the staff's ability to make you feel important and welcome. All the balance is there, informative but not pushy, friendly but professional, good humored, smiles. Well done.\\n\\nIf you forced me to complain about something...\\nThe only place where we didn't experience warmth was in the lady's room. IT WAS FRIGID COLD!

Yesterday a few of my coworkers and I decided to order Mission Sushi from Foodler and to say disappointed would be an understatement. Last night, I woke up and was sick (presumably food poisoning) but I came into work anyways hoping it was over but decided not to report it, as it could have just been me getting sick.\\n\\nOne of the other coworkers that ordered their sushi ended up not being able to come in from throwing up. After 2 hours of the food not being delivered, I assumed that this was plausible as any food that has been sitting for a while probably wouldn't sit well in a stomach and food poisoning might be the cause.\\n\\nNot asking for compensation, but allowing the owner to know that two people got sick from their food, I emailed Foodler and they contacted the manager. I received an email back from the Foodler support that said they were sorry and \\"I've spoken with the manager at Mission Sushi and Wok and she said that no one else has complained of food poisoning today, so she does not believe that you and your coworker's  sickness is related to the food at the restaurant. She was not willing to issue compensation.\\"\\n\\nAs someone who used to work in the food business, we used to take food poisoning seriously.

Mostly, we chose sashimi presentation. Three standouts:\\n\\n3. Tuna Mango- on a seaweed chip, perfect amount of salt/sweet- a great bite that finishes very clean. Fairly surprising. \\n\\n2. Kanpachi-Amberjack- beautifully cut, and a real kick from the Thai pepper. Like all good Thai food, this hits (and then fades) leaving only flavor. Perfect.\\n\\n1. Hotate- fresh scallops- whoopee, right? RIGHT. The preparation with Yuzu zest, Yuzu tobiko and a sublime honey vinaigrette- plus the perfect cool temperature? It was light, yet substantial, and was a perfect sort of palate cleanser, midway in our meal. Somebody was watching, paying attention, knew just when to serve it.  Don't miss this.\\n\\nThe only real critique I have is the number of dishes that come with jalape√±o, in one form or the other. I found myself flicking most of it to the side.

There was a long bar then several marble cafe tables. Parisian art and mirrors covered the walls. \\n\\nThe cafe menu had reasonable offerings between $5-$12. We started with a couple glasses of wine. The first pinot grigio on the list and the only rose. I loved the wine. At $7 a glass it was nicely priced. \\n\\nWe decided on a charcuterie plate for $12. While we were waiting the bartender gave us some bread and olive oil and invited us to check out the upstairs dining room when we were done. \\n\\nThe charcuterie plate arrived with a hefty selection of meat. Speck, serrano ham, prosciutto, cornishons and olives. All the meats had a nice aged flavor. It was a perfect accompaniment to the wine. \\n\\nAfter we finished up we went upstairs. I was blown away with the dining room up there. It was gorgeous. Part had a bar, then an open kitchen in the corner, view to the garden, a fireplace and just lots of French charm all over. Romantic and classy at the same time. What an upgrade from the Excelsior days. In the middle stood a huge glass wine storage reaching down to the first floor. There were 2 private dining spaces in addition to the large dining room. We encountered the owner, I believe, who talked about the renovation. All the staff we saw along the way were very welcoming. \\n\\nI took a look at the dinner menu which was priced moderately with most entrees in the low to mid $20s. I plan to be back again for more.

Super nice bike delivery guy as well and delivered faster than the promised 45 minutes.  Plus a $5 off Chinook Book coupon - which I admit is the only reason I ordered because a large pizza is $20-30.  So, why only 3 stars?  First, the crust - I gotta get picky here.  I would like the toppings to go as close to the edge as possible.  Otherwise I just end up tossing it because it's unfortunately kinda dry.  And I gotta say, they need to make it where the base price for a large pizza includes, say, 2 ingredients.  $1.75 extra for mushrooms and almost $3 for salami, when they don't pile 'em on, seems a bit extreme - so a $14.95 large ends up closer to $20.  Also, they hassled me on the phone as to where I was located - if you guys had mapquest or gps up (or, ahem, just was a bit more familiar with their neighborhood), you'd see that I wasn't lying about my house being in your delivery zone.  Then they didn't write my address on the receipt for the bike delivery guy to find my house, so he had to call me twice for directions.  So I think they still need to figure out the delivery thing.   BTW, I'd have gotten one of the specials but I just can't justify $25-30 for a pizza with tip.  It's good pizza but not Great pizza - I'd pay that for Hot Lips but not OTP unfortunately.

My vegan plate (polenta cakes atop sauteed mixed veggies with a red wine sauce) was really quite yummy, and my man liked his eggs, potatoes, bacon and rye toast.  As for the main attraction, I took one bite of a pumpkin pancake and didn't want more. \\nI like that Slappycakes uses local, organic ingredients. According to the menu, they also have a garden out back, and they compost.  So, yays for that.  Boos for the air quality, the over-oiled griddles (fried pancakes?), the random service, the freakin' ORANGE color scheme, and the too-loud music.

Having a hankering for a good steak and american foods, we came back at dinner time. It was a Monday night of a full school week, it did not surprise me that the place was relatively empty. The atmosphere was inviting and seating was prompt. In retrospect, the greeter was obviously bored as she was leaning on the hostess stand when we walked in. \\nLooking over the menu, there were many selections and some fun drink ideas offered. The waitress was attentive for the most part. It did take a little while to come back and get our drink order especially since there were only two other tables in the place and two waitresses. \\nWe decided on different items from the menu. A 10oz hand-cut sirloin with rice and dinner salad. A classic Caesar salad with cajun chicken. Loaded fries and Mozzarella sticks from the appetizer section. \\nFor as slow as the location was, the food took an exceptionally long time (30 minutes+), Everything was as we ordered but the presentation left a lot to be desired.\\nA hand-cut sirloin steak was certainly a stock steak lacking trimming or any attention other than a decent grilling process. The meat of the steak was cooked as requested but lost a good ounce to inedible gristle. The flavor on the steak (what could be eaten) was just as one would hope, charred and smokey flavors. The rice turned out to be a plain white rice with no seasoning or dressing of any kind. The dinner salad was thrown together with some previously shredded lettuce, a ton of shredded carrots and handful of tomatoes, some cucumber slices and some bland ranch dressing. The loaded fries were frozen fries with imitation bacon bits shredded cheese and some freshly chopped chives. Mozzarella sticks consisted of six(6) each with very poor marinara sauce ($1.50 per stick). The only saving grace to the meal was the Caesar salad with shaved Parmesan cheese and the grilled chicken with a light seasoning.\\nWith one beer, two sodas, a smoothie and two waters, the bill was ~$75. Accepting this is a tourism town, it seems a service-based business would try harder to stand out from the mundane and do something better than everyone around them not worse.\\nNone of us in our party would recommend this location to anyone for a good meal and a bad value for a mediocre one."},{"name":"Powell's City of Books","address":"1005 W Burnside St","city":"Portland","stars":"5","text":"Simply the best bookstore I have ever been to (and I have been to a lot).

We were really cold and had to keep our scarves and jackets on. C'mon, nobody is going to enjoy sitting there and you know it. Thankfully a table further inside opened up and we asked to be sat there which they were cool with. Vegetarian options were pretty limited and were mostly salad-like dishes and sides. The only entree was a curry-noodle soup for $14 which I couldn't fathom spending that much money on such a simple dish. Went with the fried farm egg salad, mushroom salad, and brussel sprouts. Great flavor on all the dishes, but we were mostly bored with our food. (Boke bowl makes a way more exciting brussel sprout dish for cheaper). Also found a chunk of cardboard in our mushrooms, but it didn't feel worth it to mention it to our server since I don't plan on going back here.

To top it all off, the bartenders weren't very friendly and in fact were rather dismissive and a bit rude.

You can tell that the ingredients are really fresh and the sauces that were drizzled over the salads and vegetables were delicious and flavorful.\\n\\nAmongst the 6 of us, we had the pork belly which came sitting on a mash. The pork belly was perfectly charred on the outside, the meat was soft and tender. The toast that came with the pork belly did not taste like toast at all, it was a pleasant surprise. We also had flat iron steak, the medium rare steak was tender and juicy, the steak came sitting on a bed of lettuce which contrasted very well with the savory flavor of the meat. We also had the whole snapper, it was about one and a half pounds. The Snapper was deep-fried but not oily at all. The skin was crispy and the flesh inside was flaky.

I ordered the seared tuna salad and it was ridiculously spicy and tasted boiled, not seared.I like spice, but I couldn't even begin to eat it. I had two bites and had the rest wrapped up.

For some reason, it makes me sick to my stomach. It was a really hot day and they set a pitcher of water on the table for us.  I poured a glass and downed it so fast. Then I tasted the coconut in it. Shit. It really made me more mad than it should have, maybe it was the heat. I mean, what if I had been allergic to coconut? (Probably shouldn't eat Thai then...) they should really just say something.\\n\\nI think the thing that just topped off the experience for me, is that with two out of three of us not finishing our meals due to distaste, we ended up paying almost $100 dollars with tip.

For about two times in a row, the rub was so salty that I almost couldn't finish the order of ribs. This one thing alone has kept me from going as often as I would have--which may actually be a good thing, being that it ain't exactly health food. \\n\\nMan the water I was drinking all night long after eating those salty ribs! \\n\\nThe text of my previous 5-star review follows.\\n\\nBest ribs I've ever eaten. And I've eaten them in Memphis (Rendezvous and other places), Kansas City, central Texas...you name it. These ribs are the best. I couldn't say how the sauce is, because they don't need sauce. Perfectly cooked, the meat is not the soggy, drooping off the bone overcooked mass that some barbecue restaurants try to pass off as tender--about as much effort required to pull the ribs apart as to tear a couple sheets of copy paper. Smoked to slight crispy perfection on the outside, pink, tender, moist and smoky on the inside. Dry rub enhances the natural flavor of the meat and smoke without overpowering it.\\n\\nThe side dishes are well thought out and unique. I loved the triple creamed corn. I haven't tried all the side dishes, or any of the desserts, but I look forward to many trips back to try them all. \\n\\nThe atmosphere is down-homey with an upscale feel.

Unfortunately, my brunch was less than satisfactory. I left that establishment and headed to Bistro Du Midi. \\n\\nThe last time I was there, I had the quiche, which was simply delectable. This time, I did not order the quiche, but someone in my party did.  I had a taste of it, and it was very disappointing.  The texture of the crust was gritty and hard, not melt in your mouth as a great crust should. \\nThe filling consisted of some kind of cheese that I didn't bother to check, asparagus and the usual quiche ingredients: Unfortunately, it was completely uninspired. \\n\\nThis unsavory quiche is not what one expects at a restaurant that calls itself a French restaurant. And not for the price that one pays at Bistro Du Midi.  The unappetizing quiche is what I would expect at a run of the mill wayside diner.  \\n\\nNow, I ordered the Salade Ni√ßoise, which was also mediocre. Nothing like the Salade Ni√ßoise that I'm accustomed to, and it certainly didn't remotely remind me of the ones I had in France. The seared tuna had no flavor, they could have put a little seasoning on it.  The boiled eggs were ok, but it's hard to mess up boiled eggs. They also didn't use the best quality olives. I buy better olives than that at Wholefoods all the time.  The salad itself was fresh,  and it had a bit of a pleasant surprise for me, which were the anchovies.  I do believe they can improve on the bland seared tuna, however. \\n\\nAfter dinner, our server convinced us to order dessert and so we did. I wasn't too eager to try the dessert after the milk-and-water dinner we had just experienced.  We ordered the Pineapple   Genoise, which is a very small piece of \\"hard pound cake\\" on a bed of brown sugar streusel, topped with some cr√®me fra√Æche ice cream and garnished with small morsels of pineapple and some cherries. I do want to compliment the tasty ice cream, that was one of the commendable aspects of this dessert. The presentation was pleasing, but the hard pound cake wasn't what I expected. I imagined a fluffier cake and not something that resembled a mini disk they use at the Olympics. It was just too hard: I'm not a fan of this dessert!\\n\\nWill I go back to Bisto Du Midi?

It took a few minutes to get seated but I got seated nonetheless. I dunno if the regular server was not in or if the system is set such that the manager/hostess is also the waiter, but after that I got a decent amount of time to consider my order. I chose the salmon sashimi, special fruit iced milkshake, phoenix maki, the special beef curry rice, and the matcha ice cream. Here is where the workflow starts to make my meal go from a slow opera into a crescendo of trap music (I honestly dunno how I came up with that but anyhow...). The hostess/waitress managed to get the order fairly quickly and served tea and then the special fruit milkshake. To this day, I have no idea what was in the purple milkshake though I feel it was a berry of sorts and had black bits floating in the drink. Mildly sweet and not overwhelming, it was a good start to the meal. A little bit later, I got the salmon sashimi. Only three pieces, but since those were thick cuts, they compensated for the lack of quantity with thickness. Either way, the sashimi was fairly fresh and didn't seem to be frozen as I didn't sense much water present in them. This is the part of the meal where things just heat up really quick. The seaweed salad came out in a hurry, followed by the phoenix maki, and subsequently the beef curry rice. The seaweed salad was a decent portion but pretty similar to other Japanese restaurants around here in terms of flavor. The phoenix maki is essentially a modified California roll with a torched salmon on top and tobiko flakes inside to provide a bit more of a crunch. The torched salmon didn't leave a lasting impression on me but overall, the roll had a generous 8 pieces  and was good for what it was presented to be. The special beef curry rice had a decent amount of curry, rice, and potatoes (I am used to seeing less potatoes elsewhere) but coulda used more and thicker beef cuts. The dish was satisfying though I woulda preferred for the curry and rice to be separated. Finally, the coup de grace in the matcha ice cream came with a subtle bitterness that compounded the sweetness of the ice cream. For $33 and all that food, pretty good. Besides the oddity of how the spacing between each dishes varied greatly, I have to give credit to the hostess for also being an effective waiter able to keep up with the counters at the front and tables in the back while having to take Dine Out Boston special orders and the orders off the regular menu items. She was also able to keep good tabs on the tea and refilling yours accordingly.

They have a good range of beers, great mojitos, and surprisingly good food.  The atmosphere is awesome outside on the patio.  I wish we had a patio restaurant like that here in DC.  We tried all three of the \\"totchos\\" flavors, and I really like the one with chili and jalepenos.  I then had the mahi mahi salad, which was really not a salad, it was a nice piece of fish with greens under it.  The fish was nicely flavored and the greens were quite good.

Quite frankly, this bar is offering nothing that isn't readily available at any other bar in boston; it's not worth the trouble. \\n\\nSo last night, for my friend's 21st birthday, we came to this bar at midnight. She got in no problem, so everything was great until I, who was last in line, gave my ID to the bouncer. I've NEVER been denied to a bar before, and my ID is a perfectly valid Oregon ID. The f$#*ing bouncer took one look at it, and said \\"this is fake. You have to go\\". I showed him not only all of my credit cards, etc, with my name on them, but also the only backup ID I had on me, my pilot's license. I'm 22 years old, 6'3'', and have graying hair. I also came straight from work, and was wearing slacks and a (tucked in) button down shirt. I don't know what I initially did to upset this @sshole, but he loved every minute of his power trip. \\nAt one point, he even threw my ID on the ground and said \\"oregon IDs don't bounce\\". Firstly, apparently they do, and secondly, I very much doubt this is a legitimate way to test IDs. They don't have a scanner, but they DO have a \\"book\\" (which I would LOVE to see) that shows the bouncer every ID in the union, and points out what is real and what is fake. \\n\\nI was civil for much of the conversation, but I'll admit I lost my temper towards the end of it. This didn't help my cause, but as it was my friend's 21st birthday (who I hadn't seen in almost 2 months), I was desperate. \\n\\nWaiting for my friends, my girlfriend and I went to bleacher bar, and got in without any problems. There are plenty of other bars that want my business, and I will gladly go to them instead of dealing with bouncers who take such joy in using their small amount of power on potential patrons. \\nI don't intend to come here again, and I don't think you should either. In the immediate vicinity, Landsdown is much more fun, and Bleacher Bar is a great sportsbar.

I don't care if you do not like chicken, hate wings or are a vegetarian.  If you are going to go to Pok Pok you have to get the wings.  These things are absolutely out of this world.  Just amazing.  Get them.  You should probably stop reading and do it now.\\n\\nWe have eaten Pok Pok a few times.  Though we have only eaten in the restaurant once.   As everyone has mentioned, the wings are absolutely amazing.  They balance sweet and spice in ways that I did not even know were possible.  But do not be fooled and order the 'spicy' variety of wings.  The house version balances everything perfectly.  The spicy version is good.  In fact, they are very good.  But they are not the best wings you have ever had.  That honor goes to the regular Pok Pok fish sauce wings.  As soon as you try them.\\n\\nThe Boar Collar is another dish that should not be missed here.  When it first came out I was initially disappointed in the serving size.  However, this little dish packs a whole whallop of flavor.  Mix it with some good sticky rice and you are good to go.\\n\\nThe only dish that I did not really care for was the Pok Pok salad.  I just could not taste any flavor through the dense layer of spice.\\n\\nPok Pok also makes a mean cocktail.  They have, hands down, the best whiskey sour I have ever had the pleasure of enjoying.  Their whiskey selection is impressive to say the least.   They also have a variety of drinking vinegars for those that do not drink or may happen to be pregnant.  These drinks are so good they almost make up for one not being able to drink alcohol and, therefore, those delicious whiskey sours.  I have never actually seen or heard of drinking vinegars in any other venue.  They were an absolute delight and come highly recommended.\\n\\nThere is really only one thing holding Pok Pok back from getting a 5 star rating.  And that is the wait.  The wait here on a weekend is legendary and absolutely terrible.  Kudos to them for opening the Whiskey Soda Lounge to hold the masses while they are waiting 1 hour + for their table.  But, last time I was in there I realized that the Soda Lounge has all of the best parts of Pok Pok - WITH OUT THE WAIT!  They have the epic wings, full whiskey selection and drinking vinegars.  And, really, i do not need anything else.\\n\\nOne final note - Pok Pok does have a to go window.  You can get your wings on the road in under 10 minutes.  But be careful.  You may find yourself driving around town sucking down chicken bones because you could not wait."},{"name":"Life Alive","address":"765 Mass Ave","city":"Cambridge","stars":"4.5","text":"Love this food!

So I feel like it is well worth $10 because it keeps me from snacking on other things all day. \\n\\nThe lines can get pretty long at the rush times, obviously. But it does usually move pretty quickly. My only problem with waiting in the long line is that there is not much room for it. I always feel in the way of someone - waitresses trying to run food to the correct tables, other customers moving through, etc. I realize this is no fault of anyone, just an observation that they really could use an extra two feet of space upstairs. The restaurant is beautiful though. I love all the plants and books everywhere. \\n\\nI usually get my order to go because it can be difficult finding a table during rush, especially if you have a large group. Although I have sat in a few times. The downstairs is pretty nice and less noisy than upstairs. Table service is decent as well.

My cocktail -- a little number made with local Calvados -- was fair but not memorable. Loved the '20s and '30s swing (if you play Ella I will drink there) but it was drowned out by bar noise; some really loud barware clanking and general hubbub by the staff essentially neutralized any ambiance those wonderful songs should have generated. The whole experience wasn't bad, it just felt a little...hyperactive. In a phrase: Barlow seems like manqu√© artisanal bar geared for a downtown set easily wowed by the presence of a little Demerara and a green mixologist in a smart vest. The bar [see what I did there?] for golden-age cocktails has been set very high in Portland so Barlow needs to go back to its playbook if it wants to aspire to a position as a clean, well-lighted place (in the Hemingway sense).

We began by eating the shrimp corn dogs as an appetizer and, although the food all together was very tasty, they were the highlight of the meal. Don't be fooled by the small portions because since we were a large group, they were able to let us add a few more for a small fee which is fair. A few people at the table got salads such as the cornflake chicken salad which, as far as salads go, looked very appetizing. I got the chicken fried steak with baked macaroni and garlic mashers. They were divine. The platter is a little pricey but you do get generous portions that allowed me to share with other people. I also had a taste of the center cut pork chop and it was very tender and juicy. The side was sweet potato fries and the sauce that came with them paired well with pretty much anything. The service was great at the beginning but I did notice that during the latter half the server hardly came to our table. It was a shame because I was hoping to order a side order of the cheesy grits but by the time that he came over, the meal was pretty much finished. So learn my lesson, and order everything early.

So I've been running test trials with meals, I came in to Mighty Bird with the intent of ordering a half bird and dipping it in queso. But when the queso arrived it was served with warm chips and my plan was foiled. Yeah, apparently that's all it took to break my trial will power- they weren't even freshly made chips. \\n\\nThe corner location is big, clean, and bright. They seem to have many employees, so there's lots of cheery over-service. Service is quick, which made it a great lunch spot.  \\n\\nI love the mostly Maine Root soda fountain. Love the chilled station of hot sauces, including a creamy jalapeno ranch. The bird on the other hand was extremely tender and flavorful, but at that price I would expect a higher quality ingredient or perfect cooking. I definitely wish the skin was tempting to eat. The queso was extra flavorful, but lumpy every 45 seconds. It's a restaurant based entirely around rotisserie chicken, if you aren't already a big fan it's probably not worth seeking out. I can see Mighty Bird earning extra points for its homemade tortillas which smelled delicious and I might come back to try, but I feel like no one in their right mind should charge $4+ for one conventional taco."},{"name":"Powell's City of Books","address":"1005 W Burnside St","city":"Portland","stars":"5","text":"Powell's is definitely fun, and a cool place to check out some books, but at the end of it, just a bookstore.

The manager kindly informed us that he would try to get us in but otherwise we may need to wait for a short period of time. He was very personable and up front and was eager to learn that it was our first time there. He made the wait much more pleasant than it could have been.\\n\\nOur lucked turned up as the people in front of us disappeared and we were able to get a table almost immediately. The hardest part about dining at Cafe Luna is not the wait, but rather what to select from their expansive menu. Being a rather picky breakfast eater, I found myself unsure of what I wanted to order, but eventually landed on the banana split french toast. It was the most decadent and creative breakfast meals I have had in a long time. My girlfriend ordered the grilled pear, bacon and gorgonzola omelet and she did not go wrong either. Those meals paired with a well brewed and artfully crafted cappuccino made for a great breakfast.\\n\\nIn closing, if you are interested in their brunch, be smart and make a reservation. I know I will going forward.

Long waiting list on the weekends.  This is not your typical Thai food.  The menu covers the 4 regions  in Thailand which all have their own unique flavors, ingredients and style of cooking.  I've been there several times and loved the variety.  So, if you're not one who enjoys exotic unique flavored dishes, it's not for you.  That explains the varied reviews.  Some dishes are meant to be light on spices and others more prominent.  With that understanding, you will enjoy the variety.  The many unique dishes we tried were good, but yes, the chicken wings were a bit salty.  It's still one of their most popular dishes.  We enjoyed fresh fish, mussels, rice noodle dish, their most popular chicken, shrimp, etc.   We had a party of 6 and everything was inhaled.  All the dishes had exotic names which I can't be specific.  It was a great experience.  I would go often if I lived there.  Everything is made fresh.  Pastes are ground by two types of motor and pestle.  The owner, Andy Ricker, has traveled to every region and learned to cook from scratch from locals from each area.  His book, Pok Pok, is like an encyclopedia, so detailed, describing every ingredient, every region cooking style, etc.   It takes a lifetime to achieve this level of appreciation.

However, since they don't take reservations, it was highly unlikely that our party of 8 would be seated here easily. So we ended up making reservations at Panza -- When we got there 20 minutes before our reservation time of 9:15 pm, we were told we probably wouldn't be seated closer to 9:30, so we left & tried our luck elsewhere (especially after reading other reviews of their poor reservation system and still a lot of people waiting to be seated). Lucky for us, The Daily Catch didn't have a line, which is just a block away across the street. We only waited about 10 minutes while another group had just left and they cleared the table for us. \\n\\nUpon seating, they brought out some bread baskets for us. I ordered a glass of red wine, which was served in a plastic cup (doesn't bother me much but it might for other people). The main reason I wanted to come here was to try their squid ink pasta -- I ordered the aglio olio, which is the squid ink pasta with ground squid and sauteed garlic (lots of it) and olive oil. If you love garlic and squid, then this is the dish for you. A normal human being would probably eat 50-75 percent of this huge portion entree, but I couldn't help but continue digging into the oily, garlicky and salty squid goodness (plus I didn't want to have to bring this back to our hotel). I also got to try the squid ink pasta puttanesca, which was also equally great. Everyone in our party was very happy with all the different seafood and pasta combinations we all tried. \\n\\nThe whole restaurant itself is very small so seating is very limited. The kitchen area pretty much takes up about a third (almost half) of the entire space but you get to see the chef cooking up your food, which are then served in the pan it was cooked in. It seemed like it was only operated by 2-3 people. Despite that, the chef churned out every dish very quickly and simultaneously for our large group. This restaurant is a no-frills casual type of place. But I enjoyed the intimacy and the feeling like you're eating in someone's home.

The galbi is the best in the state and some of my friends that live in the D.C. area and NYC (both with much larger Korean populations) say that this is the best that they have ever had!  I'd give it 5 stars if it wasn't for the service and the seedy location.  When ordering, not only do you get the galbi, you get the endless amounts side dishes (banchan) and a bowl of rice, along with some Korean miso-styled soup (daen-jang jigae), which is delicious.  If you are really hungry, I recommend the galbi and an order of their o-jing-o bokkum (hot squid stir-fry) or nak-ji bokkum (hot baby octopus stir-fry).  This along with the copious amounts of OB Lager (Korean beer) and Jinro Soju (Korean grain alcohol) makes for a good night!  And don't forget about the gristle that they cook after the prime cuts are finished, I think this may the be tastiest part of the whole place!"},{"name":"True Food Kitchen","address":"222 West Ave","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"Fresh, flavorful and delicious!\\n\\nI had the tuna tataki and the spicy panang curry.

As a tall, athletic guy the Earth bowl did not quite fill me up, but it surpassed so many other small lunches in Boston.  Go medium to heavy with the pesto vinaigrette, they don't put much on when it's 'light'  The brocolli isn't that spicy, but the quinoa, corn, chickpeas, broccoli, and chicken come together to form a nutritionally complete and satisfying bowl.  The Harvest bowl also sounded good, but I didn't have a chance to try it.  During lunch time the line will be to the door, and that will take about 10 minutes to get through.  Lastly, when you ask them to add more of an ingredient (because they skimp on the broccoli), they will charge you extra for it.

The ground meat of lamb was tender and seasoned to perfection with  herbs and spices. The raita was cool and spicy.

Cairo Cuisine Mediterranean Grill is located in the \\"Food Garden\\" of Northlake Mall.  The restaurant's menu includes gyro, kebabs, shawarma, falafel, and an Egyptian special of rice, macaroni and lentils.  I also observed grape leaves and hummus on display.  I was first sold by the sample of gyro that the restaurant was handing out.  Then, a fresh batch of chicken shawarma came out and I asked to try it too.  It was also very tasty. The staff are very friendly here.  My order took around 15-20 minutes to prepare, but everything was cooked fresh.  According to the server, there are specials on weekends.\\n\\nHighlights: I ordered the mixed grill, which consists of kofta (grilled ground meat with spices), chicken shish kebab, and gyro.  The gyro and kofta were spot on.  I got about 10 pieces of gyro, each juicy and extremely flavorful.  My kofta was also excellent - it had the perfect blend of seasoning and chopped herbs (parsley) mixed in.  The meats came with a side of salad, two sauces, a large helping of yellow rice, and a few pieces of pita bread.  My pita bread was nice and warm.  While a little thick, the sauces went along well with the meat.  Honestly, the gyro and kofta didn't need sauce.  The whole plate cost less than $12, which is a bargain for the amount and quality of food you get.  My sample of chicken shawarma was excellent - I will probably get an order of this the next time I go.\\n\\nCritiques: The chicken kebab could have been a little moister.  If you want chicken and are having trouble deciding between chicken shawarma and chicken shish kebab, at this point I'd go with the shawarma.\\n\\nOverall: Cairo Cuisine Mediterranean Grill is a standout in the Northlake Mall food court.  The restaurant can cook several meats extremely well and is very competitive with many of the Mediterranean sit-down restaurants in the area.  I highly recommend this place if you're looking for tasty, Mediterranean grilled meats at a reasonable price."},{"name":"Piazza Italia","address":"1129 NW Johnson St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"My wife and I went on a Wednesday night around 7 o'clock.

So here's the breakdown:\\n\\nLocation: \\nEasy to get to. Took the 39, walked a couple minutes and you're there.\\n\\nAtmosphere/Service: \\nBusy, thin restaurant.  Waitresses and waiters flying by, pretty friendly. They leave you alone for the most part when you get your food. I'm usually not picky about service as long as you're not rude. And it's busy so I don't mind. Food came out with good wait time, though I took one bite of my appetizer and the meal was put down a second later. \\n\\nFood: \\nWe ordered the Thit Lui, 2 marinated beef (or chicken) skewers, came with pickled veggies and peanuts (I don't remember seeing many peanuts on it..) but good flavor, burnt at the top though. I honestly tried cutting them with a fork and knife, I wasn't sure if I should use my hands, but the utensils couldn't get through the meat, so a little tough to rip off the skewers. I ordered the chicken peanut sauce dish, very good! came with broccoli, pea pods, and pineapple all smothered in the peanut sauce, thick consistency with a peanut butter taste. Maybe it doesn't look appealing with a pile of brown chunky sauce but don't let it distract you to how good it tastes! Not spicy though I believe it says it's supposed to be but I'm not complaining I cleaned the plate. Boyfriend ordered the Bangkok ribs, the sauce is to die for. I was dipping my peanut chicken in it the whole time to make it nice and spicy! It was a curry sauce with coconut and lime with a lot of flavor. He was a fan, it was everything he said his heart desired. The ribs themselves were a little tougher but were pork ribs, the sauce is what made them. Definitely a hands on dish, so get ready to ask for more napkins! The thai iced tea and thai bubble tea paired perfectly (cools your mouth down very well if eating something spicy).

The thing is, I want that food to be knock-your-socks-off amazing, or at least consistently decent.\\n\\nThe problem with Ceviche is that while there are some stellar dishes (holy crap, patatas bravas), they're few and far between. Most of your selections are over-sauced, heavy, and not that great. This wouldn't be so bad if it weren't so damn expensive, but I can walk across the street to Hamburger Mary's (or the Dessert Lady, if you've got an unquenchable sweet tooth) and have a full meal for the price of just one of the dishes here.\\n\\nTapas should be an excuse to spend lots of money on lots of dishes that taste great (Cafe Tu Tu Tango is really good for this, incidentally). It shouldn't be a crapshoot about whether I feel mildly satisfied or ripped off.\\n\\nFinally, I should mention the ambiance, which I don't think I've ever done for a restaurant before. The problem here is just so pervasive and constant, I need to bring it up. Ceviche has some great architecture, with beautiful tile, wood, and tables, but good lord, their acoustics are awful. Even if it's just half full, it's impossible to hear someone who's not directly next to you without shouting. If the place is slammed and you happen to enjoy conversation, well, you're in for a lot of grief - there's no way you're hearing anything less than a screaming match over that din.\\n\\nThis place has plenty of things going for it, but it could be so much more.

We ended up getting one of the barbecue combinations which, we discovered, consist of just meat and rice -- no veggies or anything. Maybe we should've ordered those extra, but the waitress wasn't exactly forthcoming about it.\\n\\nThe meat was half-cold and not all that great, which the exception of the pork, which would've been delicious if it were warm. Our waitress never came back. Instead, one guy cleared our plates and dropped off our check (never asking if we needed anything else), and another guy came to pick it up. We got the distinct feeling we were unwelcome. Sure, it was busy, but a lot of the staff were just hanging out and chatting in the back; we were close enough to the kitchen to be able to watch 'em. Our waitress never made eye contact or evinced any interest in us whatsoever. It was one of the rare opportunities that we didn't leave a tip.\\n\\nEven our fortunes were lame.\\n\\nMaybe we just went on an off night, or maybe our waitress was just in a crappy mood, but the whole experience spoiled any interest in going back there. \\"Din Ho\\" gets a definite thumbs down from us."},{"name":"Manna Korean Restaurant","address":"6808 N Lamar Blvd","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"Food was awesome, but service was questionable.

The food at Shigezo is good, but it's just good. Not great, not bad, but good.\\n\\nWe tried almost every vegetarian option on the menu, and we were happy with everything we had. We had two mushroom skewers; Shiitake and Portobello. These probably the most delicious items, actually. They were grilled perfectly, with enough salt taste it but not overwhelm the flavors of the mushrooms. Next we had the panko fried zucchini and mozzarella sticks. The panko breading makes them nice and light, and doesn't hold much of the oil they're fried in. While that's good, it does make them a little dry. The sauce they come with had oyster in it, so we had to skip that and we used soy sauce instead, which was very good. We also had agedashi tofu, which came with some fried mochi and fresh ginger on top of it.  This was also good. Next up was an omelet (I can't remember what it was called...one-something-yaki) which had cabbage in it, and the sauce tasted like A1 Sauce. It was an interesting mix of flavors, something I'd have to get again now that I know what to expect from it. The last thing I had was the panko fried quail eggs, and these were pretty good too. They were hard-boiled before being coated in the panko and fried, they have a texture that almost melts in your mouth. Delicious.\\n\\nThe service was good, attentive. They open the door for you when you come in and when you leave. My girlfriend thought that it was so nice it seemed like they were trying to hard, but I didn't get that vibe at all. They were very nice.\\n\\nOverall, the food was good, but there was some strange items on the menu. The omelet was a strange flavor, and some of the things we saw on the menu seemed like they were trying to play to American tastes. Maybe that's how they work in Japan, maybe not. I'll be going back, certainly, but I hope that they drop some of the strange Americanized Japanese items from their menu."},{"name":"Mission Sushi & Wok","address":"1625 Tremont St","city":"Boston","stars":"3","text":"I am always glad to have more options for food on Tremont.

What's sad is that I enjoyed the grilled bread with peanut sauce more. The Muu Paa Kham Waan (boar collar meat) was spicy and really salty and just wasn't for me. The extra charge for rice kind of sucked, especially when the coconut rice didn't really taste coconutty. The water smelled like coconut but tasted funny so I ended up with a cherry drinking vinegar that reminded me of kombucha. The coconut ice cream sandwich was interesting to say the least, but I wouldn't get it again.\\n\\nAll in all, the portions are on the smaller side for the price that is charged, and anything that says \\"family style\\" is a lie.

Not really a lot of good selection to me.  The fried rice and chicken were good.  The grilled fish and beef were okay.  My beef was burnt black from the grill.  The grilled fish didn't taste very fresh.  Kinda thin and squishy.  However, the fish from the sushi were very fresh.  Of the cold dishes, I liked the green seaweed salad the best.  The black seaweed salad with shitake mushroom was kinda salty to me.  The desserts were pretty good.  I tried all the cakes and liked pretty much all of them.  I wish they had more fruit selection like strawberries.  The green tea ice cream was okay.  It didn't have a lot of green tea taste in it.  It tasted almost like green vanilla ice cream. \\n\\nFor $25 per person for dinner buffet on weekends, it seems very reasonable.  Don't wait for those $1 sushi promotions.  Go to Nori Nori and eat all the sushi you'd like.  A ton of sushi to choose from.

We lucked out and parked right in front of the place. The challenge was I didn't realize that division st, is incredibly amazing and if you love food, like I do, this place is nirvana. I could spend a yr here and still not eat at all of the delicious places I saw. \\nDue to not being picky my husband and I where immediately sat. We ended up at the bar. The menu is very descriptive and I ordered 2 plates. The first plate I couldn't get enough of it, neither could my husband. We ended up cleaning it and left wanting more. It was the vermicelli noodles, with pork belly and giant prawns. The second plate we picked at it and left almost all of it. I even asked the bartender/my waiter are you sure this is what I ordered... It was rice noodles, in what turned out to be coconut milk, ginger, lemon grass. The menu stated it had dried shrimp. It tasted more like a dessert, however it also contained some type of hot pepper. I bit into one and immediately turned bright red and started coughing. I ordered the Bloody Mary and I switched my drink with my husband. I didn't like the after taste. He isn't picky and downed it but said it wasn't his drink of choice. \\n\\nEvidently the challenge was that we had not been prepared to order to make sure we ordered correctly. We did tell the bartender that it was our first time and what would be recommended. His response was ok, everything is good.  This wasn't helpful, it also wasn't helpful that my phone died and I could turn to my fellow yelpers for help. I think that my experience is more a 3.5 yrs, defintely not 4. I also felt overwhelmed with the tastes, rice is not part of the meal and I was cleaning my palate with water, not the best option.  I left this place hungry however, this turned out to be a plus. We sampled other places nearby. \\n\\nIf I had been better prepared or, had someone to guide us better our experience would have been different.

It gets crazy busy here and reservations can be hard to make on short notice, so usually our plan is to get there within the first hour of dinner service and aim for a seat at the bar. Bar seating is run independently of regular table seating and on a first come first serve basis, so if you want a seat at the bar bypass the hostess and let the bartender know. We lucked out over the weekend and were seated within 15 minutes.\\n\\nWhen we go we usually get a dozen assorted oysters (served with fresh mignonette, cocktail sauce, lemons, and a caddy of hot sauces) plus a few small dishes to share and some wine or cocktails from their well-rounded drink selection. Local oysters is the way to go! This time we had island creeks, wellfleets, and chathams. Their namesake oyster is still my favorite out of the bunch, always fresh, juicy and delicately briny. I've never ordered any of their entr√©es. Though their lobster roe pasta has always looked very VERY appetizing, I've never been hungry enough to order it on top of our selection from the raw bar. ICOB updates their smaller dishes (crudos, ceviches, apps, fried dishes, etc.) based on what's fresh and I've pretty much liked everything I've had here, but the crispy oyster sliders (brioche, lime chile aioli) and the salmon tartare (cucumber, sesame, lime) have been consistent favorites of ours. \\n\\nThe restaurant itself is beautiful and elegant with high ceilings and soft lighting. It's a bit loud for a date early on in the relationship, but definitely a nice special occasion or celebratory restaurant (for which a reservation is definitely recommended), or if you simply love seafood and don't mind a wait. Service can be a little on the slow side but the staff is friendly and knowledgeable.

The food was mediocre, not bad at all, but not great! The sushi selections are unique( the New Orleans roll was very good). There is a 15% gratuity automatically added to your bill when you sit at the Hibachi tables and they STILL charge extra if you DON'T want something. For example, I don't like onions or zucchini so in order for me to NOT have those in my meal there was a 2.25 charge per item. If I'm already paying 15% of my bill as a tip, I should be able to omit any veggies that I don't want. The service itself was typical, but nothing to rave about. Our waitress bought us drinks and refilled once. I am a FIRM believer in tipping if the service warranted it. Anyway, it's SUPER loud in there, the place was full of teenagers celebrating birthdays and screaming kids. I believe they broke the sound barrier every time a fire was lit.

It's fine for Austin, and far better than the mutated lumps at First Chinese, but the duck and roast pork don't move me. Tried them alone, in soups, and with rice. Just okay.\\n\\nStick to the main dishes because this is one the mid-to-upper-range Chinese places that actually turns the much-maligned, often-mocked sesame chicken dish into something good: crispy outside, restrained sauce that isn't cloying, and rarely any giant fat pieces. The scallops and shrimp in garlic sauce is a quite decent too. Their seafood lo mein is nice too--not salty or oily--though the artificial crab pieces are gross and strangely out of place since the other seafood is of good quality. The hot and sour soup is actually very good--and monstrously spicy, so be aware. I've ordered other dishes, but those tend to be on standard rotation.\\n\\nThe lack of MSG headache/jaw-numbing suggests they aren't using it. A major plus. Din Ho also has an extensive menu of Cantonese dishes (hot pots, chicken feet, etc) and sizzling plates though I've yet to try them because I've yet to dine-in.\\n\\nFor me, it's a take-out place: good, not great.

The menu is not overwhelming large but there are plenty of dishes that fit different dietary restrictions; certainly vegetarian- and vegan-friendly. \\n\\nRecommendations include the drunken noodles, spicy basil fried rice, and a personal favorite is the spicy eggplant with tofu. The eggplant is soft and the tofu is cooked just long enough to really soak up the slightly sweet, slightly spicy, slightly savory, very delicious sauce. This dish is served with rice, which is the perfect accompaniment to balance out the dish. \\n\\nDining in the restaurant is a pleasant experience with attentive servers that will fill your water glass all throughout your meal.

Glad to have service, we ordered some oysters and settled in with our drinks. \\n\\nUnfortunately, the waiter was still assigned to our table and had mishap after mishap. Taking our menus before we've placed our order (we had to ask for them back), bringing the bread but clearing our bread plates and silverware at the same time (we asked him for more silverware but he only brought bread knives back, so we had to ask again) etc etc. After multiple missteps, the manager came back and refilled my wine on the house and brought a complimentary app (which we didn't like and hadn't ordered on purpose, but we appreciated the gesture).

While the Tapas Tuesday's was a great deal (a list of both cold and hot tapas all for $4, and sangria was $4 a glass as well) I can't say I was impressed. We got the hummus, which was \\"meh.\\" The calamari was alright, but nothing special, I could get that at probably any chain seafood restaurant and it would taste the same. My boyfriend and I split a beef shortrib dish, which we were told would be enough for the both of us. Neither of us ended up being particularly hungry, but had we been it definitely would not have been big enough. I didn't like the dish at all, the beef was extremely fatty (I don't know if that's how it's supposed to be, but if so I was unaware of this and did not enjoy it at all) and despite asking if the roasted tomatoes came on top (to which I was told no) they came on top anyways, luckily they were easy enough to take off. The potatoes that it came with were alright, again nothing special what so ever.\\nThe service was good, but what I thought was a little odd was that nearly ever server had a trainee with them. While training in restaurants is obviously necessary, I found it odd that they had so many people training at the same time. An issue with turn-over maybe? I don't know, but as someone who's been working as a server for over 4 1/2 years it was definitely a weird thing to notice\\nI would come back again for the delicious sangria and the oh-so-good tres leches cake. I also have to say when I came for lunch I had some beef dish (that I could not find on the dinner menu) that was amazing. I'll be back, I mean we live right nearby, for the beautiful decor and the sangria alone and hope for a better experience next time."},{"name":"The Meatball Stoppe","address":"7325 Lake Underhill Rd","city":"Orlando","stars":"4.5","text":"Do you want meatballs straight out of New York and sauce as good as what you might get in Roma or Tuscany? The Meatball Stoppe is unbelievable. Start with the focaccia. It is firm and yet delicate and salted perfectly. The side salad seems normal  until you taste the Italian dressing she uses with the lettuce, onion tomatoes and corn. The dressing is so good and has a hint of sweetness that is picked up nicely when you eat the corn! The spicy pork sauce? Oh man to die for. I grew up in an  Italian neighborhood and it brought  me back to my friends kitchens where Italian moms slacked away all day over their sauces! I brought a container and served with some ravioli I got from whole foods and it was better than I could ever make and I cook!!! And finally the Meatballs. The meatballs were simply the best I have ever had. Can't describe them. Words will not do the meatballs justice. You just gotta try them!!"},{"name":"Nori Nori","address":"6690 Roswell Rd, Ste 2110","city":"Sandy Springs","stars":"3.5","text":"It was classified as Georgia best of the state in one of the food articles. In addition, one of my Yelp friend has visited this place several time. It must be good. I also see some of friends give low rating. As a result, we have researched and see when is the best visit. There are few tip for the visit. It need to be at the first hour of opening of the restaurant. Where all the food are presented nicely and at the best availability before it run out. \\n\\nThe buffet included the sushi, soup, cold salad, hot deli and the dessert. I give them the five stars for several reasons. \\n\\n1. The sushi are at the correct amount of rice. I saw some other buffet place has big piece of rice try to fill you up. Here is just right. The sushi also has the right ingredients with sophisticated mix of personality such as sweet dressing or hidden wasabi under the raw fish. Some even has the touch of chop ginger over it to give the twist of taste. This sushi is yummy. They have good spicy tuna and grilled mushrooms. All sushi were made so flavorful and do not need wasabi and soy sauce. \\n\\n2. Presentation of the food is gorgeous. The cold salad was well mix with different type of dressing. Some included the Ceviche. \\n\\n3. The udon noodle soup should not be miss. It has the fried shrimp, fish cake and more. The soup base is awesome. \\n\\n4. The dessert is home made. Not a typical pre-made items from grocery store. They have good dessert chef. \\n\\nWith that said. The service is great. I will be back again to enjoy the pig out. The lunch time is the most value with greater price. Don't go at their closing hour.

A friend was paying otherwise I would never have ate here. however the food here is awesome. this was my second time going and I love it. I had the Chicago rib which is a huge 2 inch thick bone in ribeye cooked to medium rare. The steak by itself was 55 bucks. It had a nice seer to it and was just slightly cooked a little longer then i would have liked. But i still devoured it. I also had a really great chefs salad and a new item they called the Tuna Tower. The Tuna Tower consisted of sashimi ( raw tuna ), pico de gallo, and avocado stacked in a cylinder shape. it was interesting, but tasty. The bacon wrapped scallops are also a must. The staff here are really helpfull and do a great job. they even go as far as to package the bone from my ribeye so i could take it home to my Shepard. parking sucks, but they offer a valet service that is well worth it. overall the food is amazing, however you do pay for it. when you get your bill you may want to have an AED handy. compared to other steak houses here in the valley this is the best Ive had."},{"name":"Life Alive","address":"765 Mass Ave","city":"Cambridge","stars":"4.5","text":"Life Alive, I love you...

Ever.  I went in here with two friends on a decently busy night.  My friend and I ordered sushi and my other friend ordered terriyaki.  After ordering, the waiter explained to us that this was a family-style restaurant and that our food may come out at staggered periods.  No big deal.  Having gone to a fair share of similar restaurants lately, I was expecting this.  \\n\\nMy sushi and the terriyaki came out within 15 minutes of each other.  Expecting to see the last dish make it to the table soon, we waited.  And waited, and waited, and waited.  An HOUR later, my friend's food arrived.  Now, I don't think it is too much to ask for three dishes to be delivered relatively at the same time.  Enough so that we could all enjoy the food TOGETHER at some point.  And if this couldn't be managed, maybe an apology from the waiter would have been nice.  Or acknowledgement of our existence at all, really!\\n\\nWhen we would look his way, he would look away and bustle off somewhere else. He flat out avoided us.  And when he did show up (only to deliver food), he didn't admit to any fault.  When we asked for a discount, he got defensive.  And when we asked to speak to the manager, he told us that the manager did not speak English, so we wouldn't get anywhere.  To be honest, I think he was trying to save his butt..  Well, to that we said \\"no tip\\" (and we ALWAYS tip), and walked out.\\n\\nIn short, we spent an hour and a half waiting for food.  Decent food, but not worth the wait or the neglect.

We chose this restaurant as I had heard great things about it, especially about the fried chicken with dill powder.  However, we were all underwhelmed by the dining experience.  The chicken was good, but not outstanding.  Two out of three of us could not eat the risotto as it was made with a particular funky cheese that gave it a very odd taste; we had expected much more both in size and taste for the $26 price tag.  The Cacio Pepe linguine was decent, eggplant was mediocre; however, the surprise of the evening was the beef collar which was very good.  Overall, the portions were VERY small, considering the prices which are on par (if not more, in the case of the pasta dishes) with full-size entrees at other restaurants.  The wine list was pricey, and did not offer more reasonably-priced choices.  The restaurant was full on the mid-week day we went and the service was good.
