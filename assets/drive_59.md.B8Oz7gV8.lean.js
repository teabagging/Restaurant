Ground zero for the Portland restaurant movement. If Thai Orchid or Thai Elephant or whatever serves the \\"top 40\\" boy band version of Thai food, Pok Pok serves the deep tracks of legendary classic rock. \\n\\nWhen you say to someone \\"we're going for Thai food,\\" they're probably imagining the ubiquitous pad thai. The green and red curries dotting the menu like Christmas decorations. All dialed into that American palette with a sickly sweetness.\\n\\nNot at Pok Pok. Unless you've been eating food from street vendors in Northern Thailand, most of this menu is probably little more than an incomprehensible list of Romanized Thai words with weird descriptions of \\"pork belly\\" and \\"duck leg\\" and... and... and... \\n\\nSo, what I'm saying is this: set your expectations aside for an evening and step up to some flavor, for once.\\n\\nTrue, Pok Pok empresario Andy Ricker is building a nationwide empire on his chicken wings. And you should order the chicken wings. They are sublime. Though if all you want are the wings, you can get them at the Whiskey Soda Lounge across the street and not have to wait 90 minutes for the privilege, or next time you're at PDX, grab them from the food cart before security.\\n\\nSo, maybe when you put your name in here for a table and they tell you it's going to be an hour and a half, you head to Whiskey Soda and order the wings for a preview of what's to come. That's a good strategy. \\n\\nBut then, when you finally get your table, look at the menu and pick some things that sound unusual. Even scary (there's nothing all that scary on this menu, but to the uninitiated it can be a bit intimidating). The Neua Nom Tok (spicy flank steak) is crazy delicious. The Khao Soi (curry noodle soup) is completely out of control. The Kaeng Hang Leh (sweet pork belly) will, in all likelihood, blow your mind. And that's just scratching the surface.\\n\\nThe surprising and delightful flavors just keep coming. And, yes, it's a long wait. And yes, it's got all of the hype that Portland has to give.

My experience was a mixed one.\\n\\nFirst of all, our server was excellent and introduced us to the menu. This is family style Thai with little shareable plates so some background info helps everyone get something they will enjoy.\\n\\nThe true stand out was the half chicken specialty with two flavorful sauces both of which complemented the wonderfully cooked meat. Skin was seasoned to perfection and crispy. I would visit again likely for this plate.\\n\\nCatfish and noodle dish was nice. Fish morsels (only four small pieces) were succulent, delicate and wonderful. The noodles were an appropriate vessel for the goodies. Herbs unusual to almost Thai did help to elevate the dish. I do not remember ever finding dill in a Thai dish before! What I missed was a true, authentic level of spice and aroma. A little on the bland side.\\n\\nThe third dish was also noodles. Dried fish, sausage, mussels, fish sauce. That sounds like a LOT of fish flavor and I was hoping for some aggressive heat spice, citrus, or something to balance the dish. Unfortunately it was mostly one note and without another real level.\\n\\nAll in all the meal felt like it was focused on appealing to the masses. It was tasty cooking but I found it a bit safe for my liking.\\n\\nThe price tag was also a downside. I don't mind paying for great, exciting food.

My gf ordered the lobster roe noodles, which is a must get at ICOB. I wasn't feeling seafood and got the Colorado angus burger. Going to a seafood restaurant to get a burger? BIG MISTAKE.

The oysters were fresh and I enjoyed it with the bottle of red wine we ordered (can't remember what it was..)  The BBQ on the other hand was definitely a let down.

I rather head to hole in the wall place for a full plate of GOOD bbq. \\n\\nThen we proceeded to porterhouse for two.  We ordered medium rare and it was cooked as requested.  It was cooked perfectly outside and inside.  It was just slightly too salty and I kept reaching for my drink towards the end.  But I definitely did enjoy the steak.\\n\\nI must say the side was the best part of my experience. (Other than my date of course)  We ordered jalapeno creamed corn from reading reviews on Yelp and it was dead on.  It was sweet and creamy.  The scalloped sweet potato was a nono.

It was not very busy. I sensed our waiter was new or not properly trained, which is fine, but he clearly did not have a good support system in place.\\n\\nWe met our waiter and he brought us waters right away but then we were abandoned for a solid 20 minutes. He did finally come by and he helped us navigate through our beer choices, which was helpful. We also ordered appetizers at the same time. We were once again abandoned by our waiter, and the food runner came with our food about 25 minutes later. I asked her about the drinks, and if she could find out what happened with them. Our waiter came by after 5ish minutes and I asked him about the drinks.\\n\\nA few minutes later he returned with the drinks - two draft beers in plastic cups - and I asked for the check right away.\\n\\nWhen he came back with the check, the manager walked over and asked us if everything was alright and if our waiter was treating us right. The fellow was standing right there. I wasn't going to humiliate the guy and say to his boss in front of him that he wasn't doing a very good job. Our waiter was nice to us and the other customers around us, and I wasn't so upset that I was going take our server down in front of an audience. I just wanted to pay for our unappetizing food and leave.  I said he was nice and that we wanted to leave.\\n\\nI'd chalk this one up to a failure of management or training. They may have been understaffed or with less experienced people working that night, so I would have expected to see the manager running food and drinks or help with orders. Management should not asking customers to comment on their employees right in front of them. It's a horrible thing to do to a server and puts pressure on people who would otherwise be discreet or polite with their comments.\\n\\nIt was not a busy night, but that doesn't mean we should have wasted an hour with only one round of drinks we had to repeatedly ask for.

One chef, one busboy, and a hostess/waitress. The chef seemed overwhelmed and kept looking around like he was forgetting things. At one point, he forgot to stir the noodles while they were boiling in the pot and they clumped together. He threw some of the large clumps out, but still served some clumpy pasta...he looked disorganized and I see how this restaurant can be inconsistent. I felt bad for the guy...he seemed overwhelmed and his elbow was hurting.\\n\\nAglio Olio- Home made squid ink pasta with ground squid and garlic.

I know, I know people don't like their breakfast places to be busy, but that's really not the fault of the restaurant. Yes, they hire hipsters as waitstaff, but it's on Belmont - I mean, you know what you're getting on that front, and frankly, they were pretty good the morning we went. Also, we went at 8am to beat the lines - I know, I know, but if you want to be seated promptly, that's the secret.\\nSo the deal is you get to cook your own pancakes, which is somehow a lot more fun in a restaurant than at home, perhaps because of the whole communal griddle thing. I can't comment on the cocktails or the made-to-order food, but the pancake batter is good, and the toppings we had we great - it's pretty reasonably priced too.\\n\\nPS. The decor - I loved the art - all squarely in the the pancake or cocktail theme, and the interior design? It's not that I don't like the whole exposed-beams-and-hvac look - it was very edgy a few years ago, and still looks good.

You always see western chefs take Asian cuisines and turn it into vanilla, boring fusions. You never see western chefs immerse themselves and simply try to honour Asian cuisines as they are. What Pok Pok claims to be is right up my alley.\\n\\nThe primary thing, for me, that made my Pok Pok experience special was the environment. The restaurant itself has a bunch of different sections that seem like they were tacked on as the restaurant needed to get bigger to accommodate more guests. The front area is an outside patio. There is an inside bar area with modest furniture and a small/cramp bar, playing classic-sounding Thai music (this is where I sat). I also saw there was an upstairs section, although I didn't actually get to check it out. The vibe of the place is casual and humble, and it felt like I was no longer in the states. It was very pleasant.\\n\\nThe flavours at Pok Pok were fairly unfamiliar to me. We ordered 1) the wings, 2) duck salad, 3) pork belly/shoulder curry, 4) coconut milk corn, and 5) the OG chicken, along with sides of jasmine and sticky rice. I found the wings to be too salty.. they were *really* salty, but the combination of spices on it was still very interesting to me, so I enjoyed them. The duck salad was also interesting - they had this subtle crunchiness to it that I couldn't figure out where it was coming from, and the cilantro-y herbal-ness was strong. I couldn't quite taste duck, but I still enjoyed it, and I thought it went really well with the sticky rice. Curry was very good. The corn was also good - I'm a big fan of charred corn + creamy sauces, so yeah. Caution tho: the corn was insanely expensive ($5/cob).

Usually a wonderful brunch is worth the wait, hopefully.  The idea of a classy, \\nupscale-ish brunch is an interesting idea and I think it can be done excellently.  Unfortunately, Moonshine has not hit that mark. \\n\\nThe space is too small to accommodate a line of 30-40 people smack dab in the entrance of the restaurant.

I also got food poisoning last weekend and drank chicken broth all week so my taste buds were like DYING for a foodie adventure.\\n\\nWe get there and.. well, first impression, no one greets guests at the front desk but the staff are running around like they are choreographing a royal wedding and there are like 5 people in the restaurant so already I am worried Bistro thinks its too cool to be great... 10 minutes later the front desk sends us to the host desk upstairs.  Right away we get a window seat, which is a nice view of Boston Common.  Things are improving.\\n\\nMy sweetie ordered bottled water since he's going in for surgery later and he can't drink wine.  I thought the bottled water in an ice bucket was a classy touch until the other servers started dumping extra tap water in there.  Weird. Then one of them poured tap water in his glass of bottled water and dumped the rest in our ice bucket.  Weirder still.  I ordered a cocktail, the Pentaque, which is a lavender and citrus-infused white tequila (ma fav) with triple sec (I substituted Cointreau) and fresh lemon and lime juice.  Love, love, LOVE the Pentaque so I had deux!!! :)\\n\\nThe waiter mentioned souffle dessert and 20 minutes and I know what I like so I said, \\"Grand Marnier, please!\\"  My sweetie ordered the chocolate souffle.  Now on to appetizers, I wanted the tuna tartare, sweetie wanted the same.  Boring!  So I let the waiter convince me on the salted cod special ($30).  It was not what I nor the waiter expected (comic moment!) as it was a cod puree mixed in buttery mashed potatoes.  Why it was served with burnt bread slices was beyond me since I don't think of mashed potatoes as a bread spread like butter or creamy cheeses or olive tapenade.  Oh my, please let our entrees be good! \\n\\nFor dinner, my sweetie ordered pan roasted cod with chickpeas, pimentos, golden raisins and chorizo.  He also ordered a side of pan fried mushrooms. He said the cod was rather bland but he really liked the mushrooms.  I ordered coral-infused chitarra pasta with Maine lobster, sea beans and lobster jus.  My pasta was delicious but the lobster pieces were skimpy so I added a few pan friend mushrooms on top.  That took ma pasta from good to great.\\n\\nFinally, dessert!  My Grand Marnier was good but I think the cream sauce that went with the chocolate souffle was better than the Grand Marnier syrup I got.  Sadly, my sweetie's chocolate souffle hadn't finished cooking as the center was pure liquid.  The server tried to convince him it was molten in the center but it looked more like a dollop of chocolate pudding floating in brown water.  He wouldn't eat it and since the server didn't remove it from our bill I asked him if he would.\\n\\nTotal bill with 20% tip was $200.  Would go back for the Pentaque but that's it.

The coffee came and damn they have good coffee (worth moving my star up to two). The food.... good.\\n\\nFIRST VISIT: Their pancakes are pretty on point! And cheese eggs and bacon are good too. The entire meal tasted like it was made right out of a country farm house. Hot, good, real, full of love! The wait for things was pretty long but OK. Tried to give it a second shot due to the homey food and country charm service.\\n\\nSECOND VISIT: The second time we came I ordered a skillet and was highly disappointed. The second visit is why we won't come back. The potatoes were chunks of potatoes, not what you would normally think of like shaved hash browns, or home fries? They were just like someone took a knife and butchered the poor thing and they were friend with some weird tasting oil. You could barley taste \\"potato\\" due to the strong oil flavor. The other toppings, not so great either and barely any cheese. They brought out a plate of gravy that went with it but it didn't make it any better. My husband ordered simple bacon and eggs and was disappointed too. \\n\\nThe wait time of our second visit was ridiculous. The entire time we were there from the moment we sat down to when we left was about 2 1/2 hours!! We are patient people and could tell the staff was a little frustrated but they didn't seem that busy. Maybe in the smoking section they were? And other people came in about 30 minutes after us and had already received their meal. Maybe they give extra TLC to the frequent elderly flyers? \\n\\nReally wanted them to work because I rather give my money to local restaurants vs. chains and eat something new and different vs. your typically breakfast at the chains."},{"name":"Steel Toad Brewpub & Dining Hall","address":"97 E 2nd Avenue","city":"Vancouver","stars":"3","text":"First and last time for us.

For lunch I ordered the quinoa salad, and was very disappointed ... there was more lettuce and cheese than quinoa. For dinner I usually get one of their fish meals which are good. Prices are a bit high, but if you split an entree with someone and order a side, it's enough food for 2 and pretty affordable. Overall the service at the bar is good, but not in the dining room. Every time I've eaten there it's been pretty slow. We've had the wrong meal sent to our table, no one showing up to ask if everything is ok, and/or timing was off (we ordered oysters as an appetizer and as soon as they came out, so did the rest of the meal which made it awkward and crowded on the table.)

I'd give this place a 4 star rating based just on food.  The black pasta was interesting and the lobster fra diavolo was flavorful and rich.  The lobster was definitely overcooked, way too tough and chewy, but the pasta in the sauce was terrific.  The calamari salad had a generous amount of the fresh calamari.  The calamari meatballs were ok, tastes exactly like it sounds.\\n\\nThis is a tiny place that seats about 20 people, with only 3 employees: a cook, a waiter, and a busboy.  It seems that there's always a line of people outside, and we waited about 40-45 minutes to be seated.  However, there was a party of 10 that was seated without waiting at all because they were friends with the cook.  There was even a party of 3 that had to share their 4th seat with this large group of the cook's friends.  Imagine having to wait a long time to get seated in this tiny place, only to have half of the restaurant be put on hold for the cook's own friends/family, and then having to be pissed off for 45-60 minutes while waiting for them to finish their meal.

She says she just received the message.  I found that hard to believe, that as the owner she received a message that her restaurant overcharged a customer $8000 2 days after the message was left.  STRIKE 1 customer service/  making excuses for delaying resolving a problem.  She assured me that the charge would be reversed by WED 10/23 and gave me her personal cell number in case it was not.  I responded that I wanted  a receipt of the credit and that I would pick it up that same day around noon.  She said that was fine.\\n\\nI showed up at COM around 1:00pm that day, Nicole had gone home.  No receipt was left for me, no message was left for me.  The workers tried to tell me that the other manager was on the phone with the credit company right at that moment.  It all seemed very chaotic and that no one really knew what to tell me.  Obviously correcting this gross overcharge was not a priority for them.  STRIKE 2 customer service - owner, knowing I was coming by at noon to pick up a receipt documenting the credit, never bothered to let me they were experiencing delays processing the credit.  Wasted trip and time for me + increasing aggravation.  They told me to come back later that evening for the receipt.\\n\\nI returned to COM that evening around 6pm.  Surprisingly the other manager was in.  He tried to give me a copy of the original receipt from the Oct. 11 meal.  Really?  Why would I want that - I have that receipt?  I want a copy (proof) that you have credited me back the $7,964.55 that you \\"erroneously\\" charged me.  He says that's not the way it works, no receipt is generated by the credit processor... but really there is no reason to worry and that the credit will show up on my bill by Wed.  If not, be sure to call his wife/ the owner on her cell phone\\n\\nWell you can probably guess the end to this review/ story.  The credit to my AMEX didn't appear by Wed., nor did it appear on Thur.  On Thurs ( I gave them a 1 day grace period ;) I called  Nicole's cell and ,as expected, had to leave a message.  Today is SUN 10/27 - 16 days after the overcharge, 4 days after the credit was supposed to appear on my AMEX, and 3 days after I left Nicole a voice mail.  She has NOT returned my call.  STRIKE 3 - This has really been some of the worst customer service I have ever experienced!  Time to write a YELP review letting other customers know about this absurd situation.\\n\\nAs of this review there is still NO credit for the overcharge.

Wife went the usual with Beef Chiladas with Ancho Sauce across the top. Very good flavor. We both enjoyed the mexican style brown rice, unique flavor for sure. Verde Chiladas for me with a tangy tomatillo Sauce. Its Dark green in color, and definitely has a tangy taste that was new to me, but pairs well with the glob of sour cream that comes on the side. The beans were creamy goodness with a bit of cheese on top. Only thing that cost a star...was overall value.

I had read lots of glowing blog reviews and I'd also seen the restaurant featured on TV, so I was incredibly eager to try it. \\n\\nWe decided to go around lunchtime so that we wouldn't have to wait forever during the dinner rush. We still had to sit for a few minutes while they prepared a patio table for us. Not a problem. \\n\\nWe each got a Thai iced tea - it was fine, but not as good as the tea we'd had at Khao San the night before. And the tea at Khao San wound up being free and we got bottomless refills. Pok Pok's is, what, $4 a glass? Eeek.\\n\\nEveryone always says \\"Get the wings!\\" at Pok Pok, so of course I ordered them. We asked the waitress if they were spicy and she said they were \\"medium heat,\\" so we didn't ask for any modifications to the order. Ooof. \\"Medium spice\\" is still QUITE spicy ... they were tasty, I guess, but the heat was just too much. It made it hard to enjoy them because we were dealing with such heat. My husband was still complaining about his mouth being on fire an hour after we'd left the restaurant, and he's not hyper-sensitive to spicy foods. Plus, we only got four wings for nearly $15, and one wing was abnormally small. Not worth it. \\n\\nWe also decided to order a second dish alongside the wings. I waffled for a while between the Muu Paa Kham Waan (charcoal-grilled boar collar meat) and the Khanom Jiin Sao Naam (rice vermicelli topped with fresh pineapple, ginger, green mango, dry shrimp, and a sweet/sour dressing with coconut cream). My husband left it up to me and I settled on the latter since I really wanted a noodle dish. Mistake. It was served cold, which I wasn't expecting otherwise I wouldn't have ordered it - I was expecting a hot noodle dish. It wasn't very tasty and we didn't finish it.\\n\\nDespite all this, I still wanted to try the \\"Pok Pok Affogato\\" dessert that I'd read about online. The waitress came over to ask about dessert and I requested it without even looking at the menu. The dessert consists of condensed milk ice cream drowned in a shot of Vietnamese coffee served with patangko, which are fried Thai-style savory crullers. It came out quickly and the waitress poured the coffee over the ice cream out of a cute mini pitcher. It was really tasty and it saved the meal from being a *complete* bust. \\n\\nThe service was fine and the outdoor patio was comfortable. Street parking was not an issue that day, but I think we just got lucky. \\n\\nFinal bill, including tip, was $54. (For reference, the meal we had at the other Thai place the night before totaled $32.)\\n\\nTrust me, I am FAR from an expert on Thai cuisine. I have no idea if Pok Pok's food didn't resonate with me because it was truly not very good, or because everything else I've experienced has been a watered-down version for clueless Americans and The Real Thing is simply not my cup of (overpriced) tea.

It is intimate enough to be able to have a conversation & the food is always always perfection, but everyone falls in love with Arnold's infectious personality & that is something they end up remembering even after the meal is over. This is our favorite go to place for great meals, not just seafood either. Our daughters when home from college on visits have loved the steaks as well & said that they are fantastic. Please try this neighborhood Gem but go for the meal to be the event of the evening & not in a hurry for a quick rushed meal.

I commented to him on how I liked the coffee mug, which he thought was odd to bring up, but I find part of the experience of sipping a fine coffee is the instrument in which it is consumed. The Lineage Coffee mug was comfortable, weighted well, and had a nice thumb rest. It is rare that I get to just enjoy my coffee, slowly and with intent.

Obviously, I can't speak to how the Japanese stores are run, but I am willing to bet that they would be embarrassed to see the daily operation of the Portland store.\\n\\nIn August, I came here for a Sunday Happy Hour dinner. My boyfriend and I tried a variety of dishes. I remember walking away overall disappointed. The only two dishes we truly enjoyed were Ebi Mayo (battered, deep fried shrimp served with a Japanese Mayo, on top of a bed of iceberg lettuce) and the Kara-Age (battered, deep fried chicken). We were unimpressed with the rest of the tapas, and downright grossed out by the sushi. The fish just didn't seem fresh.\\n\\nNow, I am no sushi elitist. I love a pure, fresh, properly cut fish. However, I've also had my fair share of cream cheese-filled maki rolls. Yesterday, I was dining alone, so I saddled up to the sushi bar. This gave me an inadvertent peek \\"behind the scenes\\" of Shigezo, and I wasn't impressed by what I saw.\\n\\nFirst of all, what I ordered: Okonomiyaki w/o pork, Abu-Ramen, the Honey-Black Vinegar Chu, and the sesame ball dessert (forget the name). None of my food was truly bad, per se, but absolutely none of it made me want to come back. At the end of my meal, I was glad I tried the Abu-Ramen, since I'd heard so much about it, but I really wished I would have just gotten the Ebi-Mayo and a drink. The squid in the Okonomiyaki was awfully tough and difficult to chew through. Also, in other Okonomiyaki I've had, even though there is always a lot going on, the flavors somehow meld into something pleasant. Here, a lot of different flavors and textures were competing for attention, and it was overwhelming. Not a fan of their rendition of this dish. The Abu-Ramen started out super tasty. However, toward the bottom of the bowl, everything was swimming in this oily sauce that made it impossible to finish the dish. So much oiliness! I'm not sure if that's how it should be, this was my first brothless ramen experience.\\n\\nThe vinegar Chu was good. Definitely tasted like vinegar, but that IS what I ordered... I think next time I should as what food it would pair well with.\\n\\nThe sesame ball dessert was good -- it came with a scoop of green tea ice cream and this random slice of a fried root veggie. Something vaguely potato-like. I've had better sesame balls, most notably from Jade.\\n\\nWhat really bothered me about this place was how inefficient the sushi station is. During my one solo dinner, I witnessed at least 6 parties cancel their orders because they were taking too long. I also saw a server argue with the table behind me about what they ordered. Seriously, he pulled out his little book and read back what he wrote down. WHO CARES WHO IS WRONG? Either way, he ended up taking the incorrect order back and getting them what they wanted. Was it worth it to argue?\\n\\nEven the guy who sat next to me at the bar, who only had one order of Tobiko, never got his sushi. The waiter didn't even realize it and had to fix his check after it was pointed out. Basically, communication between the sushi bar and the waitstaff is poor, the waitstaff don't check on customers' sushi dishes, and the sushi bar is super inefficient. Also, the way they handle the raw fish just didn't seem right. Again, I know next to nothing about the art of making sushi, but I do know that you probably shouldn't just throw scraps of salmon on top of the rest of the fish. I know that you should handle the fish with care, instead of tossing it around.\\n\\nThis, combined with my previous experience of hating their sushi, makes me think that Shigezo needs to completely rehaul their sushi program. If they can't do that, they would be better off just getting rid of it altogether.\\n\\nOn a positive note, my server (who was not the same server for the guy next to me) was friendly and made sure I got all my food. The only thing that was lacking was that my water wasn't refilled.\\n\\nAfter 2 tries, I really wanted to find some redeeming qualities in Shigezo. And, as long as you completely stay away from their sushi bar offerings, it's really not that bad there. Still, there are way too many fantastic restaurants in Portland that I want to check out, for me to waste a 3rd visit on Shigezo."},{"name":"Din Ho Chinese BBQ","address":"8557 Research Blvd, Ste 116","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"This is more of a 3 1/2.

Don't let the somewhat cheesy name fool you, the proprietors are really Greek, as is the food. As of now, the focus is on sandwiches and breakfast, but I overheard the owner saying that they were planning on expanding the menu if business goes well. I had the traditional gyro with a side of fries and spanakopita. The gyro is excellent. The meat is tasty and 0% greasy, a which is a problem that plagues many local gyro joints. The tzatziki is perfectly tangy with the proper herb undertones, and the pita was hearty, warm and didn't have a single crack. The fries are fresh cut every morning and are really, REALLY excellent. They're somewhere between a standard fry and a steak fry in size and doneness, and you really shouldn't miss them if you come here. The spanokopita was also on point, albeit a little dry.\\n\\nAlso, for what it's worth, a friend who dined with me, who, as a kid, had a best friend who was Greek, said that the food compared favorably with his friend's grandma's cooking!\\n\\nOh, and the owner is ridiculously nice, and gave me free cookies his mom baked at the end of the meal!"},{"name":"Seoul Doogbaegi","address":"1031 Kingsway","city":"Vancouver","stars":"3.5","text":"After reading the reviews, I came prepared for potentially mediocre Korean with a side of very bad service. The comments about the service is absolutely warranted. There's only two people working the front end and they're not around very often. Took us awhile after being seated to get someone to put our order in. The food took equally long. I'm used to most Korean places giving us the side dishes and rice first to start, but here they brought it out with the food we ordered.\\n\\n- the kalbi was delicious. It was also pretty cheap for 3 slabs. Wish it was a little saucier but that's a personal preference.\\n\\n- the assorted tofu soup with beef was good. One complaint is why is there a mussel in it? That really put too much seafood flavor into the dish and I would have preferred they didn't putnit in at all. Next time I go I'll ask for them to not put that in there.\\n\\n- the fish cake, rice cake, etc potato noodle soup dish (last item on the entire menu) was delicious! We thought it'd be a dry noodle dish but it came on the portable gas burner. It was so good. If you like Shin instant noodles, it's the same exact soup base flavor. We're wimps so we ordered it mild which was more than enough for us. \\n\\nTheir side dishes were amazing. My two favorites were the radishes and potatoes. They were so well marinated. The best Korean side dishes I've had in years.\\n\\nThere's a few dishes I miss from other places like the blood sausage (not in soup) and a few others. But this place is definitely great food wise sparing us a trip downtown or to Richmond. \\n\\nI'd happily come back for the food. The reason this isn't 5 stars is due to the service.

This is a small diner-type italian restaurant that serves big portion with fair prices. The thing is, I'm not even a fan of Italian food (don't kill me please) or pasta, but I *really* do like this place. The atmosphere is cozy, lazy, and snoozy.... but you'll be right awake when the food arrives! \\n\\nWe ordered the special beet and goat cheese salad, sauteed calamari, and the chicken marsala pasta. Service was relatively quick. The salad came with beets mixed with romaine lettuce topped generously with goat cheese and tossed with balsamic dressing. It was a solid, delicious salad, with just the right amount of dressing, although I wish they had been more generous with the beets instead of the goat cheese. \\n\\nThe sauteed calamari, to my delightful surprise, had a bold flavor that I didn't expect. It was the spiciest sauteed calamari that I've had --- spicy as in not just peppery-hot, but also packed with a variety of spices that blended together to create a strongly fragrant yet not overwhelming calamari dish. I will definitely order it again. \\n\\nThe chicken marsala pasta dish was also unlike any pasta I've had before. For started, I'd recommend getting the wheat radiotore like we did (see pic). It was the first time I've had radiotore pasta, and supposedly they resemble little curled-up radiators. (cute!) The texture and taste was rather unique: the grainy sweetness of wheat combined with the thickness and porousness of the pasta created a wonderful palatal sensation. Although I must say that the chicken was above average but not amazing (but better than I expected, since I have little faith in chicken in restaurants in general), and the sauce with mushrooms was very good, except there was not much of it. (Or maybe it's because the radiotore soaked up more sauce than usual?)\\n\\nOverall, this is definitely a place I would go again to try out other menu items. At fair prices and such hearty portions, coupled with gourmet-quality taste, hell, who wouldn't order a big pasta for lunch and heat up the rest for dinner while watching Law and Order SVU? I know I would."},{"name":"Pok Pok","address":"3226 SE Division St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"I came here prepared to dismiss it as over-hyped.

If you wanted your drink, it seemed the only way to get it was to ask about it 20 minutes after ordering it- that's if you can find the server. We didn't get out of here until after 11:30. Ridiculous. You would think for the quality of the food, and how nice the place is (and also for the prices), that the service would be equally as great.

I ordered the Croque Madame which I was very happy with, an overall RICH and HEARTY portion of ham, cheese and fried eggs.\\n\\nTo cap off the meal, we did some espressos which were OK and the Gianduja with salted caramel ice cream that was LIGHT and perfectly satisfying for the sweet tooth finish.

There is a sad (very sad) little thai place right across the street from them, strangely, that always seems to be empty. But I digress. Longish wait, like 30 minutes on a weeknight, then our hilariously dressed hostess shuttled us into the world's smallest dining room, where the tables are so close together your butt cheeks brush the backs of the people sitting next to you as you try to sit down. I wish it wasn't such a sardine packed situation in there, it was a bit claustrophobic and dim. \\n\\nAs many reviewers say, their table water is swanky and flavored with coconut and magic, I thought it tasted great and sort of creamy, everyone at my table agreed it was nice. We got a few dishes but my favorite by far was the yellow curry, it was really delicious. They bring out a little spice tray so you can season to your liking, I made mine spicy as heck and poured it all over my wonderful coconut rice and was in Americanized Thai food bliss. The waitress got our rice order wrong two times but no big deal. The prices are pretty normal for a semi fancy dinner place, quite reasonable at like $10-$12 a head for our meal. The rice is ordered separately and was around $4 which I thought was a bit outrageous, but they must have a high overhead. They need to support their hostess' extreme-vintage-Norwegian-50s-couture shopping addiction somehow I suppose.

I started going there since they are only a short walk from my home and I keep returning because they have consistently provided good food, friendly and efficient service, and affordable prices.\\n\\nThe menu is composed of a wide variety of primarily Vietnamese and Thai food.  Whenever I go there with my girlfriend, we begin with an assortment of appetizers:  crispy egg rolls ($3.95), fried dumplings ($4.95), and two orders of spicy rangoon ($4.95 each).  The spicy rangoon are her favorite and are probably the best \\"crab rangoon\\" / \\"cheese boats\\" / \\"Peking ravioli\\" (whatever you know them as) that I've had.  We then usually split either a medium or large bowl of pho for the entree.  Tonight we had the Dac Biet (rare steak, well done flank, and tendon and tripe) ($6.95).  We found it to be quite good, but the broth is sweeter than that of other pho restaurants.  In my opinion, the sweetness does not detract from the flavor. \\n\\nThe best thing about Pho Basil is how affordable it is when you take into account the quality and quantity of food you get for your money.  I eat out frequently and enjoy having a good meal that doesn't make me flinch when they drop the check.  The entire meal for two cost less than $30.00 (not including gratuity).

It was good but, didn't wow me and I felt it was really a 3 star item.  I felt like I was eating a bowl of pasta sauce and the starch they used (potatoes) didn't really mix well with the overall taste of the dish.  The grilled avocado was done well but, the poached eggs were over done.  I just didn't feel like this dish blended well or had the flavors that I was expecting.\\n\\nWe also ordered the fried potato cakes for the table to share.  The presentation on this plate was spectacular with all the different colors.  It was $9.00 and was served with creme fraiche and topped with salmon roe.  I really have to give this 1 star.

The flavor bombs were dynamic, with a punch of sourness, then a kick of spice, and bringing it together was an overwhelmingly good savory flavor. \\n\\nBe warned despite the spiciness of the chicken wings, it was probably the least spicy part of the menu we ordered from. Pok Pok doesn't back down, it continues to throw its punches at you with a diverse array of flavors, with one similarity, a spiciness that only the brave can handle.

The wait was really long, but they took our number and texted us when our table was ready which was awesome because we wanted to browse the stores around town anyways. \\n\\nOnce we finally sat down we ordered 3 batters between 6 people which was more than enough. I got the chocolate chips and everyone else got the delicious maple syrup to go with it. We also got their tasty turkey bacon, eggs and mimosas. We made hilarious shaped pancakes and had a ball! \\n\\nI highly recommend checking this place out in Portlandia, you won't regret it!"},{"name":"Keke's Breakfast Cafe","address":"4430 Curry Ford Rd","city":"Orlando","stars":"4.5","text":"As always great food, love the waffle with whipped cream and a bowl of fruit.

First of all, it is located in a sketchy neighborhood so you always have to keep your head up in the surroundings. During lunch time, there are a lot of students and professionals around, but at night time it is a different story around this area. My party of three didn't have to wait at all for a table. The service was okay, nothing outstanding. I found the lunch menu deals to be priced very reasonably, but the quality of food just changed my impression in an instant. Even being a budgeting college student, these cheap prices are not worth a revisit at all. \\n\\nFood was truly disappointing:\\n-2 roll sushi combo (shrimp tempura [$1 extra] & sweet potato roll): This combo comes with a side salad of a miso soup. I chose the side salad with sesame dressing. The dressing was fine, but some of the salad leaves were wilted. Kind of disgusted and I was not willing to sort through all of the leaves anymore. Each roll set comes with 6 pieces. The sushi was MEEH. There is so much rice on the outside that I was full after 4 pieces. The shrimp was dry and disappointing, definitely not worth the extra $1. The sweet potato roll also had too much rice on the outside. As a result of the extra amount of rice, the pieces were almost uncomfortable to eat within one bite. \\n-original pad thai: If you look at the yelp pictures of this pad thai, you will find that the noodles are white, not like a normal pad thai. The strange look coincides with the BLAND taste. It almost tasted like there was no flavor to it. WOULD NOT RECOMMEND! My friend had to drench it in siriacha to get some flavor and to make it edible. \\n-mission pad thai (w/ chicken): The pad thai noodles were a different color than the original pad thai. I wasn't able to try this dish, but I assume that it was equivalent with the other food. \\n\\nIf you are college student that is looking for food deals rather than the quality of food, I guess this is a place for you. But honestly in my opinion, it is not even worth your money. \\n\\nParking: There is no designated parking lot. There is street parking, but it seemed like it was sparse. The Brigham Circle T is very close by (green line E)."},{"name":"Moonshine Patio Bar & Grill","address":"303 Red River St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"Great food and a great bourbon menu.

I was shocked to see that they had a crab and artichoke ravioli with a lobster sauce for only $16 and took a gamble. It turned out to meet all of my criteria- super flavorful, enough sauce to mop up each ravioli, and just enough. I loved it. I also enjoyed a glass of very tastey Pinot Grigio that was a generous size.

I really REALLY wanted to love this place. I am a vegan so I was ready to support this restaurant. The vibe we got from our waitress Jackie was extremely cold and snobby. My husband ordered the hibiscus tea and i had water since they don't have decaf coffee. When i asked if they had decaf she gave me a very curt \\"no\\". The hibiscus tea my husband ordered was VERY bitter. I could tell it was brewed really strong which is alright w/ me but not for most people. He told Jackie that it was really bitter and asked if he could have something different like the Lavender Lemonade. She said \\"well i'll have to still charge you and if i don't charge you it's coming out of my paycheck\\". SERIOUSLY!! That statement wouldn't even have been so bad had she not said it so rudely. We spoke very politely to her the whole time even after she was so rude. So there was no reason for her to have that attitude. We just said ok, we'll stick w/ water then. I have never been to a restaurant and been told that! I mean come on, how hard is it to make your customer happy by just simply saying \\"i'm sorry you didn't like it, let me get you something else.\\" Especially when you pay $2.50 for a tea and it's not good. I seriously doubt that that is even true, but if it is, the owner of the establishment should re-consider their policy because that's not fair to the staff and it makes the customer service awful. Anyway, moving on. I really wanted to try the Jackfruit BBQ but they were all out of GF bread, which I understand is not their fault, apparently the lady they buy from had a kitchen fire. But with all the local and non-local GF bread available you might think they could get a back-up option just in case. O-well. I had the GF cashew mac n cheese. It was very good. The sides I chose were the quinoa raisen salad and potato salad. The potato salad was good but I did not care for the quinoa salad, kind of bland for me.

Other than the food I ate in Thailand, this is the most authentic and the best Thai food I tried in the States.

All of them are tasted exactly how I dream Thai food.  Yes...I dream Thai food...and NOW, Pok Pok is in it... \\n\\nBBQ Chicken:  They had the chicken cooking outside over the coals.  Every once in awhile I would get a whiff and sound of chicken sizzling on the coal.  Coal + Meat = Heaven.  It was simply divine.  Perfectly cooked and juicy.  Coal crisped skin with tender moist meat.  Just dissolved in my mouth\\n\\nThai Beef Salad: Fireworks of flavors and sensory overload in a very good way.    Perfect balance and combination of herbs and vegetables used in this salad.  Texture and flavor is perfectly matched.  This dish symbolized the coup against the Americanized Thai food.\\n\\nPork Belly Curry: Now this dish definitely lies in the adventurous eater's category.  This curry was nothing like the curry we usually see in a regular Thai restaurant.  This was thick sauced, deep flavored and meaty.  The depth of the flavor was simple amazing.  Chunks of delicious pork fat.  mmmmm.....\\n\\nI don't usually care about the restaurant I care about the food it serves.  Therefore, atmosphere and the layout of the place doesn't really matter to me as long as there is a chair and a table to eat at.

This was the Muu Paa Kham Waan, or for those of us with an atrocious grasp of foreign languages, the Boar Collar. I've asked for it hot both times, but based on my experiences with other Thai places, they definitely dial it back a touch for us White People. I found the taste pleasant, but the meat itself terribly stringy and chewy for what it's supposed to be. Perhaps this can just be chalked up to the fact that boar isn't exactly a common ingredient in the Portland area.\\n\\nOther dishes have been the Papaya Pok Pok (Vegan style,) Yam Makheua Yao (grilled eggplant,) and Phak Kad Jaw (pork ribs.)

I didn't see anything that was very different from what is typically offered as tapas. However, the one that really shined was the yucca-stuffed shrimp wrapped in bacon. And of course, you're thinking that \\"Duh, anything wrapped in bacon is delicious!\\" And you're not wrong. But the combination of flavors here, with the yucca and bacon and tangy ginger sauce was a combination I hadn't tried previously and now would gladly go back from more.\\n\\nAnother happily surprising feature is the tablet used to keep track of your orders. When you're ready to pay, they hand you the tablet and you can calculate it out however you wish; split the dishes between a certain number of people, or have some people pay for some dishes and others for the rest, or just to split it between cash and credit cards. You can calculate the tip with it as well to make sure everything is covered. I thought it was a convenient way to deal with what can be a difficult problem, especially with groups."},{"name":"Pok Pok","address":"3226 SE Division St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"OMG yummm, I cannot get enough of this place.

If you ever get a chance to be there a night they are serving a whole fried Tilapia make sure you order it too, it was delish!  They have really good drinking vinegars which I cannot decide which one I like most and make a killer thai tea.   I of course bring my kids, although there is no kids menu, but it's fine, they have high chairs and my children love the food also.

I regularly stop by to buy the whole beans to grind and brew at home. Summermoon does a phenomenal job at roasting their beans making them my favorite coffee hands down. As far as the actual coffee shop it is clean and very inviting. I have taken my computer there and worked while sipping on coffee. There are some outlets (not as many as Starbucks, but enough). My favorite drink is the half moon latte and half winter moon (cold version of the half moon latte). They sweeten it with their \\"moon milk\\" which is an in house secret recipe coffee sweetener. I love the way the moon milk tastes but it is rather sweet...that's why I prefer the half moon latte instead of the summermoon latte. It has half of the moon milk sweetener than the summermoon latte contains.

Going in hungry is not a great idea, as you will be waiting a while. Thursday nights can be particularly crowded as there is live music starting at 8pm til close.\\n\\nSome of my favorite dishes are: Swami, Adventurer, Green Goddess, Carrot Cake Smoothie, Coconut Alive Smoothie and Elivs Alive Smoothie.\\n\\nIf you are going for your first time, I highly suggest The Adventurer. Feel free to ask for substitutions if there is any one ingredient you do not like or want added. They are more than willing to flex to make you happy.\\n\\nLife Alive is a must if you're passing through the Cambridge Central Square area.

The first time I heard about this place I checked the menu but then clicked off after seeing no veg*n options in the first fifteen or so items I scrolled through.  Tonight my wife wanted to see if they maybe had at least one thing we could order, so I had another look, and found the veg section.  The site does list the categories at the top, with \\"Vegetarian\\" being one of the them; I don't know if that's a new addition to the site, or if I just overlooked it because of the big, colorful pictures of the food that got me scrolling immediately.  And about that, the pictures are a real plus: most menus are words only; it's great to be able to see what your order will look like.\\n\\nFOOD:  Not overcooked like lots of Chinese food.  The preparation seemed original rather than generic.  The fact that the tofu was cut into triangles instead of squares isn't mind-blowing, but it's indicative of the fact that they're trying to do things differently, in every way possible.\\n\\nPRICING:  Delivery is free and they have a \\"no-tipping\\" policy, promising on their site that it's not necessary because they pay competitive wages.  So what might look like slightly higher prices really aren't, when you factor in the free delivery and no tips.\\n\\nDELIVERY:  Came in a reasonable amount of time, and I got a text message when the driver was on the way plus another one when the driver arrived.  Really nice touch.\\n\\nPACKAGING:  The containers are plastic, which are much easier to recycle than styrofoam.  The rice containers were labeled \\"S\\" for steamed and \\"B\\" for brown, but the two eggplant tofu dishes weren't marked, which was a problem because one was spicy and one wasn't.

We ended up going for Valentine's Day. My boyfriend and I went around 7:50 (our reservation said 8) were sat promptly by the lovely hostess, but then didn't see our first dish until 8:45. From then on it was downhill. Quick disclaimer, the food was INCREDIBLE. The quality of fish was absolutely fantastic, but for how much it costs, the quantities were laughable. We ordered two orders of special nigiri, the yellowtail appetizer, the #8 roll (smoked salmon and eel) and the Chilean sea bass entree. The waiter took so long to put in one of the special nigiris that it sold out and we never got it. There were no comps and barely any apologies. Again, the food was incredible but the quantities and service ruined the whole experience. Do not come here hungry. Eat appetizers before, even maybe a small meal, unless you want to spend tons of money. \\nI realize it was Valentine's Day and restaurants are busier than usual, but good god the service was absolute crap. The server was nice enough, but obviously forgot about us several times. He offered next to no recommendations and showed little to no interest in our table until it came time for the check, when he had us cashed out in less than 3 minutes.

They are impervious to haste or attitude thrown their way. Marching to their own drum is too tame, it's the whole orchestra. \\nTheir walnut salad comes complete with amazing dressing, greens, apples, and of all things cashews.

She said \\"They were such assholes!\\" Are you kidding me?! Really lady, this is how you treat costumers in front of other costumers? The waiter seemed to struggle with staying on top of things- as I noticed a man stand up and ask for his check 3 times.. and he never once asked us how our food was... or if we needed anything else.

We were told by friends about this great place and while spending the weekend in Portland, made sure to go. They do not take reservations, but we were there on a summer Friday night and, after taking our number to text us, we just grabbed a drink across the street and were seated in about 1/2 hour. Love the ambiance - fun, lively, good music, everyone happy to be there. And the food - oh the food! Our server was amazing -- we had some suggestions from our friends for what to order, but she was really helpful in fleshing that out. She made sure we didn't have too many dishes on our table at the same time, letting us enjoy everything slowly. Of course we had to order the fish sauce wings - and they are delicious - the perfect marriage of flavors! The catfish salad was just spicy enough - I am somewhat more of a spice wimp than the husband, but I have to say this wonderful dish got it exactly right! The chicken curry was incredibly flavorful and left me wanting more. As for the Papaya Pok Pok - a bit too spicy for me, but the husband loved it. Add some grilled corn, shrimp chips, and sticky rice on the side and we were in foodie heaven :-)!

It delivers what it promises (and little else), but the squid ink pasta on their calamari-driven menu is out of this world. House made, it's likely the best these lips have ever tasted. With serious chew, mellow squid ink flavor and thick, slurpy noodles, I get it every time I go...which is often. You get three choices to dress your black linguine: a tangy puttanesca, a rich alfredo (that I think needs extra cheese, which I always sprinkle on top), or their signature aglio oilo--a chopped squid and garlic olive oil sauce. You can't go wrong with any of the three.\\n\\nThe rest of the menu is good, but perhaps not as great. They have native seafood of all sorts like shrimp and scallops, mussels in wine, baked haddock, quirky sides like squid meatballs, and you can order any of these over pasta with your choice of red or white sauce. Groups often opt for the lobster fra diavlo for $70; I haven't tried it yet, but it looks like a seafood lover's dream. Skip the salads as they are unimpressive, but hope there might be a side of garlic broccoli on the menu when you go.\\n\\nWith a couple locations across Boston, the small joint in the North End is the best by far.

The BBQ entrees are served with many side dishes including kimchi, mini sardines, bean curd, radish, bean sprouts and a few more and they're all excellent.  It also comes with large pieces of lettuce for you to wrap your meat in or you can have it with rice.

My personal favorite is the Sea Cow (specifically for those who likes interesting and complex \\"sweet\\" flavors), although they have been smaller than the usual size recently.\\n\\nThe fried oyster sliders are so yummy! Fried to perfection with buttery buns...don't let the size fool you! You may already be stuffed after having 2 of them! \\n\\nAlso, for the non-alcoholics: they have mocktails! Yay! I got their house soda (pineapple juice and homemade orgeat), which is refreshingly delicious. Of course they are a bit pricey, but it's worth treating yourself to if you feel like it.\\n\\nThe interior decoration of the restaurant was beautifully crafted and unique. Walls full of oyster shells and structured in an upscale and modern style? Hell yes! (although I did feel slightly underdressed in a white t shirt and dark blue skinny jeans for the setting) \\n\\nI knocked off a star only because of the location (on the busy Commonwealth Ave?? C'MON!!). Parking will be really hard to find unless it's around a certain hour (or luck). They have valet parking that you can pay for, but definitely stick with taking the T if you are on a budget.

For weeks on end sometimes. So, as you may imagine, I take my oysters very seriously.\\n\\nIsland Creek didn't disappoint. They have a lovely selection of oysters to satisfy all taste buds and the waitress was very knowledgeable about all of them. I ended up ordering Shigoku, Blue Pool and one other west coast kind that I can't remember (which, I know, is a sin in of itself). They were all delicious--so much so that I ordered another round before my main course. I could eat dozens if you just keep putting them in front of me...\\n\\nFor the rest of the experience...\\n\\nAtmosphere: Very open, modern, very cool oyster shell walls (awesome texture) with the option to sit either at the bar, at a small table or at a huuuuge table in the middle of the room. They were setting up for a party of 30 (!!) when my boyfriend and I went in. It's hard to find a restaurant in Boston that can fit a party of 30 while still keeping enough room to serve a full dinner crowd. \\n\\nPeople: All very nice, professional and helpful without the slightest bit of arrogance. Quite wonderful. \\n\\nFood: We had oysters, a salad, fish and chips and the tuna. The bread was good...I was actually more of a fan of the honey-cayenne butter. Mmmmmmm. Oysters, as previously discussed, were delicious. The salad (iceberg, bacon something--who can argue with bacon?) was good. Fish and chips were just generic, according to the boyfriend. Good, but nothing outstanding. The fries (from what I stole) were pretty tasty though. My tuna was quite good...well prepared and had a good flavor. I was actually more of a fan of the black rice and ginger-something sauce than the tuna itself. I would have licked the plate if there had been more black rice. Don't get me wrong, the tuna wasn't bad...it just didn't have that wow factor I was hoping for. It was a surprisingly big piece of tuna, though, so bonus points for not shortchanging on the portion sizes!\\n\\nWe, unfortunately, were too full to partake in the desserts...but that might be our loss. They looked AMAZING. Plus, Island Creek has hot toddies. Love. \\n\\nOverall, great place for oysters.

For entrees, we ordered the Diver Scallops and Grouper.  I would definitely recommend the Buerre Blanc sauce for a very rich, amazing meal.  For dessert, I had their chocolate cake which was very decadent and very worth the calories.  It's a more solid version of a lava cake.  All in all, we can't wait to go back.

It is the only asian restaurant in the Back Bay that I've gone to more than once. In fact I've probably eaten in or ordered take-out at least once a month since I discovered the place about a year ago.\\n\\nThe menu offers a wide range of Thai and Vietnamese dishes, with some items seemingly more Americanized than others. As far as I can tell the Vietnamese dishes are pretty authentic, but regardless, every dish I've ever had from here has been delicious. The dishes are always well spiced, the veggies are cooked but not obliterated to mush, the fried flat rice noodles are smokey and chewy in the best way, and nothing has ever been particularly oily or goopy (see bad pork lo mein or sesame chicken respectively, although you can't actually order either here). I particularly like that when they say a dish is spicy, or when you ask to make it extra spicy, they really follow through, which I guess is a warning to some diners and a bit of encouragement to others.\\n\\n\\nSome personal favorites my GF and I get all the time:\\n\\nKua Gai Noodle - Stir-fried flat rice noodle with chicken, bean sprouts, scallions, egg, ground peanuts, lettuce, crispy fried diced onions, and cilantro. The lettuce sounds weird but honestly is amazing. It lightens the whole dish up and adds some great texture. This a good choice if spicy is not your thing. If spicy is your thing, be sure to at least steal a bite from your scoville-shy date who orders this while you go for one of the dishes below.\\n\\nDrunken Noodle - Stir-fried flat rice noodles with mixed vegetables and egg in spicy basil sauce with your choice of meat/tofu. I get it with the tofu and it works great since the tofu really soaks up the delicious and rather spicy basil sauce.\\n\\nWild Board Basil - Pork sauteed with pepper, mushroom, eggplant, string bean, green peppercorn, pepper and basil leaves in white wine chili sauce. This is a dish that I've only ever seen at Pho Basil and is a must try if you like spice and pork. It's incredible. Ask them to make it extra spicy and you will be in nose-running, eye-watering, juicy pork heaven.\\n\\nAnything with basil sauce... really, anything. Crispy chicken basil, spicy tofu eggplant in basil sauce, spicy basil w/meat or tofu, etc. You get the idea.\\n\\nAnything with lemongrass grilled chicken, especially the Bun Thit Nuong. The vietnamese dishes that offer a pile of veggies, rice or noodles, vinegary fish sauce, and lemongrass chicken are very light and refreshing and the chicken is grilled perfectly. Dump that questionably odiferous but oh-so-delicious fish sauce over your entire plate and enjoy.\\n\\nBack to prices. For $8-10 bucks you can easily walk away with tonight's dinner and tomorrow's lunch in tow as the portion sizes are generous. If you sit in to eat you seem to get a bit more food, but if you take it to go you can get away with a smaller tip and more efficient dinner run. You decide what you value more.\\n\\nLastly, the Thai iced tea is divine. Not for diabetics or lactase deficient individuals, but I swear that thing is the tastiest caffeine and calorie delivery method known to man."},{"name":"One Bistro","address":"1125 Boston Providence Tpike","city":"Norwood","stars":"4","text":"One Bistro is one of my favorite places to go!

Gekko is my baseline, and this place may give my tried and true a run for its money. My friend suggested this place, so I came along for the ride because I could honestly eat sushi every single day - except Sunday (Don't do it! You have been warned). \\n\\nShe mentioned that the sushi was half off until dinner, which was great since I was counting my coins as we headed to the over rated area that is Buckhead. Upon further investigation, they have half off sushi every day (Yes all 7 days) so long as you dine in for dinner. WINNING!! (Do people still say that?). They also have a $12 lunch buffet during the week and a $14.00 brunch buffet on the weekend.\\n\\nI had already consumed a few cocktails at our previous stop, so I chose to guzzle water and forgo any more libations for the evening. They do offer more than just sushi, and from their website one can tell that they REALLY want you to try to venture out and allow your taste buds to explore more than just tempura and sushi. \\n\\nI only remember what I ordered, but no one complained that they didn't enjoy their food. I had the miso soup (I deducted a star because neither my friend nor myself had 1 piece of tofu in our soup). I also ordered the buckhead roll and a spicy salmon roll.

It's the little things that go a long way to make a difference to set yourself apart from other places constantly pounding out roll after roll.

The menu is clean and simple, seafood is the highlight, yet there are also dishes to satisfy almost any craving.  Wine list is spectacular.   Of course oysters are a must and the menu changes often.  We had a variety and each were fresh and succulent and satisfying. The fish and chips were perfect. Oil was ultra fresh. Presentation was modern. The hot sauces that they offer are made in a small batches somewhere in Massachusetts - I found them to be excellent and very very spicy. The East coast halibut w Marfax beans, chorizo, jalape√±o was meaty, beautifully presented, perfectly prepared. Exceptional tender Hanger steak w crispy fingerling potatoes, creamed spinach, and a red wine jus.

Since their prices are the same as other retail stores the reason you should come here is the massive variety of books.  They have so many more books than other stores.

If that's not your bag(if you prefer thinner crust or cakier crust) then you might not dig the pizza. I like a chewy crust, myself. Moving on. They've got high quality toppings. One of the only places with good ricotta and giant slices of peppers. They always put their basil under the cheese(so it doesn't burn) and they never skimp on anything. Use their website to order and you'll be presented with a *ton* of customization options for almost every item.\\n\\nExample? I like the crispy chicken wrap with light honey mustard, lettuce, extra pickles and tomato. None of that needs to be written in special instructions. You can just select it from drop down menus. This is one of the only restaurants where I usually forego grubhub and use their website.\\n\\nOne more thing: The medium double deal(15.99 for two medium three topping pizzas) is one of the great deals of the area-- for quality/price ratio on delivery it's hard to beat.

The pizza is solid, although the crust is a bit too chewy for me.  They have well thought out topping combos to choose from and the leftovers keep pretty well.  The fried cauliflower appetizer was probably the highlight of our meal.  One of the best small plates I've had in recent memory.  Just enough crunch and plenty of sauce (aioli?, I honestly don't remember).  The lighting is suitably low for a date spot, but its a comfortable neighborhood restaurant that you could come to for almost any occasion."},{"name":"Counter Culture","address":"2337 E Cesar Chavez St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"I'll start with a caveat here that I am not vegan or even vegetarian.  However, I can appreciate it because in my mind, they have to get creative with the meal in terms of spices, seasoning, preparation to get some interesting flavors and tastes.  I have had some excellent vegan and vegetarian food before.  So anyway, this review is for all those non-vegans out there interested in trying this place out.\\n\\nI went to this place with high hopes because of the glorious reviews by people here on Yelp.  However, I was disappointed.  I really wanted to like this place, but the food was just not that good.  It seems that there is a strong and loyal following for this place on Yelp, and I am just puzzled how so many people think this place is so great.\\n\\nLike I said, I really wanted to like this place.  I got three sandwiches so that I could try a little bit of everything.  I got the Jackfruit BBQ, Garbonzo \\"Tuna\\", and the Philly Seitan.  I also got the Pac Man salad.  The best sandwich out of the group was the Garbonzo, the worst was the Jackfruit BBQ.  The bread was good, kind of soft and squishy and whole wheat.  But I really didn't care too much for the \\"fillers\\".  The Jackfruit BBQ was mushy and bland with a hint of BBQ sauce.  Kind of felt like I was eating a burrito instead of a sandwich.  The Philly Seitan was also bland and didn't have a lot of flavor, although it had some onions and bell peppers in it.  The Garbonzo was decent, and it actually kind of tasted like Tuna.  I would get that sandwich again.  I would say the best thing was the Pac Man salad.\\n\\nI will give them that each sandwich was made with care and they really tried.  I could tell that the guy making the sandwiches was meticulously constructing each sandwich.  I just think that they need to work a little more on the flavors and maybe the preparation.  On the Seitan or Jackfruit, perhaps if they made it a little crisp on the outside to give it a little texture (or add some crunchier things like cucumber or something like that), and work on giving it a little more flavor, it could be much better.  All in my opinion of course."},{"name":"Zed's","address":"501 Canyon Ridge Dr","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"This is a fantastic spot. Definitely a five in my book. It only had one miss.\\n\\nI waited in my truck before lunch for my friends to arrive. It was a smallish parking close to the restaurant and a larger one nearby as part off JC Penny's. When I was much younger I worked at a restaurant. The manager was adamant that workers parked at the end of the lot so the customers could get close. I admired that. The manager here needs a lesson. While waiting, half a dozen folks parked and went in to work, in a small lot so many of the workers parked up front that it looked packed. Not only an inconvenience for customers, but could lose some if they thought it was full.\\n\\nOh well, once inside it was a fabulous restaurant. The style was spot on. The wait staff was impeccable - not too aloof, there when needed, and not a single miss. I had the chicken cashew salad for lunch and it was divine.

It is unfortunate that Piazza Italia has too followed the same path. While their food is better than most Italian casual cafes in the area... their service is absolutely terrible. I've had poor service before but chucked it up to a bad day or ??? But once agin, it was simply awful. We should have left but since it was a holiday and many spots I had preferred to have gone to were  closed, we were stuck. It wasn't 30 seconds after we sat down that we were asked for our order.. they didn't bother to offer their specials or ask if we'd like a drink.. they just turned and walked away when we informed them we had just sat down. Less than three minutes later they came back and then were we able to order a drink... along with clear disgust that we weren't ready place our meal order. The drinks took quite awhile and in between we were asked if we were ready to order. I finally had to ask them to let us be for a bit then we would order.. of course once we were ready they were uninterested. In our time there we overheard two other discussions on poor service and handling of guests concerns. \\nAs an Italian myself and having traveled to Italia I am familiar with Italian customs and attitudes... this experience was nothing close to true Italian customs. Often guests need to ask for assistance to speed up their visit... not this place, they want you out of there as quickly as possible. \\nRather unfortunate, if you ask me.

The food and service were both good, however, we had issue with the manner in which the wine list is presented.  While there are copious options of reds and whites, and the prices are stated for full bottles, there are no prices printed should one choose to enjoy an individual glass of wine.  We asked the prices when the whites were verbally delivered, and we were quoted from $7.50-$8.00 for approximately five or more options.  Another asked about the reds, and again, multiple options were recited rapidly from numerous Italian vineyards and varietals.  While my husband studied Italian in college, none of us are fluent, so when numerous unfamiliar wines were \\"rattled off\\" in a foreign language, it flew over our heads.  Between the four of us, we purchased 5 individual glasses of three different types of wine.\\n\\nOur individual glasses of wine appeared, and the serving size was very generous.  The problem came when the bill arrived, and the cost of the glasses were in excess of 62% more than what we were lead to believe the price.  When this was brought up the server said that many of the reds cost more than the whites he listed.  Note that he must have rattled off at least 10-12 wines, very rapidly, and in Italian.  He said that he had told us that several of the reds were more costly.  All four of us did not recall his stating that.  He went back to the register and begrudgingly refunded some of the difference.  This conflict thwarted our feeling about the establishment.\\n\\nNote to future diners.  If you do consume a meal at this establishment, and you purchase a full bottle of wine, where the prices are stated on the menu, things should be fine.  To avoid a surprise when purchasing individual glasses, be sure and ask specifically what each glass actually costs.  It was disconcerting to expect a price of $8, and then to be \\"hit\\" with $13 each when receiving the bill.  While such an action may not phase many diners, it really ruined our dining experience that evening.  We felt we were being duped.  When an establishment regularly serves wines by the glass, it would be helpful to put the price on the menu, so the patron does not have to interrupt the server's recitation each time to ask the price.  Our group felt the food deserved 3/5 stars, but the disagreement over the wine really soured us to the eatery.  \\n\\nThis was our first time returning to Piazza in over five years, when then I discovered a mistake by the waitress (we were then overbilled also) and I quietly pointed that out.  She threw a fit, in Italian, because it was merely over a few dollars.  I want to support our local businesses, and do not regularly find problems when dining out, but I feel their integrity of an establishment is just as important as their food.

We ordered three tacos on corn tortillas, a Brush Fire, a Baja Shrimp, and a Crossroads along with extra Diablo sauce and some green chile queso.\\n\\nThe highlight, the green chile queso. It had decent flavor was hot and we both liked the chunks of avocado in it, but I ordered queso as a side not my meal.\\n\\nAll three tacos were good sized but were overpriced, had very little flavor and the tortillas had a tendency to fall apart by the end. The Baja Shrimp was probably the best of the three - far from exceptional. On the Brush Fire, I'm not 100% certain if they understand that jerk chicken should be spicy... I'm not sure why they call the sauce \\"Diablo\\"; it has almost no heat (at least, try hitting something like the Freebird's \\"Death\\" sauce). On the Crossroads, the brisket was crunchy, not sure what's up with that.\\n\\nFinally, we both noticed the poor selection of music while we were eating.

This place is somewhat of an establishment in Cambridge.  They made a relatively recent move to a new location a few blocks down the street to a bigger place because the old place couldn't handle the crowds.  In general, I'd say this place is a good brunch place, but I have a hard time stomaching the more than hour-long wait times during the school year in Boston.\\n\\nI came here with a friend on a rainy, weekend morning during the summer.  I'd walked by several times before and seen crowds of people waiting for brunch.  I'd also come by before and been told there was a 90 minute wait--ridiculous!  I think because of the weather or the time of day on this particular occasion we lucked out and were promptly seated within 15 minutes!\\n\\nThe space isn't anything to note really.  It's a pretty standard restaurant although in warmer weather they have outdoor seating and can open up the sides of the building, which makes for a nice atmosphere.  The service was friendly and prompt, and in general, expected.  We ordered coffees to start; they have a pretty expansive list of different specialty coffees and different flavorings.  The food menu is equally broad, but we ultimately settled on the black bean burger eggs Benedict and the avocado toast.  They have a ton of unique combinations of foods and flavors, so we had a hard time choosing something.  I will say that it seems a little expensive for the product; things seemed a little more expensive than nearby restaurants.\\n\\nIn general, we had a great experience here.  We were both happy with the food and drinks, and I'd be curious to try some of the other items.  I don't think it's necessarily worth the hype or the wait, but if you can manage to grab a table on a slow morning/afternoon, it's a great place to grab brunch."},{"name":"Powell's City of Books","address":"1005 W Burnside St","city":"Portland","stars":"5","text":"Walking in is like going down the literary rabbit hole.

The noodles were made with a sweet soy sauce, and the curry was perfectly flavored. \\n\\nThe service was great as well. It was prompt, the food came out quickly, our water glasses were never empty and when we had to motor so I could make my train, our leftovers were boxed up quickly and courteously.

Lasagna and non-Persian staples such as Hummus, Greek-style Dolmas, and curry rice (not saffron) are offered along with Koobideh skewers and plain Basmanti rice.  The dishes are hit and miss; the Pita bread is probably the worst I've had at any like restaurant.  Maybe they should order from down the street at the Hummus Stop.  In fact, why not serve Lavash which is more traditional and probably more interesting to customers.  The Sumac at the table was a nice touch, Persian tea was good, and overall service was very good.\\n\\nPortland is not Los Angeles, a.k.a.

We ordered the entree size of aglio olio, plus three appetizers (calamari, mussels, shrimp scampi). A perfect amount of food for three, as well as a reasonable price sitting around $60. \\n\\nAnd of course, it was all delicious, fresh, and made right in front of us-- the kitchen is in the same room as the dining area.\\n\\nMany reviewers have not enjoyed the service here, but we found our waiter to be quick and polite, if a little brusque.

Get the lemonade. \\n\\nAnd if you want to be sure to get that lemonade you should make a reservation, because this place is pretty tiny--almost like you are eating in a Tunisian/Algerian dining room which I totally dug. I especially felt at home when only half of our tables dishes were brought out and you could hear the wife yelling at the husband in the kitchen ha ha It really made me wish I spoke the same language so I knew what she was saying!  \\n\\nBut this tiny restaurant makes some pretty tasty food. It isn't cheap, but I think it is worth it for the unique foods and flavors and cooking styles they offer, and the wife who is the only server for the whole place is hilarious. We started with 4 appetizers/tapas and the Merguez spicy lamb sausage definitely won that battle. A close second was this chickpea custard that just was so fun to eat. We also got their eggplant that was so smokey it almost tasted like their was bacon in it, but there wasn't. Magical, I tell you. And we got their dates served with a special cheese too. Then the main dishes came and my special salmon cooked in a clay tagine made by the \\"delicious hands\\" of the cook (her husband and yes that is how she described him, and no it was not one of those times you think a phrase is lost in translation, I think she really did mean he was delicious!) which was awesome, the boys got the cous cous brochette which had some steak on one skewer that the boys were almost literally drooling over, and Anna B. got the chicken special with some pesto flavoring and more olives than  you could even get in a jar at Costco it seemed. The woman even called us out for not eating enough  olives, so of course we got a tuperware from her and took them home. We wouldn't want to disappoint her and get yelled at like her husband!

Went yesterday around 5 with two other people. We all ordered margaritas, when they came our server spilled a fair amount of mine on the table in front of me, which I understand happens, no big deal, but then she just sort of said 'oops' and walked off. So I had half a margarita and everyone at the table had to unwrap their forks because she didn't even attempt to clean it up or offer us napkins.\\nThe chips were standard 'house made' tortilla chips. No complaints there but nothing special. \\nThe margaritas tasted alright but they were not worth $11, they were about 4oz tops. \\nWhen our food came it looked nice but weirdly cheap. The corn salad that came with each dish reminded me of cafeteria food that would be given out in an elementary school. Little canned corn nibblets with red and green bell peppers mixed in. \\nThe taco salad was standard but the shell it was in seemed like it had been premade and quickly refried before it was served. It tasted greasy and stale. I ordered a pork burrito without guacamole and received a beef burrito with guacamole. Another person at the table had ordered Barbacoa and we tasted and compared and mine was absolutely beef. When I told the waitress she brought out another burrito quickly. But probably too quickly, it was barely heated through and the cheese wasn't melted. It was also beef again. I scraped off the guacamole for the second time and ate a quarter of it. At the end of the meal I mentioned that I thought my burrito was beef again. The waitress said she watched the cook make it then rushed back with two little bowls of meat 'this is pork, this is beef. Okay?' And walked off. They were identical and tasted the same. So either they were attempting to cover their mistake, or they just don't know how to cook meat correctly.

Still, i guess crunchiness can be excused if the taste is good. Ordered medium spice level but it wasn't spicy at all. I must have leveled up in my spice level (used to think Sriracha and mango habanero wings from wing stop was too spicy but that's changed) or just their scale is adjusted to be easier on the crowd...I've had fish sauce wings at multiple restaurants down in Orange County, California but so far, this is the best tasting (minus the crunch factor). Plus, included with wings are some pickled cabbage, radish, and carrots and some slices of cucumber. The papaya salad and rice pairs up nicely with the wings. Papaya salad is not as pungent, the smell isn't as strong and there's a bit of tang to it. Rice is good to complement and help ease the savory foods. They also have fish sauce packets but honestly, the flavors from the food is good and savory enough, no more sauce needed. \\n\\nFish sauce eaten alone without mixing any other flavors/spices/ingredients can be pungent/odorous/stinky/strong/penetrating/whatever/bleh bleh if you're not used to eating it but this place is doing something right to be able to attract this amount of customers who normally don't eat fish sauce."},{"name":"Boston Common Coffee Co.","address":"515 Washington St","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"The egg breakfast sandwich is a real fried egg, not the processed stuff.

The couple sitting next to us could not finish the salad.\\n\\nIke's Vietnamese Fish Sauce Wings: this was too overhyped. I found it to be way too salty! I think this was definitely created to be catered to non-Asian taste buds (very... Teriyaki-esque). Even though it's $15 for 6 wings, I did feel that the amount of meat on the wings were Generous.\\n\\nKaeng Hang Leh (Pork Belly & Pork Shoulder in Burmese Curry): this was definitely flavorful and the meat literally melted in your mouth! It was so incredibly tender, but ... It is an extremely fatty piece of meat. This tasted very much like a home cooked meal/ comfort food; however, I think 6 cube pieces of meat for $16 is a bit over priced. .\\n\\nSticky rice ($3)... Um this was annoying. I don't like rice, but the Kaeng Hang Leh was very rich so we felt that we needed something to soak it up... So we ordered the rice. The amount given was smaller than my palm!

It opened December 9, 2015 in Westside close to Atlantic Station and Georgia Tech. It's next door to the new Cook Out on a stretch of Northside Dr that includes longer standing fast food joints like Krystal, Burger King, and McDonald's.\\n\\nTo date, this is one of the nicest Chick-fil-A restaurants I've been to. It looks great, inside and out. The building has a double drive-thru. There's indoor and outdoor seating. The building is LEED-registered and has a large communal table that was built from materials from abandoned and unwanted homes. The dining room is slightly nicer than other Chick-fil-As I've been to. The walls have wood paneling and subway tile and the light fixtures are more creative (e.g. they're made out of baskets and glass bottles).\\n\\nIf dining in, orders are served to your table. Like other Chick-fil-As, servers will take away trays and trash and will offer to refill your drinks. I've found the service here to be on par with other Chick-fil-As which means great.\\n\\nThere's a conference room which you can reserve at http://bit.do/westmidtownconference. The conference room can hold up to 10 people. You can book time slots from 30 minutes to 2 hours. You can also order food in advance.

The restaurant has free Wi-Fi so I can see people coming here to work or study.\\n\\nI've visited on Saturday mornings for breakfast. On my first visit, I showed up just after 10:30am, the cutoff time for breakfast. One of the managers extended the breakfast cutoff time to around 10:45am, so that was nice of him. Each time I've been, the grounds have been clean and the dining room spotless.\\n\\nI like to order the chicken biscuit meal with hash browns ($4.45) and upgrade my drink to an iced coffee (+$0.70). I've also ordered a sausage breakfast burrito meal with hash browns ($4.69) and a regular coffee (small). The chicken biscuits I've had here have pretty much been perfect -- warm, soft, flaky, and buttery biscuits with large, tender, and tasty fried chicken fillets inside. The sausage breakfast burrito was good too. It was savory and filling with chunks of pork sausage, scrambled eggs, onions, green bell pepper, cheese, and salsa neatly and tightly wrapped in a flour tortilla.

But thankfully, what started out as a pretty bad first impression of this place ended up being turned around by truly extraordinary food. \\n\\nWe drove by here last Tuesday night and noticed that they had a huge outdoor patio area which was pretty much empty - we figured it would be a good night to stop by and try this place (new restaurants in Wakefield are a rare occurrence and it was a perfect summer night, so we were pretty excited!). When we went inside, the hostess asked us if we wanted to be seated indoors or outdoors. We eagerly said outdoors, noticing that there were at least a dozen open tables outside. Unfortunately, the manager (or whoever was in charge of outdoor seating) came by and said that she couldn't seat us outdoors tonight, since their only remaining 2 person table was reserved. Fair enough, but there were lots of open 4 person tables (and other parties of two had been seated at these tables) - so, we were a bit disappointed that we weren't allowed to sit at any of those, given how empty the patio looked overall (and since the large availability of outdoor seating was the main reason we stopped in).\\n\\nWe agreed to be seated indoors (but were a bit bummed by the whole ordeal), and were placed at one of the 2-person tables near the windows. Word to the wise - the indoor temperature, particularly in this area of the restaurant, was excruciatingly cold - I literally started shivering at one point. It was uncomfortable to the extent where it affected our ability to have a relaxing conversation and fully enjoy our evening. We didn't say anything to the waitress because it seemed like the rest of the restaurant wasn't nearly as cold (we were right beneath the AC), but I do hope that they find a way to get a more uniform temperature in this place going forward. \\n\\nPrices here are high, so be prepared to drop a good amount on dinner, especially if you're getting appetizers and drinks. The $4 price tag for a glass of coke seemed particularly inflated to me. \\n\\nGiven all of the above, the 4-star review here may seem puzzling, but here's what it came down to... this was one of the best meals I've had in a long time. I think part of me wanted to not like my food, so that I could easily write off this place as overpriced, disorganized, and overhyped.... but as soon as our food arrived, my entire tone changed. My husband (who can be difficult to please) said his roasted chicken with garlic sauce and potatoes was some of the best chicken he's had in his life. I ordered the scallops (which came with corn puree and succotash) and, while I wouldn't have minded an extra scallop or two for the price, it also was phenomenal. It was one of those meals where you don't even want to talk to the person you're there with (no offense, husband), you just want to focus on how delicious what you are eating is. \\n\\nI'd give this place 3.5 stars overall (rounding up to 4 because the food was just that good - and our service after the whole table ordeal was great as well). This place definitely things to work on, and the way they handled the whole indoor/outdoor seating thing really did frustrate me. But, I'll attribute that to \\"new business growing pains,\\" and will stop by again soon the next time I'm in need of a really good meal. I hope they'll have figured some of these out by then - and next time I plan to come here, I'll be sure to make a reservation for outdoor seating to be safe, and I'll be sure to bring an extra sweater just in case the indoors is feeling Arctic again."},{"name":"Pok Pok","address":"3226 SE Division St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Wings.

The first visit I remember thinking this as the best Thai food I've had but did not feel the same way upon the second visit. Don't get me wrong, the food is good but Portland has such a variety of high quality and diverse food options, my barometer most likely has changed since my first visit to Pok Pok and I won't recommend Pok Pok as the first choice for an out-of-towner to try.

Ordered some oysters. They were fresh but very salty, like some of the salted ice they were sitting on crept into them. Bread was tasty served with honey cayenne butter, the cayenne was a nice surprise. The bartender recommended the seafood pie, the seafood was tasteless, I couldn't tell the lobster from the shrimp. The sauce was underwhelming and the buttery topping was dry. The fried clams were OK not a sweet as I have had. Then we ordered the fried fish sandwich and an oyster BLT. Again, both were OK. The fish portion was very small and the roll was so large and buttery that it overwhelmed the fish. The french fries were by far the saltiest I have ever eaten. Cayenne, though a welcome surprise in the butter was used in a few of the dishes and was no longer a welcome surprise. A little cayenne goes a long way. The service was pretty good for the first 15 minutes. There seemed to be a lot more engaging industry people at the bar so we came in a distant second.

My daughter had the pan-seared sole which melted in your mouth. The sole came with flavorful jasmine rice and a tasty vegetable medley. Yes, the spiced chocolate torte is as good as they say. It was a busy night, but the food arrived on time, and the service was friendly.

Not so here.  They were very good.  The ceviche was not the best I've had in Austin but it was quite good.  The maduros were really, really good.  The croquetas were ok.  We did have mojitos and were upsold on the special Nicaraguan white rum.  I was fearing some $15 drink.  As it turned out, they were delicious and I had 3.  When the bill came, they were $7.50 each.  Quite a surprise!   I had the Ropa Vieja and it was the best dish on the table in my opinion.  My wife had the Lechon Asado and it was bland and fatty.  We think they forgot the sauce.  The kitchen was a wreck.  More on that in a bit.  Our friend got the Arroz con Pollo a la Cubana and it was good but not great.  Now, about the kitchen: We got the wrong quantities of our appetizers, they forgot the sauce on one dish, between appetizers and the entrees, it took about 45 minutes to an hour.

Long review because of the poor value for what it cost (bill came to $400+ for two). I made reservations in advance, but had to call later to see if it was ok to be a few minutes late (or move the reservation back). The guy on the phone replied it was ok to be a few minutes late, but we'd need to \\"sit down and order right away\\". With that tone I'd expect the service and food to be perfect, and maybe served to me on gold plates with platinum flatware. Anyway, arrived early so we wouldn't be punished, walk in, and the employee at the desk/podium looks at me, ignores me, and greets the next person who comes in after me. After a few awkward minutes I tell her I'm there because I have a reservation. She finds me in the computer, asks me to wait, then walks away. After a few others get seated, a different guy walks by, asks if we're being helped, finds us in the system, and immediately lets us upstairs. We had intended to get some small bites and champagne before starting our meal; for some reason this caused our waiter extreme discomfort and anguish because for the entire first half hour or so, he was literally staring at our table whenever we looked up. Maybe not directly ordering the meal caused his brain to short circuit. Champagne was poured into shorter glasses than you're supposed to, one of the glasses was poured incorrectly regarding the bubbles, and he dripped champagne into my wine glass. We had regular wine glasses that were then taken away to make room; after ordering a bottle of white wine he brought back different, incorrect wine glasses not meant for white wine. The only memorable thing about the food was the steak was supposed to be medium rare; came out dry and medium well, possibly almost medium in the very middle. We pointed it out to the waiter just to tell him, without wanting a replacement, and he goes \\"well, did you cut through the middle\\" -- yes, I know how steak works and what medium rare is. Had a few bites of steak and at that point just wanted to leave; as a joke asked if we could have dessert taken to go. Waiter disappears, comes back and says no, because one of the desserts, sorbet, would melt. Ok, can we have the other dessert, mousse, to go. He disappears, comes back, and says no, the chef said this will also melt. Two other high points: our still water and wine were kept in an ice bucket between our table and another; that table's waitress started refilling her table's glasses with our still water, but I didn't say anything because the whole experience was ludicrous enough; second, once the dining room filled up, the noise level was similar to a cafeteria or train station.

Their lattes are on point, and they have soy and almond milk options too. I really have to shout out the bakers here though. They make my favorite scones in the city (especially the cranberry orange one)! It is the perfect combination of dense, with a crunchy crust and not too overpoweringly sweet.

Our server was friendly but seemed a little unpolished.  I'll chalk it up to a new place working out the kinks.  \\n\\nAt any rate, we ordered a bottle of red wine, which was begging for a wine cooler as we sipped it at room temperature.  We ordered the bruschetta appetizer, and while the tomato/garlic/basil mixture was delicious, I would've preferred crostini over the baked pizza crust it was served on.  Now on to the pizza.  We shared the Prosciutto pie, which was topped with Parma ham and a generous portion of fresh arugula atop it.  It was OK--I think it would've been better with either less tomato base or more time in the oven for the crust's sake.  In other words, it was a little soggy.\\n\\nOur courses arrived right on top of each other, in that I'd taken one bite of the bruschetta before I was helping to clear room on our table for the pizza.  That may be OK for some folks, but I felt like I had to race through one course in order to prevent the other from getting cold.\\n\\nThe atmosphere has a contemporary feel, with a couple splashy decor features such as two vespas parked in the center of the main level and oversized white lanterns hanging from above.

The owner is rude and shady billing practices are commonplace.  My family and I visited the establishment last night while there were truly eight of us two of them were babies therefore we did not think that they would be included in the total guests. You see a party of eight or more and like most places they add an 18% gratuity to your check which is fine. The total of the bill came to $336 my husband rounded up to 400 and we left.  in the parking lot I asked him how could the bill be that much I could not make it add up in my head. I went back in and asked to see the bill the hostess who told me she is also a server got the bill for me and I asked her to point out to me where the 18% gratuity was she admitted that she could not read the hand written check very well and had trouble finding where the server added it on.  Keep in mind she has more light standing there than any of us do in this dark restaurant at any of the tables not to mention we were in the very back corner. She finally found some sort of small...very small scribbling where 18% had been added on.  I simply scribbled out our $70 tip and re totaled the bill.  I was upset because I felt that the server knew exactly what she was doing in making this not legible. I asked to talk to the manager the hostess went to get the manager came back out and informed me he was too busy to talk with me.  I gave her my number and ask her to have Tommy the owner call me the next day. When he did not call I called him.  he immediately was very brash I kept a very calm tone and explained the situation. He began to tell me that he nor his his server had done anything wrong and if I say they did that I am a liar those are his words a liar. I asked him why he was becoming so aggressive with me as I was very calm and trying to have an adult conversation. He continued to yell at me and call me names and tell me that he didn't even have to have this conversation with me. I very calmly told him that neither myself nor my family would ever be back to the restaurant not because of the incident that happened last night but the way he the owner was handling a customer. His response to me was that he did not care he did not need our business he has a big enough business that he doesn't need or want people like me in there. I have never in my life been spoken to the way he spoke to me. I told him that I believed the conversation needed to be over I wished him a good day as I was hanging up he called me a bitch. I will say the food there is pretty good  the service was mediocre. We had to ask our server multiple times if we could have a refill on water. We had to ask multiple times if she would please clear our appetizer plates in order to give us more room because our food had come we were squeezed into the very back corner and we didn't have very much room to begin with. She was not very friendly at all and it seemed like we were just an imposition to her. She also kept running her hands through her hair which sort of grossed me out a little bit. And when taking my oldest grandchild to the bathroom I was shocked to see one of the servers take a straw out of a drink taste the drink put the straw back in and serve it to a table. I can only hope that table was her family. It is an extremely loud restaurant this was a Tuesday night and they were busy as busy as you can be for a very small restaurant but it was so loud it's hard to hear one another speak. Lastly it is extremely expensive the quality of the food and the cost of the food do not match there are many more Italian places in the Columbus area that are much better have much better atmosphere much better service and now I can honestly say much better owners.

His attitude was disappointing and he clearly couldn't have cared less about our experience or our lengthy wait. With so many great Japanese restaurants in town with much better service, I'll make other choices in the future.  I've heard that this place is in decline, which is too bad because some of the things they have on the menu are delicious. One of the waiters told me that they limited their lunch menu to make it more manageable for the kitchen, so they really have been dealing with service problems.

They were very helpful making recommendations answering question about menu items we saw the line.  Always asked if we needed anything else or refilled our drinks.  I can say there were both very professional and personable to us.  \\nWe sat at the bar, because the wait was 45 minutes on a Sunday and they said that was a good wait time.  One half of the bar is for over 21 and the other half is for anyone under 21.  There was a drink that they make with champagne and cranberry syrup and dried cranberries...that the bubbles makes the berries dance in the glass.  We had the #TBC- peanut butter pancakes the serving is not on the large size but they will fill you up.  The jelly or jam for the toast is really good it is some kind of berry, didn't ask the name.  The HIGHLIGHT is the Chicken Fried Bacon...if you go there at least order this item.  If you love bacon it's like a whole new level of tastiness.  However, what we ate is not the real fun of the place.  It's that you get to make your own pancakes at your table.  They bring the batter in bottles and you can make shapes or whatever your imagination can think of to make a pancake shape.

I think one person said something about how they got a plate with three meats here for $5. How? Maybe the prices have changed, but the average plate here is $8, and the highest priced lunch/ dinner is like $13. \\n\\nI ordered the chicken combo with a fountain drink and dessert- baklava, and my total was $14.\\n\\nThe food had a lot of potential. I will concede that my friend liked his food a lot. He had the lamb, and it came with yellow rice, salad and pita bread. \\n\\nI had a similar plate, but chicken instead of lamb. The flavors were good, but my rice was suuuupppperrr salty. I'm the type of person that sprinkles salt on tv dinners. I am not sodium sensitive. I like salty food, but my rice was so salty it was difficult to eat. I had to fill my mouth with orange soda and salad in between bites in order to be able to deal with the salt. I had to eat my baklava while eating my meal to cut the effect of all the salt. I think someone accidentally over- salted the rice on that day. There's no way they would intentionally load it up wth salt like that on the daily. So, that was disappointing.\\n\\nI was given red spicy sauce and a white condiment to accompany my meal. The spicy red condiment was very good. I am 95% sure the white condiment was mayonnaise. This was surprising to me, because I would expect a yogurt sauce to be given with this type of food. My friend actually did receive yogurt sauce with his, so I don't know why I got a ramekin of mayo. \\n\\nThe pita bread was really, really good. I also enjoyed the side salad and it's dressing- a little lettuce and tomato in a light vinaigrette. \\n\\nThe service was very nice. Helpful and kind and welcoming.\\n\\nFinally, the baklava. I love baklava, and the flavor was very good, but it seemed a little soggy and a little bit old. It tasted like it had been left uncovered in a refrigerator for a few days and it absorbed refrigerator air making the layers a bit less crisp than they would be if fresh.."},{"name":"Chuy's","address":"8123 International Dr","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"This place has a very cool look on the outside and in the lobby.

My wife did great on her burrito eating well beyond what she normally would commenting over and over how good it was.\\n\\nThe service was very pleasant and the woman who took our orders was all smiles and nice to deal with.\\n\\nOur only complaint was that the restaurant was full of BBQ smoke.

It is large enough that two normal eaters could split it.  \\n   The real star, for me, was the Cafe con Leche. Get a Large if you order it, because you will love it. For me, the blend was perfect.\\n   Oh wait, the BIG star was the Quesito, which is a a delicious crispy pastry with a slightly sweet cheese filling. I ate it while I waited for the omelet, proving once again how smart I am. OK, the guy in front of me ordered a dozen to go, so I suspected they might be good. Mine certainly was. I had forgotten how incredible fresh-baked pastry tastes. \\n  I still haven't learned to speak much Spanish, and no one, staff or customers, was speaking English, but everyone understood me when I ordered, and all were very friendly. \\n  Overall, it was a great experience which I hope to experience often. \\n\\n  Thank you, fellow Yelpers, for recommending Panchos!"},{"name":"Spinelli's Deli","address":"767 Neil Ave","city":"Columbus","stars":"3","text":"I'd walked past this place many times and generally like deli sandwiches, so recently I thought why not give it a try? This turned out to be a mistake. The sandwich I ordered, something along the lines of an Italian-style sub, was among the worst I have ever had, primarily because the bread was horrible. This particular bread, which the employee who made my sandwich told me was supposed to be sourdough, had no flavor and the consistency of memory foam. The texture of the sandwich was further made unappealing by meats and vegetables that were sliced inconsistently and on the whole too thick. My sandwich was no bad I was unable to bring myself to finish it, stopping a few bites into the second half.\\n\\nThe only positive thing I can say is that the service was good. The employees were very friendly and attentive, which is why I am giving a 2-star rather than a 1-star rating.

Another friend asked for eggs to be poached (on a dish where you can choose your egg style) and they came fried. The food was ok but nothing special and I thought the portion sizes were small for the price. The classic breakfast of eggs, bacon, potatoes, and toast barely took up a regular plate- when it arrived it was underwhelming.

We were, in fact, terrified to order a second appetizer, so we decided to share the one we did order: what was advertised as a fish tagine. \\n\\nThis was the sorriest fish tagine that has ever has the misfortune of being mis-represented as such. Imagine a broth made from the skeletal carcass of one lonely butterfish -- in other words, a thin, flavorless stock -- in which was placed three sad slices of carrot, one piece of squid, one piece of overcooked, poached whitefish.

But Yelp keeps harassing me to add a review, so fine! Here's a review!\\n\\nPok Pok is on my list of the top 10 essential places to eat in Portland. This list is probably a bit different than most people's, because I don't eatz the meatz, and most of Portland does. But Pok Pok is still on there because it's such an experience.\\n\\nFor starters, the space is adorable. It may lose its luster after you live in Portland for a while, and if it does, take a step back and try to appreciate the big picture. The converted house/driveway/garage/porches make for an adorable, fragmented restaurant composed of several intimate dining areas. You may get a strong, cold wind through the tent-y \\"walls\\" of the upstairs porch area. If it's bad weather, try to get a spot downstairs in the main dining area. It's cozy.\\n\\nIf there's a wait, (99% of the time, there will be. If there isn't, it may be the beginning of the apocalypse. But no worries! This would be a very reasonable place to spend the end of the world), go have a drink at any of the sweet little drinkeries nearby. They'll call you once you're good and extra boozed up and ready to eat. \\n\\nThe food is pretty great. It's my type of comfort food. I've tried basically all of the vegetarian options on the menu and they're all good. The hot items tend to be better than the cold items in my opinion. My friends have nearly unanimously professed love for the PokPok wings particularly, except for one who is just weird.\\n\\nDrinking vinegars: pick the weirdest sounding one and drink it. Or try all of them. I wish they came in a taster tray - definitely one of the most interesting parts of this experience. \\n\\nService is variable. Sometimes it feels super rushed. Sometimes it doesn't. Usually the servers are friendly, but sometime they seem pissy. This place is more about the food than anything else."},{"name":"Pok Pok","address":"3226 SE Division St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Every flavor at Pok Pok is an experience.

Parking was easy, there was a long wait (about 45 minutes) but they have nice outdoor seating and complementary seasoned popcorn and water to make it more pleasant. The wait-staff here were incredibly chipper, friendly, and helpful. The brunch was buffet style. Cons: the wait could be long (but not bad) and when the line was long, we would just enjoy each others company for a while. Pros: so many options, like SO MANY. We each went back 3 times. They had foods ranging from gluten free chocolate muffins and specialty pastries to breakfast chicken fried steak and chicken. My personal favorite: the jam bar! They had warm fresh biscuits and bread and every sort of jam or jelly, and each was incredible. There was something there for everyone, even the pickiest eaters. Great for families or group get together.\\n\\nI also have been for dinner. Similar experience but no buffet. Both my dates dish and my own were incredible.

The town center also has Costco pizza, but let's be serious, we all have days when we want a pizza that's not plain cheese, pepperoni, or what Costco has figured out to be their best-selling combination.  The restaurant is located in the back of the town center next to Which Wich.  Driving down on Town Boulevard, drive past the street that goes to Costco and the restaurant is on your right.  Parking on a weeknight can be packed, but you should be able to find a spot in one of the many free garages if parking in front isn't immediately available.  The restaurant has a large open layout.  You order your pizza in a line that starts to the left of the entrance and your pizza is finished in a huge red oven that resembles a spaceship.\\n\\nOn the Menu: Pizzafire has an interesting mix of both pizzas and salads.  Unlike other build your own pizza restaurants, there are different price tiers.  A one topping pizza will cost the least, a three topping pizza will cost a little more, and then there is an unlimited toppings pizza that is priced competitively to other local restaurants.  If you're too lazy (like I was) to think about what to put on your pizza, you can order from a set of premade combinations.  You can order a traditional margherita pizza or meat pizza (Chicago - pepperoni, sausage, bacon, and meatballs).  In addition, there is a BBQ chicken pizza (Cowboy), potato and chorizo pizza (Ranch Lovers' Potato), chicken pesto (Hollywood), and white vegetable pizza (New York - broccoli, tomatoes, and spinach).  Pizzafire also offers a build your own salad option, which is another smart use of their large toppings bar.  The veggies for salads are unlimited and the proteins will cost a little bit more.\\n\\nWhat I Tried:\\nCowboy Pizza ($7.99) - The Cowboy pizza comes with sweet barbecue sauce, mozzarella cheese, cheddar cheese, barbecue chicken, jalape√±o peppers, and fried onions.  If you're worried that fried onions will burn in the oven - don't, they're added after your pizza is done baking.  The pizza has a thin crust which was crispy - what you usually get for a personal pizza that is quickly baked for a few minutes prior to serving.  I was given a good amount of sauce, although I would have preferred a little more cheese.  As promised the barbecue sauce is sweet - it's not as tasty as what you'll get at a barbecue meat joint, but it's good enough to put on a pizza.  The jalape√±o peppers add a nice mild kick of spice as you bite into each slice.  Shredded chicken on the pizza remained moist, but I didn't think the pizza was \\"too wet\\" overall. \\n\\nVerdict: I'd rank my pizza between 3 1/2 - 4 stars when compared to other pizza joints- but a lot of how the pizza comes out will depend on what you choose to put on it.  The crust is the foundation of all pizzas and is decent enough here to provide a good base for whatever you want to eat.  Service was good.

I was certainly wrong to bring them to Pok Pok. \\n\\nOn the way there, my boyfriend and I tried to remember why we never go to Pok Pok. It only took about 5 minutes of being there to remember why. The staff glared at us and ignored us as we eagerly waited at the host's station. We were seated and then were served by a team of snide, rude, unhappy waitresses who refused to answer a question my father had about the food. \\n\\nWhen the food finally arrived one of the waitresses rudely shoved the plates in our faces, auctioning off the meals and although one of them did not belong to us, kept shouting the name of this dish at us so she could get it out of her self important hands and move on to the next table of people she did not give a crap about.\\n\\nThe food was good. It was nothing special. I recommend not supporting a business that allows their staff to treat their customers with such disdain. I regret the $150 spent on the meal and even more so the mandatory gratuity added for a table of five.

If you are someone that hates cilantro (like me), this is not the place for you.\\n\\nPrices are through the roof. Food (except for the oysters) was pretty good, but there wasn't that much for what we were paying. Minimum price for a tapa is $12, max was $24. No entree options like many other tapas restaurants in Boston.\\n\\nThe service was terrible. Server was not attentive. It took too long to resolve the late arriving dish. When it came time to pay, she had us check out on a leaf tablet. Not very user-friendly and for the prices we're paying, the server should be swiping the card. As we were leaving, the server ran to grab us to say that she had brought up the wrong check and we had actually paid for the table next to us. It then took a while for her to get the refund authorized by a manager so that we could pay the correct bill and leave. Technology needs to be used effectively.

Now I understand completely why Pok Pok closed down in LA after only opening for a year. Their food prices are ridiculously high and compared to Thai restaurants here in LA, especially in Thai Town, the tastes of the food are bad and portions are so small.\\n\\nCame back to Pok Pok the second time when I had a weekend getaway to Portland with my friends. My first experience was just okay, I just came to the US from Indonesia and visited my friend in Portland. So at that time my taste bud was still a noob so I remembered Pok Pok as being good. I actually only remembered the chicken wings.\\n\\nSo, I recommended Pok Pok to my friends because of their super high reviews and because none of us had the chance to try their LA restaurant. \\n\\nLuckily, there were 6 of us so we could make a reservation first (they only accept reservation for parties of 6 or more). I booked it on Thursday and got a table for Saturday dinner at 8.30pm. It was so ridiculous that I had to put my credit card down to secure the reservation. Even fine dining restaurants don't do that anymore (well some of them still do). \\n\\nWhen we got there 15 minutes early, the table was not ready. We heard from some people that they have been waiting for 1-1.5 hours. Our group decided that if by 8.35 we still didn't get the table we will just leave and find another place (we regretted that we didn't leave). By 8.33 we finally was escorted to our table upstairs.\\n\\nFirst of all, the inside of the second floor was horrible. The carpet smelled like spilled fish sauce combined with restroom smell. I would recommend the restaurant to just change the carpet to floor or at least do some carpet cleaning.\\n\\nWe decided to order the Fish Sauce wings, papaya salad, pork belly curry, glass noodle salad, and wild boar. Not one of them tasted good, all of them were lacking the kick you got from Thai restaurants. The wings was too salty, and tasted only salty. The only better one was the papaya salad. Pork belly was all fat. And the wild boar was okay but portion could only feed a baby.\\n\\nI'm so sorry Portland-ers for talking bad about your top restaurant, but seriously the price of the food was so high and so not worth it for the quality.

After a couple months, I decided I would give them one more try since Kendall Sq. doesn't have many options.  Today I got the braised short rib sandwich special.  This was also heavy on the fat but at least there was some meat.  It is cut VERY thick so it is hard to take bites.  The bread was SOAKED in butter.  It didn't even seem like they were attempting to toast it, they just soaked it in butter for...taste?  The whole sandwich was grease.  Again, gross.  Couldn't finish it.  And the price has gone up to $10, $11 with tax.  I could have a cheaper sandwich in a sit-down restaurant, including tip, and it would taste 500 times better.

The restaurant has a nice d√©cor and I really found the place charming. We did not have a dedicated waiter or waitress.  It seemed as though we just had whoever was available.  I would have thought that this would be confusing but it really came across as top notch service.  There was just always someone there, yet they weren't too clingy where we felt rushed.\\n\\nThe oysters are the star in this restaurant and you shouldn't come here if you aren't a fan.  I tried 4 different kinds of oysters and these were the order I would put them in, in terms of my taste: 1. Island Creek, 2. Rocky Nook, 3. Ichabod Flat and 4. Row 34.  I particularly did not care for the Row 34 oysters as they literally tasted like the sea and were salty.  In addition to Oysters we also ordered the white wine mussels.  The mussels do not come in the shells and they were absolutely incredible.  I wanted to drink the sauce, it was that good.\\n\\nFor the main course I ordered the lobster roe noodles which is supposedly the most popular dish.  The surprising thing with this dish is that the lobster was not the star of the dish, but the braised beef was. Truthfully they should just have a plate of the braised beef and they would have a 5 star dish.  My friends had the monkfish and seafood casserole.  The monkfish tasted great but the potato and ham side it came with was extremely salty.  The seafood casserole was interesting in that it appeared to come in a red sauce.  Also, the dish didn't come with a side which didn't seem right to me.  As a carb-aholic, this really should have came with a potato or rice of some sort.  The seafood casserole was definitely not a hit and would not recommend it.  \\n\\nFor dessert we shared the banana cream pie and the coconut pistachio cake.  The coconut pistachio cake was unique and great for those that don't like sweet desserts.  The banana cream pie was out of this world.  The drinks were strong and I would definitely recommend the ginger smash. \\n\\nOverall there were some pros and cons to this restaurant.  The price range is extremely high and due to this the entrees overall need to be better.  I would definitely come here again for drinks and appetizers, but if you want a great overall meal just walk about 1 minute down the street to Eastern Standard."},{"name":"Cap't Loui","address":"160 Brighton Ave","city":"Allston","stars":"4","text":"I tried takeout from Loui Loui a few times, and come away impressed every time.

We've never gone for dinner, but the lunch/brunch menu is perfectly-sized, with nicely-portioned sandwiches and offerings like shrimp or oyster po' boys, maine lobster toast (think avocado toast with large pieces of lobster and a poached egg on top), burgers, pasta, etc. I haven't had anything that I didn't enjoy. As expected, they have an outstanding selection of oysters and crudo. I love that the farmers are all listed with their oysters to help connect customers to the source of the oysters, and helps create a jumping off point for conversations with the knowledgeable staff. Which leads to the service...\\n\\nWe've had some of the best service we've ever had...anywhere (and we dine out A LOT) on a few of our visits. Our one visit was less personable, but only disappointing relative to our outstanding experiences. The staff can tell you anything you need to know about the menu, the sourcing of the food, the flavor profiles and differences in oysters, all the way down to their wines, ciders, and cocktail program. Not only is the staff informative, but they're also not pretentious and very approachable. That's a tough combo to pull off sometimes. If you sit in the bar area (which is our preference) the servers work in a pair, which means your drinks are always topped off, your food comes out quick, your tables are cleared quick, etc. It's been a seamless operation on every visit. \\n\\nThe atmosphere (at least in the bar area) is very nice and relaxing. We've sat there chatting, eating, talking to staff, etc. for hours before. It's that type of place. The huge windows provide tons of light during the day, too. Add on the great food, nice staff, and you've got a recipe for a perfect lunch, brunch, and I assume, dinner.\\n\\nDefinitely make a reservation, sit in Lindsay's section, and enjoy a wonderful, casual dining experience.

We made a reservation for lunch at 2pm. Because a change in our schedule, some of us got there by 1pm and asked if we could move up the reservation. No was the answer, and they said because there's only one table that holds all seven of us and they cannot put two tables together. they cannot seat us in two adjacent tables either. Really? The restaurant was not busy at all at that time!\\nFine so we decided to wait, and were informed that we couldn't order anything from dinner menu... This is understandable but very disappointing.\\nTo be fair they were punctual. A waitress came to lead us to our table right at two. And the table was really two tables put together...

Our server walked pass us a couple of times after that, without stopping to see if we needed sth, had questions on the menu or were ready to order. We finally grabbed ahold of her and she seemed impatient. Turns out she messed up our orders too, she left out some sides and oyster singles. The whole time she had a long face, we didn't feel like we were pampered or treated well. She was no where to be found when we needed extra plates or napkins. Non of the runners stopped by neither even when we gestured. Finally my friend got up to the counter and grabbed what we needed herself.\\nThe food was decent.

So if you are also from out of town don't be discouraged - just put your name down, go to the Winchester, have a nice cold pint, and wait for all of this to blow over.\\n\\nWe got an amazing booth inside, and I looked over the slightly intimidating menu. Don't expect Pad Thai or even typical curry dishes. This place is anything but typical in service, quality and taste. And I was very fortunate my friends knew what to get.\\n\\nKaeng Hang Leh: spiced pork belly and pork shoulder in a delicious red curry. The pork belly melted with the spices on my tongue. Perfect over coconut or jasmine rice. \\n\\nSii Khrong Muu Yaang: baby back ribs with two dipping sauces. Tried a rib in each sauce, but sadly couldn't tell you which was which, but both were great. \\n\\nSunny's Yam Wun Sen: pork sausage and ground pork glass noodle salad. This was good and added a different flavor with the sourness. Sadly I'm not the biggest fan of sour foods so probably wouldn't request this on another visit, but very good nonetheless.\\n\\nNeua Naam Tok: flank steak salad. You grab some stick rice, grab a piece of steak and veggies, pop it in your mouth. Delicious. \\n\\nAnd this was saved for last, and was the highlight of an already impressive meal.\\nIke's Vietnamese Fish Sauce Wings: Wow. Aside from being large chicken wings, the flavor on this is mind-blowing. Sweet, spicy, you might leave some sauce on your face to savor later it is that good. My friends were generous and gave me a second. The meat was tender, cooked perfectly, and if not for having no checked baggage, I would have ordered a bottle of the sauce to go.\\n\\nWe also had jasmine, coconut, and stick rice on the table and all three were amazing as well (but I'm one of those people that could just eat rice and sauce).\\n\\nAt the end, as it was my friend's birthday, our server and friend got the whole restaurant to sing a round. We got this custard desert that was really good, and an icecream dish that came on a hot dog bun. But at this point I was so full, I could barely eat any more - even though said server put the last of the Kaeng Hang Leh curry sauce on the left over rice and told me to eat.\\n\\nThe staff was very friendly (though this could be due to my friend sort of being in the \\"family\\") and were very attentive to the other tables as well.

They were so crispy, garlicky, fish saucey, a bit tangy and spicey, and just completely awesome. They were sticky and a little messy but that sauce... it's worth it.

We and the other Yelpers ended up cruising the lot looking for spaces like that desperate guy circling the bar after last call. It literally took me longer to find parking than it did for me to drive up here from Grant Park. This was an inauspicious beginning.\\n\\nI entered the restaurant in not-the-best of moods. For no other reason than they both have sushi lunch buffets, I was expecting loud J-Pop techno and a bunch of Mexican guys yelling \\"Konichiwa!\\" at me when I walked in ala RuSan's. I was pleasantly surprised to find a more subdued atmosphere.\\n\\nThe Yelpers were put in the back. WAY in the back. I don't blame them for putting us out of the way. It's a wise move.  However sitting in the back allowed me to spy the swank karaoke machine they hide from the round-eyes.  But you can't hide karaoke from a Filipino. Much like med school applications and pointing with our lips, karaoke is a Filipino birthright. \\"Saturday nights,\\" we were told.\\n\\nOn to the sushi buffet. Relative to sushi in general, it was ok. Some nigiri, but your usual suspects; the red snapper though was a pleasant surprise. A few cute rolls, the flaming joy roll probably the best of the bunch if only for the name. I didn't find anything too offensive and thought it was of good quality, especially for a buffet. And thankfully, nothing seemed to sit on the buffet too long.\\n\\nNow relative to, say, RuSan's lunch buffet, the quality was far superior. Now I know that's kind of a low bar to set, but back when I used to work nearby RuRu, I still ate their buffet fairly regularly. RuSan's has a much larger selection, but Kiku's seemed to be put together with more attention to detail. Another huge difference between the two were their non-sushi offerings. Kiku offered salad, seaweed salad and spicy Korean noodles that kept finding their way on my plate with each trip back.  Kiku's \\"teryiaki beef\\"wasn't nearly as tough and chewy as RuSan's normally is.\\n\\nI'd give their buffet a solid 3.5 stars that I'd round up to 4 if it weren't for the parking. But 3, in this case, is the magic number. Now I need to return 1) to see how dinner is and 2) to rock their karaoke mike like a vandal. Oh, Saturday karaoke, you will be mine.

What was I doing at a BBQ place? I went here yesterday with co-workers, and I went thinking that I'd have some cole slaw and fries or something unsatisfying just so that I could join the fun. But wow, was I ever surprised. I had an excellent veggie meatloaf (made from Beyond Beef, which is the best, in my view). Two generous slices were topped with the greatest BBQ sauce I've ever had and garnished with fresh rosemary sprigs. And because you've got to have mashed potatoes with your meatloaf, I also ordered some--with veggie gravy! It was a terrific meal. The menu features several other veggie options, so I will definitely come back...although I just might have to order the meatloaf again! The service was great, too. We had a large group, and our server handled everything with friendly expertise.

I'm not vegetarian so it doesnt matter..... they were delicious and I almost had a second order!  The dipping sauce was amazingly delicious too.   They were the highlight of the meal sadly.  The banchan selection was decent but I was disappointed with their kimchi.  It was hardly spicy.  Speaking of kimchi, my main entree was the kimchi jayuk bokeum.  It contained said weak kimchi and had hardly any pork in it at all...  like for real, hardly any at all.  The dish comes with steamed tofu as well which made up for the lack of pork.  However the tofu is on the side so it doesn't have the full flavor.  I ended up dipping the tofu in the mandu dipping sauce.  Meh.

It is packed with sodium from the fish sauce and all the Southeast Asian flavors you can find - spicy, sweet, lemony. I definitely recommend ordering a side of rice.  \\n\\nBEEF SALAD was so interesting, it is a warm grilled beef served over a bed of mixed salad, rice powder to give that texture.  Rice powder is common in Southeast Asian salads like Larb (pronounced La-b) and it helps soak up some of the sauce so you actually get the sauce.  The sweet, sour, umami sauce with lemongrass is just delicious.  I loved it with the sticky rice and ate with my hands.  You take the sticky rice and kneed it in your fingers to make it clump together even more (this adds texture) then dip in the sauce and pick up some leaf and beef and enjoy! \\n\\nBATWING BEANS WITH SHRIMP -- this is just a simple dish but super good.
