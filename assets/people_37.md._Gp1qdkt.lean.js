The peanut sauce with the tofu was excellent; the sauce with the shrimp was enjoyable but not our favorite.  Next came Buddha Fried Rice, Sweet & Sour Chicken, Basil Shrimp (by a different name), and Pud See Ew.  All arrived steaming hot and sporting top quality ingredients.  They were generous with the vegetables and nuts (except in one dish where we asked to leave them out).  Portion sizes were excellent, and this is important to us because we really don't like expensive food that lacks generosity.  And this wasn't expensive, either, compared to many similar places.  Our only criticism is that we do like stronger flavors, in general, but the Buddha and Basil dishes were a bit on the delicate side.

Kale special was really good, Chicken Lentils Masala was very tender and flavorful, Aloo Gobi was excellent - cauli was perfectly done, but the Goat Vindaloo (hot) was the bomb - the heat is from complex spices, not just hot powder.  My overwhelming impression is the sublime balance in the flavors of each dish - it's like a taste symphony.  Many Indian dishes are spoilt by overuse of one strong ingredient or another, or they taste generic or bland - this food is uncannily balanced, it's original and beautifully crafted, made with love and attention.

We ordered the Chef's Choice (board of house-made cured meats and artisan cheese) and two pizzas for the 4 of us to share.\\n\\nChef's Choice: Salami, chorizo, and cheese (I can't remember for my life what type). The meats were well seasoned, moderately peppery but not overwhelming by any means. There were mustard seeds on the board which I thought paired w/ the meats/cheese beautifully.\\n\\nPizzas: We ordered the Pizza Bianca (clams, potato, house bacon, green onion, bechamel) and The Salty Pig (salty pig parts, mustard, pale ale caramel, w/ arugula on top). Both were excellent! The thin crust was one perfect crunchy bite after another. The pig parts on The Salty Pig were savory but was juuust a tad overly salty, although I thought that's when the arugula came through w/ the bitterness to balance out the flavors. Pizza Bianca was great, it's definitely the lighter of the two but just as decadent (also just curious can I call it surf and turf when it's clam and bacon on a pizza? :P)\\n\\nSwitching gear to drinks...Angel Number 75 has got to be one of the best brunch cocktails I've ever had.

We all know that Pepsi buys your service by providing free equipment. So when you server Pepsi, we know your interest is in your bottom line not the taste buds of the customers.

Sushi dinners can get pricy very quickly, so I try to make it to Happy Hour whenever possible. The Happy Hour here is one of the best around. Rolls, sashimi, nigiri, appetizers and alcoholic beverages are just $4 each, which is a steal. And the portion sizes are still nice.\\n\\nI came here Monday with a large group of friends, and we ordered the steamed gyoza dumplings, shrimp summer rolls and edamame to start. All of the apps were tasty. Then, we went for the sushi and sashimi. I ordered the tuna sashimi and the special roll. The special roll sounded nice on the menu, but I was shocked by just how much I loved it... so much that I had to order a second special roll. It features spicy tuna, salmon, avocado, pea shoots and spinach crunch. It was REALLY nice. The texture of the spinach crunch really enhanced this roll. \\n\\nThe ambiance here is excellent. The restaurant is small and cozy with modern decor and large floor-to-ceiling windows that let in a good amount of light. It brought back fond memories of the days of OLV (the restaurant that was once in this space). Sodo Sushi is conveniently located in the Sodo Shopping Complex roundabout, so there's plenty of free parking, both on the street and in the 3 garages.\\n\\nThe only negative we experienced was with the sauvignon blanc that my friend ordered from the Happy Hour menu. When it arrived, it was a dark yellow... a bit odd for a sauv blanc. And it tasted like a chard (rich and buttery as opposed to crisp and acidic). I tried a sip and confirmed my friend's concern. She asked the server if maybe a chard was accidentally poured instead. The server checked and then came back and explained that the Happy Hour sauv blanc is very dark and doesn't taste like a sauv blanc. So that's a little weird. Why have a sauv blanc on your menu that tastes like a chardonnay? At least it was only a $4 glass.\\n\\nI think each of us spent about $16 to $20 a piece plus tip for a plentiful feast (that included drinks). We left stuffed.

Honestly, I wished I had read the YELP reviews, as I usually do, instead of listening to my students.  \\n\\nBefore you even get to the door of the restaurant, you have to get from the the recommended parking lot for patrons which is located down the street on what appears to be the remains of a building's foundation.  The neighborhood itself was reason enough for not getting out of the car but I went against my better judgement and sucked it up, said a little prayed and walked the longest 1 1/2 blocks of my life.  \\n\\nMy friend and I walked to the door of this unsuspecting building off of Peter street in South West Atlanta with high expectations and anticipation.  All of that was shot down the moment we walked in.  There is a host/hostess station at the door but no one was there and no one came to welcome us so we walked too and took a seat at the bar.  The restaurant is only so big and the oversized bar is in the center of it all and taking up most of the space.  There are some weird window seats with tiny tables that for the most part were way too small to accommodate food, drinks and a hookah.  Oh yeah!  The hookah smoke was the only thing that greeted us the first 5 minutes of being there.  After leaving the bar and its Dollar Store plastic bar stools behind for a clear bistro table and a different type of Dollar Store plastic stools, we waited 20-25 minutes for a waitress before my patience meter expired.  When I returned to the bar to order drinks for me and my friend,  I was totally ignored by one bartender and eventually waited on by another.  THIS ISN'T GOING GETTING ANY BETTER.  Because I had yet to see a menu of any kind, I blindly ordered.  I asked for a GREEN APPLE MARTINI for my friend and a BOMBAY SAPPHIRE GIN & TONIC for me.  WHAAAAAAT!?  YOU DON'T HAVE TONIC!!!  This is where the story should've ended but I was desperate to salvage something good from this adventure.  I settled for Crown Royal Apple on the rocks.  \\n\\nI was shocked when i saw that two drinks cost, $24.42 in this community center-side room, prom decorated playhouse.

The service for us  was already beyond horrible and had gone way past the exit of recovery.  However, we thought perhaps the food might save this experience and salvage some good from this evening and you guessed it - WRONG!  I had the most forgettable turkey burger.  It was advertised as \\"The Stuffed Turkey Burger\\" but showed on my receipt as the \\"Tity Boy Turkey Burger\\".  I can't tell you what was on it, in it or underneath it (see picture below).  I also use the picture as a reminder.  I forked out another $26 for 2 burgers and fries, $2.08 was added in taxes and then once again-BOOM! $4.68 in forced GRATUITIES for a total of $32.76 and a Grand Total for the evening of $61.14.

But with as high as prices are, the food is half decent at best... and so is the service. I'm about 99.9% sure our waiter forgot about our table (me, my sister, and my older parents). My sister and I found the food to be sub par but my parents enjoyed it so two nights ago- a Friday night- we decided to sit for dinner after we had attended an event close by. It was 10:30pm. We arrive to the restaurant with 3 drunk men stumbling out of the restaurant fighting.. good start. Got to the hostess, couldn't hear a word she said. When I say the restaurant turns into a literal night club after a certain time, I mean it.... it completely lost its class and I wanted to get my parents out of there ASAP.

In addition to the standing fictional situation, the tables weren't full - which having worked in a restaurant before I understand reservations take up a lot of that...but just a heads up that allowing people to simply stand and have a drink on one of four available roofs in Cambridge would provide a huge source of revenue, so maybe that should be re-evaluated at 6 pm on sunny Saturday."},{"name":"Anchan House of Thai Food","address":"373 Washington St","city":"Braintree","stars":"4.5","text":"Tried this place 2 weeks ago.

I didn't want to say that going in - I was born in Kansas City next to a barbecue joint; it could very well be, my first solid meals were sauced Kansas City Brisket and fries. I'm serious about Barbecue, so when I went to Austin, I ran the gambit on what Texas barbecue had to offer. Outcome: long lines, too many people, lacking facilities unable to service the demand in a timely fashion. We have things to do, yet I spent 5 hours of my day trying to find lunch. With traffic and wait times, I ditched Austin, and headed to The Salt Lick. Surely in the wilderness outside Austin, people couldn't be swamping that place. \\n\\nWow. Just what the hell. There were at least 500 people there. Hour long waits. I wanted a sandwich and slice of pie. That's it. Anywhere in Kansas City - with the exception of the original Joe's Kansas City, you walk in, 10 minutes later you walk out full. I went to 3 or 4 joints in Austin over 5 hours, left the city hungry. The Texas BBQ game is exclusively for those locals with nothing to do, and hours to wait in the sun for food. You want me to stand in line for something I don't even know if I'll like? Nope.\\n\\nWhat I understood from the cooking process inside was that the viking hearth style smoking pit is just a gimmick. You can't cook meat proper like that in any sort of way that justifies standing in line for an hour and a half for it. They throw water on the coals to keep the meat moist, and it looks like low quality meat to begin with. Considering they have an all you can eat option for meat, and their sides look like any low-rent buffet anywhere, I don't think I missed anything.\\n\\nWe talked a cashier into selling us a slice of Pecan pie, and 5 minutes later we were gone. Said pecan pie was muted by sweetness to a fault, lacking entirely any balance of salt - at the fucking salt lick no less. It lacked salt in the crust, and the filling promulgated some type of citrus extract- possibly orange - in the sweet-potato pie textured filling. Not a great slice of pie, at like $6.\\n\\nI suspect that - like most Austin restaurants - it's the journey - not the destination - that's most valuable. It's a beautiful campus, and they've got a full experience of music and entertainment going on around you. With the amount of parking, and community, it's no wonder it's so popular. But the food looked tired, and fast. \\n\\nNot worth my time, and the Pecan pie for me proved it."},{"name":"Estelle's Boston","address":"782 Tremont St","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"Sometimes I really wish I was from the South.

I also made sure I had a light snack before we left so that I wouldn't become hangry lol. \\n\\nWe arrive around 6pm and see the line already formed outside. Outside- because Giacomo's is a tiny place and there is no waiting area inside. I asked the crowd waiting if they had any idea how long the wait is; no one knew. Not having any idea was really making me anxious. I even heard a few people calling other restaurants around checking on wait times and asking to make a reservation lol. Someone from the restaurant did come outside asking how many people were in each group, but they didn't give us a time estimate. \\n\\nI'd say we were pretty lucky because we were seated in about an hour. It was hot inside, we were elbow to elbow, and sharing another table with a group but once you start feasting, you don't even think about it. I ordered a glass of wine, calamari and linguine with mussels and clams! I enjoyed EVERYTHING. The speedy and polite service provided by Rose Marie definitely made it worth the wait!

The only place you can get it is at KoiFusion@1. So my DL and I made a visit on First Thursday.. and they didn't have it. \\n\\nIt wasn't on the menu which I found out from twitter they do that on purpose, so we asked and the waiter (the one and only waiter in the whole dining area) told us that the \\"media people\\" came the day before and cleaned them up. How dare they the media people came and just cleaned all of KFC and left none for me? Wait, so why not make more of this KFC? The waiter said they were in the process of making more of them and they won't be ready until after 8 pm. \\nI looked at my watch and it was only 6 pm. I didn't want to wait that long for dinner, so my DL and I decided to stay and ordered other things of the menu.\\n\\nI ordered the Quesadilla with Kim Chee & Galbi fillings. My DL ordered the three BulGoGi tacos. We also ordered drinks from the bar. $8-$9 per glass of mixed drinks, I thought for sure these drinks would be strong. I was wrong, these drinks were weak. I'm famous for being a lightweight and even I didn't get any buzz or taste the alcohol from my drink. Our drinks were mostly juice with an itty tiny bitty alcohol in it. \\n\\nWe waited for our food for a while. We were bored while we were waiting so I analyzed this place. The set up of this place was a joke. It was in a basement, flat screen televisions are on the wall. It was kinda dark, but not really. It feels like this place is trying to be a hype nightclub, but also a sports bar because they do show NBA games and at the same time you can chow down on Korean tacos. Ah I got it..!\\n\\nWhen our food arrived, we were starved after all the wait. My Quesadilla was tasty and delicious. Who knew kimchee would work well as a Quesadilla filling? I think this is the only reason why I can give one star for this place instead of no star at all. \\n\\nThe service was really bad. One waiter served a full capacity dining room. When we arrived, he didn't say hello to us, just handed us the menu. I said \\"Hi, How are you?\\" to him and he looked like he got caught off guard and made a \\"Fine..and you?\\" response. I don't mind to greet every single waiters and waitresses first if I had to, but can I have the portion of their tips as well? \\nHe didn't check on us once if we need water, refill on drinks, or would you like a new drink? No one bussed tables. They just left dirty plates and glasses on empty tables. \\n\\nAs we about ready to depart, another couple walked in and were asking about the KFC. The waiter told them the same answer, the hungry media people ate all KFC. I just wished that if Koi Fusion can tweet about anything else related to their operations, why don't they tweet about KFC scarce that day? If I knew it, I would make my visit on a different day and it will be a different review than what I wrote today."},{"name":"Via 313 Pizza - East Side","address":"1802 E 6th St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"Merp.

I have to be honest I wasn't too crazy about the pizza, the thing that will make me come back here is the bartender she was so nice and her drinks were so good. I literally told her I wanted something sweet with a little hint of amaretto and it was the perfect mix! The interior of this restaurant was pretty consistent with the theme. And overall the staff was really nice. We heard that the deep dish Square pizza was a big deal so we went ahead and tried it.

We were seated right away, but then waited 15 minutes to even be acknowledged by any server. As we were waiting, 4 servers were gathered around the counter service area. Some were eating and all were chatting away. We were having the conversation of getting up and leaving when our waiter came around. We were asked if we needed any more time to look over the menu. Seeing as we had been waiting 15 minutes, no extra time was needed. After receiving our food, the manager came around expectedly to ask how everything was. We let her know about the poor service. She brushed it off saying \\"yeah, he has tables all over the place.\\" There might have been 10 tables seated out of the 80 in there. AND all the while, there were staff enough for 2 tables per waiter. In the end, our waiter had to \\"get his manager to comp the kids meal\\" which was supposed to be free anyways!

When the chicken is ready, it has a flavorful skin and a moist, fall off the bone tenderness. Because your chicken couldn't possibly be any better, I'm going to share this secret. Take the white garlic sauce they give you and smother your chicken with it. You're welcome. \\n\\nNot only is their chicken the best on the planet, but their steak is mighty fine. Although having two dinners may be frowned upon, order the tostones and guacamole appetizer. Of course, the guac is homemade.

I'm very unhappy with the policies and procedures that Universal Orlando has implemented. I feel that those of us who do not have bags, coolers, strollers, wheelchairs or scooters etc should be allowed to pass freely through the metal detectors WITHOUT having to place our cell phones and wallets in the tub to be X-Rayed. If the metal detector goes off then by all mean use the wand over my body. I fail to see the benefits of X-Raying cell phones and billfolds for security. It only serves to slow down the process and I find it to be infuriating. Furthermore, your security staff are largely JERKS. Yes I said it. They treated me in a very rude and disrespectful manner. I was made to feel stupid and he acted like I was some sort of criminal for not wanting to have my cell phone and wallet X-Rayed. I feel that it's a waste of time and too invasive. Why can't you have a separate line for people with no bags? Your security measures are a step too far. Had I known in advance that I'd be subjected to this level of scrutiny I NEVER would have purchased my annual passes. As far as I'm concerned these measures are in place for appearances only. If someone really wanted to do harm it would take something rather larger than a cell phone or a billfold to do so. What should have been a fun filled day was ruined by your obnoxious security goons and security procedures that go too far. I have no desire to ever come back to your parks and sadly I'm stuck paying for the hugely expensive passes that will go unused.

While we were sad to have never tried it, we always hoped that another restaurant would come in and pick up the pieces. When we had to ditch on a downtown event during this past weekend due to weather, we saw that Sodo Sushi had moved in, so we decided to go and see if it could live up to the legend.\\n\\nWe went into the restaurant and our eyes immediately gravitated to Sodo Sushi's visual centerpiece - a huge and beautiful fish tank. The hostess greeted us and actually sat us down right next to the fish tank (which gave us plenty of time to talk about it and fish tanks in general). This restaurant is structured so that a bar (with 3 televisions on sports) is to the left and a few tables and booths are to the right. Luckily, the restaurant plays nice classical music rather than commentary from the televisions showing sports (which should only happen in bars), so we were able to feel classy while being able to keep an eye on the games.\\n\\nOnce we sat down, the waitress came out, gave us our menus, and explained a few of the food and drink options. The service throughout the meal (which included a shy guy who refilled my water many times and took plates away in a very polite manner) was great. IN terms of the options, while they do offer many of the typical Japanese restaurant options, this place also offers some more standard options, such as Sam Adams Oktoberfest, a seasonal beer that I've never seen at this type of restaurant. My wife put in an order for one of those, and then we both decided to get the Honey Garlic Shrimp (I got the fried rice despite the $1 upcharge because eating white rice just seems crazy to me) and a side order of the Juggernaut roll (see her review for the pictures). While I was worried that a shrimp dish wouldn't be filling, I figured this relatively cheap and fun side would complete the meal.\\n\\nBoth of our dishes and our sushi roll all came out after about 10-15 minutes. Each of our dishes contained about 10-15 pieces of shrimp, which was a great amount of shrimp for the price. The shrimp itself was very tasty and didn't include the tail shell, which is always a huge plus to me. The vegetables, which we were told were straight off a hibachi grill, were also very tasty and filling. \\n\\nHowever, the star of the show to me was the Juggernaut Roll. The roll, which includes real crab, avocado and cream cheese, was fantastic. The roll was well-constructed (always important), both crunchy and soft, and just generally delicious. Our waitress told us that this was one of their most popular dishes, and I can definitely see why.\\n\\nOverall, Sodo Sushi is a fantastic sushi place that stands apart because of its great sushi, tasty hot options, solid service, and fantastic atmosphere. It seems that OLV's legacy has been placed in great hands, and I look forward to hearing (and tasting) the legends they create moving forward."},{"name":"Keke's Breakfast Cafe","address":"282 Moore Rd","city":"Ocoee","stars":"3.5","text":"We have been coming to Kekes since it was called Florida Waffle shop.

The year before this joint shut down for good, the braintrust had a genius idea to create karma points by offering food to the heathen masses on the downtown eastside.  You'd think this was the ultimate in altruism?  Well, I did initially, until I saw what it really was - a marketing gimmick. There was nothing altruistic about it ... the sandwiches, cheap meat, mayo was mass purchased at costco (good for them) ... but while the *volunteers* were *invited* to *help out* the \\"organizers\\" insisted on asking for donations to cover the food cost (tacky a.f) ... and insisted on taking a million photos them for instagram ...   When a group of people went out to hand out the food, it was all about the instagram/ facebook/ twitter photos (and was it ever relentless) ... I started to question whether this was to help the less fortunate or to promote this business.  It gets worst: the braintrust then invited the *volunteers* back to the restaurant for *drinks* to thank them ... the impression was it was *on the house* for the hard work/ service ... oh boy,  was it a surprise when anyone that ordered a drink was given a bill for the beverage and food they consumed and, I believe, mandatory gratuity.  This is not the end of it. The *owner* had a book that he wrote, and it was passed off to everyone as a must read and then someone showed interest, there was a hard sell to buy it at full price .... um, no thanks.   So, from what originally was going to be a volunteer experience for the benefit of humanity, turned out to be more of a shakedown of the volunteers .... gross isn't it?   To this day, I find the backstory on the cava and zend and the ownership to be too good to be true .... seems like the earlier health products business failed for similar reasons (see Glassdoor for reviews) ...."},{"name":"Via 313 Pizza - East Side","address":"1802 E 6th St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"First time here and our server Uli really took care of us.

It's located in Mt Dora's little historic downtown and I stumbled upon it walking the streets.

There's some outdoor seating in this cute little courtyard at the entrance but walk past and you'll find the restaurants host stand.

It's laid out with several rooms, and after my dad mentioned it was probably a house before, the host confirmed it was in 1921. We came in on an early evening and enjoyed some happy hour cocktails and appetizers. My boyfriend ordered a Bloody Mary and I got the Jam, which you could choose your liquor type for, and it was delicious! Paired with freshly muddled berries. We ordered the falafel appetizer on the happier menu, which paired with a sauce to keep the dry texture away. \\n\\nI think what really wins this place over is the atmosphere. The color tones, unique artwork, wood slab bar top and solarium seating, coupled with the spread apart tables and modern style make it perfect for a date night. I took a peak at the menu and can't wait to try it. The menu changes a little daily/weekly depending on fresh ingredients, but based on what I've seen I bet I'd be happy with anything on it.

As I was bringing them inside the pizza restaurant a gal who worked there was coming out saw me and started getting mad at me. Saying things like \\"why are you doing that?\\" Why? Just no.\\" And I was like \\"oh the people who work across said I could bring it over...\\" and she was so RUDE. Kept saying I shouldn't have done that and shouldn't be helping out. LOL. What??! Ok. And I'm sorry if I was out of line somehow by helping out? We had massive loads of trash on all of the trays and I just wanted to make it a bit easier for them.

The burrito and two of the three tacos were prepared incorrectly. We felt that all items lacked flavor and could have really used at least some salt. \\n\\nThe whole kitchen line seemed chaotic. There was no organization - everyone seemed to be doing different tasks for different orders with no consistency. I appreciate the passion for food and opening a restaurant, but it seems like they really need someone in charge who knows how to run a kitchen.

The buttery lobster had a good amount of lobster for the price tag.  \\n\\nBUT I gave this place 2 stars because of the horrible service and frank discimination I experienced.

Instead of taking my order or getting someone to take it, the hostess (dark haired, accent, no name tag) would start to help me, then as soon as new customers showed up and wanted to be seated, she would tell me to hold on.   This happened at least four times!  In addition, instead of telling me right off the bat that they don't do raw foods as take out, and mussels counted as raw even if they were cooked, she would wait for me to order something then tell me no, she can't do that as a take out order.  This happened 3x!  Finally, when I had a question about something on the menu, she would just say she didn't know, stare at me, then would go back to helping other people.  The right thing to do would have been to ask someone else then get back to me.  All in all, it took me 15 minutes to place my order when it should have taken 5.\\n\\nI truly hope Row 34 management sees this review and corrects her lack of professional behavior.

Additionally, all the small bites were a hit (which is key, when you only have 1-2 bites to capture the senses). \\n\\nI preferred the small bites over the main courses, as I thought the Smoked troute had too many dehydrated shrimps which kinda made the texture a bit too crunchy and dry for my liking.

If you can get a low rate for an off season stay during the week, its absolutely work the extra price. The express passes are worth it!! Granted, the rates can sky rocket here based on demand and season, and there is a cap to what I would pay. We paid an average of 250$ + tax a night for a 2 queen and it was 150% worth this price. \\n\\n- The City Walk is incredible. Especially at night, it reminds me of a laid back (and more family friendly) Vegas Strip. Big lights, loud music, good food, and even a movie theatre! They have everything here and you don't even need to purchase admission to the parks to go. It was even more beautiful taking the water taxis to and from the hotel to the city walk each day.

I think we only had to wait for them a few times; they are always quick and efficient. Especially during the heat, you can't beat the open air and water. \\n\\n- The rides. Revenge of the Mummy is a MUST for the whole family. Other favorites were Escape from Gringotts, Kong, and MIB. \\n\\n- The scenery. Unlike Disney, Universal has kept up with their park and does a good job making even the adults feel like the world is larger than life. \\n\\n-Uber. Everything from Universal to Disney was very easy with Uber. \\n\\nTHE NOT SO GOOD:\\n\\n- The food. This is to be expected, but whether we ate at the parks or at the city walk or at our hotel, you are paying big prices for mediocre food. The best thing we had, by far, was the brunch at our hotel's restaurant. Oh, and dip n dots (which I  can't get in Texas anymore). \\n\\n- The shuttle. We added a 15$ two way shuttle to and from the airport. The ride to the airport wasn't as bad, but going to our hotel at 10pm sucked. The night time coordinator is rude, and told us and other families the wrong location for pickup and required us to call him each time to figure things out. Both drivers we had were very very nice, but the ride from the airport is already long enough without stopping at each hotel before we get to hours. Since we are paying a little more for the hotel, I kind of felt entitled to a shorter ride. Uber would have  cost more, but I wish we had done that for our ride to the hotel. \\n\\nSUMMARY:\\n\\nUniversal is the epitome of family friendly. Meaning, its not just KID FRIENDLY. They have something for literally everyone to enjoy. Even Suess land for the littlest ones, and the ability to child swap at the rides. Universal over Disney any day."},{"name":"Mozart's Coffee Roasters","address":"3825 Lake Austin Blvd","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"What a surprise this place is!\\n\\nIt's a pretty cafe on the side of river in Austin.

But the first piece I dove into (the umeda roll) completely fell apart. It was the best tasting of all three, but none of the pieces stayed put-together. Arugh! The sakura roll (spicy tuna & tempura prawn with chopped scallop on top) was okay, but it wasn't very spicy and the tuna mix was pretty mushy. And the spider roll wasn't extrodinary, but the crab portions were good and the sauce was delicious. Overall, the specialty rolls aren't the best I've had, but their umeda roll is probably the only one I'd go back for (provided it doesn't fall apart again).\\n\\nI also ordered a wakame salad, which was a bit soggier than I'm used to, but flavoured well. It's also a smaller portion size than some other places I've been to (but not by much). \\n\\nOverall it's an okay place that has lots of potential.

Also my first review of the New Year!\\n\\nI saved this 100th review for a place truly special.  Giacomo's is a Boston icon in the North End.  I think that anyone that lives in Boston should try to brave the ridiculous line and come out here at least once. So let me add one more 5 star review to the heap of 5 star reviews that this place has earned over the years. \\n\\nI happened to go during a cold winter's weekday and still there was a line. It was a far cry from the lines this place gets during summer weekends though.  They don't take reservations as with many of the popular places in the North End.  They also only take cash.\\n\\nThe seating in this place is tight.  You will be bumping elbows, knees, and other pointy body parts with the people next to you and those at the next table.  If you are seated next to the window you get to watch the hungry and jealous faces of those still waiting outside in line in the freezing cold, as they drool over your meal and pine for the warmth of the restaurant.  This can either be disturbing or strangely satisfying depending on your mood.\\n\\nWe came with a rather large party, which is always a challenge for this place.  Because we are Asian we passed all the food around so everyone got a taste of each dish.\\n\\nTwo in the party ordered and shared a Zuppa di pesce with Fracomo's sauce, which is a mix of Fra diavolo and Giacomo's sauces.  This was an absolutely enormous dish that cannot be finished by two mere mortal humans, even though the menu claims it is for 2 people.  The flavor was spot on and it was filled with what seemed like half of the New England Aquarium's worth of sea life.  \\n\\n I got the Frutti di mare with Fra Diavolo's sauce.  Seafood pasta with Fra Diavolo's sauce is my go to dish at Italian restaurants.  Overall this was a great dish, with large portions and great flavors.  I will say that Pomodoro's version of this dish is just a little bit better, with better flavors and textures.  However, Giacomo's version is a much larger serving and costs 19 dollars to Pomodoro's 25 dollars.   \\n\\nAnother person in our party was eyeing the lobster ravioli, however the waiter pointed him to the butternut squash ravioli instead.  This dish was also delicious with good flavors.  I will say that it was a bit sweet for my tastes and this was the only dish where the serving wasn't enormous.\\n\\nThe prices are less than most of the places in the North End.  This place could charge more than all of the other restaurants in the North End and get away with it.  Instead it chooses to undercut them.  Bravo.\\n\\nOverall Giacomo's is a sure bet for the North End.  It is an iconic North End Italian restaurant.  For people new to Boston or just visiting and want to visit THE Italian restaurant in the North End, Giacomo's is the place that you have to go to.  \\n\\nFor those native to Boston, I have a few other suggestions.   I've been finding that I've been going to the Giacomo's in Back Bay more often instead.  It takes reservations and is a lot more roomy.  It also has one of my favorite dishes strangely missing from the North End Menu, the Gnocchi.  This dish absolutely melts in your mouth.  If you are in the North End and are willing to pay a bit more, check out Pomodoro.  It is one of my favorite Italian restaurant in the North End because of it's divine sea food Fra Diavoli dish."},{"name":"Penn Station","address":"1257 W 5th Ave","city":"Columbus","stars":"2.5","text":"I love Penn Station sandwiches, especially the philly.

The menu is small but very customizable, and the five or so \\"signature\\" combos cover a surprisingly wide range of thoughtful flavor profiles.  Any one of their bowls is heartier and more interesting in terms of flavor and texture than most non-vegan salads you will encounter elsewhere.  Many of their vegetable ingredients are pickled, cured, marinated, broiled, or even fermented, and their proteins and legumes range beyond the typical chickpeas and quinoa to include sesame, crisped lentils, Asian black beans, edamame... I could go on and on about their awesome ingredients.  \\n\\nAnother bonus here is portion control.  You can choose two bases for each bowl, so if you go with two leafy green bases you can have a lighter salad, but if you do two grain bases you will have quite a heavy, filling meal.  I usually do one of each, with their marinated kale and brown-rice-quinoa pilaf as my two bases, and I find that to be a perfect balance.  My favorite signature dish is the Seoul Bowl, because I really enjoy the slight spice of the gochujang with the sharp kick of the kimchi, but I have honestly loved everything I've ever tasted here.\\n\\nThey have limited seating which does get quite crowded during peak hours, but they have a very efficient online ordering system for pickup.

The jerk chicken was definitely spicy, as the 3-4 peppers indicated on the menu. However, it wasn't very flavorful... it was just hot (maybe flavored with cheap jalapenos?)  I got the dark meat, which was a pretty small piece of drumstick & thigh. For $7, I'd liked to have a little more meat. They did pack on the (cheap) rice, which had jerk sauce poured on top. Without the sauce, the rice would've been flavor-less and hard to eat. The plantains were just so-so; I've definitely had better elsewhere.

I have to admit it's been a while since my last visit. Our family has grown in size since we were able to vacation in Orlando and traveling with toddlers can be a bit difficult. \\n\\nYears ago when we first discovered Raglan Road, it was great because my husband and I were able to drink cold beers and enjoy the live performances.  The Springs also seemed a bit more open and airy. The parking lot was just one level so you could park and easily walk right in. \\n\\nNow fast forward a few years and things have definitely changed. The parking lot is gone and has been replaced with huge parking garages around most of the Springs. We found the closest garage near Raglan Road and found a parking spot on the first floor. After getting the stroller out, we were a bit annoyed seeing we couldn't just walk right in. We had to take an elevator to the second floor of the parking garage, walk to some escalators across a catwalk, and since we had a stroller had to take some nearby elevators once again to reach the first floor.  The whole setup just seemed poorly planned. \\n\\nWhen we made our way to Raglan Road, it was about 230 in the afternoon and there was no hostess to be seen. The sign by the hostess station said to wait to be seated, but after waiting for about five minutes we were wondering if we were suppose to seat ourselves. Finally a waitress came up and apologized. She explained the hostess must have went on break. She then asked us to park our stroller outside the restaurant.  I was a bit confused at first because there was only two other families dining in the restaurant. One even had their stroller with them. My husband told her it was fully collapsible (which it was. It's approved for airplane overhead storage) and so the waitress said it would be fine to bring it in. My guess she was just making the request because it's probably the norm during high volume hours. So if you have a family with small children, be prepared to have to park the stroller outside during busier hours. \\n\\nWe ordered some food for our girls and my husband got wings while I ordered the lobster sandwich. As per usual with Disney, the children's meal was absolutely fantastic. I cannot rave enough how conscientious Disney is about making sure kids eat healthy, quality food. Hands down they put 99% of most restaurants to shame. However, my husband and I weren't as impressed with our meals.  His chicken wings were soggy and slimy. It was like they boiled the chicken and coated them with a thick sauce. Honestly, what I think happened was that they were fried, coated, and left under the warming light for a bit before they were brought out.  My lobster sandwich was great, but FYI it's a cold lobster sandwich. That doesn't make it bad, but I just prefer warmer lobster sandwiches like the Connecticut style lobster rolls. \\n\\nThe waitress was nice enough to re-fire my husband's wings, but the look on her face was pretty funny. She looked a bit annoyed when my husband described them as slimy so there was a brief moment where you could see she wasn't too happy having to deal with a re-fire. Nonetheless, she was apologetic and got hot, crispy wings out to my husband rather quickly. \\n\\nOverall, we still enjoyed our visit to Raglan Road. Would we go back again?  Probably not until our kids are a bit older. Until then, it's just not worth the hassle of driving over to the Springs or catching the tram from one of the resorts"},{"name":"Ruth's Chris Steak House","address":"45 School St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"Meat was so overly seasoned.

There are, of course, plenty of other choices -- the boy enjoyed the key lime pie -- but I have yet to branch out beyond the cream horn.\\n\\nThis place would get four stars, except for the following:\\n- The decor is fading.  Perhaps they're going for an \\"aged\\" appearance, but it's starting to look just plain \\"old.\\"  \\n- The chairs and tables in the non-dining area are way too close together.  The boy and I come here in the evening, and there aren't many people, but if someone were to try and sit at any of the tables immediately adjacent to ours, it would be like sitting at the same table.\\n- The waitstaff is confused.  We usually are helped or asked if we need help by at least two or three different people since it's not always clear who is helping whom.\\n- Granted, we usually come around dinnertime, but STOP ASKING IF WE ARE JOINING YOU FOR DINNER.  You're a bakery.  If I were here for dinner, I would tell you that.  Let me browse your glorious display of sugary sweetness without feeling pressured to eat dinner.\\n\\nThe last time we were here, a couple of heavily made-up teenage girls came in and one asked, \\"So, do you have birthday cakes here?\\"  The waiter showed them a beautifully decorated, European-style, round chocolate cake, but when they heard the price was $24, they quickly backtracked and went in search of something cheaper.  Moments like that make me feel like Mozart's is probably underappreciated by a lot of people who really just want a cheap pink frosted Kroger cake.\\n\\nStill, I always feel like I've escaped Columbus for a little while when I come here.  Then I walk out the door and nearly get run over by bicyclists, joggers, or people who just don't watch where they're going.  Seriously.  it's happened every time I come here."},{"name":"Pino's Pizza","address":"1920 Beacon St","city":"Brighton","stars":"4","text":"Hands down best meatball and egg sub in the city.

I tried the following baos:\\n\\nHogzilla - Served with a thick, savory, delicious slice of pork belly. I actually got this 2-3 times because you can't go wrong with pork belly. \\n\\nFirecracker shrimp - Actually one of my favorites. I love shrimp. It's crunchy, flavorful and delicious as well. Everything about this bao was pretty much perfect. \\n\\nOMG \\"Oh My Grouper\\" - Served with tempura grouper. The kim chi slaw was tasty. \\n\\nThe Inner Harbor - Comes with crab cake. I thought the crab cake was pretty decent but as a bao, delish. \\n\\nMy favorite would be a tie between firecracker shrimp and hogzilla. Honestly you can't go wrong with any of them.

The restaurant is best enjoyed with a large group of people, where loud conversation can help overlook the hit or miss quality of the food. \\n\\nThe service is decent, and much better for large groups compared to small groups. One time, when I went to eat there by myself, I was chased by the waitress upon leaving the restaurant because she thought that I didn't leave a tip. As it turns out, she had miscounted the number of bills I placed on the table. That experience definitely put a bad taste in my mouth. \\n\\nMy absolute favorite dish, hands down, is the Stir-Fry Egg and Tomato. The scrambled, slightly watery eggs combine with the sweet juices of the tomato to form a dish that almost melts in my mouth. I could probably live off of this dish if I wanted to. Some other favorites include the Scallion Pancakes, which are perfectly crispy, and Chicken Fried Rice, which I like mostly because it's hard to screw up fried rice. \\n\\nOne of the dishes I regret trying is the Sesame Chicken, which tasted and smelled like ketchup.

When I tasted it, I thought it was good, but I personally think would've been better if the waffle was a bit crispier. I also liked the fact that this caf√© makes payments easy here with their payment by phone option so that we didn't have to wait for them to print it out.

Really good sized portions and prices"},{"name":"The Albert","address":"918 Austin Ave","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"The Albert is a neighborhood restaurant-bar located in Inman Park behind Fritti and Sotto Sotto. While its storefront faces Austin Avenue, there are actually two entrances: (1) in the front via Austin Avenue and (2) in the back where there's a small, free parking lot. More often than not, you'll have to park on the street. Be sure to read the signs as some stretches of road are permit parking only during certain periods.\\n\\nThis is a popular local hangout with many loyal followers. The casual, laid back atmosphere is warm and welcoming. The staff is nice. I like that there are plenty of TVs here, perfect for watching sports. It's a solid alternative to chain sports bars such as Hudson Grille and Taco Mac. They've even hosted Walking Dead watch parties.\\n\\nThe interior is divided into two rooms. One room features a long bar that seats just over a dozen. It's got a few booths (with coat hooks) and a high six-top. The other room is more like a dining room, sporting a mixture of regular and high-top tables as well as counter seating that faces the open kitchen with flat-top griddle and prep station.\\n\\nFood-wise, The Albert is known for its Diner Burger which consists of two beef patties, two slices of cheese, mayo, mustard, pickle, and onion. Then there's the Albert Burger which comes with pimento cheese and bacon. You can also customize your own burger. Overall, the fare is pub grub and includes items such as deviled eggs, salads, sandwiches, wings, chili, chicken tenders, ribs, and hot dogs. Prices are reasonable as most plates are each $10-12 or less.\\n\\nHere's a rundown of items I've tried:\\n\\nBurgers and sandwiches:\\n* The Albert Burger - two thin patties, pimento cheese, bacon, pickled red onion\\n* Chicken breast \\"burger\\" with bacon (custom order)\\n* Patty Melt - two thin patties, grilled onions, American cheese, house sauce\\n* Brisket Melt - braised brisket, Swiss, veggies, mayo, au jus.\\n\\nAppetizers, sides, and salads:\\n* Smoked Wings\\n* Chili - 3rd place Chomp and Stomp chili\\n* Fried Pickles - battered pickle chips with ranch\\n* Kale Salad - goat cheese, cranberries, pecans, house vinaigrette\\n* Bacon Creamed Corn\\n* Mac and Cheese\\n* Baked Beans\\n\\nThe Albert Burger is OK. I like that it's a meaty burger, but the patties are cooked to a pre-defined temperature which tastes almost like a dried-out well done to me. I prefer my burgers cooked medium rare or medium. The bacon is deliciously thick and gratifying. I can't comment on the pimento cheese because there's barely any on the burger. The chicken breast used in the burgers is alright. It's satisfactorily tender and tasty, but also tastes like a generic, previously frozen piece of chicken.\\n\\nThe Patty Melt and Brisket Melt fare better. I'm a fan of the lightly toasted and buttered, appetizing and chewy bread used for the melts. The Patty Melt utilizes the same beef patties as the burgers. The Brisket Melt has a decent amount of brisket, but some of the chunks are unpleasantly fatty. The \\"veggies\\" included with the Brisket Melt are carrots (and there are barely any to speak of). The au jus sauce is excessively salty and therefore not needed.\\n\\nThe Smoked Wings aren't bad. The wings come with celery and a couple different sauces. The wings are moderately meaty and the skin has a firm texture. The kale salad is quite good with fresh crisp kale tossed with just the right amount of delectable vinaigrette. The goat cheese is a perfect topping to the greens.\\n\\nThe other apps and sides are unfortunately disappointing. The Chili is way too salty. Because the meat is so finely ground, the chili has a consistency akin to sambal paste. Perhaps I just tried a poorly prepared batch. The Fried Pickles have a lot of hard, crunchy batter. Some good-sized pieces seem to contain nothing but batter. I hate to say it, but the Creamed Corn and Mac and Cheese taste out of a can or instant. The watery and bland Mac and Cheese reminds me of Easy Mac. Though there's plenty of smoky flavor, the Baked Beans fall flat because they are overly salty, pasty, and somewhat dry.\\n\\nIn summary, stick with the burgers, melts, and wings (and kale salad if you're feeling healthy).\\n\\nService is good. To-go orders and leftovers are placed in environmentally-friendly biodegradable boxes."},{"name":"Atlanta Breakfast Club","address":"249 Ivan Allen Jr Blvd","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4.5","text":"We visited on Sunday during brunch hours, party of two joined the waitlist online and still had to wait an additional 25 mins  so the wait was about a little over an hour.

Not only is The Porter my absolute favorite place to go to in Atlanta..but it's on my top 5 gastro pubs I have been to around the United States. You first walk in and notice the ambiance of the place. Old school, woody, very warm, pleasantly dive barish and people having a great time. Then the long line of beer taps and huge selection of whiskey is a big plus. You sit at the bar and get handed the beer menu that's thicker than a Webster's Dictionary. There is every legendary hard to get beer you could want in there as well as all the different vintages throughout the years you could order as well. \\n\\nThe food menu changes regularly from what I was told, which is important. I wasn't too hungry but I had to try the foie gras. Basically it was their take on a peanut butter and jelly as it was served with sweet bread rolls and the foie has a jelly around it. Sounds weird but it was insanely delicious. I also had some pork bao sandwiches topped with kimchi that were quite tasty. Plates were small, so order a couple things. You can't go wrong with anything on the menu. \\n\\nI'm pretty good on my own but being from Chicago on a work trip I was by myself and the bartenders had that Southern hospitality you always hear about and made me super welcomed.

Also, if you get the bottomless drinks, you can refill it with a different drink every time- it doesn't have to be the original drink you ordered. \\n\\nI felt like it was a good place to study, but if you can't focus with loud background noise, this might not be an optimal study spot for you."},{"name":"Antico Pizza","address":"1093 Hemphill Ave NW","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"TLDR: If you're looking for a spot for pretty good pizza that's also BYOB, this is the place.\\n\\nAs someone who's not from Atlanta, I've been told this is one of the places all Atlantans should visit at least one in their life. Antico has a couple of locations now, but I definitely love the neighborhood pizza joint kind of feel the Westside location has to it. \\n\\nBeing a stone's throw from the Georgia Tech campus, this place is pretty walkable to get to. If you insist on driving, there is a small lot right next to  restaurant, but if you're not lucky, you can try the side streets for parking. Obviously with this place being BYOB, you're probably better off just using Lyft, Uber, etc.\\n\\nAs far as BYOB, you can also bring wine and spirits, and they have extra cups on each table in case you forget to bring your own. I've personally been a part of beer shares here and it's a great spot to share drinks with a couple of friends if you can get seating. It's communal seating here, which makes for a unique atmosphere and don't be surprised to strike up a conversation with some strangers at your table. \\n\\nFood wise, the pizza is pretty good. I definitely wouldn't say it's the best I've ever had, but it's pizza I would have again and again. It's somewhat higher on the price point for pizza, as they start at $19 and go as high as $27. I personally really like the Diavola ($22), which is basically salami, peppers, and mozzarella. If you like a little spiciness on your pizza, I think this is the way to go. If you're decently hungry, one pizza should feed two, maybe three people. \\n\\nThe pizza comes out pretty fast, which is especially impressive during peak hours.

They have two huge rooms with communal tables and has a cabin-like feel to it.\\n\\nWe drove up from Austin (32min Uber ride) and waited about 15 minutes before getting called in. Short wait was probably bc we got here around 12 noon and it was New Year's Day, so they weren't super busy. The food here was good but wasn't worth the 30 min drive. This was our second bbq joint in Austin and compared to Terry's... we enjoyed that much more. I believe they have a completely different way of barbecuing, which might be the reason why we prefer Terry's over Salt Lick. \\n\\nFor our meat, we had the brisket, beef rib, bison rib and the chicken. All which were pretty good but also very fatty. My favorite of the 4 where probably the chicken and the brisket. Also loved their bread and sauces! \\n\\nOverall this place is a bit overhyped and I probably wouldn't go back for a second time.

The ony food which was safe for myself is their potatoes. They were over-seasoned and not impressive. They do have breakfast bagels, and other better looking plates but none of them are safe for me. They also have the option of a bagal-less  sandwich, which consists of egg. If you want to add meat so you have egg and meat, you're looking at just shy of ten for one egg and a sausage. That's a bit steep. I purchased a basic latte and it was noticably more bitter than when I bought them at the old location.

Well, in March this year, we decided to change things up a bit. We still got fish and chips from Pajos but we only ordered a small serving to save room for our visit to Ichiro.\\n\\nThis restaurant is super busy and was practically full as soon as they opened. Their menu is rather extensive so it's a bit difficult to decide what to order. I like that their menu is more typical of a Japanese restaurant instead of the generic \\"sushi\\" places that you find all over town.\\n\\nThe Sashimi Boat Set ($30) was the first to arrive and contained an assortment of sashimi... including tuna, salmon, yellowtail, surf clam, octopus, sweet shrimp, red tuna, and white fish. It also came with chicken karaage, spring roll, steamed rice, and miso soup.\\n\\nThe sashimi, as expected in a seafood community like Steveston, was super fresh. The only bad thing was that the sashimi boat came out so early that it was practically finished by the time my meal finally arrived.\\n\\nAfter quite a wait, my Wanko & Sashimi ($27.95) finally arrived and included miso soup, assorted tempura, wanko soba, sashimi, and my choice of rice dish.\\n\\nIn my set, I picked the Bara Chirashi which is rice topped with chopped up pieces of tuna, salmon, tamago, as well as ikura and cucumbers.\\n\\nWanko refers to the small bowls of soba noodles in my set and originates from the Iwate Prefecture of Japan. My set included two bowls of cold noodles (one topped by a soft poached egg and the other topped with ikura and grated daikon).\\n\\nLike the sashimi boat that we had earlier, the sashimi in my set was super fresh and included tuna, salmon, yellowtail, and sweet shrimp.\\n\\nOverall, the food was quite good and the seafood was super fresh. Service was a bit slow but I'm assuming that's because they were so busy. Also, the restroom was a bit of a mess.

We opted for the 10-course tasting menu, the \\"Ultimate Cragie Experience.\\" The first two courses, however small, were absolutely awesome. A trio of one-bite seafood items that each tasted incredibly perfect, followed by a scallop and melon ceviche that might have topped the first.

Good, but certainly not on par with the first two courses. \\n\\nThings got back on track with the pasta course, a bolognese that was simply spectacular (and I'd never said that about any pasta dish before). Things fell backward again with the final two savory courses, veal sweetbreads and a trio of lamb. Two were so-so, one was quite good. \\n\\nAnd then three dessert courses. Three! But none were all that good or all that substantial. A golf-ball size serving of sorbet, pana cotta, and a shot glass of peach tea foam. \\n\\nThe setting is quite nice, one can be mesmerized by the open kitchen. But I found our primary server to be a little short, uninterested in answering any questions we had.

I heard the customer in line before me say the same thing while watching the server pick up lettuce leaves one at a time. The manager said ingredients are expensive and they dont want to raise prices.

I ordered a cheese calzone with meatball, eggplant and ricotta. The total order came to about $14 and I opted to pay cash. When the driver arrived he just shrugged and said he didn't have change. I understand you can't expect them to break large bills but how do you not have change for a $20?! I wasn't going to refuse to pay for my order (though at this point I'm wishing I had) so I handed the guy his $6 tip. \\n\\nAfter that I could have used a really good calzone but was again disappointed. I'm giving 2 stars because the meatball and eggplant were flavorful -  but with no marinara or sauce (maybe it was just missing?) every bite was just dry and bready. The toppings were all in the center so each end of the calzone was just a flavorless hunk of bread. Worst of all, the Ricotta seems to have gone sour. Nothing about this experience was worth the $20.

It was a really nice early Friday night and the amount of natural light coming in was perfect for happy hour and a relaxing early dinner. (I heard it gets loud in here, so going just before 6pm allowed us to avoid any of that)\\n\\nThe Rocco's Tacos happy hour offers $2 off any drink and a handful of $7 options for bar bites like queso, empanadas, tacos, etc. That also meant I was drinking Corona Light draft for only $4, which is a steal at a place like this. \\n\\nMeanwhile, the beautiful company I kept on this evening was enjoying the tequila selection quite a bit. She enjoyed not one, but two, Cadillac margaritas and then topped that off with the free shot of tequila that comes with any entree when you check in on Yelp.\\n\\nWith happy hour and Yelp discounts, those three tequila drinks ran $21...but she paid a lot more for it later in the night and early the next day when she went to work. I was fine since I only tasted the tequila on her lips, as I have not touched that poison since 1992.\\n\\nThe queso was excellent. I don't want to offered Rocco's with a comparison to a fast casual chain, but I liked it as much as I like the queso at Chili's. The texture, color and spice was similar to me. Also, Rocco's give you chips, veggies and even offered us tortillas on request for dipping. \\n\\nOur tacos were not a disappointment either. Carne Asada had instant flavor, chicken was plentiful and the pork was juicy and stood out as the best one of the variety were ordered. \\n\\nOur service and attention was as enjoyable as the atmosphere of the restaurant.\\n\\nNow why is there a little old TV showing \\"The Empire Strikes Back\\" right near the entrances to the bathroom? Is there some Star Wars connection to this restaurant that I don't know about or do they give you a free Colt 45 if you mention you're a Billy Dee Wiliams fan?\\n\\nOne blatant negative. The valet parking is completely unnecessary. I hate when Tampa or Orlando restaurants do this. Rocco's Tacos has a good size parking lot right out front and there's absolutely no reason to block it off. I don't want a stranger driving my car and blocking off all these spaces is more of an inconvenience than the so-called convenience of offering this service."},{"name":"Pok Pok NW","address":"1639 NW Marshall St","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"I've never been to a Taiwanese restaurant before and had very little knowledge beyond Thai tea.

Good for them if they are still riding the novelty of this but it seems to me the chef's heart is now at Kirkland, Main just seems to have the same arrogance c. 2006 but no longer the goods to back it up.  Seems like the place is based on \\"attitude\\" (the chef, not Maws, whoever cooks when he's not there) seemed to be angry for effect, yelling etc.  If I want hostile work environment, I can get that at the office!  Too many servers double-teaming our table, all more polite and poised than actually effective.   Felt like it was work to be there.   Maybe it's had its run.   Worth hitting the burger if you've never been, but if you're looking for similar food at this level without the production, try Alcove or Puritan.

I eat supremes and love pepperoni. If it has golden brown spots on top, crispy-edged pepperoni, and stretches when you pull a slice it means its good.

That's not \\"authentic\\", but if \\"authentic\\" pizza is supposed to taste like burnt, soggy saltines with watery buffalo mozz with a hot arugula and prosciutto on top, it can shove it. \\n\\nThis, is the exception.

Now, it totally got soggy in the middle which I hate, but I could live with that because the favor was good and at least half of the slice had decent crust. The weakest aspect of the pizza was that I found the sausage mediocre and sparing (\\"the food at this place is terrible... and such small portions!\\"). Yhey allow you to get toppings such as parmesan and hot chilis- I grabbed some hot chili oil and drizzled it over my pizza and that was the bomb. \\n\\nI still prefer \\"American\\" style pizza but honestly, if you have to jump on the \\"authentic\\" pizza train, this place is legit."},{"name":"Art Cafe","address":"264 Peters St SW","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4.5","text":"Ok so my review before still remains, just wanted to update my review on when I had the chance to actually sit down and eat..\\nAs always the food was amazing and so was the service.

While the place was active, it wasn't overly busy, and the service seemed disorganized at best. \\n\\nVisit #2, it was late afternoon and hardly anyone was in the restaurant, so we thought we'd try again to get some actual food. Got prompt friendly service and ordered the house-made potato chips with curry (yum!), lobster mac + cheese and wings, not bad.\\n\\nMy last visit was with a group of about eight friends for a drag show. Ordered the chicken and waffles and wasn't given the \\"this is going to take longer than everyone else's food\\" caveat (and stupidly, I hadn't read the reviews here or I would've known this...) So they brought my c+w with everyone else's food, and I cut into the chicken and it's raw. They take the chicken back, leaving me with the waffle, which I eat out of desperation when I realize it's been ages and my chicken hasn't come back. After the show we finally flag down our waiter and he brings back my thoroughly cooked chicken, so I eat about half of it while we finish our drinks. The manager stops by, apologizes and says he'll take it off my bill. We then ask the waiter for our checks and I ask for a box for the rest of my chicken. We get the checks, the chicken and waffles is still on my bill AND I don't get a box.

This bar is the new tenant in the constantly rotating chain of businesses to occupy the former Cucina Cucina space in the Rose Quarter. I don't really ever have high expectations from a place reliant upon seasonal business related to games and events. Would I come here for dinner? No. Do I expect the standards and quality that I come to expect from the Portland craft restaurant/bar scene? No. Do I hope for something better than what the catering in the Modaboat will offer at the game? Maybe. \\n\\nBut really I come here for the same reason most people do - because I want a pre-game drink and I don't want to be limited to what is served up in the Modaboat. And on that note, Dr. Jack's is just fine. The beers are $7, which would be a travesty anywhere but in a captive-audience situation. However there are limited options in the immediate area, and so we pay for convenience. \\n\\nThe beer list is actually pretty damn impressive for a stadium setting. There are quite a few local beers on tap - real micros not just the big names - and even a Widmer on-site brew that changes seasonally. There is a craft cocktail menu but with the speed and volume at which drinks are being slung out of this bar, I'd hesitate to bite on that bait. Instead I'll take comfort in the fact that they have a well-stocked spirits selection for me to peruse. Most sports/arena settings only have the big brand name spirits, and here there's Fernet, some off-brand bourbons and the like. Don't get me wrong. This is no Spirit of '77, which would be a much more advisable stop if you really want to score a great cocktail within walking distance of the game. But since I haven't tried them here, I can't knock them (yet). I believe they run around $12 per cocktail, so while that's a tad inflated, recall the setting you're in, oh captive audience. \\n\\nThe space is the same as it has been since they gutted the last attempted restaurant in there. It can get packed, but large rolling doors open on the outdoor area, so it doesn't feel stuffy even when crammed to the gills.\\n\\nAll in all, this is one of the better incarnations of this venue in recent years. Roll in with proper expectations and you're not likely to be too disappointed.

In this particular case, it was not the aforementioned.\\n\\nI ordered a trio of appetizers, including ravioli, fried zucchini and stuffed mushrooms.  First, they got the ravioli wrong, and gave me calamari.  No big deal...but then they just replaced it with ravioli, rather than replacing the entire, touched meal.

Atmosphere is lovely. Prices are high. I was disappointed with the owner's response when I asked to use their secure wifi. She seemed a bit annoyed when I said my employer requires me to not work on an open network and said most people are fine with the ease of no password. I could see they have two secured networks.

I've spent lots of time searching for places that can compete in New York City, San Francisco, Portland, Oregon, Chicago, and more, and nothing has ever come close.\\n\\nThe draft selection is large (around 35 or 40 now that they recently upgraded) and the bottled selection is *massive* (400+ beers). The thing that makes the selection here special, however, is the fact that not a single one of those 430+ beers is anything less than extraordinary. If you don't like a beer here, it's basically only because you don't like that particular style of beer. Just about any style of beer you can think of gets 10+ varieties in the bottle section. The variety is excellent -- the bottles and the taps always have a good mix of different beer styles as well as different origins (both from across the U.S. and from all corners of the world, including interesting, high-quality beers from micro-breweries in countries that aren't even among the usual suspects). As I learned on my last visit, they've apparently recently started a vintage program and opened a beer cellar, and the selection there looked vast as well. To top it off, the draft and bottle lists (but not the vintage list, for good reason) comes with complete tasting notes. Every single beer, even each of the hundreds of bottled beers, includes a brief but complete picture of what to expect from that beer.\\n\\nThe food here is also wonderful. The regular menu is mostly pub fare done up great. Highlights include the herby, garlicky Belgian fries, the goat cheese fritters, the shrimp and grits, and the Buffalo Shrimp Po-Boy. The specials get much more creative and lean towards what you might expect from a so-called \\"New American\\" restaurant. I love the regular menu so much that I sadly haven't ventured into the specials as often as I should, but the things I have tried, such as a pork belly salad dish, have been phenomenal. I suspect that on average, it might be true that the specials outshine the already great regular menu, so try to get one of them.\\n\\nService is always on-target and all the servers and bartenders know the menu in-depth and can make recommendations even to relative newcomers to serious beer. The atmosphere is cozy and well-done -- an exposed brick wall and high ceilings combine with lots of wood to give a proper neighborhood pub feel to the place.\\n\\nTo me, one of the best things about the Porter is that all this excellence in food and drink comes without a trace of pretension. Not a single thing about this bar and restaurant is overdone or over-hyped, and the proprietors, employees, and customers are all here for the sake of enjoyment and passion about the beer and food -- not for a show or a pat on the back. I find this to be a common theme among Atlanta establishments, and something which is sadly frequently missing in the food and drink \\"scene\\" in some other cities as well as in other great beer bars in other parts of the country. Overall, the Porter shines and is among my favorite spots in Atlanta as well as nationwide."},{"name":"Southern Belle","address":"1043 Ponce De Leon Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4.5","text":"Great food, good cocktails, all in a comfortable cozy setting. I haven't been this impressed with a new Atlanta restaurant in a few years. Each bite was filled with marvelous flavors and interesting textures. So many high points throughout the meal.  Our favorite was the \\"ceviche like in Peru\\". Every bite was tasty and full of complex flavors, but throughout the meal there were very few missteps. The chestnut gnocchi and blue crab beau monde were also standouts. Our only complaint was that the Brussels sprouts were a tad too salty, but still edible and full of flavor.\\n     The service was fast, friendly, and inviting. The cocktails were good as well. Our favorites were the aviation, and the doc nam. From the service to the food and drinks, everything at Southern Belle was definitely top notch.

It was loaded with such a  good assortment of fresh (cooked perfectly)vegetables. not one was over cooked or going rancid. still retained a nice crunch and snap. \\nit had zucchini, snow peas, button mushrooms, broccoli, carrots, green beans, onions and green onions. this is  what any vegan or vegetarian hopes  for when ordering a curry with vegetables. the only thing I would adjust would be the heat level I requested medium...... next time I'll kick it up a notch. \\n\\nthe papaya salad was very good too; and,  memorable. it was spiced Thai hot, and they brought the heat.

I said that I was disappointed, especially with the pineapple curry. she nicely asked me what was wrong with the curry and I tried without being rude to explain to her how it lacked vegetables in a big way. I showed her a photo of the panang curry from Anchan. she looked at the photo and was surprised at the beautiful array of vegetables. and she said. no we dont use zucchini, that restaurant must be a Thai fusion not a true Thai restaurant referring to Anchan... my only addition comment was that my curry also  had lettuce in it. she said no its cabbage and she looked at my plate and she noticed the lettuce I had set  aside from the curry. \\n\\nif I'm ever back east again I hope to have the chance to enjoy your food Anchan House of Thai."},{"name":"Pokeatery","address":"1201 Barbara Jordan Blvd, Ste 1410","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Wow.

The tostones were perfectly crisp, and the guac was jam packed with flavor.  My dad also ordered the Chicharr√≥n con Arepa, which was a dish I had never tried before; while definitely unhealthy, it was crispy and very tasty.  I had the Breaded Boneless Pork Loin with sweet plantains, and was very impressed.  My mom really enjoyed her salad, and my boyfriend liked his pork.

While the food was mostly OK, the overall service we experienced throughout was terrible and borderline rude.\\n\\nWe made reservations well in advance because of the touristy nature of the place, but when we arrived we were given what was literally the worst seat in the place - a high-top table 2 feet from the bar and 2 feet from the kitchen entrance for the staff. I tried to point this out to the hostess, but she bolted away after dropping off menus and not saying a word to us. We stood there awkwardly until I flagged down a manager passing by.\\n\\nThroughout our entire meal, our server did everything she could to rush us along so she could get another set of customers in. Our entrees came out when we were only about halfway through our appetizers; 5 minutes into our entrees, she was asking if we wanted to see dessert menus. After I told her we were still enjoying our entrees and to ask again later, she dropped off dessert menus a few minutes later. She came to ask us about dessert again while I was still chewing my dinner. It really soured the whole experience (which was only average to begin with).\\n\\nAs for the food, the table-side guacamole here is really well-done, and probably the thing they absolutely get right the most often. We had hoped to have several drinks, but the first 2 margaritas we had were so poorly mixed (one was practically undrinkable), we stopped at the first round. Unfortunately for their bartender (and us), overloading  tequila into a margarita does not necessarily make it better. For a place with \\"Tequila Bar\\" in their name, I feel 100% that their bartenders should make well-crafted margaritas.\\n\\nThe rest of the food we had (chile rellenos, carne molcajete for one) was decent - the molcajete meals are not mind-blowing, but they allow you to be gluttonous and get the flavors you're looking for. If you do guacamole, 2 people could easily share the molcajete-for-one. Their in-house corn tortillas are always good. Most dishes push flour tortillas to come with them, so be sure to ask to swap them out. The dessert that we eventually ordered after we actually finished our meal, turned out to be good. But, by that point, we were ready to over with this place and wishing we had picked a different place to celebrate."},{"name":"Pambiche","address":"2811 NE Glisan St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"I came here with a friend for dinner on a Saturday night!

Almost five years ago I moved to Vancouver, right next to this sushi place. At the time I would be giving this place a 5 star review, the food was extremely cheap (the sushi special was three rolls and miso for $5.95), portion sizes were huge, quality of the sushi was amazing. Service wasn't always the best except for a couple key servers, but the place was always packed so it was understandable especially since I don't think I've really seen more than one server there at a time very often. Was easily the best sushi place in the city.\\n\\nNow fast forward to recent times. I may live farther away now but still downtown and still stop in fairly frequently when I get the chance, including yesterday, and my experience has pretty much been like this for awhile now...start with pricing, the food has gradually gone up in price over the years, but in a noticeable way. And not just because the price went up, but it's noticeable because the portion size has considerably decreased. That 3 roll and miso sushi special now costs $8.50, but all the rolls are now about half the size of what they were back when that combo cost $5.95. Yesterday, half of my California rolls didn't even have crab in them, just avocado. As for the service, much worse, the guy working yesterday didn't even once look up from the computer the entire time I was there, even when he went to pack up skip the dishes orders and whatnot, he avoided looking up into the dining room. Never got refills on water, or the tea I asked for. My food sat up on the pass for like 10 minutes before he brought it over despite him being right there the entire time. If you don't want to be a server, then don't, I have been working in the industry about a decade now and people like that need to find new jobs, because being a server you are one of the faces of the business, if you can't be bothered to care about your customers, you're ultimately going to be a factor in ruining the business you work for. \\n\\nAnd I hate to say it, but that's where Umeda is going. Every time I've been in there recently, I've been the only person there, occasionally there might be one other table. I used to have to wait for a seat to free up years ago. It's upsetting, because this used to be my favourite sushi place in the city, but between the service, increased prices, and decreased portion sizes, this place has well...literally gone to shit (and on the note of shit, it's been almost five years, is it really that hard to put a door on the toilet stall in the men's washroom? No one wants to watch someone actually take a shit).\\n\\nI worry for this place, it used to be the best, but now it's gotten so bad I feel like their bad decisions will put them out of business soon..."},{"name":"Art Cafe","address":"264 Peters St SW","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4.5","text":"Love this restaurant.

I have never been to a casual seafood-based restaurant so I wasn't really sure what to expect. When you enter, you go up to the counter and place your order then they will bring out your food to you once it is ready. The menu has a variety of options from chicken to fish to shrimp but mainly seafood. Most of the entrees come with a side or two for about $10 or a little more. I decided to get tacos since I could get different types and try them all out. I ordered a fish, shrimp, and chicken taco with black bean/corn as my side. \\n\\nThey are know for the Piri Piri sauce which comes on some of the items but also have bottles next to the soda machine. There's a few different kinds ranging from mild to hot in terms of spice. Within a few minutes, our food came to us and I actually received rice with my tacos as well so that was a nice surprise. The tacos themselves were filled with cabbage instead of lettuce and seemed to take up the majority of the room which was not proportional to the actual meat/seafood inside. My favorite had to be the shrimp taco as the chicken was bland and the fish was just ok. The Piri Piri sauces added a nice touch to bring some extra flavor. \\n\\nMy meal would have cost a little more than $10 at regular price but with a Scoutmob it was a steal. It's a little pricey for the quality for the food but I guess you are paying for seafood which tends to be more expensive. I definitely had enough food and it was a quick, casual lunch meal but won't be added to my list of regular lunch spots. It will be more of a once in a while kind of a thing, but not bad for my first time there."},{"name":"Raglan Road Irish Pub","address":"1640 E Buena Vista Dr","city":"Lake Buena Vista","stars":"4","text":"Yes it is was one of those touristy kind of places you find all over Orlando, but the food and servers were very good.

Regretfully they didn't have everything prepped for what I wanted so he offered me an alternative and boy-howdy was it awesome. It was, essentially a zombie, with a scotch mist. I know you're saying \\"wait, what?\\" but hear me out. It was -awesome-! The glass had a wonderful peaty/smokey aroma and then the drink was pedal to the metal tiki glory. It was great. When I ordered my drink I also ordered their beef skewers and spring rolls, both were excellent. I preferred the skewers only because they were perfectly cooked. The food all tasted of fresh ingredients, were well prepared and presented. The drinks, likewise, were presented with fresh ingredients where applicable and it seemed to me like the only thing coming out of bottles that had been brought in were the spirits themselves. Later on, I ordered their chicken thigh skewers which were also top drawer.  There was intermittent traffic, as you'd expect pre-noon on a Tuesday, but the staff seemed to take care of them quickly, well,  and they all looked happy. Riley, the bartender, spent a good amount of time talking with me about varying rums, herbals and recipes which a) made me feel like the staff was paying attention and learning my tastes, so A+, b) introduced me to some new spirits I'd never heard of, A+ and c) demonstrated a clear mastery of his craft A++. I'm something of a tiki-o-phile so this was a trip in town on my day off to, largely, just check out a tiki bar in my area as we don't have many.

We were curious when we saw signs for Promise Land. Billed as a caf√©, we expected something casual, an order-at-the-counter type of place. When we first decided to stop in for lunch, we were surprised to find a  beautiful full-service restaurant with gorgeous d√©cor and a full drink list including wine, beer, inventive cocktails, and even a decent selection of scotch! Service is friendly and attentive without being hovery, and the food is amazing-- hands down the best falafel we've ever had.  We returned tonight for dinner, this time with our sometimes picky ten-year-old son. He ordered the seafood pasta and loved it! Like many of the other reviewers, we ended up with way too much food, but the prices are very reasonable and we look forward to enjoying Round Two for tomorrow's lunch. We are omnivores, but Mediterranean cuisine has so many beautiful meatless and vegan dishes that there is something for everyone. Please try it out, bring your friends, and help make Promise Land a popular destination. We hope to have them in the neighborhood for many years to come."},{"name":"Valencia Restaurant","address":"14501 Grove Resort Ave","city":"Winter Garden","stars":"3.5","text":"Do not eat here!

Looks like a great place for a date night but it was also perfect for group dinner, as it was the case for our visit on a Saturday of a Labor Day weekend.  Wide choices of tequila.  The complimentary chips were great but I'm not much of a fan of the salsa.  I regret not ordering the guacamole \\"el mero mero\\" as that one has an option that comes with pork belly and roasted grape tomato (yummm).  We had the chorizo + roasted apple quesos fundidos, which was amazing!  The combination of the chorizo and roasted apple was perfect as the dish was both sweet and salty.  Perfect for a group appetizer to share.  The tacos are big and since I was already having an appetizer, I decided to do 1 taco (short rib \\"double stack\\") and 1 charred octopus and those were enough to keep me full.  There were others who ordered 3 tacos which would be perfect if you're hungry and not getting a big appetizer.  The short rib taco was great but didn't blow my mind.  The charred octopus was really good but I wasn't too much of a fan of the sauce that went with it.  It was sour and acidic (probably the vinegar in it).

We went for the flatbread pizzas here which were actually quite good with tasty toppings and an overall hot and fresh taste that is a cut above what you expect in a theme park.  They also have the typically chicken nuggets and fries which were also decent, though I would recommend the flatbreads over the nuggets.  \\n\\nPricing is typical Disney, but you can apply your dining plan meals easily through the app.  This allows you to find your table, place your order, and then go to the quick pick-up area instead of waiting in line.

The veal could have been more tender and the marsala was a bit too sweet/heavy-handed for our liking, but overall it was good enough. We absolutely loved the special though. The noodles were perfectly al dente and there was a generous amount of seafood--and the sauce was to die for! (The side of linguine with red sauce that came with the veal was also good.)\\n\\nService was hot and cold. Our waitress took one look at us when we walked in and seemed to automatically hate us, claiming they didn't have highchairs (they do), but our toddler's good manners and adorableness seemed to win her over by the end of the night. \\n\\nWe're not sure we would have been this happy with the meal if we had to wait, but prices were good (cash only; there's an ATM across the street) and expectations were met, so...bellissimo!"},{"name":"The Salt Lick BBQ","address":"18300 Fm 1826","city":"Driftwood","stars":"4","text":"LOVE this place!

Bad sushi comes from any number of small mistakes, and they exhibit none. If the sushi were to be better, it would be little tweaks in the rice flavouring perhaps- very minor. But I say that despite them having the best rice in the area. \\n\\nThe reason I didn't give five stars is that they recently re-did the menu a bit and they seem to be trying to present as a more high quality place. The sushi is the same with some possible semi-fancy additions to the menu and the deletion of any good value lunch specials. The one, new lunch special is very expensive for what you get. It seemed actually more than if you ordered the same things off the menu. I tried one new aburi dish (flame seared), and it was pricy and underwhelming and small. \\n\\nIt's very evident that you should stick to your strengths. Good, consistent sushi for normal prices.

There are some good ones in the bunch for sure and it does depend on what types of donuts you like (more the cake donut person or yeast), but I have to say the Ohlin's is just the best.\\n\\nFirst, they have a great variety of donuts, more than almost any other small shop around.  Second, they are consistent.  I went to Ohlin's almost every Friday for over two years to pick up about 3 dozen donuts for my company.  They were ready every time and they did an outstanding job.  The quality and consistency is just superb.  Price is also very reasonable.  And, they have so much more is you want it, cakes, cupcakes, cookies, pies, breads.  They have something called the TV Treat that is out of this world, but not a donut.\\n\\nAbout the donuts, there are very few places around that make an apple fritter, let alone a good one (won't find them at Demet's, Verna's, Donut's with a Difference, Linda's, Kane's, etc), but the key is that they make SUCH A GOOD APPLE FRITTER.  It is really to die for.  Very big, but just the right amount of slight crisp on the outside, but lots of apple, raisin, cinnamon, and flaky dough on the inside.  You have to have these.  Then, they have the boston cr√®me, but also have the fluff filled.

We got there around 7:30 on Friday and were told it would be about 45 minutes. We thought we'd give the bar a try, but it was full and when people got up the bartender said there was a waitlist for the bar, but didn't tell us how to put our names on said list. So for me, the night started off a little rocky, but the food made up for it. We ended up only waiting about 20 minutes and were seated outside. The temp was in the low 60s but they have heat lamps so it was actually quite comfortable and the atmosphere was adorable out there. \\n\\nOur server came over right away and we were pretty hungry at this point so we ordered the calamari to start. I would rate it a 2/5. The calamari itself was tender and not chewy, but the batter was so salty. The aioli that comes on the side made it slightly more bearable, but I would forgo this if you don't like overly-salted food. \\n\\nWe were having trouble deciding on main meals because we sort of wanted to try everything. Neither of us had ever had a lobster roll so we considered splitting one, ya know because when in Boston and all... but at $34 and varying Yelp reviews, we decided to skip it. Instead, I went with the crispy fish tacos. They were some of the best I've ever had. The fish was light and the breading wasn't too heavy. The lime crema was my favorite part. It was really tasty but also very light and complimentary to the fish flavor. My boyfriend did the bacon cheddar burger, which he really enjoyed. It came with fries - the thin kind that seem as though they're cut and fried at the restaurant, which is always a plus. We also shared the old bay onion rings and Mexican street corn. I tasted no old bay on the onion rings but I still really liked them. They were very oily but the batter wasn't too think/heavy so it balanced out. The corn was incredible, I think mostly because I was a huge fan of that lime crema! We also really wanted to try the cornbread but it looked massive so we were worried about ordering it for just the 2 of us to share. \\n\\nOne thing that irked me is that our server sort of disappeared for a while before we ordered our main meals. Eventually another server came over and took our order but it was strange because our first server ended up coming back later. So that was odd but didn't ruin it for me!

The place is somewhat recently renovated according to my friend who's been there a year ago. There aren't too many seating areas, probably around less than 20. That wasn't too big of a problem as most of the customers took them to go. The place was bustling as there was a constant line the entire time we were there. \\n\\nI got the beef Philly and wings combo with fries. I believe combo is around $10 with one extra dollar for the fries. They make everything as the order comes in so the food is hot and fresh. The Philly comes with lots of meat, veggies, and cheese . The only downside I could think of was the bread was soaked with the moisture from hot food. If you let it sit for a while, food will definitely fall through the bread, so eat it quickly!

I know there's a million places in between to eat, but it's often the case that none of them seem appealing at a particular time. \\n\\nFunny enough, this is about 2 minutes from my house and I'm always driving by on the way to something else on North Mills or toward Winter Park. Truly glad that we stopped at Bananas. \\n\\nFirst off, the decor is cool and doesn't try too hard to be modern/diner. Classic red and black, black and white posters and lots of booths. Complimentary valet parking makes a difference where space is at a premium, too. The servers are friendly, though I'm pretty tired of having my party referred to as \\"you guys\\" and servers referring to the group as we. No need to try so hard, just be friendly and efficient. \\n\\nSo, the important part...\\n\\nThe food was excellent. I had the chicken and waffles which was recommended when I asked what were the most popular dishes. I got a breast and a thigh, with a really light country sausage gravy and the waffles were decent. The chicken was probably an 8 and the waffles a 8, nothing too special. For a restaurant that looks to make a lot from scratch, I did expect better than Mrs. Butterworth's fake syrup which is really corn syrup and coloring. For almost $13, some real maple syrup would have made a difference. \\n\\nThe lady got a tuna melt on grilled bread, with their home made potato chips and a pickle. It all looked great, though the chips got soggy kinda quick. \\n\\nWith an iced tea for me, dinner came to $31 after tax and tip. A cool little extra, the check is brought with a cone of banana cotton candy. A reverse amuse bouche, I guess. \\n\\nCan't wait to come back and try breakfast which is served all the time.

We knew it would be small, but didn't realize how tiny! It was probably 5 or 6 bites for $14 - way overpriced. Also, we canceled the last order of sushi we had placed because it was taking a really long time, and by then we were pretty much done eating.

My shrimp pasta was tasty, but visually unappealing--a lot of visible grease coated the noodles. The chicken Caesar salad flatbread was a total bust. I was expecting something akin to a pizza, but instead it was a chicken Caesar salad perched on top of a giant cracker. It was too unwieldy to eat like a pizza, but the cracker was too hard to be eaten with a fork and knife.\\n\\nThe decent wine list was organized by characteristics of the wine rather than in a more traditional manner, which was both fun and a bit confusing. They serve the wine in tiny carafes and pour the glass at the table. This once resulted in the waitress mixing up my wine with a coworker's, which she quickly remedied once we alerted her to the mistake.\\n\\nI would not make McCoy's a dining destination, but rest assured you'll eat a reasonable meal if you find yourself here.

I made reservations for 2 at 8PM, and was promptly seated at 8:01. This location is located in the 'old city hall', I had never been in this area before but it was stunning. We had to take a walk through the restaurant, as our table was closer to the back of the whole building. The whole setting of the restaurant is very dim lighting, warm, and quiet. Our server Jamie was very sweet and welcoming. I am a huge steak kind of girl so I already knew I would be having this for dinner. The drink/dinner menu is extensive and has various options. To start off we had a drink called \\"Blackberry Sidecar\\" Remy Martin with some blackberry type of mix. Strong and worth the price. My friend and I chose to go with the \\"Ruth's Classics\\" meal. This comes with a salad for a starter, you pick your entr√©e and one side, then a dessert (for one set price!) How can you beat that? I ordered a caesar salad, 6oz filet and shrimp, with garlic mashed potatoes, and strawberry shortcake for dessert. Unbeatable! My friend had a steakhouse salad, 6oz filet and lobster tail, with the cheese potato stack, & a strawberry shortcake as well. Our steaks were cooked to our perfect temperature and tasted so GREAT! Our sides of potatoes? Tasted so wonderful, and matched the steaks well. A really cool, unique thing about this restaurant is that they serve the steak on sizzling hot plates (can't touch them!) with the butter melting and bubbling. A nice touch. Needless to say, dessert was also amazing and such a generous piece. Our dinner was to celebrate my best friend's new job, so our server Jamie actually brought out a second dessert, a chocolate cake that said \\"congrats & goodluck\\", this was SO sweet and amazing service! \\n\\nThings I usually hear about Ruth's Chris is that it is a chain restaurant and maybe overrated, but I have to disagree. It was a very pleasurable time with great tasting food. Quick reminder, don't forget your wallet at home. Totally worth the price though.

When you pay, they give you a cup and you can fill it yourself from the canisters. there are usually 4 flavors of coffee including decaf so you don't have to be stuck with just one. The Mozart Mocha is one of the best that I've ever had. Its perfectly sweetened with not too much cream. The milk is foamed perfectly on the top, and it is so smooth to drink. It truly is fantastic. \\n\\nLocation: This place is right on the water. It has both indoor and outdoor seating and there is really never a bad view anywhere. It is just a treat to be here. \\n\\nGreat Food: Mozart's isn't a super big one on the food, but the stuff that they do have is freaking amazing.

Inside, Porter Beer Bar also looks like every other dive bar too. But when you try the food...Holy yum, Batman!\\n\\nI've been to L5P many times and never glanced twice at the narrow entrance marking Porter Beer Bar, but last night, since a friend of mine is prepping to move to Charlotte, NC and making his final round of farewells, he's going to all the places on his list that he hadn't yet tried in Atlanta. And also, since he was freshly back from a trip to Ireland, he felt Porter's would be an appropriate place to recap his tales.\\n\\nMy boyfriend and I arrived a little late on Wednesday evening (traffic was typically horrendous - as was parking in Little Five), and although there were a number of people occupying the long bar that fills half the restaurant and a good number of tables taken in back, we had no problem securing a booth for the three of us.\\n\\nThe waitress was one of the most laid back I've encountered in a while, but for all that she was still very good, saying things like, \\"No rush to order,\\" but also refilling our mason jar water glasses regularly.\\n\\nAfter surveying the menu it became clear that the appetizers were more appealing than most of the main dishes, and though they sounded like standard bar fare at first, they definitely weren't. And I've not even mentioned the beer list yet, which was at least four times longer than the actual food menu. If beer's your thing, Porter Beer Bar has got you covered.\\n\\nBut I digress. The appetizer menu looked so good, we decided to get a bunch of apps and share. Great decision. We ordered the goat cheese fritters, the mac'n'cheese, the fish'n'chips (mostly at my boyfriend's request) and of course, the salt'n'vinegar popcorn.\\n\\nWhile we were diving into tales of Ireland, sheep, castles, etc. the food began arriving. And whoa boy, it was impressive! \\n\\nAs practically everyone else has said, the salt and vinegar popcorn is something else, it's out of this world good, but also potentially asthma inducing at the same time if you inhale while attempting to eat a handful. Fantastic - we finished off the whole, giant bowl with no problems. The goat cheese fritters were also spot on: they resembled giant mozzarella sticks covered in honey and way easier to cut with a knife and fork. Delicious taste. The mac'n'cheese was good but probably the least impressive of the bunch only because everyone in this town does mac'n'cheese, so there's a ton of really stiff competition. It was still quite good. And the fish and chips that I had a bite of were also good, the most standout part to me was the fries which had this awesome, deep, garlicky flavor in them. Yum!\\n\\nHonestly, I was really impressed with the food at Porter, and the bill for four apps and one entree came to a mere $36, which was also pretty darn impressive.\\n\\nThe only thing that sucked - and this was in no way Porter Beer Bar's fault - was that I got ticketed by Park Atlanta because my meter expired 3 minutes before I returned! Damn you Park ATL!!\\n\\nAside from parking, go to Porter - just beware to not breathe in while eating the popcorn."},{"name":"Tiki Rock","address":"2 Broad St","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"The place has such a fun, young, and upbeat atmosphere.

I chose the carrot infused rice and the veggie noodles. For the protein, I chose the salmon, tuna, beef, and a shrimp/crab mixture. The scoops of protein were pretty small especially compared to other poke spots I have been to. The mix ins I chose were the corn, edamame, seaweed salad, and cucumber. I got the tare sauce, which is similar to a teriyaki. I also go the yum yum sauce on the side. I asked if it was like the yum yum sauce from hibachi restaurants and the server said yes. However, it is not quiet that sauce. It taste more yogurt-like. I topped it with crunchy onions, crunchy garlic, and furikake. \\n\\nOverall, the food was pretty good.

The service was friendly, but we felt like we were on an island at times.  We were a party of 6 and also had a 16month toddler with us which is maybe why they sat us at the front by the windows, but no other party was in this area.

I came it just by myself so I didn't go for the platter. Although it was pretty late at night this place was still about 60%~70% full. I would suggest they have some more waiters as I only saw three waiters running around helping everyone in the restaurant. That being said, the service quality definitely exceeded my expectations. The two waiters I had the pleasure to talk to were definitely knowledgeable and very friendly, asking me whether I have any food allergies and then made some suggestions for orders. I ended up with a Salty Pigs pizza with an egg on top of it and man it was so so so good. I love the hand-tossed dough and the salty pig parts on top of it. What's surprising to me though is they put a drizzle of honey on top which to me is literally like the icing on the cake. With that egg on top? Omg that's literally like the best combination ever!!

A booming brunch restaurant in midtown with no mimosas? A rarity. However I would still 100% recommend eating here. It also speaks a lot for the restaurant that the wait is so long & they don't serve drinks.

Highlands near my favs of Sotto Sotto and Fritti, this place offers complimentary valet.\\n\\nAtmosphere was great.  If you want a little mellower vibe to talk, sit outdoors but the inside was perfect for a friday night.  It was very lively. \\n\\nWe had a group of 6 in our table and was seated right away with our reservation.  We ordered 6 tapas dishes and shared 2 person paella, along with a pitcher of sangria.  The tapas came out right away and we were very pleased with the service. The staff was very well trained and had great team work that would always refill water, change out to clean plates, and always asking if we needed anything.  I give a thumbs up for the staff, especially when the environment is little loud and chaotic. \\n\\nOn to the food, bread was always fresh and hot and the olive oil was delicious that no pepper nor vignette was needed.  Churizo and fig was as good as the reviews but the flavor of the figs were not my favorite.  Calamari was surprisingly very good.  Not overcooked or chewy and had a great flavor with a pinch of salt.  Beef empanadas was delicious but my favorite had to be the ribeye special that they had! So juicy and tender with excellent seasoning.  Potato was okay but a good filler and my friends enjoyed the kebobs, but personally i do not enjoy too herby dishes.\\n\\nJust to warn you, theses are small tapas so we devoured amongst the 6 of us pretty quickly.  We sipped on our sangria afterwards.  White traditional was what we ordered and wish it was mixed little better as all the sweetness was on the bottom of the pitcher, but regardless it was pretty tasty.\\n\\nThen our entree came out. As hungry as we were, we were disappointed at the size of the 2 person dish and thought to ourselves that we should have ordered a bigger size but it was still perfect to give us room for desserts.  Seafood in the paella was delicious! So fresh and cooked just right. Needless to say it was gone in minutes and our paella cravings were fulfilled.\\n\\nThen the finale, we ordered churros and crepas for dessert.  Churros was sort of a let down since the chocolate didnt have the sweetness that we were looking for.  But the crepas was perfect both visually and taste.  Inside they had these chunks of caramel that you cant help to fall in love with! \\n\\nOverall, great place!\\n\\nI did want to note couple of observations that did concern me.  This place seemed to have no ac? Just fans so it was a bit warm inside. Also, as i walked past the hall to go to the ladies room, the cured meat station was visible and umm... i wouldnt order the meat anyways but i saw a fly perched on one of the meat... this should be addressed.

She says to a girl standing in the kitchen that she needs Chicken only to be ignored by that girl because she was to busy texting on her phone.

The ingredients were fresh, the pico de gallo had the right amount of heat and the homemade tortillas were spot on. Delicious chips and salsa were free. And... most tacos were only $2.79! That is a bargain for food this good. There is competition about a mile away that charges about $4 to 5 for a taco that isn't as good in my opinion. Restaurants come and go at this location, so it is our hope you go out and try this place. You will return to support it I am sure.

He also never acknowledged me and kept on doing his closing duties (yes, one hour before closing). Needless to say I was unhappy with the service. However I have a policy to not make scenes in public and instead to just not tip or tip 10% when the service is bad (mind you I have a waitressing for two years already). But when I was paying my bill with cash he had the AUDACITY TO AUTO-CHARGE 20% TIP WITHOUT CONSULTING ME. Mind you, at that point I was still going to tip 10% regardless, but this was just too much. So I asked for my exact change back and he said \\"it's tip\\", and I responded: NO, I have been a waitress for 2 years and tip is voluntary, and I won't be leaving you any because this is the worst service I have had.

But everything- the fat of the proteins, the acidity of the sauce or the fruit, the crunch of the veggies, the freshness of the cilantro- is balanced like Tao. The food is fire but even the cool art on the walls will raise your brow. But after eating as much as my belly could allow, I eventually had to say \\"ciao.\\" Now I'm just thinking of when I'll come back- probably now!"},{"name":"Sixth and Waller","address":"1108 East Sixth St","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"They tore down classic east austin for this?\\nWalked in, cute but small.

It is right inside the Bohemian Hotel in Celebration. We opted to sit outside. BIG mistake. The mosquitos ate us alive. While the food was really good, we kept having to swat away the mosquitos throughout dinner. And then there were multiple geckos/lizards running around all over the walls. This is central Florida, I get it. I've eaten at outdoor spots multiple times, but this was the most critters I've seen buzzing/running around at a dining establishment.\\n\\nThey had a special menu for the holidays. I had the cinnamon scented carrot bisque with ginger creme fraiche. It was thick, hearty, and delicious. I could have had a large bowl of that soup with some good bread, and would have considered it a fantastic meal. \\n\\nWe ordered an artisan cheese plate to share at the table. It was a good spread. We cleaned the plate off. \\n\\nFor my entree I had the filet mignon accompanied by mashed potatoes and mixed vegetables.The filet itself was delicious, perfectly done and we'll seasoned. The mashed potatoes were scrumptious, clearly made from scratch. And it was the most interesting vegetable mixture I've had. While the veggies were visually very appealing, I couldn't eat as much as I wanted because they were very underdone, almost raw. There was one vegetable I couldn't identify, but it was straight up bitter.\\n\\nThe service was a little spotty, we had to ask to have out drinks refilled twice. And then it took a long time for them to bring us our checks."},{"name":"The Salt Lick BBQ","address":"18300 Fm 1826","city":"Driftwood","stars":"4","text":"Yes, yes, and yes. It's a bit of a drive for Austinites, but not as bad as it sounds. If you're coming here, the all you can eat menu is the way to go: it's sides, bread, and meat galore. Plan well and order so you have a full table that you can pack up to go; anything you don't finish you're allowed to take home. Also, make sure to bring a cooler full of your beverage of choice, as it's BYOB here. That comes in helpful during peak hours, as you can sit and drink for free while waiting for a table.\\n\\nThen when you sit down, prepare to enjoy. The BBQ sauce is the true winner here; it's a sweet and spicy sauce with a different color than you're normally used to. But simply, wow. In my opinion, the brisket is the best of the meats. You can go by and see them cooking in, and it just makes your mouth water, even if you're completely full. A must trip for any Austin resident.\\n\\nThere's a lot of votes for no reservations, but I had a friend reserve a table for about 20 for graduation."},{"name":"Row 34","address":"383 Congress St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"Good oysters and good beer. Easy to find a spot at the bar but if you come off hours then a table is a cinch. Had a few oysters a la carte for $3 on average each. All east coast and each a bit different and all with unique taste. But the big bright spot was the beer list. Mostly New England beers on draft but also some rare bottles from the big boys in the sour game and Belgium. Pours are typically $8-11 which is Boston pricing but watch out for the size of the pour to not be caught off guard. Allow a quick taste before purchasing and quality poor.

This is super casual Italian food.  Six of us ate for $75 - this included 7 drinks. The location is very good with easy walking to the Haunted Mansion or Tomorrowland and next to Peter Pan and Small World.\\n\\n(I detail the specific prices below, because it can be hard to find that info on Disney food.)\\n\\nSecond tip:  Opt out of the sides if you don't want them.  They sell you meals automatically...but you don't have to buy your food that way.  You'll save a bundle.\\n\\nI noticed each time we were in the Magic Kingdom that this place would go totally quiet about 7:30-8 (we were there during high season also).  This worked out well for my family because we come late and stay til close, which has always been our way of avoiding crowds in Disneyland.\\n\\nThe food isn't Great, but there's very little Disney food that is.  Everyone was satisfied with what they had: meatball sub ($6.5), spaghetti w/ meatballs ($8.5), chicken parmesan ($9), pizza ($9.5) and chicken nuggets with a side ($8.5).  Drinks:  32 oz soda ($2.9), 12 oz hot tea ($2), bottled water ($2.3 each), chocolate milk ($2.2).\\n\\nThere's a lot of seating, very casual - as noted, you can watch people load It's a Small World, which is nice.  The paintings on the walls of scenes from Pinocchio are very cute.  I'm a huge fan of Figaro, the black cat, and there are quite a few pictures he's in.\\n\\nHope this specific info will help Disney World visitors in their decision making!"},{"name":"The Brewer's Table","address":"4715 E 5th St","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Best food in East Austin, great service and happy hours.

Think of it as the barbeque version of \\"To Catch A Predator\\", and just try to pretend that child molesters are as bad as people who lie about barbeque.  \\n\\nThe drive out to Driftwood is beautiful - the Austin Hill Country never ceases to amaze.  And the restaurant is nestled smack dab in the middle of it - a sprawling gravel parking lot including natural wood fences, a rustic looking interior, and a beautiful outdoor patio shaded by dozens of huge trees.  It's picturesque Austin countryside at its best.  And as an added bonus, it's in a dry country.  Out of town visitors from the coasts who don't live in places that legislate by The Bible always get a kick out of it when I tell them that not only are we going to be able to bring beer into the restaurant, but that we have no other choice.   \\n\\nBut when someone in Austin tells me that The Salt Lick is their favorite barbeque spot, I just smile at them and say, \\"that's nice\\".  It's pretty much the same reaction I have when a retarded kid shows me his baseball.  Because when I hear that, I know - this person just doesn't understand.  Now don't get me wrong - it's not that it's bad.  Put a plate of Salt Lick in front of me, and I'll eat it any day.  With a smile.  But the best in the Austin Area?  Have you ever even tried the Big Chop at Coopers?  Baby backs at Artz Rib House?  Sausage at Kreutz's Market? Brisket at Louie Muellers?  If you have, then you should know that there's absolutely nothing outstanding about most of the meat they serve at The Salt Lick.   And if you just don't get that, well...enjoy your baseball.\\n\\nBut there will be times when you end up having to go here, typically because your guests have bought into the hype.  You'll justify it to yourself because the drive into the Hill Country is so nice (and herein lies the fallacy - beautiful settings alone do not equal great barbeque.)  If you find yourself in this position, you can only hope to cut your losses by staying away from the family style, all-you-can eat plate.  The beef, sausage, and pork ribs are uninspiring, and keep you from experiencing the one thing that The Salt Lick does really well - their chicken.   When it's in season, it comes tender, juicy, and is delicious when you smother it in the habanero barbeque sauce.  In fact, it's might be some of the better barbequed chicken I've had in Texas.  But a Texas barbeque joint hanging its hat on chicken is like a stripper that prides herself on being able to talk football.  It's nice honey, but it's not really what anyone came here for."},{"name":"Minas Cafe","address":"1241 Washington St","city":"Norwood","stars":"4.5","text":"Absolutely LOVE this place.

We were seated promptly at 12:30pm and placed our orders. Our food did not arrive until 1:45pm. The Mother's Day activity which we had told our waitress we were attending started at 2pm so we felt incredibly rushed once our food finally arrived. Our waitress did apologize stating that the restaurant was very busy and the kitchen was backed up, however, there were only 3 tables in the restaurant (including ours) totaling 12 people for the entire time we were there. When our food did arrive everything was cold (eggs, french fries, pancakes, sausage) and the avocado toast my mom ordered was soggy as well. It did seem like our meals were perhaps cooked and then left out for a long period of time. I will admit I had read negative reviews on other sites but decided to give this restaurant a shot mainly out of convenience for the event we were attending at the hotel afterward. I regret not listening to the other reviews as this experience was incredibly disappointing and we will not be back.

The place is definitely understaffed but service is very unfriendly and I even thought of not tipping considering how negative the experience was. \\n\\nAnyways besides the terrible service the food is ok. In my opinion it's a little heavy on the salt and pricey for what it is. The samosas are pretty average for $5 and they just through a bunch of soggy vegetables under it one of the most disappointing platings I've ever seen. I was also surprised how their cilantro green sauce had no flavor except spicy and really lacked in mint and texture that I would find at other establishments.

Inside the main dining area, it is extremely hard to hold a conversation due to how loud the DJ had the music blasting.  We were all  literally leaning over the table the entire time so we could hear what was being said.  My recommendation is that if the weather and timing allows, sit outside on the back patio.  There is a nice view of the lake behind the restaurant and the tiki torches add a nice touch.  The music that was playing was top 10 and current hip hop which gave the place a club feel.  The place wasn't packed but there was no shortage of old seemingly rich guys and sloppy drunk young girls flirting with them.  The only other time I've gotten used to seeing that is at Blue Martini.

I am not usually a BBQ sauce user, but I had to utilize it at Salt Lick.  Thankfully it is really good sauce.  One of the better BBQ sauces I have had.  I think the sauce is better than the meat (minus the sausage).\\n\\nThe ambiance here is what makes Salt Lick unique and one of a kind.

Had to try the Ike's Vietnamese Fish Sauce Wings. Good as advertised. Although I asked for spicy  and these were not in the least bit. They were full of flavor and so moist inside.  And messy! Thanks for the wet wipes! Not something you want to order on a date  Wantwd something else so went with the Jin Hoom, a slow cooked beef short rib stew.  This was fantastic.  Really need to mix it up as so many good spices at the bottom. Lemon  grass spicy  chillies and some other goodies I couldn't identify. Beef was so tender.

Was immediately greeted by the pizza baker, and helped by two different waiters. I came specifically for the vegan options, and tried the sausage/spinach/sweet pepper. It was very good! Nicely charred crust, not overdone, and a good balance and distribution of toppings. The peppers were much spicier than I expected, so watch out for that. \\n\\nWe also wanted to try a salad, and it took some back and forth with the waiters to determine what on the menu could be veganized, and they weren't familiar with the ingredient details of most side dishes. Ultimately went with the lettuces/shaved apple/radish salad, made vegan by eliminating the ricotta salata and subbing the red wine vinaigrette (it has egg) for a simple oil and vinegar dressing specially made by request. \\n\\nGood experience overall, and I appreciate the inclusion of some vegan pizza options, but I feel there definitely could be more accommodation to give us vegans a more rounded meal--not just a pizza and then severely modifying everything else on the menu (while still paying full price)."},{"name":"Atlanta Breakfast Club","address":"249 Ivan Allen Jr Blvd","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4.5","text":"This is one of my favorite breakfast places while visiting in ATL.

I almost thought she was joking by her tone of voice. Unsure if this came from how young she assumed we were but it was completely unnecessary and offensive.

Tangy, not SOUR (unlike an unnamed 'self-proclaimed best' za joint). Light, crisp yet chewy, charred and textured. A little soft towards the center but it doesn't take away from the overall brilliance of this crust, it's all about the flavor. \\n\\nThe sauce is very fresh tasting, using San Marzano tomatoes and the cheese is outstanding. Nice pieces of basil and garlic accent it. \\n\\nAs of now, no tables or chairs, although that will come. As I walked into the kitchen to shake Enrico's hand for a job well done (and to gawk at the ovens), there was a table set up in the kitchen that you can reserve. This was cool. They pointed a temperature gauge at the ovens from about 15 feet away and the thing jumped quickly. This was cool. It was also cool to see the dough rising to crazy levels in the side kitchen (see pic). \\n\\nIt was so good, I went back after work and ordered another pie to bring home, and it was just as good reheated in my meager 550 degree oven. I also got some cannoli's for after, not bad. The ricotta had a citrus zing to it. \\n\\nAs Kit said...'excited about pizza' is definitely the phrase that fits here.

The company was great, and the restaurant was satisfactory. With the name being Wigwam, I didn't expect to walk into a 50's style looking diner, but it was very nostalgic and had a great small town feel. We were seated at a round table right inside the door, which was fine. I like round tables versus the long rectangle tables, as they are easier to carry on conversations with everyone. Their prices were average, maybe  slightly below what you would expect to pay. It seemed like it attracted a lot of local clientele. I ordered the classic Reuben, which for a diner style restaurant, was a decent sandwich. Another woman got the fish sandwich with a huge piece of fish, and the club sandwich was stacked fairly well. The only downside to the club was they used American cheese and some white cheese which we weren't sure what it was. Instead of good sliced Swiss or something along that line, it was the square processed cheese.  4 of us had pie afterwards, and everyone seemed to enjoy theirs except me. I got the chocolate pie which was somewhat rubbery on the sides from too much exposure to air, and it was rather bland and not very creamy but dense. The other ladies were satisfied with their peanut butternut, cherrie and peach pies.\\n\\nThe restaurant was clean. There were  only 2 servers that we saw. This made service somewhat slow. The french fries that came with the sandwich tasted very bland, even with salt on them. There was something about them that made them stale tasting, almost like cardboard. They looked normal, but I was not satisfied with their quality. Even dipping them in ketchup didn't seem to help.  I had ordered a Coke to drink, and the lady next to me had ordered an unsweet tea. When we got refills we noticed after a few sips that she had actually filled mine up with the and unsweet tea, and filled the other lady's up with Coke. We both had a half-and-half drink.  She was a nice enough waitress, but it took her so long to come back around we just drank what she gave us. There was also some confusion with the checks. There were 6 of us checking out and one of us was overcharged, I was under charged, as she did not add the charge for the substitution of fries for chips, which I wasn't told was going to happen, as the girl asked me if I wanted chips or fries or salad, etc. Another lady we were with got charged $2 for changing to fries. A pie was not billed, and there were a couple of other quirky things about checking out.\\n\\nAll in all it is a cute place and it is definitely a mom and pop atmosphere. It is not a high end restaurant so you are going to expect these things to happen.

However, the service is terrible, management is poor, and the sound is blasting out of one speaker. \\n\\nLast night, I went there with two friends to watch the zags bball game and ducks bball game. At times there was between five and twenty people. Yes, the service was a little better when we were three of the five people in the bar, but it was pathetic. It was difficult to get a beer at both our nearby table or at the bar. Not sure if this was the C team being a Tuesday before Thanksgiving but it should have been A LOT better.\\n\\nAs far as TV's, they have Directv and comcast however, when I asked to put the Ducks bball game on, the bartender didn't have access to change the comcast channels, only the directv ones. The blazer game was set-up earlier to play and the channel couldn't be changed. What kind of sports bar can't change their own channels? much less play the local sports team. \\n\\nThrough multiple managements, this place just seems to add more and more tv's and not concern itself about the service and overall atmosphere.

It's decently loud, filled with tons of locals and tourists, so don't come here if you're looking for elegance/an intimate vibe. It's right behind the Aquarium/World of Coke, so the location is prime if you're looking to catch all of the tourist attractions right after breakfast. \\n\\nLet's get down to it.\\n\\nSo I ordered the chicken and waffles of course. I have nothing to compare them to. But these were absolutely amazing!! The waffles were fluffy and the chicken was tender, crispy and tasty.

The rice was brought out in a large container for the table to share. They did not refill it, but it would have been nice to have our own individual rice per person. \\n\\nOverall, the food was really good. It was well seasoned, and packed with flavor. The garlic shrimp was spicy, but the vegetables provided with the meal helped to tone down the strong spice present. Other people in my party got pad thai, chicken fried rice, pad see ew, and kung pao chicken. My friends loved their food, and would recommend coming back to this place. \\n\\nThey have a sign that says they cannot split checks with more than 5 people. The owner kindly split our check 6 ways.

One of my friends did not want something on her food, it was added and the waiter told her that she should have been more clear when ordering and that it could not be changed. Additionally, the waiter added, you will just have to pick it off.  The second. the parking situation is absolutely atrocious. There are limited spaces, and you may have to double park behind another car.

This past weekend I had planned to go to B.Ladd to watch the Oregon State game with a few friends. I called to see if they served the breakfast menu like Blitz 99W and they said \\"yes\\". Well, they don't, it's a buffet style breakfast. OK, I'll let that pass. When we arrived at 9:00, the Oregon State game was on most of the 30 TVs they advertise as having. Shortly after we placed our order, they came around and started changing ALL of the TVs to the Ohio State game. The guy said he would leave us the ONE TV to watch our game. I would have had to look over my shoulder to watch that TV. I got up and went to ask them if they couldn't turn on another TV AND THE SOUND!!    I was told \\"No, this is an Ohio State bar\\". I told him this was Oregon though, can't you at least have most of the bar's TVs on the Ohio game but leave one corner/end of the bar on the Oregon State game. He just looked at me, told me \\"NO, this is an Ohio State bar\\". Never once apologized even a little bit. He was even rude about it!!  I am one of those people that expect a little customer service at the places I spend my money. It just floors me that they would turn everyone else away except one fan base. This is a HUGE bar, it's inexcusable! They had plenty of empty tables. They could have made even more money by letting other fans occupy them. Stupid!!   Apparently, I have never watched an Oregon State game there that was on at the same time as and Ohio game because I was not aware of their policy before. I have introduced over a dozen people to this business chain in the past. I personally have spent about $1,000 dollars there plus all of the money the people with me have spent. I will NEVER go back to a Blitz bar and I am sending out an email to EVERY person on my email list with the same review I have typed here.

They had one of my favorite cheeses listed, which is burrata. It's a very creamy rich cheese, but this one missed the mark. For one, the flavor didn't stand out and it wasn't as creamy as they usually are. Also the temperature of the dish was not right.  My friend didn't even like it at all. I finished it just because. Speaking of temperature, the spicy eggplant was downright cold. Clearly they were not in their best form tonight. The shrimp, though large, were so overly shrimp-tasting I could barely get a bite down. I didn't have another. And the mussels...anyone who eats mussels knows it is all about the sauce.

We settled for: Mar y Tierra dish, I asked to see how much it would be with lobster and almost passed out when they said it was going to cost, one plate bear in mind, over $50.00, so I settled for churrasco and octopus, which was almost $30.00, I had to order sides separately, at $5.99 each side, because the plate came only with a small portion of Arroz Mampostiao, BTW, I am not sure where they got the recipe for the rice, cause the ones I have seen, do not have pieces of sweet plantain and tons of peppers on it, flavorless and almost fake tasting! 2 Drinks were almost $10.00 each.. They have an outside area, so we asked if we could seat there, because the place was soo loud as it is so enclosed, the loud talking from the people was to say the least, annoying. We were told: We do not serve anyone outside, so order to go, and you seat yourself as noone will go there to assist you. So we had to wait till the drinks were ready, be served as if we went thru a McDonalds Drive thru, and shipped on our way OUT! The meat was soo chewy, we almost choke and could not eat all of it; the octopus had this ackward taste, needless to say, we could not eat it, as we did not want to get sick -- brought the rest home to see if my dogs, hopefully did not choke on it too!

Once we were seated, our group split a few orders of calamari, the antipasti plate, and a caprese salad. The antipasti plate had a selection of cheeses along with cured meats, artichoke hearts, marinated peppers, and olives. Although the mozzarella was clearly appropriate, it seemed like pieces of gouda made it on the plate, which I found rather perplexing. For dinner, I had a side of the sauteed broccoli rabe and the foccaccia salad (requested without bread) which had goat cheese, tomatoes, and grilled zucchini. The broccoli rabe was a bit too salty (i didn't' add any salt), but there was a great garlic flavor imparted. The salad was fine - it's pretty hard in my eyes to screw up a rather simple salad.

Not bad, but when you pay $30 for a 6 oz. filet you expect A LOT more! First, the meat is choice! No prime here, which I thought was really odd. That explained the high amount of fat in my tiny filet. And not the marbling that you want in a good steak but the fat that should have been trimmed. The side of mushrooms and onions lacked seasoning and was kind of soggy. My husband's steak came out quite overcooked and had to be sent back.

HIGHLY RECOMMEND. it comes in 3 pieces but we added an extra piece of tuna for $4 so we can share two pieces each.  BOMB. i can eat this only and be satisfied.  the dish looks deceiving, but its a healthy bite and mouthful of tuna.  it looks like just a slice of nigiri, BUT its tuna rolled up on a bed of avocado and garlic chips/shavings and a balsamic glaze. it is delicious. you can use the complimentary bread to just dip as well. its amazing - have i emphasized this enough?).  they serve a basket of complimentary bread (dinner rolls) as well, with a side of butter and salt - ive never had a cup of salt served with my bread but putting butter on the roll with a sprinkle of salt was so good.  i liked that the bread and butter didn't come salted, and we can control the salt flavor on the bread).  the wine selection here is amazing, ordered two different glasses of sauvignon blanc wine to pair with our seafood dishes.\\n\\nhighly recommend coming here as a date for something special.  the bill is expensive ~$200, but it is worth it trying out all these dishes.  maybe come for lunch for a dish? but just go all out while you are here.  if you are in the portsmouth, nh area, you should check it out as well."},{"name":"Davidson's Casual Dining","address":"12830 SW Pacific Hwy","city":"Tigard","stars":"3.5","text":"The service there is so bad.

Much of the quaintness around the area in the 30s-40s houses turned boutique or restaurant is giving way to the big \\"New Buckhead\\".  You know the project that shut down all the bars and started what was touted as \\"The Rodeo Drive\\" of Atlanta.  Too bad they started that with the financial crisis, but six years of bull markets now have that project fully underway.  There are seven story cranes hoisting marble and faux-gilded iron-works up.  This place is going to be posh.  I fear for the quaintness that makes me love this area.\\n\\nRight on the border of this area sits the epicenter of quaint, Antica Posta.  AP is wonderful.  You valet -- which has been really quick for me every time -- and then walk up to this charming house.  As you come in, you're welcomed by a great room with a vaulted ceiling and a mahogany bar across the way.  There are tables in here, and if you're there to people watch, then this is your room.  To me the place to seat in is in back, but not downstairs.  Stay on the main level.  This feels like you're sitting back in time, far nicer than the old Italian places on Cheshire Bridge, and you can get a view of the kitchen.  \\n\\nNow here's an important point, GET ON THE EMAIL DISTRIBUTION LIST!!  Marco brings in truffles every so often, and when he does, he sends an e-mail.  You will then be treated to wonderful specials.  He's does a fillet with black truffle carpaccio on top.  He's also done various kinds of risotto.  The swordfish special with truffle is also excellent.  Seriously, if you like truffle, then this is the hidden gem of Atlanta!  Marco does not skimp on the truffle.  \\n\\nThere are few places in Atlanta that I order off the wine list, but AP's wine list is reasonably priced and uniquely selected.  I sometimes order from the list, but their corkage is reasonable if you choose to bring a bottle.\\n\\nThere are a few things that you musn't miss.  \\n\\nTheir octopus (as I said in my earlier review) is the best in Atlanta.  Seriously, even my daughter who doesn't like octopus will take a few slices.  My daughter who loves octopus will take down an order herself as an app.  This is exceptionally soft and delicious.\\n\\nThe gemelli is also exceptional.  Covered in an absolutely delightful cheese and cream sauce with peas and pancetta.  It's delicious and something you should order for the table.  \\n\\nI would recommend coming with at least four people and then ordering as you do in Italy.  Order your antipasto, then some pasta then a meat course.  We've found two or three of each is great for four to five people.\\n\\nI don't think Antica Posta is going anywhere, but it is one of the last bastions of Buckhead quaintness and specialness standing guard to keep the area special and unique, before it's overrun with chains like Fado and the Capital Grill.

Half of the staff are super friendly while the other half are alright. The 2 guys at the register were super nice and attentive. Not what I was expecting because when I used to come here the ladies who were there were rude. \\n\\nThe decor is super cute and fun, plus the windows are a good addition to their look as it makes it look brighter and more welcoming. They've also added 2 tables for outdoor seating. Although, it is on the pricier side and they're constantly busy with many take out orders, so it feels rushed. \\n\\nStreet Corn - No complaints, it was delicious. \\n\\nCarne Asada Quesadilla - Your average Quesadilla \\n\\nCajun Shrimp Taco - Could be better for it being $4.99 per taco... it's flavorful yet plain. It only comes with 2 pcs of shrimp and 2 different types of sauces inside and nothing else. \\n\\nCarne Asada Bowl - I built my own, it was good but they make it so quick I couldn't adjust it to my liking. I like more rice than meat, and my bowl was drowning in meat. Barely any rice, I didn't finish it. They also don't mention additional charges at the register for some of the toppings like mango salsa. It's surprising though, because the bowl is already $10.99, I added guacamole and mango salsa: that's an extra $2. \\n\\nWe also tried their Limeade and Horchata, $2.99, but very good.

If you don't know, Nakato is a hibachi restaurant, so you literally see your food cooked in front of you. They place you in rooms, Japanese style, meaning no shoes, so make sure your socks match amongst other things to not embarrass yourself. Also they will sit you side by side with other people outside your party so be prepared for that.\\n\\nUpon getting there, there is complimentary valet and inside is pretty peaceful. It's not too loud but it sounds populated. I never had a drink from here but the food is amazing but pricey so prepare to spend some cash.\\n\\nEverytime I come I order the calamari steak, which is basically calamari chopped up into cubes. It's delicious. I eat it with fried rice and yum yum sauce. These meals all come with mushroom soup, and a iceberg lettuce salad with some strange brown sauce on it. It's not bad but it's a bit different. I recommend trying it first to see if you like it. I can definitely see someone not liking it. \\n\\nAs for the waiter service, impeccable. They are very attentive and are always looking out for your needs. As for the overall experience, it is pretty cool. You'll get the onion volcano, the spinning eggs and fire flares. Just be prepared because somehow I always get caught off guard when the fire part starts.\\n\\nLastly for the checks, PAY ATTENTION. They add their gratuity in them already for you. I don't go often but I always forget and tip extra. Which isn't bad but I gotta keep a budget and still tip the drivers. Overall it is definitely a good restaurant to experience.

The pit is right as you walk in so you can check out how they make everything. Seating is long wooden tables and benches. Everyone is pretty close so I saw a lot of chatting between tables. It's a really open, happy atmosphere.\\n\\nAs a vegetarian I wasn't super excited about going for myself but I was excited to give my husband a chance to have real Texas BBQ. He got some pork ribs and said it was hands down the best BBQ ever. I was only able to have slaw and potato salad. I was bummed and not thinking this was going to feel like a real meal. Wrong! It was the best slaw and the best potato salad I have ever had. Both are made with a homemade vinegar with onions, carrots and jalape√±os soaking in it and toasted sesame seeds.

She thanked him for noticing and offering to cook another. He politely apologized and asked again if she was sure.  About 2 minutes later the manager came to our table and offered to comp out the steak if she did not want another.  We declined  and said we would have a desert instead.

It depresses me that the owner has no passion to create flavorful, edible, and authentic dishes for his customers. In a foodie wonderland such as Portland, and on the heart of Hawthorne Blvd.; what a waste!\\n\\nWhen I moved on Hawthorne a year and a half ago, I saw the wood sign on the corner of 37th Ave. directing you to try the teriyaki and bento at Toney Bento's. I was excited because I love a good tasting, convenient Asian restaurant close to where I live! \\n\\nThe first time I went in there with my best friend, we got weird service from the waitress, and the owner/chef kept staring at us as we looked the menu over, and while we were eating. Definitely uncomfortable and unprofessional. The place was empty, may I add. My friend ordered an appetizer that was disgusting and not worth the money. I got a chicken plate that had no flavor and was unremarkable whatsoever.\\n\\nA few days later my partner and I were starving and he asked me if the teriyaki place had been any good. I didn't think much of it, but it was up to him to give it a try. He was starving and it was close, so we went in to get some food. I had the same waitress as I had a few days prior and she mentioned how my best friend the day before didn't seem like he had enjoyed the food he had ordered. I laughed uncomfortably because I didn't know how to say that yes, my friend hated the food he ordered and felt that it was a complete waste of his money. \\n\\nWell, my partner felt the same as my best friend and I. The sushi he ordered was inedible and disgusting. Sloppy and uninspired. Not a cheap place to eat either. \\n\\nWhen I walk by, and I do almost on a daily basis, the restaurant is NEVER busy and it's always dead. I wonder how he even stays in business in such an expensive area? I'm sure it's a front for some illegal business. \\n\\nTip: get better wait staff that don't have the shitty Portland hipster attitude, re-invent and make over almost every single dish you have on your menu, quit staring at your customers as they try to eat the subpar food you have audacity of serving them, and look excited to do what you're doing!

I mean the full-blown eatin' experience with the beer cooler, the pick-up truck, and the wife-beater in need of a good scrubbin' on a washboard. Then there's them vittles, too. Plenty of 'em with an open pit covered with sides of cattle previously known only to their mothers during the gestation period. That's a whole lotta meat, but then again, it's a whole lotta kinfolk that come stampedin' to Driftwood to get their combo plates of ribs, brisket, and sausage with all the fixin's. \\n\\nI had heard of Salt Lick only in passing when I was channel-surfing the Food Network where I was seduced by the claim that everyone in Austin treks there for barbecue. Jamie W. and I were taking a week-long road trip this past week between New Orleans and Austin, and this became one of our must-try places. We actually stopped by on our way back from San Antonio, thinking we could just casually grab a bite on Labor Day weekend. Fat chance, y'all. Imagine our disbelief when out in the middle of nowhere, we see the beer-guzzling masses converging on what looks to be a cabin surrounded by picnic tables and rows of cars and trucks parked like there was an IKEA sale on melamine shelving units (see photos). \\n\\nAt first, we were intimidated - but then we became impressed by how well organized the staff was in accommodating the hundreds of waiting customers. Like good lemmings, we left our names with the hostess, got an Olive Garden-style buzzer and were told there would be an hour wait. Meanwhile out on the wide-open patio, people were drinking beers they brought by cooler, keg or whatever means they deemed suitable for wetting their whistles. Free popcorn and lemonade were provided as well as a two-piece band playing some almost-recognizable Willie Nelson tune. Sure enough, an hour later, our buzzer flew into a tempest of flashing red lights, and we were more than ready for our barbecue eatin'. \\n\\nWhat surprised us was how smooth and cordial the experience was considering the multitude of people waiting for their piece of the cow. We even got our own picnic table in front of the big fan cooling the entire restaurant. It was our good fortune to be seated there on such a sweltering, humid day. The whole menu was invitin' for sure with our two Combo Plates priced at a reasonable $11.95 each (see photos). Jamie went for the Pork Rib, Beef Brisket and Turkey combination while I went for the same except I had the Sausage instead of the Turkey. Both of ours came with cole slaw (good), potato salad (middling and mushy) and baked beans (hard to beat) along with some pickles and some bread. \\n\\nHere's my verdict. The sausage and turkey were really good - not drop-dead great but still very good. The pork rib was excellent, so it was all the more frustrating that you only get one in a plateful of food. The brisket was tasty enough - though I should have read the Yelp disclaimer more carefully since they default to lean brisket in your order. Only when you mention \\"moist\\" brisket do you get the fork-tender beef for which I would have sacrificed both of Sophie's children and accommodated a roll in the hay with a Nazi storm trooper. Roll, roll, roll. \\n\\nPigs that we were, Jamie W. and I ordered another half-pound of Pork Ribs. And if that ain't enough for you jealous bulimics, we ordered a slice of their Pecan Pie with vanilla ice cream. Stop judging us. Well, it's doubtful I'll be in Driftwood any time soon, so we went full gusto with our meal. And indeed, it was satisfying and rib-tickling with great, friendly service. But it's really the full experience of driving the half-hour out of Austin to come to this pastoral patch of barbecue goodness that makes the whole damn thing worthwhile. Yee- haw! \\n\\nFOOD - 4 stars...stellar pork ribs are the stand out...and order that brisket moist! \\nAMBIANCE - 4.5 stars...way out in the sticks...and all the more reason that it's true destination dining \\nSERVICE - 4.5 stars...excellent considering how much they have to serve on a hot Labor Day weekend \\nTOTAL - 4 stars...definitely worth taking the truck out with the cooler and the wife in the flatbed"},{"name":"Little Bangkok","address":"2225 Cheshire Bridge Rd Ne","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Best Papaya Salad ever!

It definitely has a \\"by the seaport\\" feel to it, which fits the type of food served. There's a raw seafood bar and an entire wine menu for those with more refined taste buds. The place was packed, but my dinning companion and I were still able to squeeze in without a reservation. \\n\\nService (-): Service was absolutely horrendous. Never have I been to an upscale place where the majority of the staff are so stuck up, from the hostess who seated us to the waiter who served us. Our waiter, specifically, was very rude and inconsiderate. We sat there for a good 15 minutes before he came by to take our orders. At that point, we even considered just standing up and leave. When we asked him for suggestions, he just pointed without additional comments. I'm pretty sure he's not mute. And he did a lot of drive by deliveries of utensils and water with no eye contact. Condescending gestures like that really ruined the mood.  He did not check on us or ask about our meals. My friend wanted more lemons for her dish, but ended up giving up on the wait because our waiter was nowhere to be found. \\n\\nFood (+): No doubt about the freshness of the seafood served here. It's hit or miss when it comes to the actual entree because I enjoyed my order, but my friend did not. I had the warm buttered lobster roll with a side of coleslaw and homemade chips. I wasn't a big fan of the chips, way too greasy. They should probably replace it with fries or something. The coleslaw was good though, a pleasant balance of flavors. The lobster roll melted in my mouth and came with plenty of lobster. My friend had the clam bucatini, but did not enjoy it because it was too salty. It would've been better with a few squeezes of lemon to balance out the saltiness, but again that waiter situation mentioned earlier... \\n\\nPrice/value (-): I did not think the food was worth the big bucks. When it comes to dinning out, people always say that you actually pay for the entire dinning experience. It that case, it was a crap show and I literally inhaled my food to get out of there quickly. \\n\\nBottom line: I will not be returning here. I recommend that the establishment train their staff better. Service plays a huge part in a dinning experience, especially when the food is a tad pricier. The food was decent, but not decent enough for me overlook the crappy service.

I opted out of wine and remember the receipt was correct when I signed it, only to notice later on my bank statement that I had been charged the extra $11. Weird. I called them and they were very nice, took down my credit card info, and told me they would take the charge off.

As Sophia Petrillo would say, picture it - Boston, 1997.  \\n\\nI was a transplanted Californian in my freshman year of college, and one of the pickiest eaters on earth.  Let's put it this way, I had never met a chicken finger I didn't like.  But oh how I adored Chinese food.  Suckin' the brown sauce out of the fluffy end of a broccoli spear in my order of broccoli beef.  Dippin' the raggedy end of a spring roll into a tiny tub of sugary red sweet n' sour sauce so that it resembled a tasty severed limb.  Miles and miles of chewy noodles in my chow mein, savored as I took in my salt ration for the month in a couple of messy bites.  Life was gooooooood.  So imagine this suburbanite's delight upon my move to the bustling urban sprawl of Boston, MA that in metropolitan towns like this, you can get nearly any kind of food delivered at nearly any time of day.  If this all hadn't happened before the advent of online classrooms and I hadn't been forced to leave my dorms to trek to class, I would probably be writing this review from beyond the grave.  Gluttony - my favorite sin.\\n\\nNan Ling knew exactly what they were doing when they littered my dorm's front door every day with copies of their pink takeout/delivery menu.  I harmlessly picked one up to peruse, and the realization that I could summon Chinese food at any hour cued songs in my head!  \\"Here I am - rock you like a hurricane!\\"  Or was it \\"I feel the earth move under my feet!\\"  Either way, life changed forever.  And my freshman 15 showed up in record time.  \\n\\nHere's the thing about New England Chinese food that I remember - it's BROWN.  True of Nan Ling and other nearby spots, no matter what vegetable your dish includes, it will be rendered brown either by cooking, saucing or witchcraft.  Never in one order Nan Ling's fried rice did I see an orange carrot cube, or a crunchy green pea, or even a yellow chunk of egg.  But I saw piles of rice, withered overcooked eggs and crusty bits of BBQ pork.  At first sight my maiden voyage in Nan Ling's takeout was horrifying - a Californian has no idea what to do with food devoid of color.  But I had paid for it with my near non-existent cash flow, as is the college way, and it was enough food to keep me alive for days.  Along with the colorless fried rice I ordered chicken fingers (cuz I'm me), the Caucasian-friendly chicken chow mein, and the oh-so-intriguing barbecue boneless spareribs.  \\n\\nDry simple rice, weird beer-batter breading on the chicken fingers, and my first lesson in the east coast riddle of the difference between chow mein and lo mein.  In California, you see one or the other on the menu at your local place, and there is no clear distinction.  In Boston, it's night and day - chow mein gets you a soupy congealed glop of meat, veggies and corn starch served over Chun King-style crunchy noodles that most people only use as Chinese Chicken Salad toppings, while lo mein gets you those long soft pan fried noodles you probably wanted.  So as I opened my Nan  Ling takeout container to see chicken glop, I was horrified. But I tried it.  I tried it all.  \\n\\nMy twisted brain went to work and shoved the chicken fingers into the juicy mess of the chow mein, and that creepy batter had now transformed into a sponge.  Each squishy bite was better than the last!  I learned their fried rice tasted oh so good with sweet & sour sauce poured over until it congealed into a sugary Rice-Krispie-treat-like wad.  But the true magic lay in those BBQ boneless ribs - that might be the one thing they do truly right.  Char siu sauce absorbed into every molecule of the pork, equal parts succulent and chewy as hell.  Sauce and grease will run down your fingers.  Your heartbeat will skip.  You will lose control.  I did.  For 3 1/2 straight years, at least once a week like clockwork, they delivered that same order to my dorm.  Remember in that Sex and the City episode when Miranda calls her favorite Chinese place to order her usual and they laugh?  I have lived that moment, many times.  A quick perusal at their website shows that all items I adored are still available for about the same price.  The pictures on Yelp are like a trip in a time machine. My mouth shamefully waters at the sight!  \\n\\nI haven't had Nan Ling's creepy delights in more than a decade, but I still miss it.  Who knows if it even tastes the way I remember.  It looks exactly the same.  And judging by the miles of grossed-out reviews, not a thing has changed.  The rumor mill when I was in school was there was a Chinese delivery place that had famously delivered a takeout order topped in jizz, an urban legend so ridiculous it was immortalized in Good Will Hunting.  Many people think Nan Ling was that place.   Are you brave enough to sample their wares, despite what all the naysayers spout off?  Will you survive the night?  Just take a deep breath, and dial that delivery number..."},{"name":"Tandoor Indian  Kitchen","address":"406 SW Oak St","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"Just had lunch here.

It had some purpleish thin veggie in it which I was told were \\"bracket\\" - apparently a type of fern stem, and super yummy.  That with scallions and shredded beef in spicy broth was pretty much exactly the right portion for me.  Though they come in huge bowls, neither dish is really ideal for sharing.  If I'd gone with more than just one other person I'd have wanted to get some galbi or other in-table bbq, but I was pleased with my meal.  I'll say, tho, that while I'd order the Yuke Jang again, I wouldn't likely order the scallion pancake again.  Neat that it had kimchi, but I found it eggier and less crispy than how I prefer my scallion pancakes generally.\\n\\nPrice tag is a little hefty for what you get, but perhaps that's because it comes with so many small sides.  I myself was partial to the fish cakes (looked like tofu), the pickled daikon, and the pickled scallions.  Service was excellent.

We thought that the restaurant was trying to get rid of their fish they had on hand and did not get fish delivered since it was the holidays. We told our waitress that the calamari was \\"past its expiration date\\".  She apologized and offered to provide another appetizer of our choosing and took the calamari off our bill.  I ordered the pear and butternut squash soup, but it tasted very bland and appeared watered-down.  I didn't complain but also didn't eat the rest of it.  Our entrees were pretty good.  I had the Bolegese pasta dish and my wife had the filet.  We have had good meals on previous visits to Aquitaine and were disappointed this time.

Last night, however, was a miserable experience.  My burrito was so terrible, my queso was cold, and my roommates quesadilla was not made correctly.\\n\\nIt was obvious they were training someone, but that really came through in the product.  For example, my roommate got the chicken club quesadilla and they didn't add bacon, even the person supervising him didn't remember to add the bacon (which they certainly charge for).  \\n\\nI got a Joey Jr, like I always do, and it was so bad.  If I had the time, they would have been remaking it but we had appointments to get to and were already running behind.  My tortilla was stale, the pinto beans were not cooked thoroughly and were hard, the cheese in my burrito also did not melt, at all meaning all of the ingredients were luke warm at best.\\n\\nHow can Moes have bad queso?  It's so disheartening.  Just replace it.  It was 7pm, not closing time, just do things right people.  Also, if the guy you are training does not know what goes in each item, he shouldn't be on the line.  That is training 101; learn ingredients and how to prep properly, THEN hit the line and put those new skills to use.  It was an absolute embarrassment and I feel bad for the guy actually training as he got no real guidance. \\n\\nLastly, it is really really upsetting to see the Assistant Manager constantly high.  This comes through in how the staff acts when he is there, and also in the quality of the product they put out.  When the actual manager is there, the experience is top notch and always perfect; she really cares and understands that while she makes a hundred burritos a day, you aren't eating a hundred burritos a day so she does a great job which is super appreciated.\\n\\nOverall, while I will be back, last night was so bad.

I politely told her that is not what I thought I was going to get when I ordered a slice of pizza and said I did not want it.  The manager I am assuming he was the one I could see cooking in the front came out and told me this was how the slices were made but he would not go ahead and charge me for it ???? Really geez thanks sorry you just pulled off the pepperoni pizza that had been sitting around for a while by the look of the cheese and throw canned mushroom on top and not even heat it up.  Then the large pizza we ordered for my husband and kids had liquid pooling in the middle making it a soggy mess. Also no flavor even with the veggies and meat.

After our drinks arrived at the table (in good time), we ordered fish & chips (for the 3rd time, so I'd say it's good) fish tacos and a reuben. \\nThe fish tacos have a nice amount of spice and heat. There is a cabbage slaw that is a little sweet and nicely compliments the spice.  The flour tortilla is not heated before being filled but is sturdy and held up well to the slaw dressing. Two lime wedges were on the plate but sadly they were mostly dry - I got a few drops of juice out of them, but would have like a nice citrus squirt. The side salad I ordered is a bowl of lettuce. I won't do that again. \\nThe reuben was not 'the best' but certainly good.  Sandwiches comes with house made chips but the fries were substituted. They are fresh and very tasty. A side of ketchup was included on the plate. The fish and chips portion is generous and is served with coleslaw and fries. All the ingredients seem to be good quality here.\\nI ordered a coffee after lunch and boy was this coffee strong!  It was good, but not particularly hot and got cold before I finished the mug.

We got their pork shoulder that was wood fired which actually in my opinion is something that I would not order again. Matt J. was pretty sad with his choice in choosing that one because it tasted kind of like normal deli meat...\\n\\nBUT I got their pork pate which was only $4 and it consisted of 4 HUGE SLABS OF PATE! I literally was in awe and had to ask our waiter if that was only one order of pate so that I would not be charged for two, it was that much food. That pate paired with the dijon mustard was quite perfect in every way. It was so so hot on Friday and we had been out drinking so I wanted a nibble, but a nibble that wouldn't be too filling and this hit the spot. Everyone who tried it loved it. Our other friend got the stilton cheese and any place that has a good cheese selection is pretty much automatically my friend :-) \\n\\nThey do have some non-pork dishes in case you aren't a pork eater, but really, if you come here you need to eat pork. They even have a salty pig pizza that comes with the chef's selections of pig parts on it which people in our group really enjoyed. All of that salty piggy goodness paired very well with their actually pretty decent beer list too. Plus we called late on a Friday for our party of 8 and they still were able to set up a patio table for all of us, which is A+ service in my book.\\n\\nSalty Pig, you are one little piggy that I wish would come \\"wee wee wee wee\\" all the way home with me!"},{"name":"Native Bowl","address":"4233 N Mississippi Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"Mississippi bowl with BBQ soy curls = yum!

Heard good reviews from others about this place, so we gave it a try.  \\n\\nThe location is little hidden and in a unusual area.  It wasn't until at the end of the visit, we found out that this restaurant had a parking lot so we valeted.  We panicked at first when we drove past the location as we saw the complementary valet sign.  We usually don't carry around cash and was in a hurry to find a bank to satisfice our hunger/our first meal of the day.  Valet was a surprise to us, as this neighborhood didn't look like a place to have valet in the first place...\\n\\nOnce we got in the restaurant, it took a good couple of minutes until the hostess came to greet us.  I can understand a little as it had just opened, but couple servers met eyes with us and there was no rush in getting the hostess or in greeting us.  Service at the table, however, was good.  The food came out fast and the server came to check up on us frequently.  This may be due to the fact that there are two dining sections to this restaurant.  One, hibachi, and the other for the regular sushi eaters.\\n\\nWe tasted the following: Grilled Calamari, Nabeyaki Udon, Chicken Fried Rice, Dragon Roll, and Spicy Salmon Roll.  The grilled calamari and udon was pretty good.  However, the udon can't really compare to one of my favorite places , which is currently shutdown due to relocation.  Sushi was okay, wished the restaurant had more roll options and allow me to order special rolls.  The chicken fried rice was a big disappointment.  The chicken was dry to the max and the rice was stale and can only taste butter.  Usually, if it's a hibachi place, you would think the fried rice was good...  Wouldn't go there for hibachi.\\n\\nI guess, overall, this place was an okay place.  Wouldn't be one of my favorites but I wouldn't mind giving it another try in the future.  \\n\\nJust wanted to give some tips for future visitors: \\n1)Remember to bring cash for valet or find the hidden parking lot on Piedmont \\n2) Use Yelp to get a free roll... Unfortunately, we did not get to utilize this deal because we had missed to read this on Yelp \\n3) Walk around the quaint japanese garden behind the restaurant."},{"name":"Linn City Pub","address":"19389 Willamette Dr","city":"West Linn","stars":"4","text":"If your an immigrant, I would not go to this place.

What Happened to this place?\\n\\nWent with a group of friends to catch up and hang out at one of our favorite places, The Blitz.  So disappointing.  This was on a Friday night and the place was very slow.  We figured it would be hard to find a table.\\n\\nFirst of all, service was solid and I truly appreciate that.  Very helpful and explained the menu items when asked.  Tables were clean, as was the pub in general.\\n\\nThe main trouble for me was the menu itself and the food.  One issue is that I checked the menu online before heading out to meet my friends there.  Old menu online, new menu in the pub.  Blitz has changed up their menu a few times in the past year or so, making it simpler and more condensed.  The trouble is, it's gotten overpriced and the value for what you get has crossed the line.  One of my favorite items was their nachos.  You can easily split a platter with someone.  Cost was $7.95 and you got a huge plate of chips with melted cheese, black beans, jalapenos, along with roasted salsa, fresh guacamole, and a really nice cilantro sour cream.  Great value and you certainly didn't think twice about ordering an extra beer or two.\\n\\nNow it's $6.50 but get this, you have to pay $1 each, that's right, each, for anything else besides chips and cheese.  I asked about this specifically and it was confirmed by the waitress.  What a total ripoff.  I mean who pays $1 more for jalapenos?  Totally silly and rather insulting to me as a customer.    \\n\\nI was going to attempt the pizza, but $12 for a thin 9inch with minimal toppings is nothing worth ordering.  I checked out a couple pies some folks nearby had ordered.  I ended up ordering the hummus wrap with fries.  Fries were nearly cold, and the wrap, while tasting pretty good, wasn't any kind of value at $9.95.  I realize that food costs go up, as well as other expenses but I'm a business guy and I know food costs in general.  Things like nachos and pizza are some of the best value items pubs can offer, and the return on those items is always good. \\n\\nOther trouble is that they have completely taken away some of the events that made the Blitz so interesting.  They used to have table tennis tournaments and now it's all gone.  The room where the tables were has been converted into a video game room.  Come on, you take away a really cool event that you won't find many places this available anywhere in SE Portland?  For what, a kids room basically.  I should add that the room was empty all night when it could have been filled with people watching a game and people showing up to play that order food and drinks.  Very sad.\\n\\nOverall this is a decent place to go, and we all know the Blitz has their special relationship with the Blazers.  I might still go catch a game or two here.  However, as a customer who enjoys spending time with friends and eating some great pub fare with a few good beers................I think we'll be going elsewhere in the future.  Sorry Blitz, you aren't fooling me anymore."},{"name":"Antico Forno","address":"93 Salem St","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"Visited Boston three times in the last year and now one of the highlights is going to the Italian neighborhood to walk along the streets and find somewhere that looks good.

We were put at a two-seater table in the middle of the right section, which was so close to another two-seater, that it actually felt like one big four-seater.  Luckily, no one came and sat there so we were able to enjoy moderate privacy.  Average to loud with all the conversations going on, couldn't hear if there was music, and the place at least half full out of maybe 30 tables in total or so?\\n\\nFriendly service and we were observing some of the staff who were very prompt and on the ball all evening.\\n\\nMy partner had the Saltimbocca di Pollo ($20 seared chicken breast topped with parma prosciutto and fontina cheese in a madeira mushroom wine sauce with saut√©ed garlic spinach) which he quite liked except for the spinach.  He expected that it would've been in smaller pieces spread throughout the dish, versus just a spoonful on the plate. Our Caesar salads were very good and plentiful, so much that it could be a meal in of itself if you are not the type of person who can eat giant meals.  The free bread was nice and soft but added to salad, I could barely look at my entree when it arrived, and I AM a big eater.  lol  I ordered the Ai Funghi pizza ($17 wild mushrooms, fresh homemade mozzarella, goat cheese, cherry tomatoes and fresh arugula) and it was bigger than your average personal size pizza, so I was only able to force down three small slices, 1/4 of the whole thing.  It was loaded with lots of arugula which was different but nice.  Unfortunately, our hotel room didn't have a fridge in it so I took this to go, and was still way too full a couple of hours later to finish it.  Then after it sitting out at room temperature all night, I was hesitant to eat it the next day, since who knows if the cheese would still be okay.

Chicken fingers were plentiful in volume but the chicken in the finger was scarce, mostly breading that held the oil like a sponge.  The pork buns, were forgettable at best only a small amount of filling...though the bun portion was good.  The pork fried won-tons were tough...just the won-ton portion.  The filling was good and a high point of the meal.  I don't think a Saturday night meal will be in the works for me for a while, as I already have the McGurgles.  They really need to turn up the heat on the fryer so the food doesn't hold the oil.  If I was drunk it could be good.  Hmm the night is young....\\n\\nOkay 20 minutes after having some of the food and It is not good.  It is past the McGurgles.  Into a new frontier, to the Pepto-Bismol!\\n\\nJust a postnote, you know when you order a lot of chineese food you look forward to eating it the next day?

Back then it looked shady as f@#$. But it has a new look and it looks really good now. I never saw anyone in this place before so I don't know if it was closed or just scared everyone away. The inside was nice and clean with lots of seating and lots of color. The A/C must be broken because it was almost unbearably hot inside the lobby. But the new face lift looks really good and when I got there the drive thru lane was packed.\\n\\nMenu - fast food joint that obviously specializes in dogs. They have numerous amounts of hotdogs like Chicago, chili, sauerkraut and some other nice takes on what can come on a hotdog. They also have corndogs which is something you don't find very often.  If you don't feel like a dog they have burgers and also chicken burgers.  If you have a sweet tooth then you can also indulge in some shakes.  Menu is actually kind of big for a fast food joint so there is plenty of options for you to choose. \\n\\nService - came in and was greeted by a gentleman in his late 20s maybe early 30s.  He was a really nice guy but seemed a little off. I cant quite tell what it was but it was just odd. It almost felt like he was hitting on me or was just in a mindset of giving zero f***$. When he brought me my food he asked if I needed any condiments and anything else. The service was good, if not eccentric so that was a good start with the new look of the store. \\n\\nFood - I got the #5 combo which comes with a chili burger, chili dog, fries and a drink. When I ordered this the cashier called out \\"burger\\" to the kitchen.  The cook definitely was not pleased with this as he gave a gruff snort. Guess burgers take longer and aren't easy to make? Anyways I get my food. The fries were kind of sad. They were hot and fresh but they weren't cooked long enough as they were super limpy.  So the texture and consistency of them was kind of like having potato flavored playdoh in my mouth. I unwrapped the burger and dog, and obviously they are going to be messy.  I mean come on, having chili on anything is going to make this a fun sloppy time. The hot dog had a piece of American cheese put in the bun then the dog on top and then chili on top. Oh come on, this is nowhere near what the picture looks like. The hotdog was ok I guess. The chili is the standard \\"homestyle\\" that you get from like Sysco or Ben E Keith. It has on ok flavor but nothing special. The actual hotdog was the star, which I hope it would.  It had a nice flavor that was actually surprising. So the hotdog was a sad attempt.  The burger was very small.  It is the size of a coaster or a cellphone. Pretty small but I did get a combo meal so maybe the meals with just a burger might be bigger. Idk. The burger was just meat, bun and chili.  The patty was pretty small so I basically could only taste the chili. So there isn't really anything to be said about the burger because it was nothing. I actually didn't finish the burger because I had enough chili taste going on.  \\n\\nOverall - for me there was nothing special or good about my food. All 3 items were pretty subpar even for a fast food joint.  So my advice is get a corndog or one of the specialty hotdogs.  Because they do have a good meat for the hotdog. I give the 2 stars for the service and the new facelift.

Our server never once during whole meal came back to ask if we wanted anything else. The server avoided all tables, never looked at tables, just brought food or took an order and then was not around.  Most of the time all the servers during both visits were not on floor. It seems like the servers hide in back, or maybe they are also the cooks and bartenders as everything takes too long. No one ever asked if we needed refills on drinks, which we did.  No one asked if we wanted to order anything else.  Runners with food had to be asked to take empty appetizer plates with them. We had to flag other servers (with much difficulty) several times to get things. At end of meal, long after we finished, server showed up and asked if we would like dessert.

Since my companions are cold, we figured we'll take a chance with Chambar. The 4 star rating seems to be promising- at least that's what we hoped. \\nThis restaurant serves Belgian cuisine- they serve waffles, moules et frites. At $29 CDN, I'm finding the price of this dish slightly on the high side. I don't think we paid that much for mussels and fries when we dined out in Bruges. \\nSo what we settled for are the breakfast dishes. My hubby went for the Mezzes, I decided to try paella,my son went for the country side dish of cassoulet while my daughter ordered merguez et pain Morocain. \\n\\nIt took a bit for our dishes to arrive because this place is just busy. But when the dishes arrived, there was this wow factor. \\nI thought it was so creative to serve dishes in a cast iron skillet. Also, I expected short grain rice but was given orzo. The excitement only lasted a short while, though- until I dug in. \\n\\nAlthough I love their take on paella, the flavors that I'm used to in a paella was just not there. A paella should have a signature taste of saffron but this dish is terribly lacking that flavor. It really reminds me more of a pilaf. The best thing in this dish was pretty much the Portuguese linguica. The egg is cooked to a sunny side up which may not fly if you don't like your egg runny. There were veggies but they're pretty much piled up on the side as a salad. I was given this Harissa flavored condiment (is it sour cream?) on the side and I don't know what to do with it. This dish is just as confusing to me because IT IS REALLY NOT A PAELLA. \\nAlso, THE DISH IS OVERWHELMINGLY GREASY. I love that they serve the dish in a cast iron. Along that note, cast iron is low maintenance as a cooking tool because you can abuse it but it can't be washed with soap. I understand that they want nothing to stick with it but the grease is just a big turn off. Overall, the paella dish is okay but it's not worth coming back for. \\nAlong this note, we love a good cassoulet because my hubby is French. A cassoulet is pretty much your decked up bean dish and each beans should reflect the smokiness of the meats and the earthiness of the ragu and the spices. Each beans should be bursting in savory meaty and earthy flavor because a cassoulet is the Rolls Royce of all the bean dish; unfortunately, the dish my son got was pretty much okay. Perhaps this restaurant should not have called their breakfast dish a cassoulet because it's really far from that. \\n\\nOn a good note, all the sausages that came with our meals were good; my latte was exceptional and the service is great! My hubby loved his dish Mezzes and so did my daughter. \\n\\nWe might go back someday to try the waffles. We're not in a hurry though. \\nService 4\\nAmbience 5 \\nTaste 2 \\nPrice 3"},{"name":"Atlanta Breakfast Club","address":"249 Ivan Allen Jr Blvd","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4.5","text":"Very good food with quick and friendly service.

Don't miss out on the best pizza in Austin!"},{"name":"Antico Pizza","address":"1093 Hemphill Ave NW","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"A lot has changed since my first review of Antico.  I reviewed the restaurant in October 2009, shortly after it opened.  Since that time, over 700 more reviews have been written for this neighborhood pizza joint.  A few things have changed at the restaurant too, so it's time for an update.\\n\\nThis place has become extremely popular.  It seems to be busy around the clock now: dinner, lunch, weekends, weekdays.  Expect a full parking lot and full restaurant.  The restaurant isn't very big to begin with, but at least more seating has been added in the kitchen area.  Designated the \\"Dough Room,\\" it has three picnic-style communal tables and one high-top table (with TV tuned to sports).  This seating is in addition to the large communal table outside and the countertop-style seating along the wall and windows.\\n\\nIf you choose to dine-in, the eating experience here is unique.  You'll be dining in the company of others.  This place has an energetic feel and buzz about it.  In the Dough Room, you can see the giant woodfire ovens owner Giovanni Di Palma imported from Italy and all of the pizzas being made by hand.  The room is warm because of the ovens.\\n\\nThe pizzas come out fast, no matter how busy the restaurant is.  All of the pizzas come in one size and cost about $20 each.  Don't let the Euro pricing on the menu confuse you - there is only one price and one size for each pizza.  They're all authentic Neapolitan pizzas.\\n\\nMy favorite pizzas are the Margherita D.O.P. ($18) and the San Gennaro ($21).  The Margherita D.O.P. is a great basic pizza that everyone can like.  D.O.P. stands for \\"Denominazione di Origine Protetta,\\" which means the pizza uses real San Marzano tomatoes, grown in Italy.  In addition to the tomatoes, the Margherita uses buffalo mozzarella, basil, and garlic.\\n\\nThe San Gennaro comes with sausage (salsiccia), sweet red pepper, buffalo mozzarella, and small onions (cipolline).  This is my favorite among their pizzas served with meat.  The pieces of sausage of big and hearty.\\n\\nThe pizzas come out hot from the oven and are served on a baking tray.  The crust varies from slightly charred to very charred and is super soft and deliciously chewy.  The slices themselves can be quite floppy and messy to eat.  You may want to consider eating with fork and knife.  In the Dough Room, you can pick up some complimentary cheeses and seasonings to add to your pie, such as freshly crushed red pepper and black pepper and whole red chilis.\\n\\nDrinks are of the refrigerated, bottled variety.  Cokes and Sprites ($2.50 each) come in small 8.5 oz. bottles.  I've seen several customers BYOB (beer, wine) even though a sign on the front door says \\"No Outside Drink.\\"\\n\\nIt's interesting to note the sinks located near the big communal table and one in the Dough Room.  If your hands get messy, you can wash them in the middle of the restaurant.  These sinks are good for drinking (free tap) water too.\\n\\nService is fast and efficient.\\n\\nParking space has expanded to include two additional private, marked lots.  Oftentimes, even those are full.  In those cases, park along Ethel, where you shouldn't have a problem finding a spot.\\n\\nThere's only one restroom, which is unisex.  Outside the restroom are some autographed wooden pizza peels signed by various \\"celebrity\\" visitors to Antico, such as Arthur Blank, Kasim Reed, Andrew Bynum, Chris Rock, and Alton Brown.\\n\\nAntico is open Monday-Saturday from 11:30am until the dough runs out.  Closed Sundays."},{"name":"Tamarind Indian Cuisine","address":"501 N Orlando Ave, Ste 149","city":"Winter Park","stars":"4.5","text":"This is my favorite local Indian restaurant and has been for years.

It is cooked in an incredible red sauce tossed with saut√©ed onions, flavorful Italian sausage, and topped with creamy Ricotta. Be warned!!!

If you don't have a table, they will just set your pizza on a box in the corner and leave you to eat standing up. Therefore you have to stand around the tables, like a vulture, and give people the evil eye until they get up. Not that I did that. \\n\\nIn all seriousness though, if you eat here, and your party is finished eating, and there are obviously people waiting for seats, don't just sit there chatting!

The place was very clean and you can see what's going on behind the counter. The guys working the counter were polite and helpful in understanding the menu and process.

We were going to try \\n\\n La Bbq, Smitty's, Black's, Kreuz and Salt Lick. Franklin is out of the question since we are seniors, and are not willing to wait in line for hours.  Our first BBQ experience was La BBQ, and it was great....the beef and pork ribs were moist, smoky and falling of the bones. The sausage was also good, firm and had a great7 taste. \\n\\nOur second trip was to Driftwood, and was surprised how big the place was. There were several areas, pavilions and outside seating that literally could serve hundreds of people The place was nice....good decorations  and beautiful gardens. But I had a bad feeling it was not going to be great because of the size. It is extremely hard to serve great food if you are trying to cater to hundred of people at the same time. Nevertheless, we ordered pork and beef ribs, and sausage. The meat on both stucked to the bones, and was hard to eat. The sausage was so so compared La BBQ. My suspicion about the place  was answered when taking pictures all over the restaurant, we found two huge enclosed grillers in the back of the restaurant. I think the restaurant is no longer doing their bbq the old fashion way......not using enclosed griller but everything in that small open pit bbq you see when entering the restaurant. I think people should be informed about this change. It's the prize you pay when you get too popular.

So happy we chose this place.    \\n\\nThe inside is very bright and modern looking, which made for a great brunch atmosphere.

Like many small businesses, most of my favorite places have disappeared.  \\n\\nAbout the Yellow Curry Chicken - \\nThere are a few Chinese dishes that win me over, although not a traditional Chinese dish, Yellow Curry Chicken is one of my all time favorite baseline entr√©es. When it's done well it's amazing and can easily be adapted into a soup, salad or stir fry. I make it home, but still enjoy exploring venues. How difficult can it be to get this right in Portland? Apparently VERY! My decades of eclectic tastes tell me the best yellow curry stir fry should be bright in color and flavor. A vast majority of restaurants around Portland make it muddy brown in color and sadly the taste seems to always match the color, flavorless and dim. I ordered the lunch special yellow curry to go. Immediately I was hopeful as I could see the dish was the nice bright yellow I have grown accustomed to. To my pleasant surprise the taste was the closest thing I've had to what I expect. A nice mild heat with a rich and smooth tasting yellow curry sauce, maybe just slightly heavy on the chicken stock profile, but certainly a winner by comparison within a 30 mile radius. Delicious. Thankfully no water chestnuts in it either, they really don't enhance the dish any. Typically it's accompanied with green bell peppers and onions, and sometimes thinly sliced carrots. The chicken was thin, light and cooked just right, not dry and not gristly, scallions played a small supporting roll in the cast. Would have liked a little larger portion and more bell peppers, but at this stage in the game, I'm not going to hold it against them. They also offer curry beef, I would imagine it's the same flavor base. One of my old favorites was a dish called \\"Curry Two-Flavor\\" which was basically your standard yellow curry with both beef and chicken, maybe I can get them to make it for me, I'd even pay extra for it. The lunch special comes with no soup (most places don't include it in to go orders anyways), three crispy wontons drizzled with sweet n' sour sauce instead of an egg roll and pork fried rice. The pork fried rice was nothing special and a bit on the bland side. As a lunch special at $6.95 it's definitely a deal regardless, they even still sell sides of plain rice at $1.50 vs the $2-$3 others places charge. No utensils on to go order, which is fine since I never use them, soy sauce packet and a fortune cookie.\\n\\nChow Mein is also one of those dishes that can be a little confusing to order and Chiam has the style I like. In cities like LA and many other restaurants chow mein is considered a soft noodle dish, like Low Mein. Here, it's mostly stir fried bean sprouts, celery and onion cooked in a clear-ish thick sauce and served over crispy dried noodles. Most places don't serve it or call it something else, like subgum chow mein, which depending on where you go will be heavier on the celery and water chestnuts and less on the bean sprouts. To round things off, if you want soft noodles you have to differentiate them as pan fried. What?!?\\n\\nSo far so good. All in all I have no gripes about this place. It is a bit of a hole in the wall, don't expect a fancy interior or a PF Changs fine dining experience filled with trendy fusion flavors, it's an old Ma and Pa establishment that's probably never seen a remodel or menu upgrade since their inception. Staff was friendly, easy parking on all sides of the building and no wait on my to go order. Main entrance is disabled friendly on the NE corner and full of booths in the main area, bar entrance is on east facing side with ramps and there's a covered outdoor smoking patio. I didn't go into this side but I believe they have the usual lottery machines with your local going patrons. Will certainly come back coon to try some other flavors."},{"name":"SOHO Restaurant","address":"4300 Paces Ferry Rd SE, Ste 107","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Besides the atmosphere and the food there is a little gem of a server..Jennifer......Please ask for her station..we sat in the back patio...bright charming and she added all else for a wonderful evening."},{"name":"McDonald's","address":"1513 Dorche Ster Ave","city":"Dorchester","stars":"2.5","text":"**beware** ROACHES I saw two when I came in tonight at 8pm 10/12/18 to get my daughter happy meals.

It all went well together. \\n\\n-Cape Codder: highly recommended. Again, the Challah bread!! Do not change anything about this sandwich. It is done right. That cranberry mayo is delicious as the spread with that melted provolone cheese. Hmmmm. \\n\\nOverall: good place to eat and good meet up location. I like that it's a book store as well as a cafe.

I must say the salmon was good and buttery, then second would have been the tuna. all the other fish were mediocre.\\n\\nin addition, we even tried their toro nigiri.. which was priced at $5 a piece. that's half the price of a piece from hayakawa. that should have been a sign of the quality. when we bit into the roll, it was so cold that it was obvious that the toro has been recently defrosted. what a waste of $$ and such a disappointment. please spare yourself the $5 and skip the \\"toro\\" from nakato and try hayakawa's \\"ootoro\\". \\n\\nrandom fact: toro is \\"fatty tuna\\"    VS.  ootoro is \\"super fatty tuna\\"\\n\\nof all the new dishes we tried, there were no wow factors. nothing worth of remembering, craving, or the 30 min. drive. again, save your money and spend it somewhere like umezono or maru sushi. you'll leave satisfied, full, and with $100 to spare."},{"name":"Cibo e Beve","address":"4969 Roswell Rd, Ste 245","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Overall a solid meal, one of the better Italian spots in the area. \\n\\nStarters: The calamari was tasty. Even better were the candied peppers sprinkled over the top and the marinara sauce on the side. Nicely fried, well-plated, overall well done. The three people I dined with raved about the Brussels sprouts. Loved them, loved the roast, loved the seasoning. They were flavorful, yes, but I found them to be a bit over cooked and mushy. A couple bites and I was done.\\n\\nEntrees: The orecchiette sausage dish was awesome. I'm leaving the \\"broccoli\\" out of the description because it largely was left off my plate. That being said, the pasta, sausage, and sauce were excellent: one of those dishes where you keep eating even though your pleasant food baby has become angry food twins. I would have liked to try the flounder with risotto, but my partner cleaned the entire plate in seemingly seconds. He clearly liked it. The pappardelle with short rib ragu was delicious and rich: it made for a nice leftover lunch the next day. \\n\\nThe host was pleasant. He gave us options of where we'd like to sit (a nice touch!) and checked in partway through the meal to make sure all was going well. The waiter was knowledgeable about the menu. He expertly timed taking orders, serving of dishes, and giving us the check, so that we had plenty of time to relax and socialize, without overstaying. The flow to the meal was impeccable. Parking is tight in front of the restaurant, but there's a sizable lot near the back of the building. The hilly walk to the car is somewhat welcome after such a rich dinner. Prices overall were on the high end of the range for the area, but in keeping with the quality of service: pasta in the low to mid $20s, and meat dishes in the mid $20s to mid $30s. \\n\\nOverall, we will return!"},{"name":"House Special","address":"1269 Hamilton Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4","text":"I see all these reviews with 3-Stars and below and honestly...

The various seafood and pasta dishes are wonderful. Not a great selection of beer or wine, but okay.\\n\\nThe bad, well, lots of tourists mixed with locals and the line can be bad. That's Giacomo's. Cash only, okay, that is not a secret so bring cash or hit the ATM across the street. Biggest complaints are how crowded it always is--they literally could not fit another table in there, but the major downer for me is the keyword for Giacomo's wait staff is \\"turnover\\". You'll never bitch about slow service, rather, you don't get the impression this place is for a lingering meal: get in, get your drink, get your appetizer and meal at about the same time, eat while the server comes by frequently, and get the hell out. There is always pressure by the wait staff to hurry up because, after you plop down your money, they want to take that next person in line. There are places with great food nearby that will let you stay until they roll up the sidewalks, but, despite the elbow-to-elbow conditions and the fact that the bum's rush doesn't make for a relaxing meal, it's still recommended."},{"name":"Barcelona Inman Park","address":"240 N Highland Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"My kids go to boxing at X3 sports, so the husband and I had lunch at Barcelona.

She was not helpful, it was a struggle to get an answer from her. I told her that I had shellfish allergy and she suggested shellfish dishes...ha. We did not pick any of her recommendations and went with the below dishes.\\n\\nBroccoli and cauliflower fritters- They were bland and dry\\nArtichoke. mushroom and goat cheese crostini- These were different, served cold, a little salty \\nRoast Duck leg with berry sauce- These were decent but nothing amazing\\nChicken croquette- They were the croquette of the day and were bland\\n\\nWe tried to order the beer braised short ribs but believed we were given the beef tenderloin as it was not a pan. We decided to try it anyways and I was not a fan neither was my friend but she finished it.\\n\\nI did not think the food was worth coming back for.

We thoroughly enjoyed our experience. We started with beers and prosecco which were both pretty good, a little pricey. The corn fritters were very tasty, crispy but still fluffy on the inside. Served with a great remoulade which I would love to try on their Po Boys. But, I went with the fried chicken. I completely disagree with other reviewers that say they do not have any flavor. There is a lot of fried chicken being served [on high street\\\\ that lacks any flavor. This is not where that is happening. There's a little bit of heat to the crunchy skin too. I got the smashed potatoes which have the skins and chunks inside that keep the flavor of a real potato...so if you like your potatoes to taste like garlic or cheese, don't get them. Oh, and the mac & cheese! It's got spice! Now there is a garlic flavor to the mac with the kick which is unique and isn't seen a lot of places..so I give them a plus for that.

Huge parking lot as there are tour buses that stop here.  This was the first place we hit when we arrived in Austin for UT graduation weekend.  They have most of your favorites (ribs, brisket and sausage) and an all you can eat option.  We did that for the table (4 of us).  It came with 3 sides of potato salad, slaw and beans.  The potato salad had sweet potatoes in it and was a hit at our table.  The slaw was next.  We think it had roasted sesame in it.  Slaw was not overly vinegary, nor too sweet.  Pared nicely with the bbq.  \\n\\nOn to the meats.  They do take their time with them as all were very tender and rubs you could literally pull the bone right out.  Great smoke ring on the brisket.  Over 1/2 inch.   And the sausage.  Phenomenal!   \\n\\nBecause this place does volume, we received our order within 5 minutes of placing it.  \\n\\nFYI. They do not have a liquor liquor license.  So it's BYOB. There is their own cellar on premises that you can go and purchase some of their wine from. Did I mention that this BBQ place is sitting in the middle of a TX vineyard?  If liquor is not your thing.
