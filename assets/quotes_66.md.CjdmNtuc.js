There's a great article from 1998 in Boston Phoenix:\\nhttp://www.bostonphoenix.com/archive/features/98/07/16/PHO_PASTEUR.html\\n\\nLe has at least five locations at this point (including \\"Le's\\" in the Harvard Square \\"The Garage\\").\\n\\nHave had lots of things from this place ranging from Pho Ga (chicken pho / noodle soup) to the beef pho and beef ball pho and non-pho. As well as take out. From a friend who went to Vietnam and lived there for a year, she said this was pretty good. Of course she lives in central Connecticut without much Vietnamese food. It is rather busy especially around lunch time. Partly because you can get your food very quickly so they can turn around customers relatively fast. In about 30+ times there, I've only had one order messed up (not bad!) -- and only for a large party.\\n\\nHighlights of this place:\\n+ definitely the fruit shakes. A tad pricy ($3+) but tasty. You can get stuff like Jack Fruit, pineapple, fresh mango, strawberry. I didn't see durian (heh heh).\\n\\n+ Pho (rice noodle soup): I have not had the seafood pho though. The beef and the chicken pho many times. I've tried to make pho and this is what I observe: Pho Pasteur may use MSG to make it more tasty. The chicken pho does not have fish sauce (although you can add it in yourself, and they give you a little container of it if you get takeout) probably to suit American taste. The broth is not overly salty although I suspect it is fairly salty (large probably like 800+mg of sodium). They usually do pho with onions, cilantro, and then you can add bean sprouts and Asian/thai basil and lime yourself.\\n\\nPho Ga is my go-to when it's cold and I need a warm soup or if I have a cold.\\n\\n+ the non-pho dishes were pretty tasty. They do have a vegetarian section.\\n\\n+ the hot sauces (Sriracha, chili garlic/sambal oelek, chili oil) and unlimited small green (Thai?) peppers\\n\\nOkay. I love hot food. I can handle \\"hot Indian vindaloo\\" and used to count the number of Thai peppers I could eat with my meal (currently 8 is about what I can handle without having indigestion or discomfort).\\n\\n+ value/prices (under $10 for a large or extra large pho!!) and portion size\\n\\nSome things that are okay or could be improved:\\n- cleanliness is middling (okay ...

We were seated promptly but with a bit of attitude from the waitress (there's not really a host here). An annoying thing about this restaurant is how cramped it is; even though you can get your own table for 2, it's pushed against another table for 2, so basically your party of 2 will be a party of 4, except you just won't know the other two people there. We didn't particularly like the mother and daughter sitting next to us with their snooty air and got especially ticked when they ate about 3 freaking clams from their entire appetizer and left the rest to be tossed. So wasteful... \\n\\nWe had those clams in the wine and garlic broth as a starter, and wow were those good. Nice, garlicky, with a bit of sand in the clams but not too much to notice it terribly. I loved the broth; wish we had more bread (we got only got 2 tiny pieces of bread, AFTER asking our waitress, and then we asked for another helping) to sop up that clammy goodness. \\n\\nWe also had the oysters, of course.. I can't remember all of them, but I do remember that we had the kumamoto and the pemasquid. This was my first time having raw oysters, and while they were very fresh and tasted interesting (sorry, this lack of detail is due to my lack of oyster experience), I'm not sure I'd want to get them again. \\n\\nWe then shared the cioppino and the lobster roll. The cioppino had too much heat in it; yes, on the menu it says it's spicy, but I really don't think the average person can take that much heat. I can tolerate slightly more than the average person and so can my boyfriend, but we both agreed that if they had to make it spicy to give options to diners if they wanted it mild, medium, or very spicy. Kind of ridiculous. But the lobster roll was DELICIOUS -- we had it hot with butter in a roll (how else can you have a lobster roll?), and there was a very generous amount of lobster. All the seafood we had that night was fresh. \\n\\nThe service, though, is something I was really upset about. From the moment we walked in we could tell the waitress had an attitude problem. She gave us a dirty look while we were getting seated, and in addition to that, she explained the sides and specials to the table next to us but didn't let us know that we had those options as well. And then, she also didn't give us the full wine list, but she DID do that for everyone else around us. I didn't even realize it until I noticed that all the other tables around us had one more menu than we had, and this was after we already ordered our drinks. We wondered if this may have happened since we were the only non-Whites in this restaurant... well, we could never really prove it. Our main courses also took a very long time to come; we probably spent over an hour waiting for them to come, which is really unacceptable. This isn't some large restaurant where several hundred people are being served. We asked the waitress if our dishes were coming, and she had this agitated look on her face and insisted they were coming. They didn't come for another 20 minutes after she said that. \\n\\nWhile the food was great and the seafood fresh, I'm still hesitant about coming here again because of the poor service and the long wait for the main courses.

There are two chocolate chip cookies making your sammie with salted caramel ice cream. Half of the ice cream sammie has a chocolate case shell with chopped hazelnuts.

They excel at this. What they do not excel at is consistent quality. And I use the 'q' word sparingly. It fills your belly, and chances are, it won't kill you. Sometimes, it even tastes okay, but the cheese must be made of some otherworldly material because it never melts, and the care taken in the kitchen is as different as well, night and day, during the two shifts. I think this was due to the owner (?)/manager's presence or lack thereof. The Jarritos (Mexican sodas) are decent, and the salsa bar is a nice touch, but it doesn't help raise this place above below average, even with the pleasant-looking plates of food they offer as specials (it's the same way in which fast food looks tantalizing in the commercials).."},{"name":"Neptune Oyster","address":"63 Salem St","city":"Boston","stars":"4.5","text":"Went around 11:15 to wait in line.

Intimate yet bustling, with a friendly staff, and amazing, rich food options.\\n\\nI started with the Bone Marrow, which is served with a topping of Chorizo, Calamari Salad, Peppers, and a squid ink flat bread. Personally, I'm a fan of dishes with a lot of competing flavors, and making a bunch of tiny wraps with all of the components was amazing. However, I felt like the Bone Marrow took a forgettable back seat in the m√©lange of flavors. Perhaps I should have just made a few with just the marrow.\\n\\nI also tried to do a bone luge, where you pour whisky down the bone canal after finishing, and it picks up the remaining fat with the shot... I will say, what got in my moth tasted delicious. Also, not much got in my mouth. So, you know, maybe practice with a friend before throwing a shot of whisky on yourself at a nice restaurant.\\n\\nNext, as everything looked so good, I decided to forego a main course for a few of the appetizers (I'm a small plates kinda guy.)\\n\\nThe Pork Belly was served on an apple pur√©e, with small green apple and sour cream accents on the plate, and was, quite simply, out of this world.\\n\\nThe Goat Cheese Gnocchi with Oxtail was also a rich and succulent dish, with the creamy goat cheese, perfectly puffy gnocchi, and rich thick oxtail combining into magical experience.\\n\\nBeing alone, this was as much as I could take...

Bread: tasty, grainy, and chewy, with a tiny layer of crispiness on the outside.  The rest of the vegetables and sauces seemed to dance around these two ingredients, but they worked well, with the exception of the squash, which tasted just a bit too under-marinated. \\n\\nWe also ordered the spinach artichoke salad, which was awfully plain.

Half a roll of shrimp half roll crab meat roll lobster meat 20$. Started with the crab was very good Jonah crab enjoyed it very much and I thought was a generous amount for a half a roll. The lobster again generous I thought was delicious. Not crazy about their special seasoning that they add will skip it next. The there was the shrimp. Tiny shrimp Not sure why I expected them to be larger but I did. But they didn't taste like shrimp and were a bit rubbery chewy I thought. Also the Bee ginger carbonated water unsweetened was very good. I would buy this in a market or store if I could find it.

She also mentioned on her final run before the food would be delivered that she was only wanting to prevent my dish from coming out 'wrong & I sending it back' since she KNEW that I didn't really want the Shrimp D'Angelo +mussels because 'I' must be thinking white wine = alfredo. \\n  \\nAt this time, I honored her stereotypical hints of being incompetent and happily obliged. I would not have the Shrimp D'Angelo + Mussels and she would 'win the battle'  by CANCELING the order. \\n\\nMerika then became upset saying she KNEW this would happen unaware that it was her over the top attitude that caused me to lose my appetite and also lose respect for the establishment.\\n\\nShortly after I voice my concerns, Will, an African American male server, greets my table proclaiming to be the manager although I did not request to speak to a manager. Will begins to ask what my concerns were with Merika. I then reply that he IS NOT the manager b/c he has on the same uniform as Merika and I have watched him wait on tables for the last 25 minutes, in addition to insulting my intelligence he owes us an apology. I then ask him to seriously send over the manager who was also an African American male named Greg. \\nGreg was dressed in a shirt and tie {see, I am smart lol!} apologizes for Merika's \\"presentation\\" then proceeds to place a buy one entree',receive an appetizer free comp card on the table totally ignoring Will's behavior. ABSURD. I then request to speak to the operating manager named Gavin, an older Caucasian male, to let him know the tom-foolery his staff has displayed for the evening.\\n\\nGavin A. is unaware of my original complaint and how a server pretended to be the operating manager in hopes of silencing  a customers valid concerns. He also apologizes for the way Greg, front of the house manager, gave an appetizer comp card as a means to rectify the solution and then notices that nothing was comped on the bill or offered to 'ease the pain' for at this time we had cashed out. \\n\\nAs a result, I politely let him know it was our (+1 co-worker) first time visiting the restaurant, we were not looking for any handouts, we reside in the Dunwoody area, and would not be repeat customers. Thank him for the horrible entertainment and wish him luck on his future customer-base then hand him the comp cards to seal the deal.\\n\\nHonestly, passing on the comp cards to friends or even strangers would only be promoting his business, which I will not do."},{"name":"Scratch","address":"223 W Fairbanks Ave","city":"Winter Park","stars":"4","text":"I've always been a fan of Scratch.

I decided to have my bday dinner here since I read reviews that they can handle big groups. Well that night they obviously couldn't. Our server was nice and pleasant but she was barely around and was always rushing off before we were done giving our order. It took a long time to give our order and then it took a long tome for everyone's food to come. The menu was a little different than what was online. I hatd wanted the lobster linguine but it wasn't on the menu. They were able to make me a lobster spaghetti. I liked tgst it had big chunks of lobster in it but overall I thought it was just ok. My husband ordered the occhi di lupo which had lamb sausage. I thought it was kind of dry and spicy. Two of my friends ordered the shared antipasti misto. They didn't enjoy it because it all came out mostly deep fried which they didn't know. Other friends ordered the shared pasta platter. They liked the pastas except for the squash filled cannoli. Finally our other friends ordered the shrimp linguine which they thought was ok. The best part of the meal was probably dessert. The chocolate torta was really good. It had espresso and sweet walnuts with it. The chocolate donuts were also decent.  \\n\\nOverall I don't think anyone in my group of fourteen will be coming back for dinner. We've had better food and service elsewhere."},{"name":"Olive Garden Italian Restaurant","address":"7300 W Colonial Dr","city":"Orlando","stars":"3","text":"I don't know why I keep coming back to this Olive Garden. I've lived in the area my entire life and have been to this location several times. My last experience was my breaking point. We went around 3 and it was pretty slow because it was right after lunch, and before dinner. We usually go out to eat anywhere around this time because the service is usually better and more personal. Anyways, I was wrong. We were seated by a very lovely hostess, I wish I had gotten her name because she was the most pleasant part of our experience. We waited at our table for about 15 minutes before our waiter decided to introduce himself to us. By then we already knew what we wanted to eat so we ordered. We got the 2 for 25. So our waiter brings out our breadsticks but not our drinks. Then he brings out our soup and salad, still no drinks. Not to mention our breadsticks were pretty stale, so at this point I was a little passed livid. He finally bring out our drinks and my boyfriend sent back the breadsticks and asked for fresh breadsticks, yet he brought out another batch of stale breadsticks. We gave up on it by then. About 10 minutes after the whole bread fiasco our waiter informs us that they're having technical difficulties with their computers and that he would put our orders in as soon as he could...... What? Are you kidding me? I've been in the restaurant for at least 35 minutes by then and he just decided to tell me he couldn't put our order in. Not once did a manager come around to check up. From now on I'm only sticking to corporate locations because it seems like that's the only way I end up happy. The best one by far is the one on lake buena vista, near downtown Disney."},{"name":"Food 101","address":"4969 Roswell Rd, Ste 200","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3.5","text":"Great find in northern buckhead/sandy springs area!

I ordered the trout for lunch b/c it was so good last time. But this time - the trout was disappointing. It probably didn't help either that I had trout just the day before at Empire State South and it tasted so much better ... or maybe they just had better sides. Murphy's North Georgia Trout came w/ roasted broccoli & cauliflower, parsnip whips, and brown butter for $12. The veggies were nothing special, and b/c the \\"parsnip whips\\" looked like mashed potatoes, my brain was thinking mashed potatoes which confused my taste buds b/c it tasted like potatoes infused w/ perfume. Maybe I'm just not a fan of parsnips.\\n\\nMy friend got the crabcakes but all I saw was a plate of mostly \\"matchstick potatoes.\\" I forgot to ask if she liked the dish but she didn't offer an opinion so I assume it was ok. \\n\\nService wasn't that great either - our server wasn't the warm & friendly type I'm used to getting when I come to Murphy's.

As others have said, food gets a 4, service a 4, and atmosphere a 5.\\n\\nA friend of mine and I came to Portland for a business trip and went downtown in search of some of the best PDX has to offer. Our prerequisites were a trendy restaurant with fresh seafood. Portland City Grill was a winner. At first I was skeptical -- a name so simple, could it really be what they claimed? But they delivered.\\n\\nWe both had chef's fish specials which are daily and rotate depending on what there is to be had. He had salmon with asparagus and a potato gratin (he and I have never liked potato with salmon, as it's often too strong a flavor better substituted with wild rice) and I had wild dungeness crab cakes with a small salad with a sweet vinaigrette dressing and deep-fried potato gnocchi. Both were very tasty dishes, excellently prepared and presented. It was just what the elements of the entrees were paired with.\\n\\nWhere we're from in the midwest, an area noted for their young but rapidly developing wine country, we were a little surprised at the wine prices. We both enjoy wine and make it a point to always try new, good wines from all over the world, but I did not see a single one I recognized on their list. Not to say they're bad -- just nothing recognizable, and thus I wasn't able to really make a judgement as to whether or not some of those bottles were really worth $40-$60 on average. \\n\\nThe atmosphere is what really made this experience though. VERY dimly lit, very warm passion colors inside, and an amazing view. Many have said it's better on nights where it's not raining, but to be honest as a first time visitor to the northwest coastal area of the states, rain is all I've ever heard of, I expected it, it was here, and it was so quaint and beautiful. We had a short trek from the MAX Line at the Pioneer Courthouse. It was raining a fair bit, and normally this would've had me throwing a fit, but for some reason I enjoyed it. We had great visibility last night.\\n\\nOverall, I recommend this place. Especially for first time visitors. It was a little hard to find. You have to go inside the lobby of the US Bancorp building, and take the elevator to the 30th floor. No signs or anything directing you to it. So just be aware. It's a huge lobby, and someone always there willing to help."},{"name":"Clyde's Prime Rib Restaurant & Bar","address":"5474 NE Sandy Blvd","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"We came here for Portland Dining Month and it was so good!

It's relatively dark at night after sunset, making for a date-night atmosphere. There's a big bar with two large servings wells, surrounded by booths and high tables. There are a number of low booths along windows looking out (from 30 stories up) on the Willamette River and downtown Portland. The dining room has a tables along the window (expect a wait, even with a reservation) and booths and tables away from the windows. Along the hall from the elevators to the dining room are private wine cellars.\\n\\nWe had a 20 minute wait for a window table, even with prompt arrival for our 8:30 reservation on Friday. The bar was about 75 percent full; the dining room was completely full, and stayed that way until we left after 10:30. Seating is far enough apart that \\"full\\" does not feel crowded.\\n\\nWhile waiting we had a drink in the bar. There was a TV tuned to a game over the bar, with the sound off. Drinks, sidecars and lemon drops, were excellent. Our waitress was friendly and efficient; when we wanted to chat with her, she was there, and she knew how to be scarce when we didn't want to talk (to her, anyway). The bar tab was invisibly moved to our dinner tab.\\n\\nDinner service was equally efficient. Our waiter was informative about preparations and ingredients, but didn't do the description of each ingredient, its provenance, family history, and turn-ons that can be really overbearing in the wrong setting (as this was).\\n\\nOkay, food. We started with the five-spice Peking duck and seared ahi tuna appetizers. The ahi tuna was excellent, seared just to cook the outer layer while leaving the inside just barely warm and red. Herself was impressed, and she is Queen of The Ahi. Better still was the Peking duck-a duck leg and thigh, crispy skin and tender flesh, with a half-dozen pillow-soft steamed buns and a ramekin of sesame Hoisin sauce, all served in an oversized bamboo steamer (clearly for presentation only). This is also available in the bar, and would make for killer bar food.\\n\\nI selected the lamb chops for my main; she went with the alder smoked duck. I would say it was a toss-up on which was better. The lamb chops were a pair of three-bone chops served whole. They could not have been cooked more correctly, perfect pink centers. Her duck was also just right; the chef clearly has the crisp-skin-and-moist-meat trick down, a feat many restaurants fail to achieve.\\n\\nAs good as the meats were, the sides were just so-so, mainly acting to deliver an obligatory green and starch but not adding any real sizzle to the plate. I would have preferred good √• l√° carte veg instead of the ones served with the proteins.\\n\\nWe were stuffed. The meat portions were huge, and we easily could have taken some home. We skipped dessert and staggered back to our hotel after this huge meal.\\n\\nI tried a glass of a Rioja that just didn't hit the mark for me. It was replaced with a glass of Malbec that worked much better, no charge. Herself tried a local Riesling; a mistake, as usual-it seems only German Rieslings have the right perfume to meet her demands, but no fault of the wine.\\n\\nWould we go back? Maybe. This is an excellent example of a restaurant traditionally visited (for dinner, anyway) for anniversary and expense account dinners. The food is excellent but in no way challenging. If you want a big occasion dinner where the food needs to be spot-on but not the focus of attention, more of a compliment to the rest of the evening, this is the place for you.

But I walked in on a Sunday morning and the first thing I noticed was how nice the place looked. And they were playing Brazilian chill music too. There was a small line leading to the two registers so I thought the food must be good. I ordered an \\"Allstone Sunrise\\" sandwich on Challah bread ($5) and a small mocha with soy milk ($3.30). They did not charge me extra for the soy milk; which I thought was cool because some places do. The mocha came first and tasted fine. The sandwich looked lame but it was excellent. They made the egg over easy and the yolk ran in with the melted cheese, special sauce, and avocado spread to make it a delicious, baconey, gooey mess and the challah bread sucked it all in. Refuge Cafe has lots of bread options and I think I'll try the multigrain next time because the challah was maybe a little too soft for all that gooey goodness and I think cheddar would work better than swiss.. \\n\\nMost places in the area make their breakfast sandwiches with over hard eggs and they don't offer the same high quality ingredients so I think the Refuge Cafe can differentiate its breakfast options that way -- I'm looking forward to seeing what they do for lunch or dinner. \\n\\nMinor quips: their napkin containers were all empty and they made you walk all the way to the counter to tear a piece from their brown paper towel roll. Also, I thought the service could be better and friendlier -- there is a definite hipstier-than-thou air at the cafe.

The five space balls ($5 app) were dripping in oil and sitting on a bed of soggy leaves. Our pizzas were bland and the crust was dry and hard, with a lot of char on the bottom. Not worth $12 each. \\n\\nThe most annoying part is that now we have an unused Groupon, and we are obligated to return to Flying Saucer and use it.

I always write down our order prior to pushing the button as I have picky kids and I've found it makes it easier to get it right the first time. There was a brief wait to order, which was no big deal as it was a bit busy and having worked food service I get that. When they took the order they only repeated back half of it and left dead air after I completed my order.  When our food arrived, in an expeditious manner, it looked fresh and smelled great.  Upon inspection, only 3 of the 5 meals was correct.  Pushed the button and they sent over the car hop.  She was abrasive, argumentative, and made it obvious she didn't feel like helping and like we were trying to get something free.  She took the new order and receipt and disappeared.  After just over 15 minutes, once our tots and fries were cold and my two youngest were begging for dessert, our burgers arrived and only 2 of the 3 were right.  They loaded so much mustard on my wife's burger that it was oozing out the side and we had enough to fill a standard PL2 cup with it.  It was almost inedible.  The car hop disappeared so fast I didn't have the opportunity to ask for my receipt back.\\n\\nThis brings us to dessert.  As it was after 8 pm and the shakes were half price we decided to sugar up the kids before our long drive home to Maine.  We ordered our shakes and when the carhop brought them to us I asked her for my previous receipt as well.  She told me she had thrown it away and made it seem like such a hassle to get a reprint.  4 of the 5 shakes were spot on and delicious.  However my 7 year old daughter wanted Chocolate Cream Pie and ended up with Chocolate Coconut Cream Pie.  Thankfully my wife had tasted it first and we discovered the error.  My daughter can't have coconut as it makes her quite sick.  When I brought it to the attention of the car hop she told us that's just how they make it.  When I explained that my daughter is allergic and it could've resulted in an emergency room visit or worse, she just stood there rolling her eyes.  I asked her if they could make it without the coconut and was told they can't do that.  I also asked her to let her manager know that they should put a note on the menu that their  Chocolate Cream Pie shake contains coconut so that other parents might avoid any trouble in the future.\\n\\nBottom line, I WOULD NOT recommend this location, they are a disgrace to the Sonic franchise.

The vermicelli  is served with shredded fresh veggies and a super light \\"dressing\\" that was a nice blend of sweet and savory.

Looking through their yelp photos, you can't help but imagine in your head what choices you're going to have to make when you're actually in the cafe.\\n\\nWe found this Cafe as we walked through an alleyway and once we saw the store sign, we were hoping that since it was a Monday afternoon, there wouldn't be that much people there. Boy, were we wrong! The line was already reaching the ends of the restaurant wall and doubling back around & the tables and counters were already filled with people already enjoying their food. We quickly got in line and within 15 minutes or so, we were at the front to place our order.\\n\\nThere were multiple people behind the counter helping place orders using their hand held order machines, after they read you back your order, you swipe your card with them and then a different person at the cash register asks you to sign your receipt after it prints and then hands you your receipt. You then will scurry off to find a table or place at the counters lining the walls to sit at & when your order is ready, your name will be called to pick it up.\\n\\nWe ordered:\\n1) Croissant (heated up): nice buttery croissant that was flakey when you pushed your fork into it\\n2) Old Fashion Sour Dough Coffee Cake: delicious cake with cinnamon swirls throughout the cake, coffee cake toppings have a nice semi-sweetness that compliments the cake and the frosted lines to the back of the cake slice even has a frosted sugar icing on it.\\n3) pb&j - you can't go wrong with this one! the jam seems to be homemade as it's not your buy in the supermarket type of jam where it runs all gooey liquid all over the place. instead, this jam has a nice thick consistency where it clumps together like a paste with the seeds still there; quite fragrant and flavorful. Combined together, not too thick with the PB and the paste of the Jam which goes well together to not give you that you just want to keep lapping your tongue in your mouth kind of feel.\\n4) Sweet potato, Apple, Blue cheese, kale, honey whole wheat sandwich (Minus walnut pesto substituted with almonds) - actually pretty good, however, the sweet potato got a bit too dry towards the end. Since the sandwich comes in a pretty decent size, can probably share this.\\n5) Breakfast egg sandwich, ham & cheddar - just ok.. the egg comes in a thick rectangular shape and the ham is slightly grilled a bit to give it a nice flavor; can be pretty filling after only being halfway done with the sandwich.\\n6) Caramel Cappuccino - this was a fail for me since I didn't enjoy this coffee at all. It was way too bitter at the bottom even I stirred it up a couple of times.   \\n\\nOverall, certain foods were scrumptious with a few hit and misses. I still would recommend others to try it though if you're around the area.\\n\\nTIPS:\\n1) Free WIFI at the Bakery/Cafe\\n2) Unisex restrooms access requires a code that's printed on your receipt. Tap the keypad entry machine on top of the door handle, when it lights up, enter your code and green is \\"Access Granted,\\" while red is \\"DENIED.\\"\\n3) To go menus located on the back shelves where the books are around the main entrance door area/where the line walks past."},{"name":"Kekes Breakfast Cafe","address":"1005 Spring Villas Point","city":"Winter Springs","stars":"3.5","text":"Kekes is a stones throw away from my office, no literally, a stones throw away.

We tried the avocado \\"ice cream,\\" which was surprisingly yummy, as well as the cardamom pistachio, and the bananas foster.  All had great, genuine ice cream texture (none of those irritating icicles faux-ice creams usually have).  The bananas foster had lovely chunks of real banana in it, though the chocolate jimmies I got on top were a little overpowering in flavor.. Not sure what they're made of, they were vegan as well.  The ice cream at FoMu (or at least the three flavors we tried) does have a strong coconut flavor from the coconut milk, so it's more like bananas foster & coconut, avocado & coconut, and so on..   So if you don't enjoy the flavor of coconut, it might not be for you.

We were going to wait on him to order, but another customer advised us that everything is cooked to order and takes a while, so we'd be wise to go ahead. \\nThe atmosphere of the restaurant is a little divey, especially the location, but don't be put off by that. Every single thing the three of us ordered was good!\\nI got the curry chicken with fried plantains and curry potatoes. The chicken was so good and intensely flavorful. The plantains had a great sweet flavor that served as a good contrast (I liked dipping them in the curry), and the curry potatoes... were curry potatoes. Of course they're good. \\nHubby got the jerked chicken with rice and beans and cabbage and okra. The chicken had the most intense smokey flavor I've ever encountered - a bit much for my tastes, but the boys loved it. The sides were good as well. \\nOur friend ordered the jerked pork pizza (yes, pizza), which was also a hit. The pork had the same strong smoke flavor as the chicken, but I liked it better on the pizza where it wasn't so overpowering.\\nHubby also tried the ginger beer, which is the best ginger beer I've ever had - sweet and fruity! I couldn't stop stealing swigs. Our friend also got an absolutely delicious smoothie. \\nAlso - don't be fooled by the location and appearance of this place - I expected my food to be piled unceremoniously on cheap plates. Instead, the presentation of our food was beautiful, like at a much more upscale establishment. Everything was garnished with cucumbers, artfully arranged, etc. \\nMy only real gripe is the bathroom situation. The place is covered in unfriendly signs saying that the restrooms are for customers only, and to my surprise they didn't stop there. You actually need to get a key from the employees to go in! I haven't seen a bathroom locked up this way since the guest facilities at nursing homes. Since there only seemed to be two employees who frequently disappeared into the back, this could get awkward very quickly.\\nThe only other bummer is there really aren't any appetizers, which is a shame since the foods really DOES take quite a while to make. Some of the things under \\"snacks\\" might do, and there's a variety of bagged chips to buy at the front counter, but we always make it a point to order an appetizer when we get ethnic food and were disappointed we couldn't this time. \\nBottom line, EAT HERE. It is so good. The food is worth the little bit of extra time.

The breadsticks and oily mash that you dip them into were unappealing. We got a mozzarella sampler ($30. You read that right--$30) but the mozzarella was on par with what you'd buy at the grocery store, and I know that there are cheeses of better quality to be had for much less. For the entree, we each got a one person pizza (again, around $30 EACH) which--once more--could have been beaten taste-wise by something frozen. They were thin crust, but the crust was not good at all, tasteless and rice-y.

The menu seemed pretty traditional and nothing really stuck out to me; luckily they offer a menu special daily so I decided to order from there. \\n\\nFor the appetizer I ordered the smoke salmon dip, which was served cold, more like a salad (totally wasn't expecting that).  The flavor was great, I just would have preferred it more like a warm dip not necessarily a salad.  I honestly think they should indicate that on the menu. The swordfish was grilled with couscous & topped with fried shrimp and a butter sauce. Sounds delicious right? Well unfortunately the dish was a fail, the swordfish wasn't seasoned (thankfully the sauce saved it), I was expecting at least a few pieces of large shrimp; however the shrimp were small.  Honestly the couscous was the best thing on the plate but one would think for $24, I could eat more than couscous!

There is a parking lot, registers actually have conveyor belts, the lighting is more adequate and it is a very clean location. I'm not sure this location is trying to attract traffic from South St more than its Washington Street and Hyde Park Ave neighbors, thus I'm not very interested in comparing it much to a decent store a few minutes away.\\n\\nReview for people who don't frequent Harvest:\\n\\nAs I live on Hyde Park and get exhausted from comments about my surrounding area by folks closer to Centre Street, I -do- have to say that it is very much appreciated to have a store with actual groceries, and not junk food from corner stores, within walking distance. Although it is not particularly walker friendly because of the lack of crosswalks at the moment, I cannot blame the store for that at all. What is awkward, however, is the stone block wall that requires you to reach the store level (rather than just stairs) just to enter, though I remember seeing that prior to the Harvest sign on the building.\\n\\nHarvest isn't the cheapest. But hey, if you don't feel like taking the bus to the American Legion grocery stores, or if you don't feel like taking to the Orange Line to Stop and Shop, or you don't feel like taking the #39 and other buses just to access a grocery-like store, then Harvest is in a good place for people on \\"this side of the tracks\\" (what a dumb phrase). \\n\\nThey brought two of their better cashiers, if you ask me. More gelato flavors, more coolers for beverages, and we have ourselves a nice place to head off to for items, etc. The one difference that makes this location stand out is its salad bar. It is -by far- more appealing at all times of the day, rather than looking ratched and ran through by mine and yours. \\n\\nThe lack of many breads is pretty lame (but I support When Pigs Fly for bread anyway), and they have a section unopened that I'm sure will be their wine/beer area. I love popping in for soup/salad, and now that they finally have some seafood choices, I have absolutely no reason to ever return to the one on South St. I finally have a Harvest in my area. Haven't seen loiterers, and mommy strollers don't pollute the sidewalks (but that's a bigger discussion on walking accessibility).

And I also don't like that I have to get the salad with the dinner. I'm guessing it increases the cost of the dinner with having a salad, and I end up giving away the salad because I don't like salad.

The soft sofas and comfy red leather chairs beg to be sat it in, and my favorites, the high back chesterfield bar stools surrounding the long bar had me walking straight towards them to sit down.  They even have some that seat two if you are in the mood for being cozy. I sat alone for a while at the bar waiting for my friend and just took it all in.  I ordered one of my favorite white wines; a St. Supery Sauvignon Blanc and enjoyed the sharp citrus tang of the summer wine.     \\n\\nMy friend arrived and started with a fantastic burst of summer Watermelon Margarita while I continued to enjoy my St. Supery.  For bites we decided on Powder Point Oysters Rockefeller and the Oak Board.\\n\\nI haven't had Oysters Rockefeller in years and these were fabulous tastes of creaminess with a hint of liquorice and garlic spinach and not enough with only three.  Great for tasting but for sharing as an appetizer we should have ordered two portions.\\n\\nThe Oak Board was just overflowing with goodness.  As we made our way through the cheeses and meats we had to order more and more bread, which our server was only happy to oblige.  I much preferred the crusty bread than the crispbread it came with.\\n\\nWe were having so much fun, we decided to order a bottle of the St. Supery to share and so we could continue our people watching evening.  What a fun evening overall.  Perhaps we should have had more food and less wine but in the end I had a blast of an evening in this rebirth of the Oak Bar.\\n\\nI am talking some friends into going back to the Oak Long Bar for drinks and perhaps dinner this time and I cannot wait.

We had reservations at 7pm on a Friday and there were around 12 of us. I honestly was looking forward to the night for the whole week prior, I had never been there and I was pretty pumped to try it out.. \\n\\nThe food: good, mostly everyone in our group seemed pleased with their dinner. The portions were plentiful and the guacamole was delicious. However, the queso, was unlike any queso I've ever had, and not in a good way. It was extremely stringy (it reminded me of mozzarella) and it congealed ridiculously fast.\\n\\nThe drinks: decent, but extremely overpriced. There was no discernible difference between their $9 signature margarita and their $7.50 house margarita, which were served in tiny versions of pilsner glasses. They do carry Racer 5 IPA, which I became a fan of that night. With the exception of a few, the majority of the group seemed generally displeased with the taste of their drinks. \\n\\nIf I was basing my review on just food and drinks, I would score this place 2 stars, I have had much better but I've had much worse. In a word, decent.\\n\\nThe service: my main cause of frustration and overall displeasure. We had a large group and I've worked as waiter/bartender so I understand that big groups are a bit more work and can take a bit longer to service, I get it. The service was adequate in the beginning, the only positive was that the food and drinks came fairly quickly. At the beginning of the night, we asked for separate checks; our waiter informed us that he could not do seperate checks but he could accept multiple payments, we figured fine, we'll just divide it up when the bill comes. The bill arrives and we each go through the bill and check the items we had and included tax and tip. When we calculated our total, we were short of our bill total. So we reviewed the bill a bit closer and found several items that we had never ordered and other items that were listed under different names. When we asked the waiter for clarification he was very rude and snappy and quick to blame us for not being able to remember what we had, even though he rang up the items differently than they were listed in the menu (for example, someone ordered a mexican martini but he rang up a signature margarita because they were the same price he said). The debacle lasted over an hour as we tried to get the bill straight with no assistance from the manager and arguing with the waiter. After viewing our frustration and ignoring us for an hour the manager finally shows up and after debating with him for several minutes, he helps to resolve the issue by ringing up separate checks. If the manager ever did apologize to anyone, I did not hear it.\\n\\nWe were not looking for any sort of discount or trying to avoid paying for what we ordered. We just didn't want to be overcharged.\\n\\nThe attitude of our wait staff, manager included, was absolutely ridiculous and offensive. Having worked in the customer service industry, it blows my mind that they allowed this issue to turn into an over-an-hour long fiasco. They ruined my friend's birthday dinner, which was hands down the most upsetting part of the evening.\\n\\n I will never return and I definitely recommend that you find some other place to spend your time and money."},{"name":"JJ's Fresh From Scratch","address":"2950 Curry Ford Rd","city":"Orlando","stars":"4.5","text":"Forgot what it was called, but the Mediterranean-themed bowl with a bit of hot sauce on the side was amazing.

I'm so happy this is the place we went with! We rented the outside sun room for a deposit which was later applied to our bill. My parents and I went to the restaurant to sample menu items and pick what we would want to serve, then my in-laws and I did the same thing, and then we were there for the actual event. Each encounter was pleasant and delicious. \\n\\nPlanning the Event/Staff: The staff was friendly and helpful during every interaction. The owner, Erika, was available when we needed her and kept in good contact, providing us reasonable deadlines for planning purposes. Before our first visit, we scheduled some time to talk to the owner and she joined us for a discussion throughout our meal, first to get a handle on our event then checking in on what we thought about the food. Erika  cooks all of her own desserts from scratch so she gave us pricing on cooking specific pies for our party or just offering it by the slice. They offered to set up buffet tables for appetizers and desserts along with a sit down dinner. With 30 people it was a little cramped so I wouldn't recommend much more than that (perhaps with different table arrangement), but it was still comfortable. My mother has a severe shellfish allergy and this was printed in huge bold lettering on the event sheet so the kitchen wouldn't miss it, there were no issues. \\n\\nThe Food: Was great.. \\n\\nI abso-freaking-lutely loved their Flatbread with prosciutto, brie, fig jelly and spring mix. \\n\\nThe Fettuccini with Pesto Infused Vegetables was my favorite entree. Second fave goes to Wienerschnitzel (Erika is German and this dish is on point). I don't know what she did to the crust of the Key Lime Pie, but that came out amazingly, so did the Strawberry Rhubarb pie as well. The Lobster Swiss and Bacon dip with fried tortilla wedges came highly recommended by the staff and was pretty good, but it wasn't what I heard murmurs over. \\n\\nThe Atmosphere: The location is off of the main strip of park ave, behind some of the boutiques in the \\"hidden garden\\" and you definitely feel the hidden vibe. The sun room is significantly more romantic and appealing than the inside IMHO, I would not have had my rehearsal dinner there if it involved the booths on the inside. When I had to walk to the restroom, I felt a little like I was in a different restaurant (thankfully the food is the same) \\n\\nFor Smokers: Park avenue in general is not very friendly to smokers, so you're not technically allowed to smoke in the \\"hidden garden\\" but there was an ally right outside the sun room where my friends sneaked off to when they weren't blatantly disregarding that rule.  \\n\\nOverall, the staff was accommodating, the food was filling and savory, and the atmosphere in the sun room is romantic and cheerful."},{"name":"Tibby's New Orleans Kitchen","address":"2203 Aloma Ave","city":"Winter Park","stars":"4.5","text":"The first time I went to Tibby's I was blown away. Since then I've been back multiple times and have tried a variety of their food.\\n\\nLet me start by saying the service I've received here is five star. I recommend sitting at the bar or at one of the high tops in the bar area. All bartenders full of personality and are always willing to make a recommendation. They truly help make the experience. \\n\\nThe fried pickles (just crispy enough, never soggy, served with a great dipping sauce) or BBQ shrimp (tons of delicious garlic flavor) are a great way to start. For entrees, I'm a huge fan of the crawfish √©touff√©e and the crawfish pie and gumbo . Always plenty of seafood. Some restaurants leave you digging for your shrimp or crawfish, not Tibby's.\\nGuests that have gone with me have not had great luck with their traditional pork chops but if they have the fried pork chop on special- it's a must.\\n\\nThe coffee and  Benighets are a must for those who love sweets and taste exactly like the delicious treats from the famous Cafe Du Monde in New Orleans.\\n\\nI definitely recommend the hurricane or one of the draft Abita beers (always served in a frozen chalice- great twist). I haven't heard great reviews on their other specialty beverages - too sweet and not enough alcohol. However, the hurricanes are the best I've been able to find in central Florida. \\n\\nI typically grab takeout on the weekends and they are usually really busy but always super accommodating both for groups and for individuals just looking to grab a seat at the bar."},{"name":"Jalapeno Charlie's","address":"218 Peachtree St NW","city":"Atlanta","stars":"2","text":"I was at an event last weekend in Atlanta and we decided to stop in here.

This is the first Mexican restaurant that I've been to that actually charges for chips and I'm really surprised that they do.  Perhaps it's an Atlanta thing.  This was my first time in the South, after all (beyond a week long excursion to Walt Disney World, which doesn't count as visiting the South in my opinion).\\n\\nThe food wasn't very good when it finally did arrive.

In fact, don't expect this to a $1.50 hot dog like you get at Costco.

I've eaten there three times this week, and my mom and brother have eaten there twice in three days. \\n\\nThe menu has a lot of choices, and everything I have ever seen come out of the kitchen looks incredible. Though it's difficult to tell exactly what you're getting by the descriptions on the menu, the waiters speak excellent English and can help you find whatever you like. They also have no problem customizing a dish (I always ask for no rice or vermicelli, and they replace this with lettuce and veggies at no extra charge). I usually get the Bun Tom Nuong with grilled shrimp, and it's amazing every time. The flavor of all their meats is incredible and cannot be recreated at home; everything is charcoal-smoked/grilled, and it's perfectly complemented by the delicious fish sauce served on the side. \\n\\nI recommend that everyone try what Com is most well-known for: the \\"Com Special\\", or fragrant rice dish, that comes with rice, an egg, a shrimp-crab cake, and your choice of meat.

Even though I was in her line of sight (and trying to politely signal for a refill, my check, etc.), my waitress was much more interested in talking with her co-workers than she was in actually doing her job.

I love the art museum, and I can forgive the fact that they're renovating so there's only one exhibit right now. But the service I got there recently warranted an update. \\n\\nOn the way out we stopped in the gift shop and I bought a pen. When the incredibly smoking hot gorgeous girl in the tight, short mini skirt rang me out, she didn't put my pen in the bag. Now, I'm willing to give them a pass on this because it could be argued that I forgot to pick it up while I stood there gripping the counter to try not to fall over from my lightheaded state induced by the somewhat hypnotic state of drooling at her. It's what happens after this that gets me. \\n\\nRight after leaving there, my girlfriend called them about it. While I did not hear the conversation, she said the person on the phone stressed it was very unusual and seemed to not believe her, or so she felt. I had to wait a couple days to go back because it was closed on Memorial Day. When I did get back to pick it up, there was no one in the gift shop. It was deserted. \\n\\nI waited there for several minutes. I was in a hurry, trying to get to COSI before it was too late to be worthwhile since they were closing in a couple hours. I finally went over to the information and desk and there was an old woman taking a nap. I woke her up and told her about the pen. Before I could even finish the sentence, she told me to go to the gift shop. I told her there was no one there and she said, \\"well there will be soon.\\" She had a scowl on her face and sounded very annoyed with me. She closed her eyes again so I said \\"great, thanks\\" and went back to waiting in the gift shop. There were a few people shopping in there so I figured the clerk had to come back soon. I was wrong. \\n\\nI waited for several more minutes. This is cutting into precious little time we had to enjoy COSI with my son so I couldn't keep waiting. I finally went to the food cart in the lobby that serves as the restaurant during renovation. I asked the chef there to call somebody and he did help me. He made a couple phone calls and couldn't get a hold of anyone so he went outside and looked for the manager. He was a big help. Him I appreciated. Well he went out and found the manager and it was the steamy goddess from the other day. \\n\\nSo the beautiful Amy Smart look alike grabbed me a pen and all was good. But the amount of time I wasted in getting it, and the abomination of customer service was so bad, I felt embarrassed for them. \\n\\nAs a side note, I have to talk about that gorgeous gift shop manager. I loved the way she was dressed. That mini skirt was super tight and barely covered anything, which was only made better by the fact that she was sitting. However, I'm not sure it was proper dress for a museum. It doesn't bother me, but I could see some conservative families not approving of that. In my opinion, it just didn't look professional. \\n\\nI hope she never changes the way she dresses because she was hot. When I say she was hot, I mean it stopped me in my tracks and I was awe struck enough that it earned me a glaring stink eye look from my girlfriend.

We had a little snack before heading over. It was a Tuesday night and we were seated in 20 minutes instead of the 45 to an hour we were advised on so that was a welcome surprise. Our seats were at the bar so we could observe as the oysters were shucked. Looking over the selection of oysters, we liked how each selection not only listed their origin, but a description of their size, degree of saltiness, and finish. There was a lot to choose from! We went with Island Creek, Katama Bay, Pemaquid, Winter Point, Kumamoto, and Kushi so we could try both Atlantic and Pacific oysters. We also decided to try a hot buttered lobster roll. Did I mention we were hungry? To our surprise, the lobster roll was served up first (aren't oysters usually served first?) but we didn't fuss and just went with it. True to other reviewers descriptions, this roll had a very generous portion of lobster meat piled on the hot, buttered roll with a side of crispy french fries. It was delicious! Our oysters came up just as we finished the lobster roll so we decided to set aside the fries and start working on the oysters. The oysters were sequenced in the same order of our selections starting clockwise on the outer circle and then counterclockwise on the inner circle. Between the two of us, we had eleven oysters each and we were not disappointed! As we consumed each variety, we tried to see if our palates were in line with each oyster's finish, (i.e., fruity, brown butter, citrus, sweet, honeydew, cucumber). That was fun. The cucumber finish of the Kushi was dead on while others we had to think over. Saving the fries for last turned out to be a good move - a rich, salty counterpoint to the oysters we just finished.\\n\\nNeptune struck us as more of a locals hangout. Very cozy (read: small) like a lot of spaces in the North End but manageable. The noise level is a little high but we were fine with it. Some might balk at a $27 lobster roll plate but for the price, you're getting a very generous portion of lobster with that so I wouldn't expect a McD's price. And of course, the oysters were superb!

Efrain's is beyond over-rated, like China Gourmet, in my opinion, and I believe it's for many of the same reasons. The food is relatively inexpensive, the portion sizes are generous *for some dishes*, and the place is a hole in the wall. With not very good service. All you have to do is tack on the label \\"authentic\\" and you've got a hit. People can talk themselves into a lot. I guess folks really like to feel they're \\"in the know\\"; cheap, arguably lots of food, hole in the wall, \\"authentic\\".

He was one of the cheapest human beings I have ever met. He bought extravagantly expensive cheeses at Whole Foods, but hated \\"fancy\\" restaurants (and in my opinion, good food and any real enjoyment of life, but I digress). Nor surprisingly, he loved China Gourmet. Having grown up in Denver, which as a larger city just has a better choice of restaurants, particularly Mexican, I was greatly looking forward to finally finding a good Mexican joint in Boulder. Yuck. Cheesy, runny, swimming in sauce and runny beans, soggy rellenos (I am admittedly in the crispy rellenos camp, but these were runny even for soft-style rellenos) - actually small portions, in my opinion, with everything coming a la carte and plain (i.e., having to pay extra even for lettuce, etc.) Now, I like what I call \\"gooey American style Mexican\\" very well, thank you, even as I like truly authentic Mexican, without a speck of cheese near it, but this was just cheesy and runny (I hate runny beans) beyond the point of grossness. I will say, I was not eating meat when I ate there, so I can't speak to those specific ingredients, but the overall quality of the food was just bad. Service was bad. The place was so loud you couldn't enjoy a conversation. I'm not really a drinker, so tolerating bad food for cheap margs is not of interest to me.

If that isn't enough it was open bar until that end of the 3rd quarter.  \\n\\nFor their first time doing this they handled it quite perfectly. Enough people on staff, attentive with the drinks during open bar. Impeccable timing during the game. \\n\\nAtmosphere is NOLA and celebrates the history, the ups and downs of New Orleans and the people that call it home. The decor is funky much like the owners other Restaurant Tijuana Flats. \\n\\nThe first quarter the appetizers were onion rings and fried pickles. The group loved both. For me the fried pickles were a little too salty. I think the batter had salt plus the salt of the pickle. Everyone else loved them though.\\n\\nThis is where I had the thought that perhaps this isn't a place to go if you are restricting you salt intake or if you happen to enjoy salt but just not as much as some.\\n\\nThe second quarter Appetizers were chicken wings and a breaded fried cheese with adorned in a red sauce. Both were good. I liked the spicy Cajun spice on the wings. A friend complained they were not saucy enough but I liked that they weren't so messy. The fried cheese plate was my brothers favorite. It tastier than your average fried mozzarella stick.\\n\\nFor the main Entree I ordered the Seafood Gumbo and my husband had the Andouille Sausage Jambalaya. My was a hot bowl of gumbo with oysters, andouille sausage and shrimp with okra, seasoning, veggies and rice. It was very flavorful, nice body to the soup. I tried my husbands Jambalaya and loved it. The Andouille sausage was a star and it was spiced perfectly. \\n\\nThe beignets were soft plump little pillows that rounded out the meal well. Just don't inhale the powdered sugar. \\n\\nThey had a raffle and gave away some cool prices. The atmosphere was fun and inviting and those that choose to spend their Super Bowl there were very nice fun people. \\n\\nWe had a great time.

Located in a crowded strip shopping center, it's very popular. The staff are friendly and it's a cafeteria line kind of operation with your first stop at the grill where the dogs are cooking on a real charcoal fire. If you order the crinkle cut fries or the onion rings, they start cooking those when you order your dogs. They have lots of toppings available. I opted for the house hot sauce, mustard and onions on one dog and the same with chili on the other. I also ordered fries and a lemonade. The total bill came to over $12. As has been mentioned earlier, the fries are served in a styrofoam container and they punch holes in the top so that the steam can escape and the fries can stay hot and crispier longer... a smart and nice touch. Although the fries are of the frozen variety, they were nicely prepared and seasoned. By the way, the onion rings looked amazing. I'll order those next time. The lemonade was very good although next time I'll ask for light on the ice. Now to the dogs. In a word, they were good, not great but good. It really comes down to a matter of taste. I like my hot dogs to have a pop to them when I bite in and these did. The dogs themselves were tasty and obviously, high quality. I like a soft steamed bun and I like the bun-to-dog ratio to be well balanced. These buns were too big and not steamed enough so the ratio was off and there was too much bread. As for the toppings, I liked the house hot sauce although it was just as sweet as it was hot. The mustard and onions were good accompaniments. The chili, while a good hot dog chili consistency, was bland and pretty tasteless. It needed a touch more seasoning. So, all-in-all, not a bad experience at all but not the hot dog nirvana that I had hoped for. It's probably a good thing because this is not close to my home or work so if it had been really good, I'd have been driving about 15 miles out of my way at least once a week at a minimum.

It looks like the process for the Reggie Deluxe is 1) hand-tear a biscuit in half, 2) put a piece of fried chicken on the heel, 3) add a couple of slices of bacon, 4) ladle a generous amount of sausage gravy all over, 5) place a slice of cheese on the gravy and melt on a rack of what looks like an open oven, 6) top with a fried egg from a small cast-iron skillet, and 7) finish with the crown.\\n\\nMy order came out pretty quickly and even surprised me a little since I was getting into a hypnotic state watching the cooks do their thing, not just with the Reggie orders, but also hash, blueberry pancakes, and frying the chicken. The side of Cajun fries was huge for little old me, particularly with the Reggie Deluxe, so I decided upfront that I shouldn't feel obligated to finish all of them. Good thing I stuck with my resolve: I used the most heavily seasoned fries to transport the excess sausage gravy to my mouth, and once I'd finished with Reggie and exhausted the gravy, I only ate the fries that were of the thinner, and therefore crispier, variety.\\n\\nIt was a lovely, savory, hearty breakfast, after which I probably could have used a moist towelette.

Furthermore, I find myself perpetually baulking at people who leave bad reviews on places that so many seem to love; these people often say: \\"I don't know what all the hype is about,\\" \\"these people don't know good food,\\" or \\"I just don't get it.\\" WELL people I typer here before you today: I DON'T KNOW WHAT ALL THE HYPE IS ABOUT. \\n\\nThe Food: \\n\\nReggie Deluxe-\\nThe biscuit itself looked amazing. It looked like the kind of thing you'd see on the Travel Channel or Food Network. But and I do say \\"but,\\" the biscuit lacked on the flavor side and didn't even live up on the expectations on the preparation side. The egg was not runny (a biscuit like that \\"must\\" have a runny egg), the gravy lacked any seasonings, and the biscuit itself seemed to be hours if not days old. I mean really this is supposed to be a biscuit place? Shouldn't the biscuits be this places claim to fame? Well, the biscuit was hard, cold, and a bit chewy. If you want to be a biscuit place, keep them coming out the oven all morning so the biscuit is as fresh as the overcooked egg that you guys pair on the Reggie Deluxe. The fried chicken was tasteless (lack of seasonings and cold- a trip to the south for chefs and Pine State management is needed), you get the sense that they mass produced these fried chicken patties because they don't taste cooked to order or made with love and care. My girlfriend got steak and said that was more flavorful, so I suggest you get the Steak instead of Ham when ordering the Reggie Deluxe. \\n\\nHashups-\\nThe Hashups were actually the best thing I had at Pine State Biscuits. Its hash browns, you do the math folks: not hard to mess up. The kicker is, their not just regular hash browns; their flattened out, mixed with either steak or ham, and topped with a cheese based sauce. The only problems with this dish were: we choose ham instead of steak ( the ham had no taste) and the cheese sauce was salty and I mean SALTY. It was so salty that we couldn't finish it! \\n\\nThe establishment- \\nIt's a small place on the corner.

Ladled on top is that incredible red sauce - perfectly smooth and rich and just the right amount of heat.  I'm sure I could eat it on just about anything. \\n\\nIf you're not full from your delicious meal, try the sopapillas - heavenly pillows of fried dough rolled in cinnamon and sugar topped with honey.

The bone marrow dish was perfectly balanced with the crispy toast, salty microgreens (slightly too salty in my opinion but just ever so slightly), the buttery-rich bone marrow and the sweet caramalized onions. It's always fun to put the food together into one orgasmic bite. \\n\\nPork Chop with corn skillet/bread  (8/10) \\nIt was a first to be asked how we wanted our pork cooked! They reassured us that their pork was of the highest quality and you can safely eat it undercooked. We were a little hesitant but ordered a medium pork chop which ended up being soft and tender! I actually rarely order pork chop because it is always dry as a bone but this was a first. The reason why this pork chop dish wasn't amazing was because of the weird tasting corn skillet bread/pancake thing.

(And there's a lot of options.) You will likely have to wait for it, but it's well worth it. Better than Kerby Lane (though that's also worth a stop), Mag Mud is a perfectly ridiculous Austin dish that could serve as a whole meal. The tropical turkey tacos are amazing. I miss them and have tried to imitate them to no success. Their black bean dinner is phenomenal, and tastes almost healthy. Their pancakes also rival Kerby's... and are huge. I will also warn you that their breakfast tacos are about twice the size of the norm... but so so delicious. Just get one or else you will end up gorging yourself on tea. Their hibiscus mint tea (an Austin thing as well) is excellent, though they also have a pretty good wine and very good beer list.

The beef patty itself was amazing... thick and the most beautiful medium-rare juicy red. Top that with FRIED OYSTERS, cheese and pickled relish... Juicy flavor explosion. The fries were perfect as well (fries are one of my big weaknesses as well). You MUST get this.

It's a neighborhood pizza joint that has remained popular among locals all these years because of its good food, friendly service, and reasonable value.\\n\\nThis is both a casual Greek and Italian eatery where you can order gyros and moussaka or pizza and pasta.  On the Greek side, apps include \\"Athens potatoes,\\" which are basically lightly fried chunks of potato, pita bread with cheese and/or hummus, fasolada (Greek bean soup), Greek lentil soup, and Greek salads.  Entrees include the aforementioned moussaka (eggplant dish with bechamel sauce) and pastitsio (ground beef dish with bechamel sauce).  If you're looking for something lighter, they also have a variety of pita wraps.\\n\\nYou can build your own pizza or choose from one of Athens' specialty pizzas.  Their specialty pizzas have a definite Greek spin, using ingredients such as Kalamata olives, gyro meat, and feta cheese.  I'm a fan of the \\"Athens Special,\\" which consists of feta, ground beef, sausage, pepperoni, mushrooms, onions, and green peppers.\\n\\nThe pizzas are deep-dish, thick-crust style.  The toppings are generally fresh.  I like how the veggie toppings are more on the raw side than cooked.  While there's nothing too fancy about it, I find the pizza here to be soft and satisfying overall.  The pizzas come in four sizes: 6-inch, 10-inch, 14-inch, and 16-inch.  The 6-inch is like a personal pan pizza.  The 10-inch is typically good enough for two people.\\n\\nThe gyro meat is pretty tasty.  It's a combination of beef and lamb that has been flame-broiled on a spit.  No matter how you order it, on a pizza, in a wrap, or as a platter, it's good.  The strips of meat are tender and flavorful.\\n\\nThe restaurant itself is basic with small booths and tables.  There's usually ample seating inside.  While the parking lot is big, finding a space can be difficult on nights when an event is going on nearby.  You can pay for your meal at the register, which makes it easy for separating checks.\\n\\nAthens Pizza is located next to the strip mall with The Nest, Bhojanic, Community Q BBQ, and Pyng Ho Chinese Restaurant."},{"name":"Narcoossee's","address":"4401 Grand","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"Our meal was a bit hit and miss tonight - the hits were big and so were the misses.  However, I have to say I have never seen a chef so willing and eager to make things right.

It was the lobster tails that didn't work out for me, they were overcooked, so he offered me anything else on the menu.  I ordered the filet mignon and he oversaw its preparation to be sure it was perfect. The manager, too, was very conciliatory at the end of the meal.  So, yeah, the lobster didn't work out unfortunately - it was the main reason I went there - but the pork chop was out of this world and the side of mashed potatoes was great beyond all reasonable expectation.

If I had not been on the lookout, I would have easily missed the subtle sign out front. Inside, the mood is cozy, quaint and charming. Despite having such limited space (there must be only around ten tables), there is a little nook in front of a brick candle-lit fireplace suitable for a drink or even a light bite. Waitstaff was professional and attentive as soon as I walked in the door.\\n\\nThe best part of the Bondir menu is the fact that nearly all dishes are available as half-servings, allowing one to pick and choose multiple plates for tasting.\\n\\nWe started off with the house-made bread, a delicious 9-Grain, a rugged Cranberry Walnut-Spelt, and an intriguing bread titled, \\"The Sea\\", which contained whirls of nori seaweed and dried shrimp (hearty and oddly delicious). Having spent a fair amount of time baking my own bread, I would rate these choices very highly - they had excellent texture and the creativity in flavors and ingredients is commendable.\\n\\nFor appetizers we opted for the fantastic Mangalitsa 18 Month Prosciutto\\nRicotta, Tuscan Olive Oil, Greens, Olive Oil Toasted Bread Crumbs. The prosciutto was some of the best I've tasted in recent memory and the toppings were light and perfectly complimented the rich intensity of the thinly sliced meat. The Handmade Burrata Shaved Vegetable Salad, Pistachio Vinagarete, Aniseed Tuile was also excellent. The cheese was creamy and the salad was fresh and crisp. My favorite dish, by far, was the Aged Carnaroli Risotto Rhode Island Mussels and Periwinkles, Lardons, Spruce Shoot Froth. This dish was packed with flavor - perfectly cooked and flavors that complemented each other wonderfully. The Herbed Tagliatelle Confit Duck, Georgia Peas, Sorrel, Scamorza was also delicious. The Roasted Mallard Duck Mustard Greens, Black Lentils, White Flint Cornmeal Cake was incredibly flavorful - delicious and like all of the meat dishes, quite generously portioned for a \\"half\\" serving. My one complaint is that the duck breast was on the sinewy side. The other meat dishes (salmon and roast lamb) were fantastic.\\n\\nFor dessert we had the G√©noise, Vermouth-Infused Tangerine, Thyme-Buttermilk Ice Cream, Meringue Brul√©e served parfait style and Chocolate Panna Cotta Seville Orange and Rhubarb, Cocoa Nibs and Pistachio. Both were excellent. The tangerine dessert was creative and fun, and the panna cotta and a perfect texture.\\n\\nOverall, I would recommend this new restaurant. The food was creative and excellent, service was friendly and attentive and the ambience is wonderful. The menu changes daily so there will always be something fresh and new to try. A wonderful spot for a romantic meal or cozy meeting with friends&family."},{"name":"Crazy Buffet","address":"7038 W Colonial Dr","city":"Orlando","stars":"3.5","text":"They have a height policy for children, if your child is tall they pay as an adult.

I kept eating my bim bop but all I could fantasize was my hubby's duck steak dish tantalizing my taste buds.

Well, in my culture, family style means that they pretty much all come out at once and each dish is ample for sharing.  I wouldn't necessarily say that for the size of the dishes here.

All those things are FACTS. \\n\\nHowever, as a customer who visited twice a week to get coffee, and found out they also wanted to rent the space out for events...

Everyone who attended was respectful, someone even BOUGHT A PEICE OF FURNITURE from her that night. She was even rude to my dad who nicely asked her if she wanted him to stay after the party to help her clean up. We even hired a professional event coordinator who made sure things were okay and stayed after to make sure everything was put back in order and cleaned. We even gave Brittany 4 bottles of wine as a thank you. \\n\\nSadly, a lot of people told me the next day they had a blast, minus being treated poorly from Brittany.

EVERYTHING went wrong. Water glasses weren't filled, salad plates weren't cleared, lack of replaced silverware (which had to be requested) was literally the least of our concerns. Everything having to do with service fell apart- like a restaurant that had just opened. We assumed it was because of this poor nervous person being trained, but we came to realize that there were tons of servers and they were all running around like chickens with their heads cut off. After continuous mistakes, more than I can count, the manager started serving us, and the mistakes continued to roll in.  At a certain point he started to ignore us, it was almost like he knew he was the captain of the Titanic (Spoiler alert: IT SINKS)...and this is where it got comical. Every dish they served us was wrong, wrong side dishes, cooked exactly the opposite as requested; it was all just WRONG.\\n\\nMy problem is this: For a restaurant that expects to charge as much as they do ($25.99 for Blue Crab Legs that I ordered and was informed AFTER the fact they were out of, and $30 for a fillet mignon the size of MY fist- not my husband's) I expect better service. AND, even if this is their best service I expect care, attention to detail, and understanding.

Their dressing is amazing as is the salad! It's huge and could be a meal in itself.\\n\\nFor our main dishes hubby had the filet mignon, cooked medium with a loaded baked potato. His steak was cooked just how he ordered and said it was good. The butter sauce that it came with on the side didn't have any taste though. I ordered the steak burger and was in pure heaven! Juicy, perfectly cooked and oh so delicious. It came on toasted buttery French bread and a sauce similar to thousand island. I had the mac and cheese as a side which is always a good choice.\\n\\nWe were stuffed after our meals but took ordered the carrot cake to go.

My husband and I got the lobster rolls for appetizers very good but over priced because they were barely a big quantity for price. On that subject, we ordered the porchetta sandwich which was sour because of the mixed salad that was on top and soggy. My husband loved it. All besides the fact that since we split it the side portion of fries was pathetic. See pictures. Once we made a comment about the 3 fries on my plate the waiter and hostess (both names were never given to us) gave me a nasty snarl and said I'll get more. She repeatedly told us this was a normal portion. Once again pictures show my friends meal it was huge compared to ours. She came out with the appetizer portion which is $6...barely worth that. Our waiter brought them out actually had the nerve to look at us and say who ordered extra fries? AS we look over they are snarling, staring, talking about our request. They continued for about 10 mins to make it apparent. The hostess was incredibly rude. Which made us feel uncomfortable and was incredibly unwelcome. For the second time this was a strike out!

As good as it was, the carpaccio was even better, one of the best I have had. It was tangy, salty (in a good way), and seasoned just right, served with greens and cheese on top. The ravioli dish was very tasty, but small, so I ended up sharing my (large) portion of fish with my friend. Speaking of the fish.... it was incredible! It was grilled swordfish served in a buttery amazing sauce over a fantastic clam risotto and roasted tomatoes. This thing was good, one of the best fish dishes I have had.

A really great start to our meal.\\n\\nAs for the main meal, the different burgers are amazing.  The meat is incredibly tender and flavorful and there are a lot of creative combinations for toppings.  One guest at the table said it was the best burger she's ever had.  Besides various burgers, other people had the duck salad, the fried chicken sandwich, and the prime rib sammy (the special of the evening), all of which were excellent and well executed.\\n\\nMy only minor complaint was that the food didn't arrive at the same time for our party of 10.  I say it was a minor complaint because the restaurant was packed and the server made up for it with apologies and great service otherwise.\\n\\nThere are a lot of gastropubs to choose from in Columbus now and Kraft House No. 5 does not disappoint.

I can say, even the morning after, it was amazingly moist, flavorful and satisfyingly messy.   One friend also ordered the burger and concurred.

I'm not sure what a few people are talking about in other reviews about this place being a tad pricey. I have no problem whatsoever paying $6 and change for a 5 piece. I'm sure prepping the wing pops can be labor intensive and I'm not an idiot, I've been to heb before and the price of chicken wings isn't cheap.

The trailer is located behind Corner Bar next to another favorite of mine Potato A.

It was not a good experience working with Mantra.  When we arrived Kiran told us we should setup upstairs.  This is the first we heard of this, we signed a contract for downstairs.  We brought special lighting and other equipment specifically for that space and could not just move it to the upstairs floor at the very last second.\\n \\nAfter we were setup downstairs we were told that the air conditioning doesn't work!  This is completely absurd--we sign a contract with you and you neglect to tell us this little fact.  One of the staff then brought down a giant fan.

We had a giant, ugly, broken, dirty fan sitting in the middle of the room all night.     \\n \\nIn addition, your audio equipment down there, especially the mixer, do not work properly.  The mid range on the mixer seems to be busted--I struggled to get it to remain on and it often cut out throughout the night.  When I told Kiran about this he said \\"I've been doing this for over 10 years and there has never been an experienced DJ who has had a  problem\\" (as if to imply that I don't know what I'm doing).  I told him to go down there and look at it himself---but he didn't.  \\n \\nAt the end of the night Kiran tried to make pay for security.

The service is excellent and the staff are incredibly kind and quick to take your order. The line can get a bit long at times but it is always worth the wait. There are many comfortable seats, a couch, clean bathrooms and VERY fast internet. Darwin's also has outstanding breakfast sandwiches and I really recommend all of them.

The first bad sign was that no one was dining there it was practically empty. \\nThe dining room was old outdated and cold. No ambiance or music, awkward silence. \\n\\nStaff greeted us appropriately and service was timely but the chaos going on behind the scene was embarrassing and disrespectful to the owner, to the say the least. They acted so unprofessional and with no regard for the guests. They were carrying on so loudly in the kitchen that we could hear them out in the dining room laughing and joking. We heard cuss words...ef this ef that, roaring loud laughter and jokes about \\"funky monkey butt loving.\\"????? hmmmm  \\n\\nMy boyfriend actually had to go back there and ask them to be quiet.  He asked if they were running a frat house or a restaurant. The conversation was very inappropriate and there were children in the dining room.  \\n\\nThe menu seemed to have all the same ingredients in every dish. I couldn't find anything sounded very good to me. The server was unable to make a recommendation. After being asked what he would recommend,  he said \\"UMMMMMMM WELLLLLLLLL........  our most popular dish is the chicken artichoke thing....  Oh and the meatballs.\\" I was given the impression that he was not fond of the food. \\n\\nWe ordered a bottle of pinot noir, spaghetti and meatballs, chicken cannelloni and the caprese. \\n\\nFood tasted canned or like it came from a jar.  Anything but fresh.!! TASTELESS bland  ...bread stale, cannelloni tasted like pasty glue smothered in an enormous amount of cheese, meatballs bland and  tasted freezer burned,  pasta mushy and way overcooked. I  took 2 bites and was unable to stomach anymore.  \\n\\nThe caprese was the only edible thing and thank goodness we ordered a decent bottle of wine \\nOrdered tiramisu and they were out of it  at 7:00 on a Friday night?? \\n\\nWe asked for to go boxes but ended up just leaving it \\n\\nWe were very unhappy, I can understand occasional bad service if the food is good but It was absolutely terrible. ruined my night.

Don't get me wrong, the drinks and food are generally pretty delicious and the outdoor patio is really nice to sit on, even if they bitch at you for smoking on it. \\n\\nThe problem with garrido's isn't the food or the drinks, it's the salsa and the prices. During HH the apps are $2.00 off and the drinks are the same. However, most of the drinks and apps start at $8.00, so when everything is still $6, it's not that cheap. Their delicious tacos are not on the HH menu, only weak guacamole and salsa that tastes like italian tomato sauce. \\n\\nI really want to like garridos, mostly because of the location, the nice outdoor seating, and the frequent lack of diners in the establishment, but I just can't because of a few large, glaring errors on their part: the too high prices and the crappy salsa being the main ones.

This is more of a Cantonese style hot pot. Although there is a regular Chinese food menu, it looks pretty similar to other Americanized places. If you're going to come here, you should try the hot pot. \\n\\nBroth: We ordered a Surf and Turf with beef and lamb and one ribeye platter. The house broth comes free, or you can order a specialty broth for $3-5 more. The house broth did not have much flavor at all, so that is what you are getting for free. However, when you start to add the condiments on the side (chopped green onion, minced raw garlic, soy sauce, hot chili oil, and satay), your soup begins to have a delicious flavor. We ordered the spicy Szechuan broth and I agree with other reviews, this is SPICY HOT. I'm Asian and I have a very high spice tolerance, but I couldn't take this straight up. It was tongue-numbing. I could have drunk it, but I didn't want to debilitate my taste buds and not be able to enjoy the rest of my meal, so I mixed the spicy broth with the blander house broth and it was just right.\\n\\nPortion size: The waitress said that each hot pot was for one. I would say it's a bit much for one person, but not enough for two. We ordered 3 hot pots for 5 people and it was about right. Each hot pot is split into two halves so you can order two different broths or set one to boiling and one to simmer.\\n\\nQuality: Hands down the ribeye was the best thing there. It was melt-in-your mouth delicious. This is assuming you know how to cook beef in a hot pot, which means dipping it in the boiling broth for about 7 seconds so that it comes out medium rare to rare. They slice it thin and it was so incredibly tender. No other meat came close to the quality of the rib-eye. The other ingredients were okay. The seafood side had shrimp, a few scallops, salmon, and a white fish. It also comes with a small bowl of vegetables, including a large Napa cabbage leaf, one piece of broccoli, one carrot hunk, a slice of radish, a slice of taro, and a tomato. There was something that looked like dirt at the bottom of my vegetable bowl but I didn't investigate too closely. At any rate, any bacteria surely will get boiled to death so I wasn't too worried about it. \\n\\nOther factors: One huge advantage to this place is the easy parking. It's kind of sad that this would make a significant enough difference in Boston, but let's face it, it does. When I think about going to Shabu-Zen, part of me craves hot pot, but a bigger part of me dreads the ordeal that is finding a parking spot in Allston/Brighton. This is largely why I avoid Chinatown, despite the plethora of delicious restaurants there. Yuki-Shabu is in Somerville, and we found a spot right outside the restaurant door. Maybe as Y-S grows in fame, there will no longer be plentiful parking, but until then, I would rather drive a little further if it's going to make my life easier. \\n\\nSummary: I will probably come again, but on a cold, wintry day. We went when it was 70 degrees outside. It is a bit pricey ($23-28 per pot), but my kids loved the experience of cooking their own meal, and the focus is on families and friends sharing a hot meal together. Kudos to Yuki-Shabu for providing a good hot pot place outside the usual neighborhoods."},{"name":"Garrido's","address":"360 Nueces St","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"Stopped in for a few drinks and snacks before we showed our age  at the Blondie and Pat Benatar show at Austin Music Hall.

My dining partner and I sat at a larger table and conversation was not really an option.  \\n\\nI was prepared for cool people to be handling my breakfast but we actually had a very nice, smiley server.  I never realized how rare it is that a server walks by your table just to check on how you're doing in Portland until it happened to me, twice, during my meal.  The food came out quickly, a good thing for a place with a long wait.  The oatmeal chai blueberry pancakes...wow, so good but so rich.  I mean really rich.  Maybe it was just that particular batch, but it was so sweet it was like a dessert.  The pancakes were very dense (I think they're gluten-free?) and it had the consistency of flattened bread pudding.  If that sounds bad then I'm sorry because they were really quite fantastic.  And they served it with a large squeeze bottle of maple syrup so I could douse them every so often.\\n\\nI really wanted to finish them but I just couldn't because they were so rich.  For someone to wait in a flimsy lawn chair for an hour or more to break the fast and not be able to finish two pancakes?  I'm talking SUPER RICH.  Like the celebrity I was.

I am glad I did, because I have never had anything like it.  It is a wonderful and sticky bundt cake made with dates sitting on top of a bed of hot soft custard drenched in toffee sauce which is like a caramel sauce.  How can you not like that?  All in all, I was glad that I ate here.  I never felt uncomfortable dining alone and had a reservation just in case, although I saw them taking walk ups without much of a wait.

It's not vineyards when you see out the patio, but the center of Virginia Highland ain't too bad.  It's one of those places that's charming inside and out.  The infamous brunch wait is kind of an Atlanta landmark.  \\n\\nI have eaten here a few times throughout the years.  The menu is easy-going, if a bit predictable American bistro fare with above average execution.  Sandwiches and brunch items are very good, but out of the ten or so entree dishes I only ever feel excited to try one or two.  I get shrimp and grits everywhere it's served, and find Murphy's version solid and one of the more Cajun interpretations of the dish.  Guinness braised beef brisket is served on just-right house made bread (they have own bakery, where the pastry chef also makes good desserts) which happily sponges the dense and delicious braise liquid.  Enjoy a varied but manageable selection of wines, many available by the glass, and of course if smitten a wine shop is conveniently located on premise.  \\n\\nFunny thing, we must have gotten the same waiter as Addy C. on our last visit.  This guy was weird.  I was very surprised to see such a strangely mannered waiter at such a straight-laced place.  I thought maybe he was on some kind of drug.  I wasn't too bothered, but imagine this could be unpleasant for some people.  \\n\\nThis place is so likable in a conventional sense it's easy to imagine just stopping by on a weeknight, sit at the warmly lit bar, and have a soup and dessert, or something like that.  For some reason I always find myself somewhere else.  It's the \\"plain vanilla\\" factor I guess.  Still, an Atlantan should try an Atlanta classic at least once."},{"name":"Revolution Doughnuts","address":"908 W College Ave","city":"Decatur","stars":"4","text":"I've always been a bit of a doughnut connoisseur. I've had Revolution on my \\"to-do\\" list for months now and I finally got around to checking it out.\\n\\nFirst and foremost, be careful about where you park. There is a decent amount of parking, but there is overflow onto the grass near the train tracks which is where I parked. Lucky me hit what I can only assume is the Eternally Bottomless Pit to Hell where I almost bottomed out. If I go back I'm bringing a bag of gravel as a public service.\\n\\nThe space itself is pretty nice. Very inviting, open and maneuverable. They know when you want a doughnut you want a comfort food, and comfort means \\"give me my own spot where I'm not suffocating next to strangers 2 inches away from me\\". But you didn't come here to admire the spacing of the tables now, did you?\\n\\nThe doughnuts are...unique. Have you been to Sublime? If so, take that taste profile and think the exact opposite; that's Revolution.\\n\\nSublime is light and airy. Revolution has the density of a dying sun. Keep that in mind because the ratio is seriously like 2.5:1. If you normally eat 2 doughnuts and you order 2 here, you'll need to be carted out on a wheelbarrow.\\n\\nSublime is loaded with enough sugar to give you Diabetes. Revolution relies more on texture and unique flavor profiles. In my case I had (not all at once, mind you, I'd be dead from a 1.0 BDC (blood-dough content) if that was the case):\\n\\n\\n- Caramel Bacon: Definitely my favorite, albeit not especially noteworthy. The caramel was super light and as such didn't accent the bacon as much as I would have liked.\\n\\n\\n- The Crunch Mister: This is gruyere cheese and ham. More of a sandwich than a doughnut, really.\\n\\n\\n- Toasted Almond: A good pairing of vanilla and almond.\\n\\n\\n- Shredded Coconut: Generic and bland, but I don't like coconut and I was just finishing someone else's doughnut off.\\n\\n\\nI also had a caramel latte which was average. If a doughnut shop can do great doughnuts AND great coffee, then DAMN, but that is so rare it's kind of sad.\\n\\nAll-in-all, I'd say if you live in Kirkwood and want a nice snack, it's a pretty good place to go, but if it's a bit of a trip, you're better off going to Sublime for a more traditional doughnut.

Each meat and cheese comes paired with an item. Whether is honey mustard or horseradish pickles. They pair them to compliment each other and bring out the flavors in each meat and cheese.

High Street","city":"Columbus","stars":"3","text":"First off, I hate, hate, HATE their redesigned building. The design student who came up with it should be flunked & made to go back to school -- and specifically made to take classes in how humans actually use fast food restaurants & what they expect.\\n\\nThis place is so badly designed. There's nothing directing you in what to do when you walk in. We stood inside the front door for several minutes, trying to figure out where to go & what to do. There's weird-looking kiosk-displays at the very front windows, but nothing to tell you how to proceed or place an order, and worse, no place for actual HUMAN interaction with employees. Yeah, the human employees are all behind a brick-and-glass wall making food & ignoring the customers. There's no real way to communicate, other than going up to that wall and waving/shouting/interrupting their precious work to get their attention.\\n\\nHey, Wendys?? Your CUSTOMERS are more precious than whatever work those kids are doing. We NEED that human interaction. You NEED to have someone out there on the floor to help customers over the bumps of this idiotic new system. Guess what? Not all of us are computer-savvy or can mind-read your store designers to figure out what we're supposed to do. Some of us (bluntly) aren't smart in such matters. Too many of us hate having to interact with a mindless computer screen, especially when the program is NOT intuitive at ALL. \\n\\nIn other words, you're assuming too much know-how from your customers.\\n\\nYou & your competitors have programmed us for years to go to the counter to talk to a Human Being In Uniform to place our order -- suddenly changing all of that & expecting us to somehow know to go to the front windows to place an order on those things that look like fancy soda dispensers is really shitty design.\\n\\nEspecially when ALL of your competitors still use actual human beings to take our orders. There's a time & place to buck the system, but not when your customers are tired & hungry & cranky & need to eat.\\n\\nYou're trying to be a sit-down restaurant. You're NOT. You're a fast food place, where we come in when we want food, fast. We're not there for ambiance. We just want to get our food & leave.\\n\\nYeah. Our first time walking into that new Wendy's will be our last.\\n\\nAll I wanted was a double-stack, plain, with extra American cheese. It took WAY too long to figure out how to even start to place that order into the system, and even THEIR EMPLOYEES COULDN'T SHOW US HOW To DO THAT. Every other food place that uses an Internet or computer-based ordering system, you start with a basic item, then add what you want on it to that item.  With Wendys, they do the OPPOSITE -- you have to figure out that you need to subtract unwanted items off their burger, then add whatever \\"specialty\\" items you wanted.  But there wasn't any way to request EXTRA of existing REGULAR items. I mean, I couldn't figure out how to request extra American cheese, for godssakes, nor extra pickles. Seriously -- there were options for specialty Swiss and Cheddar...but nothing for extra cheese, and definitely nothing for adding an extra slice of American. \\n\\nWe ended up having to interrupt those busy employees behind the glass & brick & get someone out to the little cash register (which is next to the computers, not near the food prep area), and some other customer promptly cut in front of us and took a good 20 minutes looking over the menu to decide what she wanted, all the while holding up those of us behind her.  When we finally got to talk to the server at the register & place our order, she handed us a plastic number card and walked off...without telling us what we were supposed to do.\\n\\nSeriously?? SERIOUSLY?!? \\n\\nSo. There's no obvious place to wait. There's less tables in the place than before the redesign, so sitting at a table when we're trying to get \\"to go\\" doesn't seem right, not when there's customers eating in & needing those seats. With every other fast food place, you wait up at the counter where you placed the order until the nice employee hands you your food bag or tray -- but evidently that's no longer the case at this Wendys, as the single cash register in the place is nowhere near the food-prep area (which is behind that brick&glass wall) & there's no means of communication for anyone to tell us our order's ready & where to pick it up. \\n\\nFinally, we just stood there until **another customer** from the computer kiosks took pity on us and explained that we had to wait at the bar-stools near the front.\\n\\nDoes this description sound confusing? Yeah, it was even WORSE being IN the situation.\\n\\nNext time, I'll just go to McD's. At least they still have human beings & human expectations."},{"name":"Wild Wood Bakehouse","address":"3016 Guadalupe St, Ste 200","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"I have brunch with my dad here when he comes up from San Antonio once a month or so, and have had mixed experiences.

I sit alone on a hotel bed, unsure of the future, as unsure of the future as I am sure that the events of the past will always haunt me. I am 32 years old. A 32 year old accountant working at JP Morgan. I love pizza. My whole life Ive loved pizza. Except for when I was 6. That was a bad year. \\n\\n2 years ago my wife Sharon was diagnosed with Ovarian cancer. It was both the worst and best day of my life. The cable guy had just called me to tell me he would be late, as his daughter had an emergency at school. I smashed the phone down on the table. I would have to go another day without watching Desperate Housewives. While I was putting on my left sock, I got a call on the phone. I picked up the phone and held the phone to my ear. The voice on the phone was my wife on the phone. As my wife spoke on the phone through the phone into the phone held against my ear, my world froze. \\n\\nWhile she was rambling on about some diagnosis, I saw an ad in the newspaper that was laying on the counter. It was an ad, an ad for pizza. Dominos Pizza.\\n\\"Sharon!\\" I interrupted her, just realizing that she was in tears, \\"I found an ad for Dominos Pizza! 50% off on a large 2-topping! And it comes ready!\\"\\n\\"Did you even hear what I said?\\" Sharon sobbed through the phone. \\"I have cancer!\\" \\n\\"But Sharon! 50% off on a LARGE 2 TOPPING!\\" I yelled, hanging up the phone. My dumb wife Sharon never understood anything about my life. Everything was always about her. Like that time she got in a car accident the same day they stopped selling the M&M Klondike Limited Edition bars back in 2009. The whole day had revolved around her in the hospital. \\n\\nI ordered my large pizza online and sat down in my favorite armchair with a copy of \\"The Life of Suri Kappar\\", my favorite book and read a few chapters as I waited for my ready pizza to arrive. \\n\\nThe doorbell rang and my heart skipped a beat. I walked over to the door, staring at the door, as I prepared to open the door to see who was behind the door. \\n\\nI could smell it before I opened it. The tears of my annoying wife, Sharon.\\n\\n\\"Damn it Sharon\\" I sighed, sitting back in my chair. \\n\\nAbout an hour later, Sharon was in the bedroom crying and complaining about the whole cancer thing, but something much more interesting was going on in the living room.\\n\\nMy pizza had arrived a short while ago, ready and great. I just stared at it for 3 hours, too shocked to do anything. After three hours I took my first bite, which was not too great since the pizza was pretty cold.

The service we had was great and the menu is a perfect french menu tailored to American tastes meaning it has a hamburger, which seemed to be popular with people there, we saw a few go by.  The person at the next table was raving about the cassoulet, which we'll definitely try when it gets a little cooler.  We had a smoked trout starter - beautifully presented with a sliced egg garnished with roe, tiny potatoes and cucumbers in a light sauce garnished with lettuces. The trout was perfectly cooked with a wonderful smoky taste that wasn't too overpowering.   The soup of the day was a creamy tomato garnished with a manchego crouton and came with crusty bread and sweet butter for dipping in the soup which was good because we didn't want to waste any of that soup, it was so good.  For main, we had the special which was chicken roulade - chicken wrapped around chicken sausage with a waldorf salad and garnished with blackberries.  Perfectly cooked, perfectly plated.  The $25. lunch special includes a soup or salad, main and any dessert. You can also order a mini glass of wine - 4 oz of the house wine for $5.   This is a great restaurant."},{"name":"Garrido's","address":"360 Nueces St","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"First of all, I want to say this is one of the coolest patios in Austin. I felt like I was in coastal Mexico, not downtown Austin. The patio is beautifully decorated with tropical vegetation and has mysters to keep you cool in the summer. Perfect place to drink a michelada on a hot afternoon.\\n\\nWe came here for Sunday brunch and the food was amazing. I got the lamb chorizo omelette and it was hands down the best omelette I've ever had. The lamb chorizo was delicious and added the perfect kick. The side of refried black beans were some of the best I've ever had too.\\n\\nMy girlfriend ordered the fried oyster tacos. I was lucky she let me have a bite.

The place is called Barrelhouse, so I assumed a larger beer menu. They only had 4 beers on tap, one of which was crappy, mass-produced swill (I can't even remember which one, they're all the same). \\n\\nThe special of the day was fish and chips or a short rib sandwich. I asked if they got seafood delivered daily. No? Ok...then I'll try the other special. The offering was a portion of beef short rib, off the bone, served on ciabatta with cheddar cheese and Duke's mayo. The beef was lovely, nothing too outstanding, but it's been slow cooked, so the flavors are pretty muted. The meat was tender and moist. The ciabatta seemed a bit puny for the meat. Maybe some bread with a little more heft would be better to soak up the juices. Cheddar on the sandwich was ok, but I didn't quite understand the mayo. Mayo is meant to moisten a sandwich, you have the juices from the beef, why muck it up with mayo?! Also, a little bit of greenery on the sandwich would really help with the color and the texture. Meat, cheese, mayo....not terribly innovative, and certainly not befitting the 9 dollar price tag.\\n\\nFor the side, instead of fries I opted for an ostensibly healthier option and asked for the Brussels sprouts. They arrived covered in cured pork. Pretty sure it was bacon, but it was so salty that I can't be sure. It kinda negated the point of going with the healthier option. The sprouts were cooked well, but there was a LOT of salt in the dish. Maybe they salted in addition to the bacon? Either way, I would have gone with the fries as I paid $2 for the Brussels sprout upgrade.\\n\\nTheir bottled beer menu is nothing to scoff at, but more taps would be nice.\\n\\nAll in all, it's a decent place. Most importantly, I would go back and give another try to some other menu items. They have specials every night of the week, save Sunday. If you're into cheap drinks, one of these special nights may be worth a visit."},{"name":"Jam On Hawthorne","address":"2239 SE Hawthorne Blvd","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Decided to start the New Year off right with an early breakfast at Jam.

They bring out an assortment of different sauces to choose from so you can make every bite a little different. \\n\\nThe fried pickles and tartar sauce are AMAZING. The mac and cheese is pretty good too, but there are definitely better sides.

If you finish the whole 16 inches in one sitting, you have a problem.  My roommate did once, and he hasn't looked the same with his shirt off since.  The $9 subs on fresh French bread last you for lunch and dinner.  The steak and cheese is delectable, but be forewarned that you must order with extra cheese, and with 'everything' on it.  Eyebrows are often raised and the staff second guesses your 'everything' order, but don't be scared - stand up for yourself.  Give it right back to them.\\n\\nAlso to be had - the meatball sub: the meatballs melt in your mouth.  Again, maybe they could use a little more cheese.  Even the cold sandwiches got it going on.  My only complaint is that the 'special' which consists of some fancy Italian meat, mozzarella, basil and balsamic vinaigrette could use some more meat and a little less cheese but maybe I just got it on a bad day.

When the restaurant opened, the chefs prior restaurant experience, why he moved to Florida, that they make their own ketchup ... we heard it all. After a five minute monologue we ordered drinks, and then food.\\n\\nAfter a speech like that, my meal should be a total culinary panty dropper. Except ... it wasn't. My carbonara was good but not bursting with anything new or unique. My companion's burger came out without the requested cheddar cheese. \\n\\nThe menus, decor, and waitstaff clothing are all rather discordant.

You'll also get the full treatment from the nice folks behind the counter who are beyond helpful when you have no clue what you really want, yet you know you want something. \\n\\nThis photogenic shop specializes in the glories of Italy, from assorted olive oils and cheeses to a broad array of wine selections. It is a charmingly small space, covered from floor to ceiling with colorful ingredients and food. What do you want? Fresh bread, home made pasta, the authentic Italian Nutella, not the Americanized version, take out food, deli meats and more can all be uncovered here. It is also a rich reminder of the past, when there were no Stop N Shops, Whole Foods and Market Baskets. In that way, it is a little cultural gem, not just for the food lover, but for the historian and anyone with an interest in small businesses. \\n\\nIf you are wary of spending 6 or 7 dollars a pound for home made pasta. stuck to whatever is on sale at Shaw's in a thin blue box, indulge, even just once, in the genuine article here at Monica's. You barely need anything to go with it, but a small amount of olive oil, garlic, grated cheese or fresh pasta sauce will do the trick.

I am a big foodie who travels over 40% of the time and I constantly eat or entertain clients at best restaurants around the country.  I was able to call and get a seating for 7 of us on Saturday night at 9:30.  It was well worth the wait to eat late.\\n\\nOur group consisted of my friends and family that in their own rights are great cooks.  We wanted to try Bondir because we heard/read good things about Chef Jason Bond and his staff.  For sure he didn't disappoint us.\\n\\nThere were so many little things that made our dinner more enjoyable.  Many of these little delights are written in previous reviews but I believe that is why I would want to go back to Bondir.  \\n\\nFrom first moment we arrived, we were cordially invited to take a seat by the fireplace.  We enjoyed beer and wine while soaking in the warmth of the fireplace and engaing in pleasant conversations with staff and few other patrons; a unique experience in itself.  Bondir has an excellent wine and imported beer list at reasonable prices.\\n  \\nBest part of the night was our meal and how we could order it.  Because Bondir allows you to order half portions (brilliant idea), we were able to virtually order everything and share among friends.  That was so much fun.  Every course represented something unique so, I learned with every dish.  Soup was just fantastic and it included lime caviar. These are little citron pearls from a lime shaped like a pea pod.  We asked to see it and Chef gladly showed it to us; my first.  Beet salad was perfectly executed.  Meats and fish were outstanding. We had boar, cod, and beef brisket.  Hand-made pasta really enhanced our experience.  To finish, we ordered three different deserts to share; Chocolate Enlightenment (perfect for chocolate lovers), Tangerine Dream (in a bowl inside a cup that was sliding around but made you grab on and enjoy it more), and Crostata made to order with red wine-poached pear, almond cream and lemon mousseline.  This one was simply a perfect desert which if you close your eyes and eat it, you would taste, apple pie, pear delight and lemon tart all in one bite.\\n\\nUp to now, the only rating on Yalp that is less than 5 but still respectable (3) is from Jeff M.  who seemed to eat there on the same night as we did.  I can honestly say; we had a totally different (much better) impression.  I truly respect Jeff M.'s point of view and I guess that is why it's nice to read different comments.  Here are some of my personal thoughts on Jeff M.'s comments: \\n\\nFood - I agree with him on proteins being done just right.  I thought it was all great!  Same as Jeff, I thought using hazelnut with code was odd.  Then again, I recall asking to clean up and eat the last bite of that plate too :).  I disagree that there was too much happening in a plate.  At the end of the day, I want my dish to introduce me to a new taste.  If I wanted something simple then I would've cooked at home.\\n\\nBreads - yes, at first glance all 3 did seem similar but it was far from it. In fact, we spend a good while discussing it at the table.  We thought it was a bold move by Chef to use all grain versus so many restaurants that use white breads.  All three breads were totally different in taste.  One was cranberry-walnut; the other 9-grain (simple); and the last, perhaps the most interesting one of all which we couldn't get enough of, was the Sepia-Nori.  It represented a unique balance of whole grains, salt particles and squid ink that delightfully intrigued everyone to extent of begging for more.\\n\\nService - Our experience was amazing.  Not only they explained every dish that they brought to our table but every staff was quite educated on what ingredients were used and how it enhanced the dish.  Kudos to Chef Jason Bond for making sure his staff knows about what they serve.\\n\\nWe decided to put Bondir on our favorite list and make it new tradition to eat at."},{"name":"Fernando's Mundo Fiesta","address":"SW 4th Ave & SW College St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"With so many delicious options in the PDX when it comes to food carts, it's difficult to decide.

They kept the doors open late on Thursdays, and admission was free. It was always a bit chaotic, but there was something about the place that soothed the soul. \\n\\nWhen I went to the Columbus Museum of Art, I had similarly high hopes. I'm no art snob - the pieces in the CMA are just as impressive as the AIC, though just not as many. And while I love the fact that the museum is extremely kid friendly, the amount of children running rampant around the rooms was overwhelming, distracting and downright annoying. \\n\\nI'm a huge advocate for arts education, and do think that children should be exposed to these types of experiences as early in their lives as possible. But the CMA needs to really think about their layout. Can they have a private kids section with activities and such, and leave the adults alone to enjoy the art in a bit more peace and quiet? \\n\\nI know it's not that easy, but I was only there about 15 minutes before I realized that this place wasn't for me.

(and that one in Canton is a ripoff)\\n\\nI came here for lunch and first noticed that it was the deli I used to go when I worked in Quincy (and my first ever Yelp review). I guess this review's a full-circle sorta thing, hehe. Anyway, the decor fits more for a southwest/tex-mex/Central American restaurant. The warm mahogany walls are nice anyway. There were reed baskets on top and a beaded mat hung over the windows. The two tables by the windows are nice for a couple.\\n\\nThe service was brusque at first. The waitress was rather rushy and not exactly the warmest to us. Only when I spoke a bit of Korean to her and showed my knowledge of Korean food did she warm up to me. \\n\\nAdmittedly, I'm rather spoiled when it comes to Korean food. Frequent trips to LA, a couple of trips to NY/NJ, and a couple more to Seoul...do that to you. So I dropped my expectations greatly. To be honest, the food was actually decent. I had a kalbi lunch box and the kalbi itself was well-seasoned and I liked the searness of the beef. It was on top of a bed of onion and bean sprouts. \\n\\nThe salad with the meal was awful - sunflower seeds, raisins, and some unknown vinagrette. It was a cross between a pico de gallo, chopped salad, and trail mix. \\n\\nThe panchan was limited, as I only had kimchee, marinated bean sprouts, and marinated tofu. The kimchee was one of the more hotter ones I've had. A rookie would get roughed up by that.\\n\\nI'll definitely give it another shot and try out something more Korean like yukijang or chapchae."},{"name":"Magnolia Cafe South","address":"1920 S Congress Ave","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"Not very impressed with the hamburger. \\n\\nThe bison meat was good, a little gamy but I guess that's what bison tastes like. The problem comes from the hamburger bun: just dry & tasteless. Not doughy at all. The cheese made of melted mozarella would taste better on a pizza, the jar pickles are generic tasting coin shaped slices and the red bell pepper slices would've been tasty if they were marinated and/or grilled. Only one little lettuce leaf. Overall, not blown away, which is sad because the restaurant has the potential to make it so much better with only a few simple changes. The first steps could start with a quality bun and an interesting home made sauce. The menu claimed a 'Chipotle Mayo sauce', I got instead a Hellmann mayo and fake Dijon mustard.\\n\\nThe burger came with a huge side of sauteed quarter sliced potatoes. First of all, the burger is huge, and fries should be what is served by default, not these tasteless potatoes. There were enough potatoes to feed a family of 5. Unfortunately bland and tasteless. Make it exciting, add some rosemary, garlic, or cut them in thick chips served with home made sauces, make it a pleasureful experience. I don't want to feel like I'm paying 25 bucks (tip included with drink) to sit and eat at my middle school cafeteria. Who wants to remember their teenage crisis?\\n\\nService was alright, nothing to complain about. I know they work hard late night hours and that is never easy, props to them dealing with long difficult shits. \\n\\nI never really understood the reason behind enormous menus with 100s of items on them. It seems impossible to keep food fresh and tasty. All these options just add more pressure to the cooks and more frustration from the confused customers like me who simply want to pick a good meal in less than a minute.\\n\\nI guess this place is for groups who choose Magnolia as a last minute hangover cure.
