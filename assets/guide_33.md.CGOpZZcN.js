It is by no means perfect, but then again Scandinavians are known for being humble and avoiding praise.  Be prepared to wait. Most likely outdoors since the waiting area stands five people at best.  Today's visit proved a ridiculous amount of waiting time - 2 hours from signing in to walking back out the door.  We were seated near the back of the restaurant, and I had a birds-eye view of the food preparation.  The absolute care that the cooks take makes it so worth the wait.  Every plate is a small portion of perfection - in taste and presentation.  Also there are some tiny yet authentic touches to the overall d√©cor that contribute to the experience - like the WC (water closet) sign next to the bathroom door.\\n\\nI opted today to start with the gravlax; one of my favorite Swedish treats which has been damn good on each and every visit.  Then onto the Swedish meatballs.  It was served with a perfectly fresh small salad topped of with an assortment of pickled vegetables and light dressing.  The meatball size and quantity was perfect.  While I still think my Auntie Mary Carol's meatballs taste better alone, the sauce Broder serves theirs up with is amazing! Add a dollop of tart lingonberry jam, and I was transported straight back to Stockholm in 1999.  My dining companion had the mushroom and carmelized onion scramble that was light, fluffy and flavorful.  Even my vanilla latte was one of the best I've had in a long while.\\n\\nI have had the same server on every visit, and he is the most adorable blonde hipster on Clinton Street.  He was overwhelmed with the busy morning, yet still attentive and apologetic regarding the ridiculous wait.  I asked for the second time if they happened to carry semla (my most favorite and delectable Swedish Christmas pastry) and was excited to hear that they had prepared it a couple of times for special dinner desserts, and that he would mention to the chef that maybe they should carry it more often.  Oh dear Broder, please, please carry it more often, I promise I will make it worth your while!  Also, dear cute hipster server, please do away with the overly loud Madonna and Cyndi Lauper being played all morning.

They are no serving ITALIAN.  NO MORE SUSHI.  Sadness.\\n\\n==================================================\\n\\nThe below is when this place was a straight up sushi restaurant (Jae's), day and night, and not just a club:\\n\\nI went here to other day with my boyfriend's dad for lunch, because he wanted to come in to the city and have lunch and visit.  I hadn't been in, and I work next door, so when he asked me where I'd like to go, I said that this would be my choice!  We went in and it has a good atmosphere, though a little dark for lunch, and they service was good.  We ordered, and he ordered the crab cakes and I splurged and decided to have some sushi, since I hadn't had any since before first of the year, and I love sushi.  I ordered a lunch box, and our food was relatively quick.  It came with a lot of food, and I didn't end up finishing.  It had either hot and sour soup or miso, and I went with the miso, a few pieces of shumai, a dumpling, fried thinly sliced tofu, a salad, and some California rolls and some large pieces of sushi.  It was delicious and really inexpensive, much less than I thought it would be, not that I had to pay.  I would suggest this place to anyone who enjoys sushi, or seafood in general.  It was really an enjoyable place to go, and I intend on visiting them during their happy hours in the future!"},{"name":"JMueller BBQ","address":"1502 S 1st St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"My wife and I hit up JMueller BBQ today for my first time.  I must say I've been anxiously awaiting their opening since earlier this summer when they announced their plans to reopen.\\n\\nFirst observations are that it is easy to miss if you aren't looking.  It's on the right if you are headed down 1st away from downtown.  Also that parking lot will be a mud pit if Austin should ever be blessed with rain.\\n\\nThe question most people will want to know is how does it compare to the Holy Grail of BBQ that is known on the other side of town as Franklins?  In a nut shell it's the only place so far in town that will give Franklins a run for their money but it's no Franklin's...yet.\\n\\nThey have a few more meats than Franklin with beef ribs on the menu today and pork loin, plus ribs, turkey, brisket and sausage and maybe one other that I missed.\\n\\nBrisket - very very good.  This is their best meat of the 3 we tried.  They wrap in butcher paper (but white) similar to Franklin's method.  The fatty was super tasty, the lean wasn't too dried out and the samples were great.  The brisket had a great peppery bark with the proper carmelization that is rare to find.\\n\\nTurkey - super moist but we felt that it lacked a little flavor - it didn't have that delicious combo of turkey, smoke and seasoning that we love but the moistness of the meat makes up for it.\\n\\nRibs - I was a little surprised that the ribs are so short here.  They are like mini-me ribs.  They were smoked well and had good flavor but they aren't your regular sized spare ribs.  They were good though.\\n\\nCole Slaw - I don't like cole slaw but my wife loves it and really didn't like theirs.  She thought it was a chipolte slaw.  She started her meal with it and it affected the rest of her meal, which ended with me liking this place overall more than her.\\n\\nSauce - it's a vinegar / thinner tomato based sauce with the emphasis on tomato.  It's great on beef, ok on turkey IMO.\\n\\nA couple other observations.  No gloves.  I REALLY prefer that people who touch my food wear gloves, especially if they are going back and forth from the counter to the smoker.  Speaking of smoker, it seems like it would be more efficient to turn the smoker around so the two trailer doors line up.\\n\\nOverall they have a great start, the brisket is close to Franklin's with no line (at the moment).  I will return to try their beef ribs which looked really good.  The only other observation is the customer experience at Franklins is more laid back and friendlier than here.  The meat cutter seems more interested in moving you through the line than ensuring you get a great BBQ experience here at the moment.\\n\\nIf you are a fan of BBQ this is a new must try stop."},{"name":"Pinthouse Pizza","address":"4236 S Lamar Blvd","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"This place is awesome!

While I embrace the concept, I think it was executed poorly, or rather, it felt very unfinished. The front door was very easy to miss and the red neon sign really didn't stand out to me at all. The place looked big in the photos but felt small when I walked in. The tables are a bit too close to each other for me. I would definitely recommend making a reservation first since there are only that many tables and people tend to stay there for more than 2 hours. \\n\\nThe staff was very friendly and approachable. However, they may also appear inexperienced, which is understandable. One thing that really stood out for me was the number of lights in the ceiling. There were way too many than necessary. The center of this establishment should be gaming and drinking. The light should focus on each table instead of blending everything together. I don't know who planned the tables, but they seriously need to change that. The tables and chairs are also not consistent.  They are all different color and shape through out the whole place. They also put their specials and pricing on the support beams, which is a cool idea. However, a lot of people don't bother reading them since the place was way too bright and they just get washed out. With all bright light in the ceiling, somehow it was a very good idea to use very light color on the wall. The whole place looked very washed out. Just a big meh when I walked in. They should really re do how they display their board games. The shelf was pretty terrible. At least mount them on the wall. The list can go on and on but I am going to stop right here. I really want them to succeed which is why I am being harsh.\\n\\nPros: Cool idea, friendly staff\\n\\nCons: Terrible design for a place that is brand new.

It's a small space about 10ft x 8ft. My wife and I just came back from a nice homely dinner at Mother's. We were dressed 'out-of-place' nice which is unusual for me. I don't like feeling like the 'suit' in the room. Regardless, our sugar craving can withstand any obstacles. We proceed. We're 2nd in line and before I even look up at the menu, the guy in front has placed his order... crap... pressure. The guy behind the counter wasn't the type to wait around to see what we want. There was also a line starting to form behind us... shit, pick something damn't. F--- it. \\"I'd like a chocolate donut with the creamy filling.\\" Apparently, they come in a few shapes and I was told rather rudely. \\"Shit... okay, just the round filled doughnut.\\" Whew... pressure's off. In the meanwhile, I look at my wife. She's still looking up at the menu. She's smiling, taking her sweet, ole' time. I can tell Mr. Voodoo on the other side of the counter isn't going to take anymore of this. But my wife's sweet and cute, he can't possibly snap at her. And he didn't. But I can feel his brewing impatience about to errupt. Stressful seconds later, she finally makes a gesture to order. Semi rudely, he says \\"So you made up your mind?\\"  I sort of giggled inside. This place rules, I think to myself. What a relief to find a place that's just 'real'. It's refreshing to walk in a place and get some honesty for a change. This place isn't even close to trying to be a comfy, feel good, let's-all-hug, kind of place. It's a little angry, in-your-face actually. So we get our doughnuts, we pay and to my surprise the man behind the counter became just the nicest guy. I forgot his words exactly, but it was genuine. We were so full that night that we actually had to wait to eat our doughnuts until the next morning. Bad idea, right? Wrong! The doughnut was excelent! Yes, even bagged and a day old.

If you sneeze, you may miss this place. That would be a travesty for any ramen lover.  The restaurant is very small, and offers a very limited menu that includes three variations of Sapporo ramen - Miso, Shoyu and Tan Tan. I had never had Sapporo style ramen, but I was pleasantly surprised. The technique involves using a wok to caramelize the sauce with the vegetables, then adding the broth. The result is a richly flavored ramen. I ordered the Tan Tan (amazing) and my boyfriend ordered the MIso (also amazing). Our waiter brought us three different sauces to add to our ramen to help shape the flavors. The portions are big, but this was the first time I couldn't help myself and I ate the entire bowl.

Frightened that I might be losing my touch (read: my precious popularity), my fears were allayed when Melissa A. came to my rescue by asking me to brunch at Frank while commenting on a completely unrelated status update on Facebook. I let out a sigh of relief. I couldn't fathom not having a brunch buddy on Sunday after church. That was close. Too close. \\n\\nFrank, huh? You know, as someone so intimately acquainted with The Warehouse District, I was surprised at myself for not having yet visited this gourmet wiener restaurant. I suppose that can be attributed to the fact that I'm usually busy with the wieners across the street at Oil Can Harry's and Rain. Yet in all seriousness, and without having seen the menu, my imagination flashed horrible, disturbing images of what to expect. Images such as chopped up hot dogs mixed with eggs, or a hot dog replacing a celery stalk in a Bloody Mary. Like I said, I could have read the menu online and put my mind at ease, but part of me wanted to torture myself and then be totally surprised. \\n\\nWhen I arrived, I was pleased to see it was bustling with activity, and before I could finish a single magazine article at the front waiting area, Melissa joined me. The hostess was extremely friendly, and explained to me--the newcomer--that they offered such dishes as chicken & waffles and shrimp & grits for brunch. I let out my second sigh of relief. No hot dog hash served up in here. Just southern comfort food with a Tex-Mex twist.   \\n\\nWe were seated up on the stage used for live bands, which I didn't mind a bit because I love to be seen, especially when sporting my favorite deep lavender Armani shirt, which was already heavily complimented at church that morning. Oh, and yes--I was completely overdressed for Frank. It's definitely more of a come-as-you-are kind of place. But I had an excuse: I dress up for Jesus.  \\n\\nThe first pear mimosa hadn't even been sipped yet before the usual brunch conversation ensued: Boys, boys, and more boys. I used the occasion to try something new (i.e., listen to someone else for a change), and Melissa regaled me with stories of the straight dating world. It was insightful, and a refreshing change, since I'm stuck bitching about the same person. And frankly, even *I'm* sick of hearing about him. \\n\\nOur waiter was chipper and prompt, and always kept our mason jars of water filled. Melissa and I made a pact to order the shrimp & grits (Six shrimp, yellow grits, gouda, red eye espresso gravy, bacon lardons), and the Texas Benedict (Jumbo split cheddar biscuit topped with pulled pork, fried eggs, jalapeno hollandaise) respectively, and then share. \\n\\nThere was never a dull moment, especially with whoever this DJ was they had cranking out all the tunes I love--namely, 80's and early 90's music. We sort of danced in our chairs during \\"Bizarre Love Triangle\\", and if there had been a microphone nearby I probably would have just gone with it and put that stage to use. Also, kudos to the DJ for somehow seamlessly mixing in Vanilla Ice's \\"Ninja Rap\\" from the second Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle movie. As I continued to move to the lyrics \\"Ninja, ninja, rap!\\", it occurred to me that Madonna slept with that man. God, the early 90's were weird. \\n\\nI adored my Texas Benedict. What's not to love about a spiced up version of a brunch classic? The pulled pork was especially moist. Melissa liked her shrimp and grits well enough, but in all honesty found a couple of them to be obviously under-cooked. However, when this was brought to the manager's attention, she immediately took steps to have new shrimps brought out. But when that ran into some delay, she decided to comp Melissa's meal entirely. Not every place is perfect (and Frank was really busy that day), but a restaurant's most important test is usually how they utilize customer service to rectify a mistake. Frank did this well, so the impression we left with was definitely positive. \\n\\nIn fact, my bestie Jen L. has requested to visit Frank when she comes to visit, based solely on the photos alone. I don't see why not. \\n\\nThank you, Frank. Any Sunday brunch I can spend with a dear friend over booze while shoveling carbs in my mouth to the hallowed sounds of 80's music gets a gold star in my book. \\n\\nWell, 4 gold stars, at least.

I had the shio ramen previously and while it's good, it's somewhat simple (usually I prefer simple) and was not as exciting or tasty as the Kara Miso.  I recommend going after some of that deliciously tender pork immediately.  If you let it sit too long it will cook and become tough.  As far as sizes go, the large has an incredible amount of noodles.  No matter who you are you will be full after eating a large here.  The server questioned me when I ordered the large size.

Fortunately for Bison County, someone knows how to pick beers. \\n\\nAtmosphere is decent - spacious, rustic, open, etc. Waitresses are fairly attentive. Menu is obviously focused on BBQ and other meat - alot of which is cooked on a grill in an open kitchen area at the back of the restaurant.  The grilled meat looked fine - most things seem to marinate in their own little bag, which is dumped onto the grill at cooking time. I suspect the grilled items would be decent. \\n\\nBut we're here for BBQ. My table had a variety of BBQ'd meats - pulled pork, chicken, ribs, and brisket. All claimed to be \\"mesquite smoked\\". For the record, Mesquite is not a smoke wood that you should ever use - its best use is artificially on \\"bbq\\" potato chips. So I'm hesitant to even start off. \\n \\nLets start with presentation.. when you order your pulled pork/chicken they ask what kind of sauce you want - \\"regular\\" or \\"honey bbq\\". Not very impressive selections! Now, if you select honey bbq, your pork arrives in what the table agreed as \\"pea soup\\" colored. Really odd appearance. And seriously, there should be no need to mix the sauce IN for us - keep it in a cup on the side. Good BBQ does NOT NEED SAUCE. Then there's the mound of pulled chicken - which is not pulled. This stuff is.. smushed. Its appearance is that of tuna salad. No real meat character here, just a pasty mush of something that used to be chicken. \\n\\nThe brisket had a dab of sauce, as did the ribs. Good - these should not come sauced up. The brisket did not look smoked, but it was thin sliced and very tender. The \\"southern ribs\\" - spares - were very good sized and meaty. \\n\\nNow, on to the flavor. Out of the 4 types of meat - the only one with ANY smoky flavor was the chicken paste. Unfortunately it was a strangely dry pile of meat substance - kind of sucked the moisture out of your mouth. Slathered in sauce, it could have been edible but in no way was this true BBQ. \\n\\nThe \\"pea soup\\" pulled pork - while I found a couple little pieces of \\"bark\\" - did not have any smoke or spice. The bark had some color from smoking, but the outer edge did not have the crust that good BBQ should have - no rub on this meat. The honey bbq did not come out tasting like BBQ - it was just a saucey pile of meat. Did not taste bad but did not taste like BBQ. It was at least moist, unlike the chicken mash. \\n\\nThe brisket - which had a nice texture  - again totally lacked smoke. In fact it tasted like brisket that was cooked in an oven - the kind you'll find in a good deli. Not BBQ brisket. It was nice meat but again, not BBQ. At all. And the \\"sauce\\" on it was not a very tasty BBQ sauce unfortunately. \\n\\nThe ribs were very meaty - and very tender. The meat came off the bone fairly well - however once again.. NO SMOKE! And no rub - the meat was just.. meat. I was really disappointed in the ribs and brisket - these ones didn't seem to have ever made it into a smoker. \\n\\nThe slaw was very.. wet.. pretty plain and lacking any real flavor. Would have covered up the lack of smoke on a pulled pork sandwich I suppose, or added moisture to the chicken paste on a bun. The sweet potato fries were good - nice and crispy. The baked beans were probably the best item on the table to be honest - bacon and brisket were cooked in the beans to add some nice flavor. Mmm beans.\\n\\nApps - forgot about those - we had the calamari, corn fritters and these \\"fire!!!\\" shrimp. The calamari was fine -  very large rings with some kinda ranchy sauce. The fritters were tasty.. really what fried batter isnt good? The sauce it was served with was odd - I think its the house BBQ sauce? Or maybe honey mustard, was hard to tell. And then there's the \\"fire!!!\\" shrimp. Tender shrimps that were likely marinated, grilled and topped with a slash of hot sauce. Not exactly \\"fire!!!\\" and since there are only 5 or 6 on the plate.. eh. The cornbread was good, forgot to mention that.\\n\\nSo the extra star - some good beers on tap - Smuttynose, Old Speckled Hen, and a few other decent micro brews. \\n\\nOverall, you can fill your belly and still have leftovers - but if you go here looking for BBQ - turn around - actually just go across the street to Jake/Earls Dixie BBQ.. or drive 3 miles to Blue Ribbon which will blow Bison out of the water. \\n\\nOh and lets go over parking - trying to find a spot near Moody is always a disaster - so be ready for some aggravation if you haven't had the pleasure of trying to park in the area. If you are lucky, your friends will have a beer waiting for you wherever you eat."},{"name":"Two Urban Licks","address":"820 Ralph McGill Blvd NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Awesome food and wonderful staff!

We were seated at 2:00PM and they were not busy. There were three of us. One ordered soup, another ordered a burger and I ordered a chicken sandwich. We waited and waited and finally got our food just after 2:30. My chicken sandwich was cold. I don't mean room temperature cold as though it had be sitting for 10 minutes, I mean out of the refrigerator cold. I though maybe it was supposed to be cold because how in the world does a freshly grilled chicken sandwich get refrigerator cold?  I asked the waitress if it's supposed to be cold and she shook her head, picked up the plate and walked away without saying a word!  She came back a few minutes later and said they were making me a new one. She didn't apologize. 12 minutes later she brings out my sandwich and it was hot as can be. So hot, I had to let it cool off. The other two people I was with had already finished their meals and decided they'd get dessert. Afraid the desserts would take as long as our meals, we ordered them before I had taken more than 2 bites from my sandwich. She said the desserts would be on the house which was very nice and I do appreciate it. They took forever though and we regretted ordering them....well, until they showed up!  Desserts were delicious. The manager came over at one point and apologized which I appreciated however, I wish someone would have told me how I managed to get an ice cold sandwich in the first place. The only thing I can think of is the sandwiches are not made fresh and instead they're pre-made and simply warmed before serving. Someone apparently forgot to warm mine which makes the long wait all the more baffling.  When the check came they did not charge for any of the desserts or my sandwich which is more than fair and it's the reason why this review gets 2 stars rather than 1.  The waitress did finally apologize and i think her lack of an apology sooner was due to trying to fix the problem rather than just being unsympathetic. I don't live in the area so I doubt I'd ever find a need to go back here, but if I did I wouldn't return.

I had to approach one of the employees to inform her that there was 13 of us dining in. She seemed frustrated and split our party (2 groups) although we insisted that we would like to sit altogether -- we were willing to wait, but that was a no-go. \\n\\nAs we patiently sat separately from each other, my sister and I noticed the large area with the booth opened up. The large booth area was obviously able to accommodate our party of 13. I kindly asked one of the servers if we may move our party to the booth area and she immediately (rudely) replied \\"no, only for single!\\" My sister asked another server (not knowing I already asked one server) the same question and was informed \\"Yes!\\" we may move our party to the booth area. So, that is exactly what we did. \\n\\nSuddenly, the server who informed me \\"no...\\" came up to me while I was holding a bowl and snatched the bowl away from my hand. I was shocked and did not know how to respond. She was angry that we moved our party to the booth area and started cursing at me and my family in Vietnamese. What the employees did NOT know is that my family is mixed Vietnamese and we DO understand some Vietnamese. Also, my sister-in-law, who is full Vietnamese, speaks Vietnamese fluently. \\n\\nImagine the look on our faces! \\n\\nHalf of our party wanted to leave the restaurant immediately and the other half did not because 1) they were starving and 2) they felt \\"sorry\\" for the servers (a few of my family members assumed the servers were just having a bad day). \\n\\nWe decided to stay and finished our meals.... The flavors were honestly good, but the horrible service made the food taste not-so-good. \\n\\nI honestly DID NOT want to leave a tip as I felt disrespected and unvalued as a customer. However, my brother insisted that we leave them a tip because that would 1) make them feel sorry for what they did to us and 2) make their day better. \\n\\nWe left a 30% tip, walked away, and will NEVER come back."},{"name":"Voodoo Doughnut - Old Town","address":"22 SW 3rd Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"I got the bacon maple doughnut and it was amazing. line was long and you wait in the sun but if you go early it's short.

But honestly speaking, the food was so good, so flavorful and so deliciously awesome that they can market themselves as whatever cuisine they please since they are so damn good at it. \\nWe had the PICADILLO ACEBICHADO, and the Des Pescado Cebiche amongst the tapas, the Aroz Con Pato (the Duck) and CARAPULCRA CON PUERCO (Pork Loins) in the entrees. Everything was superb, particularly enjoyed the duck and the tamarind like sauce the pork came with. The rice was superb too. Just this much would have earned it my 5 stars without a sweat, but the desserts just blew me away, feel like giving this place an extra star for that.

I got a slice of pizza yesterday, along with roast beef and buffalo wings.   Let me break it down item by item.\\n\\nThe Pizza - a little greasy, but good.  The inner crust is soft and the outer crust is cruncy, always a nice combination.  The cheese is very good.\\n\\nThe Roast Beef - thinly  shaven, tasty, toasted on a sesame seed bun.  I got it with mayo and american cheese as I usually do.  The mayo was good and the cheese was very good, just like the cheese on the pizza.  At least they are consistent.  The roast beef comes in a small, regular, and large and each is fairly priced compared to other quality beef competitors.  It's not the best or one of the best I have ever had.  Their roast beef is not top 10 for the region, but I would say they are definately top 20 for Boston and the North Shore, based on my experience.\\n\\nThe Buffalo Wings - ah the buffalo wings...hmmm....what a major disappointment.  They were not boneless.  They give you six quality wings, but they were way overpriced at 7.74.  More than a buck a wing is not worth it.  They do not give you much buffalo sauce or hot sauce, and the sauce was not that flavorful.  It gave me that good burning feeling on my lips, but it did not give me that good burning sensation that is full of flavor on my tongue.

While looking over the menu I noticed that not much has changed about the decor- still love the feel of this place, and the big car behind glass in the corner of the seating area.

Also decided to try the Sullivan's Gulch coffee- a latte with blackberry syrup. My friend ordered the bunkhouse vittles- one slice of french toast, two eggs, meat,  and potatoes. We both loved the french toast of course, and eggs were cooked just the way we wanted them (mine scrambled, hers sunny side up). Potatoes were okay; maybe a little dry and more bland than I would like. Coffee was nothing special; probably better to stick with the mixed alcoholic drinks (they have a full bar) or drip coffee here. Service was fast and friendly; no complaints whatsoever there.

It's a rather appropriate name for the place because you have to be optimistic that you will be ordering a dish that this place happens to make correctly.\\n\\nOh where to begin. \\n\\nI was coming to The Optimist on the invitation of a friend, my boyfriend, and several other friends for a party of 6. Apparently a friend said that they called ahead and were told that the earliest seating they could get us in on would be around 9:30; but we walked in around 7 and were told we could sit in either the 'tapas' styled menu bar area or the main menu dining room.  We chose the dining room. \\n\\nThe menu is small and gives you the option of the major seafood options. You will however find when you sit down, the menu is well ... rather pricy. Oysters well run you about $$2.50$$ A PIECE.  Shrimp is 12 dollars for a half a pound. \\n\\nMy boyfriend elected on getting the fish and chips (18$). The fish was very rich and if you like fish as such, you will enjoy it. The fries were made in a shoe string fashion and could be described as rather crunchy (to the determent of the dish). I had tried some myself and thought I have had much better; the bf also felt he has had much better as well. Fish and Chips should be served with steak fries anyway. More on this in a bit. \\n\\nI had elected to order the Seafood Gumbo with something called \\"pot luck\\" garlic bread. It was needless wrap in a busy piece of paper and string. The garlic bread was rather substandard. The bread was good but the garlic flavoring just came across as lazy. The gumbo... OHHH THE GUMBO. The gumbo was not gumbo. Some people might have reviewed this dish on here and liked it. More power to you but it was not gumbo. The moment I took a bite i could tell something was rather off. As a fan of Creole/Cajun, I believe they were going for the more Cajun variety in which the roux is almost burnt. A few bites in and the imposter 'gumbo' was giving itself away. It was flat and bland; I believe the chef (whom I can say for certain has NEVER been to Louisiana kitchen) tried to compensated for imposter gumbo by over spicing it. The issue the spice only kicks in the after bite and it fell flat on its face. I explained, along with two companions in my party our opinion of the imposter. They fessed up the roux was made with OLIVE OIL..... AH HA mystery solved. Roux is made with butter... and only butter. If this chef cannot make a good roux, he has no business putting this on the menu as gumbo. It was needless to say a major disappointment. \\n\\nOk on to my next course. Shrimp. I got the half pound for 12 dollars. Sigh.. Ok well lets see here. The shrimp was very tender but sadly WAY over spiced. So much over spiced that I did not finish. Shrimp do not need to be this spicy.. they have quite enough flavor to stand up on their own.  I would have complained but frankly I thought I might be pushing karma if I sent a second dish back. \\n\\nThe highlight of the evening was some very delicious hush puppies with a very yummy sweet butter dipping sauce. They were the least expensive thing we ordered and because the wait staffed seem rather slow, we got them when we were pretty much finished with our food and they elected wisely (saving their tip) to not charge us for them. \\n\\nIF you get the chance be sure to order the push-pop key-lime pie, its rather yummy. A member of our party knew the pastry chef and we were given the range of their desserts on the house. They were all excellent. \\n\\nALL and ALL, this place (other than the pastry chef) is run by a guy whom would rather serve you something complicated like over spiced shrimp or shoestring fries over the more correct steak fries and charge you something crazy for it than give you good down home seafood, made the way seafood should be. \\n\\nSkip it guys!"},{"name":"Grass Fed","address":"605 Centre St","city":"Jamaica Plain","stars":"3","text":"Love this spot.

The hush puppies were good, although they tasted like they had sat around for awhile...more chewy than crunchy. Our main dishes were great, but could again be improved with a little less salt.

We waited about 10 minutes past our reservation time. Even though they knew it was a special occasion, we got a teeny tiny table in the middle of the room, backed up against a party of 8 or 10. If I had made a drinking game out of how many times the back of my chair got smacked by staff and diners, I wouldn't have been able to walk out of the place. When I asked the server how sweet the sangria was, he brought me a sample before I committed. It tasted like overly sweetened orange juice, so I opted for the \\"fresh\\" Malbec, which was very good. Between the two of us, we ordered 5 small plates. We were brought some uninterested bread with some nice dipping sauces. One was sort of garlicky, which went well with the bread. One was made with passion fruit and although delicious, it was better suited atop vanilla bean ice cream. The last was a jalape√±o mint concoction that was just odd. Of the five tapas plates, three were delicious - a ceviche, the chicken skewers, and the grilled asparagus with chimichurri. The other two, a chicken salad/potato stack and an avocado stuffed with crab, both tasted like uninspired deli salads. For dessert we received a complimentary dense chocolate cake with a candle in it. It was fantastic. I would have loved a second glass of wine, but our server seemed to have too many tables and didn't offer me another glass until our plates were cleared. I went ahead and ordered, but when it didn't come by the time dessert was presented, I told him to forget about it. \\n\\nIf you're comparing Andina to Mediterranean Trading Company, I'd say MTC has a slight edge on food and a big edge on service."},{"name":"Toast La Tea","address":"1037 NW 23rd Ave, Ste 100","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"I like this place because their decoration style, and their boba tea is really good!

Once the dumplings arrived, we knew we were in for a treat.\\n\\nThe dough on the outside is a little chewy with just the right amount of broth once you take that first bite.  It is recommended to put a little vinegar and soy sauce on the dumpling before consumption.  I savored each bite along with the broth flowing onto the spoon.

Lets start at the beginning.  My friend invited us out here as he was playing a show here (His music is the only reason this place got 1 star), after reading the yelp reviews our initial plan was to go to the BBQ place across the street and then catch drinks here until he was through with his set, but the first choice was packed so we thought, WTF, lets give it a shot.  Dissapointment ensued.\\n\\nAssuming all places are given the benefit of the doubt, this place started with 5 stars. First thing I noticed was the ambiguous decor.  What continent have these random things been brought from? You tell me Africa, I belive you. Let's do this. We arrived at 6:30, ordered at 6:40 from the waitress/bartended/hostess, not so packed yet, she was at that point friendly and managing the 5-6 tables fairly well.  I order the Mocha Africana (a black coffee and Kahlua with whipped cream, it seems Africa and the US not so different) and my BF orders a beer (that they, surprise, are out of), he orders a different one, drinks come out fairly promptly.\\n\\n7:30 Place has steadily filled up, appetizers FINALLY arrive to table.  I got the chicken wings (5 tiny overly crisp and heavily spiced (think cheeto fingers) wings garnished with a single half orange slice) and the BF gets his plantains (mushy but with good flavor, no garnish), these were delivered to table by (the owner?) who was trying to compensate for the overloaded waitress/hostess/bartender, when he leaned over our table he smelled like BO:  -1 star for slow and stinky service; -1 additional star for hyped up boring coffee drink and crap chicken wings. Now we're at 3 stars.  \\n\\n7:45; our friend is done with his first set, he and the BF go out to have a smoke and leave me at the table.  Waitress comes over to refil water glass and asks if I need another kahlua and coffee (I refuse to call it a Mocha Africana), I say no and she slams down my water glass in front of me and huffs away.  I'm beginning to wish that some comic relief (like the hobo with the jazz hands from someone elses Yelp Review) would come strolling through the door.  I make my way to the bathroom and discover that there is no soap.  As a nurse this perturbs me, I have cheeto fingers from the chicken wings and want clean hands.  Grrr. - 1 more star, I don't blame the waitress for being in a shitty mood, I've been a waitress too, If I was the only one at a packed restaurant I'd be pissy too, I do blame her for not keeping the soap stocked, it means she isn't washing her hands either.  Now we is down to 2 stars and this ship is sinking fast. \\n\\n8:05 Our entrees finally arrive. He got stirfried chicken I got the stirfried lamb.  Not too shabby, but also nothing special, I could have made this in my own kitchen.  I don't feel like I'm being romanced by the culinary wonders of Africa at this point.  Whatever, his set is over in an hour and a half, lets eat drink and be merry, \\n\\n8:30 Finally! Just what I needed!  A random drunk/tripping? dude bursts through the front door and screams \\"Oh Yeah! I'm totally feelin' It!!!\\" and Proceeds to start taking Panoramic pictures of the entire restaurant from the inside of the front door.  OMG, this is amazing.  \\n\\n8:40 Holy Creeper Batman!  Weirdest dude ever standing at bar staring at me hardcore, had to have the BF give him 'the look'.  Alas, no soap in the bathroom to clean the disgust off of me.  \\n\\n8:45 We have been trying to flag down the waitress for 10 minutes at this point, we want our check. We're going to go drink somewhere else for the next 45 minutes and catch our buddy after the show.  My BF walks credit card in hand to the bar and gets ignored for another 10 while she serves other people.  I see her see me see her see him, another 5 minutes waiting.  NO excuse for that slow ass service at this point.  -1 more star and half her tip. I might need that money for a co-pay to the MD from the rotavirus I may or may not get from her dirty bathroom fingers playing in our food.  \\n\\nService, slow and gross. Food, underwhemling and overpriced. Ambience, tacky. Bathroom, unhygenic. Smooth Jazz, nice on the ears.

But the cold brew is off the hook. Check them out."},{"name":"Blue Dahlia Bistro","address":"1115 E 11th St","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"This is my second visit to Blue Dahlia Bistro in 2 days.  I came because I needed a change of pace from my usual study haunts, and despite the fact that the wooden stool I've been sitting on for endless hours is far from the most comfortable study seating, there isn't much else to find wrong with this place.  It's clean, nicely appointed, the staff is very friendly (especially considering that not many other people seem to loiter here for the entire day), the coffee is good, and the food is also pretty tasty.\\n\\nToday, I had the soft boiled eggs and bread for breakfast, along with a fruit salad.  The eggs were well prepared, and the bread served with them was delicious.  I would've enjoyed another piece of the semolina baguette for handling the eggs.  The eggs also came with a small side salad, which while tasty, seemed out of place if I were taking this as more of a breakfast than a brunch.  The fruit salad was very good.  It had blueberries, a strawberry, cantaloupe, honeydew, and mango.  I don't think there was any sugar added, but the mango was nicely ripened and, with the honeydew, sweetened the salad nicely.\\n\\nFor lunch, I had the roast turkey tartine.  I have eaten a large quantity of turkey in he past month, so perhaps that skews my observations in two ways.  First, it makes my palate more discerning when it comes to turkey.  Second, it means I'm kind of sick of the stuff, so you need to bring some serious turkey A-game to please me.  The tartine was alright, but nothing to write about (unless you're writing on Yelp).  The turkey was your typical roasted stuff, of better quality than random-deli but not as delicious as the smoked or chipotle glazed stuff you can get sliced at Whole Foods.  The bread--a large slice of Blue Dahlia's whole wheat cut into wedges--was good, though I think the semolina baguette has a superior flavor.  The cranberry compote served with the turkey was spooned on to each slice in a small amount, but packed a fairly strong, almost spicy flavor.  I can't put my finger on what must've been in it.  It was tasty, though.\\n\\nI'm intrigued by this place.  I'll certainly be back to try some other breakfast items, and perhaps, when I'm less conscious of fat intake, get a little more decadent in my sandwich choices (ham and cheese with some butter slathered on the bread).  Also, the frittata selections look interesting, though I'm not sure since I've been here today that I've seen someone order one (though one of the frittata specials has since disappeared from the board)."},{"name":"LongHorn Steakhouse","address":"4809 W Highway 290","city":"Sunset Valley","stars":"3.5","text":"Very impressed with this new steakhouse.

Not that it could be considered undercooked, my friend just wanted it cook a little longer. The manager found out about this and he comped our entire meal.

In a soft opening phase, I decided to try this new location of this favorite. A 10% coupon popped up on Yelp. \\n\\nI ordered 2 rolls. California and tempera shrimp with out those awful cucumbers. They came with soup and salad as a lunch time special. Salad had a seseme dressing instead of the normal ginger I am use to getting. Tasted like peanuts but was delicious. Soup was not the normal Miso, but a chicken based broth with mushrooms and tempera flakes.\\n\\nSushi rolls came before I could even start the soup. I could have sat at the bar to watch them made and I might the next time I go. Best I have had in metro Columbus. Lower sodium soy sauce was also on the table which I have not seen at other places I tried and that is what I need to use. \\n\\nI took a star off because of those dreaded Pepsi products but added it back because of the excellent service.

My husband and I both opted for three courses for $38 (you can add a fourth course for $10), and left perfectly satisfied. Standouts from our meal were the ridiculously flavorful risotto with a \\"sunny side up\\" oyster (blanched and then seared on one side), squid broth, and a spicy house-made shrimp sausage; the wintry sweet potato agnolotti with a clever marshmallow cream that was counterbalanced by a hit of tangy lime brown butter; and the antelope, which by description did not appeal to me (liver-radish sofrito and turnip cake accompaniments....hrrmm...), but in reality was a wonderfully rich, comforting dish. Our desserts were good - the stout chocolate cake and the pound cake with a giant hunk of roquefort - but weren't as memorable.\\n\\nLenoir is an itty-bitty space that seats 32, including at the bar, so reservations are a must and you may have a short wait because it can be tough to predictably turn tables.

We recently visited this beautiful restaurant to celebrate an anniversary.  It was the place where we first met and we both thought it was fitting to return for a romantic dinner.  My first impression of this restaurant was A. it's worth the drive to W. Midtown and B. their patio set up rocks!  I was very pleased with the mussels appetizer during our first visit together and catching up over drinks by the tables near the bar is quite nice and a lot quieter than the main dining area.\\n\\nThe bar here is so nice and I look forward to returning and just sitting at the bar while snacking on appetizers and enjoying one another's company.  Dinner here was quite memorable. I had the grilled mahi entree and it was far better than I could've imagined. I rarely order fish entrees when dining out since I'm a major carnivore at heart but when I do, I have pretty high expectations.  My fish was perfectly cooked, flavorful and the portion size was great.  The boyfriend ordered the swordfish cooked in duck fat. \\"Duck fat\\" must make everything taste 10 times better because his swordfish just melted in your mouth!  Highly recommended. I was intrigued by the \\"Gentle Reminder\\" cocktail because it had watermelon listed as one of its ingredients. One sip later, I was eager to share with my man because the combination of the watermelon puree and whiskey plus other ingredients that I can't remember right now, made my drink savory and sweet.  Our dessert was the \\"hot dog bun\\" one with peach ice cream, blondie mini squares and toasted coconut flakes.  Who knew that toasted coconut flakes would taste so good with ice cream?! It was pretty fantastic to say the least and this is coming from a non-dessert person.\\n\\nService was fantastic so much so that I was very happy to leave her a nice tip.  The main dining area is very loud on a busy night but the food is so tasty that you don't really mind it much.  If you're bothered by such things, then I recommend asking for a table near the bar area.  Not sure how that area is on a Friday night but it has to be quieter than the main dining area. After dinner, we spent some time lounging on the patio which outlooks their valet service and entrance to the restaurant.  Between the comfy lawn furniture and hanging lights from the trees, it's the ideal romantic setting or relaxing ambiance when out with your friends.

After a well-below average experience my first time around, the manager personally reached out to me to apologize for the poor food and service and offered an opportunity to come give Townsman another try.\\n\\nThis time I brought along a couple of my friends and we all started out with drinks. All of our drinks throughout the night were very good, with my favorite being the one with peach and mint in it (the name escapes me).\\n\\nTo start off the meal, we started with a couple appetizers:\\n\\nMexican sweet corn (3 stars): This was the special of the night and was their take on Mexican sweet corn. While it was good, I did not feel like the toppings on the corn were very well distributed as most of them fell off and remained on the plate.\\n\\nDeviled eggs x2 (4 stars): We decided to get 2 orders of these since they came with 3 each and there were three of us. These were pretty good as the sauce they were served with went well with the texture of the egg.\\n\\nShishito peppers (4 stars): Pretty much what I expected--unfortunately didn't encounter any spicy ones in our batch, but a solid app nonetheless.\\n\\nFor the main course, my friend and I decided to split the hen and the lamb ribs.\\n\\nHen (3 stars): The star rating here does not reflect the flavor of the dish--the flavor of the hen is delicious! However, it does reflect how shockingly tiny the portion size is for a $26 dish, as it is basically one hen leg. The skin was crispy and the meat was tender--the sides that came with it were decent as well, but I just couldn't get over the measly portion size.\\n\\nLamb ribs (5 stars): This was definitely the best dish of the night. Though upon first glance, it looks like someone dropped the spice rack on it, the flavor was quite good with rosemary playing a major role. There was a bit a sinew, but the meat came right off the bone for the most part.\\n\\nFor dessert, we went with the blueberry cobbler (4 stars) which was served with ice cream. This dessert was a decent size and had some good flavor. I almost with that it had been a cheese cake because I felt a little cheated that it sort of had the texture of a pound cake. Despite this, it tasted good and was served with a good scoop of ice cream--not one of those mini scoops I'm so accustomed to from other restaurants.\\n\\nOverall, Townsman definitely stepped it up after some miscues from my first time there.

Before walking in I saw a promo poster of the Cheeseboy Gobbler that was being offered for a limited time, and at that moment \\"Thanksgiving in a sandwich\\" seemed both comforting and rather yummy. The Gobbler consisted of turkey, stuffing, cranberry sauce, baby spinach, and muenster cheese melted on multigrain bread. I have several thoughts about Cheeseboy. First being that I wish the eatery was much larger and could accommodate many more tables, such as a Panera Bread, Atlanta Bread, or Corner Bakery Caf√© does. Cheeseboy's menu is nowhere near as broad as those places that I mentioned, so perhaps that is why they keep the size of their location small...they are strictly a grilled cheese joint. There are just a few tables and the place was full when we first passed by, so we killed time and returned an hour later. Although there were some things I did dislike about my meal I would return to Cheeseboy if I had the chance. The sandwich had an impressive amount of muenster on it that truly satisfied the \\"cheese-whore\\" in me...and that pretty much happens NEVER! The multigrain bread was quite tasty and I enjoyed the turkey and stuffing, however I do wish that they didn't jip ya on the leafy greens. I like a plentiful amount of leaves on my sandwich, but that is an easy fix. What I really hated was the cranberry sauce. I have to admit that I did take a risk by deciding to give it a try, as I do not ever eat that jellied cranberry sauce that my family fittingly serves with Thanksgiving dinner every year, that comes out exactly in the shape of the can that it came in. I assume that this was basically the same sort of thing that was on my sandwich. I don't think I would be a huge fan either way but I think that it would have been much more sophisticated and tastier had they used something more heartier and dense, rather than low quality and jelly-like...perhaps a cranberry spread with pieces of real cranberry that could offer a slight bitterness and \\"bite\\" to the sandwich? I also tried the Traditional Tomato Soup and was pleasantly surprised that it was not drowned in salt like too many places fail by doing...but think it could have been even better if they altered it and gave it a kick of flavor by adding basil. An employee came by the tables and offered complimentary fresh baked chocolate chip cookies while I was eating...not sure if this is typical, but it was unexpected and nice. Another touch that I liked was that they gave out Andes chocolate mint candies with each customer's order. I only found one major problem while lunchin' at Cheeseboy; I was highly disappointed with the quality of the iced tea that I had. I eat out A LOT and am wise to the many chain eateries who purposely water down the beverage machines by either not putting the correct amount of syrup in the soda machines or by adding too much water to the canisters of iced tea. The iced tea could not lack any more in flavor, and was nearly reduced to a glass of water. I really hope that this was just a fluke, and not intentional. This was my most valid complaint that I had about my Cheeseboy experience. If I have the opportunity to patronize Cheeseboy again and have a hankering for a grilled cheese sandwich I would gladly go back. I thought this place was cheesy, but in a VERY good way!"},{"name":"Sun Tong Luck Asian Cuisine","address":"2500 Bethel Rd","city":"Columbus","stars":"4","text":"Only Chinese spot I go to in town!

Once our drinks came, we sat for too long until our order was taken. \\n\\nIt seemed like there was enough staff. At least 5 in the front of the house, so the delays seemed unnecessary.\\n\\nThe portions are smaller. I don't mind this. Many restaurants make up for mediocre food by giving you a lot of it. Too much food either means you're stuffed, or have to throw food away. \\n\\nUnfortunately, the quality of the food wasn't great. My wife's dish, with balsamic creme and blue cheese, looked unappetizingly gray. My omelette looked fine, but didn't excite me, flavor-wise. \\n\\nAfter we finished eating, more waiting. We sat with empty plates for a long time. When I was a server, we'd pull empty plates as soon as possible. Who wants to sit with a dirty plate?

I did not know until we came here, that the place has changed ownership and name. One thing that the place has not changed is the jade green chairs. Some might find this zen like, and some might find it an eye sore. Along with the chairs, they use light green table cloths. It's an odd comfortable feel due to the color, and the lights are really bright in here. The place is nice and clean, as this place is no dump.\\n\\nAs this is a vegetarian restaurant, there was going to be a heap load of soya based products. We ordered a couple plates, and we were stuffed. To go down the list, we started out with a small soya soup, that came out half green, and half white, like the ying-yang symbol. This soup was creamy, and the tofu bits that were in this thing tasted like ham. A little on the bland side, but it was hearty and filling. \\n\\nWe then proceeded with the crispy fried noodle with mixed vegetable and fried tofu blocks. The sauce they used was black bean, with some black beans still not broken up. This dish was really tasty, and the noodles came on a hot plate, so you heard the sizzle, and saw the steam.\\n\\nThe broccoli with tofu and imitation crab, almost made me think that the dish was the same compared to the dish at other restaurants, where they use a meat based sauce, and scallop strands.\\n\\nThe final dish, and by this time, we barely touched the other two, as we were really feeling full, was the cheese baked rice with imitation seafood. The vegan cheese was all melted on top of this baked delight. Each bite was just adding to our full stomachs. It was creamy and tasty as well.\\n\\nThe next time any of you go here, just watch out, as you might say you need meat to make you full. This place has filling food, and it can really sneak up. The food is tasty, and the fake meat dishes are made to taste like their real counterparts. The menu is in clear English and Chinese, and there is a good selection for your appetite."},{"name":"Townsman","address":"120 Kingston St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"We'll miss you Townsman.

Even in Taiwan, there are beef noodle restaurants that you'll never forget, either for good...... or for bad reasons.\\n\\nSince I live in Burnaby, I've eaten at Lao Shan Dong several times; I've tried a number of their dishes, but my focus is rating beef noodle soup in the Lower Mainland, so for the 4th time, I ordered their item number 1, basic beef flank noodle soup, not spicy.\\n\\nTo start this off, I have to compliment their speed; the soup arrived in about 2 minutes, including our other dishes; that's great.... right?  \\n\\nAs usual, I rate the beef noodle on its beef, broth, noodles and cabbage. The beef, even though it was fatty, was dry, really dry (C+); the broth was bland and forgettable (C); the cabbage was the highlight of this soup, but it was actually too sour, and I didn't even think that was possible (B+); the funny part of the whole thing is that apparently, the restaurant's name suggests that they make their own noodles; every time I've had Lao Shan Dong's soup, the noodles have tasted like they came right out of the box and were way overcooked; not chewy, not thick, just disappointing (C).\\n\\nOverall, the soup gets a C+, but for a restaurant that's been doing this for over 50 years in Asia, I'd expect a bit more."},{"name":"Element Bistro","address":"6315 Lookout Rd","city":"Boulder","stars":"3.5","text":"Went there for Happy Hour.

One small minor detail is that the patio was not level, so if you have mobility issues, it could be difficult to navigate; full disclosure, I almost fell into the garden! The back patio was well shaded and well cooled with fans, so perfectly okay for a hot Texas night.\\n\\nOur server was very attentive and swift, not to mention gorgeous. She looked like she'd stepped out of Botticelli's La Primavera. My date and I had already eaten at another place and were in the mood for some yummy dessert.

I wanted to pick up the plate of pears and lap up the sauce like a ravenous dog! I might have wet dreams about that sauce. And the flourless cake reminded me of a raspberry Godiva truffle. I don't know exactly what they put in the raspberry drizzle, but I wanted to pick up the piece of slate it is served on and lick up every drop.\\n\\nEvery little detail was paid attention to and you can tell that they care.

The fajitas were very tasty and were marinated with citrus juices and then cooked, no tomato was included or harmed here which is a great thing. The chips and salsa are good but not the best salsa ever, but good salsa is a very personal thing as many reviews attest. My wife had the cheese enchiladas which she liked very much and would order again and again.  Our daughter and I ordered the steak and chicken fajitas for two, which is a regular thing for us to get in mexican restaurants. The homemade flour tortillas were excellent. The steak and chicken was marinated perfectly and served with sauteed sweet onions and peppers on the cast iron skillet.

I went here two months ago in January and i still day dream of my meal to this day. The service was great and friendly and the history of the establishment is felt in every step of the building's cozy halls. I am from New York and this was my first trip to Boston so I wanted to experience a taste of what Boston is famous for. My gf and I sat down and were immediately given one of the best pieces of cornbread I've ever eaten. Then i ordered the New England clam chowder and it was out of this world! My mouth is salivating just thinking of this meal! The clams were large and tender the likes of which I've honestly never had before. For my entree I got the Lazyman's lobster casserole and it did not disappoint! It's essentially lobster in drawn butter topped with breadcrumbs, more lobster and more drawn butter topped with more bread crumbs and lightly baked. It's served with Rice or Red Potatoes. I got the potatoes. This dish hit all of my taste buds! The lobster was claw meat and it was so ridiculously tender it reminded me of the texture of a great filet mignon. When I bit into it a burst of buttery lobster burst into my mouth. I am rarely THIS impressed with any dish but like I said this was easily one of my 3 favorite meals.

The hard pistachio bubble sugar piece was the best part.)\\n\\nAside from the set menu, we tried the Tartar of Yellowfin Tuna. The avocado and tuna mixed well with the soy-based sauce. But it reminded me of something you'd have at a sushi joint - and it'd probably be done better. The Rasberry Martini was doing its job, apparent by the color of my roommate's face. According to my other roommate, the Sauvignon blanc paired well with the Salmon. Being the DD, I stuck with water.

Not sure the common lineage with Gibbet Hill is enough to overcome the shortcomings. \\n\\nFood: Offers a limited selection of upscale dished, mainly steak but there are multiple other choices.The clam chowder is decent, mostly broth, but was well seasoned and had good flavor. \\n\\nParty ordered burgers and steak and blue cheese sandwiches. The steak was served with cucumber salad and interesting but greasy fried chips. The steak was shaved and appeared more like pastrami, we were expecting sliced or whole steak, not D'Angelo's- style. It was not a good sandwich for a steakhouse. No one liked the bread. \\n\\nThe burger was average but not the quality one would expect from a steak house. Served with fries and the same cucumber salad, this was a below average entree. \\n\\nWe ordered two desserts, carrot cake and blueberry cheesecake, both were excellent but very small portions. Wine selection was extensive. \\n\\nAtmosphere: Elegant, dark decor. A long bar takes up the front section of the space. Wine bottles are displayed throughout the restaurant, common for modern wine-oriented establishments. There is both booth and table seating and several tables in the bar area. Everything has the restaurant name embossed on it. Time was taken to decorate and it shows. I'm just not sure the food matched the desired level of ambiance.\\n\\nThe bar offers a wide array of wines in an open a light area. Would be a very nice place meet friend to have a drink, sit and talk. Several large meeting rooms suitable for company meetings. A fireplace makes the bar area feel homey.\\n\\nService: Service was excellent, although this is difficult to measure as we were the ONLY people having lunch. Several people visited our table during the meal either to deliver something or just talk. The staff is well trained and amicable. Another big positive amongst several negatives.\\n\\nValue: Cost is high which some equate with fancy; think Capital Grill with worse food. The food is just ok, but it is fresh and well presented; the portions are small relative to cost. The atmosphere and service level are worth some up-charge. We paid $140 for lunch comprised of 4 sandwiches, 2 ice teas, 1 glass of wine, 2 cups of chowda and 2 desserts; you do the math for dinner.\\n\\nOverall, The Bancroft is an average place with fancy window dressing. The main attraction is location and d√©cor, not the food. The food wasn't bad, just not as upscale as the owners perceive. It may do well due to the location, but it's not a place that is going to attract mall goers or area families. \\n\\nUnderstand this place is going for an upscale, almost snobby ambiance. Because of its location, people will certainly give this place try. I feel the overall value will limit repeat business. With the number of choices in the area, this place will have to adapt to survive."},{"name":"Fizz Ed'z","address":"142 Pleasant St","city":"Malden","stars":"3","text":"My friends love coming here on Friday nights for some reason.

The doughnuts themselves aren't of the best or freshest quality and there's always guaranteed to be a line out the door since everyone that visits Portland somehow hears about Voodoo. Sure, there are some more unique shapes and decorations that you won't see in many places, but it's definitely not worth standing in line for. Of the different doughnuts, the cereal topped ones can be a bit stale depending on the time of day, so be warned. If you really want the Portland tourist experience or really like eccentrically  doughnuts, by all means go for it, but otherwise it's a better idea to skip Voodoo if you just have a craving for something sweet."},{"name":"Fresh To Order","address":"1260 Cumberland Mall","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Excellent  service.

This place seems to have a tendency of hiring waiters that are not attentive and are slow to bring out essentials. I basically had to beg my waiter several times to please bring me some lemons for my water because I don't enjoy straight tap water. My wife and I both ordered steaks. Hers a prime rib and mine a New York strip. We both always like our steaks cooked medium-rare like most people that enjoy steak do. Her steak came out rare and quite bloody and my steak was cooked nearly well-done. By this point I was very irritated and completely out of patience so I didn't end up eating much of my steak and we took my wife's steak home and finish cooking it ourselves. That may sound like a joke, but it is the God's honest truth. I was very unimpressed to see the waiter bullshitting with a patron at the bar instead of taking care of the very small handful of tables he had in his section. I'm giving it two stars instead of just one because the sides we ordered were absolutely delicious. We had spinach, mashed potatoes, and macaroni and cheese. I do not intend on returning to Longhorn Steakhouse nor would I recommend it to any of my friends.

So when I recently moved here and found out that there was a Santouka near where I lived, I was thrilled to try it. Especially on a cold East Coast winter, ramen is perfect. \\n\\nMy husband and I came here and there were 11 parties ahead of us, so we decided to kill some time and walk around. I liked the fact that this was linked up to Yelp and you can see how many parties are ahead of you. It was probably a 30 minute wait. \\n\\nIf you download the Belly app, you get a free order of Gyoza.\\n\\nI ordered the Shiayke Ikura Gohan Combo. I chose the Miso Ramen and it came with the salmon bowl. My huband ordered the Tsukemen Ramen (this is not offered in Los Angeles) and a side order of the Cha-Shu Gohan (pork belly rice bowl). \\n\\nSo, when I first took a bite of my ramen, I was happy because I hadn't eaten ramen since I moved over here and that's strange for me (considering I eat Ramen every other week). However, as I was making my way through the bowl, I realized that the broth was EXTREMELY SALTY and I was confused whether this was actually miso ramen or salt ramen (shio ramen). It got to a point where I just could not enjoy the ramen because it was OVERLY SALTY. This is saying something because I enjoy salt, maybe too much where it's bad for me. So for me to say something is salty, it is ridiculously salty. On top of that, the pork belly was underwhelming. At the Santouka's in Los Angeles, the pork belly was delicious! Extremely well balance of fat and meat and very tender. The pork belly here was tough and lacked any flavor and they are extremely stingy on the slices (2 slices). Honestly, it's more expensive than LA and we used to get 5 slices of high quality pork belly. \\n\\nThe salmon bowl was also whatever. The salmon was over cooked and dry. \\n\\nMy husband didn't care for his Tsukemen/pork bowl either.

I ordered medium well and what I was tasting was a well past well done. The steak had no flavor except the flavor of coal! I sent it back. The waiter and manager apologized and took it back no issues. Again I want to say the staff was excellent. I was brought a Caesar salad to eat while my second steak was cooking so that was a nice touch. Manager came about 15 later with the second steak and apologized for the whole thing. I was pretty impressed with the level of service. Started to cut into my second steak, it looked good to begin with; very flavorful first few bites. As I got to the thicker part of the steak I noticed the inside was completely raw. NOT COOKED AT ALL! It wasn't rare even because I'll eat rare. This was a still cold inside piece of meat and it was not eatable. I stopped right there and asked for the check. The waiter was nice enough not to charge me for the steak.

From my understanding they've changed ownerships a few times and I was told to expect a great experience. Well, those who gave me great opinions of the place, I have to say, were right!\\n\\nI went with the boy last Friday night for dinner (typical eating time for us 9:30- late by most standards). Might I add: sushi is usually at the top of our list for dinner options. \\n\\nI was immediately impressed with the decor; the last time I had visited it was bright, cold, with yellow walls and a slightly dingy feeling.  This time, with black curtains, low lighting, red walls... I have to say, the restaurant looks pretty sexy. And I LOVE going to sushi restaurants that don't feel the need to blast techno (who started that, anyway?) \\n\\nThe server was at the table with menus immediately, super friendly, and walked us through the entire menu (both drink & food). Pictures of the rolls? A plus in my book. Not only does it let me know how appetizing everything looks, but I find it's easier to get an idea of how large / odd a roll may be. Maybe that's just the little American girl in me... \\n\\nSince it was our first time at Sushi House, we decided to get two rolls and some nigiri. After much deliberation, one choice was the Wasabi roll - the wasabi sauce didn't have quite the bite I think we were hoping for - but the roll in itself was fresh, tasty, and gorgeously prepared. A second roll, the name of which has slipped my mind (even though it was my favorite) was a take on a spicy tuna roll and topped with a fresh slice of jalapeno. Spice is my thing- the more the better! I feel that the roll definitely lacked in the spice department, but again, the presentation and flavor combination were fantastic. \\n\\nFor pieces, we got our two usual: tuna and salmon, and I let the boy convince me into getting baby octopus (I had only previously had the \\"regular\\" octopus at other dining locations). The pieces were of decent size, again, fresh, and wonderful. While I could only (barely) swallow the baby octopus, due to it's bright red color and arms waving at me, the boy liked it a lot. I probably would have if it weren't for the supremely chewy texture... but the sesame flavor was decadent. \\n\\nSo, all in all - MUCH better than the previous time! We will most certainly be back!"},{"name":"Mary Mac's Tea Room","address":"224 Ponce De Leon Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Really good food. Insane waits.

The burger is thick and comes with their excellent fries. \\n\\nThe entrees and small plates are also quite good.  The poutine is based on the same delicious fries, and comes with perfectly tender short rib. It is fairly light on the gravy however, and uses cheeses that are not cheese curds.

They include thinly sliced cucumbers and spring mix into the bun, which added a fresh element to the sandwich - overall, it's not bad and surprisingly fills you up. The spicy umami miso ramen comes with a pork broth base, ground pork, bean sprouts, sliced green onion, bok choy and thicker noodles.

I'd heard of them before, a few years ago, in Philadelphia, and vaguely remembered them being OK.  I decided to give their Veggie Muffaletta a try (having never heard of a Muffaletta before).  I must say, I was pleasantly surprised: great bread, crispy, nice filling, not overloaded with cheese (as many American sandwiches are) or mushrooms.  Nice addition of the jalapenos (I think they call 'em \\"banana peppers\\".  I just call 'em jalapenos.  Sure TASTES like a jalapeno to me).  My only complaint was that the sandwich was a bit wet by the time I could finally get around to eating it (an hour or so later).  And it wasn't perspiration from the warm sandwich having been wrapped up for so long.  It was wet with what appeared to be too much olive oil.  Still, this did not take away from the crispiness of the bread in any way.  It was just a bit messy to the touch at first.  The sandwich was a really good size & delicious (if a bit expensive.  Nearly $8 for a take-away sandwich).

I came here wanting wings that were within walking distance of my home. I think next time I'll drive elsewhere when the craving arises.\\n\\nFirst off, it's summer time in Austin and as you know we hit the high 90s (or 100) immediately when that rolls around. Even at 7 pm temperatures stay around 86¬∞. When we walked into the restaurant and were seated around the corner by the open kitchen, it didn't take long for us to feel that this place was not well air conditioned. Even the waitresses were fanning themselves from how unusually warm it was for the inside of a restaurant.\\n\\nNow, imagine sitting in that heat for a good hour waiting for your food. My boyfriend ordered a vodka soda and I had the legendary margarita, both of which were fairly weak pours considering how drinks are made in local bars and restaurants across Austin. Our waitress (who shall remain anonymous, but was super nice and sweet), came back around to get our food order -- 10 smoked wings with a side of coleslaw and I had the combo of sliders. Now, you tell me, how long should it take to make those two items? I'd say that an hour is a ridiculous amount of time for prep, cooking, and presentation, right? She came by at least two or three times to apologize about the wait time and the second to last time had mentioned it would be only 10 more minutes. She was wrong. I'd say that was another 20 at the very least. \\n\\nKeep in mind the people around us. This place wasn't incredibly packed so you can't say the kitchen was slammed. There was a family of five to the left of us with two kids that all placed their order, received their food, ate, asked for to-go boxes and were able to pay and leave all within the time we waited. Then, there were two young men sitting two tables in front of us that had already been drinking their beers when we were sat down, placed their order, ate their burgers AND were later able to put in another order of food and eat it while we waited. Still no sign of our food at that point.\\n\\nThe best part was when we actually got the food. It looked fine to the naked eye, but when you put it in your mouth it was about the worst thing you could put in your body. My sliders did not come as the menu described -- they were missing the pickles and mustard on the burger, which was overcooked with the cheese bubbled and dry, and then pickles on the buffalo chicken patty were also missing. I had a bite of each and about three fries. My boyfriend ate one wing and threw it down and said, \\"Nope. We are not eating this.\\" Not to mention, we were told they were out of coleslaw when they brought out his wings. \\n\\nSo we had another waitress call ours back over, who clearly took an extra task to buy her time to mentally prepare for the barrage of complaints she was about to hear. In any case, she showed up, apologized profusely and offered to comp the food and said we'd be more than happy to take it, which my boyfriend immediately refused. Honestly, I wouldn't have even given that meal to a homeless person. Her solution to calm my boyfriend down was to charge us for the three drinks we did have in our sweltering, one hour wait in your fine dining establishment. I hope you all enjoyed your $20 donation. Keep up the good work."},{"name":"Folk Art Restaurant","address":"465 N Highland Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Another update!  I had lunch with my friend here today.  After having not eaten meat in about 18 years, about two weeks ago I made a decision to start eating some meat again.  I'm really only eating chicken at this point, but it has opened up a whole new world of options for me.  You really didn't need to know that, but people who read my reviews probably know that the only meat I have eaten is fish.\\n\\nToday I ordered a fried chicken sandwich with mac & cheese.  It was awesome.  My friend ordered the same thing and she loved it.  It appears that Folk Art has added some new vegetarian items for those who don't eat meat.  The chicken sandwich was topped with a collard slaw and it was delicious.  I am WAY picky about mac & cheese.  This was some of the best I've had in Atlanta, even though the pasta was a little overcooked.  \\n\\nMy only complaints are about the noise level and the bathrooms.  The music was so loud that my friend and I practically had to scream to talk to one another.  Please, Folk Art, TURN THE MUSIC DOWN!!  The bathroom I used was a nightmare.  There was no toilet on the toilet paper holders, but there was a roll of toilet paper on the floor and loose toilet paper and paper towels (the trash can was overflowing) on the floor.  I didn't try using the bathroom, since there was a sign on the door letting people know that the door knob wasn't working properly, so we needed to knock.  I knocked, but the noise level in the restaurant was overwhelmingly loud, so I couldn't tell if anyone was in the bathroom or not.  I wasn't about to use that bathroom and get caught with my pants down.\\n\\nAlso, we had to wait about 20 minutes for a seat, but there are benches outside the restaurant that are great for people watching.

A little lighter than my other favorite, with more complex flavors. And don't worry; it isn't healthy or anything. It just has a few brussels sprouts in it. It actually took me a while to try this one, because I thought it couldn't get any better than the Cha Cha Cha (and I was admittedly turned off by the idea of chicken broth). But as I write this review, I'm slurping down a bowl of this deliciousness, and I will never order anything else.

It's fantastic the next day!) \\n\\nFor appetizers, we luuurve their brussels sprouts tempura and takoyaki. \\n\\nI have never encountered the service issues other reviewers describe. Perhaps there was an adjustment period right when the joint opened, but I have always been blown away by the service and the food. \\n\\nAlso, if you go for dinner, be prepared to wait. There is always at least a 30 minute wait, even on weeknights. But they will give you a call when your table is ready, so you can pop over to the nearby pub and have a drink while you wait.

AMAZING lobster soup and the duck confit was equally incredible. The veal sirloin was sadly disappointing though the gnocchi that came with it was great.

Cr√®me br√ªl√©e was spot-on and the Black Forest cake nice as well, though pretty much on par. Waiter was so nice and attentive.

I actually ordered an extra tuna nigiri but then they gave me another one. They came over and apologized, and told me the extra nigiri is on the house. \\n\\nThe cut on the raw fish was really nice, and I felt that the ratio of fish to rice was perfect. The dynamite roll was delicious, and the ebi sunomono wasn't too vinegary! It was just right. The teriyaki chicken was a little lacking in taste because the sauce was too light, and the noodles were plain. But I think that's the way it should've been, so I guess I shouldn't complain! \\n\\nThe only thing that could've been better is if they came to fill my tea once more, or if they didn't talk in Korean about their customers. Mind you, they didn't say anything rude. But because I'm Korean and I can understand what they were saying, I couldn't help but to feel a bit self conscious when they were saying, \\"Do you think that extra nigiri will help us get recognized? Hehe.\\" \\n\\nBut I would like to come back and try their Chicken Karaage Bowl, which isn't something I usually see in a Japanese menu (I've seen Donburi but not a Karaage bowl!!)."},{"name":"Chipotle Mexican Grill","address":"915 SE 164th Ave, Ste 100","city":"Vancouver","stars":"3","text":"The food is awesome, but the service is incredibly slow.

My boyfriend and I started out over by PSU and traveled over to Pearl District, Old Town and Chinatown, then back again.

I acquired some decent shots along the way and I remembered reading Yelpers' reviews about a doughnut shop. That was our destination and we eventually found it. \\n\\nYes, Voodoo Doughnuts. I was surprised at the fact that it was only a small waiting area and a huge kitchen in back with no available seating. The line was long, reaffirming their popularity and tasty product. I got the doughnut for which the shop is named and there was something so sweet and satisfying about eating something so sinful in the shape of a person. The pretzel it came with was well used in my case. I had a blast stabbing its little icing heart and watching the raspberry goo spill out. The experience of eating a doughnut here is unique and entertaining. My guy even said longingly (before my little doughnut person was entirely consumed), \\"I have this strange urge to bite off his other arm.\\" To which I responded, \\"That's the first thing I went for!\\"\\n\\nIn all honesty though, these doughnuts are fun and delicious; an experience like no other I've had before.

Oh. so. bad.  We enter the joint (we being fierce yelper Scott B and I) the gaggle of the rest of the Yelp Posse was a few minutes behind.  Scotty and I had to pee in the worst way.  The kind of pee that makes you interrupt the conversation with the person you are speed walking with down Lansdowne, \\"Um, sorry but I gotta peee.\\"  And, you start speed walking even more.

I exited the bathroom seconds later and Scott was already heading towards our table.  They have 2 sketchy bathrooms and if you are as bathroom savvy as me, you will seek out alterative places.  No, I'm not talking about in a glass of sake, I'm talking about going next door to the hotel that is connected to Maluken.

Because I feel strongly that this was the same microphone that I got for Christmas in 1983.  Yellow foam tip and it felt dirrrty.  Not a good kind of dirrrty either.  Their acoustics were waaay off.  I started off as the first to karaoke.  This was fine with me.  But, there was zero notice.  The song started and I was sitting down awaiting to hear my name.  They don't announce you.  Basically you just wait until you hear your song or see the character writing on the wall (literally, the title will show up on the wall in characters).  I don't speak or read Japanese, so this makes for a very interesting time.  I could not hear my music or myself singing.  Maybe if we come back we'll bring our OWN mic.  \\n\\nWill we be back?

They call it char-broiled -- here the outside of the steak is charcoal burnt black, as a method to keep the inside juicy.  The problem of course is that every bite will have burnt charcoal taste to it.  It makes no sense to serve a $50 dry-aged ribeye this way for a host of obvious reasons they teach you in Culinary 101.\\n\\nWe were going to take pictures of the steaks and post them to Yelp as proof, but then we noticed that there are already many pictures of the burnt steaks posted to Yelp.  So I guess it is our fault for not closely scrutinizing the photos before deciding to eat here.  If you possess even the slightest inkling of being a connoisseur, I urge you to review all the posted yelp photos of steaks prior to deciding to dine here.\\n\\nIt would be one thing if they accidentally overcooked the steak.  One can forgive mistakes.  But the waiter insisted this was how they served them, intentionally.  And that it wasn't burnt.  The coal black outside was actually 'caramelization'! Ha!  And indeed, the plethora of photos of the steaks prepared this way proves his point - this is indeed their intentional method of preparation.\\n\\nI don't know what else to say about it.  Frankly, we're dumbfounded.  By the fact that management considers this a proper way to serve steak, and that there aren't a lot of one star reviews.\\n\\nAs for the rest of the meal, I don't think it matters when the signature product is prepared in inedible fashion.   But I will quickly comment on the rest.  It was all adequate.  Essentially deserving of three stars.  Lots of minor quibbles with too dry meats, preparations that don't match descriptions, recipes unique for uniqueness sake, elements missing from servings, etc.  \\n\\nHowever, I will add that the space is gorgeous.  The architect and designer did a great job.  The only complaint is our table was so underlit we might as well have been eating in the dark.  \\n\\nA nice touch is they provide spiced salts.  They get points for that.  Unfortunately, there's no point to salt a burnt piece of meat, unless you surgically remove the outside of the steak to get to the non-burnt interior.\\n\\nNevertheless, upon sitting down, perusing the decor, and reviewing the menu, we were so impressed and hopeful.  So I guess it hit us really hard when they served a charred black piece of meat and insisted it was deliberate.  \\n\\nUgh, can you guys go to Ruth's Chris steakhouse and learn how to properly cook a Ribeye?  Capital Grille does a pretty good job too.\\n\\nThere's no excuse for The Bancroft not to be one of the best restaurants in Boston.

It may not be for everybody, but I can get past the suggestive and naughty themes of some of their wares to judge their donuts on their own merits.  The true acid test, in my opinion, of any donut shop is to taste their raised, glazed variety.  Voodoo has this down pat!  Slightly firm and doughy, but very airy and soft at the same time.  The flavor is spot-on, and their size is definitely on the generous side.\\n\\nHow are their other varieties?  All of the raised varieties I've tasted, with rare exception, are excellent.  Voodoo is a VERY busy place, so they have a high turnaround, so you're almost guaranteed that what you're getting is EXTREMELY fresh.  Overall, Voodoo offers the best donuts I've had in Oregon.\\n\\nWhy only four stars, if their donuts are so good?  There are a few issues that detract from the perfect rating.\\n\\nFirst, they only take cash.  This requires a trip to my credit union if I want to avoid the high charge for use of their ATM.\\n\\nSecond, you may not be able to get in when you want.  On my second visit, they had a \\"private\\" wedding going on, so we were not allowed to go in.  This irritated me enough to almost not want to come back again.\\n\\nThird, you pay a BIG premium if you want to pick what donuts you get.  Seriously.  If you order a dozen (you can get a few different pricing tiers of dozens...ranging from about $13 for all cake donuts to $23 for a \\"signature\\" assortment), they pick all of the donuts.  You can get any variety you want, they just charge you per piece, and they're really overpriced.\\n\\nFourth, some of their donuts border on \\"ridiculous\\".  Any of them with oreo pieces, breakfast cereal, etc, results in the topping getting soggy from moisture encroachment from the frosting.\\n\\nOverall, Voodoo is an EXCELLENT donut shop.

The inclusion of olives alongside the bread was nice, though I did not think they were especially excellent olives.\\n\\nWe had the fusili amalfi, with both Fra Diavolo and white wine sauce.  The fusili itself (fresh) was excellent, with superb flavor and texture.  The seafood was also generous and well cooked.  Sauces:  The Diavolo was very good: an appropriate amount of heat, rich tomato flavor.  The white wine sauce, in contrast, was very mild in flavor.  Perhaps that allowed the pasta and seafood to shine through more; however, for me, it was really too little flavor.  Even when sopping it up with bread, which typically concentrates the flavor--there just wasn't much there.  Seemed like mostly a deglazing sauce from the pan where the scallops were seared.\\n\\nAfter dinner, the waitress offered us a complimentary round of limoncello.  Very kind of her, and really excellent limoncello.  \\n\\nAll in all, a very similar concept to Giacomo's.

That's fine...things happen. I then got a text saying they would provide us a bottle of champagne and would let us know when they would be opening. I never got a second text, but some of my friends who had reservations canceled did. So, I put the note about the champagne when I booked the new reservation, but I guess they didn't see it. No big deal. I wasn't expecting them to follow through.  The restaurant has a lot of potential. First impression walking in was a good one. Hostesses were very polite. The restaurant  still has a long ways from being considered \\"upscale\\". But I guess it depends on who is defining it. Once he gets the right people on his team it may have a chance. The security guys (James and King) looked more professional (and were very polite) than some of the managers.  I don't know if one of the managers (I think they said his name was Charles) was on duty or not, but I've never seen a manager walking around with  what appeared to be a drink in his hand and a baseball hat on...not in a place like this. But maybe he wasn't on duty. Keith, who we thought was a manger walked around to every table but ours, so we stopped him because we thought maybe he was a manager and wanted to know how to provide feedback. A lot of times when restaurants first open, they stop by tables and ask for people's feedback. When we asked him what his title was he said \\"I make things happen\\". Really?! Ok. Thanks for that heads up. But what is your title?  The rooftop might have better luck--it's really nice up there. Bottle prices are reasonable too. Looks like they put all efforts into the first floor (except for the A/C because it felt like it was out which I'm guess why they had fans on) and forgot about the 2nd level. There are so many missed branding opportunities...especially on the 2nd floor. Take the logo and put in on some of the bare walls, or even the scratched up wood floors. Cover the small hole in the ceiling (unless it serves a purpose for something), hide the utility box or whatever that is on the wall next to the glass doors. Maybe even put some big vases or plants where those wood spaces are between the booths upstairs. Might have been nice to carry the look of the first floor up, but maybe that is coming. It just seems unfinished and very dark. And was very crowded with 8 people squeezed into a booth.  I'll definitely go back for drinks on the rooftop and see if it's a different experience. I'll wait a few months to try the restaurant part again. The food wasn't bad, mine was actually a good version of shrimp and grits (I love the presentation)--but wasn't any different than any other shrimp and grits around town. I didn't get a Walmart bag thank goodness, but I did get a plastic bag at first. I think our waitress saw my surprised look and then came back with a paper take out bag. Again, just a plain bag---another missed branding opportunity.  Not that it will make the restaurant any better, but it would be nicer.  Even Chipotle has their logo on their bags. James (who wasn't even our server) was great. He was very attentive to our table when bussing our tables. He checked on us more than the waitress. You want to support your own and want them to succeed but in Atlanta the restaurant business seems like you need to bring your \\"A-Game\\" on day 1...and for me, it just isn't there yet. Oh yeah, Evan was very nice and polite too. He showed us up to the rooftop and told us to come back and give it a second chance. Parking was pretty cool. $20 for valet--ummmm, we are not celebrities. That's crazy! But they do have the self-park option right around the corner in the same garage. Overall, the ambiance is nice and everyone should go and form their own opinion.

Certainly not thin as a couple of reviews have stated, but then, it gets made every day and is going to be a bit different every day.  I had the fried seafood platter, and they gladly subbed a couple of shrimp for the oysters (don't like oysters).  My buddy had the broiled platter.  Wow, what a difference in portions.  Mine was very generous, his much smaller, for about the same price.  And the prices are kind of high, but then you are in the historic district in Boston, not on a pier in Destin eating out of a plastic basket (which frankly I prefer...)

There is some confusion on the advisor and discount coupon web sites, indicating that Cajun Pizza is closed instead of redirecting customers to the new nearby location. \\nThe space is clean, includes plenty of seating (either booth or loose tables (which can be combined for larger parties)), a small bar, a smattering of flat screens and a pizza kitchen is open to the dining space.  Seems to cater to a family and/or sports dining experience with Zydeco music to boot.\\nThe wait staff is very attentive and makes sure your orders and requests are processed.  Each time we have dined, the time to process an order has been reduced, but the kitchen still produces the same pizza quality.  Also, the dining room has usually been half full, I assume the same service level is maintained with larger crowds.\\nAnd yes, If you like a good deal or need an incentive to try the restaurant, Groupon and Entertainment coupons are available YAY!"},{"name":"Holy Taco","address":"345 1st St","city":"Lake Oswego","stars":"3.5","text":"Loved eating here!

Sweet and Sour Pork? However, I was assured by my dining companions (and some small disclaimers on the menu) that everything was prepared with meat substitutes. I ordered the House Chicken, and was presented with a plate of stir fried, vaguely-chicken looking strips and vegetables in black bean sauce.\\n\\nOne bite, and HOLY COW. This restaurant is not just an example of the chef's prowess; it is a testament to food science! The veggie chicken I had was IDENTICAL to the real thing. As an omnivore, I should know, and it blew my mind. The menu also features veggie beef, pork, even seafood. Imagine this: little veggie shrimp, complete with pink backs and dangling veggie legs. I kid you not. I had one from a neighbor's plate, and while it was a bit watery and would be sub-par at a seafood restaurant, the shrimp flavor and texture was unmistakable. Creeeeepy. Not everything was flawless; the Cashew Chicken was a disappointment, as the flat sheets of veggie chicken used in this dish were basically flavorless.\\n\\nThe preparations are classic Chinese-American. In addition to meat substitutes, they also do tofu numerous ways, and feature beans in some dishes. White or brown rice is available. The atmosphere is nothing exciting; it's a former Pizza Hut, whitewashed. Prices on the moderate side; $10-12 for most entrees. Still.

It's the corner pylon of a parking garage. It reminds me of something you'd see in Europe or older city like New York or Chicago. It's tiny, cramped and full of charm. I don't see why it seems to be a revolving door for new food ventures.  In all the years I've worked downtown, the place must have changed hands 7 or 8 times.  It's been coffee shop (twice), a Caf√©, a Mediterranean take out and now a pie and pastry shop. Most of them have had decent food and service but didn't last. I'm beginning to wonder if the location is cursed.\\n\\nAnyway, enough reminiscing, the current incarnation is Lauretta Jean's pies and goodies. I popped in for a quick lunch thinking it was still the caf√©.  I was pleasantly surprised to see a variety of pie and quiche instead of the caf√© fare.  I scanned the options for something vegetarian and settle on kale and basil quiche. It was $7 for a slice and a side salad, perfect for a light lunch. I grab it and go.\\n\\nYou can tell when an artisan does a job. It's done at a level far beyond utility.  This quiche was done by an expert. The crust was golden and flaky, perfectly crumbled.  The filling was light and fluffy, the kale and basil cut to the exact right size so they don't chunk up the filling or disappear into it.  The salad was damn good too, mesclun dressed with a tangy mustardy vinaigrette.\\n\\nI've gone back a couple of time to get coffee and just stand there while they take the pies out of the oven. The smell is intoxicating. It reminds me of grandma's kitchen at Thanksgiving, spicy, warm and inviting.  I'm sure they think I'm a little weird standing there with a blissed out smile on my face.  I really hope this place can overcome the curse and stick around for a while.

Got there around 10pm and waited in line for a seat. The hostess took our name and cell # and said they would text when our table was ready. We went up to the 4th floor bar to wait and have drinks. The first incident was when we ordered drinks the bartender forgot we ordered. We sat while he served everyone else. It then hit him that he forgot and finally served our drinks, which were good. We continued to wait for our table while watching food continue to come out of the kitchen to other tables. After an hour and a half passed we thought it was best to go check on our table. So the second issue was We go to close our tab and the bartender takes the credit card and POCKETS it! He then leaves from behind the bar and comes back with a cutting board and limes and begins cutting. We then have to ask him to run the card. He takes it out his pocket and runs it finally. Last but most upsetting issue was We go to check on our table and was told the kitchen was CLOSED!! No one decided to contact us about this knowing they had our cell #. Then there was no real reason given for the closing of the kitchen. While this is being said food is still coming out the kitchen. After asking for the manager it took him a very long time to come only to not be a help at all. He did not take accountability at all.

We went on a Saturday night, so we had about an hour wait until we were able to be seated. It wasn't terrible because we snagged a little tableout front, had a waitress bring us some frosty beverages and there is plenty of great people watching to do while waiting. The heat was almost unbearable, and the sweat that was accumulating down my back was down right gross. But right when I was at my breaking point, our name was called and we ventured inside to gouge ourselves on pizza.\\n\\n\\nWe ordered:\\n\\n#2- White pie with spinach (olive oil, garlic, mozzarella, ricotta, provolone and romano\\n#4- Spinach, roasted red pepper, green olives and onions\\n#6- Sausage, ricotta cheese, and roasted red pepper\\n\\nI had already decided that I would sample all pizza's, which meant I would have to unbutton my top button on my pants to make room for all of the pizza that was about to be in ma belly. I started off with a slice of the #4 pizza, and really liked the flavors. The green olives gave a nice salty bite to the pizza and worked well with the other veggies and cheese. Next I moved on to the #2 White Pie pizza. Looking at the pizza I thought, this is going to be a fantastic cheesy experience. But I was disappointed, it lacked flavor. I think the ricotta was overpowering to the rest of the flavors, with the large globs on the pizza. Maybe it wouldn't have been so bad if they were smaller globs? Or maybe I'm just not a fan of ricotta? I eyeballed the last pizza and all of the ricotta cheese debating on if I really wanted to try it or not. The other obstacle is that i don't care for sausage. I decided to give it a go just to see if I liked it. I didn't mind the ricotta as much on this pizza as the white pizza, and maybe it was because the toppings on this pizza had stronger flavors\\n\\nOverall I thought Homeslice was a good pizza joint, and one of the better ones in Austin, but I can't say that it would compete with back east pizza. I thought the crust was to thick and seemed to be missing some magic spice that NY pizza's have.

He is, however, now a devotee. We sampled the Original Pepperoni and the Cadillac. The pepperoni looks like a cheese pizza at first glance because they tuck the pepperoni under the cheese to avoid burning it. So thoughtful! The Cadillac has all sorts of foodie goodness on it with prosciutto, fig preserves, gorgonzola, and balsamic reduction. It is yummy. After a few bites, I did decide that I might actually prefer the Cadillac sliced into eighths and served as an appetizer among friends because it is otherwise a pretty strong flavor profile to make your sole meal.\\n\\nOverall, Via 313 is a great addition to the pantheon of Austin pizza purveyors.

It was also quite uncomfortable to stand in line (cafeteria-style waiting to order) for 20 minutes while carrying shopping bags and bundled up in winter coats. \\n\\nSince you aren't allowed to save tables, there was no way for us to just drop our load while we stood in line. While I do understand the logic behind this long-standing policy against saving tables, it is nonetheless irritating. The line gets even squishier when you have people trying to get in/out of the bathrooms which are located in the corner by the kitchen entrance, which also needs to be accessed by the waitstaff and their trundles of dirty dishes. \\n\\nThe boyfriend has a low threshold for patience when it comes to crowded conditions, and he was pretty much on the verge of rage when we finally sat down with our meals. Since the tables are wedged so close together, you are constantly aware of people passing plates of food over your head and trying to squeeze by your chair. It just can't be helped, and you can only hope that no one spills a hot bowl of soup in your lap. This is not the type of establishment you want to patronize if you are interested in a leisurely and relaxed brunch. \\n\\nAs for our meals, they were unremarkable. I had the waffle with fruit and it wasn't much improved by the fake maple syrup. The boy had a fried chicken sandwich that was decent, but the sweet potato fries tasted stale and oddly chewy. However, it probably is the cheapest brunch/lunch option if you are in Beacon Hill, and the waitstaff is rather helpful.

If you ask me, it's all at least $0.50-0.75 too high, but that's just me, and maybe that's the Congress St. mark-up.  \\n\\nThe Margherita was excellent, plenty of basil and very tasty.  The pepperoni was pretty good - nothing special.  It's a NY style pizza, crusts are thin and crispy to the bite, then chewy, and it's one of the better tasting pizzas I've had.  It's not the best buy - especially since I recently paid $1.50 for a Margarita slice at Pie Guys,  but if I had to do a comparison btwn the two Marges I'd say that Home Slice wins by a slim margin on taste, but Pie Guys wins w/ overall value and bang for the buck.\\n\\nSo if you think the prices here are just fine, then you'll really enjoy this place because the pizza is very good.  If I'm in the area and craving a slice of pizza, then I may stop by for that Margherita because it really is a tasty piece of pie."},{"name":"600 Degrees Pizza","address":"898 Oak St, Ste A","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4.5","text":"We went for lunch on 2 different occasions and I have to say that I enjoyed the pizza and the customer service was great.

We also kept running into people we knew. Ah, downtown Austin.\\n\\nWe settled upon a large pizza with onions, mushrooms, and green olives, with half artichoke hearts and half jalape√±os. My friend who took me to Home Slice was right - their crust is delicious. Thin, crispy, and vegan. Win.\\n\\nHome Slice doesn't have vegan cheese (yet), so the pizza was a tad dry for my taste. I suppose we could've paid more to pile on more veggies, but I generally like my pizza with vegan cheese, or at least with vegan pesto, or, failing that, slathered in olive oil. It needs to be crunchy and greasy. However, this pizza was good, cheese or no, and I will definitely go there again, although probably not on a crowded Saturday night. The diverse customer base was nice - and rather unexpected for, again, South Congress on a Saturday night - but, unfortunately, our patio time was somewhat compromised by the shrieks of three toddlers, egged on by their smitten parents, who were loud enough to kill a bat. Considering the place is hot, crowded, and dimly lit like Lucifer's parlor (what's up with that, Austin? this seems to be a pizza joint necessity), it doesn't really lend itself to small children. Then again, neither do late night shoot 'em up movies... but that's a whole other rant.\\n\\nI would also consider ordering a pizza and picking it up, then adding my own Teese or FYH or homemade pesto. Overall, despite the lack of vegan cheese, I'd still say this is the best vegan pizza I've had in Austin so far (aside from the raw pizza at Whole Foods, which, strangely, was the most pizza-y thing I've tasted since going vegan nearly two years ago)."},{"name":"Chipotle Mexican Grill","address":"2973 Cobb Pkwy SE, Ste B","city":"Atlanta","stars":"2","text":"I've been coming to this Chipotle for the last few days since I've been trying to eat healthier. I've noticed a consistent pattern of organized chaos with the people that work here. I always come after the lunch rush to avoid the true insanity that seems to exist at every Chipotle at lunch time. This way you avoid the office orders for 10 by the person just in front of you when you've built up such anticipation and hunger from standing in line 30 minutes. lol Today it wasn't so bad, I just got behind the woman that decided she wanted all of her toppings individually placed in cups so nothing touched her food. O_o I have to give credit to the girl that helped her for not having an attitude.\\n\\nMy first major issue was I ordered a salad bowl with chicken and barbacoa knowing I'd be charged more. When the guy went to put the chicken in there was barely half a spoon of chicken left in the container, he asked about more but it was going to be a little while. Why are you running completely out of meat and it's still a steady flow of customers coming in? Anyway, He proceeded to place barbacoa on top and my bowl moved to the next person. While the person was adding my toppings, there was a girl that kept reaching over my bowl to take or add things to the line, she literally put her armpit over my bowl at least 3 times, not her arm, her armpit and would apologize each time. She reached 4 times total over my bowl. That's not sanitary. When my bowl was passed to the cashier, I was charged for double meat. For not even half a spoonful of meat? \\"It was a full serving.\\" Ok, whatever, I only eat at Chipotle like once a week, I don't know what a serving looks like. But I do know what an empty container when you've run out of chicken looks like! I paid it, but I decided to write a review and that next time I will ask to speak to a manager.

Parking was easy at 5. \\n\\nWe were seated about 5:10. I didn't get bent out of shape about that, I could see that they were busy as hell. Honestly, if the restaurant is GOOD, I mean really GOOD, what is another ten minutes except a way to build up anticipation. \\n\\nLibby was our server. She was great. Husband found a spot of strange green slime on his glass and she took it  very seriously, whisking it away to get him a new one, and studying the new glass before she gave it to him.

I'm glad he did, I needed room for food. \\n\\nWe chose to go with 6 small plates. We had skipped lunch because of our plan for dinner. So we were ready.\\n\\nOur bread arrived and it was yummy, as were the trio of pretty colored dipping sauces. As mentioned by others, a deeply flavored peanutty sauce, a green chili sauce, and a mango chile sauce. All wonderful. They regularly refilled our bread and our dipping sauces, as well as our water glasses. \\n\\nWe ordered: (small plates run $10 each). \\n\\nYuca rellena: a yuca croquette with gooey cheese inside, deep fried. YUM. Honest. Yuca reminds me of parsnips, starchy and sweet. \\n  \\nPimiento Piquillo Relleno: a red pepper stuffed with quinoa and ham and finely diced veggies, which sounds uninteresting, but it was my favorite thing all night. \\n\\nAnticucho de pollo: chicken skewers, three with two pieces of chicken each, with a lovely dipping sauce/salsa, chunky and flavorful. Sounds boring. Wasn't. \\n\\nConchas ala parmesana: bay scallops with baked parmesan on top. Sweet and juicy, the parmesan was in one crusty hard piece and not quite brown enough, not our favorite thing, but still tasty. As hubby pointed out, a little bit off at Andina is three times better than good anywhere else. \\n\\nWantanes de mariscos: seafood wonton with a plum sauce. Good. Sauce very good. \\n\\nA Causa, Mixta Nikkei: a layered confection of crab and tuna salad, potato, and a breaded prawn on top. Avocado slices next to it. Cold. Odd but delicious. \\n\\nEven though we were full, we managed to get in coffee ( Stumptown) which arrived in the world's most adorable pots, a couple of truffles ( the anise rocked, the mango was good but not as good as the anise), and shared a dessert special. It was a cinnamon cake with a  homemade caramel/espresso ice cream. It had apple compote with raisins on top of the cake.

It was a little hard to find as it seems like the entrance is in what appears to be the back.  I assume that the entrance used to be a loading dock for whatever the space was before it became Two Urban Licks.  Whatever it was, it adds to the charm of the place.  I would describe the design as urban industrial trendy.  The setting is a wide open space (aside from the kitchen in the middle) surrounded by concrete, metal, and a really tall ceiling.  It was a sunny day so the sliding garage doors were up letting in light from outside and providing a view of the Eastside Beltline Trail.  The inside of the place is dimly lit so it's a nice place for dinner.  Gas candles line the wall, all the way up to the ceiling.  They don't really provide light but are a great touch to the decor of the place.  The central kitchen enclosed in glass is also a nice touch.  \\n\\nI started with a cocktail.  I don't remember the name but it was a kind of punch; the only punch on the cocktail menu.  That drink was one of those silent creepers.  The first glass of the punch refreshes you and seems to pass through your system undetected by your bodies alcohol absorption mechanisms despite the fact that it has THREE different alcohols in it.  In the second glass, the 3 amigos begin to make their presence known by tapping you on the shoulder so that you at least take note that they are in the building.  I had to drive so I didn't even want to know what would happen after the third glass of that punch.  Maybe next time I'll summon a Lyft.\\n\\nThe food was really good.  My friend told me about the salmon chips so I decided to start there since I was too hungry to try and look through the rest of the options and decide on something else.  I envisioned something different but it was literally a well-seasoned salmon mashed to the consistency of tuna salad on a large freshly made potato chip.  There were other seasonings in the dish I'm sure but my point is that it looked really simple to make, but a pretty satisfying dish as an appetizer.  \\n\\nMy entree was the beef brisket and mac 'n' cheese.  The brisket was nice and tender with a great rub on top but unfortunately I like to cut away the fat layer that sometimes comes on the top of the brisket and thats where the rub seasoning is.  Never fear though! There is a really nice BBQ sauce that comes with it to add some flavor to nice smoke flavor of the meat.  The sauce is moderately thick with a little sweet balanced out with the right amount of tang.  The MnC was the kind that you bake in the dish/bowl so that it gets that nice, thin, cheesy crust layer on top and then below it is a lightly saucy, kind of stringy goodness.  It reminded me of one of my favorite mac 'n' cheeses ever in life from Levende Lounge (now closed) in Oakland, CA, ...but Levende would put a small amount of bacon bits in their mac 'n' cheese to give it a smokey flavor.  \\n\\nAll I know is that I'll be back to this place.

The dough itself was light and when it mixed together with the creamy maple sugar and crispy salty bacon inside my mouth, it was sheer heaven!  I didn't want the experience to end.  I contemplated buying more, but I knew that I couldn't do that to my thighs or to my arteries. \\n\\nWould I do it again if I was in Portland?  Absolutely.  Normally I don't like waiting in long lines for anything (i.e., Ike's - I will never wait 40 minutes for a sandwich ever again), but 20 minutes with good company and for something so delicious as a maple sugar bacon donut?  \\"Yes, please.\\""},{"name":"Voodoo Doughnut - Old Town","address":"22 SW 3rd Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"Two stars for creativity and variety.

Ye Olde Union Oyster House was established in 1826 and is apparently home to the toothpick.  Not reliant on these often trashy looking teeth cleaning devices, I went there for the fare.  \\nMy cousin ordered the Seafood Bouillabaisse.  A huge bowl of aromatic seafood broth packed high with mussels, lobster and fish, this dish was the star of the table.  Super fresh and perfectly cooked seafood soaking in a flavorful broth-how could it not be delicious?  \\n   True to his seafood ordering reputation, my brother ordered their fried seafood platter.  Clams, fish, shrimp, oysters and onion rings were golden brown in a wonderful light batter.  I can't believe I'm saying this but malt vinegar wasn't even necessary.  \\n   I had the thick, creamy and chunky clam chowder as a starter to my crabmeat stuffed haddock.  The haddock was beautifully broiled and the crabmeat stuffing was pleasingly more crab than carb.

We were greeted by some of the friendliest customer service that we've ever encountered, and were pleased to see a very clean, well-kept restaurant.\\n\\nThere were so many tempting offerings that it was hard to choose just one.  For me it was the Pep and Chee, for the wife is was the crunchy BBQ Bacon.  We each had the creamy basil tomato soup  Both were AMAZING and arrived quickly and piping hot!  The soup was admittedly a tad bland, but it was quite delicious, and a terrific complement to the unctuousness of the sandwiches.  We were tempted at first to get a grilled cheese donut to go, but by the time we were finished with our meals, we were both quite satisfied and full, and decided that it would have to wait for another time.\\n\\nAll in all, this was a very pleasant experience for the both of us.  We were happy to see a restaurant focus on a narrow concept and try to compete with other things than quantity of offerings.

For dinner I got the T-bone steak cooked medium, as well as the smoked salt that comes complementary. Steak was perfectly cooked and the smoke salt was a great addition. the mrs. got the skirt steak with charred avocado on the bed of grits. I tried a couple of pieces and thought it was excellent.

For dessert I got the cookie cheesecake and she got a lemon cheesecake or something like that. She said hers was average. Being 9 months pregnant she will eat anything. I'm not a big dessert guy but I thought their cheesecake was right up there with the Cheesecake Factory if not better. Service was exceptional.

But if you are vegan, vegetarian, or just want meat-less food, this is a great place to check out.

The 3 course $24 prix fixe is definitely worth it because you can basically get a small plate or a dessert for free.  The sweet potato gnocchi was my favorite small plate (I tried all of them except the raw wrap).\\n\\nWhat got me the most about the menu was the Vegetable Wellington.  During my meat eating days, having Beef Wellington was a rare treat.  It is a perfectly cooked beef tenderloin in a puff pastry with an au jus sauce.  Seeing Vegetable Wellington on the menu was too intriguing not to pass up.  I must say I was very impressed, the filling was very tasty and cooked to perfection.  Perfect blend with the pastry and not too sweet at all. \\n\\nLeaf offers a variety of dishes that are bound to satisfy any palette.

For the whole meal, we ordered a Shore Dinner (lobster broiled and with steamers instead of mussels), the Sauteed Seafood Medley, Broiled Seafood Platter, and the Sauteed Shrimp and Scallops. I think the most popular dish was the Shore Dinner and Sauteed Shrimp and Scallops.\\n\\nMy favorite was the Sauteed Shrimp and Scallops. The sundried tomato cream sauce was perfect on top of the rice. Nothing was too creamy or thick. The Sauteed Seafood Medley tasted more like a pasta dish because of the noodles and marinara sauce.

Well, that second time was last night, so here goes!\\n\\nI'm really glad to have this place right down the road from me, but I find myself just wanting more. More flavor, more originality, more parking....\\n\\nFirst, I ordered the fried pickles both time. This repetition should be a good sign. They're good! They are made with sweet pickles and battered in what seems like corn meal, served with some sort of sauce that I liked. The sweet pickle is a unique touch to this classic and I approve!\\n\\nThe first time I ordered a single beef patty Grindhouse style: American cheese, grilled onions, lettuce, pickles, and grindhouse sauce. I didn't really taste grindhouse sauce, the lettuce was pretty sad, and overall it just seemed fatty and juicy, but not flavorful (how is that possible?). \\n\\nSecond time I had a double beef patty Apache style (thank you, Creative Loafing): pepper jack cheese, grilled onions, and roasted new mexico green chiles. This tasted a lot better, but still didn't have the kick of flavor I was expecting given the list of ingredients. However, I definitely left satisfied after both burgers, so it wasn't all bad. I just think there's so much potential for big flavors here that's not being harnessed. \\n\\nFries are like others have said: kind of sad and seem straight out of the brown sysco bag. I enjoyed the onion rings, though! Same batter as the fried pickles, and came with a tasty dipping sauce. \\n\\nService still weirds me out some - it's counter service before 4pm and waiter service after? I think? I will only rate the service at my second experience since I don't think it would be fair to criticize their servers in training on the third day of business. Last night our waiter was really nice and really helpful, so no complaints there!\\n\\nLike some others have said, the parking lot is small and weird. If you go in off the side street, watch out for the bottom of your car. I ended up parking on that side street last night. \\n\\nI was surprised they didn't have more beers on tap, but the sweetwater 420s I had really hit the spot.

The bakery can get busy, usually with nearby Tech students catching up with friends or studying. I like the vibe and the last time we were here, we met friends with their little guy. It was our first time meeting him, so that was super cool. Anyway, we had just been at Am√©lie's a few days before and remembered how good it was.\\n\\nI've had the caf√© au lait, which is quite tasty. AT and I have had multiple hand-crafted sodas and limeades/lemonades. We always find the citrus drinks to be too tart (even he does and he LOVES sour stuff) but this last time, I just went up and asked for 2 pumps of simple syrup, which was kindly accommodated. If you have a similar palate, don't be shy about asking for a sweetness adjustment. It made all the difference for us.\\n\\nWe love the soups and sandwiches. The soups and sides change but I think the sandwiches are regular menu items. Between the two of us, we've had the Roast Beef & Manchego, P√¢t√© de Champagne, Croque Monsieur, Turkey and Bacon, and Turkey and Brie. All were fantastic. This last time I tried the potato and green bean salad, which was the perfect accompaniment to my Turkey and Bacon.\\n\\nI agree with other reviewers that the tartines are tiny. We tried the Ham & Gruy√©re and while good, it wasn't worth it. On the flip side, what is REALLY worth it is the pain perdu. We got this a few days ago. The variety of the day was bacon with thyme. I can't remember the cheese, to be truthful. But the savory bread pudding was fantastic. Wonderfully tasty and the portion was gigantic. I seriously couldn't believe how big it was, especially considering it was less than $5. This is not to be missed.\\n\\nPastries and sweets are sort of a hit-or-miss. I am sort of a macaron snob and don't really like the ones on offer at Am√©lie's. They're not horrible, but they're far from great. I have gotten the pistachio one a few times and I think I may finally give up. The filling is delicious but the biscuit itself is tough and overly chewy. Anyway, financiers are pretty good, apple turnover is tasty (but has a liberal cinnamon covering, which AT hates and claims is not truly French, as French people don't eat tons of cinnamon), plain butter croissant is phenomenal, almond croissant is yummy, fruit tarts are very well-done, and the slice of orange (I think?) cake I just had was meh. So you see... It's all over the place.\\n\\nThat doesn't mean I won't come back. I certainly will. And who knows what the future may bring.

They are supposed to have lower prices than a brick and mortar because of low overhead, but I think in this case, they are paying higher rent/ charging more because of the building.

For our main course she had lobster as usual. 2 pounds with crab meat stuffing and some asparagus. I did not try but per her it was really well prepared and mouth watering.

Yesterday, I went to Ganko for the first time and I was reasonably impressed.  I ordered the miso ramen with no extras -- next time, I will try their spicy miso ramen.  Egg was cooked just right with a pleasantly runny yolk.  Noodles were the right texture and thickness -- nothing out of the ordinary, but good.  A pleasant sprinkling of sesame seeds, some crunch from the bean sprouts, and a bit of cabbage.  The pork slices were fine -- nothing special there.  The broth, however, was quite good. At first taste, it's not knock you socks off special, but its flavor profile was enough to keep me coming back for more until I finished everything -- broth and all.  Some broths (such as at Little Big Diner) hit you hard with the first taste, but by the end of the noodles, the soup flavor becomes overwhelming and I don't finish the broth.  There's a really nice balance in their bowl between the broth, noodles and the add-ons.

It's still not Ippudo, but it easily trumps other Boston ramen places for me.  I never understand the hype of Pikaichi (broth is not flavorful enough) or Yume (broth is waaaaay too fatty even for ramen standard, and I prefer thin noodles - also for the record,  thin noodle is what you'd find most of the time in Japan. I don't understand people who say they like ramen and then say thick noodles are better,  because if you've had enough good ramen,  you'll know that most if not all of them use thin noodles). This is to say Santouka has great thin noodles (would concede that it can stand to be a bit more chewy), GREAT broth that's just fatty enough (I had the shio and added a bit butter, but thought it'd been fine without the butter). The pork cheek was amazing, and the pork belly is better than most places here (Yume pork is comparable). We came on early Monday night and there was no wait at all.

Maybe you like thick shakes so it's not a problem, but I like them a little more on the drinkable side. The salad was good but they forgot my avocado. When I went to get more it took the girl like 15 minutes to get me a small cup of some avocado. I'm sure she had to chop it up herself but why not give me a little bit more at that point? The veggie patty was pretty good and that's hard to find. \\n\\nWe also had a  combo side of rings and tots which was kind of skimpy for the $4/5 they cost. \\n\\nOverall we weren't wowed but it's not a place I would cross off my list.

The view is obviously spectacular, and I wanted it to be have a special dinner because it was my 30th birthday dinner with my family.   \\n\\nWe got there before they opened so sat in the bar area and had drinks till the restaurant opened.  The bar service was very slow. \\n\\nWhen the restaurant opened, we were seated behind a pillar; I asked if we could move to the same-sized table on the other side of the pillar, which was empty, but they told me that it was reserved.  It was empty the entire time we were dining, and finally as we were leaving, a group got seated at that table, but the waitstaff changed the number of place settings to do so!   Maybe I'm not so well-versed in table arrangements of reserved tables at restaurants, but if the table's reserved for so many hours for a certain number of people, why are they changing the place settings immediately before seating the supposed reserved party?  I was disappointed because this was supposed to be a special occasion for us and so many things went wrong (and I am not one of those people who complains because I don't understand how a fine dining experience works).  \\n\\nThe food itself was pretty good, but I didn't really get to enjoy it as much as I should have because of the waiter.  In addition to the regular a la carte menu, they had a couple different prix fixe menus for dinner,  which everyone in my party ordered.  Although they don't allow substitutions for the prix fixe menus, the waiter let me substitute with something a la carte for one of the courses because of my food allergies, even though he was wrong!  Given what the menu said, I didn't think I would have a problem eating the original prix fixe menu's dish.  The thing is, I'd told him I am allergic to wheat, so, as many do, he says, \\"oh a gluten allergy.\\"  I told him I can eat gluten, just not wheat.  I sometimes don't bother correcting waiters who say this, but a gluten-free diet is more restrictive, and I wanted something that he said I couldn't have.  \\nWell, he subsequently pretty much freaked out about the whole thing!  I am very familiar with my own dietary restrictions, and am of the opinion that if the waiter fully informs me what's in something and knowing this, I agree to eat it anyway, they are not liable for any allergic reaction I may have.  But that's just me, I suppose.  I'm VERY surprised that a waiter at such a supposedly high-end restaurant has so much trouble with knowing what's in the restaurant's food, or understanding what food is made of.  I have never seen anything like this.  We finally settled on my having a spinach salad for the course in question, but he was so paranoid that he had the chef put each ingredient in its own separate ramekin...just in case I couldn't eat one of them (I eat a LOT of salad, b/c half the time it's the only thing I can have on a menu! So I am very familiar with being stuck with salads, but this was uncharted territory).  To make matters worse, when it came to dessert, I chose the parfait, which this weird waiter said was safe; maddeningly, it had a layer of CAKE on the bottom!  Glaringly obvious bit of wheat there.  Yet again, the waiter demonstrated his utter cluelessness about his restaurant's food.  So strange....and not okay.\\n\\nIt is a nice place, I just had an extremely weird experience."},{"name":"The Backspace","address":"507 San Jacinto St","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Food, wine, and service were excellent.

This is seriously great, which is why I was a regular.\\n-The staff is nice, if not a bit hurried since they're usually so busy.\\n-I like the design inside the shop, it's very cool.\\n-Presentation on the ramen is always nice.\\n\\nCons:\\n-It's very loud in there when they're busy and difficult to talk if you sit inside (and have a soft voice, like me).\\n-Takeout is sometimes rushed. It's interesting because since the restaurant wait times are so long, I assume this is a big part of the business for them.\\na. I've gotten ramen a handful of times where the broth only seems to cover the bottom of the second bowl (when you pour it in with the ingredients, it's not nearly enough). It seems just like a very very thin layer on the very bottom, like the employees didn't really check how much they filled it up. When you pay so much for every bowl it's kind of frustrating.\\nb. I had gotten a piece of a band aid in my takeout one time. GROSS! Should've said something then but didn't want another bowl - was just done. Threw the rest out, stopped going for a long while, decided to come back months later.\\nc. I just had a situation where I ordered and they forgot the egg. I figured it was fine - since I come there every day that I would just call in the next day and explain the situation, hopefully they would make it right and add a second egg (which I did pay for...). When I called in to place the order, the employee said that if I had called it in the day it happened, then management would do what they could. Since I called it in the next day with my next order then they wouldn't just \\"hand out free eggs\\". I told her on the phone that I come in and get takeout every day, but it didn't matter. I understand their reasoning so it's fair to everyone, but it's just an egg... I ended up cancelling my order right there and told them nevermind. She just said \\"alright\\" and hung up like it was nothing. I had been waiting for months for it to open and had even come to support it during their soft opening, so it was just a bit disheartening.

We waited at least 45 minutes before our food arrived at our table. (In fact, individuals who had arrived AFTER we did were served before we were). The waiter acknowledged that he wasn't sure why the food was taking so long but he assured us that the manager had been made aware. We waited, waited, and waited some more.

I, on the other hand, ordered the duck and was not pleased. It was somewhat dry and not tasty. Meanwhile, our waiter David (who did a great job) informed us that he would be bringing out something special to make up for the long wait (and not at our expense, of course). He brought out the dessert menu and we ordered \\"one\\" dessert to share.  Much to our surprise, our waiter returns with the dessert we ordered (along with 2 quarter size cookies that were a TOTAL of $3.00 and were being offered to us \\"on the house\\").  This was totally unacceptable and insulting. Our bill was close to $100 and 2 small cookies did not make up for the amount of time we had to wait for our food (which was obviously also a concern for our waiter who eventually had to inform management of our long wait). \\n\\nUnfortunately, my husband and I will not be visiting this restaurant again.

Fatty and lean brisket, prime rib, pork ribs, beef rib and sausage adorned our plate, and after some considerable prodding by the staff regarding the side dishes that they were clearly proud of, we decided to try some of the squash \\"casserole\\", which was pretty good as sides go, but we generally don't roll that way, We're meat-only. \\n\\nAs for that meat: Damn. Weakest was prime rib, and as famed BBQ blogger Daniel Vaughn said of this product, he always thinks it sounds like a great idea, but he's never really had a great one. Well, I've had a BETTER one (at Kreuz Market in Lockhart), and the only good thing about this one was the moisture and (relative) tenderness of the cut. It was way low on smoke. \\n\\nRibs were quite good, with a little tug needed to release the meat (as it should be), and nice bark. Beef rib was quite good, too, if a little tough. \\n\\nSaving the best stuff for last, the brisket was top notch, not quite as good as Franklin, but still darned good. Both fatty and lean had good moisture and texture, and had good smoke, though I would have liked just a little more. But the best meat of the day, unanimously agreed upon by our group who, collectively, have eaten a LOT of BBQ at many top joints, was the wonderful sausage. Incredible flavor, very juicy, coarse grind and snappy casing. I personally declared it the best sausage I've ever eaten, and this includes the Lockhart greats, Franklin, Snow's etc. None of my fellow diners disagreed. \\n\\nBottom line: If you want to say you've eaten the best BBQ around, you've got to put this place on your agenda.

Especially considering there was one car ahead. What's more, they did not open the car door for my gf - again, unacceptable.\\n\\nMy reservations. I had 8:15 reservations and we showed up promptly. I know reservations don't get you seated right at that specific moment. Understandable. But, we waited over 20 minutes for our table. What's the point of making reservations? While we waited we attempted to get a drink at the bar. There were only two servers and neither of them acknowledged us. So, we skipped the pre-meal drink and decided to wait until we were sat.\\n\\nI will say that, while we sat at the oyster bar, two servers approached us and asked if we needed anything. I give them credit. And, while we were eating our server was very attentive, friendly and knowledgeable about the dishes.\\n\\nWe started with their Fried Spanish Octopus as a appetizer. The octopus itself was good. It wasn't rubbery at all, which can often be an issue. But, with that said, the batter or seasoning for it was very salty. It overtook what should have been a very good, simple dish. \\n\\nI ordered the swordfish and hush-puppies. Both dishes were excellent. Very good to taste, not over-cooked with just the right amount of garnish. The hush-puppies were sweet and delish! My gf ordered a salad and snap peas. The salad was very basic, and not anything to write home about. The snap peas were cooked well and tasted good.\\n\\nI loved the layout of the establishment. They have an open kitchen, which I always find fun and added to the decor of the inside. I will say that the food and the service made up for, what started out as a bad evening. For now, I'll give them 3 stars. There's definite room for improvement and, again, perhaps it was an off night. Not sure we'll be back anytime soon but it's work knocking off your bucket-list if you want to go."},{"name":"Andina Restaurant","address":"1314 NW Glisan St","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"Came into town from Seattle over the weekend, and saw all the great reviews.\\n\\nIt was exactly what I was looking for.

Last year was a decent experience, good food (but not great), excellent service, decent ambiance, comfortable seating and so on. Overpriced but good, though not good enough that I felt moved to review the place. I mostly only review places I really like and only give bad reviews very selectively. This one is very well earned.\\n\\nWe booked well in advance. When we arrived at 5:25 PM for a 5:30 PM reservation we were shown to outside seating. We'd specifically booked early to avoid this. When phoned the day before we'd said we very, very strongly preferred to be inside, but they took that as a non-100% answer and treated it as an okay to be outside and shuffled us outside anyway. When we questioned this we were told that walk-ins had taken the good spots inside the restaurant and we'd have to wait 30 minutes for a table. Either they insanely favor random walk-ins over people who like the place enough to book well in advance or more likely they overbooked the place and lied to us to cover this up, else why the call about it the day before?\\n\\nWhile we were waiting for the news at news they gave the table they were going to give to us to another group, and it was the better table. Those folks scored because it would also mean that they would have finished eating, paid their bill and been gone fifteen minutes before we would even get our dinner (more on that later). That right there is immediately the worst experience I've ever had booking at what is supposed to be a fine dining restaurant. It was clear they had a \\"You need us more than we need you\\" approach to their customers. Either that or they liked us so much they wanted to keep us there longer.\\n\\nThe tent was well decorated and had heaters in the middle and some loud fan noise. For us this meant talking loudly to be heard and being both hot and cold because the floor freezing cold meaning so were our feet and legs, and our heads over-hot because the table we'd been given had a heater directly over our heads. We kept asking for the heater to be turned off and they would and then a few minutes later it would be back on again, likely because another table asked for it. So probably we were too hot and others were too cold. It was a poor setup designed with higher profits in mind and not their customer's comfort. Or maybe someone was having a laugh.\\n\\nOur server, Christian seemed likely to turn things around. Like last year the wait staff are superbly trained and he was charming, friendly, engaging and helpful. The problem was whoever had assigned him to a group of 14 and to us. It meant long waits between him being able to serve us while he tended to that large slow group. Because this kind of thing never works out for smaller groups like ours most better restaurants have a designated server for large groups or a tag-team approach. We had neither. It was very poor management.\\n\\nSomewhere in the mix our orders were delayed and we sat around for over an hour and a half before our food arrived. The large group's food arrived just after ours, though they had already ordered and eaten appetizers. An hour and a half of heater tag, cold feet, asking for more bread and watching other people get their food, including the group who got our table and came in after us. We watched them finish their meal at leisure, pay their bill and leave (how shocking that they were much better at the speed when it came to billing and rushing you out). I don't think I've ever seen service that messed up before. How often do you see people come in after you, order more than you, eat, pay and be gone 15 minutes before you get your food? So on the plus side Hall Street Grill might just have set some bad service world record.\\n\\nWe didn't sit in silence either. We complained and not just to Christian. We pointed out the problems. We were ignored. They did nothing to make it up to us. No expedited food order, no offer of a free dessert or drink, no discount and no visit from anyone with any authority, only a rushed apology from our chagrined server.\\n\\nThe food was very good, but not mind-blowing. The place again seemed overpriced to me and I eat out a lot. There are only a few finer restaurants in Beaverton and I think that is the only reason this place survives. It reminds me of similar overpriced places in other small cities I've lived in, overcharging because there's too little competition. They don't believe they would last in the Pearl, Alphabet district, Hawthorne, etc, not with this combination of price and attitude. I regularly eat better food in Portland for half the price.\\n\\nIn the end we should have waited those 30 minutes for an inside table because we'd have had a better experience and probably would still have got our food half an hour earlier. That's a pretty epic customer service fail right there. \\n\\nSo my girlfriend's family tradition and all other visits to this restaurant"},{"name":"Soak Indo Nail and Foot Salon","address":"171 Auburn Ave","city":"Atlanta","stars":"1.5","text":"Please don't come here if there was a zero star I would rate them that..
