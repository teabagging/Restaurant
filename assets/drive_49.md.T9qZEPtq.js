Cost is $25, and makes about 7-8 small cups of coffee.\\nYou can read from the wiki about the coffee ceremony, and in the restaurant there is a picture of the ceremony. The ceremony as done in Lalibela is, however, rather boring.\\nThey do bring a smoking pan of beans around the table, but really can't linger because of the smoke it generates. They aren't allowed to bring it out too long and in any case it might set off smoke detectors or just plain choke you in the confined space.\\nThen the coffee is brewed in the traditional apparatus and poured into little cups. Concentrated black coffee taken straight (but if you need sugar they will provide).\\nAnd that's it. The end.\\n\\nYou can see the pictures I took and decide if the novelty is enough for you to spend about $3 per coffee shooter.\\n\\nWe were a party of ten and got to share ten different dishes. Price per person came out under $20, similar to a moderately priced Indian restaurant where you didn't load up on extra naan, which can inflate the cost. Here, you can ask for extra injera bread, but it costs $1 per order.\\nThe injera here is made with teff AND barley, and is NOT gluten free, unlike injera made only with teff.\\nTIP: Don't get extra injera. Instead, save the spoons from each dish and use them to reduce your usage of injera. Too much injera can make you too full to finish your dish. Plus, if you have a sharing platter like we did, there's still the injera at the bottom of the platter, which is soaked in the juices and either oily or tasty or both. We didn't get any extra injera and still didn't finish everything -- and each person only ordered one dish.\\n\\nTIP: \\"Wot\\" means sauce, so if you order anything with this expect it to look more like a thick stew or dip, possibly with no chunks of meat or veggie. The Qy Doro Wot, for example (stew from chicken and always with hard boiled egg) had exactly one drumstick and one boiled egg. Hard to share with many people except for the stew part.\\n\\nTIP: Website photos look pretty much nothing like what you get. Almost all our dishes came in that oval shaped dish common in Indian restaurants for a single order of curry.\\n\\nI felt that no individual dish was really so stand-out, but the meal was good overall for being able to try many things and the sheer variety in the meal -- made possible by going with many people, or ordering one of their platters.\\n\\nIf you tell them your group is going to share their orders, they can provide 1-2 large trays each with a single large injera. If you have two trays, put half of each dish on each tray to make your own sharing platter.\\n\\nLalibela Ethiopian Restaurant has a smallish look but a spacious-feeling interior thanks to generous table spacing. For a Friday evening it was pretty quiet at 6pm.\\n\\nTIP: It's next to Hon's Wonton House, so you might be able to mooch their free WiFi while inside Lalibela.\\n\\nTIP: The friendly owner is happy to talk about Ethiopian culture, including the name of the restaurant, the coffee ceremony, and eating with your hands and no cutlery"},{"name":"Highland Creole Cuisine","address":"2 Highland Ave","city":"Somerville","stars":"3","text":"The clerk at the front is very rude, have an attitude with customers.

When you walk in, you're greeted by a nice, full bar. There were plenty of clean tables to sit at so there was so problem getting a seat. Granted, it was a Monday at 3 pm, but still. There was a little line but gave us ample time to read the menu and know exactly what we wanted. Because there were so many good decisions, it was the perfect amount of waiting time. We placed our order, grabbed our drinks, and took our seat. Within 7 minutes, they brought our fries out. This is where i have to deduct some points because I personally, and I think I can speak for everyone when I say this, eats their fries WITH their burger. No one really goes in and asks \\"Could I have a hamburger and fries but please bring the fries before the main course.\\" Not unless you're living in Upside-down land is this acceptable.\\nNow besides bringing the fries out BEFORE the burger, the fries were subpar at best. They're those small, short fries you have to dig around and get your fingers all gross before even picking them up. Not to mention, they're so short, when you dip them in any dipping sauce, half of your finger goes in with the fry because they're about 1 inch long!\\n\\nOther than the fries, the burgers were amazing and we had a server that was friendly and provided us with everything we needed.\\n9/10 would go back again.\\"\\n\\n^ my man felt very powerful about the fries. Now back to me. I had the black bean burger (which is what is pictured) it was the best black bean burger i have ever had. The goat cheese surprisingly did not over power the other ingredients. I would also go back again."},{"name":"Ruth's Chris Steak House","address":"80 Colonial Center Pkwy","city":"Lake Mary","stars":"4","text":"I typically dine at the Winter Park location, but was curious about the Lake Mary location & tried it out for the first time...\\nCompared to the Winter Park location, the Lake Mary location simply can not compete for the following reasons:\\n\\n1) Although the Lake Mary location has a larger dining area, it lacks the upscale feel/ambiance that the Winter Park location has...the decor & noise level made me feel as though I was dining at a Cheesecake Factory...\\nThe chairs used for some of the tables are these plush chairs that look nice (staff calls them Alice in Wonderland chairs), but have ZERO functionality, as you sink so low in them that the level of the table almost comes up to your neck...they do have cushions that they offer to help remedy this snafu, but the cushions only slightly help with the table coming up so high...\\n2) The parking situation is an absolute joke...I would estimate that 10% of the spaces are for self parking, while the rest is for valet...yes, valet is complimentary, but I would still feel obligated to tip the valet $5 out of respect & to express my gratitude...also, I don't like being essentially forced to use their valet service, especially when I don't particularly like other people driving my car...\\n3) The most important issue...THE FOOD...I have dined at several different Ruth's Chris locations (not just the Winter Park location) & while they all have high quality, aged steaks, the preparation at the Lake Mary location leaves much to be desired...2 filets & 1 ribeye that my party had were inconsistently seasoned, such that some bites were very salty & others were either just right or under-seasoned...this has NEVER happened during my numerous dining experiences at the Winter Park location...\\n\\nI will say that my service was excellent, as it always is at any Ruth's Chris location, but if you are going for the total experience of fine dining, I recommend to steer away from the Lake Mary location & head to Winter Park..."},{"name":"Oaks Bottom Public House","address":"1621 SE Bybee Blvd","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"Oh the totchos.

We came here for Sunday brunch at about 1:30 pm, and a hoard of people were waiting outside to be seated. I pulled up my yelp app and placed us on the live waitlist. First things first, though. There were no parking spots outside this restaurant. It was packed. Don't think to park in the parking lot next door or at the adjacent Texaco gas station. Your car will be towed. Instead, we parked behind the restaurant at a nearby park. Important: Don't park your car in the park's parking lot. There are towing signs there. Do park along the side of the park, where there were plenty of spots and no signs saying that they'll tow your car. You may have to walk a little ways, but it'll be worth it to see your car in the same spot when you come back. \\n\\nNow, once we parked and got to the restaurant, I confirmed our yelp reservation. It didn't feel like more than 20 minutes before our name was called to be seated. One thing to note is that you may have to share a table with other people because this place is cramped, folks. I mean, the largest tables were the booth tables that could only seat up to 5 (maybe 6) people. Otherwise, it was two smaller shared tables or bar seating. My advice is the smaller your group, the easier it is to be seated sooner. \\n\\nNow, on to the food! We ordered iced Vietnamese coffee to start. Solid choice, since their coffee was creamy and strong. It wasn't too sweet either. We proceeded to order their crab cake benedict and migas with chorizo. Boy, these were both excellent. The migas had perfectly cooked creamy eggs with the chorizo and vegetables mingled within. What I absolutely loved was the spicy kick coming from the hatch chiles. It was in the eggs and the chorizo. So good! The crab cake benedict had perfectly poached runny eggs, creamy hollandaise sauce, and yummy crab meat in every bite of their crab cake. They didn't skimp on anything. \\n\\nService was great too, despite the hustle and bustle of this place. Do try to come early, especially on weekends, to reserve your table and find a parking spot.

My friend and I snacked on thin slices of chewy baguette with dabs of (unsalted?) butter while we waited for our drinks. I enjoyed  a wonderful cocktail aptly named \\"Irresistible\\". While I'm not much of a drinker, I would have had another in a heartbeat except that I was driving, so plenty of fresh water instead. To start I had the \\"salade de ch√®vre chaud\\" which was delicious - the greens were crisp and fresh, the dressing light and flavourful, the crostini were delectable. I'm not a huge fan of walnuts and I found the pickled beet cubes a bit too sweet for my palette (that's just me) but I could have easily had a large version of this salad for dinner! If LFB offered this salad as an entr√©e, it would make a lovely lunch or light supper. For my entr√©e, I had the \\"moules avec pommes frites\\" special which differed from the regular mussels by the addition of tomatoes and leeks in the flavourful, rich broth. The mussels were small but plentiful and perfectly cooked - the broth was delectable, if a bit chunky. The fries were tasty and a bit savoury and came with an aioli that was nice if a bit bland (a touch more garlic would have been perfect). By the end of the meal, I was 'marinating' my fries in the mussel broth, it was so luscious! My friend started with a generous mushroom \\"vol au vent\\"-style appetizer special with puff pastry and a rich, savoury gravy (he wiped the plate clean with the leftover baguette so it was a hit!). My friend's main was the pork chop special which came with green beans and a white bean m√©lange that looked tasty. My friend enjoyed his meal as well and reported that the pork chop was moist and tender. The restaurant was quite loud but with conversation rather than intrusive music (another relief!) and the room became quite warm as the evening progressed. Our server was charming and attentive, our empty dishes were whisked away promptly, our water glasses were always full.

Hopefully it is only seasonal, but they offered a candy cane cheesecake which was enough to turn my stomach. I love cheesecake and don't have anything patently against candy canes, but the thought of the combined flavors sounds awful to me. I love Christmas as much as the next guy, but it doesn't mean we need to mix candy canes with everything. Next thing you know, Taco Bell has a limited time candy cane flavored Dorito Loco taco or Papa John is getting all crazy with a candy cane pizza with peppermint infused garlic dipping sauce. And then where does it end? Peppermint Jack Daniels? But I digress from my review. \\nI think the pricing is below what I'd consider for a true steakhouse. It is more on par with Outback - which I happen to think has really good quality beef for their prices. This spot will serve as a good change up for us if we don't want to hit a steakhouse further away. \\nWe enjoyed our time and will be back."},{"name":"Pho Van","address":"8557 Research Blvd","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"I can't believe I haven't reviewed this place yet.

Since I had already been scoping out the restaurant for some time I knew what I wanted. I wanted the Lettuce Cups for 2 but was going to eat them as my full meal. The chef came out to take my order and she looked bitter right from the get go, I asked what chopped vegetables are in the lettuce cups and mushrooms is one of them. I ask if I can get the Lettuce Cups; no mushrooms. NOPE. I find out that everything is premade and a basic substitution/modification like that cannot be accommodated. We should have left immediately but it was already a late lunch for us and I decided to just go for the Sweet & Sour Chicken which I didn't even really want. My dad with no dietary restrictions got the pot stickers and chicken fried rice.\\n\\nMy Sweet & Sour Chicken tasted premade. It was like they used a bottle of sauce from the grocery store. Not only was that disappointing but my dad had 1 piece of chicken in his CHICKEN fried rice.... Extremely lacking on a huge part of that dish but overall he was satisfied with his pot stickers.

But, once we got to the hotel, we were able to look up some of her recommendations, and immediately set out for Terry Black's.\\n\\nThe Lyft driver that brought us to Terry Black's praised our choice for BBQ, which made us both absurdly proud (this wasn't our get, as it was) and incredibly hungry. He told us of another really good BBQ place in town but mentioned that the wait can sometimes get up to 4 hours. No thanks.\\n\\nTerry Black's had a line that was almost out the door, but it moved pretty quickly. We stood in line debating what to get (brisket and ribs, plus creamed corn and potato salad as sides) and in what quantity (1 pound of each meat, and the medium size for the sides, because the size difference between small and medium was crazy). \\n\\nWe thought we'd ordered too much food, even with us splitting everything. NOPE! We polished off almost everything without blinking an eye.\\n\\nSo here's the thing. The food was good. The food was damn good. But was it the best barbecue we'd ever had in our lives? Hard to say, really. Because when it comes right down to it, it's not like we can immediately compare these ribs to ones we've come to love in other places around the country.\\n\\nSo, to be fair, I'll leave out as many of the superlatives as I can when describing our meal.\\n\\nThe ribs were fall-off the bone tender and had just the right amount of juiciness. They had a crispy shell on the outside and seemed to be coated with a slightly sweet and tangy glaze. It wasn't overpowering, and the glaze's flavor and crunchy texture melded perfectly with the meat.\\n\\nThe brisket was also juicy and tender. We got one slab and a couple large-ish burnt ends to share; the burnt ends were better than the regular slab of brisket meat. I think that's to be expected - all the flavor of the meat, liquids and char from the fire lives in the burnt ends, so it's supposed to be bursting with flavor.\\n\\nThe sides were also good, though I did prefer the corn to the potato salad. The creamed corn looks like a dessert in pictures, just because it was swimming in so much creamy goodness. I ate way too much of that particular side, for sure. The potato salad was good - cold and creamy, and the potatoes had the consistency I prefer for potato salads, more on the al dente side, not mushy at all.\\n\\nThey had three bottles of sauce set on the table, which we both used...in liberal amounts. The meats didn't need the sauces at all, but when one puts bottles of sauce in front of us, we can't refuse, can we?\\n\\nThe guys working the meat carving counter were friendly and accommodating to a couple girls who had no idea what they should order. Instead of just nodding along and letting us order too much food, the guy with the knife told us to scale it back a bit and saved us some money. That was appreciated."},{"name":"Frontier Public House","address":"4909 NE Hazel Dell Ave","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4","text":"Been here a few times now and have tried:\\n\\n* Fried Green Tomatoes ( 5/5 ) so much deliciousness and pizazz / a must try! & the dipping sauce is awesome\\n* Chorizo & Eggs ( the weekend brunch menu ) 5/5 BUT they NEED to have flour tortillas, as an avid chorizo and eggs lover - corn does not mix!

I booked a 7pm dinner reservation for two... was hoping for a some quality time with my date and spent the whole time feeling anxious because the staff was pressuring us to leave/rush.\\n\\nI knew something was up when the hostess said \\"we have this table for you is that ok?\\" - like why are you persuading me to take a table? I asked if there was any reason for the question (giving her a safe space to explain what ever she was nervous about with our table and she just said no it's all normal enjoy)... so yea at this point I just wrote off the awkwardness and we sat down. \\n\\nIt turned out that they had a reservation at 8pm (one hour later) and split a large table up into two small tables but they wanted to put it back together in an hour for the next reservation.. sigh\\n\\nWe ordered a bottle of wine and wanted to take our time with appetizers .. the server we had wouldn't take our appetizer order before the main entrees because \\"the head chef wants to make it all at once\\" I'm ok with that, it's their restaurant so no problem.. but at that point I started to get a feel for what was going on.. they were in a hurry to get us out of the seats we were in. \\n\\nRegardless I asked for bread which they didn't bring until I asked multiple times. Again it just felt like they wanted us to skip it and get to eating and gtfo - \\n\\nTwice we had a plate with food on it and the crew asked to take it away. At 8pm (1 hr after we had walked into the restaurant) another hostess came over and asked us to move to the bar and finish our wine and food there because a larger party was waiting.. yikes... Even this is understandable until she said \\"they have been waiting for 20 minutes now\\" like it was our fault or something, putting the blame out there like that was what really sucked the most. It's fine to say you need the table and the planning didn't go how you wanted it to but be open and communicate clearly, don't tell me that a party has been waiting on us for 20 minutes when we haven't even been in our chair for 1 hr and we bought a bottle of wine. We just left at this point, couldn't finish the wine, didn't wanna sit at the bar, the food wasn't special and the service was stressful.\\n\\nI hardly write these reviews but this place was stressful and the whole hour spent trying to enjoy dinner sucked with constant interruptions and feeling like I was being rushed outta my seat until actually being asked to move the bar.. I think one hour is pretty reasonable for dinner with a bottle of wine and I gave the hostess ample time to explain the situation before sitting us down.\\n\\nJust gonna chalk it up to poor communication this time\\n\\nRestaurants are about food and service so two stars for fine food spoiled by sub-par service"},{"name":"Clay Pit","address":"1601 Guadalupe St","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"I would return for mussels with naan and the aloo ghobi!

The only reasons why it was not difficult or a disaster were because of the vendors.  One of those vendors.....JaCiva's. My husband and I flew into Portland on a whim for work so I contacted JaVica's to try to schedule a tasting. The only day we had available was a Monday and they do not do tastings on Monday (it makes sense....they work all weekend making cakes and goodies for all of us that have events on the weekends) understandable the baker is off that day. So, I asked if we could come in anyways to see their shop, cakes, and any other goodies. The sweet young lady that answered the phone says \\"yes\\".  We walk in on Monday to check out the place and we were greeted with a smile, asked how our travels were, offered a drink, and seated at our table for a tasting.  As I'm confused because I know tasting are not done on Monday's, the head cake master walked out, sat and chatted with us, brought a tasting plate, and explained the 6 different cake slices we were trying.  I explained that I did not think we were having a tasting (only because I'm still confused) and then she says \\"I knew you flew in from Florida and I wanted to make sure you had your tasting\\".  Customer appreciation like that is hard to come by these days.  Not only was the service impeccable but the decorations on our cake were GORGEOUS and the flavors (red velvet, carrot cake, and a white cake with triple berry filling) were a party in our mouths.

He can't tolerate pepper or garlic, and god forbid any chili enter his palate. Fortunately, their menu has each dish labeled with a spiciness meter. It goes from zero to three lines with three being hot hot hot. When we explained this to the server she made sure to let the chef know and when one of the dishes ended up being too spicy for him, they brought out a glass of milk and some house made lychee drink. \\n\\nI had the Smoked Mushroom Lo Mein which sounded just delectable. It was very good, but not excellent. It certainly had a unique flavor; the smokiness was a great addition to the traditional lo mein. What I loved about it was the ratio of noodle to vegetable. Usually Lo Mein is about 80/20 noodles to vegetables, but this dish got it down to about 50/50. There were lots of noodles, different mushrooms, scallions, water chestnuts and cilantro. The whole dish was quite nice and had a lot of different textures. \\n\\nTheir cocktail menu is limited with just a few different options.

I've been here a number of times to enjoy the food with tables (yes, plural) full of my most excellent friends. Digging into that kitfo, those tibs, the amazing lamb, and the wonderful injera bread is an exercise in tasty camaraderie. Just scoop up the goodness in strips of injera and enjoy. \\n\\nGhion Cultural Hall is something of a hole-in-the-wall. It's easy to miss, and it doesn't look like much from the outside. But the inside is warm and comfortable, and the people have always been fun and inviting. Plus, you're not going to go home hungry. Everything here is fantastically good. If you're having difficulty navigating the menu, I have a simple recommendation: \\n\\nGo with a group and get the Ghion Cultural Special. This is served as a giant, injera-covered platter covered with a variety of savory treats: curried veggies with kitfo, dry-seasoned tibs, Ye-beg tibs, and doro wot. That thing with the hard-boiled eggs? Food for royalty. No joke. Ask them about it. This platter will feed three to four folks with all kinds of savory, spicy goodness. It's a fun way to taste a variety of different things in one shared sitting with your friends. They even have vegetarian options for those who desire such a thing.\\n\\nDon't be in a rush. This food is a quality preparation. So take your time, be leisurely, and enjoy the experience. Have some of the honey-wine (Tej). I call it mead. It's really rather good. And when you're done, try the Ethiopian coffee (Buna). It's something of a cultural experience unto itself. I'm getting hungry just thinking about it. I'll be looking forward to my next visit.

I have bartended, served, bussed, food run, and been manager of different restaurants in fine dining, sports bars, lounges, night clubs in the NYC area for 7+ years and I have never had such poor service in my life. I understand that I went to this restaurant on Labor Day and the place is busy; however, there is no reason to give an attitude and such inattentiveness throughout the whole experience. There was a 40 minute wait for our table which we happily waited. When we were finally sat in the upstairs patio, it took 10 minutes for a greeting and another 5 to place an appetizer and drink order. Every time we would try to speak to the waitress (blonde with a ponytail and rayban sunglasses), she would rudely cut us off as if she knew what we were going to say, which she didn't. She gave us an attitude when we ordered a frozen drink because she didn't have time to go to the downstairs bar (understandable) and gave us an attitude again when my pregnant sister ordered a virgin drink. There were 5 tables in the patio, she apologized to 3 of them about the wait, was nice to them, constantly checked up on them to make sure they were okay, and she was ignoring 2 tables. The 2 tables \\"coincidentally\\" were hispanics. We were seated at 4:15, placed a food order at 4:30 and walked out at 5:15. Mind you, we ordered a mezze platter (vegetable platter) and fried pickles because we are vegan. Not once did she check if we were okay, not once did she apologize for the 45 minute wait on veggies. I have NEVER walked out of a place until today. While we were walking out she asked us sarcastically \\" can I get you anything else?\\" I respond \\" No, we have been waiting for 45 minutes for our appetizer and we're tired of waiting, we have a game to go to and we can't keep waiting\\". Her response was to sarcastically say to her coworker \\" Oh okay they're not paying for anything because they have been waiting too long for their vegetables\\" laughs and turns around. She didn't say \\" let me get you a manager.\\" Or \\"I'm sorry for the wait\\". Nothing. Just bluntly disrespectful and even laughed to our faces. Definitely not coming back when I visit Boston again.

Now let me say here that we have been to Mojo's many times.  I love their pizza...usually.  This day, I opened my pizza box to find two old, hard, dried up slices there.  Well, they were kind and had decided to add a little extra cheese to make it palatable.  Well, I walked back to the counter to request two fresh slices.  It was as if I didn't exist.  I actually got someone from the kitchen to help me or so i thought.  I explained that the pizza was dried out and asked if they had a fresh pie.  She grabbed the box and said \\"I'll take care of it\\".  By this time, my son had already started in on his wings as I sat waiting for the return of my fresh pizza.  After about 20 minutes, I asked the young lady at the register to please check on my order.  I was probably a bit rude at this point.  My carnivorous son had already finished his meal and here I was still waiting.  She came back with the box and I very hesitantly checked it...to see the same dried out slices just with a little more cheese added.  I think I saw red then.  I asked...is it possible to get 2 fresh slices?  She went to the kitchen and came back to say that they would have to finish the current (dried) pie before distributing from a fresh pie  I said...but you could have told me that an hour ago.  She said she could give me my money back which I took her up on.  I went next door to the mexican restaurant and had a lovely meal there.

Once our food was delivered we never saw any wait staff. I refilled our drinks on my own. It wasn't until we were about to walk out that someone refilled one of our drinks. (I didn't want anymore.) The other point is that when we paid (before eating anything) we were asked to tip. It's my experience that a tip is earned due to awesome service ALREADY provided. In our case, the tip was earned without any wait staff helping when we needed it. \\n\\nOtherwise, the food is well worth it!"},{"name":"Donut City","address":"1880 Mountain Industrial Blvd, A1","city":"Tucker","stars":"4.5","text":"Absolutely loveddddd this place!

This was the first place my friends and I checked out in Austin, and after the first bite of my fries and burger I was sold. Let me stay in Austin forever.\\n\\nIt was happy hour so I started off with a Thirsty Goat Amber. Nice nuttiness and very smooth. Loved that they chilled the entire glass. Made it super refreshing! To eat, I ordered the Magic Shroom burger. Super magical indeed. I'm not a big goat cheese fan, but I couldn't say no to mushrooms. The cheese wasn't super overpowering, and was complemented well by the basil pesto. Overall, a pretty solid burger. \\n\\nThe real winner of the meal was the PARMESAN TRUFFLE FRENCH FRIES with ailioli to dip. Crying because I wish I could be eating some right now. These fries were cooked to perfection - not too crunchy, and not too squishy either. Even when I was full, I could not stop myself from picking at what was left of the fries. The only minor (and I mean very minor) con was the fact that the fries were all super short. I just wished there were longer so I could have more fries lol. We also ordered the Chili con Queso fries. They were good, just didn't have the wow factor of the Parmesan Fries. They also weren't as crispy :( but still pretty good.\\n\\nTo top it off, not only was the food spectacular, but so was the service. Maybe it's just the people in Austin, but everyone was so NICE.

The restaurant was so offensive that I will never be back.  \\n\\nFirst, let me say that I grew up on Kelly's Roast Beef.  In Revere, there is only one place to eat.  Succulent melt-in-your-mouth roast beef has this sometimes-vegetarian jumping through hoops.  In recent years, the restaurant has branched out to other locations, including the one near my parents' home in Danvers.\\n\\nWe arrived tired and hungry, expecting to have our taste buds rewarded.  Boy were we wrong!  I ordered the usual Large Roast Beef with sauce and my BF ordered his usual, the fish sandwich.\\n\\nI took one look at my sandwich and declared that I could not eat it.  Red blood dripped down off the meat, sullying the pristine white plate.  I was reminded of the poor animal that gave its life for my dinner.  Not wanting its death to be in vain, I took a bite.  The tough, bloody, grisly, slab of flesh was so thick that it could not be penetrated by my human teeth.  I almost puked.  \\n\\nMy gracious mate agreed to relinquish his sandwich so that I could eat.  I happily traded with the cheerful carnivore, but my happiness was not going to last for long.  I bit into the fish sandwich and its dark batter-coated flakes.  Did I say 'dark?'  We have ordered fish sandwiches at Kelly's for years and had always enjoyed the flaky 'haddock.'  What was this?  I picked it all apart, removing the gray areas of fish and eating the batter with tartar sauce.  When we were finished eating, we returned to our vehicle for the hour-long drive home.  \\n\\nMy dining companion became incresingly perturbed by our experience and when we arrived home, he called the manager at Kelly's and described our experience.  \\n\\nThe manager made no attempt to appease us for our bloody battle with the barely dead bovine, but he did offer an explanation for the gray haddock.  It turns out that the fish sandwich was not haddock at all, but pollock.  \\n\\nWe have always gotten a tasty fish sandwich, and believed it to be haddock.  We were further surprised when the manager informed us that if we didn't want a gray piece of fish, we needed to request 'no tail,' when we placed our order.  Sorry, but if you can't serve a meal that will satisfy a customer without them having to make a special request such as that, I will not be eating at your restaurant.  \\n\\nThe manager, when pressed by my mate, offered to send us a gift card for Kelly's that would make up for our bad experience.  Unfortunately, when it arrived, it was for a fraction of the cost of our food.

We set about casually discussing whether we should move ourselves, ask to be moved, or if it even really mattered all that much (we didn't really think it did). But the good news is, we had plenty of time to talk about it because it was almost 20 minutes before any server even acknowledged our presence there, let alone approached us to take an order of any kind. When he finally came over (after first approaching a couple at another table who had been seated well after us), he asked us if we were ready to order. I said, \\"well, we'd like to order our drinks, first,\\" and before anyone could go any further, he says, \\"Can you hold on a second,\\" and abruptly walks away. Bad day, I guess. But he never returned. Over the next 5+ minutes, he was circulating around doing whatever else it was he was doing, but never came back to our table. After that, we had just about had enough, and after almost a half an hour of just sitting there going nowhere fast, we finally just got up and walked out. I'd love to tell you about the food, but we just never got that far.

The lunch menu really didn't do it for me.  In fact, I found the selections a bit boring.\\n\\nYou have to read the fine print at the top of the menu to see that bread and oil are by request only.  I asked for some.  I got just that.  They didn't even bother to put some cracked pepper into the oil for dipping.  The bread tasted old and the olive oil was too bland.  I added some pepper from the shaker, but, still it just didn't do it for me.  Glad it was free.\\n\\nI ordered a chopped salad from the main menu for $12.  The salad consisted of:  romaine; raddichio; chickpeas; tomato; pepperoncinis; onion; black olives; salami; provolone; and, sherry vinaigrette.  First thing I will say about the salad is that it wasn't a bowl of lettuce.  However, everything else about it was just MEH. They tossed the entire salad in the sherry vinaigrette (which tasted more like plain olive oil). They shaved the red onions which made them completely unnoticeable. The only flavors standing out in this salad were the chickpeas, the pepperoncinis, the provolone, and the oil. A very bland and boring salad.  For $12 I expected a whole lot more.\\n\\nService was slow, but, friendly.  When I ordered my salad I told them to hold the black olives (as I'm not a fan).

This was easily THE WORST dining experience I have ever had. We made reservations for my friend's birthday. They asked if we'd like to sit in the dining room or in the private room. We thought \\"why settle for ambient noise when we can have a private experience?\\". Fast forward to the day of. The woman \\"welcoming\\" us in had zero vibrance and awkwardly ushered us through a nice, up-scale-looking dining room into our private dining room. \\n        What laid out before me, my family and my friends was ghastly. Read this: DO NOT BOOK THE PRIVATE DINING AREA! The walls were a gross maroon clashing with the dull blue carpet. They were two coats of paint shy of being completed and had white scuff marks here and there. The decor reminded me of something my grandmother would have found \\"cool\\" half a century ago. The worst part of the room was the moving boxes that littered the corner of our room and, what looked like a structural beam that had fallen and was now conveniently, haphazardly blocking our fire exit. There was a storage closet present as well, but that didn't piss me off until later. The miserable attempt at ambiance was laughable as we weren't even afforded music with which to listen. \\n          The waiter had not only given up at his job (or was having a really bad day), but also appeared to have given up on life. His monotone deliverance of contrived, token lines were grating and cringe-worthy. He made zero effort to make us feel welcome or to even attempt hospitality. I believe this was because he was getting tipped either way, and he's not very good at his job.\\n          The food was something I would expect from armatures learning to cook rather than fine dining; especially for those PRICES. I got the lobster ravioli; something which, in total, likely had less than a single claw-worth of meat. There were 5 pieces of pasta and that was it... the whole meal... for $22... seriously. My wife asked for just pasta and sauce because we brought our child and they don't cater to children. They charged us $22 for that as well. Both dishes were extremely bland, the ravioli being the worse offender, and were LOADED with salt. All of the guests had similar complaints. \\n         At a random point in the evening, the waiter opened the storage room door and just left it wide open. Forget about even attempting ambiance at that point. By the time the check came, I was unhappy with what I had just been made subject to, but kept my mood elevated for my guest of honor. However, when I opened the check, I was horrified to see they had charged me a 40% gratuity! When I brought this to the waiter's attention, he said in a single tone, \\"oh, that happens sometimes. I can take it off if you want.\\". \\n          This is certainly a place to avoid at all costs."},{"name":"Santarpio's Pizza","address":"111 Chelsea St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"Best pizza in Boston, love the authentic old school theme.

Dinner is always a toss up because I want everything haha!! I tend to go towards the noodles and get their Pad Kee Mao and depending on what kind of meat I want, the beef, chicken and tofu are all great options. It's made with stir fried flat noodles with vegetables in mouth watering chili sauce. My other favorite noodle dish is Pad See Yoo. I like it because it's slightly on the sweeter side and I like that they change up the vegetable assortment instead of green peppers, red peppers and onions. It has Chinese broccoli, carrots, and fried eggs.  After dinner, you usually crave something sweet and I recommend getting the fried banana!

When we're we're eventual say at a table, we were quickly given our drinks of our preferences. \\n\\nOur waiter took at least 30+ minutes just to take our order. My husband ordered the Diane Steak - well done and I had the Pork Chops. It took another 45 minutes to an hour to get our meals. During our wait, our waiter did apologize for the wait, offered us a free dessert drink and informed us that our meal is just a couple minutes from being delivered to our table. \\n\\nIt took another 15-20 minutes. Once they delivered the food to our table, both my husband and I cut a piece of our meals to find the both meats were undercooked. My husband specifically told our waiter that he wanted his steak well done with no pink. Now, I understand well done steaks takes a little bit longer to cook thoroughly, however, since the fact that our waiter acknowledged and made sure that he heard/got our orders correct, it really bothered us that the steak was not even medium or medium well, but pretty much medium rare! \\n\\nOur waiter came around to check up on us and noticed that there were \\"some\\" pink in the streak and offered to re-heat it up but my husband refused since we both knew the wait to get the steak back would be long, again. A few minutes later, a manager approached us and insisted to throw it back on the grill. My husband did tell her that it was fine, how he did not want to wait again, and that he did not want to eat it anymore. Again, the manager insisted and grabbed an empty plate, used my husbands fork and picked up the meat from is plate onto the empty one. \\n\\nI don't know if it was just us thinking this - but we did think it was a bit rude for her to that in front of us and where my husband was eating off of. The manager could've taken my husbands plate to the back separate the meat in the kitchen and brought back the other plate once she took the steak. It was very unprofessional. Once again, we had to wait for at least 10-15 minutes for a small steak to be re-heated to well done. \\n\\nAfter we finished our meal, we were given the option for desserts but we just did not want to be in the reservation anymore and asked for the desserts to be packed and for the check.

It took us close to a half hour from the time we ordered to get our food.  \\n\\nWe were waiting for a simple takeout order, and people preparing the food seemed confused for the most part.  It looked like only one person was actually preparing and the rest were trying to figure out what to do.    It was clear there were a few rookies on staff which I can understand and cut them some slack, but you would hope that after being open for a few months they would have enough people who knew what they were doing to be able to fill their orders.\\n\\nWhile waiting for our order, the employees had to explain that they didn't have enough chicken ready to to complete dishes and were offering customers to replace it with Turkey.  They couldn't plate orders correctly, putting half sandwiches and soup orders on different plates.  They forgot to give diners spoons for their soup.  My order was up and ready after about 25 minutes, finally, but they forgot to call out our number so it just sat there until we asked about it.\\n\\nThe manager was back trying to help get food out, but didn't seem to be able to make much of  a difference either. \\n\\nI've almost always had a consistent, fast, good experience in many different Panera's.

The portion was more than the usual six.  The flavor was good with garlic, butter and herbs. It tasted great by itself, eating with the toast was just too much crunch and the texture of the escargot got lost.\\n\\nVeal Sweetbreads Celaric Salad - One of my dh's favourite so we had to order this special off the board. The Sweetbreads was nicely done and flavor and the salad with pickled vegetables and Celaric was nice and light with a nice dressing.\\n\\nHanger Steak and Frites - This was very nicely done with his choice of sauce so we had the Red Wine Sauce, the beef was done medium rare per order, very tender. The frites was plentiful, crunchy and not oily.\\n\\nBouillabaisse - this was a light flavor dish with 2 pieces of fish, 2 prawn, clams, mussels, cherry tomatoes and leeks and onions. There was never wrong with this dish but I was expected a more tomato-ey base with more thicker stew flavor.\\n\\nPoached Pear Gallete with Creme Anglais - this was disappointed, the pear was nicely presented but the flavor was bland, the gallete tasted old, it was flaky but chewy. The creme anglais was ice cold. I asked for it on the side but did not expect it to be straight out of the fridge cold.

This place is part served food shop, part market in terms of their items being imported from France.

We had the pork belly with apple slaw. The sandwich was hearty, the one problem with this sandwich was that it would keep on falling apart. It was hard to keep all it's contents in one hand, and before you even took a bite stuff would be falling over the edges (I thought the reason for making a sandwich was to keep things together?). The sandwich was tasty and juicy, and we noticed many other things, including the chicken's spinning in the rotisserie oven at the back, they looked good and juicy.\\n\\nWe came back due to a groupon for their olive oils and vinegars, and were helped out by one of their cashiers there. My partner took her time to try everyone of the oils and vinegars before purchasing, and they were quite helpful. I did find the prices on the high side from what I'm used to paying for this kind of stuff, as our last trip had us stop at a place in San Fran, but you gotta compare apples to apples. I felt like I didn't leave with much for $40, as they do charge for the bottles.

I have had Blue Star in a different location and liked it so I didn't mind coming back again. \\n\\nWhen we go there, the line was wrapped around the counter and out the door. We probably waited about 15 minutes to get to the cashier. I ended up getting the cr√©me br√ªl√©e donut just to see what all the fuss was about. I guess the draw is the pipet of Cointreau stuck in it. It was cool to watch them glaze and then fire the donut. However the donut itself was way too sweet with its creme filling. I tried a little of the Cointreau with it but that made it even sweeter. I ended up not finishing the donut but now I know to order something else if I ever go back again."},{"name":"Desta Ethiopian Kitchen","address":"3086 Briarcliff Rd NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4.5","text":"First time eating Ethiopian food and man, it was delicious!

I don't enjoy eating burgers. In fact, I didn't eat burgers for 10 years of my life because (TMI) a boy threw up burger chunks on me... But this place makes me crave burgers, something I never thought I would say.\\n\\nThe trek: Free garage parking can be found behind the building. Just make sure to validate your ticket. \\n\\nThe wait: The line will be long unless you're eating at 3pm, so mentally prepare yourself for it. Once you get closer to the front of the line, there are usually hosts that will walk by handing out samples of the truffle fries. Props to the girl scouts preying on the hungry people waiting in line. You'll do great in life. \\n\\nThe food: The burger, oh the burger. Hands down the best  burger I have had in my life. My favorite burger is the buffalo burger. Add a fried egg or avocado and you're gold. The patty is so unbelievably juicy and fresh, and the restaurant prides itself on the quality and freshness of all ingredients used. The buns are better than the average bun as crazy as it sounds. The truffle fries are worth getting. The shakes. THE SHAKES. The nutella pretzel milkshake is great, and the salted caramel is a close second. Pro tip: You can get any burger on the menu made vegetarian style. \\n\\nThe hype: The hype is real y'all. If you're visiting Austin, this is the #1 place I think you should go to.

So here it is a Friday afternoon about 2:30 and I am now convinced that I should not have waited.  The trick is to go for a late lunch/early dinner when there are no lines.  Some of the early reviews had dissed this new gem by saying they would prefer the fried chicken at Publix These haters are missing the boat on this one - the brine  and the quality of the chicken made the chicken meat flavorful, moist and tender (even the breast).  The batter is a lighter crust (which is why some folks may not like it) but had a nice crunch to it.  They may also hate it if they are use to eating Publix chicken in general which often tastes like old socks - not that I am a sock eater. My husband and I shared a two piece generous (3 sides and corn bread).  It was more than enough for the two of us since the fix-en's and chicken pieces were hefty portion and only $10.49. There was a freshness and lightness about everything. The greens were tasty, the hoppin' john was one of the better versions I have tasted, the mac and cheese was classic. Cornbread was incredible! Now that summer is here and we are off, I am looking forward to other late afternoon lunches and trying other items.  I did sample the pimento grits and that will be my first fixin next time.

I had to try this place out after having two coworkers very strongly suggest to to me. I was game for a healthy dinner after a long day of work so I headed over there after work on a Friday. I thought that I might beat the dinner crowd and I was totally wrong. Whike the line wasn't out of the door it was a 45 minute wait. I was guy committed to not cooking dinner so I waited. I was so glad I did. Turns out there is always a wait and the best chance of a short wait is right after they open. I know that because I went back the following Sunday. There is a parking lot one door over so that was convenient. The restaurant is a converted house, no frills there. There were gentlemen behind the counter making the wraps and hallelujah their hair and beards were covered with hairnets which means no hair in my food! There was a nice r&b playlist on so the wait wasn't as bad as it could be. I ordered the punanny wrap because really how many times a year so you get to say punanny? I'm not a mayo lover but the soy mayo was good on the wrap. I don't know what kind of love and tenderness was cooked into that kale but it was delightful. The sweet corn was sweet and the flavors in the wrap were on point. The only reason why I took a star off was that there is no option to take off a half a star. The wait is intense for a wrap so half a star off for that.

I knew from past experience from patronizing west indian restaurants (I'm Trini and Jamaican so I'm allowed to beef about this) that I shouldn't expect stellar service, and unfortunately I was right. The ladies who served us were nice and very accommodating regarding questions of the menu but after waiting 40 minutes or so to get our food they realized that the order never printed out in the kitchen. We got some verbal apologies but no offer of a gratis appetizer, drink or taking a charge off the bill. Just \\"sorry you'll be late for your show.\\" Geez. Also, I was wondering why a tip option wasn't available when paying the bill (not that I was looking to leave a tip after that kind of service) but after reading other reviews it seems that tip for parties of two are automatically included. Sneaky sneaky. Okay - so back to the food. It was very tasty. My friend had the chicken, black eyed peas and plantains. I  had the moi moi and plantains. Both were very good and tasted very  homemade. My only gripe is that vegetables were nowhere to be found. I asked the waitress for vegetarian options and she point blank told me there were none. Not a one?! I made it work with the moi moi and plantains, but the menu is very confusing for those who are not familiar with African cuisine and they should definitely have a vegetarian section.

Was not impressed at all. Decided to sit at the bar since it was very crowded. Arrived at the empty bar seat and waited a long time for the bartender to clean the debris/crumbs at the counter. The bartender looked confused why I didn't sit down. I pointed to the crumbs. Finally got cleaned up and cleaned the chair too. \\nVery few gluten-free options - no gluten-free lasagna, really?! Ordered Italian Moscato, they don't serve that! I signed to them, \\"What Italian restaurant doesn't serve a typical Italian wine like Moscato?!\\" Then I told waiter/bartender \\"NO croutons in the salad\\". Then the bartender asked me, \\"Do you want bread?\\" If I order a gluten-free pasta = no gluten of any form. Waiters needs to be more educated about celiac disease/food allergies/sensitivities. Caesar salad arrived and it was full of croutons. I picked them out. What a huge difference of size when the bread crumbs are taken out, practically one cup worth. The gluten-free penne pasta was hard - I hate al dente --practically raw hard pasta and not much Alfredo sauce either. The bartender convinced me to take the dish back and chef will cook it some more. Returned it and it was still chewy. They gave me a free Italian after-drink which I didn't like, tasted like a strong licorice mouthwash. I will never go back there."},{"name":"South","address":"930 SE Oak St","city":"Portland","stars":"5","text":"The chicken sandwich is HOT. (That's a good thing.)

Thanks to the folks at Feast Festival I was able to get my bite at Ginger. Located in a suburb mall with good parking, Ginger has a hidden exterior that's filled with amazing spices upon you entering. Ththe visit saw us ordering Rogan Josh, butter chicken, and a veggie platter. The platter was a combination of pakoras (veggie and paneer) and samosa. Although the samosa was one of the largest that I've had, the paneer pakora was freshly made that's hot and soft to eat. To enjoy our curries we also ordered some amazing naan bread (garlic and original) that's flaky, soft, and hot. Being a sucker for garlic I'd definitely recommend the garlic naan. These naan went very well with the two curries, a lamb and a chicken. The two meats are well simmered and cooked, such that with a light bite the meat fibres just come falling apart. The Rogan Josh was by far our favourite and one that you need to order to experience how great the cooking at Ginger is!

We enjoyed the delicious food and drink experience - my husband tried a new drink that had schmaltz in it (I can't remember what it was, but he said it was great - I believe one of their servers created it!). The bar tender also introduced us to Amaro, which is probably the closet to Scotch that I can handle. Some food highlights were the bone marrow appetizer and the doughnuts dessert. I was surprised that I would like the doughnuts because there are some ingredients used that I stay away from, but the flavors worked so well together. The best dish on their menu - and I'm talking that I am still having dreams about this 6 months later, is their shitake mushroom dumplings..See, these are actually soup dumplings and they are just a warm, cozy rush of flavorful deliciousness.

The red curry had good flavors and tasted fresh enough. Their Hot Wok tofu, however, was flavorless and bland. It was a disappointing dish, and cost us 15 dollars. Also, they added a 18% gratitude tip on the tax of the meal, which is something that one should never do when running a business.

Today, I was finally treated to one of the best burgers I've had in Atlanta, and without a doubt a burger than can match up to others around the country.\\n\\nI got the Korean BBQ burger, which was an american wagyu patty, braised short rib, kimchee ketchup, pickled veg, with crispy tempura onion.  Seriously, this burger was delicious.  The beef patty was cooked to a medium rare and juicy.  The braised short rib was tender, and all of the flavors worked perfectly, as there was a bit of sweetness in the beef and the picked vegetables balanced out the flavors perfectly.  My only suggestion / complaint would be that it was difficult to eat the burger because they stacked the short rib onto of the beef patty, rather than mixing the two together.  However, that did not detract from my meal, as I just ate the short rib separately with the actual burger.\\n\\nOf course, any good burger place also should have great fries that come along with it.  The fries at Flip are delicious -- fried a bit more than usual for a crispyness to it, and then paired with this smoked mayo that is out of this world.  I am a huge fan of good mayo and I can safely say this is one of the best mayos I've ever had -- it tastes just like bacon!  (I would suggest splitting the fries between two people.)\\n\\nTo top it all off, I ended up getting a pistachio and truffle milkshake -- probable one of the richest milkshakes I've ever had (you can actually taste the truffle in it), but it was also well made and wasn't too thick that you couldn't even use a straw.  \\n\\nAll in all, I went on a semi-rainy afternoon so it wasn't too busy and service was good.

The menu has lots of options, including everything from signature sandwiches like the Muffuleta and Banh Mi to vegetarian-friendly fried tofu tacos. I ordered the Poblano Pork on corn taco plate, which comes with two tacos and a side of chips and salsa. However, with my dairy allergy, I ordered it sans the feta cheese that usually accompanies the order and let the cashier know I'm allergic. This place lost a star because even though I specified no feta, my food came out with cheese on top. When I ended up trying it, there was just so much shredded pork that was unfortunately just okay and not a lot of the poblano or onions advertised. The salsa had no kick and I was only given a tiny amount for all the chips I had, which was unfortunate. My friend really enjoyed his Veggie Grilled Cheese though! \\n\\nMy friends and I went outside to sit at one of the many picnic tables under a few Christmas light strings strewn above us just as someone was getting up to perform.

Thus, any food experiences thus far have pretty much been limited to the fast food/sandwich shop variety. \\n\\nUntil Friday, when two of my coworkers and I stopped by Parish for some post-work drinks and dinner. Parish is one of those places that you hear about a lot from others, mainly the sandwich selection (which are recipes concocted by local chefs from other restaurants). I'm all about the sandwich, so it was time to put the reputation to the test. My coworker is a regular at Parish (even has her own mug!), so I was in the company of an expert. I was game.\\n\\nWe started out with some drinks to wind down from a hectic Friday. I was in the mood for something sweet, so I ordered a Watermelon Mojito. A bit too sweet, but not bad overall. I followed it up with a regular ol' Mojito, which I liked better, and then a blueberry Sea Dog, since I was jonesing for a beer. We had put our names in for a patio table and hunkered down at the bar to kill time. About 10 minutes later, a table was ready, and we were on Boylston, ready for people-watching. Exxxxcellent.\\n\\nIn the midst of all this drinking, we ordered dinner. I ordered the Zuni Roll, while my coworkers sampled the Hummus Plate and the Chipotle Meatloaf Club. My sandwich was decent; toasting the roll made all the difference, really. However, I was a little dismayed at the dearth of veggies, though there was plenty of turkey, cheese, and bacon. Artery-clogging, hot, melty goodness. \\n\\nThe bill came, which was a bit steeper than what I would have liked for a sandwich and some drinks. However, when one goes to Back Bay to dine, one does not typically expect a reasonable bill (save for a few tucked-away establishments). On Boylston Street, though? All bets are off. However, I will extol the virtues of going with someone who is friendly with the staff; we had a round of shots sent our way, free of charge, from my coworker's bartender friend.

I will try them again, and wish them luck getting The Coop back to its previous standards.  And for the record, Mr Poweski did not ask me to write this revision. --Alan T., Nov 19, 2019\\n_________________________________\\nI hate to write a negative review of a restaurant we've loved since it opened a few years ago, but we had a most unpleasant experience today. And the negative was ALL due to deliberate changes made by management.  First of all, one lines up and takes a paper menu out of the basket.  Today, no menus in the basket.  And there were at least 15 people in line.  We looked ahead for the accustomed menu up on the wall behind the food line, and it's gone, replaced by beautiful photos of entrees (without any names, if I remember, so if you thought \\"that looks good\\" you didn't know what to order.). Finally a man ahead of us in line passed his paper menu back to us, and I mentioned there were NO menus behind us for everyone else. This nice man went up to the counter, picked up a big pile at the register, and passed them down the line.  When I got to the register, I mentioned to the young man that someone should keep those menus supplied in the basket near the door, especially since there was no longer a menu on the wall. He said \\"There should be some in that basket back by the door.\\"  So much for that.  Next, they no longer have all the food laid out behind glass so you can go down the line and point to what you like (and see it before you order it.) All that fresh food is gone.  Replaced by three cash registers.  Obviously, this is to move the line faster.  Previously, once you got through the line, assuming everything was available, you were handed a tray with your food on it. Special items or items not ready were brought to your table.   Now you get a number and are released into the room to find a table.  We were there at 2PM on a Saturday.  Every table was full. We stood with our numbers-on-sticks in our hands for a good 10 minutes and NObody was leaving.  Servers tried to find us seats. With the two registers making the line go faster, people were coming out from the order process faster than tables were ready.  We found ourselves in COMPETITION with other people for a table.  People standing around the room, eyeing tables, and rushing to get to a table before someone else.  This is not good.  We did get a table after 10 minutes, and I wondered what would have happened if our food had been delivered before we had found seats.  Well, that wasn't a concern, because our wait had just begun!  I am an efficiency man, so I started the timer on my iPad as soon as we sat down.  There were three in our party.  (Oh, and the only spaces were at a table for 6 -- they now encourage sharing tables more than ever before.) So I had my timer going.  It was a full eight minutes before MY food was brought.  My two companions sat and waited.  A second meal was delivered six minutes after mine. It's now 14 minutes after we had sat down. And 24 minutes after we exited the line. My iPad timer is still going.  So these times are accurate.  Not until eleven minutes after our first meal was delivered did we get the third meal.  And THAT was simply because the lady delivering meal 2 noticed we still had a number on our table, and she read the ticket and made up the third meal and brought it out.  No sooner had SHE placed the plate on the table when another server brought the REAL third meal.  The servers seemed stressed. As we were leaving I asked a young man who was tending the beverage station \\"Are you under new ownership or something? We've noticed many changes.\\"  He just said \\"No.\\"  He did NOT ask how we enjoyed things.\\n\\nAs for the food, food we've always enjoyed was today tolerable at best.  The fried chicken was dry.  The Cole slaw was dry. Two of us ordered creamed corn.  One order came out with chopped green onion on top. Eleven minutes later my companion's was served, without green onion.  Lack of training?  Or just haste?\\n\\nI have always loved The Coop's chicken and dumplings. Today I ordered that.  Reminder: you can no longer see the food displayed before you order.  My chicken and dumplings came out, all shredded chicken (used to be beautiful chunks) and the two mushy dumplings plopped on the top were gummy.  Used to be covered with a beautiful white gravy.  No longer.  I will attach a photo below of the chicken and dumplings I took in Sept of 2018, and the sad order I got today.  No need to tell you which is which. Today's chicken glop belonged on a shingle.\\n\\nWe used to say to friends \\"Let's meet at the Coop for dinner.\\"  No more will we do that."},{"name":"Ramen Danbo","address":"1333 Robson Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4.5","text":"Small spot on Robson.

I sat and went straight to ordering a Nutella burnt marshmallow milkshake and the double burger with a side of onion rings. \\n\\nThe milkshake wasn't too thick and is just the way I like them. The marshmallows were gooey and managed to stay that way for most of the drink. The double burger was a lot bigger than expected and was one big juicy concoction. The patties were prepared medium rare topped with a double helping of cheese, double bacon, double grilled onions, pickles, and mustard. Gooey Deliciousness! It tasted even better with the beer mustard given with the side of onions rings. I had to ask for more to dip my onion rings into due to using it all on my burger. I guess you can say I had double mustard as well if you consider the mustard that was already on the burger.\\n\\nBefore leaving I was given a complimentary burger and shake card for my next visit.

I've had it on my list for some time now and finally visited today for a quick lunch bite.\\n\\nThey've clearly put a lot of thought into the interior - sleek wood panelling, dusty rose terracotta planters, and lots of greenery make the space an instant social media hit. There's one communal table with a mixed granite top (gorgeous!), small tables scattered throughout and window seating for optimal people watching. This place was PACKED on a Saturday afternoon and I was curious to see if it lived up to the hype.\\n\\nWe ordered the Fried Chicken Sandwich ($11) and Pork Cubano ($11), as well as two of their rotating beers on tap. Whoever's curating the craft beers has great taste, with nice picks from Luppolo, 33 Acres, and Twin Sails on the docket today. The fried chicken sandwich came on a potato bun reminiscent of the one from DL on the Drive, but the flavour profile here is completely different. Here you've got a light cabbage slaw and they're light-handed with the condiments, which I appreciate so the chicken really shines through. They've opted for individual pieces vs. one thigh/breast, but the density of the bread helps keep everything intact. I really like the batter they use and I'd say it's very similar to what they offer at their sister restaurant Anna Lena, retaining a nice crunch and moisture throughout. My only complaint is the sandwich lists jalapeno aioli as one of its components and I didn't get any of that flavour whatsoever. All in all, a very solid chicken sando nonetheless. \\n\\nMy boyfriend's Cubano sandwich was equally delicious, with thick slices of pork, cheese, homemade sweet pickles and mustard. This was well-balanced and I didn't find any of the ingredients overpowering the others. However, for the same price as the chicken sandwich, it was significantly smaller. I can see someone with a larger appetite needing something more substantial to feel full. Maybe if it was a dollar or two cheaper I'd think it was a better value.\\n\\nI can see why Their There is such a popular spot and I definitely will be back to try some of their enticing baked goods (popcorn cronuts!) and coffee. I just wish the room was larger and the price points are a bit high, which is why this isn't a perfect 5 stars for me."},{"name":"The Crepevine","address":"249 W State Rd 436","city":"Altamonte Springs","stars":"4.5","text":"Really great food & service!

Some of the highlights include the Eggplant Milanesa by Jamie Bissonette of Coppa, Toro, and Little Donkey fame, which piles thinly breaded eggplant, Oaxaca cheese, black bean spread, chipotle aioli, and avocado onto a sesame torta roll, and the Steak and Blue, a fancy concoction by Lydia Shire of Scampo, which decadently layers tender beef, roquefort butter, blue cheese, and marinated onions atop a sturdy pullman loaf. Definitely better quality than that slice of pizza everyone else is having after midnight!\\n\\nIf you aren't in the mood for a sandwich, they also offer an array of appetizers and entrees, which are equally memorable and tasty. The $6 Giant Meatball is particularly winsome - as big as it sounds, made with a house blend of beef, pork, and veal, and served with grated pecorino cheese and toasted crostini. For something heartier, check out Sean's Simple Chicken, the head chef's take on a classic chicken Milanese - tender breaded chicken cutlet complemented by creamy mashed potatoes and garlicky saut√©ed spinach and tomatoes. It's big enough for leftovers, and a steal at $17. Parish has a couple of desserts as well, a bread pudding and ice cream sandwich, which change on the whims of whatever is fresh in season. Seating on the patio is essential in warmer months, but a word to the wise - they don't take reservations, so be prepared to wait. However, it is absolutely worth it!"},{"name":"Taco Bell","address":"495 W State Rd 436","city":"Altamonte Springs","stars":"2","text":"Just left there a bit ago. (About 45 min before closing time 4Am) Pulled up and there was a guy in front of me, waited about 5 min and didn't hear him ordering then I heard him said \\"hello\\" after a few more min at this point it's been like 12 mins since I arrived I don't even know how long he'd been there and two more people were behind me now.

Is there a hidden message in obscuring one's donuts?\\n\\nUpdate: I think I've had my last BS Donut. It was an apple cider fritter. It wasn't large... just the right size. But it was one solid brick of grease-ladened dough laced with tough, stringy pieces of apple... probably with skin. I'm now \\"eliminating \\" the culprit after more than two attempts.

The atmosphere is super chill, it reminds me of the High Street McPub back in the day, before children started taking over pubs before seven pm (thanks Laurelwood. And, btw, I have children). The drinks  are cheap and made right, and the service is attentive enough. Cons: Salt. Salt salt salt hurts the flavors of everything, and in turn hurts my belly, especially from the tots. Take it easy chef. Also, it takes awhile for the server/bartender to get to you. All four times we have had to go to the counter to get things rolling.

Needless to say, I wanted to try Myers and Chang- being a fan of Flour and haven't heard about this place years back during my noodle obsession phase.  It's definitely tuned for a Western palate but I really appreciated all the creativity with the dishes.  Make a res or you'll have to wait- they accept them for brunch.  Bf and I came here at 1 on a Sunday and the place was pretty packed but clear out around 1:30.  The menu for lunch is dim sum, so you order what you want through a checklist.  The server was very friendly and helpful- she made sure to know we were getting \\"dim Sum\\" but truth be told bf and I were pretty full when we left.  We had the:\\n\\n- Braised pork belly bao, one order (it's a single serve). Unfortunately I really wanted to like this but the pork belly was way too BBQ-flavored and salty for me\\n- Sichuan Dan Dan Noodle- not authentic at all but a great twist with minced pork, mung beans and udon.  The peppercorn-numbing effect is lacking here for sure but I still enjoyed this interpretation; it's like a stir fry.. the heat level wasn't a 3 as they suggested (the hottest) but that's just me\\n- The green papaya slaw - one of my favorites; a spicy, bean-paste filled thickly cut papaya salad which was spot on with peanut and chilis\\n- The pomegranate duck wings- I just loved this ; the meat was so tender and fell off the bone.  It wasn't too greasy and the pom added a nice sweet flavor which I \\nsurprisingly really liked\\n-the Banh Mi with soy glazed bacon- BF was upset they served it open face because it was a bit hard to assemble. The bacon had an incredible (sweet) flavor but we otherwise felt it was just an egg sandwich. The only Asian flare was the pickled veggies.\\n-The Mama Chive and Pork Dumplings- Amazing.  Seared on one side, these were very chivey , so a bit bitter with plump, juicy pork. The dipping sauce was more like a gravy - be sure to get these.\\n\\nIf I had extra room, I would have went for the hakka eggplant, tea smoked ribs, or one of the signature desserts like the Genmai panna cotta or chocolate mousse.\\n\\n\\nThings came out to order and we ate pretty quickly.  It looks small but is actually pretty filling. Very cool and artsy atmosphere.  I liked it and maybe would return for dinner upon a next visit, but bf sadly thought it was bit too fusion for us. $50 for two."},{"name":"Hooters","address":"209 Peachtree St NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"2","text":"Service was decent and the wings were decent.

It is something that has happened as a result of the foodie fad, I think. It is often all about \\"me the chef, me the interior designer of the restaurant, me the marketing guru\\" but often it is not about me the paying customer. Excellent service in Austin is not common. Bad service kills restaurants. There are aspects of a restaurant that management must address in order for it to be successful and long lasting. Fifty percent of all restaurants fail and for good reason. Timing, cleanliness, polite staff, ambiance must be spot on. If music is present then the question should be asked is it so loud the waiter cannot hear the customer and vice versa? (Most European restaurants never have piped in music. It is an unneeded expense). The food at this restaurant was good but there are so many restaurants in Austin with good food that have all the kinks worked out. There were no paper towels in the bathroom which does not inspire confidence with raw fish being served. That was the first mistake. I had to stand at the bar for several minutes while the bartender sent a barback to get something for me to dry my hands with. There were no napkins at the bar. While I stood there looking foolish the bartender did finally hand me a cloth napkin but he did so almost begrudgingly. We spent $600 but knew going in this was a \\"tweezer-food\\" style of place as my very funny husband calls them. We were okay with the costs. We knew what were getting into. That is why the man works so hard and we no longer subsist on Top Ramen as in college days. Thankya Jesus! While this is a first world problem, cost is a consideration but it is not always THE consideration. These types of places can often be fun and innovative. Paying for a wonderfully creative meal can be like buying a beautiful piece of art or listening to a beautiful piece of music. But really this meal was comedic and stressful. The music was good but too loud so the waiter had to almost scream to us when food was presented. He was curt and short with us if we asked a question. This attitude of \\"pump it up\\" marketing to make a place seem more vibrant is hurting restaurants. Thus I think the \\"ambiance\\" question on a YELP review. This really is a problem for so many Austin restaurants. Next issue, a dish would arrive and the waiter be completely unaware of how to read the table i.e. is an intimate conversation going on? If so, move in quickly without too much fuss. Do not interrupt your table so much that they must completely stop for you. Again, it's back to the \\"me, me, me\\" school of thinking.  We would be abruptly interrupted and they insisted on telling us about what we were eating. Which was okay once but we had read the menu and knew what we ordered. We are older but not completely unaware. We tried to be polite and listen but as this is a small-plate style establishment interruptions happened over and over and over again. I am revealing my age, but it felt like we were in an \\"I Love Lucy\\" comedy sketch. A friend would try to tell a joke at a very loud volume but the punchline would be interrupted by a waiter. The music was good (especially if we'd been in a disco) but the waiter could not be heard and could not hear us. It was like talking and listening but no sound was coming out. The sushi was clean and tasty but not extraordinary. Just sushi. There seemed to be a bit of sugar used in some of the other dishes. That single flavor was rampant throughout the meal. But the food wasn't horrible by any means. However, the final straw for us was when before we'd even gotten our check a waitress began to clear our plates and physically reached across three people at our table as if we were not there while we were having a conversation amongst ourselves. Her body literally was between us so we actually could not see each other. Again, read a table. We asked her if she could wait to clear the table until after we'd gotten our bill and ideally after we'd left. There were numerous empty tables, no waiting so we assumed she wanted to go home to study or hang out with her friends. We could have been kinder in our request. We were frustrated. She was seemed tired. Waiting tables is hard, grueling, honorable work. Rather than a graceful exit with the dirty dishes she held and getting the bill she put all the dirty dishes she'd just gathered back on our table! Bless her heart. Not only was it awkward and immature it gave her more work not less because now she'd have to clear the table basically twice. It really was a comedy of errors. An unfortunate oversight on her part and lack of training on the management side. We'd stopped talking because her body was cutting us off from each other's face. It truly was funny and a first world problem. But not funny enough, nor tasty enough to return."},{"name":"Yak & Yeti Restaurant","address":"Disney's Animal Kingdom Theme Park 775 Werikhe Way","city":"Lake Buena Vista","stars":"4","text":"The service is amazing, but the food was very mediocre.

I was disgusted with what arrived. 3 out of 4 of the samosas were fried to a crisp and inedible. They look like they were scorched by a fire-breathing dragon. The naan was okay but after losing my appetite from the samosas I couldn't eat it. \\n\\nI was surprised to see the packaging was all styrofoam. That was also a disappointment. It's not difficult for restaurants to transition to environmentally friendly Packaging.

My fianc√© has a severe seafood allergy.  As a result, we are obviously very hesitant to order sushi or any other food that may contain seafood.  We found Fuji, and noticed that they appeared to be very allergy-conscious.  We ordered take out, specifying that my fianc√© had a severe seafood allergy and that her (non-seafood) order should be boxed separately from the rest.  When it arrived, all of the food (seafood and non-seafood) was in the same container.  My fianc√© called and spoke to a manager, who refused to acknowledge the error.  She stated that it was \\"no big deal\\" and would \\"probably be fine to eat.\\"  When my fianc√© explained again that she had a severe allergy and that she specifically requested her food be boxed separately, the manager again stated that it should be fine, suggesting that she wouldn't have a reaction because her food was made on a separate cutting board (even though it was boxed together with seafood).  The manager also tried to blame the mistake on the girl who took our order over the phone, stating that she was new and didn't know what she was doing.  At the same time, however, the manager acknowledged that the girl noted the seafood allergy and the need to keep the food in a separate container.  The girl taking the order clearly did her job, and the manager refused to acknowledge that anyone else was responsible. \\n\\nWhen my fianc√© asked to speak to the manager's supervisor, the manager replied that she \\"could send over another order, but it was going to take a while\\" because they were \\"very busy.\\"  She seemed annoyed that we even wanted to speak to somebody else about this issue, even though she offered no other solution to the problem.  She was argumentative, confrontational, and dismissive, and barely listened until she was asked to provide the name of her supervisor.  \\n\\nUnfortunately, we do not feel comfortable eating at an establishment that does not respect the health and safety of its customers."},{"name":"Cafe Paisano","address":"182 W State Rd 434, Ste 1000","city":"Longwood","stars":"4.5","text":"I love this place !

The food comes in a timely manner and the waitresses are so nice. A major plus about this place is that they are very aware of allergies and have different menus to accommodate dietary restrictions. Some of the things we got: \\n-Crispy Tofu with Sriracha Aioli: The dish was executed well. The tofu was crispy and piping hot. The coating was not overly oily and the aioli gave the tofu a nice flavor. It was not spicy at all. \\n-Fresh Rolls with Tofu: This was another splendid dish. The proportions of the various fillings were just right. A nice twist on this was the pickled cucumbers. We loved that tangy bite!\\n-Wok Charred Udon Noodles with Chicken: This was SO good! I would definitely get it again. The black bean sauce had many layers of flavor. It's not a spicy dish. The charred bok choy was also delicious. The only thing is that it was slightly oily (you had a small amount of oily at the bottom of the dish). But nothing enough to deter me from ordering the dish again!\\n-Wok Roasted Mussels: I saw a lot of great reviews about this so I was excited to try it. There was a lot of potential but the dish we got was overly peppery. The pepper overwhelmed the lemongrass flavor and the mussels. I'm not sure if I would go for it again. But a plus is that they gave a lot of mussels in one order! \\n-Surf and Turf Black Pepper Noodles (but we just got it with shrimp): This was another pretty good noodle dish here. Not overly peppery. Was hot and fresh. Would get this again. \\n-Crispy Marinated Tofu Buns: This dish was sort of a let down. The actual bun was nice and soft. But the actual tofu wasn't what we expected. It seemed to have a type of tomato jam and pickles in it along with the tofu. Personally, the flavors did not meld well for us. Don't think I would get it again but still glad I tried them!\\n-Coconut Cream Pie: SO good!! Definitely exceeded my expectations. The pie crust was perfectly buttery, flaky and crunchy. The coconut filling had a nice kick of coconut and was not overly sweet. And the lime infused whipped cream complimented the coconut cream very well. I had to say I was a little hesitant with the lime whipped cream (because I don't really like citrusy desserts). But this made the dessert so much better! The lime was not too strong and the whipped cream wasn't too sweet. The dessert overall was light and just so delicious!

I love when they have the samosas on the menu, very crispy on the outside, and a generous amount of chickpea on the inside. The other menu items vary week to week, but I'm a huge fan of the lamb biryani (plenty of meat, and good flavor), the various chicken curries they have are very creamy with succulent pieces of chicken, the tandoori chicken is well smoked and very flavorful, and the rice is well cooked as well. For dessert, the gulab jamun is instant diabetes, but oh so good and worth the downgrade in your overall health! For those not in the know, it's literally a fried donut that has been layed in a syrup like concoction for hours. The result is a tender donut bursting at the seams with sweetness, and it helps that it's slightly warm as well. If you're looking to be health conscious though, the mango pudding is quite good.\\n\\nI know a main critique of this place is that it isn't authentic enough, but not being from India or having extensive knowledge of what's authentic as opposed to being a \\"poser food to appeal to the masses\\", I can't quite opine. But what I can say is that they serve very tasty food at a reasonable price, and every experience I've had has been phenomenal. The only bad thing I can speak to, is that I feel like taking long naps in the afternoon after eating here, but really, isn't that the pinnacle for a restaurant to strive towards?

But I've had great sushi at plenty of Chinese owned and operated spots in NYC/NJ.  Point of comparison in town: Ki-ichi, which is owned and operated by Japanese folks, was disappointing to me.

I came across Java Central, so I gave it a try.  The first time I was simply strolling around Westerville and decided to stop in for a coffee to go.  The people were nice, and the place seemed cool, so I thought it would turn out to be the place where I'd go to read, sip coffee, do some work, etc.  So I returned.\\n\\nIt was a chilly, rainy day the second time I went.  At around 9:30 AM on a Sunday, I wondered in with my bag of students' papers that I needed to grade and a little work for my own research.  I had thought of staying for maybe a couple of hours.  It was somewhat crowded, but I was able to grab a table in the back room before going up front to place my order.  The ordering process was much slower than on my previous visit, and it took nearly 15 minutes from the time I got in line (2 people in front of me) until I had my coffee in hand.  The woman making the coffee was obviously trying her hardest to keep up with the order, but a couple of other guys who work there kept coming to her with questions that took her attention away from the task at hand.  I had ordered what looked like a donut hole, which I ate as I was waiting for the coffee.  It was dry and bland.\\n\\nThe back room where I sat was full.  I won't say that it was full in a good way.  In fact, I wound up staying for only about half an hour because of the people there.  At the risk of sounding like a cantankerous old man, the people in that room were loud and obnoxious.  I know that a cafe is a place for people to meet and talk, socialize, etc., but a bit of decorum is also expected.  Two guys loudly talked about some party where they had drunk way too much, one mentioning in a voice for all to hear how much he had \\"vommed\\" the next day.  And two other guys talked rather openly about the size of one of their friend's manpart.  At another table was a guy beating the keyboard of his computer as if it were a 1920s typewriter, with loud rock music emanating from his phone and his fingers drumming the table when he wasn't typing; he was not wearing headphones, so everyone in the room could hear his music.  And at another table was a gamer who also had no headphones, so that I had loud music coming at me from one side and gun blasts from this guy's game coming at me from the other side.  At one point I got up and walked around the cafe to see if there were other tables in a different area free, but alas, nothing.  So I left.\\n\\nWould I go back?  The layout of the place and the decor make me want to go back.  It seems like a cool place to hang out.  Because of the loudness of the people that morning, I don't want to go back.  I got the feeling that the level of noise is normal for the place, but I don't know.  Maybe one day I'll go back, check out the noise and space availability before taking a table, and update my review.  We'll see...who knows."},{"name":"Terry Black's Barbecue","address":"1003 Barton Springs Rd","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"Brisket was excellent!! The macaroni and cheese was delicious.

She then explained that she would sit someone else on the far end on the other side so there will be some privacy, which also happened. But I wish there was for our own. \\n\\nOnce our meal came, I noticed that all the dishes had a very strong flavor, definitely on the salty side. I can understand for some of them such as the appetizer carabinero, it needs to be heavy because of the raw taste on the shrimp, sea salt can compromise with anything fishy. However, all the dishes were on the salty side, even the beef tenderloin, which caught me off the guard. \\n\\nMy biggest disappointment was the beef tenderloin. It's the main dish and was suppose to be tender and juicy, but when it came it was dry and salty. I didn't have any expectation for this restaurant as it was my first time visit, but I was not impressed by the boldness on the salty usage on each dish. I prefer to taste the natural flavor of the food, and incorporate with something that can enhance the natural flavor, not to cover it up with salt.\\n\\nIt is too bad because this place is highly recommended and rated on a high scale.

When you first walk in, you go up a long ramp and are expected to order immediately. If you need time to decide or read the menu, you feel like you're in everybody's way because the ramp also acts as a hallway for the servers delivering food to people sitting outside. The menu isn't also well located (they took down the giant board above the register containing the items), so you have to squint at a small menu taped up to the side of the cashier, which is also further back and promotes crowding in the ramp. The staff, while friendly, is not the best at mitigating or directing the line so the whole thing is awkward and unpleasant and you just feel like you're in their way or holding them up from doing their jobs. It's a bit of a mess and ruins the whole experience in general. \\n\\nThat being said, the burgers ARE good. Sliders are a bit overpriced for what their size, but the full size burgers are a good deal and will leave you satisfied.

The style of pizza is supposed to be a marriage of New York and Italian pizza styles. I liked the thin crust, but after it sat out for awhile, the crust became quite hard. The only thing I really remember about the pizza was how salty it was - the olives were really flavorful and outstanding, masking the taste of everything. My parents weren't able to take the saltiness, so I was left to finish the pizza on my own. And because the dough was so thin, it tasted like biting into a crisp but salty cracker.

Noch ein Bier, bitte!\\n\\nI have been coming here since living in the Pacific Northwest.  When I was living overseas I would come home once a year and I always made sure to stop by Otto & Anita's for my fix of German food. The greater Portland area has some good German restaurants but I prefer this restaurant to all of the rest.  The interior is nothing special but there a few murals including a long one of a small German town that I think adds to the atmosphere.  \\n\\nThe staff here are always polite and friendly and I think the last few times I have come we have had the male server.  All of their staff are constantly good and do check on you even when they are busy. Our server filled our water glasses and brought more bread several times for us.  \\n\\nBefore I go any further there is one item on the menu that you have to try.  They make one of the best versions of a dill pickle soup that I have ever had.  A cup is $3.00 and a bowl is $3.95. I have had similar soups in Europe but this is the best I have had in the USA. You might think it might be too acidic but it is not. Dill is one of the herbs that can overpower anything if not used properly but the soup has just the right amount of dill in it and the tiny pieces of pickle compliment the taste and texture.\\n\\nI have had many of the entrees from the menu and I would have to say that my favorite is the Rahmschnitzel. It is pork loin, flamed in brandy, with a cream mushroom sauce. It is served with spatzle, carrots and spinach. The sauce is just perfect and there is just the right amount of brandy flavor in it.  I would say I have probably ordered this item the most. I like spatzle so I am glad they have it on the menu as a side dish.  Another one of my favorite dishes is the Zigeunerschnitzel.  It is Pork Loin, topped in a \\"Gypsy style\\" sauce of red wine, paprika, peppers, mushrooms, and ham. It is also served with sp√§tzle and the vegetables. The use of the paprika is not overpowering and I would say they use the mild paprika, not the spicy kind.  \\n\\nIf you are not going to have the Shnitzels you might want to try the Wurst/sausages.  They have several types including Bratwurst (pork), Weisswurst (veal), Knackwurst (pork & beef) and Weisswurst (veal).  They also have a curry wurst with is a Knackwurst with a spicy curry sauce. I have had all of them and liked them all.  If I had to pick one I really liked the most I would have to say the Knachwurst was my favorite.\\n\\nI have ordered appetizers here before but I usually fill up pretty easily from the food here.  I like the large Bavarian pretzel appetizer which is freshly baked to order.  It tastes fresh made and comes to the table warm.  If you like fresh pretzels but don't like the frozen taste, you have to give it a try. \\n\\nFor dessert my favorite is the coconut cake but the German chocolate and the Black Forest cakes are also good.  \\n\\nThey are open Tuesday to Friday for lunch and Tuesday to Saturday for dinner.  They are closed Sunday and Monday.  Parking is always a bit of an issue so you may have to walk a block of two. \\n\\nIf you are in the Multnomah Village area give Otto & Anita's a try.

One time, the waitstaff came out to take drink orders in line. How cool is that when it's 100 degrees out? Most of the time I Favor Hopdoddy. The burgers are still delicious, even delivered. I'd recommend this place to folks who are in from out of town, as it's in a really cool part of town. I'd also recommend it to folks who want a juicy, relatively healthy burger and folks who want to try \\"impossible\\" meat. I tried impossible meat here for the first and only time. You can also get an impossible burger at Grove wine bar, downtown. But why not try it at a place that's known for amazing burgers?"},{"name":"Andiamo Ristorante","address":"2521 Rutland Dr, Ste 325","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"The overwhelming positive reviews for Andiamo leave me baffled.  Its possible I went on an off night and just didn't have the usual experience.\\n\\nLocated in a strip mall, the entry area is a bit small with diners waiting around the hostess and a desk area (that must serve as the \\"back office\\" for the restaurant).  Due to the popularity of this restaurant there is a wait, however, there is no option to get a drink or stand anywhere other then a cramped entry area.\\n\\nI made reservations for 8pm (granted call was made night of ).  I was not seated until around 8:30 and when I was finally seated it was not in the main dining room, instead in a function room separated from the restaurant.  There were only two other couples seated in this room, everyone could hear each others conversations; it was a bit over the top.  There was live music in the main dining room, there was silence in the back room.\\n\\nThe service was friendly enough, but waiter wasn't very informed on food and wine.  The food was just OK.  The real awkwardness came after we decided not to have desert.  The service dropped to sub-par and was just a fitting ending to a wasted night.\\n\\nI am noticing a trend in Austin.  It is very easy to spend in excess of $100 for a meal and get food that is on Olive Garden or chain restaurant levels.  With the Austin population growing, restaurants are getting away with serving overpriced food and offering service that does not equate with price point.. \\n\\n I have dined at four Italian restaurants in the city, three were way off (yet received great reviews on Yelp) and one (located on south congress) is excellent.  I do not consider myself a dining expert at all, but sometimes I think the Austin dining crowd completely misses the mark, especially when it comes to Italian food.  \\n\\nI usually do not write such long reviews, but Andiamo is one of many included in a frustrating trend of Austin restaurants that do not provide value."},{"name":"Terry Black's Barbecue","address":"1003 Barton Springs Rd","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"THE BEST BBQ I'VE EVER HAD!

Now, that giant cream puff dessert that you can add on? Do add that on. I got mine in caramel form, and that was exactly what I needed. That or vanilla are both solid winners.

They have options for everyone with their under $10 feature lunch entrees, $5 happy hour cocktails, buck a shuck oysters and 3 course West Coast dinners. From an intimate dinner for 2 to a work party of 200, in a private room, to socializing at the bar, there is an option for everyone!\\n\\nThis award winning restaurant has amazing wait staff, talented chefs, beautiful decor and a mouthwatering menu. My most recent visit was this past week to try their new featured items. From the drinks to the dessert, everything was delicious!\\n\\nWe had a chance to try their Fish & Chip cones, I'm a huge fan of sushi type cones so these were right up my alley, made with tempura code and Japanese tartar sauce. Then we had some chilli garlic prawns.... oooo so good, I love prawns so these glazed wok-fried massive prawns were delicious! Then we had some interesting Polenta fries there were served as an Italian style poutine. If your a fan of lasagna and sausage then you'll love them! Followed by that delectable lamb shank, it was melt in your mouth and served with some mint, onion and tomato quinoa. My favourite, the dish to gush over was the Lobster pot pie, it was the most delicious lobster, massive, and served on a broken down pot pie mixture of carrots, potatoes, peas, a buttery cream sauce and a soft puff pastry. Lastly we had the coconut banana butter cake. Can I just say... this was amazing! Hands down a new fav dessert is Vancouver, no wonder it's been on the menu for 11 years straight!\\n\\nWe also had a chance to try some amazing cocktails including the Alberni spritzer that was perfectly and refreshing for a hot summer day, love the St Germaine flavours that pop thru. The Sunset Beach was a delicious tropical choice with pineapple juice and Oakheart rum in a fancy coupe glass. The Vancouverite which was a play on a Chambers & gin sour, mmmm a fav for sure.

The place was close to full at 10:30 kn a Friday morning! The diner car is augmented with a lower level filled with booths ample enough to comfortably accommodate 6. Tables are marble and quite attractive. A turn-off for me was that knives and forks are clumped into aluminum holders and open on the table (how many grubby fingers might have touched that flatware before me?!). I would prefer the flatware be brought by the server and, ideally, it would be wrapped.\\n\\nWe each ordered coffee. The creamer was in a metal bucket on the table (warm) and we had to ask for spoons. Our server seemed upset by that request,  telling us they put stirrers in the cups (thin & wooden) and don't usually provide spoons. She brought one anyway. Two of us ordered the cinnamon waffle (no berries due to an allergy in the group) and the other member ordered chicken and waffles. We also ordered sides of bacon and turkey bacon.\\n\\nThe food was tasty-bacon crispy, waffles tasting strongly of cinnamon with homemade whipped cream. The chicken and waffles was an unusual variation: BBQ pulled chicken with a sriracha sauce and maple syrup (artificial-the real stuff is an extra cost). Not unpleasant, but unexpected.\\n\\nService was spotty and we weren't encouraged to linger over our coffee after our meals (intense stares from the waitstaff, in spite of the place having pretty much cleared out).\\n\\nOverall, a good meal for too much money.

My friend I brought here felt the same about the key lime pie. I don't even care if it's gluten-free or not -- both have tasted good.\\n\\nToday, I tried the savory shiitake mushroom + kale savory pie with a side of garden salad and it's soooo good. Even the garden salad has some proper dressing (not just limp leaves like some places do). \\n\\nIf you ever need a pick me up, get a pot of the aria tea -- even smelling the cinnamon and nutmeg-y spices will make you feel better.

I'm always down to try out different foods, so I was pretty excited to go.\\n\\nFood was decent. The suya was pretty flavorful and really good. The stockfish was SUPER SPICY (to me) - the spiciness stayed in my mouth for a good several minutes. I think the kind of pepper in Nigerian cuisine brings out a different kind of spicy than the kind I'm used to. I ended up not eating most of it. I got egusi stew with goat and farina fufu. It was interesting. Though it was strange eating food without chewing, I enjoyed trying something new. My Nigerian friend didn't like the way they made their food, but I'm not an expert on that.\\n\\nThe real problem was the service. I don't know why, but the waitress treated us badly from near the start. Maybe because we were a group of college students. I've never been disrespectful at a restaurant, and I always give 20% tips, but I guess there's some kind of stereotype. I'll expand on the details.\\n\\nWe asked for more water, and the waitress said sure and took the little jug. She never came back with water. We asked another waitress who was walking by and she also said sure. Then she went over to the bar and just started chatting with people instead. After it had been a good 30 minutes since we had first asked for more water, one of my friends was fed up and just walked over to the bar and ended up bringing water back to the table herself.\\n\\nMy friend had ordered a palm wine from the menu - $6. Apparently they had run out of the small $6 ones and only had large $12 bottles left - so they gave her a $12 bottle without telling her beforehand, and just added that to the receipt. What? Why would you do that without telling her?\\n\\nBefore that, one of my other friends asked what the wine's alcoholic content was, so the waitress grabbed the bottle and looked at it for a good minute. She told us \\"probably 5-6%?\\" Then she changed her mind and said \\"actually I think that one is non-alcoholic.\\" The one who had ordered it told her that she had wanted the alcoholic one. The waitress said \\"oopsies\\" and walked away. She came back a few minutes later and said \\"actually that one is 40%.\\" That was a BLATANT lie. None of us could even feel anything from drinking it. I don't know what the waitress was thinking.\\n\\nThe worst thing is that while she was neglecting us, we could hear her doing everything she could for the old white couple next to us. She sat down and spent time going over things with them and making sure they were enjoying themselves. It was a stark contrast to how she treated us. Whenever she came by us and asked if we needed anything, if we actually asked for something her smile would drop and she'd give us side-eye as she walked away. I don't even know what to think of her behavior - it was beyond me why she'd be rude to us when we didn't do anything to her.\\n\\nThe last thing I had a problem with was the automatic gratuity. It was my mistake for not noticing it until my friend mentioned it later on, and for tipping on top of it when I signed - but encouraging double tipping is slimy behavior at a restaurant IMO. Maybe she added it on because she was afraid we weren't going to tip after how she treated us. I'm not that kind of person, and I had wanted to get out of there ASAP, so I sadly fell into the double-tipping trap. It'll teach me to look harder at my receipts. She didn't give me a copy of the receipt, and didn't ask if I wanted one before she walked away.\\n\\nShe didn't say thank you or anything polite. When she came back to the register and saw we were still there (we were waiting on Lyft), she looked at us and said \\"bye,\\" as if to tell us that she wanted us to leave. I was thrilled to leave and I will never come back.\\n\\ntl;dr - Honestly I suggest staying clear of this place, but if you go anyway... Don't be surprised if you get inattentive servers, especially if you're a college student who doesn't fit in. Look closely at the receipt to avoid double-tipping. Apologies for the long review - service like this just upsets me."},{"name":"Fuji 1546 Restaurant and Bar","address":"1546 Hancock St","city":"Quincy","stars":"3.5","text":"Been to fuji a numerous amount of times, but never felt a need to do a review until I sat at the bar and Nhi served me.

While the momos had just the right amount of chew on the dough to have been executed perfectly, the Po Tsel was my favorite thing about the meal hands down.

The flavor of the braised pork was spot on, as was the texture from the mix of meat and belly fat.  The accompanying cabbage with rice and soy sauce egg (Taiwanese style) were also mainstays in our diet growing up.  So above all else, I must give Song La credit for this really well executed dish which seemed tailored to my palette.\\n\\nOn this trip I also tried the chicken bites.  They were served up piping hot with a flavorful crisp breading wrapped around tender chunks of both white and dark meat.  I liked them, but not as much as the braised pork.  They didn't benefit from the same nostalgic factor since my parents left deep frying breaded chicken exclusively to KFC. \\n\\nThe only downside to Song La was the wait.  They tried to give fair warning by saying up front how long it should take.  But the 25 minute estimate was off by a factor of 2.  So that's something to be aware of if you're running short on time.  But good food can take time, even food truck food, so I'll give them a pass on that."},{"name":"Gus's World Famous Fried Chicken","address":"117 San Jacinto Blvd","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"Once I heard a Gus's was opening in Austin I'll admit I got a bit excited. I had previously seen them on TV and couldn't wait to try them out! I spent the entire day leading up to eating doing research on the brand. I learned all the interesting stuff about Gus's. Learned about how no one knows the secret recipe and about how the spices for the chicken are premixed in Memphis and sent out to the franchise owners. Suffice to say I was ready for some chicken when I arrived!\\n\\nI had checked out the menu online and found it odd that they didn't have Greens listed as a side. I was a bit disappointed about that. When we started getting close to the restaurant I could smell the glorious odor of Chicken frying. I think that smell is probably one of the most beautiful things in the known universe. We walked in and were told we could sit anywhere we found a nice seat that was sort of out of the way and sat down. My table was a small bit moist from being wiped down but not so much that I would move or complain.  I grabbed a menu and started scanning it and low and behold it turned out the did have Greens on the menu after all. I will certainly give them some points for that. \\n\\nI also noticed they had a reasonable beer selection which was a very pleasant surprise. I got a 32oz Tecate and my girlfriend and I decided to split an appetizer of Fried Green Tomatoes. We also ordered the 8 piece meal and substituted Potato Salad for Cole Slaw.  I noticed on the menu that they charge you an extra 50 cents to substitute any sides. I think this is sort of shady It's not much money so its not a big deal but come on .. let me decide what sides I want with my chicken without charging me extra. It almost seems sort of petty.\\n\\nThe atmosphere in the restaurant was very comfortable, I went to the restrooms while we were waiting on our food and while they are sort of out of the way they were very clean. Nothing makes me happier than a clean restroom. I did run into an issue with the fake peeling paint that is applied to the walls. Our table was right up against a wall and if you touched the wall paint would fall off of onto the table. My girlfriends tea was too close to the wall and when I got up to go to the restroom I touched the \\" peeling paint\\" and some of it fell off into her drink. The waiter was quick to get her a new one and I suppose that since the restaurant is so new stuff like that is bound to happen so again no big deal.\\n\\nThe fried green tomatoes were delicious. They held up extremely well to the frying and were solid and tasted excellent.  The batter for them was spot on. We also got a very generous portion. It didn't take long before our chicken and sides came out. Everything was hot and both looked and smelled delicious. I went for the wing first and discovered it was juicy and oh so tasty. Next I moved onto a drumstick.. also juicy tasty and pretty much perfectly cooked. From there I moved into a thigh, dark meat is always my favorite so I expected the thigh to be the best part of the evening. It didn't let me down at all and was very very good and nice and juicy. So after having three pieces of chicken I was feeling rather full.. I had noticed the batter did seem a bit salty and I would have liked it to be a bit spicier. Most of the stuff I read about the Memphis location insisted that the chicken was spicy. I could hardly feel any heat or spice from the chicken. It was a great batter just a bit salty and could use more spice. \\n\\nSo even though I was full I decided to eat a breast. The chicken breast is usually my least favorite piece of chicken. That was not the case here. The chicken breast was large enough that it seems to dissipate the overly salty batter. Not to mention it was probably the juiciest breast I have ever gotten at a fried chicken restaurant. This single piece of chicken is what turned this into a four star experience for me.  I cant describe how wonderful this Chicken Breast was .. I just cant think of words for it.\\n\\nThe sides were horrible.. the beans tasted like Bush's Baked Beans from a can and the Potato Salad was bland.... I had left my phone in the car and ran back to get it and my girlfriend handled the order and forgot to order greens so I didn't get to try those, but I will return for that.\\n\\nGus's is probably at this point despite its flaws the best Fried Chicken restaurant in town. I think everyone should probably try them at least once. If you are thinking you might like it or you have any interest in Chicken give them a shot. I would recommend that you get a 32 oz Tecate, skip the sides and order the 8 Piece Snack. I hope that over time Gus's continues to work out the kinks in their system and becomes better and better. They certainly have tons of potential."},{"name":"Barley Swine","address":"6555 Burnet Rd, Ste 400","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"Very unique and tasty food.

The other people are just standing there talking to each other, probably making coffee if there is a coffee order. I think this is just a scam to make people think that this donut place is amazing when really they're just inefficient and they want people to wait in long lines. \\n\\nThe donuts overall are not worth the wait, they are not that particularly special if you've been to any other artist and donut places they have similar kinds of flavors.

The Chicken and Waffles is one of the best in Portland. The Chicken, itself, was very flavorful with the perfect amount of juiciness and crisp in every bite. We also enjoyed their Fried Chicken Benedict which consisted of two poached eggs, rosemary biscuits, gravy, hollandaise sauce and a side order of potatoes. The biscuit on its own was of perfect consistency, texture and flavor. But with the mouthwatering sausage gravy and Hollandaise sauce added it made it even more delicious. To add to our wonderful breakfast we also enjoyed excellently brewed Stumptown Coffee!"},{"name":"Phoebe's Diner","address":"533 W Oltorf St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"Not my favorite.

When the staff moved the tables for us all they did was huff and puff while doing it. \\n\\nEveryone in our party agreed that the food was subpar at best. We waited for almost 20 -30 mins for chips & salsa. The salsa could be compared to a mixture of H2O & tomato juice with no other flavors. The veggies in the fajitas were bigger than the chicken & steak (the parts that weren't burnt). The queso looked more like melted shredded cheese. No one liked their food. None of the food came at the same time and then the waitress couldn't even remember what we ordered when bringing the food out. The drinks weren't priced and we ordered 3 pitchers of margaritas which ended up being $19.99 each and the margaritas were horrible.

There will be no consideration of fads, or trends, or of the latest geographical whims here.  Ooooh, no.  This review will be based purely on bang-for-your-buck, and average gastrointestinal requirements (assuming you aren't achondroplasic).\\nThat being said, let's proceed.\\nMy evening at Barley Swine was on a Sunday night for dinner.  I was in town on business for one night only, and wanted an \\"Austin\\" culinary experience (one that didn't involve a truck).  \\nAnd I got it.\\nIf you were asleep in your Dallas/or San Antonio/or Houston home, and someone ran up behind you, blind-folded you, and transported you to Barley Swine--you would instantly recognize the ambiance as Austin.  Really great, actually.  Tucked into a plaza on what looks to an outsider as, \\"just another street\\" outside Austin, Barley Swine beckons.  Who could resist a restaurant with that name?  That MUST be half the allure.  That, and the patio, with plants and colored glass lanterns and teak wood furniture.  And inside the charm continues.  Comfortably dim, with a small lounge at the entrance, a bar, and regular seating options too; all with a view of the bustling kitchen, where colorful characters rush about, creating magical concoctions.\\nIf it were all about the preceding dining accoutrement, I would give it 5 stars.\\n...but it's a restaurant.  And so I can't.\\nFirst, I didn't realize it was a tasting menu, and no one told me as I ordered a pasta and squash dish, that these wouldn't be enough.  Having been listed as \\"$$\\" on some website or another, I expected my dishes would leave me slightly full, but with room for dessert.  \\nLet's start with my vegetable. My $6.00 squash was a slice of a small roasted butternut squash.  Now, I prepare these wonderful things each Thanksgiving, so I'm no stranger to butternut.  But this squash must have been smaller than any I've ever purchased to begin with, and, as I said....it was just a slice.  Including the center, and a charred exterior so unappealing I sacrificed the precious calories and cut off the edges. The mesquite bean mayo and toasted seeds it rested atop were flavorful, but couldn't atone for the bland squash itself, nor could it  assuage my stomach rumblings and wonderings about the whereabouts of the rest of the vegetable. Do they buy one butternut squash an evening to supply the whole restaurant?  If so, they're making a KILLING.  \\nSpeaking of making a killing, a glass of sauvignon blanc will set you back about $16.00.  Let's be real.  You know that whole bottle is worth about $11.00.  \\nMy next course, the $12.00 shiitake pasta, was much larger--about 4 hearty bites.  These were ravioli's, and they were very good.  No complaints about this course, other than the fact that I would have loved more.\\nLastly, my dessert, also very good, the $8.00 cornmeal pudding with carrot sorbet.  I really wished this were a normal place where we didn't pretend to not like to ingest food, because this was a great combination of flavors, textures and temperatures.  \\nSo.  $50.00 later, I left with hunger pains and shame over being the fool who stands among the crowds, pointing at the emperor and exclaiming about the beauty of his new clothes.\\nCan someone please show me where to get dinner around here?  I'm not sure where my money went, but I sure am hungry..."},{"name":"Whole Heart Provisions","address":"1350 Massachusetts Ave","city":"Cambridge","stars":"4.5","text":"If you're looking for fresh, healthy and delicious food that never disappoints, look no further.

Tried the chili garlic naan bread, it had a really nice spicy kick to it and the garlic flavor was very strong which is always a plus for me.  The Shrimp Vindloo was instantly one of my new favorite dishes.  Large, plump shrimp and a super flavorful reddish curry sauce with potatoes in it also.  The rice they give you is the perfect texture and they give you plenty with your entree.  I have eaten inside Cumin as well and we always get good service and excellent food.

Bummer. \\n\\nOddly, my burger was extra greasy, leaving a puddle of oil on the tray liner. To make sure I wasn't exaggerating, I compared it to my friend's liner and sure enough, hers only had a light oil stain. \\n\\nSince they've only been open a couple of weeks, I'll chalk it up to that. Hopefully they settle into a groove soon. \\n\\nThe Pluses: They seemed heavily staffed to handle the Perimeter lunch time rush. My order was timely and correct.

It has all the usual fixings you'd expect at a Chipotle, but let's break it down:\\n\\nPARKING: World's smallest parking lot. It will be a challenge to find a spot during primetime hours but I've always managed to find one eventually. There's also street parking available right behind the restaurant on one of the side streets, so it's not too terrible to drive here.\\n\\nFOOD: My experience here with the food is usually pretty good, definitely what you'd expect from a Chipotle. No complaints about the quality or taste.\\n\\nATMOSPHERE: Again, pretty typical for Chipotle. More space inside than you'd think based on the size of the parking lot. It's also usually pretty clean in here in the dining area, and the condiments station is typically well-stocked and I've never had to hunt down a plastic fork or napkins from the cashier.\\n\\nSERVICE: This is where I dropped my rating a couple stars. Having worked at a quick service restaurant for almost 6 years, I have a pretty solid understanding of how they should be run. This location is always hit or miss. For example, tonight's experience -- one of the younger employees had his AirPods in while working the food line this evening. As you'd expect, this did not go well since he's required to hear what a customer is saying as part of his job. While he was putting my burrito together I asked for \\"regular steak\\" (instead of the new carne asada) and then watched as he piled my tortilla high with chicken. I then told him I asked for steak and he said, \\"No, you said chicken.\\" I corrected him and said, \\"No, I asked for regular steak.\\" Without saying another word, he smirked and remade my burrito. Annoying, but whatever. Then... I hate sour cream, so I don't ever get it on my burritos. Unfortunately, there was a huge mess of sour cream globbed onto the food counter. While Air Pod Kid was wrapping my burrito, he pushed one end of the shell all up in this nasty mess of sour cream just sitting on the counter. Thankfully, another employee saw what he was doing and made him wrap it with different aluminum foil (since that, too, was covered in sour cream). I was reluctant to ask them to remake my burrito a THIRD time, so now I'm stuck with a burrito I don't really want because it's a mess of old ingredients I don't enjoy.\\n\\nBy the time we left, Air Pod Kid had taken the pods out of his ears, presumably because the experiment of working with them in was a disaster for me and it was obvious to his fellow staff members. Not super psyched that I was the guinea pig for that experiment, nor should a kid that arrogant and lazy be customer-facing.\\n\\nWill I let it stop be from coming back to this location? Probably not. Chipotle is Chipotle. This location just needs to up its standards for staffing, especially because the one in Midtown has an AWESOME, super friendly staff that puts this location to shame."},{"name":"Terry Black's Barbecue","address":"1003 Barton Springs Rd","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"I really like Terry Black's.

A filling inside or mixing passionfruit with the batter might have made them heavenly.  The Mexican chocolate was good but best when warmed up.  But then the frosting melts!

And if I thought there was a lot of head-nodding during the \\"appetizer,\\" there were significantly more during the main entree itself.  I was torn and admittedly wanted to get one of everything.  I settled on the Tagine and absolutely loved it.  Sausage, poached eggs, olives - all so complimentary of each other.  My boyfriend got the Les Boulettes and loved it just as much.\\n\\nI absolutely love brunch, especially those outside your standard pancakes-and-eggs, and Medina Cafe went above and beyond to exceed my expectations.

I pointed this out and asked if he would rather we moved to another table to accommodate our fiends more comfortably and he said no. No one understood.

My family had the pleasure if Kathleen waiting on us-she was absolutely wonderfu!! A gem. But in speaking with other members of staff-they were delightful too!! Family feel-yet very impeccable service. Lamb chops. Dad is a meat eater and he enjoyed every succulent bite. Shoestring potatoes were crispy and well seasoned. Halibut.  *swoon*. Crusted. Moist. Potato leek gratin is my new bff. Seasonal eggplant and zucchini parmesan. Simple high quality ingredients make it a fresh-from-the-garden subtle dish which was sublime. Watermelon feta salad with mint was the perfect balanced ode to summer. Dessert-cobbled peaches. The peaches were the star-not overwhelmed with sugar or custard. The bread pudding was my least favorite, but that's not saying much negatively as everything was outstanding. Oh-appetizers! Lamb meatballs with crispy chickpeas and yogurt. Artichoke ravioli. Both delicious and well seasoned. Get them. Both. This establishment focuses on customer servious, professionalism, special experience with all the elegance, but none of the stuffiness. They seem to care more about the quality if the dish...and experience. The chef utilizes techniques, the quality of the ingredient, and practices much restraint to provide the patron with a perfectly composed symphony of flavors that satiate whilst seducing you to wish you had One. More. Bite. This has become one of my absolute new favorites.  What a special place with special food and special people. A shout out to the wonderful and hardworking valet!!!

The food is, as the marketing correctly claims, authentic as hell and equally delicious. The atmosphere is intoxicatingly welcoming and intimate, especially when live music is invited inside.\\n\\nOver time, my enthusiasm to go there was eroded by the sheer fact of its location. I respect their history and their patch of dirt. It's appropriate that it is a bastion of the German Village community.\\n\\nHowever.\\n\\nTrying to get a table on busy nights, and a place to park nearby if you have to drive, is a drag. The wait time is also obtuse. I get that these detriments are an earned accessory to success, but the cost-benefit i'd bearing them as the years wore on out weighed my desire to attend. I brought friends from out of town there for special occasions, but limited my patronage to moments in time like that.\\n\\nThen the big H came to town. Hofbr√§uhaus. The Bavarian juggernaut set its roots in Grandview, with parking to spare. It's food was just as good as Schmidt's, including the beloved Vanilla cream puff. The atmosphere is electric there too, and just as welcoming.\\n\\nNot even the buffet could push the scales back to Schmidt's for me.\\n\\nBecause of all of this, I will always give \\nSchmidt's my vote of approval, but unless they find a way of making enjoying the experience worth the price of my personal time, especially when there are similar and better options, I don't think it has the luster it once did.\\n\\nPS - The food truck is dope as hell and the best thing they've done in years."},{"name":"Wild Chix & Waffles","address":"7714 Burnet Rd","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"I wish I liked the waffles here.

Plow burger uses the beyond burger, so you are getting that authentic burger flavor. They have 2 standard burgers and one rotating special each week. I've tried the 2 standards and 2 of the specials; the standards are GREAT and the specials were good, but I think the flavor components of each needed some work. The banh mi special I tried, for instance, lacked the sweet/sour component of a bahn mi and the chicken fried steak burger's components, (mashed potatoes, collard greens, corn) needed to have more seasoning. Their buns are a bit tough and throw off the burger to bun ratio and they really should add bacon as an option for all burgers. Don't get me wrong though, these are things that can be worked out in time and Plow Burger still delivers!

Located in the lobby of the Woodlark Hotel. Very friendly staff, seated right away, inviting decor- we were off to a good start. The menu seemed limited and I'm not a huge BBQ fan so I thought I was going to leave the meal pretty disappointed, but the flavors in the food surpassed any expectations I had. Here's what we tried:\\n\\nDay Boat Albacore Tuna: Recommended by our server and one of my favorites of the meal. This was above and beyond what I've tried in other restaurants. There were so many delicious layers of flavor. It was truly outstanding. I don't expect this to stick around the menu for long seeing that summer is sadly coming to an end and peaches are one of the ingredients, but I hope to see some other incarnations of this dish with the coming seasons.\\n\\nSmoked Beets: Also delicious and highly recommended. I usually shrink away from smoked flavors (really why am I eating BBQ?) but the smokiness in this dish was a really nice new take on beets and the whole thing was delicious.\\n\\nFried Chicken: We were told it's only served on Sundays. Once again I'm that one weirdo out there who's not a huge fan of fried chicken, but as a testament to how good this was, I found the chicken delicious. Maybe I'm not a fan of bad fried chicken? At any rate the meat was tender, the sauces accompanying the chicken were delicious and I loved the watermelon salad and cornbread that came with the chicken. I also imagine the watermelon salad is a seasonal thing (too bad it was awesome), but I'm excited to see where this dish heads with the upcoming seasons.\\n\\nSlow smoked beef rib: This was my least favorite of the night, but I'll preface that by saying I'm not a huge fan of red meat. The beef rib was cooked nicely, but for my own personal taste it was greasy. Once again, I'm not the right audience for this one..\\n\\nMushrooms: I liked the break from the meat and there were some really interesting flavors in the dish (a bit reminiscent of Indian food). I probably wouldn't order this again, but it was good.\\n\\nDessert: Skipped it. Too full and was feeling guilty for being so gluttonous and polishing off two daiquiris (very good), in addition to the meat o rama listed above. The Texas sheet cake was not on our menu for the night, otherwise I would have totally ordered it and sucked up the calories.\\n\\nSo I'll say this. This restaurant was delicious and I am the last person who would normally praise BBQ joints. The food was flavorful and the service and drinks were excellent.

I don't know about anyone else, but I don't like having to cut my pizza myself.  It is annoying and more difficult than you might think.  ASIDE from that, the pizza tasted fine.  Also delivery was within the hours it said it would be.  The fries were hard to explain, but they had this almost crystallized texture to them and the taste was way off.  The spinach cal zone looked good, but the way it was made or packed had the cheese practically oozing out in liquid form and made it very unappealing.\\n\\nThe only thing that was good about this place was my pizza, but I can't even give it the star it deserves for taste because it WASN'T CUT!!  Is this on purpose?  Is this a step that pizza places are skipping these days to cut costs?

Phoebe's Diner recently opened in Sept 2017 and now is serving breakfast and lunch till 3pm.  The location of this place is in the heart of 78704, so for the people that live in this extremely high rent area of ATX, it is in walking distance for many.  I will say, it seems already inherited into the community.\\n\\nPhoebe's Diner enters into the very competitive Austin breakfast market.  Many people know that for Saturday & Sunday mornings, breakfast is highly sought out for in this city.   If somewhere in Austin has good breakfast, the place is usually packed and you will have a wait.  It is a hot breakfast market if your restaurant follows the popular formula.  First off the location of Phoebe's diner is in a small strip mall near a Texaco gas station.  There are parking spots but not many, so hopefully you can get one.  The venue itself isn't very large.  It is a long and narrow rectangle style restaurant.  Rent in Austin is quite disgusting and I can imagine for a restaurant the same rule applies.  Phoebe's Diner is certainly using every single bit of square footage they have available.  Right when you walk in, there are tables on each side.  There is a small booth to put yourself on the list.  The only waiting area is outside so if it is a cold day in Austin, you better be ok waiting outdoors.  The venue has roughly about 18 different booths/tables.  If you are larger than a party of 4, your table options are limited, so put that into account.  There is about 8 stools available to eat at the counter.  Waiter service was attentive, friendly and informative.  \\n\\nNow onto the stuff that actually matters is the food.  I posted a few photos of the 1 page menu.  It certainly follow the style of a diner menu.  You have mostly breakfast options with a few lunch choices.  You have typical American style breakfast, migas, Phoebe's benedict, breakfast burrito, pancakes, french toast, biscuits & gravy, and even the option to get 9+ hour smoked brisket. I asked the waiter, said the head chef was big on brisket, so he has his own personal smoker behind the store.  I ordered Phoebe's breakfast and swapped out ham for bacon.  I was encouraged to stick with ham, but that's just not my style.  Eggs were quite well cooked and fluffy.  Holandise sauce was very light.  Bacon is actually pork belly as other described.  It is certainly a thick cut of bacon.  I did not like the hashbrown casserole at all!  Onions didn't go well with it, and just not the perfect mix to the breakfast items.  I did not try any pancakes, but certainly looks like you can customize them how you want.  This place makes excellent thick fluffy biscuits.  It went well on this item.  Menu has all sorts of drinks such as coffee, cappuccinos, espresso, teas, juices, beer/wine, mimosa and so forth.  Also what would a diner be without the pie of the day.  \\n\\nThe menu prices are fair for the quality of food and service.  This place is already known by locals in the near by areas, so expect a wait if you come during peak hours.  I had different opinions on visiting Phoebe's diner.  First I always enjoy to see any new spot come into the very crowded and busy Austin breakfast spots.  Secondly, I think the minimal square footage of the restaurant is a minor inconvenience.  I would see waiters constantly have to navigate around each other because there is simply very little walking space.  Place is certainly noisy, but if it is a diner, shouldn't that be already assumed?  It is also hard to fully judge a place on just ordering one item from the menu.  I try to base more my ratings on food quality than the locations, service, or decor.  However they still factor into the overall Yelp score.  I have gotten to experience a lot of different Austin breakfast spots.  The low key mexican restaurants, the long time breakfast places, and then the fancy downtown breakfast for the people that live in downtown and dont mind shelling out $20-30 on FREAKING brunch.  To each their own, everyone has different tastes.  So where does Phoebe's Diner fall into all of this?  My review is 4/5.  Good food, creative menu, small sized venue, and attentive staff.   There was just a lot more I was expecting out of this place and only some of it delivered.  Don't worry, this place looks like it will always be busy and packed.  Phoebe's diner is a good new breakfast addition to south ATX, but I'm not sure it belongs on a top 5 breakfast spot list."},{"name":"Shan-A-Punjab","address":"500 Harvard St","city":"Brookline","stars":"4","text":"My go to place for Indian food delivery, their kadhai paneer is my favourite,  I their peshwari naan and Mysore masala dosa too."},{"name":"Navarre","address":"10 NE 28th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Went for dinner with the wife .

I didn't care that it was 942 degrees out, that's the one food I have to have when I go to Baby's because their soup is the best. The nachos were, well, nachos. Nothing about them was awesome, or bad. \\n\\nOther folks seemed to be happy with their dinners, but they were also knee deep in Purples. JS \\n\\nService was slow, but we had a big table.

A quick read of the bulk of my reviews wouldn't give you a clue of this deep secret. My love for all things adventurous, comforting, and confit belies my whole grain upbringing. Obviously, while I may be well beyond the punk-rock rebellious days of my youth, I'm still in mid-knee-jerk rotation on my culinary-rebellion - enjoying all the things I was denied as a child. But that doesn't mean I deny my soft spot for delicious, nutritious, healthy, local, natural food, and surprisingly, I have a hard time finding it in Portland. \\n\\nI've lived in this town for going on 10 years, and that entire time I've been hurting for an honest-to-goodness juice bar. I'm not talking about a place like Blossoming that has a couple of juice options, or a Jamba Juice or some other fruit-and-powder-and-ice-cream-heavy smoothie place. I'm longing for something reminiscent of Gravity Bar in Seattle, where you can mix and match a grip of different veggie and fruit juices, wheatgrass, ginger, garlic, protein powders, spirulina, and all sorts of other crazy healthy and empowering ingredients and basically get a cup full of amazing. \\n\\nI finally found something that comes close - and it's a cart outside of People's Co-op. Carrot beet celery with wheatgrass and garlic? Oh hell yes. Apple and other fruits available? MMm hmmm. Ability to get your drink in an actual glass if you're headed inside to do some shopping or you want to hippie-out on the dirt bench nearby (who builds dirt benches in the PacNW anyway?!)? Yup. While Sip isn't the end-all be-all for juice options in this world, as far as Portland goes, it's 5-star. The prices run around $5 or $6 for a 16oz cup of juice. This is significantly less expensive than spots like Blossoming (which can run upward of $8 for one of these) and offers more than straight carrot/beet or some other basic juice. \\n\\nSo when I get that yearning to add some nutrients back in to my diet, I can drop by Sip and get my... uh... sip on!

Located just one block from the main Robson drag, it is a dessert hotspot that opens for the breakfast crowd at 7 a.m. and closes with the drunk and stumbling at midnight every day of the week.\\n\\nNamed after acclaimed ma√Ætre p√¢tissier, chocolatier, and chef Thierry Busset, Thierry is a Vancouver institution with a sweet reputation for handcrafting petits fours, Viennoise, cakes, tarts, macarons, and exotic chocolates. They do it all in a setting that is equal parts cafe, shop, and atelier.\\n\\nAcross a handful of visits I tasted several macarons, cookies, chocolates, and shared a raspberry yuzu tart. The tart had the appearance of a classic French tart, not surprising since Chef Busset hails from France and learned the art of patisserie from masters in Auvergne and Loire Valley. However, the twist was in the ingredients. What would normally be sweet pastry cream was instead a yuzu sabayon filling which delivered a tart note, reinforced further by slivers of ginger and contrasting well with the slightly tart, slightly sweet raspberries beautifully arranged on top. Holding all of this together was a sugarcane base instead of the more traditional shortcrust pastry shell, hard and crumbly rather than hard and flaky. As a dessert it was delicious and unique.\\n\\nThe Breton, a butter cookie with sea salt, was as expected richness galore juxtaposed with salty notes. The chocolates here, meanwhile, are made in small batches in a temperature-controlled room viewable from the front of the house. They may look delicate and small, but they're rich and filled to the brim with both classic and unique fillings. My pick of pistachio (of course) featured dark bittersweet chocolate on the outside and was filled with white chocolate, pistachio, and gin, taking the ordinary and making it anything but.\\n\\nHalf orders of caramel and hazelnut 'liquid chocolate' were decadent and indulgent but thinner than I expected. I could barely discern the caramel flavor in mine. Overall the drink was less rich than anticipated, which may have worked to my advantage considering the richness of everything else I consumed.\\n\\nThe macarons here were decent but definitely denser, not as sweet, and not as chewy when compared to Ladur√©e, the macarons by which all other macarons are judged. To their credit, Thierry's flavors seemed to veer away from some of the more traditional ones--no pistachio, rose, or vanilla here, for example, but you will find coconut lime, lemon, and lychee. Fruit-flavored varieties have a buttercream center while others are filled with ganache, such as the salted caramel and matcha ones I tried.\\n\\nAs a venue, Thierry is both modern and comfortable, but my biggest gripe about the place is that it needs to be twice as big to keep up with demand. There are only a handful of tables inside and outside on a covered patio so if you order your dessert or drinks for here, chances are you won't be able to sit down to enjoy them. Entire groups congregate for hours in the trendier-than-Starbucks setting and even if a table miraculously opens up, it's not bussed so you'll need to eat with someone's trash and dirty dishes in your face. The entirety of the staff seems focused on taking orders and making drinks.\\n\\nThierry's popularity is partially due to the aforementioned extensive hours. While other popular dessert-centric places such as Ladur√©e clock banker's hours, Thierry is open late like any number of patisseries, gelaterias, and cafes in Europe where the night-life scene is about socializing without an alcohol-focused itinerary, unlike the USA. Much like Juliette & Chocolat in Montreal, Thierry evokes a classic Parisian vibe and is simply a chill place to hang out.\\n\\nIf you've been to Vancouver you also know that the city has the highest population density in Canada with over 5,400 people per square kilometer and is the fifth-most densely populated city with over 250,000 residents in North America, behind New York City, Guadalajara, San Francisco, and Mexico City. Unlike sparsely populated city centers where people merely work and then flee town leaving it lifeless and deserted after hours, metro Vancouver is bustling at all hours of the day and night. Thus core businesses like Thierry serve not only tourists but also the abundance of people who live in the heart of the city.\\n\\nThierry is well worth a visit for a morning cappuccino and croissant, a leisurely lunch, or a post-dinner dessert and drink indulgence. The myriad options within bring a bit of Paris to Vancouver, but just keep in mind you might not be able to enjoy any of it sitting down."},{"name":"Phoebe's Diner","address":"533 W Oltorf St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"I was looking for a good local option for breakfast while visiting Austin and boy did Phoebe's deliver!

It's advertised all over the store, but yes, their dough is made from a French brioche recipe, their eggs are all from happy chickens, and their butter and other ingredients are organic and top-notch. I'm not usually one to care for these things, but I can taste the difference. My body reacts differently to this difference. And I'm definitely willing to pay more and wait in a shorter line for this difference. \\n\\nNow, I don't love every single offering here. The more exotic stuff is a little beyond me and I think the ingredients shine best in Blue Star's simplest creations: Cinnamon and Sugar, Glazed, and Valrhona chocolate crunch. With that said, there is an exception: the Cointreau Creme Brulee, which is one of the $3 fancies (and also my husband's all-time favorite). It's already perfect by being custard-filled and lightly glazed on the outside, but Blue Star decided to attach a little pipette of cointreau (French triple-sec) so that you could not only taste heaven, but enter it as well. The husband likes to inject the ENTIRE pipette's contents into the donut before eating; I prefer a tiny squeeze, bite, tiny squeeze, bite, etc. Your mileage may vary but your experience of a donut this delicious will not.\\n\\nSo yes, 5 stars it is. We ate here every morning while we were in Portland and bought a dozen to bring back with us so that we can continue this morning ritual of Oregonian magic.

I've been to the Food Truck two times, first time for a sweet Donut and second for a savory one and was very impressed. Great size for the price, not too sweet, and creative concoctions. So today my friend(foodie) and I went for lunch.\\n\\nWe got there 10 mins before open and waited on the patio. Once we entered I immediately got an ice coffee and she got a Mimosa. The coffee was brought to me in a huge Mason jar. I fell in love immediately. We literally couldn't decide and stared at the menu for a good 35 minutes before we decided we needed an appetizer to hold us until we could make a decision. We got the The Big Cheez which was basically Mozarella triangles that were deep fried in Doughnut Dough. DELICIOUS! I liked dipping it in the Garlic Butter and my friend loved the Cilantro Buttermilk Dip. \\n\\nAfter our appetizers we ordered. I decided to do the Phat Club because I love Club sandwiches and it's on a Doughnut. My friend got the El Camino Dougnut burger. The food came out fast. All I can say was...it was great. The donut wasnt sweet and was a perfect vessel for the club. She tried mine (and ordered one to go lol) and I tried her Burger. I look the Doughnut dun, beef, avocado, cheese, and crispy onions. Only thing I could say was the meat tasted bland. I'm a Chef and didnt taste salt and pepper which I felt was needed for the beef.\\n\\nWe were halfway done and surrendered and got boxes. She ordered another Mimosa and a Club sandwich to go. I ordered a Pudding Donut to go. The check was around $65 together. Which wasnt bad at all. We got one Iced Coffees, 2 Mimosas, An Appetizer, A Doughnut Burger, 2 Doughnut Clubs, and a Dessert Doughnut.\\n\\nThey are revamping their Brunch menu, which is what we wanted. So we will definitely be back to try more on the menu.

Bacon was an extra $0.95, they also had a veggie burger, which was housemade. The veggie burger was definitely better than I anticipated. I did not like that they used processed cheese but otherwise the food was good. I did have to pay an extra $0.20 for onions which was weird to me but worth it. They also have milkshakes, which is an upcharge as well as well as the lemonade, which is an upcharge too. It definitely didn't taste like fountain lemonade so I'm pretty sure it was homemade. It was a little thicker than I'm use to having. I would still prefer Chick-fil-A milkshake but it is still pretty good. Their fries were amazing. And I was very surprised at just how good it was.

Lots of candles on the tables, dark woods, and soft, warm light.  Very cozy, indeed.\\n\\nWe were looking for something we could both munch on, so we opted for the nachos.  HOLY CRAP.  The serving size is ENORMOUS.  I could not believe how large the nacho plate was.  If we hadn't been going somewhere immediately after, we definitely would have kept the leftovers, of which there were plenty.  The only downside that I could see was that there were no meat options for the nachos.  I didn't realize this place was vegetarian only, which is totally fine, it's just that I wish I had known in advance.  Next time I will adjust my expectations accordingly!  With that said, the nachos were absolutely delicious despite my desire for meat.\\n\\nOur server was very nice, and quick to respond to any requests/orders that we had/made.  Overall, this place is a really cool little addition to the neighborhood.  Super chill environment, great food, and a pretty sweet location.

They really pay attention to detail with their decor and their staff seemed nice. While we were not blown away by their espresso or iced latte and the nutella banana waffle was good (though easily reproducible at home), there is no question I would return. However, as many other reviewers have mentioned, their pricing is a little out of whack. Again, they do an exceptional job with their space, but they are still in a strip mall with neighbors like Walmart, Sonic, Anytime Fitness and Panda Express. Across the street you'll find Taco Bell and Subway. Plus, they are on burnet, which, while up and coming, is not Downtown, S. Congress, or S. Lamar.\\n\\nTheir house-made Pop Tart is a novel idea and I'd be lying if I said I wasn't a little bit intrigued and interested in trying it, despite the fact that I never liked Pop Tarts as a kid (way too chemical tasting for my liking) and I wish they had more than one flavor, but $5 for the pleasure? No thank you. At the same time, if this were NYC, Chicago, or LA for example, situated in a hip spot, I wouldn't blink at the price. Austin is great, but I feel many would agree that the trajectory of restaurant pricing here has gotten a little ridiculous relative to the city, no? And here we're talking about a cafe and you don't even order from a human, but from a tablet.\\n\\nAnyway, I look forward to coming back, but probably won't be making an appearance all too often.

So if you're a meat lover, you'll be pleased. But be warned: you get what you paid, and if you paid $25 per person for all you can eat meat, expect lower quality meat. That isn't seasoned. And comes as a slower pace than you'd like. And of which you are cooking on your own (but I mean, assuming you're a KBBQ veteran, you probably have an older Korean male in your party to cook your meats). \\n\\nAs for the all you can eat sushi, it was a hit or miss. There's no way to order specific rolls, so you have to watch the conveyer belt constantly, and if you're trying to figure out what fish is in the cooked rolls, good luck, because nothing is labeled. Lots of nigiri options though, so if you like just straight up fish (not that great of a quality, but you can tell it was frozen, so you don't have to worry too much about food poisoning) and rice, you're in luck.\\n\\nOh, and banchans- you get them from the conveyer belt as well. We saw a lot of salads, cheese rice cakes...and that's it.\\n\\nNow if you like not interacting a whole lot with a waiter, I'd say this is the place for you, because you place all your orders through a tablet. And what little interactions you do have with a person is extremely pleasant. But if you're looking to eat good meat and sushi, go somewhere else.

Prior to this dinner, I hadn't eaten Indian food in over a decade. I was never really into spicy foods and once my Indian friends from home stopped having parties, we (the fam) never really went out for it. Plus most of my life in Jersey was pretty much TV dinners, chain restaurants, diners and mama's home cooking when I was lucky. \\n\\nBringing in the granny cart that was used for art transportation, the waiter said it would be cool if we left it in the front doorway. He seated us in the corner with a perfect view of both the on street shennanigans and the Indian music videos (close tie to Korean music videos in awesomeness). Throughout the night, the waitstaff was very nice. One even apologized for calling us 'you guys'. Ms. AT and I ordered some samosas for an appetizer and then I got the lamb coconut korma (I don't remember her dish.. I'm a bad date). Both of us got our entrees mild. The samosas were good although they were super hot (temp), so I was doing a series of nervous bites instead of actually letting them cool down and savoring them.The korma was probably one of the most delicious dishes I've had in awhile. In fact, I've been on the hunt for a place that makes it that is closer to my current apartment but to no avail (so far I've seen India Palace). Portions big enough for two, I had the other half wrapped for my lunch the next day.. already daydreaming about when me and the coconut would meet again. Tender meat, just the right amount of sweetness, and some very good rice (into the next day as well). My brain, stomach, and eyes are mad at me right now for even talking about how good the situation was. \\n\\nIt was pretty late for dinner on a weeknight so there weren't a lot of people, but I definitely wouldn't mind waiting in line considering the quality of the food is fantastic. The lighting was a little dimmer than I (and my almost quarter century eyes) would have liked, but otherwise the restaurant is rather clean and very welcoming.

Not only was service perfect, but the food was all super delicious and the prices were reasonable.

They get quite busy at night, even for an early dinner. However, their bar seems to be open for walk-ins if no tables are available. The inside is very quaint and what you'd imagine a French bistro to look like. I also think that the ambiance is quite  romantic as well.\\n\\nPork rilette ($10): This is an excellent appetizer to share. It came with a huge portion of pork rilette spread, some pickled veggies, mustard, and crostini. There was so much pork rilette we used the rest on the fresh bread on the table (which was also very good).\\n\\nSteak frites ($23): I had this medium rare and it came out cooked perfectly, sliced, with herb butter on top. The butter was slightly tart. This was so good! I asked for a side of salad instead of fries, and I found this to be a great lighter pairing than fries. It was dressed with a creamy but light dressing.\\n\\nVeal Shank Parmentier ($23): This was probably our least favourite dish of the night. It was a veal ragout with mushrooms and spinach, on a gravy sauce, and a mashed potato on top. There was cheese melted on top of the mashed potato. It was pretty good, but quite a heavy dish and not quite as flavourful as it could be.\\n\\nChocolate fondant with passionfruit marshmallow ($9): The cake was so decadent with crispy notes on the bottom, and it matched well with the creme anglaise on the plate. I didn't think that the passionfruit marshmallow matched, but it was good on its own.\\n\\nNear the end of our meal, the host came by and offered us a digestif each, because earlier I had asked for a table closer to the inside since I could feel the draft from the door. None were available, which was fine, but it was a super nice and thoughtful touch to offer us port wine to warm us up! It was a tasty end to our meal.\\n\\nI remember the dinner I had here last year was also excellent. The French onion soup and canard confit were both really good. I would pass on the escargot, though, not because it wasn't tasty, but because it wasn't the baked kind.\\n\\nOur waiter was always attentive and checked on us with each course.

Both of our salads were below okay. When the salads came out we we're served bread with a side of homemade pesto. The bread was good but the pesto was the real winner. Now onto the main dishes. My husband ordered cheese ravioli. The sauce on his dish was better than the ravioli. I am a vegetarian and ordered Alfredo pasta with onions and broccoli. When my dish came to the table it was loaded with onions and no broccoli. The sauce was plain, had no flavor and was over powered with the amount of onions. My pasta was so bad after four bits I stopped eating it and shared my husband's dish. For dessert we shared a teramasui which was amazing and I would have eaten it as a main course.

I mean, I've never even heard of this and I was tripping out watching all the people in the weirdest outfits ever.  I mean, there was a centaur people!  So I simply HAD to sit on a patio and watch this spectacle.  Free entertainment!\\n\\nWhen I walked in I smelled yummy Mediterranean food and was sorry that we hadn't blown off Azio and gone straight here to eat.  We asked to be seated on the patio and ordered wine.  Our waitress was friendly and eager but the language barrier made it where we just laughed and nodded at each other a lot without a definitive clue if she understood me.  But hey, I got my wine, so all was good.\\n\\nLooked like this place had a food menu and maybe also a buffet inside too so would definitely give the place a try.  The music they were blaring on the patio was interesting - at one point it was like Muzak and then it was Steely Dan.  And it just kept getting louder and louder.  Until the belly dancer came out and then the music was positively EAR SHATTERING!  However, the belly dancer was fun and she caused a lot of people to gather round the patio to watch.  I felt a little uncomfortable when she would stare and dance in front of me though because I couldn't stop staring at her belly button to see the brand she had there and also she smiled and stared in the most awkward of ways.  Kind of like if a guy serenades you singing with a guitar - where do I look?  I feel very awkward.  Anyway, I digress.\\n\\nSo overall this is a great patio to enjoy on a nice evening, especially when you are into the people watching."},{"name":"Nueva Onda","address":"2218 College Ave","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Nueva Onda hits the nail on South Austin Bohemian Funky AND is one of my very favorite Mexican breakfast joints.

I have been to this place a handful of times since they opened but went most recently last week shortly after meeting the brew master, Jason.  I decided to walk here on a very cold but sunny January day.  Jason was in, so I asked if he had time for a quick tour.  He showed me around the brewing facility and gave me some good info about the brewing process.\\n\\nAfter the tour, my boyfriend and I grabbed a seat at the bar to warm up with a couple of beers.  I started with the IPA which is a great standard!  My boyfriend started with the oyster strong ale.  That's not something I would order, but he loved it.  We placed an order for food since we were pretty hungry after our 3-mile walk.  I had never ordered food during any of my previous visits so I was salivating for the burger seared in duck fat.  Can I just state that this thing was pretty epic.  This is one of the few places where the chef can actually cook the burger to the ordered temperature (medium rare for me) so that is always a huge plus.  I ordered mine without onions & pickles but added cheddar & bacon with a side of fries.  These additions made it a pricey burger ($16 with the fries) but worth every penny.  I was surprised to find that I loved the hop studded roll.  Guess it was a good thing I had an IPA to complement the hop flavors on my burger bun and the hop sprinkles on my fries.\\n\\nThe fries are also pretty damn good.  Crispy shoestring fries with a house-made ketchup.  No complaints here.  While I was chowing down on my half-pound burger, my boyfriend was warming up with a steaming bowl of hunter stew made with ham hock, duck confit, venison, wild boar, and white beans.  He thoroughly enjoyed it but wish there had been more meat and slightly less beans.\\n\\nWe were pretty full at this point, but could not pass on ordering a second round of beers since all 20oz. pints are just $3 on Wednesdays.  My boyfriend ordered the oatmeal pale which fascinated us since you see oatmeal stouts but not oatmeal pales.  Very tasty.  After consulting with the server, I decided to try the Permafrost since it's their first winter brew and a seasonal selection that will be gone soon.  And it turned out to be a great suggestion.\\n\\nI am definitely looking forward to moving to the east side of town which will put me closer to Burnside so I can come in more frequently for delicious beers.  And also to splurge on an amazing burger once in a while."},{"name":"Clay Pit","address":"1601 Guadalupe St","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Clay pit is a staple and the food is consistently good.

This time I went with sweet and ordered blueberry syrup on a plain waffle with a side of crispy bacon.

I'm celiac so I'm not in the \\"gluten free\\" bandwagon but it's nice now to reap the benefits of said movement. \\n\\nThe noise level is still high, eating outside is still an option and for a quieter experience I'd recommend that.

For me, personally, the best two were a close tie between Passion Fruit Cocoa Nib and Raspberry Rosemary -- not too tart with just the right amount of filling. \\n\\nIt's also super visually satisfying to stand by the counter and just watch the donuts getting glazed, mmmm. FYI - they sell a predetermined number of donuts per day so individual flavors can run out or they can also just sell out of everything and close early.

You are not in your grandmother's favorite restaurant. (But if your Granny is as hot as mine is, she may soon gravitate to Myers & Chang instead of her traditional Beacon Hill favorites.) \\n\\nThe menu is incredibly friendly for any type of eater, from the traditional to the far out. Are you a vegan? A vegetarian? Are you gluten free? You can come to Myers & Chang and eat alongside all of your friends. You won't stand out in the crowd or be limited to salads or a simple pasta dish. You will be taken care of. If you have questions - \\"Can that dish be made without pork?\\" - just ask. The answer is usually yes. \\n\\nThe spice factor here is totally on fire. You will not need to shake out large blobs of bottled hot sauce onto these dishes. Come prepared for serious heat waves in your mouth. Fortunately, they supply you with ice water and cool drinks to douse the fires. We love the Lime Rickey, but some people may find it a tad too sweet. \\n\\nWhile the servers promote the fact that the plates are best shared and that things are tapas style, the portions are really big. Two or three would be fine for a couple. When two of us order four different dishes, we end up with a vast array of leftovers. No complaints there. The bright pink bag filled with individually packed remnants makes us very happy later on at home. \\n\\nDan dan noodles, fish tacos, and the rice bowls happen to be favorites in this household. Desserts include amazingly unique pies, cakes and even pavlova. All are heavy on cream, butter and sugar. Walk it off or get to the gym tomorrow. \\n\\nWe love Cheap Date Nights on Mondays and Tuesdays. (Don't have a date but going with a pal? You can always join other diners at the friendly bar where you can watch the food being prepared.) \\n\\nWhen we came for our first visit, the staff was especially welcoming, engaging us with helpful comments and questions about our visit.

The chocolate lavender didn't have a strong lavender taste, but half way through our waffles, we were feeling adventurous and mixed both sauces and we were left wishing we did that for the entire waffle.\\n\\nI can't remember what drinks we got but they were so well made that we spent the first half our delicious meal wondering if they remembered to add alcohol to our drinks, and if we should ask about it. Good thing we didn't because near the end of the meal, we knew there was alcohol in it (thank to asian glow).

However, there is some morsel of truth to it. \\n\\nI come from the Northeast, where barbecue is lacking, greatly. There are some advertised spots that are the 'best' barbecue around, but until I went to Austin, I was ignorant to what barbecue really is. Forgive me, but I haven't been to the south often enough to experience real barbecue.\\n\\nMy friends and I went to this place after spending the day in the park, a truly excellent end to the evening. The best thing about this barbecue spot, is the ability to order by the pound, and watch them cut it in front of you. I had potato salad and mac and cheese picked out, and then I made it to the meat cutting station. As the staff cut the meat in front of us, it was truly awe-inspiring, an act of true magic. Each time the fork pushed into the pork, juices exploded. Let's forget about everything except this meat - what really set it apart from anything I had ever tried, was the high-content black pepper crust that made the exterior of the meat taste like nothing I have experienced.\\n\\nI won't have barbecue again until I come back, there is no point otherewise."},{"name":"Tope","address":"15 NW 4th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"Stayed at the hotel where this is located (Hoxton, super cute boutique hotel) was looking for some food and a beer, I decided to try Tope which is located in the rooftop.

And man, oh man, what another great decision [apparently all my decisions are excellent..!]. Harissa is a chili pepper paste that added so much flavor and level of heat to the dish. I'd say everything was cooked perfectly for me. [Look at my picture... it's a gorgeous display of deliciousness].  While ordering, the waitress told me that they soft-scramble their eggs, and asked if I was alright with that. I'm really happy she let me know ahead of time that it was a thing - because I definitely need my scrambled eggs dry. They were very happy to accommodate. \\n\\nWhat I do love about this place, is that they use fresh and local ingredients. This is always a huge selling point for me. This is what I especially search out when finding places to dine. My travel companion didn't care as much about this aspect, but even agreed with me that Bijou was his favorite place we ate during our time in Oregon - and because of my great choice, allowed me to pick all future places we ate [High Five, Team Stephanie!]. \\n\\nAs we were leaving, I saw that they have live Jazz bands on Friday evenings during dinner.

Less time wasted after your order has been cut. Terry Black's sides and desserts are some of the more impressive of the Austin BBQ scene by the way. I enjoy their Mac and cheese and their peach cobbler in particular is really excellent. Many central Texas bbq places turn their nose to sides, but I see no reason why to. Their great! And they compliment the meal with some non-proteins.\\n\\nBut oh those proteins....Terry Blacks hits the mark on all of them. The brisket, the pork, the jalape√±o cheese sausage.....the BEEF RIBS.

Based in such a quiet part of town, the hipster ambiance of the little restaurant fits perfectly. \\n\\nSeating is fairly limited. However, it makes up for this with community-styled tables where you can sit with your friends or meet new faces. The kitchen sits right behind the counter giving off a very inclusive vibe that makes you feel at home the second you walk through the door. \\n\\nThe food is portioned and priced fairly well. About $10 for a sandwich. The meat on my sandwich was extremely fresh. I could tell I wasn't just eating some regular preservative-filled deli sandwich. This stuff is the real deal. And, to make that more clear, I watched as they prepared the full chunks of meat behind the counter. This place is special.

The servers and bartenders were outstanding. Unfortunately the manager on duty had an attitude problem with a group of service industry workers spending money in the establishment. Several of my coworkers were already there when I showed up, and had been eating and drinking for about an hour. We had a large group, around 15. The bar was packed so we had to alternate between the bar and a table that was close to the bar. A few people ordered food from our server, and also tipped her on the side for taking up her space because on top of that because that is how they make money! The manager informed her that we could not order from her and the bar. He also approached several people in our party and several others who were watching a football game and said something to the effect of, \\"you can not curse in here\\" after someone said \\"shit\\".  Correct me if I'm wrong but you can say whatever you want and that right is stated in the constitution. There were no children or families in the building. Plenty of drunk girls with skin exposed hanging on men at other tables which I think is way more offensive but he didn't ask them to put on a jacket...lol. He then proceeded to tell another person in our party that she couldn't order another drink. He also had words with a few more guest that weren't with our party. It's been a minute, so I can't remember his name, but I think it might have been a Chris possibly. My party of 15 apologized to the bar staff that they had to work in such a hostile work environment, and left to go spend our money at Sports and social a few steps away and were welcomed with open arms where we spent about 1000 or so collectively. Not sure what his issue is, but you need to leave your personal life at home and not bring your bad attitude to work where you take it out in guest and your staff. As a manager of a restaurant, and veteran of the service industry, I would never hire someone of that character. He cost the establishment revenue and continued revenue because I and my friends had all eaten here before, but never will again. That type of attitude is a liability, and causes low morale among staff, and is certainly off putting to those of us who know what goes on behind the scenes in a restaurant.

Talk about an UPSELL.  \\n\\nOther notes: \\n\\nDon't park in the parking lot. It's not only small, but cars ordering takeout park all over the front of the building, blocking off most of the main road. Park across the street in the bank's parking lot - plenty of parking there and no traffic nor mindless, selfish takeout folks who idle there vehicles at will, anywhere. \\n\\nSmall size is not small. Small size can easily feed 2 people. \\n\\nFountain drinks are good for 1 refill only \\n\\nDon't expect good service and don't expect management to give a damn. This place has become very comfortable with itself and with the regular diners and takeout folk and couldn't care about your displeasure. \\n\\nGood luck trying to find someone in charge. Never seen a manger in three visits \\n\\nThe food is cheap but  good. \\n\\nThe place is closed on Mondays. \\n\\n\\nBottom line: \\n\\n\\nIf service is important to you at all, pass on this place. If you don't mind lousy service, this place is good for cheap Italian food.  Perhaps take out is the best play."},{"name":"Cappy‚Äôs Pizza & Subs","address":"82 Westland Ave","city":"Boston","stars":"2.5","text":"Quite possibly my favorite establishment in the Fenway/Northeastern area. To start, the staff is fantastic. They are super friendly no matter how busy they are, and remember customers' names and favorite orders. \\n\\nThe pizza is great when you want a big cheesy slice late at night or on a lazy Sunday. The steak sandwiches are huge and delicious (made fresh), and I seriously recommend the curly fries. Food comes out quickly, but if they are busy it is best to call ahead or place an order online for pickup. The drunken college kids fill the place up from about 11pm-close. \\n\\nMost importantly, their hidden gem, coined Cappy's \\"world famous\\" froyo. Now ladies and gents, this froyo has earned that title (though I would love to work for whatever world organization gives out that award) and does not disappoint. You pick vanilla or chocolate and get to choose off their huge list of mix ins. They blend the toppings right in for you, and for less than $5 you have a huge pint of delicious, heavenly, life-changing dessert. I am convinced that they also put a highly addictive substance in to the mix, or maybe I just have poor self control. \\n\\nLast week, I was bed-ridden and sick, craving some of that frozen gold, so naturally, as a 20 something girl, I tweeted at Cappy's. I let them know that I wasn't feeling well and really wanted some froyo, and they hand delivered it to my apartment, free of charge, wishing me well. I consider myself a regular here, and will continue to spend all of my hard earned college cash on Cappy's. They are like family to their customers and we are lucky to have them."},{"name":"Santarpio's Pizza","address":"111 Chelsea St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"Sorry, but I fail to see the big hoopla with this place.

But now, it's not as clean in my opinion as it should be (I \\"gladly\\" witnessed a patron washing his fingers on the water jug and the waiter takes and who knows who gets some of that lucky water.) There's no friendly greeting, just order (hurry, or you'll get a glare) and bam, your food is there in 15. The pizza used to be less runny and without all that cornmeal at the bottom.

The primary argument here is that they have great coffee but limited space for seating, and they get crowded.\\n\\nIt's a coffee shop in a walkable neighborhood, they get busy it's a fact of life.  I would rather wait 15 minutes for a coffee here than some of the 15-20 min waits I have had a Starbucks!  The coffee is superb with something for everyone from a company with a passion for coffee!\\n\\nThe space issue is somewhat of a fair point but I spoke to one of the managers one time and they not only want to be a coffee shop but a place that retails primo coffee brewing stuff so you can enjoy good coffee at home. I'm sold on an aero press and many of the other merchandise they have is not stuff you will typically find in place where most people buy home brewing stuff.  Moreover they have a fantastic selection of coffee beans that they will either grind for you or sell you by the whole bean and you can grind at home, plus if you buy a pound they will give you a coffee beverage on the house.  I know in today's world we all want the convenience of a Starbucks with 100 tables and couches to work in, if you want that there is a Starbucks down the street, if not and you'd prefer a spot with a nice patio to grab a cup of coffee then Dancing Goats is your place.  \\n\\nThe people are genuine and helpful and have a passion for coffee.

They put a lot of work into rebuilding and decorating the place, so it is easily the nicest looking bbq joint in town- All brick wall, beautiful solid wood dining furniture, dim lighting in the evening, huge HDTV monitors. A very nice place!\\n\\nMy partner and I came here on a Sunday night after seeing positive reviews on Yelp. The restaurant wasn't very busy, most likely due to the cold and wet weather. Our server sat us at a table of our choice and informed us that the only menu items they currently didn't have were the chicken wings. I heard their smoked wings were delicious so that disappointed me a little. \\n\\nFor dinner, we ordered two BBQ plates consisting of brisket, pulled pork (comes with bread to make into a sandwich), and spare ribs.We opted for the macaroni & cheese, and brussels sprouts as our side dishes. BBQ plates are also accompanied with a jalapeno cornbread muffin.\\n\\nThey have four different kinds of barbeque sauces to choose from. Two of the sauces are at the table and your server should offer you the other two, or dependeing on your server you may have to ask for them. My favorite of the four barbecue sauces was the white bbq sauce, which kind of has a citrusy flavor to it. \\n\\nAll the food was very good and met the high expectations I had based off of reading other Yelp reviews. The portions are a nice size and I left stuffed. Definietely no room for dessert.\\n\\nOur server was a really cool guy and very attentive to us the whole time.\\n\\nI will definitely be back here to support this local business.

We ordered a selection from the menu, including the Ribeye, Duck, both fish and chicken tacos, pork belly rice bowl, plantains and cucumber salad. My repeat order was the rice bowl and the plantains. The pork belly is charred but not dry, and there's a light vinegary sauce that accompanies the brown rice and julienned vegetables in the bowl. Filling and cheap!

Big mistake. All we could taste was the overpowering lime juice. I understand it wasn't something on their menu but the bartenders should understand how potent that lime juice is before dousing our drinks with it.

The shake was very sweet and caramel-ly, if you're into that sort of thing.\\n\\nI ordered the Primetime Burger and an order of the Kennebec Fries.  The burger patty itself was thick and juicy.  The flavoring infused into the beef was average but not great. I have a salty tooth and I tend to judge rather harshly on that criteria.  The bun held the Kobe beef and fresh toppings nicely.

It also seemed like it was about to fall apart. Like many small restaurants, this is one area that could use some work.\\n\\nI opted to try a shrimp tempura roll for appetizer. I noticed there was a sushi chef out front of the kitchen that I believe made my roll so I am sure it was fresh. It was nicely done with pickled ginger and wasabi on the side. I was very pleased with the quality.\\n\\nI also decided to have some sake with my meal. Ordered a small sake and asked for it cold. Surprisingly it came out in a nice little glass flask with a special inner bubble that held ice to keep it cold without diluting the sake. It provided 5 or 6 nice little shot glass fulls which ended up being plenty of sake unless you are a heavy drinker. I think because of the flavor, this sake might have been better warm. I asked for it cold so my mistake.\\n\\nFor main dish, I chose the sesame chicken. It came out very nicely prepared. The chicken was in small and thin pieces, coated in light breading and very crispy. It was lightly covered in a sesame sauce. The dish also had some steamed broccoli, a sliver or two of steamed carrot and zucchini also. A white rice pilaf was provided in a separate bowl.\\n\\nThis was very delicious and very filling. The sauce had the a bit of sweetness to it but not too much. It actually didn't have the heavy sesame flavor I had expected though but still good. The portion was very generous.

I am sure it is added to any bill that uses a discount because often people think they should only tip based on the final price after the discount is applied which is not correct. You should base the tip on the total value of the meal before any discounts are applied. The server is being charged 12% in tax based on that total sale charge and not your discounted price. Leaving anything less than 12% of that total sale price costs the server money and many are not happy with those discounts because of this. Ask any server and most will agree that these discounts often cost them money in their pay. I am betting this 18% is added to avoid this for those people that don't understand so that the servers are compensated accurately."},{"name":"Terry Black's Barbecue","address":"1003 Barton Springs Rd","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"I am not going to lie.

Patience has never been my strong suit, and I absolutely despise waiting for a table. Unfortunately, there are lots of yummy restaurants in Boston that don't take reservations, and Orinoco is one of them. What I've learned is that if it's a great meal you're after, sometimes you just gotta suck it up and deal.\\n\\nAfter a recent mouth-watering ROTD, I decided to take my mom to Orinoco for a late night (late for us being 8 o'clock) dinner on a Friday night. The hostess estimated the wait to be somewhere around 45 minutes for a table for two. Ugh. Oh well. We walked over a mile to get there (no small task for a 52 year-old chronic smoker), and there was no way we were turning back.\\n\\nThis was clearly the right decision, as a spot at the bar opened up no more than ten minutes after we got there. And let me tell you, the bar at Orinoco is where it's at. From this vantage point, you can watch the amazing (and amazingly sassy) bartender display her virtuosity with a muddler and a pair of mixing cups.\\n\\nAnd the food--well, if you're as indecisive as me, you're going to have a lot of trouble deciding what to order. Everything looks that good. Whatever you do, make sure you get the bacon-wrapped, almond-stuffed dates. They're sweet, salty heaven. \\n\\nOrdering the empanada trio is a good way to try a little bit of everything (two of three were hits, the fish selection being the exception). I didn't particularly enjoy the pork arepa, but this may be more a matter of personal preference than anything. I simply wasn't a fan of the taste or texture of the corn cake. I'll have to try another elsewhere before I can truly judge.\\n\\nAs far as entrees are concerned, I'm under the impression that you really can't go wrong. We had beef (the asado negro) and fish (pistachio encrusted mahi mahi), and both were divine, not to mention reasonably priced.\\n\\nDessert, while cheap, is the only thing that really leaves anything to be desired. The molten chocolate cake was really molten, so molten in fact that it may as well have been pudding. It probably needed another textural component (and a scoop of ice cream) to really bring it together.\\n\\nIf you've made it this far, thank you and congratulations!

The jajangmyeon was okay but not the best I have had. I am not sure there is a place in Austin with good jajangmyeon (black bean sauce with noodles).

With most of the wedding party being their first time there, we thought it will be good for them to smell the bbq and see the pit so Terry Black's it is.\\n\\nWe got there at about 12:30 and the place was packed.  It also took us a while to find parking too as we have about 5 cars and the parking lot there is pretty small.  After we all finally found parking around, in the restaurant we go.  \\n\\nWe have about 28 people... so you can imagine the headache of getting seats.  How this restaurant works is that you have to get in line, get your food, then find a seat.  They will not let you sit down until you get your food.  So the only way we were able to do this is to sit out in the patio.  There, you can save the seats before you get the food. I love the concept, but if someone is already in line and know they are getting 2 large family meals to feed everyone, they should be able to sit down. (minus 1 star for that)\\n\\nWe opt for 2 large family meals.  One with all brisket and the other with all pork ribs.  Each family meal came with 4 large sides. \\n\\nThe briskets were fantastic... and so were the ribs.  The kids loved the mac n' cheese and corn.

There is also a bar on the patio.\\n\\nWhen you enter the side door, there is a sign directing you to the bartender for ordering.  You order your food and drinks there.  You can pay or start a tab, and they'll pour right then.  If you order food, they hand you and number on a stick to put on your table, then they bring the food, served on small trays, to you.  There are bussers walking around removing empties.  Their goal was to keep the traditional biergarten style versus being serving customers once seated.  This is fine, but I suspect when very busy, the line to the bartender gets very long and prohibits proper flow of service.  Beware too of ordering food, then finding nowhere to sit.  I've heard there will be heaters placed on the patio for use through cold weather.  \\n\\nI did not order food myself, but did have a taste of the Alsatian Flatbread my mom ordered, and it was amazing.

Suffice to say I could just leave it at that ... but ...\\n\\nI had been wanting to dine at Les Faux Bourgeois for some time, the concept intrigued me and then there were ALL the rave reviews but I had never quite got around to making a reservation.  So my partner, who is french, decided to surprise me with a dinner there for my birthday.  When he made the reservations, well in advance, he mentioned that it was a birthday dinner.  I was excited to finally try out the restaurant I had heard so much about and on my special day too!\\n\\nWe arrived on time and the table was not ready, okay these things sometimes happen especially when you choose to dine a little later.  We stood and watched while they rushed the people at \\"our\\" table to pay their bill and leave ... I almost felt bad ... When we finally sat down at a very tiny table in the middle of the room it became obvious that we were going to be constantly jostled by the servers as they wove their way around the tables.  You would think that when someone makes a reservation, stating it was a special occasion they would make an attempt to seat you at a decent table ... but never mind ... it did really resemble a cramped french bistro style which I suppose is part of the \\"charm\\".  It was a happy evening for me so I was determined not to let anything spoil the feeling!  I thought if everything is as good as everyone was saying the location and size of the table was not important.  Unfortunately the table was probably the highlight of the evening :-(\\n\\nOur waiter ignored us at first and following that was arrogant and dare I say flippant.  Maybe he was going for the stereotypical french waiter persona or maybe he was just havin' a really bad day ... but it wasn't cool.  The food, except for the salad, was less than mediocre and given all that I did not find the prices anywhere near as reasonable as everyone has been saying.\\n\\nMy partner ordered the onion soup and the signature dish, Steak Frites followed by the chocolate cake.  I ordered a salad, the Truite followed by the Creme Brule.  We splurged on a decent bottle of wine and had a digestif with desert.\\n\\nThe appetizers took absolutely forever to arrive and when they did the onion soup, which was less than inspired, was almost cold.  We were halfway through the appetizers when the waiter showed up with the main course.  He seemed really put out that we had not gulped down our appies in anticipation of the early arrival of the main course ... There was no room on the tiny table for both appetizers and main course plates so we told him just to take away the appetizers which he did.  My partners steak which he had ordered bleu arrived medium rare and the fries were very disappointing, my trout was over cooked and mushy.  We should have sent both the mains back but being a celebratory dinner neither one of us wanted any tension or to create a fuss.  When we laid our knives and forks down there was almost as much food on the plates as when they arrived.  The waiter never mentioned it or asked if anything was wrong.  Dessert then took as much time to arrive as our appetizers had earlier.  The chocolate cake was not too bad but the creme brule was awful.  I should mention that creme brule is my absolute favorite dessert!  The sugar had been way over brule'ed and was bitter, the creme had a weird texture and was tasteless.  Then we paid the bill which was not cheap.\\n\\nAll in all a bust.  Luckily it was soooo bad that we actually had to laugh about it.   You know if it had just been the service that was bad and the food had been awesome I might have been tempted to give this restaurant, which has rave reviews, another try but given that the food was so disappointing as well they will not be seeing me again!"},{"name":"Gem√ºt Biergarten","address":"734 Oak St","city":"Columbus","stars":"4","text":"Met friends for an early dinner. Gem√ºt has several pluses going for them! A few minutes that could use a second look, however. \\n\\nThe indoor space, while quite small, is decorated nicely. The bar was a decent length. Bright white walls and lots of light coming in the large front floor-to-ceiling windows. The dinning area holds something like six or eight tables. All were used when we showed up, tho. \\n\\nThe ordering process is like a true biergarten - stand in line, order, given a number, then find a seat; they do not employ waiters/waitresses to tend to a group of tables. When your foods's ready, runners bring it to you. Luckily, we managed to walk in and get in line before the rush. I could see this becoming an issue when the colder months set in, especially on the weekends, because as people que in line, the space becomes over-stuffed. \\n\\nYou walk past the brewing equipment to head out back. The outdoor patio area is very nice. It's so nice having the cloth draped overhead to block the hot sun. You can also order from the stand out there, but, once again, come cold days, no one's gonna wanna freeze there ass off in the name of authentic German beer and food. Word is they're working on getting electric heaters out there, but it'll depend on how powerful they are, something to block the cold winds, etc. \\n\\nMy observable annoyances somewhat subsisted after trying their food. I ordered their classic Bratwurst plate, which comes with your choice of side; I picked their Kartoffelsalat (German style potatoes). Very good! The pork sausage was juicy and tasted great. The potatoes were a very pleasant surprise - the bacon vinaigrette (the perfect amount!) was rather, well, addictive! I'd definitely get this traditional meat-and-potatoes dish again. \\n\\nPrices are reasonable. Cleanliness was not an issue. Will the ordering/seating issues come to a bubble? Time will tell.

In my opinion, it should have been comped and put in a to-go box for her for the inconvenience and not being able to eat her food at the table.\\n\\nI was extremely unhappy with my experience there and my food.  I was a little too excited when I got to leave my \\"you've been yelped\\" card on the table."}]`),j={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:M},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:6,poemsData:E,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.poemsData.filter(n=>{const e=this.searchQuery.toLowerCase();return n.name.toLowerCase().includes(e)||n.city.toLowerCase().includes(e)||n.text.toLowerCase().includes(e)}).slice(0,this.visibleCount):this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(n=>setTimeout(n,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},R={class:"search-container"},N={class:"card-container"},O=["disabled"],H={key:0},D={key:1};function F(n,e,s,f,i,r){const u=p("PoemCard");return a(),o("section",null,[e[3]||(e[3]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"üéâ Restaurant Reviews ü•≥")])],-1)),t("div",R,[e[2]||(e[2]=t("span",{class:"search-icon"},"üîç",-1)),b(t("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=h=>i.searchQuery=h),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[v,i.searchQuery]])]),t("div",N,[(a(!0),o(y,null,m(r.filteredPoems,(h,g)=>(a(),k(u,{key:g,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),r.hasMorePoems?(a(),o("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:i.isLoading,onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=(...h)=>r.loadMore&&r.loadMore(...h))},[i.isLoading?(a(),o("span",D,"Loading...")):(a(),o("span",H,"See more"))],8,O)):w("",!0)])}const G=c(j,[["render",F],["__scopeId","data-v-61b2dfd9"]]),V=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"drive/49.md","filePath":"drive/49.md"}'),L={name:"drive/49.md"},Y=Object.assign(L,{setup(n){return(e,s)=>(a(),o("div",null,[I(G)]))}});export{V as __pageData,Y as default};
