I have ordered it twice now and am already craving it again. Instead of feta I get mine with blue cheese, I add shrimp, and get the ponzu citrus dressing. That is the best salad dressing EVER, I must get my hands on the recipe. I've had a lot of different menu items - stuffed chicken (which is also very delicious, just rich so I don't always want it), the trout (decent, not super special), Greek salad, California chicken sandwich, burger, pasta, and buffalo pizza. All are good but none have left me as satisfied as the Ensalata Especial. \\n\\nThe ambience is great, very casual. The porch is awesome during warmer months and in the winter they have heaters. I personally think they could make the porch even better by giving it true walls on the sides and maybe one big screened in window instead of the plastic tarps, would make it just a little nicer. \\n\\nAll in all I give Treehouse 4 stars now that I've found the best salad ever (would have been a 3.5 before)."},{"name":"Grass Skirt Tiki Room","address":"105 N Grant Ave","city":"Columbus","stars":"3.5","text":"This time under the guidance of our server, I got the navy grog and pork egg rolls.

About 20 minutes later, the server came back and told us the kitchen would now be closing at 11:15.  We ended up having to order on our friend's behalf.

The Original Dinerant fit the bill. We arrived about 5p on a Friday and only a few tables were occupied; we were seated right away. When we walked in, my friend - who loves Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives on The Food Network - immediately saw host Guy Fieri's drawing and signature on the wall, so she decided to look up what he had eaten at the Dinerant and order that. Our server was very friendly and easygoing, knowledgeable about the menu choices, and he interacted very well with the kids.  We had two appetizers:  1) the buffalo wings, which were large and just the right amount of spicy, and included celery and chunky blue cheese dressing, and 2) the donut sliders, which were surprisingly good cheeseburger patties served on buttermilk donuts, topped with a sugar glaze.  Even though the kids ordered off the children's menu (they have a children's menu, yay!), their portions were very large.  Two kids ordered a breakfast (served all day) of scrambled eggs, hash browns, and toast for $6 and couldn't come close to finishing. The other had the children's hamburger, which was full-sized and came with fries.  My friend and I ordered the fried chicken and the meatloaf; both were tasty, although my friend noted her chicken was slightly dry (luckily she prefers it that way).  Drinks were refilled promptly and dirty dishes were quickly cleared away. The desserts looked delicious, but we were all too full to eat any. (Currently, if you \\"Check-In\\" at the Dinerant on Yelp, you receive a free piece of pie!)  Our bill came to $99 plus tip, which, considering we were in downtown Portland, was very reasonable for five hungry eaters and drinkers (the kids and I drank soda, while my friend had two \\"well-made\\" White Russians).

It's fish, it's fresh and they cook to order. Preston comes back and tells me that they I can't have the trout because all of it has already been marinated in or has butter on it.

The Parmesan grits are creamy and perfectly seasoned. The egg sandwich is very good. The staff is very helpful describing the different cakes, pies, etc. They cut the pieces of pie, cake, etc. when you order so they are much fresher than Piece of Cake who pre cuts their slices and puts them on the rack. The layer cakes and cheese cakes are beautiful. There was a steady flow of traffic for dessert even though it was before lunch time. We saw several people order the Chocolate Red Velvet cake. They said they come in every week for a slice because it's delicious. One customer told us the Amaretto Butter cake was excellent, she had it for her wedding. They had samples of the Key Lime cake and Coconut cake and both were tasty.  I got a slice of Key Lime pie for later. It was good but on the tart side. One of my friends got the Golden Chocolate cake and it was beautiful. The cake was good, the frosting was very thick and creamy. One friend got the Apple Pie and it was delicious. Very light and flaky crust and the apples were seasoned perfectly. The slices are huge, about twice the size of Piece of Cake's slices for the same price. Easily enough for 2 or 3 people. I will say of the different cakes I tried the frostings were on the sweet side but I tend to like more tart things.  The cake was moist. Everything they had was so fresh and appealing.

As someone with a variety of food sensitivities, it's hard to find a place that has delicious desserts- gluten free usually seems to equate to \\"chalky nothingness,\\" but not here. I enjoy their gluten free brownies and lemon pound cake at my neighborhood coffee shop, but always love dropping by to pick up a cake at their bakery for special occasions. Southern Sweets is a family and friend favorite too- their cakes always get a lot of compliments, even from certain individuals that usually opt for gluten-y full dairy versions. That's a difficult feat to accomplish.\\n\\nI personally have never had any problems with their cakes (and we've had many different kinds), but we always opt for calling an order in. I previously worked at a European cafe that ordered cakes from several bakeries around town and this was my experience in that situation too. As is the case with any \\"order by the slice\\" dessert situation, cakes should (and will with Southern Sweets) be fresh- less than a few days old and stored at appropriate temperatures. As far as dipping a knife in water to cut them goes- this is pretty standard practice with desserts, it ensures a cleaner cut typically. To get the freshest cake- order one! You won't be disappointed.\\n\\nAs far as prices go, I find them quite reasonable considering the quality of their ingredients and the fact that their goods are made in store by hand. Sure, less expensive, bigger slices of cake can be found elsewhere- but if you look at the ingredients, I doubt that you can find many that stand up to their standards. If you're gluten free or vegan- this place is especially a gem with a diverse menu that so many can choose from.\\n\\nOn top of it all, the staff has been amazing and kind every time we've gone in or called the past four years we've gotten a cake for birthdays, holidays, and graduations.

I love goat cheese and ordered the pizza just because it had goat cheese and figs on it. plenty of figs, but barely any cheese. The mac n cheese was far from what you'd imagine mac n cheese to be like. It wasn't rich and creamy and goopy like mac n cheese should be. The sauce was thin and barely coated the pasta.

I got the small portion of the peanut butter cup, and the size is pathetic. Good, but pathetic. The bread pudding is different than bread pudding I've had, but it wasn't bad. It's more like a saturated, soggy spongecake. Sounds gross, but with the caramel drizzle and ice cream topping, it passes.\\n\\nI am extremely disappointed.

I have tried a number of dishes here and liked most of them. The \\"sliders\\", which is actually a sandwich on crunchy french bread cut into thirds are very good. I have tried the duck before, and had the chicken this time, and both were yummy, with a nice slightly spicy sauce, a tangy mayo and pickled veggies. I had the five spice pork \\"choppets\\" as well and they were also tasty with a tiny bit of spicy relish on top, it really needed more of the relish. Previously I have tried their pad thai noodles, mei fun noodles, the cod fish, and several other dishes, and all were good to excellent. Their beer selection is also outstanding, although the young lady at the bar yesterday said they were getting ready to redo their selection. I suspect it will still be awesome, just different.\\n\\nI have just a few nits to pick with this place. For one thing their menu is geared entirely toward you having a party of at least three people. It is very difficult to get a variety of dishes for even two people, much less one, without spending more than you should have to. At the least they should throw a couple of combo plates, or create your own combos on the menu. This makes it hard to consider for a lone diner.\\n\\nAnother thing, the descriptions of their menu items, to me at least, are misleading. For example, a sandwich, even cut into thirds, is still a sandwich, not \\"sliders\\". Another example, \\"five spice pork choppets\\": anyone familiar with Asian cuisine has likely been exposed to five spice powder, a common ingredient in Asian dishes, Wikipedia defines this (typically) as (star anise), cloves, cinnamon, huajiao (Sichuan pepper) and ground fennel seeds, it has a distinctive flavor profile. The \\"five spice pork choppets\\" may have five spices but nothing similar to the five spice seasoning I am familiar with. Not that the sweet, salt and cinnamon flavor is bad, it's just not what I think of when I see the term \\"five spice\\". Not to mention the term \\"pork choppet\\", which would lead me to believe some kind of a small pork chop, perhaps even with a bone attached. The pieces of pork are nothing like this, they are just small slices of pork, tender, but not a \\"choppet\\" by any stretch. There are other menu items that either don't list all the key elements of the dish or are also misleading. All I am saying is that roughly 50% of most subjective experiences is relative to our expectations. So it would behoove them to take a bit more care in the descriptions of their food.\\n\\nLastly, most of the food here, as yummy as it is, does not travel well. We have had take out from here twice and it definitely lost something in translation. I don't see their menu readily available on line either, but that is probably just as well. Plus, you would miss the cool atmosphere and great beer selection . Oh, and if you have a fat rear end like me, some of the high top seats can be pretty painful. Finally, why does everyplace have to have TVs all over the place?\\n\\nAnyway, the great food and service makes up for the few minor shortcomings. So, grab a few of your skinny-ass friends, go when it is not too busy (it gets slammed on Friday and Saturday nights) and get some tasty Asian street fare."},{"name":"Habanero Mexican Grill","address":"166 Brighton Ave","city":"Allston","stars":"4","text":"Could be one of my favorite Mexican meals!

Soon after entering, we realized our party of 3 was too large for the 2-seater table available, and the host assured us it would be just a few minutes before a booth was free and cleaned for us to use.\\n\\nCue about 15 minutes later, tummies rumbling, when my friends and I realized the host and the 3 or so waitresses ALL forgot about us. The real kicker is, they literally made eye contact with me several times when I'd look over and give them the \\"where the fuck is my table my stomach is eating itself\\" eye. FINALLY the host came over and said \\"yep, we forgot about you, sorry!\\" and let us pick one of the now 2 or 3 empty booths to sit at.\\n\\nAs far as food was concerned, I ordered the biscuits and gravy and let me tell you it was absolutely fucking disgusting. Biscuits were most certainly made from a can (pillsbury maybe? I've had them before and they're as far from homemade as one can get), gravy was most likely made from a powdered mix (and lord knows whether the \\"sausage\\" in it was real..), and best of all, my scrambled eggs appeared to have come from some fairytale land where real eggs do not exist. I can't even begin to surmise what their chemical makeup was, but I can tell you one thing: it never had anything to do with a chicken. This is a bit of a moot point, but I really wish I'd taken a picture of the plate. It was the WEIRDEST arrangement of food (like, pile of biscuits smothered in gravy on one side, super odd open spaces, and a blog of fake eggs all by their lonesome with lots more random negative space. just bizarre.)\\n\\nAnyway.. all that to say.. I will not be returning here. The milkshakes were decent, but by no means have they convinced me. I still, several months later, can't believe I actually ate (some of) and paid for that pile of shit. \\n\\nLive and learn."},{"name":"Sal's Ristorante & Pizzeria","address":"205 L St","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"Was bored one night and wanted to try something new so I ordered delivery from Sals, so this review is for that only.

I had never been here before and when we arrived on a Saturday, much to my surprise we found a spot right around the corner- a rarity in the Pearl. When we came in, the front entryway was pretty packed, along with the bar, which I was expecting. The hostess told us about a 30-45 minute wait, which ended up at about 25 minutes I believe, pretty good for a restaurant that busy! \\n\\nWe ended up getting seated at a higher table which was fun. The place is huge and has a super homey, pub feel to it, which I am all about. Wide variety on the menu, and if you are a beer fan, this place is the place to be! Lots of beer and wine to choose from. Not too many liquor drinks. The food has some vegan and vegetarian as well as gluten free options for those with food allergies or sensitivities, which I always think is very kind and awesome. \\n\\nThe waitress we had, Kimberly I think her name was, was super kind and helpful, and had an energetic and happy attitude the entire time she served us. We ordered the pretzel as an appetizer per her recommendation, which was wonderful. That cheese dip is amazing! \\n\\nI ordered a burger with truffle fries, and let me tell you, that was the best burger I have had in quite some time. It was phenomenal. Not one mistake on our order, and when we finished we got the chocolate chip cookie with vanilla ice cream. Delicious end to a wonderful meal. Service was timely and ideal.

Overall, the food was better than most, but the prices and service was quite disappointing.  Although the selection was minimal, it was unique and therefore peaked our interest. The server was rarely to be found, and given the size of the restaurant, I wasn't so sure why.  There were three (3) separate occasions where we had to remind the waiter about our order (appetizer or wine) and his response was \\"I thought you'd want that to come out with the entree, but if you want it beforehand, I will put in the order.\\"  Frustrating after the first time; inexcusable after the third time.\\n\\nThe cheese plate was absolutely ridiculous--two small slices of bread to accompany the grapes and two pieces of cheese.  The Arancini was VERY good as was the fried okra and farro.  It took the waiter so long to get back to us, that every chance we got, we ordered another appetizer.  Our reservation was for 8:30 p.m. and we were finally ordering our food at 10:00.\\n\\nThe wine selection was pretty good, but they didn't have the ingredients to make a martini and did not carry Crown Rum when a fellow dinner guest sought a Crown and Diet.  They had a short list of cocktails that were interesting.  I had the Colonel Mustard which was heavily soda water.  I sent it back.  I also ordered a bottle of wine for dinner, and received a carafe.  I asked for another carafe, that I received about 30 minutes after my request.\\n\\nThe decor was excellent, a bit small, but quaint and suitable for the atmosphere.

It's right by the bookstore and the outside of the pub is beautifully decorated and clean. The decor is woodsy and cool, and you can see all the awards they have won for their brews. The restaurant area is spacious and plenty of seating is available for hundreds of patrons. They also offer souvenir shirts, growlers, and drink wear for beer enthusiasts. The service is really great and I have no complaints about the service nor the cleanliness of the pub/restaurant area. \\n\\nWe tried their River Ale and it was 5/5, one of the best beers I've ever had in my life. I also tried their in-house root beer and it was absolutely delicious. Their appetizer garlic rosemary fries were so sinfully good, with a generous amount of cheese and oils drizzled on top. What started to go wrong was when we ordered the Brewery Burger. I love burgers and I'm a major meat eater, but I literally felt like I was eating a dirty tortured cow when I was eating my burger. It was the worst patty I have ever eaten in my life and I was getting a major gag reflex. My burger was ordered medium well, but my bottom bun was SOAKED in bright red blood.

Our server looked at him like a sad and confused puppy and wanted to know if we wanted to see the manager.

I was expecting to see the famous Singapore chicken rice and other goodies that are very common place. They do have the Singapore Chili crab which is pretty awesome to see. Another thing that did surprise me is the very small number of gluten-free items available on the menu. Usually Asian food, other than Japanese food, is very easy to prepare gluten-free. There are no noodle dishes that are listed as gluten free. There are a large number of different Asian beers available from Japan, Thailand, China and Singapore. There are also a very large number of craft brews available for those that want to sample domestic craft beers. I ordered the Tom Yum soup and it was medium hot with just enough of all of the ingredients included. I am not an expert on this particular dish but I certainly did enjoy it. For dessert I ordered the sticky rice with mango. My server highly recommended it. The presentation is beautiful and the dessert is over the top delicious.

When we walked in the atmosphere was absolutely perfection with the most amazing smell I have ever smelled in a restaurant ever in my life. Even the bathroom smelled nice. I will also say that the Sweet Potato Hash was absolutely delicious and I might come back solely for this food item. \\n\\nHowever, the appetizer (Avocado & charred Serrano Hummus) did not live up to my expectations. This hummus wasn't actually \\"bad\\", but I really wanted it to be so much better. To me, it tasted like hummus, regular, plain old hummus, which I'm a fan of. However, because it said Serrano, I was preparing myself for something with a little bit of heat. This may be able to fly in New England or the Midwest, but down here in Texas if you mention grilled peppers, you better be able to at least taste the kick. Had the menu just said hummus and pita, it would have probably gotten a better rating. The expectation/promise of this dish just did not deliver. Also, the Rocky Road Mousse Brownie was dry and disappointing. I was even underwhelmed with the wine. Now, I understand that this was the cheapest non-dessert wine on their menu, so you get what you pay for I guess. I liked it at first, but as the dinner progressed, I was a bit underwhelmed. It felt a little annoying after a while, if that makes sense (as if wine can taste annoying), Not bad enough to be bad, but not good enough to leave a good (or even neutral) impression. \\n\\nIt was also very expensive and besides the atmosphere and the sweet potato hash, I really didn't feel like it was worth the amount of money we spent. Also, if the extra crostini is going to cost me additionally, do not ask me if I want more with no prompting from me. It's one thing if I specifically ask for extra bread and then they charge me, but for them to offer me more bread (as if it's just an extra to the meal) and then charge me is really annoying.

Let me preface this by saying I am not a fan of American fare. If it's something that I could make the staple of the dish and you only added some small extra I am not going to be impressed. It was hard for me to find something on the menu that I wanted, as most of the things did not interest me or just seemed like things I have had other places. \\n\\nI had beef tacos and they were solid, but nothing I couldn't get somewhere else. As a section eater, I was a bit annoyed that the sides came layered on top of each other. Black beans sitting on top of rice. \\n\\nI watched some reality show where contestants had to open a restaurant.When the chef was making the menu, the owners advised you can't have just ordinary food, but you can have ordinary food with a little something extra and then charge more.

However, it seems they have been on a steady decline lately. The last time I was in they burnt my burger, which was ordered medium. It was so dry I had to wash each bite down with water. Unfortunately, it took so long to get our food in the first place that by the time it arrived, we had no more time to wait another 30 minutes for a new burger. I mentioned it to the owner, who apologized, but clearly could care less because she didn't offer to remove the burger from our check. Whatever, not a big deal because I  would've refused a free meal anyways. I know stuff happens, so I ate the burger, paid and left. At that point, I was still more than willing to eat there again for future meals, but that changed as of his morning...\\n\\nMy wife and I walked in for breakfast and the restaurant was about 75% full. There was several 4 top tables open and one two person table, which is crammed between the front door, which constantly swings open/closed and a 4 top table. The owner tried to seat us at the tiny, squished 2 top, so I asked her if it would be possible to sit in one of the other 4 open tables, as I'm 6'3, 230 and just had knee surgery. She looked up at me and said no, we can't sit at any other table. I patiently told her I'm clearly not a tiny man and I've got to keep my leg straight, so can we please have one of the other 4 open tables. Again, she refused, stating \\"we try to keep all of those other tables open for parties of 3 or 4\\". I told her that's fine, I guess we will eat somewhere else and she responded that she doesn't want us to leave and she's fine with us sitting at the squished two top. I told her no problem, my wife and I will leave and we won't come back, alone or with our family of 5 that usually eats there. \\n\\nIt's true what they say - you can't fix stupid.

It's just what you want your neighborhood bar to be -- relaxed, fun, with good food and great beer.  The place makes it easy to relax, with a good-sized bar, lots of big tables, booths, long outdoor tables, and squashy couches and eclectic coffee tables in the back.  While it's clear the waitstaff are hired for their looks (and their ability to pull off the teeny schoolgirl kilt look), they are also about the best waitresses I've ever had.  They are courteous, helpful, friendly, but also professional in the way good high-end restaurant staff are.  And they know their beers.  You can ask about any beer on the very extensive menu and they know just what it tastes like, what the style is, where it comes from -- anything you want to know.  And these ladies (and they all are, I think, ladies -- I haven't seen any male waitstaff there) are cool under pressure.  Even when the place is packed, they get every order right and keep tabs on who needs a refill or who's been waiting for their food.  One night when the place was clearly crazy and the entire staff was killing themselves, it took awhile for my meal to come out.  Our waitress must have come over five times to apologize.  Eventually the manager came over, explained they were slammed but said that was no excuse for not taking care of us and then said the meal was on the house.  100 points for that one.  Perfectly handled.  And food, while not fantastic, is very good for a place that's mostly about beer drinking.  As for the beer, if you like beer, this is the place.  Huge selection.

It took 20 minutes to get a few slices of lemon. I asked for an estimate on how much longer it would take for food to come out (after about 45 min of waiting) and the response I received was \\"I don't know, it's a large party so it takes more time.\\" Once the food started coming out, someone asked for butter twice before they received it. Food orders were mixed up. Apparently the kitchen thought 4 people from the same party couldn't possibly order the same meal, so they gave two of the orders to another table. They did fix that last bit but it took an additional 20 min for those two people to get their food. At one point someone in our party apologized for all the hassle with the big order because it seemed like our waitress was getting irritated, and the waitress responded with \\"it's ok.

Eye contact was made, but neither server acknowledged us. There was no \\"Hi guys!\\" or \\"Please seat yourselves.\\". Just a total disregard. After 5 minutes, while the elder server was scurrying away from a table, I quipped up and asked if we should seat ourselves.

I went for brunch on Sunday AM and was delighted at the Benedict Saba, one of the lighter choices:  two poached eggs served on top of pancetta, arugula & cibatta bread with salsa rojos.  The pancetta was a bit salty in this quantity, so I might opt for prosciutto for the same effect, but otherwise it was incredibly tasty and a pleasant surprise.  There was no wait either on a Sunday AM--a huge plus in the brunch market.  I only wish I'd had the $4 Bloody Mary too.\\n\\nYesterday I was there and had the B.A. salad, which I've now decided means \\"bad ass\\" salad!  (Mixed field greens, Roma tomatoes, grilled red peppers, grilled red onion,  black beans, roasted rice, feta cheese & \\norange/balsamic vinaigrette.) The roasted veggies were amazing and the dressing had a hint of pesto flavor with the orange.  Best of all I added the shrimp to it and it was truly divine.  I will DEFINITELY order this again.  Best salad I've had in a long time.\\n\\nAnd while I'm here I'll mention my other favorite, the Zuppa di pesce (salmon, shrimp, scallops & calamari in a spicy tomato broth).

Wuburger capitalizes on the wildly popular burger scene successfully.  I feel like it's a homegrown place where the owner said I can make a burger as good as any of these chains popping up everywhere.  They were right.  They nail the food.  The burgers are 'smashed' flatted on the grill so you get a really nice grill/burn on the top of the patty which only adds to the flavor.  Burgers are cooked well done because they are so thin but remain juicy and tasty.  The flavor is there, better than the 5 guys patty.  The secret sauce is also very very good, almost addictive.  I wanted another burger as soon as I was done. I would probably go for the double (7$), because it's really too good for just a single (5$).  The waffle fries ($3) are also good, while not the best fry texture (5 guys preferred there), they have indulgent toppings that make the fat kid in me sing.  We went with chili (1$) and cheddar cheese sauce (another 1$). They have a large ice cream/drink/shake menu which we didn't get to try but plan to in the future.

My wife have been to this restaurant three times. First when we first got to Orlando to look for a venue to get married. I had the chicken carbonara and it changed my entire life at the time. I normally get similar things going out to Italian places because I'm not too familiar with all Italian food choices even though i love it to death. It was by far the best food ive had at an italian place. No questions. I craved that meal allll the time since we left and we ended up coming back again to do some food tasting for our wedding and you bet your hind parts i ate that same thing again! It was just as good as the last time! They also had some cheese bread that's incredible. My chicken carbonara was so tasty. Everything they used was fresh, you could taste it. For my rehearsal dinner there was a more selected meal choice but again it was awesome. There were twenty people there and we had the choice between shrimp scampi, chicken Parmesan, and a few other things. I had the scampi, it wasn't the best but it was damn good considering the fact the chefs had to cook for twenty plus whatever was ordered. The wait staff we had was incredible. There were plenty of people who were late and they took care of them as if they'd been there the whole time and they were always smiling. The tip was included in the original price but we gave them more after for being so awesome! I couldn't be more pleased with the food and service we received from this place.

Ex.  I recently got a roasted veggie roll-up.  It was a disgusting, gloppy, soggy mess.  I was unable to identify a single vegetable because it was all one overcooked sort of green, sort of brown, and sort of red blob.  This sandwich is as simple as they get.  No idea how you guys can't make it.  And it was close to 10 bucks.  And rethink your prices while you are at it.  Perhaps, these prices would almost be acceptable if the food was GREAT.  But, I am thinking even with a vast improvement in the quality, prices would still be out of sync. \\n\\nAlso staff needs serious training on timing, customer service, and professionalism.  Took me 20+ minutes to get my bill.

I've had the chance to try several of their signature cocktails, including Printer's Punch (of course there's a yummy Bourbon drink offering in a Southern-themed restaurant!), The Ink Drop (the Triple Eight Blueberry is mesmerizing... truly like an ink drop splattering onto a fresh sheet of paper... oh, and it's a great vodka drink, too!), The Vault (you had me at gin... and St. Germain), and The Cambridge Kiss (fruity, bubbly, gorgeous goodness). All of them are delicious, and pack quite a punch. Like the bar itself, the drinks are big, beautiful, and bold.\\n\\nI've also had the chance to try The Swamp Bowl (sans crawdads, per our request) while at the bar, and the gator balls and fried frog legs were gooOOoood. Mmm. My first time eating gator meat... not bad. Not bad at all. \\n\\nThey've got these gorgeous dark wooden booths (same material as the bar) that look inviting, and they've always got fresh flowers on the tables. Charming. And make sure you check out their vault area, where they've managed to squeeze in a LOT more seating than I thought would be possible in such a small, short space. I think I'd feel a little claustrophobic if I had to spend an entire meal inside, but it's a really cool additon to (and use of) the restaurant space.\\n\\nLike I said, I'd love to try this place out for an actual meal sometime, but that bar of theirs keeps callin' my name... and I can't help but answer!

It's close, convenient, and located near the Harvard T stop. So, points for great location. \\n\\nI've been here for the lunch special, which is a good deal. $10 and below will leave you out the door full and satisfied... with MSG. (Hey, it's Chinese food.. what do you expect?) However, I don't think the lunch special portions are super big like Yelpers and FourSquarers claim. I think it's decently portioned.. unless, my stomach has stretched and I can take in more food than others. \\n\\nI've also been here for take-out. I usually just order and wait. The owner, Peter, is really friendly and knows how to treat his customers. Whenever I'm waiting for my to-go order, he gives me a cup of hot tea. Kudos for customer service. Also, he gives me complimentary house soup with my order of house special chow mein (this is probably the only dish that I order consistently and would recommend). They have other types of chow mien (ie. beef chow mien, chicken chow mien, shrimp chow mien, etc...), but I think for another $2, I'd get the house special chow mien, b/c it includes all those proteins: pork, chicken, beef, and shrimp. YUM.\\n\\nTIP: If you plan to do take-out, call in your order and then pick it up... b/c you might have to wait for a bit sometimes. Also, no delivery. :(\\n\\nMy only concern with this place is that it's not that cheap (except the lunch specials), so be prepared to spend at least $10 or more. (Yes, $10 or more for Chinese food is expensive for my standards... probably b/c I can get much cheaper and more authentic Chinese food in Southern CA).\\n\\nAnyway, I'd definitely recommend this place if you are in Harvard Square and craving for Chinese food.

Most hibachi dinners include miso or onion soup, Osaka's does not. The salad was nothing but iceberg lettuce drowned in ginger dressing. There was no shrimp appetizer included, which is standard at every other Hibachi joint I've ever been to.

No real show to speak of. He threw everything on the grill at the same time, and served it as it was done. Despite getting my steak ten minutes before anything else arrived on my plate, everything was well cooked, but a bit under seasoned. Osaka's Cardinal sin in my opinion is something they call \\"yum yum sauce\\". Instead of the hot mustard sauce I've enjoyed at Hibachi joints in the past, they serve this disgusting runny mayonnaise instead. \\n\\nSo to summarize, Good service, decent sushi, bland hibachi, less for your money than other restaurants of their type, and runny mayo instead of hot mustard. \\n\\nHaving tried only one roll its hard to say come for the sushi, but I definitely can't recommend the hibachi."},{"name":"Jack Allen's Kitchen Oak Hill","address":"7720 Hwy 71 W","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"The atmosphere is nice but the food definitely has a modern flair.

However, the service is superb.  We arrived early (around 6pm or so) on a Thursday night and everyone there was Japanese.  That's a great sign.  Japanese families come and gather around for dinner.  \\n\\nThe menu is extensive and offers items rarely find at often Chinese operated Japanese restaurants.  The drink menu lists a wide selection of sakes.  No fun drinks like lychee martini, unfortunately.  Instead of the customary sushi rolls, we ordered grilled squid, agedashi tofu, sashimi, squid balls, dobinmushi (Japanese soup served in a pot and sipped in a tiny teacup) and chicken karaage.  \\n\\nSashimi was the first dish to arrive and we thought the portion was quite small, compared to other places.  However, the slivers of fish were so tasty and satisfying, they really beat huge chunks of bad tasting fish.  The grilled squid, yaki ika, was so tender and the taste quite sublime with grated ginger, even my fussy-I-don't-eat-exotic-seafood husband liked it.  Squid balls were good, but a bit heavily sauced for my liking.  The chicken karaage was generously portioned.  Dobinmushi with a bit of lime was perfect to cap an evening's meal.  They served tea automatically after the meal was over.  The check came with 2 pieces of mint dove chocolate.  It's a nice gesture, but somehow ruins the great flavor of the food we just had.\\n\\nIt may be expensive, if one were looking for simple ramen and some rice dish.  However, for an exquisitely prepared authentic Japanese meal.  It's a great deal."},{"name":"Cafe Java- Austin","address":"11900 Metric Blvd, Ste K","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"I rarely write five-star reviews, but I was so enamored by this place, I just had to run to Yelp and tell you all about it. That's right, you.\\n\\nAs late risers, my boyfriend and I are always on the hunt for good brunch. We rushed into Cafe Java on a Sunday, around 2:30, in an effort to catch breakfast before close at 3:00. I was stunned at the sheer number of people crammed inside this place. Despite that fact, we were seated almost immediately, and the crowd though large, was well-arranged. I didn't feel like I had to introduce myself to the next table over, preparing to become intimately acquainted with the smell of their breath and their conversation. I'm not a people-person, obviously. That being said, this place is not for everyone. You still have to be okay with close-quarters dining.\\n\\nWhere we were seated, I had a great view of the place, and immediately noticed the waitstaff huffing their way around the restaurant quickly and efficiently. Every person in a Cafe Java t-shirt looked like they had clear marching orders, executed their duties well, and had a good time doing it. The service was quick, attentive, and personal while not overbearing. I heard several waitresses calling customers by name and chatting pleasantly. \\n\\nI ordered the migas. This is always a good quick test of what I call eggs-manship and general breakfast handling. When my food arrived, it was fresh and hot, and the portion was generous. One of the things that I always notice is the way the tortillas are cooked into the egg with a migas dish. There should be just a slight bit of crunch in the tortilla - and there WAS! This is very rare to find, as a lot of establishments cook the tortilla and egg together at the same time, causing your crunchy tortilla to turn into a sad floppy mess on your plate. The ranchero sauce was just to my liking - tomato based with fresh veggies inside, and not too much spice. I can't stand it when I can't taste my food because my mouth is on fire. The bacon was just right - not too crunchy, not too soft. I was Goldilocks at last!\\n\\nMy only gripe was a dirty kitchen. I could see into it quite well and while not unsanitary or unsafe, it was a little bit of a turn off. Of course, it could have been the fact that we came at the end of the day - these places have to go through rigorous inspection, so I'm not too worried about it. \\n\\nAs a long time Austinite, my boyfriend mentioned that Cafe Java felt like what Kirby Lane used to be years and years ago - a small local place, with good food, good service, good atmosphere, and real ingredients.

Wood oven pizza was delish, escarole caesar salad was creative and came with fresh anchovies. The lamb skewers were small but tasty served with roasted peppers. \\nWe all ordered off the fresh pasta menu and most dishes did not disappoint. Spring pea ravioli was excellent, light and fresh. The porcini manicotti were also spot on served in a light cream sauce. Only flaw - crab bucatini was ridiculously spicy. I like spice but the calabria peppers were too much!  Our server was quick to fix. He brought a complimentary serving of meatballs that were perfect.  No charge for the spicy crab.

A week ago, I made a reservation for 12 at 7p with the manager.  We arrived at 645p and asked for our reservation and they had written down a party of 6 at 6p.  Annoying, but I guess that we had to make it work.  It ended up that we had 13 people and we squeezed around a table for 6.  They had the garage doors open, but we were right by the front door, so it was HOT.  After 20 minutes of sitting, no one had been by to help us. . . . we tried several times to flag down servers and we were ignored.  I went up to the hostess stand and she said she'd help me find someone, but then ignored me, so I found a waitress that eventually served us.  It took 15 minutes for half of the table to get water, another 20 minutes for the other side of the table to get water and we had to ask repeatedly for refills.  No lie, it took one hour and 20 minutes for us all to get our first round of drinks.  One woman ordered a glass of wine from the menu and after 30 minutes, the waitress came back and said that they didn't have that wine.  We had drinks spilled on us and our table was never cleared.  Some came planning on eating, but didn't order because they didn't know when they might get their food.  \\n\\nI realize that they've only been open for a few weeks, but if you can't get drinks to a table, water or other, then this place won't be open for long.

I was meeting a group of friends (around 8 people) there on a Friday evening. Since Banger's is a beer garden we didn't think we'd need reservations. The place was packed, which is expected on a Friday evening. However, the hostess said it would be about 30-40 min wait & we didn't get seated until over an hour after we arrived.\\n\\nBefore I move onto what happened once we were seated outside, I have to comment on the atmosphere inside the restaurant. Although the building looks lovely, the noise level inside the restaurant is unbearable. The acoustics are so horrible that you could barely hear the person sitting next to you. If you can believe it, the noise was from all the other patrons talking & laughing. It echos so loudly inside that it hurts. Obviously, we chose to sit outside.\\n\\nFinally, our waitress takes us to our seats outside. We arrive at a group of three six-top picnic tables that were all pushed together. There were two people sitting at the table on the end & two people sitting at the table in the middle. We start sitting down at the table on the other end. Since there were 8 of us, it became obvious that we were going to spill over into the next table. The two middle-aged men at the middle table were sitting very close to the end of their table where it met with ours. The waitress kindly asked them to move over a bit & they ignored her. It became obviously that a few of us didn't have room to sit down & the waitress just kind of stood there like a deer in the headlights. Maybe she expected us to sit on these men's laps?\\n\\nWhat happened next was completely appalling. The waitress asks us if we're going to sit down, even though it's obvious there is no more room & the men at the next table are refusing to move down even though there is plenty of room at their table. The few of us who are still standing explain what should be visually obvious, that there is no where left to sit at our table. The waitress then wimpily asks the men to move down again. The men reply, \\"well what if we have friends that are showing up later?\\" \\n\\nThose of us still standing were starving from waiting so long just to get seated & now we were having to negotiate our own seating arrangement that the restaurant supposedly said was ready for us. At that point, we kindly told the waitress we were going to leave. Instead of being firm with the men at the next table & telling them to move, getting the manager, or finding our group other seating, the waitress let us leave & didn't apologize or anything! \\n\\nIn my opinion, if your restaurant wants to have a European, beer garden atmosphere where strangers sit next to eachother, then your staff better know how to handle situations like this. Or better yet, maybe don't sit strangers together if your staff can't handle rude customers. In this case, you just lost the business of polite customers.\\n\\nOn a side note, what in the hell has happened to my Austin? I've lived here since 1985 & I'm not usually someone who complains about growth, but it's situations like these that make me sad for what Austin used to stand for. Austin used to be a place where strangers were just friends you hadn't met yet. I was totally shocked by the rudeness of the other customers at Banger's that night. If that's the kind of clientele their establishment welcomes & caters too, then I'm proud to say it's not the place for me."},{"name":"IHOP","address":"2741 Clairmont Rd NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"2.5","text":"I've lived 1 mile away from this place for 8 years, and this is only the 2nd time I've ever been there.

I think Hawkers has a more cohesive approach though, for one, with their emphasis on most dishes coming out of a true Asian street food tradition. Thus, while Bento starts in Japanese traditions and branches out from there, Hawkers starts in the Viet and Singaporean street food culture and branches forth. Some dishes expectedly are better than others and some are pretty typical--banal, even--whereas others are truly exotic and unlikely to be found elsewhere. Perhaps the best thing about Hawkers overall is that it brings a lot of different styles of Asian cooking under one roof in small plates and allows you to try a diversity you'd not encounter in the same place otherwise. \\n\\nMy friend Daniel and I ordered the following: a fried tofu dish, edamame, stir-fried udon with chicken, fried shrimp with curry sauce, Asian green beans, and a tofu curry. The edamame was fine, but like you'd get anywhere, really; the green beans were quite good and the udon was superb. The fried shrimp I did not find very impressive, however and I'm not much a fan of tofu anyways, so little to say about those dishes. Our desserts--mango sticky rice and a dessert roti with cream cheese filling and cinnamon--were both pretty good. The waiter was attentive despite us being out on the patio and his seemingly having a lot of tables to worry over and he was also eager to answer any questions regarding the menu if needed. They have beer and wine, but I don't believe a full bar, but no matter: they seem to have a robust enough assortment of drinks, including our mimosas, to keep people happy. The inside dining room is pretty crowded but no worse than many other restaurants: the complaints I've read here about it being hard to even move or having people relentlessly bump into your chair surprise me and make me wonder if people who wrote these things ever have been in a crowded bar or restaurant before. Overall, it's a very nice space and a very well-run restaurant. Is it authentic? Some dishes probably more than others, but it's fun and overall pretty tasty.

Based on other reviews, Bouchee sounded interesting but not too experimental. Perfect way to take advantage of Restaurant Week.\\n\\nIt's a nice location and adequately recreates the European cafe lunch experience. We sat outside, at the only table without an umbrella, but I don't hold that against them since we volunteered to sit there. The wait staff was very attentive. We never had to ask them to refill our water and the check came right on time.\\n\\nThe Restaurant Week menu offered a good selection and the concept for each dish struck a good balance between being familiar and being unique. The presentation for each dish was well-thought out. I thought the way each dish was plated helped elevate the concepts behind the dishes. The poached pair casserole (see below) was served in a small mini-skillet and the steak flatbread was served on nice oval plate. \\n\\nThe concept behind the dishes and the restaurant itself was so great that I was a little disappointed by the execution, though I am not sure how much of that has to do with personal tastes. I was surprised that the poached pair was served with a thick layer of cheese on top. The steak had far more bread and bleu cheese dressing than meat, which was okay but the cheese dominated the dish. The steak, salad, and flatbread would've worked better if there was something sweet like dried cranberries to round out the flavors. The strawberry rhubarb cobbler dessert tasted great, but the cobbler was too heavy. It should've been a refreshing way to end the meal, but instead it felt heavy.\\n\\nI would give Bouchee another shot if the opportunity presents itself.

Beautifully landscaped property next to the river (but geese poop is everywhere so watch out!)\\n\\nThe hostess and our server, pretty much killed our experience. \\n\\nAs we were celebrating a special occasion, our party of 4 requested a table by the window, a \\"good\\" table, when we made the reservation over a month ago.

Although the restaurant was literally empty when we arrived, we were told they could not accommodate the table we requested.

One table of 4 was being used by a party of 2, and the other table of 4 sat empty the entire time we ate. \\n\\nAlthough the location of the table was annoying, we weren't going to let something silly like that ruin our evening. Instead our server, Jess. N. did that for us. She was rude and had a terrible attitude from the very start. When I asked if they had Coke Zero, for example, her response was \\"well our sodas come in bottles so you don't get free refills.\\" Although she was very knowledgeable about the questions I had regarding the menu, she was clearly frustrated that I was even asking them. I realize this makes me sound overly sensitive, but I'm telling you, her negativity, eye-rolls, and strategically loud well-timed exhales made it awkward for all of us throughout the entire meal.

I had never heard of it before last night as I rarely venture into the Rainey St. district. I felt pleased that Bangers seemed to me like a cross between Ginger Man (my favorite place) and Easy Tiger, which I also like. I really liked the theme they have going there. It seemed like a blast from the past; the type of beer garden you would see in an old German movie or something like that. \\n\\nThe beer selection is pretty amazing, although they were out of 2 different beers I wanted to try (Austin Beerworks Flying Headbutt and Real Ale Full Mood Pale Rye Ale).\\n\\nThe food selection is also very broad; sausages ranging from andouille to bratwurst to chorizo, and they also have a few meatless options. The apps and sides all sounded good too. I had the currywurst plate that had a sliced sausage, french fries and curry ketchup. Curry ketchup is phenomenal and I wished there was more of it. I believe they forgot my garlic aoili, but overall the dish was very delicious and satisfying. One other thing: too many fries and not enough sausage. I guess that's to be expected tho.\\n\\nThe thing that really bothered me about this place is the way we were seated. I was in a party of 3 and they sat us inside at the end of one of the ridiculously long tables they have, which of course is fine.  But not even 3 minutes later they proceeded to sit a group of about 12 loud, obnoxious drunk people next to us. This forced us to scoot uncomfortably to the end, rub elbows with the large drunk man next to me and strain to hear the conversation my friends and I were having. I guess that's the price you pay for being new and popular, but some people like to have their personal space, even when they are out in public. Maybe going at an off-peak time (not Friday night) would alleviate being too crowded in seating.\\n\\nOverall, I really did like Bangers and I would love to go back again to check out the outside seating area... it looked very nice out there. However, to be honest I will probably be sticking with Ginger Man for the most part for my beer selection needs, just because it's not as crowded and I like that."},{"name":"Carrabba's Italian Grill","address":"8460 Lyra Dr","city":"Columbus","stars":"3.5","text":"What Italian restaurant doesn't have Penne or Rigatoni noodles?

Sadly, the Colorado place did broasted wings, and I don't think we're going to easily find broasted chicken here, at least not from my preliminary web searches. (If anyone knows a place, let me know!) But in any case, we really enjoyed the wings and the ribs here and will be back.\\n\\nWe split a half order of the baby back ribs with the sweet BBQ sauce. Our server warned us that the ribs \\"had a little kick\\" because of the spices dry rubbed onto the ribs themselves--and we told her that was just fine! The ribs were great: falling off the bone, lots of sauce, and the spiciness level was just right. They come with sides of coleslaw (meh), garlic toast (meh), and french fries (decent but your average fries, honestly). But we weren't there for the sides. We were there for meat on sticks. And these ribs delivered.\\n\\nWe had started off with a half order of fried pickles; the half order doesn't appear on the menu, but when our server noted that I asked my husband \\"will you eat any fried pickles if I get some?\\" she did say, \\"You can actually get a half order.\\" It was the perfect size, to be honest. Maybe about 10-12 fried pickles came in the half order and they were hot just out of the fryer, nicely breaded, and with a good cup of ranch dressing on the side to dip them in. Definitely if you like fried pickles, try these guys. They were great.\\n\\nThe wings were pretty good as well--it seems the sauce you choose really makes all the difference. When you get an order of 10 wings, you can split it up into two sauces, so 5 wings in one sauce, 5 in another. This allowed us to get two orders of 10 wings with 4 different sauces total, so we could try a good variety of sauces. Here's what we tried:\\n\\nMedium BBQ: Great. Not too spicy, in fact. Nice and thick and stayed on the wings well.\\n\\nParmesan Garlic: Ehhh, just okay. Really it only tasted like wings basted in butter. No real parmesan or garlic flavor. I'd skip this one to be honest.\\n\\nGator's Own Scooter: This was really good. It tasted to me like a traditional hot wing sauce mixed with sweet Thai chili--it was a little like buffalo wing flavor but with a sweetness to it. I'd definitely get this again.\\n\\nTraditional: Tastes like your average Frank's Red Hot sauce but cut with a lot of butter. Probably wouldn't get again.\\n\\nWe got our wings buffalo style. You can get three different styles, including grilled and breaded, and you can get all flats or all drumsticks for a dollar more. Sauce is extra on the side, as is celery, but I never use either and so I felt better about not throwing them away/asking them to not have to bring them out.\\n\\nOur server brought by a dessert menu for us to look at even though we were stuffed. There were a few good looking options on there, including a salted caramel cake and a peanut butter chocolate pie. Maybe next time when we don't stuff ourselves with a variety of meats.\\n\\nThey advertise an all-you-can eat wing special on Mondays, which looked like a good option (around $12). The interior was bright and spacious. Lots of TVs, several arcade games you could play. Lots of families around us with kids, so definitely not a seedy sports bar.\\n\\nOh, and they have one of the more interesting flavors for wings that I've seen: Peanut butter and jelly! The server said it's the Thai chili sauce mixed with peanut butter, or something like it. I tried a sample and it was not bad--sweet, and there were chunks of peanut in it. I'd try a few wings in this sauce sometime and see if they were good.\\n\\nVery tasty--we'll be back for sure!"},{"name":"Trifecta Annex","address":"126 SW 2nd Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Tried a slice of pepperoni pizza here.

But this place changed that. \\n\\nFirst, it's all you can eat...we're done here. That's all you need to know. Good day. \\n\\nJokes. \\n\\nBut yes, it is AYCE, which is a plus if you have a tapeworm living inside of you like me. No seriously, I never went to these places thinking I wouldn't get full like you would say at Nori Nori (don't know where that is, YOU BETTER FIND OUT QUICK LIKE TODAY!) or AYCE KBBQ joints. What makes this place I think standout from other places is the variety of items you can order whether it be different types of meats or an assortment of veggies to add to your broth or hot food items to go with your broth. See the photo of the menu I posted...yes, it's sideways. \\n\\nLike many sushi joints, there is a piece of paper with all the food items available, you simply mark which items you want and how many, then wait. Boom. Done. There are two types of broth from what I recall. Nutrition (plain?) and spicy. \\n\\nNOTE - the food quality is average. Yes, average. You can kinda get that sense from the pictures. Do not expect your pork buns to be filled completely with goodness. Don't expect the red bean buns to be White Windmill quality. The pancakes aren't going to be fresh out of the kitchen and soft. It's an AYCE joint that serves mass quantities of food at a relatively cheap price. You get what you pay for. If you are just craving soup on a cold day...or if you just crave soup for whatever reason, then I think this is a good place to checkout. You'll be surprised how full you can get from this place! The key is...keep eating until regret and shame start to sink in. \\n\\nBeen here twice and both times the service was good. No issues for me. Drinks were refilled. They would make sure the broth levels were on point. Yes, broth levels. Came here during peak dinner time around 7ish on a Friday and an hour before close on a Saturday. \\n\\nAlso, you can checkout that new ice cream joint in the same plaza. Pretty neat place.

The entire wait staff was pleasant and sweet and made me feel very comfortable about bringing her along.  The ambiance was casual but upscale.  Not a super quiet, romantic restaurant, but still good for date night (or generational family dining).  \\n\\nApart from the service, the food was FABULOUS!  We started with the arancini and burrata, which were INCREDIBLE.  The flavors in the burrata dish with apple and nuts was totally unique and fabulous, almost like a dessert.  For dinner, baby had the gnocchi which was among the best I've had.  My mother had the trout and I had the snapper.  Both fish were great, but didn't quite live up to fabulousness that was the burrata - that dish just set the bar so freaking high!  For dessert, we finished with the almond cake, which was just the right amount of sweetness and the chocolate flourless cake, which was rich and thick, but not in a way that kept me from eating the whole thing.  :-)  So we ended on a high note.\\n\\nCakes & Ale - I cannot wait to come back.

Jack Allen's does a good job of supporting local markets for their fresh produce and local distilleries, micro breweries, and wineries, for their beer, wine, and liquor. Kerri is a mac and cheese connoisseur and therefor she could not pass up on the 5 Cheese Macaroni with Achiote chicken. It was a generous portion with a nice presentation, and DELICIOUS! I wanted to try the Ribeye Oscar that Josh told us about, but I new I was having something similar for dinner tonight. So I went with the Chicken Fried New York Strip, and I was not disappointed. At this point it was obvious that they take a lot of pride in their product, so we forced ourselves to have dessert. We chose the Blondie and, again, it was amazing. 2 entrees, 2 beers, a cocktail, and dessert for under $50. We will be back!"},{"name":"North Market","address":"59 Spruce St","city":"Columbus","stars":"4.5","text":"I would give this place a million stars if I could. It is amazing.

After drinking/eating here around 40 times over the last 3 years, I'll never go back.  The last time I went a few weeks ago, we had such a terrible experience, we'll never go back.  Our waiter forgot our order for beer and dinner, then after 30 minutes, brought the beer, but brought the wrong ones.  We received the correct beers around 15 minutes later.  Around 20 minutes later we asked him about our food status.  He tells us he'll check and says the kitchen is just busy and slow.  However, we were seated next to the computerized order entry system, and watched him put it in at that point, around an hour after we were first seated).  25 minutes later, we get our orders.  Yay.  After eating, we asked for the check.  Around 20 minutes later, I ask him for the check again.  He brings it shortly thereafter, and I try to hand him right back my credit card.  He replies \\"hey man, just cool it.\\"  With that, I get up to give the bar my check and credit card, and this waiter just doesn't get it.  He runs over to me, takes the check and card, and says \\"ok, ok, I've got it.\\"  I return to my seat, and he gives me the copy to sign.  I sign, and leave no tip, given his awful service.  But, I then felt bad for the guy, so I left a $10 bill (~20%).

I went online to check it out and saw that we could make reservations directly on their website, so I did just that. I made reservations for 7:00pm with a specific request for a table at the windows so that she could enjoy the view of the bay. We arrived at 7:15 and the hostess led us to our table - past all of the window tables which were all occupied - to OUR table - at the interior of the restaurant. I explained to her that in my reservation I requested a table at the window. She explained that people were staying longer than usual this evening and that if we wanted to wait, a table should open up in 15-20 minutes. So we waited. And waited. We were seated at our table at 7:45 - 45 minutes after our reservation time....on a MONDAY. I asked both the hostess and the waiter if anyone actually checks or reads the online reservations and they both asserted that they do - despite the fact that they were both oblivious to the fact that it was my mom's birthday, which I had noted in the reservation.\\n\\nTo add to our displeasure about the seating, the table we were seated at was DIRECTLY beneath a large fluorescent pendant-mounted light fixture that gave off a glaring dull light reminiscent of a campground bathroom. Our table was one of only two that had this type of fluorescent fixture directly above it along the wall. All of the other tables have low-level indirect lighting which improves the view out the window at night. Our view was markedly diminished by the glare of that light washing our table. So even after getting this long-awaited for, reserved table, we still did not realize the true benefit of what was supposed to be a clear view of the bay - like almost every other table has.\\n\\nI must remark that the interior is beautiful. There is a long bar near the entry that looks out at the bay through an expanse of windows behind the bartender and another round bar at the interior. The rich wood and nautical blue d√©cor is very appropriate and comfortable. Our waiter, although a little awkward, was for the most-part attentive. Not exceptional, but not horrible.\\n\\nI was eager to taste the food wanting to discover if this was going to be one of those restaurants that hangs its hat on the location, view and rich d√©cor then mails it in on the quality of the food and service. It is not. The appetizer of fried calamari was fantastic - light and crispy (as was the bread) and full of flavor. My mom got the filet mignon, rare which was delicious, although they really skimp on the greens. I ordered the baked haddock which also was delicious. Both entrees came with a generous portion of tasty mashed potatoes. All the food was great.\\n\\nPrices, while conducive to a higher-end restaurant aren't that crazy. They do not have their menu online, which is frustrating because I like to browse menus of restaurants before I arrive - not to mention get a sense of the prices.\\n\\nOur waiter offered my mom a complimentary dessert - unfortunately just as we were ready to pay the bill and head home - which was a nice gesture, but extended our already longer than desired visit . She chose the apple crisp which came with vanilla ice cream - again delicious. But despite the overture and the complimentary dessert, what I really would have preferred was for the manager to come over to our table, apologize for the wait and provide a better explanation of why we had to wait 45 minutes for a reserved table on a Monday. And perhaps wish an old woman happy birthday."},{"name":"Breakfast Club of Orlando","address":"63 E Pine St","city":"Orlando","stars":"3","text":"Worst customer service, and food in downtown orlando- \\n\\nordered my food over the phone and went to pick it up.

That isn't always 100% true at other Chipotle stores.\\n\\nTonight I came in about 10 minutes to closing, but you wouldn't have known it based on the staffers faces and body language. I went for the vegetarian burrito and noted as I orderd that I know the pinto beans have bacon (also noted on signs now) so the employee didn't have to use the line to remind me. She jokingly said, \\"so, you know these have meat, right?\\" Portion was generous and well worth the $6.25 for the burrito bowl. After moving the bowl to a plate at home I was amazed at how much food there was.\\n\\nIn case you've never visited a Chipotle, they do not have nachos. I've heard you can order them from a \\"secret menu\\" but also that they aren't worth it. Basically, the way I've heard it works is an employee prepares a burrito bowl without rice and you pay for a side of chips.\\n\\nThey do, however, have many combinations of meat, fajita vegetables, cheese, sour cream, one salad dressing, guacamole, pinto or black beans, brown or white rice and a variety of salsas they can combine to create:\\nburritos\\nburrito \\"bowls\\" (no tortilla, plated in an oval shaped bowl)\\nsalad (only one dressing available, go for a burrito bowl with heavy lettuce instead)\\nquesadillas (off menu except children's but will be made on large tortilla on request)\\ncrispy shelled or soft tacos\\n\\nThe rumor is, if you want any combination of their available ingredients, they'll assemble it. One of my favorite, but rarely used features of Chipotle is the capability to order food online. If I were doing a lunch run for an office, this would be a valuable tool. The other things I like about Chipotle overall are a nice interior and exterior seating area with good music. This location also has a parking lot, unlike the two on the west side of the river.\\n\\nI noted below that they only serve beer and wine, but the restaurant does offer margaritas as well.

Great German Village location, and the interior uses exposed brick and classic touches to create a classy but laid-back atmosphere.

It's something I probably wouldn't have chosen for myself, but I really liked it (had two, actually).

(And after dinner, I had the best chocolate martini I've ever had!)\\n\\nOur server, Michael, was knowledgeable and friendly but not overbearing. Things kick off with warm sourdough bread and their own butter with what tasted like bits of orange peppers in it. An interesting taste. What I like the most about what we had here was the obvious time and thought put into the dishes. Everything we had was appealing to not only the palate, but to the eye and the nose as well. After Michael ably explained the specials for the day, we started off with the cream of portabella mushroom soup and the signature dish of G. Michael's, the shrimp and grits. From the first bite, we knew we were in for something special. The soup was creamy but not bland, full of mushroomy goodness and topped with the right amount of crumbled gorgonzola. The shrimp and grits consists of six perfectly cooked shrimp on a bed of creamy grits with andouille sausage, smoked country ham, and a tomatoey broth. Wow. The smokiness of the ham, combined with the right amount of heat from the sausage and broth, combines perfectly with the grits and shrimp. We pretty much inhaled it.\\n\\nHubby got the trout, which was fresh and cooked to perfection. I got the pork tenderloin, with green beans and sweet potato slices. Heaven.

With the sudden surge of popularity and choices for dishes like 'Xiao Long Bao' (XLB for short) and everyone claiming their handmade steamed dumplings are the \\"BOMB\\" and then being not disappointed, but leaving no lasting impression on me I had a great experience here that has already made my mind plot out the next time I shall come back to eat here again, whether it's the same order, or other things on the menu I will be back sooner than you think!\\n\\nWith that being said, this place is located right next to Claypot Hot Pot, and if you know this plaza, depending on what time of the day you are in here, the parking lot can be a freaking zoo. People driving cars that they are incapable of driving, spots that are not suited for big vehicles (door ding plaza delight!) and that's not even getting out of your car yet. Then you gotta get here, and the day we were here (remember the early shift shuts down at 3!) at about 1:45 it was packed on the outside. There is no real waiting area here, so it's better to just wait outside, but that maybe a bad idea if they call your name, as on this occassion they went by a couple of two, that had to re-position themselves on the waiting sheet.\\n\\nThe restaurant is actually a fair size, with some big tables, mostly rectangular 2's, so you could play Tetris in here to get the right combination, but if your coming in a big group for the morning rush, all I can say to you, is good luck to you! So we waited, as it was just me and my partner, not too long, 20 minutes, and at this time we already looked through the menu/self order sheet. You can ask for the english sheet, and just tick (or number) the dishes you are wanting, price is also listed on this as well.\\n\\nThis place is busy, from the people eating, to the workers running left and right to serve, and clean the tables to the staff in the kitchen wrapping the XLB's fresh, to cooking up all the food that needs to be served, yet the service here is pretty good. On occassion I was asking for chili oil, and other things, and they quickly got it to me, and they were running around busy!\\n\\nSo between the two of us, we ordered a savoury soy milk, XLB, savoury sticky rice balls, and my delightful 'chi fan gao' or fried blocks of stick rice! The savoury soy milk is always a great starter for a Shanghainese first meal of the day. This one was clean, as you can really taste the soy, and they did not over pollute this dish by adding too much dried shrimp, or pickled vegetables, and added a tiny bit of chili oil for flavour and color. Some Chinese donut pieces that were thinly sliced were swimming above, and this hit the spot!\\n\\nWhen the XLB arrived, I was surprised to see these 6 very plump dumplings. Looking at the detailed folds from above, and the thin-ness of the skin, where you can see the soup soaking the meat inside, I just wanted to dip my chopsticks in. Even though some of the XLB's were stuck together due to expanding while cooking, with some precision chopstick work we were able to seperate each without having the skin break, and the soup escape to the murky depths of the bamboo steamer! You could literally fill a Chinese soup spoon with the soup of one XLB, and the flavour was just perfect, so good that you really didn't even need the vinegar. \\n\\nNext came the savoury sticky rice balls, they had sharp tips on them to show that they weren't machine made. The skin on them, was sticky, chewy, not too much so, and held the meaty surprise with all the juices inside. I saw my partner smiling after chewing into one, and almost having the juice squirt at her, as she was not expecting it to be so delicious. After trying this, I am very intrigued on trying their black sesame ones..... till next time... which will be soon.\\n\\nWhen my partner pointed out the fried stick rice block (chi fan gao) I was just ecstatic. As in another review, to find this dish at any Shanghainese restaurant is a rarity, even to find it in Shanghai is rare, unless you know what street vendor to go to. The dish came, nicely deep fried, where you can tell that they were using clean oil. Each square piece held together just right, and biting into one was like reliving my childhood. This is an evil dish too cause it's just rice..... but it's oh so freaking good!\\n\\nThe bill came to less than $20, and we were stuffed, but already talking about what we wanted to order next time. Now this is what I call a memorable meal, that I shall return. Also to note that the other dishes we saw at other tables were huge. From the soup noodles to the fried noodles and pastries, not monster big, but definitely not being ripped off. The price is right, and the food is excellent!

The first thing I was struck with was the informal look and feel, it did not have the trappings of a fine dining restaurant, more of a casual neighborhood brasserie (waiters and staff uniforms, the table layouts (small and close), lack of fine lighting and fixtures), but nonetheless had a cozy warm feel.  Once I saw the prices ($85pp for the tasting menu, another $40pp for the wine pairings, and in the end $5 a bottle for water)...that's when things seemed off. I really enjoy tasting menus, but for prices comparable to the other stalwarts in Atlanta (Restaurant Eugene, Aria), I really expected more from the experience.  Both in the refinement of the dishes but also the experience.  Unpretentious and approachable is fine, but they can't expect to charge the mark-up of a highly refined dining experience and deliver something that is much less than.  For instance, I was at a table crammed between two other tables along a wall very close, and those other diners were there just for shorter a la carte meals...our conversations overlapped a lot.  Lighting didn't line up with tables.  No table cloths.  Decent flatware...all fine, just not for the price.  The music ranged from outkast to jazz, which again was fine but didn't give me the feeling of a super high-end, $340 check for two, restaurant.\\n\\nNow, on to the food...there were quite a number of amuse-bouches (which they called 'gifts from the kitchen), including a beverage, and those were perhaps more numerous and thought out than the average tasting menu.  Standouts were the pork rind with persimmon butter, the house cured pork salami with peppercorns, and my favorite thing of the night the fermented potato sourdough balls with whipped olive oil - a true delight.  Our favorite dish by a margin was the Farro and celeriac dish with sunflower and compressed apple.  It was delicate, balanced, unique, and delicious.  These standouts (along with the mission and TGK) are the reason I gave the restaurant a 4 and would go back later if things refine a bit as they often do with new restaurants that have promise and great talent in the kitchen.\\n\\nLess successful were a few dishes, including the first couple of things: a 'gift' with fermented salmon made japanese style in house, it tasted more like it was done to be experimental than to taste great.  The first course, buttermilk, caviar, potato, seaweed - it was a bit one-note and the fried part took over the whole rest of the otherwise light dish.  The final desert with teh check was a truffle that was by both of our accounts almost inedible- so salty and pungent...actually very displeasing.  Other items that were good but not great like the tartare and the squab...that would be OK at a lower price with lower expectations, but at this top range I would expect the courses to be each either very good or better, and some memorable/exceptional, and also for the meal to have more of a narrative or flow and cohesive culinary perspective.  In that vein, all of the dishes together lacked the right flow, and the wine pairings felt a bit soft for me.  Great European wines, many obscure varietals, so on their own very good, but just the pairing with the foods themselves seemed soft...it wasn't immediately obvious to me that each wine should go with each dish, but I'm not an expert on this so I will give the benefit of the doubt.  So - great promise, obviously some culinary talent and passion for food, but needs refinement and probably lower prices or a rethink of the model."},{"name":"Capo Restaurant","address":"443 West Broadway","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"Horrible service. Came here on St. Patrick's Day with three friends. I completely understand that this is Southie on St. Pat's and things can get stressful; however, our experience here was unacceptable. We waited in line for an hour and when we finally got in, we asked the hostess for a table. She looked at me and said, \\"well, what are you going to order?\\" I told her I didn't know, I'd never seen the menu before. She said, \\"if you're just gonna, like, get one pizza to share at the table, you can't sit.\\" I told her, \\"we'd be happy to order more than that, we were waiting in line for an hour and we're cold and hungry.\\" She rolled her eyes and pointed at someone to show us to the table. Our waiter was then extremely unpleasant. He didn't smile once and he gave us dirty looks. Considering the crowd of drunk and obnoxious twenty-somethings, I feel that he should have been happy to wait on us, as we were very easygoing, ordered drinks and meals. All in all, I'd never return to this place.

Fantastic, seriously. Large moist meatballs, lots of tasty sauce, thick slices of cheese, and hefty bread. Most places make a saucy meatball sub but throw it all on a puny subroll, so it gets wet and falls apart; you end up eating your sandwich in pieces. The bread was crusty enough to hold it all together but soft enough so it didnt break your jaw. May have been one of the, if not THE, best meatball panini/sub Ive had yet. \\n\\nAlso, some of the best customer service Ive ever had as well. The front guy saw me eyeing the meatballs in the display and asked if i wanted a sample. The guy grabs an entire meatball, throws it on a skillet, and heats it up for me. They then give me some chicken parm, and EVERY flavor of gelato they had. Just so I could try it. I felt like a king. \\n\\nThe panini itself was done in about 5 minutes. \\n\\nI know this sounds like I work for them or something, but Im just literally blown away by how awesome my experience was here. 10/10, two thumbs up, 5 stars.

Being $$$ and pretty sure it was a more dressy upscale experience, we did take the time to dress everyone up in dresses, skirts, ties and all.  It sure helped us fit in a bit more and enjoy our experience at this nationally recognized restaurant. \\n\\nThey had complimentary valet upon arrival, wasn't prepared for that and didn't have any cash :/. Made a reservation, which they were able to seat us early to which was great since we had three younger kids with us. The waitress addressed me by name and was so patient with us and the kids. \\n\\nThe meal started with a complimentary assorted bread basket with what tasted like homemade butter. Also a flat flour crisp of sorts was served as well with a little herb spice going on, which my husband loved.  We ordered their signature rabbit (which was wonderful) and the sweet potato ravioli and vegetables with it were very good, at $25 ish I recall. We also had the basil pasta with vegetables at $17. So good. Proportions were on the smaller side but still appropriately filling, expectable for this level of restaurant.  The kids enjoyed generous portions of chicken strips and French fries and Parmesan farfalle noodles.  Each I believe were $10. \\n\\nWe followed our meals sampling two desserts included the chocolate grotto which is a chocolate ball shell filled with a chocolate cream and salted caramel sprinkled in pretzel dust and a rhubarb crisp with strawberry ice cream and oatmeal crunch.  Each $8.  The grotto was rich but delicious and the rhubarb crisp was one of my favorite desserts of our trip. \\n\\nOverall, I really enjoyed our visit.

We were seated promptly at the high tops towards the \\"garage doors\\" at the front of the restaurant and it was mysteriously cold.  Our server showed up quickly and was great about getting our beer orders in and then the food, no issues there at all.  \\n\\nThere were six of us and all of us ending up ordering the peanut butter burger because we were told it was going to be incredible by someone in our group.  Peanut butter is my favorite food of all time so it's not like I'm gonna be stupid and pass this up. I get so beyond excited over one, ONE, item on a menu and it turns out to be an utter disappointment.  \\n\\nHoly underwhelmed.  First off, the bun wasn't fresh at all.  The bottom was as hard as a rock.  After two bites I thought to myself, \\"maybe this is just a less soft bun like a deli style hard roll that will hold up to a thick burger\\".  Nope, not even close and I'm now convinced it was just stale.  I regret never saying anything or even sending it back, it's rare that I'll do that but this was almost inedible.  The burger patty itself, ordered medium rare, barely leaked a single juice and had to be overcooked.  The lights are so dim in the front area of the bar that I couldn't tell by looking at it.  The peanut butter was even a little scarce on top, nothing about it wowed me in any way.  My slaw I ordered on the side was super bland and I couldn't find any pepper to add to it on the table so I just bit the slaw bullet and continued on.  \\n\\nThe star feature of the night was the poutine tator tots.  They were ordered after our meal because they were unwilling to bend on adding them to our burger order.  What?  ANYTHING can be ordered as a side you nitwits.....we didn't care if you added another $5 to our items.  That was really lame and such a turnoff when it comes to customer service.  Luckily, they didn't disappoint.  They weren't \\"smothered\\" in gravy and had just enough crunch to them, even though they were covered in brown, decadent goo.\\n\\nI didn't drink but did notice the beer menu and the selection here is better than most of Boston but fairly standard for a Cambridge joint like this.  Man, I wish even a few days later I would have told the waiter about the burger and gotten another.  I found out after we were done that few others were impressed either and that they had the same issue with the buns.

So, all of the people who called ahead and said that they would be there at 8:30 showed up at 8:30?  Weird.  \\n\\nThen the buzzers weren't working.

Much better atmosphere during the day. The sausage was very tasty (especially for pub food), and they have a ton of beers. Later at night there are tons of DBs, and it gets very crowded.\\n\\nNow the things that I wanted to point out, that I think warranted another review (even though this place has tons of reviews already). \\nI brew my own beer, and have been brewing for three years. I have a kegerator, all grain set up, etc. etc, so I like to think that I know my beer, and what a good fresh pint should taste like. That said, every beer I've had from the flying saucer has had something wrong with it (and keep in mind I've had these same IPAs/Belgiums/Wheats other places). It's either under carbonated, old and stale tasting, or has flavors that don't belong. I'd attribute this to dirty taps or lines, wrong dispensing pressure, etc. It just seems like they need to learn how to take care of their taps, lines, and pressure. Maybe it's just me, but I've never gotten that \\"fresh\\" taste that I get from my own kegerator, or at other places like the gingerman.\\nThey do have great specials on Monday and Sunday, but even at low prices I'm ALWAYS disappointed in the quality of my pints when I get them here. Maybe I'm just very particular and most people can't tell a difference.\\n\\nThe other thing is a lot of reviewers mention college age kids at night (even if they are frat/sorority types). The times I've been there at night, the crowd was older then college age, at least in their mid to late twenties. It seemed like most of them lived in the triangle too (which most college kids can't come close to affording, unless daddy pays for everything)\\n\\nI tried giving them three stars, but I was really bummed out with the quality my Racer 5 and Full moon rye last night.

Lots of chunks of achiote chicken, thinly sliced pears and figs with crumbled blue cheese and just the right amount of dressing.

I wouldn't mind paying what we paid if the portions were larger however a lunch size portion of entree plus a scoop of rice does not equal the price associated.

After slamming it down and Turing around I tried the coffee and it was extremely watery. I apologized and nicely explained how it tastes watery and asked if she would you mind re making it. She turned around and stared at me in a very aggressive rude manner for a while before speaking, then with a snippy attitude she rolled her eyes and took the coffee to remake it, she asked what the order was and as I told her she walked away and continued rolling her eyes. She almost made the wrong coffee if I didn't correct her again and tell her the right amount of sugar. I watched her load the coffee with cream once again. I am a regular and I know what 2 creams looks like. Both employees I had asked began yelling at me about how \\"it wasn't right again\\" they were extremely rude and annoyed.

One employee then rose her voice and told me she wasn't rude and that she \\"wasn't arguing with a child\\" I was completely offended and appalled by this. I should never be spoken to like this. Dunkin donuts preaches that if they don't make your coffee right, they will remake it. I was very polite in asking for my coffee the right way and to have two employees attack me in a complete un professional way is disgusting.

That said, I'm absolutely glad I made the trek. \\n\\nParking for dinner was valet only (but complementary). \\n\\nThe restaurant is gorgeous. I loved the curved ceiling in the main dining area - it definitely felt like the inside of a canoe. \\n\\nThis was my first visit to Canoe, though I think I've tried some of their fare at taste of Atlanta or a similar event. On this visit, I sampled two appetizers, one entree, and three desserts (priorities, right?). Also, as you can probably surmise I also ate my weight (roughly) in truffle fries; they are typically served alongside the duck burger but we ordered them by themselves. \\n\\nAPPS\\n- Jumbo Lump Crab Cake, Yuzu, Napa Cabbage Slaw ($16): a really great crab cake. It's almost entirely lump crab with a thin but very crispy seared crust. The yuzu is smeared on the plate - I highly advise you coat as much of your crab cake in it as possible because that citrusy sour flavor blends so well with the richness of the crab cake. \\n- Kung Pao Australian Octopus, Rice Noodle, Broccoli, Snow Pea, Peanut ($16): a little messy for my taste but really excellent. It was just spicy enough and the octopus could not have been more tender. Honestly this is a large enough appetizer you could almost get away with it as a light meal. \\n\\nMAIN\\nFor my main course I ordered the Slow Roasted Rabbit, Sunchoke & Goat's Cheese Ravioli, Candied Garlic Jus ($31). It wasn't a particularly beautiful dish but I scraped the plate clean! (As did the other person at my table who ordered it, I should mention.) The rabbit was fork tender and paired nicely with the creamy ravioli. \\n\\nDESSERTS - all $9\\n- Chocolate Grotto, Salted Caramel, Pretzel Dust: this is the \\"famous\\" Canoe dessert I'v heard about and I've got to say the best part of it was that pretzel dust. More pastry chefs should learn to incorporate saltiness into rich chocolate desserts. It just heightens all the rest of the flavors. \\n- Popcorn Ice Cream Sundae, Canoe's Cracker Jack: another pretty well-known dessert. Honestly, not my jam, but I was alone in that opinion at our table of 5. \\n- The nightly \\"sorbet composition\\" was a blood orange sorbet (made in-house) sitting on sponge cake, topped with a whiskey-filled ice cube. You were supposed to tap the ice cube with your spoon to release the whiskey over the dessert. I can't even tell you how good this was on a February night - YUM. \\n\\nOverall - really enjoyed my experience. I think at this price point it's not a place I would come all the time, but would make an effort for a special datenight - or brunch. (IDK about you but brunch just makes things like driving OTP seem reasonable.) \\n\\nDisclaimer, I was trying to be casual about Yelping at a work dinner so please excuse the photo quality...

If you get shrimps and scallops, you need to order desert. If you order cheaper materials like ducks and beef, you will feel full. My crisped duck confit seems a favorite on table, but it was not that great to me. Yes, duck legs are tender, but the juice is somewhat salty. I still favor Au Rendez-Vous.

It was a Friday night, I was disappointed, but I was excited to try them at another time. I figured if they were that busy, they had to have great food. I went back a second time. This time it was a 10 minute wait, and we were sat at a high top that was right next to the host's desk. We sat at our table for about 10 minutes before the host asked us if our waiter has seen us. He started to take our drink orders when our waiter walked up, so we repeated our orders to him. Beers came about 10 more minutes later. He gave me the wrong beer, but I happened to like the beer he brought so I didn't complain. About 15 minutes later the host got our waiter's attention again to let him know we wanted to order. I had a question about something on the menu, and then I ordered. When we got our food another 15 minutes later I realized the waiter wrote down the item I had a question about, and my order so I ended up with both....way too much food. Food that I didn't actually want, I just had a question about it. Well, I dealt with it. Both items (Kimchi fried rice & Chicken curry) were great. I also got edamame & chicken egg rolls for appetizers, and those were good. Towards the end of the meal, we waited around for a good 20 minutes before they noticed we were sitting around waiting for a box & the check. I noticed our waiter was dealing with some large tables in the back, so I understood his neglect. I just felt at a lot of points it was kind of ridiculous. He never asked how the food even was, which might not be a big deal, but I feel like every waiter/waitress/manger/etc. has always asked how the food was.  The only way I'll eat from here again is if I order take-out. Great food, but the service didn't impress me. That service just killed the mood of the whole meal for me. And I didn't really care to have the employees folding and stacking menus right at my table and gossiping about work & life (remember we were seated literally right beside the host desk).

Wow, is this an interesting find.  The menu is quite a hodgepodge of all sorts of items and styles.  Some would call it fusion, but I would just call it tasty.\\n\\nWhile just strolling around looking for a place to snag dinner, my friend and I noticed this place nestled in the corner of its building, enticed by the deck overlooking the street up on the second floor.  Walking up the stairs, we were seated right away on a delightful outside deck, though sadly not the one overlooking the street, ordered our drinks, and then set to work browsing their extensive and quite varied menu.  Reading through, you see sushi, noodle dishes, salads, French fries, fish, chicken, and so on.  There is certainly no shortage of ways you can mix things up to give yourself an incredibly unique and tailored dining experience.\\n\\nMy friend and I ended up each ordering the Loco Moco Chicken as our entree, along with some sides to share.  This main dish, done sort of in the style of the more familiar Hawaiian beef breakfast I have seen before, is instead chicken in a yummy sauce with mixed greens all over rice and topped with a fried egg.  Letting the yolk run down and mix in with the rest of the food just adds a great richness to the flavor.  The appetizers we ordered included a spicy salmon sushi roll, and octopus takuyaki, which are fried little egg-batter dumplings with octopus inside them.  Both were awesome.  I also ordered one special item just for me, a piece of foie gras sushi.  Admittedly, this is my first experience with foie gras, and I found myself really enjoying this small bite quite thoroughly.\\n\\nThe restaurant itself, as I said, is located in the second-floor level overlooking the street.  It has a really neat decorative theme and vibe to it, and a couple outside deck areas.  The staff were very friendly and great at coming around to check on us.

However, I ordered a chicken quesadilla tonight and needless to say I was far from impressed. They served me a giant 12 inch slab of meat and cheese in a taco shape form thrown into a to go container. The cooks did not desire to slice the quesadilla in any way shape or form they just decided to toss it into a to go container and shove it in my direction in which I had to rip pieces away in order to eat. I happen to be on my way out of town and I was traveling, so the fact that the giant quesadilla was not sliced happen to be an extreme inconvenience on my part as far as getting to go food and wanting to eat it conveniently. It's like ordering a pizza and getting it un-sliced. Are you supposed to tear through a pizza piece by piece while you eat it? No. Seem to be expected from a quesadilla. The chef expects you to tear it apart as you eat it? I think not. A quesadilla should be sliced into pie like sections as to be easily eaten.

The first thing out of BOTH of the bartenders mouths was \\"go to Trackside\\", and we did. I was a bit skeptical at first, it's a bit far from the Midtown area that we were previously in, and upon approach wondered what kind of place could exist inside that could possibly be so great. The first thing you notice is that there's no parking in the street, however they have a pretty massive lot behind the building where finding a spot is not an issue. Upon entering the first thing I noticed was how spacious it is, yet somehow full of life. The patrons here are fantastic. The people here are diverse, friendly, and sociable. There are two pool tables and 3 or four dart boards for your gaming pleasure. Their beer selection and prices are admirable, and they even offer pitchers of Allagash White if you're into that sort of thing. (which I am) All in all, this is the kind of place I will definitely come when I have guests from out of town on a Sunday night that want to stay out past 12.

Because I was in a biscuit mood, at the counter, I selected the Breakfast BBQ with my side option being the parmesan grits, and my breakfast buddy who was visiting from out of town, who happens to be a pimento cheese junkie, got the Sunrise Grilled Cheese. Both meals were about $9.\\n\\nIt look a little while for our breakfasts to come out from the kitchen even though the dining room wasn't packed. No matter, we occupied our time by sampling a cube of superb golden chocolate cake and ogling the desserts chilling in their cases. The \\"pulled pork BBQ on a buttermilk biscuit with crispy bacon, fried egg & tomatillo salsa\\" hit the spot for sure. I was kind of concerned since I hate cilantro and fretted that the salsa would be swimming in it, but I was worried for nothing. The salsa was definitely less up front in the flavors department. The biscuit ticked all the boxes for qualities you'd desire in a biscuit, and the barbecue was tops. And you can't argue with bacon. I have to come back for breakfast again since I want to try the grilled cheese; I was eyeballing it all during our meal.\\n\\nYou would expect the inside of Southern Sweets to match the industrial theme of the neighborhood, but it's artsy and whimsical inside, with lots of paintings decorating the dining area. I found out later that the owner is an artist and painted a bunch of the pieces hanging on the walls. How awesome. I loved the close-ups of produces (apples, onions). Such vibrant colors.\\n\\nYou name your bakery poison, Southern Sweets has got it: layer cakes, pound cakes, cheesecakes, pies, bars, cookies, vegan concoctions, and so on. I've had the vegan carrot cake, carrot spice, key lime pie, German chocolate, and chocolate raspberry mousse, and they were all great (the German chocolate was a tad too sweet), but I was blown away by the chocolate peanut butter mousse cake. Heaven! My buddy loved the golden chocolate, and I really liked the red velvet too. The cake is not too crumbly and certainly not dry. The frosting on the golden chocolate wasn't too sugary either. And I can't forget to add that the cake slices, at 6 bucks each, were enormous.

Take your pick. \\n\\n3. We had the hamburger and pimento cheese sandwich/tomato soup with a side of the crab grits. The burger was fine but nothing special. \\n\\n4. As for the rest, they were all cold upon arrival to the table so there were obviously some issues regarding timing in the kitchen. When I mentioned that these items were cold, the waitress informed me that they had \\"just come out of the oven\\" and shouldn't be cold.

After all how can you mess up a great beer brand. \\nLet's begin, yes the \\"service staff\\" seem angry/ slow, but I think it is because they are trying to run the 49 seat location with one person. I came in a 9:30 am on. Sunday, two other guest and the one server was stocking retail/paper items, rolling silverware, getting ready to switch over from breakfast to lunch and oh yeah- waiting on the customer. I felt sorry for her and just waited for 30 minutes while talking to other customers you told me good luck with getting service. After catching up on some emails and voice messages. I tracked / cornered her as asked how did service here work. In the spirit of \\"The Varsity, she asked , \\" what will you have\\" ? I ordered the spicy sausage breakfast sandwich and water to start and I did want to get a beer as well. She replied -\\"you will be my last breakfast, thank god, oh it will have to be on a ciabatta because we are out of bagels and ok, just have a seat.

But I still had no beverage water or beer, so I proceeded back to the bar to ask for water and a beer. This time the cook was behind the bar and she motioned to the server folding t- shirts to come help me. She immediately made me a water  and asked me what I wanted now. I asked about the UFO beers, she replied that they were out of the wheat.

It's very \\"now\\" - reclaimed woods, mason jars on open shelving (though I think most of these are for decoration purposes only -- woulda been cooler if they were clearly part of the storage routine!). White subway tile. I like this aesthetic even if it's becoming overplayed. \\n\\nFood quality is great, and it's a fantastic start for The Carvery. Everything I tasted oozed the benefits of a privileged upbringing.

I know Bryant M. got them to make him a sweet looking salad on his wheat-free visit, but that option isn't clear from the menu. It says \\"Salad Greens $6, Choice of Meat $2\\" -- which, by itself, is kind of confusing. It doesn't seem like a good indication of a properly complete salad, let alone for $8 total. Sounds like some meat on leaves. Besides, as I'll discuss later in this review, it looks like your meat choices are either pork or turkey. (Right now Bryant's salad is the cover pic for The Carvery entry on Yelp, and while it's a beautiful pic and a good reminder to ask questions at businesses, it's not really a menu item per se.)\\n\\nAvailable sides are potato salad, or a daily pasta salad creation. And by the way, that's to go with the loaf of bread you just got with your sandwich (albeit a delicious, chewy, pillowy loaf).\\n\\nThere were 6 sandwich options to choose from: Porchetta (pork), meatball (pork in the meatball mix), turkey (with bacon), BLT (bacon), daily vegetarian creation, and the daily special (today, pulled pork). Yep, only ONE of those was oink-free! And it was the veg option! I suppose you could ask for the turkey with no bacon, but... c'mon.\\n\\nOh, and today's soup selection? Black bean with (you guessed it!) bacon.\\n\\nLook, I love pork, and I rarely avoid it. But I feel like these sandwich options need a little more variety. They all kind of had a similar flavor profile. \\n\\nQuality meats (mostly pork). Amazing bread. Good start.\\n\\nI usually applaud a small menu, but it needs to be a little more diverse. \\n\\nIf it were me running the menu at The Carvery, I'd go for 2 entree salads (one rotating daily special and one signature), soup of the day, keep the potato and rotating pasta salad if you must (add a bean salad or roasted veg side plz), and then maybe 3 signature sandwiches with the rotating vegetarian and daily specials (for a total of 5 sandwich options per day). I'd recommend a roast beef, turkey, and the porchetta for the signature sammies to get the full \\"carvery\\" theme.\\n\\nI know that's a lot of daily specials -- but that's what's going to keep us downtown working stiffs coming back to your place week after week.

When we told her we didn't care what \\"zone\\" we were in, she stormed off, got hot sauce, and came back to verbally attack us while calling us belligerent.  Pot meet kettle.  I imagine she was covering for a co-worker who wasn't doing their job, and it was a particularly busy morning, but her attitude and failure to delegate to other staff combined with the hostess' near zombie status was enough to make this the most bizarre and unappetizing dining experience ever.

We've never had to make reservations before but today we were told that if we didn't have reservations we could wait an hour or eat at the bar. This wouldn't be surprising, except the place was barely half full. Since we were meeting someone, we decided to accept the bar seating. Not only was it horribly uncomfortable, but the entire time we were there, a booth was empty as well as several other 2 person tables. We were never offered any other seating options and at no point were all the tables occupied. I noticed there were two sets of couples also corralled to the bar when there were plenty of tables that could accommodate them. The whole experience was very disappointing and if reservations are now required to be seated at a table, we probably won't return.

The flavors mixed and burst with successful surprises.  Created my own tasting menu from small plates in the order written below.  Started with one each of the cold water oysters of the day, the Shigoku, WA, slightly sweet, earthy; and the Beau Soleil, New Brunswick, lightly briny with a \\"marine\\" flavor (like seawater).  The Vermont burrata with walnut pesto and cranberry-vinaigrette marinated kale was an eye-rolling fantastic blend of textures (creamy/oozy burrata, crunchy crostini), flavors (nutty/herby/garlicky pesto, bitter kale) and accents (sweet-tart vinaigrette).  The tatsoi salad was a refreshing blend of bitter peppery flavors (tatsoi, daikon radish, green onions) highlighted by the sweetness of the carmelized roasted carrots and shaved D'anjou pear all rounded out with a hint of fragrant, nutty toasted sesame oil.  Arancini (crunchy crusted, tender inside, deep-fried rice balls filled with oozy cheese), had a whiff of lemon and surprising punch of fennel pollen (strong licorice flavor) for interest.\\n\\nThe plates I tried all exhibited a successful, thoughtful balance of flavors and textures.  The only, really only misstep:  desserts not up to par with the savory foods (although that bar is set very high).  The Macadamia Nut Tart and Persimmon Gelato was the least successful of everything I had; tart and nuts were vaguely chewy, neither crisp crusted either in the pastry or on the nut glaze and you would like, the Persimmon gelato showing a slightly unsettling \\"stickiness\\".  I tried my friend's chocolate cake, it was not too sweet (a good thing), but also not spectacular, as I would expect after suc a meal.  The cocktails, however, fortunately show that same thoughtfullness as applied to the food. The Winter Solstice was like a sweet-tart boozy version of mulled apple cider, great on a suddenly wintry night.\\n\\nThe interior of the restaurant is dimly lit, starkly modern; one thing to note, the place is extremely noisy (bare walls and floors), a firetruck rolled by the window I was sitting next to at full blast and I heard nary a squeal from the siren.

A lot of restaurants never achieve the delicacy and taste that Junji is able to achieve. We also had panko encrusted oysters, which were cooked to perfection and topped with Junji's homemade sauce. They were delicious. The mackerel was grilled wonderfully, although we were a little disappointed it was one small piece. In Japan, they'll usually deliver the whole fish, so that's what we were hoping for. Nonetheless, it was very good. We also ordered some sashimi, which was perfectly prepared and quite tasty. \\n\\nThe only real negative was the service. It was a bit slow.

Skip fast food and support local business and local farmers."},{"name":"Jack Allen's Kitchen Oak Hill","address":"7720 Hwy 71 W","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"Southwest Austin is a graveyard for high end restaurants.\\n\\nThis particular site has had at least 5 different restaurants over the past 5 years - the Y Bar & Grille, Nunzia, Senorita's- each a paltry resurrection of the previous incarnation.\\n\\nFinally- it's been reborn as an excellent restaurant.  Gone are the 90s blue-green color scheme, the faux-tacky Mexican artifacts and the hideous fried seafood buffet from the previous incarnations.  And thankfully- the new owners have fixed the hideous acoustics that made this location so difficult to have a conversation in.\\n\\nThe new restaurant is from the same people behind the old Z-Tejas- the chef Jack Allen Gilmore was responsible for the great dishes that Z-Tejas had back in the day.  And he's a stickler for quality- each dish has quality ingredients, many from local sources.\\n\\nWhy do I know about the Z-Tejas connection?  Because the first time that I went there for lunch, I recognized one of my favorite dishes from Z-Tejas: the Navajo Taco.  Only this was an improved version- a very complex concoction of complex flavors- smoky, spicy, sweet- depending on whcih side of the plate you attacked.  Unfortunately, it's an item that was only on the daily specials menu.  \\n\\nThe second time I went, my partner and I started with the spinach gorgonzola ravioli.  The mystery of this dish is why it's on the appetizer menu- it's worthy of being a main course.  The nice thing about having it as an appetizer is that it is a bit rich, so splitting it with one or more other people does make it less filling.  The dish is a somewhat bland ravioli in a delicious mix of sundried tomato, gorgonzola, parmesan, walnut with a delicous grilled ciabatta toast on the side.  It's a perfect combination- the ravioli doesn't overpower the delicious and complicated sauce.\\n\\nFor the main course, I had the Pumpkin Seed Pesto Marinated Chicken Breast.  My partner had the Steak and Argula Salad.\\n\\nThe chicken was excellent.  It was nicely grilled with a nice charcoal flavor.  The side was an artichoke gratin- imagine a well-done potato au gratin only with artichoke instead of potato.  My one criticism of the dish was that the chicken was served with a sauce that was a bit too sharp- presumably from goat cheese.  It wasn't bad or overpowering- just a bit off in flavor in texture.  But that's a picky comment- it is by far one of the best chicken dishes that I've had since the heyday of the old Castle Hill Cafe.\\n\\nMy partner's salad was also excellent.  Often, the beef served with a salad is lower grade skirt steak.  Not here.  This was a well-prepared tenderloin- flavorful and so tender that it felt like it would melt in your mouth.  It was grilled but there was no sign of toughness or gristle.  It was served with nearly perfect french-style onion rings.  The argula was fresh and it was doused with capers and a mustard dressing that was very well balanced.\\n\\nI mentioned Castle Hill Cafe.  For long-time Austinites, the old Castle Hill back in the 1990s was a very uniquely Austin experience- Southwestern fusion cuisine with fanciful and imaginative flavors.  This restaurant captures a lot of that old style Austin cuisine that featured complex flavors and spices and textures.\\n\\nIt's rare that I pass on dessert.  Between the rich appetizer and the main courses, I was very full.  The dessert choices (not listed on the menu) were unfortunately a bit too heavy.  After considering to get something to go, we did decide to pass because we felt like the dessert wouldn't be the same unless it was fresh.  Since we'll definitely be returning, we'll have to plan better the next time so that we can have dessert.\\n\\nOne of the reasons that this location has had so many different restaurants is that it is a bit of a drive and everyone dreads dealing with the \\"Y\\" at 290 and 71 on a weekday.  But if you're a longtime Austin resident and you miss the old days of original restaurants like Castle Hill and Z-Tejas, this is worth the trip."},{"name":"Southside Flying Pizza","address":"11600 Manchaca Rd, Ste A","city":"Austin","stars":"2.5","text":"Delicious light lunch options.

These were all split between all of us.  Chili cheese fries in my opinion was better than poutine. The sides were great.

Instead they gave us the option of either a high-top table or the bar. We went with the high top-table, which had convenient hooks for purses and jackets beneath the table.

The cheese itself really didn't have the smoky quality.\\n\\nFor my main dish, I went with the pork belly small plate. It was supposed to be with an Asian flare. I thought the pork belly was over cooked, the soy-based sauce on the plate was too salty, and the bok choy was wilted. It could've been awesome, but it was more of a flop. My friend had the hush puppies, which were standard but nothing special. \\n\\nI finished with a chocolate mousse pudding with creme fraiche, which came with little chocolate cookies.

I was told that it was a Grease Pit, that the food wasn't that good, and that I should avoid it, but alas I listened to that person attentively and went anyway. It wasn't really their food so much that garnered a rating just below fandom so much as the service (or lack thereof!)\\n\\nI went in at a time that most would consider a later breakfast, but still not quite even an early lunch. I wasn't really in the mood for breakfast food even though this 24 hour diner servess a full menu all day and night. I looked at the specials board and was intrigued by two thing. The first was an Eggs Benedict (two issues here... first I I had never had them before and wasn't in the mood for breakfast anyway and two I figured I'd wait to get them somewhere \\"better\\") and a Philly Cheesesteak.\\n\\nAfter careful thought I had decided I was in the mood to try one of their burgers so I ended up ordering their Rustler Burger: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/fat-daves-vancouver?select=tLSDx4IxVd5i8ci8zaB_AQ#uihcUVaf2WiR1lv6VRsYJQ which is basically a regular American Cheeseburger with all your normal fixins plus the addition of a Fried Egg and Ham.

I actually found myself eating slowly and savoring every bite... especially because it was cold and rainy outside and I really had no other plans on this day.\\n\\nNow to my biggest concern and why Fat Dave's basically gets a \\"Get Out of Jail Free\\" card: I went in on New Year's Day so there was only 1 server holding down the Fort. I don't know if this is normal for that time of day or because it was a holiday or what, but she came around a couple times in the beginning when I didn't really need her, but then basically forgot about me? I'm pretty low maintenence so really the only thing I truly like while I'm dining is for my drink to remain filled. Mine didn't here at all. I received no refills at all or even an inquiry for one even though I put my empty glass on the edge of my table sort of as a hint to my thirs. Also I had to request my bill after sitting patiently done for awhile.\\n\\n I figured all of this might of been a fluke so instead of forgetting about this place I'd give them one more shot out of curiosity.\\n\\nThe decor inside although very nostalgic is also very dated.

When we walked in we ended up sitting at the bar over looking the pizza oven. We were the only ones seated there besides the two employees at the end eating...right next to the napkins and clean silver waiting to be rolled which was next to two half eaten what looked like employee meals that were now a magnet for the flies. \\nMy son and I placed our order: me - HH Caesar  salad and HH Mac & Cheese, My 17 yo son- side salad and Lasagna. Simple right?! We watched our salads be made by a guy who came running out of the kitchen to deal with the salads and pizzas. He made them quickly and then set them out to be served to us...5 min later. Not really sure why they sat there, maybe the flies needed to taste them first? Got salads, nothing special (except for the price when the bill came, $5.95 for a side salad?!) Then entrees came.  Mac & Cheese was average looking and tasted ok,  could have really used some pepper which was no where to be found. Sons Lasagna was a pile of noodle, sauce and cheese and didn't taste right. \\nNow about the cleanliness...AWFUL. My silverware that was rolled had food on both pieces, flies everywhere, dirty dishes left out and cobwebs in the corners on the floor.  We didn't visit the restrooms so can't say to their conditions. \\nMy opinion, this place needs a makeover and a lesson on cleanliness.

I think this place has the potential to be a 4 star with just a little fine-tuning.  Quick summary: All of our food was excellent, the ambience and decor is quite nice, but some other details need attention. I will most definitely return for another meal.  Here are the details:\\n\\nWe were seated at a 2-person table in the lower \\"dining\\" level not far from the kitchen. It was actually a very nice spot EXCEPT that the table right next to us, on the higher level in the \\"bar\\" area, was much too close; it didn't help that there were 3 loud men at the table. Sometimes, it was hard for us to converse. The owners should consider a better divider between those tables. Right now, it is open shelving. It is an easy fix.\\n\\nWe sat longer than we should have before being greeted by wait staff (oops). The hostess should be trained to notify servers when guests are seated. When the waitress came, she was pleasant and got us our drinks rather quickly.\\n\\nWe started with the shrimp cocktail (6 shrimp for $15). It came quickly. The shrimp was hearty and fresh and very tasty. My only small complaint: I like lemon on my shrimp cocktail and none was included (oops). The cocktail sauce was fine (I do like a little side of horseradish to spice it up but there was none).\\n\\nFor dinner, I had the mixed green salad, parmesan peppercorn dressing, and I added salmon ($20). Oh my goodness, it was delicious! The salad was fresh (though nothing unique) but the salmon was tasty and cooked to perfection. Truly. I loved every bite. Again, I got no lemon (oops). I like lemon on my seafood.  The dressing came on the side as I requested.\\n\\nMy boyfriend got the Baked Cod, rice and asked for asparagus in place of the green beans ($19). The waitress returned to tell us they were out of asparagus so he was offered other options and selected the side salad. He asked for parmesan peppercorn dressing but his salad was served with a balsamic dressing (oops). Lemon was served with his fish. He said it was spectacular. I tried the dressing and did not like it but he enjoyed it very much. I wanted to try his fish but he devoured it quickly. You snooze, you lose.\\n\\nFor dessert, we shared the brownie sundae ($7) and it was quite good. It was served warm with vanilla ice cream, whipped cream and chocolate sauce. I would have had a cappuccino but they do not carry it.\\n\\nWe were drinking soda water, cranberry and lime (no alcohol). I ordered a second drink. The waitress took my glass to refill it and came back with something that did not look like what I had been drinking. I took a sip and it was ginger ale (oops). I brought it to her attention and she came back to tell me that something happened to the cranberry juice but someone went \\"down\\" to fix it. She later came back with my refill.  More than I needed to know.\\n\\nFinally, we got our bill ($71.69). We gave $90 in cash and the waitress came back to tell us we did not give enough. She quickly realized she made a mistake (oops) and hurried away. Our waitress returned with our change ... except it was only bills, no actual coins. I was thinking \\"Oh, maybe the restaurant rounded down in my favor.\\" Nope. The restaurant (or waitress) rounded up, in their favor, and only brought back $18. So, they kept my 31 cents in change (oops). I am not going to quibble over 30 cents but it was wrong. I still left a very good tip ($15) because the waitress was pleasant, efficient, and attentive. And I used to be in the business so I like to tip well if deserved.\\n\\nI am just giving the facts here. Perhaps management will read this review, initiate a few  changes, and this restaurant will improve and thrive. I live right down the street and I want it to do well and continue to serve great food. I want more salad with salmon. It just needs a little fine tuning. After all, it is new to the neighborhood.

I had never really noticed how stellar the service is due to the fact that we always hang at the bar.\\n\\nHaving been customers for years now, there isn't much on the menu I haven't scarfed down.  They always have seasonal specials, last night it was the lightly battered Drum with Crab.  I cannot remember ever not having an excellent meal here.  HH is the bomb.  All of their appetizers are at half price till 7pm.  And not just queso folks, many great selections to wet your appetite.\\n\\nJack, I'll take your menu over your son's any day.  :)"},{"name":"Mister Tramps","address":"8565 Research Blvd","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"You get a free pie of pizza when you order a pitcher of beer after midnight.

The place has a fun modern diner feel, everything from fun lights to booth seating. The food is like a diner on steroids. I got  the deluxe burger (but with chicken). It had a unique twist on a normal burger, with some fried onions and unique cheeses. I don't know what the normal beef patty is like but the chicken patty was amazing! It was a thick slice of chicken I would say 1 inch easily, that was super moist. The fries that came with it were packaged in a paper lunch bag which I found different and kind of fun. They had some interesting spices and salt on them that made me keep wanting to eat more even when my tummy was full. \\n\\nTo drink I had one of their unique flavors which are made there. It was ginger mint. It was different but I enjoyed it. Among my party I think we tried just about every flavor and everyone was pleased. If I remember them all correctly there where: Ginger mint, Citrus Lemongrass, Kola, A floral one I can't remember the name, and one that was a unique root beer like flavor. \\n\\nTo top off the meal we tried the Almond Joy Cake. I'm not one to usually get a dessert but they were all so tempting. This cake was amazing everything from the chunks of peanuts on the top to the delicious coconut filling. It was moist and rich (but not too rich). \\n\\nOur service was awesome, even giving us a free dessert when they didn't have one that we wanted.

I'll start with the whole experience from last weekend, the first thing that happened was that my girlfriends and I parked across the street and weren't quite sure if we had to pay the meter or not since it was Sunday. All of a sudden, I see the owner of Ball Square Cafe & Breakfast, his name is Mike, warning us from across the street to tell us that we don't have to waste our money on the parking meter. So we thanked him, crossed the street and waited in line where Mike was chatting it up with everyone and really making it a fun experience to wait in line for their food (which only took a few minutes anyway since it was around 9). \\n \\nOnce a table was ready for us, Mike brought us in and sat us down, asked us if we had been there before (I was the only one who had experienced the magic of their kitchen) and then told us that we can help ourselves to coffee, juice, and water in the corner of the restaurant. He then with a big smile told us to enjoy our breakfast and gave us all fist pounds. We all sat there talking about what a nice guy he was and how excited we were to order from their expansive menu. The waitress we had, which the whole waitstaff is so friendly as well, totally accommodated us with the specialty coffees we wanted and had to come back a few times since we just couldn't choose what to eat (which, not to knock SoundBites or anything, but their waitstaff tends to rush you out the door and take your food from you when you're still picking towards the end of the meal). The three of us decided all to get something different, one got an omelet and substituted the home fries for fresh fruit, one got the mixed berry Belgian waffle, and I got the caramelized banana and strawberry french toast (which on the menu says is a secret recipe). Not only were all of our plates amazingly delicious, but they came out of the kitchen in a matter of minutes. The omelet was packed with goodness and cooked perfectly and the fruit that was substituted for the home fries was fresh, fresh fruit, crisp and full of flavor. The waffle was topped with the same great fruit and had the nice crunch a waffle should have, with the softness and warmness inside as well. Lastly, the caramelized banana and strawberry french toast...I have been to Ball Square Cafe & Breakfast quite a few times and it took me a few times in going there to finally order this dish. The first time I ever tasted it, it was literally love at first bite. Words can't even begin to describe how good this dish is. It's a big helping as well, and I have never taken home my leftovers from brunch before, but if you can't finish this meal, it's so delicious you just have to take it home with you anyway because you don't want it to go to waste. \\n \\nAll in all, Ball Square Cafe & Breakfast is my favorite brunch experience that I've ever had. I promise you won't be disappointed (especially if you order any of the waffles, french toast, or pancakes with their special recipes)."},{"name":"Catedral Tapatia","address":"707 SE 164th Ave","city":"Vancouver","stars":"3","text":"Service ws spot on!

Happily, it most definitely won't be our last. Wasn't exactly sure what to expect, but the food, ambience, and service exceeded our expectations. This is the first meal out we've had in a long time where we seriously just sat and marveled at the food.\\n\\nOur waiter/bartender was incredibly friendly and attentive. I wish I liked cocktails because I've heard they're amazing here, but I just stuck with red wine. Glancing at the beverage list, it seemed pretty impressive and reasonably priced. \\n\\nAs an appetizer, my husband and I split an order of the pork belly with braised greens, smoked sweet potato, and 6 minute egg. It was served in a little cast iron skillet, which isn't only rustic, it helps keep the food warm. The greens were dressed in a cider vinaigrette which complemented the unctuous-ness of the pork belly. Loved the subtle smokiness of the sweet potato. Together with a bit of egg, this was a perfect bite.\\n\\nWe each ordered a Brussels salad, not realizing that one order would be enough for two to share. Our waiter even asked us if we each wanted one, so I'm guessing a lot of folks split just one. But, I am glad we ordered two because I can't wait to savor it all over again. From the first buttery bite, we were both on culinary Cloud 9. I don't remember ever feeling this excited over a salad of any kind. First off, it is beautiful to behold. The colors in this generously sized dish are gemlike. Every flavor shined through individually and then in layers: the nuttiness of the Brussels sprouts juxtaposed with the crisp butteriness of the pepitas, the delicate sweetness of the winter squash enhanced by paper thin slices of fresh apple, all tempered by a pop of pickled daikon. \\n\\nBecause it's cold and we were wanting for some comfort food, we each ordered the Cast Iron Pie. Have I mentioned how clever it is to serve dishes that are best enjoyed piping hot in a cast iron skillet? This was also crazy good, reminiscent of shepherd's pie. The smashed potato topping was seasoned perfectly, the beef rich and tender, and the veggies retained a bit of their crispness, which added nice textural contrast. The portion was generous, IMO. My husband devoured his completely, while I enjoyed half of mine and was too full for dessert. \\n\\nWe are planning to come back to see what brunch is all about!"},{"name":"North Market","address":"59 Spruce St","city":"Columbus","stars":"4.5","text":"Its always a good time when you come to North Market.

Where this establishment is lacking is service, let me explain.\\n\\nEating here on 4 different occasions and on 2 of those my order was incorrect.  Of those 2 occasions, only 1 did I feel like they made the slightest effort to make it right.\\n\\nThe first time it was a party of 2 and our meals came out at totally different times.  Mine was first and my little girls was nowhere to be seen.  I held off on eating mine thinking hers would be right after but no, it was a good 10 minutes more.  By the time hers came out, mine was getting cold.  I ate it anyway and the waitress did ask how the meal was at one point, I told her and she did apologize for the meals being brought out so far apart and offered a desert which I declined as we had desert plans already and informed her of this.  Nothing else was discussed.\\n\\nThe second time was pretty recent and it was a party of 4 this time.  I ordered my meal onion and dairy free (yeah that sucks but if I eat dairy I'm hating life) yet my burger did not come to me that way.\\n\\nAll food came out at the same time however I noticed big fat onions on my burger and a dairy spread - off to be remade it goes while my party is eating.\\n\\nIt is brought back out to me by one of the cooks who apologized but well after my party has finished eating - after a good chunk of time rolls by.  I awkwardly eat it while they wait.\\n\\nWe get the check and no real effort to make the experience right.  Typically most places will offer something for the kids or offer to comp the individual meal item in partial or full - or at least make a greater effort to make the customer have a better experience.  The place wasn't that busy, in fact half the staff had time to sit around and BS while they eat fries so you know they had time.\\n\\nThe restaurant market in Portland is ULTRA competitive so for me as a customer I want to go where it feels like they genuinely want my business.\\n\\nI wasn't looking for much, just make an effort to sincerely show me you care about my dining experience and customer satisfaction,\\n\\nSadly, I did not get that feeling on most of my visits to this brewpub.\\n\\n-------------------------\\n\\nUpdate.  Another visit to the site after a heartfelt sincere email from the manager and wow - what a difference.  It was a very busy Saturday night and we had a wait of about 30 minutes - not a big deal.\\n\\nWe sat, the waiter was super attentive and fun.

Talk about skimp.\\n\\nI expected to be greeted in a warm manner, but the workers were cold and rude. I also witnessed them arguing with another customer in an obnoxious way, which made them look even worse.\\n\\nMy burrito was mushy and bland, and a bit overpriced.

I thought the items could have been a little spicier, but overall were well-balanced and fresh.  The prices were accessible and portions sensible.  My hope is that more locations open around town, ideally outside of a mall's food court. \\n\\nI will certainly visit iSpice again, as a great alternative to a full-service Indian restaurant when the Indian food craving hits.

Along with the tteokbokki, I usually order the mandu as well and dip them in the spicy sauce :) I think once I ordered from here 3 days in the week...oops! The spicy chicken bibimbap is also to die for! This may sound silly to some, but all my asians will understand: their rice is ON POINT! Not too dry and not too sticky. Just tender and sticky enough to make it the perfect side dish. I also haven't been able to try the kimchi because I am fearful of my allergy being triggered...but I'm sure it's delicious.

Once she got started, the utensils she used came from a box with a lot of other mixed utensils, which led me to believe they weren't sanitized properly. The bottle with the callus removal gel was clogged and had spills on the side, and just generally looked dirty (she even had to get gunk out from it so the gel would come out!). I also noticed that the air vents were full of dirt, this didn't impact my actual service but it led me to believe that the place was generally unclean. I wish I had followed my instinct and just left. The woman who did my nails was insulting, commenting on my tattoos and generally being judgmental towards me. Once she finished my nails she led me to a manicure which she did quickly but it turned out well. Unfortunately my nails are now chipped not even 24hrs after the manicure and even my toe polish is chipped (I can usually wear nail polish for at least 4 days, and my toes stay for more than a week). I've never experienced chipping this quickly anywhere else. The reason why I'm writing the review is because this mani-pedi came out to be $60.

If it wasn't Amoroso, I think they came pretty close. The bun was firm enough to hold all the meat, cheese, onions, and peppers, but showcased its soft side when picking the sandwich up and taking those magical bites.\\n\\nI could have still used some hot sauce on this cheesesteak.

This is probably why no matter what type of Asian restaurant I've been to, and no matter what dish I order, it's always tasted \\"about the same\\" as somewhere else, give or take the portion size and level of spiciness. Hawkers in Orlando is located in the Mills/50 district and has found a good location for the local artists/hipsters that mostly frequent that area. I've visited this location on more than one occasion and each time have sat at the bar, watching the locals come in to eat or pick up their phoned in order. The staff is pleasant and the menu is full of different choices, but the portion sizes leave a lot to be desired for the money you're spending. I ordered the Pad Thai on one occasion, and the Lo Mein with a side of french fries on another. Both main dishes were served in the same size bowls and tasted like pretty much any other similar dish ordered anywhere else. Although the Pad Thai had a little more sauce than I am used to that dish having. I also never once thought to myself, \\"this tastes unique and amazing I wish I had more\\", it was more \\"there isn't enough food and I'm still hungry I guess I'll have to order more.\\" The 2-for-1 happy hour beer specials help ease the pain of realizing you just spent $21 for a mostly noodle-filled main dish, a small side, what would have been one beer, and a tip. In a world full of $4 double cheeseburger and fries and 2 for $20 dinner specials that include a lot more food, Hawkers needs to stop relying on its location, which is the only thing that saved this review from being worse, and start realizing that if real hawkers charged this much for so little, they'd soon have enough money to open a Hawkers wherever they are."},{"name":"North Market","address":"59 Spruce St","city":"Columbus","stars":"4.5","text":"Who doesn't love North Market? \\n\\nA must-see destination in Columbus.

Then, the oldest looking one seemed annoyed that I even approached her.  She said she'd go get my order, but then proceeded to occupy herself with several other things.  She completely forgot about me.  I know she did because luckily for me one of their terrific servers asked me if she could help me.  Only after this did this hostess return to me.

We decided to go with the Omakase based on a previous rave review.  Our order consisted of one $75 omakase and one $120 omakase (primarily difference between the two sets is that the $120 one has more premium fish). Everything about our meal was just perfect. PERFECT!\\n\\nHere are the course we had: yellowtail slices with jalapeno, red snapper in yuzu sauce (starter), miso soup, rock shrimp tempura, assortment of sashimi, misoyaki cod and chilean seabass with a yuzu sauce (hot plates), assortment of nigiri sushi, and a cream custard with black seasame sauce (dessert). \\n\\nI am sometimes hesitant to go with omakase because the chef's selection may not always be what I like to eat. In this case, we informed our waiter that we do not like mackeral and asked that not be included in our sashimi/sushi selection. They happily accomodated our request, and we enjoyed every part of the meal.  There was not one bite that wasn't excellent. \\n\\nFor me, the highlight of the nigiri sushi set was the wagyu nigiri. Slightly seared, seasoned with sea salt, and melted in my mouth. I thought it tasted even better than fish (incl. toro).  This came with the $120 omakase est. \\n\\nThe chilean seabass and black cod were equally wonderful. The fish was seasoned and cooked perfectly with every bite melting in your mouth.  They were probably the best cooked fish plates that I've had in a long time. Michelin star worthy good.    \\n\\nThen came the dessert. Some of my favorite desserts are tiramisu, flan, and creme brulee - so this creme custard just hits the spot for me.  It's somewhere between the consistency of a creme brulee and a custard (zabayonne?) paired perfectly with some sweet black seasame sauce, although I have no idea what the actual dessert name is.  Upon my first bite, I offered to help my husband with his dessert portion if he couldn't finish it (terrible wife, I know).  \\n\\nFor the amount of food given, the size of the sashimi and nigiri plates, and the food quality, I actually thought $75 - $120 is pretty good value -- at least comparing to some fine sushi restaurants in the DC area.  The price though def makes it more of a special occasion restaurant.  If ordering a la carte, I'd imagine a meal to cost about $80 -$100 pp.  (You may be able to get away with $50 pp if you have a small appetite and don't order drinks) The service is very good as well. \\n\\nThe sushi rolls at the table next to us look fairly ordinary but I think they will appeal to those who are not fans of nigiri / sashimi."},{"name":"Oudom Thai & Sushi","address":"100 S Eola Dr, Ste 105","city":"Orlando","stars":"4.5","text":"I've been here four times for lunch.

Large interior with lots of tables, some more comfortable couch and easy chair seating, and a roomy patio.  Despite the fact that the space is relatively spacious, it was still hard to get a table on Good Friday (because what better way to celebrate Good Friday than with a drink?).\\n\\nThe decor is a little all over the place.  Dark wood and a huge assortment of decorative china plates on the walls provide a sort of English pub feel, but the frisbees covering the ceiling and the flat screen TV's tuned to sports channels kind of throw off the pub vibe.  Then there are the Mexican star lights, which give off a lovely glow, but don't really fit in with anything else.  Of course, with all the gorgeous waitresses in itty bitty plaid skirts and knee high dark socks running around, who's looking at the decor, anyway?\\n\\nHubby and I each ordered a cheeseburger.  They forgot to put the cheese on hubby's burger and it took a good 20 minutes for him to get it back after the waitress apologized and brought it back to the kitchen.  Otherwise, the service was outstanding (and I don't think the cheese incident was our waitress' fault - more a kitchen issue).  Our waitress brought me a couple of different beers to sample (I don't normally drink beer, so I was trying to find something that wouldn't be too beer-like, and was overwhelmed with the 200+ beers on their menu).  At her suggestion, I ended up with a Pyramid apricot ale, which I really liked.  The burger was all right.  A perfectly passable burger, but it was sort of small and the patty just felt sort of chintzy.  Nothing I'd go out of my way to eat again, and the fries fell into that same category.\\n\\nBetween the new Galaxy Cafe that's opening next door and the Flying Saucer, there's a definite outer space theme working in this corner of the Triangle development (come to think of it, the interior of the Flipnotics here also has an outer space theme...what's up with that?).  If the Galaxy at this location is half as good as the one on West Lynn, I'd rather eat there than at the Flying Saucer, any day.  But if you're looking for a beer selection of galactic proportions, the Flying Saucer may just be your corner of the universe."},{"name":"Eagles Pizza","address":"2 N High St","city":"New Albany","stars":"4","text":"I haven't had better pizza in Columbus.

The ma√Ætre d' kindly escorted us to our table as the establishment was quickly starting to fill up with hungry patrons.  Looking over the classically French menu, we decided to order Goug√®res - savory little puffs of choux pastry flavored with Gruy√®re cheese.  Though there is about a 15-20 minute wait for these heavenly bites, I highly encourage it.  \\n\\nFor entrees, I regrettably played it safe - I was in the mood for a steak, and a steak is exactly what I got (Entrec√¥te Frites).  The steak was cooked properly (medium-rare as I had ordered it) and the B√©arnaise sauce was enjoyable with it.  However, the fries were rather ordinary.  After tasting the Beef Bourguignon that my wife ordered, I wished that I had been a bit more adventurous.  Oh, how I wish I had ordered that delicious beef, braised in Burgundy red wine!  So tender, rich, and flavorful.  \\n\\nIt seemed only appropriate for me to enjoy a glass of Bordeaux with my steak, and my wife to enjoy a glass of Burgundy with her Beef Bourguignon, so we did.  Bistro Niko's wine list provided for many options, at varying price points, regions, and varietals.  \\n\\nWe weren't about to finish this celebratory dinner without dessert.  Looking over the dessert menu, we had difficulty choosing - everything sounded amazing.  Ultimately, we honed in on the Cafe Caramel Sundae, with the help of our waitress.  This sundae, which boasted a scoop of coffee ice cream, a scoop of vanilla ice cream, sabl√© cookies, salted caramel, and topped with candied pecans and Chantilly cream was blissfully balanced and textured... in other words, a perfect sundae.   \\n\\nTo our pleasant surprise, our dessert was comped by the ma√Ætre d' along with two complimentary glasses of Champagne that the waitress brought out to us in honor of the occasion.

The servers are attentive and will try their best to recommend you drinks to your liking. I ordered the ramos gin fizz, which is one of their more expensive cocktails. To make the drink, the bartender has to shake it for about seven minutes in order to give the drink the proper froth. The party that I was with ended up ordering three more, which meant that the bartender would have to spend an additional twenty-one more minutes to make the drinks. About fifteen minutes after we ordered the additional ramos gin fizz, the server came over and offered some complimentary sparkling wine to hold us over while we wait for the ramos gin fizz. This generous and kind offer was definitely not needed since we knew that the ramos takes awhile to make but it was great that the waitress offered it to us. \\n\\nThe atmosphere seems to depend on the people that visit it. It can be an upscale place but it can also be a chilled lounge. The first time I came here, it was on Thursday and in early February. The waitresses were dressed pretty well and the customers seemed to be in their 30s or 40s. Most of the customers were dressed in business casual or dressy attire.

This place is now my third trap house.\\n\\nFOOD\\n\\nI have searched quite extensively around Atlanta for fish tacos, and Sausalitos is on another level in the fish taco game. Why? Well, for starters, you get a choice of what fish you want in your taco!!! Some options I have seen include Grouper, Sea Bass, Mahi Mahi, Salmon and Tuna. Not all choices are available at the same time, but always at least one white fish and one of the more flavor-rich fish.\\n\\nPick your fish, and the fish is then GRILLED right in front of you! Topped with a some fresh slaw, not soaked in any sugar sauce or mayo based anything. Just some crispy fresh goodness. chipotle sauce to top it off. Delish.\\n\\nThe tacos are 4-8 bites size, depending on how eager you are trying to get the goods in your system. The taco plate comes with rice and beans, and a itty bitty side of salad. The rice is interesting...white rice with hints of peas and corn. Not as mushy as sushi rice, but not the rice grains aren't as separate as basmati rice. \\n\\ntwo tacos run you about $6.00-$8.00. depending on if you get the 'fish of the day'. the plate around $10-$12 bucks. I don't find the plate to be worthwhile, but then again I'm not a big fan of eating beans and rice just like that.\\n\\nAnother element of awesomeness - MANGO SALSA! I put that shit on everything.\\n\\nIf you come during lunch (12-1), it's pretty packed, and the food can get a little greasy, but if you're there when it's not slammed, you can request very light oil and they will accommodate. \\n\\nSERVICE\\n\\nThis is the reason why I can't give it 5 stars. Now, the owner is cool - has the personality of you're favorite uncle, and the staff is friendly. The thing that bothers me is that there are no prices on the daily special white board! With a list of around 6-8 different items (like shrimp and lobster quesadilla or bbq pork tacos), prices up front would help me make a decision quicker without asking the prices of each item, which can't really be done during lunch. \\n\\nAlso, the prices for the taco plates on written on a post it note on the register, not on the menu where you order. As if to say, \\"order what you like, and then I'll take what I think you will pay me\\".

This year we decided to finally join the rest of the nation and get with the program. This was all prompted by the \\"free bottle of wine\\" coupon that we were given when we checked out from the Fairmont Waterfront the day before. With purchase of the Thanksgiving buffet, we'd get a free bottle of red or white Inniskillin wine. That seemed to be the little push that we needed because we went home and made reservations for the next day. \\n\\nThe buffet included pate, salad, seafood, cheese, and dessert stations. We also had the choice of three main courses. My wife had the traditional turkey dinner. She loved everything except for the stuffing, which she said was too dry. I had the maple salmon and it was probably some of the best salmon I'd ever had. The other choice on the menu was prime rib. I was really impressed with how generous the portions were and it definitely did not feel like \\"buffet food\\". Even the buffet portion was top quality all the way through. The only sad part was that I was too full to be able to sample all of the desserts. There were many to choose from and everything I had was delicious.\\n\\nNow this Thanksgiving meal was not cheap ($68 per person), but for the quality of the food and service, it was totally worth it.

There were 20 people waiting to sing, and we were sitting there listening to Sir Mix-a-Lot for 5 minutes between every singer? Makes NO sense. You would think he would want to get more singers up there. More singers = more tips. Sometimes he wouldn't play any music or call a singer up, he'd just be fiddling with his phone, texting or on Facebook. Do that stuff while someone is singing! We overheard him snarking about a patron to his buddy, saying \\"Ask me how long it'll be before you sing, and we'll see if you ever get up there\\". The final straw was when he chose to grace us with his own horrible rendition of a 3 Doors Down song when we'd all been waiting 10 minutes for him to call up the next singer. We got up and left, and we'll never be back.\\n\\nIf the manager of Catedral Tapatia is reading this, PLEASE FIND A NEW KJ.

More like, \\"Cakes and Fail.\\"\\n\\nThe bf and  I chose this establishment for our anniversary dinner in late Oct, as we wanted to try something new to us and have heard mostly great things. I was excited, and  I really wanted to like this place, but left feeling extremely disappointed.\\n\\nWe arrived on time for our 9:15 reservation, and there was no table available yet, and no seats at the bar.  So we headed to the bakery next door to peruse what they had to offer.  I wouldn't dare spoil my appetite, so after a couple minutes of browsing, we just headed up to the middle of the square to chill out...but it got too chilly.  We headed back to C&A at about 9:30 and inquired about our table, and after the hostesses consulted each other they set us up with a table near the front of the restaurant.\\n\\nWe sat for awhile before being offered any water.  Fine, I can overlook it.  Water service (still or sparkling) comes with a $1 per person charge, with free refills (gee, thanks).  Now, we're not cheapskates by any means, and $2 is not a big deal at all, but it just seemed odd to pay for H20 from the good ol' Chattahoochie.  Anyways, the waiter finally comes and we order a bottle of Rose (which is a different choice for us), and the charcuterie as a starter.  Our waiter was odd from the getgo, but I was gonna give him a chance.  He was this older dude and I don't even think he introduced himself to us initially. Charcuterie comes out, it's very average.  Better charcuterie is to be had at Iberian Pig and 4th and Swift.\\n\\nThe waiter finally returns a long time later for the entree orders. We decided to try the Trout for 2, and also the Faro and Braised Kale.  So bf does the ordering, and our waiter says, \\"Sorry, we are out of the faro AND the Kale.\\"  Major bummer. Bf takes a bit of a stand at this point and says that he is really disappointed because those were 2 sides we were really looking forward to.  So our waiter is a little flustered that we DARE express our disappointment, and stammers \\"well, let me go check in the kitchen, maybe they are making up a new batch.\\"  WHAT? First of all, shouldn't you tell us before we order, that we have a limited selection of what is available? Secondly, shouldn't you KNOW that you are for sure out of the items you say you are?  Waiter scuttles off into the kitchen and returns to tell us the \\"good news\\" that they actually still do have both items.  Yay, we get them! But UGH it was annoying!\\n\\nLong story short(ish):  Trout comes, we ask to have it filleted at the table (which they offer) and the guy (not our waiter, but some other waiter) does a horrible butchering job with the delicate fish, takes about 10 minutes to do so, and half the arugula accompanying the fish ended up on the table.  That was a seriously awkward 10 minutes. The flavor of the fish was good, but nothing spectacular or memorable.  The faro was great, and the kale was average.  Quantity of everything was ok but on the smaller side.\\n\\nThe whole process took so long and we were annoyed by the service and lack of \\"wow\\" in the taste, so dessert was out of the question.  They brought us 2 complimentary pineapple macaroons for our anniversary and honestly I think they were the best part of the meal.\\n\\nWe may give C&A another shot to redeem themselves one day, but I won't be returning until I have visited the rest of the \\"must try\\" places on our list.  Until then, all I have is the memory of a crappy experience at a supposedly great restaurant which made for a sub par anniversary celebration.

I may have to update my review once I've tried their pad thai but they pulled off a perfectly fine pad see ew. The dish was just a tad sweet. I would have been happy if it were even a little sweeter, but it was still flavorful regardless. The noodles didn't stick together like they sometimes do and I thought the portion was perfect; I could finish it and feel satisfied but also not feel totally sick and bloated from it.

I have been frequenting this fine dandy establishment since they recently opened up a brick and mortar location.  The service is friendly and prompt with each order.  The ambiance is calm with classic tunes playing in the background.  It has a somewhat old school diner feel to with the stools and the counter layout.  \\n\\nI tried the Italian sub sandwich with hot peppers added.  The bread had a crunchy texture to it.  The peppers were nicely spiced and the toppings plentiful.  My friend asked me how it was; I ate in silence and could only say \\"Don't bother me I'm eating\\".  They certainly live up to the name.  Sure the sandwiches are in the $7-$9 range but the price is well worth it.  I had the sandwich for lunch and for once, it did something many places have failed:  I was full for the rest of the day!  \\n\\nAfter reading reviews of other faithful yeeps, the St. Bomber called my name.  Another friend wanted to go so we met up and ordered the same steak sandwich.  I took a picture for bragging purposes and many people who saw it were overwhelmed.   The picture up close made the sandwich \\"super sized\\"  so I had to explain the size difference.  I noticed the bread this time was soft and moist.  Again I ate in silence and marveled how well the beef was seasoned and the cheese perfectly layered.  The chips are house made and provide a great little snack in between bites.\\n\\nI am a fan and will continue to return.  The staff rocks and always makes me feel welcome.

The best of the night were the baked chicken wings...delicious! A lot come in the app order. A friend ordered the duck panini and i got the corned beef sandwich with fries. Both of our complaints were that the bread was overly buttered. Every bite we could feel it oozing out which made it hard to finish. It was certainly good but i didnt like the greasiness of the sandwich. The regular and sweet potato fries were good and be aware the pickle they give you is very spicy!

What we got was a mixed bag of vittles and an overall strange experience!\\n\\nWe arrived Friday night at 9:30 pm, a half hour before closing. The guy acted surprised that we were there and did not really want to serve us. I told him we could take food to go if that was better for him. So, we go a couple of dinners to eat back at the hotel. I had the BBQ cauliflower with mac and cheese and greens. My partner had the BBQ kalebone with broccoli and greens. Both came with cornbread and a side salad, and we got a piece of chocolate cake to share. We also took home a jug of ginger root drink, made in house-- oh so gingery and good!\\n\\nThe cauliflower was fabulous (the BBQ sauce was amazingly delicious!) and the salad with sprouts and a nutritional yeast dressing was really good.  The kalebone  and mac n cheese were just ok. The greens were way too salty but they have been like this at every soul food restaurant I have tried-- just not the way I make them and not my preference. The cornbread was hard and dry and oily- yuck. The cake was also dry and crumbly, but tasted much better the next day.  \\n\\nWhile waiting for our food, we saw on the menu that they serve brunch on Sat and Sun   at 10 am. So, the next morning, we arrived at 10:15 am, just behind the same guy from the night before. He seemed surprised to see us. I commented that I could not believe they were not packed! Surely, in Columbus, Ohio such a place would be full within minutes so starved are we for vegan breakfast. He looked perplexed and said, \\"We just opened!\\" \\n\\nAfter seating us he informed us they were out of some things but he would see what he could do for us. As we browsed the menu, another couple came in only to abruptly turn and leave only a minute later. \\"The guy\\" then informed us that they actually do not open until 11 am and he did not know that since he usually works Sundays, but since we were out-of-towners, he'd go ahead and get us something. We then noticed that the restaurant door states the Sat and Sun opening hours to be 11 am. The take out menu says they open at 11 on Saturday and 10 on Sunday. So, there are three different schedules and apparently the employees are also unaware of which is correct. \\n\\nAnyway, we got the brunch, which consisted of pancakes, tofu scramble, and sausage. I also got a side salad and my partner got some herb potatoes. The pancakes were SO DELICIOUS!! Potatoes were cold and old and dry, but the tofu and sausage were good. \\n\\nOur server, \\"the guy,\\" was not very personable. Although not unfriendly, really, he was not hospitable. He just ignored us as he sat at another table and messed around on a laptop. I wanted to talk to him a little bit, ask questions. When I did ask him something, he could not answer it. For example, I asked him what the carrot supreme salad was he could not tell me, only that it was made in a way that people thought was really good. Ha!\\n\\nBottom line-- this place was ok and maybe we hit it at a weird time, but this restaurant and the  whole neighborhood felt like some kind of a time warp or mushroom trip or something.

I've had tasted many great plates and enjoyed services by Canoe since then. I've had Canoe in Atlanta and once inToronto. The food I had in Atlanta was better. Canoe's rabbit, duck, and special of the day fish were the ones I remembered. I was disappointed with their scallops dish...the complements (salad, etc.). That might be the worst one, though their scallops were succulent. Almost made me think twice to go back, but salmon for brunch is long due, so I'm back. Additionally, they have good dessert, too... chocolate grotto and popcorn sundae.\\n\\nCanoe offers unique, new taste to my palates. I also think that the price for quality and taste of the food was reasonable. My kind of top notch restaurant. I am also not one that weighs on customer service, but Canoe's service made me see its value, exceeds my expectation. Outstanding!

The first time there was an optimistic, \\"playscape coming soon\\" sign and bins of legos on the stage for the kids. The second time I went back the \\"playscape\\" was built. This playscape is a deathtrap! It's a wooden structure that includes wide stairs, and a structure with a low roof (too low for parents to stand in) and largte openings to a 10 foot drop to the ground. I didn't get to sit down for the whole meal while I tried to prevent my child for falling to his death. They also don't have any happy hour specials. Drinks and food were expensive and service was slow. I will not be coming back."},{"name":"Du Kuh Bee","address":"12590 SW 1st St","city":"Beaverton","stars":"4","text":"So good for late night eats, definatly an after the bar hot spot. We usually pick up to go, hand made noodles a must! One noodle can order can easily feed two, or three, unless you are a huge eater! We usually get spicey veggie and love it. Kids like the fried rice. You should give it a try."},{"name":"Banger's Sausage House & Beer Garden","address":"79 81 & 81.5 Rainey St","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Solid place.  I would put more of an emphasis on the \\"beer garden\\" part, definitely has that vibe.  There are some good reviews already, just wanted to mention a few things you might want to know about this place:\\n\\n1) It's huge, there are tons of seats on picnic benches, inside and outside.  They seat people right next to one another, so it's pretty communal, not a lot of privacy, which is fine, but just know what you're in for.\\n\\n2) There are three types of buns to choose from, pretzel, kolache, and pumpernickel.  We tried the pretzel and kolache.  Both were good, but kolache was perfect with the duck sausage.\\n\\n3) There are 10+ types of toppings as well as 10+ types of sauces to choose from, you get 2 of each.  Sauces are made in house everyday.  The hot sauerkraut is pretty spicy, and the spicy mustard is like a dose of wasabi.  I don't recommend getting both on the same thing as you cannot taste the sausage...and this is coming from someone who loves spicy foods.\\n\\n4) They have several vegetarian sausages, but they were sold out when we got there, which was a bummer because they sounded really tasty and we wanted to get one.  Might want to order one as soon as you get in or check before you go if you must have it.\\n\\n5) Duck, bacon, and fig sausage was hands down the best one we got.  Very juicy and great consistency.  Would not have guessed it would've been that good.  Get some.\\n\\n6) Beer selection is obviously amazing.  Will they get through enough kegs to keep them all fresh?  I hope so.  Lots of obscure options to try.  Will definitely have to go back and try some others.\\n\\n7) It is too loud inside to try and have a conversation at any deeper level than yelling at each other about how good the food and beer is.  If you want to talk, then I suggest sitting outside.\\n\\n8) Service was great, top notch for a place like this."},{"name":"B.J.

I even returned the first one because it tasted like highly concentrated syrup and milk. A second lady actually tried to better the drink by pouring in regular coffee. Of course that did nothing, I even tried to help by telling her to put it in a smaller glass and add less milk. The second drink was no better but I left with a smile on my face; It's not easy to complain about a bad coffee I am far from a coffee snob but I find the need to yelp about it because I feel cheated, I didn't get my moneys worth and am appalled that just anyone can be placed as a barista with no training on the subject and expect tips for a trade they put no effort into. I hope the people working there might read this and care enough to understand what a latte should taste like and why it's a higher priced drink than a glass of milk and free sugar.  I'm sure the food is better and the service is great, the people seemed nice but really, I just threw my drink right in the trash, not worth the waste, please obtain coffee making skills if you're going to charge people for good coffee."},{"name":"Chi'Lantro","address":"11005 Burnet Rd","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Been here 2-3 times now.

You can spend the day shopping and enjoying the Pearl District and then have a great meal.  Deschutes is kind of different from most of the restaurants in the Pearl. It's rustic and woodsy as opposed to sleek and modern.\\n\\nThe food is great...they have everything from burgers, sandwiches, steak, and they also have a gluten free menu (and a gluten free beer)\\n\\nIt seems to be the most popular among the breweries in that area.  Every time I've gone the wait have been at least 20 minutes (for 2).  The staff is wonderful though.

A friend took my wife and I here to entertain us prior to us moving out here to Portland.  I had the sweet potato fries for an appetizer while we waited in the bar area.  I also had the micro sampler which was fun and I loved the beers.  After we were seated we had the Pepperoni pizza for our meal and I thought it was excellent.  I forgot where and how to get there but I found this place again recently and invited another couple to join us.  It was again, really good.  I had the (pep) pizza again.   I think it is one of my favorties.  Also- I like the openness and the tall glass walls that let you look downtown/outside  while you eat (if you sit on the outer loop of tables)."},{"name":"Oga's Japanese Cuisine","address":"915 Worcester St","city":"Natick","stars":"4","text":"I've been here a bazillion times and love this place.

My favorites: salmon sushi, uni sushi, scallop sushi, regular bento box, and nabeyaki udon. Love their creative special appetizers during dinner time, I've tried all sorts of fun dishes like salmon with grapefruit salad. I also enjoy their fried shumai, hamachikama and duck wrap appetizers.

I love it from grocery stores and I love it from great sushi bars. I appreciate the good versions all along the spectrum, just like hamburgers. \\n\\nBut there's something great about a solid sushi restaurant where everything is done right. That's exactly what Oga's was. The atmosphere is simple and elegant and we felt very comfortable. \\n\\nMy girlfriend started out with some salmon spring rolls and she's still bringing them up two weeks later! I had the miso soup - because I'm boring - and it was terrific. \\n\\nOf course the sushi was the main attraction and it didn't disappoint. Our favorite \\"basic\\" sushi is the sweet potato tempura and while it's simple, it's easy to mess up. We've had plenty that have come out as crunchy as an apple and it's an unpleasant experience. These were done perfectly. The tempura was still crisp in the roll and the sweet potato was velvety. Perfect. Could've eaten twice what we ordered. \\n\\nWe also got the spider roll, another mutual favorite, and it was playfully assembled and tasted fantastic. She got the Philadelphia rolls and I got a spicy tuna roll as well and, again, they couldn't have been better. \\n\\nI gave this place 5 stars and only $ since when I got the bill I was impressed at just how much amazing food we had for so little money.

The salmon tartare comes with smoked salmon skin \\"chips\\" that we both found very inventive and quite tasty.\\n\\nThe sake kama (tempura fried salmon 'cheek' [collar] with garlic ponzu sauce and green onions) was pretty damn amazing, though it could have used a bit more ponzu, but was equally delicious with some wasabi soy sauce. Salmon tartare was amazing, fresh, and full of awesome flavors with avocado, onion and cucumber in addition to the fish. Yum. It was topped with salmon roe which my boyfriend said tasted significantly less 'fishy' than most he's had before (which was a positive!).\\n\\nAll in all, a great dining experience.
