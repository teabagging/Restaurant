For the two people that came in and left the establishment for pickup and uber eats orders while I was off to the side completing my sandwich crafting, I am not sure if he wore those same gloves for collecting their payments but I was grossed out (he was the only one collecting payments and filling the orders although there was someone else in the back).

My friend ordered a cappuccino. All of our items were FINE. But only fine. Nothing bad, nothing special. The same \\"fineness\\" goes for the atmosphere. It was cute in an unremarkable sort of way. I could see myself sitting here and getting some work done, and it would be FINE. But it isn't a unique place in the way that so many other Austin spots are unique."},{"name":"Tuscan Kitchen - Seaport","address":"64 Seaport Blvd","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"Please go elsewhere for Italian in Boston.

We had to point these out. Service was terrible. Waiter took our appetizer order and walked away. We had no where to put our menus and he never came back to take entree orders until we were completely done with our appetizers. The waiter also only asked one member of our table about drinks after three visits to the table. I finally asked if others were allowed to order drinks as well. Lol \\n\\nThe food was presented well but borderline tasteless all around. Seriously, the meatball appetizer tasted like meat taken right out of the package and cooked with 0 seasoning. The only flavor was the slight iron taste beef generally has. The sauce had almost no flavor as well. The main entrees bolognese and lobster ravioli were passable, possibly even good at a price around $15.95, for $28 and $34 respectively, no way. \\n\\nManagement could care less about customers.

It's been around since 1929. There are three locations in the Atlanta area: Buckhead, Sandy Springs, and the Upper Westside (new location as of December 5, 2017). This location in Buckhead is the first, though it's moved a block north from its original spot at 61 Irby Avenue. Henri's in Buckhead is now located at Andrews Square, a recently-renovated development, where it opened August 17, 2017.\\n\\nOur wedding planner suggested we meet at Henri's in Buckhead. It turned out to be an excellent choice. My fiancee, parents, and I had breakfast here and it hit the spot. Everything was good. This was my first time at Henri's in Buckhead though I'd already been familiar with the brand as I've tried multiple custom birthday cakes from the Henri's in Sandy Springs. Their custom cake work is excellent.\\n\\nOver a year old now, this location in Buckhead still feels fresh and new. It's sort of like a traditional European bakery and cafe that's been updated and modernized. During our Monday morning visit, the mostly white space was bright and naturally well lit with plenty of windows looking out onto the front patio, the covered walkways of the development, and the beautiful courtyard and fountain within. Andrews Square looks really nice now; it's clean with good landscaping and colorful flowers. The interior of Henri's has a handful of small tables with both banquette and chair seating. There's seating outside too (uncovered).\\n\\nWe picked out items from Henri's impressive-looking display cases. They had a whole smorgasbord of fresh-looking pastries and other goodies. They included various shortbreads, French vanilla muffins, cream-filled donuts, cherry and apple Danishes, cronuts, apple fritters, glazed twists, cinnamon twists, glazed donuts, chocolate donuts, Mexican nut cookies, Belgian slices, Heath Bar cookies, peanut butter cookies, oatmeal raisin cookies, cinnamon rolls, elephant ears, cheese Danishes, croissants, black and white cookies, wedding cookies, Mediterranean cookies, gingerbread men, snickerdoodle cookies, sugar cookies, chocolate chip cookies, fresh fruit tarts, cream puffs, creme horns, chocolate bombs, chocolate truffle cakes, flourless chocolate cakes, Italiano cakes, black Russian cakes, strawberry wedge cakes, creme brulee, lemon squares, key lime tarts, mocha fudge wedges, cannoli, French cheese cakes, oasis cakes, Napolean cakes, baklava, French macarons, caramel brownies, chocolate brownies, and chocolate eclairs. Everything was individually portioned. For example, cakes were sold by the slice. Of course, you can order whole cakes too (whole cake pricing below).\\n\\nHere's what we ended up getting:\\n\\nFood:\\nCroissant (plain) - $2.19\\nApple Danish - $2.29\\nApple fritter - $2.09\\nFresh fruit tart - $3.99\\n\\nCoffee/tea:\\nCafe Americano (double-shot) - $2.95\\nCoffee (decaf, small) - $1.85\\nHot tea (small) - $1.65\\nIced coffee\\n\\nEverything was delicious, even the plain croissant. Everything looked, smelled, and tasted great. The croissant was soft and buttery; terrific flavor and consistency. It wasn't too flaky, which I liked. The apple Danish was probably my favorite of the foods we ordered. It tasted fantastic. The apple fritter was very good too. It was appetizingly crumbly with a delectable sugary glaze. The fresh fruit tart was a little too sweet for my tastes. The fruit tart consisted of blueberries and sliced strawberries, both of which were ripe. I did like the creamy, custardy base and the hard, scrumptious crust. As for drinks, I ordered the iced coffee and had it prepared with vanilla syrup and half and half. It was wonderful; very refreshing and a great start to my day. My fiancee and parents enjoyed the food and drink too.\\n\\nService was stellar. For a Monday morning, all of the staff we encountered had a good attitude and seemed eager to serve. They were polite and some greeted us with a friendly smile. I think that can really make a difference between a positive or negative experience sometimes.\\n\\nHenri's also has a deli where they make sandwiches. They offer several breakfast sandwiches ($1.99-3.89 each) and lunch sandwiches (starting at $3.29-7.79 each).\\n\\nRegular cakes cost anywhere from $34.99 to $129.99 each and birthday cakes range from $29.99 to $84.99 each.\\n\\nThere was plenty of free parking at Andrews Square. It's free 6am-6pm, Monday-Friday. Otherwise, you have to pay at the machine or use the ParkMobile app. The free parking at Andrews Square mostly coincides with Henri's hours which are (at the time of writing this review) 7am-6pm, Monday-Saturday. I guess you have to pay for parking if you want to visit here on a Saturday."},{"name":"Random Order Pie Bar","address":"1800 NE Alberta St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"I ended up here yesterday by chance for a pre-flight slice of pie with my partner.

Actually the worst meal I have ever had in a restaurant.  We went at the start of the \\"Magical Dining\\" event, where restaurants in Orlando choose to participate and offer 3 course meals for $35.  I was insulted with what I was served last night at the Ravenous Pig.  The steak tartare was beautiful but incredibly spicy, my mouth was on fire.  My husband didn't like it but was ok with it, but the waitress offered to bring me something else so I chose the chicken liver crostini.  It was the worst thing I've ever seen or eaten.  Black burnt bread with charred pate on top.  I'm truly shocked that they actually serve that.  I didn't say anything because I was becoming upset and didn't want to send back TWO appetizers.  We both ordered the short rib which was not appetizing or what we expected.  The meat was shredded off and mixed in with noodles. It was just horrible.  Looked like crap, tasted like nothing.  At this point, my husband was pissed, I was seriously annoyed.  The waitress could tell and again offered to bring us something else.  My husband told her that they should change their magical dining menu, and she told him that is \\"not productive\\", as if we are children and should just eat what we are served.  Arrogance.  We should have walked out.  But we didn't want to leave hungry so we decided to share the steak frites, how can you go wrong with steak and fries right?  The steak was ok, although it's small and we don't think it was a NY strip, pretty sure it was a sirloin and the fries had NO truffle flavor at all.  We just wanted to get out of there.  However we still had dessert coming.  The panna cotta was good however it was not served with fruit as described. It was served with a big ball of chocolate which was good, but not what I was expecting. My husband had the artisanal cheese which was two small slices of cheddar, I think, with an unidentified slime on it. Again, he was pissed.  So here comes the bill.  When we were charged an additional $15 for the steak frites we had to bring the manager over who is clearly inexperienced in customer service (probably because she is about 12 years old).  To think that we would pay for the crap that was sent back and SHARE one entree and be charged an additional $15 is insane.  This restaurant thinks they can serve crap on a plate, charge any amount of money and people will happily eat it.  The manager would not take the $15 off so we paid $135 for the worst meal of our lives.  Very memorable in the worst way possible.

The chefs here cook up great tasting Oaxacan style food. I wouldn't have known about this spot if it wasn't for a bartender at a different restaurant. Upon entering, you'll see a very dimly lit restaurant but it's bustling with chatter. It really is a great spot to just hang out and talk over Mexican food. \\n\\nOn my last night in Austin, I decided to come here and give it a shot. Since I visited alone, I was able to find seating by the chef's counter very easily. What over noticed during my 5 day stay here, alot of restaurants in Austin have an open kitchen and I love shutting close to the kitchen. It gives you, the customer a real experience you're the kitchen weeks in synergy and how your dish is prepared and inspected before landing in front of you. \\n\\nSince I wasn't too hungry, I only tried two of their dishes: quesadilla tetemada and suadero tacos. Both were spectacular with Mexica herbs, spices and flavor. What I did notice was that the dishes were a bit on the salty side but I wasn't sure if it's just me or a Texas thing. All the food I've had during my stay was always on the saltier side. To pair the dishes, I ordered their horchata, which is also mixed sweet potato. It gives it more of a creamier taste and the color of the horchata looks more like milk tea. If you're ever in town, definitely visit Suerte and try out the rest of their menu. I wish I could've but those two dishes filled me up."},{"name":"The Busy Bee Cafe","address":"810 Martin Luther King Jr Dr SW","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Food is good.

Service was outstanding and everything was really good. Perhaps my lack of enthusiasm to return is a result of being out of my usual element and making a unmemorable dinner choice. We selected a bottle of wine, pinot noir, at the recommendation of our server, and though I know twist caps are supposedly as good as corked wines, somehow showing the bottle then twisting off the cap makes the choice feel \\"cheap\\". The wine was good nonetheless, and we expected higher prices ($60 - $80 per person for just the food portion), but for those prices I would like liked more of a Wow factor. I decided to go with a steak since Fleming's is a \\"prime steakhouse\\", and went with a petite fliet. I may have enjoyed it more with some added companions or rubs, but for $45 for just the one 8 oz steak I expected it to be well flavored as-is. Unfortunately it lacked seasoning and taste and though it was a nice cut, cooked perfectly medium, and definitely large enough, I found the dinner disappointing. I realized I made a poor choice because we cook fillets at home frequently and know how to make them seasoned to our taste. Flemings is part of the same corporation that includes Outback, Bonefish, and Carrabbas. I have had better tasting steaks at all of those other restaurants than the one I had at the higher end Flemings. One of our guests ordered the regular filet, with the porcine mushroom and Gorgonzola cream rub and said that was the best extra $4.95 spent, definitely worth it and made his filet amazing. Another guest ordered the Prime New York steak with a Kona coffee rub and I thought this was the best steak on the table. The real entree winning choice was ordered by the ladies at our table, the miso glazed chilean sea bass. I didn't want to be inappropriate in a classy restaurant, but I did consider asking if I could use some of their extra sauce to coat my otherwise bland steak. The fish was delicate and delicious, so if I do ever return to Flemings, I will select one of the seafood options instead of a steak. The sides, which are all shareable, were delicious. We had the truffle mashed potatoes, the chipotle cheddar mac n cheese, and the crispy brussel sprouts. I would recommend any and all of these sides since these were packed with indulgent flavor. We finished off with a molten lava cake for the birthday boy, and some Chantilly cream, both of which did have that wow factor. \\n\\nThe restaurant itself was a little noisy and crowded but granted we dined on a Friday night. We usually skip valet but the parking lot was otherwise so small we had to park in the neighboring Wawa in order to get to the restaurant.

The meat was well seasoned and tender, with fresh tomatoes and lettuce and onions on it all wrapped up in a warm fresh pita.

I mean, an Italian restaurant is pretty much defined by its pasta, and Olive & June rolled out some excellent al dente stuff tonight.\\n\\nI went with four friends, all of whom are avid foodies, and we ordered some appetizers, four pasta dishes, and some piccoli piatti. We shared it all family style, which is the way to go at this restaurant because the other Yelpers are right -- the portions run small. \\n\\nI'll start with the good:\\n1. By far, the best thing I had all night was the Farm Egg with polenta and wild mushrooms. This appetizer could be a meal. Pair it with some kale or an endive salad, and it would be a vegetarian treat. \\n2. The pork meatballs. I wish I had this over a plate of their spaghetti. The pomodoro sauce and fig paired very well together, which was a delightful surprise.\\n3. The ravioli had an utterly perfect ricotta filling. I enjoyed the vegetable topping, although I would have preferred a pomodoro sauce.\\n4. The risotto was also solid with a hearty portion of mushrooms, although this would also need to be paired with a vegetable to round out a meal.\\n\\nHere's the not-as-good (mediocre but not terrible. None of the food was terrible.)\\n1. The gnocchi special. I will say, it's hard to get gnocchi right, and I hold it to a high standard -- my grandmother's gnocchi is perfect and nothing will top it. But one of my friends described Olive & June's gnocchi as mashed potatoes rolled into little pieces. The winter veggies accompanying it were ok but not memorable.\\n2. The carbonara. This is another Italian dish that is difficult to execute, but if you're going to operate a swanky, upscale place, then you should get this right. The sauce was missing something; I suspected parsley. It was a little heavy on the salt and perhaps needed more cheese.\\n\\nI would certainly try this place again, but I told a friend as I was leaving that I'd rather eat at Backspace (a sister restaurant that offers brick-oven pizza)."},{"name":"Gabriela's Downtown","address":"900 E 7th St","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Gabrielas.

The customer service was super mediocre. The bartender that serviced the lanes seemed to be either drunk or high, and was slow as ever. It took almost an hour and half for him to bring us our first round of drinks. We purposely ordered our second round immediately after her served us our first round to hopefully not have to wait so long. Needless to say we were done with both of our games before he returned with our drinks. After speaking with the manager about this, he made sure to get us additional time added to the game and ordered us some free wings.

It starts with a wilted wakame seaweed, still a little crunchy, with a few raw french green beans, coarsely chopped pistachio, orange slices and the magic ingredient, an off the shelf yuzu kosho dressing. The dressing comes  from an Asian lemon: Citrus ichangensis x Citrus reticulata \\"yuzu\\".

The patty is more of a Cantonese style: the flavor comes from ingredients, not over spicing. The patty does not have added salt, unusual for a sausage.

It is a perfect example of adding the tiniest amount of cayenne to activate flavors without revealing itself.\\n\\nThe rest of the ingredients provide a great contrast. Hoisin sauce, a fresh tomato, a cabbage slaw, house pickles and dry crunchy noodles dusted with cayenne.\\n\\nThis is a serious fusion burger with quality ingredients, inventively combined!

The laid back atmosphere and gorgeous patio; the attentive yet casual approach to service; and the made-to-order, fresh, and unique food had me always coming back despite the higher-than-average price tag. Late last year, many of my friends moved away from the neighborhood and Tin Shed had fallen from the front of mind. So when my brother and I were looking for a place for breakfast in NE, I exclaimed and sang the praises of Tin Shed. What we found this morning is a sad and lazy excuse for the glory that this place once was. While the atmosphere still maintains its familiar vibes and patio presence, all else has been lost to the complacency of the decision makers and kitchen staff in this joint. \\n\\nWhat was once a made-to-order, caramelized, steaming, and thoughtfully assembled plate of breakfasty perfection is all now premixed and served ala pile of luke-warm, barely cooked, and at best lackadaisically prepared food. The sweet potatoes in the hash had an unpleasant crunch, the mushrooms slimy and steamed, the scrambled eggs looked be scooped out of a large batch of eggs cooked hours earlier and left to a steam table as if they were awaiting their '$7 all-you-can-eat buffet' debut, and the over easy eggs pointed to the help of a microwave given their rubbery texture. Not to mention the menu hasn't changed since I first went here 3.5 years ago. \\n\\nWith water and coffee being self-served from a setup station and the prescribed order taking and check delivering, the service, felt more accurately described as barely meeting the minimum of requirements of a sit-down restaurant, as opposed to even remotely attentive. \\n\\nNeedless to say, the Portland breakfast/brunch scene has too many options to spend $15-20 per plate (not including tip or drink) on this lazily delivered and profoundly disappointing dining experience.

During my first few weeks of school, I was pretty annoyed that every coffee shop closed at 6pm. I'm from California, right? Where everything starts OPENING at 6. So, in the California fashion, I began asking around. \\n\\nRumor had it that there was a study spot in Ladd's Addition with lots of big tables, good music, con panna in the air and tiramisu. I was also told that this magical spot stayed open till (gasp) 11pm. I had to see it to believe it, so I piled some books and friends into the car and we drove into Ladd's.  I don't really believe in love at first sight, but pulling up to Palio, I knew it was nothing less than love. \\n\\nPalio was the cutest little coffee shop in Portland. And it was in the cutest little neighborhood too. Unlike so many of the uber modern, super sterile shops that scatter the Portland coffee scene, Palio welcomed me with an oversized cushioned seat and huge cup of black tea. \\n\\nI quickly realized that Palio's operated more like a family, less like corporate America. I think that's where some of people's intimidation regarding the staff might come from? This is not Starbucks people. And thank god. But honestly, you should know that each and everyone of the employees are fantastic- both as baristas, and as human beings. Brent and Jeremy: I wish they had brothers I could marry. The owner of Palio has taken on the roll of my Portland dad. And the cute red head with the beanie, that's Alex. She's Palio's manager, and maybe one of the kindest, most genuine people in all of Portland.

First time for me and certainly not the last. \\n\\nDrink - The Ravenous Pig Old Fashioned ($12) featured a bacon infused Old Forester bourbon, complete with what I assumed was an in-house candied bacon garnish. Super smooth and no sugar high which I appreciated a lot. The Transatlantic ($12) was another hit, very refreshing and garnished with fresh dill, lightly hanging from the glass by the world's smallest clothes pin. \\n\\nMenu - Well balanced, offering both recognizable favorites and creative adventures alike. Nicely plated items from start to finish.\\n\\nStarters - We got started with Bread ($8), Roasted Oysters ($17), and Grilled Octopus ($18). The three selections of Bread were paired nicely with their respective butter and fondue. The Oysters kept us guessing on a mystery spice that I don't believe we ever figure out - must-try! The Octopus was cooked perfectly. If anyone out there is shy with trying octopus, this plate will serve you well and as a good introduction.\\n\\nEntrees - Steak Frites ($29) and Lamb Loin ($32) with a side of the Crispy Brussels Sprouts ($9). Steak was perfectly cooked to medium and the fries were nicely seasoned with truffle salt. The porcini marinade was a little subdued and the accompanying A2 sauce didn't quite bring a wow factor but then again I don't need a sauce with my steak. The Lamb Loin was also perfectly cooked to temperature. The Lamb was not at all gamey, which I know is a dealbreaker for some people, so if you're on the fence about lamb you can order this one with confidence. The Crispy Brussels Sprouts were awesome. Real nice kick to them and a surprising combination with the peanuts and pomegranate.\\n\\nDessert - \\"Cake\\" ($8) and espresso. Nice option dessert without the overindulgent factor. \\n\\nDecor - Dim lighting with cozy, yet expansive layout. The restaurant features both a dining room and a taproom. Open kitchen view from the dining area, open brewery view from the taproom. Really nicely designed industrial look. \\n\\nService - Super attentive service.

First, I don't know where the other reviewers are getting turkey burgers but the one I had from here was dry and overcooked.  The bun was soggy and it had cheese, which I didn't request. It wouldn't even be categorized as the best average turkey burger I've ever had.  It was mediocre at best. The fries were also overdone.  I gave them and the turkey meat to my dog.  Then I tried the shrimp quesadilla, which is just disrespectful to Mexican food.  I didn't know shrimp smaller than popcorn size even existed but they managed to find them!  I had to look that close to tell that it wasn't a veggie quesadilla. And then it had American cheese on it.  There's no American cheese in Mexican food. I threw it away. \\n\\nI think they need to scale back and work on getting a couple of things done superbly then maybe branch back out.  Sadly, I won't be giving them another chance to see if they ever get on track."},{"name":"Suerte","address":"1800 E 6th St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"We went for our anniversary last week and it was amazing even though it had only been open for a few days!

I came in an hour before closing and waited about 20 minutes, line moved quite quickly but lots of things were sold out already. Would recommend coming earlier if you want to try the parfait or pastries. I ordered the O-matcha latte and the hojicha float with matcha ice cream. Both were full of green tea flavour and you can taste the quality of the matcha in the latte. I would highly recommend any of the teas/lattes if you are a matcha fanatic. Overall, it's a little expensive but still reasonably priced. For the two items I got it was $15 in total, which for good quality matcha is not too bad but definitely not a quick and cheap dessert option if that's what you're looking for.

The ingredients sounded really cool, but I have never been the biggest Bloody Mary fan and was going to be having some cocktails later, so we all just ordered food. Boston.com has called these bloody marys some of Boston's best though, for those who are fans.\\n\\nThe cocktail menu was pretty darn impressive. It was hard for me to resist indulging in one of these! But really, I was hungry and food was at the top of my brain.\\n\\nA girl at the table next to use ordered the Seared Yellow Fin Tuna Salad, and as soon as I saw the waiter set it down in front of her, all I could think was...I WANT. It wasn't too hard for me to decide on that, though the menu did have plenty of appetizing options. My friends had a way harder time choosing than I did.\\n\\nKramer ordered the Oversized Stephi Burger: ground sirloin, cheddar cheese, caramelized onions, bacon, sauteed mushrooms, and french fries. It was definitely oversized! And also over-cheesed and over-fatted - Kramer commented that the cheese was way too much, and the sirloin itself was too fatty. There was definitely a sizable pool of grease that crowded and ruined the last few fries on his plate. He liked the burger, but said next time he'd go light on the cheese or nix it completely.\\n\\nGreg's choice was definitely more unique and delicious, though not enough food for him! He has been loving shepherd's pie that Kramer cooks in their apartment, and ordered Stephanie's version, which came inside an acorn squash and with a side of deliciously salty sauteed collard greens. Fortunately for Kramer and I, Greg didn't want the greens. Greg poured gravy over the whipped potatoes on top of the dish, and it looked and tasted even better. He said it was so delicious, but again, not enough food for him.\\n\\nMy salad was fantastic, with perfectly seared tuna and plenty of yummy ingredients like marinated green beans and olives, just the way I like it. The lemon caper dressing was the star - one of the best salad dressings I've ever tasted.

The staff does a great job recommending items if you're on the fence between different things. One thing that you must order is the steamed pork soup dumplings. Each order only has 6 dumplings, so you might need to get multiple orders if you have a larger party.\\n\\nOther items sampled were the shrimp and pork potstickers, pan fried garlic beef steak, spicy string beans with minced pork, fried rice with beef and XO sauce, pan fried beef dumplings, wontons with sour chili sauce, and the red bean paste pancake for dessert.\\n\\nEverything we ordered came out fast, was freshly prepared and tasted delicious. Even in a fully packed restaurant, all the food was delivered promptly and came out faster than we could eat it, presenting the always welcome problem of not enough real estate on the table to put all the dishes.\\n\\nThe pork soup dumplings were plump and juicy. The wrapper was thick and resilient enough to contain all the soup, but was still soft and chewy. The pork had good flavor and was seasoned well. The dumplings are slightly larger than normal, which could be why there were only 6 per order.\\n\\nThe pan fried garlic beef was incredible. The beef was tender and succulent with great flavor. It was cut into very manageable pieces and the tenderness of it made it a joy to eat. The addition of garlic chips sprinkled on top enhanced and complimented the beef flavors.\\n\\nThe string beans were a bit overcooked, but still very good. I would've preferred them to have a crisper feel to them when I bite through them. The minced pork paired well and the sauce added a good level of spice without being overpowering.\\n\\nThe fried rice was one of my favorite items. The rice was cooked perfectly, wasn't sticky, had large chunks of beef and veggies, and the XO sauce enhanced the flavors of everything. The beef used in this preparation wasn't as tender or flavorful as the beef used in the garlic beef dish, and I found myself adding pieces of that beef to the rice to make it even better.\\n\\nThe potstickers were very well prepared. The skin is crispy on one side and soft and chewy on the other. A whole shrimp is used in the filling as well and it comes with a nice dipping sauce.\\n\\nThe beef dumplings were a bit heavy due to the wrapper. It felt more like eating a beef cake than a dumpling. The beef was juicy and the wrapper was crispy and flaky.\\n\\nI wasn't a fan of the wontons because I felt it was undersized and didn't have the right filling to wrapper ratio. In addition to the skewed proportions, the sauce wasn't that good; it was too watery and didn't have enough flavor.\\n\\nThe red bean paste pancake was a great finish to a very gluttonous but delicious meal. The pancake was hot and packed to the brim with red bean. The pancake was soft and slightly flaky.\\n\\nWith so many different options to choose from, all of which are prepared well and taste delicious, this is a great place to get your Chinese food fix. The service is better than expected and they are pretty attentive and make good recommendations.

She personally saw to it that we were taken care of right, even as it was late, even as the place was getting ready to close for the day. \\n\\nFirst, let me get past the name. \\"City Barbecue\\" just seemed wrong to me. I have this weird idea that barbecue cannot be urban, must be done in the spirit of all good things rural, and may even involve hiding out in the woods, enjoying some spectacular blues music, (and maybe even some moonshine) while you stir a giant pot of Brunswick Stew with a broomstick. Clearly I am wrong. These folks make some excellent food.\\n\\nThe first time I went, I had the Brisket Sandwich with some Hush Puppies and some Gumbo. Everything on that plate was excellent. The meat was cooked just right. Tender, smoky, and you've got a selection of quite a few sauces to please your palate. (If you're into that kind of thing.) They've got hot, sweet, vinegary, original, and a few other things, to boot.\\n\\nBut let me underline the excellence of those hush puppies. Lightly crisp and crunchy on the outside, dense and hearty on the inside. Made with some sweet onions, these things are an absolute winner. I would go back JUST for the hush puppies. They are that good. \\n\\nThe gumbo is more of a stew. It was thick and hearty. I get the idea it's something of a seasonal/temporary item. It is worth checking out if you're as appreciative of gumbo as I am. \\n\\nThe second time I visited, I had a two item combo with ribs, beef brisket, some green beans, and more of those crowd-pleasing hush-puppies. Let me tell you, the amount of food on that plate might feed three people. (It would easily feed two people.) Delicious brisket. And the ribs were really quite good, too.

One server told us they were waiting on our sides (baked potatoes) and another said it was almost done.

I will let you know that their serving size is generous so there will be some for leftovers.\\n\\n\\n\\n**I had to edit my review after my last experience here today. The food was amazing like usual but the customer service was subpar at best. I ordered my usual chicken teriyaki with fried rice and broccoli. There were three other orders placed after mine. They all received their food before me. The cooking area has a clear glass where you can see them prepare orders. My order was not even on the line to be prepared then the cashier seen my box and added it to the line at the very end. Instead of informing me it will be a few extra minutes they ignored me. I asked them what was the hold up and why did three orders placed after me get their food before me. Their excuse was because broccoli takes long to cook. They literally prepared everyone's order before mine. They started cooking my broccoli 20 minutes after my order was placed. I waited 30 minutes for food that I normally get in 10 mins or less.

This is such an awesome location but has not been successful to recent businesses, so it is always interesting to see what will sustain. The venue is a old converted theatre right on the main strip of uptown. It is a bbq cuisine concept with high priced entrees and platters. Very unique to the area!\\n\\nWhen you first walk in, you get an upscale country, chic vibe as you walk down the main hallway to the hostess. Then the room really opens up. They have multi level seating (again converted theatre so this makes sense), a bar in the front and access to a full view of the kitchen in the back. It was very spacious and comfortable to relax with a few friends or a large group.\\n\\nThe experience had a rocky start related to service since I called ahead on a Saturday to check if there were any specials. The woman on the phone informed me that usually the lunch specials are M-F but they were also having them today since they will not have the brunch. When we went to order the waiter said that this was not the case and checked for us returning with the same answer. Kind of frustrating considering I had called only about 30 min. prior. This could be attributed to the fact that the restaurant has only been open for a few weeks, I'll cut them some slack! The reason the lunch specials were a big deal was because they are the only meals that are reasonably priced (especially for lunch) on the menu. I can understand wanting to spend more for a dinner, but this was just lunch. I ordered a Brisket Platter and split with another. It came with 2 sides, we picked mac and cheese and the chefs veggie which was green beans with bacon. The food was quite TASTY however the platter did not come with as much as we expected for the price (only 2 small pieces of meat). \\n\\nIt definitely has trend going for it which is something most folks are really into right now. TBD on whether it will last. When it comes down to it the food, location and concept are all a great addition to the current offerings that Uptown Westerville has and I think once the kinks are worked out it will do just fine."},{"name":"33 & Melt","address":"13790 Bridgewater Crossings Blvd, Ste 1000","city":"Windermere","stars":"4","text":"While the food is great i got the mac and knife and it was basically mac in cheese stuffed into between two pieces of bread not worth the 9-10 bucks.

Chips, toppings, chips toppings like so instead of just placing the toppings just on the top. For entree we both orders boneless buffalo wings (hot flavor) I like my wings extra wet. I had a side order of onion rings. They are big might I ask and very tasty. My friend orders tater tots, they were ok not as good as my onion rings *wink*!! For drinks we both ordered the house margarita advertised for happy hour it was ok, were a bit watered down as I noticed later they were pre-made. Well my friend and I both love beer so we decided to switch it up and try the beer of the day. The pitchers were $5 so why not.

Food was really good and the service was excellent! Our server was Allan and he was very friendly and knowledgeable! All his food and beverage recommendations were great! They start you off with a sourdough bread with regular whipped butter and pastrami butter which was amazing! We had the crab bisque (I loved it! Husband thought it was a little fishy for him) and Caesar salad (comes with anchovies). Hubby ordered the Aussie Lamb Rack from the pre-fix menu and we both loved it! It was perfectly cooked and he got the wild mushroom risotto and lobster mac&cheese as his side dishes. I personally liked the risotto better than the lobster mac&cheese. I ordered the off the menu bone-in 16 oz Kansas city steak ($57). It was cooked perfectly and the seasoning and smokey flavor was on point. I tried the smoked salt they had available on the table and it did perk the taste up even more. I had the creamed corn and lobster mac&cheese. Creamed corn was good nothing special to me. We ended the dinner with the creme br√ªl√©e which had the perfect amount of torched sugar on top. Flavor was good but I thought the pudding part was a little bit firm than how I usually like it. The husband ordered the Apple Croustade which he loved a lot. I'm not so into flaky pastry so that was all his to enjoy along with the ice cream that came with it.

My boyfriend ordered their soul old fashion, which was poured tableside from a bottle filled with smoke. He enjoyed it, and I think the theateics were cool. We began with the yellowtail jalapeno shots, which had extremely bold flavors! The serrano pepper and the cilantro slapped me in the mouth on my first shot, and I really enjoyed the three of six I had. One thin. To be wary is that it has quite a salty finish, so more a few may be too overpowering. I think three each was the perfect amount.\\n\\nUnfortunately, there was no uni the night we came in because apparently they don't typically carry it. I guess I respect that if its because they couldn't get a fresh shipment. Luckily however, the night we came in, chu-toro was available. Bluefin chu-toro is my favorite!!! We actually try it hickory smoked served under a dome of smoke with a side of pickled wasabi. I honestly preferred it as it was served (no wasabi and no smoke) because I was able to appreciate the smokey flavory and fall apart texture. I'd say this was the highlight of our evening, although it was priced pretty high.\\n\\nWe also ordered the Selfie because I wanted a salmon-based roll. It's very light compared to the other rolls on the menu and doesn't have a strong flavor. Then we had the sashimi platter, which was disappointing -- featured cuts of maguro, sake, madai, hamachi, shima aji, and albacore. I was disappointed because this was the largest offering of sashimi, and for sashimi lovers, there was nothing special about it. We would've definitely been willing to pay a higher price point for a more exotic and more full plate. I guess the chef doesn't curate large sashimi platters by request because we were kind of hinting at wanting a lot of sashimi to our server. Finally, we ended on the spicy tuna on the rocks because deep fried rice is my guilty pleasure. The tuna mixture that topped the rice did not seem fresh at all.\\n\\nI think this place is best for modern take on their raw appetizers and nouveau cocktails because their nigiri/ sashimi is very average at best and the rolls were subpar. Definitely avoid this place if you're searching for authenticity. Also, I wish our server was more friendly and excited. We really love learning about feature fish and different specials at sushi restaurants, but our server just wasn't into telling us.

The young employees there are really nice and are being really well trained so I will give them that. But the food has been nothing to write home about. Tried pasta twice, scampi and Alfredo, seems like they're trying to do some kind of southwestern twist on classic Italian meals but it's just not ending up like they had hoped. Putting like a large amount of diced tomato in every sauce like the Alfredo that kind of waters it down to be honest. Pasta portions are really large though so that was a plus. Got the pizza once, thin crust, because someone had recommended it to me, I don't know what the deal was. Pizza came out burnt (black) around the edges. Couldn't be bothered to wait another 30 minutes for a pickup pizza as I am usually busy, so had to take it and eat around the inside pieces leaving the crust. That was a disappointment. All around it seems like the place is owned by or invested in by business restauranteurs and not a chef. Lots of money invested into a nice interior and stuff but the food is underwhelming. They have a lot of younger staff though that are really really polite and doing a good job, they're training those kids well in service at least.

This meal fed two to satisfaction and cost I think less than $60? All the maki rolls were BEYOND good. I was savoring every moment each one was in my mouth. The salmon on top of the lion king maki was so perfect, especially in combination with the rest of the roll, that I wanted to cry a little. The scallop maki had such a beautiful balance of flavors I would have ordered several more rolls had I not already been full. The mango and salmon was actually harmonious - you can't go wrong with this combination, but you can go right, and this was VERY right. Not to mention the presentation was glorious. If I'd only eaten the maki, this would have been a five star experience. \\n\\nI took a star off because for supposed seafood ramen, there was very little seafood in the ramen. It was fine Korean-style ramen, though the noodles were a little too well done (although I prefer mine quite chewy). The broth was good and the portion size was generous. But there were like three mussels in the entire thing and not much other seafood. I get that you don't go to a sushi place for ramen, but I'd heard good things about their noodle dishes - and if seafood ramen's gonna be on the menu, I would expect it to be a little more seafoody. \\n\\nBUT - I'll be back for the maki.

We decided to dine here based on recommendations from friends and also through the reviews on here as well. We had high expectations and this place delivered!\\n\\nWe were greeted very warmly and the host and waitress both acknowledged our one year anniversary. It was further acknowledged right on the menu as well! (We of course had to keep this and took it home.) This thoughtful gesture was a surprise to both of us that made it all the more special for us.\\n\\nAfter letting all the feels sink in, we started off with the Old Fashioned that came with a slice of crispy, delicious smoked bacon on top. I highly recommend it for any bacon lover! It really speaks to the namesake of this place and primes your palette for what is to come! We also ordered the Pimento Cheese Biscuits as an appetizer. They were flaky, savory, and a bit dry, but paired well with the drinks.\\n\\nFor our entrees, we ended up getting the Rabbit Talgliatelle and Ravenous Pub Burger and both were decadent and scrumptious. The pasta was made from scratch and the goat cheese sprinkled on top that made for a hearty and creamy pasta. The rabbit was sausage-like and to me tasted just a bit leaner and slightly gamey compared to an Italian pork sausage. The burger was classic and well-built and the truffle fries were outstanding! Such good fries...mmMmmm...\\n\\nAfter we stuffed our bellies with the main course, we ended up getting the 'Pig Tails' for dessert. These were super adorable and tasted like a flaky puff pastry served with a chocolate dipping sauce. We were also surprised with a brownie and 'Happy Anniversary' chocolate message. How sweet and thoughtful is that? *heart melts*\\n\\nOverall, what made this place special to us was how caring The Ravenous Pig was in making our one year anniversary dinner a moment to remember.

This was the real deal made with fresh ingredients.  So good I ordered a second.

Finally, Jennifer came around to take our drink order and give menus. The place is CRAZY LOUD - I couldn't hear my husband next to me. Once we got our drinks, the bartender took a good twenty minutes to see if we wanted to order. We did. Fifteen minutes ago. \\n\\nHusbands food came our first and mine a few minutes later (whatever, it happens) but my husband said his chicken wings with dry rub (which smelled great) tasted like only chicken and nothing else. His coleslaw was bland and fries were soggy. My chicken fingers came out and they were ok. The hot sauce in them wasn't really hot and my fries were soggy and tasteless, too. I ate two chicken fingers and passed on the rest of the meal. We gave a different bartender our check to try to get out of there because it was just a frustrating, not good meal, but they confused our credit cards and just took forever. \\n\\nProbably won't be back.

Went to this restaurant, last night.  Understanding it's V Day; but, the restaurant really wasn't super crowded, considering.  First thing of note, the menu changed.  There was a \\"special\\" menu which was limited to only the more pricey items on the menu.  So, the teens/young adults in our party, who were ready for a good burger, were screwed, as was my elderly Mother ready for the meatloaf.  We were seated promptly but we had a large party.  The waitress told us she would be assisted by 2 other servers...WRONG.  Struggle service was real!  Out of water most of the night.  I ordered iced tea but when I saw her return with water and without my tea, that was my first indication I would be wasting money getting iced tea and having to fight for refills.  CANCEL THE TEA!  The worst part of this experience was the fact that everyone in our party had their food....FOR SEVERAL MINUTES (like folks in our party were done eating)... and two people in our party were STILL waiting for salads and soup!! WHY?!?  How long could it take to bring out a salad and a bowl of soup!??  When I asked the waitress what happened (this is after I alerted a manager to the problem and we still waited several more minutes--so that didn't help any) she said something about thinking someone was going to \\"run her food for her\\" and clearly that didn't happen but that was just an excuse.  At that point, you knew food was missing but you're focused on someone else's food.  So, while she's making sure this next table's food is on point, my elderly Mother is STILL waiting on her soup and salad (not to mention the other young man in our party waiting on a salad).  Again, people in our party are done eating... I'm waiting to eat because I feel bad she's not eating.  This means my Sage Seafood Broil is nice and chill by the time I partake.  Terrible!  I was away from the table when the checks arrived; but, I was shocked to see the manager had not made any adjustments to the bill to account for the wretched experience with the food.  Well...let me take that back...I wasn't shocked as the manager was clearly asking every other table how things were going and didn't ask us because it was clear, they weren't going well and there were no adjustments being made to correct it.... Bottom line, customer service and goodwill were not top priorities.  I won't even get into what happened later with someone in our party... Do yourself a favor, go to Palm a couple of doors over.

We were directed to the bar where there was a \\"happy hour\\" beginning at 8PM - consisting of several cheap wines marked down to $9-$10 a glass, beers were the same prices of $6.25+. There were also several appetizers marked around $10. \\n\\nAfter hanging in the bar area for 30 minutes, we were guided to our center of the room table. We stood for for a minute while the cloth was replaced and plates were arranged. Not sure why we were brought to a table not ready for us. \\n\\nService from Vinny was friendly and attentive.

My wife went with the petite filet mingnon (8oz - medium - $43.95). Unlike some of the better steakhouses, i.e. berns, where your steak is accompanied by soup and side, Flemings is completely ala cart providing some overpriced sides to accompany your main. We added the chipotle cheddar Mac and cheese ($10.95) and truffle-parsley mashed potatoes ($10.50). \\n\\nDishes were brought out fairly quickly... Steaks cooked to perfection and delicious. Mashed potatoes tasted like out of the can, definitely not worth the unreasonable $10.50 accompanying price tag. Mac and cheese was delicious, albeit minuscule.

However, I left somewhat U satisfied for $132.00 before tip for 2 steaks, 2 sides, and a beer. The food does not commensurate with the price.

For a Thursday night dinner they only really started filling up closer to 8pm. The server came by right away to bring us got towels to cleanse our hands. This was a really nice touch that I haven't seen at my usual sushi spots.\\n\\nI ended up ordering the Millennium Roll (Shrimp tempura, cream cheese, cucumber topped with shrimp, avocado, eel sauce, scallions for $12) and the Sweet Potato Roll (sweet potato tempura, cream cheese, cashew nuts). Both were very good. The cashews in the Sweet Potato Roll were surprising and added another dimension to a roll I've had a million times. The Millenia Roll was good, but not the most memorable roll of the evening.\\n\\nThat designation would go to my dinner-mate's Rising Sun Roll (Lump snow crab salad, panko fried scallops, mayo, masago, topped with escolar [a type of fish], tobiko [flying fish roe], spicy mayo, eel sauce, tempura flakes for $15). Yes, it's a tad pricey for a small roll, but boy did it back in some flavor and an incredible array of textures! The tobiko is crunchy and placed in the center of the circle in which the chef has placed the roll. They are light with the mayo and the escolar is perfect on top. This roll had us really jazzed.\\n\\nAdditionally, we shared a small garden salad appetizer. I appreciated the amount of dressing since I'm a ginger dressing fanatic, but we noticed that (perhaps as a result) the greens were not crunchy and were even a bit soggy.\\n\\nOverall a great date night and we'd definitely return to try more - hopefully leaving room for dessert next time!"},{"name":"Renaissance Orlando at SeaWorld","address":"6677 Sea Harbor Dr","city":"Orlando","stars":"3.5","text":"I'm not used to staying at fancy hotels so maybe I don't have anything to compare it to, but man this place is amazing!

Good noodles, quality ingredients, colorful vegetables, everything except an outstanding flavorful taste. It was suprisingly missing. They do have their version of General Tso's chicken, called General Chey's however I didn't want to order that since general tso's or any sort of orange chicken is quite easy.\\n\\nI ordered the Spicy Thai Basil noodle dish because I figured that it'd be... spicy, if anything, flavorful, even if I may not like it... but it ended up tasting like nothing. Filler. The texture was there, but no discernable flavor. Even more odd was how this was also the case with the japanese teriyaki udon. Considering how popular and obvious it is to present a teriyaki flavor... the fact that this dish too was missing taste only compounded the shock. Disappointing really.\\n\\nEverything up to that point was great.

The coffees came first and they tasted very much like your typical Vietnamese iced coffee. Next, came our entrees. Honestly, the hu tieu kho tastes EXACTLY like how my mom makes hers. Good portion size with minced meats, seafood, and a quail egg. The soup on the side was ok... gingery with a strange flavour profile. The coffee coconut flan for dessert (not pictured) was not the best and we did not end up finishing it. Price-wise, it is going to be pricier than your typical mom and pop pho shop.

While I have seen a few changes over time, I think they're figuring things out rapidly and settling into themselves and I hope the quality remains consistent.

They serve their gyros with a salad which means that salad turn over is rampant and all of my veggies here are always in great condition. Pastries are well baked, they serve both thin and regular crust pizza, the pita is always fluffy and thoroughly warmed through. The yogurt and feta quality are way above the rest. The tzatziki is lovely, not too tangy, thick, creamy and lightly speckled with flavor. The crisp and tender complimentary beignets topped with cinnamon and honey are always a delight and while I'm pretty sure they're coming after my meal I can't be entirely certain I'm not on the no-no list, it's like Santa all over again.

Thankfully there is ample seating at Suerte, and the crowd of people did not keep me from getting in.\\n\\nAs I was dining by myself, I took a seat at the bar.  Immediately upon being seated Blake greeted me and offered me water: still or sparkling.  Just so you know, sparkling water is NOT an upcharge here.  All the water at Suerte is filtered, and the same machine that filters the water can dispense it at room temperature, cold, or sparkling.  It's details like this that most people won't notice that make this a top notch dining destination.\\n\\nService from the moment seated through leaving the restaurant was warm and attentive. I felt like a valued customer, and my dining experience was well-paced.\\n\\nThe food here is incredible.  Super fresh.   Super well executed.  The theme of Suerte is its masa made from scratch starting with whole corn.  For instance, the tostadas I had today. . . the masa to make them was ground from whole corn earlier today, and cooked to order.  This makes a noticeable flavor difference, akin to fresh bread or freshly roasted, ground and brewed coffee.  \\n\\nI started with the snapper tostada.  Very smooth and light way to start the meal.  The snapper was fresh and sweet, the tostada as I described earlier was so fresh and toasty and crunchy.  I next had the chicken tamal.  This one was surprisingly spicy.  And unexpectedly the spiciness was in the masa of the tamal.  It was supremely delicious, and I very much enjoyed the serving style of the seasoned chicken with herb adornments resting a top the tamal instead of being buried within.  After those two items, I still had room for more so I ordered the Green Chorizo Tlayuda.  This was light and covered with herbs, and another delicious dish.  \\n\\nAfter these three items, I still had room for more, so I ordered the \\"If You Got it Flan it.\\"  The apricot orange sorbet served with the flan provided a bright citrusy offset to the otherwise creamy custard dessert.  \\n\\nNothing in my experience at Suerte was wanting, I loved everything about it, and I can't wait to go back."},{"name":"Antica Pizzeria & mozzarella Bar","address":"249 W State Hwy 436, Ste 1105","city":"Altamonte Springs","stars":"4.5","text":"Inedible food!

When I placed the second order which cost $400, I inquired about the online promo for buy 4 pizzas and get one free (I didn't have the coupon which I should have but still could bring because the order hasn't gone through yet) and she said \\"And I'll ask about the free pizza for you.\\" Seriously? When someone spends $400 I feel like employees should just honor a promotion with or without having something printed. Furthermore, I ordered an Italian sub tonight and gave them my boyfriends number because he was picking up the order. Go figure, they ran out of bread... they called him and asked if they could put it on a wrap (he said yes, ugh)... Disappointed to say the least, not so much because it's on a wrap (which isn't ideal) but they charged the same price for a pile of meat in a wrap half the size of a sub & added tomatoes when I specifically asked for none. That's the least of my issues though. I've also had the wrong sub delivered before too but no worries, no compensation and they made sure to take back the wrong sub and deliver it to the appropriate person, I'm sure. Good thing I opened it and luckily for the next person eating it, I didn't touch it. I get that businesses need to make money but I'm going to find somewhere else to give a bunch of money to.

Nonetheless, I'll give it 3 stars since it's an Atlanta staple. Food is mediocre and there are more cons than pros. First, you have to stand outside in a line if you're placing an order to go because only about 2 people can stand inside since it's so small, and they don't want you blocking the ATM machine. I'm not sure what that's about because they take cards? So they have a line monitor working at the door. They accommodate more easily people who stay to eat, they didn't have to stand in line with the rest of us. Other cons-no lunch menu or lunch prices on any day! But they open at 11 am, but be prepared to pay about $15 for a chicken meal with small portioned sides! Also there are other cons- parking is horrible, service is not the best, be prepared to wait, and watch your surroundings in this area. They could also use a little remodeling considering the business they bring in.

Mushrooms had a tangy herby dressing and were delish. Hearty bread with crunchy crust and soft middle. I had the tortellini which was very inventive: salami in tortellini? Flavors were very well balanced. Mushrooms and pancetta were tasty. My only reservation with this dish was the fact that there was a ton of broth but I was not given a spoon. I don't think it was meant to be a soup, but there was enough broth to call it one. Gnocchi, endive dish, and burger were all enjoyed as well. The dessert was off the charts.

How the fck can you not have a sauce bar??? I pretty much strictly use shacha sauce and I think their premade sauce has some shacha in it, but it's diluted down so much and mixed with other stuff that it didn't taste very good.

I was thoroughly annoyed because the staff wouldn't take away any of our finished dishes and was not attentive with filling our pots with more water.

Are they little tiny 3-piece numbers, or full-size rolls? As people around us got our plates while we pondered, it was obvious that these were the real thing.  I ended up with the Maki Combo Nishi, while my companion got the Kita special.  Both were amazingly fresh and way more than I'm used to eating for lunch.  The lunch boxes that were being devoured to our right and left looked delicious as well.  It was a hard call between the two and I think if we had it to do over, we might get a lunch box and a sushi lunch and split.

On days when they really mess the pearls up, they can be clumpy. Regardless, the teas are pretty standard and made quickly. This place satisfies my boba cravings, but if you want better boba drinks, I would recommend venturing out to Allston.

I placed an order via email on a Monday for 6 side items for an office holiday lunch. I asked that the food be ready for pickup by Thursday (3 days later) at 10:30 am. I quickly received a response from the catering manager acknowledging receipt and stating that \\"payment must be made today.\\" Cool. I immediately paid the invoice (also sent by the catering manager) online and saved the payment confirmation.\\n\\nThursday arrives and I'm running late after a meeting, rushing to Busy Bee to pick up the food for me and 30-something other hungry working adults. I walk in around 11 am and give my name to the polite host just inside. He goes next door (where catered items are prepared), comes back, and asks me my name again to confirm. I again tell him my name and ask him if everything is ok. He assures me everything is. I was then asked whether the order could be under someone else's name 3 separate times by a gentleman from the catering side. At that point I began to conclude to myself that the food that we ordered did not exist. This thought was the only thing that I had to go off of since no one had yet bothered to give me an upfront explanation otherwise (strike 1). The host then told me that \\"they're getting it ready,\\" making it seem as though the food was being boxed up to be carried to my car (strike 2 - that was a lie; keep reading). At this point it's about 11:15. Lunch is scheduled to begin at the office at noon, and it's about a 10 minute drive there. Being the person that I am, I'm starting to panic already. Ten more minutes or so go by and nothing. I start asking bluntly, what happened to my food? Was it given away accidentally? No one would tell me. Just \\"they're getting it ready.\\" I emphasized to the host that I had 40 people waiting to eat at noon (it's past 11:30 now) and if someone could please give me an estimated time of completion. \\"We're gonna get ya outta here with your food, don't worry\\" they said (lied).  \\n\\nWhile I continued to wait, I was told twice that the catering manager (who works offsite) would call me. She never did. I called her. Twice. I got ahold of her the second time, and it was then that she admitted that our order was never communicated to the kitchen the day that it was ordered and paid for. STRIKE. THREE. Even though it was SO imperative for us to pay on the same day that we ordered, and even though we did, we fell victim to carelessness. Not only that, but she let me know that when I arrived at the restaurant for pickup, the food had not even been cooked. Lies confirmed. I hang up with the catering manager and I am fuming! One of the servers offers me sweet tea and pie shortly after and I'm so upset that I couldn't even respond \\"no\\" to her. \\"How much longer?!\\" was all I could muster up. She said she'd check on the catering side. She returns and goes back behind the restaurant counter to work, as if I never asked her a question. Having had more than enough, I go to the host and demand that I be told how much longer the food would be. My voice is raised and my hands are assisting with getting my point across. Again, people who are in the middle of their workday are waiting for their food that has already been paid for, and I can't even tell them how much longer it's going to be! I am livid and out of character at this point, and ended up having to apologize to the host once I FINALLY got my food over an hour after arriving.\\n\\nI concluded that the restaurant staff avoided giving me an explanation and \\"fudged\\" how long the food would take so that I wouldn't walk out and be entitled to a full refund. Never have I ever been duped by a restaurant like this before. It's unfortunate, as this is a popular Atlanta establishment frequented by residents and visitors alike. The food is outstanding! This was the third year that my company ordered from Busy Bee for our holiday luncheon. That says a lot. However time is always of the essence, and I'd say that it's probably to the 10th power in my office. It's just the nature of our business. So, when lunch is delayed by 45 minutes for a group of people whose jobs are meeting and deadline-driven, it's not a good thing. When a customer is as frustrated as I was, it's not a good thing. Surely no one will welcome the idea of Busy Bee being on the menu next year for the holidays."},{"name":"J Buffalo Wings","address":"6595 Roswell Rd, Ste H","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3.5","text":"the cashier, aaron, is really good looking :) other than that, strongly recommend the lemon pepper wings!"},{"name":"Century Bar","address":"930 SE Sandy Blvd","city":"Portland","stars":"3","text":"If you are a person of color in Portland, you will not feel welcomed here.

For that, Jacks gets 4 stars. If I were really basing this on consistent quality of food + service, it would be more like 3 stars.\\n\\nI have dined in at Jacks 3 times and ordered takeout twice. Generally, the service is very friendly but rather slow, so I'd recommend squaring away your whole order up front and leaving it up to them to pace out (the pizzas take a fairly long time just based on cook times, anyway, so better to also order something to snack on in the meantime). Plus side: there's plenty of cheap beer to tie you over! One of the three times I dined in the wait times on food were incrediblyyyyy slow. 50+ minutes for chicken wings and another hour for the pizza after that. The bartender was very apologetic and comped our bill accordingly. These things happen. Fortunately there's always some good people watching and oftentimes trivia to keep you entertained.\\n\\nThe first time I got the wings I was sure I'd found my new go-to wing spot in Atlanta. The next couple of times I wasn't quite as enthusiastic, but they are still good. They just alternate between being doused in sauce or basically a dry rub (and that isn't because I've ordered them differently).\\n\\nTakeout is consistently good--we order some version of the Big Mama pizza and add banana peppers. It's a bit TOO much meat for a meat lovers pizza in my opinion, so I'd recommend scaling back at least 1 of the included meats. It's a pricey pizza but worth it once in a while. They also offer pizza by the slice, which I've never done. They have some crazy flavor combinations for pizzas which all sound intriguing but I've never gotten too adventurous there.\\n\\nThe environment at Jacks is so fun and different from a lot of places in Atlanta that I'd suggest checking it out yourself for a fun, casual night out."},{"name":"Moe's Southwest Grill","address":"7484 University Blvd","city":"Winter Park","stars":"3","text":"I often frequent Moes at home in St. Pete and have never had as poor an experience.

The other customers was done and started to leave and we were like literally the only table left on the third floor. 20 minutes had past. We didn't order much. It's getting ridicoulous. We're just sitting there waiting for the meats to come out. The waiter was just on his phone the whole time ignoring our existence. My hubby had to go up to him.

With the new remodel this McDonald's is hoping to polish their image. But...you can't polish a turd. That being said, I eat here occasionally and would enjoy coming back. I would appreciate better service, yes. And a shorter wait time. Especially when people that ordered after me are getting their order first. This is a busy location. They have at least 8 people working here. Only one is at the front register. And this person is not very attentive or customer service oriented in my experience. They now have a system of ordering whereby you can order on an app, a touch screen inside the restaurant, at the drive through or at the counter, and there are couriers picking up food for those who must not, or cannot leave the house. So they use a large printed number system on your receipt ticket. There is also a screen showing which order number is being served currently and which numbers are being prepared. Helpful, yes, but only if the numbers are actually used effectively does the customer benefit. Every other number I saw on that screen was called out as the order was presented. When my number was on the now serving side, I did not hear a number called, nor did anyone acknowledge that there was an order ready to go. I waited...I waited....I waited.... no number called, no \\"your order is ready,\\" no eye contact. Finally, when no one came to the counter to call the number, and the register worker was free, I approached to ask about my order. \\"Oh, it's here,\\" she said (bag sitting on counter, unattended), \\"I said Big Mac and fries.\\" I'm thinking: Um, really? Because that is not my number, and I'm certain you did not say a word about it, because I did not see or hear anything from you. \\n\\nMcDonald's seriously, if you are going to use a number system, be consistent.

I felt sorry for the lone server working that night, as the place was packed, and so the service was kind of lacking, but the meal itself made up for it, albeit I found the portions a little on the smaller side. We ordered the spring rolls (nothing out of the ordinary here), lychee wrapped bacon (who woulda thought a combination like that could work?!), Bob's poutine (when I first heard it, I thought to myself, \\"Wtf...'

That being said, even with all that food for the 6 of us, (including a bowl of rice for each of us), I still left feeling pretty hungry.  Good meal overall; I did see a help wanted sign on the door, so hopefully they'll get the staff they so desperately need.

And there just aren't too many in my area. Which is strange, so when I end up in need of a baked treat, bar, cake or pie, it's usually to Whole Foods or New Seasons. But, Corner Bakery is nice, since it's a quick jump out of the car, sit inside or order to go, a sweet treat, breakfast sandwich, or lunch. \\n\\nFirst time I came here, I had a coupon for a kids free meal, and it was Mac and cheese we were craving! We saw they had that, so off to Corner Bakery we went. That's what daughter and I got, a kids Mac and cheese, a veggie panini, and a few treats just to get because you know, I couldn't walk outta there without treat when a big glass case full of tasty carby sugary baked goods staring at us in the face!! No way!!\\n\\nWhen I pulled up I coulda sworn it was a IHOP from the outside with trendier colors and more modern lines. As the big printed posters of pancakes and eggs plastered on the Windows were so IHOP-esqe, I decided against breakfast because it was way too breakfasty for my liking. (Only thing I ever usually get breakfast-wise is bacon. Or a pancake here and there). And then walking into the restaurant (I call it a restaurant now as it was full on plates of sausages and French toast on the patrons plates I saw, not so much a bakery) I realized, okay, wait, this is way too a panera bread look alike too not be a franchise. :( \\n\\nAnd guess what...it is a franchise. I found out after I googled it. Hence the way too plastic perfectness of it. Not the more rugged homey feeling I was looking for. \\n\\nBut it was good I googled it after my venture here, so I didn't judge it as a franchise, but I figured it out obviously.\\n\\nAnyways, back to the food. The Mac and cheese comes with 3 cheeses and breadcrumbs on top, and you can add bacon or other things to it. Daughter got it plain with nothing but cheese. (She's deathly afraid of anything more then simple ingredients and no condiments, condiments are evil). She and I loved it. It was ooey gooey, cheesy, not orange, and noodles al dente. Yay!  \\n\\nI was in a vegetarian mood, so I got the veggie panini on a whole grain seedy bread. Very good actually, grilled nicely, but could have used more salt. And I'm not a very salty girl. So prob even more salt for the normal person.  It tasted like a sandwich I would have whipped up at home. I think that's a good thing. It was well done.\\n\\nNow the treats... I will go back for those without a doubt and I already have..a few times. The pecan maple bar, is to DIE for. It's like a serious pecan pie bar done fabulously. The blueberry hand pie was also fantastic. The dough was flaky and moist, blueberries inside were juicy/creamy filling (make sense?), just awesome. Bundt cakes too were delicious and velvety. \\n\\nI took husband here and we were in need of a quick breakfast sandwich, think starbx breakfast sandwich like, we enjoy those because they are the closest to being a healthy choice sandwich. And it was cool, because we buy these breads from Winco called \\"Flat Outs\\", they are really thin bread buns with whole grains, low carbs and low calories. Anyways, they use these here as a substitute for the high carb bagels or English muffins. Yes!!! We both were thrilled, so nice when we don't have time to make one at home, we know where to go!! :) They call them \\"flats\\" here, with any kind of egg, meats, or veggies on it. Just yummy.\\n\\nService was great, and quick. They have a full menu of breakfast and lunch items. Big coffee bar area, lots of pastries, (daughter got a buttery croissant, yes, simple), and they have a large seating area, it is a perfect place for a quick biz meeting or an easy alone studying time. \\n\\nAll in all, a great little place!

The food is still among the best you'll find at Disney, and here you'll find a more interesting selection of fish and game to choose from if you're the adventurous type. My wife and I, unfortunately, are not all that adventurous, and kept it simple. I had the filet, and she has the salmon. Both were very good, but far from the best we've ever had. The salad appetizer was fantastic, though -- probably the best salad we ate all week.\\n\\nI wanted to come back to Artist Point because I wanted to revisit the Wilderness Lodge, which is easily one of Disney's most beautiful resort hotels. I stayed here back in 1995 and absolutely loved it. It's undergoing a massive expansion right now, so unfortunately we didn't pick the best time to come. But it was nice to return to its warm and cozy confines.\\n\\nIf you're not staying at the Wilderness Lodge, or if you have no real interest in checking it out, I don't know that I would make Artist Point a destination for your trip. For one, it can be a pain to get to. The only forms of Disney transportation that will get you here are the dreaded bus, or a slow boat ride from the Magic Kingdom. We were staying at the nearby Polynesian resort and hopped a quick $6 Uber car over. Remember people, when it comes to getting around at Disney, Uber is your friend."},{"name":"Something Fishy","address":"2107 A E Semoran Blvd","city":"Apopka","stars":"4.5","text":"This seafood restaurant offers a variety of sandwiches, entrees and unique sides. We had lunch and tried several items. We had a fried chicken strip sandwich with thick seasoned fries,  blackened swai with rice/black beans amd a cute concept of a play on words called a fish bowl. With the fish bowl you choose the fish and how it is cooked with up to 4 items in your bowl. I had blackened cod with black beans, lettuce, red onions and tomatoes. I was also interested in their side of cabbage especially since I received a yelp coupon for  a side. This cabbage had many flavors with carrots, green onions, purple cabbage tossed with a vinaigrette. This was a large portion so we took it home. This side was tasty and served with a protein would also be a good meal.\\nThe portions were generous, the food was very flavorful,  served hot and with a smile. We had lemonade to refresh ourselves and it was sooooo good. Last but not least they offer dessert and a beautiful orange cake caught our eye. We were soooo satisfied that we took the cake home and it had a wonderful orange sweet smell. The cake was moist, tasty and icing was also delicious.\\nStop by this place and enjoy the cute decorations and the good food!"},{"name":"White's Bakery","address":"100 Derby St","city":"Hingham","stars":"3.5","text":"White's original location was larger and offered a better experience in terms of browsing and feeling comfortable; there current location feels cramped.

It was tender, mixed with sweet corn and other veggies, and lightly spiced. However, the roasted angus brisket was flavorful but way too oily for my liking. \\n\\nAfter finishing my meal, I went along my merry way and headed home, but felt violently sick on the way back. As much as it pains me to give the two star review, (because I really was rooting for this place) I felt I had to because I had a less than pleasant experience after the fact.

A new spin on wings with chili jam and coconut dressing making them tender and juicy. I also loved the pulled pork with coleslaw and bbq gastrique on brioche buns.

This isn't how a restaurant of this size should be run. It's too bad the bartenders are so terrible because the food is actually quite good. I even tipped the cook the other day for making such a great meal. Generally speaking if the staff is this bad it's a manager problem. I'll try going to the new one in the Altamonte Mall because beyond the terrible service, it's actually a great place from an atmosphere and food point of view. The location is like 2 minutes outside my neighborhood, which makes it even a bigger disappointment. We went to Liam Fitzpatricks and the bartenders were fantastic, happy and introduced themselves even while it was busy. What a disappointment, it used to be a lot better than this. This will be my last visit to this location because this is the 3rd time I've been treated like crap.

The chashu--nice thick cuts of meat and very tasty. The miso broth--creamy and completely tasteless. My daughter's Miso Ramen was on the saltier side (I had to finish her's today because she didn't like it, and she usually finishes her ramen. She did say her Ajitama and Chashu were good).

The cooks could use a pep talk though.\\n\\nSo, wary of the items I'd already had, I decided to try something different.  I ordered the chicken fried steak sandwich.  Right out of the gate, I noticed that a few things were off.  First of all, it was thick.  Chicken fried steak is the Confederate Schnitzel: It must be pounded thin before being cooked.  This thing was half an inch thick.  The crust was crisp to the point of being petrified and when I finally reached the meat, I could barely taste it because it was deep fried and oozing oil.  You can get a better chicken fried steak from shallow pan-frying than from plunging it into the fryer.  This also meant that it was impossible to taste the seasonings in the breading, if they were even used.\\n\\nThe Tabasco honey, slaw, and sweet pickles were pretty good but they were window dressing by that point.  The waffle fries were really good and I ended up eating all of them after I gave up on the sandwich.  The black pepper gravy tasted nothing like black pepper.  It was more like a smoky cheese sauce with a mayo twist.\\n\\nI've had good food at Taverns around town.

The store is brand new but already looks worn out, with chunks of drywall missing, wood peeling off the panels, and a super scratched and patchy floor. Staff look like they are doing their best but are really slow. And the whole reservation thing is just weird. I've never heard of having to make reservations for mediocre softserve and soup noodles. This couldn't possibly be run by the same company as in Japan. Most ridiculous are the handwritten scraps of paper that are embarrassingly taped to the windows with masking tape, making the store look more like a rundown, 3rd-world, greasy-spoon joint than a premium Japanese brand.

When you decide what you want, you place your order at a central kiosk (under a tree?), then select the table you want.  They also have two spinning saddles to entertain the kids by the kiosk.  \\n\\nYour order is sent to the kitchen and bar right away and your server greets you at the table, brings your food and updates your bill with any additional drinks or desserts as the meal progresses.  When you are ready to leave, you pay at the kiosk, so there is no waiting for the server at either end of your meal.  Pretty cool concept.\\n\\nThey call it casual dining but there are lots of upscale bells and whistles at this location.  The restaurant was built in a new retail center in the West Linn Central Village and it was evident that a lot of time, effort and MONEY was spent launching this new venture.  It kind of reminds me of an upscale model home with the latest fixtures and furniture.\\n\\nThe decor is Southwestern, so they have modified Pendleton blankets as curtains (they also sell the blankets) and there are high back booths made of cowhide.  One of my favorite features was the community table around a fire pit in the middle of the restaurant that seats up to 12.  I must say that I dug the decor, but I think some people may view it as way too themey.  \\n\\nThe food was pretty darn good and reasonably priced (entrees range from $9 - $17):\\nI had a cup of the house soup (Chicken & Green Chili Chowder - yum) and a half order of the Flat Iron Steak Salad (not enough steak).  My hubby had the Rib Eye Steak  with mashed potatoes and asparagus.  I will say that the food was good, and the portion size is reasonable.  It is so common these days to get huge servings of food, but not here.\\n\\nThe kids meals are $5.95 and you have a choice of five entrees, plus two side dishes and a drink.  One son ordered the cheeseburger and they forgot to put cheese on it, so they let him eat the original burger and also brought him a second burger at no charge.  (And yes, he ate every bite of both).  My other son had the quesadilla.  They offer healthy sides, so the regular and sweet potato fries aren't deep fried in oil.  The other healthy side options are salad or fruit salad.  The sweet potato fries and fruit salad are the clear winners here.\\n\\nThey have five signature cocktails and we ordered the Pomegranate and Blue Sage margaritas which were both good.  \\n\\nA few touches that were cool: \\n**They bring your drinks right away, as well as goldfish and coloring/activity books for the kids. \\n**Kids meals are served on cafeteria trays on old fashioned cowboy-style dishes.    \\n**Instead of your standard bread basket, you get a selection of scones, biscuits and cornbread with regular and SWEET JALAPENO BUTTER.  Omg that was good!\\n\\nRelatively small beer and wine list and there is a bar, but it is in the middle of the restaurant, rather than a separate space.  \\n\\nAbout five dessert options and we chose the churros.  Four warm cinnamon sugar sticks with chocolate sauce for dipping.  At $3.95 it was a total bargain and perfect to share with the family.  \\n\\nThis place is one of my new family favorite destinations in the area."},{"name":"Velvet Taco Domain","address":"11501 Rock Rose Ave, Ste 160","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"While entertaining visiting business clients, a colleague recommended Velvet Taco as a good spot for upscale, Texas tacos.

Based on the reviews I read, these seemed to be all the rave, with reviews mentioning Cathay Pacific not skimping on the crab meat. Yes, this is true, the amount of it is above average.\\n\\nHowever, filling alone does not a Crab Rangoon make! Having a great shell is also incredibly important. This is where the weakness of this dish lies. While there were some crispy parts, more than I would have liked was on the soft side. \\n\\n+ Pork Fried Rice - This was mediocre at best. I liked how it was cooked, and the touch of bean sprouts mixed in, but there wasn't much else that made it special. On the one hand, it was not over seasoned, but on the other it was quite bland. If you end up ordering this, I bet some lobster sauce would go a long way (although I haven't tried it, so don't quote me on it).\\n\\n+ Cashew Chicken - I'll give them this... Asian-style chicken in some sort of sauce is more often than not overly saccharine. I am glad to report this was not the case here. However, even though the chicken was cooked well, the sauce was exceedingly bland and nondescript. I would also like to add that even though this dish was advertised as spicy, I did not detect a single hint of said spiciness (disclaimer: I am slightly desensitized to spiciness, you may detect more than me).\\n\\nThe cashews were also presented a little differently than I was expecting. I thought they would be somehow integrated into the chicken. However, this was not the case, they were whole (halved, perhaps?) cashews floating around in the sauce. \\n\\nAnother gripe I have with the chicken is that there was a great deal more veggies than I was expecting. Also, what is it with the mushrooms? The veggies and chicken were tiny little pieces, whereas the mushrooms were huge! These things were quite unwieldy to handle with a fork alone. \\n\\nPortion sizes were good, and the prices were also quite reasonable. \\nConsidering I can EAT, the lunch special which cost just under 10 bucks before taxes was enough to fuel me for two lunches. Even so, because the quality was lacking, I am unlikely to order from this place soon."},{"name":"Cathay Pacific Restaurant","address":"111 Hancock St","city":"North Quincy","stars":"3","text":"The service was horrible...we won't be going back here . the food was cold and uncooked"},{"name":"Henri's Bakery & Caf√©","address":"56 E Andrews Dr NW","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"I absolutely love this place.

That's how good it is. It will even get me to go back to that godforsaken place that is the Pearl district! I'm serious people. There has got to be something special to get me down there. \\n\\nSomething special is what is happening at 13th and Flanders, let me tell you. Unpretentious food, unpretentious staff, and all in a beautifully done space. Not overpriced for the Pearl, and... well... as you can see, I am thoroughly impressed. \\n\\nLet's start with the happy hour. Rotating special drinks that come with free nibbles on the side? Yup. $1.50 sliders? Oh yeah. Slightly more expensive but larger bites like salads and artichoke rolls? Done and Done... you got me for happy hour. 4-6pm. Do it. \\n\\nDinner?  I guess I would call the food here \\"Southern Comfort Tapas\\". Many of the plates are offered a-la-carte, but at a-la-carte prices. Sliders, sandwiches, etc. Good stuff for ordering a bunch of different things and sharing. Great twists on old favorites like sliders (they have a chicken and waffle slider with maple coffee syrup - YUM!), po-boys, etc. Excellent looking apps, and as Laura mentioned, giant sized entrees like a full on clam bake. $28 for a whole clam bake in the Pearl? Those other shi shi pretentious restaurants in the pearl with their $28 4oz halibut fillets can go to hell. \\n\\nWere it not for my gorging on HH snacks and apps, I could have gobbled down at least 2 of any of the amazing looking desserts on the menu. Fried cherry pie with sour cream ice? ARE YOU KIDDING?!?!? I will be back for dessert. You have been warned.\\n\\nThe decor is quite upscale... modern mixed with contemporary field rock but not in the usual 50's throw-back design. Nice, tight lines, dark browns mixed with white, classy yet not so stark as black and white. It was comfortable in its chic. I felt at home in my lightning-yellow shirt covered in bright red stars (well, ok, the stuck up Pearl district patrons in the dining room side seemed to stare a bit, but in the bar side, it was all game). Even the manager complimented me. He seemed to be pleased to have a non-Pearl group of patrons dining in. We felt welcomed, and for that, we will certainly be back.\\n\\nThey were pouring some special rum the night we were there, so we didn't try any of the house cocktails, but the drinks we had were made quite well. At 10 days in operation, the bartender seems to be getting his stuff down. The bar was replete with samplings from local distilleries including Integrity Spirits' Trillium Absinthe. Good stuff.\\n\\nAll in all, 4 people had 6 cocktails, appetizers, a sampling of sliders, salads, sides, and a sandwich, and we escaped for about $100 after a generous tip. We were all stuffed to the gills. That price in the pearl for some seriously tasty food, and... uh... well, I guess the only reason any other restaurants in the area should remain open is to lure people away from this place so it's less crowded when I go. \\n\\nI hate to advertise, because I want this place for myself. \\n\\nIf you are looking to go out for a snooty-tooty Pearl district night out, please, go elsewhere. This is real food for real people in a surprisingly nice setting for an incredibly realistic price.

I'm not a beer person, however all my friends always enjoy their selection on tap. Their alcoholic beverages are well-priced too, helping you imbibe without breaking the bank. \\nTheir food is also excellent. Their burger is great, however if you are feeling like comfort food, get their mac n'cheese with or without bacon and chorizo. It is the perfect price ($5!) and served in your own baby cast iron skillet. While I have had many other things on the menu, this is my favorite. So much so that one night I looked around and every person at our table (6, total) had ordered the mac n'cheese. It shouldn't be missed! \\nTo round off your evening, I also suggest the s'mores.

We had the teppanyaki again, the owner of the restaurant was very chipper and nice BUT the chef was beyond unprofessional. He was in his 50's and was definitely not good at his job. He dropped his tools while throwing them multiple times, drew two stick men with the rice and proceeded to say \\"How do you tell which one is a boy.\\" MIND YOU THERE was TWO CHILDREN/PRETEENS PRESENT. He then drew a penis on one of the stickmen with salt. I've never seen my dad so unimpressed. The chef also spilled my God father's beer and he was not reimbursed.

Super fresh but not blown away.\\n- Squash with Burrata: I've never had melted burrata, so this was a little different but the taste was good was just confused. Squash was cooked well.\\n- Cobia: I don't think I've ever had cooked Cobia just raw so I'm not sure what the texture should be like but felt slightly over cooked. Still tasty though. Sauce tasted like oyster sauce, may not be everyone's cup of tea.\\n\\nTOP TWO DISHES (I would definitely order these again)\\n- Charred Corn with Crab: had great flavor and good texture.\\n- Coffee Ice Cream & Mascarpone Dessert: this was there take on Tiramisu. Super creamy and delicious, liked the bite of the black cacao.

The service has continued to be top-notch, even if I am only running in to pay and pickup my goods. \\nTonight, however, was a game changer, and they totally deserve a 5 star! I was able to bring some of my family to dine in, including my 97-year old feisty Italian grandmother (AKA Noni).  This was excellent as we all like to pick off of each other's plates so we were able to try out some of their other options. We did have to repeat the Bufala, of course (WORTH IT!). The lasagna - a perfect sized personal lasagna with fantastic sauce. The seasonal special of pumpkin ravioli- this is literally autumn and sage in your mouth! Creamy and savory with just a touch of crunchy crumble on top.  The calzone (essentially the size of one of their pizzas folded in half) - with the improved crust this is perfect; large but not overwhelming and daunting like some places where you just get a huge ball of dough and often no filling.  The bufalina pizza was also fantastic because, well, pizza plus that bufala you cant go wrong! My Mom described it as being just like the pizza she had when in Italy (not Americanized like your typical pizzas in the states). If I didn't mention before, they are all hand thrown to order and cooked in a brick oven, which always makes for a better pizza.\\nWe completed the meal with the sharing of 3 desserts: the panacotta (an Italian custard) was cooingly sweet and marries well with the blueberry compote. The chocolate mousse was light and airy. The two cannolis were wicked good - the shell, the filling, the pistachio = perfection. \\nNot only was the food fabulous but once again, amazing service.

Don't expect large portions here.  We are talking small portions and big price.  We asked for bread and they didn't have any. \\n\\nA salad with mixed greens with kale in a small bowl Ch√®vre and what appeared to be grated horseradish on top.  The greens were fresh and delicious but had to be cut to eat which was a bit difficult because they were served in a bowl instead of on a plate. \\n\\nThe jumbo truffle tater tot's were a lot of potato and very little truffle and seem to taste a bit burnt.  Not that tasty. \\n\\nThe truffle mushroom fettuccine had a delicious sauce, noodles were definitely fresh and the combo of mushrooms was perfect.  The presentation could've been better by adding parsley or something else to the top. \\n\\nThe dessert sundae was a very small scoop of ice cream with about a tablespoon of bourbon infused apples on top of it and a few crumbles of oatmeal.  No... It wasn't good. :-(\\n\\nThis one meal was about $55 without drinks.  I think we would of been better off just having drinks here and going elsewhere for the meal.

My boyfriend used to be a frequent flyer due to its vast TV set up for sporting events but has not been in recent past. Per him, the menu has changed and not for the better. Anyways we went on a Friday night for dinner. It was not busy but service was slooooooow. \\n\\nThe real issue ultimately lied in how bad the food was. To start we got nachos and the buffalo bombs. The nachos were so bad we actually sent them back. There was hardly any cheese, chips were burnt and ultimately they just totally lacked flavor. The buffalo bombs were the highlight of our meal but were falsely advertised. Rather than having buffalo sauce and cheese I'm pretty confident it was just shredded chicken wrapped in a biscuit. Don't get me wrong, these at least tasted good but weren't what the menu depicts. \\n\\nFor our entrees we got a Caesar salad and the barbacoa quesadilla. The quesadilla was so bad I had to spit my bite out. Yucky meat with zero flavor to it. The salsa inside was so hot it makes your tongue burn and there was a green salsa verde on top covering it like a soup. Whatever you do, don't get this. Caesar salad was meh. Not a fan of the croutons that require you to physically break them in order to eat. \\n\\nAnyways, not for us.

Get it. \\n\\nI found a new hidden gem in the middle of Tucker, GA. Indeed, tucked away in a plaza next to a Family Dollar and a liquor store, this little shop seemed oddly positioned. I was hesitant to try it, but got desperate for food and thought...oh well, at least it's one step up from McDonald's. It was more than that. \\n\\nI walked in and the owners were not even Chinese--they were Nepalese! Now in my experience, shops owned by Asians that do pizza and ethnic food can be interesting. I've had really good Indian food at some of these pizza joints, and this was a Nepalese pizza place serving Chinese food..so, I thought--let's give it a shot. I said, obviously you're not Chinese so feel free to make it Nepalese style or whatever! \\n\\nAnd when I opened my carry out box a few min later, there it was: Nepalized Lo Mein. \\n\\nLook closely at the picture. Instead of your usual veggies, and a greasy Chinese food taste, Nepalized Lo Mein has a distinct flavor. It's primarily spicy, and this is just child's play because the girl at the front desk told me she had the cook tone it down since it's my first time trying them out. It was made with green peppers, diced white meat chicken (fresh, and cut into small chunks), onions, and jalapenos. It was nothing like traditional, Americanized Chinese lo mein. At $8.29 including tax, it was amazing. \\n\\nI saw some other pictures of their meat entrees and it looks WAY better in caliber and presentation than what their store purports to be in this sketchy plaza. Truly a hole in the wall, with a specialty for what I'm going to call: Nepalized American Chinese Food. \\n\\nWe should be fortunate that we live in place where Nepalized Lo Mein can be brought to life.

She did her thing but def went nuts with the pineapple mango salsa to where I almost asked to take some off.

I just ignored her BUT the girl who had made my Bowl made the mistake of feeding off of Amazon woman,,looked at me and said \\"I hope this isn't to go!\\" Wow! Really?? Firstly,,It was to go,,Secondly you should've asked me in the beginning and Thirdly you shouldn't have reacted like that as I was visibly offended. She wanted to wrap the lidless bowl in Saran Wrap lol Ummm,,that OG sauce isn't going to go over well like that. I said \\"It's okay if you smush a lid on top,,\\" so she did but it wouldn't hold. No big deal. I asked if she had a rubber band just trying to help her out. She offered to Saran Wrap the now lidded bowl which was the perfect solution. Another turnoff is that the price went up to $11 per bowl whereas they used to have a choice of 3 scoops for $10 or 5 protein scoops for $14. Wasn't happy about that either. Moving on,,the salmon did NOT taste fresh! At all! I work in a seafood restaurant and this made me nervous. It tasted off today. Big time!

The mushroom soup was amazing, but a bit too much of a kick for me. The three of us had to split it because too much of it made my mouth too hot, and I suggest more mushroom bits (it really helped counter-act to the kick in the soup). The bread dumpling had a surprising flavor; I kind of expected them to be bland but they were honestly the best side dish to have alone. The french fries were also super crispy but light! They were very good, especially with their special ketchup. And lastly the beets were sweeter than any other beets I've had, so it was a nice balance to all the fried things.\\n\\nI suggest people go out of their comfort zone and try something new!

I think that they could've added at least a third option on the appetizer and dessert for a more complete experience that made you want to return as a regular diner. The portion sizes are also a little on the light size, more like gourmet portions.\\n\\nI ordered the Caesar salad off of their magical dining menu, and while it was good, it didn't particularly wow. To make a good Caesar salad is pretty straightforward: lettuce, croutons and a good dressing. In this case they added some flair to it by adding Parmesan, fried capers and crisp prosciutto chips. However, by the server's own admission, they did not use a traditional Caesar dressing. They used something that had a little bit of spice to it with some garlic and Dijon, from what I was told, so I wasn't a fan. The lettuce leaves were also cut very small which I didn't like. \\n\\nFor the entree, I made a request which was seemingly a nonstarter. I ordered the 8 oz Filet Mignon, which came with roasted fingerling potatoes. I asked if I could get mashed potatoes instead and I was told no because it could \\"crash the kitchen\\". I would've had to order a different entree to get the mashed potatoes. I was a little disappointed, but I ordered the filet nonetheless.\\n\\nAlong with the entree, they offer certain steak companions. You can get their truffle lobster, diablo shrimp or jumbo lump crabmeat. It was an extra $17, but their truffle lobster sounded interesting, as it comes with a bearnaise sauce and caviar. Given that I'd never eaten here before, I figured that I'd go the extra mile and give it a shot.\\n\\nWhat I got when the entree arrived was not what I expected to say the least. I don't know if the lobster's muscles had atrophied or if it was on a diet before it got to me, but the lobster was about the size of a shrimp. I received a lobster tail shell with not very much lobster left in it, and you virtually needed a magnifying glass to find the caviar. It was not worth the $17, and given that experience, I'd skip the add ons altogether. Their lobster macaroni and cheese side is delicious, however, and there you can truly feel the influence of the lobster.\\n\\nThe lobster was served on top of my eight oz filet with three or four fingerling potatoes, which once again felt a little light for an entree. They were good snd well prepared, but the portion was small.\\n\\nThe filet itself was well prepared by the kitchen, but the cut of meat didn't particularly wow. It was well seasoned and cooked properly, so it is not the kitchen's fault. It's more about the quality of the cut of meat itself. I feel like I've had better quality cuts at other restaurants, so while it was good, I wasn't wowed.\\n\\nFor dessert, I had their Walnut Turtle Pie. This is a creation that includes chocolate crust, dark creme de cocoa, and caramel sauce. This dessert is choc full of walnuts and is actually pretty good. Their carrot cake, a three layer cake with cream cheese frosting and a dark rum caramel drizzle, is even better. Than one is truly delicious. It's the best thing that I tasted there. Out of the two desserts, I'd order the Carrot Cake, although both are very good.\\n\\nI also had one of their specialty cocktails that had rum mixed with rose wine. It was delicious. Their cocktails are worth trying too.\\n\\nWe also had one peculiar experience just before we left. One of the staff members brought us an offering of dark chocolate truffles as a gift. However, for some reason the gift was limited to only the women at the table. So three people got truffle boxes, and two of us did not. It was a little strange, but we were nonetheless grateful for the gift.\\n\\nOverall, it was a mixed experience that didn't really hit its high point for me until the desserts. The food was good but didn't particularly wow, with the lobster Mac and Cheese and carrot cake being notable exceptions. \\n\\nGiven the variety of options available for a steakhouse experience in the city, it's hard for me to recommend this one over all of the others. You'll have a decent experience, but if you're expecting to be wowed I'd suggest Ruth's Chris or Charley's Steakhouse. It's not terrible, but not at the top of my list either. \\n\\nPhotos of some of the menu items are included below."},{"name":"El Oriental De Cuba","address":"416 Centre St","city":"Jamaica Plain","stars":"4","text":"Had the ham croquettes to start and the chicken breast sandwich, very good!

I've seen the building but had never been here. Came in about 7:30 and the place was mostly empty except for the bar. We were sat right away and our waitress came and took our drink order. About 10 min later she came back and took our food order, we each ordered a cheeseburger pizza. I was very impressed with the drinks, they were both delicious and the pizza was perfectly cooked and very flavorful. I definitely would recommend the food and drinks at this place. I removed stars however because I've never been almost completely ignored by a waitress. After our food was delivered we did not see our waitress again for over 30 minutes. Not once did she check to find out how the food was or if we needed more drinks, our glasses were empty for over 15 minutes. She finally comes back as we're winding down on the pizza, we order an additional drink each and that was the last time we saw her. Another 20 min later, and we're ready to leave....our waitress was nowhere to be seen. After another 5 or so minutes I went up to the bar and had to actually ask for the bartender to get our waitress because we hadn't seen her and were looking to leave. None of this made sense, as we were LITERALLY her only table. The bartender seemed SHOCKED that we had not seen our waitress at all. She comes back out and does not even apologize for the amount of time we had to wait for her. Needless to say we handed her our cards right away because we didn't want to risk waiting another half hour for her to come back.

But I was wowed the moment I stepped in. It's definitely not a run of the mill place with beautifully elegant, and yet earthy artifacts bespoken of the region the restaurant showcases. The food is carefully prepared. Roast Duck is of a different variety than the much better known Peking Duck. It is expensive at $88 and the servings are small---only the skin, and the most tender parts of the lean meat are served, with delicately prepared fixings (the white of baby scallion was shredded uniform and thin as hair, and the wheat wrappers paper thin). There is a fine touch in everything the kitchen does, even the humble vegetables are carefully selected and prepared. This is remarkable as the cuisine in the Shaanxi Yellow Earth Plateau region is as earthy as the landscape. To showcase it with such a delicate touch takes some imagination and a lot of work.

My favorite thing there is spicy pork with garlic. They use large slices of Asian-style roasted pork (you know, the kind that has the pink ring around the outside?) and tons of veggies. Their crab rangoon are a little differently folded, which makes me think they probably make them in house, which is nice. They also throw in a lot of extras, as Julia B. said.

You can taste this all the way from the top cuts of sashimi down to the tried and true spicy tuna. \\n\\nIf you are ever in Alston and want a place that can give you top quality sushi at a reasonable price chek out oppa sushi.

Usually when I call ahead and put it in the special instructions of the reservation, the server is already aware upon approaching me. That's ok. However, for my appetizer, they give me a pile of lettuce and cherry tomatoes with salt sprinkled on top and no dressing, not even oil and vinegar. For my main course I got half a very VERY soggy overcooked flavorless eggplant and some dry, unseasoned beans. Terrible! The worst meal I've ever had at disney world, our hotel's food court and less expensive restaurants such as Prime Time cafe were able to accommodate me WAY BETTER. \\nOn another note, the server we had was really sweet and attentive.

Apparently this restaurant only has a dress code after 5pm. Wish I had known beforehand that I could have shown up sans pants.\\n\\nOkay, all joking aside, this place isn't half bad. Of course that also implies it isn't half good either. And we all know 60% isn't technically a passing grade, despite being considered \\"A-OK\\" by Yelp's standards; so....let's dig into this.\\n\\nLet's start with the things I like: the pricing in comparison with the portion size (like, seriously...you could feed 3 people with the one $13 plate I got). The location, which is conveniently right next to I-93. A big help to out-of-towners like me just passing through. Their chicken wings are actually pretty damn good. The fried rice was...alright. I mean, at least I didn't need to add anymore soy sauce or salt or anything like that. But...OMG...their crab rangoon!! That stuff...was amazing! Ya know how most Chinese buffets feature these rangoon with mostly cream cheese, so it ends up tasting more like a deep fried bagel? Not these. These things tasted mainly of crab meat and I was loving every second of it!\\n\\nWith that, we can talk about some of the anomalies and mishaps I encountered at this place. Like..\\n\\nThe vending machines: why do these exist in a restaurant? Like, it's just...I've never seen a restaurant WHICH SERVES FOOD....feature a vending machine at the front of the restaurant. It was literally the first thing I noticed walking in. Did they....put these here because they were assuming patrons would have an uncomfortably long wait for their table? Or were they offering the Doritos, etc as alternative to the butterflied shrimp? Speaking of which..\\n\\nThe shrimp was bland. I mean, yeah...there was duck sauce and that helped a little bit. But that's not really a good excuse. I've had plenty of shrimp meals in other Chinese places and normally there's at least a HINT of flavor. But these things tasted of nothing. I literally stopped eating after the first piece. However, this wasn't nearly as strange as what I had before that.\\n\\nThe egg drop soup: this is the most bizarre rendition of egg drop soup I've ever had. But that doesn't mean it was all bad. Necessarily. I feel the need to point out how much I enjoyed the extra large pieces of egg whites. However, the broth could have been seasoned a little more. I guess those huge ass pieces of mushroom soaked up what little flavor there was. Yeah...they put mushrooms in their egg drop soup. I just....I don't get it. Is this a thing? Cause....this may be the only thing stranger than having peas in egg drop soup. It didn't hurt the soup or anything. It's just that it didn't help matters either. It just seemed unnecessary.\\n\\nOverall, this place is fine for what it is; but I have a few caveats.\\n\\n1.) Order your plate as if you're planning to feed 3 or more people. The portions here are ridiculously huge and it doesn't matter which plate you order. I saw a picture of their PuPu platter and that thing looked like it could feed a family of six.\\n2.) Read the descriptions of all items you're ordering. If you're allergic to mushrooms, don't get the egg drop soup. Actually, I take it back; I wouldn't recommend this soup to anyone. It's just too frickin' strange for words.\\n3.) Everyone with an affinity for seafood needs to try the crab rangoon. Just...trust me on this. This dish is amazing; like gold in crab form.\\n\\nAaaannnd...yeah....that's about it, I guess. Another okay Chinese/Cantonese restaurant. I dunno why it's so difficult to find consistently excellent Chinese food.

My silverware was taken away after the appetizer and wasn't replaced when my dinner arrived...another server did most of the work to help us so really wanted him to get the tip at the end.

I trolled the pages of yelp looking for the perfect restaurant in which I could explore with my wife and discovered what seemed to be a new gem of culinary adventure. Ox Grill had food that looked eclectic and well made, but we soon discovered that their image was in fact a clever ruse meant to deceive us foodies into eating there. \\nWhen we arrived we noticed that the restaurant was empty saved from an elderly couple that was also bamboozled by the advertisements. We had it explained to us that the chef was a deity of cooking and that all the food was freshly made and prepared in house. Excitedly we ordered a pair of appetizers and an entree from this culinary demi-god. Then we got the bread. Specifically we received Costco French rolls with butter packets  that looked like they were swiped from the hotel breakfast bar. When a restaurant offers $20+ entrees, we expect at least butter served on a plate. We worried, but resigned ourselves that this was complimentary bread. \\nOur appetizers soon arrive a plate of goose liver and octopus which both visually looked excellent. The Octopus was noticeable absent of seasoning  which is a little odd as it is a creature which literally lives in saltwater.  I quickly asked the waiter for some salt which helped but it was still difficult to taste anything but the raw garlic in the dish. The goose liver was also devoid of salt and for some reason was laid on top of Smuckers raspberry jam which definitely overpowered the subtle flavor. The liver was not served with bread or crackers, so we had to order some additional rolls. When they arrived, they were hot on the outside and still frozen in the middle. \\nThe trickery was not over yet as the waiter had not come back with our entree Mofongo with skirt steak. There were a few things that seemed off on the dish as it came out. The Mofongo was still in the mortar. The steak had turned into a stew instead of a nice grilled steak that we are accustomed to in Puerto Rican restaurants. The mashed plantains were dry and unseasoned at the bottom of the mortar. Of course this would happen, since this is not how you're supposed to serve Mofongo. Just to be able to eat part of this dish, we had to scrape it out of the mortar so it looked like an unpleasant mass on the plate. With such a large Puerto Rican population in Orlando, this dish is an insult to locals and Mofongo enthusiasts. \\nWith all these errors we felt that we had to say something. We told the waiter that he absolutely must tell the chef to include salt in his dishes. We felt that there was no way that these dishes were meant to be tasteless masses. When we got our response back it was disappointing. The chef defended his choices saying that some people may have the need for a low sodium diet and that he was catering to those people exclusively. Immediately after that answer, we stopped our efforts in eating the Mofongo mass since there really was no reason to give this chef a chance if they were not looking to correct the dish.

There is a mix of couches, high tops, and regular tables in addition to the bar. I would describe the space as Bohemian/earthy but the music was loud. The tunes machine allows patrons to blast country all night long... They have plenty of tv's to watch the game. Service was very prompt and friendly. They were out of a beer but we enjoyed the Uncle Devil Show and Pepin the Short. The SIP beers are always surprising but delicious. The original SIP location has killer pizzas so we had to try the Midwest Pie. So delicious and cooked to perfection. The server noted all the ingredients are local. They have a broad menu and could afford to have a few more of their beers on tap, but I know they are a small brewery. This is a nice neighborhood watering hole or a stop on a N.

Indeed the best Indian found around Boston nowadays. We were here today for the lunch buffet..a slew of items which were mostly south Indian or even Tamil. Spicing was wonderful..not mild but chilis present but not overwhelming (sloppy cooks throw chilis in which mask other flavors...but that's NOT done here): you could still taste coriander, cumin and other flavors in each dish. You could tell much time and care was taken in the preparation: e.g. the fried onions which are the basis and also the decoration of so many Indian dishes here were carefully carmelized to a sweet brown color in long strings. At home I give up a long time before they get this way (which is how they should be). The ras malai also was remarkable: served and kept warm, with plenty of softened, tender almonds. Most other Indian places serve this cold with nary an almond to be seen. The badam ka halwa was a delicious example of Indian sweet...almonds reduced down for hours in a ghee and sugar mixture. This was so thick and enjoyable! There were two dum preparations: a goat and a chicken biriyani. A stir-fry green bean and onion \\"tindora\\" fry also showed the care that the cooks here take...all very very fried but not soaking in grease and nothing burnt.  There was a gondura dal there as well...a Telugu specialty as gondura leaves are hard to find around Boston. They have a sour taste to them that is combined with other spices to make a rich dal, runny in the southern tradition. There are also idlis and naans.  Much fun for the season are the version of pappadum here...the lentil flour is cooked into stovepipe-like, manicotti-like shapes with a drop or two of color: red, green, yellow which are crisp, salty and fun to eat. Everything except the traditional naan was gluten-free which made my wife very happy. We will be eager to come here again after our next visit to Natick Mall (which is about 10 min north of here up Speen Road)."},{"name":"Suerte","address":"1800 E 6th St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"Food was amazing.

The Tin Shed had initially intrigued me because I searched Yelp for 'organic restaurant', and this place was listed at the top, which... now I find myself a little confused as to why. The website itself made it seem like this place really values the food they put on your plate; \\n\\n\\"At the Tin Shed Garden Cafe we believe that energy travels through food: not just caloric, but spiritual energy. Our goal is to give the food a good ride from farm, to grocer, to the Shed and to you. We pride ourselves on providing only the freshest, most wholesome products. Our beef, chicken and eggs are all free-range. Our coffee is organic, shade-grown and blended to our specifications right here in Portland. Our dairy products are packed locally using no growth-hormones, the salmon is wild... you get the picture.\\" \\n\\nThis plus the Yelp tag of organic, immediately led me to believe that maybe I'd found another small haven; safe from the traditional immune-weakening herbicides and pesticides. I was PUMPED. Of course, it was also early in the morning and I soon caught that the website's only distinction of organic was for the coffee. My husband and I were meeting a friend from out of town there soon, so I wanted to double check that I could eat without suffering the awful consequences that come with tempting the fates of autoimmune reactions. When I called ahead to ask \\"what besides the coffee is organic\\", the man on the phone informed me that that was \\"pretty much it\\", before abruptly hanging up. \\n\\nWhile I was perfectly content sitting and sipping a cup of coffee, the self-serve set up soon confirmed how accurate the man on the phone had been when he said, \\"that was about it.\\" I could have sat through the incredibly burnt coffee taste, had there at least been some sort of organic sweetener or organic dairy-free milk to mask it, but despite going through the effort of obtaining organic coffee, neither the milk, nor the sugar was actually organic. Raw sugar and hormone free milk though; baby steps. To be honest, I laughed out loud at the oddity of that one. It felt not only a little deceitful for anyone looking for an organic drink, but a waste of money as a business and a consumer, to taint organic coffee with inorganic additives. \\n\\nIt was, however, incredibly appreciated that they are so flexible with gluten-free and vegan options, but again- a little strange. Nowhere that we could find on the menu, did it actually offer any transparency as to what the substitutions were or whether it was a cross-contaminated kitchen when it came to their gluten-free options... just that they could do it. Very weird practice. \\n\\nAll of that being said, if I wasn't enlightened to the importance of organic food, not just farm-to-table, this review would be five stars and raving about how much my husband and our friend loved the food. As it turns out, they use tofu egg and a vegan sausage patty to substitute the pork belly and egg in the breakfast burritos, and he actually had to stop to taste the sausage,m separately just to make sure it wasn't meat. It's been a long time since he devoured a breakfast burrito like that, and I would have loved to been able to partake with him and our friend. \\n\\nThe atmosphere was warm and kid-friendly and although the staff seemed a little overwhelmed, they were still friendly enough to tip. The vegan food was so good it had to be double checked (now I'm wondering if the pans are dedicated?). The bathrooms were clean, a changing station was available for the little one, and they even asked if there were any dogs in the party.\\n\\nOverall, the biggest problems were the misleading Yelp tag, the burnt organic black coffee with nothing organic to pair with it, and the lack of transparency on the menu. \\n\\nMy husband really wants to return with our dogs for coffee, so now that I'm aware of their practices, maybe next time I'll just bring my own milk and sugar. Hopefully one day the choice of organic will spread to the rest of the caf√©, because not only does Portland need more places like that, but holy crap, their food looked, smelled and (apparently) tasted so good! \\n\\nSide note for vegans: You cannot escape the smell of pork here. Roasted pig smell is everywhere, especially by and in the bathrooms. Just be prepared. \\n\\nIf smell and possible cross-contamination bothers you, avoid the Tin Shed. \\n\\nIf your body is fine with a $14 inorganic, high cholesterol meal and the overwhelming smell of bacon, bring your dog and eat-up. This is a good place for indulgence."},{"name":"Karl's Sausage Kitchen & European Market","address":"1 Bourbon St","city":"Peabody","stars":"4.5","text":"I have been shopping here for a dozen years and, since they moved from Rte 1 to West Peabody and opened the caf√©, also been a frequent diner.

Also a great place to shop when you are trying to put together a gourmet food basket as a gift for someone.\\n\\nThe only place where you can get genuine Kasseler Rippchen, cut as thick or thin as you want.

I ordered the Margarita as I typically do to judge a \\"new to me\\" Neapolitan joint. The hand formed crust was soft, elastic, tender and fragrant (you can tell time was taken to properly ferment the dough providing great flavor), with just the right amount of scorching. The sauce was definitely San Marzano tomato, simple but perfectly sweet and delicious. The cheese was Bufala Campana (mozzarella DOP), creamy, tangy with an incredible depth of flavor. Finished off with fresh basil and a drizzle of extra virgin olive oil, it was reminiscent of many a good pizza I enjoyed in Italy.

We started with the house-made soft pretzels paired with a whole grain mustard and taleggio-porter fondue.  The pretzels smelled outstanding and tasted great without any help, but both the mustard and the airy, light fondue were simply amazing.  I don't even like mustard (at least, not the standard yellow mustard) but this stuff -- I couldn't stop eating it. The fondue was no different, we could have eaten it all day.\\n\\nFor lunch, I opted for the Po' Boy, which promised to be much more interesting than the name implies with pork belly, oysters, and shrimp all packed into a delicious, crunchy baguette and topped with an apple and parsnip slaw.  The sandwich was flanked by a cup full of truffle fries.\\n\\nThe sandwich was a delicious combination of flavors that, once picked up off the plate, was never set back down.

That's around 13 bucks for Nachos. Anyway this ground beef tasted like they added American hot dog chili. Almost like the chili from the Varsity. Also most plates here are 13 to 15 bucks for dinner entrees. Very overpriced nachos. If you are looking for traditional Mexican food or authentic Mexican food you definitely will not find it here.

I expected something light and delicious, and instead got a basil roll that was full of noodles and almost nothing else.  Also, the entire roll had hardened to a block-like texture, making me think it had sat in the fridge all day.  Would not get this lump of carbs again.\\n\\nThai Coconut Red Curry:  This one is good, and I get it (or the Massaman curry) almost every time I come here.  The veggies are tender, especially the eggplant.  However, last time I had this, the chicken in the dish was fried.  Usually it's not like that, and the fried chicken in a curry experience was not so yummy.  But the curry is so good that I can overlook that.\\n\\nPad Thai:  YUM!  I love the pad thai here, and I haven't found better pad thai in Atlanta.  Having been to Thailand, I would give the authenticity of the dish a 3/5, because it is 90% noodles and 10% good stuff.  In Thailand, its about only 50% noodles.  But the sauce is great and the noodles are prepared properly.  \\n\\nI think Docs has changed ownership recently, because all the employees are new, and they are now playing some sort of salsa music all the time.  Kinda weird in an Asian restaurant.  Some menu items have also changed (I don't think they had the street food section of the menu before).

The first time I went years ago I didn't enjoy it because, like others have mentioned, this is a DIY stir fry place so if you create a crazy concoction and combine a bunch of seasonings and sauces that don't go together (like Alfredo, teriyaki sauce, and buffalo- yuck!), your food won't taste good. This time I researched the website before visiting and decided to start with a fail proof recipe they listed as a base for my meal and then built the rest of my stir fry from there. I based my dinner off with the firecracker shrimp recipe which consists of shrimp,  chilli garlic sauce, lemon, Green onions, carrots, mushrooms & snap peas. I am on a low carb/high protein diet so also added chicken and beef, loaded up on broccoli, bell peppers, onions, and bean sprouts, and added a little salt and pepper and soy sauce. This was AMAZING!!!!! The coolest part is they'll cook whatever you can fit in a bowl, so I had plenty and could have probably had enough for leftovers the next day had it not tasted so good that I devoured it all. The service was great as well and my host was friendly, my server was prompt and on point, and the cooks seemed like they were having a lot of fun. \\n\\nHere's the pros and cons of my visit:\\n\\nPros- \\n1. This place is very inexpensive. My meal was $9.99 for a very hearty serving and if I had paid 13.99 I could've gotten unlimited stir fry bowls along with the salad and soup bar. Also, I was with my son and was very surprised to see the kids stir fry is only 5.99, but you still get the same serving size! \\n2. This place is great especially if you are a picky eater or are on a strict diet. You are able to pick and choose, and can skip what you can't have while also loading up your plate with lots of what you can have. \\n3. This place has brown rice and lettuce wraps!!!!! I don't know how many times I've craved Chinese while dieting but didn't have any because I couldn't have white/fried rice while trying to lose weight. \\n4. Servings are monstrous. 9.99 for a copious amount of whatever you can fit in a bowl is a great deal! \\n\\nCons-\\n1. I only wished they had more leafy green options.

Further, the center filling of the roll is tempura battered that adds extra crunch and good mouth feel. It is definitely worth trying! Also for my visit I tried their assorted aburi sushi platter and the unagi. The aburi platter is surely a glimpse of the calibre of the location, with a tasty house sauce all torched to perfection.

They were big enough that I pulled one out and ate it on its own. The oysters are downright delicious. The sandwich had chipotle mayo and a sweet BBQish sauce on it. I would have enjoyed it more if it had some of that life-changing tartar sauce and maybe a dash of tabasco. The BBQ was too sweet and overpowered the oyster.

The waitress took a while to get there, but finally got there.  She spouted off the drink specials, but honestly, there wasn't really anything special about them.\\n\\nOn the other hand, I was highly excited an impressed of the fact they had Maker's Mark bbq sauce.

I got eye contact, and attitude lots of attitude.  I explained I was charged for my free reward and was told to chose an item from the display case rather than being refunded.  Guess what,  there sat four chocolate chip muffins, the muffins I was told by the same employee there was none available.  \\n\\nI said that I didn't want to pay for a free reward.  After some back and forth because the employee couldn't comprehend why I wouldn't prefer two muffins rather than a refund for my free muffin.  She responded, what you don't want your blueberry muffin.  I responded I'd prefer the chocolate chip muffin I originally requested.  Visibly frustrated the employee stuffed the muffin in a bag and walked back to her chair passing me off to another equal rude employee who pulled my refund change from a drawer and dropped it on the counter in front of me with no words or eye contacts do walked away from me.  I replied thank you and was met with silence.  \\n\\nThese two ladies should not work a customer facing job.  They were extremely rude, surely and lacked basic \\"people kills\\".  I imagine all other customers who came through the drive through and in store tonight received similar horrible customer service.

I went here tonight for the first time and had the WORST customer service experience in my life.\\n\\nI have worked in customer service and the food and coffee industry for years, so I get when people have bad days. I generally try not to fault people for their actions, but tonight I am so appalled, I can't let it go.\\n\\nA friend had told me to check out Palio's and I went there tonight for a nice, quiet study environment. I brought my own dinner with me because I have health-related dietary restrictions, and really thought nothing of it as I haven't had a problem in places before, especially when I explain my restrictions. \\n\\nI got my drink, set up to study, asked again for the wi-fi password, and started eating my dinner. \\n\\nSuddenly, a man came over and yelled at me in the most shockingly rude tone, informing me that I couldn't eat my outside food in his restaurant and if I was hungry, I needed to eat something off of his menu. When I explained that I hadn't seen any menus and didn't know, as it was my first time there, he continued to get more angry and slam a standup menu that listed breakfast items and lunch sandwiches down on the table and walked away. \\n\\nStunned, I took a few minutes and then followed him to ask again for the wi-fi password, since it wasn't working, and to explain that I had never been there before and didn't know about the food. After all, it was advertised as a dessert and espresso cafe. I told him that I had dietary restrictions and that my intention was never to undermine his business. He then continued to address my rudely and went so far as to tell me he had a lawyer and an obvious sign on his door, which I hadn't seen because it's a small panel at the base of the door, below eye-level.\\n\\nIn this world, and especially in a city where there are so many great coffee shops to choose from, how you treat your customers is your livelihood. I understand having a bad day, but when YOUR CUSTOMER is made to felt wrong and uncomfortable in your cafe, and apologizes and tries to explain, but you continue to be rude and raise your voice, you have NO BUSINESS running a business. But because he unfortunately does run this cafe, then Palio's won't get my business or the business of anyone who will listen. There are many other quiet, vegan-friendly, gluten-free friendly coffee shops in Portland.

Tender, earthy, sweet filet of Char pan seared to a perfect medium with exceptionally crispy salt & pepper skin... All this mouthwatering wonderfulness sits atop a silky smooth honeyed yellow turnip pur√©e... The pur√©e is complimented with saut√©ed wild mushrooms & fris√©e to highlight the natural earth in the fish...

They are very family friendly.  Actually, they are just plain friendly.  We've never had a problem with the food or the staff.  The food did go downhill for a little bit, but they must have fired the cook responsible and gotten a new one because the food is back to being consistently good.\\n\\nWe've only had one problem there, and it was more due to another couple and a very young and inexperienced hostess.  We have a family of four.  We were there before a young mid 20's couple came in.  The couple decided they didn't want to wait and so got food to go.  As they were walking back by, 6 seats opened up at the end of one of the tables.  The couple decided to help themselves to the seats.  Not the 2 at the end, but the 2 in the middle, effectively blocking us from getting the block of 4 seats.  The hostess had only been there for 2 weeks, and wasn't equipped to handle the situation.  We were just irritated about the whole situation and were about to leave.\\n\\nThe hostess told the manager about the problem, and she quickly approached us and was extremely apologetic.  She definitely made things right and was very nice and very accommodating.  She did not yell at the hostess but instead used it as a training lesson.

If we had only driven about a half mile or so south, we would have had even more fun experiences at the absolutely wonderful Vanbarrys.\\n\\nWe have stopped in at Vanbarry's several times over the past few months. The restaurant is located in its own standalone area across from Lake Jennie Jewel. Due to the crowds that constantly hit up this place, it can be a little difficult to find parking. Fortunately, Vanbarry's offers a complimentary valet.\\n\\nAfter parking your car, you walk up to the restaurant (btw: it's dog friendly) and encounter a huge open patio, a random swan boat (I think it was decommissioned from Lake Eola), a large connect 4 game, and an open fire pit. Often playing in the corner of the open patio is a live musician (this location is big into music). While a little loud at times, the music helps add to the appeal of the location. \\n\\nOnce you get seated at a table (the inside is just as huge and open), a server comes up and drops off a container of pickles (weird, but it works) and takes your drink order. Vanbarry's has a full bar and a huge selection of beers. When we are normally waiting for our drinks, we also go grab one of the hundred or so board games that they put out for people to play. This place also apparently has a great happy hour and brunch that I haven't tried yet, so there is various ways to come here and have a good time. \\n\\nThe two dishes that I most often get are the shrimp poboy and the walnut and cranberry salad (I switch out the chicken for Mahi). The poboy is absolutely fantastic, and the salad is huge and delicious. Aside from tasting great, this place also prices its menu so that, when tax is included, your entree comes out to an even number (i.e. $9.00, $12.00), which makes tipping easy for something like lunch when you aren't ordering alcohol.\\n\\nOverall, Vanbarry's is a uniquely fantastic restaurant with tons to do and a great menu.

Best soft pretzels this side of Philly and I loved both the dips that accompanied them.

In fact our table ordered an extra side!\\n\\nOn the salad side the spinach salad was composed with some wonderful elements but someone unfortunately dumped way too much salad dressing on the plate.  When you are serving such fresh spinach with great cheeses etc you just don't need that much dressing.  Getting the dressing on the side is not my preference, I like the salad to be tossed in the dressing and in this quality of restaurant the chef should not have the heavy hand of an adolescent boy!  The asparagus tart/salad was rich and creamy, again too much dressing on the salad portion but enough on that.\\n\\nAhhh, after those great appetizers I was really looking forward to my choice of leg of lamb.  It was promised to be tender and cooked  medium.  The lamb comes from Nimon Ranch, a well known gourmet producer.  My 'Ahhh' quickly turned to 'Hmmm'.   The meat was cooked rare not medium, it was salty and it was not tender.  Now I love lamb and I cook it at home and I can produce a better tasting meal with my supermarket variety.  There were large sinews left in the piece that I had and I could have overlooked that if it wasn't just so salty and raw. My friends cleaned there plates and raved about the Halibut and the strip steak served with a chard gratin.\\n\\nNow believe it or not we had room for dessert and again I got to taste 3 of the offerings.  The Pigs tails are delish.  Served with the best hot fudge sauce I've ever eaten, you're encouraged to double and triple dip these tasty creations, oh yeah!  And for lovers of thin mints cookies go for the chocolate-mint semi freddo.  A whipped soft ice cream served with a chocolate mint wafer and chocolate strips, you won't regret ordering this until you have to run a couple extra miles the next day.

With many MANY options to choose from, however, I usually find myself drawn to the spicy Indian aromas wafting out of Curry 2U.\\n\\nWarning, this place is not for the non-spicy-food lover.  Unless, of course, you're hankering for a bowl of plain basmati and/or a slice of house-made naan.  But if you like the feeling of your eyes watering and your nose running after one bite of Chicken Vindaloo, look no farther.  Served in a spicy red sauce with chicken so tender it practically melts in your mouth, be sure to ask for a bottle of cold water 'cuz you're gonna need it (not to mention a few extra napkins to wipe the sweat off your brow).  Their vegetarian dishes look delicious, too - including a medley of chickpeas and spinach that I will definitely be trying on my next visit.

We were seated immediately and the interior of the restaurant was clean and modern, with a view of people folding dumplings at the front. \\n\\nWe decided on a shanghai fried noodle, an egg-scallion breakfast wrap, and the shrimp, scallop, and pork XLB. The shanghai fried noodle was the first to come and it was a very generous portion. It was loaded with tender pork and a good amount of cabbage. The noodles were a little too mushy for my taste, but nonetheless, a great dish to order. We also ordered the XLB, which were smaller than Ding Tai Fung's. The flavor, however, was amazing; I could definitely taste the seafood aroma of the inside. However, they came room temperature instead of steaming hot, so there wasn't a lot of soup. The egg-scallion wrap was nothing special; it tasted store bought, but it reminded me of childhood. \\n\\nOverall a great place for asian food!

The soup was also very diluted in a very large bowl. No one checked on us. When it was time to pay, I was told the tip was automatically added to our bill as we were a large group (2 adults, 3 kids) and my parents table was next to ours (they were paying separately) At this time I told the young man at the cash register that our soup was not proportioned evenly as only 1 soup contained what all three should've, although he did apologize and said he would let the kitchen know, no attempt was made to compensate for that, and still automatically billed me a tip for the amount chosen by them (which should be optional in a similar situation).

We went back a few days ago, now open almost 4 weeks and indeed, some chefs have reduced their offerings, too time consuming for the chocolate souffl√© at Confit for instance. A surprise also was the number of items at Tierra, the Mexican place, that have peanuts in all the salsas but one, though his guacamole is peanut free and a terrific rendition.\\n\\nThe lower level of staffing is most noticeable on table cleanup. A manager in a suit finally took away our table's accumulated plates as we had moved on to a couple of dessert items amid the debris. We still haven't found the sweet spot (literally) that we were hoping for but there are some choices beyond the Patisserie, though not many. The Hall is such a nice place that I sure hope they don't lower themselves to requiring self bussing because then they will lose us. At those food prices I will not do that. Most of the staffing at most of the stalls were friendly and knowledgeable. A few were less so but a bit understaffed and therefore brusque, I think. \\n\\nOur very favorite meal choice this evening was from Ginger Pig. The Char Siu was perfectly spiced, tender, hot (spicy) but not too hot for me and an ample portion to share. I would definitely order it another time and also try other of their menu items.  The African menu at Jacaranda is next for us. And the rice pudding at Eridu, the grains menu stall will be another dessert taste.\\n\\nThe other thing we noticed this time is that the stadium step seats with the throw pillows on the back wall seem to have turned into a giant multi-level phone booth!"},{"name":"Palio Dessert & Espresso House","address":"1996 SE Ladd Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"3","text":"When I first found this place I was so excited!

About two weeks after I first started going, I went there with my husband and we settled in to study. I bought a horchata for us to share, and asked if I could have an internet password for my husband to use and the man behind the counter told me no, only paying customers were allowed to use the internet. I thought that was strange since we had been here together before and hadn't had any problems buying stuff to share but I just figured whatever this guy has a chip on his shoulder, I'll just go back to studying and if I need the internet I will use my husband's computer. I returned to our table and we began studying, but after about 15 minutes one of the baristas came to our table and asked us what she could get us. I smiled and said we were good, and she replied that all customers had to buy something. I glanced at the man sitting at the next table over, who had come in about 10 minutes earlier to meet his friend-and had not bought anything- raising my eyebrows.

The red velvet was rich and creamy and paired with the most incredible cream cheese frosting that couldn't have been smoother.   The Cobbler was one that I admit, was the least excited for out of the three, but was not let down.

I was hesitant at first of ordering it because most steak tacos I am generally not a fan of - but I love mushrooms.  This taco surprised me, the steak is extremely good quality and quantity as well. The mushrooms, thick cut - so this is a very hearty taco.

The flavors are outstanding though and I will be ordering this one again for sure.\\n\\n#16 Fish n' chips: I love fish tacos and so far, I really enjoy tacos from here so I figured, I will love this taco.  Well, I like this taco but it is not one my favorites.  The fish is delicious and a nice thick piece of it.  The fries are very thin which is fine with me as I am not a big french fry fan and the description read malted - I do not get the malted taste though. The curry mayo was ok, but I am not a big curry fan. Something was missing flavor wise for me on this one, I believe it needs a bit more acidity.  But I can understand why there are soo many good reviews about this taco - I guess it is just personal taste buds.\\n\\nThe salsa I got this time around was different from my first time trying this place.

I know the food is worthy of more stars. So maybe I'll go back at some point and have a better time. \\n\\nWhat we have here is a failure to communicate. \\n\\nI was completely ready to give Ravenous Pig 5 stars before I even walked in the building. I'm talking about all the hype, awards, friends recommendations and the menu told me before I even stepped into this establishment that I was going to give it a 5 star review. \\n\\nIt's been billed as the best restaurant in Orlando, the place visitors want to visit when they don't want to feel like tourist and what some say is undoubtedly the best meal in Orlando. \\n\\nI've taken a lot of time to think about this and while I expect and suspect that this place is a 5 star place my experience there was only a 2 star. \\n\\nand right now I'm willing to admit our mistakes if the Ravenous Pig owns up to theirs. \\n\\nSo the story started when a birthday dinner came up and I had mentioned maybe Ravenous Pig would be cool.My husband called them and said it was my birthday and they told him that they had a chef's table with a view of the kitchen. \\n\\nMy husband and I have been to a chef's table before and while it sounded different my husband reserved it. \\n\\nOkay here is where I admit my mistake. We may have made the reservations not far enough in advance due to work issues. But if someone calls you and says My wife's birthday and our wedding anniversary are this weekend we'd like to reserve, and you tell them that you have a chefs table for them, if it's not a real chef's table you should tell them so. \\n\\nWe've never been there previously to know what she meant. But what she meant was a counter that mimics a bar but without the bar, but with a square window of the action of the chefs.\\n\\nSo We get there, and the hostess is just not very pleasant, she asked us to wait a while. I ask for the bathroom and she sends me to the handicap bathroom. Someone is in it and I wait a few minutes. I look over and my husband is no longer waiting, so I decide to go find if he's been seated. \\n\\nI ask and no one helps me. I am maneuvering though a restaurant I've never been to and the staff is no help. I'm looking for this \\"so called chefs table\\", I ask more staff and finally I see my husband coming to over. He brings me to the bar top over looking the restaurant kitchen.\\n\\nFor a while we were ignored and only given a beer menu, in which they were both out of the beers we wanted. We opted for the second choice, no problem there. It took a bit to get our beers. \\n\\nIt was my birthday and my wedding anniversary was the next day and we felt so ignored. We wanted some drinks but were never attended to. Over 2 and a half hours We only got 2 drinks a piece, and we had to flag them down for the second one.\\n\\nI went to the bathroom but found out that the other bathrooms, are only one a piece. 1 female bathroom stall and one male stall. So there is a long wait.\\n\\nI know dive bars that have more stalls in the bathroom than this. and I have to wait. \\n\\nWhen I finally get in there to the one bathroom stall, I start to cry. \\n\\nMy husband went though all of this trouble to reserve what he thought was going to be an awesome night, and yet we were not having an awesome time. I didn't want him to know so I sucked it up dabbed my eyes and came out smiling. \\n\\nMy husband agreed with me about the service, the way we were treated was just not good at all. With our Anniversary the next day we lamented about how we eloped in NYC and how the NYC restaurants in Manhattan and surrounding areas have been amazing to us at last moment.\\n\\nI shouldn't cry on my birthday, ever. EVER! \\n\\nAfter reliving all of this emotion; Below is the good and bads. \\n\\nGreat:\\n\\n1. Tuna Tar Tar - amazing, plating was cool it was fresh, clean, and I loved the way the tuna played with the supporting cast. \\n\\n2. Duck Entree - my husband ordered it and loved it. I had some of it and loved it. \\n\\nGood : \\nSalmon with the Apple Slaw - it was good but not spectacular. \\n\\nGruyere Biscuits - not wowed, didn't get it. \\n\\nTruffle Fries - great fries but didn't get any truffle flavor. I'd just take the word \\"truffle\\" off \\n\\nBad:\\n\\nOnly has 1 male, 1 female, and 1 handicap bathroom.  \\n\\nHostess was not helpful, not pleasant, and kinda pissy\\n\\nServer at what they call \\"chef table\\" was nice but not present most of the time\\n\\nI like to drink, but yet in 2.5 hours I was only able to get 2 drinks, and to get my second I had to flag someone down. who flag some one else down, who flagged someone else down. \\n\\nDessert - which my husband already told them when he made the reservations. - Yep they forgot and gave me something which was okay but totally last minute, which made me cry again and not happy tears. \\n\\nNever go here for a special occasion.

It was prepared differently than any other amandine I have eaten as it was crusted with a few slivered almonds on top. They then put it in a citrus beurre Blanc that Wasn't needed. I would have preferred a squeeze of lemon. The fish was prepared well though and was moist. The risotto was ok more like rice with vegetables. The medley was nice and I actually mixed in the vegetables with the risotto. The biggest issue we had was with the service as it took a half an hour after our leftovers were boxed to even get our check with our server running around.

The noodles were over cooked and the broth tasted like msg.  Usually a good pho broth makes you want more and more, not this broth...it was strange.....there was this taste that was off putting, I know now that it is msg.  It has been 45 minutes since I finished my pho and my mouth is dry and I am dying for water and I had a full glass there. \\n\\n2 good things about this restaurant. \\n\\n#1 The service is above average.  I have never had a pho restaurant ask me if I wanted more sprouts. \\n\\n#2 There is more meat offered in their pho than other places, but then again you are paying about $3.00 more compared to other places. \\n\\nOne thing that annoyed me was the Chinese spoon they offer.  All other pho restaurants offer bigger spoons or a spoon that hooks onto the bowl.  Every time I put my spoon in my bowl it fell into the soup.  This has never happened to me before.  After the 3 rd time I was like wtf and realized this spoon is not suitable for eating pho. \\n\\nJust another forgettable pho restaurant that I will not be returning to, there was nothing good about the pho that makes me want to come back. \\n\\nOne of my pet peeves is when a restaurant boost their ratings with fake reviews and pictures from friends and family members, this place obviously does that.  Karmas a bitch and it will come bite you in the ass. \\n\\nWhite Lotus in Burnaby is my go to for pho in Burnaby.  They got a 5 out of 5 stars from me, well worth the drive."},{"name":"Random Order Pie Bar","address":"1800 NE Alberta St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"So good I couldn't wait to snap a photo and had to eat my muffin!

Guests were coming from all over New England so I really wanted to make sure that the restaurant was a local establishment with a variety of food options (vegetarian, gluten free, etc) and drinks at a reasonable price. I would hate for them to end their trip to Boston with a bad meal!\\n\\nFive Horses Tavern fit the criteria and exceeded my expectations! Our server, Nathan, was totally accommodating to our rather large group. He was also very knowledgeable of the menu and offered some good suggestions from the extensive list of drinks. The beer flight is a great option at only $14 for 4 tastings.\\n\\nI had the pizza with apple and brie- it was the perfect mix of sweet and savory. The crust was thin and each of the flavors complemented each other well. I also shared the fish sandwich and tater tots with a friend. The sandwich was delicious- you could tell that the fish was fresh and the batter on it was not heavy at all. The salsa with it was a refreshing touch. The tater tots were the best I've ever had too (that's even compared to Wahlburgers tots). Super crispy on the outside and fluffy on this inside. \\n\\nEveryone was pleased with their experience as well. The portions were also the perfect size- I felt like I was getting my money's worth.The meatloaf entree looked amazing. Another guest basically wanted to put the cheese sauce, which came with her fresh pretzel appetizer, on everything! \\n\\nAll in all, we could not have asked for a better experience. I absolutely recommend Five Horses Tavern!"},{"name":"Junior Colombian Burger - South Kirkman Road","address":"5389 S Kirkman Rd, Ste 105","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"Placed an order for pickup & this is what I receive ...

The 3 stars is for the hit or miss service. I would recommend going during the week when they are less busy if you want excellent service. The first time I went was on a Wednesday and my table received so much attention from our waiter (ask for Anthony- he was fantastic). The second time I went was on a Saturday and I had to grab random servers to put in orders and ask for suggestions because our waiter (Samuel) was nowhere to be found. This may not have been his fault- he may have had too many tables- but this is not an acceptable level of service for this caliber of restaurant (or a $300 meal). \\n\\nAs for the food, items I would recommend: \\n\\nCrispy tuna taco \\nSuadero tacos \\nEl governator taquitos\\nCarne asada\\nCreamed kale (OMG- so good)\\n\\nThe drinks were also very tasty. They may just be getting to popular to maintain a high level of service so I will probably wait to go back until those kinks are worked out."},{"name":"The Bay Moorings","address":"6330 Bay St","city":"West Vancouver","stars":"2.5","text":"DON'T EAT HERE!  Go to the Boathouse or Olive & Anchor instead.  If this restaurant is dead on a sunny Saturday night in August then you know there is a problem.  We had a nice server for our table of 15 for my MIL's 60th birthday.  However when I ordered the scallops she failed to ask if I wanted the appy or main.  Since nobody else ordered an appetizer one would be right to conclude, or confirm, that I wanted the main.  I ad no idea there was a scallop appetizer.  \\n\\nWhen the bill came, we were curiously not given the breakdown, just the total.  After paying and then asking for the itemized bill, we discovered we were charged for both the scallop appy and main!!!!!  They brought the main out after they forgot it.  Most restaurants would have comp'd the whole thing and yet they double charged and tried to HIDE IT!  I couldn't eat both and had most of the main left over.  They opted to take off only the appy at $15 instead of the main at $27 which wasn't even worth that in quality.\\n\\nThis restaurant needs to be on Gordon Ramsay's restaurant nightmares!  Nobody knows what they are doing, food is only so so, and it's got bad management/ownership - who were both onsite and fought us on this!  Really???!!!!\\n\\nNote to the owners - short sighted bad mistake!  You f'd up, own up to it.  We had a big table of 16, spent lots of money, and will never return. Such an opportunity lost!  We eat at Horseshoe Bay all the time!  I have no doubt you will no longer be in business in a few months. \\n\\nThis is NOT how you run a successful restaurant!    I suggest you read \\"The Nordstrom Way\\" and re-structure your business in order to succeed.  It is possible.  Hire a better chef, train staff, be involved and own up when you or your staff make a mistake.  This is not rocket science, it is good cooking, good staff and respect for customers!  Take this advice and turn this restaurant around.  Go to Hawksworth for dinner to see how it's done.
