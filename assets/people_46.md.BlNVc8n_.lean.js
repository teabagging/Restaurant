My personal favorite still is the daal ($5.95 for a container of rice and a container of daal) or lamb biryani ($10.95 for enough lamb biryani to satisfy me for 2 full meals) simply because they are very consistent, large portions, and very reasonably-priced. Generally speaking, anything you get will be under $12, so this place is definitely a good value.\\n\\nI have been disappointed a couple of times by what I've ordered - I once got the fish masala and it was only okay. The fish was breaded then fried then put in the curry, so it was a little bit of a soggy situation. Flavor was good, but the texture just left a little to be desired. The second time was with the anda paneer, which is a southern Indian curry with hard boiled eggs in it. The eggs weren't peeled super carefully and my curry unfortunately had some shell in it.

Apparently, so I feel bad asking for them to switch it to a margarita. This is my second time here so I had to keep reminding myself that the good thing about this place is the food, that was the only thing still keeping us there. Appetizer and entrees were delicious. We had our food boxed and continued waiting until we caught her attention for the check, which of course still had the original rubbing alcohol charge. No surprise there. We \\"reminded\\" her and she had it removed. Every interaction with our server was very awkward and had us second guessing ourselves wondering if we did something wrong?

My partner and I were looking for a place that had Chicken & Dumplings. Mother's came up and we looked at it. We said, that's the place to go. Well, little did we know how fabulous it was! I had read the reviews here and most of them were great. But I have to say this is THE best place I have ever been to in Portland, EVER! So good! My partner & I decided to go there for dinner, lunch AND breakfast! \\n\\nThe first day we went to was for dinner. My partner started off with the roasted portabella mushrooms, they were succulent and delicious. I started off with the Matzo ball soup, which I had never had. DELISH! They brought out the bread, it turned out to be biscuits. They felt heavy and I was leery, but they were so light and airy. I knew at that time that my breakfast (Biscuits & Gravy) on the 3rd day would be  fantastic! So I had the Signature Pot Roast, and my partner had the Chicken & Dumplings. Both were out of this world. My beef was so tender, and I could taste the red wine in the gravy, so delicious! The mashed potatoes were skin-on (the way it should be, as far as I am concerned) were fantastic. But the thing that excited me was the side of broccoli, it was a pleasant surprise! Usually you get side vegetables at most places and they are meh. These were perfectly al dente, and so garlicky good! YUM! For me it was all in the details at this place. SO good! So as a plus, the owner and lead chef was there, Lisa Schroeder, she was walking around to all the tables and came across ours. Ted and I gushed over the food and the restaurant. She was so pleased and said, \\" I cook with love!\\" I said, \\"That's what it is all about!\\" Have a passion for cooking and loving what you do. My partner, Ted, said, \\"This is as good as my grandmother's\\" and she was filled with delight. What a sweet woman! She took our pics and posted them on facebook and as soon as we got home, we checked and sure enough, there Ted was. What a great experience!\\n\\nThe next day, we went there for lunch, now this is where I was slightly disappointed. I had the beef burger with bacon and Jack cheese and fries. The burger was excellent, don't get me wrong. I have had a lot of burgers in my life and this was NOT the tops. The fries were a bit disappointing too. They were sliced too thin and where hard to pick up with your hands so contrary to my beliefs, I had to eat them with a fork! Shocking, I know! My partner had a salad and the cheddar mac and cheese. This is how mac and cheese should be made. So saucy and cheesy. Then surprise, surprise, here came Lisa again and she saw us and asked us if we had checked facebook, she was so happy to see us again. She made you feel like you were home. Well, then Ted decided to buy her cookbook, which she was selling up front. We asked her to sign it and she graciously did. The book is called Mother's best and she has recipes including what's on the menu. I am so excited to try it out. \\n\\nSo on to day 3 of our Mother's excursion. Breakfast is a busy time here. So, we ordered the biscuits and gravy. Now this time, I have to say, they were awesome but still not the best I have had. Got 2 Apple Struedel (enjoyed at home). We saw Lisa on our way out and she again thanked us for coming. We told her we would be taking a little hiatus from Mother's to digest all the food we ate there.\\n\\nOverall, Mother's is a place I would send anyone. It is a nice atmosphere and beautiful interior. Nothing fancy, just homey. The chef/owner is genuine and friendly. This place is someplace I could go to every day if I could afford it.

You order and pay up front, and your food is then delivered to your table (reminded me of Pei Wei,if you've had that!).  Drinks are self serve fountain style.  \\n\\nThe space/interior was very interesting, I thought it was really cool that you could see inside the kitchen/prep area while your food was being prepared.\\n\\nSo far, you're probably thinking that this is 5/5 review.  It was close, but unfortunately fell short.  This isn't the fault of the servers, or the food itself.  The problem is the price.  I understand organic/gluten free/whatever hipster ingredients are used, but 17 dollars for a fish sandwich and a small amount of slaw?  Not cool, no matter how good the sandwich is.  I think the Pad Thai was 14-15 dollars?  It was good, yes, but I can order take out Pad Thai for 7.50 that is just as good, and with a larger serving so I'd have meals for the next day or two.\\n\\nThe food was great.  The price was not.

Needless to say, we were excited to try their 5 star rated bbq (as rated by Full Custom Gospel BBQ) despite its \\"Fancy BBQ title\\". \\n\\nService: \\nOur waitress was a bit sassy and seemed to not care much about service as her natural red hair got most of her attention.  She knew we were first-timers at the restaurant and didn't offer to enlighten us about the menu.  \\nMid-way through our appetizer, my girlfriend gasped and flicked something off of my shoulder.  It was a cockroach. She flicked it on the empty booth next to us and she was completely grossed out.  I didn't care too much until about thirty seconds later when an unidentified guy approached our table and asked us if we could move over booths (we were sitting in the middle booth and he wanted to fit a larger party in our booth and the one next to us). No biggie for me but it was the booth where my girlfriend flicked the cockroach into! You gotta be kidding me. My girl friend explained what just happened but neither he or our conceited little red-headed fairy waitress seem to care.  Okie dokie, we moved.  My girlfriend lost her appetite and was constantly looking around to see if the cockroach was anywhere in sight and it made the experience uncomfortable.  The upside is that they discounted our bill for asking us to move tables but never once mentioned the fact that there was a cockroach crawling on my fricken back.\\n\\n\\nFood:\\nWe ordered the chips and queso, oak smoked ribs, oak smoked brisket and a side of mac and cheese.\\n\\nChips and Queso: 3 stars.  You would do much better at the Roaring Fork as a \\"fancy restaurant\\" chips and queso comparison.\\n\\nOak smoked ribs: 3 stars for taste and tenderness, 1 star for quantity.  \\nVery tasty, slightly sweet and savory with good caramelization but perhaps a tad overcooked as the meat fell off the bone a little too easy and the meat was kind of dried out.... the ribs were probably sitting for awhile and they reheated them.  \\nOkay C'MON 3 pork spare ribs for 18$?!!! F-that!\\n\\nOak smoked brisket: 4 stars for taste and tenderness, 0 stars for quantity. \\nVery tasty, more savory than sweet here.  Decent amount of smoke throughout, nice sugar cookie, just the right amount of fat.  \\nOkay C'MON a half a slice of brisket for 18$?!!! F-THAT!\\n\\nMac and Cheese:  3 stars for flavor, presentation and quantity.  \\nGood mac and cheese without any processed cheese off-flavors.  It was okay, its mac and cheese, how can you f-that up? The portions are for two-people exactly and for 7$ for any of their sides, its a deal.\\n\\nSummary:\\n\\nI think the service sucks, I think there is a MAJOR disconnect between menu prices;  How do you charge 18$ for three little ribs but only 7$ for a side dish (which they tell you to order because the side dish that comes with the fancy bbq plate is crap)?  Bottom line, I won't go back.  They would have gotten 4 stars if the service was better and the quantity of food was commensurate with the price.  ITS BBQ M'thr'fkr!

The lines at Modern are much shorter than the lines at Mike's, at least that was the case when I visited Saturday night. The offerings seem about the same, but I really like how Modern has their whole menu up on the wall so you don't really have to wander the whole shop to see what costs what like you have to with Mike's. \\n\\nI don't like cannolis, so I decided to grab a lobster tail and a vanilla cupcake. The lobster seemed about the same size as the ones from Mike's, and it's a full dollar cheaper. (I could be misremembering the size of Mike's tail. Either way, the difference wasn't noticeable to me.) It's a lot crispier than the one at Mike's, and the filling is less of a cream and more resembles a custard. I really liked it, although my only complaint was that the dough closer to the inside of the pastry was a little too doughy for my liking.

My Key Lime Margarita was rich and thick, almost as if you had pureed a piece of key lime pie and added the liquor to it. The Bollywood Bazaar had a hibiscus in it. They offer a nice selection of beers and wines by the bottle or glass as well. The kids in our group ordered mango lassis. These were very deep in color, again with intense flavor. And your Yelp check-in gets you a complimentary non-alcoholic drink, so consider a lassi.\\n\\nI was already satisfied just with the pappadam and the delicious tamarind sauce. We passed on appetizers, but everything about the entrees was wonderful. The vegetables in the vegetable korma were fresh and varied, in a creamy sauce worth dipping the perfectly prepared garlic naan into. The lamb in the lamb saag was just about perfect; the lamb was quite tender, and there was very little fat. The rice is aromatic.  We didn't have room for dessert, but they brought us a dish of complimentary mango ice cream. This felt more like frozen mango lassi, but it was still quite good, and it was a nice finish to the meal.\\n\\nI so want to get here for the lunch buffet!"},{"name":"Lee's Bakery","address":"4005 Buford Hwy NE, Ste C","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"OK Vietnamese food.

However, after 5 and half months later I came back to this restaurant I did not even have to mention what all I wanted. The guy there exactly remembered what I wanted. He just told me that he would get it ready for me if I was going to order the sandwich. Well, Pho with us has really great staff and great service for sure. The food is great too.

Call me not Texan, but I personally do not like when the fat overpowers the flavor of the meat as a whole, so this was perfect for me.\\n\\nThe pulled pork was good as well and paired well with the 3 sauces Lambert's provides. (side note on the sauces- the spicy one is in fact spicy).\\n\\nThe crust on the mac and cheese was just the right amount of crisp, and the mac and cheese underneath was very cheesy. Wasn't my favorite mac and cheese but I still finished it all up.\\n\\nThe broccoli with jalapenos does in fact have jalapenos - every other bite was SPICY, but good thing I like spice. Wouldn't necessarily recommend to someone who has ad adversion to spice.\\n\\nThe beans were good but definitely were more ranchero/pinto bean type style rather than your traditional baked beans. Still had a good flavor though.\\n\\nThe pickles were delicious! Very sweet, just the way I like em.\\n\\nI wish we had explored the upstairs but we didn't get a chance to.

Sadly.\\n\\nLet's start with the soups. DO NOT, I repeat, DO NOT get the Lemon Chicken Rice Soup. It sounds like it would be fantastic; that combination of ingredients is light and perfect, and should just be so satisfying. It tastes like nothing. It's like water...zero flavor. But it's freakier than water, because then you're left chewing on things (chicken, rice) but your tongue isn't registering a flavor...not awesome. Also, we're in the great city of Boston here...save yourself some disappointment and don't get the chowder. Not good. Their chili and lentil soup is decent - again, nothing I'd write home about, but it's the safest bet out of their soups.\\n\\nSo their salads, which used to be my saving grace: You'd think that a cafe would use fresh ingredients daily, or even *close* to daily...right? Not the case here. It seems as though they must use vegetables and meat that is at least a few days old in these salads. One day in particular, 2 of my coworkers got meatless salads and they both felt extremely nauseous afterwards and for the rest of the day. A lot of their vegetables looked pretty questionable, but their tomatoes were straight up disgusting. I got a salad with turkey on it that day, and I ended up just saving it for dinner/next day's lunch. When I opened it to eat later on, the turkey was so slimy (sign of bad meat), it smelled a little off, and then I finally went in to try a small bite and it was unquestionably no longer good. My avocado, tomatoes, and cucumbers were also in horrible shape, just like my coworkers'.\\n\\nBeyond that, I've only had their rollups. They aren't awesome either, a little bit bland (maybe that's a common theme), but they aren't bad by any means. They get the job done I guess. They ARE, however, huge and could either last you a couple of meals or make you extremely full, depending on how much you can eat.\\n\\nThe one part about Bits & Bites that I do truly really enjoy are their smoothies. Granted, I don't think I've ever had a smoothie I didn't enjoy, but I'm a fan.

Actually, cannolo vs. cannoli. Cannolo is the singular form of cannoli. Now, according to the Mike's Pastry site, there are 4 components to Mike's cannolo:\\n1) Homemade filling commonly made of  ricotta cheese, yellow and chocolate cream\\n2) Crunchy handmade shell \\n3) Chocolate chips\\n4) Powdered sugar\\n\\nWe arrived before the lunch rush on a weekday and found little to no line so we made our way to the counter. You can't really help it when your eyes widen and you start to drool a little as you scope out the options. Then a hint of panic sets in as you realize the sassy girl behind the counter wants you to make a decision already [hashtag libra problems]. One of the ladies was trafficking the tables since there were more bodies than seats and was able to get a table for us. There are only a few tables inside the bakery, so it may just be luck if you are able to snag one. \\n\\nWe decided on an espresso cannolo for here and pistachio and amaretto cannoli to go. The espresso cannoli wasn't impressive and we honestly left a little disappointed. I'm not sure what it was about it, possibly an overdone coffee flavor that erred on tasting artificial. The size of the cannoli is very shareable. \\n\\nWe carried our white box with the string on the rest of our travels that day and even on to the airplane. There were numerous bribes and offers made to take this white box from us, but none accepted. \\n\\nOur to-go cannoli became our mid-flight snack later that day and that's when we were made believers of Mike and his pastries. Pistachio never fails me and this one was delicious. The amaretto also was a tale of almond perfection. Both the pistachio and amaretto had distinct flavors without being overly sweet. And mind you, these cannoli had been walking around Boston all day and didn't have a perfectly crunchy shell.\\n\\nI can't give any comparisons with the cannoli competitors, but Mike's Pastry did a fine job filling my sweet cravings.

From the moment I walked in, I was warmly greeted by a friendly staff who was eager and happy to take my order.\\n\\nI ordered a dozen donuts - don't worry  I was going to share :).  Flavors consist of salt and honey plus cinnamon and sugar daily.  Sunday's after after 4 PM the rest of the day, a nutella hazelnut chocolate sauce is available for a little extra charge.  I decided to get 4 donuts of each flavor to try.  My bill came to be about $6 which I was thought was a reasonable price for the quality and quantity.  I got to see the magic unfold in my eyes as the staff cooked the donuts to order.  A few minutes later, my name was called and I was surprised by the speed and efficiency.  \\n\\nI rushed to the theater to start my volunteer shift just in the nick of time.  The staff was happy I brought some fresh donuts to start the day.  After we got our coffee fix, we indulged in the donut goodness.  They were still warm and moist with little dryness.   They almost melted in my mouth with each bite.  The nutella hazel nut chocolate sauce had just the right amount topped in the donut.  The hint of sugar and salt balanced out the sweetness for the other donuts.  We all agreed these were probably the best and simplistic donuts we have had in a long time.   \\n\\nI visited again recently and got the same results.  The donuts maintained their quality, consistency, and balance of sweet and salt.  The staff is at top of their game and makes sure everyone is taken care of and not neglected.

After sitting down and looking at the prices, I'm surprised they didn't charge us just to smell the air. This place is WAY OVER priced for really mediocre food and small portions. \\n\\nLet me count the ways this place failed:\\n\\n1. The \\"bread\\" brought to the table were little corn muffins with plain butter. Very small and they only allowed for each of us to have one. Not very flavorful, but hey, it was complimentary so I'm not complaining too much.\\n\\n2. The menu selection. Everything is extremely overpriced. I tried to reason that maybe you would get sides with your choice of meat. Wrong. The sides (between $7-$8) are their own section and is said that they are served family style. Now, I don't know what kind of skinny rich people they're feeding because the portions of the sides were literally enough to feed 1.5 people (I'll talk about how they tasted later - probably from the amount of stars I gave, you have a good idea how that turned out). \\n\\n3. The waiter's recommendations on the menu was comical. I literally was going through the menu while he was talking and saw that in every category, he suggested the most expensive item. But good lord, I guess when an entre with no sides costs $42, it better be the best piece of meat ever consumed. \\n\\n4. I decided that for dinner I would go with one of the cheaper items, the pork ribs ($19). The bonus was that I got an apple slaw with it. When the food arrived, I received 3 ribs, granted they were big, but half of the meat was fat and cartilage. The meat actually had a decent asian flavor, but the ribs were really dry. They weren't even close to fall off the bone and a lot of parts just tasted like jerky. I had to dip it into the mediocre sauce selection they gave us. The apple slaw was also a joke - half of a sliced apple with some seeds on top.  \\n\\n5. Four of the people at our table decided to go with one of the more expensive items, the short rib ($32). When they brought this out, the size of all of the short ribs was completely inconsistent. They gave the men at the table the bigger ones and then handed the girl at our table a considerably smaller one, even commenting, \\"Looks like you got the smallest one.\\" Not only did this seem sexist, but regardless, when everyone is paying the same price, you cannot be giving an inconsistent product. \\n\\n6. We decided as a table to get some of the sides because they sounded delicious. These sides were ok at best. If I have one suggestion, for the love of god do not order the garlic roasted jalapeno broccoli. Having roasted broccoli before, I was very excited for this. When it came out, it literally was swimming in a liquid that one person at our table remarked as \\"tasting like weed water.\\" It was sour, it was undercooked, it was gross, it was freaking $8 for weed water broccoli. \\n\\nThis place is a perfect example of a restaurant where you are paying the exorbitant prices to feel like you are part of the upper crust of society. Unfortunately you are not getting a better quality for your price. You can easily go to a BBQ food truck and get much better BBQ for cheaper and with larger portions. Even if someone else said they would pay for my meal to eat here again, I would strongly suggest going somewhere else for BBQ every time."},{"name":"Modern Pastry Shop","address":"257 Hanover St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"This place is fine.

I actually liked the standard rolls better than the speciality roll. The OMG roll was stuffed so full of filling that it fell apart when you lifted it up with chopsticks. Sushi rolls that are too big is a bit of a pet peeve of mine. But it tasted alright. I really loved the avocado roll the best - the avocado was so creamy and fresh, it tasted amazing with the white rice. So I would suggest just sticking to the cheaper rolls and saving your pennies.

Sounds about right that your trusty reviewer would eat at a place named that, doesn't it?\\n\\nTucked in between Jackson Properties and Donn's Texas Barbecue on Oak Meadow Drive is this little vacant lot that is currently home to the Oak Hill Food Court Haven.\\n\\nWhere the heck is Oak Meadow Drive, you say?  Well for those of you who have been in Austin more than a fortnight, it's right behind the old Albertson's store at the \\"Y\\" in Oak Hill.  And, for the Austifornians, it's behind the Planet Fitness at the Intersection of US 290 West and State Highway 71 West.\\n\\nThere are two tenants at the moment, and Fishey Bizness is one of 'em.  My initial destination was Donn's, but I came back here because me and fried shrimp are besties--until I eat them--and I haven't had any in recent memory, which, for me is about two weeks.  Yes, I have developed a condition called shrimpnesia.  I get more that way.  Shrimp, that is.\\n\\nA pathway made of red pavers marks the way from the sidewalk to the storefront.  The trailer has been decorated nicely, and a smell of good, fresh seafood permeates the air.  There are four seemingly new wooden picnic tables painted blue with large red umbrellas.  Unfortunately, the day I went here, the umbrellas were down, because the winds were high.\\n\\nThere are two windows -- order and pick-up.  Ordering is pretty easy because their menu is simple.  Fried shrimp, fried fish, and variations on that theme (po-boys and tacos).  Fries are the only side available, and drinks are iced tea, water, or soda.  Can't get much simpler than that.  There's a cool NFC device next to the order window, which makes things very convenient.  Which is why I paid cash.\\n\\nBut you want to know about the food, right?  I went with the \\"Half and Half\\", which is a half-dozen fried shrimp and one-half of a fried fish filet.  This is served as a meal with a generous serving of fries and a roll, along with cocktail or tartar sauce.  I also had a couple of hush puppies thrown in with my order, which is not listed as being in the meal.\\n\\nHow is it?  The seafood is fantastic!  It's fresh as claimed.  The shrimp are tasty, maybe not the best I've had ever, but they certainly are good.  The real surprise was the fish filet.  It was gigantic--and that was only supposed to be a half filet.  I'm more a shrimp person than a fish person, and I was blown away by the fish.  The order taker said it was black drum on the menu the day I ate there.  Both fish items were hot-hot-hot, and that's after traveling more than a mile with the AC on, having to move cars in the driveway, and prepare a quick brisket sandwich for another family member.\\n\\nThe accompanying items were a slight let-down, only in that they did not quite match the high standard set by the seafood.  The hushpuppies were small, barely warm, and otherwise unremarkable--SYSCO grade.  The roll was also small, and definitely reminiscent of what you might get at KFC.  The fries were again a commodity item, but well fried; while certainly better than average, they did not seem to be as fresh and hot as the fish.  I guess I expected more of the fries than I had a right to because the fish and shrimp were so awesome.\\n\\nOn to the pertinent questions:\\n- Would I go back?  Definitely yes.\\n- Would I make a special trip?  Quite possibly since the seafood is good and the prices are very reasonable for the portions served.  In fact, I can't think of anyone nearby who does it better, and certainly not for the price.\\n- Would I bring my friends here?  Hell yeah!

We came here upon recommendation from a Portland local.  We also looked up additional review on Yelp, and our experience was not quite what we expected.  Central would be a great place to go to for happy hour, with people you already know, since you're confined to your own table. It's not conducive to socializing with strangers.  This doesn't make it easy to mingle and meet new people.   \\n\\nThe drinks are super strong! Per the waitresses recommendation, I ordered the strawberry daquiri and it was strong as hell! I took 1 - 2 sips and I already knew that I was not going to finish this drink.  The drinks come in a small portion.  To my surprise, the drink was strong and tasted like straight tequila! I didn't know daiquiri was supposed to taste like tequila?\\n\\nThe good news: The waitress asked me whether or not I was satisfied with my drink. I was honest and told her no. She asked me if I wanted something else because she didn't want me to not enjoy my drink.  By that time, I was over it. She was nice to take the charge off our bill.  Typically, I'm not picky when it comes to drinks. I'm actually quite simple, but this place just had complex mixtures.  Sometimes, in my case, it's best to just keep it simple."},{"name":"Bun Cha Ca Hoang Yen","address":"5083 Victoria Drive","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4","text":"Came to this place last night. Waited for 20 minutes before getting a shared table (first time I shared a four people table with another couple...man that was weird!)\\n\\nHad the #23 special crab noodles, grilled pork chop, grilled chicken, pan fried squid cakes, durian milkshake. They are all better than your regular pho 99 restaurant but honestly, when you are in the Victoria/Kingsway area where there are tons of authentic Vietnamese restaurants, I find Jiang Yen very average.\\n\\nThe pork chop was dry, the grilled chicken OK but a tad on bland and dry side. The durian milkshake was not flavorful too little durian used. The crab meat noodle was tasty but not the best I had and was SMALL in a big bowl.\\n\\nFrankly our fav vietnamese restaurant in this area, hands down, is Pho Thai Hang 2 on Kingsway at Victoria, which does everything better than Hoang Yen and in bigger portions!

Third, homemade salsas (red and green) with chips were quickly ushered to the table.\\n\\nFor my meal, I ate vegetable enchiladas with Yukon gold potato, corn and roasted tomatillo sauce. They were so, so tasty, though my server asked if I'm vegetarian when I ordered because he said there's chicken broth or stock in the tortillas. I thought that was odd, since a vegetable enchilada is likely what a vegetarian will order. \\n\\nMy husband ate tacos de carnitas with crispy pork belly, housemade flour tortillas, hot and sweet guava glazed, cilantro and onions. For his drink he had a Vampire Weekend -- housemade horchata, The Kraken spiced rum, grated cinnamon and nutmeg and pineapple garnish. I drank a Superita! -- Herradura Double Reposado, Royal Combier, lime juice, orange juice, salt, citrus marinated olives, served up, TX-style.\\n\\nThough tasty, the cocktails were small for their price; however, I'm used to more sizable drinks at Mexican restaurants, like the perfect margaritas at Rosepepper in Nashville.\\n\\nRefried beans and Mexican rice come shareable for the table with your meal, and I wish they'd asked if we wanted these. We didn't eat them and felt bad for being wasteful. The server asked if we'd like a box for them, yet we don't care for beans and rice anyhow. It made for a lot of food, and the entree sizes themselves perfectly satisfied our hunger.\\n\\nI'd happily return to Superica for lunch, dinner, brunch, drinks -- whatever I can conceive.

And instead of being little bits here and there, and it was full, tasty strips of bacon. The cream cheese icing was good, but a bit overpowering for my not-so-sweet tooth and I will order that on the side next time. My companions had the country Benedict and the egg breakfast with hash browns. Both were very pleased with their orders, and even ordered a second helping of hash browns.

Of note, when someone buys the last one of what you want, don't worry, there's probably another tray of awesome in the back ready to come out, even in the evenings when we were there - we had that happen to us several times.

When our server came back we had questions...\\"what's in the Mexican corn soup?\\"  He had no idea and pretty much just stood there staring until it dawned on him that he should probably go find out.  Already not impressed.

Okay.......\\n\\nWhile waiting for our meals, our son's sippy cup spilled on the floor.  Our waiter literally grabbed one rag and made a swipe at the mess and then stepped over it to get the check from the now vacant table behind us.  We asked for napkins to replace the ones we used to clean up...had to ask twice AND flag down the manager before we got any.  Did I mention he brought napkins to another table nearby first?  We asked for a round of refills...he brought our drinks but didn't bring out my son's...so he left a 2 year old waiting for more to drink.\\n\\nOur salads came out AFTER our meals were on the table and my husband's sides were wrong.  And the cherry on top of this horrible experience...those hot dogs were clearly NOT all beef.   To be honest, my husband was the only one who liked the food too.  I got the chicken fried steak and it was just bad, he got the Texas chopped steak.  \\n\\nThe only saving grace of this restaurant was the fact that the manager, Dave, was very apologetic and took care of the bill.

Not to knock that place, it's got amazing food and a cool vibe, but you don't get very full and you spend a lot of money.\\nSo we've got 6 or 7 of us at Odd Duck (right next door) and we've easily dropped $400+ as a group and I'm still hungry.  So I politely told the group that I was gonna roll next door and grab a burger and would be back soon.  Immediately 2 of the guys jumped up and said they were interested, but questioned the quality of the burger.  I confidently told them that if it wasn't the best burger they'd ever eaten that I would give them their money back.\\nNeedless to say, that story ended the same way it has in similar situations: both of them looking at me like we discovered hidden treasure.  They swore up and down that they didn't believe me, but I was right and this is the best burger EVER.  The only other things I've had are the shrimp and the veggie, which are all amazing, but the burger is my jam.\\nBest part is it's right out front of Gibson bar and you can order and they'll bring it to you inside the bar while you're drinking...like you can eat amazing food truck food AND drink.

Tons of shake favors to choose from and because they look so yummy you might consider getting one for everyone. Please don't! These things are huge and cost $22. They come in a mason jar which you're allowed to take home but who wants to walk around the park with a sticky mason jar so we recycled ours. \\n\\nThe winner of the night was the red velvet milkshake with a cupcake on top.

Perhaps when Mike's first opened, it was great, but since then it's become so commercialized and filled with tourists that the quality has seriously gone down. Modern rules over Mike's cannoli any day, every day. \\n\\nIf you've claimed to have done a taste test comparing Mike's and Modern and have already been biased with people around you saying that Mike's is better or *the* place to go in the North End, chances are that you're going to prefer Mike's even if the taste of Modern's cannoli is better. I've done blind taste tests on my friends, who have all said that they preferred the Modern cannoli. Why? Mike's cannoli is pre-filled with ricotta filling, which means that by the time it gets to you, it's already soggy and the crunch of the cannoli cookie is gone. That, and the filling tastes commercial, like cheap ricotta filling that might have been mixed with lard. It doesn't have that rich yet subtle, creamy, and semi-sweet taste that Modern has. \\n\\nI love the cannoli at Modern, but other things that I also love are the torrone (made fresh, and such a treat!) and the tiramisu. I would come to North End all the way from the suburbs of Boston just to have one slice of Modern's tiramisu. It's scrumptious. \\n\\nAnother thing I like about Modern is that they have an orderly line -there's no guessing who's next to serve. Every time I go into Mike's, there is no line - it's just a crazy mob of people fighting to get to the counter. So for our taste tests, I had to do what I had to do and just weaved through that mob to get to the front. Go ahead and say I'm bad, but hey, you need to figure out the system and work with it. :-D \\n\\nAll the locals of the North End have immense loyalty and dedication to Modern over Mike's.

It was amazing. The ingredients were simple, flavorful, and attractive to look at. This space had a lot of thought that went into it. From there are some very classic Sicilian/Italian decor with a few nods from Portland, Oregon's Pearl District for flare. From a black pipe bar and dark woods in the bar section to Marble table tops and a 70' long chalk board wall. This place was great. To be honest, the food speaks for itself; I want to focus on the ambiance and feelings I felt being in there. The lighting is top notch with \\"Edison\\" bulbs to a reclaimed chandelier that hangs from the ceiling by an antique pully and a huge rope tied off to the wall like a movie. I can't decide if I want to swing from the thing or pull out my sword, cut the rope and drop it on the villain's head. It's pretty cool and can be seen from the street through the huge front window. To go along with the antique pully, the seating has incorporated 100 year old church pews. They are awesome!  One other thing I noticed was the bar has 10 outlets for your computer/phone and 10 high speed USB plugs right under the bar to get a quick charge while having a drink. Next to the outlets are several hooks for the ladies to hang purse. (I only mention this because I overheard a couple of women at the bar mentioning how they hate it when they go to a bar and have no place to hang their purse) Like I said, this place was well thought out.

It hasn't disappoint me yet.  When I think of Boston I think of Beer and Cannoli's...weird combo I know..I don't have it together. I just take note and make sure to have both at one point or another while in Beantown"},{"name":"Modern Pastry Shop","address":"257 Hanover St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"My family enjoyed their pastries. However, I'd never wait in that line again. It has a very \\"Soup Nazi\\" feel to it. Their system for taking and placing orders is absurd. It seems to me you should have one person taking orders and one person checking you out. Hand you your box when it's ready. Instead the help one person at a time and one person takes the order, fulfills it and then checks you out. Not many people helping either. Lastly, I waited in line for a gluten free cannoli only to be shut down by \\"they sold them all last night.\\" Really? You couldn't make more the next morning? I had the GF muffin instead, it was pretty good, but I really wanted that cannoli."},{"name":"Little Donkey","address":"505 Massachusetts Ave","city":"Cambridge","stars":"4","text":"Very consistent, innovative food turned out with solid skills and attentive service. The portions are actually quite huge; I was WAY overly full when as 2 girls we ordered 5 \\"tapas\\" plus dessert. Breakfast, lunch, and dinner are all very well done. \\n\\nAnother big reason I'm giving LD 5 stars: It's not that bad to get in! (I'm looking at you, toro, neptune, sarma, etc...)\\n\\n+ Menu comp -- All menus are very interesting. You might find it hard to gauge what things are going to taste like because you might be like, \\"you can make a xyz with that?\\" Make sure to get your server's advice if you're unsure.\\n+ Food taste -- REALLY solid. We might have hit on the right items, but everything I've had here have all been executed perfectly. Regardless of personal likes/ dislikes, each item was flawless. Not too salty but well seasoned. Lots of flavors layered in, well thought-out. Greasy but not overwhelmingly so. Soft where it needs to be soft, and crunchy where it needs to be crunchy.\\n+ Service -- Very friendly and smart. Thoughtful when answering questions, everyone went the extra mile. For example, when I went in for a mid-morning pastry there was one last puny portion of one of the pastry items left. The staff was sympathetic to my pickiness of which \\"piece\\" I get, offering to charge me half, and ultimately finagled a fresh-out-of-the-oven piece from the kitchen. Every time I've asked (nicely), I've been given.\\n+ Price -- Really reasonable! A huge veggie torta at the full-service table, for example, was $12. Given the extreme deliciousness and huge portion (I could have stretched it out to 2 meals!), it's a real steal. The dinner items were also mostly quite big, with the exception of dessert. The dessert is strangely like half the portion you normally get at other restaurants, but your pancreas is probably in overdrive already anyway."},{"name":"Black Angus Steakhouse","address":"7516 W Irlo Bronson Memorial Hwy","city":"Kissimmee","stars":"3.5","text":"Came here after a busy day with the family.

First of all, they don't even sell a picture of Sangria, and what they do sell comes out of a box. Who don't make their own Sangria? So, I get a mango Margarita, and it tasted soapy, and not good. My partner got something that was also less than inspired. Next, they charge like 10 dollars for chips and salsa? Like every Mexican restaurant on the planet provides chips and salsa as a free munchie while they get the drinks. I mean, dude. And the chips? A small bag of Doritos is bigger. Not even enough chips to scoop up the salsa. Next comes the bill, it was bigger than our bill for dinner that we had in Leesburg. I mean, really.

The Mike's vs. Modern discussion seems to be obligatory. I am ashamed to say that before this summer I had only braved the line at Mike's, albeit not very frequently. Well, if I ever need my touristy, relatively decent, Italian pastry fix, I will be heading across Hanover Street until something better comes to Boston. I will admit it here: as much as I try to deny it, I am an ingredient purist...nope, make that an all-out ingredient snob. Quality ingredients can transform good technique into an extraordinary product. My pockets are shallow, yet I would rather indulge less and be charged more for a better dessert. Most of my criticisms of Modern stem from this neuroticism and should not deter normal people from trying certain items. Hearing they made a good ricotta pie, I headed to Modern for the first time in June. It wasn't exactly extraordinary, but it was nice and dense with a double crust thick enough to appreciate its chew and a filling that was creamy but also had that unique texture that ricotta gives desserts. For me, chocolate is nearly always a sweet surprise, but I neither expected nor enjoyed the line of chocolate filling that covered the bottom crust. This chocolate pudding substance did nothing for the dessert and was chalky and artificial tasting (Jello brand, perhaps?). Altogether, it was a bit one-note and needed that citrusy bite that is a trademark of Italian pastries, but it otherwise delivered. \\n\\nI had not thought a bit about Modern until I went recently to purchase some of their nationally recognized torrone as a gift for my mom for Christmas. Straying away from overly-Americanized versions like peanut butter and anything with those awful holiday candied cherries, I ordered a plain, a chocolate, a chocolate-covered, and a caramel log for my mom. Into a box they went, not to be tasted before December 25th. The plain torrone was divine. It was soft and chewy and the exemplary abundance of whole-roasted almonds is what makes the torrone so special and incredibly aromatic. Again, though, Modern's specialties prove not to be improved by chocolate. The chocolate coating on the three remaining torrone may have been made from the finest of Italian chocolate for all I know, but to me it tasted flat and waxy (don't shoot me, but I would argue that French, Belgian, and even some San Franciscan chocolate manufacturers are better choices to adorn what is really great torrone). The caramel bar was interesting; I love how each layer came together, yet I'm not entirely sure the caramel was made in house. It was adequately chewy and buttery but lacked great depth. \\n\\nBut what really sealed the deal for me was the cannoli. Since I braved the line of confused out-of-towners, I deserved a snack. I ordered a mini ricotta cannolo topped with powdered sugar for myself that I had to devour quickly outside as holiday revelers passed, for I had no bag in which to carry it. Upon biting into the tubular treat, the crispy shell broke easily, releasing the light, airy ricotta goodness all over me and my hands. But that's exactly what I love about piped to order cannoli. The exterior is kept crisp, but I think the shell recipe is also key. They just do it better here. The filling also reigns supreme. Again, it lacked that bit of citrus, but it was truly ethereal. \\n\\nFor good ricotta pie, exceptional (white) torrone, and, yup, the BEST cannoli in Boston, wait in a (slightly) shorter line at Modern. Just steer clear from chocolate or heavy American desserts."},{"name":"Lee's Bakery","address":"4005 Buford Hwy NE, Ste C","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Very Delicious Food!

But I decided to write a review because of what I see as the deterioration of my favorite place. \\n\\nFirst of all, the service is stellar. The waitstaff are always smart, kind, accommodating, and lovely! I love the location and the interior. I love the booths and the rotating art. I love that there's a cute little parking lot in back. I love many, many things about the place. My answer to the question \\"Where do you want to eat?\\" was for years \\"Cambridge Common!\\"\\n\\nMy two favorite items (and what I ate each and every time)  were ( and I emphasize the 'were') fried pickles and crunchy Cobb salad. I always ordered the salad without bacon and with extra avocado. The dressing was always great and just the right amount. I devoured every bite with glee. Now, not. The last few times I've ordered it, the dressing has been oddly vinegary. And I've been receiving about 2 slices of avocado in place of the bacon as opposed to the 8 or so that I used to get. So I no longer have a favorite dish there.\\n\\nNow to what really has broken my heart: the change in the fried pickles. For 6 years I've been eating and dreaming about the CC fried pickles. Last weekend my glorious, golden, just-the-right-amount-of-spice fried pickles were covered in a weird dark brown dry substance.

So, we look some more and make some decisions on both drinks and food. Our waitress comes back and we order it all. It took us more than 20 minutes to get our drinks, and though we got an apology from the waitress that the bar was backed up, we had already been waiting for more than 15 minutes. Finally, the drinks arrived, but one was wrong and had to be sent back. As they were remaking the drink (again, not quite right, but close enough), our food arrived.\\n\\nI think at this point we weren't expecting much, though we had been thoroughly entertained by the guy at the raw bar.

A pastry challenge of sorts - Mike's vs. Modern vs. Maria's.\\nIve done this with donuts - why not Italian baked goods?\\nTo be as close to fair as I could - I decided I would get one cannolli at each place. The plan was one plain cannolli. So I could compare apples to apples. Or cannolli to cannolli, as it were.\\n\\nMy take:\\n\\n***Mike's - 3.5 Stars, Rounding up to 4!***\\nThis is definitely the most tourist friendly of the three. I was warned about long lines - but being there on a mid day Thursday while it was snowing kept tourists at bay.  Our timing was perfect - only a couple people in front of us - and no problem getting a table. It started filling up and lines extending as we were finishing up. Smells the way I expect a bakery to smell - lots of flour and sweet in the air. Visually, the most impressive of the three bakeries. Several cases of Connolly, cakes, butter cookies, cupcakes, puzzles, biscuit - an overwhelming variety. And THIRTEEN varieties of Connolly! Cruel to provide that many options! This was the first stop - and temptation did me in. So much for plain - I ordered the chocolate ricotta cannolli. \\nThe filling - WAY sweet! And from other reviews - still not as sweet as the creme filled. Even separating out the level of sweet the chocolate brought, this was sugar overload. The texture was great, the size was ginormous - but I couldn't even finish half of it...this was just way more sugar than I can possibly handle at one sitting.\\nThe shell - very nicely done. A wee bit thicker than I'd like - I really had to slam my plastic fork into it to get it to break. But the flavor was impeccable.\\nMy coworker ordered the Boston Creme Puff. The chocolate shell on top was too hard to navigate with plastic fork AND knife. The server who brought the pastries and drinks to our table instructed her to turn it upside down and eat from the bottom. The flavors were great - but she was quite frustrated it was that difficult to eat a pastry, and gave up on the pastry and chocolate, throwing over half the item away.\\n\\n***Modern - Solid 5 Star!***\\nModern is far smaller than Mike's, and with only a small fraction of the baked good on display. More retail offerings (imported coffees, mugs, \\"grab and go\\" pre-wrapped baked goods, etc.) than Mike's and a very cozy atmosphere. Cannolli are filled to order. Your choice of 3 shells, 4 fillings, assorted toppings. I went with the plain shell, traditional ricotta filling and powdered sugar on top. It was a bit smaller than Mike's - but that's not a bad thing. It was a proper serving size for one!\\nThe filling - OMG perfection! Thick, creamy ricotta with just barely a hint of sweetness. THIS is the cannolli filling I fantasize about.\\nThe shell - similar texture and flavor as Mike's - but thinner, so breaking it was not a problem.\\nThe coworker had a filled zeppoli with vanilla creme. She really enjoyed it - and was able to eat it without logistical issues. Yay!\\nAs with Mike's, our timing was impeccable. Only a few ahead of us in line, no problem getting a table - and when we left - the line was WAY out the door.\\n\\n\\n***Maria's - 4 Star!***\\nMaria's is TINY! If there are 6 customers in the store, they'll be sardines. Luckily - we were the only ones there. We didn't have any more room for food (or sugar) - so we decided to get our items to go and eat them later.\\nAs with Modern - cannolli are filled to order. Choice of shell, choice of filling. I ordered a plain shell with plain ricotta filling, the coworker decided to make hers the same as mine.\\nThe filling - solid! The flavor was every bit as good as Modern, but not quite as thick. But great texture overall - I would never pass one of these up.\\nThe shell - PERFECTION!

We did it!  Fresh tracks into the place and seated at a window (yay!  street view!).  Then we realized that AYCE doesn't = buffet.  This was new to us and we showed our ignorant south-of-the-border ways by checking off what we actually thought we could eat between the 4 of us.  The waiter (owner?) came and disgusted, started crossing things off the menu saying that it was too much food and the kids wouldn't like this or that.  We stifled our annoyance and asked that he just send whatever he thought would be a good start our way, assured him that we all loved sushi in all its splendor and would be happy no matter what.  \\n\\nOff he went and we started reading the fine print on the menu.  First of all there is a time limit!  90 minutes and they boot you.  Okay, we're not dawdlers.  We can get our money's worth in 90 minutes.  And there is a $.50 per leftover rice ball so you Paleo Gorgers consider yourselves warned!  Oh, and there is an unspecified charge for leftovers (presumably other than rice balls?).  Hmm.  Pressure is now mounting.  And as we scan the room we see that every other table has been served something except us.  And the clock is running.  30 minutes.  35 minutes.  40 minutes.  I think my teenage daughter is about to lunge across the room and grab some gyoza out of that guy's chopsticks over there.  45 minutes.  1/2 our allotted time has passed and here we sit with nothing but an empty tea pot.  Finally at 46 minutes after we sat down and ordered all raw food we get a modest selection of rolls and sashimi (max 8 pieces per person!).  The sashimi is salmon and tuna.  The salmon is good.  The tuna, less so but still okay.  The rolls are meh, a little heavy on the non-fish ingredients.  The rice balls under the tomago are enormous.  We demolish the plate in about 30 seconds.  \\n\\nThe waiter brings another small selection of rolls (pieces of rolls, 3 of this, 3 of that) and then asks if we'd like another menu.  Yes!  Duh!  We're still feeling hungry and so stressed from watching everyone else being fed that the Hanger takes over and we check off a bunch of stuff, some repeats of what we've tried, some new things, like that gyoza my daughter was eyeing.  \\n\\nFinally we get a load of food, more rolls, some beef teryaki (tastes like Grandma's beef stew - except candied), chicken teryiaki (fried until dry and smeared with sauce?), gyoza (way undercooked but we're all afraid to leave leftovers so we eat it like good little sheeple), some sushi, this time with noticeably more rice ball than topping.  But at last we are no longer hungry or hangry and we didn't overstay, we've got 9 minutes left on the clock.\\n\\nAnd then the next tray of food arrives.  \\n\\nThere was quite a flood of reaction at the table.  Panic, blaming, fear, then laughter and so much that someone nearly shot a rice ball out their nose.  If we were indeed playing some weird game, they had won.  But the whole event had become so ludicrous, first wanting to eat lots of sushi, then being discouraged from such, then being inundated with it (and poor quality sushi at that) and under duress to finish too much in too little time?

There are a few of the Ray's restaurants around Atlanta and this is one of my favorites.  The place is elegant and always clean throughout.  They have started teaming with your servers so there are more than one servant who will attempt to help you with your service.  The only issue you'll find with this Ray's is the bill at the end of the night.  Its not a place for the frugal.  There is plenty of wine to select from and a nice little bar area if you only want to stop in for a beverage.  The river view is nice and they take very special care of you when you dine.  Its more of an upscale dining experience which will require business casual attire.  I don't have anything negative to say about the place.  When i can afford it, i like to go.  They are very impressive and make a great dining experience.  I would recommend you make a reservation if you want to eat on the weekend.  They have available complimentary valet parking as well as a small lot for self parking.  If i recall correctly, two glasses of wine in the bar area, then dinner with another 3 glasses of wine each and the meal ran us $250/$275, but we did go Oscar, crab meat added atop each of our cuts of steak."},{"name":"Kona Grill","address":"11410 Century Oaks Ter","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"Go to the Happy Hour!

I like tekka-don, which is a bunch of tuna on rice. I get it at Mr Sushi in Brookline, which I love. It costs the same 10 bucks there, I thought, hey, ill try it here. So I ask, can I get a Tekka-don? Sure thing! Says the waitress, and hustles off. More fool I for not asking the price! I get it, its tiny, half of Mr Sushi or even Fugakyu portion size. I eat it, its ok, Ginza has great quality fish, but portion size matters. We get the check, my tuna was 18 dollars! Apparently they thought I was ordering off the dinner menu! I'm not complaining (much) but when I explained they said I ate it and I never asked the price. Ok, so there you go. Don't get the tekka don there, for dinner, cause you'll get ripped off. C'est la vie.\\n2) I went there with a few non work friends who came to downtown to get lunch with me. I said \\"hey, lets do Ginza!\\" and we went. The meal, which was one main course per person, no appetizers, no edamame, just water, took over an hour to get to our table! I get the feeling they were delaying because we were so obviously pissed.

The tortillas are regular store bough and just microwaved. The lengua (tongue) tacos had nerve endings and pieces of the outer tough skin that is supposed to be peeled and tossed. Once again their salsas are a joke, I had to resort to my tapatio bottle just for some flavor. And they didn't provide any garnish like limes or radishes (I went through the drive-thru).

The first time we walked around the park for an hour while waiting for a table, which was great. But then we were seated at the worst possible table - close enough to the bathrooms to hear the toilets flush and with a constant flow of guests and servers walking right next to us. Very distracting and unappetizing. So we asked to be moved and were seated outside where it was too cold but at least we got fed. The food was nothing special. We wanted to get dessert but it was too cold to enjoy ice cream or milk shakes so we left. They did have the ability to turn on heaters and drop some plastic sides on the deck to warm people up, but they said that it wasn't cold enough to do that.\\n\\nFast forward to night #2 and we decide to just try it again just for dessert. We were told the wait time was 90 minutes so again we enjoyed a walk around the area while we waited. Once we are seated, however, our server tells us it will be an additional 45 minutes before we can get dessert. We asked to speak to a manager and complained about waiting 90 minutes for a table only to be told it would be another 45 minutes before we could eat. He totally had an opportunity to make things better for us - put a rush on our order, discount our food - but he did nothing so we left.\\n\\nThis was by far the worst part of our entire experience to Universal Studios, which was otherwise a terrific success."},{"name":"Smak Healthy Fast Food","address":"545 Granville Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4","text":"This review is on 2 levels.

We both find Ming Tsai's cuisine to our liking and like most people are fans of his work. \\n\\nWe arrived around 1:45PM and we were hoping to beat the lunch rush, but found ourselves caught in a packed house with over a dozen people elbow to elbow in front of the hostess, patiently awaiting for their cell phones to get that text message. Yeah you read that correctly - Blue Dragon employs a queuing service from a company called BuzzTable. It's actually quite nifty and the process is quick. And because it goes through your phone, the range is only limited by your carrier's signal so I was tempted to make my way to Drink for a cocktail since it's a few blocks away but they open at 5PM... So we waited. We waited a few minutes and made our way to the bar for a couple of pints and about twenty minutes later the text message came. So we made our way to the front and were told that we'd be seated in a minute and yet somehow, it took a lot longer. They came again and told us to wait another minute to clear that one table and yet, it took another ten. Eventually they sat us. It was a bit enraging to see so many open tables at that point. We had been there for almost an hour and the lunch rush was long gone. It was still busy, but only at about 20% capacity. We still can't quite figure out why they didn't seat us earlier but we were happy to finally be able to order away and eat. \\n\\nWe took a good look at the menu and decided to misbehave a bit and split a Dragon Bowl ($20), which is a shareable cocktail served up in a giant bowl and which features orange juice, Don Q rum, Pisco, lemon, passion fruit, orgeat, cinnamon, \\nsimple sugar, Goslings Black Seal float. Absolutely delicious and not too sweet or booze. It went down smooth and was gone in an instant. However we did notice that the bowl was only filled up just about halfway which made our cocktail less impressive than the legendary scorpion bowls one can get at Hong Kong. However this one tasted better so I guess it had that going for it. \\n\\nOur waitress arrived and we placed our orders. I went for their roast pork Banh Mi with spicy aioli and house pate ($10) and the misses went for a very creative and absolutely delicious Asian Sloppy Joe with sambal aioli and crispy onions ($9). We also decided to split an order of Dan Dan noodles ($8) to start after running the portion size factor by our waitress. I also ran my food allergy past our waitress who was able to access the restaurant's allergies bible and picked up on one of the things I'm allergic too. I was able to get what I ordered but they tweaked it slightly to accommodate me. Much like at Blue Ginger. Actually that is one thing that Tsai's restaurants always do very well - they are always very attentive and considerate of people's allergies and it doesn't got unnoticed by individuals including myself. I believe that this stems from Tsai's kids having allergies based on a rumor I heard a while back. Either way, you can make sure that if you'll be very well taken care of in case you do have allergies as long as you communicate them to the staff there. \\n\\nThe food itself was quite simple and yet had great depth of flavors - I mean a banh mi is a very modest sandwich and yet Tsai's chefs have elevated it into a slightly more elegant version and a rather tasty one at that. The roasted pork worked well in there and the house-made liver p√¢t√© came through as well and was a great contrast to the crisp vegetables in there and the heat from the sliced hot peppers. The bread was nice and crispy and was reminiscent of the side Asian slaw that came with it alongside the crunchy taro chips. \\n\\nMy fianc√©e's Asian sloppy joe was absolutely divine. It was savory and delicious and the flavors of the various ingredients came through as well as the crispy onions in it. A very balanced work of art and a very unique one at that. And as much as she loved it (and I loved my few bites I took) the bread did get soggy and it turned into a knife and fork job but it's still worth it. Do it, you know you want to.\\n\\nWe also had some Dan Dan noodles which actually was our appetizer - they were good and not too spicy - it was a solid equilibrium of chili oils, noodles, crumbled pork and a touch of magic. However, the portion was quite big, especially with our sandwiches arriving later, so we were a tad annoyed that our waitress confirmed that we had not ordered too much food. The bitch lied. \\n\\nAll in all the place is a very exciting addition to Fort Point. It's not pretentious, it's affordable and the menu is quite original and unique. The decor is great and they are environmentally conscious.

I was actually pretty disappointed when tasting the meal. My friends and I were visiting from New York, when we saw the menu and thought what a cool foodie resto outside of the Big Apple. We were so excited for the meal and as we walked in we marveled at the decor.\\n\\nHowever, it all went south after that. My friends and I are not very picky eaters at all and we love spending dinero on good food. But this place was all price met none of the hype.\\n\\nHere's what we ordered: \\n\\n* Spicy Korean Chicken Dumplings - the sauce that came with this was not appetizing. I can't even say its real Korean because I live right near Koreatown in NYC and did not find the flavors to be like the Korean food in Ktown.\\n\\n* Garlic-Ginger Bok Choy - If you love veggies this is a good option, just be prepared to be astonished by how little bok choy comes with the dish. Also, Garlic - Ginger combo is fairly nice but I was expecting the dish to have a bit more pizzazz.\\n\\n* Teriyaki Bison Mini Burgers - standard mini burgers. The bison meat was a nice touch. The fries that came with the burger was probably one of the highlights of the meal.\\n\\n* Wok-Stirred Szechwan Lobsters - this was the biggest let down because we expected a out of the world experience with the lobster and this dish ruined seafood for us. The spices were not only overwhelming but so powerful that the subtle taste of the lobster was lost. After a few bites, the dishes just tasted of pure peppercorns. Spices are meant to enhance flavors not drown out any competing tastes in a dish.\\n\\n* Sherry Drunken Shrimp - Only 3 pieces of Shrimp.This was ok but it comes with the entire shell and head of the shrimp attached. It was a hassle to weed pull the skin off when its covered in the spices and sauce\\n\\n* The Cookie - pretty great dessert. Warm cookie with cold ice cream on top. But really, is this a revolutionary idea? I've made dessert quite similar before. What I thought was interesting is that the pan for The Cookie was much larger than the pan used to deliver the other dishes.\\n\\n\\n\\nIf you do end up here, I would recommend the Bison Mini Burgers and The Cookie but learn from our experience and don't get the wok stirred Szechuan Lobsters."},{"name":"Burgoo Bistro","address":"1100 Burrard Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4","text":"Burgoo is ALWAYS 5 stars but not at this location!

Amaretto, Expresso, Florentine, Caramel Pecan, Peanut Butter, etc. I have to say these were the most amazing cannoli EVER! All the flavors were tasty, but my winner was the Caramel Pecan and my hubby's favorite was the Expresso. I don't think you could go wrong with any of the 18 options. The other pastries and cookies we tried were also very tasty, but the cannoli was the stand up winner here.\\n\\nModern Pastry on the other hand, had some of the best cookies and cakes we tried on the trip. Everything in their display case is tempting as you wait for your turn in line to order. We tried the Black & White cookies which were soft and delicious. The cannoli and Lobster tails are filled when ordered. This means the shells remain light and crispy which is key reason for this being favored by many. I still prefer Mike's. \\n\\nHowever, Modern Pastry takes the cake on the cookies. Hands down, the best Rainbow cookies EVER! OMG! Thanks for making me crave these little bites of heaven!

I am so upset because I have no idea why I was targeted, when all I was doing was getting on the elevator so that I could leave and go to work.

There's 6 type of meat you can pick from, but there's a catch, you must order a minimum 2 portions.

I'm not sure why don't they just price it as 1 order.\\n\\nFood came quickly, we ordered the Dak-gali and added the cheese and rice cake which was a nice addition. It was fun to dip the cheese and eat the rice cake as they browned. \\n\\nThe only challenging part was the service.

As for the florentine cookies they were out as they are one of their top sellers. Probably a good thing they were out as this saved me a few calories and therefore pounds. Now to the truffles...I tried the white chocolate and the cappuccino both wonderful creamy and delicious. Beautiful to look at as well.

However you would either have to wake up early or just hope that you will get there at the right time to be able to use them. At night, we also realized that the bedsheets were not as clean and that they probably don't clean up the comforter as routinely as they should and just change the cover on it.

Fishook Grille even offers the four exact same Piri Piri sauces at each table, except they now say \\"Fishook Grille\\" on the labels instead of \\"Boneheads.\\"  To get a general idea of this restaurant and what they offer, read my original Boneheads (Atlantic Station) review here: http://www.yelp.com/writeareview/biz/B_Y0i87xAB9DuMd8cbhH5Q.  Everything still applies.\\n\\nAs for the food itself, that hasn't changed either.  Still light and healthy.  My friends and I stopped by Fishook for a late weeknight dinner.  I tried both the grilled Mahi Mahi and Pacific Snapper with seasoned yellow rice, sauteed Piri Piri mushrooms, and Fishook's black bean and corn salsa.  Both fishes were decent.  They flaked at the touch of a fork.  The Mahi Mahi had a smokier flavor than the snapper, which had a \\"fishier\\" smell and texture.  The Piri Piri mushrooms gave the dishes a tangy flavor.  I enjoyed the rice, which was fluffy and lightly seasoned.  The black bean and corn salsa was served cold in a small bowl and was better (fresher) than I expected.\\n\\nAs it stands, Fishook Grille has not changed much from its predecessor.

Both delicious but tonkotsu wins because it's just got that cream like texture if that's what you like. Black tonkotsu does have the spice I wish regular tonkotsu has.\\n\\nAnyway, the broth is flavorful and not over powered by a strong onion and garlic taste like I've had else where. The noddles are also delicious, nothing at all like the wrinkly noodles that remind me of instant ramen. The pork has good flavor (although I've had more tender in LA).

The offer started on my Kiddo's 7th birthday! And he LOVES pizza! Cheap and special, why not?!\\n\\nWe arrived at about 6:30pm on Thursday evening to celebrate our child's 7th year of life. We were immediately seated out on the patio and waited a bit to have our drink orders taken. But it was okay, we were too happy to let something as small as a wait for drink orders to bum us out :)\\n\\nAs we waited for our drinks, I had to use the restroom. (I've developed this new habit of checking out the bathrooms when I visit a new establishment.) As I walked inside, I fell in love with the decor and feel. I kinda wished I lived there. Beautiful patio, too, BTW!\\n\\nAfter my visit to the restroom, we placed our food order. We were stoked about 40% off everything, so we ordered two apps and a pizza. The apps came out perfectly, we were able to finish our first app before the second arrived. It almost felt like a buffet! Our first app was the Chicken and Veggie Skewers. If you love charbroiled foods, you'll definitely love this. Tasty and fresh off the grill... YUM!\\n\\nOur second app was the Spinach Ricotta rolls. Very delicious. Our Kiddo even enjoyed a few bites himself. The bread on these were fantastic. Big thumbs up for that!\\n\\nThere was a bit of a wait again with our food, but our server kept us informed and that's all that mattered. Nothing worse than feeling like you were forgotten. Umami Mia staff definitely made the effort to make us feel especial. ;)\\n\\nFor Kiddo, we ordered him a kid's cheese slice. I was surprised to see that it's normally $6 with chips. Sure enough, the slice was pretty decently sized. He was able to get two slices out of it. And he really enjoyed the \\"cheesiness and crunchiness\\" of his pizza.\\n\\nFor my husband and I, we ordered the Prosciutto and Mission Fig pizza. It was also topped with chili flakes, arugula, gorgonzola and parmesan cheese, drizzled with honey. A great pizza for those who like it salty and sweet.\\n\\nThe pizza crust at Umami Mia is awesome for those who love their pizza a bit on the crunchy side, at least on this particular night it was. Oh! And I will definitely pay them another visit soon to try their gluten-free menu options, word on the street is that it is amazing. I'm giving four stars because while it wasn't THE BEST pizza I've had in all of Austin, it definitely was no where near the vicinity of Bad.\\n\\nThumbs up to Umami Mia!

We frequent the Round Rock location and have never had a bad experience there. We ordered the same items as always. The crust on the pizza was really thin and they skimped on the toppings. We asked for half cheese-half pepperoni and 6 of 8 slices had pepperoni. This would be fine if more of our household ate meat. However, this only left 2 slices for 3 vegetarian family members. We also got a calzone which was okay. They used kalmata olives instead of black. I generally like them, but there were way too many, and I would have preferred black. Also, they gave me general marinara with it whereas the Round Rock store has this AMAZING chunky, almost salsa-like dip for the calzone...and is the reason I order it. Thus not getting that was a major let down. Finally, the service was odd. When I went in to order and pick up, there was a woman sitting at the front with a laptop. The first time she sort of acknowledged me, and the second time she ignored me altogether. She actually called to people working in the back to take my order. WHAT?! This lazy lady gave me a bad vibe. The other people working seemed nice, but I this woman's attitude will definitely drive customers away.

So I read up on the various debates about which cannoli shop is the best and eventually decided to try three different places: Modern Pastry, Maria's, and Mike's, all within twenty four hours. \\n\\nMy fellow judge and I started at Mike's and got the amaretti cannoli. I wasn't sure I liked cannoli before that moment, but that first bite made me a believer (or a Belieber?). The shell was crunchy, but not hard to bite into, and the filling was flavorful and sweet, but not too sweet. \\n\\nAfter polishing off our cannoli at Mike's, we headed across the street to Modern Pastry Shop. I stand by the fact that we should have gotten the ricotta filling to make this a fair competition, but we ordered a vanilla custard cannoli, which they filled fresh for us with a very yellow custard. Within the first bite I knew that this was no Mike's. The shell was really hard and the custard filling was overly sweet.  \\n\\nAfter resisting temptation to go back to Mike's, we went to bed in preparation for the nect day...more cannoli! We stopped into Maria's Pastry and ordered yet another vanilla custard cannoli (still think we should have done ricotta, but E la vita!). The color of the custard was much lighter than at Modern Pastry Shop and a more manageable level of sweetness. The shell was harder than Mike's, but softer than Modern's, leading us to place Maria's in second place in the cannoli competition. \\n\\nBut before we could give our final scores, we had to go back to Mike's to make absolutely sure that it was just as good as we remembered. We pushed our way intp the world's least organized line (it's a stampede in there) and eventually got a hazelnut cannoli. Besides all of the powdered sugar doused all over it, it was perfection. An A++ of cannoli. Unfortunately, the line (if you can call it a line) is so insanely disorganized at Mike's that I'm taking a '+' off the final score.\\n\\nFinal scores were as follows:\\nMike's Pastry : A+\\nMaria's Pastry : A-\\nModern Pastry : B"},{"name":"Banana Leaf","address":"820 W Broadway","city":"Vancouver","stars":"3.5","text":"Compared to the newer one on Robson, but service pretty good still how busy it was on a Thurs night.

We have been dining at this location on average 2-3 times a year for at least the past 10 years and, until last night, considered it our go-to restaurant for special occassions.  We arrived for an early dinner about 5PM, hoping to avoid a crowd and long wait, and requested seating at the hibachi. The restaurant was fairly empty at that time, with plenty of empty seats, but we told there were no seats available due to reservations.  We started to tur and leave, but the hostess spoke to a manager who allowed us to sit since the first reservation wasn't scheduled to arrive for another hour and a half.  There was another family already seated at the hibachi, so we shared their grill.  The chef had his back to my wife and I the entire time, which we didn't really mind since we'd seen the show many times before.  I do however feel that we didn't receive the level of attention we are accustomed to receiving.  The noticed the menu items had increased a couple of dollars since the last time we dined here, which would have been fine, but the portions were smaller. My wife ordered the filet mignon and salmon combo.  I ordered another filet combo.  We typically order different things and share a small portion of each others meals so that we receive a taste of everything, but her portion of salmon was so small that I refused her offer to let me sample a piece of it.  Increased prrice and shrinking portions aside, our waitress wasnt very attentive. She didn't bring either of us any white rice, which is usually served with the meal, and empty glasses weren't refilled.  After giving us soup and salad, she disappeared and didn't return until the end of the meal to plunk the bill down in front of me, pursuant to which she quickly disappeared again.  At the end of the meal, they used to include a choice of green tea, coconut, vanilla or ginger ice cream.  I was surpised when the bill was presented since I was expecting to be asked what flavor ice cream I wanted.  I enjoy dessert, and I rarely eat ice cream, so I was looking forward to it.  I saw ice cream being served to others, so before I handed over my VISA card, I asked about it and was told it was only for kids meals and side orders.  I would have purchased the ice cream, but wasn't given the option, so I paid and then went to Roche Bros. in Acton to pick up something in their bakery for dessert.  If you're new to Asian Gourmet, I'm certian you'll find it an enjoyable Asian dining experience with food that is very tasty and fresh, but if you been dining at this location for many years like me, and even when the sign out front read Hana Mizuki, you may find the experience a bit disappointing and wanting for the good old days.  Although the chef did a very nice job at preparing the food, and is very personable, the wait staff service is as important a part of the dining experience as the food.  I felt the service was a bit of a miss last night, and things have changed; and IMO not for the better, so my wife and I won't be returning to Asian Gourmet anytime soon. I'm not at the point where they've lost my patronage, but for me the experience I used to look forward to was tarnished, so we'll dine there less and find another restaurant for special occassions."},{"name":"Yaletown Brewing Company","address":"1111 Mainland Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"3","text":"Beer only review\\n\\nGreat storefront over cobble stone streets.

With IPA, Lager, Pale, Brown, Stout Wheat, Seasonal and Cask, Yaletown does not F around. Their Nagila Pale Ale does not mess around. A hint of hops finishes off this smooth, aromatic pour. Oh yeah this os good. Now onto the IPA. Home run! Great hoppy flavor and aroma but not a bitter finish. I'm afraid this beer may sneak up on me...after going down sooooo smooth. I could drink this all day. \\n\\nMenu (did not try) offers something for everyone. Pub starters of wings and skins with pizza, sandwich and hearty meat offerings.

They were for the most part pretty good. The only complaint about the drinks were the added ants. I don't think those are supposed to be in there.\\nLooking at the menu I wanted to try everything. So the 3 meat of your choice with 2 sides of your choice along with a slice of corn bread. How perfect. \\nI chose to have as my first meat, the brisket. This is the most strange brisket I have ever had. It was basically cubed fat in a bowl with bits of dry meat attached to a few of them. Not good. The second meat of choice was the ribs. Dry and overcooked. My third meat was the blackened catfish. Flavor wise this was delicious but had the consistency of toothpaste which tells me it may have been frozen for a while. For the sides I chose coleslaw that had zero flavor. It was basically shredded cabbage in a bit of water. Second side was macaroni and cheese. The flavor was good but it had to much \\"hot\\" spice to it and I could not get to the bottom of the small bowl. And at last the dry corn bread which I almost choked on. \\nThe bad food was bad enough but when we sat at the table it was sticky after it has been washed. If you needed to go the restroom, sorry. The room made your eyes burn from the filth and no paper towels to dry your hands. The kitchen service was very slow. The first to get their food in our group  was finished by the time the third person got theirs. They were finished by the time the sixth person was served and so on for our group.\\nFor the night the only positive that I can bring from this is the waitress we had was fantastic. Very nice and very attentive to us.\\nI do not recommend this place.

They seemed to really want to cater to the upstairs party and ignore their regular clientele.\\n\\nThe boar ribs were not very tender, and the spicy sauce was fairly standard. The brisket was bland, and the fat was badly distributed; the top 3 pieces were dry and overcooked, and the bottom 3 were soggy and smothered in fat... in a bad way. The ribs were meaty, but lacking smokiness and tenderness.\\n\\nSurprisingly, they do vegetables the best here, in my opinion. The fresh squash salad was light and a nice pairing to the heavy proteins, and the yogurt sauce paired nicely. The green beans and cherry tomatoes benefited from the hefty dusting of pine nuts. The brussel sprouts were sprinkled with thick cut bacon chunks and were sitting in a literal pool of brown butter.

It was all very good though slightly overpriced on some dishes for dim sum--granted you do have to consider this is a hybrid version of dim sum not your typical. \\n\\nWe spent about $140-150 without tip for three adults and two kids who didn't like anything but the made special fried rice with tofu. All the adults liked the flavorful dishes. It might be too spicy for the typical American kid FYI. Just be prepared that a typical Texas kid may not like dim sum in general.\\n\\nWe ordered the bok choy, broccoli, both very good, wontons fried and wontons steamed with roe on top. Because there are only three wontons in the wonton dishes for 7-8$ you do have to double up or in our case triple up if you want to make sure every person gets a few. This can make your check add up obvio. Got congee which was delicious. And another rice dish with scallions and other yummy black sauce tidbits (can't recall the name). \\n\\nThe oolong tea comes in a small pitcher and they make it a point to tell you only to steep it for 7 seconds and then put it in a pitcher I guess so it won't oversteep? I like my oolong darker so it was a non issue but thoughtful nevertheless. The teacups are tiny. \\n\\nThe coffee sticky bun was great and the chinese donut too with coffee that is until we found what looked like a hair in the donut but upon further inspection it seemed as if it was a bristle from a pastry brush, which made sense.\\n\\nThat is, until we took a few leftovers home and we found another bristle in the congee. Why a bristle in the congee? I don't know much about beard hairs but I do know that beards are very popular here and the chefs at old thousand were no exception.

WRONG!\\n\\nI really am at a loss for words and so I apologize for the rambling, but here we go.\\n\\nDisgusting floors and painfully uncomfortable booth seating.  The decor looks like this stuff came from another shut down restaurant and the floors are badly marked up. \\n\\nChips and salsa....I knew the meal was going to be a trainwreck as soon as I bit into the first chip.  The oil that these chips had been cooked in had not been changed in a long time.  You know that  yucky, slightly burned oil flavor on old chips taste....yeah, cringe with me...not good.   Salsa - no this is not salsa, this is crushed tomato puree dumped in a brown bowl.   ZERO STARS to start.\\n\\nThe family ordered the following:  Chicken and shrimp fajitas - $16 dollars, chicken quesadilla -$7, chicken burrito and steak tacos.    \\n\\nThe Fajitas are at the top of the menu - for two good reasons - they are subpar and EXPENSIVE.  I am pretty certain the shrimp were bay shrimp - miniscule and the chicken was a dried out oily slop with some degraded onions and peppers.  Refried beans were basically slop and the rice looked like some ketchup had been spilled in it and a few onions thrown in.   $16 for this disaster was a joke.  This place makes ON the Border look like the Dining Room at the Ritz Carlton.\\n\\nThe Chicken Quesadilla consisted of heavily processed cheese and a limited supply of chicken.  Another ripoff item\\n\\nThe chicken burrito was completely lacking and the chicken was dried out.  I know that it had been sitting back in a warmer for hours and it tasted exactly like that.\\n\\nOne slight saving grace, the steak tacos were actually passable.  The meat was not overcooked or stringy.  In retrospect  I should have just gone to Taco Veloz for tacos.\\n\\nMathias was my server.  He was good at getting everything I asked for.  However, when I requested a spoon for my 3 year old to eat with he brought a full sized tablespoon.   It sure was fun trying to watch her get rice in her mouth with a spoon half the size of her head.  I also checked my bill and he had tallied up a drink charge for the initial drink and two refills.  Really??  $6.75 for a diet coke and two refills.  I asked them to take it off an they did.   I always check the bill, I recommend that you do.\\n\\nSo, this was the first and last time there.  I viewed the drinks menu and found the stuff to be overpriced.  $15 pitchers of Miller Lite?  $9 shots of Patron.   This place is a dump and it should be priced accordingly.\\n\\nI have some real questions for the other reviewers.  Ray B. with that review it screams 1 STAR or less?  Christy C. queso dip is not a food, and I would recommend next time skipping the queso dip...when you taste the food you will never return. \\n\\nI sinned and did not read the Yelp reviews before going there.

The service has always been excellent, and we even have a favorite waiter. Last Wednesday on 9/14/16, though, when we went for the pizza sampling night, we waited 30 minutes for our waitress to acknowledge us and take our drink order and order our meal, and another 45 to get our appetizer... and our meals at the same time. The manager did apologize as did the waitress and she took the appetizer off of the bill, so we did not think anything of it and even returned the next night, as we were both craving deep dish pizza and happened to be nearby. This time, we did receive the appetizer out first and quite quickly, the general manager who sat us was very attentive to where we wanted seated, and even cleaned the table off in front of us. \\n\\nAt this point in the evening, they had redeemed themselves from the night before, and then our food came. I bit into my second slice of pizza, heard a crack, and the throbbing under one of the molars on the right side of my mouth came. I spit the food out, and with it came nearly half of one of my molars. I decided due to positive past experiences with UNOs, I would quietly inform the manager to not make the nearby tables aware UNOs had just destroyed my tooth. She was once again very apologetic, and quickly filled out the accident report form, repeatedly apologizing. She then went to get the general manager who had neglected to come over at all at this point, half an hour after the accident occurred. When another 25 minutes went by and no one had come, I proceeded to go to the bathroom to cry in a stall due to the pain. I have never had a cavity or any other problem with my teeth. I have never had less than a perfect report at the dentist. I brush three times daily and floss after every meal. I have impeccable dental health. Well, HAD. \\n\\nWhen he finally decided to grace us with his presence nearly 40 minutes later since apparently filling waters has superior priority, he handed over his card, and apologized before walking away. We then received our check. Oh yes, my boyfriend paid $23 dollars plus a $10 tip that night for his girlfriend's mouth to be permanently ruined. When I was offered to take home a pizza that had chipped my tooth, and that the general manager had dug through to find what had broken my tooth, I was speechless. ESPECIALLY when the general manager told us there was nothing that could have done such a thing to my mouth. So when I called corporate on the way home and left a message as it was now near 10pm at night, and might I add the fact 4 hours of homework waiting for me that night and my alarm set to wake up at 5am the next morning for 10 hours of work, I was relieved the next day at my desk when I got a call. I was told I would be called back by the end of the day. That was the 16th. Today is the 19th, 13 minutes before corporate closes.

We paid $180/night to stay in an establishment that was essentially a spiffed-up motel with a non-functioning pool and a locked hot tub, no breakfast, no refrigerator and subpar coffee in the room, no soap for the first day, and a guaranteed long wait at the front desk for every inquiry, as management was essentially not around until Sunday night, leaving one employee to pick up the pieces. \\n\\nI planned my stay around being able to walk to nearby universities for a conference and being able to swim in the mornings; I thus took a shuttle and didn't rent a car. The pool was closed due to \\"maintenance.\\" While an employee promised to try to have our room rate reduced for the inconvenience, the manager arrogantly told me that we could not receive a \\"discount\\" for this, since the pool had been shut down by order of the department of health.

That being said, it's simply phenomenal. Lambert's probably has one of the BEST happy hours in the city right now. With all bar food at half price and $2 off all drinks, you can get a substantial meal for less than $15. The only catch is that the prices are only available at the bar itself, which can be limiting when they have the upstairs section closed for private events. If you're with a sizable group, things could become complicated.\\n\\nFood time. If you want the best ROI, then the Cheeseburger ($6 during happy hour) is the best deal. You'll get a decently-sized burger with some tasty waffle fries that's pretty much an entire meal by itself. If you're still hungry or are sharing plates, then check out the Wild Boar Ribs and/or Achiote-Seared Chickpeas. Both are great for sharing with people. The boar ribs are really sweet and definitely worth checking out.\\n\\nAs I mentioned before, there is an upstairs area where concerts + private events are frequently hosted. I've been to several shows and while the acoustics might not be stellar, it's an intimate environment to see a band play.

The brother's OJ was refreshing; the sister's smoothie had strawberries, banana, mango and pineapple, yogurt and honey - it was good; the BF loved the coffee; and my herbal tea was warming and tasty!\\n\\n- Food:\\nWe shared a side order of biscuits and gravy (not on the menu). The gravy was flavorful and thick, and loaded with sausage pieces. The house made biscuit was on the dry side. We all agreed a side order, rather than the Biscuit Breakfast (full order of biscuits and gravy) is the way to go.\\n\\nMy sister got the Crunchy French Toast. \\nIf you are a fan of the sweet breakfast, this is def a winner. I, personally, dig savory dishes in the morning. But these had great texture from the corn flakes. \\n\\nMy brother enjoyed the crab cake benedict, which was the special of the day. Their \\"$15\\" crab cake is really good. The poached egg was perfect. I, personally, would have liked it if they skipped the English muffin.  \\n\\nThe BF had Mike's Special Scramble.  The proscuitto, the roasted garlic, tomatoes, basil and provolone made a great combo in the scramble.\\n\\nI enjoyed the Wild Salmon Hash.  Let me tell you - this was THE best dish of the 4!  Each of us loved the flavor, and texture of the salmon hash!  They def did NOT skimp on the salmon - there were huge pieces of salmon to indulge in!  I would def come back just for the salmon hash!\\n\\nBe prepared to wait - they no longer take reservations. Our party of 4 waited an hour! But it was worth the wait! We actually walked over to Voo Doo Donut to get some donuts (to enjoy post-brunch, or in the case of both my siblings, enjoy back in California).

It was early on a Friday night, around 6ish and the place was almost full.\\n\\nThe place is very open, a little too dim for my tastes but it was ok.  I understand the need to maximize space and seating but felt a little cramped at times.  Our server arrived promptly to welcome us and provide water.  When he returned again we ordered our plates and some drinks.  Then we waited and waited at least 10 mins for our drinks.  We noticed that the table next to us also had a long wait for their drinks as well.  The bar and barstaff were busy for sure but waiting that long for drinks means that they should have another person helping.   \\n\\nWe ordered a few different plates.   The BLT wraps, very tasty, the deconstructed format and addition of pickled red onions was nice.  I love foie gras it's one of my favorite things to eat so whenever a menu offers it I will order.  I was disappointed with their offering here though.  I understand we eat with our eyes first but you also have to make the dish at least somewhat easy to eat.  Their foie gras dish looked nice but the piece of foie gras was to big for the small crostini it came on and it was WAY too oily.  I really wasn't able to enjoy it's taste due to it being so oily.  Black pepper pop overs were ok.  The pop overs tasted perfect but the waygu tartare lacked some seasoning.   Manti ravioli's were also just ok, the pasta was a bit thick but the filling was good.  Another dish we eat often is kalbi but this kalbi was off.  The flavor was too salty and my bf and I both said we think they used the wrong marinade on the meat.  That  was also a disappointment.  \\n\\nFor dessert we ordered the churro ice cream sandwich.  Again, eat with our eyes first but at least make it easy to eat.  The dessert came on a flat plate and as soon as we tried to break some churro all the ice cream just oozed out every side.  It was actually very annoying because the table next to us ordered the same dish and when they broke into theirs, it was as it should be where the bottom and top churro of the sandwich stayed intact.  So our dessert was either sitting out for a while to melt or the plate it was put on was too hot.  Rookie mistake.  \\n\\nOne last thing, when it came time to pay the bill I had a credit card ready.   The server sent over someone with the one of those wireless hand held devices that can run your card and then you select tip and sign.  Well that's pretty convenient but don't stand and wait right behind me while I fill it out.   The screen displays 3-4 calculated tip options along with one to manually enter.   I felt rushed to pay and sadly just chose the lowest tip option as it felt I needed to finish the transaction as quickly as possible.   A shame as I probably would have tipped better had it not felt like someone lurking over my shoulder.  \\n\\nOverall we probably wont go back.  Even though some dishes were very good and some were not the pricing was a bit high.  I'm happy to pay for quality and portion size but some of these dishes didn't seem to add up.  \\n\\nAs always never take my advice and give it a try yourself."},{"name":"Strip","address":"245 18th St","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3","text":"This place could be ok if they would remember what makes any place successful - it's customers.

I went there to introduce my family to banh mi because of the reviews mentioning their tofu banh mi. Notice to vegetarians and tofu fans, it's totally off menu, but they do have it.\\n\\nUnfortunately, in all of the hustle and bustle of the Saturday lunch crowd, they wrapped a chicken sandwich and marked it tofu, and wrapped a tofu sandwich and marked it chicken. We left with our to go order and divvied it up, but with vegetarian me getting a chicken sandwich and my omnivore mom getting my tofu. I was mildly apprehensive when I saw the chicken shreds on my sandwich, but my favorite Chicago banh mi joint has fake chicken on their lemongrass tofu, too, so I dove in. \\n\\nAnd then the flavor hit me and I realized what had happened. I was super upset because I haven't eaten meat in 8 years (for non-vegetarians, that means I pretty much don't make enzymes to break down meat anymore and eating it can make me pretty sick to my stomach). \\n\\nI spit out my sandwich, washed my mouth, and traded sandwiches with my mom and the rest of the experience was okay. I mean, I don't know what other options for banh mi Atlanta has, but I will say that Lee's was probably the blandest banh mi I've ever had. That's not a big deal, since I don't think banh mi can ever be bad (so long as you get the right sandwich) but it wasn't incredible by a long shot. I'd eat there again, if I were in Atlanta and in the mood, but I'd probably want to check out the competition first.\\n\\nThe other items (we got various rice based desserts, coconut juice, and some kind of cake thing my father bought) were tasty enough. But between the combo of the sandwich mix up, the lack of traditional Vietnamese options like salad rolls and cha, and the lackluster flavors in the banh mi, I was pretty disappointed."},{"name":"Mike's Pastry","address":"300 Hanover St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"Going to this pastry shop reminds me of a concert mosh pit gone wrong.

In fact, it's a little on the ghetto side, but that's how I've come to expect my pho places to be - at least the more authentic ones. Vietnamese places tend to rely mainly on their food to win customers, so while service at this place is pretty decent, don't take it personally if it isn't. Since moving here, I've learn to accept that I have to pay more for vietnamese food, which is a little difficult for me since I'm used to paying $5 for a solid bowl of pho and max $2.50 for a vietnamese sandwich (banh mi). Here, it's about $8. I've had their rice dishes as well, which are pretty good but it's easier to make those dishes well so I don't put too much weight on that. I believe their sandwiches are about $5, i've never had them but they are gigantic. \\n\\nI'm not crazy picky about my pho but I judge a good bowl of pho by the broth.

The food is well above average, but the service is so far below average, that the dining experience suffers as a result.  As good as the main course is, this review is based on the combination of offensive standard of service, as well as the unnecessary $9 side salads.\\n\\nI've been here a number of times.  From random nights, to $10 pasta night, to Christmas Eve.  I want to love this place, but it's an abusive relationship where I am consistently taken for granted.  If you want to eventually have a solid bowl of pasta, but feel like you're doing someone a favor in the process, get yourself to this place immediately.  If you would rather feel like you're appreciated and valued to an establishment, go somewhere else.  This isn't a service level problem.  The owner prances around shaking hands and kissing babies with his friends, but when you're in the process of dropping a few hundred bucks outside of his inner circle, you might as well be digging through the dumpster for scraps.  Actually, the service would be better out there as you have a better chance catching the waitstaff as they burn down a joint in the middle of dinner service.\\n\\nIf the management is reading this, take note: You have a lot of potential in your kitchen, but your front of the house is ruining everything.  Your food needs a little work (more garlic and a little spice wouldn't hurt), but your service staff is offensive.  Better restaurants in Dunwoody Village have not survived.  Keep this up and you are destined to join their ranks.

An associate of mine told me that of the local offerings, their broth was by far the best, and that's the most important part of the dish, and man was he right.\\n\\nIf you've never had pho, be prepared to have several different packages to combine for your treat.  You get a MASSIVE container of this unbelievably delicious broth, seasoned to perfection, and then another container with your various meats and noodles and vegetables.  Their noodles are great, and the variety of meats quite tasty (I always decline on the tripe and tendon; I'm adventurous, but have my limits).  Mix in some jalapenos, some freshly squeezed lime and then do everything in your power to not consume the entire gigantic offering in one sitting.  \\n\\nUGH, I am so mad at myself for writing this, because I am now craving it something fierce...  :sigh:  My own fault.

Lesson learned - twice.\\n\\n(1) It's a very good sign that they are out of something, and you don't find out until you go to place your order. This has happened to us 2 times now -- tonight they were out of lamb, chicken, bison, AND the spinach & arugula salad. Despite our instincts telling us to do otherwise, we waited in line for 15 mins only to find out that they were out of exactly what we went there for. Had we known when we arrived, we would have gone somewhere else (which is probably why they don't tell you sooner if they are out of something...they want to keep your business). Restaurants run out of things - I get it. But be up-front about it.\\n\\n(2) Normally, their parmesan fries with truffle aioli are de-li-cious and arrive at the table within 5-10 mins (max) of sitting down. After about 15 mins, our fries arrived and it was visually obvious that they were not fresh. They weren't hot, they were mushy and limp and just terrible. When a server whizzed past, we got her attention - told her about the fries - and she took them away and said she'd bring us a new order. No \\"Oh, I'm really sorry about that\\" (not a deal breaker, just not the usual customer service we're accustomed to at Hopdoddy). Fresh, piping hot fries arrived 10 minutes later and they were on-par with the quality we're used to.\\n\\n(3) I ended up ordering the Farmer's Market Salad with turkey ($14.50). The turkey patty was lukewarm and just looked meh. The salad greens (a mix of arugula, kale, and spring mix) were lifeless - not even a hint of a crunch when eaten. All of the toppings (pecans, apples, tomatoes, onion) were laying in the bottom of the bowl -- the greens just thrown on top. Nothing was tossed, nothing was made to look even remotely appetizing -- and they succeeded, because nothing was appetizing. I ate the protein and left everything else. It just was not good. \\n\\n(4) My husband's burger (The Primetime, $12.00) arrived cold and looked terrible. He said if we were at home, he would have definitely put it in the microwave. By this point, we were so disappointed with everything, he decided to not say anything and just eat it.\\n\\n(5) Complete lack of customer service. Not one person ever stopped by to see if we needed anything, how things were, nothing. Normally, the service here is great - everyone is super friendly, super attentive, and just nice and happy. Not tonight. Not one word from anyone. Usually, if you send something back to the kitchen, a manager may pop by your table to check in or whatever. Nope - no one, nothing.\\n\\nBefore we left, I thought about asking to speak to the manager...but I didn't want to make an issue and, frankly, we just wanted to get out of there and be done with it all. \\n\\nMaybe the other locations are better...hopefully, they are.

I'd order the bacon doughnut over and over again. That was my favorite. The dirty wu gets the hype, but I've had more creative flavors. Also, anything with sea salt tasted great as well!\\n\\nThey do have chai flights, but frankly, I was underwhelmed since they were a bit watered down and lacked that spicy punch I like in my chais -- maybe I am just old school.

Mother's will do separate checks and don't add the gratuity. Our server (Jason? He said he'd been there 13yrs) handled our 16 top in stride and didn't miss a beat. He was friendly the whole way and more than accommodating for dietary restrictions and even a baby.

We found it!  In addition to this, we found very friendly and prompt service.  The Korean waiter, maybe he was the owner I'm not sure, some how realized my wife was from Japan.  He smiled and began talking to her a little bit in Japanese.  This level of friendliness pleasantly surprised us as there can be some cultural animosity between Korean and Japanese people.   Generally I see respect, but not a friendliness that extends to trying to converse in the other's language.   It made me want to shake his hand when I saw him do this.  \\n\\nThe food was the real deal.  It's not the best we've ever had by any stretch, but it is the best we've had in Portland since moving from LA where there is a massive Korean contingent serving the most amazing Korean fare.  The Hae Rim menu really made us happy too, the only thing we didn't like is that we weren't hungry enough to try 4 or 5 different things each to see what's best.  We had simple Bibimbap and Yukgaejang soup.  I also really liked the potato's they served in the small plates that came with our order.   All of it was good, but I don't think we've tried their best yet.  \\n\\nIn summary, this review is may be a bit preliminary, but I felt compelled to write a positive Yelp due to the very friendly and attentive service my wife and I received.  The food we did try passed as \\"real\\" Korean that Koreans would eat and not complain about I'm sure.   :)   It's worth coming here.  I just wish they were closer to my office.

The flavors we ended up with were as follows: The Cointreau Cr√®me Brul√©, Blueberry Bourbon Basil, Varhona Chocolate Crunch, Real Maple Bacon, Orange Olive Oil, and Pumpkin Pie. Sadly, every flavor of the buttermilk old-fashioned donuts were sold out upon our arrival :( I will say my first impression of these donuts was love at first sight. The second I tasted my first bite, I'd have to say it wasn't so. It was a very underwhelming experience. I'm not sure if it has to do with the location, and it not being as busy as some of the others (or something? Maybe?), but the overall texture of these donuts (raised, cake and cream-filled) was on the dry side. The cream-filled donuts weren't as bad (Cr√®me Brul√©, Varhona Chocolate), given they obviously weren't as dry. The Varhona Chocolate was actually quite tasty. I found the dark chocolate flavor paired with a vanilla custard-type cream and its chocolate crunch topping to result in a very delicious concoction. Highly recommended for chocolate lovers. I can't say as much for any of the others. They were good, and very pretty to look at, but looking back on the experience I'll say they looked better than they tasted. And for nearly $4 a pop, I'm not so sure it was worth it. I do however, have a feeling the buttermilk old-fashioned donuts sellout quick for a reason, so if I'm ever near and have a craving for a fried overpriced treat there's an 85% chance I will seek out the Varhona Chocolate and an Old-fashioned at this place.

We asked the server if we could join the tables , but the manager flat out refused to let us do that... \\nWe waited for our table to be cleaned- yes, it still had the left over plates from previous customers. The server cleaned one table and we had to keep calling them to clean the other one.... then started the long wait for the menu and complimentary chips and salsa... we had to literally get up and go look for the manager to get started, he said he is taking care of it... but still 40 Minutes since we were seated and that too after letting them know that the kids were very hungry, nobody showed up .. we looked around, and the people who had come after us had already started getting their food, and we were completely neglected... finally one of us went looking for a manager again, and found his boss, who said he was going to expedite our order due to the delay... we gave our order, but again had to keep enquiring till they brought the expedited order 40 minutes later... \\n\\nBottom line - STAY AWAY FROM THIS PLCE"},{"name":"Ricky's All Day Grill","address":"Evergreen Mall, 8958 152nd Street","city":"Surrey","stars":"3","text":"Stopped by for a work lunch event & they accommodated us with a large room at the back.

The place is small, homey, and friendly.  The staff are delightful. The food is outstanding. Four of us ate ourselves stupid for about $60. They had escabeche which is different types of meat cooked and finished in vinegar--I had fish and my esposo had chicken. We tried the calamari appetizer which was the only so-so dish. The ceviche appetizer was killer though. My daughter had a breaded steak which closely resembled what I call chicken fried steak but better--hearty breading and a melt-in-your-mouth tender steak. Her fries were delish too; not for anyone watching calories but amazing. The restaurant is behind Simpatico--across from Gresham HS.  Don't go looking for a burrito and chips.

So in an attempt to dispel any rumors that said management lined my pockets with C-notes in order to get me to speak so highly of them I will say one, count it, one bad thing about Umami Mia Pizzeria, the relatively new Italian joint at 1500 Barton Springs Road. There's nothing overly luxurious about the booth seating. It's unwind worthy but you can't stretch out. There, I just proved I'm not lobbying to become a future stockholder. Now I can get on with the important business of telling you people, foodies, or otherwise, how worthy Umami Mia Pizzeria is of your time, money, and primed palate.\\nThe decor is very get down to business with a cement floor plan, and cutesome crannies revealing decorative seltzer bottles filled with a rainbow of colors to contribute an exquisite brand of European flair. The yellow stripe found on the table tops reminds me of the familiar yellow line found on roadways. The go go motif is prevalent throughout the waitstaff and the vibrant top 40 variety of music playing overhead. Umami is quite proud of its sustainable business practices. You'll learn all you ever wanted to know on that score simply by printing out a PDF copy of the menu as I did in preparation for this review. They use all natural ingredients, employing a farm-to-pizza business model, working in partnership with Vital Farms Eggs. They practice both composting and recycling as part of their commitment to the environment. Umami is natural, local, and damn proud of it. \\nI was fascinated to learn that umami is one of the five basic tastes, this one known for its savory nature. My delectable three-course feast for the senses deftly played to the advantage of all five of them. For openers the house salad passed the generosity test. It's served in a fairly small blue bowl with an outer space pattern twinkling off of it. Kind of brings to mind Saturday morning cartoons and Alpha Bits commercials, but  I'll wax nostalgic on that if I get around to reviewing a joint with a breakfast focus. The relative daintiness of the bowl's size should not be allowed to fool you. The brown butter croutons are massive. I've tasted crunchier but that's offset by the comforting smoothness of the butter. They're sweeter than most of the other croutons I've had at both upscale and casual restaurants. That butter is as reassuring as if your Grandma was in the kitchen blending it in herself. Light crunch, but not absent from the experience. The greens, stems still on were heavy on healthy color. Not a trace of limp lettuce strands that could've been pilfered from any one of  number of neighborhood grocery stores. Quite a bed of greens, although no real discernible flavor. Just unapologetic nutrients that anchor the overall quality of this salad. Big thumbs up for the cherry tomatoes. Excellent peak of ripeness juicy. They lend eye appeal but don't slug it out with the lettuce or croutons for your attention. These tomatoes don't suffer from self-esteem issues and with a bountiful flavor like they have, why should they? Lastly, the parmesan cheese was strewn over the top like streamers at a child's birthday party. Delicate both from a taste and a visual arts perspective. That the taste wasn't overpowering impressed me. That blended ideally when tossed in the same ring with the animated tomatoes and burly lettuce. Somebody's got to settle for the supporting role, right? The parmesan contributed the right dimension of tang without swallowing up the contributions of the other salad components. \\nThe mushroom pizza was pretty to look at as well as to taste. That balsamic reduction drizzle elevated the pie to the status of gorgeous, much like a stylized birthday cake would. The crust was just crispy enough to be aesthetically joyous. The roasted mushrooms and roasted garlic were playfully zippy. The goat cheese packed a solid punch. Jeff, my server, deserves much thanks for patience, friendliness, helpfulness, and ready recommendation of the Nutella no-bake chocolate cheesecake I rounded out the meal with. Served in a Mason jar it was a wonderful culinary exclamation point. \\nIf Umami Mia's doesn't have a sizable following by year's end that would be a shame. First class staff + first class pizza deserves out of the box success."},{"name":"STIR Restaurant & Bar","address":"1409 N Orange Ave","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"The ambiance was amazing!

I went pretty much right when it opened so there was really no line to order, but everything is made freshly when you order, so it's not the quickest process if you are in a hurry. Expect to wait maybe 10-15 min from when you order to when you get the goods. The price is reasonable since everything is fresh and delicious. You can get four donuts for $3.25, 6 for $4.25, eight for $5.25, and a dozen for $6.25.\\n\\nThe donuts are mini ones, so you can eat about 4-6 of them and it's the equivalent of a large donut. I like it because then you can try more flavors - they had 6 of them when I went. I liked them in this order: Cinnamon Sugar, Honey & Sea Salt, Maple Bacon, Nutella, Dirty Wu (Cinnamon Sugar with Nutella Drizzle), and Blueberry Rose. The donuts are about the size of a mini Hostess Donette, and I think the saying \\"less is more\\" rings true here. They were all delicious, but I liked the simpler ones because it allowed the freshness of the batter / donut flavor. The maple bacon was one of the better bacon-infused desserts, with a decent amount of bacon on top of the donut, and not just bacon flavoring or tiny bits of bacon. I ordered a dozen mini donuts (2 of each of the 6 flavors), and ate half of them right there. I saved the other half to take home to my boyfriend and we warmed them up for a few minutes in the oven before eating and they were delicious.\\n\\nThey have a variety of chai teas, and even a chai tea sampler so that you can try all the flavors. I got the Campfire Chai and loved it - super unique: smokey and delicious. It pairs well with the donuts, and I highly recommend getting one.\\n\\nThey open at 8 am so you can go early for breakfast. I got up early to come here before heading to the airport for a 10 am flight, and it was an excellent idea. Highly recommend coming here if you're in Portland.

I think the reviewer who said it's made with the Butter Chicken gravy is correct, because butter is all I tasted.  I am a failure at cooking indian food, and when I cook it, this is how it tastes.  The pakori chatt was so grainy and under-seasoned, and with flavorless yogurt on top, it was inedible.  Think balls of Playdoh in milk.  Aloo gobhi was oh-so coriander-rific, we left it on the tray where it lay.\\n  We both enjoyed the tandoori chicken, it was the best-seasoned item we were served.

We arrived to be astonished to see how they transformed the space, it is cute, inviting, and a 180 from the way it was before. We were greeted by a lovely lady behind the counter. She handed us menus and told us we ordered at the counter and they brought the food out to our seats. We immediately noticed that they served espresso drinks and open at 8am!!

We paid using and iPad terminal that worked very well and allowed us to tip, and then found a table. 8-10 minutes of conversation about the transformation and how we hoped College Park and East Point would continue their upswing, our food arrived. First off it looked delicious(and it was), but the sheer amount of food that we were given was overwhelming. Ok back to the taste...the hummus, tzatziki, and melitzanosalata (eggplant) dips were all so delicious and fresh. Here is the part I have to be honest on and it will not sound like a typical American (land of the buffets) gripe, the portions were too large, the wraps were awkward to handle because they were STUFFED with ingredients. I only say this because I want this restaurant to stick around. They could serve half the portions for the same price and it would still be a value! I will say I could not get over how well they toasted the pita, it was perfection! I will say that I will not get the dips and the veggie wrap together again, just because the wrap contains hummus too and I would not want to overload on it. The hummus was amazing, but to have it as a main and a starter was more than I could handle(my fault, not theirs). I know this weekend my partner and I will be back even if just to grab a coffee or snack, but I do know we will be having more meals there very often.

Lambert's was very close by, so we decided to try it out.  \\n\\nAt first we were concerned because all they were serving at the time (3:30 or 4pm) was a small bar menu, but we found some things that sounded good to order.  My husband got the barbecue plate with brisket, collard greens, and potato salad.  I ordered the brisket sandwich with waffle fries instead of potato salad.\\n\\nWe also ordered drinks.  No alcohol prices were listed, which is always annoying.  My husband ordered a Guinness and I had a Mexican Coke and red wine cocktail that I don't remember the name of.  The Guinness was good and my cocktail was tasty as well (kinda similar to sangria), but I was disappointed by the size of my drink, which was in a tall thin glass crammed with ice.  I'd assumed it might actually contain a normal wine serving since wine was the only alcohol in it ... definitely a drink for lightweights, not cool for $8.  Yes, you heard me right, my drink was $8 and my husband's was $8.50.  Jeez.\\n\\nOur food was great, though.  My brisket sandwich was literally the best I'd ever had (and I'm a native Texan who's eaten a lot of brisket).  It was somewhat messy and greasy, but totally worth it.  The sauce was great, and I even liked the onion/pickle/jalapeno relish it was topped with, though it was quite spicy.  The fries were fine, kind of a small portion though.  My husband liked his food as well.  Again, a bit smaller of a portion than one would get at most barbecue places, but very good brisket.  His collard greens were also awesome and bacon-y.  We were also impressed by the 3 house-made sauces that were provided at the table, especially the mustard-y one.  \\n\\nWe might go back sometime, probably for lunch because the dinner menu doesn't look all that great to me, and $38 was enough to pay for what we got, even with the best brisket sandwich ever."},{"name":"3 Country Bistro","address":"379 Main St","city":"Woburn","stars":"4.5","text":"When you come to this restaurant these people treat you like family and their food is delicious.

Great place to sip a cup of coffee and mingle with a really hip friend......:) I've never had bad service here and food wise pretty everything you order is good.

I do not recommend this place for a family. Seating is very uncomfortable. As soon as we found a table we were considering leaving because the seating is very bad.

It can be at times far too loud even at brunch which is why I can't give it 5 stars but the music selection is really good so I get over it quickly. The best thing on the brunch menu is the Bacon Avocado Benny. Its insane and the roasted tomato is seasoned so perfectly it should be served all day. With the exception of the volume for brunch I hope that it doesn't change because its a real gem in this area of North Van. I should say that I've seen a whole variety of people dining here especially at brunch. I appreciated that in the evenings when the live music gets going and people are drinking that everyone seems to keep it together. People are socializing and enjoying the music.

On top of the quality of the wing, they pack some amazing flavor & the hot brings some decent heat. Their free ranch dressing brings some nice mix to the flavors & temp. The piece of bread is a nice touch as it absorbs some great flavor, and prevents you from feeling the need to lick what remains in the container.\\n\\nSide of Mac and cheese was a over average for sure.

The two times that I went to Kona Grill were both during reverse happy hour times. I didn't think that choosing Kona Grill was a great idea for a date, but I was definitely wrong. (Maybe because I prefer a social location where I can kick back and laugh rather than a quaint and romantic restaurant.) It's pretty loud at night but the aura of the restaurant is so welcoming. Go with friends. Go on a date. I'm already craving to go there again! So here was my experience...\\n\\nI will start with the parking and and the situating. Parking wasn't hard to find, but finding an open seat at the bar or outdoor patio was a b****. The first time around, my friends and I didn't have trouble finding a seat at the bar since it was a Monday night, but Friday night... Jeez! Definitely tested my patience. We finally 'snatched' seats at the bar after practically stalking for departing diners. So if you are considering to go to Kona Grill for happy hour, arrive before happy hour times or go during the earlier days of the week. \\n\\nNow service. Obviously, for a crowded location, waiters don't come around your table as often because they've got their hands all tied up. Honestly, there shouldn't be any complaints because I feel they do a fantastic job of taking orders and serving the food within a reasonable time frame. They are also very friendly and often tend to your empty glasses. I did sit at the bar though, so I was able to get attention from the bartenders themselves.\\n\\nFood. At happy hour prices, the sushi is real good. I personally recommend the Spicy Tuna Roll, the Atlantic Roll, and the Crab Crunch Roll. I DO NOT recommend the Fiery Shrimp Roll (tasteless). For appetizers, I've ordered the potstickers and Kona Calamari. Both were great only during happy hour prices. Other than sushi, I also ordered the Margherita Pizza, which was delish! It's got the gourmet/homemade taste and texture to it. \\n\\nDrinks. I had myself a Ladies Margarita once and a Miller Lite on tap during the second visit. Great prices. Great drinks. :) I kind of wish their menu was bigger just so I can try their other menu items, but having to pay only $22 (for 2) for all that food and drinks was really worth it. \\n\\nSo like I said before, I can't wait to be back there!

Once the bar was full I saw a manager walk behind the bar go to both of the computers and then speak with Emily.  He then left and was not seen again until later that day.

Never have I ever had the worst dining experience in my entire life up until last night. Our waiter (JOHN) was the utmost disgusting, rudest, and pompous individual I have ever met. He never properly introduced himself when greeting us and never asked us what we wanted for beverages. Instead he assume we wanted water and bread without a peep out of his mouth. I kindly asked for lemon and before I was able to order a cocktail he cut me off and said \\"sure, I'll get you lemon\\" then quickly left. By that awkward moment my friend and I decided to just settle for water since clearly he couldn't let us order drinks. \\n\\nWhen he came back with my lemon he asked us if we were ready to order. I was extremely frustrated, but bit my tongue and ordered. My friend requested if she could have the chicken Bellagio, but instead with the Louisiana chicken and his response \\"So you want fried chicken...\\" with an unwelcoming tone. This was uncalled for and instead of stating the obvious he could've addressed it politely and with no attitude that way we could of had a better understanding. \\n\\nInstead of leaving or requesting a new server we decided to deal with his sour personality. We proceeded to order and got 2 appetizers and 1 entree . In the past the server normally asks us if we would like the order to come out together. This man was so quick to cut us off again that we never got a chance to even ask. \\n\\nHe came back to drop off appetizer plates and basically slammed it on our table. He came back to drop off the 2 appetizers and not once asked us how everything was. Then before the entree even arrived he didn't bother to pick up the unused dirty plates. Eventually I just stacked the plates together thinking he could take a hint. Correct me if I am wrong, but EVERY TIME I get pasta they offer parmesan, but no he didn't. We didn't even bother to ask and didn't want to hunt down our waiter who clearly doesn't want to be there. \\n\\nWe barely even spoke to him throughout the entire evening. Again, he never asked us how our entree was either. He came back to the table again to give us water when we didn't need it because our cups were practically full. My friend kindly said \\"Sir, would you please remove these plates.\\" HE CUT HER OFF of course and said \\"YEAH, CAN I GIVE YOU WATER FIRST CAN I DO THIS FIRST!\\" I was at disbelief of what was going on and instead of grabbing the dirty plates he instead grabbed the appetizer plate with food still on it that we were STILL WORKING ON. I didn't know what he was mad about, but he took the blame on us. We were so upset we didn't even want to continue to talk to this man so we let him grab whatever he wanted that was in front of us. \\n\\nAt this point we couldn't take it anymore we were livid! He came back again and said to my friend \\"Are you still working on that?\\" mind you she didn't have a single thing on her plate. We knew he was being a sarcastic jerk. She said \\"Well what am I working on there's nothing on my plate.\\" He didn't deserve a kind response so we gave him a little taste of his own medicine. He proceeds to ask if he can take it while being a smart alec. \\n\\nFinally he called a manager for us so we could complain about the horrendous service. She asked us if everything was okay. Clearly not. Everything was far from okay. We explained to her what had happened. She asked if we wanted a different server and we said yes. We both came out for a nice dinner so we never let his poor service ruin our evening until the moment he decided to argue with us about removing the plates from before. Midway through the evening we still didn't even know his name. After speaking to the manager he didn't even bother to come and apologize. As we left we saw him laugh at us. He was not only a terrible server, but he's a bully who is clearly not right for hospitality. No one should ever have to endure or feel as horrible as this man made us feel.

The peel and eat shrimp seemed to have been cooked with no seasoning, the crab claws decent, and the smoked salmon was good.

We traveled from New York to universal and this was one of the only places I was excited to try. It was our first night in \\"town.\\" Universal doesn't really have great dining options. Chains... generic... blah blah blah\\nBut, since it was my birthday i knew I wanted a special dessert from here. \\nWe didn't eat dinner here so after we ate we came over and got our buzzer to wait. \\nThe hostess asked \\"outside or first available.\\" I said \\"first available\\" while thinking \\"why would anyone want to sit outside when it's so cool looking in here.\\" \\nWe wait 45 mins go inside to wait another five mins and we get seated outside. Then I realized that the hostess had duped me because no one would want to sit outside. All the ambience is inside. Oh well, let it go, it's about the dessert. Right? \\nOut comes our server... nice, but obviously he is busy. We don't waste his time. We are here for dessert. My husband and I order coffee. I almost order the flan caramel sundae Bc I love flan but server informs me it's not actually flan inside the sundae is more like caramel cheesecake. Thank you server! I would have been disappointed.\\nWe get two might contain nuts sundaes, a banana split sundae, and the 5 times chocolate shake. The server rushes away and when he was passing by again my husband tells him (openly in front of me) that it was my birthday and asks for whatever would come with that. \\nThe coffee comes... it's terrible. Grey. Terrible. Don't get it. Comes out in a French press carafe. Don't bother... it was made two days prior I think.\\nWe wait ... out comes the dessert. Plopped down by a busboy. No candle. No nothing. \\nFamily sitting down to $50 dessert at this \\"amazing place\\" And nada. \\nMove on... dig in. We start eating the waiter comes by and asks if everything is ok and my husband mentions \\"we never got the candle.\\" He apologizes and goes to get one but I stop him Bc I've already dug in. He is like \\"ok. Sorry about that but it's not like we would have sang or anything.\\" So.. just know that. There is no bells and whistles for your birthday here. \\nI'm a pretty simple person. Mom of two kids. My birthdays are pretty non existent. I would have liked a candle. And let me tell you if I was younger I would have like a hand clap and a song or something by the staff. What's the point in being one of these places if you don't make yourself a place that's a little extra fun on your birthday!?\\nNone of the desserts were finished. They were two big and just too much to handle. Overloaded with the theme of the sundae. My son who is like a garbage disposal for sweets couldnt handle all the peanut butteriness of his sundae. My 9 year old who got the chocolate milkshake drank only half of his. I tried it and it was like drinking Hershey's through a straw. Then he woke up and threw up multiple times (all chocolate by the way) that night. \\nOverall sooooo disappointed.\\nTip:     \\n1. Sit inside! \\n2.

If you like Greek food, this is the place to go! The service is fantastic (place wasn't too busy, though). Our server was Laurie. We decided to sit in the bar, which was a few degrees cooler than the restaurant area. They finally got smart and lowered the shades which are on the outside of the building (huh?!?). A couple of the booths actually had TVs mounted on the wall. Sorry, I can do that at home. Of course, to chime in with the others, the decor is reminiscent of Juan Colorado, but I think that if they get more business, they'll be able to update. Nevertheless, I'm a huge Greek food fan and was very glad to find this place so close to home! \\n\\nThey have a full bar, but also have sodas (the usual suspects) and Crater Lake sodas. Creme Soda, orange, and root beer.  The Creme soda was very good. \\n\\nFirst, we had the Spanakopites as an appetizer, fantastic! The crust was very tender and flaky. And it was 4 very large pieces. \\n\\nThen came the salads, which were perfect - no wilted lettuce & nice thick slices of cucumbers and 2 large wedges of firm tomatoes. When I asked for extra bleu cheese dressing, boy did I get extra! Brent asked for, and cheerfully got, a Greek salad as a substitute. Also wonderful. \\n\\nI ordered the Dolmathes for dinner. The grape leaves were nice and tender and, while tasty by itself, was even better with lemon. Brent had the Mediterranean Chicken. The chicken was a nice, thick piece, yet cooked all the way through and tender. \\nThe side of veggies were cooked to perfection, not over cooked and soggy, and not undercooked and difficult to chew and they didn't need any butter, either. The rice, regrettably, was really bland. Will have to try the garlic mashed potatoes next time. \\n\\nNext, came dessert.  Of course, we had the Baklava. I think I died and went to heaven. It was marvelous! The serving size was humongous! Not that itty, bitty corner of the stuff. It filled the appetizer plate! The server told me about the choclava, so I ordered a piece to take home. She brought it and said, \\"On the house. Take it home and enjoy.\\" Wow! I'm sure I will!\\n\\nThen I was fortunate enough to meet the chef, an older Greek man named \\"Denny\\". What a great guy! He actually offered to buy drinks! \\n\\nWe are definitely coming backend hope that more of you who read this will go and find out what a true enjoyment Greek food really is.\\n\\nPS - They also offer American food. If it's as good as the Greek food, you'll be in heaven. *Sigh* See my photos of the food.\\n\\nUpdate: After our fabulous meal last night, then on to play some 8-ball, we got home and climbed into bed. I'm writing reviews and thinking about the Chocolate Baklava (aka Choclava) that I brought home last night that is calling to me. Nancy... Naaaaaaaaaancy! \\n\\nI can't stand it any more and go get it. What a truly fantastic wee hours treat! It really didn't look like there was much chocolate on or in it, but WOW! does it have big chocolate flavor! Here's the kicker, not enough to drown out the flavor of the Baklava! How does that happen? \\n\\nThe chef is very talented, that's how. He was dressed in his chef's coat when he came out. Alas, no toque, LOL.

Lately I've been going there just for happy hour- appetizers are 1/2 off and there are smaller drink specials. The appetizers are such that you can pretty much make a meal of the happy hour (but of course nothing like the porterhouse is available...) and the drinks are usually inventive and fairly strong, albeit not much cheaper than regular prices.\\nI went last thursday and enjoyed the fried shrimp (very good), deviled eggs (I think they're over-rated) and queso & chips (completely indistinguishable to any other queso I've had in Austin). \\n\\nMy only complaint (and the only thing keeping me from giving them 5 stars) is that sometimes the upstairs bar is closed for a private function, and there is no notice about it on their website. This has happened at least twice in the past 6 or 8 months or so, including this past Thursday when I planned to meet a couple of people upstairs to see the band listed on their website as playing that night.

Try parking in the B&N lot right next to it and it's a short hop to the restaurant.\\n\\nComing up in line you will see large windows with chefs chopping produce, baking, and doing cooking type things which is pretty neat in my book.  The restaurant itself is gorgeous as well.\\n\\nYou will wait in line and order your food at a counter, then take a seat with a number.  Or, you can sit at the bar if there is any spots and they'll take your order right there.  That's what we always do.\\n\\nThe prices look steep, but the tips are included in the price - so don't tip extra!  Also, the ingredients are fresh (as if the chefs working didn't prove it to you) and I've literally never had anything bad here.  Pretend you're not ordering at the counter, and you will find quality like this at much higher end (and more expensive) restaurants.  Just do be aware of the price if you're just popping in for a quick dinner.\\n\\nNow for the food.  I have tried two things here: the burger and breakfast.\\n\\nI consider myself a burger snob, so it's not the best I've ever had but it IS very good.  You can tell the ingredients are quality - nice bun, nice thick burger usually cooked appropriately.  I think I remember their fries being shoestring and DELICIOUS.\\n\\nFor beverages, they have an array of beer, real-sugar sodas, and even different kinds of water!  Although the \\"ambient\\" water makes us giggle every time.\\n\\nIf you come here on Sundays their menu is brunch, with the \\"brunch\\" being fairly limited; it's mostly breakfast.  But that's okay!  You can get the burger for brunch you know!\\n\\nI opted to go for something different and ordered a breakfast sandwich with sausage and a ricotta pancake.\\n\\nThe pancake.  Oh man.  It was AWESOME.  You can get a side or a whole order.  Next time I may just get a whole order.  The \\"ricotta\\" kind of threw me off, but it just ended up tasting like a regular pancake only more delicious.\\n\\nThe breakfast sandwich was pretty good too, but so big I couldn't eat it with my hands.  Still, you could tell the biscuit was house-made and everything just had a fresh taste to it.\\n\\nI also got a smoothie...strawberry.  Holy moly they're sort of expensive (about $4.5 for something that isn't huge).  My husband hated the flavor but I was in LOVE.  Just be aware the yogurt gives it a snappy tang (you can get it without yogurt, I'm pretty sure) so it may not be to your liking.\\n\\nI gotta admit...I have tried the chocolate truffle cookie and really wasn't that impressed."},{"name":"Black Angus Steakhouse","address":"7516 W Irlo Bronson Memorial Hwy","city":"Kissimmee","stars":"3.5","text":"This was a great place to eat while on vacation at Disney.

Though my food was tasty, I'm less impressed than I expected based on the other reviews. Logistically, the restaurant had many positives; the menu is straightforward, the line moved quickly, iced tea and ranch are free (what a dream!), and the price point is fair considering the sharable portions. The chicken was crispy on the outside and tender on the inside, and the mac and cheese was rich and gooey. \\n\\nWith that being said, I was disappointed by my meal's overall flavor and the spiciness of the chicken. I ordered 'hot' instead of 'holy' (the next level up and hottest option available) because the sign says that 'medium' is hotter than the average medium. I regretted my choice after one bite. My chicken didn't bring the heat of the average plate of wings, much less a food boasting its spice. If you're a lover of spicy food, I'd definitely opt for holy! Moreover, the mac and cheese was good, but beyond the flavor from the fat in the cheese, there wasn't much to it. I'm never going to complain about carbs covered in cheese, but I expected more from a restaurant that includes the dish in its basic concept.

If you can't read a thing on the menu other than 'nachos', just talk to the cashier. Perhaps you want a beef burrito? No problem -- just order that. You want something you won't find at Taco Bell? Just point to something and ask 'What is this?' -- it's bound to be good, whatever it is. The reason there aren't any menus in English is that almost all their customers speak Spanish. This is a Good Thing.\\n\\nI had a tamarind drink to go with my bean burrito; Jodi had a cinnamon rice milk (horchata) to go with her chicken burrito. She ended up swiping my drink because she liked it so much. \\n\\nThe salsa bar is an arsenal full of various implements of destruction. Carrots marinated with jalapenos, green sauces that look like watery guacamole but pack more of a punch, and (my favorite) a red sauce with lots of fresh herbs in it. Couldn't tell you what it's called, though.\\n\\nFor a buck, try a beverage you've never heard of before. There's plenty of them, and you'll want something to cool your mouth off as you experiment with the salsas. Horchata is the best for this. Seriously.\\n\\nPro tip: 'tacos' are soft.

I usually grab a combination banh mi, a mixture or Asian cold cuts, or the BBQ pork joint to-go. I can say that the banh mis are good but not the best. The bread can sometimes be very hard and dense.Not really a big deal when they stuff lots of meats in between. They are pretty generous with the meats. Although, I'm not a big fan of the chicken one. The diced up chicken breast meats is a bit too dry for my taste.\\n\\nI have never sat down and eaten anything but the banh mi until today. After a long night of partying, my friends and I yearned for something to sooth an irritable stomach. They got pho. Me being the oddball out per usual, I opted for the combination pork congee. This bowl of deliciousness consisted of rice porridge filled with pork innards such as intestines, liver, and pork blood jello (coagulated pork's blood). The verdict? Portion was generous. Congee was a little too liquidy, not enough rice for me. I'm Chinese so I'm used to thicker congee so I don't hold that against them. Overall, very tasty. \\n\\nNow that I've sampled more than just the sandwiches I can honestly give Lee's 4 on food alone. What drops their rating down to a 3/3.5 is their service. They are severely understaffed for the volume of customers they have. The owners need to establish a better system to serve their guests. When guests pay, they simply ask what that ate and ring up orders based on what guests tell them.

The staff has always been super friendly and the outdoor patio and theatre is really neat to browse around."},{"name":"Pip's Original Doughnuts & Chai","address":"4759 NE Fremont St, Ste C","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"It is as good as they say.

Many lunch specials are on the gluten free menu. The boneless chicken was very mild in flavor. There is a bit of heat but the flavors are not complex. \\n\\nMenu:\\nThere are are many gluten free dishes on the menu. The boneless chicken curry contains a good amount of vegetables such as eggplant, bell pepper, green beans, carrots and even okra. The actual curry sauce was a bit thin. The lunch special comes with a side of rice. Unfortunately there was a hard lump of undercooked rice in my meal.\\n\\nService: \\nFast and friendly. I ordered takeout. My server said it would take 20 mins but it took 10 minutes. Maybe I misheard :)\\n\\nVenue:\\nVery cozy interior with beautiful artwork.

Pizza is excellent, love the crispy mozzarella and the fresh mozzarella salad.  Sausage and peppers was greasy but really tasty and I really love the mushroom and the margherita pizzas.  I've enjoyed this place for drinks and dinner with friends and with my family.  The patio is outstanding for dining al dente (fans and misters/heaters) and the inside is done really well.

The marzipan looked hella pretty but i think 3 pieces of dessert was enough as i had a boston creme puff also.  \\n\\ni heard this place was pretty notorious for their lines, but i got lucky and there was no line at all. just walked in and there was a few people but the employees working the counter seemed to outnumber the customers at the time i was there."},{"name":"Mother‚Äôs Bistro & Bar","address":"121 SW 3rd Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"Great place started out as a small little space they have expanded.

Once the rest of the group arrived we were greeted again, had drink orders taken, etc. The wait staff was very speedy yet patient as we ignored the menu's due to catching up and saying goodbye to a friend that was relocating. \\n\\nOverall the menu covers a little bit of everything from comfort foods to basic salads and burgers. I enjoyed a sandwich with pesto which is a LOVE of mine, and we had the tots to share in addition to our curly fries that came with out entrees.

(The long lines should be an indicator of how GOOD it is!)\\nBy being aggressive in pushing my way through the lines, I've scored eclairs, cannolis, and slices of cake.  The strawberry shortcake is my favorite since it's light in texture.  The cannolis are diverse and delicious!  And the eclairs are heavenly.  They also serve gelato, an added bonus!  Their espresso is served in a little cup complete with a sugar stick that melts, thus adding sweetness to the drink.\\nI've always manuveured my way through the lines by avoiding the center lines."},{"name":"Kona Grill","address":"11410 Century Oaks Ter","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"We were staying at the Westin in Austin and did a little shopping.\\nKona is conveniently located there. \\n\\nWe did enjoy it there.

That is the Oasis. Imagine the revenue possibility if you served good food?!?! Seems like a no brainer to me. The food was absolutely horrible. We had shrimp and beef fajitas, nasty rice, and disgusting (charro) beans. Most of the food in our party did not get eaten. The fried shrimp platter with fries was soo freakin greasy and fries were just as greasy. If youre looking for quality food, this isnt the place, nor is it worth it."},{"name":"Clover BLV","address":"6 Harvard St","city":"Brookline","stars":"3.5","text":"We went to this Clover location on Sunday evening to try their Impossible Meatball sub. We were a little thrown off by the fact that there was no seating, but we figured it was because this location was more of a take out setting. We put our stuff down at the standing table in the back and ordered our 2 sandwiches and 2 rosemary fries. One of my favorite things about Clover is that they have seltzer (my absolute favorite beverage) on tap! In just a couple minutes, our food was ready. I still can't believe that the Impossible Meatball sub wasn't real meat. It tasted nearly indistinguishable from a traditional meatball. The sauce was flavorful and the pecorino cheese was a nice touch. I highly recommend this sandwich. It's great for vegetarians, vegans (if you skip the cheese), and meat lovers. \\n\\nThe rosemary fries are a necessity. When you order them, they do not skimp on delivering big rosemary flavor with crispy fries that are a bit healthier. \\n\\nAdditionally, the 2 staff members working there (Brookline location at around 6:30 Sunday, December 3rd!) were awesome! We talked with them for a bit and they made the experience even more enjoyable. I hope you see this or the restaurant lets you know that you guys are great employees. I saw their interactions with all the customers that came in and they were equally as enthusiastic and friendly.\\n\\nI've told all my co-workers they need to try the Impossible Meatball sub and you should too!"},{"name":"Mike's Pastry","address":"300 Hanover St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"The store is located in downtown's Little Italy, and it was packed just as all the yelpers advertised.\\nThe line goes all the way out to the street and around the corner!\\n\\nI ordered an espresso cannoli, and I must say that I enjoy how the clerks pronounced the word \\"cannoli\\" more than the actual food. It was the ultimate Boston Italian accent I yearned for as a tourist.\\n\\nNow back to the food: the crust for the cannoli was crispy and the filling was pretty sweet and espresso-y, just the way I like it. \\n\\nI would say I like it, but probably not love it due to the fact the cannoli didn't blow me away and the restaurant was so extremely busy!"},{"name":"Mad Hatter","address":"969 Washington St","city":"Weymouth","stars":"4","text":"It was our first time in MA and we were driving from Boston to Plymouth.

I wasn't sure what to expect, as sometimes these restaurants in touristy areas (in this case, Universal City Walk) end up being a big let down. However, I can honestly say that this place delivered on every level! From the steampunk theming and decor, to the fabulous service, to the perfect cocktails (not too sweet and definitely alcohol-based), to the incredible food and  milkshakes...everything was fabulous! They don't take reservations, but our wait was less than an hour. They have a candy store onsite for you to peruse while waiting for your table featuring every kind of sweet treat imaginable, plus macarons, themed clothing, and steampunk accessories. This is the perfect place to come to celebrate a birthday or special occasion with your family and kids. Another huge plus is that you can come in for dessert only. Rather than waiting for a table, you can visit their dessert room which offers counter service where you can order whichever tantalizing treat is calling your name! A fun experience for the whole family, with amazing food and cocktails!!!"},{"name":"El Inka","address":"8560 SE DIVISiON St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"This place is a true treasure.

I haven't been to Peru but you can tell the authenticity of their dishes.  Yes, the chicken is tender and juicy and healthy but the ceviche is excellent as is the fresh juices, desserts and vegetarian options.  It's an all round memorable experience.  Thank you, El Inka!"},{"name":"Ray's on the River","address":"6700 Powers Ferry Rd","city":"Sandy Springs","stars":"4","text":"The fillet Mignon  was delicious, BBQ shrimp is some of my favorite and the  calamari is just okay.

I also ordered the veggie (since this was recommended by the waiter over the pork) egg rolls. \\n\\nThe food was served up in a reasonable manner. The egg rolls were meh- I shoulda tried the pork. The fried rice and beef was pretty decent. Pretty much it is shaking beef - comes with the same salt, pepper, and lime. I have had better elsewhere, but the meat was very juicy. So that was great. The portion size was very fair. Service was horrible. We were pretty much ignored after we got our food. Had to ask for refill after our glasses had been sitting empty for a while.
