There was no seating and then we realized it winds a the way in the back and there is additional seating there as well as on the patio.  We ended up lucking out and snagging a table as someone was leaving. We didn't luck out in that the table wasn't cleaned until a good 15 minutes after we sat down. We also did not luck out in that we were surrounded by smokers.  I guess that's still a thing allowed in Atlanta? My bad for not knowing it ahead of time but as someone who's allergic, it was not fun.  Dogs are allowed on the patio as well and that's great unless the dog is braking non-stop so maybe next time you should leave that dog home guy cause it was obviously trying to communicate something you couldn't understand.

There was still snow on the sidewalks and streets from the Atlanta snowstorm of January 2014, so I had to be extremely careful as I exited Van Michael and headed in the direction of the North Face store. From that point, it was maybe a three-block stroll. It was a beautiful sunny afternoon, so I was more than happy to do it. (Why doesn't Atlanta have more sidewalks, dammit!!)\\n\\nI wasn't sure what the storefront was like and when I saw the old-school neon sign for the bakery, the idea of what a French bakery looked like clashed with what met my eyes. But I was in for a treat, ladies and gents!\\n\\nYou can tell this place has been around for a long time, as soon as you walk in and notice that the place does have the same look as the new, trendy bakeries. Who cares about trendy when the food is good though.\\n\\nWhen I made my entrance, I wasn't sure where to head and almost started spinning around rapidly to get a view of everything at once. I didn't want to fall flat on my butt, so I refrained from carrying out the act. I was drawn to the pastries and cookies and marveled at all the treats that were on display. Someone immediately checked to see if I was ready to order, which I wasn't because I am such an indecisive weirdo. So I browsed carefully and decided that I would leave Henri's with one less pistachio macaron. I had to try one. I also glared at an eclair from the side and decided that I would snatch one of those bad boys too. A pair of shortbread cookies and I was ready!\\n\\nMy choices were quickly boxed up and I took the box and acted like I knew where I was going. I looked at the cakes and noticed that there was also a deli counter, from which I am sure yummy sandwiches are served on their own artisan bread (I am surmising that they do this, as they are a bakery, after all).\\n\\nRegisters are past the deli counter, in the dining room area. I paid with my card with no issues (I don't know if there is a minimum, but what I got was quite inexpensive). I sat down to give my eclair a try, especially since my belly was reprimanding for not having had lunch. The eclair was pretty good, but I admit that I have another place that I prefer a bit more. Later on I tried the shortbread cookies, which I did not end up finishing. I could recognize the quality but they also weren't my absolute favorite shortbread cookies.\\n\\nBut that pistachio macaron. Lawd haf mercy! It was fantastic. I would say that it is one of the best, maybe tying with Douceur de France for me. I don't recall that it had the issue of being cold and needing to come to room temperature but I may be wrong. This is one thing that digs into my nerves here in Atlanta, as I was so spoiled when I made my way across the Atlantic Ocean to try these tiny vividly-colored confections in L'hexagone (France has this nickname due to its shape. Bam! You just learned something new!), where they are prepared fresh and can be consumed immediately upon purchase with no unpleasant surprise of biting into very firm buttercream.\\n\\nMacarons have become somewhat trendy and more and more dessert places in Atlanta are churning them out. This does not mean they are doing right by the little almond-meal cookie sandwiches. The pistachio macarons that I have tried are sorely lacking a rich but not overly sweet buttercream with the decadently light aroma of pistachio. This buttercream was close to what I remembered. It was not too much nor too little (this sin is committed at many places, with the Asian bakeries being notorious for not putting sufficient filling). I am looking forward to going back to satisfy this yearning for good macarons and try something else. I feel that it is likely that this rating could jump up another star with just one other good experience."},{"name":"The Busy Bee Cafe","address":"810 Martin Luther King Jr Dr SW","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"This circa 1947 downtown classic serves traditional soul food at budget prices.

We were told the A/C was checked and they sprayed the room with air freshener; while we do not know if that was actually done we do know the problem was not fixed and we were not offered a different room. \\nThe next day we went to the spa for a day of relaxation and it was anything but. Five guests in our party booked services, we told the spa ahead of time one of us has a severe nut and seed allergy so he cannot have any oils or lotions containing nuts/seeds they said no problem we have coconut oil which  they did not. First of all none of the service providers were informed of his allergy so had he not double checked they would have used a nut/seed based product. For his massage, which was booked as a hot stone with a man he had a female who did not know about the hot stone.  My mom whom is old fashioned and 65 booked with a female no hot stone and she was greeted by a man for a hot stone massage.  We informed the manager that they switched the reservations and we were told its too late so she can have the service done with a man or not at all because they are booked, so she went with him and had a great service but she was very uncomfortable.  During our friend with the nut allergy's massage he was told they had no nut free options and they could do a dry massage, that was unacceptable so they found aloe, (which does not work well for a massage).  For his next service, a pedicure he found out yet again no one informed the service provider of his allergy and all they had were nut products.  The technician was amazing and managed to quickly throw together something that was nut free so he could at least get part of the service. For lunch we ordered 2 sandwiches white only bread, informed them again of the allergy and we received whole grain bread covered in seeds/nuts for the low price of $59. When you go to a spa you pay extra for the atmosphere, amenities and great service. We had to in our robes walk out of the spa to the check in desk to ask for things at least 4 times because no one was checking on us. The speakers were not working so no relaxing music until someone got a portable speaker, a man was cleaning the outside hot tubs for the morning so no \\"serenity pools\\", it wasn't until my sister-in-law said something to the manager that things changed but even then it was minimal and for over one thousand dollars we expected more.\\nNext was check out. For all 4 rooms we called the night before and requested late checkout which is at 12:00pm and we put do not disturb signs on the doors. My brother, sister-in-law and their one year old infant were in a room adjoining to ours, when they got up this morning their son was ill so they paid the charges for the room and took him to the ER but did not checkout because they still had some items in the room. When I came back from helping them downstairs I went in their room to get their stuff and it was gone. My friend who was asleep in the adjoining room next door said he heard workers in there and assumed my brother had checked out.  We contacted the front desk to inquire about the missing items; a cooler, a variety of food, beer, bottles of champagne, a baby thermos with breast milk in it, sunglasses, an iPhone charger and toiletry items, they had no information so they transferred me to the bellhop who put on the supervisor who said they only take luggage so it wasn't them, who then transferred me to housekeeping who then put me on with the housekeeping manager.  While speaking with her and being assured that no one had gone in the room so they could not have touched our belongings, my friend went in the hall and found a housekeeper who had some information.  She had the food items still on her cart, apologized because she was told they had checked out and gave us what she had back.  This was in no way her fault and she was very kind and accommodating. The housekeeping manager said all she can do is send up security. We spoke to Angel, the head of security who took a list of our items, left and came back about 15-20 minutes later with 2 beers, a cell phone charger and sunglasses and said he \\"found these in the trash\\". We asked if that was hotel policy to just throw away guests personal belongings and he was dismissive and rude so we took any nonfood item that was left since we not longer knew if it all came from the trash or not and went to the front desk.  We asked for a manger and that didn't happen. Annah, at guest services said she would do all she could and get back to us.

The servings are quite small for the price, but I never walk away hungry, and I never have to order more than I would at a place with bigger servings. Do they put lead in the food? Not sure. Needless to say, even an average sized Media Noche sandwich will fill me up even more than a much larger one from somewhere else. That makes me forget about the fact that their dinner salads are $7 and sized about the same as a happy hour nibble (won't be getting those in the future). \\n\\nBut all the times I have been, the service has been spot on. So my conclusion is that the first time I went, maybe it was the company, maybe it was a harmonic convergence, or maybe it was the rum... either way, I really feel like 50 plates is much better suited in my 4-star category than 5-star.

I like the small oysters so I had the kusshi, kumamoto and shigoku to start - very fresh and they offer 3 levels of spiciness for your condiments at the table plus the usual lemon wedges and horseradish, etc. Honestly was not expecting too much from the menu but got a nice surprise. I tried a bite of most of my friends' meals as well and they were really good, I don't think there was a single miss. \\n\\nI ordered the Beef Brisket and it was so good. The meat tore apart easily and the bbq sauce was really tasty. Loved the sweet potato mash too! I tried a few bites of the fried chicken (super moist with extra sweetness from their honey drizzle), the jambalaya (tasty with a kick of spice), shrimp and grits (parmesan cheese grits-yum!). \\n\\nWe were pretty stuffed but after taking a look at the dessert menu decided to split the French Quarter Beignets. Definitely try these. It's a pretty big portion so perfect to split even if you are full.

The area I was sitting was not her area but she took our table anyways, but it was hard to get her attention, she never refilled our drinks, and complained and continued to remind us that our table was not her area... she wasn't rude, just complained about what she couldn't control which was having to serve my table due to a communication error with the hosts who seated us in the first place. Also, the restroom was absolutely sick and disgusting. None of the stalls has toilet paper, there was crap on the floor, and smelled so bad. I've been to Atlanta multiple times and have eaten at several different restaurants. By far, this was the worst Friday's I have ever been to.

I think it's just because this place is so wonderful that people must visit again and again (even though they've only been open for a month).\\n\\nWe started with 12 oysters, they were perfectly fresh and came with an assortment of sauces, most of which seemed to be homemade (the \\"hot sauce\\" was my favourite but even the cocktail one was much better than the usual bottled cocktail sauce).  They ranged between $2.50-$3 per oyster, so not super cheap, but we didn't mind at all!  My wife had a glass of wine, they pour the wine by the glass so that it's filled to the brim with a few drops spilling over, a nice touch to make you feel like you're getting your money's worth.\\n\\nOur main courses were delicious!  I had the southern fried chicken, it was unlike any fried chicken I've ever had, just amazing.  The batter was perfect, the chicken was fall off the bone moist.  I was stuffed once I finished but I wanted more it tasted so good.  My wife had the bbq shrimp & grits.  This as well was amazing, the sauce was unlike anything I'd tasted, so delicious.  We were told by the lady sitting next to us, who was a regular that she thought these were the best two dishes on the menu.\\n\\nSo if this is what southern food is all about I definitely need to plan a trip down south, delicious!  Chewie came by numerous times during the dinner and chatted with us.  It's very seldom in Vancouver that you can go out and have such a nice experience, for what is actually a very reasonable price (the whole bill came to under $100 with a couple of drinks each).\\n\\nOne final thing, was the music, everyone in the restaurant seemed to be grooving to a very good selection of music.

I've heard complaints about the kale, but I give them points for including greens with breakfast. My one complaint about brunch is they often seemed understaffed.

No one came to get our drinks for 10-15 mins. I had to get Isabell's attention while she was at the computer and a guy came up to get our order. No introduction just what do you want. So we tell him our drinks, when he gets back, we go to order. I ordered a strip med rare, the guy said back to me a skirt steak med. No, wrong so I repeat myself (not sure if I got the strip or skirt in the end). My boyfriend ordered 3 appetizers for his meal. After about 20+ mins of waiting, one of the girls comes out and says they have no calamari. 7pm on a Sunday and you're out of something so simple, yet you waited so long to tell me. And when they said it was out, they did not hand us a menu to look for something new. \\n\\nOh btw, the girl Isabell was siting in one of the booths eating.

But after paying, I noticed they still charged us for the calamari. It took the guy another 15-20 to try to figure out how to fix the check.

The people that came in while we were there seemed to be repeat customers, so that's a plus.\\n\\n The staff was pleasant, the chef was filled with cheesy Japanese Hibachi Table jokes and Hibachi cooking antics weren't over the top, and the food was comparable to Kobe. You started off with some bland Lo Mein Noodles (which I could have done without)  followed by  what I thought to be decent fried rice. Then came the veggies (my favorite part- onions, zucchini, mushrooms, and carrots). We got the Hibachi Special for $14.95 which came with all three meats (Shrimp, Steak, and Chicken). The shrimp were large and fresh, the lower-grade steak was tender, but the chicken ended up being simply bland, tasteless cubes and I passed these along to my boyfriend at the end of the meal because I was totally stuffed. The rest of the table of 8 folks managed to take some of their food home, but I was able to clean my plate like a pro (minus the chicken blocks)....I would get the Steak and Shrimp Combo next time for a few extra bucks (and a better cut of steak). My boyfriend said he thought that they used WAY TOO much butter for his liking, but I thought it was perfectly seasoned. \\n\\nFor $15 bucks, I think it was a fine meal. Decor was rather dated but typical of the restaurants in this neighborhood, and I surely wouldn't want to bring a group with the intentions of impressing.

I plan on trying the $8.95 Hibachi Lunch Special soon. \\n\\nThis is one of those places where you'll either like it or not.

In some ways very \\"un-Portland,\\" this is food with beauty and brains behind the top quality ingredients and served in a serene room with white tablecloths it is cuisine that demands the same attention that the expert wait staff gives each diner all evening.\\n\\nBeginning first with one of the more aromatic cocktails I've ever experienced and progressing quickly into a succession of seven small bites running the gamut from sweet to savory, light to unctuous, and crispy to creamy it does not take long to realize how much craft goes into each plate at Castagna; the buttermilk puff intensely perfumed with black truffles yet the onion soup restrained, the liver on rye tasting like something from a Jewish deli while the buckwheat cracker riffed on the traditional haute cuisine pairing of cr√®me Fraiche and caviar with nice effect.\\n\\nMoving through a few rounds of bread - a tender and nutty biscuit largely serving as a warm delivery mechanism for a smoked pork fat that reminded me of 'Hungarian Turkey' - the proper courses began delicate and dynamic - the crab picked moments prior and although muted in color a deft balance of sweet, bitter, and slightly sour on the tongue while the beet was bold with spice and earth aplenty as the protein acted largely as accent with a vegetal cool on the finish.\\n\\nMoving through pungent leeks soup teaming with fresh seafood onward to perhaps the best piece of sturgeon I've ever tasted my favorite course arrived as the penultimate savory; a tender piece of pork that presented minimal resistance to both knife and tooth draped with earthy kohlrabi and paired with creamy sauce tinged with garlic and tempered brine; the end effect something familiar like my Grandfather's pork steak and potatoes, but at the same time a revelation with the swine and sea marrying so smoothly.\\n\\nTransitioning from a hefty slice of lightly prepared beef and expectedly tender oxtail into sweeter territory with delicate floral panna cotta what followed can only be described as my best experience with a grapefruit to this date, an ingredient I'm generally indifferent to overcoming its intrinsic sourness through the use of buttery cake and an aromatic piece of 'glass' to form a truly beautiful and memorable experience that has since made me reincorporate the humble grapefruit into my life.\\n\\nFinishing the evening with a crispy pod of liquid chocolate which proved that, when done with finesse, cocoa and orange can work followed by the restaurant's owner stopping by to say hello along with a (admittedly superfluous) branch bearing a trio of interesting mignardises I really cannot think of a meal that was more \\"Un-Portland\\" than that at Castagna, and yet I also can't think of many recent 'modernist' meals that were more inspiring - it was a meal every bit as good as that at Chef Lightner's 2* Atera and given the price difference all the more evidence that Chef Woodward  is an adequate successor to Matthew in a dining scene can compete with the best in the nation."},{"name":"StackHouse Burger Bar","address":"1224 Granville Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"3.5","text":"Burger was tasty.

The fried calamari was as it should be - not too fried but not two chewy - just right. The fra diavolo sauce that came with it was great. The fresh mozza was good, too. Very, very fresh. I would have been happier if it had some more fresh basil on it, but it was great as it was. For entrees, my wife had the manicotti, and I had shrimp marinara. Both were great. The manicotti were a little too cheesey for my taste, but she loved them (I am not wild about manicotti to begin with). The shrimp marinara was as promised - mildly spicy, but not very. As places like this do, they cook the hell out of the shrimp. They could have gone a little easier on the shrimp, but, as I said, that is not this style of food.\\n\\nFor dessert, we ordered, of course, cannoli - two to be precise (neither of would be willing to share with the other).

Since it turned out to be a stormy day on our second day of vacation, we had to forgo our theme park plans and decided to do some indoor flea marketing instead.  We went directly to building D where the food court is located.  Caribbean Jerk & Grill is on your left when you walk through the doors.  \\n\\nAs we waited in a short line, I perused the wall menu and narrowed my choice down to Fish Tacos (Jerk style) with a side of rice and peas.  Joe ordered the Oxtail dinner with peas & rice, cabbage & corn and a side of fried plantains.  For drinks, I got a bottle of Seagrams Calypso Colada and Joe got a bottle of Jamaican cream soda by DG.  There seemed to be only one man doing it all (possibly the grill owner).  We weren't in a hurry, so we settled down with our drinks at a table near the windows to watch the rain, thunder and lightening.  It was actually relaxing to watch the storm going on outside, since our home state of California is suffering through another long year of drought.  \\n\\nI noticed that the owner was working hard at taking people's orders and getting them prepared at the same time.  A woman finally arrived to help out, and he walked over to our table to apologize about the delays in getting our food.  Apparently, one of the burners stopped working and caused a back up in the cooking process.  He gave us a complimentary hamburger patty that was baked in a dough wrap.  I didn't eat any, but Joe really liked it. \\n\\nIt didn't take much longer before our \\"made to order\\" meals arrived to our table.  Everything looked and smelled delicious.  But eating our food was even better!  The homemade sauce he gave me for my fish tacos was very tasty and really added to the complete flavor of my food!  The rice and peas were seasoned to perfection and I enjoyed every mouthful!  Joe loved his lunch also and wrote his own descriptive review, so I won't say much more there.  \\n\\nOur whole lunch experience has changed my opinion on the quality of flea market restaurants!

Finally, me and 4 other friends made it down to the restaurant with duck reserved. \\nThe restaurant is right under Granville bridge downtown side. Underneath the stone grill restaurant (fyi, stone grill is closed permanently) and yacht club. Plenty of parking and the view was nice. Our reservation was for 7:30 on a Friday night, to my surprise the restaurant wasn't even half full, there were more servers than tables occupied.  I have to mention that this is the first time I walked into a Chinese restaurant with squared tables, very \\"interesting.\\" \\nWe ordered dishes our server recommended since none of us knew what to order. We had the spareribs, enoki mushrooms with tofu noodles, spicy and sour cabbage, cold cucumber and rice noodles, and the Peking duck. \\nFirst came a round hard bread type appetizer with some spicy preserved beans on the side. So here we started to complain about the rectangular shaped tables, since that made it hard for our group to share food. If you are not a spicy food fan don't eat the preserved bean sauce, it numbed my tongue!  \\nThe spareribs were very dry and all I tasted was salty. \\nThe cucumber rice noodles were ok, but really just some cucumber and rice noodles in peanut butter vinegar and chili oil for $15. \\nThe enoki mushroom with beef and tofu noodles were kind of on the spicy side too. The tofu noodles are really just shredded dried tofu. \\nThe spicy sour cabbage was soaked in oil. \\nThe Peking duck was carved at our table and the skin of the duck was Very delicious, though have to say that you will have a mouth full of oil when biting into the duck skin. No wonder it tasted so good. The meat of the duck you can then roll into the flour pancakes with green onion cucumber and seafood sauce or with strawberry sauce and  pear. Personally I liked the strawberry sauce better, it was a new combination something I have never seen before. The rack of the duck was then taken back to the kitchen and made into some soup. \\nThe soup......really bad. First of all, it didn't come in a big bowl where you can see the duck inside at least. It was served in individual bowls and it looked like pot cleaning water, clear broth with some red oil floating on surface. There was nothing in the soup, just 2 soy beans and 1 tiny piece of diced dried tofu.  Pretty sure it was loaded with MSG cause my friend got really thirsty after he drank it. The rest of us, didn't even drink the soup after we tasted it. Oh and one friend commented: I really don't taste any duck in the soup. I mean who knows where the duck really went, we certainly didn't see it in our soup. \\nOverall, I gave it 2 stars just for the duck skin."},{"name":"Piece of Cake","address":"3215 Roswell Rd NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"My wife wanted to come here and get a slice or two for her birthday.

I've given it multiple chances, as it's right down the street from my place, which is a pie-loving household. Maybe that's an understatement. 'Cause really, we love pie. Fuck birthday cake, I make birthday pie. Pie is so good. And there's a great pie shop a couple blocks away, right? We just hit it on a couple bad days? Ugh, I guess not.\\n\\nThe pie itself is underwhelming. The crust is overworked and bland. It's just... there. It's as if they buy chilled Pilsbury crust (not even TJ's frozen, as that's better than RO's) and roll it out and fold it over a few times to make something that resembles pie crust, but lacks any elegance. It just hold the mediocre fillings. Where's the flakiness? Where's the delicacy? Pie crust is an art, and the hipsters who make the goods at Random Order are apparently not artists. At least not pie crust artists, that is, 'cause their awful attitudes show that they do fancy themselves artist of some sort. \\n\\nThe fillings sound good, and I'm kinda confused as to how they take such genius combinations and make them taste so bland. Also, I always seem to forget that they serve them up cold. Maybe you can get get them warm if you ask? If this is the case, shouldn't they ask you if you want it heated when you order a slice? I mean, it's a pie place.\\n\\nAnd then there's the attitude. This place is the epitome of Portland hipster nonsense bad service. Someone will help you eventually, but they act like approaching the counter to take your order is a huge inconvenience. And they are slow. Why does it take so long to serve up a cold slice of pie? All you have to do is take it out of the case, make a cut, and put it on a plate. How can this take over 5 minutes when it's not busy? \\n\\nAnd why is the espresso machine shut down 30 minutes before closing? I know you want to get home, and I know cleaning the machine takes a few minutes. Trust me, I've been a barista and know it's great to get that done ahead of time. That's why I don't order an espresso 5 minutes before the posted closing time. But a half hour? C'mon. You're a fucking coffee shop. But if you really don't want to make me an espresso, maybe let me know you have drip available? 'Cause you told me that since you were closing in 30 minutes you wouldn't make me an espresso, I smiled and said no problem.  I sat there eating my cold, disappointing slice of pie, really wishing I had some sort of warm caffeinated beverage, then realized all these people who came in after me were drinking coffee. Why didn't you offer me one??? \\n\\nSo I guess I'll stay home for yummy flaky pie deliciousness, and continue heading to Black Cat for coffee (where they have espresso available during all their posted hours) and service without attitude, just good ol' fashioned banter.\\n\\nWhich is a shame.

Great food; great beer selection;  and ample opportunities to watch some sports on TV. Going to Taco Mac on Saturday night, I expected to experience all of these things. And I did. But I left unhappy because of the bonus surprise of getting crappy service. I hate to complain too much because it's Taco Mac at Lindbergh on a Saturday. But sometimes you have to throw out the excuse, \\"Oh, well, they were really busy,\\" and call a spade a spade.\\n\\nWe arrived at \\"typical\\" dinner time to a very crowded and noisy dining room. This TM is a double decker; seats downstairs and upstairs. So at least they have the space to handle the crowds. \\n\\nWe were seated right away upstairs at a good table. But within 10 or 15 minutes, we both started to get REALLY warm (and this was BEFORE we started drinking), and it just got worse the longer we were there. My husband shredded his sweatshirt layer, so he was a bit more comfortable, but I had on a long sleeve shirt that I couldn't shred (I mean, I guess I could have, but I probably would have been arrested and, let's be honest, no one wants to see all that mess). Anyway it's HOT as Hay-yell upstairs, man.  We spent the entire dinner sweating and being miserable. Next time, I'll endure the wait to be seated downstairs, where it was much cooler.\\n\\nThe uncomfortable environment is my biggest complaint ...NEXT to our idiot waitress. I'm not typically so harsh to folks who are working hard doing a difficult and often stressful job, but she was awful. First, you couldn't really hear her cause she \\"roared\\" at a dull whisper. Second, she was awkward as all hell. Maybe that's why we were sweating...cause she was making us anxious. Third, she just had too much going on and not enough mental fortitude to handle all of it. We tried to be really nice to her (understanding how busy she was), but by the end of the meal, I was fed up with her. I struggled to leave her 15%. That's how bad that was. \\n\\nA few examples of her piss poor waitressing:\\n\\n1. When we ordered our drinks, we ordered two beers; two waters. Got the beers, didn't get the waters (interesting how THAT works, eh?). Had to ask for water twice more. We were passed the appetizer and half way though  our main meal when she finally brought them. \\n\\n2. When we ordered our meal, we ordered wings, which come with Ranch dressing. Ok, that's cool. But we also asked for 2 honey mustard sauces. She wrote it down and we STILL had to ask for them again. After asking for them, it took a good 10 minutes for her to finally get them to us. The worst thing was that when we reminded her that we asked for honey mustard, her face got all scrunched up like we speared her dog in the heart with a sharpened chicken bone. It was a mixture of confusion, sadness, fear and apology. Strange. \\n\\n3. During the back half of our meal, my husband ordered a second beer. I wanted another one, too, but hadn't decided which one I wanted (you know, we do the Brewniversity deal, so you get credit for each new bear you try). So we sent the server off to get his beer while I mulled over the beer list. When she got back, I was like, \\"Ok, I think I'm going to get what he got (pointing to my husband's beer)\\", which was a different beer than my first one. I want to rack up those Brewniversity points, man. I want my T-shirt! 5 minutes go by...10 minutes go by...my husband finished his meal...I finish my meal...we're just sitting there. She comes back and asks if we saved room for desert. I said, \\"No but I need a to-go box and, is my beer still on it's way? If not, then I'd like to cancel it. If you've already put it in, though, go ahead and bring it to me.\\"\\n\\nShe was like, \\"Oh, gosh, sorry that should have been up here by now, I'll go check on it.\\"  Yeah friggin' right. You know she forgot to put it in. And instead of saying, \\"I see you're almost done with your meal. I apologize, I forgot to put in your beer order, would you like me to cancel it?\\" We waited another 5-10 minutes before she FINALLY came back with it. My husband and I had already mapped out a plan that we'd share the beer and pound it so we could leave. I drank some. Was like, \\"Oh that's good, but not as bitter as you made it out to be, dear husband.\\" So he drank some. He said, \\"Huh, that doesn't taste like the beer I had.\\" We both shrugged it off and finished the beer. Our check finally came. We looked at it; and then looked at our Brewniversity receipts. Sure enough, girl had given me two of the same beer. Further proof that she not only forgot to put my beer order IN, she also forgot what I ordered. So, I ended up not getting the beer I wanted AND not getting credit for purchasing two different beers. Irritating.\\n\\nI'm not sure if it's that we got a bad server or if management isn't managing well. But the bottom line is, you gotta do better Taco Mac.

No Steeler Chants, no Steeler Swag giveaways at halftime, and no Terrible Towel waving (some people had 'em though). In fairness, one guy did attempt a chant after the game was over, but he faded after realizing that it's not that kind of Steelers Bar.  What they did have was a large patio (partially covered) devoted to Steelers Fans with the volume up on the game.  I suppose this makes it a Steelers Bar.....Brookhaven Style.\\n\\nHudson has a good beer list and much of it on draft.  Initially, I was impressed when I saw that they had a mixed beer selection.

And what do hangovers bring us? Headaches!\\n\\nIf you happen to be Asian, chances are your parents taught you that hot and spicy soups cure headache the best. So, what's better than gathering all your girls/boys/bgf together and dig yourself into a hearty and flavorful sizzling pot of soup. You can order whatever kind of meat or veggie you'd like and when you want more, they will refill it. That's the benefit of a HOT POT BUFFET compared to a regular hot pot place.\\n\\nLet me clarify that they do not have the best food in town. Their broth and meat selection is mediocre. What brings us here is the PRICE and for college students...we would obviously choose price over fancy tables and silverware. \\n\\nPlease expect bad service and non English speaking waitresses. Most are very nice and will understand some English plus hand gestures if you are nice to them and do not ask for things every 5 minutes. \\nTherefore, think carefully about what you want before asking them to run back and forth 5 times. After all, you wouldn't like doing that yourself, right? I've heard stories about people not leaving minimum 15% tip got called back. Not sure if this is true though. Never happened to me!\\n\\nAhhh, also don't waste food. Order only what you can eat!\\n\\nTips: 1. Lunch is cheaper than dinner...such a WIN! 2. If you order the Spicy soup and think that telling them Medium spicy will work for you. You're wrong! Medium spicy will still kill you. Just take the chili pieces out before they got boiled with the soup! Usually I order half Masala Spicy Soup and the other half is the House Special soup."},{"name":"Piece of Cake","address":"3215 Roswell Rd NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"They deliver!!! wish I could give more than 5!

It's a small restaurant and it's popular so it was crowded, but I was alone and got a seat at the bar with just a little wait time. \\n\\nNow for the food. Oh.My.Gosh. I seriously liked everything about my meal. I had the Venezuelan Arepa which is a cornmeal patty with your choice of shredded meat (I had pork) and cheese. The cheese had a similar texture to feta cheese, though I'm not sure if that's what it was. But whatever it was, I approve. Next, the meat. Soooooooo juicy I wasn't even prepared. I've had one too many tacos in which the meat was so dry without any sauce that it made my mouth pasty. This meat was not that AT ALL. They served it in foil which was a good thing because it was dripping with juicy goodness and I wasn't even ready. Next the bread. Surprisingly tasty. The sauce: a green sauce with the consistency of mayo. I don't know what it was called but it was delish, I definitely had to ask for more. I came here with the purpose of trying one happy hour menu item but it was so delicious that it merits a second visit, and maybe even a third.

I went with a companion on a Friday night around 7:30 pm and the place was dead. On either side Chili's, Starbucks and Uchiko were hopping, but we had this place to ourselves. We perused the menu and ordered  an assortment of dim sum and one curry special on the board to mix things up a bit. As we waited for our food, not long of course, a few more diners came in to eat and make us feel less freakish. \\n\\n    The food came out and we dove in with anticipation of goodness and satisfaction. Boy, were we disappointed. The curry dish was embarrassing. I mean, shame on us for ordering curry at at a Dim Sum establishment. It was like chicken soup at a heathcare facility. Thick, gravy-like base with the tiniest hint of yellow curry. Potato chunks that were like boulders and slimy chicken. We were in shock. We collected ourselves and moved on to the Dim Sum.\\n\\n     We played it safe and ordered some items from their top ten list. Nothing crazy: Chicken spring rolls (greasy and flavorless), Open faced chicken dumplings (Siu Mai Chicken- flavorless chicken meatball complete with gristle), Salt and Pepper tofu (probably the best item, looked like it was wrapped in seaweed, topped with the salt and jalapeno crispin combo typical of salt and pepper items - a wee bit too salty compared to similar items i have had, but i cannot fault anyone on that since \\"salt\\" is the first descriptive word - duh!), and Churng Fun - Cha Siu - Rice noodles filled with Chinese BBQ Pork (subtly and oddly flavored Chinese BBQ inside wet limp rice noodle). \\n\\n     We ate what we could stomach and left disappointed and unsatisfied. It appeared by the decor and concept that the owners hope to franchise this in the future. I hope I do not see this sub par food pop up all over the place. I think Austin diners are smarter than that. You can get quality food out of a trailer these days for a reasonable price and if you are willing to spend a little more on something like Dim Sum you can go elsewhere and not feel ripped off even when the prices are reasonable AND you got a deal through Groupon. \\n\\n     So, Get Sum Dim Sum elsewhere.

It was crowded, but we got two seats at the bar within about 5 minutes. Beautiful view of the river. Beautiful minimalist decor.

My boyfriend had a burger and I had a portabella. He loved his burger and portabellas can be pretty boring, but this one was saturated with flavor and delicious.

To be fair, the younger staff are courteous, but there is an older man there, whom we can only guess must be a manager or owner, if he's still employed, that is rude and dismissive. A member of our group asked for no cilantro (this shouldn't be uncommon) and was met with an eye roll and a headshake. Another time we asked for the bean sprouts to be cooked, he kept asking \\"What? What?\\" And then dismissed the request by a wave of his hand and a \\"Later\\" before he moved on to take the next person's order (\\"later\\" never came along, we had to flag someone else capable of understanding English).

These type of restaurants tend to expect you to the European style of dining, which entails several courses (smaller since you are going to have more than 2 courses typically) - more like tapas. \\n\\nI didn't realize until afterwards that the owner also had helped found Odd Duck, which I had for brunch earlier that day; I was very happy  that I enjoyed my experience here so much more than at Odd Duck. \\n\\n1 thing I have to say is I really liked that their masa was thinner compared to the masa I've had at other places like ATX Cocina. If you don't like or allergic to avocado, you will have some trouble here. It seemed as if there was plenty of avocado in the sauces or on the plate, which I loved.\\n\\nWe started with the molotes, which were ok, but for me too many carbs with the potatoes in masa. \\nThe ceviche was fantastic. I actually wanted bread to sop up all the liquid/sauce; that is one bad thing about having masa - it's not very absorbent.\\nThe beet tostada was good. Good balance, so that it wasn't too sweet from the beets.\\n\\nThe mushroom fritos were good but I wasn't in the mood for fried. The mushrooms are oyster mushrooms which was a nice difference. Sauce was really good.\\n\\nThe green chorizo tlayuda was great also. The chorizo is actually green! It was not heavy or oily as chorizo can tend to be. It was not light enough to be refreshing, but the sprouts helped it definitely feel closer to refreshing and definitely felt more healthy. :0) My friend who doesn't like cilantro even liked it even though cilantro is part of what makes the chorizo green.\\nThe carne asada was well cooked and delicious, but I preferred both the Suadero Tacos and the goat barbacoa much more.\\nThe tacos were filed with tender and extremely flavorful fatty brisket. If you don't like fatty, they maybe avoid these.\\nThe goat barbacoa was tender and flavorful and not gamey at all; my friend who usually doesn't like goat enjoyed it. i really enjoyed the various toppings. The only thing I didn't quite get was the pickled green beans. They were good to eat separately, but didn't put in taco with the goat; it didn't seem right to me.  There was also plenty of goat for the 3 of us since we had so much other food. The tortillas do fill you up, so if you are not eating them, you may need more food, but if you're eating the tortillas, it gets filling.\\n\\nWe got the chamomile panna cotta and the mango cake. I'm not much a dessert person, so they were good but I wouldn't say they wowed me. My friend really loved the mango cake.\\n\\nOur service was great with only 1 exception, when a waitress dropped off our last dessert who just dropped it onto the table without any description or anything.\\n\\nOne negative was that the restaurant is loud and can be difficult to hear either the server when they are describing what the food is or at times, even your friends. It must be something about the design/acoustics of the place, because even when there was far less people, it still was louder than you would expect. \\n\\nThis restaurant is worth the $$ and I'm looking forward to trying more food from them; although I may not be able to do it for awhile :0)"},{"name":"Olive Garden Italian Restaurant","address":"300 West 436","city":"Altamonte Springs","stars":"3.5","text":"We eat here about once a week.

They were generous with the cheese, and despite this, the cheese did not fall off when I folded my slice in half. The sauce was good, but I prefer my pizza to have just a bit more of it. The oil dripped appropriately, and if anything, the pizza was less oily than most. The dough was good, but would benefit from being a bit crispier. The main downside is that relative to the price, the slices are small. Overall, however, the pizza here is solid, and did the trick for satisfying my cravings for pizza from home.\\n\\n(^_^) Options\\n(^_^) Service\\n(^_^) Taste\\n(^_^) Open til midnight\\n(-_-) Bang for buck\\n\\nGlad I came.

By the time I got there they were all wrapping things up and getting ready to leave, so I decided to wait to start drinking until the next stop. The group seemed to have had a good time (but not an overly good time). When they got the bill they noticed they had been charged for 6 beers a piece instead of the 4 they had actually drunken. Like any normal person would they flagged down their waitress and pointed out that she had made a mistake. Rather than apologize and fix her error she insisted that this was 'impossible', that they must have had 6 beers each. I can tell you from the conversations I was having with these ladies that they had not had 6 beers a piece and I know from working in the industry that it is entirely possible to make this mistake.\\n\\nAnyways the waitress involved a manager (good going), and we thought ahh yes, a manager will take care of this (as that is what managers are supposed to do). Well the manager said he would take one round off but that he absolutely could not take two off. ARE YOU KIDDING ME?! And he proceeded to refuse, so my friends told him that they were only willing to pay for what they drank, so he told us that he would call the cops. AND HE DID! At this time it was a little before 11pm, and he couldn't manage the bar in which he is the manager and felt the need to call the cops. The waitress had mentioned that he has a temper, so I guess he just lost it, not a great quality in a manager. However we did wait patiently to explain to the police officers the details of the dispute, the manager refused to even talk to us at this point, insisting only on talking to the officers. This went on for over an hour.\\n\\nThere is so much wrong with that situation. One being that the manager could not adequately manage his own bar. Two that he felt the need to waste tax dollars to have the police come to try to scare women into paying for 8 beers that they did not drink. And three, it is illegal to over serve someone, which is what would have been the case if these ladies had actually consumed the amount of alcohol that Dillon's was claiming.\\n\\nMy only hope is that these managers continue to run the bar like this because that at rate they'll run it right into the ground (maybe like the sister restaurant Purple Shamrock?).

Whew, made it! \\n\\nWe ordered the Championones Rellenos, Peruvian Ceviche, Tostones Con Hogao, and Yuca. First off, let me just say - these happy hour prices are great! The most expensive item is only $7, and the rest of them are between $3-$5. Portions aren't skimpy either, you easily get your money's worth. Pretty sure you could just go and make a less-than-$15 meal of tapas alone!\\n\\nOf the four we chose, my favorite is easily the Championones. The mushrooms are nicely soft, and the chorizo and cheese give it a good umami kick without taking over the flavor. The ceviche and tostones con hogao (especially the plantains themselves) were both pretty tasty, although I do wish they were a bit less oily (particularly the hogao). Not too much to say about the yuca, they were exactly as you'd expect - just be sure to eat them freshly cooked! They're not as fun after they're cooled. \\n\\nFor meals, we all ordered the Bandeja Paisa. Oh my god, you would not believe the size of this thing! I'm pretty sure the three of us could have split one, and still left completely full! Needless to say, there were plenty of leftovers! But not just the quantity, the quality is pretty high up there too! I have no complaints about any part of this combination platter. I'm especially in love with the plantains, perfectly sweet and warm, just the correct ripeness, and oh so full of delicious gooey-ness. \\n\\nService felt a bit slow, especially considering that the restaurant was only half-full while we were there, but the staff are very friendly and fairly attentive.

The occasion was my wife's birthday and we ate at TRP on 1/19/2012. \\n\\nFirst impressions of the place were great. The decor and ambiance of the place gives it a very trendy vibe. The weather was nice so all of the outside tables were full. This was a Thursday night and the restaurant was packed. We had reservations and still had to wait thirty minutes beyond that to be seated. Not a huge deal for us as we found a spot near the entrance that had a ledge to set drinks on. We got a round from the bar and people watched. I can see why a place like this would run a wait even with reservations. The feel is very cozy and it isn't the kind of place you'd want to rush out of - so we weren't too upset about having to hold out for half an hour.\\n\\nOn our way to our table we noticed more of the furniture, art, and rustic but modern blend that TRP features. We were shown to our table by our server who apologized about our wait several times. She was very pleasant and knowledgeable about their menus (both food and wine). Once she learned that it was our group's first time, she told us the background story and a little about the way the restaurant operates. It was great and provided a good backdrop as to what was going on in the kitchen. \\n\\nWe went with the appetizers she selected, notably the Gruyere biscuits and their meat/cheese plate (they call it something fancy but I can't remember). Both were excellent. The biscuits stood out and we wish they served more than three. Definitely worth getting if/when you go. The meat/cheese plate was heavy on the meats (5 or 6 types) but light on the cheese with only two varieties. Still in the realm of sharable appetizers these both were great choices. Taste and presentation were impressive for each.\\n\\nMain courses included shrimp tacos, steak frites, and a salad with olives and some other stuff I couldn't recognize. Of all the items, it appears the salad was the least enjoyed. My steak was mouthwatering good. Cooked a perfect medium and it came with a 16oz pint glass of super thin french fries. It was the perfect combo. The shrimp tacos were unbelievable. It was a toss up between those and my steak for my personal favorite. \\n\\nService was excellent throughout.

The first problem I encountered was trying to make a reservation. I called last week and the week of trying to speak to someone at Miel. Apparently they don't answer their phone, not even when the hotel staff calls. After several times of hearing the same voice mail of a lady with a French accent speaking, I gave up and just decided to leave a message - which was also not returned. \\n\\nAside from all the problems, I was surprised to see that the restaurant was empty. I do like their idea of having a buffet and a menu to order from. The buffet consisted of pastries, cold cuts, and the usual eggs, meat, and potatoes. What was very disappointing about the potatoes were that they were dry and hard. After sampling some of the buffet, I figured that the best food has to come out of the kitchen so I ordered the honey baked shrimp, tuna tartar, scallop wrapped bacon, crab cake benedict, dessert crepe with berries, waffle with lavender and berry compote, and steak and eggs. I was disappointed in the first three small plates. Although Miel = honey, it doesn't mean that everything on the menu needs to be sweet. The honey baked shrimp was overly sweet. It seemed like the just poured honey into the entire plate. The tuna tartar had no flavor. The scallop wrapped bacon - overcooked and again sweet. The crab cake though - perfection. The list starts to get better from there. I don't generally like waffles but theirs was solid. I finished the entire thing. The crepe with berries needed work though since the berries aren't in season maybe adding some nutella or honey would have better. The steak was slightly overcooked but still tender enough to enjoy. \\n\\nService was outstanding although I'm a little suspicious that our server kept asking us if their brunch tasted good. \\nAll problems aside, I was surprised to see the restaurant so empty when we arrived.

What makes this place special? I usually come here for one certain dish, which is... \\n\\nÊΩÆÂºèËíúÈ¶ôÔøΩ?(Chiu Sik Suen Heung Gwat) - Spare ribs in Garlic Sauce\\n\\nThis is spare ribs that are fried to a crispy texture, and seasoned with a lot of fried garlic. It may be greasy, but it is tasty, and can go well with rice or noodles. They are also a great complement if you are holding a house party with some friends and if you are drinking a lot of good alcoholic beverages. It may be expensive at around $13 per dish, but portions are enough for 4+ people. If you order 3 of these dishes for a large party that has alcoholic beverages, they are an excellent alternative to chicken wings. \\n\\nAs for other dishes, their portions are excellent and their simple dishes are tasty. One dish I liked to get often is their Á≤üÁ±≥ÊñëÁêÉÔøΩ?(Suk Mai Ban Kau Fan), which is fish mixed with a corn sauce with rice. This dish is enough for a light dinner for 2 people and it is under $10. I really liked the texture of the sauce and the fish was good. It may not be the best dish I had in Chinatown, but the portions are excellent. Their ‰πæÁÇíÁâõÊ≤≥ (Gon Chao Ngau Ho), or Dry Fried Beef Chow Foon noodle dish is also a good choice if you want a noodle dish with large portions enough for a group of people. This dish is under $10 and one dish should be more than enough to fill your stomach. \\n\\nThis place is located in a basement, and it's definitely one of the smaller restaurants in Boston's Chinatown, but it's a fairly good setting for a somewhat quiet \\"one-on-one\\" appointment or if you really want a really small group dinner for up to six people.\\n\\nOverall, this is a really good choice if you want to eat at a small and somewhat quiet restaurant in Boston's Chinatown. If you are looking for some of the tastiest spare ribs in Boston's Chinatown, then this place is a good choice. It's also a great choice if you want excellent portions at a fair price."},{"name":"Story Book Dining at Artist Point with Snow White","address":"901 Timberline Dr","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"Just go!!

Their extensive cocktail list is first rate, serving some of the finest spirits around in interesting combinations. Let me advise you though, they pour drinks like they are meant to be: STRONG. Their bar manager Larry always comes up with the most creative cocktails that showcase some of the finest liquors that you have probably never heard of. Their signature drink has to be the Ravenous Pig Old Fashioned, which features the bacon infused Buffalo Trace and garnished with a candied bacon swizzle stick. Genius. \\n\\nAppetizers / small plates - There is no reason to ever NOT get the fresh Cheese and Charcuterie plate. This has a little bit of everything, and really demonstrates the skill and craftsmanship that goes into the food here. Their constantly changing cheeses to smoked and cured meats make for a great starter. This is not to say their other plates should be missed, far from it. Their staples (The Tacos and Shrimp and Grits) are there for a reason, because they are that damn good.\\n\\nEntree - There are two entrees that stay constant (The Pub Burger and Steak Frites) while the others rotate and change depending on the season and availability of certain proteins. I have tried everything from their hand made pastas and locally caught fish, all the way to my favorite item The Pork Porterhouse. You really can't go wrong with anything here, as the flavors are all well developed and bring something to any pallet.\\n\\nI come here for the food, the atmosphere, and the drinks.

I thought it would just have some lobster meat, but that alone exceeded my expectation. Plus! May I add that their presentation was quite pleasing to the eyes. The broth is made of a mix of pork & lobster broth & is kept separate in a kettle, I think made of iron?, anyways, they will pour it over the ramen once you're ready. Also, the broth will have a strong lobster flavor, so if that's not your thing, then I suggest you order something else. For the lobster meat, it would easily come out of the shell, which was a plus for me while eating ramen.\\n\\nFor the small plates, I really enjoyed the tortillas with NoriAvo dip. The mix of nori with the avocado dip really brought a unique twist to the flavor. But then again, if you're not a fan of dried seaweed, then order something else.\\n\\nFor dessert, I ordered the Takoyaki, which is a fish-shaped waffle with red bean filling, served with ice cream.

I have never once been disappoint with my experience here, everything is wonderful. The service is always friendly and attentive and they'll tell you about everything on the menu in great detail. So, if you're not exactly sure what to order (Which can really be a problem because its all so good) the staff can help you narrow down your choices. Personally I would recommend any of their scrambles or omelets.\\n\\nThey also have a great selection of drinks, both alcoholic and otherwise, so if you want a little bit of bubbly for your morning you can definitely get it here. The food is great, as I mentioned, but the drinks really turn this place into an awesome brunch joint. The variety is nice so you'll never find yourself without a few appealing options. Be adventurous, my friends! Expand your horizons!\\n\\nThe wait can be insane, especially on the weekends (I've waited over an hour before) but luckily they offer coffee while you wait. Grab one of the quirky mugs, fill 'er up and hang out with your friends nearby. There are plenty of benches near the Tin Shed and across the street so your wait can easily become another great part of your visit. If you're visiting Mon-Fri your wait shouldn't be bad at all, so just plan accordingly and you'll be fine. Also they have a menu specifically for your dog! Fido is not only welcome for a visit but he's catered to as well! So that's pretty cool too.\\n\\nLong story short: Eat here.

I've lived in the ATL for over 15 years and I've never been to this Soul food institution, so being the foodie that I am, I had to try it and share my experience. As we arrive, there's a long waiting line, that didn't matter, we were seated in about 20 minutes.  Our waiter, delightful, excellent customer service, and well informed about the restaurant and menu. I was amazed that the restaurant has been around since 1947. The caf√© is nestled  between 2 other businesses on MLK, so drive slowly so you won't miss it.  My dining guest and I both started our meal with sweet tea blended with freshly squeezed lemonade, just the right sweetness.  All the meals are served with corn muffins or  yeast bread(we tried both)...delicious!  The food service is fast and friendly,  our food arrived  less than 10 minutes. While I ordered the baked Tilapia over a bed of rice, with a side order of candied yams and collard greens(cooked with turkey), my dining guest had the \\"Beelicious\\" Fried Chicken which is marinated for 12 hours, lightly breaded, cooked in peanut oil, moist, juicy, crispy.....(of course, I had to try it, so I removed the skin, and devoured it, as JJ( 70's tv show \\"Good Times\\")  would say it was \\"Dyn-o-mite! LOL), for his side order, turnip greens and candied yams. Now, I can't forget, dessert, my dining guest and I shared the Keylime Cake and Peach Cobbler, both simply divine.  I see what the Buzz is all about, finger lickin' good, deliciously seasoned and cooked Soul Food, prepared with Tender Loving Care, the way my grandmother did.  The restaurant has a diner style counter with red leather stools, and red leather booths that line the walls. The walls are filled with local, national celebrities, and their Best of Atlanta \\"Soul Food\\" plaques. If you are in a hurry, no time to eat in, don't worry, you can get take out.  This is a great place to take out of town guest, just be aware of the long wait and the best part, it's very economical. The caf√© has a great atmosphere, very diverse, families, students, and urban trendsetters. There's something on the menu for everyone, even vegetarians.

Service is generally fine but has its slow moments. The first time I had the burger trilogy; a nice spin on sliders but of a fancier nature. There was a kobe beef burger, tuna burger and a lobster salad. Lobster salad was amazingly full of large hunks of lobster. Kobe beef burger was delicious. The tuna burger was the least favorite. I like tuna either raw or rare; this was cooked all the way through and it didn't have much taste to it. These were served with a small mug of the most delicious and exquisite truffle french fries I have ever tasted.\\n\\nMy second visit brought me to the angus beef burger which was a tad larger than I expected. It was tasty but the kitchen staff was a bit heavy handed with the truffle mayo. I felt like I had coleslaw on my burger, except it was chopped romaine and not cabbage. More disappointing was the truffle mayo itself; it didn't have any hint of the beautifully earthy taste that I love. Good thing those awesome truffle french fries came with the sandwich because they made up for the mayo disappointment.\\n\\nLocation is probably one of the best in the downtown/financial district area.

Even my beloved friends talked this place up, too. I'm sitting here wondering, utterly confused: \\n\\n\\"Did we get sucked in to an alternate universe?\\" \\n\\nLousy service. Lousy atmosphere. Even worse food. \\n\\nAnd a grand finale of Alfredo's morphing in to a photoshoot at the end of service. \\n\\nMy philosophy is that if the food is great you can forgive literally anything. Horrible service, dirty bathrooms, terrible decor, awful seating arrangements, strange women getting professional make-up done in the middle of the restaurant. I can forgive it. Just gimme that delicious food I've been hearing about. But the delicious food never came. It was awful. \\n\\nI've had lean cuisines on a 30 minute lunch break better than Alfredo's.\\n\\nWe ordered: \\n1 small San Pellegrino\\n1 glass of house Cabarnet \\n1 house salad\\n1 Full eggplant Parmesan\\n1 Fettuccine Alfredo\\n\\nMost, if not all, really awful, to the tune of $45.85\\n\\n1 week prior to our visit my friend reserved a spot for our fairly large friends group. The house was packed when we were seated. The wait staff crammed us in to the tiniest seating arrangement I've ever experienced. I literally had to pull my arm around the back of the seat of the gentleman next to me in order to read my menu.\\n\\nI understand, they were busy. I was excited because busy = great food. I was willing to go full Siamese twin with the person sitting next to me for some damn delicious Italian eats.\\n\\nThe server barked at us through the entire experience, yelling over us. The environment was loud, so I understood. But how we were barked at was nuts. If someone ordered something that was out, the server would bark \\"WE DON'T HAVE ANY OF THAT ORDER SOMETHING ELSE.\\" Okie-dokie.\\n\\nOur water glasses were constantly being filled, which is awesome. YAY! Hydration! Sadly, the wait staff would pour water from high distances and slosh ice and liquid all over. I was seated directly in the middle of the group and was constantly being leaned on. I felt EVERY SINGLE waitstaff member's lower torso region pressed in to my back. On confirming with my partner, he too felt the glory of the waitstaff's nether region in his back area. \\n\\n\\"That's fine\\" I thought. \\"The food will be good.\\" \\n\\nThe San Pellegrino I ordered was old and funky. Totally flat. The bottom of the glass left a black stain on the nice tablecloth. I should have known then that I was in for a rough dining experience. \\n\\nAppetizers to the table came. Portions were huge, things seemed OK. \\n\\nSalads came. Normal portions. Things seemed to be going well. I hadn't ordered any of these foods so I was munching on garlic bread, of which were very stale, cold and lacked seasoning. I was focused, excited for eggplant. Everything was forgivable. \\n\\nThen the main course came and all hell broke loose. \\n\\nOf those at the table that ordered the Alfredo's namesake, they were served a very small plate with boxed spaghetti noodles doused in a sticky buttered \\"sauce.\\" I saw no actual alfredo sauce to speak of, only some grease and a dry looking cheese sprinkle. Trying it for myself, I can confirm.\\n\\n\\"Sucks to be you,\\" I thought. \\"I'm going to get awesome eggplant.\\" \\n\\nMy dish was served on a large plate, but looked like a half order. I did not receive any spaghetti. Just the eggplant. Another diner at our table ALSO ordered the eggplant, only a 1/2 portion. She received the SAME EXACT portion size, but on a much smaller plate. She got spaghetti. Possibly my spaghetti. We have no idea.\\n\\nDigging in to my eggplant things seemed alright on the surface. Cheese, sauce, eggplant, a little breadcrumb coating. All was OK.\\n\\nUntil I took the cheese off and tried the eggplant itself. It was charred, with a burned grease aftertaste. Actually, I was struggling to pin-point what I was really tasting. Old pan? Burned breadcrumbs? Bad eggplant? I stopped eating, offering some of my portion to my partner who was stuck with the tiny, dry Alfredo dish. \\n\\nSurveying the table the dishes all seemed really hit or miss. The lady across from me ate her entire tortellini meal happily, while the person 2 away from her I caught staring listlessly in to their plate. \\n\\nOur group was very polite. No complaints. No dishes sent back. This was our fate, and we knew it. We sucked it up.\\n \\nFiguring out the bill for our group was a nightmare, but that's par for the course with a larger group. \\n\\nWhat was truly weird was the staff looming over us, waiting to shut the place down. At 11:20 we were still scouring the bill desperate to get out while the scene behind us got weirder and weirder. Everything was slowly dissolving in to some sort of photo or video shoot. A smattering of patrons were starting to mix with reflectors and lights.\\n\\nThe final straw was seeing one woman leaning over another seated woman applying a professional grade level of hair and make-up right in the middle of the restaurant. \\n\\nZERO STARS."},{"name":"Granny's Tacos","address":"1401 E 7th St","city":"Austin","stars":"5","text":"This is all about authenticity and straight up deliciousness.

In general I think good old fashioned customer service is a lost art and Bastas proved it tonight.  About halfway through my beer, I noticed a bug having a sudsy swim.  My server did replace it with a slightly over half full beer as he should have.  Point 1.\\n\\nFor dinner I opted for the house red.  It was absolutely horrible: totally flat, stale, flavorless and undrinkable.  I gave my glass back to the server and very nicely told him that I couldn't drink the wine as it was really bad.  On a pass back by our table, he asked me what was wrong with the wine - perhaps prompted by the bartender.  I told him it was undrinkable, flat and flavorless.  He actually told me I was the second person to send back this wine, but he missed his opportunity to offer me a glass on the house.  He actually should have just brought me a glass of their best red and charged me for the house.  Strike 1.\\n\\nI was dining with my father and he is much better at standing up for himself than I am.  Toward the end of the meal, my father said to our server, \\"Just for the future, you missed an opportunity to offer a glass of wine on the house when she sent hers back.\\"  The server replied something along the lines of losing his job if he gave drinks away.  Strike 2.\\n\\nHe then sniveled on and basically deflected and took no ownership, aka \\"I just work here\\" mentality.  I know he is not the wine buyer, but servers and bartenders should be empowered to make it right.  Unfortunately when owners and managers fail to empower them, they permanently lose business and get bad posts on Yelp.  Strike 3.\\n\\nEspecially in the hugely marked up restaurant business, it is customer service 101 to at least offer a complimentary drink or dessert for any real error or shortcoming.  We were not scamming for a freebie, but servers should at least appear to care and even offer pretend promises to mention it to management.  Nope.  After all we were a $70 check (we both ordered specials), which is pretty good.  Strike 4.\\n\\nThe food was decent, nothing extraordinary at all.  I think they stay in business because Portland in general doesn't have good Italian food.  I see lots of positive responses for their happy hour which I have not tried and probably won't.

They weren't bad, but they were a little dry. I am a big lover of quinoa so I was hoping to really love these pancakes, but I was underwhelmed. They were also surprisingly heavy. One pancake would've sufficed but I was so hungry that I ordered two... I should've stopped at one. Was also overpriced at $9 for two pancakes. I probably won't order these again.

Not the two other people who brought us water or cocktails.

Reservations a must. Restaurant ambiance is cozy and decorative. Was offered to sit inside or outdoors and we chose inside. Was greeted by one of two waiters in the restaurant. The restaurant was busy with more patrons dining outside and the 2 waiters were literally running around servicing both the patrons inside and outside dining. But with more patrons dining outside, we lacked the proper attention and had to summon the waiter several times for the necessities for our dinner. Ordered the grilled octopus and Caesar salad with romaine lettuce for appetizers. For entrees the triple cut Colorado lamb chop and the spicy lobster bucatini. The Caesar salad was served with kale instead of the romaine lettuce and had to send it back. The other dishes were absolutely delicious. The desserts were delish as well.

After wandering around for a while, wondering where all the Bostonians go at night, we found crowds at the many bars on Boylston.  We failed to make it to a Mexican place on Cinco de Mayo just 2 days earlier so when we passed Cactus Club and my friend caught sight of the sports bar, in we went.  Not that we were there to watch a game, but I think she wanted to make a point about the particular bonding that goes on when strangers watch games together.\\n\\nI asked the waitress if the guac was any good and she said it was.  And indeed, it was freshly made with ripe avocado, which made it quite good already, although I'd have liked it chunkier with more ingredients and hot pepper.  Accompanied by supermarket chips, unfortunately.\\n\\nWhile I decided to get a sangria, I noticed my friend perusing the tequila menu.  In between asking her what she wanted to eat, I mentioned I never drank tequila straight, strictly as an aside, and she startled me by dropping the menu, asking me for confirmation, then announcing that I simply had to.  I'm all for trying things so I got a mini tequila lesson.  I believe I tried a blanco Patron and sampled my friend's Cabo Wabo.  I liked tequila and will probably try it elsewhere.  Followed that up with a pretty good, plain margarita.\\n\\nFrom the food menu, besides the guac, we got the jalapenos rellenos.  Shrimp stuffed jalapenos, it just sounds yummy, who knew it would be so bad?  Mini, mushy shrimps in a bland sauce, the whole thing had no flavor; really, the jalapeno must have been embarrassed to be associated with it.  Didn't finish.  The baja style fish tacos, on the other hand, big improvement.  I prefer grilled fresh fish over fried fish (the baja style), but at least their fish was fairly fresh and flaky, and the breading light.  A bit of cabbage, onion, and mayo always goes well with fish but I'd have liked stronger flavors for the overall taco.\\n\\nBesides the big sports bar up front, they have a large, mustard-colored dining room where we ate.  Nothing fancy, very casual place, but pretty comfortable.  Our waitress was very sweet.  A fun meal overall, good margarita and nice tequila selection, but keep in mind the food is uneven."},{"name":"The Ravenous Pig","address":"565 W Fairbanks Ave","city":"Winter Park","stars":"4","text":"Good food, kind of a wait so try to make a reservation before going.

I went to the Hyatt because my gf was attending a Zumba conference and it is directly adjoining the convention center. Besides being likely the most convenient hotel for conventions it is great in so many other ways. The location is right off I4 and near a large collection of shopping, entertainment, and dining options, many within walking distance. Parking is easy whether it's valet or self parking and the bell hops are eager to help with luggage. Check in was a breeze as well and off to our room we went. The elevator taking us up 25 floors flew, I think it took 5 seconds for 25 floors! The rooms are close to the multiple elevator locations. Our room was very nice, standard king room. The bed area was separate from the wet bar, closet, sitting area, and bathroom so it was very roomy. Everything was very clean and in great shape. \\nWe stayed 4 nights and I got to see most of what all the hotel had to offer such as multiple restaurants, night club, spa, gym, pool, etc.. Our room was cleaned everyday and they left us extra towels, gf needed them with all the classes she was in. The pool was great and there was lots of staff to bring you drinks and provide you with towels when you enter the pool area. The pool was safe (lifeguard on duty during peak hours) and shallow but not so shallow that it was a baby pool.\\nRoom price was reasonable but everything else, restaurants and night club was very pricey. Only other negative was it seemed that not all the elevators were working at the same time and with a convention for thousands of attendees there ended up being long waits for the elevators.\\nI definitely enjoyed my stay, recommend it to families or singles, and I look forward to staying there again."},{"name":"Dots Cafe","address":"2521 SE Clinton St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Hate you Dots.\\n\\nLove you Dots.\\n\\nFood is actually decent.

Again, friendly service when I went to pay at the cash.\\n\\nWhen I opened the takeout containers, I was disappointed at the size of the portions. The mixed vegetable container was mostly empty.

The pad thai and fish cakes were both very good, and portions were a bit better, but again, I wish they would increase the portion size and raise the prices to do so. \\n\\nThe winner of the night, hands down, was the swimming rama.

I'm almost wondering if I should write it to begin with. We had a travelzoo deal for a 3 course dinner for 2. \\n\\nStarters:\\nI got the onion and apple tart with the salt spring island goat cheese.  When it came.. it was more of a puff pastry disc with caramelized onions and apples surrounded by a strange tomato sauce. And the Salt Spring goat cheese? It was more of a creme fraiche or something.  I actually asked my server for some goat cheese... because that's what was supposed to be there dag nabbit! My sister's Papaya and crab salad was probably the best thing of the whole meal. It was clean, flavourful, crunchy and light, with lots of crab chunks.\\n\\nMains: \\nPancetta wrapped Lamb sirloin with wild mushroom risotto.  I think there was only a tiny bit of wild mushroom on there--a couple of pieces of chanterelles.  Not to say there weren't other mushrooms. Most of the mushrooms were crimini and beech mushrooms which are quite inexpensive.  The mains were pretty filling and lasted me two more lunches.  My sister's salmon looked like it was a little on the over done/dry side though.  \\n\\nDessert: \\nGianduja chocolate tart with burnt orange caramel and vanilla gelato.  This was like different 2 desserts on one plate. There was a total disconnect. The chocolate tart was nice and went well with the caramel sauce, but the gelato was way too cold for the tart and the tart wasn't very melt-in-the mouth.  The gelato and oranges went well together, though. \\n\\nI can see this being a great place for out of towners."},{"name":"The One Sushi +","address":"2523 Caldwell Rd NE, Ste 1000","city":"Brookhaven","stars":"4","text":"This area was in desperate need of a high-end sushi place.

The filling ratio was good, and they were huge.  Your eyes will tempt you to order more, but they fill you up quickly.  I recommend the queso and the revuelta papusas (pork, cheese, and beans).  My only criticism is that I would want more curtido - the pickled cabbage that normally comes with papusas.  The papusas are served with a small side plate of curtido and salsa, and the curtido has some bite to it too.  Very good dish, overall.\\n\\nMy dining companions also ordered the lengua (beef tongue) tacos, and while it was not quite for me, I must say, the beef tongue was flavourful and very tender.  They raved about it.  Our server, the son of the owner, told us afterwards that the papusas and lengua tacos were his favourites, so I guess we chose right! \\n\\nThe only thing that we didn't love was the horchata.

OMG I had no idea what I was in for. Those two rolls were the best tasting ones I've ever had. My boyfriend went on the lighter side and ordered an appetizer of crunchy oysters (fried oysters) with a mixture of shrimp and wasabi sauce. That sauce tho....I've never had wasabi as a creamy sauce before and frankly I think I'd enjoy it this way. He also had ordered nigiri pieces of red and black tobiko, conch, octopus, and squid, all sampled by me and all were on point. \\n\\nOur server asked if we were interested in dessert and I asked what they have. The most interesting one that stuck out with me was the green tea tirmisu. HHHWHAT??!?! Taking two of my favorite foods and mashing them together like that? I had to try it.

There is what there is. And I think I spend about as much here as I would at a traditional dim sum place, but get a lot less food. Just an impression, hard to be sure. I never really know what I'm paying in those places. And that's ok. I don't always know what I'm eating either.\\n\\nThe dumplings are pretty good, the pork bao is ok, not my favorite, the lotus-wrapped meat and veggies is not my favorite either (and it's one of my favorite dim sum dishes).

There is a nice vibe in the seating area right when you walk in, though a little dated. We went here on a Tuesday for my girlfriends birthday. I had mentioned the occasion when making the reservation and was pleasantly surprised to be seated at a table covered in confetti with a birthday card from the staff. Very nice touch. The service was phenomenal, though it was a slow Tuesday in the restaurant so this was somewhat expected. The steaks we got were amazing, some of the best we've had in Orlando. Post dinner we got the creme brulee, which was also delicious. Overall this was a wonderful experience. My only complaint, which drops the overall score to 4 stars, was the price. I expected it to be expensive, but adding on separately priced salads and side dishes and very high-priced wine($21 a glass for mediocre wine!), it was much more expensive than I think any meal should be."},{"name":"Bartaco Boulder","address":"1048 Pearl St","city":"Boulder","stars":"4","text":"After a fabulous dinner at Bartaco in Reston, VA, just a few weeks ago, imagine my surprise to find one on Pearl St in Boulder.

The chinese sausage with rice cakes was delicious -- just the right amount of saltiness and chewy texture to the sausage paired with the glutinous rice cakes.  I am huge fan of their rice cakes and could probably have eaten them all on its own.  Another  notable dish is the oxtail curry.  I would recommend getting a side of rice for this dish. The curry is reminiscient of a Japanese style curry, so it doesn't have the coconut or lemongrass flavors present in other curry styles.   The hangar steak was nothing short of amazing and was perfectly cooked.   I'm not really fond of spicy cuisine, but the spicy noodles almost made me change my mind.  Speaking of which, I'm not sure if it's the dishes we ordered, but most of them had some degree of spiciness.  Even the radicchio salad with the peanut dressing had some great infused flavors, but it is also a bit spicy.  It is something to keep in mind when ordering, because it may not be apparent on the menu.  The kitchen gave our table a bowl of complimentary kim chee, which was awesome.

I love the view of the water, and they have patio dining for good weather. For such a lovely setting, the brunch menu was surprisingly normally priced ($12 for an omelette, $14 for crab cake benedict, etc), so everyone was pleased with the menu and the overall ambiance. \\n\\nI got the crab cake benedict and it was presented beautifully, with the 2 small benedicts sitting in a small cast iron skillet atop a wooden plank, with a piece of toasted peasant bread leaning against it. I was disappointed to see it didn't come with any sides, AKA some kind of potatoes like you'd normally get with a benedict (I guess the bread was the side?)... this was especially sad when I tried the potatoes that came with the omelettes my dining companions ordered, which were really tasty. (The omelettes themselves were also well received, everyone was happy with how light and fluffy they were.)\\n\\nThe benedict itself was OK... the 2 eggs were a bit less runny than I like my poached eggs, and the hollandaise wasn't memorable or plentiful, but the well-seasoned spinach under the eggs was a nice touch. The crab cakes themselves were chock full of crab, but weren't crispy on the outside at all, and since there was no English muffin on the bottom or any other additional component, the whole dish lacked textural contrast and was overall mushy and a bit lackluster. Also, given the size of the 2 small benedicts and lack of side dish, I was still a bit hungry after cleaning my plate, so it's a good thing we got 2 orders of the beignets for the table because I was able to fill up on those.\\n\\nThe beignets themselves were really tasty, although could have used a bit more of that famous honey Miel's known for IMO. The server ended up forgetting we ordered them, so they came out after we had already eaten half our entrees. He did offer to comp our next round of drinks to make up for it, but none of us really heard him say that or it just didn't register or something, so none of us ended up getting a second round of mimosas (also by that time, we were full and ready to move on anyways)... I appreciate the gesture, but I think it would have been better for them to comp either the beignets or our first round of mimosas.\\n\\nOverall, not the most impressive brunch I've had, but the setting was lovely and everyone else really enjoyed their own food and the overall experience."},{"name":"Taj Boston","address":"15 Arlington St","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"Oh, hi, fancy hotel.\\n\\nI will likely never have a corporate job that offers such luxuries as a company holiday party complete with awkward outside-of-work encounters and open bar...but my roommate who works for a top-secret biotech firm in Kendall does.\\n\\nIt's a blistery friday night around 5:30 pm and I am frantically altering my new go-to little black dress, donning my fabulous red holiday shoes, and pre-gaming with a glass of red wine.

I got all giddy inside because I'm a sucker for employees with good customer service practices.  It's very rare to see and was a relief compared to my last stay in Orlando.  The gentleman that checked me in was really nice but unfortunately, the King room that I requested when I booked was now a room with 2 double beds.  Not what I wanted.  If I wanted to sleep on a double bed, I would book at a Howard Johnson.  Despite my unhappiness, the best he could do was give me a room with 2 queen size beds.  Whatever, it was late and I didn't want to argue so instead of accepting his offer to pay $60 more a night and upgrade to a suite, I took the 2 queen beds.\\n\\nWhile I was waiting for my room keys, I looked around the lobby.  Gorgeous.  They just dumped millions into renovation and it showed.  He handed me my stuff and made me sign a piece of paper saying I'd be charged an extra $16 per night for internet and newspapers, etc.  I hate places that nickel and dime you like that.  So, basically, people that don't use the internet or read the newspaper are paying extra for nothing.  Stupid.\\n\\nThe room was nice, new and clean.  The bathroom was great and the mirror had a built in TV.  I spent a lot of time taking bubble baths and watching the news.  The bed was comfortable and there was an ipod dock so I could fall asleep to my favorite music.  The colors were calm and soothing with no tacky chain hotel finishes.  The view left a bit to be desired but I'm not much of a 'room with a view' type anyhow.\\n\\nI ordered room service a couple times and the prices in the book are not consistent with the prices on the bill.  That pissed me off.  Another thing that pissed me off was that they wanted to charge me $5 for a wineglass and another $3 to have someone bring it to me.  Meanwhile, they'll bring me a corkscrew for free.  See what I mean about being nickel and dimed?  I told them to keep their wine glass and just bring me the corkscrew.  I'm not too good to drink my wine out of a water glass.\\n\\nThe food selection here is minimal.  They have a 24 hour diner (B-Line Diner) that offers standard breakfast, lunch and dinner options.  The dessert offerings were impressive.  Cakes and tarts and pie, oh my!  The prices were a bit much but I suppose when your options are limited, it doesn't matter.  I didn't eat at the Napa Restaurant because the prices seemed a bit much for a solo dinner.\\n\\nA few complaints:  The carpet by my bathroom was soaked for much of my stay.  I don't know where the leak was coming from but for a newly built tower, it probably shouldn't be happening.  Upon closer inspection, the carpet had a musty smell, so it was not a new problem.

She had purchased a gift card for The Red Lobster (Giant Eagle fuel perks), having fond memories of dining there and hoping it would please the pescetarian in our group of five.  From the beginning, those of us being \\"treated\\" were weary.  As it turns out, we had reason to be.\\n\\nWe arrived about 5:30 p.m. on December 22nd.  From the moment we entered our dining area we ALL smelled an odor similar to urine, to the point it made some of us gag. One description offered by a family member was it may be the smell of seafood excrement.  Not sure exactly what it was.  We ordered anyway, because we were seated and didn't want to upset  our Golden Girl. As it turned out, the food was okay.  I probably had the best dish, being the fish tacos.  They had run out of Tilapia, and used Flounder as a substitute in the tacos.  (shoulder shrug here) The fried dishes, on the other had, were less appetizing.  The hand dipped fried Shrimp in coconut flakes, tasted more like coconut, than shrimp.  The accompanying Pina Colada sauce, is really sweet and should be reserved for those who truly love the stuff.  As for the Fish and Chips entree, the fish (not sure what type?) was the size of a 4x6 picture frame.  In other words, unnatural looking, frightful.  If you are a pescetarian, use caution when ordering grilled shrimp as the grill may have had meat on it as well. On the positive side, after an alcoholic beverage, and the arrival of more customers, the foul odor was not as profound.  Also, their signature, as much as you want, biscuits are still tasty, loaded with butter, garlic and cheese.\\n\\nJust as we were headed out,  feeling somewhat relieved, there were RAISED VOICES coming from what appeared to be the kitchen area.  So loud, one customer stood up to see what was happening and made a comment about employees being \\"rude\\"; several other customers stopped their conversations and turned to the direction of what can only be described as a VERBAL ALTERCATION BETWEEN  EMPLOYEES.  I saw one employee exit from the kitchen area, saying she had \\"nothing to do with that\\" and she was going to wait on her table.

With a seasonal menu and tantalizing new dishes regularly being added to the rotation, the Ravenous Pig is the kind of place it is possible to visit repeatedly without fear of menu ennui.  Sure some items, like the house-made pretzels with whole grain mustard and taleggio-porter fondue seem to appear with some regularity, but usually the policy is, if it sounds good, try it or you run the risk of never getting to (FYI, those pretzels are a dangerously delicious choice).\\n\\n   The menu ranges from smaller pub fare to much larger entree selections.  Usually the best method is to share several plates with other diners in your party to maximize the variety.  Also, cocktails are a must try, and worth the splurge since the are impeccably crafted.\\n\\n    The Ravenous Pig Old Fashioned (made with Bacon-infused Buffalo Trace bourbon, vanilla maple syrup, and bitters), is the ultimate manly drink, and one that I found far better suited to sipping.  Although it initially  came on very strong, the taste gives way to a smooth honey flavor, and finishes off with a lingering smokiness.  Adorned with a little sliver of crisp candied bacon, it took a good deal of restraint to not request 50 more.\\n\\n   Another Ravenous Pig cocktail classic is the \\"Gin & Jam,\\" which uses Rogue Pink Spruce Gin,  housemade rhubarb jam, local honey syrup, and house sour.  The jam and honey lend the drink a mild sweetness, yet there is also a touch of piquancy to produce an ideal balance.\\n\\n  The beer menu makes a fair attempt as well, although brevity is its strong point.  The Ravenous Pig doesn't bombard with a number of options and instead tends to focus on quality in what they do offer.  The diversity is sure to entice everyone from IPA hop-heads to sweet cider addicts.  Furthermore, they carry several local to Florida choices, like Cigar City and Cask & Larder (their own line), which are well worth trying.\\n\\n   The Ravenous Pig is one of Florida's best restaurants, one of the more interesting gastropubs to be found, and it showcases local ingredients in swoon-worthy manner.  Innovative libations, stellar service, and a downright ingenious culinary concoctions, make visiting an immediate priority."},{"name":"Wasabi House","address":"5500 Chamblee Dunwoody Rd","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3.5","text":"This is a Dunwoody staple for me.

Being the father of the worlds pickiest 8 year old we decided the California Grill was out of the question. So while searching Disney website we found the Wave.

Looking at the menu I was kind of baffled by the different ingredients and flavors used. My wife, who is the parent my daughter gets her pickiness from, looked at the menu and said \\" what did you get me into\\". \\n\\nWe had a lot of questions for the waiter and he was so helpful. He knew the menu and the ingredients used like the back of his hand.

The bread was a multigrain bread and it was served with butter that was topped with roasted galic. We all tried the bread and was pleasantly pleased. \\n\\nOur entrees arrived with little wait. My steak was cooked perfectly and  served with roasted potatos and greens. My wife's pork was delicious and was served with a spinich and galic which my wife actully tried and kind of liked.

(STRIKE TWO) To make a long story short (too late), I sent the sandwich back. Guess what? On the third and final time this sandwich left their kitchen, it came out WITH NO SAURKRAUT! (STRIKE THREE!!) By this time, I was pretty steamed, so I demanded to see the manager. Since the girl who was taking orders had to leave her station to go find the manager, orders leaving the kitchen piled up since she couldn't call out people's order numbers. There were also other diners waiting to order, so they had to wait too. Here's a sidebar - at most restaurants, the manager is out front helping during the lunch rush - not in the back doing God-knows-what. Anyway, the surly manager finally appeared after 3-5 minutes of more waiting. In a somewhat confrontational tone he asked me what the problem was. I related my story. His response?\\n\\n\\"Well, do you want saurkraut or not?\\"\\n\\nI'm hoping you know what my answer was. I got a refund, left the restaurant, and will NEVER go there again. Avoid Kneaded Pleasures like you'd avoid the plague. I wish I could give them 0 stars, especially since I've heard how they screwed that Topical Sno Cone lady out of her spot.\\n\\nHow does this hell-hole stay open?

I am sad to report that this is not the case. The food here is thoroughly mediocre. \\n\\nI ordered their seafood fettuccini while my wife ordered their chicken alfredo.

Our server was friendly and quick to fulfill all of our requests, but was not particularly proactive with the drink refills. \\n\\nThe meals came with a side salad. But the greens were wilted. They still looked fresh and tasted fine, so my guess is that they let the greens sit in the dressing for too long prior to serving. Either way, not ideal.\\n\\nThe meals also come with bread sticks, which was ok in my opinion, but was very similar in shape and texture to Olive Garden's. Just with less garlic salt on it. So your experience here will vary depending on how you feel about Olive Garden's bread sticks. \\n\\nNow for the main dish... What killed their dishes is the sauce. The sauce on everything was lacking in flavor and very bland. The alfredo sauce was especially egregious. It had the bland flavor of a hospital cardiac diet, minus the actual health benefits of a hospital cardiac diet. Which is too bad, because their home made pasta is pretty solid.  \\n\\nPersonally, if I wanted an inexpensive but mediocre Italian food in Columbus, I prefer The Spaghetti Warehouse which is only a few blocks away. If I wanted pricy but excellent home made Italian food, I would probably go to Moretti's in UA. The Florentine, unfortunately, is pricey and mediocre.

The kitchen put a wrong side dish on one plate and it was quickly corrected. I had my favorite orange horseradish crusted halibut. The orange burre balance sauce is fantastic! There is no harsh horseradish kick, just well-balanced flavor. Tip.. get asparagus instead of the mixed veg. Our server brought out the cake, extra plates, and even offered candles that we failed to bring. Although, he wouldn't sing... lol Thank you to the bar and our server for making it a great dinner out."},{"name":"Hyatt Regency Orlando","address":"9801 International Dr","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"Everything else was okay, except wrong information was giving about the business center hours at the front desk.

Perhaps it was what we ordered, as the wows and not so wows stemmed more from the meat dishes. Our experience with Dinesty was that its food is another stellar example of the  \\"clean\\"  food Chinese food you get in Vancouver. We started with the loofah and shrimp steamed dumplings, a pleasant change in offering from the usual vegetable dumplings. They were delicate in taste, with the fresh ingredients shining through along with the minced ginger. The wrapping was thin, though the filling was not soupy at all. We then had the Basa with vegetables, a dish large enough to share, our friendly waitress informed us, especially with our starter. She was spot on. The portion of entree was good. The fish was tender, melted in our mouths and the vegetables were stir fried to crunch perfection. The sauce tasty, not greasy and just absolutely delicious. Service overall  was amiable and the place was pretty, though too packed for me to take photos of the d√©cor. And of course clean, as this is Vancouver and the Chinese here seemed to be schooled in hygiene that eludes their NYC counterparts. This place does get a crowd so try to beat the it by coming earlier than 7:30 pm.

After your buzzer goes off, you walk to the counter to pick up your burger and to dispense your fountain drink.  My turkey burger was very good in size and content but was a little dry.

You can definitely get a great burger here - My wife did but I will need another visit, probably with the beef burger to see how much my head is really turned.  \\n\\nMy thoughts before another visit are Metro Burger have a nice model, but have lots of room to tweak things to add a little drama to the delivery of a quality burger.

This name alone is a fascinating pick for this establishment.  In Brazil, eating at the aforementioned places is common among the populace, for only at these 'botecos' can one truly get a quick bite to eat, known as 'petiscos' or appetizers, that range from a wide variety and selection of the most delicious staples of the Brazilian cuisine.\\n\\nTherefore, it's very refreshing to know that someone decided to bundle that entire cultural grub package and ship it all the way to Orlando.  The main difference being that the establishment itself is a clean, modernly decorated, trendy restaurant instead of precisely what its name implies, a hole in the wall.  It has become an instant hit with the local Brazilian community, specifically its younger crowd.  The place has enough outdoor seating to make it a great hang out spot for a few choice drinks and beer straight from Brazil.\\n\\nThe staff is all Brazilian, but they also speak fluent English.  The place is nicely set up where you do not get a feeling of being crowded and sitting on top of others.  The restaurant offers a great variety of not only \\"petiscos\\" that are popular in Brazil, but also lunch and dinner entr√©es.\\n\\nThe service was fantastic, our server was a sweetheart.  We had a big party with us, and there was plenty of food to go around as the portions were very generous.  The presentation was nice and the prices were extremely reasonable for the quality of the food being served.\\n\\nWe started off with some 'bolinhos de bacalhau' (see my photo), 'frango a passarinho' (see my phtoto), and 'aipim frito' (see my photo).  All three 'petiscos' were delicious.  The cod fish cakes were soft and chewy with a semi crunchy breaded shell; the small chicken wings were just at the right mix of dry and moist with a rich taste, and the fried yucca was, well, crunchy and very tasty.\\n\\nFor my main entr√©e I ordered the 'bife a cavalo' (see my photo) which can be translated literally to 'Steak by the horse' or something along these lines.  Not to be confused with horse meat, this essentially is a dish where eggs are draped above a skirt steak with caramelized onions much like a saddle straddles a horse.  This is the best verbal / written description I could formulate to properly describe this delicious dish.  The steak and eggs were complemented by the stereotypical brazilian rice and beans with steak fries and 'farofa', a type of flour served with some dishes in Brazil.\\n\\nThe restaurant also has a nice bar area (see my photo) that looks like a hybrid of Ocean Prime, Luma, and any neon back lit bar downtown.  The exception being that it is extremely low key in comparison.  Therefore, if you just want to come here to hang out and have a couple of drinks, it can be just that place for you.  At times there will be a local brazilian artist performing popular classic songs from the motherland, which can be nice and relaxing.\\n\\nOverall, the rating says it all: Go try this place out!\\n\\nValeu galera!"},{"name":"Conin Mexican Cuisine","address":"9111 S Barbur Blvd","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"Always ready to try a new place in southwest Portland getting good reviews, and I wasn't disappointed.

The Barlata Paella was also under seasoned and a big letdown.  \\n\\nWe didn't order wine and I didn't even look at the wine list but the Mimosa's were average.

My steak was served with a cabernet sauce, but it was not actually on the meat, but around the side dishes which included a white bean mash that was crusty on the outside from sitting too long.  Needless to say, it was not hot either.\\n\\nWe were finished with our meals for what seemed an eternity before our server came back to take our dessert order.  Dessert, the bright spot of the evening.  Dessert was actually trios of small desserts.  So with my husband's trio, I sampled six (trio = 3 x 2 =6 for the mathematically challenged).  They included raspberry cheesecake, blueberry compote, lemon cornbread, and several chocolate dishes.

Our group of 400 or so had an exclusive party at Sea World, which was just a short walk from the hotel. There were two sit-down meals during the proceedings, which I was dreading because I'm a vegetarian. Both times I politely declined the main course. At lunch time the server brought me a plate of penne in a creamy mushroom sauce. At dinner I was actually relieved that I would not be tempted by a main course, because I was so full from lunch. However, the server brought me a vegetable risotto with a side of asparagus. The servers did this on their own ... I was really happy with the salads and would have been fine without an entree. Of course I thanked (and tipped) them both. The dinner server even gave me a hug.\\n\\nThe shuttles had such bad reviews, I took one Yelper's advice and jumped on the city bus. It only cost $2 each way to and from the airport. There's a bus stop right behind the hotel (don't get dropped off by yourself at night like I did, though).

I would definitely get this again for a simple lunch.

My comments are mainly so that they are take client's opinions constructively.  Way. Too. Sweet :/  We took the chocolate pistachio, ginger pear, salted caramel and blood orange.\\n\\nChocolate pistachio: Absolutely NO pistachio flavor.  We might as well have ordered a chocolate fudge with a side of green crispy texture (the macaron).  They should do one pistachio, then one chocolate.  No mixing.  The chocolate is good but takes over any pistachio flavor.  If we expect a particular flavor combination, we want to taste it all of it.\\n\\nGinger pear: huh?  No ginger, no pear.  All we tasted was sugar.\\n\\nBlood orange: Very very orange..good. But it almost could have been one of those sugar orange candies you get on Halloween.  Again too sweet.\\n\\nSalted caramel (fleur de lys) - Their saving grace.  This was amazing.

BTW, you should completely avoid the crab cake -- 1 sinlge small crab cake on a few pieces of diced peaches for $14?  Definitely not worth it.  When our entrees finally arrived, I was amazed to see how small my cut of beef tenderloin was.

I no longer have to make a long trip to RIchmond to sample some of its finest cuisine.

The restaurant is clean and nicely decorated, especially the tea pot wall near the back of the restaurant! The chairs are good sized and comfortable to sit in. The owner must have put a lot of thoughts into preparing the restaurant.I don't think there's a private room to host a small dinner party though, it would have been a great addition. The food was amazing! I am very happy with all dishes I tried over the two days. My favourites are: XLB, marinated beef roll, tiatian noodle (peanut sauce noodle), and home-made sauce noodle. I also tried hot &sour soup, shredded pork with parsley & onion, shanghai style rice cake noodle, and daily stir friend veggies. I am amazed how fast the food comes out despite the restaurant being full. Other places I would have to wait 15-20 mins. to have the first food come and so on! This is a huge plus when you are very hungry and have been looking at the all the food on the menu to decide what to order. I am really impressed about this. I also noticed that everyone is wearing an ear piece communicating, and wonder if this is the source of quick turnaround? The kitchen can be viewed from the dining area and they've got a quite a few kitchen staff working away and about 4 people working specifically preparing dumplings, so this maybe another reason for the service speed. Now the price.. I think the price is very reasonable and with four adults, we ordered 8 dishes, and it came to only $62 before tip. What a steal for the quality of its food. \\n Only downside I can squeeze my mind is that the entrance and the waiting area is rather small, so only 3-4 people can stay inside, the rest will have to huddle outside the restaurant. Overall I would be frequenting this restaurant in the future.

Well, the voucher expired, however I still had the value that was originally purchased (37.50). My wife and I ordered the chicken croquettes appetizers which were overly deep fried and the chicken paste was dry. For our dinner I ordered the Boteco Steak & Eggs (should be good since it has their name on it right?). The steak was paper thin and tough almost like jerky. What saved it was the eggs which I had to eat with the steak. I also ordered a strawberry shake for my daughter. It came out in a narrow tall glass. I was afraid that it would tip over since my girl was only 2 yrs old. The waitress brought me a small plastic cup for kids. To my surprise all the shake fit inside this little kids cup. (Then shock at how much I paid for this little cup of sugar coated strawberry shake.  I wanted to share my experience on yelp and to try to understand why others were giving them such high marks. I noticed a 10% off coupon for \\"check in\\" at yelp, so I applied the link. When the bill came, I showed the waitress the yelp coupon and gave her my expired Groupon. The person in charge at the time was the bar tender because the owners trust him with the money (heh not sure why he disclosed that to me). The bar tender said that since I had a groupon I could not apply the 10% discount from yelp. I told him if I were to use the groupon pre-expiration and gotten the \\"deal\\" then I would understand, however I was using my value of the voucher which I paid for already. So he had to call the owner and the owner okay it. As he was running the bill again, he murmured that I wasn't suppose to have gotten 2 offers.. I was thinking, first your food sucks. Two, you still don't understand that my Groupon expired and so I didn't get a deal! (just face value) Anyhow, compared to the other brazilian restaurants that I've been where there was a lot of flavor and their steaks were juicy, I would not recommend this place. You can try it, but don't say I didn't warn you! \\n\\nPro: The only thing that was good was the lady waitress, she was nice (I tip her well, since it was her fault the food and the bar tender didn't get it).

My friend and I ordered a pot of chamomile tea and we shared a couple of desserts: Chocolate Raspberry Fool and their special of the day, Blackberry Cobbler.  Unfortunately, I wasn't too impressed with either dessert.  The Chocolate Raspberry Fool was a creamy white custard-like substance in a parfait glass with some pockets of chocolate fudge in it, and topped with fresh raspberries.  Except for the raspberries on top, it tasted somewhat bland.  The Blackberry Cobbler had too much crust and not enough berries.  Also, the crust was too \\"doughy\\" and didn't have any crispness at all, like a cobbler should have.

There were huge chunks, not the minced crap found in the frozen dumplings from Shaws.

The dumplings were amazing.  I ate 3 out of the 6 before moving onto the Beijing-Style:\\n\\nThese dumplings had a totally different shape, and I thought that was kinda cool.  These were steamed (while the Emperor is pan fried).  These were good, but not AS good.  I can't really identify 'pork'.  I know my beef, and my chicken and my shrimp, but blindfold me and feed me pork? I wouldn't have a clue.  The flavor seemed \\"complex,\\" and I don't do complex, plus the sauce that accompanied this one seemed a little vinegary.  Don't get me wrong they were good...(I wolfed down 3), but as I said before, I thought the Emperor was a bit better.  (Like 30% better.)  I went back and had another Emperor.  Amazing.\\n\\nDessert.  People will bitch that there is not enough Nutella in these bad boys, but I think they are perfect.  It doesn't over-power the bananas and it doesn't make your mouth all sticky, as a whopping spoonful is known to do.  According to the menu, these were pan fried, but were much crispier than the pan fried Emperor. (Maybe deep fried?)  Regardless, these were awesome.  You only get 4, but I suppose that will have to do.\\n\\nOverall, I judge restaurants on how soon I want to eat there again.  I want to have this again in about 10-14 days.

It is usually the least crowded outdoor grub spot in the ITP. Now that I've said that it won't be for long.\\nI've tried most of the dining options.

A half gallon of frothy pink flaming booze, is my idea of fun. So these buggers disappear with me around. \\nThe only downside is that the patio attracts a varied crowd. Including those who drag their kids everywhere they go. So, some days there is a contingent of crumb snatchers on hand. With their parents giving the stink eye to anyone smoking or being raucous.

My side was fettuccine Alfredo which was a disappointment, the cream sauce was bland and I only ate a few bites before neglecting for the rest of the meal. Our table order the tiramusu and cheesecake special they had. The tiramusu was the better of the two, definitely will return to try something else!"},{"name":"Basta","address":"410 NW 21st Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"I don't understand why this place is reviewed so poorly -- I've never had food or service here that was less than well above average.

Terrible and degraded over the years. Most likely a management issue. I have the right to say this because I've ate here at this chain for well over 20 years, this location is by far the worst of all visited.   Many times I have come onto this place to eat they have screwed up drive through orders.  I think during the day, like around noon is the prime time to visit this location if you have to eat here, and is the only time I would recommend it. Their late night crew is where this location suffers the most\\n, TERRIBLE POINT BLANK. Many times the food is cold or taste like it's been sitting out too long. Sometimes I will wait till I get home just to warm it up, just to be safe that I do not recieve food poisioning,  which is rediculous. Lots of times they are out of condiments which is rediculous for a place of established bussiness. One time I pulled up to the drive through window and waited there 20 minutes until they took my order and it was never taken. Not sure if they were asleep or having sex in there.  There was no one in line and it was about 2:50 am in the morning. NOTE: THEY ADVERTISE THEY CLOSE T 4AM definitely not the case.  Another time I visited, I recieved my order and looked into my drink their was particles floating around in my beverage that is gross and unacceptable in my book. I have tried to contact them through corporate and through their social media about the issues here. They refuse or ignore my complaints all together. Outside/inside of the place is generally kept clean. AS EXPECTED. The staff has stable attitudes, that can always be better ... but does not bother me. The pricing of the food is high. Seems like it's doubled over recent years. Take for example if you order a premium sandwich alone that by it self is about $5.00 where in past days that was $3.50 which was resonable then and still is today.  Especially for a fast food chain where their recieving high volumes of bussiness. You can walk out of there spending $15-20 dollars easily for a few items for yourself if your not careful. Otherwise unless eating here for nostalgic reasons only, like myself for the flavor, you really have no reason to eat here. You can get better quality food, freshly made, and HOTTER food  AT THE SAME PRICE from anyone one of the OTHER, local ITALIAN/GREEK food spots in the area. You would feel your money is better spent else where as well. I miss Dave.

It doesn't get stuffy in there, the staff is very friendly, and they've got some of the best wings I've ever tasted.\\n\\nThe menu is simple. 3 wings, 6 wings, 10 wings.  These come with a side of white and macaroni salad.  The sides aren't anything special, but it doesn't really seem as if the sides are meant to stand out.  The main attraction is the wings that come in three flavors.  I've had two of them (third will probably be sampled this weekend) and they're both delicious.  There's the original which is a bit spicy, but not overwhelming.  It brings out the flavors quite nicely without you having to dab your forehead as if you were getting \\"the vapors\\".  The other I've had is the (teri)Yaki.  Also delicious and not overly sweet.  But it's the thick batter they put on these wings that really makes them stand out from what else I've had in this city.  Each wing feels substantial, and if you weren't a glutton you'd only get three.  On the other hand, I'm disgusting and hoovered 10 of them with ease and joy.  \\n\\nYou can get boxes of wings in large quantities.  There's also ramen fries which is a fun gimmick, but really not all that special either.

Overall, the food quality was fairly good, with some dishes ranging from excellent to just decent.\\n\\nCons: Ordering here is like getting through the freakin' labyrinth with David Bowie. It was WAY too complicated. They appear to have too much on the menu, and only some of it is good. I'd prefer them to have fewer dishes and work on improving the quality of those.

It's a really good deal. And the food was delicious. Husband got the Chinatown wings again - he really likes them. And I got wine, he got 2 beers. The total came to less than $23.

Regardless, we decided to stick around.\\n\\nI started off with a Margarita, which was a bit too sweet in my opinion.  It was also relatively small for the price (but nothing outrageous when you factor in the fact that it's in a very touristy area).  We asked for chips and salsa and were given them.  Not sure if that's something they normally bring out on their own, but it was kind of odd that they didn't bring it out right away.  They're also big tostada chips instead of cut up tortilla chips.  Not the biggest fan of that.  The salsa was fresh and flavorful.\\n\\nI had the chicken fajitas which had big, tender, well-seasoned slices of chicken.  The peppers and onions were a bit undercooked for my liking, but were still good.  The rice, beans, and other toppings were excellent.\\n\\nThe one really odd thing about this visit was our waiter. He spoke so quietly, you pretty much couldn't hear him at all.  I don't know if he was new, shy, or that was just his demeanor, but it wasn't very welcoming at all.  Additionally, they are paperless and the waiter stands at the table while you pay and tip, which is a bit award.  Again, not a big deal, but just a bit awkward.\\n\\nI don't know if I would return for dinner again considering all of the other options around, but I definitely want to try the buffet out for lunch.

The 'green stripe' pizza was the better one, but the problem is the chicken. The 'chicken' comes in rectangular cubes and it is just full of fat and gristle and skin, and it is pretty terrible. I had to pull it off. But aside from that, the flavor of the pizza, the fired crust, and texture etc was really good. Just a shame about the chicken, and something to avoid. Everything else was OK.

I rarely leave bad Yelp reviews and it takes a lot to push me to. I can't stand Yelpers who use Yelp to hurt a business or don't consider the ramifications of leaving a bad review. While I want to leave one star, I'm trying to not be a bitch about it. I went here with a friend (who also has over 10 years service industry/restaurant experience) and his 12 year old son for lunch. My friend ordered some rolls and specifically asked to leave out the avocado because he's very allergic. When they brought out our orders, his rolls were literally nothing but rice and AVOCADO. This was not a complicated order to begin with. An order of edamame, a couple rolls with no avocado (specifically citing his allergy), a vegetarian bento box, and a beef teriyaki bowl. He asked that they re-make the rolls that would otherwise kill him. We're super friendly about it because we know how these things go. No big deal. It took an extremely long time for them to remake his order and we were literally the only people there other than a table of two. Still, not that big of a deal. We had ordered edamame as well (the very first thing we ordered) and it was never brought out. We went back up to the counter and told them we were still waiting for edamame. Then we were charged again for it. My vegetarian bento box  was literally devoid of any flavor. I get it, it's tofu and vegetables. But I had to add a heart stopping amount of soy sauce to the tempura dipping sauce just to taste something. The miso soup that came with our orders might as well have been brown water. Actually, that's literally what it was. Where do you even buy brown food coloring? We were out of water the whole meal (other than the brown water excuse for miso soup), in the middle of summer. I've also never EVER seen my friend not finish sushi rolls...I'd say about 70% of our meal was left to continue dying on the table after we left. We both remarked that they were the worst rolls we've ever had. Keep in mind, you pay/tip at the counter before your meal...we tipped over 40% because we're service industry and that's how we do. The service was poor which was fine but there was nothing else redeeming. It was also way overpriced for the quality. I didn't have high hopes for a North Lamar white people sushi joint, but when you mess up an order 3 times and an hour later you have nothing but terrible food to show for it, you get a little pissed that you got overcharged and not offered a water refill. We walked out of there and I remarked \\"Damn. I might actually have to leave a bad Yelp review.\\" And I feel like crap about it. But not nearly as bad as I felt from my lunch.

I think it was chipotle sour cream that came along with several of our dishes and the calamari. We needed additional servings of that condiment for sure. \\n\\nI ordered the Shredded Enchiladas Rojas with black beans and couldn't even finish all of the rice or beans. But enjoyed the main so much I probably would have ordered a third one a-la-cart if I could possibly stomach any more food it was so yummy.  Drinks were delicious we ordered more than each even at lunch in a Saturday. Mojito started us off. Our service was very personal and attentive even to our demanding appetites, and expectations as patrons.

I continued this trend until today, always ordering breakfast or lunch and always tipping the person taking my order. The food is average, but I come mostly because I work from and I like having the option of supporting a small, neighborhood business that was close to home and there was free wifi. Since the change in ownership, I've noticed that after 45 minutes to an hour I get booted from the wifi; this NEVER happened with the previous owners. This happens regardless of whether I'm there during peak hours or not. I'll say that even during peak hours the restaurant isn't busy enough so that I'm depriving other customers a place to sit. I've seen a subtle decline in the service since the change in ownership, but this is primarily been on the part from who I believe is the new owner. I witnessed a rather heated exchange between him and a gentleman who complained that a sandwich had made the man's wife ill. The owner was incredibly defensive and denied any changes in suppliers, recipes or quality since the change in ownership. Sensing there was no progress to be made from the discussion the gentleman ended the discussion and left the restaurant. This morning (around 8 am), the ladies restroom was in disarray. There was toilet paper on the floor, paper towels overflowing the trashcan and \\"skid marks\\" in the toilet. This change has been a HUGE disappointment. This used to be a place where people could gather, spend a few hours working, eating, playing mah jong, etc. Now, you have an owner who raises his voice to patrons, filthy bathrooms, condescending signs about coffee and soda refills and you get booted from the wifi without explanation.

If you've had burritos from mom-and-pop places in California, the burritos here may resemble those in looks, but not taste.  The only reason why I came here for a burrito was because I had a craving and didn't want to walk to the existing Boloco near the Common.  The salsas need lots of work, as does the guac.

Anyway, we were talking about places to eat and after a hilarious discussion about how Beast is overrated, we started talking about actual good restaurants. Smallwares came up. I was intrigued. It wasn't until months later that I tried the place. In a quiet neighborhood, on a brisk fall day I walked into the restaurant at around 3pm. The bartender waited on me. She was friendly and recommended a couple of plates to me. I chose the pork skin ragu with rice cakes, chili paste and pickled fennel ($12). It took about 13 minutes to prepare and when it came out it was beautiful. The rice cakes were similar to gnocchi and the ragu had the same sort of earthy taste that can only be found in a true Italian bolognese. The fennel added a nice crunch and freshness as well. This dish made me a fan of the place for sure. I could of course critique it from a harsher standpoint and say that because the dish did remind me so much of Italian food, I was missing the depth of flavor that the meat normally has when braised in a red wine. It was a little one noted without the fennel in the bites. But, that one note was a delicious one so I did not mind a bit. \\n\\nI recommend this place to anyone that wants something a little different.

Obviously, I am too focused on traffic to be aware of my surroundings. My timing favored me; the lunchtime crowd had dissipated, and there were but a few customers in the small deli. I enjoyed my turkey melt on a croissant, a side of fresh potato salad, and a small cup of Jell-O, and I drove on refreshed. \\nIf you are in the area and you too have had enough mass-produced fast food to last a lifetime, this is a worthwhile stop.

The tapas scene there exploded in the early '00s, and I worked for two of the best in town.\\n\\nAnd, while I enjoyed some of the things I had here, and the service was great, I'm not sure this place is it. Still, it has potential, and maybe I need to try a few more things on the menu. \\n\\nOur bartender was fantastic. Knowledgeable and friendly, he mixed out cocktails well, and guided us though the menu. Heck, he even knew about the calimocho and offered to make me one! I stuck to the drink menu, though, and they were decent, but mostly hit or miss.\\n\\nThey have a decent sherry and wine list, though there's not much there for those of us on a budget. Heck, after 4 tapas and 4 drinks apiece, we had a $100 tab on our hands. I'm hoping a happy hour develops here!\\n\\nFood:\\nPiquillo Peppers stuffed with Dungeness Crab- The flavor here was lovely. The sauce they were in was smokey and piquant. The main issue I had here is that pairing crab with those flavors can overpower the flavor of the meat. Furthermore, if you're going to be using something like dungeness (and charging accordingly), don't have it all ground up inside like it might as well be a crabcake. Keep those big flakes, and the flavor and texture will be tons better. \\n\\nAhi Escabeche- This was one of our favorites. Tuna just barely seared and marinated, with Pimienton oil in which the peppers and onions were slowly cooked. All topped with Fris√©e. And let me tell you, this is one of two dishes I've ever had that's made me enjoy fris√©e.\\n\\nPulpo y Papas- A great traditional tapa that I've always enjoyed. It's flavorful without being overpowering. The portion is a bit small for what they're charging, but this was definitely another favorite for us. \\n\\nPatatas Bravas- The dish I judge all tapas places by. I've had this dish in so many different incarnations, it's kind of ridiculous. My favorite way is having the fried potatoes tossed in a mixture of a piquant tomato-paprika sauce and garlicky alioli. And I like a nice spice level. Alternatively, I enjoy the fried potatoes just tossed in that smoked paprika mixture and served with a spicy piquant alioli for dipping. What doesn't float my boat is a bunch of potatoes with two squirts of these sauces over the top. That just doesn't remind me of what this dish is to me. And the tomato sauce they used just didn't have much oomph to it. In fact, we poured the piquillo sauce over the potatoes, and that made the dish a bit better.\\n\\nGoat Cheese Mousse- Get this one. Just get it, and eat it, and spread it all over your face. Because it's magic. \\n\\nI'll have to come back and try some more tapa staples and some of their more interesting offerings."},{"name":"Chicken Now","address":"8200 Vineland Ave","city":"Orlando","stars":"1.5","text":"I was expecting much worse after the reviews but it was good.

The service is pretty fast & efficient, but also 'warmer' than your usual Chinese restaurant.  However, I wasn't wow'd by their food.  For a \\"Dumpling House\\", I find their soup dumplings mediocre.  The filling was not flavorful, there wasn't a lot of 'soup' from it, and the skin was a bit tough on top.  I've also tried their wonton with chili sauce, which also lacked in flavor.  I did like the chilled cucumber and dessert dish though.

This is an obituary--Not the Barlata we knew and used to love! So Sad. Food quality is now terrible. Service is bad. And they're pulling an egregious BAIT AND SWITCH by charging you for JAMON IBERICO (the finest, most beloved ham of Spain) and SERVING JAMON SERRANO instead!!  They figure customers are too dumb to know the difference. That's like paying $20 for a slice of Oscar Meyer sandwich meat.\\n\\nFor a Spanish restaurant to falsely claim they're serving you Iberico is a mortal sin. Having savored this ham many times in Spain, and in legitimate Spanish restaurants across the US, it was easy to spot the imposter. We called out their trick to the waitress. She claimed that it was supposed to be plain ham. These guys will sit on purgatory next to Trump for this culinary felony. \\n\\nThe rest of the the dishes were ill-prepared and bad-tasting.  Calamares, gambas, and cordero--these had been old favorites at Barlata for the last 4 years. Now, they were not much different than eating at Lubys or the old Jester cafeteria. Bland, soggy, just wrong. \\n\\nThe old Barlata would never serve this stuff. The old Barlata staff would have taken note of our complaint. At the old Barlata we would not have endured long waits for tapas or the check. They must have new management and/or polices: squeeze every penny, and screw the customers. Unfortunately this is the accelerated life cycle of many restaurants in Austin: Start great, establish a big following, sell or re-define your objectives, cut back on quality and service, die off, and close. \\n\\nI used to have another favorite tapas place in Austin. It was authentic and awesome in the early 2000's. Malaga then spiraled downhill and imploded. Barlata is on the same path. \\n\\nWe were regulars, and live nearby. We had many intimate dinners, tasty brunches, celebrations with friends, and great memories at Barlata. Sadly, the old Barlata has left us. \\n\\nKeep your $20 Serrano ham, Barlata. I can get true Iberico at Central Market and even on Amazon. Better yet, there are too many truly good Spanish Tapas restaurants in Austin to ever visit a has-been again. Oh wait, there's one just a few blocks south of your location. Time to try that new kid while you fade away. It was a good run.

This was by far our worst meal during our 5 day stay in Vancouver. Our entire experience was a disaster. We had the most incompetent server that I've ever experienced. My boyfriend and I came in to have a couple beers and pizza. There were only four beers on tap and she had no idea how to pour a beer or anything about the beers they serve. Instead, she had to ask her coworkers about the beers they serve. Once we finish our beers, we had to get her attention to ask her for another beer. To put in perspective, there were only two other parties at the time. \\nShe seemed more interested in speaking with her friend at the bar rather than taking our order. \\n\\nWe ordered a regular pizza with sausage, pepperoni, artichoke, garlic, and onion with regular sauce and mozzarella. I knew that The price listed included three toppings, but I didn't know what the price was for additional toppings. (It's $1.91 per additional topping)\\n\\nAnother server brought us plates and silverware for our meal. But our server didn't realize that we hadn't eaten yet because the pizza had taken so long to come out, so she cleared our plates...even though the plates were spotless. About five minutes later, the other server realize that our plates of been taken away knowing that our pizza had just come out. Our server just laughed it off then we finally got our pizza 45 minutes after we ordered it. \\n\\nNow onto the pizza...first off, this place can commits the ultimate sin of not cleaning their ovens during operating hours. Now why this is a problem is because Ingredients that fall into the oven burn into charcoal. This charcoal flavors   every pizza with burnt charcoal. \\n\\nOnto the toppings, they were basically nonexistent. Instead of your traditional round pepperoni, they took that round pepperoni and finely diced them then lightly sprinkled it onto the pizza. We paid an extra $2 for barely any toppings. There was hardly any sauce or cheese. All the toppings were skimpy. \\n\\nFinally, paying the bill took forever as well. This was by far the worst pizza place and definitely the worst service I have ever experienced. I could forgive the service but the pizza alone is not worth it.

To start with, our waitress greeted us before we even had time to sit and asked us if we were ready to order less than 2 minutes after that. The 55 salad is quite good and the habanero pork chops were okay - though not at all spicy as one might logically expect given its name. The grouper sliders were not enjoyable at all. They somehow managed to make a typically delicious fish completely unpalatable. The service was spotty, our waitress had a table of family or friends nearby that was clearly her priority and it was a bit uncomfortable watching her socialize as our dining needs were unmet. Finally, we asked someone at the hostess stand if she could take our picture and she declined as she proceeded to take a call and leave us waiting for someone to be kind enough to take a photo.

It is difficult to review Mattie's on its own merit because I was expecting it to be the long awaited, promised, reopening of Green Pastures. It is NOT! The only thing left of Green Pastures is the outside of the building. Frankly, if this review was to compare Mattie's to Green Pastures it would receive only 1 star. It is a far cry from Green Pastures and therefore was very disappointing. First of all we felt the restaurant's choice of giving a ticket to claim one alcoholic beverage off a limited cocktail menu to be tacky. I missed Green Pastures yummy, intoxicating (and I don't mean the alcohol) Milk Punch. Mattie's had a cocktail identified as a Milk Punch but it was a thin, watery concoction containing cream. I guess the sell of Green cPastures did not include the recipe for the Milk Punch. It was also clear that the restaurant was attempting to increase the bill for brunch as a wine list was provided along with the limited cocktail menu. My husband felt the wines which are always overpriced at any restaurant compared to what they can be purchased for at a grocery or liquor store to be even more pricey than what he is accustomed to paying at other high end restaurants. The brunch itself was also disappointing. The food that was offered for the most part was good but limited. There were perhaps 4-6 salads; the best being a beet salad with walnuts. Also a mixed salad with shaved vegetables--pretty, but I couldn't identify most of the vegetables by taste. The others were nothing special. The \\"skewer\\" offering was 1/2 a cherry tomato with a bit of cucumber and fat back. Oysters on the 1/2 shell and shrimp cocktail which was 1 medium to largish tail on shrimp in a small glass with cocktail sauce were on ice. If you wanted cocktail sauce for the oysters you needed the shrimp cocktail. There was a large chafing dish of plain white rice to accompany an oriental offering which I skipped. Breakfast items consisted of eggs Benedict--slightly overcooked and not sure what the meat was. I question that it was Canadian bacon in that it was a slightly grey color. Bacon and 2 types of sausage bites were present. French toast was more like a bread pudding. There was not a waffle or omelet station. Other offerings were creamed potato slices (sauce looked thin, runny) and a vegetable that I don't remember what it was. Ham was sliced and piled in a chafing dish to keep warm. Cutting station had beef and lamb. Basically that was it. Desserts were very disappointing: mini √©clair, cheesecake bites, and a cupcake that was orange in color--supposedly carrot--with a thick, hard frosting. Cheeses were present. Salmon bit on a pumpernickel? cracker and cheese spread. Service was a little slow. I have been to restaurants that add gratuity to the bill for large parties but Mattie's added a 22% \\"service fee\\" for a check for 2 people. I was looking forward to going expecting Mattie's to be a reopening of Green Pastures with a new name but even after I realized this was not the case it was still disappointing. Austin has a number of really outstanding restaurants and I don't think Mattie's is one.

I called to make a reservation a few hours in advanced asking for the kitchen table. I made my reservation for 6:30~ we get there at 6:30 and the hostess tells me they had us down for 5:30.. no, but Ok- no big deal. He then says that he can put us in the kitchen seat, as we are about to be seated he says there's another party coming in at 7:15. We sat down- and as we waited for our server the male hostess scrambles in the kitchen yelling \\"CAN ANYONE HELP THEM!?\\"  the female hostess came by and I told her if it we didn't mind moving to a different table (we were out with friends and did not want to be rushed in and out in 45 minutes) because we didn't want to be rushed. She (Lashanda) responds with \\"Well we probably won't move you because you guys got the table anyways\\". and walks away. We ignore it.

But after we ordered, I had noticed that some people at other tables had salads, which were not on the menu. Many other people also had bread, but I thought maybe that was something you had to order separately. We later asked the waiter who said that bread and salads are available on request (but only on Sundays). Would have been nice to know. I thought it really should have been offered, especially considering it was our first time there. Anyway, it took quite a while to get our food. Though when it came, it was good. The waiter hardly ever made it back to us and when I tried to flag him down he said he'd back over in \\"one minute.\\" This \\"one minute\\" ended up being at least ten minutes and, needless to say, we spent way more time sitting there than we cared to.

When I have a drink, I don't want chewy, gummy, slimy balls shooting into my mouth and trying to lodge themselves in my esophagus.  So I tend to avoid the boba here, but that doesn't mean I don't really like this place.\\n\\nWhen I come here, I almost always order the snow drinks.  They are icy drinks with creamer, and are delicious fruit drinks.  My favorite is the pineapple, which is incredibly refreshing, but I will also get the peach, blueberry, strawberry, and occasional honeydew.  They never disappoint. Getting a drink here is a similar price to a frappuccino, and can often be more satisfying.  The huge straws (to fit the boba) mean you never spend your time in a frustrated attempt to suck up a chunk of ice that won't fit.  You just get a nice, constant stream of fruity satisfaction with every sip.  \\n\\nThe only real negative I have with Boston Tea Stop is that sometimes some of their drinks are permeated by a flowery jasmine flavor, even if your drink doesn't have jasmine.  It's like they made a jasmine drink earlier and the flavor never came out of the container it was mixed in.  It can ruin an otherwise good drink, and is just generally disappointing when it happens.

The best part of being a \\"regular\\" is the staff greeting you by name with friendly smiles when you come to pick up your sushi after a long day at work or classes. It would be nice to have brown rice option and maybe some more unique rolls, however this is a perfect addition to Dunbar and 16th! A convenient, quality sushi joint that uses fresh ingredients and has great essential sushi rolls, and is superbly priced, Dunbar Sushi is straight-up great."},{"name":"The Matador","address":"1438 NW 23rd Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"Don't order the 20 dollar steak, was terribly overlooked and an overall small portion in comparison to the abundance of rice and beans.

Food was cooked well and coffee was hot. \\n\\nI think the key to eating in a place like this and being happy with your meal is knowing what to order. Do they have a 'prime rib night'? Yes. Should you expect excellent quality beef cooked to perfection from what is essentially a diner? No.\\nLikewise with other items. They're not going to give you great Italian food either are they?

But it has a great light custardy texture with thinly sliced meyer lemons between the buttery pie crust.  I was little leery of eating sliced lemons with the peels left on, expecting a bitter taste, but I never got any of that.  A perfect amount of sweet and tanginess.  Get it while it's in season!\\n\\nThe bourbon pecan pie is one of the better pecan pies I've had in the NW.  It has a great consistency and the pecan filling is not mushy.  The chocolate cream pie is easily one of my favorites!  They use unsweetened and dark chocolate -- that is so genius, it just elevates this pie to a level of awesomeness.  I've had my share of chocolate cream pies around town and this one is seriously one of the best.  Don't be put off by the overwhelming display of freshly whipped cream on top of the pie -- it's actually quite light and is a good complement to the dark chocolate cream."},{"name":"Boston Kitchen Pizza","address":"1 Stuart St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"i am absolutely fed up and done with this place....On several occasions I order and five minutes later arrive and they have locked the door..

I love mochi.  I love Asian cakes and cookies - they are generally lighter and much less sweet.  That said, this place was a disappointment.  I stopped by this place last night as a result of rave reviews posted here. \\n\\nFirst off, I do want to give kudos to the place because it was extremely clean, unlike many of the dingy Chinatown places.  The girl behind the counter was extremely nice and helpful. \\n\\nI purchased : a taro bun, a violet taro bun, a pineapple bun, and a scallion bun.  \\n\\nUnfortunately, the buns were all basically hamburger buns injected with filling.  It was disappointing, to say the least.  The flour was way over processed.  It didn't seem very \\"high quality\\" to me.  \\n\\nThe worst was pineapple cream bun, because it was filled with a sour tasting cream that had a grainy texture.  How the hell can a pineapple & dairy (cream cheese?) filling be grainy?  It wasn't very pleasant. Or flavorful.  Except for the sour taste.\\n\\nNext up was the taro filled bun.  Again, picture a hamburger bun filled with (not very tasty or flavorful) taro cream.  At least it wasn't sour.  But the filling was still somewhat grainy.  \\n\\nNow the scallion bun that I got was somewhat interesting.  I got the savory one since my western palate cannot tolerate scallions combined with sugar.  I really liked the topping.  The bun could have used more of it, but the scallion, garlic, and cheese combo was yummy.  It also would have been alot more yummy not on a hamburger bun like substance.  \\n\\nThe thing that I actually did like was the violet taro bun.  It has a gem-like purple hue to it as they wrap the bun in a layer of (mochi?).  I'm actually not sure.  The taro cream filling and bun are actually the same as the plain taro cream  bun, but the wrapping really makes a difference.  It changes the texture and makes it a whole lot more fun to eat.  If they sold the purple stuff separately, I would go out of my way home to purchase it almost daily.  But, as it is wrapped around a hamburger bun, I don't think that I will be back any time soon."},{"name":"Bloc Somerville","address":"11 Bow St","city":"Somerville","stars":"3.5","text":"For a weeknight study session, Bloc 11 is awesome.

I got a 730pm reservation off Open Table...not really necessary, but I'll take the points.  I was with two colleagues and we were hungry.\\n   First off, the ambiance is as described by other reviewers...and  while we were there it live music night, a low key vocalist playing the guitar.  The restaurant was clean, not too well lit (but not too dark) and we were seated in a pleasant booth.\\n    Service was good, but not great.  I have to chalk that up to our server who admitted at once that he was \\"the new guy.\\"  He was hard to miss...at 6'8\\".  He struggled through our drink order and he forgot the olives in my friend's dirty vodka martini.  He didn't have to be reminded though and brought them right away.\\n   We asked about the cactus app as described by other Yelpers. He made it sound like it was the best appetizer on the planet so we ordered it.   It was okay, not great.  Fried cactus....okay, that's just what it was.  We were happier with the elk sausage skillet...a skillet (duh) filled with sausage swimming in bbq sauce, onions, tomatoes etc.  What made it elk sausage?  Dunno....could have been Hilshire Farms kielbasa.  Nice bread basket included two types of corn bread and some unidentifiable butter spread (something was in it).  Our rookie waiter should have told us what i was when he brought it.\\n    We were in a mood for meat so we all ordered steak (the 21 ounce ribeye, the bone-in cowboy and the sirloin).  We all got the extra mushrooms and a variety of sides.\\n    The steaks come with salads.  Nothing more than iceberg, the obligatory two grape tomatoes and some tasteless carrot shavings.  I had the tequila ranch dressing....it tasted like ranch dressing.\\n    The steaks were very good.  My cowboy ribeye was supposed to be bone-in, but there was no bone.  It was done as ordered and was very tasty.  They kitchen screwed up and gave my colleagues the wrong dish.  One had a side of grilled shrimp.  \\n   We all had the mushrooms....decent but $3 for about 25 cents worth of mushrooms is a bit much.  My side was grilled zucchini and squash (isn't zucchini squash????).  One of my friends had the corn and mashed potatoes (he passed on the salad) and my other friend had the green beans.  We asked for a side of mashed potatoes to split, but our rookie waiter forgot about those and we didn't want to stress him out and remind him.\\n   I sampled the mashed and they were excellent...tasted quite homemade.  The other grilled veggies were precisely that...grilled and very nice.  \\n   As we finished our dinner the waiter brought over the check...didn't ask if we wanted dessert or coffee....which we thought was odd, but chalked up to lack of experience.  We were full anyway.  \\n    So, how was our Mesa Ranch experience?  Food was solid and the steak was very good.  Service was spotty...though our young waiter could be held responsible for that.

Me and my husband paid $50 for 4 drinks on our bill alone.   The food itself was great. The steak was great and the mushroom appetizer was very good but our experience was overshadowed by poor customer service (primarily by the suboptimal response from the manager and the fact that my son was scolded by the waitress for touching his soda too soon) and feeling as though we were price gouged.

And waited. In agony as our queso cooled. We eventually went to the bartender who helped us get some more chips. Then, after another 10-15 minutes, the chips were out again and we still had a king's ransom of queso left.

It's some of the most consistent, delicious, and affordable Indian food anywhere in the city.\\n\\nTheir Chicken Vindaloo is surprisingly quite fiery (as it should be), the Korma (never one of my favorite Indian dishes) is appropriately medium-spiced but the sauce is a little thin for my tastes. Strangely, my favorite dish is the mild and rather creamy Makhani - it's much richer and has a more complex flavor than many other iterations of the dish, and has a unique and very distinctive aroma and flavor...is that corriander? I don't know, maybe if I was a true foodie with a well-trained palette I could accurately ID that ingredient; all I can say is that I can immediately smell and taste it when I enjoy Gandhi's Murgh Makhani, and I haven't detected it in any other Indian restaurant's version of the dish...so delicious!\\n\\nThe Makhani is my go-to dish, and for $6.25 it comes with deliciously fluffy, never sticky basmati rice, a veggie dish of your choice (my 1st choice is always the Chana Masala), a wedge of pita bread (surprisingly not too poor of a substitute for actual tandoori naan), and condiments of your choice (raita, cilantro, a spicy tomato-based chutney, etc). This is my idea of comfort food.\\n\\nThe insider (or total glutton's) tip: go on Friday when they offer a ridiculously priced, massively portioned combo: 1 lamb or shrimp entree, 1 chicken entree, 2 veggie entrees, the standard rice/pita/condiments, AND a free soda, for under $8!!! This is a true gut-buster of a meal, and if I somehow manage to consume the entire thing I won't be hungry again until Saturday afternoon!\\n\\nAnother tip: Unless you order just one item and/or eat REALLY fast you might want to order your meal To-Go even if you plan on dining there (they've got a few seats downstairs, and many more upstairs). I know it's not as environmentally responsible (sorry Travis, you do make a good point), but the paper plate they serve your food on is just not up to the task of supporting the very liquidy curry dishes. Maybe if they used a coated paper plate, or had re-usable dishes (come on, you can train even downtown office-dwellers to bus their tables, right?), but until that happens I think I'd recommend going with the plastic To-Go boxes to prevent messy plate disintegration.\\n\\nAlright, so where does Gandhi's stack up in comparison to the other Indian food options here in Portland? Quite well actually. It's cheaper and better than almost all the downtown brick and mortar Indian lunch spots (I've got to try and hit up some of those carts), and is of good enough quality that if the very friendly owner ever decided to open up a sit-down, full-service dinner restaurant I would already lay odds that it would rival the very best in pdx.\\n\\nIf you eat lunch downtown on weekdays, and enjoy Indian cuisine, I enthusiastically recommend you try Gandhi's! And as a bonus, they're good citizens too, frequently giving money to local/national/international charitable efforts. Good people, good prices, great food!"},{"name":"Joe's On Juniper","address":"1049 Juniper St","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3","text":"joe's on juniper = pleasant patio + BIG ketel & tonics + $4 hot dog and chips\\n\\ni went on a busy friday night and waited about 30 minutes for a table on the patio, which seems to be their usual for weekend nights. their ketel and tonics had to be at least 12 oz, which was much appreciated. i recommend their homemade chips with bleu cheese dip.\\n\\nthe service was rushed/fast, but still very friendly. i'll be back for trivia and a $5 martini or two."},{"name":"Palio Dessert & Espresso House","address":"1996 SE Ladd Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"3","text":"Worst service I have ever received in Portland.

We find it a little counter productive to play loud hip hop music but then be offended when people engage w the song. Our intention was not to offend anyone and we wished we had been spoken to in a way that could have been resolved professionally and appropprately. The second we came into dillons the female server who was working in the area we were in was absolutely miserable and had terrible customer service. She kept bumping into my friends and literally pushing them out of her way several occasions (Understandable it's a bar and crowded area, but have some manners and say excuse me). There was actually an instance prior to our DANCING that a couple of my heterosexual friends were dancing in a very similar manner earlier in the night why weren't they asked to leave? I'm willing to bet because nobody even batted an eye at a male/female dance partner. The manager stated or whoever he was because he refused to disclose his position or name, (terrible leadership for an establishment), \\"we don't condone that type of lifestyle\\", and asked us to leave without explaining himself by what he meant. My fianc√© even asked him to clarify because we were both so confused by what he was referencing when he said \\"lifestyle.\\" Neither of us said anything about a hate crime because we didn't even understand what he was saying at first. He repeated himself twice and knows exactly what he said which is probably why he cowarded in the corner while the bartender took his role as the \\"manager\\". We were happily leaving just wanted his name. We are saddened because we love Dillons too, their owners are very generous and active members in the gay community here in Boston.

I can't say it's an overly friendly atmosphere, but a few employees we encountered were very nice. \\n\\nWe had plenty of time to figure out the ordering system since nobody acknowledged us after we were seated. Like many sushi places, food and drink options are listed on a slip of paper, and you can mark the items you want to try with a small pencil. Unfortunately, we also had time to notice the unappetizing, dirty hot sauce containers at our table that had dried gunk around the sides and tops of the bottles. I would imagine that's a quick fix with a few wipes of a sanitary towel, but it wasn't a great first impression. Finally, our server appeared and brought us water and took our order. \\n\\nThe food is very good. The tacos are reasonably priced and flavorful. Most items are a bit too onion or cilantro forward to my taste but everything was tasty. I'm not a big fan of a lot of large chunks of raw onion that vary in length and shape. The flavor of raw onion can easily overpower a dish. There are unique items, though, and overall, the flavors are intriguing and bold. The presentation is very nice as well. \\n\\nThe Baja fish taco is served with perfectly fried fish that's crisp on the outside and tender on the inside. The shrimp bahn mi taco is fresh with strong flavors that will wake up your taste buds and crunchy vegetables that add a wonderful texture. In addition to several other tacos that were also good, we sampled the chicken soup and tuna poke bowl. Of the two, I would suggest the soup, though both are delicious. I thought the poke bowl had too many crispy onions on top that overpowered the great flavors of the dish itself, but underneath the large pile of onions was a beautiful mixture of tuna, avocado, and sauce. \\n\\nI'm hesitant to go back because I felt uncomfortable, almost as if our being there was an imposition to some of the staff, however, the food is so good that I might give it another try. Our server was also very sweet and made me feel more welcome before we left.

This one weekend away from our children and spouses is treasured time, and has always been fun, cleansing and stress free. Not this time. I won't bore you with the details of exactly what happened, but the summary is that The Taj hotel was overbooked, overwhelmed, and understaffed. The lobby was mayhem and there were many unhappy guests, including the seven of us. During several frustrating situations over the course of the weekend, we dealt exclusively with one manager there, Patrick. He treated us like school girls on spring break; he was rude and condescending. I have received better customer service in Target and this is supposed to be a 5 star hotel. It is not to say that there weren't several staff that were wonderful. Jesse delightfully took all of our bags to the one room-- with one bed--they initially put the seven of us. And the doormen were always courteous and helpful. They all genuinely apologized about the situation and the inconveniences. But the manager, Patrick, was horrible--and not once did he apologize.

Now that I have, they're not bloody likely going to be able to get rid of me.\\n\\nSo far I've sampled a plethora of their offerings, and found none to be wanting.  Their empanadas are HUGE, the breading unbelievably flaky and tasty, filled with your choice of meat (shredded chicken, beef or pork).  I normally get the pabellon empanada, which has black beans, beef, rice and plantains.  Speaking of plantains, HELLS YES.  I am a huge fan of plantains, and a multitude of their meals makes good usage of this ingredient.  The patacon is an entr√©e, where a whole flattened plantain is topped with your choice of a meat, and topped with lettuce, peppers, cheese and avocado.  And yes, it's awesome.\\n\\nThe Cuban wrap is basically the pabellon empanada, but with cheese, avocado and sour cream thrown in, and is fantastic.  You can actually add crab cakes to a meal for $4.50 - and you get two ruddy crab cakes!  Shut up and take my money!\\n\\nI only have a couple gripes, and they're minmal.  The empanadas and the bulk of their wraps are only available during lunch time (11am-230pm), and they shut it down from 230pm till 500pm when they re-open for dinner.  There's been several days where I just missed lunch, and ended up downtroddenly dining elsewhere.  And the ceviche, whilst not bad, is the poorest I've had in town thus far.  Not bad, but not up to par with either Cantina Laredo or Bonefish Grill.  \\n\\nConsidering every other item I've ordered and eaten I wouldn't hesitate to revisit, however, that is easily overlooked.

What do you REALLY expect?\\n\\n-Expect to have a hard time with the wait staff if you don't speak Mandarin, Fuzhounese or Cantonese.  Just have patience and do what I do; point to what you need.  \\n\\n-Don't expect it to be like Shabu-Zen.  You would be lost for the first 20 minutes going into the meal.  I was game to check out the place instead of going down the street because I wanted to try something different... and different it was.  Unlike Shabu-zen (and I promise this will be the only time I would do any comparison) Hot Pot Buffet is totally erratic.  There's no garlic, chili peppers, scallions, and bbq sauce to swirl into your soy sauce base.  There's just a jar of soy sauce and a bowl.  You'll have to ask for the hot chili oil and bbq sauce.\\n\\n-Expect to eat in abundant.  They will provide you with a paper menu to check off the things you want.  I desire a tom yum base but no cigars so I settled for the half Mala (spicy) soup and half Chinese herbal soup.  We then ordered the usual squid, scallops, clams, crab leg and fish paste from the seafood section (they now have lobster for an additional $7.95); prime rib eye (as they have no short ribs), beef tongue, tripes from the meat section; then watercress, spinach, bok choy, black mushroom, king oyster mushroom, tong ho, soft tofu and some daikon from the Veggies.\\n\\n-Expect the food to arrive sporadically with no rhymes or reason.  Quality of meat is good and all the veggies were fresh, the seafood was kinda frozen and only ok.  We were huge veggie fans so we went crazy with the greens.\\n\\n-Expect some missing items from your plate since it might get lost in translation.\\n\\nHere are some pointers, make sure you put the clams (they were huge quahogs) and crab legs last as they tend to make the broth REALLY salty.  So salty that we didn't really enjoy as much.\\n\\nNo alcohol yet and you can't bring your own (bummer) so all you got is soda, tea and water..... not to mention the salty broth.\\n\\nNow go and enjoy.

Looking over the menu for the night (which I understand changes regularly), I decided that a locally made brat would go great with my beer. Followed, of course, by a couple of deep fried Oreos.  About 5 minutes later, my food was ready. The brat was delicious, amongst the better ones I've had. The deep fried Oreos were perfect. Many food stands overcook them and they turn to mush. These retained their consistency a lot better.\\n\\nA while later, my wife decided that she was finally hungry enough to try some food, and selected the vegan Italian sausage. To say that she loved it would be an understatement. \\n\\nFor the food and service, four stars. I wouldn't go out of my way to check where he is and head down there, but if he's back out at Redlight any night I'm there, I'd be happy to try some more food.\\n\\nUnfortunately, I did have an issue regarding his professionalism. On one of my trips up to the cart (picking up my first order), he was already engaged in a conversation with some other customers regarding other food trucks in town. The whole group was just complaining about food at other trucks. Bruno, himself, had joined in and saying how the other trucks were rip-offs (in terms of pricing and quality). To be fair, it seemed like the customers had started the line of conversation, but he didn't need to start slinging arrows himself.

The cold, chewy noodles are also really refreshing in the hot months of our Atlanta summers.\\n\\nThe other thing 88TH gets points for is their banchan (the many and varied appetizers that come for free with your meal).  As a first-order approximation, you can tell how decent a Korean restaurant is by their banchan.\\n\\nI've heard that many of the hard-core Koreans don't really come to 88TH anymore because it's been overrun by non-Koreans, which is probably true especially after 88TH got Creative Loafing's best 24-hour restaurant award.

The buying process was very easy and Allan made me feel very comfortable. Five days later I was driving home from work and the engine overheated! I was furious.. at 11k miles this should not be happening. So I called Allan and he told me to call someone named Andre.. I had no idea who he was and had not met him but apparently he was the owner. He said he would pick up the car but would not give me a rental car. I was two hours away and stranded! I had to find a way home and was told it would be the next Tuesday until it was ready so I had to find a car to borrow for 5 days.. At this point I just wanted a new car. I talked to Andre and he told me he could give me the next model up but I had to give him MORE MONEY. Then he went on to tell me that this particular car had been in a fender bender. I'm sorry but I'm not going to take a car that has damage (even though it was repaired) and be willing to give more money. I had told Andre that I wanted a car with no damage and didn't want any issues he texted back saying, \\"Cars are cars. It could have happened to the other one.\\" After this happened I could not get a hold of Andre at all, he would not return my phone calls or text messages and when he responded the next day he just texted me. Things that are important like this should be discussed over the phone rather than texting like we're teenagers. I then decided just to pick up my original car that had been repaired under warranty and go. I repeatedly told Andre that I wanted a copy of the receipt of what was done to the car and where it was repaired at. When I arrived to the dealership, he wasn't even there and the man who was there said that they had lost it so it wasn't available. When I had asked about what made my car over-heat, Allan told me it was the antifreeze, Andre told me it was a fuse then later told me it was the water pump then the man I picked my car up from told me it was the radiator.. I kept getting different answers and was fed up. So I had to call the Chevy dealership and get a report from them. But the dealership said my car was never there to get fixed!! All in all, my experience was awful.. I will never be back. My car has been repaired and I only took it back because it was still under warranty. I wish I would've went somewhere else.\\n\\n6-11-15\\nSo after writing this review, Andre has finally called me back to try to get me to take this down. After days of asking where my car was fixed he finally told me he didn't take it to the dealership where it was under warranty.. He took it somewhere else! His reason was because when he was towing my car, they broke the front bumper of my car. I WAS NEVER INFORMED OF THIS. At this point I was furious! I don't even think Andre would have told me that he damaged my car if I had never wrote this review. I repeatedly asked Andre where my car was taken to get fixed and he said Ron Tonkin Chevrolet. I called them and they said my car was never there. When I asked Andre about that he said that he only got the part there and apologized for lying.

There's a long list of those they have on tab, and then a menu full of bottles. You are not likely to find a larger beer selection (outside of Delirium Tremens in Belgium).\\n\\nOh, and the food is decent too."},{"name":"Sushi Katana","address":"4192 Conroy Rd, Ste 103","city":"Orlando","stars":"4.5","text":"We went for lunch and got a table right away, our server was awesome and attentive but the food was not good. The nigiri fell apart, making it hard to eat, and the rice tasted dry, like day old rice. Fish wasn't that great, but not terrible. Probably won't come here again."},{"name":"Greek Village Restaurant","address":"3577 Lake Emma Rd, Ste 111","city":"Lake Mary","stars":"4.5","text":"My new favorite Restaurant.

Fortunately for them, there is not much competition in their category in Vancouver.  Servers are nice but the front door staff is extremely rude.  One hostess treated us like we couldn't be left to make our own decisions.  Very condescending and ridiculous considering the prices here.  Won't be returning."},{"name":"El Oriental De Cuba","address":"416 Centre St","city":"Jamaica Plain","stars":"4","text":"I've gone only once eventhough I've been meaning to try it for  YEARS! Its too bad I waited so long. The food was delicious...really authentic.\\n\\nIt was a teeny bit pricey..compared to other latino restaurants and given the area and the waitress could've been a little bit more friendly also..I never like places that give you a can of something instead of just refilling your glass...but that's just me.\\n\\nOverall...the cuban sandwich is AMAZING...gotta get that and their rice dishes are really good. Will definately go back to try out other dishes..."},{"name":"Porcinis Italian Restaurant","address":"68 School St","city":"Watertown","stars":"4","text":"We've been going to Porcini's since it opened and this is by far our favorite local restaurant.  They held a wine/food pairing event on Monday and it was fantastic. Their chef is amazing and there are always a few specials which keeps the menu fresh.  The staff here is very attentive and only when it is extremely busy have we found the service a little slow, but not worth worrying about.
