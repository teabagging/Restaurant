Yes!   \\nI consider a lot of factors when reviewing but service weighs in pretty heavy.   This location has, consistently, the best service of all the locations we've visited.  Every time we come here we get amazing service.  Even when we see new faces at the register we still get the same great service.   Everyone seems genuinely happy to be there and they treat the customers with appreciation instead of acting like they are an inconvenience.   It doesn't matter if you ask a hundred questions or know what you want right away, they are always happy to help.  This kind of service is hard to find and especially for a place to be this consistent.  We've met so many nice employees but I have to give a shout out to Matt and Jason (I think) because no matter how busy it gets they always stay calm and pay attention to every customer individually.  This is true for almost everyone we've met there but I'm terrible at remembering to ask for or look for names.  So even before we talk food I'd rate this place pretty high.   \\nMoving to Ohio from Texas we thought we wouldn't find decent barbecue but we like this place.  It depends on what you're used to, but the meats are usually tender and flavorful so you really can't go wrong.  The pulled pork is my least favorite because the first few times I ordered it the meat was a little on the dry side.  Lots of people love it though and try it with the slaw.   The good thing is they are happy to give you a sample if you're on the fence.   The brisket is good, not Texas melt in your mouth good, but definitely higher on the list than anything else we've had in Ohio.  If you prefer bark then just ask, if you prefer lean then ask, if you prefer fatty then...you guessed it, just ask!   They are pretty accommodating here and will still help you with a smile even if you're being high maintenance.   On to the Turkey.  This is hit or miss with me because sometimes it's drier than others and I don't like it that way.  My kids love the turkey though.   It's generally good and doesn't have as much of the smoke flavor as some of the other meats.  Plus it goes well with different sauces so you can change it based on what you feel like that day.  The half chicken, what can I say?   I only got it based on the suggestion of the lady taking our order one time and I was surprised how at good it was.   It had lots of flavor, it was very juicy, and it was a lot more food than I thought.   The chicken would be my favorite if they had a version that came de-boned and I don't mean pulled chicken because that's not the same.  The sausage is pretty good and you can get it on a Texas toast style bun or just sliced if you want.  The ribs, try them on Tuesday for \\"Rib Bone Tuesday.\\"   Go in and get a meal and add a couple at $1.35 per rib to see if you like them.  I get them as addition to my meal but I've had ribs all over the country and I have found that I like them a certain way so I have to be in the mood for it to get them as my main dish.  We also pre ordered five racks to pick up the day before Thanksgiving (they were closed on Thanksgiving) and the guys wrapped the racks for us and told us the best way to heat them.  We followed their instructions and everyone loved them.  The sides are all pretty good too.  My top three everyday sides, in order:   Corn pudding (add jalape√±os), potato salad, and beans.  I don't even like beans but these have a great flavor.   My all time favorites are actually their seasonal sides - gumbo, cukes and onions, and jacked mac n cheese.   If you see one of these on the menu and you're still not sure then ask for a little sample!   I'm telling you, these guys want you to love what you get.   If you have a few people in n a group try a family meal or sampler so you can try a little bit of more than one thing.  My husband would tell you to just get the More Cowbell and call it a day.   Don't forget to try the desserts.  \\nThe place is not huge but it's got plenty of seating and outdoor seating as well.   It's got a couple bigger tables and you can always put tables together if you need to.  \\nSo if you just want a laid back place to enjoy a good meal, you'll always feel welcome here!!!"},{"name":"Lincoln Tavern and Restaurant","address":"425 W Broadway","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"Came here for brunch during Memorial Day weekend, so had a bit of a wait but it was very well worth it!

It had been 6 months or better since we had ordered from them last.\\n\\nLast night we tried 2 new pizzas (for us, not necessarily new to the menu).  We did the Pig & Pesto, the Saucalito, Toscana Cheese Bread, and tried the Bacon Honey Buns.\\n\\nThe Pig & Pesto was by far our favorite pizza of the night.  It was well balanced, and had just the right amount of salt from the meat which paired well with the Pesto.  The Saucalito was strange.  As is, we wouldn't get it again.  Having the honey drizzle was too overwhelming for the pizza, and the heat from the jalape√±o wasn't enough to cut through the sweetness.  All we were able to smell was the honey, and the tastes and the smells didn't add up.  Strange was the best way to describe it.  However, without the honey drizzle, it was a good sausage pizza.  The Toscana bread was as good as we remembered it to be.  Now let's talk about the Bacon Honey Buns.  Guys - what were you thinking!?!  Not good.  It's the wrong kind of Bacon to be adding to it.  It needs to be candied, or be a different kind of Pig or something...the Honey Buns are good...just only after removing the Bacon.\\n\\nOverall, we will be back to order again."},{"name":"Tasty n Alder","address":"580 SW 12th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"The service and food was purely outstanding!!

The third time, I even washed the wings in hot water because I didn't want to have to throw food out again. Little good it did me.

Some members of the party tried some wine and beer, but I just had an orange juice. Surprisingly, it was fresh squeezed and absolutely delicious. \\n\\nSoon after our drinks arrived, we went ahead and placed our orders. I went with the Spanish octopus to start and the hamburger for my entree. \\n\\nAbout 10 minutes after placing our orders, some focaccia bread was dropped off at the table along with some olive oil. The bread was doughy and airy, but well flavored with it being lightly salted and topped with a drop of caramelized onions. \\n\\nSoon after that, our appetizers came. I was a bit shocked at how small the Spanish octopus was, especially at the price of $17. It was only one, medium sized octopus leg. It really wasn't that feeling, but had a nice hint of flavor with the chars outside being complimented by a nice, yellow sauce and a bed of potatoes. \\n\\nI heard the hamburger from the bar at Bar Mezzana was very good according to my local family, so I decided to try it out. It seemed to be served on a store bought bun, which isn't a huge complaint, but they could have at least separated the two halves before putting the actual burger on. I only got my burger with tomato and it was tasty. The burger was crispy on the inside and tender on the inside, but it could have used a touch more of seasoning.\\n\\nFinally, I had the brownie for dessert, which came topped with a scoop of vanilla ice cream and drizzled with dark chocolate nibs. The brownie itself wasn't warm, which I though would have been nice, but it was still fairly tasty. The ice cream on top added a nice touch. \\n\\nThe service here wasn't spectacular, but they did seem to have a lot of tables to deal with. Still, she was very nice. The ambiance here is also nice with a variety of options including comfortable indoor seating, outdoor seating and a sports bar, which was showing the Red Sox vs. Phillies game. \\n\\nAltogether, Bar Mezzana isn't the greatest restaurant in Boston, but it still serves a solid, tasty meal in a nice, modern environment.

They were surprisingly large and I could have left it at that and been satisfied. Great flavor, not too much butter, and the black garlic was a great touch. \\n\\nTo finish things off we ordered the steak and frites. I'm a sucker for fries and these were seasoned with a delicious truffle flavor. The steak was one of the best I've had. Cooked perfectly, extremely tender, and they let the steak speak for itself by not over seasoning the steak.

The standard hot drip coffee is delicious, and I like the flavored syrups you can add when things are getting WILD on a weekend (like iced coffee with mint syrup). As for beer, where to begin? The answer is always with a tasting board, and Lamplighter usually has two to choose from. Keep your eye out for the highly coveted Birds of a Feather, and try their new amazing IPA, Lawyers, Guns, and Honey.

What is salt? What are spices ? What is pasta sauce? What is seasoning ? \\nSomebody needs to answer these questions that were probably going through the chefs head. \\nOr on the off chance, I think I have a rubber for a tongue with no taste buds. \\n\\nThe panini sandwich was another work of art. Chicken, leaves from the tree outside and a lack of taste would best describe this sandwich. The wrap was either grilled or microwaved so hot that the wrap had hardened to the level of an extra crispy pizza crust. \\nAbsolutely great! \\n\\nThe steak tips and the wings weren't bad. So, 1 star each for those two. Wasn't great but after the pasta and the wrap, it was probably the tastiest steak / wings I'd ever had. \\n\\nI'm now going to make myself a bowl of ramen and satisfy my hunger."},{"name":"Food 101","address":"4969 Roswell Rd, Ste 200","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3.5","text":"I really don't get the hype here.

It is really loud and the people who run the trivia sit inconvenient to the bar.

Great that there is no cover, but that is offset by the bud light soaked floor and uncleaned restrooms. \\n\\nBrunch: pretty good food, but is never fully clean from the night before, and can be slow.

It's simply named after the shaking of the wok when you cook it. The rice dish came with a side of salt, pepper, and lime dipping sauce (muoi tieu chanh), which you'd dip the cube-shaped beef in. It was delicious, if not a little salty... This is where if my dad was there, he'd joked \\"They killed a man last night (the salt truck driver).\\" (It's funnier heard in Chinese). The beef sits on top of a bed of lettuce, cucumbers and tomatoes.

Got to the restaurant at 6pm to a pretty good line just to put your name on the list. After waiting in that line, we finally put our name and number down and was told 3 to 3 1/2 hour wait. We wandered the neighborhood for a while until we got cold and then went around the corner to The Thinking Cup for a coffee and a fruit tart to hold us over while we waited. At around 2 hours and 50 mins the call came and we hurried inside. We were sat down at the bar. We ordered:\\n\\nOysters: \\n2 Kumamoto and 2 Chatam - the oysters were super fresh and clean, absolutely no sand, and super tasty. Very reasonably priced for the quality\\n\\nAppetizers:\\nBluefin Crudo - this was probably the best thing I ate all day. The bluefin was incredibly fresh, absolutely perfect slices of tuna. The oil and acid was perfect and the crisp radish gave it a crunch. It was just a tad to salty for me tho. \\n\\nNeptune Johnnycake - apparently this is pretty famous here. Basically a fish pancake. It was also a way bigger portion than I expected. It was crisp on the outside and so so tender inside. The smoked fish and caviar on top gave it a very nice bit of salt with great flavor\\n\\nEntrees:\\nSeared Georgia Bank Scallops - the scallops were huge and incredibly fresh. absolutely no hint of any fishiness. The sear was slightly lacking as it was a bit soggy and I felt the scallops were a bit undercooked. The pea tendrils were sweet and perfectly cooked. The corn gave it a hint of sweetness which was really welcome among all of the salt. The bacon was very salty and rather tough instead of being crispy. \\n\\nStripped Bass - something that wasn't on the menu online or on the door, seemed like they replaced the Swordfish in the exact same dish with Stripped Bass. I also felt the sear on the fish was a bit lacking, the skin was a bit soggy and the middle of the interior was very rare, borderline raw. It was barely barely warm in the middle. The cucumber greek yogurt salad that the bass sat on had great flavor and great crunch with the tomatoes providing some much needed acidity. \\n\\nOverall - REALLY good food but not spectacular. Given the 3 hour wait, I thought it wasn't worth it. A bit overhyped.

It's hard to state how disappointing the staff was, from the hosts to the servers.

The server had been informed multiple times we were here for a birthday party and refused to acknowledge our party for the event. Once seated, only two thirds of our table was asked what they would like for drinks. The other third of the table had to individually chase down our waiter to ask them to also add our drink orders. Shockingly, this again happened for our food order where the waiter again ignored multiple party members and simply never asked them for their food order. Again, we had to individually hunt the waiter down to place orders. Once the orders were placed, the waiter proceeded to only provide half of our orders. After waiting 25 minutes, we politely asked where the rest of our food was before being told that it wasn't in the food queue and they would place it in now. Even worse, 30 minutes later they didn't bring us the food we ordered. Beyond frustrated, we skipped to dessert, where the waiter brought out a little cake with a candle. Afterwards they brought the bill, charging us for the food and drinks we ordered that never arrived in addition to the cake that we were told was complimentary.

However, I got lucky this time around as we came in just a few minutes after opening on a Saturday evening and got seated rather promptly in their upstairs area. \\nTin ceilings and dim lighting. Fancy and kitschy decor adorn the walls. Bistro vibe and cozy. Sitting upstairs was great as you had clear view of the restaurant. With dinner you are served their comp fresh bread with some salted butter...plus, they will not hesitate to ask if you want more. I have always come here for the burger and yes, they have recently changed it up a bit from how it used to be. The burger is topped with a semi-spicy homemade pickle relish, goat cheese, butter lettuce, cooked onions, the works. Plus it comes with some tasty fries on the side. For $12 you really can't go wrong. The burger itself is big but a tad messy. The bottom of it became rather soggy quickly from the burger juices and made it nearly impossible to pick up. I resorted to fork and knife. The other night I also tried the escargot with noodles. It was not a large portion but it was quite tasty. The sauce everything was cooked in was fantastic. So fantastic that we dipped our bread in it. So good. \\nAnother plus is that they serve stumptown coffee and have a great wine list. All in all this place is great.

Hovering over the stars above, I'd like to offer zero stars with the definition \\"Should have done the street food...\\"\\n\\nSo it's 10:00 PM and we finally finished waiting the half hour to be seated.  Sitting at bar-like seats, facing the kitchen, we can see everything being prepared.  I'm not a hipster, but this place seems cool.  I read the menu, oblivious to the horror which is about to occur, and pick the saut√©ed kale salad with pine nuts and the beef kebabs.  The waitress explains that the food might arrive out of order as soon as it's ready.  Bit odd... but whatever, place smells good and I have a drink.  Then our salads arrive.  We both ordered the saut√©ed kale salad, but even if you combined the two plates, you still wouldn't have had enough kale to fill a vegan rabbit or make a single kale smoothie.  I think I could have counted how many pieces of kale were on my plate with a single hand, had it not been for the shaking. (I've included a picture... the pine nuts look like they are laughing at me.  I've also included a photo of what the same amount of money buys you at the grocery store.  The 1L Nalgene bottle is included only for scale.)  Did it taste good?  I think so... but so little sustenance past my taste buds that it's hard to tell what was kale and what was left over in between my teeth from the papaya salad at lunch.  Then the rest of my snack arrives.\\n\\n\\"Where's the rest?\\" is the first thought that goes through my mind... and had I not been dining with such an amazing woman, that thought might have made it out of my mouth.  I'm staring at two small wooden skewers the size of toothpicks, each with a single flattened, oval shaped piece of beef.  These things are so small and thin that they could fit through grill's grate, which I think is where the rest of my meal went.  These things were so small, if you combined the two pieces together you wouldn't even have a meatball.  I couldn't take a picture of the beef kebabs lest I disrespect the poor cows that died in vain... also couldn't find the macro setting on my phone's camera.  Did they taste good?  Sure... was it worth $15? I don't think it was even worth my time chewing.\\n\\nI'm an engineer, a problem solver, if you will... but I can't figure out how this evening ended up the way it did.  Did I just order from the tapas menu?  If that's a main dish, what do the starters look like?  Can you even see it with the naked eye? That's when I noticed the size of the utensil in front of me (picture included).  I panic, and then start to feel guilty; I just ate and drank about $32.  I sponsor two kids on the other side of the world through an awesome organization.  I can feed each of these kids for a month with $38.  I just ate almost half a month's worth of a kid's food in three bites and I'm still starving.\\n\\nThat's when my beautiful, thoughtful, caring companion put her arm around me, like a mother goose protecting her young, and spoke such beautiful words into my ear: \\"Are you going to still be hungry after this?\\"  \\"Yes\\", I managed to reply through the uncontrollable sobbing.  \\"I thought I would have to live with that secret till morning.\\" \\"Would you like to stop at the street food stand on the way back?\\" \\"Does a bear **** in the woods?!\\" I thought to myself.  But then I realized, a bear wouldn't have had to do any business after eating this meal.  I opted to simply nod, then buried my head into her shoulder.  Everyone was starring; a few other dudes near me started to break down as well.  It was a honest moment for a handful of us; there was much healing and revelation that evening.  She even picked up the check... I owe her so much.\\n\\nThank the good Lord above for forgiveness, an amazing woman, and the Shawarma street food stand down the block, which was still open at 11 PM.  Only $7, eight minutes, and a smile and my life was mostly back on track, though the guilt will likely persist.  The food stand even had pictures on the menu to convince me I wasn't getting ripped off.  (I've included that picture as well... try combo #16.)

And of course they ordered roughly the same time as us...so they were not going to leave any time soon. If the food wasn't overwhelming pretentious,  this table's conversation made up for their lack there of. Their conversation fluctuated between crude and sickeningly ostentatious as they debated whether to spend next week in a Manhattan penthouse or to 'summer at the Hamptons on their yacht' (do people really talk like that??!). It was hard to enjoy ourselves when all my husband and I could hear was them over everything. \\n\\nWe were hoping the food would make up for the destroyed ambiance...but sadly most of it did not. The three stars was given for a delicious French onion soup, a decent steak au piovre, and a heavenly creme brulee as well as grand marnier souffle. Skip the caramel- it is WAY too sweet and hard to spread the sauce. The grand marnier was light and scrumptious- the way dessert should be! I was underwhelmed by their signature dish, the poulet au vin. The brown sauce was uninspired. Didnt really taste like anything at all. Just flavorless gravy with chicken. My husbands steak was much tastier...though the tomatoes on top were kind of weird. The presentation of the main courses did not wow me at all. Very sub par presentation wise. The souffles on the other hand did look really nice. Though I wouldn't get the gruyere app souffle again. Looked nice, but tasted just okay. Had a burnt tinge to it. \\n\\nAgain, the highlights: nice server, french onion soup, creme brule, and grand marnier souffle. Their candle in a thimble full of whip cream at the end of the night almost made me laugh.  I guess it's better than not wishing us happy anniversary at all...but come on.

You guys probably already know, I can't get enough of them. I had already checked out Sublime Doughnuts during my time in Atlanta, but, I'm not going to just stop at one shop. I was off to check out Revolution Doughnuts. Here, they're hand making all their doughs, glazes and fillings from scratch, using real food ingredients like organic flour, local dairy, fresh fruit, natural flavor extracts, and 100% trans-fat free vegetable oil. So, there's a lot of care involved. These guys carry a bunch of accolades for their doughnuts, so, I had to try a bunch. You know, research.\\n\\nNow, common for popular doughnut shops, they're bound to run out of certain flavors throughout the day. After I wiped my tears and picked myself off the floor, I organized a pretty decent order. In no particular order, I first had the Vanilla Bean (yeast). The simplest of the bunch, it still packed some lovely flavor. The yeast dough is light with a bit of chew, and really nice. The glaze here was almost a super vanilla (I think it had a cape on), really packing in natural vanilla bean flavor, noting the tiny little bean specks.\\n\\nNext up was the Raspberry Sprinkle (yeast). Now, contrary to this one looking like a generic Homer Simpson doughnut, I was pleasantly surprised at how much I enjoyed this one, all due to the delicious, natural flavor of the raspberry. You get the sophistication of a real raspberry fruit glaze, with the fun and whimsy from the sprinkles. Perfect for the kid at heart.\\n\\nThen, I had the Orange Pistachio (yeast). I'm not a huge citrus dessert person, but it looked so pretty I had to try it. And, I'm really glad I did. There's a zing from the orange citrus, balanced with the nuttiness of the pistachios, and the crunch mixed with the soft dough is just delightful. \\n\\nNext up was the Cinnamon Apple Fritter (yeast). Man, I love a fritter. Maybe because it's just fun to say, but, then again, it's also probably because they're really delicious. Here, you get a light and delicate apple flavor, with a crisp outside and soft inside. No complaints here. \\n\\nAfter that I tried the True Blueberry (yeast). Again, same great yeast doughnut base, but I really enjoyed the real, natural flavor of the blueberry, which you can absolutely taste. \\n\\nFinally, and maybe one of my favorites, was the Shredded Coconut (baked cake). This was the only cake doughnut they had on tap at the time, so, I knew I had to scoop it up. The doughnut is a dense cake, and it's super moist (awful word) and delicious. The coconut glaze is perfect, and the added texture of the shavings just kicks it up a notch."},{"name":"Baba's","address":"2515 Summit St","city":"Columbus","stars":"4.5","text":"This is the real deal, folks. \\nFresh authentic food prepared by folks who give a damn \\nIf I lived in Columbus I'd eat here all the time."},{"name":"Kekes Breakfast Cafe","address":"1005 Spring Villas Point","city":"Winter Springs","stars":"3.5","text":"This was my second time at this location and I will say that I much prefer it to the one in Waterford as it was not nearly as packed.

MAJOR disappointment.  Sat down, server came to the table fairly quickly.  We ordered our drinks and onion rings to start.  Drinks came quick - good sign.  But then the w-a-i-t-i-n-g began.  After about 15 minutes (seriously) we asked the server where the onion rings were.  His response was \\"I don't know what's going on in that kitchen\\".  Well neither did we.  But we were REAL close to throwing 10 bucks on the table and leaving, but the onion rings suddenly appeared.  And 5 minutes later, so did our lunch.  Excellent timing.  Then the w-a-i-t for the french fries we ordered began.  They never came before we were done with our lunch, so we asked the server to remove the charge, to which he replied he'd 'send the manager over'.  To remove a charge for an item we never received???  The manager comes over and we tell him we just don't want to be charged for the french fries and, while he was there, we tried to tell him about the rest of the lunch experience, but he had already decided it was all about the french fries and agreed to refund the charge for them.  That was it.  And, that was it for us too.  Tibby's is one of those places we can say 2 things about - we tried it, and we won't be back.

The original PONKO sauce is a soy sauce based seasoning with mild sweetness and probably the best sauce on the menu. The price is reasonable with 10 dollars a box of chicken and 2 sides. I tried the seasonal side of green beans which wasn't bad but I don't think warranted a 2 dollar surcharge. It definitely wasn't worth it when I realized I had waited 25 minutes for the green beans to come out. The ambiance was bustling and noisy but that may have been due to the ongoing trivia night. The service was ok and the staff quickly corrected me when I tried to bring the trays back up to the counter.  Overall this is a place I would recommend for anyone craving chicken tenders. The chicken tenders themselves are plain but with the sauce, you have yourself a meal."},{"name":"Columbus Museum of Art","address":"480 E Broad St","city":"Columbus","stars":"4","text":"Very enjoyable place.

It was seasoned & cooked perfectly, basically melted in my mouth. I didn't have to wrap anything but was definitely stuffed. Hubby took home half of his strip. \\n\\nThe ambiance is romantic.

The story of her Southern roots and learning recipes from her grandmother is heart-warming and seems authentic.  But at the end of the meal I felt like that of the $50 per person (incl tip) that we paid, that we had paid $35 of that for the feel-good story and the food was worth $15.\\n\\nLet's start with the seating.  It's communal, which in and of itself isn't a huge deal, but when you combine it with serving the food in communal style with one large dish per table that everyone shares, it leads to a bunch of uncomfortable haggling about portions that I shouldn't have to worry about for $50 per person. \\n\\nAt our table, there were groups of 3 (us), 2, and 1.  So as the dishes come out, we get the one dish holding whatever it is, and here's what our first chore is:  Try and calculate what one sixth of a portion is.  Take too little, and who knows if there will be any left after the rest of the table is finished.  Take too much, and you look like the hoarding jerk to everyone else.  This would not be a big deal if there were large enough portions that you didn't have to worry about getting shorted.  But the portions weren't that big, and let's just say that not everyone at our table was capable of dividing a bowl of salad by six.\\n\\nAt a church picnic, I wouldn't care.  But when you're paying high-end prices, you shouldn't have to worry about having mid-meal negotiations with others at your table over who gets the extra biscuit or who already had a third spoon of greens.  It's absurd and it detracts from the meal when you have to play this game of give and take and social bargaining with strangers just to get what you paid a lot of money for.  And yes, I get that the communal meal is part of the gimmick, but the way it's executed for the price you pay really leaves a lot to be desired.  \\n\\nAnother example, at the end of the meal they brought out tin foil so people could wrap up any extra pieces of chicken to take home, and the solo girl at our table just went ahead and wrapped up all three remaining pieces for herself and walked out.  Didn't bother asking anyone else and quite clearly didn't care.  The couple and us just kinda looked on in astonishment and didn't even bother saying anything because the whole thing was a farce and it wasn't worth the effort to have to have a confrontation about leftovers.  And as you'll hear later, the chicken really wasn't good enough to care.\\n\\nTo be fair, I would have been able to overlook the communal table issues if the food were in fact as amazing as some of the reviews have made it out to be.  But the food as a whole was just average and didn't come close to justifying $50/head.\\n\\nFirst out was the sweet tea, which was good.  It had a fruity flavor to it, and it was extremely sweet.  A pitcher full of ice didn't even really water it down enough.  Then the first food course was the biscuits served with pimento cheese and a couple different types of pickles.  The biscuits were fine and the pimento cheese was good, but nothing out of the ordinary.  Basically what you'd expect at Cracker Barrell.  Again, the portions of cheese and pickles were miniscule, so we spent our time going back and forth with everyone at the table to try and make sure everyone got their one spoonful of pimento cheese to spread and half a pickle.\\n\\nNext was the iceberg salad with a buttermilk ranch dressing, and it was underwhelming.  It looked and tasted like something you would get at a high school potluck and probably cost about 50 cents per person in ingredients.  Following that were the collared greens and a lima beans with rice dish.  Again, both were fine and average, but nothing more than that.  Again, the portions were also small.\\n\\nThe main course was the fried chicken, which she referred to as her \\"dipped chicken.\\"  It had an orangish tint to the sauce which was sweet and spicy.  Keeping in form with the rest of the meal, it wasn't great.  I suppose I was most disappointed with this, because I'd read so much about what an amazing experience her 3-fat fried chicken was, and I really have to question who was doing all the raving.  It wasn't distinctive at all except for maybe the color.  The skin was crispy...probably a bit too much.  And it didn't make much of an impression at all.  Last was the banana pudding, which was good, but also not exceptional.\\n\\nI really wanted to like this place.  I've eaten numerous meals cooked by different grandmas of friends in the South, and there is some incredible cuisine from that region and culture.  But I felt like this whole experience was something manufactured by bloggers and journalists to sell a personality rather than great food.

There aren't too many places that serve them so our main objective in coming here was trying them. It's a pretty cool dish but something I probably wouldn't order again. They are sweeter than your usual pancakes but they're light and fluffy. Some of ours were undercooked - for the most part they look cute and well done on the exterior but one of ours split open before we even cut into it and you could see the underdone interior (see attached photo). I like that they provided syrup, butter, AND condensed milk though! I definitely recommend sharing if you decide to get the souffle pancakes because you'll eventually get tired of eating the same thing over and over again.\\n\\nThe Traditional Benedict was pretty basic but not bad. We also got the Bootleg Mussel Bowl which was an interesting thing to have on the brunch menu but ok! I'm all for it. It was super flavorful and extremely garlicky with a kick. It also came with a side of pretty solid fries. Unfortunately my breath was kickin' for the rest of the day from the ridiculous amount of garlic, haha.

The wait time is to be expected. 2.5 hours for us, even coming in at 2 PM on a Friday.

We never felt rushed with each dish, and they came just at the right times. \\n\\nFOOD: \\n* Oysters (duh) ($2-4 each): I loved how they had a printed sheet of available oysters with their described taste next to them - having it written was so helpful rather than having to remember what the waitstaff says when asking for recs. We tried 3 different types, all being delicious and juicy. Depends on what kind you like\\n* Clam Chowder ($13): Like other reviews have mentioned, their clam chowder has a thinner consistency. It was very interesting, as I had only had thick chowder. Needless to say, the flavor was entirely there - nothing like feeling it was watered down. It was just more of a soup rather than a stew. \\n* Johnnycake ($18): This might've been my favorite dish. I've never had Johnnycakes before, and this probably set the bar way high. The honey drizzle was the right amount of sweet to complement the naturally plain in flavor taste of cornmeal. I would've never thought in a million years to pair smoked tuna and caviar with something that is similar to to pancakes, but every bite was a party in my mouth. I loved the sweet and the salty balance. \\n* Lobster roll (MP - $35): This was the first time I've had a hot lobster roll, and the most expensive. Dang, $35! Was really expecting something a bit more fabulous and more flavor. The lobster was fresh, yes, and generous portions, but it was lacking in flavor :/  Maybe the cold one would've done the trick... \\n* Cioppino ($32): This was good! I enjoyed the saffron rice and the array of shellfish / fish, but I wasn't blown away. The flavor was good, but nothing I walked away thinking I wouldn't be able to get somewhere else.\\n\\nOverall, for our first full meal in Boston, it was definitely a great experience.

First, the war.\\n\\nThe war is significant because we took quite a drumming in the jungles of Vietnam.  The National Liberation Front used the jungles to play mind games with our boys.  They gave us so much trouble that Navy SEALs had to be invented just to match the guerrilla warfare of the indigenous fighters.  I wouldn't be surprised if I found out that the Liberation fighters were fueled by pho.  And that is the second thing I think about when I think of Vietnam: Pho.\\n\\nPho is perfect in almost every regard.  It's a soup but it's substantial.  It's appropriate for any type of weather.  It's flavorful and it can be as spicy or as mild as you wish.  It's healthy.  The ingredients are almost always fresh.  It's the only food I know of that can improve the state of a hangover.  And finally, like a guerrilla, it's badass.  The greens and sprouts are chock full of nutrition.  And there are strips of intestine, tendon, and flank ripped off various parts of an ill-fated cow liberally thrown in.\\n\\nThe beef is rare and the tripe has so much character it looks like the calcium carbonate wall of coral.  And the tendon.  Do you know what a tendon is?  It's one of the toughest tissues in the body.  It's packed with collagen fibers and gives us our ability to absorb impact.  It's a bright white tissue that is so hard it's almost like bone, except it softens when you cook it, leaving behind a perfectly chewy piece of meat that adds a gelatinous consistency to the pho.  This comes from the cooked collagen fibers that literally turn into gelatin when cooked slowly.  \\n\\nPho Pasteur does all this so well, I couldn't possibly do them justice in a mere Yelp review.  I just know that when I get a mouthful of slightly rubbery tripe, chewy tendon, and still-mooing beef, it's like throwing off my Clark Kent outfit and putting on a pair of tight red underpants and cape.\\n\\nThe more I think about it, the more I realize that pho is a tribute to the country and its tough citizens, possibly even the Liberation Front.  Its lush multitude of greens bring the jungle to your table.  And the meat are the soldiers and natives of the jungles: Many strips of meat in their prime, tendons, and plenty of guts.  Some of them you see right in front of you and others reveal themselves the deeper you go.  It's history in a bowl.\\n\\nBecause I have an appreciation for the culture and history of the country and its tough citizens, I can excuse how aggressive the staff is.  I can't call them rude because they're not being rude.  They're just tough as nails.  It would be like taking offense at a lioness wanting to eat you.

This is a family run restaurant and they seem to know most of the diners.  However, what was gained in familiarity was lost in professionalism.  Our server was poorly trained and unable to answer any questions on the menu. Service was awkward and badly timed.  The focus was on turning the table rather than on service.

All that being said, the food is delicious.  The Avgolemono $3.95 bowl is worth the trip alone.  Desserts are fresh and made in house.  The Sesame Cookies 2/$1.50 with a cup of their strong coffee is the perfect end to a meal.  If this restaurant was in another location (it's on the Access Road at the Norwood Airport) and was professionally managed you'd never be able to get a table (and this would be a 5star review) My advise is forgive the unprofessional operations and enjoy a great meal."},{"name":"Tasty n Alder","address":"580 SW 12th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"First meal of my Portland excursion and I was not disappointed!

After , I decided to check out this cool hot dog place that was nearby based upon other recent reviews.  First off, I had no idea this cool shopping strip existed just past Pappasito's on Windy Hill.  It's like the UN decided to have some of its members provide culinary options to us Southern folk.  There's a pizzeria, Thai place, Sushi, Chinese, Mexican, **cough,coughSUBWAYcough,cough** and then Barker's Red Hots providing America's hot dog extraordinaire\\n\\nWhen you walk into Barker's, it feels like you've set foot on a beach.  Well, not quite, but that's the atmosphere their aesthetic specialist was probably going for.  And who doesn't love a cook-out style meal on the beach? Bright blues and cool greens are splashed everywhere and even the counter where they cook and cash out your order is painted like crystal-blue waves.\\n\\nThe highlight of Barkers is their indoor charcoal grill.  As a sign warns you upon entering the line, food is cooked to order so please be patient as it's worth the wait.  Well, I'm not so sure it was.\\n\\nI ordered the Original Cheese Dog with the option of melted cheese versus shredded and topped with jalapenos.  The dog, while it had a wonderful BBQ look and feel after cooking on the grill, was missing something that I couldn't quite put my finger on.  Maybe it needed BBQ sauce.  Maybe the stadium-style cheese sauce didn't do it for me.  Maybe it was the soggy jalapeno slices (yes, they were soggy!).  The dog itself was really juicy and expertly cooked, so I know there's some potential there with the right toppings.\\n\\nI also ordered the picnic-style baked beans and without a doubt, those were EXCELLENT.  They came cold, and I had never eaten cold baked beans, but I ate the entire serving and was salivating for more.  \\n\\nSo the dog didn't quite do it for me, but the beans did lol.  I'm still confident that I can find a winning combination that'll make me swoon.  They also had all-beef dogs, Italian sausages and Polish sausages that looked good.  The prices are pretty decent and they also have a nice sized patio with tables and chairs to eat at during awesome weather.  Oh, if you bring the kiddies, they have giant-sized lollipops that are sure to please.\\n\\nFor now, Mr. Barker, you get 3 stars, but I'll definitely be back for a second opinion!"},{"name":"Today Cafe","address":"6300 Universal Blvd","city":"Orlando","stars":"3.5","text":"This was the old location of the Beverly Hills Boulangerie at the entrance of Universal Studios.

I did ask for it to be fixed and the manager Maggie was amazing to correct it.  On top of the avocado spread was fresh tomatoes, roasted red onions, marinated artichoke and tomato aioli. I felt the avocado spread could be thicker and needed more artichoke slices than the one small piece on the toast...check out the picture.

I'm a huge fan of this seafood stew and whenever I see it in the menu it's usually my go to dish. This was the best one I've ever had, period. The sauce is deliciously rich, an abundance of perfectly cooked seafood and crispy bread to sop it all up. What makes this one unique and so special is the rice they add to the bottom. It was such a pleasant surprise to dig your spoon in and have fluffy rice that absorbed the soup so beautifully.

We all enjoyed the clam roll on the toasted bun (they even have gluten free). The size of the meal was just right to me, helping you so you don't feel as though you were over eating as the food is rich. If it feels light to you, you can make it a jumbo sandwich. They have a selection of sodas, waters etc but I don't think they offer alcohol. They also offer other food than rolls like lobster tail or lobster Mac and cheese.

Not an exaggeration at all as EVERY SINGLE TIME we needed service we had to flag down a server. We arrived at 1:45pm so it was towards the tail end of lunch. We were going to be relatively quick and easy because we had a plane to catch so we were ready to order right away. \\n\\nSitting there waiting for our server they flipped the specials board around so I'd say it was probably between 10-5 minutes to 2pm. Finally got the servers attention. Placed our order and of course she said lunch specials are over at 2pm. Fortunately she was willing to check with the kitchen if they could still make it. THAT said... after she walked into the kitchen to check, mind you we hadn't finished placing our order, she walked out of the kitchen to another table to take their drink order. I had to flag her down to ask what the answer was \\"oh ya they said they'll do it. What else would you like\\". I could see into the kitchen from my seat, and while waiting for our order I could see the hipster cooks grab and run their beards multiple times without stopping to wash their hands. It took all of my being to not just leave, but I settled since I had a flight to catch and was starving. \\n\\nThat's the brief summary, the rest of the meal: refills, a bottle of ketchup that had ketchup in it, napkins, THE CHECK, all required flagging someone down. That includes when she sat down at a table a few steps away and started a conversation with a few guys that were clearly her friends. \\n\\nI did attempt to speak to a manager just to give her the feedback, but both times I walked over, she took calls and didn't look up at me at all even showing she could clearly see me standing there waiting and I mean literally she could see me and didn't give a polite: \\"be right with you\\". \\n\\nAnyway, good luck.

The reason has less to do with the quality of the food than the service and hospitality.  The food is good, not great, but good.  Some of it is outrageously overpriced.  If you are going there for more than a salad or an appetizer or some small pasta dish, bring tons of cash and a credit card with a lot of room.  \\n\\nNo, the reason we will not go back is due to the absolute perfunctory service.  We've had better in the past but this last time was abysmal.  I order a cocktail and my wife wanted wine so I said to the waiter that I'd like to view the wine list to see what I wanted.  That must have been code for \\"go away and don't come back for 15 minutes or more\\" because I had to run hand-signals to get the waiter back so my wife didn't have to sit there watch me finish the last drops of my Manhattan while she sat there hankering for that glass of wine that should have been ordered and delivered eons ago.  Why wait-persons don't have the sense to pick up on the fact that people like to enjoy a cocktail and a drink before dinner is beyond me.  \\n\\nTherefore, I call it perfunctory service.  There was NO and I mean NO focus on the customer.  All this time the waiter was in the corner by the desk have a nice long chit-chat with his co-worker.  A lovely strategy for losing customers.\\n\\nSo, Scampo, I hope you're reading this because with some of your wait-staff you need to crack the whip or send them on their merry way to a chain restaurant where this kind of service might be normally acceptable.  When I am paying the prices that Scampo is charging, I expect more and I deserve more.  Great service would even have made up for average food.

I get wanting to do heavy, beefy burgers, but smash them down a bit... it was impossible to bite this burger due to how thick it was. It makes it look great for a pic, but in practice, it is too hard to eat, and it's too much meat, the meat to topping ratio is off. I get the theory that by making them thick and not smashing them, they can cook more at a time on a small griddle, however if they smashed them down a bit, they would cook much quicker, and you would be able to get the temperatures easier (my medium rare was actually more medium well).\\n\\nOverall, the hype is more than the meal.

All the usual suspects are there - the new, the cool, the trendy, the awesome....every Buckhead restaurant.   But we were not feeling it.  We just asked a lady in Bloomingdales - what's your favorite place?   She said - La Grotta.  Huh?  Never heard of it.   But true to our spirit - we said - OK - we are in.  Made a quick reservation and then headed south....Away from trendy Buckhead, toward real Buckhead....as we drove, I am looking around - are there even restaurants here?    And yelp had me turn into a condo.   Huh?   - but keeping the faith, we saw the valet.  Yup - in the basement of a residence.   We walked in, following the magic trail....shhhhh - residences here....the signs admonished.   We got on the elevator down - and you have to get the right door - Matrix style.   And then you are in this old, brick hallway....where are we?   This is a leap from the new, the trendy....but we are keeping our faith.\\n\\nWe heard a loud room - people enjoying themselves.  We were greeted so kindly.   Waited a bit in the \\"lounge' - which is the hallway.   There is a bar with a few seats - it's not a bar like you expect -but a working bar.   The hostess means business - you cant' go back there - it's cramped and the hardest working bartender I have ever seen is just hustling.   Nice, kind, but efficient.   We finally got ushered to an open seat.   Had a drink and were seated.\\n\\nIt's a throwback room - from the 80s.   Like all great places - they focus on food and service.  THe room is fine - recessed lighting, cramped, you are on top of each other, but it's OK .  The crowd?  Regulars.  It has to be - they don't advertise, or get a lot of press.   It's folks who live in the rarified air around here....they come here a few days a week.  Some interlopers like us, but we felt welcome.   \\n\\nOur servers - Antonio and Tex were all stars.  They kept it moving. They were expert, funny, kind and knew their stuff.   \\n\\nThe food - ever find an Italian place - like a really well kept secret in NYC where the people there have the inside scoop....it's that place.  The chef has been there forever.  The menu is complete, and you can do a lovely Italian dinner easily.  We start with Burrata - it was good, not great - needed a little more Burrata and a little less ham - but it was competent and tasty.  The tomatoes need to be heirloom.\\n\\nThe pasta - we chose gnocchi was - perfect. - just perfect.   Clouds/Pillows of homemade pasta.   Mellow homemade sauce.   The chef is letting the ingredients and his expertise mix.  It's not ego driven - it's food driven\\n\\nveal picatta and Dover sole came next - both were knockouts.  The veal - soft, flavorful. Just enough lemon/caper sauce.   The Sole - it smelled like heaven.   It's not over complicated - the fish speaks for itself and it was a nice sized piece.   \\n\\nAny downsides?  I don't know - it's preference at this point.  It's a pretty complete wine list - but they could do better on the by the glass selection.  The Pinot can easily be better.  Cab was OK.   \\n\\nIt's loud -again - not in a bad way -but if you have someone in the room with a really loud voice - and there was - then it just pierces....but it's like being at family's house where a good time is being had - there is always someone loud.   \\n\\nIn the end, we found a gem - we would have NEVER found it.   It goes to show - it's easy to stick with Atlanta's top 30 - and you cant' go wrong -but those hidden secrets are out there.

I'm not waiting in line with the peasants.\\" I go back to watching football at Lustre Pearl and I type in the name of the business on google and it pops up with the 94 Rainey St address (the location at LP) with a phone number so I call it and place order with the gentleman.   I walk up to the trailer about 45 minutes later to pick up my call in order and dipshit 1 says \\"what order?\\"  I respond with. \\"The order for Tony that I called it in 45 minutes ago.\\"  They say they dont have a phone or do phone orders. I say \\"okay, fine, I will call and cancel my other order and order from you\\". That's when Dipshit 2 and 3 pipe up saying, \\" You're going to put in an order not pick it up? That's messed up man it's real messed up. people who do that are shitty.\\" I said \\"that's not my fault google fucked up.

Everything was fantastic, but the scallop was incredible - probably the best thing I ate all weekend, and maybe the best scallop I've ever had.

They put a good amount on the fries, which I love!! \\nThe fries were cooked good, not alot of fries tho, but they were good.....ahem. \\nCheese, pretty good....could've used more....but not unhappy about it...\\nThe chili.......well, meaty...yes, flavorful, sure.....BUT....dry as a tortoises skin.....I mean, the chili basically crumbled away...like you know, when mud dries and then you go to grab some...and it just..crumbles in your hand.....yup, thats how this was.....I don't know...never seen chili do that..unless it was several days old in a bowl that got left out....(Not that I would have done such a thing now....)\\n\\nThe burger...Pretty decent burger....great bun, thick burger(I had to season tho), enough heat to warrant the name of the burger..very happy with that...Overall, I would buy again....but does it deserve the price(7.24)....hmmmm...not sure....5.25...yea, but 7.24 without fries(yes, I know I got chili cheese fries, but still, wouldn't have had to if burger came with fries like most \\"gourmet\\" burger places do).....was this burger the best in town....no...it was in the upper middle of the pack...Mighty Fine holds the Best In Town Burger award for small chain/mom n pop places....\\n\\nAlso go a strawberry shake...Took my first sip from the HUGE straw they give you......great taste, and what is this...strawberry chunks making their way up the straw!..Loved that! Overall, pretty darn good shake, again...the best...no..and again...upper middle of the pack....not a thick shake and because of this, it melted down a good amount on its trip to my place....the cup(a clear plastic one) is partially to blame for this to....seems these type can never keep a shake/smoothie cool enough.....Shakes should go in Styrofoam cups.........I'd order again, but only in late fall/winter times....\\n\\n\\nSo, overall..pretty good burger, chili cheese fries(taste wise) and shake......even tho only giving a 3 star(add some moisture to the chili) I would say this place is FAT MAN APPROVED!! Needs some \\"tweeking\\" here n there, but they made this fluffy guy FULL and overall happy....."},{"name":"Mix'D UP Burgers","address":"313 Blvd SE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"I ordered the lamb burger. All the ingredients were amazing! I was pleasantly surprised to have yogurt on it as a condiment.

You order at the counter and they hand you a number so that they can find you when your meal is ready. I would say that their menu takes a bit to read as there's ton going on with the fonts, colors, boxes, etc. We couldn't find a table big enough to fit all of us, but luckily there was plenty of outdoor seating and the weather was nice. On each table were tiny succulents plants and chopsticks. The restaurant has a bar which I thought was neat. There's a window opening to the bar from the outdoor patio area.\\n\\nFOOD:\\n- SIGNATURE ($10): five chicken tenders with your choice of two sides and two sauces for your tenders. I opted for three tenders to be tossed in spicy sauce and the last two original sauce. The sides I chose were white rice and a garden salad with walnut cilantro dressing. The chicken was good and not dry. The ponko and spicy sauce on the tenders were somewhat too sweet for my liking. My friends were saying the salads are very fresh which makes it very easy to enjoy the salad. I love that they top it with wonton crisps which adds to the texture. The walnut cilantro dressing is so good -- I wish they sold the dressing in bottles. I tried some of my friends potato salad and I thought it was good even though I'm not usually a fan of potato salad. Keep in mind that this is a Japanese style of potato salad. I love the way they make the rice -- kind of mushy and sticky texture like they added a lot more water. The rice cake topped with slices of cucumbers and drizzled with ponko sauce. The ranch was very watered down so I mixed it with the ponko sauce for dipping.\\n\\nStaff is nice and checks on our group very often. One even offered to take a group picture of us. When the servers bring your meal by, they do offer to bring us additional condiments like ranch or ponko sauce. \\n\\nOverall, I would return again as it's in a very convenient location and the food is good.

Being fairly busy, my buddy and I were seated promptly, given menus, glasses of water, and a pot of tea all in one swift movement. After about five minutes of looking over the menu, the waiter, who barely knew any English, looked at us that asked \\"Are you ready to order\\" basically. We both sided with a large Pho Tai. I figured I'd try the staple pho dish at a Vietnamese restaurant I've never been to before to judge how good the broth and quality of the beef is. Within another five minutes, no joke, our food was on the table. Quality service indeed and to be quite honest, the pho was actually pretty solid for the non-existent amount of time we waited for it.

There is no street parking. Instead, there is a small lot on the left just as you turn down New York Avenue. From there it is a quick 1-2 minute walk to the restaurant entrance. \\n\\nWhile reservations used to be a confusing and difficult process, Scratch has simplified the process allowing you to call directly (407-622-2422) e-mail (byrdscratch@gmail.com) or text (407-493-4817). Reservations are taken during their opening hours, and I found the text response to be quick and easy. \\n\\nThe decor is an interesting mix of vintage and hipster with random knick knacks throughout the room. As others have mentioned, the interior is very small with a limited amount of tables that are squeezed next to each other. If your looking for an intimate experience with your significant other, its not going to happen at Scratch. When you can make out conversation over the music, its likely going to be from the strangers seated right next to you. \\n\\nService has been mixed on my visits. Most recently we were assigned two college aged servers - one who was on his first shift for the restaurant, had never tried any of the dishes and had nothing to offer in the way of suggestions, and the other, a young woman who similarly had difficulty explaining the dishes beyond the french fries. While others have described enthusiastic servers, neither of ours had any understanding as to what was being offered that night. No dish was explained, and we had to request advice on how to approach those that were not obvious. Forgetting the lack of knowledge regarding the menu, service was fine during our time at the restaurant. \\n\\nThe tapas menu changes often, and always seems to have some interesting offerings. While the dishes being offered have always been good, the prices charged simply do not commensurate with what is being delivered. These are true tapas (tiny) dishes. We enjoyed the pumpkin gnocchi, but at $12.00-$14.00 (we forgot to take a photo of the menu), I would expect more than six pieces of gnocchi. The chicken piccata ($15.00) was offered with a few pieces of spinach glazed in balsamic, but was equally minuscule in size and offered nothing mind-blowing to justify the elevated pricing. We have also enjoyed the chicken liver p√¢t√© ($10.00), however, be sure to request additional toast ($2.00), and specifically, request that it does not come out entirely burnt like ours did. Otherwise favorites have included the pork belly ($14.00) and duck ($12.00). These are very very small dishes . . .  if you are not planning on grabbing an additional meal that night, expect to easily order 4-7 dishes for two people to remotely feel satisfied. \\n\\nScratch does have a small offering of overpriced mediocre white and red wines, though the whites were out the night we visited. Our servers had again had no knowledge of the wines being offered. They also have a small selection of craft beers on draft, which were, similar to the white wine offerings, all out on the Friday night we visited. They did offer several very very overpriced bottles of craft beer ($12.00 for Houblon Chouffe IPA!). \\n\\nAfter ordering three dishes (recommended amount by our server), a wine, and a Houblon Chouffe IPA, our bill was around $75.00. Though the food was good, it was certainly not worth the pricing we were charged, especially given the shortcomings of the staff. After spending so much on so little, the last thing I was expecting after spending so much on three dishes was to go home hungry."},{"name":"Lion's Tail","address":"354 Harrison Ave","city":"Boston","stars":"4.5","text":"Went there with some friends for dinner and drinks.

I then got an email on the 3rd from the PR company saying it was set, and I was good to go! \\n\\nI followed up with the person 3 times after, and they kept reassuring me I they would email me the codes! They never did! So I called them on a Friday the following week after scheduling my reservation, and they had no idea of my reservation what so ever ! So I had to leave my current event to reschedule last minute with them again, and Then they ask for my credit card for up to a $960 reservation fee on the eve of the event! This would of been just fine to know a week ago, but a bit unprofessional to expect this late in the game. \\n\\nAll they could say is that this is how their business is which is scary if this is considered the average way to treat a customer. As an everyday customer this is never acceptable! Especially since they never answer their phone, email, or messages the first 5 times I tried. They told me different people check the emails, and a lot times skip nights in checking it. Which is why they don't all know of who is scheduled.\\n\\nOn the eve of an event that I've been planning for two weeks I was left trying to reschedule my night during an event I was at, or left no choice to spend $960! \\n\\nLuckily, one of my favorite bars (Bar Margot at the Four Seasons Hotel) and a far superior speakeasy aka Red Phone Booth within seconds was able to schedule us in ! They didn't care whether we were bloggers or not, and answered their phone on the first ring on a busy Friday ! \\n\\nSave your money, time, dignity and just go to Red Phone Booth, Bar Margot or hell any where else !"},{"name":"Magnolia Cafe South","address":"1920 S Congress Ave","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"Having been to this place before,  I decided to take my parents to this place for dinner because they wanted to try something different.

The fries were homemade and very fresh, although the 'gravy' was more of a soup and made everything soggy pretty quickly.  It was delicious, don't get me wrong, but it wasn't the type of poutine I was expecting.  We also ordered the bruschetta tartine and the forager pizza (roasted onion sauce with mushrooms and broccoli rabe).

Just stay put, roll your eyes at them and pantomime for them to get up and walk outside like they were told by the staff LOL\\n\\nThe service was top notch and as mentioned our server was just the right combination of chatty, efficient and capable.

I realized it was lunchtime, not due to the clock, but due to my stomach growling (sometimes I'm a creature of habit, and sometimes I'm like a toddler that needs to eat every two hours), so I decided to try a new place for lunch on my way back: Pita International.\\n\\nSignage in this plaza can make things appear hidden (i.e. like the time I drove around for over an hour in this shopping plaza to look for a restaurant, come to find out it was directly in front of me, due to their inconspicuous signage). Luckily, Pita International has a purple and yellow sign and is located between a UPS store and a nail/tanning salon.\\n\\nThis time I didn't have problems finding the place, but I did have problems parking. Apparently everyone is on the same schedule. After circling the parking lot for 10 minutes, I finally found a spot. I walked into Pita International and a smell of curry, spices, onions filled the air. A sweet aroma. I felt like one of those cartoon characters who winds up flying due to the smell of a pie/good food cooking. Although I had the option of eating my meal there, I opted to get it to go. I ordered a chicken Shawarma pita. The guy at the counter was pleasant and added what seemed to be 3 lbs of chicken to the pita. As he kept scooping more and more chicken I thought to myself several things:\\n\\n1.       That's a lot of chicken\\n2.       That has to be at least 2 whole chicken breasts\\n3.       This pita is going to bust it's so full\\n4.       How will he be able to fit all the \\"fixins\\" in the pita?\\n5.       I'll never be able to eat all of that food\\n \\nAfter he was done scooping the chicken into the pita, it was time to choose my fixins (fixins always reminds me of Roy Roger restaurants in rest areas, because they used to have a fixins bar....I digress). I opted for tomatoes, lettuce, and cucumbers (the cucumbers were skinless, which I appreciate and love). The guy made the pita meticulously as to what order the items are placed on the pita. For instance, I mentioned lettuce, but he said that goes on last. I then got taziki sauce and topped the whole pita with feta. He wrapped the pita up in foil, I paid and was on my way.\\n\\nAfter driving about five minutes to my destination, I was ready to dig in. I carefully unwrapped the pita because I thought for sure that the whole thing was going to either break apart or explode, due to being so chockful. I bit into the ginormous pita. The chicken was perfectly seasoned with a curry-esque flavor. Each piece of chicken was super moist and flavorful. The crunch of the lettuce, tomatoes, and cucumbers paired nicely with the seasoned chicken. The taziki was creamy, flavorful, and garlicky. Just how I like it (please note, I'm Gree-talian, Greek/Italian, so I take my taziki seriously). The feta was soft and salty. The marriage of flavors was like a symphony in my mouth.\\n\\nRemember how above when I said \\"5. I'll never be able to eat all that food.\\" I was wrong. I ate every last bite.\\n\\nPros:\\n-Enough meat in my pita to feed two, maybe three people\\n-Fixins are fresh\\n-Variety of items on the menu\\n-Chicken is seasoned to perfection\\n-Service is quick and pleasant\\n\\nCons:\\n-My self-control\\n-Parking during peak times like lunch/dinner/after work can be problematic\\n\\nTips: Since portions are so large, you could probably share with a friend/significant other/your pet/etc. Unless you're me, then you eat the entire pita."},{"name":"Neptune Oyster","address":"63 Salem St","city":"Boston","stars":"4.5","text":"I tried 5 different lobster rolls in Boston and this one beats the others.  By. Far.\\n\\nThe last time we attempted to eat here the wait was 2+ hours so this time we went on a weekday around 5:30pm.  There was no wait and we were seated right away.  Inside was small and we were practically having dinner with the friendly couple next to us.  The service was fast and friendly.  We ordered Neptune on Piggyback, one hot lobster roll, on cold lobster roll, and north end Cioppino.\\n\\nThe Neptune on Piggyback had plump oysters fried perfectly but still retained the freshness.  The golden raisins, greens, and aioli were refreshing flavors in the dish.  Then came our lobster rolls.  Huge chunks of glorious lobster meat spilling out of the lightly toasted rolls.  Stunning first look.  First bite confirmed the first look.  The flavor of the lobster meat was enhanced by the mayo/butter.  No fillers just fresh lobster meat with the perfect amount of butter/mayo.  The hot butter lobsters and cold mayo lobsters were different but equally delicious.  Don't forget the rolls.  They wouldn't be perfect lobster rolls without the rolls.  The rolls weren't limp or too small or too big.  They were just right.  These are the lobster role (pun intended) models  that all others should strive to be.\\n\\nSure the lobsters rolls were fantastic but the Cioppino was a serious contender.  Fresh, jumbo shrimp, scallops, clams, mussels, fish, and rice all swimming in the saffron infused briny broth.  It was simple and complex, and rich and light all at the same time.  I think I forgot my manners and licked the last drop of the broth.

Emily and Leah were also nice enough to share some of their green papaya salad.  Maybe it was because it was so late or because there's no flavor I love more in meat than grilled smokiness, but everything was absolutely scrumptious.  Having charcoal-grilled shrimp in a spring roll kicks the flavor up a huge step.  I'm honestly not sure I'll be able to eat them the regular way now.  The papaya salad was so fresh, and fresh really is the best word because it's the only word that encompasses all the sensory inputs that this dish delivers in texture, flavor, and healthiness.  And then there was the smoky duck.  I'm not a huge fan of dolmades, which is what popped into my head when I read grape leave wrapped, but this was nothing like this.  The smokiness of the meat was perfect. The textures of the rice vermicelli with julienne vegetables was the perfect compliment, and once I doused the whole thing with the chili sauce, it made for a filling dish that didn't leave me filled with guilt.   \\n\\nThe place is small in a very cozy way.  They weren't really sure how to handle our large group, so it took a while to get situated, but it once settled, the service was good.  They brought us tiny chocolate mocha cake bites - just a little something sweet to balance all the smoke and spice.

The worst part about the entire interaction is that I almost got my food the first time I ordered through the app. The time changed three times and then hit a plateau on slightly delayed, so I gave them a call about my order. The person who helped me on to-go was nice at first, but upon returning to the call to ask my name about the order her and the person she was speaking with seemed confused. They couldn't find my order or my name and so eventually it chalked up to \\"the order was sent out but it seems the driver canceled the order\\", monotone- thats it. And you know what magically- after the staring at the Uber app for over half an hour- I had a dRiVeR and the cancellation appeared on the app as she said that. \\n\\nHave you ever rolled your eyes so deep that time passed as if you went to sleep? \\n\\nI can't even take it out on the girl, but there was no attempt of reconciliation and none from whoever else was next to her.

I applaud the quickness, but after tasting it, I was a little disappointed. The flavors were there, but the biscuit was a little hard and the gravy was lukewarm. I understand that this location is their busiest one and that everyone is obsessed with Reggie D, but can I at least have him freshly made? It honestly makes a world of a difference. \\n\\nOther than the fact that the sandwich didn't taste fresh, everything else was fine. The service was good and the interior was pretty clean.

Family style is having a sit-down meal where food is placed on the table in large serving dishes from which diners serve themselves. Our waiter kept saying the menu was family style which was hard to believe when I'm paying a whopping $26 for THREE (3) Scallops?! And this was listed as an entree! WTFFFF!

To the beans and mac and cheese. \\n\\nFinally, to top it off I shared a peach cobbler with my husband. Letting him eat half and I ate the other half.

It's a local joint, serving a full menu 24 hours everyday, breakfast all day too, at reasonable prices. Their menu reflect some of the best of a common Austin breakfast. We were staying at a hotel in downtown Austin, and my friend strongly recommended we check out Magnolia (over Waffle House, which we saw on our way to the hotel). Only a 10 min drive from downtown, it was totally worth checking out. Be wary of a wait. We had a table of 3 going for a Friday at noon, so the wait was about 20-30 min. A full party must be present in order to be seated. They also have a small outdoor patio in the back if you want quicker seating. I'd say the only issues, naturally, were some bees hovering around and the humidity that day, otherwise it was fine. \\n\\nFor food, we each shared a bit of our own plates, which consisted of the Mag Scramble (eggs scrambled with Magnolia-blend spices and fresh spinach, fresh diced tomato and avocado, rice and black beans on the side), Love Migas (scrambled eggs in spicy Love butter (fresh garlic and serrano) with tomato, onion, bell pepper, tortilla chips and jack cheese, black beans and tortillas on the side), blueberry pancakes, sausage, and vegetable omelette with mixed cheese. The Mag Scramble and Love Migas are phenomenal simple breakfast dishes, that were more traditional of Austin. Nicely scrambled eggs, ample portions, a nice pairing with their rice and beans. The blueberry pancakes were also a winner. If you ask for hot sauce, make sure to ask for their local Habanero Yellowbird sauce. They have a giftshop next door called Prima Dora that sells these sauces as well. Highly recommend this sauce to go with those delectable eggs.\\n\\nI wish I could have breakfast like this everyday. This sort of food is just hard to find from even NYC, despite what you'd expect. I was an instant fan of Magnolia, and if I was a local or visitor, it could easily become a go to spot. It's conveniently 24 hours, so come anytime. Their servers were very friendly and welcoming. Given the amount of food, the pricing was more than reasonable.

You also know it's worth a trip to see it for yourself if I give it a 5 star because let's face it, I'm one of the pickiest reviewers in term of taste and service in the world. I first stumbled upon this hidden jem when looking up good lunch places around the A. Yelp reviewers made this one of the up and coming spots since it's only been around for 3 weeks. I mentioned this place to my friends, and due to its closeness to Emory, we went---and what a great choice it was! When we first walked in, the restaurant gave a very friendly vibe. There are various faces that denote the country ie style of sandwhich you want. Since we ate at an odd time, seven hens was not that busy. As a result, we had a chance to interact with the chef, Ryan, and restaurant owner/visionary, Michael. Both were extremely nice guys as they explained the concept of seven hens and how it came to fruition. I chose India as my country, and had it with tofu on a whole wheat baguette with their indian spice rub and house cucumber salad to top. As a side, my friend and I split their fries. The first thing to note is how fresh everything is---all items are made to order (including the fries), and Ryan does it right in front of you! My indian tofu sandwhich was exactly what I wanted; big and messy, and the tofu was rubbed with wonderful indian spices which balanced perfectly with the housemade cucumber salad...[salivating yet? ;)]. The fries (hefty portion of about 6-7 ounces) had the perfect crunchiness because Ryan is a god of fries and oiled/seasoned them to perfection. One of my friends chose Mexico, and he said it was one of the best sandwhiches he has had in awhile. My other friend made his own country and really liked the combination of hummus with avacado. For desert, they have king of pops popsicle! I almost died when I saw that. I mean, it's THE BEST IDEA EVER!!!! King of Pops is a staple to Atlanta and they had the best flavors too (chocolate sea salt, rasberry lime bar, etc). NO matter what time of day you go, you will be treated like the god and godess you think you are. The service is awesome; the people are friendly, and every bite of the food you choose hits that spot in your belly that tells you a restaurant like this doesn't come around too often.

However, I will say that I am a HUGE pizza fan! I could literally eat pizza three or four times a week if nobody was watching.\\n\\nWe've been staying in Malden for a few weeks and decided we needed some take out on a hot evening. I called up New York Pizza and was able to get delivery in around half an hour (and with only $1 delivery fee!).\\n\\nThe pizzas are all fresh, chewy, flavorful and on a yummy thin crust that isn't greasy in any way or form. The first night we ordered in, we got a medium White pizza (Mozzarella cheese, ricotta cheese, fresh basil, garlic, sprinkle Parmesan cheese) and a medium Meat Lovers (Pepperoni, sausage, bacon, meatballs and ham). The pizzas were BIG, more than enough for two hungry people, and very hot and fresh.\\n\\nI (the orderer of the White pizza) loved the mass amounts of ricotta cheese on top of my pizza. The ricotta was delicious - fresh tasting and slightly sweet, adding a nice richness that didn't feel heavy or oily (which is hard to find in an all-cheese pizza). The basil, albiet kind of more 'fried' than fresh, thanks to what I'm assuming is the time in the pizza oven) was still flavorful and stood out. The pizza was sprinkled with just enough garlic to add flavor without being offensive, and I loved the ample amount of cornmeal on the bottom of the crust, adding a little crunch to each bite.\\n\\nMy boyfriend had the Meat Lovers and it was exactly what he expected. I actually had a piece the next morning for breakfast and was surprised by how much MEAT was piled onto the pizza. It was a great balance with the thin crust and they didn't add too much cheese, which managed to reduce the grease-factor a little bit.\\n\\nWe ordered in again a few days later, this time only getting a large White pizza and an order of the cheesie bread. The large pizza was a formidable size, very very big, and the cheesie bread was the size of a medium pizza. I wasn't sure what to expect as the definition of cheese bread differs from place to place - At NY Pizza, it's definition is a pizza crust with garlic and lots of mozza, and a tangy marinara sauce for dipping. Not too bad, but I spent so much time trying to cram as much White pizza in as I could, I didn't pay much attention to it.\\n\\nAll in all, New York Pizza did exactly what I expected it to. Great, fresh, hot original pizza for a great price and in a good delivery time.

We were sharing a steak, so we were pretty surprised when it came out on one plate and without a steak knife.  And I'm sure you all know what's coming next, it took about 10 minutes to get the knife.  When we finally had everything we needed, we cut into our steak and, go figure, it was medium instead of medium rare.  We waited a short time, but as it became clear we weren't going to see our server again, we went ahead and ate our (now cold) steak.  If the food had been better, I wouldn't mention this, but presentation was also extremely disappointing.  \\n\\nIn summation, it seemed as if they haven't really sorted out the kinks in staffing and the server we had seemed untrained and lacked the knowledge necessary to work in fine dining.  The price point did not match up to service or food.  It is vastly underwhelming given its predecessor."},{"name":"Porto","address":"Ring Rd","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"I was excited to try Porto after hearing rave reviews from my sister and parents.  \\n\\nLet me say the theme of the restaurant that night was confused poor service! \\n\\nWhen I first walked in I got great vibes and was excited to sit outside for a late dinner on one of the last warm nights in September.  Sitting outside seemed to confuse them, we had to wait for a table even with a reservation, no big deal we would order a bottle of wine and oysters.  Well when someone finally came to give us menus and we said we wanted to order wine and oysters that seemed to confuse her! Because we didn't see her again.  My husband spoke to the hostess and then a manager came over, took our order.\\n\\nWhen a different person brought use the oysters she has no idea which ones were what. We ordered 3 different types and when we wanted to order more (because they were good) no one could help us with the type we liked best.  Our wine finally showed up with our second round of oysters.\\n\\nAt this point we still were waiting for a table so we ordered the Paella because it said it took 40 mins to prepare. And thought our timing would be perfect to sit, have some apps and then the paella would arrive. \\n\\nWell when we finally sat down our paella arrived minutes after we ordered some appetizers. \\n\\nWe ate it and it was amazing (Only reason for the 2 stars).

We informed the waitress and she told us she would heat them up. Another long wait and the manager informed us that we were getting fresh meals and were top priority and apologised for the wait. He then gave us some nachos and our meal eventually arrived, it was still cold and I handed it back. My two friends were too hungry to care and this stage ate what they could despite it being cold.

Not even as much as a free drink.

I was surprised that I liked the smoked seafood dip as much as I did. I'd never tried a cold seafood dip before so I was a bit weary about trying it but I was impressed. It definitely had a smokey flavor. It would have been nice if they served it with bread crostinis instead of saltine crackers, as I think this would have improved the value and overall quality of the appetizer, but it was still really good. My girlfriend was satisfied with her fried shrimp. \\n\\nWhat we were most impressed with were our entrees. Wow! I ordered the crab crusted corvina and it was VERY good. The flavors of the corvina, the crab cake, the mashed potatoes, and the lemon butter sauce were well balanced and very tasty. I was extremely impressed. While the portion was fair, it was so good that I definitely would have eaten more if it if more had been on my plate! I would highly recommend it for anyone who loves seafood like I do and if I ever return here, I'm definitely ordering this again.

Lines form about 15-20 minutes before opening time and we were lucky to be among the first seating.  Given the fast pace and crowds, it's nice to see the interior is very classic and nice.  You'll probably share a table with another group and forget sitting together if you have more than 4 in your party.  \\n\\nBut it's all worth it.  \\n\\nWe started with a small selection from the raw oyster bar and then finished with their famous lobster rolls.   Our oysters were the Wellfleet and the Pemaquid and we paired them with some Cherrystone clams.\\n\\nBoth the oysters and the clams were probably the freshest I've ever had.  They had a great salty brininess and were crisp and cold.  I've shucked oysters at two places and the quality of these easily topped Hog island.  Much sweeter, more refined and ultra smooth.  It was a treat.  The clams were a similar story.  Very fresh and not as chewy as I feared as I rarely have rare clams.  The only knock is that the price of the oysters here (very) quickly ramps up.  Blink and you'll be going into 3 figure lunch or dinner territory.\\n\\nThe hot lobster rolls were next and I loved the fact that the buns were toasty and the lobster meat was warm.  As someone who dislikes cold sandwiches, I appreciated the choice between hot and cold.  The hot is also more naked, essentially ginormous pieces of lobster just topped with subtle butter.  No mayo, no garnish....it's all about the lobster.  I personally like a little mayo, but when you're downing huge pieces of tender lobster, it's hard to complain.  $26 a roll makes you pause a minute too....\\n\\nIf fresh and seafood is what you want, you must make a stop at Neptune's.

Would have loved to have it as a tofu option too. The beef tofu was delish but lots of onion. No egg to crack it into tho. And I wished they had ground or minced beef, vs the slices. But that's just preference. The pork hock was a big portion, but nothing else to call home about. The sauce that came with it was the only way it was tasty. They have a good selection of beer and soju. Though we picked the green grape soju and tasted like Dimetapp Cough Syrup. We had brought some wine (which they don't have) and they would charge a corkage fee. It was my mom's bday, so they waived the charge. They do have a bottle opener, but bring one with a twist top just in case. The Seafood pancake was nicely crisp on the outside and thick. The little appetizer dishes were pretty standard and nothing exciting or super tasty. We normally ask for 2nds and 3rds at other places if it were tasty. We got the jajang noodles too and never had it before and the it was very tasty, but I couldn't figure out what kind of meat was in it and which part. It was very saucy.

I live in the neighborhood and I used to pick up breakfast sandwiches from them very often. I hadn't been in a while and when I stopped in today I noticed some things had changed, in particular the menu was now hanging behind the counter instead of on the side wall and I didn't see the small menu they used to have at the register indicating the items/ingredients available for a custom breakfast sandwich. So I asked the guy behind the counter (who I know to be the owner of the place because I met him while there on a previous occasion) if they still did the 'make your own' breakfast sandwiches and he replied curtly, \\"No, we haven't done that in like two years.\\" (Definitely wasn't two years ago the last time I was there, but ok, no biggie) I thought it might be easier to tell him what I had in mind so he could point me in the right direction so I replied that I was looking for a bagel sandwich with bacon, egg, and cheese. He rudely responded, \\"If you just read the menu you can figure it out from there\\" and then immediately turned around and walked away into the back of the building. Wow. Mind you, there was no one else in line and only one other person eating in the entire place so it's not like he was busy helping other customers. Anyway, I was so taken aback by how rude, unwelcoming, and unhelpful he was I just decided to leave.

American Craft is owned by the same person who is behind The Publick House (just east of American Craft on Beacon Street) as well as the now-closed Roadhouse Restaurant, which was in the same space as American Craft until it closed in the winter of 2010. The article mentions that while a spokesperson for Barcelona Restaurant and Wine Bar says that the company is indeed hoping to open in the American Craft space, the owner of American Craft and The Publick House did not respond to calls from the newspaper about whether American Craft may be moving elsewhere or simply closing.\\n\\nBarcelona Restaurant and Wine Bar first started out in 1995, while its sister restaurant Bar Taco was introduced in 2010. The former can be found in Fairfield, Greenwich, New Haven, South Norwalk, Stamford, and West Hartford, CT, as well as Atlanta, GA, while the latter can be found in Stamford, CT, and Port Chester, NY.\\n\\n[November 23 update: This has just been confirmed; Barcelona will indeed be taking over American Craft and has town approval to transfer the liquor license, though it still needs the state's approval.

You can tell she's lying, and I still can't figure out why.

No other server or a manager was in sight to assist her. We finally make our order and it takes 15 minutes or so for us to even get our food. Half of the order was correct and the other half was incorrect. We order the same exact that for both of us. The boneless wings were ordered naked with a side of buffalo sauce. One order came naked without the side of sauce and the other was drenched in buffalo sauce. I didn't even want to wait for new food because of what was already happening, so I took the drenched wings. They were already cold and tasted gross, so I ended up not even eating them. At this point, a phone order client was harassing the bartender and finally the manager came out. Instead of assisting her employee, all she did was basically scold her in front of the clients.

You have to get sort of lucky to get a parking spot close during peak times at Town Brookhaven, but there is plenty of free parking nearby at the garage. \\n\\nThis place is quite large both indoors and outside. The weather was really nice last night so they had all the doors and windows opened so it created a really nice outside feel throughout the whole place. The decor is nice casual. There was live acoustic music that was pleasant. Not too loud but audible across the whole place. \\n\\nI sat at the bar and was attended to right away.  My cocktail was made quickly and mixed properly. I ordered two appetizers as I wasn't hungry enough for a full meal. The crab & artichoke dip and 6 mild wings. They have an extensive bourbon and whisky menu so that is a big plus for me. \\n\\nThe food came pretty quickly. The crab dip was super tasty served with fresh warm pita bread. I really liked it with one significant gripe. The chunks of artichoke are WAY too big. I would say some were almost 1/4 - 1/2 of a whole artichoke heart. If they had cut the hearts to much smaller bits, I would give the dish a 5+. \\n\\nNow the wings. I ordered mild for a reason. I like spicy at times, but I had a spicy lunch so did not want to push my luck with my stomach with a spicy dinner. Well their mild is NOT mild. I'm not a wimp when it comes to spice. They were very eatable, but if I were the kind to really not be able to handle spicy, I would have sent them back. They were okay wings, nothing special. Just be warned that their spice gauge is off at HobNob. \\n\\nWith 2 cocktails and 2 apps my bill was $40 which is about right. \\n\\nThere were a lot of things on the menu that I want to try, and the atmosphere was nice.

All of the hot food was not hot - more lukewarm. The sausage balls were barely cooked through. The avocado toast was almost inedible - so much sauce and mayonnaise and extra things on top that I had to wipe off. My total was $25 before tip and I felt like I got so little food. I tried a bite of my bf's biscuit and it was actually one of the blandest biscuits I have ever eaten - almost tasted like there was no salt or butter in it at all, even though it looked great. \\n\\nIt's unfortunate that whoever's running the kitchen doesn't know how to cook decent food because it has such potential - great ambiance, friendly service (even though it was slow service and had to ask multiple times for sauces, coffee etc).

Throughout our experience, we received warm, courteous, & knowledgeable service. We were primarily visiting Ichiza due to their 100% vegan menu & our fondness for Chinese & Japanese fare--thus, though no fault of their own, we were a bit thrown off when we realized they were only serving their Filipino Eats Week menu this week. We opted to try two appetizers (one of which turned out to be quite large with the $4 addition of the vegan pork belly) & one main dish--we both quite enjoyed the Lumpia (similar to spring rolls, featuring a mixture of vegan beef, sweet potatoes, & carrots), found the Pinakbet Ampalaya (a gumbo-like dish) exceedingly salty although the vegetables were perfectly cooked, & were fond of the Tamarind Sinagang until the vinegar component became a bit overwhelming. My wife & I admittedly had no experience with Filipino food prior to today's meal, but I'd be remiss to say we were pleased with our food given the prices ($33 before tip for one bite-size appetizer, & two stews that included far more rice & broth than vegetables &/or vegan protein).

I will start by saying I have visited Cultivate 4 times. I had food twice while visiting and an iced caramel latte w/almond milk each time. It's clearly the latte that keeps me coming back - it is delicious and definitely my favorite in the nearby area. I will also say that this review concludes with me calling a staff member a bitch. Buckle up, it will be long but insightful and hopefully appropriately handled. \\n\\nThe visit this review pertains to was my last visit, which was yesterday - June 16th (Father's Day). I was super excited to introduce my husband to my new favorite coffee spot but I knew it would be busy for Father's Day so I opted to do an online food order. We were going hiking so it was great to just eat on the way. We placed our order on-line and were advised it would be ready for pickup at the host station at 11:50am. We pulled in at exactly 11:50 but went straight to the coffee station to order some coffee before we picked up the on-line order. While my husband waited for our coffee, I proceeded to the host station to pickup our food. It was VERY hectic at the host station. Not only because of all the people waiting to be greeted but because of all the servers picking up the food to be served. The food window is directly in front of the host station. I stood for several minutes (at least 5 mins) along with others without being spoken to. I would like to blame this on it being a holiday weekend but when I went in on a random weekday with very few people, I stood at the host station by myself for several minutes without a greeting. More than one person looked at me standing there and the person who finally seated me, also ended up being my server. I have no complaints about that day other than the host issue. The food was delicious and my service ended up being great!\\n\\nBack to yesterday ... Ultimately, I ended up approaching the person nearest me to let her know I was picking up an on-line order. She was very unfriendly about me approaching her and seemed very confused by me saying I was picking up an order. She asked me what I meant I was picking up an order? I let her know I had placed an order on-line to be picked up. By this time, it was slightly after noon. She proceeded to ask me what I had ordered. Full transparency, I knew what I had ordered but did not know what my husband had ordered because I had handed my phone to him to add his on and he completed the order. I knew I had ordered a biscuit sandwich ... so, I replied that I ordered biscuits and told her the order was under my name, Crystal Rogers. I never saw her go look for my order. She came over to me with a box - I take the box and walk towards my husband at the coffee bar. When I open the box, there are literally biscuits in the box. I take the box back over to her and let her know we did not literally order biscuits, I did not realize I needed to be exactly specific about the order that had a name on it. She very rudely responded, you might want to be exact, if you want me to give you the right order. When someone is repeatedly smart with me - I give them what they give me. I quipped, let me pull up my email with my order that I placed over 40 minutes ago with MY NAME and very specific details. When I showed her the e-mail, she immediately said \\"we never received the order\\". At no point has this woman apologized to me for giving me the wrong order or \\"not receiving\\" my order. She continues to treat me as a burden to the establishment. I finally say .. ok, so ... what about my order? By this point, my husband is also at the host station and another employee hears what is going on so she asks me to follow her to the coffee station. My order was at the coffee station. She went on to say, she realized I was angry and she apologizes that my order was ready and there the whole time. I let her know that the confirmation gave instructions to pick it up at the host station, not the coffee station to which she did not reply. However, my husband and I were very thankful that she apologized to us and proceeded to leave. \\n\\nDuring our exit, I could hear two of the staff members talking about how I needed to fix my attitude. I ignored that but as I was walking out the door, the staff member that had been treating me poorly said ... I hope you have a blessed day. Now, if you're southern .. you know that's translation to someone giving you the middle finger. Especially when considering the chain of events. I turned around and said ... I hope you do too, bitch. \\n\\nI am certainly not proud of saying that. Not because I think she did not deserve it. It's because it is out of character for me. Several of the staff members began throwing around threats, including a male member of the staff. \\n\\nNeedless to say, I will NEVER return. I would not feel safe in doing so. That is unfortunate, considering I actually love the food and coffee."},{"name":"Scampo","address":"215 Charles St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"First, we called for reservations and the women who answered could not speak English.

Olivia was our bartender/waitress. Really nice woman. She acknowledged us right away (bar was officially full after we sat down) and brought us the menus. I ordered the Bootleg Hurricane and my friend ordered the classic red sangria. Mine was nice and fruity but definitely had a kick to it (left with a little buzz lol). I LOVE eggs benedict so I already knew I wanted to try theirs before I walked in. I ordered that and my friend ordered the bootleg melt (basically similar to what I had but in a sandwich and no egg). I loved my plate. The only thing I would suggest is to have them poach the egg medium because the dish has plenty of sauce on it. Great flavors! And of course we had to order some beignets! Tasted just as good as the ones I had in New Orleans earlier this year. My friend ordered another drink - The Speed Ball. I didn't get to taste it but he said he really liked it. Olivia insisted we stay and get more drinks lol but we were both driving so we had to decline.

Keep pressing past the valet and head down the elevator to the garden and there you will find La Grotta. Beware tall friends: the ceilings are quite low upon entry so be prepared to duck. Once you make it through these obstacles a cute little Italian restaurant resides with both indoor and outdoor seating. \\n\\nAmbiance wise, not our favorite stop but the pasta is some of the best we've found in Atlanta. We started with the mussles and Caesar salad. The Caesar was overdressed to the point it was almost uneatable but wow the flavor was there. Super sad to see that happen. The mussels were alright, a bit big for my liking but once again the flavor of the broth was there. My biggest complaint of the whole experience was a $2 split fee for each item... I guess I can get behind a salad split but the mussels? That's just unreasonable to me. In my opinion, an appetizer is meant to be split among the table especially one like mussels that is in bulk quantity. Its for this reason that I am dropping them a star on my review. \\n\\nNow on to the good stuff: pasta. It's not displayed on the menu any longer but from reading yelp reviews I learned they will do a half portion of all pasta and risotto dishes so we decided to get three half portions and family style the table. The sacchetti was about the best thing I've ever tried. I have a deep love for truffle so it was right up my alley and I embarrassed my boyfriend by sipping the remaining sauce with a spoon and then running our second helping of bread through it after that. I just couldn't have a single drop of that goodness left behind. Our second favorite was the lobster pappardelle. The pasta was so thin and light with the most beautiful sauce and an abundance of lobster. It was simply amazing. Our third pasta was the penne con verdure and it was good but not nearly as special as the first two (more of the type of item I could make at home). We ended up boxing that one to go so we could focus on the others. \\n\\nWe finished with the flourless chocolate cake and it was delish. Unfortunately instead of being topped with vanilla bean gelato as described on the menu we got a honey fig and it really took away from the cake and wasn't our favorite. Bummer because otherwise it would have been a 10. This also wasn't communicated to us which we didn't love, always appreciate a \\"hey so sorry we are out of _ but here are the options for a substitute\\" because in this case we probably would have ordered a different dessert. \\n\\nThis restaurant has the potential to be a five stars for me but unfortunately small details made it ultimately miss the mark."},{"name":"Tommy Want Wingy","address":"94 Rainey St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"I really wanted to like this place. Especially since my husband loves chicken wings and really liked the chicken here. I thought it was just okay. The lemon pepper had a good balance of lemon and salt in it.

The drummets were all a little too chunky and dry for my liking. \\n\\nWhat I had the most problem with was the service. Generally you expect a nice and friendly face when buying from a food truck but the guy at the truck was not too kind and a little curt in my opinion. Maybe he had a bad day? The weather was too hot? I asked if I can mix the tater tots and fries together and he gave a curt \\"no.\\" Okay fine I get it. No flexibility. That's fine.

Had so many friends of mine mention it on their social media. I have been to Ponko 3-4 times ever since they had started as a VERY small restaurant when they only 4-5 seats and this was the first time I tried them with two of my friends 1-2 years ago. I tried their Ponko chicken strips with their original flavor with two side combo, which I tried their fries and salad. Salads are pre-made in a box and I asked for a vinagarette I think. Tasted decent and the fries are too. Chicken was juicy and the original flavor was good. The second time I went, they had expanded and had much more space and I ordered the same thing as the the first time. It was consistent. Third time I went was recently last week. With the whole Popeyes spicy chicken hype, I tried Ponko's chicken sandwich with their spicy flavoring. I also ordered their green bean special which was an additional up-charge. It is a little pricey just for a chicken sandwich, but the spice was okay. Not as spicy as I would like. The slaw was good, but makes the sandwich a bit messy to eat, some bites were more saucy than others but the chicken was big and juicy still with a good crunch. I think the spicy sauce that they put on the chicken makes the chicken crust a bit soft. I would probably order the chicken sandwich again ($10). The green beans didn't taste like anything except overwhelmed with so much of the miso sauce. The green beans were also thinner than expected. I would definitely try this place if you're craving some fusion fried chicken. It has gotten a bit more expensive than the initial trip, but probably because they are more popular now. I wish there was an accessible trash can. There is also a bar for your alcoholic needs and I think they have trivia games sometimes. It is right off the Chamblee exit from 85N. Decent food to fill you up, but a bit expensive."},{"name":"Oviedo Brewing Company","address":"1280 Oviedo Mall Blvd, Ste 1095","city":"Oviedo","stars":"4","text":"Great place to grab a drink & socialize.

The cramped restaurant strikes a fine balance between comfortable and sophisticated. Freshly shucked oysters are displayed prominently outside the huge front window. The long marble stretches the length of the restaurant, and white subway tiles decorate the wall. A long mirror behind prominent displays the raw options and draft offerings. Beside the mirror, recessed shelving units display wine options galore. Ruby red upholstery and small tables stretch opposite the bar. Globe lights with bronze accents hang from the punched metal ceiling, creating an intimate dining space, despite the customers being literally shoulder-to-shoulder.\\n\\nMy partner and I arrived about 20 minutes early on Friday, and not a moment too soon -- a large party showed up within seconds of our arrival. We people-watched for a bit before an employee lifted the metal sliding door from the front window. The hostess beckoned us toward the bar, and we were quickly greeted and handed menus and raw bar pencil cards. Glancing on the Specials, I perked up as soon as I saw \\"Sea Urchin\\" on the raw bar offerings. We opted for the Wellfleet Clam Chowder, an assortment of MA-caught oysters (Neptune Pearl, Katama Bay, Beach Point), two sea urchins, and a Maine Lobster Roll, hot with butter. Like clockwork, each patron at the bar was brought out their order in turn. By the time our piping hot soup was placed before us, my stomach was growling ravenously. The chowder was among the best I've had, maintaining a pleasant creaminess without diminishing the star of the bowl -- the clams. The oysters, each brine-y with a characteristic finish, were served with Cocktail and Mignonette sauces, allowing us to mix and match a symphony of flavors. The sea urchins, meanwhile, were served in-shell. While not quick as flavorful as the Pacific varieties I grew up on, these were a welcome blast to the past. Finally, the lobster roll was served on a toasted brioche roll, dripping with butter. The amount of lobster meat was more than generous, but I found myself wishing that the roll would hold up better, rather than becoming a sloppy mess. The fries on the side were perfectly crispy on the outside, soft on the inside, and sprinkled with an Old Bay-like seasoning.\\n\\nThe meal worked out to right around $90 after tax and tip. I won't say that I was heavily full after the meal; rather, it felt like a power lunch before we went off for a busy day. Moreover, the seafood offerings, while top-notch and fresh as can be, still bordered on overly expensive ($3 per oyster; $32 for the lobster roll).

Anyways. They wanted to meet at the Portland City Grill so I said OK. I was looking at taking the stairs but I wouldn't recommend this option. The food place is on the 30th floor.\\n\\nSo you take a super fast elevator up - I felt like Willie Wonker.\\n\\nYou exit the lift (elevator for you AMERICANS. im american, but when I'm drinking wine I'm with British or English. Never both.) and it opens directly into the Bar. They have a happy hour on most days before dinner, and it is really busy.  They have some pretty fair prices, but I'm serious when I saw you more pay for the view than I did the ceaser salad. There was a bit too much sauce on there and the croutons were in MUCH abundance. Felt like I was playing hockey trying to deek all the croutons to get to the lettuce. \\n\\nShawna got the mac and cheese. I didn't take a picture nor have any, but it smelled good. It was the more sea-shell type. Sarah had the LEEK salad. Never seen or heard of it. I think its what the swanky YUPPIES are eating to stay fit. Which doesn't make sense to me -- take it from me. I've been alive for quite awhile just by RAW exercise, mostly morning walks.\\n\\nAnyways, the AMBIANCE is GREAT. You feel like you're in a high class restraint (because you ware) They have waiters walking around in nice clothing (tight cut dress pants on some). They have a large selection of wine, which none of ever drink, but if we did, it was there, if we wanted it, which we didn't.\\n\\nSo, they have bench seats right next to the windows (see the picture above or below or anybody picture). Only problem, the wait. There were couples (2 people) sitting where our sextet (us 6) wanted to sit. So we kindly asked them to move. I did it because I'm old and can act senile, but it works. But the view. Breathtaking. \\n\\nThere was piano in the background. \\n\\nI sat in awe of the city and the company I was with. I feel I was able to really slow down time and enjoy the moment as time became a memory. It's amazing how you can exist in a body, but then look out the window and really realize how small you are to the actual world.\\n\\nOK - Time to start dinner.

Really nice dish and perfect starter.  Tofu stir fry was just a classic, easy to eat dish.  Broccoli, pea shoot, carrot, mushroom, and more with nice slightly seared tofu.  This dish wasn't too spicy and would have been great by itself for a quality lunch or dinner.  Dee Dee really approaches the food truck game well.

College Ave, which runs parallel to some train tracks, and sits in a small building that also house a beer store, cafe, and hair salon. There's limited parking in front of the building, and on the other side of the road in the gravel lot. I've never seen it packed to where you couldn't park.\\n\\nAmbiance: hip/hipster and chill, with some eclectic donut-themed prints on the wall. There's a few tables and chairs inside. There's also a small table outside to enjoy if the weather's nice. It's a cute part of town with lots of people jogging and walking their dogs. Staff was solid and friendly. \\n\\nFood: There's two main types of donuts: yeast v. cake. I had one of each in the chocolate frosting flavor. Cake is a little smaller, crispier. Yeast has more size and density. Density is the thing there, because even the cake one has a little too much. This leads to a weird chewy texture. I want my donuts to be airy and gentle crumble as I bight into them. Doesn't happen with Revolution. The chocolate flavor itself was just OK too. And this is coming from a guy who loves chocolate, and has a very wide and low threshold for what's good. There's a good variety of other flavors available, including caramel bacon, carrot cake, and their often photographed raspberry sprinkle. But none of those are going to matter because the dough is the make or break part. I've actually had raspberry sprinkle before at a food festival; and I recall being disappointed after I bit into it, but I wanted to give their chocolate one (my go to standard for all donut shops) a chance. I also had a bite of boo's maple bacon and vanilla flavors. They all gave me a \\"meh\\" reaction. The price is pretty fair at $2-$3 for hand made treats. \\n\\nThey also have a large variety of cold and hot coffees. I didn't get any on this trip, but I certainly wouldn't mind trying them in the future. \\n\\nKudos for having large letters on their menu, as well as their line of merch. I have a thing for mesh trucker hats of food places I visit; I just wish I liked Revolution enough to get their cool brown hat. \\n\\nClosing Thoughts: I know I'm in the minority, but I don't love Revolution's donuts. This is sad to say since I love sweets, and I particular love donuts.

My first  dish included a skirt steak from a locally sourced farm (PDX style) and a side of duck duck potatoes (oh my ) and my main course was a lovely  \\"Oregon Pinot Noir\\" (my husband and I prefer Oregon Pinot's over our California offerings). Oregon Pinot's are abundant in Portland, so I was fully satisfied with this arrangement for the evening. \\n\\nThis is a great place downtown to come with others and share good food, wine and conversation.

It was clean and it looks like they have a nice patio, and unfortuntely those are the best things I can say about this trip and that is where the positives end.\\n\\nMy problems with this place is twofold, food quality and service.\\n\\nWatching the Super Bowl I was blitzed with fresh and never frozen adds. Who cares if your cooks don't know the difference between a tasty, juicy burger and a piece of chili meat. Not trying to pick on this individual location but this an issue across the franchise. Proper training or retraining of all your grill people would have a bigger impact than 10,000,000.00 worth of advertising.\\n\\nThe people that work at Wendy's use to be what made this chain great. People that cared about their customers as well as their employees and coworkers. Whoever decided that dine in isn't as important as the drive thru needs to join Dave Thomas in a better place because it should never take 15 minutes to get a dine in meal especially when there is no one in front of you.  I watched three employees working on two drive thru orders while my cashier stood around watching them work and waiting for them to give her my order.  \\n\\nI realize cash handling means washing hands or putting on gloves if you are going to help with the food, but this chain use to cross train people so they could do everything in the store.  Store management didn't make the decision to change their fries or switch their ketchup to a disgusting house blend, but they are responsible for hiring new employees, training all employees, getting rid of incompetent employees, overseeing customer relations and the customer experience, and making sure the food you serve would meet the standards of Dave Thomas. When there is a breakdown in any of the above that is on you.\\n\\nAs far as corporate, Wendy's your new fries suck unless you get them within five minutes out of the frier. You tell me they are better, than why didn't you make the change when Dave was in charge? Your new fries have 1/3 the hold time, no one has any idea how to salt them, and they generally tast like cardboard. When you still had heinz, you were able to drown the fries in red gold, with your unusable house blend they have to stand on their own and they don't hold a candle to your competitors.\\n\\nFor years Wendy's was my go to fast food restaraunt and now they are mostly something I drive by on my way to my next meal.

Try their garlic bread, and thank me later. The garlic cloves literally melt in your mouth with every bite. It's been infused in olive oil for a few days. & I must warn you, you'll have garlic bread after that.  The second night, (yes I came back) I had the special Mushroom Marsala & Garlic bread again.

Someone had recommended it to one of the couples.\\n\\nThis place is not worth the money at all.  In fact, I am not sure it is worth any price.  I am giving it 2 stars only because I have to assume me, and the 9 other people at the table made bad choices on what we ordered.  Clearly there must be something good there, otherwise this place could not continue to stay open.\\n\\nThe service was fine I suppose.\\n\\nFor the food:\\n\\nFor starters, my wife and I had the cheese plate and the ahi tuna tostados.  I'll give the tuna tostados a favorable mark, but that is it.  The cheeses were nothing special at all.  They serve the cheese with a bread with almonds in them.  Me and my wife don't like nuts, so we asked if they had some bread without nuts.  They said, \\"No problem.\\"  What we got was comical.  I am not exaggerating. It was Wonder Bread with the crust cut off and cut into triangles.  Not exactly a good fit for a fancy cheese plate.  Some other couples mentioned that their appetizer included what seemed to be the same Wonder Bread triangles, but deep fired.  Nobody cared for that.  Another couple said the Bone Marrow they ordered was not good at all.\\n\\nSo the main courses come.  After the appetizers we decided to play it pretty safe and cheap at that point.  I order the Buttermilk Fried Chicken and my wife ordered the burger.  The fried chicken was nothing special.  I prefer Popeye's or even Kroger fried chicken.  The mashed potatoes were runny.  My wife's burger was, well...a burger so we got what we expected there.\\n\\nAnother funny part was the dinner rolls they brought with the mains.  Again....I am not making this up.  It was a basket of Hawaiian sweet rolls.  Yes, the same kind you buy at the grocery.  And they don't even bother to warm them up.\\n\\nNone of the other couples were raving about their choices either.  \\n\\nSo basically, for $115 my wife and I got a couple of drinks, some average cheese, some Wonder Bread, 4 pieces of tuna on a cracker, some fried chicken and a hamburger, runny potatoes, and some Hawaiian rolls. \\n\\nThe fact that we were with 4 other very fun couples made the dinner not a total bust.  I did the math though.  For $50 or less I could have gone to Kroger and gotten: a nice bottle of wine, a pack of Hawaiian dinner rolls, 6 pieces of fried chicken, a side of mashed potatoes, and a pre-made tray of sushi.  Would have made for a better tasting dinner and saved $65.\\n\\nBy the way, the place was pretty busy when we got there, but by the time we left at 9:15 it was pretty cleared out.  On a Saturday night in that part of town, that is a pretty good sign of what is to come for Food 101.  I guess the name is appropriate as it was a 101 level experience at best.

They don't take reservations and I heard there was a long wait so I had been putting it off but with a foodie friend in town for the weekend craving some great seafood, we decided it was time. \\n\\nAMBIANCE/DECOR: given that Neptune is in the North End, I had assumed it would be old-looking with wood everywhere. Instead, I found a hybrid classic/modern setting that reminded me very much of Eventide in Portland (especially the logo on the window). They have a raw bar with oysters and writing on the wall with drink and oyster options which makes it very reminiscent of Eventide. However, the dining area (which mind you, probably only seats 30 or so) definitely gives off those old school vibes. This place is SMALL so you will be elbow to elbow with your neighbors (we made friends with ours!).\\n\\nTHE WAIT: ok I feel the need to address this as this was the most I've ever researched a restaurant on Yelp because I heard about the allegedly long Neptune Oyster wait time. Now this was just my experience which was on a cold Friday night in December so please know this won't be everyone's. We walk to the restaurant on the early side at 5:30, assuming there will be a 1.5-2 hour wait, and are pleasantly surprised that there isn't a line outside. There are a few others in the tiny entry way waiting to be seated or waiting to put their name in. There was no hostess as one of the waiters acts as the hostess and we have to wait maybe 10 minutes to put our name in. They write your name, party size, and phone number on a piece of paper and tell you an approximate wait time. For 3 at 5:30, they told us it would be 45 minutes. We decide to go down the street for a drink but not 5 minutes later, they call us saying our table is ready. We were still waiting for one of our friends so we told them to call us back, which they did 15 minutes later, and then 30 minutes after that. So we probably ended up waiting 45 minutes, though it could have been shorter, had we been ready. This is probably due in part to us coming on the early side but I was pleasantly surprised we didn't have to wait 2+ hours. \\n\\nFOOD: just amazing seafood. For the 3 of us, we ordered 2 appetizers and 2 entrees...I would recommend 3 out of the 4.\\n\\nFried Ipswich Clams: really meaty and lightly breaded whole clams bellies (the ratio of fried batter to actually clam was much better than I've had at other restaurants) with quite possibly the BEST tartar sauce I've ever tasted. It was thick and you could see the pickles in it and so tangy! We all agreed that we could eat it with a spoon alone and that it was probably the best thing we ate that night.\\n\\nJohnnycake: a corn pancake soaked in honey butter with smoked bluefish and caviar on top. A really amazing balance of sweet and salty.\\n\\nHot lobster roll: this is the most popular thing on the menu and you will see at least one on every table. They load it up with lobster and it comes with either fries or really well-dressed greens with almonds in them (which we opted for in an attempt to be somewhat healthy). Be forewarned that it is expensive but that is to be expected with a good lobster roll.\\n\\nWhole Rockport Mackerel Veracruz: this is the one dish I wouldn't recommend. It comes as a whole fish and the waiter was gracious enough to help take the bone out, as we were very intimidated by the prospect of doing it ourselves. It came dressed with veggies, potatoes, and a delicious orange-fennel salad. The only downside is that there were still those tiny bones in the fish so it was a hassle putting the fish in your mouth and then having to pick the bones out of your mouth. I had less of an issue with this than my friends did but I can understand that people don't want to do that with their food.\\n\\nOVERALL: Neptune, though touristy, was worth the hype and the wait (we would have waited the 2 hours but luckily we didn't need to). Next time I have a friend in town, this will be one of the options of places to take them."},{"name":"Scampo","address":"215 Charles St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"The food was decent; however, the service was not.

We spoke to the waiter prior to ordering food to physically get separate checks and he said no problem he will of course accommodate us.

However, this last stop it was super cold outside, thus closest wins :)\\n\\nThis is a relatively new establishment, the decor of the building is the newer, single arc design. No playground, but plenty of seating inside. And they employ the two-drive thru-lanes system. I'm not sure how well this concept really works in reality (if there's a long line, you're gonna wait, no matter what), but I personally have never had to wait too terribly long. \\n\\nI normally always get the same thing at any McDonald's: Quarter Pounder with cheese, fries and Sprite to drink. It's normally a 50/50 chance on the freshness of the food. Yeah, unfortunately a other McD's I've gotten not-so-fresh fries; the occasional stiffer bun; thats fast food for ya, folks. Can't recall anything worth noting here, though. \\n\\nBut the staff here, in the few times I've stopped in, have made the experience pleasant.

The bigger dishes are okay, but so far, I haven't had one that was as flavorful as the appetizers. They seem to be out of ingredients for one or more of them every time I attempt to order one, as well. I would give 4 stars but we had kind of a strange experience. They never called or texted us when our table was ready, so we were made to wait an additional 30 minutes on top of the 45 minutes that it took for a table to become available (this was on a Tuesday evening). The waiter was also very awkward and did not once make eye contact with me, which did not resonate well with me.

Our wait staff was wonderful, both gals were very polite and knowledgeable. Two friends and I ordered the chili oil wontons, the kimchi dumplings, and the adobo bowl to share. I got the Butterfly pea flower lemonade as well, which was delicious and so pretty (not too sweet which I appreciated.) When our food came out I really thought I had gone to heaven. The plating and presentation were beautiful, but the flavor of the dishes is by far the star here. After five years of exploring different meat alternatives, Ichiza ended the search. Best faux meat I have ever consumed. Hands down, that's it, no contest. Taste, texture, everything was on point. The adobo definitely our favorite, my best friend almost got a bit testy eyed because of how it reminded her of her grandmother's cooking. At the end of the meal I asked our waitress about their meat substitute because I was curious and she was kind enough to give me all of the info to order it on my own! I am SO glad we came in!

Tasty n Alder's menu definitely offers me that freedom and variety to amuse my palate.\\n\\nFrom their small plate menu, we ordered radicchio with lardons, manchego, chopped six minute egg, classic steak tartare and foie gras.  We also ordered a cheese board so we could try out different cheeses.\\n\\nFoie gras came first since the flavor was so delicate.  It was pan seared over brioche, with pineapple chutney.  Pan searing has to be my favorite way of eating foie gras because it's simple, it preserves the flavor of a good foie gras, and you can taste the buttery richness without so much of the irony organ taste.  However, I did not like the pineapple chutney as much.  I find pineapple's flavor a bit overpowering, almost too much sweetness so the dish started to taste sticky in my mouth towards the end.\\n\\nI loved the radicchio salad with lardons (chunky fried bacon), manchego and chopped six minute egg.  The creaminess of the egg cut the bitter radicchio, and I loved the textural variation this dish offers.  The lardon was a little too salty for me but it went well with a large bite of radicchio & eggs.  A small portion is enough to share between two people, for sure.\\n\\nThe highlight of the night, for me, was the beef tartare.  I didn't get a chance to eat any Asian food while I was in Portland this time and I missed it dearly.  The steak tartare was soft, fresh, and the flavor was (I think) Vietnamese-inspired.  I almost felt like I was eating pho, because after I mixed the raw egg with the beef, I wrapped it with bib lettuce and topped it with jalapeno, sprouts, fried vermicelli noodles and a drizzle of lime juice.  It was such a refreshing dish and the steak was perfectly prepared.  It was just very, very good that day that I had it - my tongue needed that refreshing touch from eating all the creamy, rich food.\\n\\nLastly we had our cheese board, which came with three cheeses: goat, cow and sheep.  It also came with a mango chutney, candied walnut, raspberries and thin crackers. \\n\\nI find this restaurant a little on the hipster side, but if you like that kind of crowd, be sure to get here early because it got pretty packed by 6 on a Sunday!"},{"name":"The Ginger Man","address":"148 State St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"I don't really write reviews of things, but I was so put off by the \\"customer service\\" I received at the Ginger Man this evening.

There was a card on the table but there was no confetti. The only surprise was that there was no surprise. I had come once on a friend's birthday and the table had a card and confetti so I was expecting that added touch. Don't they know there are so many other restaurants a person can go to to celebrate their special occasion? 2) Anyway, the menu items had changed since the last time I had been there. There was a lot of seafood and steak options. No pasta like ravioli and very little vegetarian options unless you want a salad. I ended up going with the petite filet. Call me spoiled but the steak was underwhelming when compared to Ruth's Chris. I immediately missed the sizzling, juicy, and buttery steak from Ruth's Chris. This one was lukewarm, and although it was pretty flavorful it was a chunk of meat on the plate. 3) I went to the restroom and as I was there a staff member came and was aggressively tidying up and changing the toilet paper in the stalls. Apparently I had been standing in front of a cabinet and rather than say \\"excuse me\\" and allow me to move, she bulldozed her way over, opened the cabinet doors and hit me!

The restaurant was much more well-lit from natural sunlight that it felt almost like a leisurely lunch. \\n\\nWe had a large group, so we started with two plates of the honey butter croissants. These were better than I remembered. They're light and can get a little sticky. I could easily almost have two. \\n\\nWe also had the oyster shooters which were fun. You can't shoot these like you would shots, so definitely make use of the small forks or you'll end up shooting a glop of cocktail sauce. There is a little too much cocktail sauce in these shooters and we were all left wondering, \\"Where's the salt/pepper vodka?\\" that's supposed to be in there. Still tasty though. \\n\\nI had the filet mignon salad with the house dressing. My filet mignon was already cut into generous cubes for my salad and I could see that it was cooked medium-rare just the way I like my steak. The house dressing is a bacon honey mustard that's actually very difficult to see in/on the salad, but full of flavor. Next time I'll ask for the dressing on the side. \\n\\nMost of the other people at my table ordered prime rib which comes with a salad and side. This is one of the few steakhouses I've been to that asks if you'd like raw or creamy horseradish. It's worth mentioning that you won't miss out on a honey butter croissant since one will come with a salad ordered with a steak. The entree salads don't come with a croissant. Sad face. \\n\\nService was attentive, so we all had a good time. It's a bit loud, but we're kind of a loud bunch too, so it's not the most intimate of places.

We were advised to substitute for pesto or something. My wife opted for a custom pizza that consisted of caramelized onions, pepperoni and Mac and cheese (not vegan, but she didn't mind). I chose The Bane without cheese. We waited around 30 minutes, maybe longer, for our pizza. The waitress even came over to tell us it would be out soon. The two girls next to us ordered, ate and left before we got ours. By the time our pizza came, mine was incredibly dry and my wife's incredibly wet. It might have been my fault for overlooking the fact that olive oil was listed as the 'sauce' on mine, but it seriously looked and tasted like dough with ingredients thrown on it.

When my roommate and I found out that their soft opening was happening, we got really excited and made a spontaneous trip there for an early dinner. Basically no one was there around 5:45pm on a Thursday. Service was extremely fast and friendly. The shop is very small, so don't expect to bring a large group of friends there. There is a thin bar on the side with several chairs as well as some small tables (2-4 seats each). \\n\\nThe parking lot in front is very small, so if you're coming from campus during a busy hour, I would suggest either walking (if you live more north-ish campus) or taking the bus. There are maybe about 3-4 spots, if I remember correctly. \\n\\nChicken/lamb/combo over rice was a little over $7 including tax. Now, I've had the famous 53rd and 6th chicken over rice in NYC, so I'm not sure if my standards were too high...but I wasn't too impressed with Halal Guys today. I got the lamb over rice plate. It reminded me of Chipotle, except...Middle Eastern. I guess. A big plate of rice with some meat, lettuce, tomatoes, and sauce on top. The lamb tasted more similar to Italian sausage than what I expected lamb to taste like, and the basmati rice was harder than I would have preferred. Maybe I wasn't hungry enough, maybe the chicken over rice is better, maybe the shop will get better after the grand opening on Monday?\\n\\nBottom line: I'm probably at a 3.5, but I'll bump it up to 4 since it is a new establishment.

Their hours of operation are convenient too.

They were stacked out there so thick the last time I was there that I opted not to take a photo of the outside of the restaurant.

The salsa was made from roasted ingredients which gives this dish a smoky flavor and not to hot and not to mild flavorings... My husband and I shared a plate of 3 enchiladas, One was ground beef and the other 2 were chicken... We found the ground beef to be just slightly better in taste... and they dip the tortillas in the enchilada sauce like traditional Mexican style cuisine.. The beans that came with lunch was not all mushy like other restaurants we have tried, There were firm beans...Once again making from scratch... the Mexican rice was not hard & crispy. It was moist... the only drawbacks for the rice was it needed just a hint of spice and salt... and there was only one waitress which we were given great service but, when the next people to arrived we did not get that great of service. Once lunch was over, the waitress gave us our bill, and we had to wait at least 5 minutes for her to return to our table to process our American Express credit card so that I could get back to work on time. Too slow of service for only 2 tables, and lack of salt in the rice is why we gave a 4 out of 5 stars. But we will be back next week to try a different dish.

But if I'm going by star definition alone, this place is most definitely a 'Meh.  I've experienced better.'\\n\\nHere are the factors that led to my decision:\\n\\nOther reviews and their FB page would lead one to believe that they have a DJ here on Friday nights playing salsa, etc.  So I emailed a group of friends to get them here for pre-dancing dancing and dinner.  When I called the restaurant to confirm they told me that the DJ was received with mixed reviews last week so they were changing it to an every other week format.  The owner was even nice enough to tell me she'd call the DJ and see what she could do.  No luck with getting him to come in, BUT we could bring our own CD's and they'd gladly play them for us.  Big thumbs up for customer service. \\n\\nI was also concerned about splitting the bill (because this can always turn into a sticky situation at the end of the night).  But the waitress took great care to ask everyone's name and keep separate totals.  Again, big plus for the customer service here. \\n\\nThe not so good side, and why I went with only two stars:\\n\\nOur appetizer of tostones cost $4.  The plate consisted of 5 thick rounds of plantains that were mashed then fried.  They were too thick for my liking which made the end result rather rubbery.  And the magic sauce that came with them- an exotic blend of mayo and ketchup.  So not worth the $4.\\n\\nAnd remember the part about keeping separate tabs?  Well, that was great until it came time to getting our food.  The people who ordered first got their food first.  And this was about twenty minutes after placing the initial order.  Then about 5-10 minutes later came our food (we were second to order).  And so on until the sixth person got their food.  By that point, the people who had received their food first were already done with their meal.  So glad no one expected anyone to be polite and wait til everyone had been served. \\n\\nI realize this review is getting to be on the long side, but I can't stop without giving you the deets on the plates themselves:\\n\\nThe tilapia that's covered in some sort of seed then fried was supposed to come with a mango/avacado salsa.  It didn't.  And when my friend asked for it, the waitress was confused and asked her if she wanted a separate side of avocado.  My friend let her know it was supposed to come with the dish.  The waitress ran back to the kitchen and returned with the missing salsa. \\n\\nMy Mofongo and carne frita (fried meat), consisted of mashed plantains cooked with garlic and pork rinds, a bowl of chicken and yucca broth to pour over the plantains so as to soften them, and fried chunks of pork.  The pork was overcooked and quite tough and not anything special in the flavor department.  \\n\\nThe bf's bistec encebollado (beef and onions) had the chewy consistency of boiled meat.  And the steamed veggies that came with it were pretty cold.  \\n\\nThe arroz con pollo was on special for $6, and it came with two sides.  Sounded like a great deal, but it arrived with way more arroz than pollo, so I guess you get what you pay for. \\n\\nI liked the taste of the Fricase de Pollo, but again, it was all dark meat so I didn't think the price was justified, especially when you have to pay extra for your sides. \\n\\nAnother friend ordered a cuban sandwich, that thing was huge and he gave it the thumbs up.  \\n\\nPlating for everything was rather unremarkable.  But the thing that really bummed me out was their lack of dessert.  The restaurant had two printed on the menu:  tres leches and flan.  I'd read great things about the flan.  I ordered it, they were out.  No tres leches either.  The one dessert that they did have could not be described by the waitress.  So the cook had to come out and list the ingredients to us.  Maybe a sample would have enticed us to actually order a serving, but the mystery decription left us dubious and ultimately dessertless.  \\n\\nThe bf asked for the check and the waitress brought back our bill, but no one else's.  So he had to go back and tell her that we ALL wanted our bill.  Seems odd that she wouldn't assume that or at least ask. \\n\\nSo, after two hours of slow but perhaps well-intentioned service and less than stellar food that cost more than it was worth, I was left feeling sheepish for dragging all my friends out to this place.\\n\\nPS\\nThis review went on for entirely too long.

So here goes : We got the calamari that was barely cooked at all and was not edible. We ordered entrees and waited 2 HOURS for them before I asked the manager to please cancel them as we were still waiting. He said please hold on and walked away without asking what the issue is and never came back to the table over the next 20 minutes before I left . He then sent the waitress over(who was incredibly nice) who then apologized and didn't charge us for the drinks. To me, for the manager not to ask for feedback or even have enough decency to walk back over to discuss why we cancelled the entrees, is completely unacceptable. After he left our table, he leaned up against the wall for the next 15 minutes laughing with the other manager and doing nothing to help the waitress out, or check with the kitchen to figure out the problem. This was the worst customer service I've ever experienced by a restaurant manager. Being a brand new restaurant, I  am more than understanding that issues will happen. However, for management to not care about the customer experience is beyond frustrating. If he jus asked why we wanted to cancel the food and apologized, I would give them a second chance without a doubt.

But, we were grateful to escape the noise and the wait. The food was excellent. I had the chicken & waffles. The waffle was so fluffy, yet dense, and truly delicious. Unfortunately, the Brandy sauce that they offer in place of syrup is terribly, TERRIBLY bitter. My husband tasted it and agreed. Our server even commented that they should get regular syrup, since everyone asks for it. Hint. Hint! I opted to reheat the waffles at home the next morning because that brandy sauce was not edible.

When we finally sat down, our sweet server was quick to offer up recommendations on food and drinks and I was convinced to try the Combo Platter that provided a taste of the Jambalaya, Crawfish Pie, and Chicken File Gumbo. My roommate ordered the Southern Drippin' Chicken Sandwich and his girlfriend stuck to a liquid diet of the Hurricane Signature Drink. My combo platter was perfect, with each item having their own taste and refreshing flavors. I recommend this dish for anyone who's unfamiliar with New Orlean-ian (New Orleanish?) cuisine but isn't afraid to try something different. The Chicken Sandwich looked (and by the sounds my roommate made) absolutely scrumptious and lived up to it's drippin' name. His toast was just barely overdone but enough to be noticed by our server and a restaurant manager who quickly brought out a new slice and unnecessarily comped his meal.

That's how hard they roll. Get it? Roll? God I love typing. Also, the waitresses are young hott Asian chicks. I would totally do the entire waitstaff. Not the chefs, but they could watch and prepare sashimi for when we get tired or hungry or want to incorporate food into our lovemaking. And I guess there's a cop and a magician, but I think they were just there to use the bathroom. Nice bathrooms, btw. \\n\\nNow I don't know a damn thing about sushi or Japan or culture or food or really anything, but HOLY AWESOME I mean the food here is just killer. I ate crabs, eels, sushis, fishes, fruits, marshmallows on a stick that I held under a goddamn chocolate fountain while thinking lewd thoughts about the 16-year-old looking waitress who was probably 27 or 28 but have you ever noticed how Asian girls just remain hot forever until they're like 50? Talk about winning the genetic lottery. They're a little obsessed with filling up your water glass and interviewing you about the food you're eating, which is decent customer service but I think maybe where they come from people have conversations over dinner instead of just stuffing their stupid, fat faces like we do here. Since I was already fantasizing about sleeping with our server I decided that in the middle of our passion she would ask me \\"You want more water?\\" and I would be like \\"Yes, I actually do!\\" I also bet that when they run off to get the water pitcher is a good time to bolt without paying.\\n\\nTip: I figured this out after plate number seven - it's all you can eat, and it's expensive-ish, but if you REALLY want to get your money's worth you should get up after you're full and go run around the building a few times until you throw up (there's a McDonald's right there so I'm sure there's always a good amount of puke) and then you can go back and stuff your stupid, fat face full of more crabs and lobsters and shrimps and ducks and mussels and cheesecake and watermelon and miso soup (which is only so-so, but I was disappointed only until I realized I could call it \\"mi-so-so\\", and anytime I can coin a phrase I'm stoked). \\n\\nThere is a lazer show on the ceiling too, and futuristic Japanese music plays constantly, which is totally awesome and adds to the atmosphere. Also there are rope lights under the edges of the buffet table that change colors which also adds to the atmosphere. And there is a manager-type guy who also makes a circuit through the tables and asks you how your food is, and it adds to the atmosphere but at this point I was just giving these people the thumbs-up because there is only so much time for lunch.\\n\\nLoved it, would definitely recommend to all my friends or my enemies with seafood allergies."},{"name":"Jake's Ice Creams & Sorbets","address":"660 Irwin St","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3.5","text":"I don't know if the question is how is this place in business or WHY ?

I reached out to Paddlefish to see if we could make this experience a little extra special as we were there to celebrate our 5th anniversary. Kate, answered my email and was so attentive and wonderful to work with. She walked me through a couple of steps in booking our reservation and she went to great lengths to learn about my wife and I and make this truly a special occasion. She hand picked our server Tony who knew the menu inside out and backwards. He was absolutely delightful to have with his great enthusiasm, charisma and professionalism. We could not have asked for a better server. \\n\\nNext up was the food! Wow, we got the lobster guacamole (on the house, thank you again Kate and Tony). We also got the calamari which is a favorite of my wife's. Next up, were our entrees which were delicious! I got the shrimp and grits while my wife got the linguine with clams. Both were spectacular, full of flavor and fresh as always. My wife's parents got a shared seafood boil that they both were still talking about weeks later.  Finally, Paddlefish was so kind to bring out a personalized dessert that was so thoughtful and kind of them.\\n\\nUltimately, this went way beyond any of our expectations. We got married here because of the wonderful location and theming but we will continue to come back because of the quality of service and food which is second to none on Disney property.

I called at 7:12pm and spoke to a very very rude girl that had little care to answer my question. I'm here for one night and one night only and being that it's my first time in Boston I wanted to try a lobster roll. Since I am breaking my Keto Diet, I wanted to make sure it was worth it. She called herself Jenny \\"the manager\\".. she sounds very young and I highly doubt she gave me the right name..\\n\\nShe seemed annoyed and careless to answer my questions properly. I've been reading reviews on Pauli's, Lobstah On A Roll and Neptune's and it's really hard to decide which place to eat. I wasn't sure about Neptune's because I also wanted clam chowder but not from Neptune's because it looks so watered down..(just not my preference).. but I was going to go elsewhere for chowder and drop in here for a roll..I asked how many ounces the lobster was and how much the roll was (mkt price) to see if it's worth the 30 min walk. she said $31 and they don't go by ounces. I said so you're saying you charge $31 for a small sandwich (according to reviews) and you don't know how much meat? So you just eye ball it? She became rude and lacks good customer service and phone skills. She was trying to rush me off the phone..and once I asked her name and said I want to speak to a manager she acted like she couldn't hear me and hung up. I called back and she said her name was Jenny  \\"the manager\\" which I find very hard to believe because the first time she didn't want to tell me her name..well you lost a customer and customers are what keep you in business. Being flight crew, we visit many cities and share the best places to eat among our crews..this was a fail and I didn't even get to the food! If you're going to answer the phone, be professional and have a little knowledge of your menu items. If you don't know the answer, put me on hold and ask!

I most recently ordered an OG bol which is supposed to be acai based, but the bol tasted like banana. It was like watery banana lol. Which is not what I expected, as a person who ia a smoothie bowl and acai enthusiast! Rather than the toppings being finely chopped, they were mediocrely sliced which left me with large pieces of strawberry that dominated the bol. They seemed short staffed on both occurrences. This was apparent in the  shortness and lack of compassion in the person taking orders. \\n\\nOne thing that was positive was the atmosphere is clean and bright. And the young man making my order, seemed happy to be there. \\n\\nOverall, I am writing this review because I don't think at this time their $11 bols are worth the time or money.

Running out of time in Portland, I hit the midday menu on a Thursday and loved everything so much, I wanted to keep eating despite being full and having a scheduled run just a few hours later. I ordered a local rhubarb lager on tap and opted for the fries and lamb skewers, figuring that's where I would stop. \\n\\nThe fries were cooked in waygu fat, providing incredible flavor the likes of which I've never experienced. These fries are probably worthy of entering my top 5. (Hint: I like fries). \\n\\nThe lamb skewers weren't chunks of lamb as I expected, but rather seared ground lamb. And they were seared to perfection, having that nice crunch on the exterior, yet not overcooked or dry in the middle. The lamb, combined with the cucumber, onion and tzatziki sauce (I think), was a pretty standard, yet delicious combination. \\n\\nNot really needing anything more to eat, I finished with the Ghanaian fried chicken, which was unnecessary but worth forcing down. I couldn't tell whether the breading or the dipping sauce brought the kick, or both, but I left a happy customer.\\n\\nDuring my hour or less pit stop here, I probably had 4 different people wait on me. This is very much a team player kind of environment and everybody was pleasant, or at least did a really good job pretending. \\n\\nThe mid-day menu (2:00-5:30 daily) is the way to go.

We were seated quickly, it was not busy whatsoever. We ordered our drinks and our meals. There were 3 of us. Our waitress was amazing. She was very sweet and kind. She did take a little while to get to us to order drinks but immediately apologized and explained that she has been having issues with the kitchen which I 100% believe. I have no complaints about our waitress.\\nThe issue was we were seated at about 9pm. I got my food at 9:50pm. My family got their food a solid 20-25 minutes before I did. They had finished their meals and still didn't have mine so we all waited \\nThe waitress was very apologetic and I recognize that this was not her fault at all. I asked to see a manager about the wait time. The manager came with my food. He was kind however only said sorry. I asked if he would please reduce the price of my meal considering the fact that my entire family had finished before I even got my food. He agreed. However when I got the bill he had only taken off a drink. I appreciate this however I didn't think it was a fair compensation. I spoke to him again and expressed this and he was very kind and took 50% off of my meal. I suppose this restaurant deserves one star for that reason, otherwise this is the worst place I've ever eaten at or reviewed in terms of service.\\nWe also never got the waters we asked for and my family's food was served room temperature. These were  things we could have overlooked if my meal didn't take 50 mins to get to me. \\nI have a huge feeling this is a common occurrence. While speaking to the manager a waitress came up to him and informed him another table wanted to speak to him after us. Our waitress also told us that unfortunately this is how the restaurant is usually run. I think this store gets away with such horrible service (I mean it only has two stars on here) because it's on a very busy road. The locals don't come back but the tourists don't know better.

The first stop on our journey was Pine State Biscuits. We had a large party, so we weren't sure what to expect. Upon arriving, we were greeted with a line out the door. This is a good sign.\\n\\nOnce we got close enough to see the menu, the choices became really hard. Everything sounded delicious and unique. I decided on the Chatfield made spicy and a blueberry basil pop-tart. It was practically brunch, so I also had a beer. I'm on vacation, I'll do as I please. \\n\\nThe Chatfield was huge and dripping with apple butter and the buffalo sauce that is used to make it spicy. After I cut the first bite off, I was blown away. It was absolutely incredible. All the unique flavors blended together in a way I wouldn't have expected. The blueberry basil pop-tart may have been even better though. It had a marshmallowesque frosting on top and never seemed to cool. Everyone I was will seem to get something else, so I was also able to try a few other items. Most noteworthy would be the cheesy gravy Cajun fries.

I was REALLY looking forward to the soup but found it to be disappointing, especially at $16. The only thing I REALLY enjoyed about the soup was the chicken. The \\"chicken\\" tasted incredible! However, the broth was very watered down and the noodles were impossible to eat with the chop sticks given and kept falling apart as if they were over cooked. Finally, the only catch with the intimate setting was the fact that you are in essence inside the kitchen. On multiple occasions the restaurant was smokey and it appeared they had either burned chili oil or used a significant amount as people were coughing  from the burning smoke.

Rather, we just took the time to sip on a few drinks and recharge.\\n\\nTo drink: my boyfriend had their sangria which he thoroughly enjoyed. I'm not as big of a red sangria fan as I am a white, but this was tall and refreshing. While he stayed steady with his sangria, I tried three different drinks at the recommendation of the bartender. The first was their Skinny Watermelon Martini which was absolutely perfect and not too strong. Being from GA, there's very little that watermelon can't make better on a hot sunny day. Next up, their Cucumber Lime Martini. Also amazingly light and refreshing. It had a nice kick to it as well, which broke up the sweetness of the watermelon selection. To finish, I had a standard margarita on the rocks with salt which I would highly recommend with your favorite tequila. They have a long list of tequilas and I was happy to see my favorite available (Espolon). This margarita was as good as they come. That's right folks - I went in for a frozen margarita and managed to have a variety of other concoctions. No regrets. Not even a little.\\n\\nFood: We were served their house chips and salsa which were both fine. Not mind blowing but certainly good enough. We ordered a small guacamole which was super, super fresh and had a great balance of flavors. I would HIGHLY recommend it. We also ordered their Chile con Queso with venison sausage which was my least favorite of the offerings. My boyfriend enjoyed it but did mention it could have been warmer (for better consistency).\\n\\nService: we sat at the bar and the service was perfect.

I was recommended to visit by several friends, and I can really see why they love it. Biscuits. Even if you're not a fan, I think you'll find that the mouthwatering aroma of the biscuits cooked in the oven will make you reconsider. \\n\\nThis location of Pine State is located in the Alberta Arts District in Northeast Portland. Quite a hipster place that reminds me of SF, especially with that juice caravan parked next to the restaurant. Parking is street only, but it seems like people come and go fairly often. And if you don't mind walking, it's not too bad. The interior of the establishment kinda screams \\"Portland\\" to me. Like if I had to image a restaurant in Portland, this is probably what I would envision. Very down-to-earth, low-key vibe with wooden d√©cor and a big chalkboard stating the menu. Wooden tables, a bar area, nice looking greenery decorating the place. And I really like that open kitchen area where you can watch the chefs hammering out order after order. The restaurant isn't that big. There are a good number of tables inside and outside, but most people often end up sharing the larger tables because this is the type of food you'll want to savor while you eat. You wait in line before you order, then find a seat. I think you get a buzzer that notifies you when your food arrives - or maybe they bring it to you. That part was a blur. All I remember was the food in front of me as I took it all in. \\n\\nThe menu - while it's not too complicated - actually has a good number of items on there. Primarily most of the items center around the biscuit. You can build your own, order a sandwich, get some specialty order, order biscuits by themselves or with gravy, or order sides/fries/sweets. And they have drinks and cocktails as well! We of course ordered way too much food. \\n\\nWe built our own pulled pork biscuit for $4 and built another one with egg, cheese, and sausage for a set price as this was apparently a sandwich. The pulled pork biscuit was everybody's least favorite because the sandwich was super dry and tasteless. The biscuits were not too bad, but with that pulled pork - eh, nobody really wanted to eat it. \\n\\nThe egg, cheese, and sausage on a biscuit was pretty good. It reminded me of an Egg McMuffin - only tastier. I liked the melted cheese and the fact that the sausage wasn't too salty. The crumbliness of the biscuits went well with the meat, cheese, and egg. And the egg yolk oozing out after biting into it - that definitely went well with the biscuit. \\n\\nReggie Deluxe: $10.5 this was the sandwich everybody said to order, and I can see why! It has fried chicken, bacon, cheese, egg, and choice of gravy (although we didn't get an option to choose). All nestled in-between a freshly baked biscuit. I think I enjoyed this the most because the gravy provided additional texture and softness that meshed well with the egg yolk. After having disappointing fried chicken at Screen Door, I was super ecstatic to find that this fried chicken was what I was hoping for and more. Tasty, juicy, and nicely fried. The whole sandwich became too hard to eat, so we ended up cutting into it and eating it with a fork. Loved this! \\n\\nI wanted to order the Hash Ups, but I knew it would be too heavy. Instead we ordered the hash browns by themselves for $3. Worth it - a plate of perfectly fried, delightfully golden brown hash that was super crispy and not too salty. I can see why people would love the Hash Ups! \\n\\nSide Salad $3 - not sure why my sister wanted this, but it was not worth the $3. You get some mixed greens and pickled radishes with a side of vinaigrette. These greens aren't typically what you want in a salad - maybe something that garnishes another dish? Would not recommend at all. \\n\\nAnd a small side of plain fries for $2. Nicely fried and I could taste the freshness of the potatoes. But I wouldn't order this if it were up to me - only because I'd rather get another biscuit or hash browns. \\n\\nWhile the line was out the door, the wait wasn't too bad. We were probably in line for less than 30 minutes. There weren't any seats inside the restaurant, so we sat outside. Unfortunately there were a ton of bees around and the sun was super hot - making it hard to enjoy our meal to its full extent. Workers are friendly. All utensils, sauces, etc. are self-serve. \\n\\ntl;dr - HIGHLY recommend Pine State Biscuits if you're in Portland. I loved the Reggie Deluxe as well as the hash browns. I'd try the Hash Ups or just some plain biscuits with their jams and apple butter. I really wanted some apple butter with biscuits, but we already had so much food. If you're a fan of brunch, ooey-gooey egg yolks, and delicious food, I think you'll love Pine State Biscuits."},{"name":"Brothers Taverna","address":"283 Derby St","city":"Salem","stars":"3.5","text":"My friends and I came to Salem for a girls weekend.

So, I went there to get a lobster roll because I'd never had one before. All I can say is pure nirvana, bliss, paradise, and all that other good stuff! I started with the Luke Trio... Which was a lobster roll, shrimp roll, and crab roll! They were served on this little buttery roll with this delicious seasoning... My first bite into the lobster roll brought tears to my eyes!!! It was AMAZING!!!! The crab and shrimp rolls were good too but not as good as the lobster roll.... It was sooo good I went back and ordered a jumbo roll with an extra buttered roll!!! Mmmmm!!!! It was orgasmic!!!! If you're a true foodie, then you know what I'm talking about! I dreamt of it and can still taste that tender, flaky, sweet, juicy, and fresh lobster!!!! Oh me oh my!!!! Now don't expect to pay imitation crab prices.... The Trio was like $24 dollars with a drink and side! The jumbo lobster roll was around $28. I'd pay it any day if it insured I was getting fresh seafood! I must say writing this review makes me want to fly back just for another two or three more bites of the lobster roll!!! You have got to go there when you visit!!! I even recommended it to the TSA agent at the airport!!! Yummy!!! Yummy!!!

I love Thai food but I usually stick to noodle dishes so I was a little apprehensive when I didn't see any noodles on the menu. But I guess that Northern Thai food is a little different than what I'm used to. Let me just say, different in a GOOD way! I got the Moo Ping special which is two pork skewers with a side of sticky rice and also the mango with sticky rice for dessert! Honestly, my only disappointment with this meal was that there were only two skewers. Not because two wasn't filling or they were tiny or something, but because they were so delicious that I could have eaten like six, although I probably would have regretted it. The sticky rice came wrapped in plastic and I just took bites out of it like a roll which was neat. \\n\\nI've had this place bookmarked for a while because of the mango. I love mango so I was really interested in this dessert. It's mango slices over a bed of sticky rice with coconut milk drizzled on top. It was such an interesting mix of flavors! The milk soaks into the rice a little bit making it really sweet and the rice kind of warms up the mango from underneath. Really great dish, 10/10 recommend trying it.\\n\\nLastly, I would recommend being prepared to wait. The truck opened at noon on Friday and we got there at about 12:20 and there was already a considerable line and some larger orders ahead of us.

But this is a solid five-star place because it's that rare famous restaurant with food to back up its reputation. Yes, it's tiny and crowded and the wait can be long. So what? I defy you to find tastier seafood anywhere. Besides, there are dozens of great little bars and restaurants to hang your hat while you wait for the server to call you when your table is ready. Is that really so difficult? I'd wait for hours in a rainy gutter for another warm lobster roll. The raw bar is great, too.

However, the 'Chicken' was rather sparse, and took the form of bits and crumbs of fried chicken tenders- with more 'fried' than chicken- it tasted more like a lettuce spring roll.  Score: 2.5\\n\\n2) Vermicelli with grilled shrimp- The grilled shrimp was flavored very well, though they weren't exactly fresh.  This dish lives and dies by the sauce you pour over it to flavor it.  If you don't pour enough, it tastes bland- if you pour too much, you get overly sweet noodle soupiness.  My wife was looking for something hot- but this came out a bit lukewarm.  Expected, but still. Score: 3\\n\\n3) Fragrant rice with pork, pickled vegetables, and short ribs- This dish was pretty good- again, you've got to be careful how much/little sauce you pour over the rice.  I have to say however that their rendition of short ribs was AWESOME.  They were thinly-cut (which makes chewing a lot easier), with rich sweet flavor, with a slightly peppery kick!   Honestly, I wouldn't mind if Korean BBQ joints picked up on this and made it a flavoring option for their kalbi.  Score for short ribs- 4.5 Score for the rest- 3.5\\n\\nYes, I know the sum of the scores don't average out to a 4, but I think this place is worth coming back to every now and then.

Pizzas are cooked in less than two minutes in brick ovens capable of burning at 1000 degrees. This is why they're able to churn out pizzas so quickly. Expect some char on the crust--it isn't burnt. I shake my head everytime I see a negative review with \\"photo evidence\\" that the crust is burnt because it has black spots on the crust. \\n\\nIf you're expecting a New York style pizza, you'll probably be disappointed. If you prefer Chicago style pizza, you'll probably be underwhelmed. If you've only had Pizza Hut, Domino's, Papa John's, or Little Caesar's, then you'll most likely think Antico is overpriced and needs more cheese and toppings. \\n\\nHowever, if you've ever had Tony's Pizza Napoletana in San Franciso, or any Pizzeria from Italy, you might enjoy Antico. It is in my opinion, very darn close to an authentic pizza from Europe."},{"name":"Neptune Oyster","address":"63 Salem St","city":"Boston","stars":"4.5","text":"The food is absolutely amazing, the service not at all. \\n\\nThey had one person be the host and waitress which results in waiting a long time to put in an order.

Are experiences were mixed, thus the 3 star rating.\\n\\nFirst the dinner on a Friday night:\\nWe were promptly seated at a nice table for for 4, despite just being 2 diners which was nice.  The on line reservation that I tried to make earlier in the week for 6:30 nor 7PM was denied due to availability, yet the restaurant was not full until 7PM.  Note that you may want to call Scampo directly as your date approaches for cancellations or in the event they are just holding tables to spread out the crowds.  \\n\\nOut waiter was excellent as he was courteous, knowledgeable of the menu, at tentative (without being over bearing) and personable.  In fact he noticed that one of our signature beverages was not consumed and asked if he could get a more suitable replacement which is top notch service.\\n\\nThe menu is essentially Italian inspired comfort food.  We sampled many items on the menu from the elephant ears (a crispy pita bread type pizza) along with an arugula salad and a Caesar salad.  Both salads were well portioned and tasty.  For main dishes we ordered a half portions of spaghetti; cheese and pepper and carbonara.  Personally I preferred the more simple cheese and pepper as the carbonara was a little too rich and filling after the appetizers.  I was somewhat disappointed at the dessert choices so we passed other than an after dinner cocktail and double espresso.\\n\\nAs another positive note, Lydia Shire herself was in the house and visited our table.  We have dined at Scampo previously, but this was the first time making her acquaintance.  \\n\\nSecond was Sunday Brunch:\\nI have heard much about the brunch at Scampo and was really looking forward to it.  Unfortunately, we were a little disappointed in the experience from the service to the menu.  Repeatedly I needed to ask for coffee refills (the cup is small, not a mug) and the waiter also forgot to bring a Diet Coke that was ordered.  \\n\\nWe started with the bourbon glazed donuts which were very potent.  I would have been completely happy with a plain glazed donut or with the bacon & bourbon glaze on the side for dipping vs. the drenched donuts.\\n\\nFor main courses I was surprised at the lack of breakfast options.  The blueberry pancakes were the closest to pure breakfast and didn't disappoint with large, fluffy cakes served with warm maple syrup and blueberries.  The chicken and waffles were served with bananas in a bourbon sauce which took away from the rest of the dish.  I guess I would have preferred an omelette station or even french toast over the multiple eggs Benedict options.  \\n\\nAll in all Scampo is worth it if you are staying at the hotel or going to an event at the TD Garden, otherwise I wouldn't put this on your destination for a simple night out on the town given the other options available."},{"name":"The Thurman Cafe","address":"183 Thurman Ave","city":"Columbus","stars":"4","text":"Love love this place.Its so authentic Columbus.

This was one of them.  Virginia Highlands is such a sweet little area, and Murphy's was cooking up something good... We were planning on just grabbing a quick bite at Yeah Burger but whatever was steaming its way out of the kitchen had me making a beeline to Murphy's like Toucan Sam.  I quickly browsed the menu and zeroed in on the shrimp and grits.  Call it nostalgia, but I've been ordering shrimp and grits here in San Diego for weeks on end prior to my trip back to the southeast.  I liked the spice and flavor attitude of their almost ratatouille style tomato sauce with andouille sausage, and the grits were grits that only the South can do.  I do have to say that these were not necessarily THE freshest shrimp I've ever eaten, but they were okay, and the rest of the dish made up for it.  I also ordered the grilled artichokes as an appetizer, and mamma mia, these were awesome!!!  I will definitely try to make this one at home... never thought to put marjoram in with my artichokes!  The lemon aioli was a nice pairing... I probably could have gone through an extra sauce dish or two of it.  My friends got the mango chicken salad and guiness braised beef brisket.  I didn't try the mango chicken salad, but my friend seemed to have thoroughly enjoyed his dish.  I tasted the beef brisket, and it was good- very tender, and mildly seasoned.  I even enjoyed the bread they served us-- there was a nice little variety to choose from, and I had something that appeared to be a soft sundried tomato breadstick, which was yummy.  The olive oil that they served with the bread was very nice, with a very clear, clean taste and smell.  \\n\\nService was absolutely wonderful-- our waitress must have been one of the warmest, sweetest people on the planet.  Just seeing the staff interact with one another, I felt like they really enjoyed their work environment, which is always nice to see in any place of business, and somehow it added to the appeal of their product.

There were so many layers of flavor and texture every bite had something new, but it all went together so well.

Seriously, its that good.\\n\\nSecond course:\\n-Chicken-fried trout, gribiche, fines herbes, radishes and pickled carrots \\n-Roasted pork shoulder with sherried onions, crispy egg and Dijon vinaigrette\\n\\n-I did not expect to like the trout, but wow... really amazing. It comes with an awesome pickled salad on top of an entire fried trout, and it has butter lettuce cups on the side giving it a French/Asian-fusion flare, and the tastes was out of this world good. So many flavor layers and textures, I can absolutely see myself coming back to order this another time.\\n-The pork was good, and if you aren't into fish you won't be disappointed with this dish. I did find that it was a little one note flavor wise. There wasn't really anything bright and fresh on the dish, so it fell a little flat for me.

For $21, it's definitely not cheap, but at least it had a generous helping of lobster. I haven't had too many lobster rolls so I can't really compare Luke's to other places, but I enjoyed it. The poppy seed slaw was fresh and I liked how it wasn't the mayo kind. For the drink, you can choose anything from their fridge and I opted for what I believe is one of their own specially made lemonades. Looked good, but the taste wasn't quite what I was expecting.

We arrived just before opening at 9 and joined the line outside on a crisp cold day, judging that the whole line would get seated in the first seating. The door opened and one couple were admitted. The door was then closed. The rest of the line was left outside in the cold. The host then took 3 minutes to explain the restaurant concept to the first couple and handed them to a waitress for seating. Then another group was allowed to enter, the door closed in the face of the next people, and the 3 minute spiel given again. This continued for 15 minutes before we crashed in behind another couple when the host stepped away for a moment. We were then told that it wouldn't speed things up because they were spacing for the kitchen. We pointed out it was cold outside and they were inconveniencing customers for the benefit of the kitchen. The response was 'at least it's not raining' and 'I don't make the rules'. \\n\\nEverybody in that line would be far happier sitting at a table in the warm waiting for food and drinking coffee than being forced to wait outside in the cold! It is now 9:30 - 30 minutes after opening, and the restaurant is still not full even though there is a line outside. We understand that if the whole restaurant is sat at the same time the kitchen will take a while to get food out to everybody. We don't understand why we're having the door shut in our face and being told to wait outside in the cold for 30 minutes! \\n\\nThis not only created cold upset customers, it also created tension for the host and the guests and the normal chatter of the wait staff explaining the menu to new comers was not had.

We ordered the wontons, shrimp rice noodles, a set of 3 taiwanese rabbit molded rice cake meatballs and some turnip cakes. The presentation was amazing, but the food not so much. Turnip cake was very cakey and dense; the rice cake meatballs was prepared to perfect texture, but consisted of 90% rice cake and 20% meatball, when it should be the other way around; this made the dish very carby. shrimp rice noodles lacked flavor. Our favorite dish was the spicy wontons, which I'm glad we shared. The first one was yummy, but after the 2nd or 3rd one, the garlic overload kicked in.

We definitely didn't need to eat again that day.\\n\\nMy Reggie Deluxe was all kinds of tasty. The biscuit was buttery and thick. The breading on the fried chicken was very tasty and well seasoned. The bacon was thick and of course you can't go wrong with cheese and eggs. The sausage gravy was some of the best sausage gravy I've ever had. I would definitely add extra gravy if I visited again. I also added a side of pimento cheese and it was okay, but not the best I've had. \\n\\nThe Cinnamon Roll was huge and smothered in liquid caramel topping. It was amazing. The roll was good, but the caramel was the best part by far. \\n\\nMenu options are definitely a good value since they are all very hearty. I'd definitely recommend getting here now if you like biscuits and sausage gravy.

The bread was the first thing that arrived at the table and it was crunchy on the outside and moist - custardy - on the inside... omfg so good... warm, melted butter om nom nom. The bread is outrageous. Noise be damned - bring your future wife here and scream at each other about how delicious the bread and butter is. Maybe years from now when you're miserable and screaming about how burnt, bland and rubbery her home cooked steak is, it will trigger a memory of happier, hornier days and warm, delicious, buttery bread. \\n\\nSigh... leave it to a goof from a place called New Britain to refer to Southie as \\"one of Boston's crappier neighborhoods\\" and then complain that he got turned away from Lincoln fifteen minutes before closing, while he was trying to get to his drunk friends inside - which creates a reasonable assumption that he was drunk as well. Strangely, this clown boasts about wearing cargo shorts, a ripped t-shirt and a crummy running jacket to this fine establishment, then somehow argues that donning this crappy attire was a reason to let him back inside. Drunk. Fifteen minutes before closing. Only Yelp considers you \\"elite\\" - to the rest of us, you're a loser. Your friends secretly hate you."},{"name":"Tasty n Alder","address":"580 SW 12th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"Love this place.  \\n\\nI am always looking for good food and this place always is a staple to go to.

I would have an absolute breakdown if it ever went away. Yes because of its delicious burgers which I will strain to describe ( a opinion not shared by everyone on Yelp weirdly) but also because of memories of people and events whose ghosts haunt it dark, narrow barscape and white waiting room of hunger. The place is an experience with all its corky authenticity and fame. \\n\\nNeedless to say, this is not a place to go before a show or event. The waiting room is twice as large as its dining area, and it is highly popular; at peak times the wait can push up against two hours. Add to this the time it takes for your food to arrive and it is not meant for efficient stop and pop.  No, this place is a destination in-and-of itself, an event all to its own, and my review circa 2012 still applies: it's purgatory in wait for heaven with St Peters reading off the names of the saved from the holy 100-sheet Mead spiral bound. \\n\\nThe joint has been around since about the time Yamamoto was dropping torpedo bombs on Pearl Harbor, in the space stuffed between other greasy spoons that reminds one of the strips of midcentury small towns. Parking is off street and can be a problem on weekend nights especially after tOSU games and other tourist attractions when visitors come, egged on by Man Versus Food, to check it. Often I have to park several blocks down. That's alright though as Thurman Avenue is a safe and beautiful section of town. (The street and restaurant is both named after a native that ran for Vice President in the 19th century.) \\n\\nStrangely, the Thurman Cafe escaped my radar for much of my time in Columbus. Having been introduced to it about 12-years ago, and being a constant choice of mine for many of those years, I have had every burger here save for one: the Thurmanator--the double 12-ounce monster whose creation is due to the yearly Arnold Classic. The mountain of burger, bacon, cheeses and mushrooms are too much for this appetite, though I plan on tackling it after some random day of fasting. Of my favorites are:\\n\\nThe Jaeger Burger--steaming heap on delicious texas toast, melting French onion sour cream, and saut√©ed mushroom. I recommend it for those that have had others, but not for first timers who deserve classic burgers. \\n\\nThe Garden Burger has lots of saut√©ed peppers and onions, mushrooms and swiss cheese.\\n\\nThe Jonny Burger--a blue cheese concoction loaded with bacon and absolutely stunning horseradish cheese.\\n\\nThe Thurman Burger ( the classic formula that I suggest newbs to try) ham, saut√©ed shrooms with american cheese.   \\n\\nWhat makes this burger great to me is hard to assertion.  I remember my first bite was like a orgasmic experience, and, though I am not being literal with body function, the mental ping of sudden dopamine reward hit on that very bite. And still today, at this very trip ( I don't eat here as often as I don't want to lose the effect by familiarity) one bite and it is like heaven in the mouth. The burger, however it is tendered, or dry rubbed or what, has this very thick, even, taste of beef, or the absolute Platonian ideal of how beef should taste. And the burger does not lose this quality bite after bite. It is so good I don't mind that burger falling apart as I go. \\n\\nAdd that the fries here are best in town too. Thick cuts fried perfectly with a taste that compliments the burger. \\n\\nThe interior is divey perfection. Old signs, a million dollar bills, scuffy woodwork, under the warm glow of electric beer signs red, green, and blue. The dining area is tight on space with several booths, tables in the center, a bar, and a cubby looking out bay windows to the street. The staff are like ninjas as you don't notice them passing by in these narrow walkways.  \\n\\nIt is just my favorite place; and this is my song to it."},{"name":"Halal Bros","address":"2712 Guadalupe St","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"What a great restaurant.

Ya! I tried to eat again but I was so grossed out, who knew if there was one in my food. About 5 minutes later the waitstaff girl came back with a quizzical look searching all over the area and said, laughing, \\"you'll never believe this, when I went to throw away the napkin, it was empty.\\" Alright, NOW I REALLY could not deal with that anymore. I asked for the manager, and she said \\"no body was on charge at the moment\\". ( that was a lie!!! because the owners are always there cooking or waiting tables) and  one of the buss staff told us that our waitress was the owner and she also mentioned all about how they  DO NOT spray in a regular basis to keep the risk of pests down. Yah, that was really ruining my appetite. The waitress then asked one of the girls to box up our meal. Like I wanted it! NO THANK YOU! I had enough, so I saw   the owner walking to the kitchen and GUESS WHAT!!!! She was recycling a basket of chips back in the chip warmer!!!!!!!!!!!!I my family, friends and I leave that place so disgusting about the whole experience. Terrible service, very slow.\\nI apologize for the long winded review, but if it saves even one person to go trough the whole deal we did then it will worth it.

On the floor, I notice several groups of people sitting at the bar and in the small dining area enjoying the food, so I take it to be pretty good.

I forget the exact night but one of those is a eclectic vibe of trip hop, 80's, electronic, funk and rock all wrapped up on one. Good vibes to dance to with friends or by yourself.

We get here on a Sunday night and the place is about half full. Opening the door, the live band blasts loud and proud as we are seated promptly. \\n\\nThe atmosphere is absolutely wonderful. NOLA culture and history plastered all over the wall. From the Saints Super Bowl win to a Katrina door to some elements of voodoo. It's beautiful. You'll be looking around the entire time finding new things to look at. The band was super loud and featured a trumpet player that knew how to really play well. Our party was shouting at each other almost the whole time, the way things usually are on Bourbon Street anyway. \\n\\nWe ordered an app, the Shrimp & Alligator Cheesecake (Tibby's Specialty. All natural Gulf shrimp, alligator meat, three cheeses & Panko bread crumbs). This was an interesting dish. The thing is a big brick of meat and cheese. The meat is cooked well, though. Alligator is usually tough, but they did a good job, and the cheese is mostly cream cheese I think, but it all melded together to be a great dip for the five little toasts they give you. Honestly, two more would have been appreciated. \\n\\nI order the Jambalaya, Crawfish Pie & Chicken File Gumbo (A sampler of true Cajun dishes). And oh my God. The spice and flavor of these things made me so happy. I don't cook a lot, and the Zataran-style things they sell at the stores are just so bland for the general public. This was awesome. The crawfish pie was the star of the show with a crispy outer shell and a heaping helping of crawfish filling in the middle. Yum.\\n\\nMy girlfriend had the Fried Green Tomatoes & Crawfish Po'Boy (Covered in remoulade sauce). I want to make it very clear to you that the thing that makes a po'boy is the bread. It has to be soft, but is has to be strong enough to hold up to all the toppings. The tomatoes were obviously breaded and fried in house, the shrimp were a great size and breaded just thin enough to qualify as breaded, and the sauce was the tang that tied it all together. \\n\\nWe got the batch of seven beignets for the table, and they were perfect. Nice and warm and flaky and covered in so much powdered sugar that you need to use the tongs they supply you to get to them. It's been a while, but when I get to New Orleans I'm going straight to the Cafe du Monde to compare beignets, and I think it'll be close. \\n\\nOverall, the atmosphere and the food came together to give me the experience of my city that I have been craving for a very long time. I will be back many more times, and I wish I could say I'll be having the same thing, but there is so much more of the menu I need to tackle! I need more money.

We arrived for brunch/lunch at approximately 1:50 pm last Sunday (they close at 3)and were given a wait time of approximately 20 to 30 minutes with 5 tables in front of us. We went outside to wait for the table. My wife went back in 5 minutes later and was told by the host that because there were so many tables in front of us they may not be able to seat us at all before 2:30, and then they wouldn't be able to serve us. My wife advised the host that it was barely 2 pm and that should be plenty of time to have us seated and ordered.  The host seemed to get defensive about it.  It wasn't only that we were told this but also the manner in which she was told that there may not be a table available before closing. The host was basically saying  \\"you may want to make other plans since we will be closing soon\\" even though closing was still nearly an hour away. We decided to dine at Howell's instead, just across the way from Cultivate. From our table at Howell's I was able to see a number of tables at Cultivate empty of customers all before 2:30.  None of the tables had customers seated by the time we left Howell's. We have eaten at Cultivate before, ordering after 2 with no problem.  Also, we've never been to a restaurant that would not seat you & let your order within 30 minutes of closing.

Well tonight reassured me that I'm making the right decision to not visit here anymore.\\n\\nTrivia starts at 7:30. The lady who usually hosts trivia was replaced by someone new. The previous woman who is full of energy was superseded by a woman who was rude to my friend when she asked if she had an extra pen.\\n\\nThis week to play trivia you had to move from the bar area closer to the stage in order to hear her because she had no microphone. We opted to not even play which is the reason we initially started coming here.\\n\\nUsually the place is crowded so finding another seat would be difficult, but tonight it was DEAD. No coincidence that the Wednesday after the menu is changed the place is empty.\\n\\nOur bartender only added to our frustration. We went 40mins without being checked on. Glasses empty and waiting to place a food order....did I mention the place was DEAD!\\n\\nWe were looking for a way to spend the $40 and we decided on Nachos $10.50 with protein, Pretzels (3) $8.50, Truffle Fries $7 and Beignets $6.50. \\n\\nOur bartender said the nachos were big enough to share. What we received was a sampler size order with a few strips of carne asada(which we paid extra for) and minimal toppings. We used cheese from the pretzels on the nachos due to the lack of condiments.\\n\\nThe pretzel tasted the same just $1.50 more due to the price increase.\\n\\nThe fries and beignets took over 30mins to arrive, I mentioned this place was empty right!\\n\\nBefore we left we were given two chips for a free pint due to the wait. Had we received these after we got our food I would understand, but it wasn't until we were about to leave that we were presented with them. Between this time we had expressed our feelings on the tacos being removed and the increase on pricing to the bartender. The owner was actually sitting at the bar and overheard us. He said the Peri Peri tacos \\"may\\" make a comeback. Unfortunately, the return of Peri Peri tacos wouldn't change my decision on returning. Nothing was said about the price increase.\\n\\nWe texted a friend who's a regular on trivia nights and Sundays for the yoga events. He knew from speaking to the owner Vishal told him about the new chef, but he wasn't aware of the price increase and major overhaul of the menu. He even told us to vent our concerns with Vishal and that he will be doing the same.\\n\\nThis once was a great place to hang out. Oviedo brewing HAD good food, a good ambience and great clientele.

The interior makes you feel like you are at a modernized, clean beach shack with fresh seafood.\\n\\n~ TASTE OF MAINE: For $23, you can sample the lobster, shrimp, and crab rolls in half-sized portions with the option of a slaw/chips/soda as a side. I'm not sure why soda is an option that you have to choose from. It would make much more sense to have it as an extra add-on or just include as part of the combo. The slaw was dry in my opinion, and not really worth a side. I would've preferred chips after I got to try the slaw.\\nOf the three rolls, my favorites were the crab and shrimp. The bread is perfectly toasted with a slight crunch, but soft, and lightly buttered. The crab, shrimp, and lobster are not heavily sauced so the meat is the real highlight.\\n\\nAlthough I'm glad that there is a casual seafood option in Back Bay, I'm not sure that it WOW'd me.

They were clearly fresh shucked, as they had plenty of oyster liquor in them.\\nWe were brought fresh, homemade bread with a sweet spiced butter. The flavor was like cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves etc. It was tasty. The bread tastes like a homemade yeast bread. Not my favorite, but I had to try it.\\nOur second round of appetizers was the Ahi Poke and the Charred Octopus. The Ahi was a large portion and was served with a basket of seasoned chips. It tasted, asian, having a soy sauce flavor. The charred octopus was perfectly seasoned and tender. It was served over a bed of cannellini beans and sausage - delicious!!! Highly recommended.\\nFor dinner, we had the scallops, which were served over cauliflower puree with brussels sprouts. A fellow yelper said to ask for extra puree - we did! It came in a little ramekin at no extra charge. I had the Cioppino, which was a mix of mahi, delicious shrimp, mussels, littleneck clams, octopus, king crab legs in a tomato broth. I also asked for the dinner dish side of snow crab. The Cioppino came with three slices of grilled, chewy bread. The presentation was fun- the server lifted the top off the pot and we could see steam lifting out. We devoured our food. The side of snow crab was a bit disappointing, as it was overcooked. That made the meat inside really shrink down and therefore, it was difficult to get out of shell. I do recommend the side of snow crab over the king crab though, because the king crab in my Cioppino was so spiny and painful to crack open. It was also SUPER salty. Way too salty to enjoy. The rest of the Cioppino was great though, especially the chunks of mahi mahi and the shrimp. \\nWhen the dessert menu came, we were too stuffed to order anything. Service throughout the night was spectacular. We took our cocktails to go. \\nI recommend a reservation, as this place fills up and people were waiting when we arrived.

Very much disappointed."},{"name":"Bootleg Special","address":"400 Tremont St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"Was really pleasantly surprised at how awesome this place was. Every dish was fantastic. The decor is really unique and music fun and hip. What's even better is that the prices are so reasonable! I came with a party of 5 and I feel like we ordered so much to eat and drink and bill only came to $40/person. Would come here again and again!"},{"name":"Xiang Yu China Bistro","address":"1223 Beacon St","city":"Brookline","stars":"4","text":"This place is awesome, I just wish they would have description on the menu of each item because we ordered the Eight Treasures rice dish and it was kind of bland and disappointing. The salt and pepper shrimp made up for it though!

I am starting to doubt the quality of the reviews on yelp as the last couple of restaurants I have tried have had great reviews but the food stinks, the Olympian is one of those.\\n\\nlet's start with the Very limited parking and the fact that it's a pretty small restaurant not very comfortable but it wasn't a big deal I was there for the food anyway. \\nI thought it was a good sign that it was packed at 11:30 on a wednesday but I was mistaken. I ordered 2 eggs over medium with the Corned Beef Hash, homefries and toast.\\nThe home fries were great but the eggs were not over medium they were hardly cooked at all  but the corned beef was burnt, black on both sides and way too salty. Yes I know Corned Beef is salty but this was way over the top.\\nBetween the eggs and the corn beef I wanted to ask for my money back but the waitress seemed to be way too busy to check back on us so the service is pretty bad too and I won't even mention how unfriendly the waitress was. Not once did I hear any of the staff ask a customer how they were doing or how the meal is.\\nI understand the staff is busy but when I pay for a meal I have certain expectation and this place met none of those expectations. I won't be back."},{"name":"Abhiruchi Restaurant","address":"14603 SW Millikan Way","city":"Beaverton","stars":"4","text":"They finally re-opened at the new location and lunch buffet was out of this world!
