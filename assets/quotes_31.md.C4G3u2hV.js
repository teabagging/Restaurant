You won't easily find a pizza place that is more customizable... right down to style of crust. Whether choosing traditional white flour crust, wheat, multi grain, or veggie, they all taste delicious. They are a little bit thick and doughy, but these are not crusts you'll be tossing in the trash. \\n\\nThe red sauce is distinctively spicy and flavorful, and the cheeses are tasty and not overly greasy, with the varied toppings being of good quality as well.

Sushi was pretty good. Nabeyaki udon that I ordered was so rich in ingredients.

IT IS INCREDIBLE!\\n\\nEvery large city should have a North Market.  It was just incredible and a great place to hang on a Saturday.  This place is just filled with food vendors and restaurants and whatever you enjoy eating, you can probably find it here.  They had fresh produce, liquor, fresh desserts, (chocolate, pastries, ice cream, caramel corn and donuts), fresh seafood, poultry and game, even a jewelry booth.  No lie, these were some of the cleanest and healthiest proteins I have EVER seen.  They looked lab created and ready for a photo shoot! If you like Polish, Asia, Mexican and Mediterranean dishes, they have something for you.\\n\\n Although the place was crowded, there was plenty of seating upstairs, downstairs and outside.  Also, outside there were additional vendors selling fresh produce at ridiculously low prices.  After getting the lay of the land, we went for a walk around the shopping district and returned to purchase food to go.  My husband was very specific and went straight for the Polish and Mediterranean options while I chose to purchase nothing.  I simply wasn't hungry and much of the food looked very heavy.  I can actually appreciate food without buying it.  Also, I found myself more interested in the raw foods and ingredients as I imagined what I could do with them.    When it comes to food, I would rather spend my calories on fat than a carb.  However, it was really had to think about purchasing food on such a full stomach. \\n\\nThe next time I visit this market, it will be at the opening hour and with an empty stomach and loads of cash.  This was definitely our favorite stop in the city.\\n*** All day parking was available for just $5 and it was less than a block away.\\n***After parking you can walk down the street to the Goodale park or you can cross over to High street and do a little shopping.  It is a perfect location.  \\n***Clean bathrooms are located upstairs but they also had port-a-potties outside for your convenience.\\n\\nBe careful about what you choose, according to my husband, the gourmet ice cream was too sweet and there were no traditional flavors available.  I really dislike overly sweet ice cream and since there was no butter pecan, I passed.  We sampled the caramel corn but it was greasy and the popcorn did not taste like a quality product.\\n\\n I spoke to a lady eating one of those $3 donuts and she said that it was doughy but she really liked the topping because she likes cardamom.   Spoken like a true  three year old, who just loves to eat the frosting off of the cupcake.  Hilarious!  But seriously though, that donut looked suspiciously white (like car white) and dense which is simply not the characteristic of a donut.  I say sample as much as you can or just stick with fresh ingredients and prepare your own food.  \\n\\nIt's not just about the food, it is also about the experience so go and check it out!!  \\n\\n*** We were lucky enough to run into a food guide outside of the market and she gave us great advice about walking around the area and exploring High street.  So there!  Forget about what your mother said and go talk to some strangers!"},{"name":"Breakfast Club of Orlando","address":"63 E Pine St","city":"Orlando","stars":"3","text":"The food was good and plenty, basic service, not much to expect from the staff, at the time a gentleman in a leather jacket.

While I was waiting for the rest of our group of four to show up, I bought myself a margarita. It was definitely worth it. You could tell that the ingredients were fresh and house made; it wasn't horribly sweet or sugary. It was strong enough to let me know I got my money's worth, but not so much that the tequila overwhelmed the drink. Definitely recommend! \\n\\nMy partner and I shared a meal with the half sized chicken and two sides. It was the perfect amount of food and every part of it was incredible. The chicken was extremely moist, and the skin was a little crisp and perfectly cooked. The potatoes were so good, I couldn't stop eating them. My partner definitely didn't get her fair share! If I had to complain, I would say that the pinto bean side was just a bit watery, but they still tasted great. \\n\\nThe service was friendly too!

It was a bit of a risk seeing how the weather was not up to par and about half of their available dinning space is outside. Luckily we were able to be seated upon arrival and that's when things got real. \\n\\nWe each had a Limon Frozen Margarita. I can be picky when it comes to my margs but this one hit the spot. It was pretty strong as well so you get your money's worth. \\n\\nTo get us going we ordered both the classic guacamole and classic queso. Both were very good and had their own unique taste. Next time we will up our game and try their fancier versions of both. Their chips are delicious but I did find it strange that chips and salsa are not on the house and cost $4. \\n\\nHaving studied the Lamar location menu before dining (because I take this stuff seriously) I knew I wanted to try a dish that was only offered on South 1st. We ordered the Chimichurri steak meal and I promise you I had every intention to take a quick snap of it but upon its arrival I couldn't deal and I had to dive right in. Having ordered the meal meant for 2 I wasn't sure how splitting for 3 was going to work out, but there was enough meat on that plate for everyone to have two tacos each.\\n\\nThis particular meal came with a side of charro beans where as some come with black beans.  The charro beans have a spicy smokey taste while the rice that was also included was a flavorful delight that paired nicely to relieve the heat from the beans.  \\n\\nWe were pretty stuffed after our meal but we weren't leaving without dessert. (Okay I wasn't leaving without dessert.) Everyone around us was ordering the sopapillas so we decided to do the same. They came covered in powdered sugar along with three sauces for dipping; dark chocolate, caramel and raspberry. The caramel sauce was the best of the three. We also felt a need to try the ice cream, an item the waiter mentioned to us at the beginning of the meal. We went with Salty Cajeta cajeta because it seams we were on a caramel kick that night. The ice cream itself was so creamy and filled with flavor and the surprise cookie it came with did not disappoint either. \\n\\nNeedless to say this place has legs and should stick around. As of right now it does not seem that they have happy hour but I would not be surprised if they come up with one in the near future."},{"name":"Chicken Kabob Restaurant","address":"756 Washington St","city":"Stoughton","stars":"4.5","text":"Very good restaurant! Majority of the dishes we ordered were delicious. My family and I loved the branzino fish the best. It was well made and delicious. We liked the chicken kofte, chicken with yogurt, eggplant with yogurt (mildly spicy in a good way and delicious), and freshly made bread. The spinach pie, however, was not very good. It was soggy by the time we ate it at home, and it just didn't measure up to spanakopitas (Greek version of spinach pie) we have eaten before. The  grape leaves were mediocre. The mixed grill was okay too . The rice and green beans in all the dishes were delicious. We were able to try three different baklavas to make up one order, so we tried the original pistachio, chocolate covered walnut, and cinnamon. They were good, but very sweet. Overall, I would definitely recommend this restaurant. The portions are huge! We have leftovers for days. The majority of the dishes we ordered were flavorful and delicious.

Personally, I think there's so many overrated places in Austin where you wait forever, pay tons of money, and it's like what's so special about this place??\\n\\nCafe Java is different. I love love it. One month, I came here 4 weekends in a row. I know, I'm crazy.\\n\\nIf this is your first time here, zoom in and write your name down on the waiting list then park yourself for a wait. The wait is usually 30-45 minutes depending on how big your party is. You will see a donut place a couple of doors down and you will be tempted to snack on a donut while you're waiting. Resist the temptation. Please. Tell yourself it will be worth it. Because it will.\\n\\nWhen it's your turn, someone will call your name and lead you to your table. Once you sit down look at the chalkboard in the back for the specials. My favorite special is this omelet with ground beef, potatoes, peas, and carrots. I don't remember what it is called but in my head I call it the \\"Shepherd's Pie Omelet.\\" If you don't see this on the board, I'm sorry. They don't allow you to order specials that aren't the special. Yeah, I asked.\\n\\nAnyway, on to the other things on the menu. Drinks! Get the coffee :) It is delicious and they give unlimited refills which they happily pour for you. They have other special drinks too, and just a small warning these drinks are delicious but they ARE very very sweet. \\n\\nFood, yes, no worries I remembered. My favorite thing to get are the omelets. My favorite is the California one because it comes with alfalfa sprouts!!! FYI if you are not a super fan of cheese (sorry bros) you can ask for less cheese. With the omelets come hash browns (potatoes in my tummy) and a type of bread - toast or English muffin. If you order toast, it comes with 4 triangles that are buttered and toasted perfectly. And I mean perfectly. Not too buttery, but just buttery enough where you feel like it's a luxury. I don't know how they do it, but it's amazing. The English muffins come with 2 halves and those are pretty good. If you are with a friend you can always each get one and go splitsies.\\n\\nYou're probably wondering, Dora what else is good??? Yeah, sorry I don't know. I've only come for brunch and I always get the omelets because they are soooo gooooooood. Seriously come try it. Oh yeah, pro tip if you order a side of avocado they are pretty generous for the price :). So yummy.\\n\\nEveryone here is always super nice and there's just generally a small diner feel here. When you're ready to pay, take the order that your server will leave on your table and go to the front and you can pay at the cashier. They will ask you how much you want to tip as they type this in manually so be ready to answer! The first time they asked me I felt awkward, but as long as you are expecting it then it's fine. They are also super nice about splitting the check among items as you can just tell them what each of you ordered.\\n\\nOh yeah, and parking has never been a problem :) Always a plus for me."},{"name":"Bukowski Tavern","address":"1281 Cambridge St","city":"Cambridge","stars":"3","text":"I reeeeeally like the original Bukes downtown, so I was pleased, and a little skeptical, when they expanded across the river.  This Bukes and I get along well.  The beer menu is great and the food is pretty good for bar cuisine. While the ambiance isn't as dark and crowded and Bukowski-esque as the original, I think the ol' Barfly would still frequent this place. They have huge windows on the street that are nice for the summer, although they like to keep them open a little late in the year for my personal thermal comfort. The only real complaint is the service.  I expect some degree of aloofness at a place trying this hard to be hip.  But the servers here take aloof to new levels of surly and unavailable.  Less than cool.  \\n\\nHowever, what kicks this fine establishment up to 4 stars is the fact that they served my dining companion a DEEP FRIED PEANUT BUTTER & FLUFF SANDWICH.  Even putting that on the menu takes some serious culinary cojones, my friends.  The chef that night actually came out of the kitchen to see what kind of freak would order something so ridiculous.

There was also endless Italian bread (which was nice and soft) and, all in all, the food reminded me of the Italian restaurants that I used to eat at as a kid (although, admittedly, with a lot less decor). But I don't look for decor for lunch, I just want to eat, and, based on my experience, this was just good, solid, well-cooked, old-school Italian food--and it only cost $6.79 (before tax, of course). My only complaint would be that the service wasn't all that great.\\n\\nIf you are a food snob and/or are looking for ambience, you're not going to like this place. There is no herb-and-olive oil dipping sauce. And they don't offer anything in the way of the newer versions of Italian cuisine that you now see in many of the more \\"upscale\\" Italian restaurants that are opening in the area. (In fact, from what I could see, their only concession to modern restaurantism is that they offer the refillable soda.) There is nothing fancy going on here, so if you are the kind of diner who can't enjoy a meal unless it is served in an upscale environment, with plenty of \\"atmosphere,\\" then don't bother with Mario's; it's not a place for yuppies. It's just a nice, small, family restaurant and while it's not the best old-school Italian-American food that I've eaten, it is still very good (and if the rest of their menu is on par with the meal that I just had there, then I will definitely want to eat there again.

You just can't not try them, you know?\\n\\nArrived here around 1:30 on a Saturday. After driving in from Houston, I was obviously famished so I was also looking forward to trying some of the food that they offer on the menu. \\nMy local Austin friend had arrived here first a couple of minutes earlier and informed us that the wait was going to be around 20 minutes. But as I walked in, I saw lots of open tables outside and wondered why. No matter, though, because that 20 minutes turned out to only be five minutes.\\n\\nAfter we were seated, our waiter came not too long after. Super fun and friendly guy and was helpful throughout our dining experience here. My friends and I obviously ordered the Manmosas and I opted to try the chili cheese dog to eat. One of my friends also ordered the Poutine to share.\\nNote that you are REQUIRED (or so our waiter said) to order food along with your manmosa due to amount of alcohol that you'd be ingesting. This wasn't a problem for us since we were hungry anyway. But if you plan on coming in here just for the manmosa and not eating, DON'T!\\n\\nMy chili cheese dog was pretty good, but I've had better. It's a pretty good size though (that's what she said) and will definitely fill you up. The poutine was a bit underwhelming. I expected a lot more gravy and cheese.\\n\\nAll in all, this is a good spot to start your weekend (and end it as well if you're a lightweight). I mean, a full bottle of champagne!!!! That's enough to get you buzzed, or even drunk if you're a lightweight. Don't expect anything gourmet when it comes to the food (although to be fair, my friends enjoyed each of their food selections a lot), and expect to pay for parking since street parking is rare (I paid $12 for two hours of parking in the parking lot at the end of the street).\\n\\nWill I be back?\\nBring out those damn manmosas and get this party started!!"},{"name":"Deschutes Brewery Portland Public House","address":"210 NW 11th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"We're big fans of Deschutes.

The relatively low price for the  premium sushi yields one of the better quality to price ratios for premium sushi in the Boston area (Omakasa, which is the most expensive option by far, runs about $50-60, but you get a quality of fish and selection for which I'd expect to pay $80-100 elsewhere).

Loved the mix of veggies and the top layer of crispy-edged melted gruyere cheese. The subtle sweet hints from the onion was a perfect combo.\\n\\nWent with Alex's suggestion for the Broiled Ras al Hanout Chicken entree. The cream sauce is addictive, forewarning.

But I gave it another shot and I've added it to my rotation.\\n\\nFirst, it is not like what you would expect from a Mexican restaurant around town (that's why my first time confused me). The wait time between ordering and receiving food is longer than other similar chains, but based on taste, I have to assume it's because the food is made fresh when you order - there is no pan of enchiladas they just scoop out and run to you. So expect a wait time more on par with \\"American\\" establishments. Most menu items do match with typical Mexican restaurants in the area, but food quality is higher and portions seem more tame.\\n\\nThe interior decor is formal but still has a touch of \\"old Mexico\\" like agave and ranchero/norte√±o music. The tables are solid (quartz?) and the booth cushions are comfortable.\\n\\nThe bar has several large screen TVs which play both US and Mexican sports games (soccer/f√∫tbol). \\n\\nServing staff seems to cover each other well, so if you flag anyone down for a refill, you will get it, and fast.\\n\\nCost is a bit higher than the other Mexican chains, again which I attribute to decor and food quality. For a table of one with soft drink and enchilada plate, and tip, I was covered around $20.\\n\\nThe only aspect other reviews have dinged is the salsa - truly like a marinara sauce. Even a dryer chopped salsa would be a good replacement. Otherwise, if you're watching carbs, pass on the chips and salsa. But not a big enough distraction to lose a star.\\n\\nBuen provecho."},{"name":"Bukowski Tavern","address":"1281 Cambridge St","city":"Cambridge","stars":"3","text":"Great beer and burgers!

We sat down and there were small tasting glasses at the place settings.  The server described the wine, and a few people said that they would like to order a glass of it.  The server then said, oh the actual Chardonnay will be different than this.  Why offer a sample of something if you can't even order it?\\n\\nOut of the 10 or so \\"on tap\\" house-made wines, two were stated as not available. Ok, that's understandable.  One of our guests ordered a glass of something else.  The server returned and said that they were out of that too.  Really?  My wine, which was the Sirah, was good though.\\n\\nWe ordered some appetizers, which were fine, but nothing to write home about.  Then we ordered entrees.  We did have to deliberately flag down and ask our server to bring another round of drinks, as he was constantly walking past our table and not even glancing to see if we needed refills (several of our glasses were empty).  \\n\\nA young man other than our server brought out two dishes (out of 6).  The two guests were polite and were waiting for the rest our meals to arrive.  5 minutes went by and no food came out.  We flagged down our server and asked where the rest of the food was.

It was hard to control (bits falling out) because that's about all there was in the sandwich (though the bread was good, and the size was right).

Parking in the area is difficult but when you do find street parking, PAY THE METER. We forgot to and got stuck with a lovely $20 ticket. My party was seated outside and there was a live band (their name escapes me) playing. We enjoyed the music and the company and the service was awesome! Our server had great suggestions on both food and drink (pretty sure we ordered all of his suggestions!). I had the habanero hot dog and was warned it was spicy. Oh, it was. But it was definitely tolerable. I also ordered a side of macaroni and cheese and was pleasantly surprised at how delicious it was.

Paired with a wheat beer suggested by my server, it was definitely one of my favorite meals during the entirety of our trip.

I know this because I've had my fair share of Starbucks including working in one in North Carolina.

The woman who worked there as both the cashier and the only waitress was super nice. She brought us house-made bread and it was warm and delicious. The soup was made from very good chicken broth with chunks of chicken. The amount of lemon in the soup was just right. It took a little while for the Adana Kebab entree to come. I understood why when I saw it - It had two giant ground lamb sausages fresh from the grill. I think the lamb may be house-ground as the texture didn't feel like it was machine-ground and mass produced. The lamb was mixed with chopped red pepper, onions, garlic and other seasonings. The plate also came with rice pilaf, some kind of seasoned grain, sauteed kale and  freshly grilled onions, tomatoes, and green horn pepper. All were very good. There was also some awesome fresh cucumber onion yogurt sauce on the side. Overall, the dish provided very a balanced diet and I didn't feel greasy or overly stuff even though I was quite full after eating half of it.\\n\\nAlthough it was priced at ~$14, the size of the entree was enough for two meals.

Even though the food is good, I feel like I'm not eating Chilantro dishes, but some concoction that I created.  It doesn't feel special at all.

While this price is not unreasonable, I don't think my party of 5 women (who aren't particular meat lovers) broke even to make it worth an AYCE option. That being said, it was a good experience to try, but I will probably not be back unless I go with a lot of people who can EAT. They do also offer a slight discount (essentially no taxes) if you pay in cash.\\n\\nThe ordering is pretty simple: decide on what type of broth you want (we got half spicy/half nutrition), and mark a menu sheet the different types of meat, veggies, hot foods, and extra items that you want. We were instructed to simply check off what we wanted. Everything came out very quickly and the ingredients seemed very fresh, but unfortunately, the servers didn't bring out a couple of things that we checked like corn (completely forgot about this until dinner was done), silken tofu (had to ask specifically for this to be brought out), and they also brought out the wrong type of noodles (we wanted handmade but they brought us ramen). No biggie, but the sullen staff taking our orders and bringing us our food didn't help. They seemed to be mostly annoyed that we kept bugging them for more stuff while they were trying to watch Modern Family on tv.\\n\\nThe sauce bar in the front of the restaurant was a great option to customize our own sauces. My only complaint is that there were a number of fruit flies around the bar. Kinda gross but I still piled on the jalepenos and cilantro anyway.\\n\\nWe loved the spicy broth and I really liked the nutrition broth as it had a very clean, savory flavor to it. I had expected it to be a bit bland, but complemented with some sauce, it was perfect. The hot food items like scallion pancakes, soup dumplings, and fried dough were pretty disappointing. Everyone sampled one but we did not order more and just focused on the fresh ingredients instead.\\n\\nAll in all, a very enjoyable dinner with great company. It was fun to try a different style of shabu shabu/hot pot and introduce some new veggies/meats. (I've only tried Korean Shabu Shabu places in the past.)

Whoever doesnt like a not a toasted but a put in the oven to melt the cheese grinder doesnt appreciate the are of making a good sandwich.

Decor is sort of a modern/sheik diner.  The feel was a little more sparse/cold than I cared for but not a big deal.  \\n\\nDoughnut burger sliders, about what you would expect.  Two for $6.  We were expecting three but oh well.\\n\\nService was okay, we didn't have forks for the first part of the meal and had to ask for them and the server took quite a long time to check in to see how our meals were.\\n\\nThe burgers were excellent.  Breakfast was, well, breakfast.  But worse.  Biscuits were almost rock hard and with not much  gravy. \\n\\nAfter consultation with the server, I took the recommendation of the Blue Plate special on the fresh sheet which was fried chicken and lentils - supposedly better than the fried chicken on the normal menu.  For $20 I got one dry, overcooked leg of chicken on top of a huge pile of overseasoned lentils. I'm not sure what it is with people and their obsession for fried chicken.  I can see the appeal of the thin dusting/coating on this chicken making for crispy, salty skin, probably too salty.  But what was inside was SO dissapointing.  The driest fried chicken I've ever tasted.  In the past 15 years I've probably dined out at least 200 times and maybe sent my food back 3 times and this was one of them.\\n\\nInstead I opted for a glass of red wine and a side of mac and cheese (a bargain for $4).  The Mac and Cheese shell pasta wasn't overcooked, actually cooked correctly al dente, hurray! The cheese sauce was a bit thin and lacked depth but otherwise was pretty decent.  Amazing that I went from $20 overcooked chicken leg to a $4 bowl of mac and cheese that was much more edible.  They of course did not charge me for the chicken and through in the mac and cheese for free which was a nice gesture.\\n\\nThe place is the definition of a 3-star dining experience for me ( I was hoping for/expecting a 4.)  Just A-OK. Would have been 2 but burgers saved it. Maybe if I'm back in town I'd tried something else on the menu as the burgers, sandwiches and salads were quite reasonably priced.\\n\\nI've got to be honest that I'm scratching my head regarding the 5-star reviews.  Even if I assumed some of the other items on the menu were excellent, I don't see, all things considered, how this place could be rated 5-stars unless your are either hungover, hungry and craving salty food (and thereby have a low bar to meet) and/or you are overly enchanted by the modern diner concept."},{"name":"Pho 2000","address":"198 Adams St","city":"Dorchester","stars":"4","text":"Food: 3.0/5.0\\nService: 2.5/5.0\\nValue: 3.0/5.0\\nDecor: 2.0/5.0\\nOverall: 2.5/5.0\\n\\nMediocre ingredient quality but otherwise a typical bowl of pho.

The main dish was searing hot but the roti came lukewarm like it had been sitting at the pass for a while. Regardless, the flavors were on point and I loved the roti!  The pad Thai wasn't what I was expecting though, mostly because it doesn't match the description in the menu.  Instead of the traditional tamarind / fish sauce, they used a tomato base for the dish and it kind of reminded me of ketchup.  And instead of the egg being fried in, it was boiled, sliced in half, and placed top of the dish.  I found it kind of odd, but that's just me.

Its definitely nice, just don't expect that true rustic mountain cabin feel others have described. \\n \\nWe came in for dinner, I had the Elk Burger and my boyfriend had the Mac 'n Cheese. The Elk burger was great- cooked well (I ordered medium and it definitely was), came with a nice side salad (an option I chose). My boyfriend was less impressed with his Mac 'n cheese- it seemed like it had a lot of the sauce they cooked the sausage in and not very much cheese. It looked like a cheese stew by the end. We ordered a side of sweet potato fries to share which were perfectly cooked and tasted great! My boyfriend also ordered a flight of beers and we just asked the waitress to pick six of the best- we liked them all. I really liked the Chainbreaker for it's citrus hops and he liked the Black Butte Porter best. Our waitress was awesome- super nice :)\\n\\nOverall it was good. I'd go to try the beer and to hang out with friends (they have HUGE booths for 10-12 ppl). I wouldn't go  for a rustic or intimate atmosphere as the room is huge and brightly lighted.

I have visited restaurants on many travels around the country and this is by far my favorite gluten-free experience. And it's right here in my home town!  Everything is gluten free and I didn't have to sort out all the ingredients on each menu item to figure out what I could eat.  It is fine dining and the food was delicious.  It was very unusual in that I felt like all the options for me were first class, not some cobbled up concoctions to keep a gluten free member of the dinner party from wlaking out.  Last night, our table had the salmon, the chicken saltimbocca and the trout.  All were presented well and tasted great, inlcuding the cecina, a chickpea based flatbread that did not fall apart - as most gluten free breads do - when you touched it.  Staff was professional and pleasant and not in the way at all.  They even have good wines that are safe for celiacs.  Dessert was amazing.  A broad selection including chocolate mousse, cheesecake, beignets and a few more.  Biggest gluten free - and tasty - dessert selection I've seen in a restaurant.  Did not have the appetizers but they looked like they would be very tasty as well, including fried calamari (gluten free, of course), salmon croquettes, shrimp fraiche soup, and more.

They have liverwurst, wild venison, wild boar chorizo and so much more. They also will cut steaks to order and at a reasonably price.

There are two ways to order: a la cart or supper club menu. A la cart currently offers items like cured meat boards, venison ceviche, pickled chicken feet and braised venison neck ( the last dish serves 4). The supper club menu is an intriguing pre fixe menu to include dessert for $38. Thursdays they will offer a chicken dinner using Dewberry Hills hens and Fridays they will offer a seafood focused menu.\\n\\nThe drink menu includes an exceptional list of Texas beers, wines and ciders. They also offer Austin's beloved Cuvee Coffee. They do not have a hard liquor license but serve creative wine and beer based cocktails.\\n\\nWhen I returned for dinner I opted for the griddled country ham with peach chutney. The tender rich ham was balanced beautifully with the Texas peaches. For dessert I had the prickly pear fruit sorbet which came out a gorgeous hue of purple and had a light sweet flavor.

Lots of cool 50's items and it truly didn't feel too cheesy or that they were trying too hard. \\n\\n * Food was great. 3 of us got hamburgers that were all satisfying and delicious. One of us also got breakfast for dinner, and hey, you can't beat that! Portion's weren't too big or too small, and the sandwiches come with a pretty good choice of sides. Menu seemed to be full of some good choices.\\n\\nCons:\\n\\n * SERVICE! One of the worst experiences I've had in a while at a restaurant. There was no one there to seat us when we arrived, and we had to wait a few minutes for anyone to even notice that there was anyone waiting. Our waitress was decent, and didn't take to long ask for drink or food orders, and was attentive. It did take forever though for our food to come. We were waiting for at least 45-50 minutes after we ordered. It surely doesn't take that long to cook a couple burgers and a waffle. The cooks seemed genuinely frustrated with waitstaff. \\n\\n * The head waiter (or whoever, he wore a black shirt and pants) was really rude to both the other waitresses and customers. He constantly snapped annoying and rude comments and was generally abrasive. Worse, he was licking his fingers while preparing milkshakes and then got into a fight with a waitress who asked him to wash his hands. \\n\\nBottom Line:\\n\\nI was pleased with the food, but the awful service doesn't make me want to come back and spend my money anytime soon again and I would definitely not reccomend it to anyone else.

Green onion pancake was great! Red bean paste pancake, however, was a no-no... dry, a mouthful, and just mediocre; the red bean paste was tasty but the breading around it was meh.

If you have something against watching expensive food being cooked by 20 something's, ask to be seated in front. This however, was exciting for me. Wine list is nice and server was helpful. Not extremely knowledge but above my level so hey- I appreciated his input. The shrimp and grits appetizer is just as described and tasty. I ordered the duck for my entree; crust was perfect and it was the temp to be expected for medium rare, but just cool and chewy by the time I ate which had me leave the center pieces for scrap.

The first waitress took our drink order; a few minutes later the barman showed up and asked if I really wanted gin in my caparinha. What?? Apparently the waitress had claimed I'd specified gin. A second waitress showed up to take our appetizer order: we ordered \\"fritters\\" from the appetizer menu. After a bit the host arrived with a dish of frito misto. No, we ordered \\"fritters\\" from the menu. He looked surprised and took the dish back. A few minutes later he returned with a dish of cod and potato fritters and said \\"We made these on the fly.\\" What?? I pointed out: they are on the menu. He seemed confused. The barman then returned to take our order, and got it right. My husband's poached cod was very tasty and beautifully plated, but was not hot. The fritters had been substantial and tasty, so I had simply ordered the Caesar salad with white anchovies. It looked good on arrival, but was surprisingly bland, even after several grinds of pepper. No garlic flavor at all. \\n\\nSo bottom line: the food was good-to-okay, and the barman was outstanding. But the management was a disaster.

The food was divine: the cranberry bread was a sweet surprising treat. we started with the kangaroo which had a pot roast flavor except for the sweet caramelized onions which made the dish special and exciting. My girlfriend and I ordered the salmon and also the duck entrees, and we told the waitress we planned to share them- and when the food came out the restaurant had already split the entrees so we had both entrees on our plates!! The salmon was so crisp on the outside and tender to perfection inside. The mushroom ravioli with the duck was chewy and savory, and the small bits of bacon added huge flavor. For dessert we had the popcorn ice cream- which tasted exactly like my mom's homemade caramel corn. The only issue was that we were sitting outside and the ice cream melted quickly. It was a busy Friday night- the parking lot was packed but we did NOT feel rushed or crowded at all. We were there for 2 hours and it was incredibly relaxing. It is one of the best restaurants I have ever been to, if for no other reason besides the incredible service."},{"name":"B.J.

Despite the speedy delivery of the nachos, it seemed as if they had sat out for a while because the cheese was lukewarm and far more solid than creamy. It was also apparent that no one in Bangers' kitchen had ever encountered the concept of nachos before given the scarcity of chili and cheese compared to the amount of chips. I would easily say 2/3 to 3/4 of the chips had no chili nor cheese on them (see photo) so we left them on the plate as a subtle suggestion to either serve nachos well or don't serve them at all. \\n\\nDue to the epic failure I just described, we also tried the bacon mac and cheese bites, which were equally as disappointing. The Mac and cheese was dried out and no bacon to be found. The guys sitting next to us ordered them as well and offered the same observation unsolicited. As with the nachos, the cheese sauce that accompanied these bites was also lukewarm and mostly solid by the time it was served. \\n\\nAll in all, the food was edible and has good potential so I generously gave it two stars.

And gave me enough reason to come back ... so much that I come here 1-2 times a week (it's next door to work). This is one of those places where you order up front and they cook the food to order. The chef guy is super nice, very warm, and reminds of Emeril except a Latin version :) And after you get your food, make sure you get the complimentary tortilla chips & salsa. \\n\\nCHICKEN TACOS ($2.35)\\nTasty slices of chicken breast, fresh guac, pico de gallo, flour tortilla. I've gotten this multiple times - not only b/c it tastes good, but also b/c it's just $2.35. Sometimes 1 taco is enough (b/c I also get a lot of chips & salsa) but 2 tacos is probably a good portion for lunch.\\n\\nSAUSALITO LOMITO ($7.95)\\nPork sirloin sandwich on toasted bun w/ fresh guac, lettuce, tomato, and signature Chipotle sauce. Also comes w/ rice & beans, or fries. One time I had seen the person in front of me order this dish and the pork looked so delicious - he said he gets the Lomito all the time. I finally tried it and fell in love. The pork sirloin is very good, and tastes like it's been marinated in lime. It's just very messy to eat - I ended up deconstructing my sandwich and forgoing the buns. I'd still get it again. Beans & rice were very good, too. Oh - and I was actually able to make two meals out of this.\\n\\nGRILLED CHICKEN BURRITO ($5.25)\\nThis turned out looking more like an enchilada than burrito. It definitely wasn't a Willy's. The burrito had chicken (tasty), cheese, and a very spicy sauce on top. I ended up deconstructing my burrito and just eating the chicken b/c the sauce was too spicy. It was missing the fresh veggies to cool off my mouth :(\\n\\nSIDE SALAD\\nDuring one visit, the chef gave me a complimentary side salad - the lettuce always looks very fresh here. Except I made the mistake of getting the \\"blackberry habanero\\" dressing (b/c it sounded so unique). My lips were BURNING!!!!!! However if you like spicy, I dare you to try it :) They have a good selection of some unique dressings.\\n\\nSTEAK TACOS ($2.35)\\nThese are good, too.\\n\\nOverall 3.5 stars rounded to 4.

We tried fried octopus, a variety range of sashimi, yakitori and udon. The fried octopus was so good, crunchy on the outside and tender inside. Definitely will try more from the fried menu. We ordered thinly sliced  hirame(halibut), hamachi(yellow tail), king salmon, sea urchin, hotate(scallop) and ama ebi(sweet shrimp). The first two are on the daily special menu which is said to be imported from the Chikuji market in Tokyo. The hirame is so good, fresh, sweet and a well balance between crunchy and tender. Yellow tail leaves a fishy taste in your mouth which I don't like but it seems I generally don't like any yellow tail anyway. King salmon was just OK, I think you can get same even better quality salmon from Tensuke market if you buy the sushi grade salmon there, ours was even still a bit icy when it was served, had to leave it there for a while so that the ice melt. The sea urchin was great, the freshness level is hard to get in Columbus, most sea urchin has a not-so-great after taste but this one doesn't, happily paid for $9 for this one piece. The ama ebi was just OK, it gets the sweet flavor but lacks the fatty and sticky taste you get from a better ama ebi. I think the best ama ebi I've ever had in Columbus was in Tora.

Generally speaking I think the sashimi served here is great quality, but you have to choose the right one for your liking, will try more in the future especially from the daily special menu. The yakitori is great, although I generally don't like Japanese Bbq(please try Chinese bbq, best in the world hands down, the best place in town is Jiu Thai) my husband does and he think it's up there even comparing to yakitori we tried in Japan, NY and California in terms of flavor and timing. My favorite in the platter was the wings and his was chicken skin. I agree the yakitori was pretty juicy unlike most yakitori but I wish they substituted onion with green onion. Lastly the curry udon. I don't like it...least favorite dish tonight. You can feel it's not the standard curry cube flavor, they definitely add some twist to it. But I feel like it has a slightly sour taste that I'm not a fan of. In that sense I don't think I'll try anything related with curry from Yoshi in the future. My favorite Japanese curry place in town is Karen. The bill was $120 with a beer without tip, which was not a surprise because the sashimi we ordered was $5 a piece on average. Cheaper price, better sashimi selection and much better service attitude than Kihachi.

Fortunately for us, a friend invited us to the Infamous Brewery launch party tonight, which happened to be at Banger's.\\n\\nWe reviewed the menu online and made our choices before we arrived. When we saw they had two options for our dog (we picked the woof wurst), we decided to bring him along with us. I was a little disappointed they did not have the chicken habanero sausage I had preselected (they said the online menu had not been updated yet), but I decided to order the jalapeno bacon cheese \\"burger\\" (it's sausage, too). I wanted to try the pretzel bun but went with the recommended kolache bun. If I had any complaints, I'd say the bun was a little hard. I left most of the bun behind, but I normally don't eat all the bread on my sandwiches unless the bread is to-die-for. My hubz got the antelope and venison sausage, and he was really happy with it. My burger came with fries, which I shared with my hubz, and they were great. Our dog seemed to really enjoy his sausage, too. :)\\n\\nWe had two waiters because one was being trained. They looked like long-lost brothers: hair pulled back in tiny ponytails with old-timey mustaches. They were eclectic and fun, and didn't seem to have a sense of urgency about them, but we weren't in a rush so we didn't mind.\\n\\nAll three of us ate for a mere $28, which we thought was an extremely good deal.

Any reviewer worth their writing knows that the decor and atmosphere of a restaurant is almost as important as the food!!  If you feel uncomfortable with a table at your chin, etc - well, the food just won't taste as good - simple as that.  A restaurant/dining experience starts from the moment you are walking up to the place, to stepping foot inside, looking around to being seated, etc.  A rule for food reviews that I was taught by a well-known editor is:  Food is #1.  But the environment is a VERY CLOSE second.\\n\\nThe egg-shaped chairs, may look cool at first, but they are actually very uncomfortable to sit in, while you are trying to eat.  You sink in too far and the table comes up to your chest - so you end up sitting on the very edge of the chair - a very uncomfortable and awkward experience!  \\n\\nAs well, I just simply find the entire decor, from these chairs to the neon, all very cheesy and to be trying waaay too hard.\\n\\nThis isn't the worst place in Vancouver, but for the price - I wouldn't recommend it - UNLESS you have a guaranteed reservation to be seated on the small (one table-width only) patio.

I have eaten dinner at Canoe several times in the past, and this meal was not up to par. Although our server was good, it took 2 1/2 hours for us to eat appetizers, entr√©e and dessert-it wasn't because we delayed with our orders. It took almost 40 minutes for us to get our salads, and it also took about 20 to 25 minutes for us to get the desserts we ordered. As a matter of fact, we were ready to cancel the desserts when they were brought to the table.  Not sure why we had such delays with our service, because other tables were served much quicker. Some of the entr√©es were better than others. My steak was a bit tough and cold; honestly, I've had better quality from the grocery store.  My father's pork chop was way overcooked, and I could see him struggling to cut it with a steak knife.  Management handled it graciously and replaced his entr√©e free of charge. However, I think we would've preferred to pay for an excellent meal.  Desserts were good, not memorable, but good, and my coffee was not hot. Sorry to have to write this review, because I've always liked this restaurant and considered it one of Atlanta's best. Tonight was disappointing, possibly because they had 2 or 3 large parties outdoors. This is not the first restaurant I've seen slip on the quality of service and food when they have large outdoor parties. I think it's a shame restaurants don't prepare better for these events. That could be why our waiter and other servers were nowhere to be found when I realized my steak was cold and undercooked and my father's pork chop was tough and overcooked. That could also explain why our server was the one refilling our water glasses; honestly, in a restaurant of this caliber, you would think they should have assistants.

So I Googled on my phone for what restaurants were nearby. One of them was Waxy O'Connors Irish Pub. That sounded good and I could use a beer after the long flight.\\n\\nArrived at the pub. I must admit - it's a pretty impressive looking place. Kind of reminded me of a small country club. Very nice wood work inside and a HUGE bar right in the middle of the place.\\n\\nAnyway, sat myself at the bar, ordered a pint of beer and asked for a menu. Browsing through the menu that had quite a few tasty sounding items, all typical fare for an Irish style pub. I saw clam chowder on the menu, which sounded like a good starter. So I only ordered the soup and would maybe order something else after the soup.\\n\\nSoup came. It looked delicious. I eat a spoonful and was surprised at the taste in my mouth - there was a sour taste to it. It almost seemed like there was sour cream mixed in with it. I've had New England style clam chowder many, many times in my life, and this folks would have to be the worst. I don't know - maybe there was just something wrong with it at that moment on that day.\\n\\nI ended up finishing the soup (I was hungry), all of the provided oyster crackers (to stifle the sour taste of the soup), and my beer. Paid and left. Considering that the \\"New England\\" style clam chowder was just not that good in an Irish Pub in Massachusetts, shame on you. -2 stars.\\n\\nHowever, I ended up coming back with a work associate a few days later, but ordering the fish and chips this time instead (along with a few pints). Absolutely delicious! Probably some of the BEST (and biggest) fish and chips I have ever had. The [bar] waitress was quite friendly and socially entertaining, and the atmosphere was great.\\n\\nI would definitely return again (the next time I'm in Lexington) and try something else on the menu (and maybe a cup of the chowder again, just for verification purposes to determine that it just wasn't a bad day for chowder)."},{"name":"Smashburger","address":"9900 S Interstate 35, Bldg P Ste 900","city":"Austin","stars":"2.5","text":"Roomy was telling me about this place yesterday so I decided to look them up online.

Which is stupid and even more expensive. I got the regular smash fries which I regret. All in all I payed $12 bucks for my meal. I also got the Butter finger milkshake. Well when I got home and took a bite out of my burger I thought it was yummy. The only thing I didn't like was the soggy bottom bun. The fries were HORRIBLE!

Though I think only two of the options were GF, that's better than any other option I could think of (which was nothing).\\n\\nBoth times I've been so far, I've gotten the half salad, half rice bowl.

I don't even like blue cheese that much but I really enjoyed those toppings, they make their own buffalo sauce and it was really good.

I was expecting expensive.  I'm not sure I was expecting it to this degree.\\n\\nNormally, when downtown places have lunch specials.  It did not.  That's a bit disappointing, but isn't terrible.  If you got a lot of scratch to blow, this is a great place to do it, though, even though it has a very kitschy sort of look/feel to it.  I do plan to stop in for a malt or something when I am feeling like I can handle one...\\n\\nMy best recommendation is to take a non-Portlander here because it does roll up PORTLAND very well.  Creative, sustainably-focused menu items in that retro 50s/60s ironic-with-tattooed-staff thing going on.  It is a great introduction of a lot Portland has to offer AND they include band posters on the columns so that people from out of town will have things to do at night!\\n\\nI'm not on a budget for lunch; I was ready to go... but even I baulked at 20$ mac and cheese (but it had lobster in it!).  I shied away from it: I'm probably a wimp.  What I did try was the hot dog flight.  Note, not all items were out of whack: all the sandwiches were reasonable in price and the fish and chips are on par with pretty much everywhere else.\\n\\nSince I was to have three dogs, I figured a salad would be a nice accompaniment.  I was right.  The salad was delicious and fresh; a slightly sour lemon vinaigrette with a hint of salt... not overly dressed either.  Well done!  The dogs were 3 mini-dogs (so about 1 regular dog) and had three toppings on them.  All of them were excellent.  The chilli (Chicago)  (which honestly frightened me a bit; I'm not a beef fan although I like sausages) was very good.  It was sweet and slightly smoky and had no spice to it.  The New York style had lox and an aioli of some sort that was also very good with pickled onions on it.  The Portland dog had green relish, gherkins, and a bit of pickled peppers.  \\n\\nI tried their house-made soda, the bark soda.  It was like a cross between a good root beer and a good cream soda with a hint of nutmeg.  Good!  Not sure it was worth 40% of the hot dogs, but it was good. Maybe I should have added booze to it for 2$, but it was lunch...\\n\\nI must see what they have going on for a happy hour.  This place would be fun for something like that, I think.  The wait staff was also attentive without being overbearing--something I think people are catching on to.  It is a novelty and I'm only afraid that the price will scare people off from going back.  But then again, there's a hotel upstairs and those people have expense accounts.  What better way to be introduced to Portland than with a lobster-stuffed corndog or a Voodoo-doughnut cheeseburger?\\n\\nI still have to give them props for sourcing locally.\\n\\nMaybe they could be REALLY cool and give a Portlander discount--they card you and give you 20% off for being a weird local?  Maybe?  C'mon, I'm doing my part to keep Portland weird.  Purple hair, Dutch bike, vintage suits... please?\\n\\nI have friends coming in from out of town though, and this will probably be on the Portland circuit as a post Chinese Garden lunch spot or dinner.

The total on the justeat website was $12.55, their receipt says $13.64.

No need to call OPD (but if anyone sees OUC, please stop them and ask them to turn my power back on, please).\\n\\nSo, I've seen the other reviews and regarding the food, they're all on point. My favorite dish so far (because the menu is gi-mongous) has got to be the Roti. I would highly recommend that if you order this dish ($3-$4) add another roti (especially if you plan to share) for another $1.50 as you're going to have plenty of curry remaining. Unless like me you simply pour all of that remaining goodness either directly in your mouth or on a 2nd dish. Not lady-like, I know, but whatever.\\n\\nAnother dish that I'd recommend - well I'll have to navigate you directionally on the menu as I can't remember the name. Go to noodle section (right panel inside and column 2 I think) and it's the 3rd dish from the bottom. When I've ordered, folks have asked if it's Pad Thai and I know it's not. Similar, but it's not. It's apparently labeled as a signature dish and one of the servers noted that it's a very popular hawker dish.\\n\\nThe food is good - check. The booze is good (I think they're pouring 4-oz wine pours to accommodate the low $5 across-the-board wine by the glass pricing, but that's okay) - check. But most importantly, it's the team and overall vibe that really make this place work extremely well for me. A perfect fit for the Colonialtown neighborhood, indeed and not at all that hokiness you find downtown or in TP. Kay and C/Kaleb have been the two main faces that I've seen on my recent ventures and in their two weeks of functioning, they seem to be delivering with such cool, calm, and collect. Atypical of a restaurant fresh from opening (example, Bananas down the street during opening week was well...bananas. I've not been back). Well done, guys. Well done. \\n\\nSo one would think that after buying Mizuno's from Track Shack that I would have gone jogging down Mills for a minute to give the new kicks a go. I did, but I didn't get too far. .

(overfoam the hots, over-ice the colds) If you ask for 'light ice' (as, let's face it, half the cup is ice and I'm not paying 4 bucks for a cup of ice) on an iced tea some of the staff don't fill it to the brim.

I know to ask for my chai latte with no water if I want a bigger punch of flavor. I know the 3-4-5 ratio of syrups and I know that people cheat lattes by asking for iced americanos with room and then raid the milk at the service station to make low-rent lattes. I'm aware.\\n\\nI'm also aware that the attitude is unprofessional and you DO fill the cup even if they ask for light ice. Don't like it? Don't be a barista. It's not easy, god knows I hated it.\\n\\nI'm sympathetic to dealing with attitude all day, but if I ask nicely to please fill it (considering there was a huge gap), then you should fill it.\\n\\nIn my experience, a drink that is over-foamed or over-iced,  it's the product of someone not feeling like making more base for the tea or getting more milk from a back fridge. I've found better quality at the Kenmore location - but they do not have nearly the volume.\\n\\nAlso, you're not going to get a seat here unless it's during a break in the semester. And if you DO get a seat, you will have people bumping your seat as they get their drinks, etc. It's not a very large space for the volume they do.

She took another job within the company I work for and this was her going away lunch.  She wanted to find a place that had gluten free options as she is one of those people.  Deschutes was the place she chose.  This is the first time I've ever had the food.  I've been a few times, but specifically for the beer.  There would not be beer this time.  Too bad.

If someone votes something the best of something else I need to at least try it.  Seared Coleman Ranch beef, root beer braised pork belly, jalapeno pesto, whipped goat cheese and candied yellow tomatoes on fresh baked mustard ciabatta ($15).  If you eat the braised pork belly on its own you can really taste the root beer.  Very nice.  The burger was cooked to a medium rare which is exactly how I like it these days.  I was ready to jump down someones throat because the bun had some white stuff on it that I thought was mayo.  I specifically asked for no mayo.  Long story short one of my co-workers ordered her burger with mayo and didn't get any so we just switched bun tops.  Turns out mine had the whipped goat cheese on it which I actually would've liked.  It looked like mayo to me.  If I had the menu in front of me I would have known that it wasn't mayo.  You live and you learn.  Hopefully.\\n\\nThe burger was very good and very messy.

I was not able to sample my g/f's entr√©e because of a scallop allergy, but she was not impressed either.  \\n\\n(1) The salad: I would give it a 2/5. It was average and not special. A fancy place needs to have a superb salad, not an average salad that they have had around forever.    Why do they serve the same house salad for restaurant week as they do normally?  Can't they change it up?  How difficult is it to make a new creative salad?  If you compare the RW menu v. the regular menu, they just try to make it look like a different salad by naming the SAME ingredients in a different order.  Literally every salad my girlfriend has made me has been better.  Just yesterday she made a recreation of a fig salad she had at Deweys.  Its was wayyy better.  The only positive about the salad was that nothing in it was wilty or spoiled. Truly.\\n(2) Shrimp and Gritts small plate:  I would give it a 1/5.  First, it was served lukewarm at best. It  came with only three shrimp. Why not 5 shrimp, especially if people are sharing the dish or getting it an an appetizer?  They probably cost the restaurant like $0.25 each.  All of those said three shrimp were rubbery and plain tasting.  I've had better precooked shrimp from Wal-Mart, and no I am not joking.  The combination of those three things (funny right, three shrimp and three complaints) was enough for us to not even finish the tiny dish.  It was horrible.  \\n(3) Duck Confit small plate:  I would give it a 4.75/5 which is excellent in my book.  It was properly severed at the correct temperature.  It had great texture, flavor, heat/spice, and was the perfect amount to serve.  I would recommend this dish if you are not scared of a tab bit of heat.\\n\\nOverall Food:  7.75/15 or 51%.  Factoring spending $100 to eat here on a date and being disappointed, exclusive of the fact that it was a 1 year anniversary dinner, I give it 2/5 or 40%.\\n\\nOh YEAH:  I forgot to add that although the inside of the restaurant is very nice looking, we were seated in the corner.  It was freezing outside, minus ten or so.  We were not seated even remotely close to a door.  We could feel a very cold breeze coming from underneath the booth, and also around the top of the booth.

Here's why.\\n\\nStopped in with a friend on Friday night to grab a quick dinner before meeting some other friends for drinks in the area. When we walked in, the place was pretty dead, but no employees greeted us, so we sat ourselves and tried to be courteous by leaving bigger tables open for others.. Meaning we ended up at a small table in the back. We waited 5-10 minutes for menus which seemed a bit long, but I'll always give the benefit of the doubt that something else might've been going on. \\n\\nWhen we finally got menus, our waited asked about a drink order, but hadn't brought us a drink menu and since we were in the back of the restaurant, I couldn't read the chalkboard wall by the bar. I took a stab and asked for a Shipyard which he explained was out of season. Nbd. But then he just stood there. So things got awkward and I eventually had to ask what was available and he mumbled through a list that I could barely hear. I eventually ordered the last thing he said (that I had finally heard) and off he went.\\n\\nIt was another 5-10 minutes to get the drinks back which seemed long and honestly, was a time we considered cutting our losses and leaving. I could see our waiter at the bar, just hanging out and though I'm sure he was waiting for the bartender, he dbidn't come back at all in the meantime.\\n\\nWhen he finally did return with drinks, I asked for a BYOB card and he mumbled something that I couldn't understand, but said yes, assuming he was asking if I'd like one. He nearly walked away as my friend flagged him down to order her own meal. When he brought back the card (and subsequently picked it up) he didn't say a word and barely stopped at the table long enough to get it. A simple, \\"Let me put that right in for you\\" would've been nice!\\n\\nWhen our food finally came out, another waitress brought it by. Our waiter didn't come by until we were nearly done to ask how it was. Once we were finished, we waited awkwardly again for him to come back and I actually had to pull my wallet out to get his attention. \\nWe finally got the bill and both of us being disappointed in the service and our waiter's attention, decided to only leave a small tip. We left cash and didn't need change, but before we could even get out coats on, he was back to pick up the bill (weird, where was that speed all night?!)\\n\\nAnd this is where it gets even worse: We walked out of the restaurant up toward Boylston and hear fast footsteps after us-- our waiter CHASED AFTER US to \\"ask for feedback\\" having obviously seen his tip and then stood there waiting for a response. We were both stunned and finally offered that the service was slow and he was both inattentive and hard to hear. He then reminded us that \\"you guys know I only really make money off tips, right? But it's okay...\\" As if guilting me an alley would warrant a bigger tip. We've both worked in food service so yes, I know most of a waiters money comes from tips, but you have a job to do to earn it.\\n\\n We were both shocked and grossly turned off by being followed out and asked why we didn't tip more/trying to guilt us into giving more at that moment.

No, this wasn't a bistro, in fact, how can Indian food even qualify to be the \\"quick, easily stored\\" kind of food available in a bistro, I'm not sure, but from being Indian American, one thing I can say, the use of the word \\"bistro\\" is just another example of the old-school (read: my parents' generation's) idea of fun. In other words, alliteration is clever to older Indian folk. And the whole concept, from the theme to the execution, is an exercise in merriment according to a 50 year old Indian person and the fresh-faced couples from India looking for a bit o' home.  \\n\\nThis restaurant is an old-school place of merriment, starting from the name and ending with the check delivered by the owner himself. One thing I've learned (and verified in my extensive experience) with Indian restaurants in India is that waiters *don't,*, in authentic Indian restaurants (that means in India) explain the dishes to you.\\n\\nThe BB is spacious, with north Indian drapes hanging from windows and walls, and booth seating as well as sets of tables. The owner hangs out behind the bar and looks to be a kindly older gentleman who goes unnoticed. Clientele on a weeknight was all Indian - a mix of older couples and younger couples as well as a big group of twenty-somethings. That can only be a good thing. \\n\\nThe waitress didn't know much about the food, and had to check with the cooks. But frankly, I didn't, either, so as my mentor recently said, if you don't know about the company you're investing in, you deserve to lose your shirt. Fortunately, I didn't. \\n\\nA goat vindaloo and lamb curry later, my sister and I were sated. We appreciated the waiter's asking us to specify the level of spicyness we wanted; we chose a 9 and a 8. Very happy with the result; this was North Indian/Punjabi cooking at its finest. The spices really meshed well with the chili powder. \\n\\nA couple caveats: 1. my specialty isn't North Indian cooking. If you can, scroll down and read Chander's review.

Their menu is different with various ingredients infused into burgers, they have slider combos, and then specialty burgers, like the Kobe burger or the crab burger for example.  I've had the crab 'burger' and it was..well..it was just ok.  I was pretty excited about ordering it because the menu says it's made with claw meat (YUM!).  It was very chinstzy on the claw meat and it was actually pretty greasy to where it was more mushy than anything.  I've also had the Korean burger and I thought it was pretty good but, again, just ok.  It fell apart and was difficult to eat.  They need to use something to keep the meat together rather than it busting into five or six pieces as you are trying to eat it.  I have also had the International sliders and they were good.  The Mexican wasn't very good (to me) but everyone has different tastes.  The slaw.  The slaw is very different.  It has white raisins in it and it's got a sweet taste to it.  It was good the first two times I had it but last night I had some of my husband's and it just didn't seem as good.  I can't even believe I'm going to say it, but the tater tots are gross.

I love Haitian food and used to go quite often when it was Bel Jazz, the previous incarnation (although with different owners).  However, I will not be going back.\\n\\nFirst off, the menu has very few Haitian selections.  It almost looks like they want to be a French restaurant instead of a Haitian one but advertise themselves as Haitian.  I had to ask for very basic items to make sure they had them.  After inquiring with the waitress I was able to select griot (not sure why this wouldn't be on the menu as it is a Haitian staple).  I wanted to get rice and beans with it, but I was with a couple of people so instead opted for a plate of griot, plaintains, and akra so we could all share.  We were told the plate would be $12.50.  I was hungrier than the others so I asked for a side of rice and beans for myself.  I will admit that the food was good.  The waitress came by every couple of minutes which got to be annoying.  I understand trying to ensure a customer has what he/she needs, but this was too much.  Finally it was time to pay the bill.  The waitress came over to say she had good news.  The griot plate is actually $10, not $12.50.  We thought it was a great deal.  That was until the bill arrived.  They charged us $12.50 for the rice and beans.  It wasn't like there was a lot either.  There was enough for 1 person.  We thought it  must have been a mistake and asked the waitress.  She was not sure and said she had to ask her mother, the chef.  Her mother then proceeded to come out and tell us the same thing.  A side of rice and beans is $12.50.  How can a small plate of white rice with black bean sauce cost more than a plate of griot, plaintains, and akra?  My guess is that the griot plate with a side of rice and beans is supposed to be $12.50 while without is $10.  I suggested this but was told an order of white rice and beans is $12.50.  I have no idea how they would come up with that price.  Most Haitian restaurants I have ever been to do not charge for rice and beans.  If they do, it is a couple of dollars max.\\n\\nI won't say don't go to this place, because the owners are friendly, and the food is good, but don't expect to find what you want on the menu or have any clue what you'll be paying until they come up with some arbitrary price.  I know for sure I will never go back based on our experience."},{"name":"Ingrid's Scandinavian Food","address":"2500 SE 28th Pl","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"This place had authentic Swedish meatballs...enough said.

I should have taken a photo as the presentation was laughable.  The scallops were slightly over cooked and they weren't really wrapped as the bacon had come off the scallops, so I guess they don't use toothpicks to help? Then they were just plopped on top of a mound of greenery with some tomatoes, cheese and capers.  I should have stopped right there with food ordering but it was dinner time and was hoping for the best.... I'm an eternal optimist.  I should be a pessimist more often.  It might save me money.\\n\\nFor my main course I ordered the Tri tip, which was a daily special.  The Tri tip was chewy and covered in a sweet balsamic reduction I believe. I know it would have paired better with a savory reduction.  It came with veggies that were covered in some sort of sauce (maybe the same?) but it worked with the veggies and then a twice baked potato.  I ate the veggies and potato and ignored the beef.  That bad.  \\n\\nLast up was a apple crisp with ice cream.  It wasn't warm nor was it flavorful.  Now that I think back about it, I don't there there was much apples in it either.  Just a lot of crisp topping.  To help with the bland flavor, I told my friend to put a bit of salt on it to help bring out more flavors.

My dad made yearly trips to this far off magical land called Columbus (little me had no grasp on time lapses yet), and he spoke of this gastronomical Mecca named North Market. When I was 12 years old, I was finally allowed to make a trip to Columbus with my dad, and he introduced me to what would become my adult love affair with city markets and basically anywhere I could get a eclectic mix of quality foods. \\n\\nI've eaten far too many Pastaria combinations to count. I've tried every flavor of Jeni's ice cream. I've downed Le Vian's pho by the gallon.

The mushroom quesadillas were stuffed with baby bellas and goat cheese.  Mini tacos, mini tostadas, and queso flameado weren't bad either.

OK, granted, the sorbet is supposed to be cold, and the waiter told us that the crab dish was supposed to be room temperature.  But everything else we ate tasted like it had been prepared an hour earlier and sitting in the bowl/plate until it was set down before us.\\n\\nBut even more disappointing on this special night ($75/pp...not even counting drinks) was the customer service \\"effort\\".  Our waiter never came to ask us how our courses were.  He would quickly recite what was being served before disappearing.  It would have been super helpful for him to point out to us NOT to eat the couscous-looking stuff underneath the tiny clam (that my companion had to frantically spit out when she had eaten it...since it was pure rock salt and clover).  We later recalled how the waiter played up an attractive bottle of wine before barely slipping in that the wine was $300 (so we imagine someone probably made the mistake of ordering a $300 bottle that night).  We had to flag down someone just to get a water refill, as nobody ever came by (and we were seated almost in the center of the restaurant).  As we drove away, we saw 8 of the wait staff hanging around the parking lot smoking and having a good time; we were astonished that they could have 8 employees on a break when we got very dismal service inside.\\n\\nI won't generalize whether the food and service are this disappointing on a non-holiday (mind you, the restaurant was maybe 60% full while we were there for 2.5 hours--and we had taken the dessert to go, because by then, it was 11:00pm).

Amazing flavors, good prices, bit of a chicken-water taste on the chicken in 1 out of 8 dishes. Could have been a fluke.\\n\\nFirstly, all I can think when I see the sign is \\"There can be only one.\\" I needed to get that out of the way up front or else spend the rest of the review talking about Sean Connery.\\n\\nPRICES/PORTIONS: This was one thing that made me hesitate based on reviews. However, the MOST EXPENSIVE THING ON THE MENU IS $16 ($14-20 is a bad dream at best and a lazy lie at worst). Prices and portions are commensurate with every other Thai place in the area. Nothing is overpriced, the portions for lunch are the reasonable though, I find that they're less full of fluff than other places and, maybe, if your idea of a delicious lunch is a pile of onions and bell peppers, you're missing out compared to other spots.\\n\\nShort version is: Prices are good, exactly the same as other thai places all over Beaverton/Tigard/Hillsboro. Portions are fine, comparable to other places in that price range. Our two person lunch WITH two thai teas and an appetizer was $23. Great lunch spot.\\n\\nFOOD: This is a place where Thailander swiftly beheads the competition, as that is the only way to kill another Thailander I'M NOT APOLOGIZING FOR HIGHLANDER REFERENCES DON'T TRY TO MAKE ME THIS IS MY REVIEW NOT YOURS LEAVE ME ALONE I'LL TELL THE TEACHER IF YOU DON'T STOP BEING MEAN\\n\\nAnyway, the food is really quite something. This is no cookie cutter Thai place. The recipes are a cut above for flavor. There's real depth to everything I've eaten and the flavors aren't the same tepid do-overs with a different ambiance. The cashew chicken is unique and rich, same as the completely unique spicy basil. Really, the stir fry dishes cannot be overstated in both flavor and execution. No runny, oily sauces here. Well-coated meat and vegetables in sauces that makes themselves known from the second they hit the table. The phad see ew is likewise unique, making for an interesting diversion from the normal sweet-soy heavy flavors of the average thai place. It's hard to work over the flavors without having taken notes and I'm too lazy to write and eat at the same time. This is America. I won't be seen writing when I could be eating more food.\\n\\nThe thai teas are amazing. The thai green tea in particular. Has a wonderful muscat flavor that I'm tired of writing this part of the review and I'm going on to the next section now.\\n\\nAMBIANCE: Set against alternately against the backdrops of 1980s NYC and medieval Scotland, it's hard to find fault with the feel of things. Between idyllic lochs and the gritty streets of a city under siege by crime, excess, and drug-fueled problems at every strata, the feel of things swings us between a yearning for the mystical beauty of ages past and the oppressively tense jungle of concrete and cold winds.\\n\\nThat whole thing was about Highlander. The inside of Thailander is nice. I liked it. Looks good. Thai culture through the lens of Americana. Good choice. Music's not too loud either. And with a pitch perfect score by composer Michael Kamen as well as songs written by Queen to match the scenes they feature in, it's hard to go wrong.\\n\\nCONCLUSIONS: Seriously, go watch Highlander. It's really a great film. And when you're done watch Mortal Kombat. If you can't enjoy Christopher Lambert, I don't know how to help you.\\n\\nAlso, Thailander is really good.

The rack of lamb- best I have ever had, and I have been everywhere in orlando.  It is a great value.  We also had the charcuterie board which was great and enough for 4 people to munch on. I went on a couples date and everyone had a great time.  This restaurant has a huge WOW factor.  Coming here, makes you forget your NOT on vacation.  Great place for the locals.

I was hyped up after the good reviews and watching it on Shark Tank. As a vegetarian, options at restaurants like these are very limited so I went with an open mind. However, I saw red flags as soon as I stepped in. For relatively small portions, it cost $8. Now when I mean small portions, I mean 1/2 of a Chipotle Bowl and I can get a Chipotle Bowl for $6.50. But anyways that's a minor issue. For vegetarians, the only protein is Tofu, which I ordered. After a couple of minutes of piling raw veggies on top, I came out with a my Chi'lantro bowl. And...it was pretty lackluster. Tasted like a salad with some sourness coming from the kimchi and the pickled veggies. Not horrible, but it wasn't special or anything that remotely stood out. For all the hype that I heard about, it did not deliver. BUT, this is my opinion for the vegetarian options. Maybe the meat options provide better flavors and balance the dish. Hopefully that's the case. Also the Original Kimchi Fries came out pretty soggy and did not really add anything. It tasted...well, like french fries and veggies covered with a very sour vinaigrette."},{"name":"Freshii","address":"24 School St","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"Freshii is good.

The flight got in late and by the time we drove out from the airport into Buckhead, it was late.  Bistro Niko serves until quite late and that is a definite plus.  \\n\\nThe menu is typical bistro/ brasserie fare. There is nothing particularly original about the menu.  One can only hope that the classics are interpreted well.  IMHO, having travelled frequently throughout France, this was a disappointment.  The atmosphere is right but the food is a so-so interpretation of French bistro fare.  Not bad -- but not special.\\n\\nWe had the beet salad to start and asked them to split the dish.  I am lactose intolerant and specifically asked to put the cheese on the other plate.  The dish was split beautifully but, alas, the instruction to put the cheese on the other plate was ignored.\\n\\nWe ordered a daily special appetizer of deep fried oysters.  It was a disappointment.  There was so much batter that it was hard to tell whether there were any oysters.  Certainly didn't taste any.  The garnish overwhelmed the dish.  \\n\\nThe breast of duck was pleasant but we ordered it medium rare and it came closer to medium-well done.  Chewy.  \\n\\nThe wine list was more than adequate.  Good range of choices with good range of pricing.\\n\\nWhere the restaurant excelled for our experience was in service.  Our server was friendly, articulate, helpful.  He made up for the indifferent food.  He checked in on us as frequently as he needed to without us feeling he was being intrusive.  He clearly enjoys working for Bistro Niko and enjoys people.\\n\\nThe restaurant has a number of dining spaces -- outdoors, indoors in the front room near the bar with high ceilings, and yet another indoor space across from the kitchen that is more intimate.  We arrived late at night and that room was pretty much cleared out.  It was quiet where you can carry on a conversation without raising your voice.  The front of the house was clearly more boisterous.  Typical bistro -- bustling and noisy.  A good scene.  Outdoors seemed quite pleasant but we imagined it would be noisy and not particularly healthy being right on the busy, high traffic street.\\n\\nJust one nit-picking thing -- we approached the restaurant from the porte cochere of the hotel.  There was no sign above or on the door of the restaurant.  So we walked all the way around to the entrance from the street, only to learn that the maitre d' station was all the way in the back near that unmarked entrance.

About once every month, they use specialty meats, like gator and camel, to make a limited-run sausage. They also smoke whole pigs from time to time (and a whole alligator for Mardi Gras).

Sadly, I don't live in Colorado anymore, but I'm visiting and my latest visit is inspiring me to write a review. I don't do 5 stars very often, but a combination of flavor, service, and location did it for me. If this place we're in Austin,TX and competing with the likes of Franklins and la bbq, then it's 4 stars. But when this is the best bbq in 1000+ mile radius, I'm gonna give it 5 stars.\\n\\nMy personal favorite is pork belly. Consistently melts in your mouth and full of flavor, you won't find this anywhere in austin, tx. Pork belly here is my all time #1 in bbq. Beef sausage is unique and special. Smoked catfish is SPECIAL and high quality. Smoked salmon is really good, but I've had better. Smoked turkey is okay, probably wouldn't order it again because all the other stuff is so much better. Pork shoulder (pulled pork) is almost perfect; they just kinda grab at it and give you a portion when places like la bbq in Austin, TX meticulously balance and mix fat and meat when serving. Pork ribs are a bit sweet for my palette, but smoked to perfection. The brisket is above average by Texas standards, but easily falls short of the legendary franklins. That being said, there is no shame in falling short of franklins here because it's still very good. Order the moist brisket and eat the part that's above the layer of fat in the slice. That part is perfection while the rest of it is just good. The sides are very average, though the mac and cheese is on the higher end of average.

If you've been to every Vietnamese and Thai restaurant between Bumby and Highland, and want a change without making the trek out to Maitland for Korean fare, or the hinterlands where all the Indian places are inexplicably located, this is a decent option. I got the distinct impression that the place is Malaysian-inspired. Several dishes have names that call up that country. Without a lot of Malaysian options in Orlando, this should fit nicely in our growing multicultural dining portfolio. The theme is literally \\"asian street meat.\\" Don't go in thinking Ravenous Pig (orlando's other gastropub) and the name might be a bit of a misnomer by comparison. This place is cheap, easy, and fun.  \\n\\nBest way to enjoy this place would be to go with a small group, try a bunch of things, and hang out for a while drinking. I think that is the point, anyway.  \\n\\nFirst off on the plusses:\\n1) As far as I can tell nothing on the menu is more than 6 dollars (up to 8 if you add stuff, like shrimp & calamari, to a couple menu items). Two people can go, have drinks and share 4 menu items for around 30 dollars. Not much to complain about price wise at all.\\n\\n2) there are two ways to eat here: either you do tapas style small portions, or do two medium-ish sized portions and an app. It's pretty flexible and you could easily go lite and spend 10 bucks or go heavy on a leisurely meal with friends and get 10 things, still spending around 40-50 dollars total (excluding alcohol). \\n\\n3) The beer menu is fairly impressive. I always find it weird that asian places seem to stick to the top 4-5 random asian beers (Asahi is sadly missing here in that category) but they have everything from big belgian style beers to local Orlando Brewery beer (I had the Old Pelican pale ale, which was quite nice), along with the usual Tiger, Singha, Tsingtao, etc. \\n\\n4) everything I had was nicely prepared and tasty. I had a malaysian bread and curry appetizer (which should have mentioned the presence of meat but did not) noodle and prawn soup. My wife had spring rolls and tofu curry. Both were quite good, fresh, and the soup had a nice spice to it. \\n \\n\\nOn the down side: \\n1) the floor arrangements could use some work. I think the physical space is a bit of a hamper to the overall flow. We got seated in the front, which, if anyone had been next to us, I would have had to get up every time they wanted to go to the bathroom. It probably makes the servers' jobs a bit harder than necessary. \\n\\n2) I'm not a huge fan of having big TV's everywhere unless you are going to be showing something meaningfully related to the establishment. So it's fine when you are in a sports bar and have sports on the TV. However, on a Wednesday night, we were subjected to a rather gross episode of \\"the doctors,\\" one of those crap infomercials masquerading as a talk show about \\"health.\\" No big deal, I just think that TVs are a distraction; if I'm in a Malaysian restaurant and it's not Malaysian pop stars singing in Malay, or some sporting event, I'm not really sure what the point is. \\n\\n3) The seats are a bit uncomfortable. It's got that \\"hip urban\\" vibe big-time. Lots of short-backed flat chairs, tons of high tops.  Flat, tall bench seating along the walls. Definitely more about how it looks than how it feels. Could use some retooling. Maybe some cushions. \\n\\n4) Rice my wife asked for was clearly a bit \\"aged.\\" But any restaurant at the beginning is going to do dumb stuff like safe rice too long because of costs. I suspect kinks like that will be worked out."},{"name":"Rio Grande Cantina","address":"3227 Roswell Rd NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"2.5","text":"My Toastmasters club used to go out for drinks at Rio Grande until our meetings moved to somewhere that wasn't right across the street.  I've only ever tried the salsa and the chicken soup.  Both were good.  Unlike most people, I prefer salsa that is NOT chunky, so it's nice when I find a place that serves it that way.\\n\\nThe margaritas are tasty and pack a punch.  The service can be pretty spotty, which is why I am only giving 3 stars."},{"name":"Staplehouse","address":"541 Edgewood Ave SE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Given everything I'd heard and how much I enjoy good food, I really wanted to love this place. The experience begins with the reservation process, which is a bit off-putting. It involves rushing onto the Tock website the second the reservations become available, and finding that somehow all tables are all already booked, then madly refreshing until finally something becomes available. I am not sure how the restaurant could improve this experience given the extremely high demand, but just know that it creates a stressful situation for your guests and in my opinion doesn't really start things off on the right foot. \\n\\nWe arrived a few minutes early and they weren't quite ready for us; no problem. The staff was very attentive and served us drinks while we waited for our table. I started with a gin cocktail off the menu and found it good, although a bit too sweet for my tastes. We're still definitely having a positive experience here, although I did think the pricing on this cocktail was a bit steep. As we were seated, the service continued to shine; our server was relaxed yet attentive and knowledgable. Per his recommendation, we ordered all our dishes upfront and the kitchen and staff handled the pacing expertly. Our first dish, the snapper, was my favorite by far; a small portion, yet delicate and expertly presented and all the flavors that our server described were there. There were two of us, and we got two bites each.\\n\\nThe second dish, the crab, was where things started to fall apart for me. The server described a delicate crab in an aged tomato sauce, accompanied with some greens and other flavors. The dish I tasted was warm crab meat swimming in what tasted like the sauce from a can of Chef Boyardee. The sauce totally overpowered the crab meat and all other flavors in the dish. More than the two bites that I got of this dish would have been too many. I felt that the kitchen spent more effort and attention on plating and using the types of ingredients that they wanted to or that sounded fancy, rather than on the overall flavor and composition of the dish. Our third dish, the potato bread, was excellent. The rolls were the right amount of chewy and tender and the flavor and the olive oil spread was great. The fourth dish, the beef and mushroom raviolo was also a favorite of ours, although I did find that a couple of flavors overpowered all the other things I felt like I was supposed to be tasting, namely the beef sausage, which to me wasn't balanced with the mushroom flavors.\\n\\nThe final dish was the disappointment that capped the evening. The aged beef, which was a prime ribeye had been aged for seven weeks and served atop a fermented eggplant spread and topped with onion and some other garnishes. It all was served with a beef fat emulsion which I didn't know what I was supposed to do with. This dish was so, so disappointing. The first of my two bites, I ate with the garnishes. Any flavor from the meat was extremely overpowered by the aggressive fermented flavor from the eggplant spread, which I found quite off-putting. My second bite, I ate without the spread (although the taste was still in my mouth and wasn't going anywhere) and found the meat to be quite tough and tasteless. Ultimately, I felt that I paid $41 for four bites of tough steak (which I could have sourced and prepared better myself) and some accoutrement which I did not feel appropriately complimented the (supposed) flavor or quality of the meat.\\n\\nI also found it unusual that the tasting plates are not swapped out between courses. By the time I finished the last course, my partner and I both had various sauces from all five dishes accumulated on the tasting plate. I'm sure I could have asked for a clean one, but I shouldn't have to - and I don't want to taste Chef Boyardee with my ribeye.\\n\\nSo, to sum it up, it's just not the experience we expected or the experience we felt we paid for. Three out of five dishes being good is not up to par when you're paying up to $41 for each dish; furthermore, for the dishes I didn't enjoy, I would feel comfortable saying that it was more than a matter of personal opinion. Sure, some people would like them, but I generally enjoy ribeye and crab, so I think I should have liked the ribeye and crab dishes at what is supposed to be the best restaurant in the city? And, aged prime ribeye should not be tough, or served with an overpowering fermented spread. The reservations process sours the experience from the beginning and, unfortunately, the rest didn't make up for it."},{"name":"Ichi 28 Teriyaki","address":"4804 NE Parkway Dr","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4","text":"Great teriyaki place.

But that's okay, because they started from the bottom and now they're here...getting their BComs.  \\n\\nEvery UBCer that isn't in Sauder, knows when you enter this cafe that they're about to be smacked in the face with suits who are convinced they're going to make millions, except with 0 tangible plan on how.  19 year-olds who spend their free time talking about \\"My BCom in international business\\" and \\"wine & cheese events, we party classy brah.\\"  \\n\\nBut sometimes, you need to print something at David Lam Library.  Or you're near Henry Angus, and you just need a cup of coffee for that nasty smoking habit you picked up between your 20 minute walk in the rain to your Math 300 class and the moment you realize your Prof doesn't speak any English.   \\n\\nSo, you head to the Timmy's nearby but the line is out the door, and you don't want to overpay on a soggy food from White Spot.  So you're out of options, and now you're here.  Your day started at the bottom, BUT NOW WE'RE HERE.  \\n\\nThe floor where Cafe Exchange is located is the main hangout of all BCom students between classes.  It's next to their main study area and group meeting rooms.  If you talk to anyone, be ready for conversations about  1)  Money  2) Internships & Money  3)  Real Estate & Money.  It's okay, though most of the girls here are status oriented, but they're friendly cuz they're good girls and they knowwww it dun duhhh dunn.      \\n\\nIf you meet an MBA or Masters in Management student here, it'll be exactly like a good Drake song.  The beat's great, but pay no attention to the lyrics or what they say.  You can do that, and everything becomes more enjoyable during your coffee break.   \\n \\nIt's right next to White Spot and Tim Hortons, so no one really eats here.  It's typical pre-made UBC Food anyways, so I wouldn't order food here unless you're in dire need.     \\n\\nThe staff is efficient, especially the student workers.  If you need coffee fast, this is the place to be.  There are sofas and outlets all around this area that are clean and comfy.  The cafe has 2  flatscreen TVs airing TSN or Sportsnet.  No matter what time of year, there's always room on this floor or the floor above to study.\\n\\nhttp://gracebiskie.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Started-From-the-Bottom-08.jpg"},{"name":"Uno Pizzeria & Grill","address":"Kenmore Square, 645 Beacon St","city":"Boston","stars":"2.5","text":"Went with friends for drinks and food.

I wasn't in a hurry but the service was pretty slow all around.   They took about 20 minutes to even get water to my dog.  I did like the fact they were cooking special dog entrees.  The servers, or SOMEONE, needed to address the issue of unfriendly snappy little dogs.   At the table next to mine, the dogs were growling and snarling at every dog that would walk by.  One of them actually snapped at my dog and tried to bite him.  Thank god he was not in the mood to attack back or there would have been quite a scene.  People never cease to amaze me.  Why would you bring a dog that ISNT friendly to a public place where there are numerous other dogs?

My favorite, which is no longer on the menu, was the Nolio, a pizza topped with prosciutto, caramelized onions, and a lemon pepper cream sauce.  At least the individual toppings are available, so I can still order that combination.\\n\\nThey also have really tasty entrees and pastas too.  Any of the veal or chicken entrees are great.

I mean, how am I supposed to rate arguably the most popular and busy spot in the city?\\n\\nFor one thing, I used to work across the street from Fanueil Hall/Quincy Market. From a Bostonian's point of view, this place is an expensive tourist trap full of overpriced, overworked vendors plating generic food to the 230,120,327 people who visit daily on vacation, outings, and field trips.\\n\\nI was young and naive and spent way, way too much money on mediocre sushi and soul-less chowder. (I like my soups and stews to be made and served to me with love! I feel no such thing from the staff at a number of the bigger shops inside.)\\n\\nFrom a tourist's point of view, be prepared for an experience - good and bad. The bad is that it is incredibly busy and crowded. If you're not used to this kind of thing, you may be overwhelmed. In peak times (lunch, for example) you are going to fight for a place to sit and eat your meal. Recommendation: walk and eat. Also, it won't be cheap; but, then again, nothing in a big city is going to be cheap.\\n\\nThe good for you tourists is that there are so many options, your head will spin. There are some tasty things you'll want to eat (chowder, lobster rolls, gelato, etc.) and some points of interest that you will want photos at (statue of Sam Adams, the State House, the number of very old original signs from when this was a small market, the \\"Cheers\\" sign, etc.). There are street performers, plenty of music, and you're on two subway lines (and an easy walk to Government Center, Boston Common, lots of old cemeteries, and plenty of other sights).\\n\\nOverall, I like coming here on the weekends.

Staff were friendly and service was good.  We ordered an Ahi Tuna Poke Bowl, Japayoki fries with chicken, and hurricane bao.\\nI would like to firstly say that other than the bao, I was not satisfied with the other items.  When we received the fries, they were already warm and way too crispy.  I was expecting the chicken to burn my mouth but it was cooled down already when I took my first bite.  It was also rock hard.  The menu did say the fries were double fried? Felt more like extra over-cooked and then left out for a while.  This made me feel like it was not freshly made or just that the dish was neglected for too long before being given it.\\nAs for the ahi tuna in the poke bowl, surprisingly this was the opposite.  I was expecting it to be cold but the tuna was a bit warm to cool.  Also a sign that this may have been left out for a while instead of from the fridge or something.  The bowl didn't really have much flavour.  The tuna had some of the dressing/sauce but overall was very plain.  It had rice, carrots, ginger, seaweed, crispy vermicelli(way too many), and bean sprouts(also way too many).  I think the crispy stuff is more of a garnish and shouldn't flood the top of the bowl.  I dug and moved all of it to the side and dug for the rice and tuna.\\nIf you want a proper ahi tuna poke bowl, I recommend Shishinori just 5 min away.  Price is less but it tastes way better for a \\"Hawaiian/Japanese\\n\\nWill I come back?  Probably... \\nWill I order the any of the poke bowls?  Probably not a chance.\\nStaff are great!

We quickly noticed the cups were actually leaking out the seams, which usually only happens when you've had coffee in them for awhile. So we tell the waitress when she finally comes by. She just brings us a second paper cup to double cup them. Now, I can see using paper cups in the tent outside, but in the restaurant? The restaurant wasn't overcrowded or anything.

Lansdowne sends out an email saying they are accepting reservations for the Bruins Game 7.\\n2. I make a reservation via email with girl named Deanna.\\n3.  I arrive, and hostess says there's no reservation under my name.\\n4. I show hostess email confirming reservation, she still says no.\\n5. But wait, what about my email confirmation???\\n6. GM calls Deanna, who says that I never confirmed my reservation.\\n7. I show hostess/GM the email for the 2nd time, where my reservation was confirmed.  \\n8. Hostess still says I don't have a reservation.\\n9. GM says she can seat me at a bar table facing the wall, with no TV in clear sight, even if I turn around.\\n10. During Bruins Game 7? Really? Facing the wall? \\n10. More arguing.\\n11. Eventually sit down at bar tables. Bad idea.\\n12. GM says she'll comp us 2 rounds of drinks.\\n\\nScenario 2: Dinner (or something like that)\\n1. 6:50pm Order 1st round of drinks; drinks arrive\\n2. Try to order dinner; waitress hasn't come by our table again\\n3. 7:30 - Still no waitress - even though we tried flagging her down, tapping her and asking other people/staff to get her attention\\n4. 7:30-8:20pm - Ask 3 different waitresses to take our order; everyone says they can't; they tell our waitress to come by; she completely ignores us \\n5. 8:15pm - Tell Manager that we've been waiting over an hour to order; manager makes other waitress take order; 2/3 of food order arrive after 30 minutes but drinks don't arrive\\n6. 9pm No drinks still\\n7. Original waitress comes by asking if we need anything (for the first time since 6:50); yes, we need our drinks and water\\n8. No drinks still\\n9. No water still\\n10.

I had been to Grumps one other time for an after work function and remembered how I liked the solid array of apps we ordered so I thought it was worth another shot.  \\n\\nI asked for a booth from the pleasant hostess after walking by the outside patio and seeing that it was full.  Why they only have 4-5 tables out there, I'm not sure.  It was quiet for being the middle of the week and beyond a screaming child in a booth on the other side of the restaurant we couldn't even see, I enjoyed being alone in the corner with a slightly packed bar, plenty of TV's around for those looking to catch some Boston sporting event.\\n\\nOur menus were brought to us promptly and our waitress was great about 90% of the time until she seemed overwhelmed at the end of our meal and didn't come to offer us our check for a good 20 minutes.  She looked busy so I won't dock her for it but a nice, \\"I'll be with you in a few minutes\\" would have sufficed instead of being ignored.  \\n\\nWe each ordered just an entree and were very pleased with what we got.  The future wifey picked up a shepard's pie that was fairly authentic, even though she didn't add the offered colcannon.  I wanted something a little \\"lighter\\" so I went with the chicken and grilled pear on focaccia.  Outstanding for an Irish pub and I would definitely return just to get this again.  The onion rings accoutrement were perfectly golden crispy and flavored perfectly, again spot on for pub fare.  \\n\\nSo beyond the minor slip up from the waitress at the end the overall experience and quality of the food went above and beyond what I would have expected.  I wasn't in the biggest drinking mood but would love to return again to try some of their well sized craft beer selection.  Score some bonus points for the movie quality free popcorn offered up as well, although I know it's there so people order more drinks......freebies are great to see given this stupid economy."},{"name":"Tropical Smoothie Cafe","address":"851 S State Road 434, Unit 1000","city":"Altamonte Springs","stars":"4","text":"I really like the smoothies and food available here.

They compete in contests of skill and love what they do. Just ask, and they're happy to tell you. Pourovers are available as well as honey maple lattes and cold-brewed iced coffee.

Funnily enough, it is apparently the bar where Tarantino's Death Proof was shot, which immediately made sense.\\n\\nWe were greeted by the most friendly waitress ever and shown to a quieter table away from the lively bar area. They have an extensive menu with tons of choices, but we knew we were here just for the Original Chili ($6.30 for a small). And the Frito Pie ($6.60 for a small). Ok, and some Guacamole & Chips ($3).\\n\\nThe chips and guac weren't particularly good, but they give you a massive amount of chips, which beat the regular saltines provided for the chili. As for the chili, it was really incredible. Instead of a watery, mishmash of a mess you sometimes get, this was so hearty and filled with so much beef. There were large chunks of brisket, which tasted so good mixed with the melted cheese on top.\\n\\nThe Frito Pie was nearly identical, save for the Frito chips toward the bottom. The chips were a nice added touch, and managed to stay nice and crispy even when engulfed in all that chilly, which shows how solid and thick it was.

The fact that they always have a decent beer for $3 every day is awesome.  The daily deals, like Texas pints on sale Sunday or glass nights are awesome.  Let's face it, beer is awesome.\\n\\nFood: So much better than you'd expect.  Highly recommend the Hippie Burger. Excellent fries - ask for honey mustard with them.

The biggest issue with it is it seems like an incomplete thought that shouldn't have opened yet.\\n\\nTheir whole concept is a ham and sherry bar. It was, according to our waiter, inspired by a restaurant in Washington DC of the same concept called Mockingbird Hill. The biggest difference is that a quick glance at the menu at Mockingbird Hill shows that they know what they're doing and have a solid concept, whereas Hamlet just doesn't make any sense.\\n\\nThe Drinks:\\n\\nWe had the Kojo which had Oloroso sherry, gin, falernum and grapefruit and was good but did a very poor job of showing off the sherry. We also had the Daydream, a cocktail made with Manzanilla sherry, silver tequila, Maraschino liquer, Combier Rose, and a ton of soda water. To be quite honest, it tasted like someone left out a frozen margarita from last night's Cinco de Mayo celebration and tried to pass it off the next day as a drink. Our waiter alluded to the fact that a lot of people who have ordered it had been less than thrilled with it. We also had the Melon vs Meat which gets its name from the cantaloupe juice in the drink and the dried prosciutto garnish. It was alright, but nothing to write home about. I believe that only 3 of their cocktails had any sherry in them, which seems odd considering it's their stated focus. They have a small list of sherries to order by the glass, but it's a little overpriced for the 3oz pour size and they're nothing you can't find at your local wine shop.\\n\\nThe Food:\\n\\nThe menu is horribly laid out and makes no sense until you ask the waiter to explain it. You can order some types of ham a la carte (pretty self explanatory) or do like we did and order an ambiguously named plate such as the Ham and Cheese. Our Ham and Cheese plate came with three small portions of meat, speck, prosciutto americano, and a mildly spicy ham whose name escapes me. It came with three types of Ancient Heritage cheese, some slices of baguette, fig jam, and hazelnuts. The meat was fine, and the cheeses were fine, but they didn't go together at all. For $32, you got something that you literally could have gotten at Whole Foods 2 blocks away and made at home for less. The other options on the menu were sandwiches such as a piece of baguette with butter and prosciutto, nothing too exciting.\\n\\nThe Service:\\n\\nThe service was slow, but I'm more willing to forgive that because they're so new. It just took so long to get anyone to even acknowledge we had sat down, and even longer for our drinks to be made. They had 4 servers working a very small dining room, but couldn't seem to get anything done.\\n\\nOur meal with drinks came to $63 with tip, and it just really didn't feel worth it and I can't imagine that changing without some major alterations to their restaurant. They're part of the ChefStable group and have a lot of experience with restaurants, so it's just a mystery why they'd launch something that feels like it's still in the early concept stage."},{"name":"Shiki","address":"9 Babcock St","city":"Brookline","stars":"3.5","text":"A hidden gem...on a side street... on the basement level..\\n\\nThe fish here tastes very fresh.

Not only that but letting us try sushi that is new to see what we think, free of charge.\\n\\nI have tried quite a few things on their menu and very few things have ever really missed the mark for me, the one I can remember was the chicken potstickers for being overcooked I believe.

We made a reservation at the sushi bar for a Thursday evening as we were told that is when the fish arrives from Japan and is the freshest. I'd highly recommend sitting at the sushi bar and ordering the Ito-Kase (Chef's selection). This might not be the best option if you are super picky or not willing to try new things, but we absolutely loved it.   \\n\\nTo start we were served 2 dishes; yellow tail slices with jalapeno, cilantro and ponzu and a tuna carpaccio dish that was served with onion, avocado, and soy vinaigrette. Both were really good and if I had to pick one I'd go with the yellow tail. We were then served a few pieces of shirako, which is by far the most interesting thing I have ever eaten. I asked out waitress what it was she said something about Cod. My wife tried one piece and didn't care of the texture and I had the rest.  At first I didn't like it but by my third piece it was starting to grow on me. Then I went home and through some research I found out it is actually cod sperm sac and it is considered a delicacy in Japan. If I would have known ahead of time what it was I probably would have refused to eat it, but I am glad I tried it and it was definitely interesting.\\n \\nWe were then each served a plate of nigri and all of it was really fresh and tasty. We had some yellow tail, kama toro (fatty tuna near collar), mackerel, snapper, sweet shrimp, and cobia. This was my first time trying fatty tuna and it was really good. Our waitress then came over and asked if we wanted hot courses for our next dish or more fish. We decided to try the hot dishes and I am so glad we did. One of our hot dishes was seared diver scallops in a soy ginger sauce. It was presented in a toban grill and we were told to wait till we saw steam escaping the pot and that is when it would be ready to eat. The other dish we were served was a grilled black cod marinated in miso. Both were absolutely amazing but I have to say the presentation of the diver scallops was my favorite. \\n\\nAfter the hot courses we were each brought a very generous portion of sashimi. I can't remember everything that was on the plate, but there were some new selections from the nigiri sampler we had earlier. Once again everything was super fresh and delicious. \\n\\nWe were then asked if we wanted anything else and I remembered that so many yelpers recommended getting the green tea souffl√©. The waitress said it would take some time to prepare so we decided to have a old fashioned while we waited. The souffl√© was beautifully presented and tasted even better. I highly recommend ordering it. \\n\\nWe loved everything about Umi and highly recommend it. The food, service, selections of sake and cocktails, and the ambiance are all excellent. Sure it is a little expensive but it is completely worth it and the experience was very memorable.

The crab cake was really scrumptious and good. Not as big as a I would like but it will do. The Smoke Salmon was good too. Not as good as the crab cake though. :D\\n\\nFor desserts I had the Maple Bourbon Creme Brulee with Applewood Bacon Brittle. I didn't like it as much because the Applewood Bacon Brittle was bitter.

My first date went so well I moved in with the guy and we're still together a year later!  So I figured it was time to review this place again.  We go to Salsa's pretty frequently, and it's the same story every time:  Amazing, great, delicious food.  Slow, sub-par service.  Tonight was no different.  They got my friend's dinner order completely wrong and had to go back and cook him a whole new meal.  The waitress blamed it on the Spanish to English language barrier between the waitstaff and the kitchen.  Mmmkkay.  By the time my friend got his food the rest of us were done eating, so obviously we were not happy.  We also had to ask where the heck our chips and salsa were since the meals came and we still had no chips and salsa!  We also waited almost 30 minutes to get another pitcher of sangria.  Wasn't loving that either.  So why do I keep going back?  Well, the food is delicious, plain and simple.  Ultimately, our waitress accepted responsibility for messing up my friend's dinner order, and took his meal off the bill, so I do feel they righted the situation.  I just really wish this place would get a manager to get the service flowing better.  Some nights there doesn't even appear to be a dedicated bartender.  I have seen waitresses just walking behind the bar to make the drinks themselves.  What kind of system is this?  Oh Salsa's, maybe someday you'll get the service together so I can actually give you the 5 stars that the food deserves.   Cause it's really freakin good.

It was ok. We also ordered the Ceviche, the menu's explanation is: fresh shrimps, roma tomatoes, cilantro, onions, celery, and squeezed lime served in a 45oz margarita glass. Sounds delicious right??? WRONG!! We had avocado in that mix, A LOT of advocado and barely any shrimps, with no flavor whatsoever and the margarita glass was missing! I even had to ask the server for extra limes to add flavor to that mix! I did not realize the description of that appetizer until I got home and re-read the menu since my brother had originally ordered it. How disappointed I was.

It's made even more awkward by the fact that this is the Ponce City Market location, a haven for some of the best bites in Atlanta. My suggestion is to eat in PCM before you go to a show - you'll get twice as much food, that tastes ten times better, for half the price. \\n\\nI'm a concert photographer so I see dozens of shows per year.

While being up on the platform is nice and it's the only real way to have a table for two guaranteed, you are really shoved in there. Enough so that I *literally* could not cross or uncross my legs once I was seated.\\n\\nOur server, friendly and attentive as he was, couldn't take care of us table side because the tables and people were so close together - so we were handed our drinks over the railing. Not exactly what you expect or want when you are paying $10+ for a house glass of wine and often into the $50+ for a bottle (and when you've paid to be seated in VIP).\\n\\nThe hard wood chairs are uncomfortable beyond words, made even worse by the notion that you can't move around even a small amount without disrupting everyone around you.\\n\\nThe talent this location attracts is fantastic, but unless it's someone on my bucket list, I'm unlikely to go back. The service, even with it's limitations was fantastic. But that's hard to remember when you can't so much as use the restroom without making four or five other tables stand up to let you by, and you can't even adjust in your own chair because the seating is so tight.\\n \\nMy advice to management - put felt pads on the bottom of the chairs so people don't make oodles of noise. Remove even two tables from the VIP section so people can use the restroom without disrupting everyone else - AND - so that your servers can deliver drinks to the table without having to hand things over a rail.  \\n\\nThis is a sorely needed concept in Atlanta, but right now I would only recommend it with hesitation."},{"name":"Flying Saucer Draught Emporium","address":"815 W 47th St","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"Let it be known that I am straight.

They have whole wheat or multi-grain crust (still pretty tasty), low fat cheese (you can tell because it doesn't drip fat), and fresh ingredients (a huge list of choices).\\n\\nNow you can order from the \\"extra healthy\\" part of their menu.  This has options like the Body Fit (157 cals, 6g fat, 14g carbs, 14g protein per slice and $12.49 for a medium), which is basically just sauce, cheese, and chicken.  I order this on those rare nights when I crave pizza post-workout.  Truth be told, they go very light on the cheese, so it's not the great tasting pizza ever.  But I sprinkle some hot sauce all over and it satisfies me just fine when a protein shake or a piece of salmon won't cut it.\\n\\nOr you can make your own pizza from their many ingredients.  I only have to assume that when you make your own pizza, it's not AS healthy, because they use a generous amount of cheese.  But I also have to assume that it's healthier than ordering from anywhere else, because they use whole wheat crust and low fat cheese.  I order these after a long night out when I don't care much about being super healthy, but I also don't want overly greasy disgusting pizza that will make my stomach turn.  These pizzas taste GREAT.  My favorites: hot peppers/bacon/pineapple and ham/tomato/pesto sauce.  Avoid green peppers and ask for the tomatoes chopped (not a fan of sliced).\\n\\nThe pizzas are a little expensive, but totally worth it.  Assume close to $20 with tip for a medium (serves 2).  The delivery guys are so nice though, and they come to your place really fast (sometimes in as little as 20 minutes), but then again, I don't live that far from them.

Ever find yourself wide awake at 5 am with your mind alight with thoughts and ideas? This morning was one of those mornings. Although my wife could have used a few more hours comingling with the sandman, she was beautifully understanding about my state and we talked the vital hours away.  This of course is hungry work so I suggested we get up and find a diner that was open early (I told you my mind was alight!)\\nCollectively we came up with a whopping two diners that we knew of and both in the land that rains parking tickets (Boston) so we consulted Yelp and up pops the Sunny Diner.\\nThe Sunny Diner is a modest Central Square nook of a place tucked away on Landsdowne St. in the shadow of what used to be the old Necco factory (now Novartis [boo]). I have passed this place a hundred times and have only afforded it a passing glance. Inside is cozy, clean and colorful with the classic diner stools and counter on the left and a row of four tops along the right. It is everything you wish a diner to be - classic and simple menu, cheap, relaxed and friendly.  We had the sunny side special - two eggs any style with wheat toast and homefries. It was straight up and simple and, to my surprise, Sunny Diner has taken the 'greasy' out of 'greasy spoon'. The toast was only lightly buttered, the eggs unadulterated, and the homefries fresh and dry (a good thing). The only criticism from our table was the use of paprika for the homefries. Although the use of paprika has always been a head scratcher for me, I have never really had a big problem with it, but my wife dislikes the taste so her potatoes went uneaten.

I'm a 2-time member of the Ring of Honor. But something happened in the last year and I have found that I never go there anymore except for the rare occassion when a friend really wants to meet there. And that is their 6-drink maximum rule. Even if you're not going to be driving, or have spent 12 hours drinking those 6 drinks, or do not appear impaired, you will be cut off after 6. It's not that I've been inconvenienced by this rule at all, but I hate the whole concept behind it. There were obviously some lawyers involved and it reinforces that we are a nation of dumbasses instead of taking responsibility for an individual's actions. On one of my last visits I mentioned to the server that I object to their 6-drink maximum rule and she replied that they're just trying to keep everyone safe. Oh yeah? Then don't run a business that sells alcohol to people!  It's a chickenshit rule to protect the management from allegations of overserving anyone while being powerless to actually effectively enforce (my buddy can order a drink and then give it to me.) If the owners of this place had any backbone they would stand by their staff's professional ability to judge when someone has had too much. So much irony for a bar that actually rewards drinking.\\n\\nThe beer selection is pretty decent and the weekly specials are ok, and the servers are knowledgable and pleasant. But when there's so many other places that are cheaper, have better food and will treat you like a mature person, why bother?

The rest of the dining room (all walls) are adorned with cedar planks that have been done in the traditional Japanese \\"shou sugi ban\\" method. They are gorgeous.

The chandeliers are modern, silver geometric orbs that give off just enough light so you can see, but still keep it sexy. \\n\\nThe walls are decorated with huge pre ww2 photos that the owner actually found the negatives in a field in Japan . He had them developed then enlarged. They are amazing. \\n\\nThe food was innovative, fresh, delicious. All I can say about the food to convey how exquisite it was is this: \\n\\nSoto the vacuum you left in Atlanta with your departure has generously been filled by Umi. \\n\\nI will certainly return.  The manager, Mr. Tan is gracious, friendly, and constantly circulates the dining room like a shark.

Whether it's delivery or at the restaurant, just don't expect top notch service. That said, this place still is great because they aren't spitting in your food, they're just a little slow, and the food MORE than makes up for any lapse in service. Order things you aren't familiar with, you're gonna be in for a treat, I highly suggest the Malai Kofta for instance, and the Poori is spectacular. \\n\\nSo back to my warning about the service, what prompted me to write this review is that we got delivery and the order only came with half of what we ordered. We called the restaurant to let them know, thinking they might just adjust the bill (they did) but to our surprise they delivered our FULL order half an hour later to our place, no charge. In all my years of eating, which is alot, that was my first time getting a full order on the house after having my bill adjusted. And we're on the East side (yes they deliver here!) so it wasn't just a short drive from their location. \\n\\nMadras is great, they're so great I've been half-jokingly suggesting that they cater my wedding, but even if that doesn't happen I'll continue to support this great place until they put a condo there."},{"name":"H Harper Station","address":"904 Memorial Dr SE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3.5","text":"I really wanted to like this place, I really did; I've loved the idea of this location for years, and a blogger meet up gave me my opportunity to finally check out the new business in this space. First and foremost, it's just simply overpriced. Someone should really talk to them about price points; the economy is still in a bad place, and most people just don't want to pay that extra few dollars for something that can get just as good, and cheaper somewhere else. That may not be the case for everyone, but it is definitely something that I am sure I am not alone in thinking about. A few dollars here and there adds up, and in this case, where it becomes more noticeable, is when I am paying the extra money, I expect a little bit more.\\n\\nWhile the staff was nice, the service was REALLY slow, and it was more noticeable because of how hot the restaurant was. We ordered a third round of drinks at the end of our meal, and I honestly thought they had to go out back and make the whiskey it took so long. It was written all over the server's face too; you could tell he was really embarrassed by how long the bar took to make simple drinks. Again, you expect a bit more when you pay more for something. \\n\\nThe food was simply not worth the aforementioned price point. If you are going to charge $11 for a simple burger, it needs to be at least a decent burger; both of a decent size and taste. Mine was not. In fact, I had to almost force myself to finish it (I was determined to, because it was $11 after all). It wasn't good at all; and it was on the small size. They added pulled pork to the top, which was cute, but really detracted from it over all; I ate that separately. Add to all that, I had to keep asking for ketchup; am I wrong in assuming that people usually want ketchup for their burger (and side of tater tots)? I just thought it was odd that I had to end up waiting for what seemed like forever to get more ketchup (which comes with almost the bare minimum on a little saucer by request only. Again, here we are with those higher expectations. \\n\\nOverall, I had fun, because I was with great friends, and the staff were nice, even though they were really, really slow; the restaurant was practically empty and we all commented several times on the whereabouts of our server. A friend and I did share a punch bowl, which in hindsight may have been what put the dollar signs in my mind about the night; because they aren't cheap at $40 each. Overall, it was a good experience, but one that will not be good enough to have me go back. The menu is extremely limited, and overpriced, and the drinks are right up there as well. I'm sure this will be no problem for others, but it just didn't work out for me."},{"name":"Flying Saucer Draught Emporium","address":"815 W 47th St","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"Would rate 4 stars if it wasn't for the rude doorman.

The last two times I was there (early on Fridays) they've been 'sold-out' of my selections pry five times. It's not that huge of deal, but when you come for the rare and its non-existent, its pretty disappointing.\\n\\nThe waitresses here are pretty slow, but you don't come to a Beer-venue demanding new beers every second. Some are more knowledgeable than others and they do pretty good overall. \\n\\nI have never bought food here. It doesn't look all that appetizing (I'm peaking your food before it gets to your table).\\n\\nThey have darts (hooray) and just enough atmosphere to keep me from complaining.\\n\\nAll in all its an OK place to drink beer (= 3 stars). If they introduced some more fresh beers, or had weeks where they sponsored breweries (Dogfishhead come to Austin again), I'd be game to changing my rating."},{"name":"North Market","address":"59 Spruce St","city":"Columbus","stars":"4.5","text":"On the spendy side, but they have so much variety and high-quality products, it's money well-spent."},{"name":"Soul Vegetarian No  2","address":"652 N Highland Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3.5","text":"this place rocks! i had a vegan lasagna, came with sweet potatoes, spinach and a salad as sides. also had their soup of the day, orange lentils. delicious! very friendly staff, I'm going back there any time I'm in hotlanta for sure!\\n\\ndon't come to this place if you're in a rush."},{"name":"K Restaurant","address":"100 Lynn St","city":"Peabody","stars":"5","text":"First timers.

They have a very varied menu though including many eggs benedict options and a delicious sweet pepper hash. The fresh fruit plate is huge and is a really nice mix. They offer fresh yogurt and granola since we're talking healthy options.\\n  \\n Many of the plates come with your choice of home fries or a garlic mashed. The garlic mashed are great but for me it's more of a lunch/dinner option. The home fries are good too, nicely seasoned.\\n   \\nOne thing I can't recommend here are the muffins.

I am so glad I found this place because I can't believe Atlanta has a great sushi spot that's up to par with some of the great sushi spots in San Francisco. It was great to have quality chats with Chef Ito and his staff as they prepared my Omakase meal + order of a Junmai sake (which ended up being $150 before excluding tips). I'd been to Atlanta a few times and grew tired of the typical, heavy Southern/Southern-style cuisine that the area is known for, so finding Umi was a treasure in delight! I'm a fan of the quality in service by the wait staff and sushi chefs, which made eating alone (and away from home) a lot less lonely. \\n\\nThere were a mix of sashimi and nigiri pieces. I had started talking to Chef Ito about how I loved the tempura in Japan and that no where in the states had I yet had anything remotely close to what I had when I was traveling in Tokyo. He personally went into the back kitchen and fried up some fresh tempura. After serving it, he waited and watched while I took my first bite. It was absolutely divine. \\n\\nThe pieces of tempura (fish and shrimp pieces) were so perfectly and lightly battered without having a ton of oil soaked like you normally would at any other establishment (haven't yet tried Tempura Matsui in NYC yet). It was so airy and fluffy without taking away from the taste of the fish and shrimp. He watched as I ate it (which made me think of a food critic's comment featured in the Jiro Dreams of Sushi documentary) and grinned ever so slightly in satisfaction as he saw a smile brimming on my face. I was like a kid in food heaven! Oh, and I can't miss out on the fact that this is the only place where I've had excellent uni. Normally, the uni you get at restaurants here are from Santa Barbara or somewhere local. The taste of it though can often be fishy and not fresh, which is why you will almost always see me never order uni anywhere. However, Chef Ito had an Uni from Japan and it was literally the best I've had in my life (I had a Santa Barbara uni afterwards which was something I wish I didn't had and was a great way to compare the differences).\\n\\nThe only reason why I didn't give Umi 5 stars was because I wish the nigiris had more flavor to them other (e.g. try changing some nigiri to be brushed with Ponzu, or incorporating yuzu salt/garlic/serrano peppers).

What stood out the most was the poor quality of training in their staff.  We had 2 tables of 7 each, and each table was going to order their own dishes.  The server took the order of the first table and then came over to take my order for our table.  He insisted that we just copy the first tables order, and I said no, I want to choose my own, yet he kept insisting.  I picked a few items and then he said oh we can add this on top, and I said on top of what?  I already told you I don't want the same menu as the other table.  What the server also neglected to tell me was some of the servings were fixed number of pieces, which my table of 7, we constantly did not have enough to go around.  Waiter should have advised me, this dish only has 6 pieces, so that I could order more so there's enough for everyone to try.  When I asked about Peking duck, he told me it serves 4 people, I said what?  How small is this duck, I said I'm only going to order it if you can make enough servings for 7 of us.  And then when the peeking duck came out, it was enough to serve both tables 14 of us.   I asked if they had pea tip veggies, he said no, but he said try this veggie dish, I said okay without really paying attention.  Well guess what, it was pea tips. The guy had no clue.  They served the wrong dishes to the wrong table.  I would say, I get better service at McDonald's than this so called fancy high end place.  At least McDonald's knows what's on their own menu.

For dinner, the wait wasn't too bad (~10-15min) at 9pm, but I was still surprised that there was still a wait so late in the night. Good thing the bar area is self seating and a beer or two will make the time pass by much faster. \\n\\nFood/drinks:\\n-roasted beets and burrata w/smoked salmon ($~16+$4.00): it was very pleasant! Large ball of burrata that's creamy and smooth on the inside but a little tough on the outside. The beets were sweet and mixed with a bed of greens. I added the smoked salmon and I would say this salad became much more with it because of the salmon. Large piece of salmon that went very well with the burrata. IMO this dish was w little strange to pair with beer, but I usually like IPA and darker beers, so maybe a light beer would've been better ? ( wheat ale)\\n-elk burger w/ garlic fries: ( ~$16+2): the burger was nice and juicy, yet simple. Good flavor. We substituted the side with garlic fries and it was decent. I think it could've been warmer to soften the parmesan cheese on top. Not too much garlic flavor to it. The Deschutes ketchup was legit though!\\n\\n-flight (6 samples for $14): good way to try the different beers they offer. They have pre-set flights or you can create your own.

We had a short wait for the table, maybe 10 minutes, not bad at all for a Saturday morning. Our waitress, Sam, was quick to take our order and bring the food out. I ordered the eggs Benedict and my boyfriend ordered the avocado, bacon, tomato omelette. We both enjoyed our food very much, and the price was right. We'll definitely be returning."},{"name":"Flying Saucer Draught Emporium","address":"815 W 47th St","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"Such a great atmosphere with a wonderful beer selection.

Two thumbs up for sure."},{"name":"Gourmands Neighborhood Pub","address":"2316 Webberville Rd","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"That's nice, we have some variety in sandwiches.  We were really hungry and it was late so we took food out.  Didn't get to enjoy the vibe in the restaurant so much.  The area was a little sketchy outside; I wouldn't recommend taking a walk.  I think if we tried other menu items, the food would be better.  Then again, I'm not much of a sandwich fan anyway."},{"name":"Ball Square Cafe","address":"708 Broadway","city":"Somerville","stars":"4.5","text":"Ball Square Cafe: \\n\\nWe were minutes from being seated at the juxtaposed Soundbytes but we peered into its former space to find the exposed brick walls, the tempting breakfast dishes, and we questioned if we were missing out and had dismissed this imposter.   Several times over the past few years we had passed over this infamous neighbor for our long established breakfast love.  We were devoted to the name that we long-associated with the pushy but respectful owner urging his customers to move on after eating so that the long line of hungry patrons could get their breakfasts on.  \\n\\nAnd on this particular morning we wondered if we had given short shrift to its neighbor and we had heard the rumors about the neighborhood disputes, the chef who had stayed on at BSC, that the food might even be better at BSC than at Soundbytes.  So that morning we took the risky move of giving up a minutes-away table to wait for a table at BSC.\\n\\nThe waiting experience was not the same.  Take away the urgency of service and you just have hungry people waiting 30 minutes for a table.  Does the more relaxed experience of eating without a hovering owner make up for the wait? Close call, but probably not.  \\n\\nWithout the urgency of service, the charm of that space has been removed, which has unexpectedly made the waiting experience much less enjoyable. Don't get me wrong - the food is quite good, equivalent to the former Soundbytes (which I had begun to question of late if the quality had declined somewhat).  But something about this unamicable divorce has taken something out of both descendent breakfast restaurants.  \\n\\nIn this case, the sum of the divided parts is not as good as the original.  It made me miss the old Soundbytes, the experience of waiting in line, coffee cup in hand, winter, summer or fall.  Waiting for the bowl of fresh fruit, the chocolate chip pancakes, knowing that we had to be efficient with our ordering and with our eating.  I wish I could go back but I will have to settle for one of these two and on most weekend mornings, I'm not sure either capture my heart the way my memory wishes they would."},{"name":"Hai Ky","address":"3736 Bee Caves Rd","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"Had a double dinner date here last Friday night.  We all enjoyed our food!  My date ordered the the Veggie Pho (17) and I had the combo Pho (1). We both loved the taste of the broth and I thought the meats were quite good.  We usually get the Bun (46), but were in the mood for a change.  My only complaint is the spring rolls.  The paper was a little tough.  Next time I'll ask that they make them fresh."},{"name":"Deschutes Brewery Portland Public House","address":"210 NW 11th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"The food is good standard pub fare.  The venue is one of the bigger ones in the Pearl and feels a bit like a ski lodge.  The size of both the bar and the restaurant make it a good option for large groups.  The bar has several TVs on which local sports (and other big games) are shown."},{"name":"Du Kuh Bee","address":"12590 SW 1st St","city":"Beaverton","stars":"4","text":"This is a great little inexpensive whole in the wall in Beaverton. The hand pulled noodles are pretty good for Portland. I gave this place 4 stars since there are a few place in Vancouver, BC which are a bit better. We got great service the 3-4 times we have been there and sometimes the service is a little slow when they were really busy but that's understandable. They would make the food really spicy if you ask them and explain to them you could handle it. The problem they have is that customers would ask for the food really spicy and then complain that the food is too hot and they can't eat it. Also korean hot peppers aren't as hot as some other varieties used in other south east asian cuisines."},{"name":"Sam Snead's Oak Grill and Tavern","address":"1801 Maitland Blvd","city":"Orlando","stars":"3.5","text":"In town for Star Wars Celebration.
