So, yes, you are in the touristy part of the North End, but you get the whole vibe and atmosphere.  The energy is awesome as you look out the window (try to get a window seat).  There is an open kitchen with a bar, and the typical North End exposed brick-style.  \\n\\nWhere I feel like the South End comes in is in the ambiance of the place. It is trendy, lively, and energetic.  It's not your typical murals-on-the-wall Italian situation.  The music is upbeat and current, the clientele is young, and the staff is young.  I loved it.\\n\\nWhen it comes to the food, bring your appetite.  It was superb.  It wasn't groundbreaking, but they take the best aspects of Italian-American cuisine and create filling, delicious meals.  The Sunday Macaroni is a meal that you will not forget anytime soon.

I've hung out right next to the Harp & Celt numerous times (at Avalon), but never made it over here before. \\n\\nWe arrived at about 7:30pm on a Friday, and there were no tables available. We were still waiting for a few people to show up anyways, so we just stood outside talking and hanging out for a little while. Every now and then a group would leave and we would rush in and see if we could snag their table. Amazingly, there were still no empty tables. I'm not really sure how that works, but whatever. \\n\\nEventually, one of the two tables outside opened up and we claimed it before anyone else could. It took a while, but a waiter finally came out and took our drink orders. He was friendly and knowledgeable and helped suggest a beer based on my preferences.\\n\\nWhile we were sitting there, a homeless guy strolled up and began to just stand next to us. He wasn't doing or saying anything, and we were half expecting him to join our conversation, but he just stood there expectantly. We ignored him figuring he would move on. After a few minutes, an employee came out and told him he had to move on, and that was the end of that. \\n\\nAs the night went on, it started getting cold. The waiter had stopped by to check on us and we asked if there were any tables empty. He said there was a table cashing out, and that if we went inside right then, we could probably jump on that before anyone else. As we went inside, a different table had just been cleared, and we grabbed that. We went ahead and asked for some menus.\\n\\nAnd waited.\\n\\nAnd waited.\\n\\nI'm not sure what happened to our waiter, but eventually, one of us got up and went to the bar and asked for some service. A minute later, a different waiter appeared and took our order. Between us, we ordered some Scottish Eggs, Fish & Chips, Pub Chips and some sort of Steak Pot Pie. The food was good, the portions were generous, and the prices were more than reasonable.

However, I will say that Shin Jung does well with their Korean cuisine and has something unique to offer among the other dining establishments in town.\\n\\nShin Jung is located on Colonial Drive between Bumby and Fern Creek and is very easy to miss if you're not paying attention. The restaurant is a small building that looks like it was once a family home with a dark green canopy over the main entrance. Inside is not very spacious with enough seating for roughly 15 to 20 groups if that. You can choose to sit in a booth or table. Some of the tables have grills built into them allowing you to cook your food yourself. This is good to do if you're in a group of four or more people, but if it's just you and another person you're better off having the kitchen do it for you. The Kitchen is also small, but Koreans are good at making the most out of their space and they've definitely done that here. \\n\\nAs for the food, it's probably the best in Central Florida, in my opinion, but I don't know that I'd go as far as to say it's the best in the nation. You will find the more popular Korean dishes on the menu which includes bulgogi, kalbi and bi bim bop. The bulgogi is beef tenderloin marinated in soy sauce, ginger, garlic, sugar and sesame oil and it usually sits for a long time or over night to let the flavor soak in. The kalbi is basically short ribs marinated the same way and there are also chicken and pork dishes with the same seasonings. When paired with rice and kim chi it's heavenly. The bi bim bop can be served in a regular bowl or a stone pot which it keeps it piping hot for awhile and is comprised of seven various Korean sides, bulgolgi, rice and a fried egg on top. You're supposed to mix it all together with a sweet hot paste...so good! There are also several soups and stews to choose from as well. Most of the dishes are spicy.\\n\\nIf you choose to dine here, I'd advise allowing more than an hour because depending on what you choose to eat it may take awhile to cook, especially if you're doing the cooking at your table. Service can be slow at times, but I assure you it's not because they're goofing off in the kitchen. It's usually because their staff isn't that big in size and they are handling more than just serving. If there is a wait when you walk in it can go quickly or fast, it's never easy to tell....all about timing I guess. They do take reservations though, so if you know you're coming that could be the way to go.\\n\\nThere are a few not-so-good points as is usual. First, it tends to get really hot in here because it's not very big in size, I don't think it's well ventilated, and the cooking in the dining room causes a lot of heat in the main area. Second, prices aren't too bad but it can get pricey if you're with a huge group. Lastly, if you are not Korean and don't have much concept of the culture you might have a rough time understanding what everything is between the menu and the servers of whom are all native Koreans.\\n\\nOverall, I say broaden your eating horizons and give it a whirl!"},{"name":"La Tapatia","address":"13450 Research Blvd","city":"Austin","stars":"3","text":"I'm not really fit to comparing with Austin's other offerings as I just breezed into town.

The third employee was the general manager who clearly was having a bad day, as he rudely snapped at me when I requested a specific table somewhat near the windows.  Understandably, my mother and I were both taken back by that, as were the people standing behind us.  Although insulted and unhappy with the table he sat us at, we decided to overlook it and stay.  A few minutes later, a young lady came over with waters for us and then walked away.  No welcoming words, no friendly smile, zip.  Two gentlemen were seated next to us and quietly whispered their disgust to us after being treated similarly.  Waters appeared at their table and they received two rolls with some dipping oil.  The server took their drink order, walked away to type it into the terminal and then disappeared (despite us sitting there ready and willing to order drinks).  She took our drink order after delivering drinks to the men next to us and still no smile or friendly words.  This is the hospitality business, yes??  We were heading to a show and we were concerned about time (and the lack of customer service), therefore we ordered dinner at the same time as we ordered our drinks.  The baked meatball appetizer was very good and piping hot.  The rolls that were delivered to our table were hard as rocks and cold.  The risotto, peas & prosciutto appetizer was good, but nothing memorable.  And although we asked the young lady that took our order if the carbonara was creamy, it was in no way creamy.  It was oily, warm (not hot) and coagulated.  My mother was so unhappy with it, she only had a few bites and left the rest.  The nicest server in the entire place (Tom) noticed my mom wasn't eating and came over to check on her.  He confirmed that their carbonara is not a creamy version and she should have been told that when she asked.  Obviously, no such luck and it just wasn't worth our time to order something different.  Tom - again, the nicest server in the place - removed it from our bill and apologized.  \\n\\nAs far as we are concerned, it was a complete waste of our time and money. Every restaurant has off nights, but it's usually in the kitchen and it's NEVER acceptable for an employee (in this case, multiple) to be rude or unfriendly to patrons.

Each dish consistently good. \\n\\nCons: PRICE, noise, temperature. \\n\\nWe went here this past weekend because we had heard about this place on the Phantom Gourmet (which we have learned is really just a long commercial for whoever pays them to review their restaurant). \\n\\nDamiano's is a newcomer to the North End. And, like all new places, they have to try to hook the public with a gimmick. Theirs is to do \\"italian-tappas\\" which I've never seen before. We thought we'd try it out. \\n\\nWe went on Saturday, during the weekend of the 99th annual Fisherman's Feast here in the North End. We went around 7PM. Streets were MOBBED. I was afraid we would have a huge wait - we had no reservation - but we were seated within 15 minutes of showing up. They do a quick turnaround here - get ya in, get ya drunk, and kick ya out. \\n\\nHot. HOT! The weather was hot and humid all day and it didn't taper off after the sun went down. This place had their front open to the street - their giant door-windows were completely open. And as a result, the restaurant was way too hot and muggy. We were sweating bullets just sitting still. That's kinda gross. \\n\\nLOUD! Holy macinoli - horrible place for a first date! I pity the couples there that were trying to talk. Impossible. I have to listen to my girl all day - so I didn't mind that I couldn't hear her for once! The music here was bizarre - like I said, a new place is trying new things so they play this bizarre techno-electronic rock? It doesn't work. Especially with their old-school black-and-white North End art on the walls. \\n\\nOK So - loud and hot. Let's get to the good stuff: \\n\\nOur waitress was great - Sara - CUTE! And she knows her stuff. She upsold me to a bottle of wine - which I did love - but I was thinking she was pretty smooth to pull that over on an old dog like me. Sucker for a pretty face, I guess. \\n\\nThey do express upon you that they \\"strongly suggest\\" you order 2-3 dishes each. OK Don't worry - we'll spend money - sheesh! Kind of annoying but I expected it. \\n\\nWe ordered 4 different dishes. She brought us 2 little bruschetta things - nice. I noticed different tables got different things. Some got rolls, we got this. Cute. \\n\\nEach dish arrived separately so you had a chance to finish the first one. We got the scallops with angel hair - we both loved it. Lobster risotto - that was my favorite. Filet with \\"black garlic\\" sauce - also very good. Least favorite was their \\"spicy alfredo\\" dish which I didn't think was spicy or cheesy enough but - 3 our of 4 ain't bad. \\n\\nEXPENSIVE! 4 small dishes and a bottle of wine run you $100. But we did have a good time despite the temperature and noise. We really are in it for the food - and it won us over, hands down. \\n\\nSo - if not for us sweating the whole time and the noise factor - it'd be 5 stars for sure."},{"name":"Life of Pie Pizza","address":"3632 N Williams Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"Delicious Happy Hour Margarita Pizza.

It definitely has to be BARBECUE. There's so many variations of barbecue across the United States, and Texas BBQ is always talked about as being so damn delicious. \\n\\nLa Barbecue epitomizes what exactly people love about Texas barbecue, and that's the way it's cooked. Their meats were cooked to absolute perfection. I got the Beef Rib, the Brisket, and the pulled pork. I shared the rib, a half lb of brisket and a quarter lb pulled pork with my wife, and it was more than enough for the both of us and then some. The total bill for our order came to 46 dollars, but it depends on the size of the beef rib since it's priced by the weight of the rib. \\n\\nThe brisket was probably the best part of the meal, although I definitely enjoyed the rib as well. The brisket was just so soft and moist that it literally felt like it was melting in your mouth. The flavor of the brisket was great too, and paired well with their sauce as well as the plain white bread that is a staple at most BBQ places in Texas. \\n\\nThe wait.. I'm not sure if I'm a big enough BBQ fan to wait for 3 hours for it, but we had probably a half an hour wait at 1230 pm on a Wednesday, which made going to La Barbecue that much better. That beats the lines at Franklin, which I've heard so much about, but I've yet to try. \\n\\nLooking for great bbq?

Not only that, but then he came up to us again at the other table and said he needed the table for a reservation. Mind you, no one was sitting at the table right next to us. What happened to enjoying your whole experience and being able to leave when you are ready after just spending money there. We hadn't even stayed that long before he had approached us.

We wanted to save it for a special occasion, given the location of the restaurant, so we chose to use it on New Years Eve. The hosts were very accommodating in changing our reservation time, as we were running very late. We were sat immediately in a very nice atmosphere.\\n\\nThe first wine we ordered, they were out of. So, we tried their label wine. It came at a very good price and it was pretty good!\\n\\nThey had a 2 choice, coursed out prix fix menu. One option was a \\"land\\" option, and one was a \\"sea\\" option. My husband and I wanted to share, as we enjoy both things, so we got one of each. We also ordered a cheese plate for $19. The cheese was awesome!\\n\\nOur first course, we enjoyed. It was a nice beef tartar and a smoked salmon. Both done very well. We also enjoyed a really nice fried sausage in a white bean puree of some sort.\\n\\nThis is where our compliments halt, and our two star review is explained.\\n\\nWe waited at least 15 to 20 minutes in between each course. It was very excessive and we were trying to not drink the whole bottle of wine .\\n\\nOur pasta course came out and the pasta was extremely overcooked for the ravioli, with a very bland puree on top. My husband's dish was a little better, but I thought it mainly pasta, olives, and overcooked calamari that was sliced so thin, there was no way it couldn't have been chewy. We didn't touch very much of either of the pasta dishes and nobody seemed to notice.\\n\\nOur final course was the kicker, not to mention the recovery by the manager. I had scallops and he had a bacon wrapped filet. The scallops looked like they had been cooked on a wet, NOT HOT flat-top (or sautee pan). I assumed the line was cleaning up based off of the quality. On half of the scallops, I didnt have one sear mark. They were completely white, like they had been boiled. The other half had black, dirty pan marks. I went for the dirty scallops, but really couldnt eat the meal. The lentils were luke warm as well. On my husband's filet, it was so overcooked, you could tell it had been doing a second \\"resting\\" on the serving plate. The meat came out with a hot pink center, when brushed with a fork, almost well done. \\n\\nAgain, we did not touch our food. When someone came to clear the plates, I told them about the filet and the scallops. We really didn't want the desert course and just wanted the check. The manager came right over with desert (which I was very happy to see such an immediate recovery) and laid it in front of us. He apologized and monetarily compensated us. However, HERE is where this got weird. He apologized saying that the server should have asked us how we liked our filet done, because that is how they cook the filet. Nothing about the scallops or a question regarding the rest of the meal. I am troubled because if that is how the chef cooks filets then, A.) the grade of meat is NOT good, B.) They have improperly trained line cooks, C.) The chef is getting very tired of this business and is not caring about properly cooked food. Also, the reaction of the manager shows me that they seem to get a lot of complaints. He was not surprised one bit by our complaint, and just seemed matter of fact that it was our preference that was the problem. He seemed that he wanted to just take care of it and move on. Usually if I hear someone has complained about my food, I want to hear everything about it, what we can do to make it right and can I get some substitute if you do not want it recooked. We were not even offered a recook. BTW, the desert was so sweet, with way too much sugar.\\n\\nSo, what started off as a great meal was not recovered well and left a bad taste in our mouths."},{"name":"Five Guys","address":"10000 Research Blvd, Ste 142","city":"Austin","stars":"3","text":"Five guys is always delicious.

There wasn't a single fresh fish product on the menu.

After we finished all of our snacks we were still starving and looking for something a bit more flavorful than the items we had already ordered. We opted for a udon and decided we were done. The udon was definitely the most exciting part of the meal. I saw that someone mentioned Okonomiyaki in their review...if only that had been on the menu when I came in.\\n\\nI think we shared a house sake and ordered a few items, the bill was above $50 and we were still so starving that we went across the street for some sushi.\\n\\nI will probably give Tanuki another chance now that I know it's not supposed to be a traditional type Japanese Izakaya."},{"name":"Backstreet Grille & Tavern","address":"531 Pearl St","city":"Stoughton","stars":"4","text":"From the first time to my most recent visit last week, foleys has more than satisfied my dining needs and then some.

Two star review because in half a dozen visits already I still haven't found anything on the menu that I really really like. In general the food embodies a lot of stereotypical vegan food negatives: super dense, lacking flavor, often on the dry side. No matter what I order there's just something off with it. I'm your classic skinny guy over-eater archetype but I couldn't finish a plate of 3 of the densest pancakes I've ever eaten. It was like they were made with dark matter. \\n\\n2. Why does a veggie diner in Central close at 10 on Friday and Saturday? It's not like the business dies off around then. I got there at 9:45 last Friday and the place was absolutely slammed. I realize the hipster staff wants to get off in time to make dance night at ZuZu's but if I were running that place I would be fighting with the city of Cambridge night and day to stay open as late as I could.

It's down the street and around the corner from most of the local hustle and bustle. You'll find it easily, as it's next door to the old DMAC location (that large, green European-style corner bldg.) The neon beer signs in the window and outside smokers will tip you off as well.\\n\\nThe decor is nice. Too nice, if you ask me... but maybe in 15 years time, it'll work itself out. More often than not, the lighting is too bright. They need to tone it down some so people remember they're in an Irish pub, not a hotel lobby. On that point, the paint on the walls is this faux-Tuscan theme which doesn't fit too well, and some of the lighting fixtures on the walls remind me of a Crowne Plaza or something. A notch out of place. Lastly, the ornate stairway at the front of the bar leads to... the bar office. Another mismatch/idea gone weird.\\n\\nOkay, okay. Now for the good!\\n\\nThe seating is cozy and fun. There are TV's showing soccer or rugby most of the time, and the bartender will change the channel for you if you wish. Most of the staff is very friendly, especially this lady named 'Whitney.' \\n\\nYour typical Irish bar beers are in place, as is a full liquor bar.\\n\\nThe food, *ahem, roo-els! I highly recommend starting things off with the potato leek soup! Yummy as hell. The Scotch Egg (hard boiled egg encased in a delicious sausage \\"envelope\\") is a delightful and filling snack at $3.75 as well. My friend gets the sausage rolls every time, which is like a sausage pig in a blanket.\\n\\nThe pies and sandwiches are fantastic! The Shepherd's Pie and the other meat pies are definitely comfort foods that'll warm your soul. Beware of the Dubliner! It's one huge sandwich, and you almost have to be a linebacker to be able to finish it. Thick chunks of roast beef overflowing with provolone and onions. Mmm Mmm! These guys also make their own potato chips!\\n\\nFor me, this bar is best on a Sunday afternoon, or around dinnertime before a night on the town. They have live music from time to time. Mostly acoustic 1 or 2-man ensembles, as the stage is tiny. Again, go on a Sunday afternoon. :) \\n\\n*The Celt is a \\"sister bar\\" to the Claddagh Cottage.

The menu said this was served with tostadas but came with 3 saltine cracker packages. When asked, they rushed out a couple tostada shells, but it didn't save the dish.

I've had Brazilian bbq at several places (not in Boston) in the past, and while this wasn't the best one, it was up there.\\n\\nThe best meat on a stick by far was the lamb. It was incredibly tender, grilled to perfection and very nicely seasoned. We told the waiters at least twice to forget all the other meats, just bring us more lamb. SO good. Also, I think this is the first place I've been where they had the chicken hearts. Chicken heart used to be my favorite part of the chicken when I was a kid (... I'm Taiwanese, what can I say?) but I hadn't had it in a while. I'm glad it's back in my life, because it was yummy. The pork loin and the beef ribs were also quite good. The chicken wrapped in bacon was OK, but whenever I go to steakhouses/bbq places, I feel it's a waste of tummy space to eat any chicken.\\n\\nAs for the buffet sides, I tried to eat as little of it as possible because I'm there for MEAT. But I really liked the stewed beef with potatoes, and the plaintains of course! The feijoada was kind of disappointing (not enough black bean), which was too bad because it's one of my Brazilian favorites.\\n\\nAll in all though, a really great meal. I went with 2 guy friends and I definitely out-ate one of them (I'M A CHAMP, I SAY!)... maybe the other as well.

The big draws are their expansive beer list with tons of beers on tap, and their whiskey offerings (including whiskey flights).

The salad was really good and the dressing was zingy and citrusy.  However, the chicken was rubbery, and although it was cooked through it had the texture of chicken that is underdone (you know what I'm talking about).  What a disappointment, and to think I spent more money on it - I didn't even eat it.  Service was fine - the wait stand was right next to our table so we never had an issue getting the attention of our waitress.\\n\\nThe menu is very typical, and from what I can tell this place only attracts the 20-something singles crowd.

We must've gotten there right when they put the food out because there were piles of it and it all looked fresh. The broccoli was all green and broccoli-looking. The baby corn was a nice mutant yellow. There was a lot of chest in the water chestnuts (whatever that's supposed to mean...I made that up). The meat was pleasantly and sanitarily frozen so that if you were a boxer from the olden days, you'd be inclined to reach out and grab some to go for your next fight to slather on your banged up bruised face. There were several different types of carb-o-licious noodles to choose from. There were some ramen-esque type noodes, and some rice noodes, and some udon noodles...but then there was linguini...which made me want to hurt someone. Why is it that Asian restaurants feel the need to offer odd and random things from other countries on their menu? Is it just me, or have others noticed this as well?  Be proud of what you serve, dammit. It just looks weird that you have linguini there. And sausage.  Seriously...sausage? \\n\\nAnd then the sauce. I like the way they have all of the different sauce ingredients out in front of you along with a giant board that shows you what ingredients you need to add in order to make a sauce you like. I did not like the fact that all of the sauces are close together so that any heathens plowing through the line can potentially slop different kinds of sauce into the adjoining sauce container.\\n\\nI had the Thai Red Curry sauce, and it was tasty, although in retrospect I wish I would've put more in there because my meal was a tiny bit dry. \\n\\nStrike two comes here at the cooking part of the experience. First off, they didn't clean the grill. If you're a strict vegetarian, don't come here. Your meal gets cooked in the leftover juices and stuff from whomever came before you. And the Mexican guy wielding the sword-like grill tool wasn't exactly the most exciting, fun, friendly, authentic nor clean fellow I've ever encountered. I want to see an Asian cook doing some ninja stuff. This guy should be dressed and ready to do battle against the herds of hungry customers. He needs to have the look of the warrior, the eye of the freakin' tiger, and he needs to be slicing and dicing and flipping around and screaming Asian war-cries about chestnuts being chesty and meat becoming unfrozen so that it can be eaten. He needs to be attaching baby corns to noodles and using them as mini nunchucas WHILE he's flipping over the grille dicing the tofu into more edible chunks. Then I want to see him toss down a smoke grenade, and while everyone is distracted, he would attach grille pads to his split-toed boots and hands and proceed to spider walk across the unclean grille so that by the time he re-appears to do battle again, the grille is all clean and shiny and you have no idea how that happened in a quick puff of smoke. \\n\\nNo. Instead I get Fredrico. And believe you me when I tell you that he's nowhere near as fun as what I've just laid out above. \\n\\nReturning to the table, you'll find some soup, a couple of dumplings, some rice, and these tasty thin hollow 'bread strips' that taste a tiny bit like biscuits. But they're damn good. All of the food I had was good.  As I said, the main course I made for myself was a bit dry. And the soup tasted reminiscent of chicken noodle. But overall...good.\\n\\nIf you don't set your hopes super-high for this place, you'll be satisfied.  If they ever add ninjas to the mix, then I'll consider re-evaluating."},{"name":"Rosa Mexicano","address":"155 Seaport Blvd","city":"Boston","stars":"3","text":"as a transplant from the south im always in the lookout for a good mexican place.. this used to be it.. but now is disappointing... food was ok but for the prices is totally not worth it... drinks are also ok.. but again for the prices NOT WORTH IT... there are definitely better places to get mexican food.. this isnt it!! dont waste your time and money. \\n\\ni must emphasize tho, that our waiter was really nice and did his best to accommodate us! not his fault the restaurant has lowered their quality.\\n\\nNever coming back"},{"name":"Dragon City","address":"2200 Winter Springs Blvd, Ste 115","city":"Oviedo","stars":"3.5","text":"I went to Dragon City with my husband.

I would recommend the banana beignets for dessert, they were phenomenal. \\nBased solely on the food, this restaurant is a solid 4-4.5 star place to eat. \\n\\nAppetizer: Duck Fat Fries\\n\\nEntree: Crispy Chicken Thighs and the nightly special (a crispy skin pork dish)\\n\\nDessert: Banana beignets \\n\\nI came here on a Sunday night with my girlfriend around 7:45. We left at 9:45. \\nHowever there are a couple factors that make me hesitant to give Salty Sow a second chance. \\n\\nFirst, when we entered we were not given an option of whether or not we preferred indoor or outdoor seating. It was quite chilly tonight so both of us would have preferred indoor seating. We were seated outdoors in a covered area. There were heaters outside, but the ones nearest us were not on or working. \\n\\nSecond, the waiter we had was very sub par. He never introduced himself to us and was pretty much non existent our entire night. On our check it had his name as \\"Pink\\". The first notable tip off that service might be a little slow was after we had our drink order taken. We did not see him for another 20 minutes. When he finally did return we ordered our appetizer and our entrees. \\nAfter roughly 20 more minutes we had our appetizer delivered, the waiter was not the one to bring out the dish. We had what seemed to be a hostess deliver our food. Once we had almost finished our appetizer, the waiter stopped to ask how our food was.\\nWe then waited for our entrees to come, probably another 15-20 minutes after we finished our appetizer. Yet again, our waiter was not the one to bring our food to us, and again, once we both had almost finished our meals did he stop by to inquire about the meal. Our dessert was the only part of the meal to seem to be prompt. We ordered dessert and had another staff member bring it to us within 10 minutes. But, yet again, only till both of us had almost finished the dessert did the waiter return to ask us how it was. After asking for a box multiple times, we finally had our entree boxed up and returned; the waiter passed us multiple times forgetting to bring one. \\nWhen it came time to pay, he was very quick to drop the check off but seemingly nonexistent when it came time to pick up the credit card. Right as we flagged down another staff member to pick up our check, the waiter darted over and took it from me. \\n\\nAlthough the service was slow, we were giving the waiter the benefit of the doubt as we assumed he was swamped inside the restaurant and had many more tables. When we peeked inside one of the rooms, it was nearly empty, and the main seating area was not very busy when we arrived. \\nWhat was most disheartening was the promptness of the other waitstaff around our table. Multiple tables received their food long before us and they arrived later than us. Overall it seemed as if we were being neglected as customers. \\n\\nThe food is by far the saving grace of the restaurant. Based upon the service we received tonight, it would not be a place either of us want to come back to if we are treated like this again."},{"name":"El Naranjo","address":"85 Rainey St","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"Disappointing.

The last time I went there, it was so bad that I determined I would never go back again. I sat in the bar, and could not even hear my dinner partner who was sitting next to me. Why? Because a group of apparent regulars and the bartender were so busy socializing at the top of their lungs that everyone in the bar left. Amazingly the bartender made a joke about it and did not change. The regulars continued to get plastered and more loud as time went on.

Not at one moment did anyone much less the manager stop and apologize for the wait or let us know anything. This is the most unorganized establishment I have ever been to. The manager would bag one item of someone's order then walk around do something else and start someone else's order. I watched her work one 6 different orders and leave them there without ever finishing anything. The poor cashier had to leave her area (which was not behind the counter) to finish bagging and actually give people their food. There was about 5 other people in the lobby with us waiting on there food and just as equally frustrated. I literally sat and watched my food sit on the bagging station for 15 minutes before we got it. Oh and to add to it all the last guy who ordered got his food before we did. Oh and we were in an uber!

Mimmo's Baked Meatballs are not pollarded, so you get the meaty kind here. The baby eggplant is about as good as I've ever had... ok, I'll admit it: the best I've ever had.

We went with the chorizo frittata, biscuits and gravy, short stack of pancakes, the banana bread, and a side of bacon.  it was a lot of food.  Everything was delivered to the table quite promptly (probably about 10-15 minutes after we ordered).  Unfortunately, both the biscuits and gravy and the pancakes were lukewarm at best.  The gravy for the biscuits was absolutely delicious though - would have been even better if it was actually hot.  The banana bread was also excellent and I'd definitely go back for that one again.  It was probably the highlight of the meal, which is a little disappointing.  And bacon is bacon - really hard to go wrong there.  The most disappointing item, however, was the frittata.  While it was served fresh and hot (which shouldn't even need to be mentioned), there was a very strange aftertaste.  So much so that we each took a bite and then neither of us touched it again.  It was served in a little cast iron skillet with a side of potatoes.  It was a beautiful dish...I just wish it tasted better.\\n\\nAll in all, it was a nice brunch.  It was calm and quiet, the decor was beautiful, and the service was prompt.  Unfortunately, the food didn't deliver to the level of the rest of the experience.

You wanna eat amongst the \\"Haves\\", you gotta have enough money for gas to get there and have enough money to pay the exorbitant prices they pay to dine out. \\n\\nThat being said, the food was good. Not knock your socks off fantastic, but good. Not that it mattered, you are paying to sit outside on the deck and take in the view of the private man-made lake you cannot boat in unless you live there and homes most people can never afford to live in. For an evening, and $12 for a plain Cesar salad, you can sit in the sun, soak up some rays and pretend this is your neighborhood bar. \\n\\nI realize I may sound facetious, but I really do enjoy having a glass of wine on the restaurants 2 leveled sprawling water level deck. The decor is beautiful and they have an outdoor bar. What more does a person need on a beautiful summer evening? Knock your socks off food? Nah! Good will do when you are taking in the sunset with a good glass of Merlot. \\n\\nCheers to the brewery they'll be opening in it's place soon!"},{"name":"Salty Sow","address":"1917 Manor Rd","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"Wow, what a great restaurant!

Then they changed their prices and their menus and it wasn't a big change so we continued to go back.\\n\\nThe food is still pretty good, smaller portions and higher prices.\\n\\nThe one thing that has ALWAYS been consistent is the HORRIBLE service. I know it is a Mexican restaurant but the wait staff should be able to speak enough English to understand and respond to a complaint. They hang out and talk and do other things besides wait on you. We always have to wait for refills on our tea or water and there is NO refills on sodas which is kinda crap since they have a fountain machine.\\n\\nThe quality of the food is however very good, and I would very much rather get it to go but they charge extra for togo  simply because they have to use foil or a box and this place is very much frugal to the point that they don't want to do anything without an extra or special charge.\\n\\nPoint in case, we had breakfast there the other day and after I ordered a breakfast plate (comes with 4 silver dollar size pancakes) they brought out my order w/o the pancakes.

This place just opened up and I walked in during their soft opening last night.  What a nice change from Twist and Phipps Tavern.  The decor in here is South African chic, with tons of textures, high-couture style, and a \\"wild safari\\" vibe.  This restaurant is apparently owned by the folks who brought you 10 Degrees South, the high-end South African restaurant on Roswell Road in north Buckhead.  \\n\\nThis restaurant is in Phipps Plaza, between Twist and Phipps Tavern.  The interior isn't too big, but comfortable and spacious for what they have to work with.  Front and center is a bar that holds about 16 people, with a few mixed-size tables in the main room, and about a dozen more in the room to the right.  They also have a small private dining room that houses a few intimate 2-top tables.  To the left of the bar is a small lounge with high-backed chairs and a huge comfy couch.  \\n\\nI love all of the materials that they use.  There are different textures everywhere, and the decor feels so exotic.  It's incredibly vibrant considering that all of the walls/furniture/decorations are black, white, silver, gray, and earth tones.  It really proves how important textures are, and how they add so much depth to interior design.  \\n\\nMoving on, or out, is an awesome patio.  There is a 12-ish person high-top/community table, and about half a dozen huge, plush, comfortable booths.  I really like the wooden tables and extra pillows at each of the booths.  They have a big waterfall built into the back wall, and two huge, inverted square \\"umbrellas\\" that will supposedly light up.  It looks really cool.\\n\\nThe menu is awesome, too.  It's short and succinct, spotlighting tapas/small plates with a few salads mixed in.  There is an interesting choice meats, from lamb and beef to pork and ostrich.  I didn't have much to eat, but tried the fried chicken.  It was a nice fusion of South African and Southern cuisines.  Large nuggets of battered and fried chicken breast came out hot and juicy on a bed of pureed corn and drizzled with a Piri Piri sauce.  You'll see Piri a lot on the menu, it's a traditional spice blend that can be used as a salt or in a variety of sauces.  It has a nice tangy, spicy flavor.  The corn puree was especially good.  The plate also had a bit of bacon-braised collard greens.  My friends had some tasty looking snacks, too, so I know I'll be back to take a better tour of the menu.  \\n\\nThe beverage list is also short, but very well assembled.  The main focus is South African and American wines.  There's a really nice selection of Pinotage and Chenin Blanc, some great Chardonnays, and a few big hits by the bottle from Shafer and Paul Hobbs.  I had a glass of the ZD Chardonnay ($14, outstanding) and a really nice Pinotage, from whom I forget the name.  There are also about 6-8 signature cocktails that all feature bright, fresh juices.  Nothing too crazy, but I tried some tasty items with pears and cantaloup that were incredibly fresh.  I can imagine rich Buckhead women drinking several of those on a weekday shopping pit-stop.  Delicious.\\n\\nThe staff are great too.  I hung out at the bar for a few hours and seemed to make a new friend every five minutes.  For a restaurant that JUST opened, the staff is really well trained.  Lots of sexy young people, and the manager was really nice too.  I think she knew every guest by name and took equally good care of them all."},{"name":"El Matador","address":"4316 Chamblee Tucker Rd","city":"Tucker","stars":"3","text":"Let me start by saying that I've eaten here a handful of times and it has always had decent Mexican food. Not the best, not the worst but it gets the job done. The reason for the rating is based on my experience from this past Friday. The chips and salsa came almost too fast, seeing as the girl who brought them refused to acknowledge my English and bring waters to the table. The other two people in my party had time to go to the restroom and come back for 3 minutes before our sever came out with the waters and Coke that I had requested. We ate out on the patio.\\n\\nWe had the queso with jalape√±o. The strawberry margarita was regulation. The server was sweet, but not really swift. The food came out slightly incorrect and mine came out last, I had the number 2 lunch special. My stomach started getting upset towards the end of the meal and I went inside in an attempt to cool down. Me server saw my face and offered me an Alka-seltzer saying that I would be fine in an hour. After I took the seltzer I had to upchuck. I had to lay my head down on the floor in the restroom, luckily it didn't stink. I was in the restroom so long that the other people in my party had to come check on me. I had to be helped out of the bathroom.\\n\\nThe server informed my friend that many times the salsa makes people sick. Yet no compensation was offered. Roberto the manager, I believe that was his name as I laid out on the bench while my friend spoke to him, did not apologize, did not seem concerned and did not comp any part of the meal. When my friend said that we would have to go to the hospital Roberto responded nonchalantly and said something along the lines of go to the hospital before they would take any accountability. I've never been sick from Mexican food. I've NEVER had a manger not apologize and say go to the hospital.

There are bubble tea caf√©s a plenty, but there are really no coffee shops. The only one that comes to mind is Rocanini, which is located all the way in Steveston. I find myself here sometimes, whenever I'm bored of Starbucks and need a change of environment for when I'm studying.\\n\\nYes, I'm a non-coffee drinker, and I go to coffee shops to study. The smell of coffee is actually quite welcoming, but I refuse to drink that stuff. On this occasion, I ordered a hot chocolate. Oh hey look latte art. I honestly want to learn how to do this, but I guess I'd have to start drinking coffee. The beverage here was okay; not as sweet as that of Starbucks' and quite smooth.\\n\\nDespite what you would think this is, this was not a lemer tart, but a lemon tart. I believe the pastries here are outsourced from a local baker. I love lemon custard, and so this was quite good. The tart shell was a bit hard to poke at, but it served as a decent vehicle to transport the custard into my mouth.\\n\\nI usually get the london fog here, not the hot chocolate. It's one of the best in town (I mean, I'm comparing one of the only independently operated coffee shops to chains here), with a rich earl grey tea taste and smooth microfoam. The one above doesn't look as attractive as the hot chocolate, but microfoam was still good. There are baristas here that are a bit more competent than others though, so results may vary. The other time, Camille got a chai tea latte and it looked like this -- a bit of a fail in terms of latte art, but still tasty.

But ultimately, we left utterly disappointed. What a shame, I realllly wanted to like this place.\\n\\nThe Bulgogi was paltry and rubbery.  Plus, nearly all the accompanying side dishes looked old and tasted stale.  As if they've been sitting out all day.  It was a sad sight.  As a result, a majority of the sides were left on the table, hardly touched.  Also, the soup we ordered tasted like mud. I consider myself a liberal eater, but every single thing left so much to be desired and ultimately served as a buzz kill to our evening.  \\n\\nThe final blow?  Overpriced for what you get. $20.00 for 1 spiritless dish of Bulgogi.  Instead, I could get 2 generous bowls of FRESH, revitalizing Pho at any Vietnamese restaurant for $12.00 and feel more than satiated. I've had much better Korean BBQ and this place didn't cut it at all.  I wonder if this establishment is fawned over so much because it's one of the very few Korean BBQ restaurants in Orlando.  I'm just not understanding the rave reviews on Shin Jung.

It's misleading.\\n\\nWith that in mind, I do still like the fish-sauce-less curry dish. It's spicy and full of good veggies. If it feels like it's missing a little umami-something, you can add some Braggs at home. I'm also fond of the Thai salad (when ordered without egg). Large chunks of tofu and tomato over iceberg lettuce with a nice peanut sauce. You may not have to explicitly order that one without fish sauce, but I always do now, just in case. My roommate and I are also pretty addicted to their scallion pancakes.\\n\\nOne especially nice vegan feature is that they have surprisingly good fruit smoothies.

Let me be very straightforward when I say that I am not a fan of brunch.  7 am is sleeping in for us, so I do not want to eat eggs at 1 pm.  It automatically turns me off when restaurants only have breakfast food until 2:30 pm.  They did have a hamburger, but that was it.  Which I did not try.

They have a bar and dinning tables there but I never dine there before. It seems nice, i would like to dine there someday. I've been ordering Cinderella on and off for around a year now.\\n\\nFor Quickies.\\nFood: 3 out of 5 stars\\nService(Including delivery times): 3.5 out of 5 stars\\nPrice: 3.8 out of 5 stars (used to be 4 )\\n\\nFor Details:\\nI cant quite remember how i find out about about this place. What attract me from this place is their location, free delivery fee and open late! (since i get off work late most restaurant near me are closed) Also their old website (before they fix it) some price are slightly lower so i love ordering online from them. \\nThe Food:\\nI order mostly subs. I tried their pasta one time and it was alright. a little too soggy and the noodle was kinda over cooked. As for their sub, my favorite was their fish sub and tarter sauce.\\nHowever it is inconsistent. Sometimes it is good sometimes it is ok. I can't remember what goes wrong since the last time i ordered their fish sub was 2-3 months ago. Their Chicken parm sub is not bad. You may also add mushroom onions and other items for free of charge.\\nI also like their chicken noodle soup. As their pizzas and cal-zones its not bad, but it is lacking something i cant tell what it is...anyway overall their food was ok. but a little bit on inconsistent side.\\nThe Service:\\nTheir delivery time sometimes fast(20 minutes) Sometimes slow(1 hour 30 mintues) most of the time is average (45-60 minutes) despite the distance from my work place to their restaurant are just five minutes away driving distance, but im not complaining. After all it is free delivery. Course i did tip them depends on how fast or slow they arrive. One thing i MUST say though is they are not really good at following instructions. When i order fish subs while back on the phone I asked for extra tarter sauce on the side and on it. When i receive my order, there are little to no tarter sauce on it and NO SAUCE on the side. I called them, they send another driver to gave me the sauce. this happened like few times so i decided to order it online and write it down on SPECIAL INSTRUCTION WITH CAPS ON. \\"PLEASE  EXTRA TARTER SAUCE ON THE SIDE\\" 5 minutes after i ordered, i called them to make sure there are EXTRA TARTER SAUCE on the side. The person who answered the phone make sure of it. When i receive my order there are NO TARTER SAUCE ON THE SIDE! I called them and they send another driver over.... This happened another few times. So i kinda give up my fish sub with extra tarter sauce on the side. Despite all this they are still pretty nice i just dont want them to send driver twice for me... and to wait for the sauce ofc!  \\nThe Price:\\nTheir price is reasonable. $8 for a sub and free delivery. However if you want to order online they set a minimum delivery order is now $12. Their pizza however is a bit pricey. Small cheese for $10(14\\") and large for $14(16\\") an extra 2\\" for $4 more. Their Specialty pizzas starts at $15 and up for small, $22 and up for large. Soups are just one size $4. They used to have more choice for soups, but now just chicken noodle soup and clam chowder.\\n\\nThe Verdict:\\nOverall is an ok place. If you are hungry and just looking to fill up your stomach with reasonable price for delivery, this may be the place. I mostly order subs x2 or a sub and a soup. It adds up to $12 plus tax (sub $8 and soup $4) for a meal or two meals. You are welcome to try their pizza and cal-zone. It is not bad, you just might like it but not really my kind of pizza, especially the price."},{"name":"Athan's Bakery","address":"1621 Beacon St","city":"Brookline","stars":"3.5","text":"I really wanted to give this place a good review, I've come a few times and I love their large cappuccinos and the big windows :) sadly this time around I did not have a great experience..

As a result, all our food was cold by the time we started eating except the last plate #6. \\nSomeone needs to set the chef straight about preparing food so all meals arrive together. Must be family member cooking like this or they would never last in a real professional restaurant environment. The food taste and flavor only mediocre at best. My California chicken burrito was the size of a 747 with two teany tiny pieces if chicken inside. Tons of beans and rice but near zero chicken. Never saw the manager touching tables. I guess they never heard of management by walking around. No vote here for ever coming back.

My Moscow Mule was less than, but our other cocktails were excellent. Appetizers were delicious - we've never had better fried calamari! Our entrees came before we were done with the appetizers, a pet peeve of ours. Turns out my husband receive the wrong pork entr√©e - the waitress said she had thought he had ordered the pork sandwich - (if you have two pork choices, maybe you should clarify with the customer before writing it down?) - and my son's veggie burger - (ordered specifically as a vegetarian entree \\"Please remove the bacon\\") came with embedded bacon that could not be easily picked off. So back their food went - I kept my filet mignon, which was good, not the very best ever. Their replaced entrees did not come back for 20-25 minutes. I basically ate my meal alone, and then had to wait for them later. We guessed that the waitress might've been new, and that the kitchen isn't used to having food sent back. Once they receive an order, the focus is on THAT order, from beginning to end, no matter what. Not sure how else to explain such a long wait. After avoiding us for a bit, the waitress apologized profusely and offered us free dessert or our second round of drinks - we accepted the latter. We did the right thing and tipped her 20% on the higher estimated amount. Plus she had also given us the theater discount, which was nice - we hadn't asked for it.\\n\\nAnd yes, the food - when it finally arrived - was super yummy - definitely worthy of all the accolades (except for the meh Moscow Mule and a truly icky Sauvignon Blanc).

The restaurant has two levels. The first floor definitely has more Italian ambience with brick walls and a wall mural and of course the prize tables would be at the windows.  The upper level, which is where my friend and I dined is quaint but lacks the personality of the lower level. The walls are painted in a neutral tone without any pictures or adornments. The extensive menu consists of the standard items one finds in Italian restaurants. All entrees include pasta in one shape or another. Upon sitting, our drink orders were taken and fresh bread, hot from the (warming) oven was delivered. A plate of crushed red pepper and crumbled parmesan cheese was set on the table and the waiter poured EVOO onto the dish for dipping. The bread was quite good. Warm, with a crusty outside and super soft interior. The dipping oil was delicious. \\n           I started out with the stuffed mushrooms which consisted of four mushrooms sitting in some type of butter broth. I wasn't overly impressed with the appetizer. The broth was tasty but there was simply to much of it and the stuffing for the mushrooms had the consistency of pureed baby food, which only became mushier when the broth seeped in. The flavor was adequate at best. \\n           Next, I ordered the veal piccata over angel hair pasta. I was informed that they had run out of angel hair pasta. An Italian restaurant that runs out of such a basic staple item such as angel hair pasta?? Poor management in my opinion. Someone here needs to be extremely grateful for being incompetent and still getting paid for it. I ended up with linguine instead. The flavor of the dish was very flavorful though. Two big pieces of veal cutlets with a delicious lemony butter broth with capers. A very generous portion. Alas, as I feared, the linguine was a bit to heavy for the dish. The angel hair would have been perfect. I did have to ask for a steak knife for my veal. Although it was tender, the butter knife supplied wasn't really doing the job. \\n            My friend ordered a Caesar salad and the mussels fra diavlo. She said the mussels had a nice kick to them. She was pleased with both dishes. We didn't order dessert. Went to Caf√© Paradiso for that.\\n             Overall, not a bad meal.

When adorable, friendly, hard-working servers have to represent an incompetent kitchen staff and terrible food. In all fairness, brunch is not the most accurate indicator of the quality of a restaurant's food. But the least you should expect is that the food be prepared as described in the menu. If the menu says that the eggs benedict comes with bacon and hollandaise sauce, it's a pretty big oversight to leave those things off. And when your order of \\"tacos al pastor with eggs and pico de gallo\\" arrives without eggs or pico de gallo, you can't help but wonder to what extent  the kitchen staff is collectively hungover and/or still drunk from the night before. \\n\\nWhen my companion and I pointed out the missing ingredients to the server, she was very apologetic and quick to remedy the situation by bringing lots of bacon and eggs and hollandaise sauce. She even took responsibility saying that she should have noticed what was missing on the plate before bringing it out. I love people who are confident enough to take responsibility for their part in a mistake. In that spirit, I am willing to take responsibility for the fact that I came to a whiskey bar for brunch and didn't order any alcohol. Add one star for my mistake. \\n\\nSadly, the food still wasn't very good even after we got the stuff that was missing. It wouldn't take much to improve it, though. Just a little tweaking of the menu here and there, (and a little less tweaking in the kitchen), a little more pico or sauce to make the tacos less dry, more cilantro, a little more spice...\\n\\nI realize that what I may consider to be a bad menu, could be perfect for someone else. The key is consistency, I think. (That's the only explanation I can come up with as to why TGI Fridays is still in business.) That's why I'm more forgiving of bad food than I am of carelessly prepared bad food. It's not hard to imagine what other \\"details\\" might be overlooked in the half-ass preparation of one's food. Details like remembering to wash hands, or put the meat back in the cooler before it starts to rot, wiping salmonella off the counters... You know, the little things. \\n\\nThen again, there is a flip side. If the food is really outstanding, as in the little place in Colorado that serves the greatest breakfast burritos in the world and was shut down temporarily for a health code violation (Something to do with rats as I recall.) Nothing could keep me away from that place. Some things in life are worth the risk. \\n\\nIn conclusion, I'm not suggesting you should avoid Ten Oak altogether. By all means, go for the whiskey. Enjoy the patio and the friendly service. Just avoid the brunch.

The last time I went was last Fall sometime (maybe somewhere around October of 2009?), and it seemed to me that it had just about bottomed out at that point.  In the past month I've been here twice though and both times it's actually been better than the three-star rating would imply, but I'm going to hold off on that fourth star until I've proven to myself it's more than just a fluke.  In the meantime I'll enjoy going here and stuffing myself silly until I'm completely satisfied that Casablanca can be consistent.\\n\\nOn the first of my recent visits I had the \\"Turkish Meze Plate (muhammara, carrot salad, musabaha) with veggie dolmades and olives\\" and the \\"Sari's Lamb\\" (slow roasted lamb shoulder, charred tomatoes, spicy yogurt, and grilled flatbread).  The Meze plate is this sort of trio of spreads/dips, including a chunky hummus-like item, a red pepper spread, and an eggplant spread.  Of the three the red pepper was probably the tastiest, followed closely by the eggplant.  The hummus wasn't bad but didn't have a whole lot of flavor.  The lamb was simply *exquisite*, slow-roasted to perfection and when combined with the tomatoes and yogurt sauce was absolutely delicious.\\n\\nOn my second visit I had the \\"Grilled Skirt Steak with fried polenta, baby arugula, red peppers, grilled portabello, garlic vinaigrette, and salsa verde\\".  The best part of this dish?  I asked for the steak rare and got exactly that.  So many restaurants these days outside of the higher-end steakhouses seem afraid to serve a truly rare steak even if you ask for it.  Apparently not at Casablanca!  To me that says this is an establishment that is confident in the quality of the food they serve, and the steak was indeed amazing (and tender, especially considering it was a a rare skirt steak).  The fried polenta was a surprise winner too: I'm not a big fan of polenta (usually finding it to be simply mush that tastes like whatever sauce you care to pour over it), but this was quite good.  The outside was lightly crisped but not over-friend, and it gave the whole thing a much nicer texture than I'm used to with polenta.  It also added a little bit of flavor since I'm guessing it was lightly friend in a pan with a little olive oil.  It's nice to be served something that you don't expect to really like but come away wondering if you should reevaluate your ambivalence toward that ingredient.\\n\\nService was good both times, not outstanding but certainly adequate for the task.  I hope this is the beginning of a resurgence for Casablanca because I really enjoy the general vibe and atmosphere there, and would happily return if the quality of the food continues to be what I've seen recently."},{"name":"Gladys Knight's Signature Chicken & Waffles","address":"529 Peachtree St NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3.5","text":"SHOULD HAVE KNOWN BETTER!!!!

The tables are set up with benches to maybe sit 3 on each side. And we were seated at the table where there were already 3 people seated. The girl that was seated there didn't seem too pleased with the hostess when she scooted the little wooden separator to make room for us.  The girl didn't even want to scoot her purse over and she kept her back towards us. She was soo unpleased, she went to grab a single chair to sit at the end of their side of the table.  Such a B, it wasn't our fault we got seated there.  It was weird to be put in that type of situation. \\n\\nAnyhow, our waiter made up for it with his excellent service. We were checked on often.  There was a great selection of appetizers on HH menu, so we decided to just do HH instead of a meal.  We tried the duck fat fries, pork belly taco, chicken liver mousse and truffle deviled eggs.

In detail (because I love it SOOO  much). Thanks to Groupon, I have found one of my favorite places in Portland. Muddy's just isn't a place to eat a bite of heaven, have a beer or coffee but also to just hang out amongst the coolest laid back hip people in Portland. It's the place I would take my friends who have never been to Portland to give them a feel for the 'real' feel of the city.\\n\\nAll of this fun is in a little older house on the hill in the historic Mississippi district. Inside you'll find hardwood floors, dim lighting, cool music playing on the surround sound, vintage hand-made aprons hanging on the wall for sale and a younger crowd sitting amongst the room full of mis-matched chairs and tables. So relaxed and so unpretentious. Just sit back, relax and enjoy the amazing food and drink to come... you're amongst friends here.\\n\\nThe first time I went to Muddy's was with my mom who was visiting me from the Midwest. We went around 6 pm and for some reason we were the only ones there. 'Doc' - a tattooed server - welcomed us and took our order. \\n\\nWe ordered the hummus plate and the bacon cheese quiche. First off I have to tell you the quiche here simply rocks in every possible way. Super perfect and light crumbly crust with the most heavenly cheesy goodness inside like it just came out of the oven. The hummus plate was pretty good and is a great simple meal. It's served with cucumbers, feta cheese, onions, tomatoes and a ton of small cut bread slices. The hummus is a more reddish color due to whatever flavor they added. Not very garlicy at all. A pretty mellow eat. Oh, and we also ordered beer. How cool! Beer, coffee and dinner. \\n\\nBreakfast is served all day. How does one not love that?\\n\\nThe second time I went to Muddy's was soon after my first visit because I couldn't stay away. My friend and I ordered the bagels and lox, brocolli cheese soup and another quiche again. We just split the whole meal. I highly recommend doing it this way 'cuz everything is just way to good not to try. This time the quiche was made with carmelized onions, apples and goats cheese. Yes, sounds weird but sooo yummy. Blew my socks off. I wanted to go hug the chef. The bagel/lox is served with onions, tomatoes and capers. Nothing is left out here. Everything... and I mean everything... was AMAZING!\\n\\nI've read that a few people have trouble loving the coffee. NO IDEA where that comes from. The coffee is a bit heavier in consistency like it was french pressed with a stout body. I'm pretty much a coffee snob (aren't we all in Portland?) and drink mostly Stumptown or (gasp) Starbucks. The coffee here is 100% better than Starbucks and may even trump Stumptown. Yeah, I said it.\\n\\nThe servers are friendly and welcoming. The cooks were singing loudly in the back and it is more like dining at your cool cousins house than eating out at a cafe. Super casual and they have open mic nights after a certain time at night. \\n\\nThis is my new favorite place.

When we got to the booth the seat was wet & asked for it to be dried. A guy came out to dry it off, but kind of hard to do with a wet rag. So, I took the napkin from one of our utensils and dried it myself. Hubby ordered the club, nothing special just ok. Father in law ordered half rack of ribs and did seem to enjoy it. I got the Monte Cristo. Now I know this is fried, but it was so greasy I couldn't eat it. The fries were cold & greasy as well. Thank goodness my hubby ordered the cheese curds.

It's a very greasy (guess 70% lean) 1/2 lb burger (raw...seems more like 1/3 lb after) cooked on a flat top (the grease stays and bathes the burger, instead of burning off the grill).  Overall, it was just meh....I liked how it was cooked - chargrilled medium.  The cheese was so small and bland, it really didn't have any kind of wow effect.  And the burger itself wasn't seasoned all that well, and outside of the onion, there wasn't a ton of flavor.

He said it's usually a 45$ bottle at the restaurant, but will gladly give it to us for 30$ since that was the price of the other two bottles we were looking at. The bottle of wine retails for 30$ in stores, so the upcharge isn't even that high! Amazing!\\n\\nWe ordered the mussels and the Sunday Mac and both were astounding.

Due to our prime seating, we also got to watch 3 other gigantic fish make a scene by jumping out of their net onto the ground and get chased down by the wet-faced waiter.\\n\\n+ 8 Crab Rangoons for $5.50...best deal I've ever seen. They were also the crabbiest and largest I've ever seen. Super yummy dipping sauce.\\n\\n+ Spotless service. Neither our tea nor ice water ever reached past the halfway point before getting refilled.\\n\\n+ At $44 for two, it was $9 cheaper and 10 times more delicious than the Chinese food I had two days before (http://www.yelp.com/biz/chau-chow-city-boston).\\n\\nNow for the negative, which are both partially my own fault in dish selection:\\n\\n- The Chinese broccoli that came with our chicken dish was fresh, but also slippery and huge! At 7-8 inches per stalk, there was no graceful way to eat them without making a mess on the plate or on your face...and that's assuming you could pick them up in the first place using slippery plastic chopsticks. I kept hoping they would magically cut themselves in half when I wasn't looking.\\n\\n- The striped bass which we ended up getting, steamed with ginger and scallions, was super mushy and tasted like a bottom-feeder.

My boyfriend and I went to stop in one night for drinks shortly after the restaurant opened. Despite the restaurant being COMPLETELY empty, the hostess told us we had to order a minimum of two piattini (small plates). While we probably would have ordered at least that, we didn't like the idea of being forced into anything, so we walked on by...and vowed not to return. \\n\\nAfter reading many positive reviews of Damiano, I figured we ought to give it a try. Last Friday around 11:00 pm we realized we hadn't eaten dinner, and not much else in the North End serves food that late. Thankfully, Damiano serves until 11:30. We went in and sat up at the bar, which has a great view of the open kitchen. \\n\\nUnfortunately, a great view of the kitchen is not always a good thing. The kitchen at this restaurant was a bit of a disaster. It wasn't dirty, but quite cluttered and messy. If you're going to have an open kitchen, it should be immaculate. \\n\\nMoving alone, the wine selection was great, and reasonably priced. Our server was polite, although overly casual. He suggested that we order two small plates/person, which would have overwhelmed us a bit. We ordered three small plates--the risotto caprese, a pistachio encrusted sea bass, and the lamb lollipops. \\n\\nOur server brought over our wine and some bread fairly quickly. Throughout our entire meal, however, he failed to ask us if we wanted any water. \\n\\nWhile we waited for our food, we watched the chef prepare an edamame dish, which he'd said was for his daughter. Not long after, our server brought us what we thought was the first of our three piattini--the pistachio-encrusted sea bass, coincidentally served with edamame. My boyfriend cut the tender fish in half, and put it on his plate. I was about to do the same, when we are suddenly yelled at by the chef. \\"Who brought that over to you? That was supposed to be for my daughter!\\" My boyfriend said he assumed it was ours as it was in fact a pistachio-encrusted sea bass, but the chef bellowed, \\"Your first course was supposed to be the risotto!\\" We were both entirely dumbfounded. The situation was awkward, and we didn't know what to do. We thought about getting up and leaving, but were almost nervous to do so. I told my boyfriend just to put the fish back on the plate, which he did. The chef looked back over at us and said, \\"Well, did you eat it?\\" After we nervously shook our heads no, he said, \\"Give it back to me. Give me the fish.\\" He proceeded to yell to his daughter, and gave her the plate to her to eat. To compensate for the chastising, he later sent over a small dish of edamame tossed with truffle oil. It was good, but honestly did not make up for what was probably the most awkward restaurant experience of my life. \\n\\nMoving past the tense moments, our waiter brought us our actual first course (which was odd to me anyhow, considering there are no real courses in a small plate restaurant). The risotto was very flavorful, although watery and slightly undercooked. \\n\\nOur next two courses were undeniably delicious. The pistachio-encrusted sea bass (OUR pistachio-encrusted sea bass) was perfectly cooked, and the lamb lollipops were tender and tasteful. I must say that we rushed a bit while eating just to get out of there as quickly as we could, but we did enjoy the food. \\n\\nNeedless to say, I will not be going back to Ristorante Damiano. The food and adequate service were not enough to compensate for the unbelievably awkward and inappropriate experience. Food of equal caliber and price can be found at any of the other many restaurants in the North End, and if I happen to get a craving for a small plate Italian restaurant, I'd head to Ivy instead."},{"name":"Salty Sow","address":"1917 Manor Rd","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"Brussel sprout app, redfish entre- my top picks at this place !

Always checked in on the waters, drinks, and explained the specials in clear non-condescending manner.\\nAtmosphere - Very relaxed warm atmosphere, great decor and clean.\\nPrice - The regular price is reasonable. However, it's even better when you come during their happy hour specials. $2 off the appetizers is great...say for example those Duck Fat Fries. yum.\\n\\nI'm a big believer in the price/food quality ratio. The food was properly priced if not somewhat under-priced compared to other establishments of similar food quality.\\n\\nEvery nice restaurant should accept reservations (and ideally use an online reservation system like OpenTable) to make the experience easy and seamless.\\n\\nIf I was to nitpick, don't come to this restaurant during times when they have a \\"Live Band\\" since the walls aren't very thick so it's pretty distracting inside when they do have a band.

I did enjoy my matcha latte, as it wasn't very sweet. However, the matcha could've been stronger and a little less watery. All in all, the only main thing to avoid is the bento box, which was underwhelming for the price ($16) and very lacking in appearance.

The meat was moist and soft, just the way I like it.  Dryer meat is ok, but not as good as moist meat.  Out of the many Texas BBQ places I've been to in Austin and San Antonio, this has to be the best brisket I've tasted.  It melts in your mouth literally.  Even the lean parts are amazing which is unheard of.  The pork ribs were good and melted in my mouth too.  The beef ribs also came in a straight second, but has a slightly different beef taste than the brisket.  I highly recommend the brisket and the beef ribs here.

Or do I begin with the comedic moment when, while we were waiting and waiting (and waiting) for our two enchilada entrees to be served, our server brought us our check and asked if he could get us any dessert? I mean REALLY?...how did he not notice that our food had yet to be served? It was not a busy evening... not even close.

EXCEPT that they put some sort of sickly sweet sauce on it that is not mentioned in the menu.

The sauce is too much and I would've 86'd it had I known about it.\\n\\nI ordered the Willie Nelson burger because I love me some bacon, cheese, and fried onion rings. This burger was so huge, I almost couldn't get my mouth around it. And that's my biggest complaint. I love a good burger, but maybe my mouth is extra small (which is weird because I often am called a big-mouth). I just could barely eat this burger. Plus, it was MESSY! The cheese spilled out, the sauce ran everywhere and a lot of it ended up in the basket and not my mouth. Which is too bad because it was very tasty otherwise.\\n\\nOn the plus side, they have Mexican coke and some really great fried pickles and veggies.

But when you have two bartenders standing within arms reach of you, refusing to acknowledge your existence as you patiently wait and stare at them like a dog begging for food at the dinner table (creepy, I know, but it got to that point)...well, it doesn't make for a pleasant evening. At one point, my dining companion whispered to me \\"are we invisible?\\". The food was actually very tasty. That is, once we received it. \\n\\nOnce I ate and had 2 margaritas flowing in my system I was willing to somewhat overlook the dismal service. Once we finished our meal, we were greeted by two friends who were also treated to the same horrible service (it took them 45 minutes to get a food order in which entailed FLAGGING down a waitress and practically begging for service). At that point, I had had it, and decided to write this review. I have never written a review for anything before, I just can't be bothered, but I was frankly offended by the service we received. It's one thing to deal with flighty servers who have good intentions but just can't get it together, it's a whole other situation to be treated as if you are invisible and insignificant. I don't see us returning, despite the fact we enjoyed our food, so that makes it a bit disappointing."},{"name":"Mi Tradicion","address":"111 N Stygler Rd","city":"Gahanna","stars":"4","text":"Even with 2 kids going stir crazy this was a great stop.

My friend got a more unique breakfast beverage which was like a bloody mary but had whiskey instead of vodka- but it was a special whiskey of sorts and he deemed it undrinkable.\\n\\nOn to the main dish:  we split the rabbit & dumplings and the beef tongue hash.  Both were excellent.  I mean, really, really good.  The dumplings were big biscuits and the rabbit was tender and delicious and not gamey at all.

The meat was like a barbacoa consistency with a good amount of fat (flavor) but crispy on the outside and tender/soft on the inside.  The tongue was served in chunks.

We started off with a round of really delicious (and strong!) cocktails. We had an extremely attentive waiter, John, who made a lot of recommendations for our tastes. I had been there before so I knew the Cat Lady was the drink for me (despite the embarrassing name!). It's perfectly girly, pink, bubbly, delicious. My friends both got Kentucky Sangrees and loved them, particularly the round ice which really shows the attentiveness of the bar. I'd only had drinks there before, so was looking forward to exploring the food menu on this trip. \\nWe got the fried pickles as an appetizer, which I really enjoyed. I'd had them before at Brick & Mortar (Central sq) but actually liked them better here -- there was a higher ratio of fried to pickle, which, in my opinion, makes for a yummier appetizer! There was a pretty tasty dipping sauce, too.\\nWe all ordered the burger but different variations on it. I got the mushrooms, which were quite good, and one friend got the egg. (Maybe add an option for caramelized onions on the burger, that's my favorite topping!) Nevertheless, the amount of variations for the burger toppings is pretty amazing. I think in the future I'll have to try some of the other, more daring entrees, too, but was in a burger mood on this particular evening. I have to say that the kicker on the burger, however, was the bun!! It was like a perfect swirl of challah/brioche (not sure exactly what it was) and I was in love with it. The fries were crispy and fried, not too heavy/potatoey. We also tried a side of sweet potato fries, which were great and much crispier than you can usually find sweet potato fries.\\nPerhaps the best part of Hops N Scotch is that while delivering inventive, high-quality food, it continues to serve large portions!! I'm the type of person who likes to have MORE food than I can finish when I go out to eat -- nothing more disappointing than receiving a tiny portion, and feeling dissatisfied at the end, particularly if it's truly delicious. So on this front, Hops N Scotch definitely fulfilled my desire.\\nThe staff was excellent, and all the food was delivered quickly and while it was still hot. A friend asked for a bottle of Tabasco and it came right away. Ketchup bottles were very full (empty ketchup bottles are a big complaint of mine, as I'm a ketchup afficianado!). The manager (wearing a lavender button-down shirt) even came over and checked in on us, chatted us up a bit, and made sure we were having a good time.\\nAlso, make a reservation or come early if you can, so you can get the best seats by the open-air windows (which I imagine are only open in the summertime).

We were on the hunt for some al fresco dining, and this fit the bill perfectly.  It's a cute little tented-off section, right off the sidewalk with a couple of sofa/table combinations and some high barstool/table combinations.  They were playing some Euro Electronic Lounge over their speakers at, arguably, a perfect level.\\n\\nWe were seated quickly, but then had to wait a good 15 minutes before the waitress even came over.  They also didn't give me a wine menu; I had to ask for it directly from another server.  It looks like it's a shared wine list from Tamo and Aura, so there's a great, albeit pricey selection of wines on the list.  Lowest-priced reds that I saw were ~ $35-$40.  Highest?  Yeah, well let's just say it was out of my price range that night....or any night.\\n\\nSo, the food....I ordered the Roasted Salmon, and my date ordered the Goat Cheese ravioli.  While very well prepared and quite delicious, portions were definitely small for the price.  My date (bless her heart) was grumbling about paying $16 for 3 ravioli.  I'm Italian, so the thought of three ravioli costing $16 amuses/annoys me, but whatever.  It was such a nice night, the wine was damn good, and our table was perfect for watching all the drunk people stumbling out of the microbrew convention at the WTC.\\n\\nThe service was pretty rough around the edges.  I attribute this more to what I feel is the \\"newness\\" of the terrace (and the waitress) and less to an attitude.  When she did randomly appear, she was very sweet and attentive.  Questions about the menu, etc., however, may be met with blank stares.\\n\\nOne final note -- an 18% gratuity is ALWAYS included in the final bill, regardless of the party size.  Apparently, it's a side effect of being part of the hotel dining.  I'd never seen this before, and it was, to be honest, a little off-putting.  I normally tip ~ 20% anyway, but I prefer seeing forced, included gratuities for larger parties rather than a table of two.  Definitely odd.\\n\\nAll in all, dinner for two and a bottle of wine with gratuity set me back ~ $100.\\n\\nI'll probably be back...if for no other reason than I really like drinking and people-watching."},{"name":"Mrs. Jones","address":"2255 Dorchester Ave","city":"Dorchester","stars":"4.5","text":"If you are craving for Good traditional Southern Soul Food here in Boston, look no further.

The panfried grits triangles were creamy on the inside and crisp on the outside, and they paired well with the sauce.  The shrimp were perfectly cooked, tender and flavorful.  We also had an order of the mac 'n cheese, which was surprisingly tasty.  The manchego in the cheese mix, the panko topping, and the broiled finish gave the dish nice flavor and crisp texture.  Finally, for desert we loved the malva pudding.  It was referred to as a sort of bread pudding, but the texture is more uniform, dense and moist than many bread puddings.

At 9.57pm I called again and was informed by a female worker that if they are busy, they don't touch their grub hub orders until all other orders are taken care of so don't worry, the food shouldn't be cold. She also said if it doesn't come within the next 10 minutes I could call back and talk to the owner. No apologies. It's 10.08pm and still no food. Time to call the owner.\\n\\nCalled back and got the same female worker who said she didn't see my order.

I love the concept, and the menu had a few interesting options (pork belly sliders/tacos, crunchy catfish tacos, Belgian fries). The execution, however, was lacking. \\n\\nI ordered the Banh Mi (pork belly) slider and the chicken satay taco. The boy ordered the crunch catfish taco and the brisket taco and a side of fries.\\n\\nAll our food - with the exception of the fries - was cold or lukewarm. My chicken satay taco had chunks of chicken that were slightly warm and chunks that were cold. My pork belly slider was actually cold. Have you ever eaten cold pork belly? It's not awesome. \\n\\nThe boy's food did not fare any better. His brisket and fish tacos were lukewarm, and he wasn't crazy about the coleslaw they use in their tacos. \\n\\nEven though our tacos and sliders were really disappointing, the fries were pretty tasty. I liked that they had several types of unique dipping sauces that came with the fries, but the boy did not like that they didn't have just simple ketchup. \\n\\nI will say that the portions are teeny tiny for the price.  I'd guess that you'd probably have to eat at least 4-5 sliders to be satiated. \\n\\nThe guy running the trailer was friendly and nice, so it saddens me to write a not so glowing review.

Went with a friend, and admittedly I was pretty much dressed like a tourist, but that's no excuse for servers who are abrasive.  If anything, I'm overly pleasant with servers, having some experience in the service trade.\\n    We ordered an app, a (expensive) bottle of wine and entrees.  The complimentary bread and dipping oil was good, a nice touch the pour dry spices in the serving vessel and then covered with olive oil, but then, I make dipping oil at home and it's all about giving the oil and spices time to marry.  Anyway, the goat cheese and red sauce app was very good, could have used a bit more cheese.  The server brought the wrong bottle of wine and cheap glasses (something you'd get a small OJ in from a diner).  When we corrected them, they brought the right wine with more appropriate stemless red wine glasses.  Sure it was a $55 bottle of wine, but why different glasses???\\n    The entrees were excellent, I sprung for the fresh made angel hair pasta and could taste it wasn't store bought.  Both meals were cooked very well, and everything was served time appropriate.  Nice, small dining room, open air as the weather was appropriate.  Entree portions are very generous.\\n     All in all a pretty good meal, will probably go back to see if how things go one way or the other.

The decor is nice...kind-of dark, so more on the romantic side.  I actually had trouble reading the menu!\\n\\nDrinks:\\nThey had a special cocktail for Restaurant week - mojito for $7, in many different flavors.  I tried the lychee while my friend had the peach.  They were just ok.  Mine was too sweet, hers lacked peach flavor.\\n\\nAppetizer:\\nI started off with Crispy Ham & Cheese - shaved italian country ham wrapped around fontina cheese / herb bread crumbs / arugula / tomato and green olive.  This tasted good but I thought it was too heavy for an appetizer.  There were 2 pieces with a good amount of greens.  If they had given me 3 pieces, I could've eaten that alone as a meal.  \\nMy friends ordered the Beet Tartare:  Red Beet Tartare sheep's milk ricotta / hydro greens / walnut toast.  It was my first time eating beets and it was good.  To my surprise, the beets, ricotta and walnut toast went really well together.\\n\\nEntree:\\n2 of us ordered the Devil Fried Chicken - jalape√±o dusted organic chicken / cippolini tomato sauce / artichoke pancake .  This was delicious and the portion was big as well.  The Fried chicken was tasty and crispy.  The artichoke pancake was really interesting and delicous as well.\\nMy friend ordered the Roasted Cod- clam risotto / fried clam oreganata / bacon mayo.   The risotto was extremely salty!  but overall, it was good.\\n\\nDessert:\\nThis was my least favorite.\\nI got the Brownie banana split.  The brownie was not soft nor warm.

We got there close to 5 and found the place already starting to fill up. We had a pretty healthy gift card so we started to go work on their HH menu. We ordered: Duck Fat Fries, Fried Chicken, pork carnitas taco and deviled eggs. I tried the Mr. Shaw specialty drink (same last name, how could i resist?) and she had frozen margarita. \\n\\nFries: Never had fries with an egg on top (a theme of our meal) and found them to actually be quite good. Maybe not up to the hype that some of the other reviewers have mentioned but solid.\\n\\nDeviled Eggs: these were delicious, especially with the little bacon pieces. Different than any other deviled eggs we have tried\\n\\nMaple Honey Fried Chicken: By far the favorite of the four items we tried. We would have ordered more if you we were still hungry. The maple honey is delicious on the chicken and the sweet potato biscuit, though not as soft/fluffy as I would have hoped, was still difficult to enjoy slowly. Recommended.\\n\\nPork Carnitas Taco: Definitely the least favorite of the items we had. First it was $5 on the happy our menu for a single taco. The taco also came with a fried egg and coupled with the carnitas provided a weird texture for the both of us. The carnitas themselves were great but we could not get past the texture of the egg and the runny yoke. Would not get this again for sure.\\n\\nWe finished the meal with their mini cocktail flight of the day. Too many drinks to describe all but the consensus favorite was the shandy.\\n\\nWe plan to go back and have main courses and update our review but as of now, having taken part in one happy hour, we are happy we got to experience a place so close to our house and so heavily reviewed.

It seems I stepped into an alternate universe where this place is terrible.\\n\\nI've literally never given a 1 star review before, so please allow me to defend it:\\nFirst and foremost, TILT is located in The Pearl. What that means is one expects to pay more money for their food, with the tradeoff being bigger portions, a \\"nicer\\" atmosphere (pretty lighting or whatever), and so on.\\n\\nThe only thing posh about TILT is their customer base. TILT's \\"dressed down\\" or \\"blue-collar\\" ambiance is taken too far when it's literally dark on the patio at night, the tables are barely big enough for two plates, and the bathrooms smell like an outhouse and look like that of a jail's. All of that, however, wouldn't bother me if I wasn't eating in Portland's absolutely ritziest neighborhood. Even then, it wouldn't bother me if the food and service weren't so subpar.\\n\\nMy girlfriend and I waited in a 10 person line for about 20 minutes to order. I briefly mentioned to the gent behind the counter when we stepped up that I felt bad for how busy it was. He assured me it wasn't \\"thaaat busy,\\" and it was cool. Ok. Upon beginning to place our orders, he let us know very matter of factly that they were out of fries, saying, \\"We don't have any fries.\\" All three of us sort of looked at each other, until he mentioned that he was serious and offered onion rings or tater tots instead. .....Alright.. One order of onion rings, one order of jalape√±o tater tots it is.. \\nThere was no apology, no acknowledgment of how that was bizarre, no nothing. Then, he informs us that they're out of cups, and passes us two plastic cups. Like the kind you get beer in at ballparks. (Luckily, however, we're encouraged that we should have as much soda as we'd like! ...Which came across very patronizing.) I was disappointed the server made no attempt to reconcile either of these things. In 90% of similar situations, I've been offered a free drink, *at least* -- which is to say the restaurant loses out on ~$1.50 or more of pure profit. I'm not asking for a few meal, or even free side. Just acknowledgement.\\n\\nAnyway, fast forward to receiving our food, and it was generally lackluster. I got a super wild creation consisting of a burger with brisket, jalape√±o coleslaw, and an onion ring on top, and it still generally lacked flavor. Wut? My girlfriend got the standard cheeseburger which was alright she said; ditto with the onion rings. However, giving credit where it's due, the jalape√±o tater tots were quite good.\\n\\nWhen we were about mid-meal, I looked over and saw several people that ordered after us with heaping servings of fries.

The steak tips were amazing and the ribs were just as delicious.\\n\\n2. The atmosphere was busy but relaxing at the same time. The restaurant itself was loud, but we were able to have some great discussions with family.\\n\\n3. The prices were fairly reasonable for the quality and amount of food we got.\\n\\nCons:\\n\\n1. Our waiter wasn't the most polite or receptive which was a letdown. He didn't seem to have time for our questions (which weren't many) and actually walked away from us at one point after we told him we were ready to order.\\n\\n2. Another issue we had was that we ordered appetizers and once we had finished, we waited over 30 minutes for our meal. We watched everyone around us get their food and couldn't tell if there was a back up in the kitchen or if the waiter forgot to put in our order.\\n\\n3. The final con, and a small one at that, was the fact that there are no free refills on soda.

I use to love you but now you've done nothing but rip my heart out and stop on it. \\n\\nI've been to 4 different Max & Erma's lately to see if my issue is a company wide thing or just a bad cook at one place. Turns out none of them can make a decent burger. Mind you, they taste alright if you like them super rare like chop meat or dry and well done. This specific location nail the coffin shut for my family. \\n\\nWe eat our burgers anywhere from medium well to medium rare, depending on which place we're going to and how they cook their meat. Steak are eaten rare-med rare, and burgers are medium rare for us; that's the ''perfect'' temperature and what most place will suggest you eat them at to get the best flavor & taste. That said, I have no idea why this chain is incapable of making anything aside from well done. It truly boggles my mind. At first it was just this funny quirk to us. The first place we were at was the location down town in German Village; love that place but the burgers were well done and dry. The second place was Polaris...same issue. Then we moved and tried the one at Easton. This time we were fed up, dying for a medium burger and sick...SICK...of the chain cooking them however they felt like it. You see, they ask you how you'd like it cooked and you tell them, but then they end up giving you whatever they feel like. That's fine once in a while, people have off days and grills are tricky at times. But these are professionals and the issue should not be company wide. SO by the 3rd location we were fed up and having more then just dry burger issues; like cold soup and exceptionally slow service. That location took 3 tries also to cook the burger right. This location, the Gahanna one took 4!?\\n\\nThat's right....we ordered our burgers and then had to re order them since they were over cooked. The manager brought them straight out and we cut into them. Overcooked again, and took them without us saying anything and walked away. 10 mins later she was back again with our 3rd set....overcooked again. She told us to keep them and nibble and she would be back with new ones. I said forget it, that I appreciaited it but honestly felt bad. I told her there was nothing wrong with the taste but it struck my as odd that none of the locations could cook it anything less then well done. She told me she had no idea there was ever an issue. I asked my friends about this and they all agreed....no one has ever gotten a medium burger; wither they messed up the temperature or they ordered it well done. The manager told us that they girl who made the patties this morning (at least their fresh!) didn't press down hard enough and left too much air between the meat so it wasn't cooking properly. This made perfect sense to me and I knew then, that no matter how many times they insisted on re making our burgers, they would come out the exact same way. Still, she insisted on re cooking them so we grit our teeth and aloud it. I HATE WASTING FOOD!!!! At this point I would have eaten the 2nd one they brought out and left it at that. Management here is on point and focused at their job and it shows. The next burgers that came out were well done as well, but the inside was chop meat...well beyond rare. I told her I like rare meat but the insides were so mushy and red that it wasn't even possible to eat. She took them off the bill and I asked for a Rueben. The hubby ate his burger from the 3rd time around so he was all set and done. He ordered himself some cookies. \\n\\n15 mins later and another drink from the bar later and our food was out. The Reuben was a cold and soggy mess. I was disappointed at this point. I could tell this would have been a really yummy sandwich but ....it was cold... The sauerkraut was luke warm, the cheese not even melted, and the bread was soaked through with dressing and literally falling apart. This really did it for me, I was upset to the point where I just wanted to leave and never ever come back. Between the two of us that night we went through 7 burgers and a sandwich ...that's insane. In the end the manager never came back to see how we were doing or to apologize. The check had been altered to take off the burgers but nothing else; we paid for drinks, our app, and dessert. After that much that went wrong something else should have been done, at least an apology or a gift card to make sure we come back."},{"name":"Hy's Shrimp","address":"530 SW 205th Ave, Ste 400","city":"Beaverton","stars":"3.5","text":"My wife and I decided to try this out.

Perfect for a date or for a small group. The happy hour selections are shareable, save for the tacos, which get so messy thanks to the fried egg. I'd have to say this is probably the best-priced charcuterie board in Austin. Yes, you can certainly ask for more mustard and bread.

I wasn't looking for anything great just a place to grab a few drinks or get a decent dinner while catching up with friends. I had moved from Comm Ave in Allston and was a frequent weekday customer of Joshua Tree and Tavern for post work appetizers. When I made the move to Brookline I also wanted to step up my weekday spot to a place somewhat nicer ....so Coolidge Corner Club House was not an option. Luckily Hops and Scotch opened a few weeks later. \\n\\nIs Hops and Scotch my favorite restaurant or bar in Boston? Absolutely not, but it does have a lot to offer. The menu is limited, but there are options for everyone. I was pleasantly surprised with how good the braised short ribs were, they are by far my favorite menu item. They are approximately $20 which is a tad expensive for a casual weekday meal but I usually have enough to eat for dinner another night. It comes with mashed potatoes and green beans both of which are delicious! \\n\\nI have tried the Mac and cheese which I would probably order again. I also tried the grilled cheese and it wasn't for me. It had too many additional ingredients that I felt it lost its identity and turned into a gourmet high in fat sandwich. It is served with a chilled soup which I neither hated or liked. \\n\\nThe other people I have gone there with have had their burgers, chicken sandwich, country salad, and arugula salad. The only complaint I heard about the aforementioned items was the arugula salad was overdressed and there was a lack of figs. \\n\\nAs for the drinks they have a good beer selection although their Pumpkin beer selection in the Fall was lacking. As for wine, they have a limited selection but for $9 you can get a pretty decent Pinot Grigio and the usually are heavy on the pour which is a plus! \\n\\nI have never had trouble getting a seat any day of the week but every time I have gone there it has a decent amount of activity. Even on a tuesday the bar area was filled. \\n\\nPros: young professional crowd and great spot to meet friends for drinks or food\\nCons: the bar area is smaller than it should be"},{"name":"Tilted Kilt Pub & Eatery","address":"11650 University Blvd","city":"Orlando","stars":"3","text":"This is my update to \\"Tilted Kilt\\" on University Blvd, in east Orange just outside of the UCF campus. \\n  Friday, Feb. 18, 2011 I visited this location because a coworker was having a \\"leaving for a better job\\" get together.  When I arrived the place was a little busy, but definitely not packed.  Just the bar area seemed busy.  Lots of tables were open.  Our party already had 4 tables together, I knew more were coming so it was about to get interesting.\\n  From my past visits I am automatically bias towards their service/pricing, etc..  However, I always believe in improvement. \\n  I quickly noticed the girls there we not in high heels, that made me think that possibly management saw the downside to heels.  Good choice! I think the girls can appreciate that as well.\\n  I sat with my friends at the end and to my surprise I was going to get a different waitress this time.  Last two visits yielded the same person.  I gave her my order \\"shock top\\".  My friend to the right of me suggested to her she grab our names so that she didn't confuse the checks, this is a common problem we run into because of how large our parties get.  Sensing some pride, she quickly stated she was ok and that she was ok.  Sure, ok.\\n  Off she went to get my beer, she only placed an order from my table for 2 beers, mine and another gentleman to my left.  We talk for a while and I ask my friend Tony how he liked the place.  he stated that he comes in 1 to 2 times a week and always has good service, but he also said \\"im easy to please\\".\\n  A couple minutes past and our waitress was back to tell me they didnt' have shock top.  Are you serious? Who doesn't carry it? Also, how come she didn't know that?   Yes, Tilted Kilt doesn't.  its a name of beer that is becoming very popular in central florida, do the research.  blue moon is similar, but yesterday's news.   However, she didn't show up with my friends beer, which is just a pour from the tap.  however, i sided with blue moon. \\n 5-10 rolls by and I said to tony, \\"look, maybe its just me but the place is slow in the dining area, we are a huge table, she only took two beer orders from us and its close to 10 mins and I don't have a beer that is on tap\\".\\n  He shrugged and said \\"maybe you're right, its you\\".  We laughed and just about that time she shows up with two beers.  yes, just two beers, exactly what I said earlier.  She was only waiting on another table, so she had our big party and one other table.  I shouldve had that beer in under 5 mins.  5 mins to sit and wait for a beer on tap is a long time.  Maybe it was the bartenders fault?  if so, she could've said \\"sorry it took so long\\".  but, nothing from her, so that says to me, 10 mins wait time for a beer is normal.  but during a slow time??  Interesting.\\n  As our party grew larger I started to get hungry.  flipping open the menu which as others has described it, \\"over priced\\", I noticed almost everything is fried.  Sorry, i don't eat fried food and being that our economy is 2/3 obese, its nice to think the healthy eating movement has reached their menu, nope, it hasn't.  I guess when they get the memo on Shock Top, they'll offer a few appetizers not deep fried.  \\n  Our party was 30 people deep, I had a couple of beers and smell of greasy food was enough.  \\n  \\n  While the service seemed a little better because the girl was actually putting on a show that she tried, I still think there is some lack of acknowledgment that beer on tap should arrive quicker.  With the prices being slightly higher than surrounding places, I need more than skimpy outfits to make up for just \\"par\\" service.  However, if you're satisfied with that level of service, thats fine.\\n  Having given them several attempts, I won't be back for another go around. I wish them luck but I can't support the business nor can I refer anyone to them.  I'm giving them one additional star for the effort."},{"name":"Life of Pie Pizza","address":"3632 N Williams Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"My wife and I have been on a wood-fired margherita pizza kick trying as many different ones in the city as possible.

It may be long, but I think it's more helpful than a tweet-sized snippet. \\n\\nFor years we'd been moaning about the lack of a decent Asian food market on the east side. Making the trip to little Vietnam for knock-offs and moldy galangal wasn't my idea of fun. And few of them combine produce with product with food service.\\n\\nSo, where is one to get duck eggs, kimchi, bok choy (baby and large), mango, dried squid, Pocky, cases of noodles (many, many kinds), \\"suicide\\" soda's and sit down for veggie buns (spicy),  tea and mango smoothie in one place? \\n\\nThis place!\\n\\nIt just opened and, boy, are we happy to have them so near us. They're selection is wide, varied and larger than anything I've seen locally. And by that, I mean a 700 mile radius. They have fresh produce, tofu (spiced and un, hard and soft) a wide selection of soy sauces (yes, there are many different kinds of soy sauce although you wouldn't know it from the typical markets), a varied selection of authentic noodles (not that crap you ate - or are eating - in college) so many ingredients, spices, sauces and vegetarian options it made my head spin -after I stopped my swooning. \\n\\nWhat makes it even better is it's a family run shop and much of their produce is local. If you're lucky you can meet the whole family. I guess its two brothers who run the place and both will answer any questions and talk directly to you as a valued guest. It's obvious they respect their offerings and treat them with care and pride. As mentioned, they did just open so if you don't see something, they will make an effort to get it ordered for you. Their father makes a wicked vegetarian bun that he's been perfecting for over 17 years. And on the topic of vegetarianism, the whole family is vegetarian. So, they know.\\n\\nWhich means, of course, if you're looking for meat this isn't really the place. Of course there are plenty of places to find that fare. This is an oasis in a desert of instant noodles and Americanized Chung-king egg rolls. And will certainly open the eyes of anyone who thinks MSG (otherwise known as \\"flavor\\") is a bad thing.\\n\\nBut wait! There's more! The bonus to all this is? \\n\\nTheir prices are AWESOME. For everything we bought I was shocked to have only spent $22. They could raise their prices and no one would bat an eye (but don't tell them that).\\n\\nBy the way, if you're seeking the elusive high-grade Shaoxing cooking wine, it's here.

But I don't think that it's a cleanliness issue (the place was really pretty clean tonight) and i don't think that they are doing anything to make that happen - it's just SO much food and so much grease. I totally agree with posters who talk about a half pound burger being huge. Unghhh! Too much food! I mean, do you really expect to eat all that greasy food and not feel a little queasy? Unless you're eating it every day, it's going to get to you a little. But I see some people are saying they're not getting enough food. My God, how?\\n\\nYou know what you're getting into but it's STILL SO GOOD. seriously.\\n\\nThey screwed up my burger. I am a vegetarian, and my bf eats meat with about every meal. We both got a Willie Nelson - they confused our orders and ended up weighing down my veggie burger with a bunch of bacon. I knew if I sent it back we'd be waiting another 20 minutes for me to get my meal. I deconstructed my burger and made them give me a new bun, but they weren't dickish about it, which I totally appreciate. It also made up for the fact that they brought our appetizer out with the food, which sucks.\\n\\nI was kind of bummed that because I had to deconstruct my burger, I missed a lot of stuff I was excited about - like the honey barbecue sauce. Part of me is a total cheap ass that gets really irritated when we spend that kind of money on something ($33!) and it's not 100% perfect, but that burger is GOOD. You can tell it's made on a grill. And the cheese is just ridiculously, incredibly, awesomely good.\\n\\nI laughed when I read the guy's review about getting a money shot of government cheese in the face. Maybe I am a sick person but I am totally cool with getting a hot money shot of government cheese in the face and would be glad to pay for it again.Possibly on camera.  However I think it's a bit too much food for me on the regular. It'll definitely be a once in a while treat. I recommend everyone try it once. There are a lot of P.O.ed people on Yelp about Mom's - go at night when it's not super busy and enjoy yourself. The only reason I am docking a star is that they screwed up my burger so bad.

The fritter was bursting with fresh, tasty, moist crabmeat with a light, crispy coating.  Too good to share!\\n\\nWe went with red snapper and a vegetable plate for entrees- and we shared once again.  The red snapper was very fresh - and lightly cooked to perfection. Vegetables included spinach, turnips, collards, and roasted asparagus.  The asparagus was large, but not the least bit tough. The turnips were the best that I have ever had, hands down.  Dessert was a moist warm toffee cake, just the right touch for the end of the meal.  Our server told us that people drive miles to eat that cake.  I can believe it.\\n\\nI have seen mention of slow service another reviews; but ours was anything but slow.  Our server was always there at the right time.

On the second visit we had to ask another waitress to go get our food because everybody around us, who came after we ordered, were already being served and our waitress was nowhere to be found.

But if you're used to authentic Chinese food, you may be disappointed since you may not get what you're expecting. \\n\\nFor example, I ordered ma po tofu the last time I ate here. A typical ma po tofu is stir-fried in a spicy szechuan style chili sauce with bits of pork or beef and served with a side of white rice. The ma po tofu here is deep fried and basted on what tastes like general tso's sauce, with no meat in it, and served with a side of broccoli. It tasted fine... but it was not ma po tofu. Had they called it general tso's tofu, I would be a lot less annoyed. \\n\\nWe also ordered oolong tea, which had a significantly floral flavor to it... like jasmine tea.

Although, the sauce was quite tasty and I enjoyed some of it with my pork. The pork was great, but next time I will leave more room for the brisket. Same goes with the sausage.

I love that they serve items such as Omuraisu and Oyakodon, and I look forward to coming back to try a few of these dishes with family, regardless of what I am about to say below. \\n\\nWhen you see the words \\"tea house\\", you expect the focus to be on tea and light fare, however, here, the tea menu is very small, and instead of highlighting tea farms and what makes the teas special, you are offered an extremely simple menu of several green teas, all generically named, I.e.: matcha, hojicha...etc, and coffee. The emphasis seems to be on lattes, and not on pure tea. (This may very well be the owners intention, but a bit of a disappointment nevertheless). In the world of increasing specialty coffee establishments where the farmer and farms are highlighted, and you are allowed to explore the various regions and terroir, it would be nice to have seen even something slightly like this here. \\n\\nThe space is large, nicely designed with touches such as a living wall, rattan chairs and tasteful seating arrangement and great chairs & furniture.

Surely there are better quality Japanese options to these super low quality sugar drinks? Again, it just doesn't fit into the expectations one has when entering a \\"tea house\\" \\n\\nFinally my last comment is that if you are coming here for just a tea and a pastry, and you see a long line, expect to wait anywhere between 20 min. to half an hour...for a drink. There has to be a better way for someone ordering a drink or tea to get through the line quicker. \\n\\nI want this place to be successful..it's truly a pretty space, but everything seems so watered down, generic,  and the small details that normally underline Japanese caf√© and tea service are completely missing."},{"name":"Helen Asian Kitchen","address":"1070 E Dublin Granville Rd","city":"Columbus","stars":"3.5","text":"The best Sichuan Spicy Chinese Restaurant ever in Columbus, OH."},{"name":"Athan's Bakery","address":"1621 Beacon St","city":"Brookline","stars":"3.5","text":"I'm a huge fan of their chocolate croissants.

We had heard so many good things  from friends visiting the Melbourne location. \\nOur first visit just after opening was a bust before we even ordered food. Our drink order included coffee, which they served in a carafe with empty cup. The first cup was brought to the table with grease all around the rim. It was given back to the waitress, who promptly returned with a second dirty greasy rimmed cup. In the meantime a roll of silverware was unraveled to find dried rice on the fork. We informed the manager who was nicely apologetic and understood our desire to leave without paying for the dirty coffee. \\nMonths have gone by, we both had rough days at work, didn't want to cook and so decided to try our luck again. Surely they've ironed out the kinks....wrong! \\nWe were immediately seated (thank you), it was obvious they had just finished a rush as many tables were still soiled with the remnants of previous guests, but that's understandable.

My daughter was interested in a Cajun pasta, but was concerned it would be too spicy. Jose wisely suggested she substitute regular Alfredo sauce for the Cajun Alfredo. Great idea, or so I thought (this subject to be continued later). I ordered the Dijon and Mushroom chicken, everything was cooked well, but I didn't love the flavor of the sauce. No ones fault so I ate what I liked and called it a day.  The final meal at the table was Sirloin and Chicken fingers with the steak ordered medium. How disappointing to have a piece of shoe leather delivered to the table. At this point it's late, we're tired and the fight had already been beaten out of us for the day. It was decided we would just let it go. Even if we had wanted to return the steak Jose was nowhere to be found. It's been quite some time, but general rule when waiting tables is to check back after the first bite to ensure all food is properly cooked. Right? Instead Jose finally appeared again as we were finishing. All we wanted at this point was a box and extra napkins for my 11 year old. \\nRemember that great idea to switch the Alfredo sauces? What a surprise to get our bill and find out we were charge for the regular Alfredo as if it were additional sauce. When I asked Jose about the charge I was informed it was an up charge. Ridiculous! \\nAgain, I had no fight left in my soul for the day. I just gave a disapproving look and said \\"whatever\\" (mature, I know) as I handed over our cards. I requested the bill be split down the middle and half charged to each card. We often do this and usually there's only a difference of a penny.  Someone please tell me how the two bills returned with a $3 difference. This is basic math people! Something I would hope a person working for tips and handling cash can calculate. Then again, as I'm signing the checks I see where math is no longer a necessity and they've given you the proper amounts for tipping 18% and higher. Sorry Jose, that wasn't 18% service. Luckily, I remember basic math and was still able to tip a deserving 10% (the lowest tip I've given in years). \\nCheddar's I hope you take this review seriously and make some very necessary changes.

I'm sure I've spent hundreds of dollars there by now. It's my favorite restaurant; they have consistently quality food and customer service. I've never sent anything back or complained because there has never been a reason to. \\n\\nA few weeks ago I went in and ordered take-out. I ordered the Tom Yum soup that I had just recently had there and had been craving ever since. After I placed my order, I asked the hostess if it was too late to change it to the Tom Yum noodles with the spicy red broth instead of the traditional sweet and sour broth. She was able to talk the kitchen into changing it, which I appreciated. When my order finally came out, I checked to make sure they gave me the red spicy broth and discovered they hadn't. I told the hostess and she replied that she had specifically asked them for the red broth and she would have them fix it. My order came out again and I looked at the broth, which looked slightly darker than the first one but definitely not red. (Note that I know what this is supposed to look like since I had just eaten it a few weeks prior to this and several times before that.)\\n\\nAt that time, a customer walked in and asked for a table of 16. I didn't feel comfortable asking the hostess to check my order again because they were so busy so I left, hoping it was correct. It wasn't. I ended up throwing out the broth because I didn't really care for it. I messaged Thai Bloom on Yelp and almost immediately received a reply from Nam, the floor manager, who apologized, told me she would \\"look into it\\" and credit my account. I wasn't sure if she meant my bank account or a credit at the restaurant and after a few days of not seeing a refund in my checking account, I wrote to her again on April 11th asking for clarification. I received no reply. I waited a few days and sent another message. Still nothing. I sent a THIRD message and no reply. I then sent a Facebook message and as of 8 am on April 17th, still no reply. \\n\\nI don't really even care about the money (although the soup was nearly 15 bucks!) I'm just extremely disappointed and angry that I'm being ignored. This is horrible customer service.

Last night our party of four started with the Lobster Ravioli with Beurre Blanc Sauce.  It is a consistent favorite with a light delicate sauce. My companion and I had the hand cut Tuna Tartare with oranges that had beautiful, artistic presentation.  Along with the Tuna were some thinly sliced and fried potatoes that were like crackers.  I could have made a meal of this alone. The taste was fresh with wonderful oils and flavors accompanied by Wasabi. We used the great bread to wipe up the plate is was so good.  The other party had the Bibb Lettuce Salad with Buffalo Mozzarella and Tomato that they said was very delicate and tasty.  The quality of the Olive Oil and Balsamic were top notch. The two ladies had the the Maine Lobster Meuniere  for an Entree and both felt it was as good as it gets.  A delicate butter sauce accompanied the lobster.  The other gentleman had a delicious Veal Chop, and I had the Barramundi which is similar in texture  to Sea Bass.  The skin and the Fish was cooked to perfection.  It was accompanied by a melody of tomatoes, cubed bread, olives, onions and finely diced cucumber in a fantastic oil and vinegar dressing.  I shared it  with every one at the table it was so good.  Once again the bread was used to wipe up all the bits from the plate.The veg was crisp and flavorful as well. We finished the evening with Warm Verona Cake.  This dessert is not overly sweet, and makes a wonderful finale to a spectacular meal. The dessert was artistically  presented like most of the food.   The wine is reasonable, and the list is quite extensive for a restaurant this size.  I am more than glad to drive an hour from Denver to dine at one of my favorite restaurants in the world.

It's a welcome addition, open relatively late (11PM) on Friday and Saturday nights, which is nice if you happen to be downtown and hungry, as we were.  They have valet parking right out front, but honestly folks, this is Columbus, Ohio - as long as you're willing to circle the block a couple of times, there's plenty of on-street parking.  It's not like you'll have an epic search for a space like in Philly or NYC.\\n\\nThe restaurant itself has a young, hip vibe, although that doesn't mean you'll be out of place if you're not.  One word of warning - avoid the uppermost end of the lower floor in the winter - the staff walks in and out of the doors at that end, and you will freeze when the cold air comes through the doors.\\n\\nThe menu is roughly broken into three things - sushi, burgers, ramen.  Echoing Shuo F., this is Asian fusion food, not traditional dishes.  So as long as that's your mindset, it's a pretty decent meal.  My burger was topped with kimchi, Korean doenjang bean paste, and accompanied by truffle fries; basically a burger with an Asian spin, the same way the Crest would give you a burger with a Middle Eastern spin.\\n\\nAs for the ramen, how pleased you will be with it will largely depend on your yardstick.  If you're looking for traditional ramen like you would find at Minca in NYC or Yamadaya in LA, this is not your place.  If you're looking for a nice bowl of wavy noodles in soup, it's pretty solid, especially on a cold winter night.

But I'd sort of blocked our visit to Your Mom's out of my head until recently, and our story was worth telling.\\n\\nMy husband and I love burgers, so we decided to try this place for my birthday lunch awhile back since it had gotten such rave reviews from fellow Yelpers. What a disappointment! First of all, it was really confusing if we were supposed to order at the counter or if there was waiter service. The guy behind the counter didn't greet us or make any motion to if we were supposed to order there or not. Since there was all of 2 feet of space near the counter, we decided to just grab a menu, sit at a table, and go back and order when we had decided what to eat. While we were looking, a guy came up and took a drink order. Oh, okay, that's great--waiter service it is. But he never came back with our two iced teas, and instead spent his time half-assedly cleaned a table and yelling across the tiny dining room to a woman who was presumably his mother. Since he had taken a drink order and said he'd be back to take our food order, we waited. And waited. And waited some more. Finally, we gave up and my husband went up to the counter to order our lunch. And of course, as soon as he got up, Mom came over and asked if we were ready to order (even though she'd passed by multiple times without a word to us until that moment).\\n\\nI should also mention that we were sitting at a booth in a sort of closed in patio--it was a nice day, so there was mesh for \\"walls\\" which let in lots of fresh air. But not enough fresh air because there was a sewer cover right next to our table, and boy oh boy, Austin must have had some stomach problems that day because it was RANK. A slight breeze would come through, and we'd feel a little better. But then it was back to absolute ass-y stank. How appetizing! And it's not like we could have moved to a different table--there were only maybe 6 tables out there, and they were all within a turd's throw to the manhole cover to Sewage Hell.\\n\\nSo imagine our unhappiness when it literally (and I swear I'm not exaggerating) took 50 MINUTES for our two burgers to show up at our table. I had read the reviews and expected a little bit of a wait for our handcrafted delights, but really? Nearly an f'in HOUR to mush some crap up into a burger and cook it? It'd better be damn good. And it wasn't. It was okay. I got the Buffalo Bill, what was supposed to be a burger version of the whole spicy and ranchy thing. But it was overstuffed with bacon, jalapenos, and cheese, and I honestly couldn't taste any of it. It was a half pound of greasy glop, and no particular taste was distinguishable. My husband had gotten the Frida Kahlo, and we had hoped that the odd mish-mash of ingredients was one of those instances where it sounded odd but was a thing of genius. No, it's just odd to have a fried egg, avocado, and chipotle-lime sauce in the same place. And even though Your Mom's boasts about the quality of their beef, after all the crap they put on each burger, good luck telling if you're eating beef or just greasy laundry. The onion rings were also close to inedible. I love big beer battered onion rings, but these were like big greasy donuts that happened to have a little onion stuck in the middle. And considering it was $3.75 for the order, we expected more than the 5 onion donuts that were in there. Oh, and we were only offered refills on our iced tea once...after we were done eating, which was nearly two hours after we got there.\\n\\nLess-than-crappy service. Lackluster burgers that try too hard to be \\"original.\\" Way too long of a wait. And a dining room that smells like rancid poop. Naw, I think I'll avoid Your Mom's from now on.

You also get bread and oil while you are waiting for your food. \\n\\nAs for the food, I used to absolutely LOVE the burgers, but it has been several years since I have gotten one, so I can't comment on them now. What I do love is the red sangria. That took me totally by surprise as I was honestly not expecting much, but it is really, really good. The penne Italia with penne, sausage, and tomato basil sauce was good. It tastes just like expected. The turkey tips (w/broccoli and rice pilaf) came with a light coating of BBQ sauce and were not too dry, which was appreciated. The steak tips probably would have been better, but I realized that when I ordered them. I also got a really tasty salad one time with chicken and dried cranberries. It was on the specials list, but I have seen it there over the past several months.\\n\\nOne thing I did not like were the mashed potatoes that came with my salmon with lemon caper sauce.I think this was another special.  The salmon was tasty, but I really couldn't finish the mashed potatoes. They seemed too watery and tasteless. \\n\\nOverall, this place is fine to grab lunch or dinner. It can be crowded on the weekends, and one Tuesday night they were having trivia, but I'm not sure how frequently they have it.

I have done a couple of reviews that I have regretted the manner in how I did them. This includes the one I did of La Barbecue. I did not give La Barbecue a fair shake. It was rainy so I could not get any good pictures. The rain affected the whole experience. I have been back numerous times, and I was going to make this visit count. There has been a lot of buzz about them lately. The Austin American-Statesman named it the best barbecue place in town. After my visit, Fed Man Walking wrote that La Barbecue was also the best in Austin. The line on this Wednesday was definitely longer than what I have experienced in the past. Although I got there when La BBQ opened, I waited about an hour before I got to the counter.\\n\\nWhen I got to front, I saw that pitmaster John Lewis was cutting the meat. I have had the pleasure in the past to talk to him. He is a nice dude. They always give you a bite of the brisket when you are ordering at the window. That one bite can make you weak at the knees. I ordered my usual Holy Trinity of Texas barbecue (brisket, pork ribs, and sausage). I actually got both cuts of brisket this time. The moist and lean were both phenomenal. Lewis does stray from the normal salt and pepper rub. He also uses mustard and pickle juice?! The deepness of the post oak smoke combined with his rub makes you see stars when you are eating the brisket. It is like you are having an out of body experience where you are hovering above your body watching yourself eat it. Both cuts are so juicy and flavorful that I might have to keep ordering the lean when I come back again.\\n\\nThe sublime experience does not end at the brisket. The pork ribs were quite excellent. They were on the saucier side but still tasted great. The tender meat was barely hanging on to the bone. The smoke and the glaze create this wonderful awakening for your taste buds. Last time I gave the sausage AKA hot guts no justice. I was definitely hating on it. I blame it on the rain. It is one of the best all beef sausages out there. Normally beef sausages are drier, but John did a good job mixing the different ingredients together. Having a good fat ratio also helps. The snappy casing could barely hold in the gritty mixture. The spice was nice too.\\n\\nLa Barbecue never ever disappoints. I have never had a time when I went that I thought that it was just \\"good.\\" It always freaking awesome. When you are there next time, consider getting the El Sancho \\"loco\\" style. It is a sandwich filled with chopped beef, pulled pork, and sliced hot link with pickled red onions. So basically a three-meat between two buns. I have also had the beef rib in the past.

It was super fun, the food came out quickly, and we all had a great time. We all got soup and shared some appetizers and they were all delicious. My aunt doesn't like spicy food and the waiter was helpful in aiding her select options that she would like. \\n\\nI ended up getting the tandoori chicken. While it was a little difficult to eat with a fork and knife, otherwise it was perfect. I actually caved and used my hands and ate it off the bone. Full of flavor, the chicken came with a delicious yogurt sauce, roasted veggies, and naan. I devoured every last tasty bite. Everyone else at the table all enjoyed their food and we all finished everything. The owner came back after we left and thanked us for coming and asked us to come back and tell friends about the new renovation.

I had the slaw and the broccoli, and both were YUM!  My hubby had the ribs and liked them but they were a bit spicy for him. We had never had Pork cheeks, so we ordered one cheek and that was tender and also quite good.   I thought they both had a great smoke flavor and liked them alot, but I could do with a bit less rub.  The beans were ok, but you must have the corn muffin with bacon and I don't know what else; but we saved it for dessert it was so good!

The polenta could have been better in my opinion though, but who cares when everything else is so good?\\n\\nThen there's the lamb burger. The spices were great--it uplifted the moist ground lamb into something very remarkable. I only a bite from my friend's, but man, it made me want to get one! (And I would have, except I still had a ton of food to finish).\\n\\nThe soft-shelled crab sandwich was merely OK. But who gets seafood at an Austin trailer park? Just go for the pork and lamb, and you'll be fine!\\n\\nAnd I also ordered a side of croquettes, which came out hot, crispy on the outside, and oh-so-soft on the side--everything croquettes should be.\\n\\nGiggling Goat reminds me of Odd Duck.

Both were delicious and I left uncomfortably full.

Very very good BBQ, and we had a ton of it all week. I dislike lines, but at least there's overhead tarps that block out the baking sun, and it moves pretty fast. Still took an hour, but expected worse. So busy for a weekday--nobody works I guess, or everyone works nearby and waits for lunch. I'd get here right when they open, or a little before, to minimize the wait time. I know you can order ahead, but since we had some time, we waited. There's two windows, one for ordering the meat, and the other for paying/ordering sides and drinks. Seems it could be faster if they combined all the food into one window, and you paid at the second one (and just ordered drinks there). Since you can't order sides at Window 1, you still have to wait for them at Window 2. Not a huge delay, but still, when you've been standing for an hour plus just to get to the front, you're looking for any excuse to finish the transaction, sit down and dig in. Guess there's a method to the BBQ madness, and maybe it'd take longer to do the sides at Window 1. Wish they had the beef rib, but I guess that's very popular--they sold out in about four hours that day. The El Sancho Loco sandwich I had had all three meats (pulled pork, chopped meat, sausage), so I could try it all. Very very good. Loved the sauce. I love the potato salad at BBQ joints, and the one here was also good. Try to stake out a table out of the sun, or else you'll cook out there--it's very warm with the smokers being nearby (they have like three of them in a separate screened in trailer next to the ordering trailer). No water available outside, from what I've seen (thought there'd be a Igloo cooler nearby or something), so BYO. The truck is literally parked on grass in a nearby park with other food trucks around it, so make sure you look for the signs pointing you to the fenced in area, and enjoy some authentic Texas goodness."},{"name":"Ovation Coffee & Tea","address":"941 NW Overton St","city":"Portland","stars":"5","text":"Drinks were fine, service was nice, but TBH, I'm not sure I get the hype about this place.

The way to each Korean BBQ is to wrap the rice, BBQ and whichever side dish you like into the lettuce.  Don't forget to use the chilli bean paste sauce if you like spicy. It makes the whole combination just really, really good. There's something about the warm rice and BBQ, combined with the fresh crunchy lettuce and side dishes that makes it all work.

I wish I'd opted for something else after all the other chips. The salsa was very spicy but I love spicy! If you're not a fan of spicy then maybe opt out on that. The tacos were great though! There was a nice portion of fish and a hint of sweetness was present in the batter... Combined with the spicy salsa made for a pretty good entree. \\n\\nThey have TV's practically everywhere and two huge projectors making it perfect for a sports bar. They have a pretty good selection of beers too. I'll definitely be coming back here to watch the games. \\n\\nOh yeah! This place is pretty much an Irish Hooters but way skimpier.

The portion was also quite big, definitely enough for at least 2 people to split. \\n\\nWe all had entree-sized pastas for our main course, I had the black spaghetti with prawns and clams - SO delicious! As the type of garlic-lover who always has at least several heads sitting in a bowl beside my stove for easy access at all time, I guess I'm a little biased, but I loved this dish. There was tons of garlic, perfectly done peas (no mushiness!) and some sort of meaty-saussagy thing. Amazing.\\n\\nMy dining companions had the bolognese (very good and hearty) and the rabbit papparedelle, which to die for. Rabbit can get very dry but this was slowly braised and totally mouthwatering. \\n\\nThe service was great although they were pretty busy, they sat us at a good table despite not having a reservation and were very friendly and attentive.\\n\\nAt the end of the meal we paid $140 for all of that AND a really wonderful bottle of wine, which seemed perfectly reasonable.

Pigs in a blanket - Oh my, the \\"blanket\\" was wonderfully doughy and the meat flavorful. \\n\\n4. Crispy green beans - Similar to tempura vegetables at Sushi restaurants but with less tempura. The samboli aioli for dipping is what really made this dish. \\n\\nWhat I liked: \\n\\n1. Grilled cheese - Since they use thick Texas toast like bread, they need to be a tad more generous with the cheese. \\n\\n2. Crepinette - Had great flavor but was on the greasy side. The herb salad on the other hand was very complimentary and had a nice tangy vinaigrette. \\n\\nThis is a very cool new restaurant & bar with a relaxed vibe.

There is plenty of parking there. They offer buffet style daily for lunch and dinner, and you can also order a la carte. My friend and I decided to do buffet style. Since we went on a Saturday night it was around $28 each for the buffet. \\n\\nTo order you check off what you want on a piece of paper. I didn't like that since that was also the menu, you had no idea what was any of the rolls. So my friend and I decided on edamame, tempura veggies, some cuts of sashimi, a few rolls and one of the \\"sushi pizza's\\". \\n\\nThe apps came out quickly and were great, and the sashimi came next, followed by 2 rolls. We finished what was in front of us and the waitress came back and asked if we wanted to order anything else. We reminded her that we were still waiting on 2 rolls and the pizza. She apologized, the rolls came out shortly after that, but no pizza. We asked about it again and she said that they are making it. We finished the rolls and again were asked if we wanted anything, we declined and said we are just waiting on the pizza. About 10 minutes after that the pizza finally came. \\n\\nIt wasn't even worth the wait. It was a patty of rice that was fried, with some salmon slices on top and spicy mayo. Meh, kind of weird. \\n\\nThe rolls were OK, too much rice though. \\n\\nI might come back, if I do it will be when the buffet is less expensive, or I will just order a la carte."},{"name":"Spokesman Coffee - St Elmo","address":"440 E Saint Elmo Rd, Ste 2","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"Was driving through Austin (I'm from Dallas area) and looking for some caffeine from a local coffee shop.

You'll walk out of here smelling like a dirty ashtray. If you're allergic or prone to respiratory complications, do not come here. Albeit, a large pool hall with about 25 tables, darts, and flatscreens showing different games.  The spot is a bit congested, right off of the Lake Buena Vista area, right in Orlando's hotel district.  What turned me off about this place were the ridiculously overpriced rates for using a pool table. I realize it was a Friday night, and there were a few of us in our group but $40 for two pool tables, involving less than 1.5 hrs of usage is excessive no matter which city you find yourself in. Some people in our group didn't even play, yet we were all charged a flat rate as if we had. It turns out that there is a per person charge per table on a timed basis.  Apparently the tables are free to use only on Tues. from what I was told by the bartenders. Typical O-town, tourist trap nonsense. I honestly should have known better, given where Backstage is located.\\n\\nI had high hopes for this pool hall, since it was our first time there, but was utterly disappointed in their overall setup of this establishment.

This was one of the best restaurants I've been to for Italian food, definitely one of the higher end restaurants. I went with a group of co-workers this past week and it was amazing. We had many of the appetizers, including the mozzarella which was unlike ANY you'd normally have (amazingly soft texture, the aroma/taste was buttery and so fresh!) and the oysters were amazing (I normally never eat oysters, these were baked with cheese and I had 4 of them!). I had their signature dish, veal over risotto, was delicious and tender. Then the blueberry tiramisu was light and totally delicious (I thought I was completely full and wanted others to help share dessert, but after one bite, I knew this was definitely not for sharing!). \\n\\nThe ambiance was amazing. I sat upstairs and didn't see the downstairs (didn't know they had one) so I suppose that may account for some of the differences between my experience and others. From my experience, it felt like you were transported to someplace in Europe. Because it's in a restored older house, the dining rooms are cozy and each have a lot of character. Combined with the views overlooking the quiet side streets of the North End, I think it's definitely a romantic place to go. The whole time I was there, I was thinking of going back with my husband. Also, I don't know about some of the other waiters, but our waitress was knowledgable, bubbly, and very courteous. As a final note, it was a really nice gesture that the chef had extra complimentary appetizers delivered to our table.

Also, we had made a reservation for a table that could accommodate a mobility impaired patron and the reservation was found but not the specific table request and then it took more discussion than should be necessary to get an appropriate table (there were empty, appropriate tables visible from the door). The space was also very tight and even us non-mobility-impaired folks had issues getting to and from the front door without having to back down the aisle or get really friendly with strangers to get around other patrons and wait staff.

I had never been so I thought, why not?  One more notch on my Yelp belt, a superbly built high quality alligator leather belt of reviews of course.\\n\\nIt was fairly slow due to it being a Tuesday night, but nevertheless it made it easier for me to capture the moment without much distraction.  The interior is rather bland, leaving something to be desired, or maybe the lack of diners made it seem this way; not lively.  We were promptly sat at a table by the window, which was nice, by a waiter who looked exactly like the star of the former hit series Monk; Tony Shalhoub.  What made the comparison even more uncanny was this gentleman's behavior and mannerisms which were filled with meek and submissive body language.  Luckily, he was not as weird as Monk and proved to be a very nice server who was extremely courteous.  No complaints there.\\n\\nThe music selection being played was rather depressive.  It made me casually wonder if they were expecting to sit a funeral party at any moment, but I digress.\\n\\nWe ordered one appetizer, 'Safiha,' and an entr√©e of Shish Kabob and Kafta Kabob.  \\n\\nThe Safiha was decent (see my picture), but nothing exceptional.  It came with a good amount of meat in its center and with a fluffy shell reminiscent of some sort of pastry.  Luckily , my company is an expert in culinary arts and promptly reacted to this by dowsing the Safiha in some much needed olive oil among other things.  Being a self-starter, creative guy, I copied her actions and did the same to my Safiha.  It helped the taste a bit, kind of like taking a navy wing tip shoe and putting red laces on it.  It didn't do much to detract from an already 'uniquely Arabic' dish, but it did give it a bit more 'oomph.' \\n\\nThe Shish Kabob (see my picture) was also good, but nothing to write home about.  Even though I am writing this at home.  Huh.\\n\\nThe portion is very generous so that is a major plus.  The dishes come with a side of rice and vegetables, but I simply opted for two sides of vegetables instead.  They were well seasoned enough to stand on their own without the accompanying lamb kabob.  The meat was a bit overcooked and I was surprised that the Monk doppelg√§nger did not ask me at what temperature I wanted it.  Nevertheless, I enjoyed the food.  I tried the kafta and it was very tasty.  This was the one stand-out item, so I'm recommending it.\\n\\nOverall, prices are reflective of the quality and portion.  There is an outdoor patio and apparently it can get pretty energetic there during the weekends with dances and entertainment.\\n\\nIf you enjoy this type of cuisine like I do, it's worth a try.

The Tinga Poblana, I'm afraid, was a very poor dish.

What turned me off about this place were the ridiculously overpriced rates for using a pool table. I realize it was a Friday night, and there were a few of us in our group but $40 for two pool tables, involving less than 1.5 hrs of usage is excessive no matter which city you find yourself in. Some people in our group didn't even play, yet we were all charged a flat rate as if we had. It turns out that there is a per person charge per table on a timed basis.

The fried cauliflower was great, the green tomatoes not so much, and the shrimp and calamari in the middle.  The short ribs was nicely smoked, but otherwise boring and seemed more like a pot roast; it needed a sauce.  It came over red peas which were a type of beans, that was pretty good but too cold.

With that said, I've had both great experiences and terrible ones. I think that when Helen's originally opened a while back, it was a fantastic and authentic Chinese place. The dishes were always fresh and yummy! However, over the past year or so, I've noticed a huge decline in quality. I'm not sure if it's because they're backed up with orders or if they're cutting corners somewhere but, I was really disappointed the last couple times I went here. Unfortunately, I think that I won't be coming back because I just don't want to chance it. \\n\\nIn the beginning Helen's was a treasure find! Authentic hole-in-the-wall joint. Weird location, somewhat seedy strip mall area across from an old bowling alley, lots of excessively bright and tacky decorations, but the food did all of the talking! Fresh, super flavorful and truly fantastic dishes! She even gave me an entire order of dumplings one time for FREE because I was eyeballing them on the menu but didn't have enough cash on me to add them to my order.  \\n\\nThe last couple of times... not so great. The Eggplant with garlic sauce suddenly had ground meat (pork?) in it. Previously it did not which is why, being vegan, I ordered it. That mishap made me sad since it's an awesome dish and even sadder because I had no clue they changed the recipe until I was a couple of bites in. The rest of that meal was just meh to boot. Bland in actual flavor but super salty or super spicy to cover it up. \\n\\nOn my most recent trip here, the noodles were honestly horrible. Some of the worst I've ever had. Imagine soggy, greasy, flavorless spaghetti noodles with a major msg after-taste. The veggies were limp, sad and salty as well. Pretty much everything was just... sad lol. Side note: I have no idea if they use msg or not but I was drinking water like crazy and I barely touched the food. The stir fried cauliflower was decent but I've had wayyyyy better in the past from here. The Singapore noodles were actually the best dish that night flavor-wise. But again, so much salt/msg additive something that I could barely stomach even that dish. They were super busy on that night so I really want to give the restaurant the benefit of the doubt, but I'm not willing to gamble it at this point. I feel like after the last few times I could make better tasting Chinese food at home. XD \\n\\nBecause the prices are super reasonable, the owners are incredibly sweet, and they used to dish out amazing food I'm giving them the 4 stars. If I were to rate it on this past year of experiences though.. I'd honestly give it mayyyybe a 2 star rating. My advice, if you want to try it out for yourself and take the gamble, try and pick a day/time when they're least likely to be busy. Stay clear of weekend rushes and typical dinner/lunch hours. Stop by either a bit earlier or later than the usual and maybe you'll get a great meal! But... don't say I didn't warn you. \\n\\nI'm really hoping that this year goes better for the restaurant. Maybe it will turn around and go back to being the awesomeness it once was.

Cute, cozy, wine bar atmosphere, plenty of space available to be seated immediately. Small menu, my husband and I both ordered the eggs Benedict. I've seen other pictures on here that people have posted of this dish and it looked nothing like what we received. I ordered mine with the traditional ham. The english muffin was very, very charred; the ham was charred but not as much, egg was poached to perfection.. however the hollandaise sauce was a bright orange color, lacked any flavor, and it looked as though they squirted it on top of my eggs, about 5 drops worth each. All I could taste was the charred, burnt flavor of my muffin in each bite. I believe it was $12-14 for this dish and it does not come with any sides, those are an additional charge upward of $4+.

All of our drinks and food (off Happy Hour menu) were mediocre and lackluster. \\n\\nTo drink, I got the 'Weak in the Bee's Knees' off their seasonal sips selection. All I could taste when I got this drink was straight up gin. I normally love gin, but when I get a cocktail, I don't want the bitterness of gin to be the only thing I can taste! This was not a well balanced cocktail. \\n\\nTo eat, we got the pork belly tacos, duck fat fries, and brussel sprouts. \\n1) Pork Belly Tacos: The feta taste was very subtle but complimented the egg and slight saltiness of the pork belly. The pork belly was tender, fatty, and crispy just how I like it. At other places, I've been given really tough pieces of pork belly, so I'm really glad that Salty Sow made sure their pork belly was tender and fatty. While the Pork Belly was pretty yummy, it is nothing special. \\n2) Duck Fat Fries: I had high expectations for these fries as everyone was raving about it. It even made a Thrillist list for 'Best Fries in America!' Needless to say, I was disappointed. Sure the fries were crispy, but it didn't have the duck fat flavoring to it that I was expecting. I'll stick to my truffle fries from Hopdoddy. \\n3) Brussel Sprouts were good, but not as good as Uchi. Unlike Uchi's Brussel's Sprouts, you can still taste the slight bitterness of the brussel sprouts. It was roasted and the raisins gave it a slightly sweet taste. Maybe it was to compliment the bitterness? \\n\\nI probably would not come to Salty Sow again not when there are other Happy Hours I want to check out. None of the food or drinks particularly stood out to me. \\n\\nTIP: If you come with 2-3 people for Happy Hour and decide to order the Duck Fat Fries, order it off the main menu. It's $2.50 more but it's 3 times the Happy Hour size."},{"name":"Pat's Pizza","address":"2254 Dorchester Ave","city":"Dorchester Center","stars":"3.5","text":"I hear a lot of people don't like Pat's.

I was dining with my parents (vegan and vegetarians), and our server was very respectful and attentive of their dietary needs. He let us know that several of their dishes could be customized to suit the needs of vegetarians and was happy to make recommendations. It's rare to find a place that is so accommodating of various diets and we could not have been happier with our service at Hanabi. \\n\\nMy husband and I stuck to sushi and were pleasantly surpsired by the Crush On Me roll (tuna and goat cheese).

Tonight, though, I was looking to eat somewhere new and different... anyway, to make a long story short (too late!) - I ate there tonight, and I totally wasn't disappointed.\\n\\nRight after we were seated, a woman brought us a little plate of cheese quesadillas with a mysterious, zesty dipping sauce.  Though I'm more used to BBQ places giving you, say, complementary cornbread... or perhaps hush puppies... the quesadilla was pretty good (if basic), and it was an unexpected nice touch. \\n\\nMy boyfriend and I both ordered pulled pork sandwiches - I got baked beans and onion rings on the side, and he got cole slaw and onion rings.

The servers didn't seem to have dedicated tables, and we were served or otherwise attended to by about 4 different people while we were there. This wouldn't be bad normally, but in this case no one person seemed to pay attention to us when we needed a soda refill, etc...  And 2. The atmosphere could be a little better.

Each one has its own experience which is important when deciding which one to go to.  There's several things to think about as far as coming here.\\n\\n1. If you can't stand hanging out in the weather (it's too cold, hot, wet, dry, windy or whatever) don't come here (at least unless it's one of those rare prefect weather days in Austin) or see the item 2.\\n\\n2. If you aren't prepared to invest the time in line then look at the website to see if preorders are available and get your stuff to go.  If you have not much time to get to the airport or the wedding or the conference or whatever, you might want to try it when you have a little more tim. Or go to one of the merely excellent places in town with less of a line.  The line is part of the experience.  I can't tell you how many fascinating people I've met, how many amazing conversations I've had, and how much I've learned from local folks and people from all over the world in this line.  If that's not something that sounds good to you, then don't do it.\\n\\n3. If you don't want to be around dogs or the other occasional indigenous wildlife you'll find here, see #2. (OK, don't be scared, indigenous as in an occasional grackle) \\n\\n4. If you, like me, are a worshiper of Bacchus, bring a cooler and pack your own beer/wine/etc in, but be prepared on the weekend for some of the best beer in the world (that is as in any beer that's free) but also be prepared for it to run out if you're not here early enough.  \\n\\n5. Sauce.  IMHO, with the exception of pork (which needs it) sauce is only needed to hide poor bbq.  BUT that is only my preference.  If you are crazy for the sauce, don't be afraid to bring your own.  The do have a couple of styles of sauce on the tables.\\n\\n6. If you want cheap BBQ, go to a cheap place.  You might get your money's worth.\\n\\nEnough of that.  \\n\\nI've been coming here in all its locations.  I wrote a couple of years ago that if I had one meal left to me on this earth, it would be here.  The same is true today.

I have to say that the Hosts/Hostesses are always polite and on point. The servers? Not so much. I have consistently had stank and inefficient service from the wait staff here. Twice, I've had to have the bus-men do for me what the servers either didn't do or took too long to do, so guess who got the better tip? Fortunately, I never get the same rude/inefficient server twice,  or rather, they don't appear to stay on staff long.\\n\\nAs far as take-out is concerned, the wonderful hosts and hostesses take care of that. Once upon a time, the policy was that in order to take phone orders, you had to pay via credit card, which I assume keeps people from welching on the order, which is fine. Now, there is a strict no phone-in policy, period.  This is not only dumb as hell, but inconvenient. I work nearby, and the whole point of me phoning in an order is so that I can maximize my breaktime and be able to pick up my order and get gone.

When we came upon this little alcove with la Barbecue and a few other food trucks, I was charmed by what had become a familiar sight in Austin: trailers that serve you 5-star food. Spoiled traveler that I am, la BBQ wasn't even the first experience in Austin where I'd felt blown away. But that was before I even started eating our breakfast of champions. By the time we arrived at 10:57a.m., there was already a line forming. The truck finished their preparations right on time and took the first order at 11:01. \\n\\nWe decided to make our own sampler and got a 1/3 pound of brisket, 1 beef rib (they are massive, though mostly bone), 2 pork ribs (because we were told that we wouldn't want to share), 1 pork sausage, 1 side of slaw, 1 side of baked beans. Our server sliced and prepped the heavily seasoned meat (there was a nice bark of seasoning on the brisket, and you could see the ring of flavor) and plopped it onto a cafeteria tray with some paper on it. The grease immediately started pooling, and she wrote down what we'd gotten in Sharpie, the only writing instrument that stood a chance against the pool of fatty deliciousness around it. \\n\\nThough it was a gray day and everything was a little damp, it was also free beer Friday, so we filled up our plastic cups with (decent) beer from a keg (set up right next to the food truck), and sat down at some picnic tables to feast. And feast we did. By the 3rd or 4th bite, I realized that I was getting all the protein I would need for the week and I was getting full fast, but I could not stop eating because it was just all so good. The beef rib meat was so tender and creamy that it slipped off the bone and it sliced away with a plastic fork with nary a struggle. \\n\\nI personally enjoyed the pork ribs very much because it was a perfect amount of sauciness, but my boyfriend preferred the beef rib. The brisket was, of course, fantastic.

I had the ensalada a la jamaica, a spectacular salad with jicama and jamaica (hibiscus) and candied orange peel over arugula, then had the special chile relleno drowning in black bean sauce Oaxacan style (they prepare the beans with hoja de aguacate, avocado leaf, which lends a slight licorice flavor to the beans). My husband had the mole poblano with chicken breast. Tasting it brought me immediately back to Oaxaca. It was absolutely spectacular. Homemade corn tortillas (YES! And just a FYI, you don't get flour tortillas in Oaxaca, only corn), a trio of incredible homemade salsas with the bread (another typical Oaxacan touch -- the salsas are always homemade and they're served with the starter bread), a fantastic wine and drink list, including some of the best mescals (like Pierde Almas -- unreal!) -- I mean really, if we lived down here we'd eat at El Naranjo every week.

When we got in we noticed how small and cozy it was inside, but also very loud due to al the many people packed into a small place. The atmosphere was very nice though. The wait for our food wasn't too long and when we got it I was surprised at the portions, they seemed very small for barbecue, I was expecting a giant plate of meat, but instead was met with a small slice and small jars of sides as well. For an appetizer my sister had the deviled egg with sausage ( it was so good!! but very small for being $1.50!) and I had the cornbread with bacon chunks and drizzled with maple. The cornbread was okay. The bacon bits, which were added to just about everything, were incredibly good; probably the best bacon I've ever had. The meat was really crappy though, you would think that for being a barbecue place this would be their center focus, but the sides were way better. The chicken was so salty is was almost a chore to eat and the beef was dry and lacking flavor. The sides were delightful though. The mac and cheese was gooey and very cheesy, the baked beans were flavorful and rich and the coleslaw was great. If you're looking for amazing barbecue I would say try other places over this one."},{"name":"Subway","address":"3200 N High St","city":"Columbus","stars":"3","text":"Always a great place to stop for a quick meal that won't be full of grease!

We went on a Thursday night, hoping to catch happy hour, but sadly the wait was very long so we didn't make it. We waited about 30 minutes or so for a seat in the heated (thank god because it was definitely freezing outside) outdoor patio. We sat down and within a few minutes a waiter was out to serve us. He was super friendly and offered up lots of recommendations when we mentioned it was our first time here. We decided to start off with the fried brussel sprouts. They were delicious and one of the best things we got that night. Slightly sweet, slightly salty, crunchy, cheesy - just everything you really want in a bite of food. Who knew brussel sprouts could taste so good?! We also ordered the chicken liver mousse and the triple fried duck fat fries. The chicken liver mousse came with some pickled red onions which paired very well with the dish. The mousse itself was a bit dense and could have been a little smoother and creamier, but overall it was a solid dish. The duck fat fries were as they sounded, very ducky and very fried. They were very very crunchy and a bit on the greasier side (def wouldn't just order this as a meal). The poached egg on top was a nice touch (could have been a bit on the runnier side, but that's just me being picky). It came with a truffle sauce of some kind which was good, but wasn't needed for an already rich dish. Took away from the ducky flavor of it all. Next, for entrees, we got duck, crispy chicken, a beet and goat cheese salad, and the blackened red fish. I was very impressed by the crispy chicken thighs mostly because of the skin. I would have eaten a bowl of that skin plain if I could. The chicken itself wasn't too memorable. The duck was juicy and tender (cooked to perfection). Fish was aight. Not anything special. I'd skip it and get their pork or steak next time. The beet salad was also very typical and nothing too special. For the price I would just get another bowl of the fried brussel sprouts. Oh wait.. we did... cuz they were pretty darn good. Finally, to finish it all off, we got the butterscotch pudding for dessert. It was the other favorite of the night. We shared it between 4 people and just ended up ordering a second one because everyone was desperately scooping the edges of the jar hoping for more. The pudding itself was a little less smooth, but overall the flavors were there. The butterscotch sauce was amazing and I could have drank a whole cup full. If you're not a fan of salted caramel though, I do not recommend getting this because it is def similar to that.\\n\\nPros: \\n- good brussel sprouts\\n- dessert was good (heard the chocolate cake was good too but we were too full to try)\\n- happy hour has great prices if you can get in\\n- service was great (waiter was super nice)\\n- great little restaurant inside (nice decor and ambiance)\\n\\nCons:\\n- very crowded\\n- be picky with what you order (a lot of things you could get elsewhere so stick to what they are good at/what they recommend)"},{"name":"Big A Sub","address":"282 Highland Ave","city":"Malden","stars":"3","text":"I have ordered from here plenty of times never had a problem.

The only downside to this place is the service, it's never consistent, sometimes it's great sometimes it's not."},{"name":"Shula's 347 Grill - Lake Mary","address":"2974 International Pkwy","city":"Lake Mary","stars":"3.5","text":"I've only been to one Shula's and it was more of a full on steak house.  This location in Lake Mary, FL has a more casual but eclectic flair to it.  The menu has a couple of carnivore offerings, but they also have plenty of fish, salad and even sandwiches to choose from.  Their wine list was quite acceptable and our table had a Merlot, Pino Noir and a Malbec.  The wine served as our cocktail and accompaniment with our meal.\\n\\nThe waitstaff was not only good, they were entertaining!  They chatted us up, made sure we had everything we needed and ensured that our orders were received as we had placed.  Those of us on the end of the table shared bites among our fish and beef choices so we could taste our way through several offerings from the menu.\\n\\nDessert - had to have it!  Luscious decadent rich chocolate flourless cake with a raspberry coulis, an individual bourbon pecan pie and the rest of our wine finished of a great meal with great service.\\n\\nMany times business dinners can be stuffy and uncomfortable since you don't always know everyone very well.  Not true for this evening - the company was great, the conversations flowed like melted butter and everyone enjoyed their meal, wine and being treated to a wonderful evening out!"},{"name":"Arabian Nights Cafe","address":"1434 SW Park Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Lamb shank with rice is good, but it came late. Hummus is good, but the grape-leaves weren't so. They were so smooth that each falls from my fork each time I eat one. I'm sure they were canned. The soups also came late.

Confused host but finally seated us. Quick friendly service. Ordered drinks which were delivered. Manager then showed up and asked us to move to different table as the host didn't know there was a large party to be seated where we were. We had been served so that wasn't our problem. Manager comped some of our food but didn't make up for the rudeness and unpleasantness. Then came the ribs, which was the reason we came. Dry and tough. You literally had to saw with your knife to separate them. I'll never return."},{"name":"Harp & Celt Irish Pub & Restaurant","address":"25 S Magnolia Ave","city":"Orlando","stars":"4.5","text":"I want to give this place a higher rating, but I've only ever been during lunch during the week, and I can't go back.\\n\\nFirst, the staff is very friendly and the atmosphere is great. Unfortunately, the first time I went, our food took almost 45 minutes to come out. They admitted there was a mix-up with the orders, and they took care of us. The next visit, my Dubliner sandwich came out cold in the middle. They took it back and warmed it up, but I get the feeling it's microwaved roast beef. The 3rd time I went, same exact scenario: the sandwich came out cold/frozen in the middle. \\n\\nThis is strictly a lunch review, so I cannot speak about dinner or the bar, but I won't be going back for lunch."},{"name":"Tacos La Villa","address":"2415 Cobb Pkwy SE","city":"Smyrna","stars":"4.5","text":"The most authentic Mexican street food I've ever had.\\nI had a burrito with their barbeque meat, my wife had the steak burrito.  Both meats were very good.\\nThe burrito wrapper is different than I have had in the past.  It is softer and doesn't have the same taste as what I am familiar with.  The meat has a dry rub with pungent and full bore chiles in it, so it leaves a distinctive taste on the tongue.  \\nThe salsa bar has sliced cucumbers which helps to cool off your tongue from the highly spiced food.  There is a marinated onion, carrots and jalapenos salad that is very unique.  There is also chopped cilantro and onions as well as four sauces which are for the hard core pepper heads since the meat has already been spiced up.\\nBeer would be a perfect compliment to this food, but unfortunately they don't have a license.\\nThis style of Mexican is a worthwhile addition to the endless parade of \\"Americanized\\" taco shops."},{"name":"Sonny's BBQ","address":"7055 S.

The all you can eat sweet and smoky ribs was a good deal, only $2 more than the regular plater.
