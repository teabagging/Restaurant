Definitely the best calzone I've had in a long time. While she wouldn't let me take a picture of it, let me tell you that their small would be a large at other places. Loaded with toppings and cooked to perfection, we will definitely get more calzones in the future. Along with gastric bypass surgery.\\n\\nMy suggestion would be to reduce the size of the menu in order to focus on quality.

After writing a review for that location, the owner wrote back informing me that I should check out the Atlanta location because he noticed on my profile that I was from there.\\n\\nWell, Spring Inman Park restaurant week 2015 came around and we were looking for a place to take my mother for her birthday. Barcelona was the winner. Their restaurant week menu was 4 tapas for $25. \\n\\nMEAT AND CHEESE ($6.50 each)\\n- Speck. This was probably the most flavorful and memorable cured meat bite of my life. \\n- Mahon. A semi-soft cow's milk cheese with a sweet and nutty flavor. Amazing amazing cheese to nibble on. \\n\\nTAPAS ($50 for 8 tapas for restaurant week)\\n- Manchego and Jamon Croquettes: this was absolutely divine and my favorite tapas that we ordered. These small fried balls had melted manchego cheese inside with bits of their jamon serrano inside. I felt like I was having a Harry Met Sally moment from when they were at the deli, if you get the reference.\\n\\n- Chorizo and sweet/sour figs: A lot of people love this one. It was packed with flavor and was a tad bit too sour for me to enjoy more then 2 pieces, but it is a refreshing contrast to a lot of the other dishes.\\n\\n- Calamari: this was disappointing. The pieces aren't calamari rings like you're used to seeing at chain restaurants, but are actual squares of squid that are fried. However, the flavor and texture just didn't do it for me. I would swap this out with something else.\\n\\n- Hanger steak: a bit drier/chewier than I would've liked for steak, and the actual dish is smaller that it appears in photos. Otherwise, you pretty much gotta have it for some substance. \\n\\n- Mushrooms with whipped goat cheese: the heartiness of the mushrooms with the light goat cheese was fantastic. I recommend this is you need a veggie dish.\\n\\n- Lamb a la plancha: great flavor! The lamb didn't taste too gamey, so people who typically don't like lamb could enjoy this dish.\\n\\n- Braised Kale: amazing flavor for kale!! And it was nicely massaged and wilted down so that it isn't as tough as if it was raw. Since we ordered a ton of meat, we thought we needed some superfood and greens, and this was perfect.\\n\\n- Goat cheese stuffed piquillo peppers: we weren't planning on ordering this dish, but the waitress kept raving about it so we decided to replace the meatballs with this instead. The dish itself provided some nice flavor, but it didn't live up to the hype that the waitress had set. It isn't a spicy dish, so if you like the flavor of peppers and goat cheese, it'll be nice, but it wouldn't make the top of my list. \\n\\n- Meatballs: Albondigas meatballs are made of a few different types of meat - I want to say veal, pork and beef, but I could be mistaken. It covered with a zesty tomato sauce. The waitress ended up giving this one to us on the house because of my mom's birthday. It was a really nice gesture! However, I have to say Iberian Pig really set the standard for Albondigas so now nothing else compares, including the one from Barcelona. \\n\\nDRINKS\\nThey have an extensive wine and drinks menu. The great thing about their wine is they'll let you sample different wines until you find one that suits you. I ended up getting their white sangria which was a heavy pineapple flavor and really hit the sweet spot. If you like fruity drinks, I recommend the white sangria. My mom ended up getting one of the wines they brought over to sample, and I wish I remembered what it was because it was one of the best red wines I've tried. \\n\\nPARKING: Valet!\\n\\nOCCASIONS\\nCelebrations such as birthdays, date night, work events, or a non-casual catch up with friends. \\n\\nOverall, it was a fantastic dinner experience and one of my favorite restaurants in Atlanta now.

I've had lots of pad thai and theirs is pretty high up on my list. I always ask for a wedge of lime so I can squeeze it on the PT. makes it just right!\\nThe duck pieces are on the thin side though, back at home (bay area) duck is meatier and better. but this is boston. and for boston, it'll suffice.\\n\\n2) duck noodle soup: i dont know if its actually on the menu, it probably is.. but its something that i had at home when i was a kid and loved it. and they have it here too. the broth has the right taste and the noodles are soft and amazing. Qualm with this is that there aren't that many noodles in there... it seemed more like a snack compared to the portions of other dishes (like Duck PT)\\n\\n3) mango sticky rice: is pretty good. the mangos are always quite raw though... which kinda sucks. \\n\\nMy brother has told me the drunken noodles were really good. i'm not a fan of spicy so i can't say, but i've heard that comment enough times that i recommend it to any of my friends who haven't been to chilli duck before.\\n\\ntheir appetizers are average. nothing to rave about. same with the pineapple fried rice\\n\\ni always get delivery from them because their food is great when you dont have time to cook and you want some asian food. but, going to the restaurant was noticably better for some reason.. maybe b/c the food was made right then or something.\\n\\nservice is great. staff are polite and efficient. one time boy and i were in a hurry and they got our food out really quickly! plus they dont mind if you just order one entree to share for two.

So introducing for the first time ever MySO 90028160 (well because I came up with it today!).  Okay, so I'm a bit of a geek. \\n\\nIn the order of importance:\\nTaste (8.5):  I may have to consider breaking this down into their baked goods and the caf√© items.\\n\\nFor their baked goods I give them a resounding 10 for taste.  I have tired their signature sticky bun and honestly they are to die for.  They have a subtle butterscotch-y taste to it that make them unique tasting.  Also they are fairly large so if you bring your honey with you can share 1 sticky bun and still be very satisfied.  I have also tried their oatmeal cookie (I am somewhat of an oatmeal cookie expert as I like them almost as much as I like ice cream) and I will say that they are unequivocally my favorite oatmeal cookie to date; and for $1.50 it's a 'bah-gen'.\\n\\nI would love to give Flour, the Caf√©, (paragraph above is for Flour, the Bakery) a higher mark but for now, I will re-assess after I've try a few other lunch items, I will say they are a 7.  In all fairness I have only tried their smoked turkey sandwich, which was very good.  However, they were a little heavy on their Vermont Cheddar for my taste; it was more a Vermont Cheddar sandwich with some smoked turkey.  On a very positive note their cranberry chutney was perfect; a perfect amount of tartness mix with just enough sweetness.  This actually surprised me as I prefer (to be read as LOVE) canned cranberry sauce, for no other reason than it's sweeter than the alternative, and scoff at real cranberry sauce when it's served on turkey day.\\n\\nFreshness (10):  It's a bakery/caf√©.  The baked goods are fresh!!!  Their sticky buns are made in 2 batches.  The 4AM batch and their 2PM batch; they run out so try to get there as close to when the batches come out as you can.  If they are out and that's what you were there for take the opportunity to try their other wonderful baked selections. \\n\\nPortions (9):  There is not much to say except that the lunch left me contently full and I usually can eat a ton.  Oh, also, like I said earlier their sticky buns are large enough to share if you're in a sharing mood.\\n\\nVariety (8):  I have only been to 2 other bakeries (Clear Flour in Allston and Great Harvest in Beverly) and Flour's baked goods selection may have been a little thinner than the others but... did I mention the sticky buns; they are to die for.   In all seriousness their selection for both their baked goods and lunch/dinner is wide enough for even those that like mixing it up.\\n\\nCleanliness (10):  I wish my kitchen and dining area was as clean as their's; and I don't even have any people coming in and out of my house.\\n\\nCost (7): Almost $8 dollars for a sandwich seems a bit steep for the budget conscious.  With a beverage and dessert my meal ran about $13.  It's definitely reasonably priced but, at least for me, it's not some place I would be able to go on a daily basis.\\n\\n\\"People watch-ability\\" (8):  From the looks of it the professionals, the outdoor-sey, the artsy, and even the tourist frequent this place.  It's not like sitting at an outdoor caf√© on Newbury St. watching people walk by but if you enjoy seeing an assortment people, and catching snippets of interesting conversations I think you'll be pleasantly surprised.\\n\\nIntangibles (9):  I am not a gung-ho, evangelist when it come to the \\"Green\\" movement but I try to do my part; and so does Flour Bakery and Caf√©.  I believe they are even a \\"Certified Green Restaurant\\"!\\n\\n\\nOkay, this review was a bit long winded.

We got seated right away.  Our first server came To the table and took my drink order- and never came back. I'm sort of glad he didn't bc we ended up with one of the lead server, Steven, and he is awesome! He was very knowledgeable  of the entire menu and even of the owner, Rocco. He spoke very highly of Rocco and we were quite impressed in how charitable Rocco is with the community. The food is amazing. We ordered the guacamole app and one of the guys come out and freshly make the app table side. I ordered the baja combination. I believe it has fish taco, rock shrimp taco and 4 tiny pieces of spinach quesadillas. My friend ordered the spicy beef nacho apps- which I highly recommend that to be shared between 4 people- It is ginormous!! Our drinks were delish!! The sour mix there is freshly squeezed by the bartenders. Theres a huge difference in taste with the home made sour mix Versus the ones that comes in the bottle. I go for the home made sour mix. :) all in all we had an awesome time and will def be back!!"},{"name":"Pure Taqueria","address":"300 N Highland Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3","text":"I used to be a huge fan of this restaurant.

I'm always amazed at how many people cram into this place and speak way too highly of it.\\n\\nThe pizza is with an obvious Napoli influence (as you can see by all the Napoli paraphernalia in the restaurant).  They are good pizzas, I don't deny that.  But they are simply not THAT good.  I think Fritti's pizzas are far superior.  And since I've tasted pizza from here for the last 3 years, I can confidently say that the quality of the pizzas have dropped due to the increased business.

Driving up North High the bar is on your right.  South High it's on your left.  The parking lot is North of the building right to the side of the diner (walking into the front door the parking lot is to your left).  The inside is really cool.  Love the big brass chandelier strung with crystals and red beads.\\n\\nFood:  We ordered some chips and cheese queso dip and I have to say the cheese dip was delish.  It had beans and tomatoes diced up small and mixed in.  The epitome of cheesy goodness. My friend ordered the grilled turkey on wheat & said it was really good.  I had the BBQ chicken salad and I have to say it was the best salad I've had in a really long time.  It comes with 2 slices of wheat bread sticks.  The salad had big chunks of chicken, black beans, tomatoes, corn and a crunch topping drizzled in BBQ sauce.  It comes with a very generous side of BBQ ranch dressing that was great.\\n\\nDrinks:  I behaved since it is a work night and only had 1 drink.  Tried the Surly Colada for $6.  While the drink was good, not sure if it warrants the $6 price tag (the glass is on the smaller side).  But good none the less\\n\\nService:  The service was fine.

Our most recent visit was on a Wednesday night. The ambiance has this upscale-trendy-cool feel, but the seating is a bit congested, maybe 12-15\\" of space between adjacent tables. It was loud enough that I couldn't hear the waitress very well and fairly busy, but not completely full.\\n\\nWe ordered wine and beer, and then a dozen oysters on the shell. They have a good wine list for sushi with many good by the glass options to pair with sushi. While we waited, they brought out complementary edamame which was awesome. If you go, I suggest that you do not get the shelled oysters. We waited 15-20 minutes to get them, they were quality, but were not served with any sauces so we ate them from the shell directly. Maybe that's the purist approach, but was a bit of a let down for us as a $36 appetizer. I wish those details were shared with us or they had cocktail sauce options.\\n\\nThe sushi rolls came out looking nice, but were just too small and were salty. They do have excellent ginger--which is a must! I think my main gripe with the rolls was the quantity of fish. Non-Nagiri Sushi should be a beautiful medley of quality ingredients and enough fish to taste. I cannot recall which rolls. Unfortunately, most of what we tasted are the fillings. I would have ordered more food because we were still hungry (3 special rolls, 12 oysters). For dessert, I ordered a coconut panna cotta which was delicious and sported a nice mandarin glaze, but again, inadequately small (3 bites) for $8. \\n\\nYou don't go to Bamboo assuming you will get good bang for your buck, but you should expect quality food and a nice dining experience. I felt congested, dissatisfied with long waits, and disappointed in the food quality. Our waitress was very friendly but probably spread way too thin. As soon as we got up, we actually walked down a few blocks to eat some more food and dessert, despite spending $120 for two at Bamboo, bummer.

Yes, I swoon over big name chefs. :)\\n\\nAnyway, we arrive promptly around 6:25 pm (pay attention to the time in this Yelp review). The hostess took our jackets and showed us to our table. We sat down and was ready for an amazing feast. Without a doubt, we knew we had to try the ultimate Craigie on Main tasting menu, which was an eight course meal. \\n\\nEach course was great and distinct in its flavor profile. We enjoyed a variety of fish, pasta, sweetbread, venison, duck, etc.. Oh, it was a freakin' EPIC eight course meal. We started out light and small. So, we were stoked.. thinking alright, we can do this tasting menu of small bites. However, by course 4, the flavors and portions started picking up, crescendoed to full blast with sweetbread followed by venison and duck sausage (this latter dish was presented to us by the one and only Tony Maws). Anyway, by course 6, I was pretty much done, feeling overwhelmed and extremely full. The portions were quite generous, so you definitely get your money's worth. However, I stuck it out and experience the end of the meal with a beautifully decorated dessert dish... ginger cheesecake and chocolate mousse cake or some sort and followed by hot warm cider and home-made marshmallow. \\n\\nFinally, our waitress presented our bill which was accompanied by two delicious mini macarons. The damage was pretty bad.. around $150 per person, but hey, we stayed and ate at the restaurant for exactly 4 hours. Yes, we didn't leave until 10:30 pm, so I'd say we got our money's worth. \\n\\nWhile the food was delicious and epic, my only concern for this place was the layout of the place... I normally like open kitchen restaurants, b/c I like to see the action of the kitchen. However, Craigie on Main's kitchen kind of took over part of the dining room and as a result, the kitchen noise of chopping, timer beeping, chefs communicating, etc.. blended over to the dining area.. so, it was rather loud, hard to engage in conversation and hear the music of the restaurant. Anyway, it was just slightly annoying.. :( \\n\\nAnyway, Craigie on Main... I will be back, but will probably stick with the three course meal and call it a night.

I ordered the breaded steak platter with beans and yucca frita. The server came to the table with grilled chicken breast/onions and plaintains, this was not my meal and I politely informed the server who then told me that I DID indeed order steak and onions even though what happpened to be in front of me was chicken. He then proceeded to argue with me that I ordered the chicken. I specifically go to this restaurant because I am (or was) a big fan of the breaded steak.

I know salmon, as my hubby is a commercial fisherman, and theirs was fresh and perfectly cooked. My buddy had the brown rice pasta and was happy as a clam at high tide with that.

It is still pretty good for folks on a budget though.\\n\\nLet's start with the good. They have one of the best bean and cheese burritos around. I know that is kind of an interesting thing to be stoked on, but sometimes you're just craving a bean and chee. This place does it perfect. They also have delicious, fresh taquitos that come with guac. Highly recommend both items.\\n\\nThe only reason I am deducting a star, is because their tacos, specifically their meat, truly has no flavor. I'm not sure if this is on purpose or not, because they do have quite a few delicious things. My suggestion if you do get a meat item, is to make sure you get plenty of hot sauce & salsa of all varieties to flavor it up a bit. You do get your money's worth on the portions and they do have a drive thru.\\n\\nI do recommend going here, but the items you least expect, are some of the most delicious. For example, the wildcard: chilli cheese fries. Bomb, & at a Mexican restaurant. But their tacos, just ok. Strange, but there are good things to be had. Check out their pictures before you order and definitely get the bean and chee, even if you just save it for later."},{"name":"J.

Everything we had was super delicious.  I don't know if it's too helpful describing what we ate since their menu changes all the time based on what's in season.  However I will say that they sure know how to cook and appreciate pork.  Also, the 6 course tasting menu was a perfect choice for us since it was our first time there.  It was a good mix of dishes on their menu and those made special by the chef.

We had the option for 3 different cuts of brisket and we opted for the tender, juicy, and the smoky, \\"crusty\\" part of the brisket that as our waitress put it, \\"it for the more experienced brisket eater\\". Bring it on. Turns out, those cuts were by far the tastiest.  Each bite made you close your eyes and utter weird moaning sounds.  You really can't help it.  The ribs were also way better than average, the sausage was good, but the brisket was the standout.  Two plates later we finally called it quits but for $20/person it was well worth its price.\\n\\nThe Sal Lick is also a BYO liquor place so we washed our BBQ down with the beer of our choice (DOS XX and Imperial).  Nothing like eating amazing BBQ and reaching into the cooler as soon as you need a cold one!\\n\\nThe final touch of this meal was that they carried Blue Bell ice cream- which we were told by locals was the BEST vanilla you can get (and you can't get it many places outsides of Texas).

As we were thinking of a place to have dinner, my friend suggested Antico, to which I quickly agreed.  We arrived at the restaurant around 9 pm on a Monday night and were excited to find a parking spot open up just as we were pulling into the lot.\\n\\nSince my friend and I hadn't looked at the menu ahead of time as I usually like to do, we stared at the menu and were baffled because the some of the names of the pizza toppings are written in Italian.  Fortunately, the cashier was super friendly and patient and she described some of their popular pizzas' toppings.  She told us that the San Gennaro was their most popular pizza, but we thought the Vesuvio (spicy sopressata & prosciutto cotto, pepperonata) also sounded really good.  After some deliberation, we agreed to try the San Gennaro for our first visit to Antico.\\n\\nThe place was as busy as we had anticipated, but we were super lucky to get a table to ourselves in the room directly in front of the cashier.  Less than 10 minutes after we ordered, a server brought our pizza straight over to us, and we confirmed that it was ours by the order number.  This was wonderful because we were starving!\\n\\n* San Gennaro ($21) - Antico's most popular pizza's toppings are salsiccia (sausage), sweet red pepper, bufala (mozzarella cheese), and cipolline (caramelized onions). The pizza was served perfectly baked with a slightly burnt crust, which is to be expected.  Although I prefer pan pizza (yeah, thanks to Pizza Hut) and deep-dish (Chicago style!) over the traditional Italian crust, I thought the pizza was very good.  I enjoyed the sausages, but I wished there were more of them because there were maybe 1 or 2 pieces on most slices and none on a few of them.  I also ate the onions (*GASP*) since they were caramelized (not raw, which I hate), but my favorite topping was surprisingly the sweet red peppers!  These were the sweetest, freshest, most delicious red peppers I have ever tasted!  I continued raving about the sweet red peppers as I ate two large slices.  Then, I was stuffed and satisfied.  In my opinion, one pizza is more than enough for two people.\\n\\nAlthough I had read a lot of the reviews for Antico Pizza on Yelp, I had completely forgotten about the BYOB factor.  Darn!  It would've been nice to bring a bottle of red wine to compliment the delicious pizza.\\n\\nOverall, Antico Pizza gets 4 stars for their friendly employees, quick service, and very good Italian style pizza.  Although it is on the pricey side for pizza at $18 to $21 per pizza, I think it's well worth it.  I will definitely return to try some of their other pizzas, such as the Vesuvio, and will be sure to bring my own beverages next time!  =)\\n\\n[Review 104 of 366]"},{"name":"Trident Booksellers & Caf√©","address":"338 Newbury St","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"So so cute!!

Favoring hot lunches, I usually opt for a Panini...my most favorite being the Smokehouse Turkey. The issue I have is the Paninis (what IS the proper plural of that word anyway?!) tends to be somewhat bland and under-seasoned. I don't get a hint of \\"smoke\\" anywhere in the Turkey version. \\n\\nOne recent find is the Steakhouse Chili. Not the best I've had, but good for a chain, with a decent heat and an adequate amount of meat. Not sure about the cornbread crumbles floating aimlessly in the chili like trespassers in your parent's backyard pool. IMHO, a chunk of cornbread on the side would be better. \\n\\nThe establishment itself seems to have a median dining age of 50, so don't expect a hip crowd sitting near you.

If anyone in Orlando Metropolitan Area can top their sushi and dishes I would like to know.  This place can definitely compete in Japan.  First of all, I love the fact that restaurant chef offered sushi with adequate shoyu so that the true taste of sushi comes out.  I've been to so many restaurants where customers dunk their sushi into shoyu sauce completely destroying the true taste of sushi.  They don't have shoyu on the counter.  I loved all what they offered but one dish topped all.  That was ankimo my wife ordered and I almost ate close to half as it was so good.  This is monkfish liver,which comes closest to foie gras.  It was so good our son ordered it after tasting his mother's dish.  This is a great place but unfortunately the place is booked for dinner until the middle of March.  Lunch starts at 12 but no reservation and they have only 8 counter seats but well worth the wait.  Their tea is authentic unlike many Japanese restaurant tea which has no taste.  They give you kyusu to pour.  If one complaint I were to make then shari(sushi rice) needs to improve.  Not quite up to good sushi restaurants in Japan.  But, over all I am delighted we found this place.  They are run by Asian American and not Japanese but still so good.

ISABEL was sweet in bringing by a taste of the other 2 beers that I had inquired about, the Kokane and Sleeman's Honey Brown and both were quite enjoyable.  (I actually liked both of those beers a little better, especially the Honey Brown, basically because I'm a dark beer drinker) I think that they should give the customers a little more wiggle room with the choice of beer that goes with the burger the same way they give you a choice of chicken or beef, just because people's taste buds vary.  I know it's a \\"Special\\", but I'm just sayin' (I don't think the price point is THAT different)  We really like this place as it isn't pretentious and the food is consistently GOOD.

And if it wasn't for groupon, I would have discovered this little jewel of a restaurant that could easily be over looked since its tucked away in a shopping strip. We dined on a Sunday night and were immediately seated in a cozy booth. There weren't many customers, so it was a quieter atmosphere. Even when more people did arrive, the noise volume remained at a pleasant level because of the good sound insulation from carpet, half walls around the seats, etc. There was TV to watch and low music being played to add to the environment. We were provided with two dining options by our waiter, to either order off of the menu or dine from the buffet. We both chose the buffet so we could sample many things and not feel badly if we didn't like it and were stuck with an entire plate. I'm not sure if the buffet is a part of their daily menu or if it's only on the weekends, so you might want to check before going. Yes, I am aware of the sanitation concerns of buffets and I usually avoid them, but sometimes you just need to suck it up and bite the bullet and say a prayer that you don't get sick. Glad to say we survived and didn't get sick from our experience. \\nThere was a large assortment of stews, rices, and meat to try. Of course I don't remember the names of anything, but remember thinking that everything was very tart. The Persian food that I dined on kind of reminded me of blending Mediterranean and Indian food together. Nothing had curry in it nor was it as rich as Greek food; however, visually and texturally there were lots of similarities. Persian food had a more vinegar based type of flavor which lend to the tart flavor profile that I mentioned earlier. They had a flat crispy seedy bread that I loved which was their version of nan. There desert was similar to rice with rose water and cinnamon pudding like arroz con leche found traditionally in Mexican food and was pretty good.

While the hostess confirmed they're were no available tables for until 10PM, she did tell us there was a separate queue for bar seating and we could check in there to see what the wait was like.  We moved over to the bar area and were cheerily greeted by a served who showed us the drink menus and advised there was only one person ahead of us if we would like to put our name on the list (which we did).  The layout of the place is great - totally open concept and very roomy in both the dining and bar areas.  You could stand comfortably and have a drink without hovering over those eating at the bar.  The vertical columns in the bar area had small shelves attached to rest your beverage while you chatted.  Great drink selection including an abundance of craft beer.\\n\\nWe were seated in about 20 minutes (they have a very efficient process) and greeted warmly by a bartender.  Explained we were first timers to which he replied \\"great - let me tell you about our menu and how it works\\".  He also noticed Kat had not really had much of the beer we ordered while waiting as opposed to my nearly empty porter.  He asked is she liked it and when she politely replied that it wasn't her favorite, he took it, said let's pretend that never happened and get you something you like.  A few quick tastings and we were there.  \\n\\nSo enough said about the service is was A+++ at every turn.  \\n\\nOn to the food - absolutely fantastic!   We started we a few things from the raw bar menu - 6 shrimp, plus the smoked pastrami salmon and a smoked scallop.  The pastrami salmon was incredible - razor thin salmon pieces with pastrami crusting.  The smoked scallop was also cut into thin slices and was just delicious.  Figured the shrimp had to be good at a place like this and was not disappointed.    \\n\\nFor mains at the recommendation of our bartender (for first timers) we both got the lobster roll (the cold one).  A rarity for us to order the same thing, but we were warned we would not want to share it and the warning was appropriate.  Easily a top 3 lobster roll all time for me.  Fresh and delicious.  Also ordered the jalape√±o calamari as a side which was delicious - fresh, not greasy with fried jalape√±o pieces in lieu of the traditional cherry peppers.    \\n\\nWe left full, happy and in great overall spirits after a truly enjoyable experience.

I'm personally not a huge fan of the cheese & bacon topping (I know, you're probably not going to read any more of my reviews now that I admitted that!) but it was still absolutely delish.

Now, the sandwich wasn't anything to rave about unfortunately, but I give the restaurant mad props for putting this on their menu. I've always wanted to try it! It's basically a cross between calamari and chicken. The major downside of this sandwich was the fact that it was completely and utterly fried, not \\"lightly fried\\" as it announces on their menu, and so, you know, when you have fried food, it kind of takes away from the meat inside. But you definitely still tasted that unique alligator texture.\\n\\nCreate your own dog masterpiece... well, my boyfried ordered a \\"normal\\" one on the menu, which was the BELGIAN, (garlic mayo and fries) and then went the \\"not-so-normal-route\\" combining pickles and peanut butter. UMMM WHO DOES THAT? But the bigger question was, WHY DOES IT TASTE SO GOOD? Yeah, I said it. It was GOOD. And we are neither pregnant nor psychopaths (eh, debatable on the latter). There was more peanutbutter to pickle ratio, so I came up with the brilliant idea of throwing relish on it. So if you want to be extra cheap, you could just order peanut butter and save the dollar and slather relish instead. \\n\\nI uploaded photos of all of it, in case you're curious :) \\n\\nService: A tad on the slow side. \\n\\n*** I am naturally a loud person, so the music level didn't bug me...

Feel free to ask for more vegetables and bread because they initially give you about 4 slices, but there's simply too many combinations and possibilities for you just to enjoy 4. Mix it up, have some fun with it. \\n\\nNow, the pizza. Salty Pig's pizza did not disappoint either. There's something about having a cooked egg on top of my pizza, it just makes me so happy. I ordered the Funghi Pizza ($15) and we wanted some additional veggies so added Arugula to it. It was creamy, rich and delicious and had Crema Di Prosciutto on it too. \\n\\nThe Salty Pig Board and the Pizza was more than enough food for two people and it didn't break the bank either. It was a great meal for two people to be utterly stuffed to the point of no return.

I would highly recommend ordering one of every antipasti ( they are only $2 each and I believe there were 15 of them) because it gives you the feel of everything. They are small, but hey that's what you expect of antipasti so order them all. The cabbage and meat board were also tasty.The wine was a yummy Chianti that the server recommended.

My boyfriend and I showed up on Sunday for an early Valentines Day dinner. We must have beat the rush - because we were seated almost immediately. Our team of 2 servers were friendly, funny, and really knowledgeable about the menu. \\n\\nWe got 2 tapas to start. The hangar steak and truffle oil was delicious and so tender I could cut it with my fork. The caldo verde was even better - perfectly seasoned! One of the few mistakes by the restaurant: I figured the tapas were meant to share, but the caldo verde only came with 1 spoon, so we had to alternate bites.\\n\\nFor the 'main' course we decided to get the Sunday special, the pig roast. The roast came with a salad as a starter. This was probably the weakest part of the meal. The hearts of romaine were way too pig for the plate and were adorned with only a few tomato wedges and way too many olives. The plates were so small that even just trying to cut the romaine led to half the salad falling off the plate. But - really this salad was the only thing that missed the mark.\\n\\nBefore the roast came out, our server came to show us a picture of the whole pig we'd be eating that day. The Roast was very tasty - with crispy pig skin covering the juicy meat part of the roast. It was a little fatty - but it definitely gave the meat a LOT of flavor. As sides, the pig came with a spinach/cheese mixture and sweet potato fries.\\n\\nFinally, to top off the meal - some of the best flan I've ever tasted.\\n\\nOverall a fantastic meal - with only the missing spoon and salad being less than perfect.

The hostess was surprisingly nice and patient, and directed us to the bar to wait while our table became ready, but the bar area was also totally packed so we decided to wait outside (we were given a buzzer thingie).\\n\\nThe medium-sized interior of the place is really cozy and homey with brick walls and a tight (cramped) table setup. For the most part, it was nice and warm, except if you're sitting right next to the windows in which case it can get a bit chilly so bring a sweater (on the plus side, they have thick curtains right inside the door to help keep the door draft under control). Sound bounces, making the noise level extremely high when crowded, so I wouldn't recommend this as a date place on a weekend (especially when you're sitting near a large table of drunken fools singing at the top of their lungs during dinner... seriously?).\\n\\nOur waitress was older with a thick Italian/NY accent, and wasn't overly friendly but was efficient and attentive (the water person was also very attentive, which was much appreciated). We got a pitcher of the sangria ($35) to share between 3 of us, and it literally came in a pitcher (like of the beer or water variety) which was kind of awesome. It was really good too, with strong hints of cinnamon and full of juicy flavor, although it didn't have any actual pieces of fruit. I'd definitely get this again.\\n\\nThe starter bread was warm and came with a bean dip that wasn't bad. For my meal, I got the Gnocchi alla Patate, which was a bubbling dish straight from the oven full of homemade gnocchi covered in red sauce, basil, and fresh moz. This is a perfect dish for a cold day, warming and oozing and comforting, just the thing to chase those winter blues away. The gnocchi tasted more potatoe-y than any other gnocchi I've ever had (not a bad thing, just interesting), and the sauce/basil/cheese were tasty, so I was pretty happy with my meal. I even had enough to save for lunch the next day (leftovers were still tasty). My dining companions all had oven-roasted pasta dishes as well and they were all pleased with their selections.\\n\\nThe best part of the meal was the prices... my gnocchi was $16.50, and for the quality and portion size, I thought this was an excellent value (same for most of their menu it seems). I think Antico Forno is a solid choice for the area that's not too expensive but is good quality, and I wouldn't hesitate to return."},{"name":"Stephy's Kitchen","address":"41 Beckford St","city":"Beverly","stars":"4","text":"Good prices, good food that they cook up quickly, but one of the waitresses is miserable.

The visit started off very pleasant with some excellent moscato sangria's.\\n\\n**Note: Braintree location cannot serve the pitchers displayed in their menu therefore had to buy multiple glasses = $$$ (not their fault, just a tip)\\n\\nAs for the food, I will admit that the rolls were warm and delicious which I will certainly like to give credit to our waitress for. However, it went quickly downhill from there. For an appetizer, we decided to get the bruschetta which was good but nothing special. I don't really like how it's served with the bread around a mound of tomatoes as it's more difficult to eat but that's merely a personal preference. My real issue here was with the dinner meals...\\n\\nMy sisters choice: Spaghetti and meatballs + garlic knots on the side\\n\\nReview - The sauce was very bland and the meatballs were burnt and tasted absolutely terrible. I tried a bite myself thinking they couldn't be that bad and immediately spit it out. How do you mess up a classic that bad! As for the \\"garlic knots\\" don't waste your money! They are just the dinner rolls chopped up with some dry garlic powder and basil sprinkled on top. \\n\\nMy meal choice: Chicken and broccoli rigatoni w/ a lemon garlic sauce\\n\\nReview - Where's the chicken? Yep, they forgot to add in the chicken which my waitress kindly brought out on a separate plate for me to mix in myself.

I'd heard of the legendary Salt Lick for years now, and so when I ventured into this ranch-like restaurant outside of Austin, I was ready to get me some real Texas bbq.  \\n\\nComing with a fairly large party, we were seated right away at a large table in the back without any wait.  Although it was my first time, others in my group who frequent the spot remarked that it was the first time they didn't have to wait for a table.  The trick?  Come at 4 p.m. on a Sunday.  The restaurant was busy, but it wasn't insane.\\n\\nI ordered a combo plate, and I selected both the beef ribs and the brisket.  My friends kept telling me how Salt Lick is famous for the brisket, and I personally wanted some ribs.  The plate comes with some other sides, like potato salad, coleslaw and beans.  I thought the last two were average, but the potato salad was unlike anything I'd had before.  It wasn't too creamy, actually a little bit yellow, and was more like mashed potatoes in my opinion.  \\n\\nAs for the meats themselves, the first piece of brisket was perfect.  A little fatty, the meat was tender and basically fell apart on the plate even before I put it in my mouth.  But the second piece was a 180 from that.  It was dry, and I had to cut down with my knife before I chomped it in my mouth.  I only wish I had the first piece second.  As for the ribs, they were phenomenal.  I highly recommend you get them here.  The meat falls off the bone in such a sexy way it should almost be outlawed.  I didn't know ribs could be so good!\\n\\nI also ordered peach cobbler for dessert.  This, like the second piece of brisket, was disappointing.  I don't even think they used fresh peaches, which is unfortunate because peaches are in season in the summer.  It just tasted like a glop of sweet, canned peaches with some shell.\\n\\nService:  Our waitress was friendly, although the restaurant started getting super busy when we left so we didn't see her much during the last part of our meal.\\n\\nSide note - it can get kind of loud in here so don't really expect to carry a conversation unless the person is sitting next to you.  Even across the table can be difficult for soft-spoken folks.\\n\\nBottom line:  I'd come back for the ribs for sure, but nothing else seemed as special as all the hype made it sound.

The television situation is out of control. From our vantage point in the dining room, we could see 6 televisions playing various movies (one with a bit of nudity, which was kind of hilarious) and the crrazzzy jumble of televisions behind the bar showing various sporting events. Totally distracting and takes away from a nice dining experience, in my opinion. \\n\\nThe clientele: my table ranged in age from 30-40 and we were by far the youngest table in the place by at least 25 years. Our reservation was on the earlier side, so maybe that's why? Weird.\\n\\nThe service: Our waiter was, on the whole, condescending. As if we were kids crashing the grown-ups party. When asked what beers they had on tap, his response was an annoyed  \\"none.\\" [awkward silence].  Oh I'm sorry, if this is such a classy establishment, then why are there 38,476 televisions on the walls? It's a valid question. The snippiness continued while we picked our wines, tried to pronounce things in Italian (he made sure to correct us), and asked him to repeat the dessert menu that he rattled off at warp speed, so he started describing to us what a cannoli is like we had never seen one before. (This was when I was seriously about to slap him.) \\n\\nThe food: We shared the burata appetizer for 4, which was a ton for 4 people. It was delicious, better than the burata we recently had at Scampo. As someone who doesn't eat shellfish or veal, I had a tough time with the menu. Thankfully there was a special of braised shortribs with pappardelle pasta. The meat was tasty, though slightly overdone, and the small chunks of lobster in the sauce would have been a nice surprise...for someone who likes lobster (sorry, not me). The pasta was good, but not as outstanding as the price tag would suggest. \\n\\nThe cost: not worth it.

This place is also best known, apparently, for their tater spikes 'n' chicken, which they incongruently were NOT offering in their aforementioned lame duck salad bar, uninspired, and that, too, oughta tell you something.

Please read my full review below.\\n\\nAs with any popular restaurant, you are going to have to wait to get inside. In the case of Totto Ramen, this is a certainty. When I went there this past Wednesday night I had to wait approximately 25-30 minutes to get inside. The Tavern in the Square is right next door to Totto, so we went inside to grab a beer and told the waitress to call us when it was our turn(We waited right next to the window). We drank our beers and used the free WiFi to surf the web while we were waiting. When it was our turn, our waitress, who was very nice BTW, came to find us and called us inside. I've been to the Totto in NYC several times and can confidently say that the ramen was more or less the same. My friend and I both ordered the miso ramen and found them to be very tasty. I would rate them an 8 out of 10.\\n\\nI can't understand why people complain about the wait to a popular restaurant. If you don't want to wait then maybe you should go somewhere else. Furthermore, most ramen restaurants in Japan are very small. You are supposed to eat and go as quickly as possible, so that the people waiting behind you can come in and eat as well. If you want to have a conversation with someone, then don't go to a ramen restaurant. After eating the ramen and drinking most of the soup, I had no ill effects afterwards. The soup is supposed to be salty, therefore, those who have complained about a salty soup being salty should have their heads examined. \\n\\nOverall, I was very pleased! The look and feel of the Allston location was similar to NYC, and the staff was polite and courteous. I did, however, feel that the staff, including most of those behind the bar, were very inexperienced. The reason that it took the Allston location so long to open is because the staff had to be properly trained. Cooking ramen is not as simple as it seems. When I was there, I watched some white dude hack up a bunch of the charsiu as he was cutting it and then throw the uneven pieces into the trash(what a waste of food). However, I'm confident that once they have had more time to get used to working there, that the service and the quality of the food will slowly increase. I did notice that one of the cooks behind the bar was from the NYC location, so I was thankful for that.\\n\\nIn closing, It may take a bit more time for the staff to gain enough experience to do well at Totto Allston, but I think that they will eventually be able to do it. The wait is manageable(thanks to the bar next door and the free WiFi), the staff is courteous, and, most importantly, the ramen is very delicious. Once they have worked all the kinks out I'm sure that Totto Ramen will be one of the best ramen restaurants in Boston. You owe it to yourself to give it a try at least once!!!"},{"name":"Fitzy's Diner","address":"2550 Bethel Rd","city":"Columbus","stars":"3.5","text":"Order breakfast here. Amazing home fries.

I ate too many of the beignets so I didn't finish my waffle but I loved it.  \\n\\nI don't remember our server's name but she was awesome.  She took care of us like a mama bear and we appreciated her service.  I think the prices are pretty decent for what we ordered.\\n\\nParking shouldn't be a problem.

I have been around the world and have tried to eat a burger in every city that I have visited.  I've been on tour doing stand up comedy and subsequently decided to do turn it into \\"The Burger World Tour\\".  I'm trying to find the CREAMIEST BURGER on the F'ING PLANET THO!\\n\\nEnough about me. I was just establishing that I know WHAT IS UP with burgers.  So I heard a legend that Craigie had the most bonkers burger in town, and it was something like $18.\\n\\n\\"If you're going to charge $18 that burger better come with a little sucky suckly love you long time\\" I thought but I was wrong.  It's a burger with potato strings.  \\n\\nOver all, the place is super dope.  It's always crammed to the brim, you can take your chances and try to get a spot at the bar.  If you do though, you probs don't want to be there with more than 2 other people cause it will take a while to find some seats next to each other at the bar.\\n\\nOh and the bar is LEGIT.  The cocktail dudes are super serious about their craft.  They have all sorts of eye droppers with bitters in them that are spritzed with the essence of other shit, it's mental kid.  You'll get banged up there, BUT you'll pay a super high price to do it.\\n\\nNow on to the burger..  I ordered it like any sane person should. Medium rare.  They brought it to me and it was in fact cooked to perfection.  It's crammed deep with bone marrow and other delightful treats that gives it the consistency of smooth butter.  The only problem I had was that the ketchup was made in house, and it didn't have the taste of the ketchup I like.  It kind of killed it for me.  The bun was a sesame seed bun, and again.. it wasn't to my liking.  The fries or.. potato strings or whatever they called it were BOGUS.  I want something with a thick consistency.  They didn't have the feel I was looking for.  All in all, the burger meat was worth it, but the bun and the strings were a total bum out.  Bring your own ketchup packets and order the burger with no ketchup. \\nHmm what else..  uh I had a bite of the short rib which was pretty dank but I've had better.  I had a complimentary taste of the marinated mackerel, and it was ABSOLUTELY AMAZING.\\n\\nThe ambiance is a 10/10\\nThe food is unreal, but I wouldn't spring for the burger if I were you. Even though it's dope you'd need to BYO bun or BYO ketchup or BYO fries.  You should stick with the other choices.  If you want a SIQQ burger go to Five Leaves in Brooklyn or Kumas Corner in Chicago.  \\n\\nOtherwise, save your money.  $18 gets you like 18 whacks at a jack shack in San Francisco.\\n\\nGo here if you're celebrating the loss of your virginity, your birthday, or a new job/success in life.

Soon, we would discover why.  The answer, quite simply, is that nobody would EVER order it at this price.\\n\\nThe food was pretty good, though.  Don't get me wrong.  The meal was more of a \\"tastings\\" menu, made of 7 stages of tiny morsels.  Most of the morsels were pre-made, and not of particularly high quality.  For $200, my wife and I would more likely go to Bachanalia (which we do, on occasion) - although we would likely spend another $100 on wine.\\n\\nThe foie gras/Unagi/fresh bamboo shoot dish was INCREDIBLE, and was by far the best item on the menu.\\n\\nIn the end, however, my wife and I analyzed each of the 7 courses on their own, and came to the conclusion that the total value - based upon our extensive visits to multiple high-end restaurants in Atlanta and around the world - was approximately $60-$65 per person...NOT the $100 per person value claimed by the Nakato LivingSocial deal.\\n\\nThe real problem, though, was that Nakato added another 18% gratuity - based upon their arbitrary and phony \\"$200 value.  So, in the end, we ended up paying about $150 (with tax and valet) for a $140 value...NOT a promotional value as represented.\\n\\nI might return to Nakato, because their sushi - while unusually expensive - is very good and fresh.  My real problem with this \\"deal\\" is the dishonesty of it all.  We have found that many LivingSocial promotions values are grossly misrepresented.  Nakato was no different.

The sausage is probably my least favorite.  The sides, particularly the potato salad and cole slaw, are pretty good to offset the massive quantities of meat.\\n\\nCobbler - We all made room for the peach and blackberry cobbler.

Straight from the first glance, the chicken appeared over fried. With the first bite, however, I was surprised to find the meat still moist and tender. Unfortunately, I found myself craving the colonel's 11 herbs and spices. The mac 'n cheese looked much better than it tasted, and could certainly benefit from more cheese. The greens were actually tastier, and to Estelle's credit were quite superb. The overall saving grace for this plate, though, was the sausage gravy, which when smothered over the chicken, made a luscious mouthful of just enough naughtiness to still be able to stay on Santa's good list. \\n\\nI also sampled the $10.95 Slow Roasted Brisket & House Smoked Provolone Po'Boy.

Just from the looks of this place, it is a regular fast food type, just with wings and not your stereotypical burgers and what not,  which is a relief. They have a good variety of flavors to choose for your wings (I chose to get spicy korean/mango habanero). Looking forward to tasting them. Anyways they have two tvs which is nice and the decor is inviting with the green and brown (I know not super colors,  but not bad either). They have plenty of seating if you wish to come in and dine with the bathrooms located conveniently to the back. The pictures and wall art give it that old school feel (40's, 50's) look which is different and quite interesting. Overall it's a good place to come and grab a choice of wings and something quick fast and easy. Since it is located close to my place of residence,  I will stop in here and get my selection of wings."},{"name":"King Bao","address":"710 N Mills Ave","city":"Orlando","stars":"4.5","text":"My fianc√© and I stopped by here during our trip to Orlando.

While the food was tasty and the service was good, the restaurant manager basically ruined lunch for us and for several other diners. \\n\\nHe was setting up for the big night, inflating helium balloons over by the bar, and apparently inflating them too much-- they kept bursting, unleashing spectacular pops that echoed throughout the restaurant. \\n\\nThe first couple of pops, fine. Stuff happens. Not a particularly relaxing way to enjoy your brioche french toast, but whatever. Then it kept happening, every couple of minutes. There was a family next to us, and their little girl could not eat; she would tremble with fear every time she could hear the helium tank start up, certain that another explosion was coming. We, and the family near us, asked the waitress if the guy could just hold off for little while, or try not to over-inflate the balloons as much. She returned with his curt answer: \\"No.\\" \\n\\nThey offered the poor girl a free dessert, and she declined -- a little kid passed up FREE DESSERT just to leave this place. After another pop, I finally got up to talk to the guy; he made no eye contact and offered no apology.  Just an unbelievable ass. \\n\\nThe french toast was actually quite good, which is why I'll give two stars and not one. But they didn't even serve it with real maple syrup, which is pretty lame for a fancy French restaurant -- in New England, no less. It's not like you have to import the stuff from across the country or anything. \\n\\nAlso, it's in an outdoor mall, with windows that overlook the parking lot, so you're not exactly getting the full Victorian-era romance of a South End experience here."},{"name":"McGrath's Fish House","address":"12501 SE Second Cir","city":"Vancouver","stars":"2.5","text":"The food was gross (over sauced and too sweet), took 30+ minutes to arrive during a fairly calm lunch hour, and was just generally not worth the $50 (after tip) for a lunch for two.

It is located on Cambridge Street at the bottom of Beacon Hill across from Massachusetts General Hospital and 4.8 miles east of Harvard. Harvard Gardens also sits across the street from the Beacon Hill Wyndham, the hotel where we stayed this past week. It is fitting that Harvard Gardens would be the leading meal of our Boston vacation. \\n\\n   Harvard Gardens reminds me of a hybrid pub and modern restaurant. It is a combination bar and restaurant. They serve all the great Americana food that bar restaurants are known for. I'd order the Reuben with fries, a Coke, then a cup of coffee. In hindsight the Reuben and fries were decent and nothing to yelp home about. The Americana meal that I would have later in the night at the Pointe was far better. \\n\\n  I left with the impression that the servers need to step up the service. We would rarely see our waiter. When we waved him to the table to refill our beverages he'd refill my brother's and forget to check on my refill. When we left, it was an effort to pay for the meal. If we were dishonest, it would have been easy to walk out minus paying. When it came to the Yelp check-in offer that discounts 15% off the bill, I was temporarily separated from my phone at the time the  waiter borrowed it to check with his boss on the check-in offer. Fortunately his boss was nearby and nothing happened to my phone in the hands of the waiter. More fortunately they accepted the Yelp check-in offer. \\n\\n   The upshot is that Harvard Gardens served decent food with erratic attention to service.

My check was $12-something, and I handed the server a $20, so I was going to be getting back a five and two ones. I decided that the inattentiveness wasn't THAT bad, so I would be generous and leave the 5. UNTIL, the server returned with the credit card receipt for my dining companion. When she did not give me my change, I asked for it. She apologized for forgetting and pulled the other checks out of her back pocket, in an attempt to make it look like she had meant to bring it to me.

The restaurant is new and very attractive, sound level was good in the dining area with only minimal spillover from a full bar area.  Our waiter came right over, introduced himself, then took drink and apptz orders.  From here, things went downhill.  The soft drinks and apptz came within 15m of order - but the bar order was MIA.  It took some gentle prodding to get the bar order and refills on drinks - even then they ran out of milk (at 6:45p).  \\nThe waiter didn't take our dinner order until he was clearing the apptz plates and then the level of service further declined.  Our waiter disappeared for long stretches, an alternate server  came over about 30m AFTER we placed our dinner order to clarify side options. At that point, the wait staff seemed to think drinks of any kind no longer seemed to be an option.  We finally flagged our waiter, who apologized for the wait and brought over the manager.  He informed us that our order was next in line - which was an issue for us because it was 45m after we had ordered.  The food came out in shifts over the next 15m, so some of our party had food while others waited. \\nWhen we were all served, only two had correct orders and the manager had to return to the kitchen to seek out missing items.

The accompanying sauce of liquified oxtail and peppers were an umami machine that paired so well with white rice.

Everything was soooo good and the food came out so fast. You would think with an hour wait the food would take awhile but it didn't which we appreciated. According to my friend who has a hobby of trying shrimp and grits when she travels these were the best shrimp and grits she ever had. The eggs were extra fluffy and not greasy and the breakfast potatoes were warm, succulent, and delicious. \\n\\nThe staff is extremely friendly and enjoyable.

Real pizza, not an odd imitation. I'm not a pizza snob, but I grew up near Philly and lived in Chicago for 10 years (I also lived in Japan, where they put corn kernels and mayo on pizza). This is Philly/New York pizza. \\n\\nI've tried other places, and one or two local spots are okay, but THIS is real, East Coast style pizza. As someone else mentioned, as soon as you walk in the door, you know the smell is right. The sauce is nearly perfect. And the dough--which I've found no other pizza shop in Columbus gets right--is perfection. Just crunchy enough, with a slightly chewy middle, and crusts that are worth eating (I love good pizza crust, and this is beyond good). And they cut it like a pie, not like a brownie (that would be for Sicilian style only, for you other Columbus pizza shops). \\n\\nEven for the East Coast, this place would be really, really good, but in Columbus, it's a treasure. My wife and I took one bite, looked up at each other, smiled, and said, \\"This is it!

Apizza Scholls, Ken's, Lovely's Fifty Fifty - in my opinion Handsome beats them all.\\n\\nIf you are feeling adventurous, I would definitely suggest trying out the specials (both pizza and salad). If you are not, try the margherita pie. It is simple, with just the right tang and consistency to the sauce and fresh blobs of mozarella with a crust that is chewy, crispy and not crazy heavy on the char.\\n\\nAll in all, this place is not to be missed.

I ended up spending $10 for a taco, chips and queso, and a drink. It wouldn't' have been too bad if the queso wasn't $3 with only a handful of chips and a tiny taco. I literally only counted 15 chips. Moe's pile on the chips free of charge. The second time I got the Burt Reynolds burger and the mojo fries. This will set you back $13 dollars and that doesn't include a drink. While the size of the burger was enormous and juicy, the flavor was lacking. It tasted so bland that I added more condiments when I got home to liven it up a little. On the other hand, the mojo sauce was pretty good with a mild sweet flavor. On my most recent visit I ordered the steak street taco and the voodoo taco (wasn't conned into getting the queso this time) and this was probably my best experience. I enjoyed both tacos, however the price still wasn't justified for me. I think it's fair to say that this restaurant won't be at the top of my list in the near future.\\n\\nOne thing that I like though is that the girls there are very welcoming and friendly and the decor fits the theme very well.

First off, the staff is BEYOND rude! They were down right cold and nasty to everyone (not just people in my work outing group but other customers as well).  They barked directions at us and were cold order takers.  When a young lady asked a question about a pizza on the menu, the girl behind the register said, \\"can't you read the sign?\\" Wow!\\n\\nThat was strike one.\\n\\nIf you are down for paying $42.97 for a pizza and a coke, then by all means be my guest! Each pie averages $20.00 before you add additional toppings like pepperoni, sausage, etc which average $4.00 a topping.  OUCH!  They don't have fountain sodas so you're paying $2.79 for a small aluminum bottle of coke, diet coke, or water.  I asked for a cup so I can get water out of a fountain (greasy pizza should be followed with water!) and she pointed to a sink in the back of the restaurant.  I thought she was joking but the joke was indeed on me.  That was the water fountain.\\n\\nThat was strike two.\\n\\nThe third and final blow was the pizza.  Had I spent $42.00 on pizza and a beverage that BLEW MY MIND, this review would be different.  I'm a food whore, so I'm not above paying a decent price for a good meal! The catch was this pizza wasn't good.  It was mediocre pizza at best.  My coworkers felt the same way.  They were very disappointed they had come out here based on reviews just to have a slice of ordinary (yet expensive) pizza. \\n\\nWhy wasn't it good? Well, the sauce was bland, the crust was burnt, there was barely any cheese, and the pepperoni was EXTRA greasy (in a 'I think I'm going to be sick' kind of way\\").  Speaking of sick. . .

It never fails that they include something for free, whether they think we didn't enjoy something enough (just because we didn't finish it) and take it off the check, or find a Rhubarb-Hibiscus foam in the kitchen for us, there's always something above and beyond.

Bear in mind I'm from a part of Texas where \\"soul food\\" is considered \\"southern food\\" and part of the regular menu in most places...it's not such an oddity, and I've had my fair share.\\n\\nThe Lady and I decided to finally find out what everyone was raving about and scamper off to the mysterious reaches of a \\"bad spot\\" of town. (I saw a \\"pharmaceutical\\" deal occur while waiting outside). So we arrived shortly after 7:30pm. The place was packed...and by that I mean all three tables were full of people, and it was very close to sweltering inside. Everyone seemed defensive that we'd shown up into their \\"bubble\\", as though this Lola's place was a family secret we'd stolen.\\n\\nWe initially decided to wait inside. The chaotic method for ordering was barely discernible from any kind of true system, and felt as though we were annoying the kid who was scribbling down our order. After finding that most of the foods I'd choose outright were unavailable, I chose the pork chop dinner and the Lady chose gumbo.\\n\\nAnd so we waited. And waited. 10 minutes passed. Another, larger group appeared and muscled into the enclosed space. I was starting to feel claustrophobic. Though we'd asked if there was other seating, the guy who took our order lead the new group through the kitchen and out the back door to a pair of warped picnic tables beside the decrepit smoke house. When the kid returned, he asked us if we wanted to go back there, too ...we agreed, wanting to at least sit down, and were lead through the same path through the kitchen.\\n\\nWhat can I say about the kitchen, where so many meals are prepared daily? Well, I could say alot of things. Alot of things that could easily be construed as hateful or downright rude...if they weren't true. The place was filthy, and the uncovered food lay all over the kitchen. Every possible meal of the night was laying in some stage of preparation and left there, waiting, in the heat of the kitchen. Meats and other items that should have been refrigerated sat unattended. But I've been in some bad kitchens before, so I blew it off. But, in short, I saw a slew of possible health code violations in just the time it took to walk the short distance through it.\\n\\nArriving outside we sat in the near darkness, illuminated by a single streetlamp nearby. The other larger group came prepared, with candles and wine...we were not so prepared. We sat and chatted, scanning our surroundings with trepidation. Two random children from around the area cut through our \\"dining\\" area as we waited. It was here I watched as two fine chaps purchased narcotics from the tenement across the street from where I sat. It was also here I witnessed a feral cat scampering in and out of the \\"smoke house\\". Mmmm...yum!\\n\\nAn hour passed. Yes, an hour. At this point we were discussing walking off. Finally the Lady went to the restroom and asked when our order might be ready...shortly thereafter we were shuffled inside, sitting at a table that had just been vacated and was much too large for us. It was alright, though...since most of the dinner party was still standing next to the table, staring at us.\\n\\nOur food arrived at long last at nearly 9:00pm, and I think we were both so hungry we didn't care where we sat. I tucked in, expecting greatness...and was sorely disappointed. As many people have said, the pork chop was obviously a leftover...and a mangled one at that. Barely any meat clung to the bones, even with the surgical care I took to try and pry what there was off. The red beans and rice were bland but relatively good (no real spice), and the cabbage was by far the best item I'd had. Tasty and spicy, it was the only item I ate that I enjoyed a great deal. The cornbread tasted good, but to be honest, I can cook about the same scale myself. The gumbo I sampled was good, but not outstanding...and as the Lady can attest, full of razor-sharp chicken bones.\\n\\nWe bolted down our food and were ready to leave the place as soon as we were able. As we stood waiting to pay, I took in some of the random items that litter the space. One such item, bearing some meaning that is beyond me, was a baby diaper hanging from the ceiling, suspended by mardi gras beads. The diaper was yellowed from the smoke and cooking and truly appeared to have been used. Other random items such as leather-working objects were also visible...such as empty knife sheaths and billfolds with an image of a frothing pitbull punched into them....and while this does not detract from a dining experience, it doesn't exactly win the environment points. \\n\\nI was highly disappointed...feeling like I waited nearly two hours for what amounted to food I could almost cook myself, and fresher, in my own home.

Topped with honey and cracked pepper, the flavors and textures play really nicely together, and the goat cheese (which has the potential to be an overwhelming palate element) is complemented well by the additions.\\n\\nI ordered an arugula salad from the specials menu for an entr√©e and was thoroughly impressed.

The cocktail menu was large and very tasteful. However, the problem is with the waitstaff and delivery of the food. This is a very expensive restaurant and you expect a certain level of service this is where liquid art fails horribly. We had reservations for a party of seven on a Thursday night the place was busy but not super busy. Two hostesses stood there didn't know what to do with us they fiddled around with the menus and then eventually after 10 minutes of standing there brought us to a table. Missing two menus had only one cocktail menu and no wine menu. Then the wait continued. Sat there for over five minutes before anyone came over finally when someone showed up we asked for additional menus. Five more minutes go by still no water but our additional menu show up. Then someone comes over and asked if we want some water. One person at a table wanted sparkling the rest wanted still well that didn't go over well. The person wanting sparkling water didn't get it until halfway through the dinner even though it was asked for three or four times. The head waiter was excellent very professional presented himself well. The assistant servers is where the problem lies. They brought out our entr√©es at all different times with three or four minutes spacing between them. One person waited for the entr√©e for almost five minutes. Two people ordered the skirt steak one medium rear one medium the service mixed up who ordered what... a problem that should not have happened for a quality restaurant.

Part of me wanted to give this place a five, another part of me wanted to give this place a two. Instead, I'm going to settle on a 2 star review. Here's why and here's my take and experience with this place.\\n\\nFood: (which, admittedly, is the most important quality) 5 stars\\nService, Attitude, Crowds, Atmosphere: 1, 2 stars if you're being generous.\\n\\nAntico's is a place that likes to advertise itself as a no frills, authentic Italian pizzeria. And these things are all true enough. This place is so Italian that the entire menu (which is only a handful of selections) is completely in Italian and almost everyone who works there is Italian. The pizza is super authentic, with a fire-oven crispy, slightly charred crust, delicious and full toppings that create very rich, luxurious flavors. I like almost everyone else who reviewed this place, am in love with the pizza. It's the bees knees!\\n\\nBut what brings this place down in my opinion is that it lacks what any really good Italian pizzeria or restaurant provides: A warm, welcoming atmosphere with excellent service.\\n\\nFirst, before even arriving to this place, good luck finding a parking spot. It took us 20 minutes just to find a spot, and even then, I kept thinking someone was going to hit my car the space was so tight. Then, you enter the restaurant and the line is out the door. Okay, crowded parking, crowded place, no big deal....\\n\\nBut then you realize the entryway only has enough room for you to stand and for no one to pass you. So everyone exiting constantly bumps into you on the way out. I seriously wonder how this place passes a fire inspection. Then, after waiting forever in line, you get to the counter to place your order. The menu, being in Italian, can be hard to read. My partner, understandably, asked for clarification on some things. The woman taking the orders was rude, gave us no explanation on the menu, and looked agitated that we bothered to ask her a question. Understandably, my partner was offended by how rude she was. And then we look for a drink, and they hardly have anything to offer, save a few Italian drinks. You can barely even get tap water, because, and here is the kicker, they offer NO SERVICE! They give you these small tables that are crammed into a tiny little space so that you have to bump into everyone! It was awful! They also made no effort to decorate or create an ambience. Nope, just a white room with crowded tables. \\n\\nFinally, our food came and we sat down, ate quickly because we didn't want to be there any longer than we had to, and left. All in all, I would much rather go to a restaurant where I am waited on and treated with respect, where I can relax and have a good time like an Italian place should be.\\n\\nIf all you care about is good food, then GO! But if you want (and expect) much more from your overall dining experience, then do not go, find a nice place, have a good time. For as much money as you spend at the place, you deserve to, in the words of Parks and Rec....TREAT YO' SELF!"},{"name":"Ocean Wave By Harry And Sons","address":"820 N Highland Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"ZIPANG! \\n\\nA group of 7 of us went last Friday and had a blast. \\n\\nIt might have been the multiple bottles of Zipang sake or the anticipation of Metalsome karaoke at 10 High after, but it could have been the darn tasty sushi, too. \\n\\nZipang!"},{"name":"Giacomo's Ristorante - Boston","address":"355 Hanover St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"Giacomo's is delicious.

There was nothing I could eat among their interesting array of Asian-fusion specialty burgers, and the one vegetarian option was the \\"JapaJam\\" item, without the meat but with the egg, which is okay if you do embryo. Incidentally, am I the only person who thinks it's semi-amusing these days that restaurants and trailers seem obligated to offer some vegetarian option, but if a meat-eater politely asks Casa De Luz or Mother's Caf√© to sizzle up some bacon or pork belly they'll just get stared at?\\n\\nSo my new favorite person is Mimi from the Yum√© trailer, because she was a total delight and came up with a doable vegan alternative for me - a huge dollop of Asian slaw over salted fries with a tiny drizzle of Tonkatsu sauce. Crunchy, munchy, and very \\"Yum-O,\\" and it let me hang with my fellow Yelpers without feeling like a complete outcast. Seriously, put this dish between two halves of a decent Ciabatta, and I think you've just created the very first Asian-fusion Vegan Primanti Brothers.

Mimi played around with how much to charge me, and finally came up with $3.75, which I thought was a really good deal.\\n\\nSo if I had a dollar for every food trailer around town, I'd have about - well, I'm not sure what that would be anymore.

All we tasted was the sweet chili jam that came with it. \\n\\n-Tamarind duck (3/5-$19): I heard good things about this dish but it was just alright to me.

I said no, these are made with coconut crepes. They also tasted alright and no coconut taste to it. Though ... I did find it to taste better when I reheated the leftovers the next day. I think it's also related to the temperature issue. \\n\\n-Spring Rolls (3/5-$7): My friend had the spring rolls. I tried a piece and it was too alright. Nothing fantastic. Just your regular spring rolls. \\n\\nDrinks:\\n\\n-Customized drink -Plumb smuggler without the plum wine and in its place the lychee liqueur (5/5):.

From first courses through desserts, it's hard to find a dish that disappoints. If I could afford it, I would dine here at least once a week. There are several dishes inspired from art pieces, and the menu is adjusted based on the seasonal availability of fresh local ingredients.

There's something about chocolate and chicken that I don't quite agree with, but that's just me.\\n\\nWe didn't stick around for dessert.\\n\\nProbably the highlight was the staff.

I asked for a recommendation and they suggested a steak and mushroom pie, baked it for me, all while I sat at the picnic table sipping on the delicious ginger beer.  The pie came out perfect.  Crispy, perfectly flakey crust, and loads of meat with just the right amount of gravy to make it saucy without being soggy.

Both meat selections were very delicately and thinly sliced. The cheese had a creamy consistency to it and tasted wholesome.

Thus, I was a bit surprised by the number of negative comments and an overall rating that was much lower than I would have expected. So let me try to bump that up just a bit and add some positive remarks. First, one should realize this restaurant is New Mexican, not Mexican. Second, I'll agree that chips have sometimes been an issue here -- in the old days, they were not even complimentary. Third, as to the question of fresh vs. a degree of pre-made, I have to say that for me the quality and taste of the food makes that issue irrelevant. We love the offerings that we typically get, the service is excellent, and the ambience is relaxing and welcoming. And, truth to tell, every time we enter, we see either the same people or diners who are obviously regulars. I think it says something about an establishment when a steady clientele populaton is always in evidence. If you want to be a bit snooty about chips or cringe because a microwave might be used, I won't criticize you for it.

So for our 2nd, 3rd, 4th, etc. plates it was brisket, brisket, brisket with a little bit of sausage... you get the point.  Usually, I never put on extra BBQ sauce when the meat is so good but the Salt Lick has this amazing habanero sauce that made the brisket even better.  This sauce has the right kick and is a must.  (I believe they laced this sauce with butter, chocolate, nicotine, cocaine, and everything else that is bad for you but your body craves.)\\n\\nJust a couple of notes:\\n1.  Bring a cooler full of beer or other drinks.  The wait can be long but they have a waiting/holding area where it is BYOB while you wait for your wait buzzer to go off.

I came here with a friend because she likes this place and ordered the pork buns and the house special, the paitan, with the extra spicy sauce and extra bean sprouts. My thoughts on the place:\\n\\nService: I had mixed thoughts about the wait staff. The girl who seated us was really nice but the waitress was not. We got seated immediately and got water and our menus. 2 seconds later, the waitress comes by for our order and we tell her we're not ready. She looks hugely disappointed and upset and was like, 'o...Kay' before wandering away. I mean, the place wasn't even full and there wasn't anyone waiting. Why the big rush?? They also tried to take away my friend's ramen before she was finished. I sort of understand this behavior when the place is hopping but there was literally no wait and several empty tables. \\n\\nFood: very meh. The pork in the pork buns was excellent but it only comes with lettuce. No sauce, no other veggies, just lettuce. A pickled carrot or two wouldn't have hurt the taste. Now the ramen - I think the paitan is probably okay by itself. The noodles are kind of limp and not very chewy and the broth is very thick. However, I made the mistake of ordering it extra spicy, where it comes with a little bowl of spicy sauce on the side. This sauce is the WORST. It was basically 40% chili sauce, 60% pepper. So my entire bowl of ramen tasted like pepper. Has anyone else had this experience?? It wasn't spicy at all.  Just .... peppery.\\n\\nOverall, not a great experience."},{"name":"Fairmount Grille","address":"81 Fairmount Ave","city":"Hyde Park","stars":"3.5","text":"Stood in the front for about 10 minutes and still no one has greeted me.

Richmond is an odd place sometimes, especially during 10 PM and beyond.. a place filled with Asian food, yet most of them don't open after a certain time baffles me.. and we are left we places like this to go to. Well, this wasn't my choice, so might as well suck it up and go eat.\\n\\nWhen coming in here what I notice is.. nothing has really changed.. in terms of decor. Still using the old green that makes up the logo, and at night this place looks extra dark, like a restaurant from the 90's. We were sat along the back, and this place was dark, probably a good way to mask how the food really looks in the light! The menu's came quite quickly and I put in an order for their Monty Mushroom Burger, and also their Chicken Pick'ns.. didn't know what to expect.. but my expectations were not high.\\n\\nJust like everything in life, prices go up.. but in White Spot's case.. I feel like we got gouged.. right between the eyes. I love how the website really doesn't show you the price (unless you really look).. but for $14.. at least.. the burgers White Spot serves better be f'ing amazing. I didn't realize time of day coincides with lack of quality, if this was the case.. maybe you should do a late-night dinner menu and discount the price by a certain percentage so you can accomodate for the lack-luster food you are serving. So when the burger came, it was pretty underwhelming. This thing looked like it was under the heat lamp for a good amount of time. The onion rings I substituted were actually pretty hefty and big, but as a substitution, paying more money, shouldn't I get the same amount of carbs that is leaving my plate... I just felt the 6 onion rings.. some really tiny.. didn't equate. I remember this mushroom burger really bursting at the seams with mushrooms, this one just had a bit on top of the meat, not really befitting of being called anything with a special name.. more like burger with a side of mushrooms on top please.\\n\\nThe Chicken Pick'ns.. now this was really not good. Something on their menu that this was a limited time.. well hurry up and fly away, cause this secret batter was just that.. a good secret that I don't want to know about. When you're thinking that the Colonel maybe having better chicken.. you have a problem. These things looked like fried batter balls, not attractive, and to know that it was just fried chicken for 2 pieces at $14... again.. what the heck is going on here.\\n\\nIf you want food like this in Richmond, especially after 10 PM, you got slim pickings.... maybe that's why it survives, especially at outrageous prices for lackluster quality, the only reason why this doesn't go 1 star is that it is open late at night, and the service wasn't bad.

The best f2o location is the one downtown Atl on Peachtree St. The staff there are all friendly and they aren't skimpy on the toppings for your salad.

Cooked old school medium, not the wuss medium well you actually get from most places when you ask for medium. They don't press the juice out when it's cooked, so the big plump burger has a lot of height when you get it.  Don't be afraid of it, just take care of business and enjoy the beef. Plenty of taste, and worth the wait it takes to cook it right. The steak fries were a little undercooked, or the meal would have gotten the hard to reach 5/5 from me.

I get it, this place isn't going to be a shining star of authenticity, but I expect more than the sad excuse for Irish food they tried to pass off. The banger was a joke, wrong texture, wrong flavor everything was bad. Soda bread was just up the same alley. Pretty much this place just shoved the word \\"Guinness\\" into all its menu options and proclaimed Irishness. Pretty disappointing when I came looking for some comfort food favorites. About 3 menu options were Irish and even those were weird fusiony things. I have to say, what we had wasn't terrible, but if you are going to mess around with traditional favorites, it better blow my figurative socks off. \\n2. The service was meh. Had a reservation and still had to wait about 15 minutes and when we brought our buzzer up, we were ignored for about 5 minutes even with the bright red flashy lights. Our waitress was also just okay. She never refilled our water, never came to offer my husband another beer. She was sweet though and seemed like she was trying to do a good job in a busy restaurant.\\n3. The noise is my last complaint. Obnoxiously loud music played the entire time. Some of it was live, the rest over speakers. It was loud to the point where I asked for the quietest table and still couldn't hear my husband. It was pretty irritating and I am sure the waitress didn't like having to repeat everything she said 37 times either.

I've loved this place for longer than most of Austin's been alive.  Back when there was only one dining room.  But two things have happened - better BBQ has come to Austin, at right about the same time Salt Lick have started believing in its awesome wonderful grooviness - just ask noted BBQ expert Tom Collichio if you have questions.\\n\\nOK, friends in from Wisconsin.  Planned day trip to F'burg, wineries, Blanco, Wimberley, then the Salt Lick for dinner.  First trip since our last out-of-town guests in March, even though it's only ten minutes from our house.  First shock - they have screwed with the menu!  I would always get a four meat plate, with double ribs and brisket.  Now, no soup for you!  OK, I'm sorry your neat cutters can't deal with anything other than templated set plates (what I was told was the reason).  So I get the four meat - brisket, ribs, turkey, and sausage.  Look, I realize you think the AYCE is the solution (again, what I was told).  It isn't.  Don't want the temptation of over eating.\\n\\nSo, on to the food.  Plate arrives.  One pork rib, a single slice of brisket, six or so small pieces of turkey, eight or so slices of sausage. Rib was ok.  Brisket was insipid - inside slice, so no crust, no smoke ring, nothing - might as well been a piece if roast beef.  Turkey was OK, but again hard to get any flavor out of.  Sausage - I have always hated their sausage.  Too fine grained, too much filler - hot dog.  I like their sides - always have, but this is a BBQ place, not a potato salad place.\\n\\nAmbience - it is what it is, or so I thought.  Tonight we sat in a room in the back of the new dining room.  I don't know what it is about that room, but we could hardly hear each other.  Surely, the table full of drunk twenty-somethings had something to do with it, but I know I've seen that there before, and never had that effect.\\n\\nSo, the pecking order - Franklin/JMueller, Stiles Switch/Rudy's (if you order the moist), Iron Works, then Salt Lick.  Yep, the worst. The wonderful atmosphere, the unique experience, can't overcome the awful food.  And it hasn't always been this way.  The media hype, the trip this very weekend to New York City, the Top Chef hoopla, the vineyards - you name it, have all been distractions.

Sometimes they are slow and oblivious to the fact that one has a plane to catch, so be sure to tell your server your schedule.

Servers were very friendly, portions are huge.  Lunch items comes with naan bread, rice, huge portion of whatever you ordered (Chicken Tikka Masala, Korma, etc.), beans, yogurt sauce.  Plenty to eat!  The chicken was delicious- well seasoned, all white meat, good quality.\\n\\nOnly complaint I have is that the servers (while definitely friendly) took a bit longer than I would like to bring the check and clear the table.  Also, when I eat Indian food, I like the spicy stuff and thus drink a lot of water.  My water glass could've been filled a bit more frequently.  Still, I'm nitpicking here.  \\n\\nThe food and friendliness are what's most important to me and both of those were 5 star.  \\n\\nSome little details: The spices/chutneys they brought to the table were fresh and refrigerated (important! often at lesser Indian restaurants these may sit out and get warm.  They really should be kept cold).  Another nice moment- our waiter brought my 5 year old daughter a complimentary mango sherbet after our lunch.  She loved it!\\n\\nGive it a try if you haven't yet.

When our main course arrived both the NY strip and Fillet were good, but I've certainly had better - as far as taste goes.  The strip was cooked perfectly, but wasn't quite as juicy and tender as other prime steaks I've had.  Besides that, it is a gorgeous restaurant, in my opinion one of the nicest in Boston.

We went with the Abbaye de Belloc sheep cheese and it was a great choice.  The Eggplant Sott' Aceto was a great side to the meats, almost like pickled sour eggplant pieces.  The potato gnocchi didn't have any meat but made up for it with a rich sauce and meaty mushrooms, rounded out with brussel sprout leaves.  The only disappointing dish was the entree, the pork tasting.  It was very dry and the choices for the preparations of the pork were very disappointing.

It reminds me of a western North Carolina type of barbeque sauce. \\n\\nNow the not-so-good: The sides are disappointing. The only high points were the fresh bread and the fresh tasting pickles. The coleslaw was decent, but very strong on the celery seed. The potato salad is interesting...a warm salad similar to a German potato salad but not as vinegary...in fact, a bit bland.

We felt like such VIPs!\\n\\nSecond, when I asked if they did anything special for anniversaries, we got a free dessert out of it. Score! Just a nice perk.\\n\\nThird, the food. Amazing. I believe we both go the Filet Mignon, which was a gorgeous, tender, succulent cut of meat. I definitely remember seeing the butter sauce on the plate, saying \\"OOO butter!\\" and lifting up the fork to lift it. Thanks to the fact that they cook the steak on the plate in the oven, I had tine marks on my tongue for about a week. Ouch. The meal was still amazing though.\\n\\nYou do have to order the sides separately - like many high-end steak places - and I think we went for their special Lyonnaise and a veggie. Ok, apparently I don't remember it THAT well.\\n\\nI do remember being thoroughly impressed and saying I would definitely go back. I believe I enjoyed it more than Smith & Wollensky and possibly more than Capital Grille (although, you can't beat CG's mashed potatoes).\\n\\nAll-in-all, a great place for a good, high-end steak meal - whether it's romantic, in a group, with a family.

It was the middle of the day on a weekday! And there were a few tables open up there, so why wouldn't you seat us there??? It is just common sense since if you seat us there we will spend money ha\\n\\nAfter that mini debate downstairs, we were seated in their roof deck area and it is pretty nice, I do have to say. I wish more places had roof decks. And the food here (the bites I stole from Espie B that is) was actually way better than I thought it would be! I'd heard mixed things about this place, but her crab cake sandwich was pretty tasty, and Natalie's fish and chips you could tell were made with fresh fresh fish and they weren't even overly battered and fried either. The fries are just fries, and of course you want to eat them when they are sitting there. But the fish and chips came with this coleslaw that was pretty refreshing. Not sure what they put in it, but that cilantro and that sauce with a hint of sweetness was really nice. On a sunny day though I would have liked more water offered and I wish that some of the food items and cocktails were a little more affordable. Massachusetts really needs a happy hour!!!!! Or at least my wallet does ha\\n\\nOverall this place is a pretty nice place--but beware for men using the unisex bathrooms who don't lock the door!

The restaurant is open, well lit (my wife commented that there appeared to be 100 light fixtures) and airy with high ceilings but the cement floors and some brick walls can make the noise level high, so this is not the place for an intimate dinner, but the vibe is clearly high energy.\\n\\nWe walked in on a Thursday night without a reservation but were seated well within the 25 - 30 minutes the hostess said would be the wait time.\\n\\nWhile waiting for our table we decided to grab a couple of drinks at the bar.  For the size of the place I wish the bar was a bit larger, but not a big deal.  Make no mistake, this is not a Bud Light and Kendell Jackson drink list.  I was familiar with very few of the beer and wine offerings, but the bartender was helpful and more than willing to give us a sample of anything we wanted to try.  \\n\\nOnce seated, our waitress was very knowledgeable on the wine list and was helpful in helping us create a mixture of oysters to sample a range of flavors.  My wife and I each had our personal favorites but the sampler approach was definitely the way to go.  Our fried oysters in lettuce cups (highlighted by both Boston Magazine and Yelpers) was comped after a glitch getting it out as an appetizer.  The oyster was lightly fried so as not to make the it rubbery, and the flavors of the sauce and pickled vegetables balanced the dish nicely.\\n\\nEverything was heading to five star level, but the two entrees we selected fell into the \\"only okay\\" category.  The salmon preparation with brussel sprouts, bacon and horseradish sounded wonderful and while the fish itself was cooked perfectly, it was quite bland.  And in our continuing search for the best crab cakes, Row 34 fell well down the list with too much cake and not enough crab - it was ordinary at best.\\n\\nThere is a limited dessert menu, but we tried the whoopie pie and it was excellent.\\n\\nSo overall we'll definitely go back for the raw bar at Row 34, though we may pass on the entrees."},{"name":"Kal√©","address":"50 SW Pine St, Ste 102","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"One of my favorite spots to go for a quick, healthy lunch downtown.

Their beer list is impressive and extensive.  However, it's kitschy placement on a clipboard makes it quite difficult to read.

Oh, the food is important, too, but the a perfect margarita will allow me to forgive some other sins. \\n\\nUnfortunately, Pure was a mixed bag. I always start with the house margarita. If you do the basics right, everything else should fall into place. Alas, it was a fairly typical margarita on the rocks with salt. My dinner companions both ordered a skinny margarita, which was on special for $6. They were much better, but they are listed on the menu at $10, which is too pricey for what you get. \\n\\nThe food also was provided mixed results. The Tres Ceviches was more celery, onion and pepper than fish, shrimp or octopus, though they all had very good flavor. Add some tomato juice, and you would have had a great gazpacho, but ceviche it was not. The chicken tacos, on the other hand were quite good. The flour tortillas were fresh, the chicken was moist, and the flavor plentiful.\\n\\nThe service, however, was extremely disappointing. It was clear from the moment we sat down, and I saw two servers playing \\"Rock, Scissor, Paper\\" to determine who had to take our table, that our our server wanted to be anywhere other than at work. She was verbally short, lacked enthusiasm and was inattentive. The Tres Ceviches arrived after our entrees and only because we reminded her that we ordered it. We were not asked if we wanted a second round of drinks until after we had finished our meals, though our drinks were running low when the ceviche finally arrived, without apology, by the way. When we mentioned to her that she seemed like she didn't want to be there, she said she was just really tired and, defensively, asked if we wanted to see a manager. We didn't; we just wanted her to know that the poor service had not gone unnoticed. \\n\\nFortunately, we were not charged for the ceviche, and, as we were leaving, we happened to pass by the manager. She asked about our evening, so we told her. She was aware that we were not completely pleased, apologized, and commented about taking the ceviche off the bill. She then asked for feedback that she could use to help improved her server's performance. She truly was sorry and hoped we would give them another chance. \\n\\nSo, based on the tacos, the skinny margarita, and the eclectic space, not to mention that it is walking distance from our temporary housing, we will try Pure again. For now, though, three stars is all that I can offer."},{"name":"WINGS Granville","address":"1162 Granville Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"2.5","text":"This was the worst establishment I've ever been to.

It is quite a small place and alot of the tables were so close that you were sharing tables with other groups but we lucked out and had the best seats in the house (right at the bar but it's only built for two). Since we were a party of two, we were seated ahead of at least four other groups (of 3 and larger). We were able to watch the cooks making all of the wonderful dishes. Also try the Italian beer, Peroni. Never had or even heard about it before today and I have never had a beer like it so it's hard to describe. So back to the food...the lobster ravioli was yummmmmy. It was not fishy tasting at all and the sauce it was in was creamy and delicious. It tasted completely fresh and for 14.95, I call it a bargain. The fusilli was perfectly al dente but my veggies were so finely chopped I could barely find them. Pretty much all of the entrees were pretty reasonably priced.

The burrata  (fresh buffalo mozzarella) was creamy and delicious.  Everyone was a fan of the Rosetta's famous meatballs.  Each meatball was HUGE and could be cut up into 5-6 pieces to share.  It was tender and moist.  The rollantini di nico was also very good.  I was disappointed that we only got one order for a table of 10 but the morsel I had was great!\\n\\nFor dinner, I tried the rib eye and filet bolognese.  The rib eye was perfect but I have to admit I was expecting spaghetti pasta for the bolognese.

Kiddos always enjoy the fish nuggets & chicken nuggets.\\n\\nThey have *many* healthy options on the menu, we just tend to eat the not-so-healthy ones. ;-P Lots of grilled/blackened fish/shrimp & lots of good for you veggies.\\n\\nGive them a try! They always have a chalkboard up front with daily specials.  Only complaints I can think of is that their Freestyle Coke machine tends to run out of flavors frequently & sometimes it seems like the AC isn't working.

Stacked with souvenirs, unframed artwork, kids' toys, and an entire shelf containing a variety of hot sauce, the tiny one-room restaurant features large refrigerators right there in the dining area and a counter space far too cluttered to be of any real use. It looks more like a fairly disorganized house rather than a restaurant. But despite its unkempt appearance, the dining area is clean and the atmosphere bright. A hand-written note on the door begs those who arrive to find it locked to call her number (written there on the note) and then wait for her to return - she's probably out feeding and caring for the homeless families in the area. Another handwritten sign inside spells out, in loopy script, her simple mission statement (\\"we feed 300 families and kids a week from our back door\\") followed by a heartfelt call to action to give as the customer sees fit so she can continue doing so. You are presented with a small and simple menu containing the basics of Cajun home style cuisine: crawfish √©touff√©e, gumbo, fried shrimp, fried fish, etc. Be warned: the day's offerings are often limited to what she has available in her kitchen at the time, so this may not be the best place for particularly picky eaters. It feels much more like going to dinner at someone's home, and it is that familiarity, along with many other factors, which make Queen Nubian Lola's a truly winning and beautiful dining experience. \\n\\nArguably the most important factor, as it would be with any restaurant, is the taste and quality of the food, and I tell you with utter certainty that this area leaves nothing to be desired. Now I had done my homework on Lola and her cafe before going, so I already knew about her commitment to the homeless, her own difficult history, and her pledge to see her husband, who has been incarcerated for 22 years, released back into her life. I was already, to put it simply, impressed. So it stands to reason that my hopes were high, and that could have affected my ability to judge the food objectively. But I assure you that was not the case; the meal I was served was, all on its own, superb.\\n\\nI ordered a shrimp plate. The fried jumbo shrimp tasted fresh and clean, and the batter and seasoning were exquisite. On the side, an order of red beans and rice took my breath away and had me wolfing it down in a way that red beans and rice has never done for me. The cornbread was sweet, crunchy, and hot from the oven (as my boyfriend and I waited for our meal, the smell of the baking cornbread wafted over our table and we both started salivating). But the star of the show (at least the show on my plate) was the green beans. I honestly couldn't even tell you what was in them...they were gone before I had a chance to analyze what I was eating, so rabidly did they demand to be eaten. We made obscene noises. We laughed randomly. We scraped our plates clean. We asked about dessert, but she didn't have any the ingredients she needed that day. We figure this is as good a reason as ever to come bak again soon. \\n\\nLola herself was charming, friendly, and warm. She sat down at the table with us to take our order and was quick to laugh. Her attitude was so casual and familiar, it perpetuated the feeling that we were just having dinner at her house. As a middle-class white girl from white bread Dallas, I have never had real soul food before, but I'll be damned if my soul was not singing when I left Lola's.\\n\\nIn the end, I ended up spending a lot of money, but I haven't regretted it for a single second; after all, two things I'm particularly passionate about are homeless assistance and good food, so this place was clearly built to take my money. But I have every reason to believe that the donation I made will be used exactly the way she says it will. \\n\\nIf you are not picky about things like having full access to the menu, the dining area being free of clutter and well-separated from food storage, and a somewhat shady-looking location (and trust me that none of these are as bad as all that), this is pretty much the perfect restaurant. I will go back over and over and over again."},{"name":"Stats","address":"300 Marietta St NW","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3.5","text":"Why this place only has 3 stars blows my mind.

We were looking forward to trying La Taqueria ever since it opened and we were disappointed.\\n\\nWe arrived to the restaurant around 6:30 PM on a Friday night and it was surprisingly not-that busy.  However, we waited 25 minutes for our appetizer, 1 entree, and drink.  I'd expect that from a sit-down Mexican restaurant where I'm spending that time sipping on a margarita and munching on chips and salsa, but not from a casual corner restaurant serving just as many to-go patrons and eat-in patrons.\\n\\nThe pincho appetizer is essentially a kebab smothered in BBQ sauce.  The BBQ sauce is what saves this dish, because the steak (which was ordered medium and came out well done) and vegetables were underseasoned (if seasoned at all).  We also ordered the carne asada and carnitas tacos, both of which were so bland that we had to douse them in the chipotle salsa (salsa was great, tacos were kind of terrible).  Mexican rice and refried beans came with our taco entree, both of which weren't great.  The rice was fine, but bland and nothing special.  I don't know how they screwed up refried beans, but they were pretty awful.\\n\\nWith that said, the taco al pastor (pork with pineapple salsa) was excellent, so I could see myself coming back to this place just to have that taco.  Likewise, the horchata was also very good (unique flavor, too).  \\n\\nListen-- the owners were nothing but gracious, friendly, welcoming, and happy to have us there.  The employees are working their butts off to serve us beautiful and fresh food.  But we can't eat at a place where they get an A for effort, an A for quality, a C for speed, and a D for taste.  I'd much prefer a small menu with excellently prepared food than a large menu with mediocre food.  Here's to hoping they work improve the taste of their food and the speed with which they serve it, because I'd love to have a great little restaurant right around the corner from where we live.  Until then, I'll just stop by for an al pastor taco and horchata and be on my way.

I love the pizza, my last sample could have used a bit more time in the oven to get some char, but it's the venue that can use some help.  On a recent cold and windy night, the big garage door was left open, and it was so cold inside.  The few customers who chose to eat-in were bundled in hats and coats and it was still uncomfortable.  It seemed to me that if the garage door was closed, the heat and ambiance of the wood fired oven would have created a lovely atmosphere for eating, and a little attention to decor wouldn't hurt.  It appears that the restaurant is trying to be a food cart that happens to have covered seating, but with those few changes could be so much more.  Of course on a warm August evening, now problem with the door.  As it is now, I'll go back for take out, but for an enjoyable pizza and beer will go back to Lovely's.

I can't stop thinking about it. It's not a \\"traditional\\" ramen, but the noodles were the ideal springy texture, the stock was rich and well seasoned, the flavor was spot on and everything sang, down to the perfectly cooked soft boiled egg.

They also made it the perfect degree of doneness, without me having to tell them how I liked it. Some places will ask you how much pink that you want, but this place did it to they way I love it. On top on that, the meat was SO juicy. I don't think I've ever had a more tender hamburger ever.\\n\\nI had mine with blue cheese, which they didn't skimp on.  A lot of places will because blue cheese is kind of an acquired taste and not a lot of people like it; therefore, if they have it, they charge more because of the hassle to even order it and offer it, when not a lot of people will take it.

The direction he takes with each project is really different and incredibly immersive. \\n\\nAt LAH, Dougie's food takes on a Chinese influence. As a Chinese guy from Hawaii myself, I've eaten a lot of modern, \\"pan asian\\" food with a wide range of execution. I've found that modern/pan Asian food basically comes in three categories: \\n1. Cliche idea, poorly executed\\n2. Classic dish, w/ a silly twist\\n3. Mindblowingly good. \\n\\nI tell you this because I usually avoid \\"pan asian\\" places at all costs and/or enter with a bit of skepticism. But in Dougie's case, I was sure I'd be blown away, and in fact yes, Dougie's food is in category 3--mindblowingly good. \\n\\nDishes: \\nPork and Leek dumplings were off the hook. The dumpling was supple but the dough was pleasingly al dente. The filling was full of flavor. \\n\\nLobster dumpling with birds nest. Some other reviewer took this to task and I'd just like to say that person's full of shit. One of the most flavorful dishes I've ever had, and beautiful to boot. \\n\\nLobster with sichuan pepper. The layers of spice here create great dimension. A lot of times, a dish like this will just be \\"spicy\\" - but Dougie's palette won't cheat you. \\n\\nChilled cucumber with sesame sauce. I happen to know that Dougie's favorite vegetable is the cucumber. I believe he eats one or two a day... when you know someone loves something that much, you also know he won't fuck it up. Dougie's passion for cucumber got me into eating them too. \\n\\nSalt & Pepper Prawns. These are big mofos--they belong on \\"Monsters of the Deep\\" or something. Bursting with meat, flavor, and all around goodness. \\n\\nTeriyaki beef. Personally, I'm on a \\"anti-teriyaki\\" crusade, because in Hawaii, everything's covered (drenched) in it.

However, I made an exception for Dougie and his teriyaki beef did not disappoint!!\\n\\nThere were other outstanding dishes, but unfortunately I didn't take notes on everything we ate.

The Sadie is friends with the owners, so I figured that I'd drop in, patronize our friend's new place, and see what it was all about.  I'm glad I did, though writing a review for a place owned by folks you know can be a little daunting.  After all, what if something isn't quite right, or heaven forbid, something is downright bad?  Fortunately, my experience at Kasan Red was an enjoyable one.  \\n\\nKR is located right on the corner of Flat Shoals Ave and Glenwood Dr.  Inside it's a pretty spacious location, though the frontage is pretty narrow.  I went recently, so in addition to the seating inside there is al fresco dining.\\n\\nI was seated and began the meal with a recommended Toohey's New Ale.  It was crisp, hoppy, and clean which was a nice respite from the humid Georgia heat.  \\n\\nFor an appetizer, I tried the crabcakes.  Now to be fair, I lived in Baltimore for about a year and a half and could walk a couple of blocks to Fell's Point and get piping hot crabcakes for breakfast.  Baltimore spoiled me for crabcakes.  Fortunately for KR, their 'cakes are good.  There's a substantial amount of crabmeat in them and the binder was complementary and there was no extraneous filler anywhere to be seen.  The exterior was crispy golden, the interior was moist without being mushy, and the flavor was bold creamy crab with just a hint spices.\\n\\nThe plate is served with three 'cakes about the size of large hushpuppies on a bed of greens with a nice sized mise en place of remoulade.  Those with smaller appetites could turn this into a tasty little salad.  \\n\\nPersonally, I think I would've liked to see two larger 'cakes with more lump crabmeat and perhaps the chef could ratchet up the heat in them with a little more spice, but these are my preferences only.  I would definitely order the dish again.  \\n\\nFor my entre, I decided to be adventurous and take John's (the owner) recommendation on the lamb shank.  I'm glad I did.  The dish is a visually daunting one.  The lamb comes to the table still on the shank, resting upon a bed of petits pois (sweet peas, you heathens!) and bacon (my favorite meat.  Oh Fruit of the Swine, how I love you!), dressed with a red pepper and carrot salad (which is really more of a garnish).\\n\\nI'm a huge fan of braising and the lamb came to the table succulent and tender.  Even though I had a knife I didn't really need it, save maybe to scrape any last little morsel of meat off the bone.  Overall, the lamb was superb.   \\n\\nWhile I was there, the crowd was a small one, but it grew during dinner.  There were just two folks working, but both were always moving and took plenty of time to spend with the tables and make sure the customers had what they needed.  The service is quite good. \\n\\nAll-in-all, my experience at KR was very enjoyable, and I'm glad that I made the trip to East Atlanta to dine there.

Its not too much rice, not too pretty, sometimes a little messy actually but its totally alright , remember i said this was a neighborhood sushi joint. \\n\\nThe cooked food is like eating at your Japanese bff's home that serves gyudon (beef over rice), katsu-don (pork cutlet over rice) , and omu rice (rice omelet with ketchup) except we're at Aki where all the cooked meals are prepared by I would just say non-japanese ppl, but none the less, yummmy. \\n\\nThey also have happy hour, which i hope you're glad to hear. Save the best for last ya know?! Its basically half off certain rolls, most popular ones every one enjoys and $1 nigiri. \\n\\nThis is my fave down home Japanese place and I would definitely recommend it. \\n\\nBTW: next door has a tiny Japanese grocery market, more like a convenience store which some of their items are marked up ridiculously expensive and can be found some where down in Mills, but they do have some unique stuff, if u want to pay for it. \\n\\nALSO CLOSED ON SUNDAYS!"},{"name":"Pambiche","address":"2811 NE Glisan St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"I've never been to Cuba, but I now love the food!

Tango Mango on Moody Street was the first place I found that made a decent crunchy taco, but they ended up closing up shop and the taco search started up again. \\n\\nEnter Moe's...  This place is awesome.  All the food is so fresh and of the highest quality.  Meats (chicken, beef, pork, etc) are all either free range or grass-fed, which means alot to some people and really does translate to better overall quality.  Marinades, sauces, and queso are mostly all made in house and are also very tasty.  Shells, tortillas, and chips are all made on site and are of much higher quality than your basic Ortega brand from the grocery store (which Tango Mango used for their crunchy shells at least). If I had to pick a favorite, it'd have to be the pork.  Delicious.  \\n\\nBeyond the crunchy tacos, Moe's has some great other options including burritos, quesadillas, salads, etc (all with cool, clever names) and a Carvel machine with all kinds of toppings if you're sticking around for some dessert.  All are top notch and reasonably priced.\\n\\nEmployees at Moe's are always very friendly and eager to greet you as you walk through the door.  They all seem to know their jobs well and move quickly and efficiently.  Even when the place is very busy, the lines move quickly and wait times are limited which is not always the case at some of the competitor's shops.  Parking is easy to find either on the street at a meter, in a small shared lot behind the building, or across the street at CVS / Hannaford's.  \\n\\nSome people are loyal to Chipotle, some are loyal to Q'doba, some Taco Bell, and so on.  I have tried them all and Moe's is certainly at the top of the list.  Do yourself a favor and try it!

We ordered Moules Frites Congolaise (mussels), Tajine D'aziz √Ä L'agneau (lamb shank), elk meatballs, and Carpaccio d'Autruche (ostrich carpaccio). For dessert we got the Nuage de Noix de Coco (coconut cloud).\\n\\nAll the food we ordered was great. My favorite was the ostrich carpaccio. This was my first time having ostrich.

I'm not much a of dessert person, but everyone at the table was raving about the coconut cloud. \\n\\nSo the one this that turned me off about this restaurant, was one part of the service. Most of us at the table ordered beer, since they have such a great selection and Belgian bottled beers. When one of the servers brought out the beers, he began to pour it with the glass sitting on the table. By the end of the pour, there was about an inch of beer and the rest of the glass was filled with head (foam). Then he proceeded to explain to us this is how you pour these types of beers and that he just went through a training class about it. He said the extra foam kept the beer insulated and keeps the carbonation in. This really began to bug me because it reeked of BS. I let it go and just enjoyed the rest of our dinner. When I came back from our trip, it still bugged me. So I had to do some research about pouring Belgian beers. Couldn't find anything about the way he said was the proper way to pour beer. Now I just assume he was too lazy to put down his serving tray and pick up the glass and pour a proper beer. This is a real turn off since he just ruined some really nice Belgian beers.\\n\\nWould I come back to this place again? Yes I would.

Western Bikeworks did the exact opposite. As soon as I walked in I was genuinely greeted by an employee named Eric. He spent a better part of the next hour helping me get my bike in full working shape, giving me tips, and explaining everything that was going on.

Granted, the restaurant has only been open for one week. But there are certain things that probably won't ever get fixed, and here are our opinions:\\n\\nFirst, the chips. They come with a spice on them.  Doritos has nothing to worry about. But who wants to have spiced chips in a Mexican restaurant? Especially when the spice doesn't taste good. The spice here is called \\"Rocco\\" spice. As an alternative, you can order them \\"clean.\\"  We had them both ways.  We could not finish the first spiced batch.  Either away, the chips are not particularly good. They are worse, however, with the spice. \\n\\nTo add insult to injury, the \\"chips and salsa\\" costs $3.\\n\\nNow let's talk about the \\"salsa.\\" It's really not. It's really a bland pico de gallo. Everything in the pico de gallo was fresh, but it simply had no pizzazz. Bland. We were able to convince our waitress to bring us a bottle of spicier taco sauce. That was pretty good. But it took some asking and convincing to get it to our table.  Worth the try, however.\\n\\nNext up, the $12 guacamole. To get to the point, it was not very good. Also, it is served in a very rough type of stone type bowl. How they can properly clean it was kind of a mystery. Anyway, the guac is both expensive and not good. $12 for not good guacamole is over-the-top. And we really couldn't figure out why it wasn't any good. The ingredients seem fresh, although the Hass avocados might have been a bit too ripe and they may have been too eagerly crushed.  But we suspect the reason might be because they used this \\"Rocco\\" spice in it. \\n\\nThe tacos were okay. \\n\\nThe rice on the platter was a little bit salty and did not taste particularly good.  The side salad included on the platter was pretty good.\\n\\nOne of the things multiple staff members boasted  of was the restaurant's wide variety of fine tequilas - more than \\"300.\\"   Then, they wanted to know whether I wanted to have one of these fine tequilas, as a special promotion,  in a margarita that cost $8. They said they had no real happy hour.   I couldn't help but think, why would anyone spend money to have a good tequila in a margarita?  I declined.\\n\\nWe noticed other customers ordering, apparently, some of these fine tequilas in small glasses. These small glasses had a wedge of lime on the lip of the glass with, apparently, some salt around the rim.  It certainly looked pretty.  But in my experience, people only use the lime and salt trick if they are in high school or a fraternity, or simply don't know that that is the way to cut the bad taste of really cheap and nasty tequila.\\n\\nPerhaps these other customers were drinking something other than one of the 300 fine tequilas.  But I can't imagine a restaurant ever promoting  that it has cheap and nasty tequila and small glasses ready to go with lime and salt around the rim.  Again, I don't know what they were, and I did not try them.  Or perhaps tourists simply like the salt and lime 'authentic experience.'\\n\\nWe ordered Negra Modelo beer.  One bottle, the other draft.  We were surprised that the draft tasted significantly better.  Excellent, in fact.\\n\\nThe service was adequate. Merely.\\n\\nThe location on the lake is pretty.  The outdoor ambiance is nice.  The decor will appeal to the younger crowd.  Does Mr. Rocco have a relative who is a designer?\\n\\nIn a head-on comparison with Cantina Laredo, only .5 miles further west on Sandlake Rd., Cantina Laredo for us wins hands-down. The food is better. The drinks seem like they might cost less.  And the chips and salsa are definitely better, and free. Yes, you don't get a lake view. But the back patio at Cantina Laredo is nice, and the inside is comfortable with a nice gas fireplace and lots of leather.  Quieter -- which is nice if you like to speak to your companions.\\n\\nCantina Laredo is a little hard to find.  But parking is easy, and its not far from this place.  \\n\\nI am somewhat surprised about all the sterling reviews.  Me suspects something's up."},{"name":"Giacomo's Ristorante - Boston","address":"355 Hanover St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"It was one of those cold...not so cold december day when no one wanted to eat out, I guess ...lucky for us we just walk in and got a table.

But I guess, like Keens, it just misses something to hit the upper strata of my regard.\\n\\nSo on my recent trip to Austin, I had a chance to try a few new places and The Salt Lick was one of them. I'd seen it profiled a zillion times on the Food Network and had heard about it from tons of people, so I couldn't help but go out there with a crew of local friends.\\n\\nI was not disappointed.\\n\\nDecor: It's got that old, Texas cowboy country house vibe to it. It's obvious that the place brings the masses during peak hours, because there is a ton of outdoor seating for those who have to wait. Luckily, we came on a Friday afternoon, a little after lunch, and so we were ushered into the main building immediately.\\n\\nI loved the feel of the place, from the meats cooking in the pit, to the old, worn tables and benches. It looks like what I think a BBQ joint should look like.\\n\\nService: Friendly. professional, warm and outgoing. Very helpful and fun, our waiter was on point through the process. I'd say the hostess was a little less excellent, but I'm just being picky I think.\\n\\nFood: We all ordered the \\"Family Style\\", which must be a favorite at The Salt Lick, because it is an endless amount of ribs, brisket and sausage, along with coleslaw, potato salad, bread and pickles and onions. And damn, man, it was good. Meat for men (and women who like men or even women who hate men, but like meat! Basically, a vegan's worst nightmare)! \\n\\nThe ribs: My favorite, but I am partial to ribs and they were delicious. Sweet, delicious, and flavorful. If I had any complaint about them, I wish they had been a touch meatier and softer/juicier, but that's it. I did love them.\\n\\nThe brisket: Delicious. And I am generally not a huge brisket fan, but I did love the brisket. The \\"moist\\" brisket was better (doh--its fattier!), but even the dry brisket hit the spot.\\n\\nThe sausage: I am more of an Italian sausage fan and don't generally like the type of sausages that are used for BBQs, but these were as good as it gets for BBQ style sausages. Mixed with a little of the house sauce, it was great.\\n\\nSpeaking of house sauces, they had two: the \\"normal\\" and the \\"spicy\\". Oddly, while I love spice, the \\"normal\\" was my favorite and one of the best BBQ sauces I've ever had.\\n\\nThe Peach and Blackberry Cobbler: I got the combo, which was a half slice of both types of cobblers, along with a scoop of vanilla ice-cream. I think I am still dreaming about the peach cobbler. Not that the blackberry cobbler wasn't good, but the peach cobbler was the king of all peach cobblers. The very best I've had. It was just too good, in fact, because I finished it even though my bloated belly had no space for it! I was in pain from stuffing myself!\\n\\nAnd that was The Salt Lick.

I will certainly return next time I'm in Austin!"},{"name":"Pio Pio Restaurant","address":"5803 Precision Dr","city":"Orlando","stars":"4.5","text":"Best food ever!!! The skirt steak is amazing!

It's BYOB and in the middle of the hill country.  The sausage is consistent and when the spare ribs are on, they're the best I've found.  Brisket is average.  Beef ribs can be quite good, but again, they're hit or miss.  Prime rib on Sunday is nice.\\n\\nA few tips...\\n\\nIt is BYOB and cash only.  They're on well water, so if you're not accustomed, order a soft drink or drink your beer.  If you're not sure whether you're up for all you can eat (aka family style), order a plate first.  If you want more, upgrade from the plate to family style for the price difference.\\n\\nAfter the first round of all you can eat, you won't get the best cuts of brisket (front end) unless you ask for lean.

When we walked back to stand in line, it was already at the corner.  That was at 4:30pm.  This location definitely does not take reservations but I knew that so waiting wasn't so bad.  It wasn't until around 6pm we finally got seated right by the kitchen.\\n\\nRosemarie greeted us and got us started on the calamari app and some beverages. I ordered the Linguine with Mussels in the fra diavolo sauce.  This was the best pasta dish I have ever tasted in my life.  I was told that the food here is worth the wait and they weren't joking.  The sauce was to die for and the mussels were cooked perfectly.  I couldn't stop eating but at some point, you just have to stop.  I took a to go container home and left it at my sisters house.  I wish I finished that pasta!\\n\\nOur dinner took 50 minutes which was a lot less than the wait.  Rosemarie kept the food coming but I never felt rushed.  You can definitely tell that she was the seasoned server and the one in charge.  She barked out orders and told the servers how many set ups to have at each table. She knew how to keep that line moving as quickly as possible.\\n\\nI can't wait to come back to Giacomo's.

Barecelona offered a $25/person menu, so I quickly made a reservation online for an outdoor table to try it out.  We decided to go on a Wednesday night and hopefully miss the insanity that is IPRW.\\n\\nWe showed up on time for our reservation and were told our table wasn't ready, my pet peeve.  We moved into the very crowded bar and enjoyed a cocktail while waiting.  And we waited.  And we waited.  And we waited... (on a Wednesday night, y'all).  After about 30 minutes, our outdoor table finally opened up.  We were seated at a very tiny table that was really meant for 2; luckily, the next table over was getting up and we were able to snag their 4 top that made much more sense for our group.  The hostess made me feel high maintenance to ask, but really - after all that wait, we should have been accommodated with a table that made sense for a group of 4 (not to mention our upcoming tapas and drinks).  The change was quickly made and next thing I know, a group of 2 was seated at our original table (and they even looked crowded!).\\n\\nOur waiter was absolutely lovely and quickly helped us forget our long wait and table snafu.  We essentially ordered everything on the menu, thanks to the Restaurant Week offer.  To be honest, everything was good and nothing really stands out to me as a \\"must order,\\" aside from the albondigas and empanadas. Truly - everything was good.

The Pork shank my father-in-law ordered was stellar - melted in your mouth, with wonderful flavor.  I suspect this is the type of dish this place excels at versus pasta.

Ever.  The butternut squash ravioli is definitely one of the favorites and a must-try.

I think that is their best sauce, although their lobster-based Giacomo's sauce is good too, the fra diovolo is the most flavorful. And there is always a special that gives you a 1/2 lobster with mussels/clams over linguini for about the same price, which is amazing too. The flavors are fantastic, the portions large, the food fast and consistently delicious and all much more reasonably priced than other restos in the north end.\\n\\nAnd, wine and beer are cheap.\\n\\nThere are a few downsides -- the potential for a long wait outside in line (which sucks when it's cold) because it's quite small and they don't take reservations... and cash only.

Both of them wreaked of cigarettes. Upon sitting we were not given any menus but told to look up at the chalkboard and \\"pick our seafood.\\" We weren't planning on ordering seafood. We tried to order salad but they ran out (?) and this lady did not give us one second to think. She was practically hunched over my boyfriend asking us what we were ordering. We had only been sitting there for about 5 minutes and already wanted to leave. We quickly ordered the calamari and two chicken parm entrees. The food came out fast and piping hot. It was less than alright and even if it was amazing, it was nearly impossible to enjoy anything in this ambience of employees counting money in different corners of the restaurant and a young man staring at us with a hoodie over his uniform. Out of all the great restaurants in the North End I can't imagine why anyone would choose this place. It really did seem like no one in there knew how to behave in or run a good restaurant.

Knock you off your chair amazing.\\n\\nAmuse Bouche: squid noodles - absolutely delicious with the toasted garlic on top being a standout component.  I randomly asked a server, who wasn't even our ours, how they prepared this dish and he listed the entire culinary process, step-by-step.  So impressive.\\n\\nAppetizer: ragout with mushrooms, morcilla (Spanish blood sausage) and pig - an unbelievable mixture of flavors, textures and colors.  The blood sausage was rich, complex and simply delicious.  The most beautiful plate of the meal.\\n\\nEntree: pork three ways - simply stated, this was one of the top three entrees I've ever had in a restaurant anywhere.  All three preparations (rib, belly and confit) were mind blowingly awesome.  They literally couldn't have tasted any better.  The vegetables on this plate were wonderful as well.\\n\\nDessert: panna cotta with granola and brown butter \\"powder\\" - light, delicious and unique.  The granola was flavored with lavender.  The brown butter \\"powder\\" disappeared on your tongue instantly and then left a brown butter flavor afterwards.  Very unique and well executed use of molecular gastronomy.\\n\\nThe macaroons served with the check were delicious as well.\\n\\nService: perfect in every way.  Friendly, not intrusive and most of all, knowledgable.  Very, very knowledgable.  Such a wonderful thing to experience when you go out for fine dining.\\n\\nOur table was a high top for four that basically overlooked the open kitchen.  Probably about 10 feet away or so.  Sitting at this table and watching Chef Maws and his team work was fascinating and inspirational.  It added to the dining experience in ways we weren't expecting when we sat down.  I plan to specifically request this table again when I return to this restaurant.  Watching this team work during our meal was breathtaking.\\n\\nOther items I tried throughout the night were the vegetable amuse bouche, pig's tail appetizer, charcuterie appetizer, bone marrow appetizer, chicken entree, steak entree, oxtail pastrami side, galette dessert, bread/butter and espresso.  Everything I tasted was great.  The pig's tail appetizer was ridiculously delicious.  Like eating the greatest Chinese food you could ever fathom.\\n\\nI cannot wait to return to this restaurant and experience the food, service and ambience again.

The only issue I really have with the place is the low quality cheese they put on the burger, but the freshness of everything else makes up for it. If I can enjoy a cheesesteak from Pat's, then I can enjoy the cheese on Five Guy's burgers.

I used to appreciate it as a lesser-known, intimate but no-nonsense restaurant with traditional dishes prepared with a lot of care and great ingredients. This time was a very different experience. The place was full to the gills. The tile floor and hard ceiling plus huge crowd made it so loud, at times I could not hear my friend across the table. It felt like a mass dining experience.

Oddly, the waitress did not acknowledge this and I had to point it out. It was instead a salad with grilled zucchini.

Also on more than one occasion we have been given dirty silverware to eat with (and I'm not talking a little smudge on the knife here). The food for there weekend brunch is probably as good as your local breakfast place and twice the price. The food overall keeps me coming back though for the most part. Here are some positive things. I really like the decor, and on a nice day its a great experience sitting outdoors and enjoying a drink and a meal. Kind of pulls the whole Newbury Street theme out to the suburbs.
