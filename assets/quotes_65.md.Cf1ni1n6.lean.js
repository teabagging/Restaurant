I have been eating at Athen's for about five years. The food here was once very good  and could always be counted on to be fresh, BUT...The past few months the food has gotten really bad. I usually order either their Veggie sandwich with Athen's potatoes, their steak sandwich with athen's potatoes, their Lasagna with sausage added or their spaghetti with extra meat sauce and extra sausage. Their sausage was once spectacular, they once made their sausage several times daily, but in the past few months they have started cooking their sausage the day before (dare I say 'leftovers?) and when I go for dinner (on the next day) the sausage is hard and dried out, it's worse than chewing on leather, seriously. Pasta is usually cooked  well and their sauces are nothing special, but they are acceptable. They have started putting so little dressing on their salads that you're basically eating a salad without dressing. Their food has gone from nicely seasoned to bland. Overall I would give their food a 2/5 (Sausage 1/5)\\n\\nAtmosphere:\\n\\nThe place is decorated with small flags around the perimeter of the room and they have some decorative things which makes it okay, it's definitely not fine dining, but it's not a dive either. However, the place usually hasn't been cleaned very well, seats and tables are wiped off but there is dirt and dust on window sills, plants (fake) and between the seats and the walls. I would give cleanliness 2/5\\n\\nService:\\n\\nService can range from excellent to horrible. I always request Angelo's zone because he is the best waiter they have, in my opinion. He always gets the orders right, always refills drinks promptly and rarely has a bad day . As far as bad goes, one particular waitress name comes to mind. She has messed up my orders, taken forever to refill drinks,  eaten while working (which I think is disgusting and probably a health code violation) and generally has a \\"I don't give a $h1! attitude.\\" (in my opinion). I would rank general service at 2/5 ( I would give 3/5 except for that one crappy waitress), but I give Angelo a 5/5.\\n\\nSummary:\\n\\nOverall, this place has gone way downhill. The food has gone from acceptable to \\"I don't want this nasty crap\\". Their sausage was once the best items on their menu, now it's the worse. Service ranges from excellent (Angelo) to horrible (there's a few other names I could mention). I give them 2/5 because because their food has become nasty and their average service leaves much to be desired.\\n\\nAs I 'was' a very frequent customer at Athen's I decided to mention the sausage issue and a few other issues to the 'manager' (some pregnant lady with a russianesque accent) and she simply gave excuses and said there was nothing wrong with the way our food was prepared. My roommate and I simply told her we would not be back because of these issues and she had nothing to say. She charged us full price for the meal and we left. Athen's has lost three customers for life due to the recent development of bad food prep practices and a manager that doesn't seem to care what their customers complain about."},{"name":"La Casita","address":"1355 Bethel Rd","city":"Columbus","stars":"3.5","text":"It's OK.

Most of the time the food is fantastic (especially the turkey brie), but other sandwiches I've gotten were sometimes soggy (tomatoes do that though). \\n\\nStars were lost for the inconsistent customer service. This will come off sexist unfortunately, but it's just the way it turned out: the service I experienced from the male servers was always pleasant and helpful (if I can't decide I ask for an opinion), and the service I get from the female servers is a bit of a hit and miss. They don't seem to smile or look patient as you survey the many options in the glass case. I remember the A-board outside said \\"free coffee with breakfast sandwich\\" and I was buying breakfast so why not ask if I could get the free coffee.

Never, ever expect to arrive, ask for a table, and just be seated. No, no, no. I've dined here 3 times. The first time I came 15 minutes before they even opened, and still had to wait 30mins-1hr for brunch. Always expect at least an hour wait for lunch and even 2 hours for dinner. Just plan accordingly and it's not an issue. They take down your number so you can wander around. I came here most recently at 4:30pm on a Sunday and still had an hour to hour and half wait.

Boston Public Market so I would recommend walking over there and checking that out if you need to kill time.\\n\\nSo is the food worth the 1.5 hr wait? YES. My boyfriend and I started off with 2 orders of the uni toast ($4/ea). It comes out on a nice thick cut of bread. I love love LOVE uni toast, but I could opt out of this. It's mostly loaded with butter and not enough uni flavor. Don't get me wrong, it's good but eh. The cold lobster roll ($30) is my FAVORITE. Loaded up with lobster and not too much mayo. This is why I am willing to wait 1.5hrs to be seated. The bread is buttered up and nicely toasted. It comes with a generous side of fries. The fries are soggy, not crispy at all - so it may not be for every one, but feel free to get the side salad instead.  Their Sunday special is Lobster tacos ($36) so my boyfriend decided to order that too. This is an awesome spring dish. Very light. Comes with 2 tacos and about 8 oz of lobster, veggies, and topped off with an avocado crema and a little salsa. That salsa packs a spicy punch.

The prices seemed reasonable to me given the quality of the dougnuts ($2-3.50 depending on the variety), though not being from this side of the pond I am not really familiar with normal dougnut prices.\\n\\nThe chai was a little lacking in flavour so I asked for a top up of syrup which made it just right.

I opted for the gingerbread cake dougnut, which was still good the next day, and dare I say a good contendor? I am so so sad to not have these doughnuts available whenever I want them.

Also, she walked past us 2 times (that I noticed.. who knows what other times she zoomed by) without ever saying a word to us. Not asking how we're doing, if we need boxes, more drinks.. the check?! That was a joke of service. \\n\\nThe better/good: Food\\nI got the fried chicken and biscuits . I loved the biscuits, pretty nice and flakey as well as moist of butter. The chicken was pretty good -- but don't expect \\" real fried chicken\\" aka no bones ( think chicken parmesan type cutlet, breaded and fried). I thought the breading was great, really nice and crispy and flavorful, but the chicken was dry. The gravy sauce helped that out a lot though. The poached egg was a bit overcooked, so I give a solid 3.7 stars on this dish alone. \\n\\nMy dining partners seemed to love their dishes though. They loved their individual breakfast pizza , the corned beef hash and breakfast sandwich. Seriously a pretty solid brunch spot -- food-wise anyway."},{"name":"Portland City Grill","address":"111 SW 5th Ave, Fl 30","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"The view overlooking Portland is unbeatable.

For our entrees we got the hot lobster roll and the cioppino. The lobster roll was ridiculous. I am definitely sold on connecticut style. My only complaint is that the roll didn't necessarily seem up to the task of holding on to that much buttery lobster. Other than that though, amazing. My cioppino was very good as well and contained quite a bit of seafood. It looks kinda small at first, but in the end it turns out to definitely be enough food. The service was fine for such a fast paced place. I can't say that it was stellar by any means, but it was more than acceptable for a place of this size with epic wait times.

What I didn't appreciate was the lack of separation from public to private. We were having a private party and random people kept coming up. No signs posted, no nothing.

This would imply they are getting the same product all the time and who knows how long its been sitting around.  Not at Neptune.

My low rating is for two reasons.  First, it's $9 for half a pound of meat ~ and nothing else.  Well maybe it comes with a slice of bread, but that's hard to tell because the chicken came with bread and the brisket came with nothing.  That's seriously expensive and at that price point both should come with a slice of bread and a small container of either slaw or potato salad.  We tried both their original sweet sauce and the hot carolina sauces and they're obviously purchased from bottled food service, not homemade, which is inexcusable.  Second issue was the service.  The clerks were bored and borderline rude.  We clearly ordered a side of coleslaw and they ignored the order, didn't charge for it and didn't provide it.  Went back to buy it as a separate side since they forgot it in our original order (luckily we were eating there and it wasn't a takeout order) and they tried giving us a tiny container for $4.  We questioned the portion side so they then gave us a pint container's worth.  So which is supposed to be the $4 side size, a tiny cupful or the pint we got?  Between the overpricing and the employees, it's not good enough to go back.  Plenty of other good barbecue places in Atlanta with better value for the money and well trained staff.

But when they did the bartender apologized and gave them to us for free so I couldn't be too mad about it.  The food is good bar food.  We got the appetizer sampler #2, and they probably aren't making fresh potstickers in the kitchen so I'm sure some of it came out of a bag in the freezer but everything was tasty and exactly what I expected it to be.  My friend enjoyed his burger, or he seemed to by the way he wolfed it down.  I got the pastrami sandwich, grilled (instead of boiled) and with French fries instead of potato chips (French fries cost extra).  The sandwich was delightful.  The pastrami was grilled up nicely so it had little crispy bits and the cheese was nice and melty.  And it was deliciously greasy.  I loved it.  The fries were good too.

The server complained that in order to fix they'd have to re-make an entire burger. My friend said it'd be fine if they did that. Server didn't seem to happy. I've pulled this trick as a server and what she's trying to do is to get you to say \\"Oh no no, I'll be fine. I'll just eat the burger like this because I don't have time to wait for another burger.\\" But no, my friend kindly insisted it just be cooked a bit more (at least Medium as requested). \\n\\nWhat shocked us was that all of the sudden the server completely stopped making eye contact, stopped smiling, and stopped giving the good service she was giving before. Water glasses were left empty, she was refilling and spilling all over the place and acting like we were a nuisance.

It may have been where I was seated (at one of the 5 bar stools over by the prep kitchen).  It took too long for a server to notice me sitting there to finally get a cocktail and order some food. Then, it was hard to look / spin around to find someone when you needed something as your back was always to the restaurant.  Certainly, the kitchen staff in front of you was entertaining, but far too busy to assist or flag someone down when you needed something.  Staring at them was awkward and the high counter prevented you from seeing much of the action (at least at my meager 5' 8\\" height).  So, I would not choose to sit there again.

The waitstaff, as others have commented are terrific, friendly and attentive especially when there is only a small crowd. I've eaten at more than a dozen sushi restaurants, and many decent Asian buffets like Changsho on Mass Ave (much better decor/atmosphere & lower price for lunch buffet, can't compete with food quality, and variety). And Maki Maki beats them all. Hands down, it's the lunch buffet I'm talking about. \\n\\nI know they are awefully busy on weekends and I suspect many of the negative reviews reflect that time.

I don't like being told there is a twenty minute wait when seats are absolutely plentiful inside, I'm having a hard time imagining VIP reservations at a pretentious \\"pub\\" in Brookline, but what do I know.

We can talk menus all day, maybe that's another article in the future, but American Craft does not have any pre-arranged burgers, which to me translates into laziness. Customization is a key element, to each his own, but for those out there who can't come up with clever combinations on their own, you might end up screwing up with say, mashed potato and spinach as a topping. $11 gets you a hamburger on a Challah roll, lettuce, tomato, and a pickle. That's it, the addition of cheese is $1, most standard toppings cost $2, and the premium toppings, which include bacon, foie gras and truffle butters, costs $3. I go with cheddar and bacon, which I have issues with costing the same as foie gras or truffles, but the heart wants what the heart wants. So we're already talking about a $15 burger, I'm already thinking I should have just gone to Craigie for an extra $2, this burger better deliver I keep repeating to myself. Now maybe if it was $9 I could let some things slide, but for $15, I expect greatness, and this is not a great burger. It's a very good Pub burger, which doesn't say much in my book, it's slightly under-cooked (better under than over of course) and is juicy, but just not a ton of flavor. Decent smoke adds a nice element, but it's lean tasting and really needs some fat. My $3 bacon, nothing more than three chewy strips, is a fail, and the cheese isn't melted, never becoming one with the burger, as it should, and just sits there, half attached to the meat, half dangling from the bun. And the bun, Challah, as mentioned, is basically from the same family as the Brioche, but I swear I wont go off on a Brioche rant once again, my previous opinions of this type of bun have been well documented, no need to make my point again.\\n\\nThe fries are typical pub style, skin-on, which does not automatically equal flavor, as many believe. They need salt, as is the case with many fries I encounter. While the beer list is extensive, there's just something so elitist about this place. I don't think it's tied to Brookline, but it wouldn't surprise me either if it was. Everything is over-priced, the dessert menu is \\"Under Construction\\" somehow, and the pretentiousness is everywhere, from the menu descriptions, to the attitudes of the hostess and the waitresses. I never felt welcome, and the food didn't do enough to make me want to come back."},{"name":"Brothers Taverna","address":"283 Derby St","city":"Salem","stars":"3.5","text":"My friend and I wanted some breakfast so we stopped at this place.

We hung out in a coffee shop for an hour, no problem. \\n\\nWe came back when they called us, and three of us promptly ordered the hot lobster roll with our very accommodating server, who said of course we wanted the lobster rolls. \\n\\nMy brother ordered the cioppino, a seafood stew of everything *but* lobster (though you can request it for an additional $10). \\n\\nLobster rolls arrived stuffed and overflowing with fresh chunks of lobster meat, coated in the right amount of butter: decadently, but not overpoweringly buttery. The toasted brioche buns were the perfect bread for the roll. \\n\\nNow here's where the service gets a gold star. The cioppino is served with rice-- but, our server said, the dish in his opinion \\"screams for\\" a side of bread as well. So he took it upon himself to include that with the order. Say what? The service was truly above and beyond. \\n\\nThroughout the meal we were attended to and our water glasses were topped off as often as fast as we could drink them. \\n\\nService, again, was exemplary.

I'm on vacation so weekday morning drinking is normal right?? I got the Oregon orchard which had gin, apricot liquor, verjus, regan's no. 6, bubbles. It was slightly sweet and the bubbles finished it off nicely. \\n\\nThe potatoes bravas came with an egg and aioli. I can't even describe the mix of flavors, but all I can say is, you CANNOT come here without ordering this dish. It is the best potato dish I have ever had. EVER. The potatoes were cooked perfectly.

I would've licked the mini skillet if I could. \\n\\nI also ordered the Korean fried chicken with rice, house kimchi, and 2 eggs. It was spicy and I never thought to eat this kind of dish for breakfast.

It came in a stone pan with almost like a cornmeal pancake as the base with 3 flank steaks cooked to whatever your heart desires with the side of scrambled eggs topped with cheddar cheese. It comes pretty hot so be careful. I almost burnet my hand trying to grab the handle because I was so hungry and in a rush to shove all the food in my mouth.

Without a doubt, my experience at Neptune Oyster was the best meal I've ever eaten.  There, I said it.  Hopefully my grandmothers and mother don't hold it against me!  (I'm sure they'd agree.)\\n\\nAfter putting you name down, you'll probably have over an hour-long wait.  The host takes your phone number, so if you're from out of town and haven't ventured around the North End, this would be a good time to do it.  I swear, you feel like you're in the middle of The Godfather--super authentic Italian feel.  (I wouldn't push the timing, though, or you won't have a table when you get back.)\\n\\nNeptune Oyster is really small inside--dark and cozy--so you'll be squeezed right next to the people beside you.  Not that that's a bad thing.  What better way to make new friends than over some delicious food!\\n\\nWe started with the Clam Chowder.  Best clam chowder in my book!  I like how it's on the lighter side (even though it's still cream-based).  The chunks of potato are cooked to perfection--not too hard or soft.  The large chunks of clam also don't have a rubbery texture to them.  (Get it with the cracked pepper.  It gives the dish a little somethin' extra.)\\n\\nBut that was just a warmup.  The Hot Lobster Roll is awesome!  With an overflowing amount lobster and healthy serving of salted butter seeping through the super-fresh roll, this lobster roll requires a fork and knife.  Sweet, rich, and delicious.\\n\\nAnd though it doesn't get enough recognition, the halibut filet was the best prepared piece of fish I've ever tasted.  The large filet flaked easily with a fork and had not the slightest \\"fishy\\" taste to it.  The seasoned breadcrumbs that encrusted the top added an excellent flavor that didn't take away from the fish.  It was served on a bed of vegetables, but it was the grapefruit that added a nice--and unexpected--sweet and sour kick.  Considering that this seems to be a rotating feature, I'd be tempted to order it over the lobster roll (shock!) if they had it again.\\n\\nReally, for anyone who likes seafood, you can't visit Boston without going to Neptune Oyster.  And even if you don't like fish, I think you'd like the stuff they serve up here--though then you may be so spoiled rotten you'd never eat seafood again anywhere else!"},{"name":"Tasty n Alder","address":"580 SW 12th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"Headed here with a friend while out in Portland.

We both had one drink, only because we sat with our glasses empty after we finished the first one for 25 minutes, never having been asked if we wanted another.

Beef was okay, gristly, def not anything special, and not enough au jus to counteract the somewhat dry bun.  If this is the best weck in Atlanta, I won't be trying the other places that have it.  Dogs looked great, though, wish I had gotten one of those instead.  And the fries were very good, so I'm giving it three stars.  But if you are from western NY, don't get your expectations up too high for the weck.\\n\\n(Edited to say that the owner Glenn wrote me an immediate email apologizing for my experience, and offering a discount on my next visit.

After ordering, the food came out 1 hour and 10 minutes later.  Prior to the food arriving, we were told it was on its way and should be out shortly. It wasn't.  Finally when the food came, it was overcooked. We had burnt waffles!  We did not send it back because we were starved and it took so long to arrive. When the waiter asked how the food was, we let him know many of the orders were overcooked. He shrugged and said \\"i brought the food over when it was ready\\".

Getting a reservation for myself and the parents required a bit of planning-ahead, but I managed with a couple of weeks' notice.  \\n\\nIn short, the food was mediocre-to-ok (2.5/5) but the service was poor (2/5).  \\n\\nThe restaurant is an unassuming brick building near Inman square.  I guess they were shooting for a farmhouse motif.  It all came off as kitschy and I thought the shower curtain at the front door was a tad obnoxious.  I guess it was supposed to be \\"whimsical.\\"  Nothing that a good meal couldn't out-weigh, however.\\n\\nWe were seated quickly and given menus to look over.  After a few minutes, the waiter stopped by and asked if we had any questions.  Now, we had divined that the two prices on the menu were for half and full portions.  So we asked the waiter, \\"Could you explain the difference between the full and half portions?\\"  His response was \\"Well, the full portion is twice as big as the half portion\\" and gave himself a self-satisfied little laugh.  Thanks.\\n\\nHe then proceeded to launch into a little spiel about a few items on the menu.  At the end of his spiel, my dad asked about one of the items he hadn't described - a barley flour rigatoni.  \\"Could you describe that for us?\\"  \\"Well, it's a rigatoni made from barley flour.\\"  *self-satisfied laugh*.  At that point, we figured we'd just fend for ourselves and placed our orders.\\n\\nService aside, I'll grant them that their menu is ambitious. Each item on the menu was an attempt to combine a challenging set of flavors into a single dish using some pretty refined techniques.  There was invariably a lot going on with each plate.  Some observations:\\n\\n- Overall, the meal only really ever hit on one note - earthy.  Everything, across all the dishes we tried, was uniformly earthy and umami.  I don't know if that's just the modus operandi here or what.\\n\\n- Leave a menu at the table, maybe?  Have the waiter briefly describe the dish when delivered?  With 3-4 unusual ingredients and textures and preparations per menu item we often had no idea what it was we were eating.  \\"Was that the pressure-cooked rye berry?\\"  No idea.\\n\\n- I admire the ambition it takes to create a new menu each day with such challenging ingredients, but it just wasn't working.  None of the dishes \\"wow'd\\" us.  Most were technically well-prepared, but the flavors just didn't come together. Some were ok.  Some were downright bad.  Some were just confusing (the \\"Brothers' Walk\\" dessert comes to mind).\\n\\nLong story short, I really wanted to like this place.  But it wasn't working, and it wasn't worth lead time to get a reservation.  And I won't be back."},{"name":"Stefani Gourmet Pizzeria","address":"263 Brookline St","city":"Cambridge","stars":"2.5","text":"As far as your basic, no pretenses, neighborhood pizza joints go, this place is great.

The server was very friendly but the rest of the food came out so slowly considering we were one of 3 tables in the entire restaurant. My son was completely finished eating before the rest of us got our entrees. I ordered the broccoli soup which was super thick and too salty followed by the steak frites. My husbands burger and inlaws fried shrimp were good. My steak was the strangest thing? It looked like I was served 3 slices of well done steak that looked like it was reheated plus 3 more slices of medium well steak which looked to have come from a completely different steak?

The ingredients are top notch and taste very fresh.  Most of the combinations are extremely well thought out and all of the ingredients complement each other well.  Our favorite, the sweet me featured perfectly caramelized (w/ sugar) onions and a delicious goat cheese.  The Kiddo's choice is ham and cheese, a perfect savory combination.  Empanadas are baked not fried allowing you to indulge in more. The dips go really well with the empanadas, for the two above we really liked the olivia dip but also enjoyed the pebre sauce (perfect spicy) with the chicken one  We also tried the fennel salad which also had zucchini slices and was really good.  While the food is very good, I'm not sure the price point would justify returning.  This is essentially a take out spot, or a very casual sit down.  For dinner we ended up getting a dozen empanadas (about 29$), 3 sauces (1.67 a pop) and a fennel salad (3 or 4$) to fill us and this ran us around 40$ with tax.  Burlington is loaded with great fast food options that are half the price (or less) of Del Sur and it's hard to justify spending this type of money for this type of experience.  The product may have more love and be slightly better but the price is going to make it difficult to become a regular spot for us.

During a trip to Portland this past summer I was feeling daring and decided, why not? Let me go into this tall building. If I have a nervous breakdown at least there's alcohol.\\n\\nSo..... on a hot summer's day I ascended to floor whatever for an epic happy hour. While the smart thing would have been to sit far away from the window, I decided.... why not? I'm already scared of being this high up so why not sit by a window and look down at the little people that look like ants. \\n\\nThey had a nice selection of beverages with very reasonable prices. I will say they add a touch too much simple syrup to their beverages which resulted in overly-sweet drinks. However, the sweetness masked the heavy pours so you didn't even taste all the alcohol that quickly got you buzzed.\\n\\nService was friendly and their food menu was respectable.

We were sat immediately, which was the only thing that happened in a timely manner the entire time we were there. \\n\\nWe took a little while to order since we weren't familiar with the menu - maybe ten minutes or so until we knew what we wanted. I wonder if this annoyed our waitress. Ordered a steak appetizer with red peppers, and then for lunch I had a cup of soup and my friend had a sandwich. \\n\\nWaited about 45 minutes for our appetizer and then our food another 10 minutes after that, but kind of expected it since there were at least two large parties of 10 or more in the establishment. We were next to the kitchen where we were able to watch the cooks get slammed like a wicker hut broadsided by a truck in a hurricane. The cooks themselves held up as well as they could, and for that I have much respect and hope that they each had a stiff drink after their shift was over. The food was delicious and satisfying. \\n\\nThe server herself was pretty dissapointing. I don't think she ever smiled, even when she came by after about 45 minutes with a couple of free appetizer coupons. I told her not to worry, it was a lunch rush and just kind of laughed it off. She didn't respond to what I'd said and handed the coupons to my male lunch partner without really missing a beat in her deadpan obligatory spiel, then walked away. \\n\\nThe restaurant cleared out, we finished eating, and then waited for the check that someone else got for us. We placed a credit card in the check presenter and waited for her to return. And waited. And waited, and waited. The people in the booths to either side of us were also popping their heads up and craning their necks looking for our waitress. Two of the guys to our right gave up waiting and even tried to leave before their food arrived, but one of their friends convinced them to stay and put up with our absentee waitress. \\n\\nAfter 20 minutes of staring at our neglected credit card in the card holder, we gave up and left cash on the table with only a mere 10% tip. It's the lowest tip I've ever given anyone. As we were walking out, we saw our attractive waitress, about 5'-7\\" with medium-length dark, wavy hair hanging out at the bar chatting with the hostess. I was looking at her the whole time we were leaving and she didn't or wouldn't notice me. \\n\\nEasily some of the worst service I've experienced in quite a while. We were willing to wait patiently, but the aloof, just-shy-of-rude treatment we got from our waitress really soured an otherwise decent meal in an stylishly designed restaurant.\\n\\nIf you must eat here, avoid that waitress.

The dining room is kind of noisy which still seems be a trend these days, but not so loud you can't hold a conversation.\\n\\nThe food has been described as Mediterranean which in this case means fresh ingredients, lots of herbs, and olive oil instead of butter. The menu is heavily oriented towards fish, so everything is healthy and tasty.\\n\\nWe had the oysters (they had 5 varieties, all of them from the northeast), the lobster raviolo, the whole fried fish (scup) with okra and peppers and the citrus poached striped bass.

Being from NC, I am kind of judgmental about cole slaw and they nailed it. \\nMy boyfriend got the Trotter and he killed it in less than 5 minutes, so that tells me that it was no less than amazing.  \\nTwo thumbs up to this establishment, and their more than attentive bartender, Toli."},{"name":"Pine State Biscuits","address":"2204 NE Alberta St","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"The wife and I took a drive from Seattle down to Portland today.  Pine State Biscuits was our first stop.  My wife loves fried chicken and biscuits and so do I.  We found some parking on the street and walked about a block up.  There were 7 or 8 people in front of us in line (11:30am).  I smelled something....what is that smell?  I know I recognize it from somewhere.....Ive smelled it before.  Oh yeah...its the smell of hipsters, hippies and BO ;-).  I thought I had escaped this crowd once I left Seattle...nope...they are here too, 150 miles South.  Nothing I hadn't seen before or couldn't handle though.  I'm just getting tired of going to places up here in the Pacific Northwest that I expect to be good, and turn out bad.  1000 hipster reviews are worthless.  I would rather get the inside scoop and reviews of places from a big guy like myself....at least we know truly great food when we see it......anyways.......enough of my side rant. The lady at the counter was super sweet and cheerful which was awesome! We placed our order for a McIsley, a chicken biscuit with a side of pickles, a corn dog, an order of fried green tomatoes, a thing of sweet tea and an order of chocolate milk.  Total was $21.00 even.  Oregon is cool because there is no sales tax on anything...food included. Here is how everything stacked up.\\n\\nMcIsley-  This thing looked fantastic.  I just wish that it tasted as good as it looked.  This whole thing was just kind of meh.  The chicken was cooked well and was the best part of the sandwich and was actually really tasty.  I could eat that chicken all by itself and be happy as hell.  This thing comes topped with mustard, honey and pickles.  Those ingredients were good too.  The biscuit on the other hand was pretty bad.  When you are a place that has \\"Biscuit\\" in its name, you would think they should be the star of the show.  Unfortunately it fell way short.  It was kind of hard/crunchy, not soft, dull, plain, tasteless.  I ate the whole thing but it was forgettable.  My wife said her chicken and pickle biscuit was ok but it lacked flavor also and suffered from the dried out syndrome like mine did.  Meh.\\n\\nCorn Dog-  This thing was really good.  They deep fry an andouille sausage on a stick and serve it with a mix of honey/stone ground mustard.  The sausage was tasty and had good texture.  The batter on the corn dog was a tad soft but it worked.  \\n\\nFried Green Tomatoes-  These things were really good too.  They give you about 6 pieces of tomato deep fried and served with ranch.  I had never had these before today and they turned out pretty good.\\n\\nChocolate Milk-  They use some kind of chocolate syrup or something.  This chocolate milk was fantastic!  It tasted like melted chocolate....reminded me of the melted chocolate ice cream flavor from Molly Moons in Seattle.  It wasn't too sweet but still satisfied.\\n\\nSweet Tea-  They serve this to you in a big mason jug which was cool.  It tasted great!\\n\\nOverall our meal was semi enjoyable.  Don't know if I would go back though even if I lived close by just because the biscuits were just so damn plain.  I don't know how you can be famous for your biscuits but they were clearly the worst part of the meal.....odd.  Hipster taste buds?  I noticed a ton of people rave about the Reggie.  Maybe because it has gravy and it softens the biscuits?  Who knows....I just wish they were better....thats all."},{"name":"Joey D's Oak Room","address":"1015 Crown Pointe Pkwy","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3.5","text":"I'm on a low carb kick right now and was up for something unfamiliar last night so my Yelp search sent me to Joey D's for the first time.

Chicken Marsala had tons of flavor, the sauce was my favorite especially on top of the garlic mashed potatoes. \\n\\nDecorations for the holidays was also lovely, it added a classy touch to the restaurant. \\n\\nThe service is where the 3 stars come to play. It took 45 minutes for just the appetizer alone to come out, this is never good if you're coming in hungry, which was my case. Our waiter was extremely rude, he would ignore us whenever we needed him. When we asked for the check we asked him something else and he walked away. What we were trying to ask him is if we could use the deal they have, which is if you check in on yelp you get a free appetizer with any entree. Of course we wanted to make sure we could use it and if we could, we wanted him to look at it before he went to get the check, so that he wouldn't have to go back twice. Well, since he walked away we couldn't do that, so we politely said \\"excuse me sir\\" to get his attention and he said \\"can you hold on?!\\" as he's by the computer, this obviously annoyed me. Another waitress heard him, looked at us and said \\"I'm sorry.\\" By this point he just wasted his own time and has to go back to put it in again (exactly what I was trying to avoid.) Then he snatches the phone and says hold on I have to ask my manager, takes the phone with him, comes back and like I expected the offer did work. He dropped off the check, didn't say thank you or anything and just walked off.

The decor, the layout, the furnishings, the clientelle, the bartenders...it all felt like a slightly divey lounge where washed up loosers hang out.

All-in-all this place totally bums me out.\\" \\nSERVICE:\\nNot bad, although strangely random and awkward, not at all polished. Even for a basement beer bar, it was a bit off. I felt like they were trying though. \\nFOOD: \\nI had nachos with chicken added. Risky, but I was surprised. Pretty good. \\nPRESENTATION:\\nSeemed like they were just using whatever was handy at the time. Like when you have your first apartment and you're using whatever you could scrounge from the parent's kitchen. \\nPRICE/VALUE:\\nThe beer can be spendy, but that's just the way sours are. I think maybe a smidge lower priced than Cascade on Belmont, but I can't be absolutely certain about that. My nacho plate was huge. It was on the appetizer/salad part of the menu, so I worried it would be a tiny portion, but nope. Good price too. I was overcharged for one of my beers.

We've been wanting to try out the restaurant for a while so I was thrilled to get one of the 9 tables in the place!\\n\\nBondir is extremely homey and has a big fireplace right at the entrance. I loved the atmosphere -- it was so cozy and the music selection/volume was just perfect.\\n\\nAs it was our first time dining, the waitress told us a little about the restaurant: Chef Jason Bond creates a new menu each day depending on what local ingredients are available. One of the things I liked most about Bondir is that all of the entrees are offered as half or full portions, so you have the option of essentially creating your own tasting menu (pricing is typically $16 half/$30 full). We decided to go with a few half portions so we could try lots of different things -- we ended up ordering 5 in total.\\n\\nWe started with a bottle of wine and some house-made bread. There were 3 different types -- a \\"sea bread\\" made with seaweed, a beer bread made with smoked flour, hops, beer and currants, and a four grain bread.\\n\\nWe were then given a little taste of the soup of the night, Roasted Root Cellar Vegetable Soup: soy roasted hazelnuts, crisp garlic. It was SO creamy and good. Almost made me wish I had gotten a big bowl full.\\n\\nOur first entrees to come out were:\\n\\n- The Roasted Winter Luxury Pumpkin: belted galloway bresaola, plum creme fraiche, nigella seed lavash, dahlia bulb, pickled ramp, oilive oil poached sunchoke.\\n- And the Smoked Haddock Brandade: mussels, hakurei turnips with ginger, preserved tomato, cubed berry syrup, caviar coquillage.\\n\\nThe pumpkin was a total surprise and I LOVED how all of the ingredients and flavors melded together to one amazing bite. The haddock was also delicious. The fish was presented as little cakes and all of the ingredients were spectacular (especially the plump, juicy mussels and the caviar)!  This was the one dish that I preferred the ingredients eaten separately than together.\\n\\nOur next course was the star of the night: Fresh Perigord Black Truffle Carbonara: spaghetti, farm egg, mangalitsa bacon, cardoons, chicories, breadcrumbs, smoked vacherin mont d' or.\\n\\nThe waitress brought over the dish and then grated some fresh truffle over the top. Before she started grating she let us smell it, and it was the first time I'd seen (or smelled) a whole fresh truffle. This dish was by far my favorite and worth every extra penny for it. The combination of pasta, runny egg yolk, bacon, vacherin and of course, the truffles, was just exquisite. The dish was incredibly rich and I'm honestly not sure how much I could have eaten of it on my own, so this portion was a good size.\\n\\nOur final course brought out our last two dishes:\\n\\n- North Atlantic Halibut: roasted leeks and wild mushrooms, macomber turnip aigre-doux, olive oil jelly, smoked salt froth.\\n- And Concord Rabbit Ragu: mint rigatoni, butternut squash, roasted treviso, long pepper, cream ricotta.\\n\\nI enjoyed the halibut but out of all of the fantastic dishes it was my least favorite. The fish was the one thing we tasted of the night that we thought was a bit under seasoned. However, for me spreading the olive oil jelly over the fish definitely helped liven up the flavor. I loved the mushrooms and the turnip in the dish, but wasn't AS blown away with this one like I was with the others.\\n\\nThe rabbit on the other hand was a clear second favorite for me. I think it actually evoked the most \\"mmms\\" for me out of all of the dishes. I'm not typically a fan of rabbit, but this was tender and delicious. The rigatoni was fantastic and the combination of the rabbit, squash, ricotta and pasta was perfection.\\n\\nWe decided to pass on dessert, but with the check came a final little treat: some  in-house made fruit leather and a very flavorful tart.\\n\\nOverall the food, service and atmosphere were spot on. it was a wonderful experience and perfect for a special occasion, I hope to return again soon!"},{"name":"Seven Hens","address":"2140 N Decatur Rd","city":"Decatur","stars":"4","text":"A chicken shop is not a place you'd expect to find great vegetarian food, but 7 Hens has some of the best veggie sandwiches around.

My major complaint is the chicken.  What are you doing with your chicken??? They claim to make their own \\"bone broth\\" (which don't be fooled by the fancy new-age name, broth has been made with bones since the beginning of cooking) but then the chicken they use in their soups tastes like canned or frozen chicken breast.  Completely dry and flavorless, the same texture as canned soup chicken.  If you make your own broths why not use the chicken in the soup?  Unless you don't know how to make soup.... you are supposed to take a whole chicken and veggies, just cover with water in pan, low simmer about 2 hrs until chicken starts to fall off bone.  Remove chicken from pot, pull meat off bones, return bones, skin, and gristle to pan.  Simmer several more hours.  Strain.  This is your \\"bone broth,\\"  Then add in fresh veggies and simmer until soft, add in your shredded chicken from before and you're done.

Both I and my granddaughter ordered the same as last year, the BBQ pulled pork sandwich. Thankfully it's the same sauce, which is my favorite. While we don't need an acre of food, I'm not exaggerating when I tell you that this time the sandwich was the same size as a slider. Not sure how a slider comes with an abundance of fries. My daughter ordered the fish and chips but substituted jasmine rice in place of the fries. The fish was not the fresh, flaky cod that was so excellent during last year's visit, but rather three tiny fingers that had meat like sear marks in the batter. She swore it was chicken, but the server (not Jordan) assured us it was fish. The kicker was it had no smell or taste. The rice was a portion enough for two. This was the special for eighteen dollars! We were looking forward to the red velvet cake we had last year, but were informed the dessert menu had changed. Nothing sounded too appealing but that's no reflection on the restaurant. The manager came by and she was super nice, we just wanted to communicate that the drastic change in downsizing the sandwiches to what appeared to be a non regular menu size, was odd, and also questioned the \\"fish.\\" At first she seemed puzzled by the appearance of the fish, then said it was catfish. She cheerfully said she'd take it off the bill. Not our intent but a nice gesture on her part. My question is who serves catfish as fish and chips?

My wife and I have been here quite a few times since then. Maybe we are frequenting the Altamonte location more than I realize. Anyway, we are at least \\"semi-regulars\\". The other day we had lunch here with my Mother-in-law and had a rather disappointing experience due to some menu changes. My mother-in-law had been consistently enjoying one of their entree salads for quite a while. It had some greens, bacon and they would top it with a protein of your choice, in her case she usually got shrimp. Well, they removed this menu item and our server unceremoniously told here it was no longer available. She didn't even go to the trouble to ask the kitchen or anything. Well, my dear M-I-L doesn't like to make a fuss so she just chose a different entree. The hurricane drink was great, our fried oysters and crawfish/fried green tomato starters and our chicken and shrimp entrees were all very good as well. Service was otherwise okay.\\n\\nMy reason for taking exception with their removal of the one menu item is twofold. First, they have not had the dish they call \\"catfish lizzy\\" on the regular menu or the specials menu for a long time and yet we have been able to get it by request the many times we have asked for it. Secondly, they have all of the elements for a salad with bacon and shrimp available as parts of other menu choices. So, why their kitchen couldn't take a few minutes to make a customer happy, especially at four o'clock on a weekday is beyond me. This experience has tarnished an otherwise great restaurant that we regularly frequent. I'm sure we'll be giving them another chance I just hope they step up and get back to the great service we have been used to for so long."},{"name":"Scampo","address":"215 Charles St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"Pros: Beautiful food presentation. The curried chicken roti was amazing. The server was nice and attentive.\\n\\nCons: NO lighting. We had to use flashlights to read the menu.\\nVERY loud. We had to shout the whole meal to barely hear each other.\\nMains were completely unimpressive, INCREDIBLY sweet and rich, with very little vegetable or savory element present. Didn't seem to be a main to pick that had any veggies.\\n\\nOverall: I will not be coming back.\\n\\nWe went to Scampo last night and I was thoroughly underwhelmed. When we were seated it was so dark we pulled out our phones to read the menu. The ambient noise was insane. I couldn't hear the waiter hardly at all (I was seated near the wall of a 4 person table) and we had to shout to hear one another.\\n\\nWe ordered the curried chicken roti to start, which was great. I would come back to Scampo and order just this. It was awesome. We had some cocktails which were good, but not outstanding. \\n\\nOur mains were plated beautifully, but had some issues. First off, none of the mains came with much vegetable on the side. My course (braised shortrib and risotto) was a strange combo. The shortrib was very sweet, not savory as I would have expected, and didn't go with the cheesy risotto at all. The risotto claimed to have jerusalem artichoke (sunchoke) in it; I did not taste this. I ate the two items separately, as they seemed two separate meals. The plate would have benefitted from some greens - arugula or seared spinach or something - all it came with was a sprinkling of cilantro, which went well with the shortrib but horribly with the risotto.\\n\\nMy partner had the squash ravioli, which was also incredibly sweet. It came with a \\"pumpkin seed brittle\\", which we expected to be a savory riff on a brittle. Wrong! The brittle was even sweeter than the ravioli. Had to pick it out and put it on the side of the plate. Eck. The few brussels sprouts on the plate were great. There should have been 100% more brussels, though, as they were the only savory/salty element on the dish.\\n\\nWe skipped dessert. The mains were sweet enough to be dessert. Overall, underwhelming and disappointing. I likely won't be back, except perhaps for a glass of wine and chicken roti at the bar if I'm in the area."},{"name":"Scampo","address":"215 Charles St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"There are few pizzas quite as unique as a lobster pizza, and Scampo more or less has the original, from its creator, Lydia Shire. So obviously, coming in, my expectations for this unique concoction were quite high. Fortunately, they were met.\\n\\nMy wife and I took what is probably a slightly unconventional approach here - rather than ordering the pizza as an appetizer, and then ordering separate entrees, we instead simply split two pizzas. This was a smart idea - I'm not sure either of us would've been able to eat a full entree after half a pizza. These pizzas, while the size of a \\"personal pie,\\" are very filling thanks to the mounds of meat and toppings placed on them. And let's be honest - when a lobster pizza is on the menu, that's going to be the main event.\\n\\nSo we decided not to beat around the bush, and ordered two pizzas for the table - the lobster pie and the white clam and bacon pie (as a lover of clams, bacon, and pizza, this was also high on my must-try list). The white clam and bacon pie was delicious, with generous heaps of clams and bacon and lots of arugula. As a native of southwestern Connecticut, this was definitely not the kind of white clam pie I was accustomed to (the kind you'd get in New Haven), but it was a wonderful take on the white clam pie genre.\\n\\nThe lobster pizza exceeded my very high expectations. I was a little worried that there'd be just a smattering of lobster, but my concerns were unfounded. There was plenty of lobster spread throughout the pizza, with a lobster sauce used for good measure. The taste of lobster permeated every bite, just as it should. It was tremendous.\\n\\nOf course, we're talking about a $28 personal pizza. Even with lobster on top, it's tough to justify that price for a 10\\" personal pizza. But given the sheer uniqueness of this dish, I can honestly say it's worth having even at a high price point. It's not something I'd do often, but as a visitor to Boston, when else would I ever get to have this unique pizza? It's an indulgence, but a worthwhile one.\\n\\nAfter we finished our dinner, we decided to split a dessert (which shows how filling these pizzas can be). We were going to order the tiramisu, but unfortunately they were out. Instead, we got the s'mores dessert, which was very delicious. I was surprised they were out of the tiramisu, but it wound up working out well since the s'mores were so good.\\n\\nI do have to mention the fact that it took no less than 20 minutes after we were seated for any staff to come over and take our drink order. At any restaurant, that's completely unacceptable, but it's doubly so at such a classy, high-end restaurant. The service was very good after that hiccup (we had two servers who were very kind), but the long period of us wondering \\"where's the waiter?\\" while sitting awkwardly with no food or drinks was unfortunate. I'm not sure if they realized that we were waiting so long, but the staff did not offer any sort of apology or acknowledgement of the oversight. I'm glad the rest of the evening went smoothly, fortunately."},{"name":"Chago's Caribbean Cuisine","address":"7301 N Lamar Blvd","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"Loved this place.. There are 3 vegetarian options in the menu - among appetizers there is Eggplant & Chickpeas Pastellilos, among specialities there is Paella Vegetariana and in Mofongo, there is Plantain Mofongo or the yuca version of it.

I don't agree (Tony Maws and Kristen Kish get that honor, in my book), most because of the lack of consistency. The first time I went to Bondir, I thought it was amazing - Bondir has an incredible commitment to the seasonality of products.  Ramps are only available during ramp season. Perigord truffles are only available during truffle season. The dessert menu is often an unusual mix of produce and traditional confections. On the way out, we bumped into Jason Bond himself who was hanging out in the front of the house. When we complimented him on the spectacular meal, he seemed genuinely surprised. Such a humble guy! It was truly a unique dining experience. \\n\\nThe second time I went, however, I was disappointed. For starters, they stopped serving appetizer-size portions of entrees (which means, no easy sharing!) The service - we had the same waiter! - had taken a nose dive.

The first time was several months back when I had a friend visiting from out of town. She was staying at a hotel in the SW so Tasty N Alder was the obvious choice for brunch. Being the weekend and prime bunching hour, there was obviously a wait. Someone had the amazing foresight to leave the thermal carafe by the door so you can enjoy some coffee while you wait for your table. I'd never encountered this anywhere else, but I'm hoping it will spread. All in all my first experience here was very pleasant. \\n\\nI came back here yesterday with the specific intent on trying their burger. My girlfriend and I both came on our lunch breaks with two other friends. We both work very close by and our two friends were visiting from out of town. We knew it was a little risky because there might be a wait, but we were pleasantly surprised to be seated immediately. The seating is definitely cozy, but not unpleasantly tight. \\n\\nThe waitress told us upon seating that the food comes out family style and will not come out all at once. We were aware of this and it was not an issue last time as everything came out within the same ten minute window. The weekday lunch menu is the same as the weekend brunch menu. We decided that my friend's GF and I would get burgers, he would get the ‚ÄãBim Bop Bacon & Eggs and my GF would get the Pork SchnitzelÔøΩ?(which she had confused, to comic effect, with spaetzle).  \\n\\nThe Bim Bop came out 15 minutes later and it was great. The egg was perfectly cooked, the pork was thick, and the kimchi had a nice kick to it. About 7 minutes later our burgers came out. I'm trying to find my favorite burger in PDX and currently the title goes to Lardo. It was a good size burger with two large slices of bacon hanging over the bun and a side of fries. Pretty great for $11. We ordered our burgers medium-rare on the waitresses recommendation. Personally, I'm a rare man, but I will defer to the house. After a few bites though, I could tell this was not a medium-rare burger. The texture and color was that of a medium-well burger. I also wish the burger came with an egg. The eggs here are perfect. Some of the best eggs I've ever had and I really think it would have helped the burger out immensely. Even being overcooked, the burger was still very juicy and the bacon was amazing. Not quite as good as Lardo, but a definite 4 star burger. It's nice it comes with fries, unlike the Lardo burger, and the fries are crispy and well salted. \\n\\nThe disappointment came with the Schnitzel.  We were told ahead of time it's family style, but it was a full 30 minutes between when the Bim Bop came out and when the Schnitzel came out. That's 20 minutes after the burgers came out. At one point, I'd say 15 mins after the burgers came out, the waitress came back and said they haven't forgotten about the Schnitzel and dropped off a complimentary half  Radicchio salad. It was unprompted which was nice, but they should have comped the Schnitzel . We had all finished eating and needed to go by the time the Schnitzel  came. She didn't even try a bite of it as she was full from the salad and eating from our stuff. She boxed the entire thing and took it for dinner. \\n\\nOther than the delay, the service was great and the food is top notch. I definitely plan on coming back to try the fried chicken and duck steak. I don't think I'll come back during my lunch break again and I don't need to have the burger again."},{"name":"Little Bird Bistro","address":"215 SW 6th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"While the rest of the menu is great, I have a hard time not ordering the burger.

They said it was Demo's and very good.\\n\\nI did check Yelp, where it seems that based on the star rating, the overall consensus is 3 stars. Still, I wanted to give this place the benefit of the doubt, and came here regardless.\\n\\nI was going to go for the Gyro, but I decided to go for the \\"Demos Special Kebab\\" which was a skewer with Pork Tenderloin, onions, peppers, and served with a side salad, and Syrian bread.  \\n\\nThe salad was extremely basic. It was lettuce, a single round tomato slice, and a decent amount of crumbled feta. The feta was mild, which I liked, although it was perhaps a little too mild. Salad had the smallest hint of dressing, which was great. I don't really like salads that are swimming in dressing. Now, they do have oil, vinegar, and a \\"house\\" dressing available. The house dressing seemed like it was a mix of the vinegar and oil, which was cloudy for some reason. \\n\\nSyrian bread (Pita) was exactly that. Nothing wrong with this, but it would be quite nice if it had been warmed up, even if just a little. \\n\\nNow the Kebab...The size of the pieces of meat and veggies was great, I would not have made them any larger of smaller. Everything was cooked perfectly, I did not find either the meat or the veggies to be on the raw or overcooked side. Veggies were flavorful, but that's because onions and peppers have a flavor when cooked. The pork on the other hand, while it was lightly juicy on the inside, was lacking flavor. It needed a little more seasoning, or to be marinated to some extent. \\n\\nLocation is clean, and is not run down, but with the decor and lighting, especially on a cloudy day it is rather drab.\\n\\nService is alright, could have been a tiny bit faster and more cheerful, but this is just a note, not a criticism per se. They weren't rude, so I'm a more or less happy camper. \\n\\nPrices are quite reasonable, but, there is the question of value. Not of the ingredients on the market, but of the value you, the person eating gets from their meal. Portion is good, but again, what are you getting? \\n\\nFinally, on a different note: Yay!

I never imagined so many different flavors of oysters and clams.\\n\\n We washed down the oysters with a pint of Guinness and finished up with a lobster roll.

Naturally, all of the problems she had could ruin any meal, but I have never come close to experiencing those problems at Blue Star.\\n\\n I have probably been 6-7 times, at various hours and days, and every trip has been equally pleasant. The greeters at the door are friendly and welcoming and my waiters have always been timely, polite, and cheerful. \\n\\nI usually get the grilled cheese appetizer because it is AMAZING. It has a whole collection of several different cheeses, all grilled to a gooey masterpiece between two thick slices of bread, which are perfectly crispy. For dipping, it comes with an apple chutney (I may be forgetting exactly what sort of sauce it is) and dijon mustard, and I also get a side of the Russian dressing which is an excellent complement to the sandwich.\\n\\nWith a side of star fries (which are seasoned to be very tasty, though sometimes are a little on the small side), the meal is very delicious. Plus, it's enough food for two meals (I am a big believer in doggie bags). If I can get two meals, plus at half price during happy hour, it's a good bargain. If you're eating a dinner entree and regular price, however, it can get a sightly pricey.\\n\\nI love the decor and feel of the restaurant (don't be tricked by the Cafeteria descriptor in the name). Everything from the silverware and glasses to the banquette and wallpaper is carefully designed to really create a great experience. It is a comfortable setting and a great backdrop to an enjoyable meal."},{"name":"The Sound Table","address":"483 Edgewood Ave","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3.5","text":"Sultry smooth spot.

Usually we go to Joey D's for lunch while shopping around the Perimeter, and we've never left hungry or unsatisfied. Usually you can just sit down right away for lunch, as the restaurant itself is a big, airy single room with ample seating. I've been for dinner a couple of times and reservations are a good idea. The decor could be described as steakhouse casual. Think fancy log cabin, not romantic or luxurious. Dress is casual, clientele is diverse. You certainly don't need a jacket here and you can definitely get away with nice jeans. You could probably even get away with not-nice jeans here, honestly, but keep it clean and crisp for Joey D's.\\n\\nOne of the great things about this place is that you get a lot for your money. This situation is rare: You can actually order two full sized entrees, which come with appetizer salads, and a bottle of wine and leave for around $100 with tip. Bottles of wine start in the low $20s price-wise, which is almost unheard of these days. You could even pull it off for a bit less if you don't get a steak, or booze.\\n\\nI've had the chopped steak, the filet and the NY strip and they are all delicious. Sides are good but nothing is really memorable. Here's a little protip: Don't leave without trying a honey butter croissant. However, you don't need to order the appetizer to get them. If you order an entree, you'll get a house salad with one of them on the side - and that's probably all you'll need."},{"name":"Tibby's New Orleans Kitchen","address":"2203 Aloma Ave","city":"Winter Park","stars":"4.5","text":"I Came with 3 others and we all loved Tibby's.

I typically love places that offer this kind of unique goods,  but things seem to sit on the shelf for long periods of time in this place and it's always completely empty of people.  Still I kept trying, but did not find much to delight in.  The items in the refrigeration case seemed to be remade every few days and only heated up for serving...good for taking home, but not fresh.  Some of the fresher charred items served with rice were placed under the warmer, but they didn't sell as well and so also need to be heated up.  The kebabs and rice were just not fresh enough, but the spices and flavor were still generally OK.  Then along came Cara and Spalla's.  She offered more Typical Chicago fare, which I didn't like at first... But I grew to love her homemade dishes, homemade salads, and very unique hotdogs.  Cara saved culinary delights, as now the place was filled with a steady stream of people every day... including some still willing to try some of the more traditional Russian dishes that were still being offered.  Recently Cara left, and culinary delights has adopted her full menu.  I find all of the offerings to be subpar, and not as good as the originals.   Culinary delights was a bright spot in a neighborhood with very little restaurant offerings, but this is definitely not their wheelhouse.   Perhaps adding the freshness and warmth of cara's dishes, to the tradition and heart of the Russian dishes will be an even better success.

As for us, we loved the garlic and heat and spices, and could not stop eating this. They give you so much sauce, it's amazing. This was also a good value at $19 for the shrimp since they were very large and good quality. \\n\\nWe also enjoyed two cocktails each and found them to be great, their glassware also has a vintage look and is very cool. \\n\\nLike I said the portions are BIG, we were very full after the 3 small plates and shrimp boil and could not eat dessert. Also one thing to note if you get any broil it will be a MESSY meal; we had to request wet napkins and plenty of paper napkins. \\n\\nI'm looking forward to going back and trying the full Bootleg special."},{"name":"Qdoba Mexican Grill","address":"62 Summer St","city":"Boston","stars":"2.5","text":"My number one burrito place in Boston.

Though it seems tiny on the outside, walk through the doors and you'll be floored by the gorgeous space, its light teal walls, tall ceilings and mirrors.\\n\\nI'm not really big on French food, to be honest. It tends to be too rich and too saucy for my personal taste, but after having looked through some of the reviews on Yelp, I had to give Little Bird a try.\\n\\nInstead of ordering entrees respectively, we decided to change things up a bit and ordered a bunch of smaller plates to share. We ended up ordering the blood sausage, snail tortellini, cassoulet of duck leg, eggplant bisque and, as Californian tourists deprived of fatty duck liver back home, foie gras.\\n\\nThe blood sausage, eggplant soup and foie gras came together first as a trio. Paired with a light citrusy salad, the homemade blood sausage was the meaty, herby foil and topped with a perfectly executed poached egg, there couldn't have been a tastier combination of flora and fauna. The eggplant bisque wasn't too heavy either -- it was slightly fragrant and had a taste that was subtle but still apparent enough, reminding you that you were sipping on an aubergine-influenced dish. \\n\\nThen there was the foie gras, buttery and decadent. Spread a little bit on one of the pieces of toast along with some marmalade and you get a bite of the smooth and rich liver and a bite of the tangy marmalade. It was all too good.\\n\\nAnd just as we were settling down from our first flight of small dishes, the waiter came around with the duck leg and snail tortellini. Presented in a cast-iron bowl, the duck simmered in a thick tomatoey broth with slices of pork belly, sausage and white beans. No bite was the same. Was that pork belly? Did you get a taste of the sausage? Could the white beans compliment the duck any better? \\n\\nThen there was the snail tortellini. Though it was not one of the dishes that stood out, the tortellini served as a nice palate cleanser after all of the other dishes we had.\\n\\nTaking into consideration the great service and the incredible dishes we had, Little Bird goes down in my book as one of the best places I've ever eaten at. Sure, I haven't been to a lifetime's worth of French restaurants (yet), but Little Bird will always have a special place in my heart. :)"},{"name":"DEE DEE","address":"4204 Manchaca Rd","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"Drove up from San Antonio to experience Dee Dee again.

There were about 15 of us. Our server was attentive at 1st but at one point it seemed he did forget about us and didn't return for about 10-15 minutes. Minor gripe. I sampled 2 of the cocktails, 1st the Peachtree then a Lemon Drop. The latter was much better than the 1st. \\n\\nI visited Barcelona, Spain this summer and had authentic Spanish paella so I was very interested to see how their version measured up. I think this also might be the only restaurant in Columbus that has it? I ordered the meat/seafood version with chicken, clams, mussels, squid and chorizo. While not quite on the level of what I had in Europe, it was very good! The rice was soft as it should be but not mushy, loads of meat and seafood. Others at the table had the salmon, and the short rib w/mac and cheese tapas dish and said they were good as well. FYI their menu changes regularly so what's available one day might not be a few weeks after. \\n\\nOne thing I didn't like is that a custom birthday cake was brought in for my friend's 30th along with cupcakes. While we were \\"allowed\\" to eat the cupcakes, if we wanted to have cake the restaurant advised us we would be charged $3 per person. With a larger group this was going to end up being more than the cost of the cake pretty much.

Generally speaking, when you're unimpressed with a place the first time around, it will be the same second time around.  But I was walking back from the South End tonight around 5 PM and decided to stop by here because I heard they had a vegan treat of some sort.\\n\\nThe place definitely had a surprising number of customers sitting and dining, but there weren't too many people in line.  So I walked past the sandwich making line, the cash registers, the treats behind the glass, until I got to the far end to wait in line.  There were about 3 customers ahead of me, and after waiting so long I gave up. \\n\\nThis place was an example of a \\"what not to do\\" when trying to be an efficient, organized, communicating customer serving enterprise.  There were about 5 employees behind the counter, and it was really like 5 toddlers running around a birthday party.  Seemingly, none of them were really doing anything, other than running around trying to look like they were doing anything.\\n\\nThey have one guy taking orders, another guy running credit cards, and another guy bagging up the treats.  I've never seen anything like it.  As an example of how this is a stupid idea, the lady ahead of me told the lady employee behind the counter, that she wanted 2 of the vegan chocolate cakes and 1 of something else.  But, she didn't want just any of the 2 vegan chocolate cakes, she had pointed to the ones she wanted.  Fine.  So that woman wrote up the order and passed it on to someone else.  That kid looked at the order ticket and then bagged up the 3 treats into the bag.  The woman who had ordered it was all the way at the cash register trying to pay and also trying to make sure the right ones were packed.  After the kid packed all the wrong ones, rolled up the top of the bag, passed it onto the cashier so the cashier could hand it to the customer paying, the woman paying said something to the effect of \\"those weren't the ones I pointed to\\" .   So, they had to take those out of the bag and reselect the ones she wanted.  At this point, I'm totally not annoyed at the woman, if some of the vegan cakes looked more delicious than the others, that's cool, but why would either that woman not bag it up herself, since she was the one who was told which ones to bag, or at least tell the kid who was in charge of bagging it.  \\n\\nThe customer ahead of her ordered a coffee and like a muffin or something and I witnessed how long this chirade was taking.\\n\\nI probably stood there 3 minutes, 2 minutes longer than I should have, not because they were busy and understaffed, but because the employees working here were too busy running around like little toddlers \\"Everyone run around frantically but actually get nothing done\\" type of situation, I actually turned around and left.  I was exhausted from watching this silliness and exhausted from waiting in a line for 1 vegan cake.  I'm sort of the same way, I can't get stuck on the sidewalk behind the \\"Sunday stroll, nowhere to go\\" pedestrians, I have to pass them on the left going twice the speed.

At $28 for a 10-inch pie, it's pretty indulgent, but you are getting what you pay for; it is absolutely delicious and covered with huge chunks of lobster meat. We finished up by sharing the \\"s'mores\\" dessert (they were out of the tiramisu we originally ordered) which was very good...and about as indulgent as the lobster pizza! \\n\\nScampo is a fun, classy place. I found the food lived up to my expectations, though it is on the expensive side for what it is, so this isn't someplace I'd come very often, even if I was local. The service, as I mentioned, could use some work; it is simply not acceptable to make anyone wait 20 minutes to order a drink, and it is especially inappropriate at an upscale restaurant such as this one. As attentive as they were once that mistake was fixed, it was an uncomfortable start to the evening and did detract a bit from our experience.

The green salad was far too simple--greens and shaved root veggies under an ultra light, almost non-existent, vinaigrette. The Brussels sprouts were tasty but far too sweet for our taste. The cedar planked salmon was good but a little oily and lacking something. A highlight was the corn cake, which tasted of fresh, sweet corn bread. I also thought the steak tartare, with its rich and complex flavors, was pretty amazing, but my partner was turned off by the pulverized raw meat texture of the dish.

The name of the restaurant sounds like Japanese though. The environment inside and interior design are quite comfortable. Their menu is very well designed that the drinks and food menus are separated with two dividers.

The menus have pictures too, so you can visualize the dishes before you get to eat the food. \\n\\nFood:\\nThe three dishes that I tried were Taiwanese stirred fried noodles (their popular dish), deep fried prawns with pineapples and mayo sauce and deep fried spicy chicken cutlets. All of them were very good! Once I smelled and tasted the food, I wanted to keep eating!!! However, the downside was that I was very thirsty after the meal. \\n\\nService: \\nIt is an Asian restaurant, so I wouldn't expect the service would be fantastic like the western ones. It is fine as long as the restaurant places an order correctly, the food comes out quickly and the waitresses or waiters would ask if I need some water or tea or check if I need anything else. That's good enough in any Asian restaurants. \\n\\nPricing: \\nReasonable and acceptable.  It is good to share the food with friends, so the average amount per person is not expensive. \\n\\nNote: the restaurant is located on Alexandra Road in Richmond. The street is always busy.

I had a tab going and ordered a round, then went back for a second.  When I went to close out, I couldn't find the person who had been helping us, so I just grabbed someone to get my card back.  As I was reading through the tab, my server came running over to tell me she couldn't find my tab to put in the last round (20 minutes prior?).  One of the beers from the second round was not on there, which led to a back and forth of how many drinks I had ordered, and I didn't feel like she believed me.  Maybe another server put the beer on my tab?  Either way, It was tough to be made to feel like this was my mistake and I was not truthful about how many beers I had.

Valet was available for $5, which we opted for because it seemed somewhat difficult to find parking in the residential area surrounding the restaurant. \\n\\nSetting: We opted to sit outside since I had seen pictures of the patio but the photos did not do it justice. Very beautiful outdoor area with endless plants, small fountains and candle-lit tables in the evenings. However, due to the fact that there were swarms of mosquitos surrounding us, I doubt I will ever eat in their patio again. The indoor seating is dimly lit but still nice enough to be a good alternative. Plenty of seating was available both inside and out at around 7:00pm on a Monday.\\n\\nFood: We ordered the patatas bravas and arugula salad as starter tapas. The patatas was underwhelming, not very authentic and definitely not worthy of $8.00. The arugula salad was very good. For our entrees, we ordered the lamb chops (special of the day), and the scallop dish. The lamb chops were tasty but not overly impressive, and the scallop dish was superb, one of the best I've ever had. \\n\\nService: Friendly and quick, though there was a slight delay for the tapas dishes to come out. \\nThough it was noted in the reservation that it was a birthday celebration, besides the menu presented with \\"Happy Birthday\\" written on it, no desserts or any celebratory dish was offered which was quite disappointing for such a high-end restaurant. \\n\\nSummary: There's some room for development, such as improving the presentation and sophistication of their tapas dishes to better reflect their prices, but the scallop dish was so good that I can see myself coming back just for that.

Everything about this restaurant has been thoroughly and earnestly considered and it's hard to leave without feeling like you're in on a secret.\\n\\nWhat's thoughtful?\\n\\n*  The food.  \\"80% locally sourced\\" and what isn't is worth the cost (monetary and environmental) involved.  Each plate is individually crafted and leaves a very distinct impression.  A wheat pasta dish with a distinctive hint of citrus and celery?  Check.  A duck filet plate tethered to a cornmeal pancake by means of perfectly prepared lentils?  Check.  A creme-based dessert that is possibly the most memorably original and delicious fusion of vanilla and citrus I've ever had?  Check.\\n\\n*  The ambiance.  Bondir exudes warmth and comfort.  A roaring fireplace keeps it plenty warm, and the gently ramshackle bar area is surprisingly inviting.  Sitting on refurnished pews and under soft-but-adequate light is pleasantly comfortable.\\n\\n*  The service.  Warm and enthusiastic, from the host through to the chef.  They're rightfully excited about the food coming out of this kitchen and they're happy to share it with others.  And they have an almost innate sense of timing; all dishes were cleared promptly and appropriately, no wine glass was left untopped-off.\\n\\n*  The price.  It's one thing to charge a reasonable fee for well-prepared food.  It's quite another to do so while also striving for sustainability.  This place works hard for the latter, and doesn't disappoint.  I've not seen ordinary parsnips put to more extraordinary ends as I have at Bondir.  And to split the cost of each and every entree in half, so as to make it accessible to people as an appetizer portion?  Obvious but very much appreciated.\\n\\n*  The drinks.  Well conceived, for both beer and wine.  Some well-known labels in there but some others were new to us...  and yet superb.  More restaurants should spend as much time thinking through wine--and beer!--pairings like Bondir.\\n\\nDoes Bondir deliver the periodic misfire?  Sure.  My veal dish was less than scintillating.  Yet for a place so small, so genuine and so good, it only resonated as inferior on the basis of the abundant awesomeness on display in everything else.  For the time being, Bondir is unknown, which won't last forever.

Never in my life have I bitten into a sandwich that was actually disgusting and made me want to hurl--until I visited this place. A classmate told me about the crazy cheap pricing compared to all other food spots in downtown, so I went to check it out. Got a grilled pork sandwich. The baguette was stale and had such a small slit in it that you could only fit like 2cm of actual sandwich material inside, making a bread:inside ratio a sad 90:10. After I battled through a couple rough bites of stale bread, I finally reached the actual sandwich I was looking for. I took a good bite and it seriously felt like I had just chomped down on live squid: the \\"pork\\" was a gross shiny red and spirally and DID NOT TASTE OR LOOK OR FEEL like any cut of pork--and I know my meats. I don't get grossed out easily but this sandwich was actually a true horrific nightmare. The whole thing went in the trash where it belongs. \\nI also asked for a veggie bun and what was inside was definitely meat, but even that was so surprisingly gross that it made me feel like crap after one bite.

I came in after the exact amount of time they quoted me, paid cash and drove the 5 minutes home.\\nWhen we opened the food we were severely disappointed with what we got for the price. Everything was cold and not fresh. Our mozzarella sticks were already completely congealed and inedible and the sliders, potato skins and wings were room temp at best, still very unpleasant.\\nThe only thing that makes sense to me given that I arrived on time to get my order and I live so close is that all the food sits in warming drawers and then is thrown together similar to McDonald's. To be honest I have actually had better burgers at McD's than the sliders we were served so I can't say that the food quality here is anything above a crappy fast food chain with a drive thru.\\nAnd the most horrifying of all was the disgusting cold, fake cheese sauce on the potato skins. I could barely look at them. What kind of person puts that on their food in lieu of actual cheese? I think it's safe to say the only people that would enjoy the food here know absolutely nothing about real food. I'm still horrified just thinking about what lackluster effort and neglect it would take to put food like that out of your kitchen. Why even bother having a menu if you don't care about the product?\\nNot to mention they had completely neglected to pack our two desserts. I don't normally complain but I was so annoyed at this experience, not to mention the astronomical price given the quality, that I called and spoke to the manager. I will say the whole staff handled the situation properly and agreed to give me all of my money back so one star for that and the fact that, from what I've seen of the place it does seem like a cool spot to get drinks and hang out if you're a sports fan.

I haven't been to the food cart in New York, so if you're looking for a comparison, don't look at me. I bear no shame in visiting this place alone because when I crave lamb over rice, there is nothing that can come between me and that tin foil box. \\n\\nThis brick and mortar location is simple, straightforward, and a bit small. It's difficult to get seating for a large group if it's busy and I've seen many people order to-go. I've gotten it to-go and eaten in the restaurant before. Every time, the food is solid and you can't really distinguish between eating it there or in your home. \\n\\nI usually order the lamb over rice, but when I'm feeling adventurous, I get the lamb/chicken over rice. For me, I stick to the basics at this place because it's what has remained the most consistent. Simply put, I expect bold and big flavors when order anything over rice at Halal Guys. \\n\\n- The lamb is nicely roasted and each succulent morsel is lightly grilled before being placed onto a big bed of rice. I love the drier texture of basmati rice and I think it works really well with the juicy meat and creamy sauces.\\n- The sauces are amazing. I don't know what kind of mixture of sauce it is (maybe mayo and vinegar?), but it is so addicting! I always ask for extra white sauce because it really enhances the flavor of everything else in the dish and keeps the rice from tasting too dry. The red sauce is spicy, so beware if you can't handle the heat. However, I think the red sauce is necessary because it adds a bit of a kick to the dish.\\n\\nI go back all the time, so I'm going to have to try other things on the menu eventually.

When she did finally seat us, she handed out the menus and left without saying much. Our server was definitely less helpful than the hostess, and he acted annoyed by our questions. \\n\\nWe went with the Baby Back Ribs (for three of us) and a Grilled/Pulled Chicken Dish. The food took ages to come out, and the staff only brought three of the items out. We had to ask our server and a manager at least two times to receive the other dish. Also, we received the wrong side on one of the orders, and the waiter insisted we had told him we wanted the wrong item....\\n\\nOverall meat quality was disappointing at best. However, the fries and collared greens were somewhat tasty, and I did experience a \\"BBQ dive moment\\".

When I went back to the stand promptly at the desired time it was already there.\\n\\nThe most bizarre thing was that it appears to be acceptable here for the wait staff to try drinks from the bar before they deliver them.  I watched two waitresses sample a number of drinks by putting a clean straw into a drink and use their finger to hold the liquid in the straw while they transferred it to their mouth.  I'm definitely glad my drink wasn't one of them or I would have asked for a fresh one.

Nic Patrizi uses family recipes and some of his own additions/twists to create simple yet flavorful Italian food out of his trailer. They make their own ricotta, sauces, dressings and the pastas are made to order.\\n\\nHere are a few things to know before you go. It is located inside the courtyard of the Butterfly Bar/Vortex. You can buy a bottle of wine or other beverages inside the Butterfly Bar. When you order from a food truck dishes do not always come out all at once, especially when the food is made to order. Treat it like sushi, eat it as it comes out and while it is fresh. There is ample covered seating and fans outside but you are able to take your food inside the bar if you'd like. \\n\\nMy first experience with Patrizi's was at a pre opening tasting. I enjoyed the experience enough that I have been back twice. The most recent visit Keri B arranged for a group of Yelpers to meet up and experience some of this Italian deliciousness. I ordered a 1/2 portion of the Carbonara Alexandra. I like that the menu includes 1/2 portions with the option to add on a soup or salad. The Carbonara came out with a gorgeous coddled egg, perfectly cooked pieces of bacon and lemon zest. The creamy yolk thoroughly coated the 1/2 portion of pasta. I didn't really get much cream or lemon zest flavors from this dish but with that said I loved how it tasted. I also ordered the blanched green beans off the \\"bar menu\\". This was a nice light side of green beans with lemon zest and cheese.\\n\\nThe second visit Patrizi's was launching their bar menu offering lighter bites and served extended hours of the evening. I get the impression the bar menu will change based on what  seasonal produce is available.  Jesse ordered the Wop burger and I ordered both the polenta cakes and bruschetta. The \\"burger\\" had the same meatballs I tried before so the sandwich was a hit. I tried one savory and one sweet polenta cake. The sweet had slices of sweet peaches and drizzled honey while the savory was topped off with the creamy and fluffy ricotta. The bruschetta had their house made giardiniera.\\n\\nThe first visit was the pre opening tasting. Nic served his Cacio E Pepe, Pomodoro with Ricotta, and Patrizi's Red Sauce with Meatballs. This was the first time I had Cacio E Pepe and now am a huge fan of this dish. It is a simple pasta dish with Grana Padano cheese, Pecorino cheese, black pepper and olive oil. My favorite is the Pomodoro with the fluffy house made ricotta cheese. This dish has a touch of garlic confit giving a hint of sweet with bit of lemon zest for some citrus flavor. The meatballs are 75/25, served juicy, hungryman sized and go well with red sauce. You can add the ricotta onto any dish and it goes well with both the pomodoro and the Patrizi's red sauce.\\n\\nSoon they will be adding small plates to the menu. Several of the entrees and bar menu items are vegetarian."},{"name":"Lodge at Cascade Brewing","address":"7424 SW Beaverton Hillsdale Hwy","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"Seems like a really nice place had a huge selection of sour beers on the menu and a pretty cool atmosphere except I really don't like having to sit at an empty bar and wait 15 minutes until someone even looks at me and then doesn't ask what I want and walks by me I would love to try this place again but I don't think I'll ever step foot in there, I don't appreciate feeling like people don't want to give me customer service cuz I don't look a certain way."},{"name":"Margarita Factory - Downtown Vancouver","address":"1004 Washington St","city":"Vancouver","stars":"3.5","text":"While the food was satisfactory, happy hour margarita was fine, my issue with this place would be it's accessibility.

With that said, I literally took the last spot in the parking lot.\\n\\nThe interior decor is somewhat high-class, with wooden accents.\\n\\nItems are pretty pricey.  Pretty shocking, considering restaurants are a dime a dozen here.  But you get 20% off before 1100, or something like that.  But items here are $4.50 here on average!?  Even with the discount, several places in East Van are a MUCH better deal.\\n\\nNow if the food were what I call \\"$4.50 good\\", then sure, maybe a few extra bucks would cut it.  Unfortunately, this is definitely not the case.  The food was mushy, and not that fresh in general.\\n\\nMany people complain about the wrong items showing up, but this didn't happen to us.

Because it is so popular, it was hard to find a table and I basically almost got into an argument with a guy waiting for one. Apparently he was hovering over a couple that was eating and waiting to take their table but he was standing so closely to them and actually facing them the entire time, I thought he was part of their party. When the couple got up to leave, he coincidentally walked away too. Naturally, I ran over to the table to claim it and he walked back over with MAJOR attitude saying that he had been waiting for the table. Well, how was I supposed to know that? So I gave him attitude back but conceded in giving in as just then I saw another couple get up from the back area and we were able to snag those instead. Luckily the food made up for that experience. We got a bowl of chowder and the lobster salad. Both were large enough to share. This bowl of chowder was pretty good. We just had a bowl of chowder from Union Oyster House earlier that day and this one was thinner but had a good flavor and lots of pieces of clams, albeit they were smaller chunks. The salad was fresh and also refreshing and I loved the presentation of a split lobster tail down the middle. It was perfectly cooked and chilled and the meat tore off easily from the shell. The food was good yes, but I'm not sure I would come again just based on the line we had to wait in and the fighting for the table. If I did, I'd prolly just call it in and get it to go.

Cuatros has a big patio, it's great for groups, you can watch all the soccer you want there.  The food is terrible, and I am consistently disappointed with the service.\\n\\nLast time I went, we waited two seconds to get our table, and about an hour and fifteen minutes for the waitress to take our order.  I understand that we were a big group, but if you want to provide service to big groups, hire a bigger wait staff!  Service that slow really takes away from the dining experience.  It's hard to enjoy your food when you're angry about the slow service.  \\n\\nWhat upsets me most is the included gratuity.  If you're going to hire an insufficient wait staff for your giant restaurant, it's really unfair to demand a tip like that.  We were a large group, and our check was not split up (I think waiters and waitresses who can't/don't do this are dumb and lazy).  Evidently we shorted the waitress about $12 on a few hundred dollar tab, which always seems to happen even if everyone swears that they paid in full.  She came out and told us that we shorted her!  Take the hit!  You were a terrible waitress.  You don't deserve a tip that high, so when we accidentally come up short, have some pride and class, and go home with $12 dollars less that night, instead of whining to the table about it.\\n\\nAt least one of their waitresses is a whiny baby who is in over her head in the restaurant business.

I happen to like horse radish and I still had a hard time with the potatoes.  The creme brulee I had for dessert was pretty good.  Overall for what we got I felt like the pricing was nice.  I've been charged a lot more in comparable places so I felt like they were pretty reasonable and I also thought our service was good as well.  Our waitress was helpful and did a good job of explaining things.  The only reason I gave 4 stars and not 5 is because I didn't care for the seating we had.  It was just two of us and we were stuck with a tiny table barely big enough for our plates and glasses and crammed between two other larger tables so that any time one of those tables had service we got a nice up close and personal view of the waiter or waitresses butt in our faces.  Personally, I am not one that enjoys the whole stranger butt in the face thing..I could get a $5 t-bone at a strip club if I wanted that.

The mussels were delicious, and the peanut curry preparation was quite unique.  Our bartender gave us a couple pieces of warm bread, which they should give everyone (if not, ask for it), to soak up a little more of the broth.\\n\\nThe tuna appetizer (different than the one on the website menu) was AMAZING.  It was only one piece of bruschetta, topped with a cilantro/avocado spread and mounded with delicious marble size pieces of tuna.  $17 for such a small portion would have seemed too high if this hadn't been one of the best bites I've ever had.\\n\\nOverall the dozen oysters, 2 apps, and 4 beers was $100 before gratuity.  Pretty steep, especially as we realized on our way out that we definitely could have made room for a famous lobster rolls or the seared scallops.

The menu is too big and there are hardly any dishes (pasta, pizza, entrees) that you would find on a decent restaurant's menu. More on that later.\\n\\nI had the Caprese Salad ($7), the most authentic item on the menu except for the overly sweet balsamic vinegar, something you would NEVER see on Caprese in Italy or any respectable stateside Italian joint. Otherwise, it was nicely presented and the price fair. My wife had a house (side) salad that was fresh, yet unremarkable, and overpriced by at least a buck.\\n\\nA native of the birthplace of pizza, Naples (Napoli), she ordered the Four Cheese (Quattro Formaggi - $10) pizza without tomato sauce (there should not be any tomato on this pizza in the first place). The pizza looked good, except for the cheddar cheese (cheddar on a pizza?), but the taste was extremely bland, no detectable seasoning whatsoever.\\n\\nI had the \\"Chicken Prosciutto Scalopine\\" ($18 - \\"scaloppine\\" has two \\"p\\"s BTW) in a pretty good Marsala sauce. Unfortunately, the dish was a mish-mash of spaghetti and veggies (tomato, broccoli, carrots, zucchini) topped with chicken breasts, prosciutto and cheese, then broiled. The chicken topped with prosciutto (no cheese) in a Marsala sauce and a side of pasta, for example, along with a dinner salad would be a simple, authentic dish and a fair value at $18.\\n\\nThe place is simple and the decor somewhat dated, the service attentive and friendly. If it were my place and I wanted to succeed, here are some things I would consider:\\n\\n1. Scale down the menu considerably\\n2. KISS ... Keep It Simple Stronzo - simple, fresh ingredients and \\"traditional\\" recipes\\n3. Dinner salads should be included with entrees or a $2 to $2.50 add-on at most, not $4\\n4. Loose the cheddar - it does not belong on anything claiming to be Italian\\n5. Update the dining room - it is tacky, not \\"romantic\\"\\n\\nThere are a shitload of Mexican, Chinese, Thai, Vietnamese and Pub-style restaurants in the Tigard area, but not a single decent Italian restaurant within 10 miles. People LOVE Italian food, hence its Top-3 status among Americans, so a restaurant that could do Italian right, not quirky, would likely thrive in this area. We were there at 7:30 on a Saturday night and there were just three other parties in the restaurant. How this place has survived since 1991 is beyond me, particularly considering their prime location in downtown Tigard.\\n\\nFYI - My critiques are meant to inform readers based on my experience and perception as well as provide business owners with honest, constructive feedback, not slam them unnecessarily. I want businesses to succeed, not fail, so my comments are provided with no ill will.

I think this is going to be one of my new favorite spots! \\n\\nWhen you walk through the doors, you're going to start drooling from the aromatic smells coming from the open kitchen and tasty dishes being cooked. I loved the unique and impressive menu. Our attentive and very friendly server greeted us with a genuine smile and I knew I was going to like this place. \\n\\nI had the Korean Fried Chicken served over rice with house-made kimchi, pickled cucumbers, and eggs two ways (sunny-side up and diced boiled egg). I had requested that my one egg be cooked over easy as I find sunny-side up eggs too raw and slimy for me. Although my dish came with the egg cooked sunny-side up, I didn't want to bother the kitchen with re-cooking my eggs or making me another one since I was quite hungry and my food looked so scrumptious that I didn't mind a little slimy egg! The fried chicken was very crispy and coated with a sweet sauce (almost like what you find in peking pork or general tso chicken). This crispy sweetness of the chicken with the pickled cucumbers, house-made kimchi, and egg yolk was a perfect combination--sweet, tangy, and spicy! The kimchi was apparently fresh and one of the better ones I've had, including those I've had at other Korean restaurants here and in Seoul, Korea! If you're looking for a filling dish without eating too much, this is it! The portion was perfect but at the same time, too much for me!\\n\\nMy friend had the Alder Burger served with a side of fries. The burger was worth every penny of the $11 price. The meat was cooked perfectly at \\"medium\\" so it was nice and pink and quite moist. The two thick slices of bacon and cheese dripping on the side of the burger was mouth-watering! My friend really enjoyed his burger. We decided we need to (and will) come back here again for dinner. \\n\\nThe server was very thoughtful and gave us a complimentary order of their Chocolate Potato Doughnut with Creme Anglaise as an apology for my egg not being cooked to my order. I was surprised at this kind gesture as they had already offered to have my egg made the way I had requested and I declined since I didn't want such a minor oversight to be any trouble. The doughnut wasn't too sweet and went really well with the creme anglaise sauce so was quite a treat. \\n\\nBased on the service, atmosphere, and food I've had today, I would definitely recommend this place if you're looking for satisfaction with a smile. We will definitely be coming back here again and I can't wait to try their dinner menu!"},{"name":"Aztec Willie's Taqueria","address":"1501 NE Broadway St","city":"Portland","stars":"3","text":"I dig this place.

The classroom itself was completely out of the way from my other classes; way out in the Unitus building on 4th avenue. After that class, I would always walk past Alexandria and I always had trouble not grabbing a bite before my next class started.\\n\\nI had that Portuguese class 2 days a week for 3 years straight, so I ate here a lot. It wasn't just out of convenience either. It's because the food is absolutely phenomenal and the owner, Hassan, is one of the most kind and generous people I've ever met.\\n\\nI've probably had every thing on their menu, but I keep going back to their veggie meza platter. For $8, you get hummus, stuffed grape leaves, baba ghanoush, tabouli, 2 pieces of falafel and pita bread. While the portions aren't absolutely gargantuan, they're very satisfying. The hummus has that perfect combination of chickpeas and tahini with a slight lemony twang. The baba ghanoush is very flavorful and not horribly acidic like most of them are. And the grape leaves are firm and delicious.\\n\\nThis brings me to the falafel, which in my opinion is the best thing they make. I'm a huge fan of falafel, but unfortunately almost every other Mediterranean restaurant seems to screw it up and make it too dry. With that said, Alexandria makes the most perfect falafel I have ever experienced. It's crispy but not too greasy on the outside, and perfectly moist and soft (like a mashed potato) on the inside. I seriously have dreams about their falafel and find myself in a pool of my own saliva after I wake up.\\n\\nI went in here today for the first time since graduating, and it was nice to see that Hassan remembered me right away. The menu hasn't changed at all and neither has the quality of the food or service. Now that I started working out at the university's recreation center, I'll probably be making this my regular post-workout meal."},{"name":"101 Beer Kitchen","address":"817 Polaris Pkwy","city":"Westerville","stars":"4.5","text":"Love having a non-chain restaurant on Polaris, but beyond happy hour this place it just okay.

After finally eating there last night, the only thing I'm sad about are those three wasted years. \\n\\nI had the special of the night--fennel three ways: first, fennel fronds were worked throughout the dough, which gave the pasta a lovely fresh herbs in spring taste (...I couldn't remember/figure out the second way...) the third, fennel bulb was pickled and placed on top, which was the perfect bright/tart/sweet foil for the noodles and homemade ricotta. That plus an order of the garlic bread, (which had whole roasted cloves that you can mash and spread to your liking) equaled perfection. Plates are brought out to the table by servers who not only remember you, rather than doling out numbers, but even check in to make sure you're enjoying your meal. \\n\\nThe seating areas wrap around the yard between Patrizi's and the Butterfly Bar, and range from a wooden porch to lawn or to little tucked away squares with trees and shrubbery.

My friend got the Crawfish Etouffee and I got the Jambalaya. They were good, but my friend made the comment that the food could have come from a frozen-dinner without us noticing. I'm always a bit turned off from restaurant food that I feel like I could have made just as easily at home, and the food definitely fit that description. INothing to rave about, especially as it was a bit pricy for the portions (my friend who I swear has the smallest stomach in the world actually finished her entire plate, which has never happened before while eating out).\\n\\nWe ordered the beignets, because this IS called the Beignet Connection. They were good, but it's kind of what you expect when you order fried dough with powdered sugar.

The first time was on a weekend so it was crowded and we waited outside in the Portland cold. The 2nd time was during the week so there was really no line. You bus your own tables and get your own water which is fine. I think the tables are cleaner this way because your fellow patrons don't want to leave a mess for the next diners. \\n\\nWe ordered 2 Reggie Deluxes (1 with sausage gravy and 1 with mushroom gravy), a ham hash up, shrimp and grits, and a biscuit with fruit and whipped cream.\\n\\nBiscuit with fruit and whip--They only do seasonal fruit (yay!) so this one came with pears. The pears were too spicy for my liking, but everyone did enjoy the biscuit. Didn't order this during our 2nd visit.\\n\\nReggie Deluxe--What's not to love about bacon, fried chicken, cheese, egg and gravy? I knew what to expect but the look on my nephew's face was picture worthy. He absolutely loved it. He was even bold enough to try it with a sunny side up egg. They only do the eggs 2 ways --over hard or sunny side up. We ordered this during our 2nd visit. Both gravies were delish, but I liked the mushroom gravy better. Because I got my gravy on the side, I was able to pick up my sandwich. If you opt for gravy on your sandwich get yourself a knife and fork when you are getting your water.\\n\\nHam Hash up--My brother liked his dish. He said it was salty and he loves salt so for him to say that, it must have been pretty salty. The flavor was good, but he didn't order the same thing on his return trip.\\n\\nShrimp and Grits--No one in my party eats grits. We are quasi- Southern since we are from Maryland so whenever people hear that we don't like grits they believe it is because we haven't had them prepared right. No--that's not the case. We just don't get the seedy texture. So what prompted me to order the S & G? Well, I had a sample of this dish at a wedding a few years ago and couldn't believe that i was eating grits. Needless to say, the plate comes to the table with ~8 big shrimp, bacon, green onions, garlic and mushrooms and we tear in. Jesus Be A White Picket Fence!!!! This ish was good. They must saut√© the veggies or shrimp in some sort of wine because the taste of it is still there. We literally licked the plate clean. We ordered this again on our 2nd is it.\\n\\nPine State Biscuits concept is pretty cool. There is no fancy schmancy stuff going on here. The great food we ate here can probably be duplicated at home.

Popular spots simply have lines so that's just part of the deal. The food is indeed \\"grubbin'\\". The Reggie comes out looking just like the pictures, full of gravy, messy, and darn good at curing the common hangover. This sandwich is good. Fried chicken is seasoned nicely, moist and tasty. Gravy is scratch made and it shows. Biscuit is a good, solid biscuit and how can you lose with quality bacon? Together though, it's just a little.... too much. It really is a decent fried chicken and it get lost in the mess. In fact it all gets lost in the mess of it all. Some other items like the McIsley (fried chicken sandwich with pickle, honey, mustard) is off balanced with the sharpness. Corn dog is well executed, but the andouille is again \\"too much\\" for a stand alone item. That said, while I'd like more restraint everything is good, honest, tasty food. Drinks has some basic soft drinks, Stumptown coffee, bottled and draft beers, as well as cocktails. Everything is there depending on the time of day you visit.\\n\\nAtmosphere is diner-esque. Comfortable seating and volume is plenty quiet for conversation. It's an eat and run place, no need to hang out and savor the last of your coffee. Much of this is the need to free your table for new diners. The ordering system is cafeteria style; place your order at the counter, grab your liquids and try to find a spot to rest your order number. Staff was very friendly and accommodating particularly the food runners. It's also bus your own table; honestly this never bothers me and makes tables more readily available for the next diner. \\n\\nThe bottom line, with a place that touts southern fare, I wanted an out of this world biscuit, exceptional fried chicken, and plate licking gravy. It's solid tasty food, but there's not a whole lot of wow factor or finesse here. I'll continue to come here as it really is a decent meal, but I not go out of my way nor go when the line is excessive.\\n\\nI'd like to add that the value here is great.

We ordered some fatty fried chicken and the egg bread pudding. The bread pudding was really good but probably not so good for me. The \\"Korean\\" fried chicken was just ok.

We also liked our server's recommendations for entrees - my friend got the North Georgia Trout with an almond brown butter sauce that tasted heavenly, really! It came with smoked potatoes sprinkled with sea salt - it's amazing how smoke can really make a boring vegetable exciting! The potatoes were that good! My \\"Wild Georgia Shrimp & Grits\\" was very good, too - it was almost like a stew, a little on the heavy side (compared to the trout), & spicy (a nice surprise). Loved the strong flavors. Great choice for visiting friends who want a taste of the South. Both dishes were $12.

My wife wanted a gin martini, and would usually order Tanqueray, but it is not available here.  So she asked the bartender about the American gins, which were unfamiliar to us.  Unfortunately, the bartender had no information.  I am a bourbon fan, but did not recognize any of the selections, so just took a stab.  Mine turned out fine, but the martini was not good.  It would definitely help to have some descriptions of the liquors, given that they are not well known brands, or at least have knowledgeable staff behind the bar who can offer some guidance.  They do have a very large selection of beers.\\n\\nThe menu is mostly pub fare -- a lot of burgers and sandwiches -- but only a few entrees.   Nothing too appealing.

Usually I do not eat seafood on Monday as it is often leftovers from weekend. However, my friends really wanted to go. We had a 1/2 dozen of the charbroiled oysters, the honey butter croissants appetizer & the peel & eat shrimp. The shrimp were ok. The croissants were good, but not something I would reorder. The oysters however, they were very good. I love raw oysters, but these were broiled in garlic butter and had Romano cheese on top that crusted slightly that made me want more. My buddy liked them so much that he had another 1/2 dozen for lunch w just a side salad. His wife started out w the Key Lime pie. Looked very good. She then ordered the Reuben which was large even for NY standards. She had a side of fries. She was so full after the apps & pie she took the sandwich to go. I had a Caesar salad w tomatoes. Just the right amount of tang & dressing. Then had the blackened Sea Bass which was the daily fresh fish. Just the right amount of blackening seasoning that didn't overpower the meal. The fish was cooked perfectly. Had the green beans as a side. They were cooked w bacon which I didn't really want. Added too much fat for my meal after the rich apps. However, I like green beans that are still slightly crunchy so that balanced some of my disdain for this dish. There is not a wide variety of side dishes which I thought was odd for an upscale restaurant. Overall, the wait staff was only a 3.5. Not very helpful on menu.

We were recently back coincidentally during the food and wine festival in Epcot with her sister and family and we ended up having lunch at Rose & Crown.  \\n\\nWhat I like about all the restaurants and showcases in Epcot is that they employ people from those countries for each venue.  It does give it a bit more authenticity and allows each place to showcase the diversity of their countries they represent.  Of course food and drink is always a big part of that culture.\\n\\nFor the United Kingdom the Rose & Crown is essentially your British pub and fare.  It's a pub and while it was rather hot the day we were there the bar area was absolutely packed.  I suppose it's a combination of people wanted to get a break from the heat and take in some AC as well as get a pint or two or three.  We had walked up where the check in for the dining room was (yes it was outside on the east side of the building).  We had asked for a table for 6.  I had attempted to make a booking with the Disney app like I did last year for the German buffet but for whatever reason it wasn't going through this time.

I was hoping that the apparent overpricing would be reflected in the quality of the food, but this wasn't the case.\\n\\nThe pizza was clearly made from all-purpose flour and cooked at a wrong temperature.  It was bright white with little to no oven marks, and was so incredibly brittle to the touch that I can't shake the fact that I've made better pies in a home oven, which only maxes out at 550 degrees.  To their credit, the dough was hand made, clearly, but the lack of concern for the ingredients flies in the face of their advertising.  For the price, this was an utter failure.\\n\\nThe wings had potential - finally a place that doesn't bread buffalo wings - but they were sauceless.  As clueless as this place seems to be about a good pizza dough, their lack of knowledge is only matched by an ignorance of buffalo sauce.  (Tip to the user: buffalo sauce is not hot sauce dripped into a puddle of fryer grease.)  Why they can't get the basics right is beyond me, and why they charge a premium for it is all too disconcerting.\\n\\nOverall, another \\"bummer\\" experience for regional pizza and wings.  A dough should never shatter into a hundred pieces when you lift up a slice.  Don't let them fool you for a second that this is what real Neapolitan pizza is.

Although I probably could have done without the egg, I still enjoyed its presence.\\n\\nHashups - A super hearty delicious breakfast meal!  The hash featured a pretty good sized plate of potatoes that were cooked to a nice golden crisp.  But it doesn't end there.  You also get a wonderful medley of steak, sweet onions, mushrooms, and cheese that complemented nicely with the hash. Definitely a good option to share but may be hard to because it is pretty darn good.\\n\\nThere is plenty of parking on the street.  The people at the counter were pretty fast and efficient.  Again I would encourage people to come early to beat the breakfast crowd especially if you are planning to sit down somewhere good.\\n\\nOverall, I would say that if you are looking for a breakfast that will fill you up and taste pretty good too, Pine State Biscuits is a great option."},{"name":"Neptune Oyster","address":"63 Salem St","city":"Boston","stars":"4.5","text":"Best lobster roll I've ever had.  Two versions offered - traditional chilled with mayo and a warm, buttered version (no mayo).  I recommend the latter.  Oysters are great as well. \\n\\nThis place is small and fills FAST so plan ahead.  Go early and get your name on the list, then go have a drink or two at one of the neighboring pubs/restaurants.  They will call you when your spot opens up.  Could be an hour and a half wait or longer but totally worth it.  \\n\\nAlso, wine and beer only."},{"name":"Pizza Mia","address":"915 N Anchor Way","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"Love this placefood is awesome and manager Michele and staff Samantha rock. Best margaritas ever but tad pricey. Definitely worth checking out if you've never been here"},{"name":"Maki Maki","address":"304 Western Ave","city":"Brighton","stars":"3","text":"Maybe buffets are just not for me but I didn't find this place worth the price at all. It is very simliar to Minado's in Natick except they have a chocolate fondue here and a heavier focus on chinese dishes. The sushi sits out for a while so it wasn't very fresh except maybe the salmon sashimi. The hot food station wasn't very good either. The ice cream was super creamy and didn't really taste like the flavors labeled. I probably won't be going back!"},{"name":"Pizza Lovers","address":"61 Essex St","city":"Lynn","stars":"2.5","text":"Been coming here for years never a bad experience.

The only thing I didn't like about it was that my dinner was so small of a portion that I was still really hungry. I had gotten NY Strip Steak that came with roasted potatoes. I was honestly disappointed in the meal I had gotten.

Marsala maybe.... and the chicken tasted very processed and not fresh at all. .. honestly i was so disappointed i didnt even look into deserts.\\n\\nhonestly i will probably never go back. it was extremely disappointing."},{"name":"KarbonStar Vitality Vegan Cafe & Juice Bar","address":"1542 Ralph David Abernathy Blvd","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"So as a vegan traveler, I often times find it difficult to get great vegan food but when in Atlanta I will always stop here from now on.

The added bonus is if you are alkaline vegan they follow Sebi guidelines."},{"name":"Monica's Mercato","address":"130 Salem St","city":"Boston","stars":"4.5","text":"I have a love hate relationship with this place. Their homemade pasta and sandwiches are delicious but they are SO SLOW. The lines here at night get long and if you are 5 deep for a sandwich order, it will feel like an eternity. The rest of the deli selection is just so so. I like the grilled vegetables but i often find a lot of the food is overcooked and has too much oil. The homemade pasta sauce is quite bland and very mild but again, the pasta is delicious and only take 3 minutes to cook in boiling water so it's a very fast meal."},{"name":"One Taco","address":"520 W 6th St","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"This is my sister's favorite Taco truck in Austin.
