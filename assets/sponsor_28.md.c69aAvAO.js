I could tell that both were made by people who cared about making good food. \\n\\nFor hot pot, one cut of beef, one cut of lamb, quail eggs, spongy tofu, taro, mushrooms, shrimp paste, beef tendon, and some veggies. I enjoyed everything. I really appreciated that care was put into the presentation of the ingredients. The sliced meet was tasty, the beef tendons were flavorful and tender, the spicy Szechuan broth was nice. The quail eggs were great too. You get a ton of them for just a few bucks and hold up surprisingly well in boiling water. The experts at my table pointed out that they have had better shrimp paste at other locations, but it was alright to my naive palette. \\n\\nI am definitely hoping to come back.

It's near the end of the day, so there weren't many people in line. The two people ahead of me ordered at the two available registers, and when they moved on, I waited to to be called up. Neither cashier said anything, so I took a step closer, thinking they hadn't seen me. Nothing. One of them started counting out his drawer and then took off. That's fine, his shift was over. By then I was standing at the counter saying \\"Excuse me?\\" to which the girl twiddled her thumbs and stared at the ceiling. I was about to walk out when she finally acknowledged me.\\n\\n3) Just two weeks ago, I decided to go back. It's after work is over, so busy but not crazy. The couple in front of me was debating what soups to get, so they asked the cashier if there was a soup & sandwich special. The cashier proceeded to start dancing with one of the other cashiers. Didn't pay attention at all to what was being asked of her. Finally she says to the guy \\"Oh, what? I didn't hear you\\". I appreciate that you can have fun with your coworkers, but COME  ON. \\n\\nSo nothing is WORST EXPERIENCE EVER material, but three consistently not-good experiences equal me not returning.

I suppose that there is street parking or utilize the parking deck nearby like we did for the convention.\\n\\nIt was really crowded as you could imagine during a convention and the place is pretty small but they did their best to keep a clear path to the podium. We put our names in and it was about an hour wait. The hostess suggested checking out North Market while we waited and that the would text us when the table was ready. Being familiar with NM we took her up on the offer and left out the back exit. It only took about 45 minutes to get a text. Under promise, over exceed. I like it.\\n\\nWe were sat and got drinks. I had the Rye IPA which was very good!  My buddy got a flight of beers that we sampled from but the Rye IPA was my favorite.

I ended up with a burger called the Angry Ogre which was just massive! Check out the photo I posted! At almost $15 I was glad.  It was 2 Angus patties, American cheese,  saut√©ed onions, saut√©ed mushrooms, bacon, lettuce and tomato.  It really hit the spot after walking around at the convention all day.  It also came with fries which were standard fare.  If they can make a burger this good on a busy day like this and as a special item, I'm certain their regular menu items are just as good or better.\\n\\nThe service was very good and friendly. Our waiter told us about all the beers and talked to us about the convention.  They do this every year for the event according to him.  Some staff were even dressed up. The food came out quickly and was hot. We didn't get our free pint glasses because they ran out but it was the third day of the convention. This place and decor remind me of a comfy English Pub. If I had one complaint, it's that the place is pretty small and you are in very close proximity to other patrons. Even the aisle is pretty slim.

The steak on the other hand...they make it so perfect. Whenever I ask for medium rare, it's done perfectly. It's never too bloody or too over cooked--just right.\\nThe French onion soup is to die for!! You MUST try it if it's your first time visiting. \\n\\nAlmost everyone raves about the Grey Stuff (served only at night). But if you want my two scents, it's overrated. The grey cream part was definitely very sweet and delicious but the brownie/cookie ruined it for me. It was as hard as a ROCK!

I needed to use two of my hands to force the fork down.\\n\\nInstead, try Lemon Meringue Cupcake or the Strawberry Cream Cheese Cupcake if you want something fruity and citrusy.

When it finally arrived three of our party fell deep into a permit butter and radish glazed coma. It would be another twenty five minutes until the next three meals arrived. Two were hot meals as cold as ice... They fucked up the tater tots (just let that sink in). Finally the last two meals arrived a salad and a grilled cheese (1 hour and fifteen minutes after ordering). The grilled cheese was two in toasted slices of bread with partially melted Brie cheese (with the rhine still on) and the tomato soup was actually Prego spaghetti sauce.

Wine was very reasonably priced, and the cauliflower soup was excellent. \\n\\nSince I don't eat meat, I have a hard time at a lot of restaurants. The vegetarian plate was excellent, though, and an added bonus was that it wasn't dairy-based like many vegetarian dishes. The dinner service was semi-Parisian, which we specifically wanted, so if you're looking to get in and out quickly, this might not be the place for you. \\n\\nOverall, one of my new favorite places to eat. I've lived in Austin for over 20 years, and so many of the places people frequent, particularly the newer ones, serve low-quality food at high prices.

The decor was extremely nice.  It was waaaaay bigger inside than what I thought it would be.\\n\\nMy gf and I ordered the hamachi tuna jalapeno appetizer, kalbi, enoki mushrooms, cold soba with duck dipping sauce and cold soba with pork/kimchi sauce.  The food came out in a reasonable amount of time and waters were filled immediately. \\n\\nThe hamachi appetizer was what you would expect it was.  Tasted really fresh and the ponzo sauce they had with it was very balanced.  The kalbi was literally one of the best tasting kalbi's I've had in Boston.  Enoki was very buttery tasting but it said it would be on the menu, if you're a fan of enoki mushrooms you'll like it.\\n\\nThe noodle dishes were superb.  Great texture on the soba noodles and the sauces were full flavored and the meats were tender and delicious.  The amount of noodles they give you hit the spot right on. If you get the cold soba noodles they bring out a little tiny tea pot full of hot water they boiled the soba noodles with.  You can then mix it with your dipping sauce to make a tiny little bowl of broth.  I actually really loved that touch.\\n\\nAll and all I would highly recommend this place.  I'm hesitate to give it 5 stars because I don't want this place getting crowded with you jerks.  The sushi people had at other tables looked amazing and I will return to try the hot soba dishes.

As many of my friends frequent this spot, and praise it, I was pretty stoked to finally check it out - but by the end of the night, it was one miss after the other.\\n\\nCame in for the Blazer game, got a seat near the screen so it was pretty alright. Was pleased that there was table service because I'm generally lazy.\\n\\nOrdering from the menu - I ordered a PBR tall boy but was told they have it on draught (which on the menu was 50cents more expensive), discovering it was happy hour via the menu, showed me the beer would be the same price. So maybe the server was doing me a favor without explicitly stating it.\\n\\nI ordered the BLT and it was pretty mediocre but still food. Eventually when the bar started to fill up it became nearly impossible to get service. Our tables had empty drinks for 20-30 minutes with every round, despite servers walking past our table multiple times. When the game was over I ran to the bathroom, away from my table for less than 3 minutes, and came back to find my full can of beer had been bussed off the table. It granted was only a $2 can of Rainier but come on - principle here, a least ask those sitting at the table if the owner of the beer was still here. \\n\\nAttempted to go to the bar to ask for a new can and was ignored for roughly ten minutes while others walking up to the bar after me were served. I gave up and went outside with friends to smoke. When walking right back into the bar with my group of friends with drinks I was carded which was just annoying at this point after all the other mishaps. When I alerted the doorman I had been here all night he told me he still need's to see my ID but turned to my friends who had drinks in their hands saying \\"well you have a drink in your hand so you can go in.\\" Not really an inconvenience but at this point I now hated this bar.\\n\\nFinally when we were able to get the bar tender to give us our checks - the beers that were $2 on the menu were charged as $2.50 to which the bar tender said \\"Oh our menus are wrong they shouldn't have been on the table\\" - again it's only 50 cents difference but COME ON, you're a bar, you have ONE job. Luckily he fixed it for us without any problems.\\n\\nI just all around felt like the staff and weird vibes at this bar ruined my experience here and I probably won't be back to give it another shot because it made me so legitimately uncomfortable.

My mom had quesadillas which she actually loved. I had the bbq chicken salad- DON'T DO IT, GUYS, and my husband had the chicken enchiladas. He didn't like the enchiladas...he said they were ok but the refried beans are apparently terrible. \\n\\nWe're from Texas and know our mexican food- this place over-seasons everything.

She would. She's dating him. You try to pick an expression that appropriately conveys a mixture of confusion and interest. \\"Huh?\\"\\n\\n\\"Like, there's a lot of ladies at ladies' night. You know, there's a lot of Pho places in the neighborhood?\\"\\n\\nIt's a laboured explanation, but he's not wrong; there *are* a lot of ladies - uh, you mean Pho places - in the neighborhood. There's one less than a block away, and there's another a few more blocks past that. You could probably sprint from one to the next in under a minute. You're probably never going to try doing that in real life though. That sounds exhausting.\\n\\nYou chew on Kurt's iffy simile as you thumb your way through the menu, noting a few appealing appetizers, a nice range of Vietnamese mains, and some enticing drink options. They have bubble tea - you squint hard at the little picture, trying to ascertain whether it's bubble *tea*, or bubble *smoothy*. You expect the latter.\\n\\n\\"Are you going to get the boba?\\" Casey asks, perceptively. She's known you for far too long.\\n\\nBetween the three of you, you manage to arrive at an acceptable variety of orders, a plate of tofu salad rolls to split, bubble 'tea' for you, thai iced tea for Casey, and Kurt claiming he's fine with 'just tea.'\\n\\nThe bubble tea does turn out to be a smoothy, but it's pretty standard fare for this kind of place. Casey's thai iced tea is about as sweet and orange as any girl could hope for. Kurt's 'just tea' is pretty good for being gratis. And then the salad rolls arrive. The three of you dig in, and the peanut sauce (which is, let's face it, at least half of the reason for ordering salad rolls - maybe more than half) is pretty peanutty, approaching peanut butter flavourwise. It's not your favorite, but you're not gonna kid yourself, even average peanut sauce is pretty effin' delicious. Kurt claims he doesn't really like peanut sauce, which earns him a skeptical-yet-tolerant look from you and another giggle from Casey.\\n\\nThe food is all fairly good - most notably, the Pho soup broth is a little on what some might consider the under-seasoned side, but you actually appreciate this immensely; other places will serve you soup that's good to go with no fiddling, despite the heap of fresh leafy herb things and sprouts that come with the bowl, and the tray of saucy things available to doctor it up. You snap stems and tear leaves, squirt something you hope is hoisin sauce, and decide to go for broke with a whole spoonful of that dangerous-looking chili oil stuff. It all comes together nicely, and before long you're slurping your way through the dregs of the broth at the bottom of the bowl.\\n\\nCasey gives her stir-fried egg noodles and veggies a thumbs-up (literally - you're in charge of taking the picture for instagram.) Kurt likes his own soup just fine - he lets you try one of his meatballs, and you try not to be too suggestive as you slurp it up. Everything seemed pretty okay; you've had better Vietnamese food in general, but this place seems like it's doing pretty well. And then, just when everyone is stuffed and sluggishly sipping on whatever is left of their drinks, the waitress pops up with complimentary desserts! It's some sort of sweet chilled rice pudding variant, nice and light, pretty nearly perfect as a finisher for a big meal.\\n\\nYou pay, thank your waitress, and wait outside together while Kurt takes a bathroom break. Casey nudges you.\\n\\n\\"So?\\"\\n\\nYou sigh, and make a balancing motion with your hands. \\"I mean, he doesn't like peanut sauce, but he's also cute, so...\\"\\n\\nSo yeah."},{"name":"Houndstooth Kitchen & Eatery","address":"160 Independence Ln, Ste A","city":"Maitland","stars":"4.5","text":"I have been here twice now and the food really hits the spot.

The crowd can be very mixed here, some nights they will have metal playing, others a DJ catering to a dance party, and they also always show Blazer games, which draws a rather loud and enthusiastic crowd.

And I am a *huge* pilsener fan. It's rich and up front, bitter, clean and aggressive, then dry and with a similarly clean finish...and with a bit of malt to it too! Awesome how they give it some malty body without sacrificing any of the pilsener's signature cleanliness.\\n\\nAnyway, my future mother-in-law ordered the lamb burger, which I tried - incredible! Good, fresh ground lamb is tough to keep around - it can quickly go too gamy to serve, but this burger was flavorful and rich, with a great feta spread. My regular burger was pretty damn outstanding as well, with an excellent bleu cheese spread and caramelized onion. They do their own patties so they can serve them rare if you want. Which I do. \\n\\nThe sweet potato fries are done right, soaked overnight to remove excess starch, then double-fried. Yum.  Salad was good but hey - it's salad. Blackened mahi mahi tacos are a great variation of the \\"fish taco\\" scene - three big portions of fresh, flavorful mahi mahi with all the trimmings you could want on fresh soft tortilla rounds. Simple, fresh and tasty as hell.\\n\\nI wish i'd tried some of their other beer offerings, but in the end their pilsener was just too good to pass up, and I had two more.

I first visited Jiko in 2002 while on a business trip in Orlando because I thought it would be different than the typical business travel restaurants. Wow, did I ever discover a gem. \\n\\nAfter my first visit I did a little research on Jiko and discovered that a big reason for this being such a special place was executive chef Annette Grecchi Gray. She was a hot ticket on the WDW property and moved to Jiko after receiving several accolades at Artist Point in Disney's Wilderness Lodge Resort. On my second visit the food was better than I remembered and chef Annette even visited my table and talked to us for a few minutes (that huge for a food geek like me). \\n\\nOn my last visit I learned that chef Annette had left Jiko to go work for Carlson Co's the parent company of TGI Fridays. I was fearful that the food wouldn't be as good but chef Anette's legacy carries on and I still think Jiko does it better than any other Disney eatery. \\n\\nThe food at Jiko is based on Africa but that doesn't mean you will be feasting on exotic endangered animals. All of the dishes are familiar to the American palate but the method of preparation and seasoning give a nod to the dark continent. As an added bonus the wine list is heavily South African and according to Disney the largest South African wine cellar in North America. If you have never tried South African wine you are in for a delicious treat. \\n\\nI think the Taste of Africa appetizer is a good start for people that are unfamiliar with African food. If you like dipping pita in hummus you will probably love this dish as it is very similar. I really like the Ostrich Filet as a starter. \\n\\nFor the main course it's a toss up between the Kenyan Coffee BBQ-Braised Beef Short Rib with Crushed Potatoes and Onion-Garlic Sauce and the Oak-Grilled Filet Mignon with macaroni and cheese and red wine sauce. Both dishes scream out to be paired with a nice big South African Shiraz. Trust me on this one, you will not be disappointed. \\n\\nDessert is the one course where I think you should force yourself to try something exotic. On one visit they had cardamon cookies that didn't sound that appealing but they were heavenly. I have craved them ever since but they haven't been on the menu for a while. \\n\\nNow I know I have mentioned this a couple of times already but you really need to try the wine while you are here. Yes it will cost a little extra and even if you aren't a wine drinker the food at Jiko is really, really, really enhanced by a matching glass of wine. I always have a different wine matched to each course and it is heavenly. \\n\\nBe sure to reserve a priority seating time through Disney Dining so you can assure a table at this wonderful restaurant."},{"name":"Blue Star Restaurant","address":"11 Corinth St","city":"Roslindale","stars":"3.5","text":"Love their omelets!!!

I also saw a yummy salad that I didn't get a chance to try but it looked amazing. It was nice they had vegan options for coworkers that don't eat cheese (they also offer gluten-free crust).\\n\\nSince I recently invested in a Chinook Book I had a coupon for BOGO menu item from Pizzacato. Two personal, artisan pizzas for $13.75 was a good deal so I ordered takeout. Ready in 20 minutes. The employee who rang up my order was very friendly and even stamped my card twice, even though I really only paid for one pizza. I also decided to pick up a slice for lunch the next day (Chinook Book also had a $1 a slice coupon). Since it was the end of the day they only have Margarita and Pepperoni being sold as individual slices but it looked like they had previous had other options earlier in the day. \\n\\nThe Thai Chicken pizza was really good. A little spicy but not too much. Delicious overall but not something I would crave and come back specifically for. Boyfriend had the Rudy pizza featuring sausage and caramelized onions. Tasted some and it was delicious as well. A small pizza is more than enough for one person. \\n\\nAt this point I still feel like Pizzacato is a place where I'll be happy experiencing different menu items from time to time but won't necessarily have Pizzacato cravings that keep me coming back. I have another coupon for $5 off $25.

I had worked myself up to ordering off of their regular menu, the Salade Lyonnaise and Trout Meuniere, but they had a special menu for the holiday, and no prix fixe.  (The prix fixe is highly affordable, especially considering the outstanding quality of the food.)  One in my party ordered the Duck, a combo of preparations, leg confit and breast.  The duck was perfect.  The birthday girl ordered the Sole stuffed with mushrooms in a Cremant Buerre Blanc.  It was outstanding.  I ordered the Filet and it was beyond perfect.  We shared all around so we could taste everything, and were all quite happy.  The vegetables are the same with each entree, carrots, a tomato something stuffed into a zuchinni tower, and baby carrots.  Not memorable, but also not really necessary.  Birthday girl had the Pavlova for dessert and liked it, I didn't taste it.

After eating this confection I felt satisfied and light, like I was floating on little fluffy clouds (or was that how I felt after my drink...?).  \\n\\nMy confit pork shank may get shortchanged here, but it was really tasty.

It is housed in the 4 story Gardiner Building which dates back to the 1760s.   It once housed the offices of John Hancock and is the oldest building still in use on Long Wharf.\\n\\nBack in its  early days,  The Chart House was once considered to be one of Boston's fanciest restaurants.  One has to remember that back then the dining scene in Boston was nothing like it is today.  As a kid, I have a memory of my parents getting dressed up to go to dinner at the Chart House with another couple.  Of course, they left us kids at home with our grandmother and told us that the Chart House was not a restaurant for kids.\\n\\nHow times have changed!  Not only do you not have to dress up to go to The Chart House but there are much better seafood restaurants in Boston.  Don't get me wrong---the food at the Chart House isn't bad.  It's just that it shouldn't be your first choice for seafood in Boston.\\n\\nThat said, it wasn't on our list of must-try restaurants this trip.  However, we had spent the bulk of the day in Western MA at a family gathering.  This was on a Sunday night and when we got back to Boston around 9 p.m., there weren't many restaurants open at that hour and were near our hotel.  Since the Chart House was practically next door to our hotel and was open until 10 p.m. plus we were hungry...\\n\\nAt that hour, most of the restaurant's business was in the first floor bar which had outdoor, as well as indoor seating and it was quite busy.  The restaurant is on the second floor and there were only a few other diners there at the time.\\n\\nOur server was very friendly and prompt.  We started off with our drink orders.  I ordered a mango mojito while our daughter got a luxe mojito and my husband had the Chart House's take on a Bloody Mary, called a \\"Willie Mary\\".  I was impressed with the mango mojito as the mango flavoring came through quite clearly.  My husband's drink was made with a pepper-infused vodka and he said it was very spicy.  Our daughter liked her luxe mojito (and I forget exactly what was in her drink).\\n\\nNext, we all had soup.  My husband and our daughter both ordered clam chowder which they said was creamy with a generous portion of clam.  They both enjoyed it.  I had the lobster bisque.  It, too, was creamy and I was pleased that the sherry flavoring was faint as it didn't overpower the delicate lobster flavor.  That said, there could have been a bit more lobster added to it.  All in all, a decent, if not mind blowing bisque.\\n\\nOddly enough, we all ordered the same thing for our main course!  We all got baked stuffed scrod (stuffed with crabmeat).  It came with mashed potatoes, 2 broiled asparagus spears and a broiled half of a plum tomato.  The fish was properly prepared as it was flaky and tender and the crab filling was decent.  The mashed potatoes were nothing to write home about and the broiled veggies were decent but the portion size was really stingy.\\n\\nWe left feeling full but not ready to explode, and contented with our meals.  While we don't regret dining there, it wouldn't have been our first choice for seafood.  So, we did wish that we could have eaten elsewhere.  However, our daughter wanted seafood and we agreed on that and as I mentioned, given the hour and the options available, the Chart House did fit the bill."},{"name":"Papagayo","address":"331 Great River Rd","city":"Somerville","stars":"2.5","text":"Guacamole was just ok...

I didn't mind the wait for the shot because I was consumed in conversation, but it took a fancy minute to hail the server and wait for the shot to be poured.

As I waited and looked around I noticed the place was about at 1/4 capacity, if that. I waited for about 3 minutes before a young girl came up to me with a confused look and asked if she could help me. I told her that I was waiting like the sign instructed and would like to have dinner, she then asked me if I had a reservation, which took me a bit a back since I was alone and the place wasn't that busy, when I told her no and that it was my first time here she told me that I could sit anywhere provided that there wasn't a reservation sign on the table. So I walked though the restaurant and finally decided on a small table near the back. I waited about 5 more minutes before she came up to the table with a menu and a tiny glass of water. She asked me if I knew what I wanted to drink, I again told her that it was my first time there so I needed to look over the menu. About 10 minutes later she came back to see if I decided on a beverage I ordered a glass of the cab ($7.50)and instead of just taking my order she asked if I would prefer a glass of their house red ($5.00)(why she did this I am unsure besides the fact that I am in my late 20's and most of their customers are in their 40's and I don't dress like a wine bar yuppie) I declined her offer and kept my order. She asked if I was ready to order I told not quite but had a question about a menu item. Being a person who prefers an oil based Caesar dressing over the typical cream based I asked her which type they served she didn't know and went to the kitchen and loudly asked the staff, which I'm sure nearly half of the other customers could hear as well. As I expected it was a cream based dressing I told her I would need just a couple more minutes to decide my order. 15 minutes go by I catch the eyes of only whom I could presume to be the owner and about 30 seconds later here comes my server to take my order. I order the bread and olives ($3.99) that's right no complementary bread and a small ramekin of tiny kalamata's and green olives w/ pimentos, a cup of tomato Gorgonzola soup ($3.99) served in a souffle dish, this was very disappointing since Gorgonzola is a very flavorful cheese and I could not detect it at all, to me it tasted like my at home Campbell 's tomato concoction, and the Pompeii salad (which apparently  you can order in a half portion even though the menu doesn't say so) ($4.50). So about 20 minutes later my food arrives not by the hand of my server but some guy who I assume is a cook, who is wearing his ipod earbuds(WTF!!!)  So I pick up my spoon for the soup and notice that it isn't that clean so after trying to get the attention of 2 servers I finally get the probable owner again and ask her for a clean spoon she tells me that the spoon isn't dirty but that it's been pitted by the dishwasher over the years. (As a waitress and bartender I know this isn't the case, this is a spoon that's been through the sanitizer (not dishwasher) too many times after being used with either cheese or cream that hasn't been polished off, so it slowly built up residue. Which still doesn't matter, the spoon could have been perfectly clean and she should have just said \\"absolutely\\" like any good server would and gotten me a new spoon) So after being lectured I finally get a clean spoon. My meal is decent too much garlic in the salad (and I love garlic) but that was all I could taste. I asked the waitress for a dessert menu and after looking over the obscure options I decided against it especially when the lady at the table ask the server for the chocolate lava cake to go and the girl told her it would be best if she microwaved it when she got home \\"cause that's what we do here\\" (seriously who microwaves cake? why isn't the chocolate sauce preheated? So when the server came back to me and asked if I decided on dessert I told her I wasn't getting any but was curious as to whether all the ravioli on the menu was fresh or frozen she told me it was frozen which was another disappointment.

Everything was fine, definitely nothing special. We really wanted to order dinner but after 2+ hours of waiting for drinks and only three appetizers, we decided to leave. The price point is high. $150 for six drinks and three appetizers. And it's impossible to find - BEHIND the Marta station (huh?) and not visible on 10th street where it's located.

Has a burger place finally knocked Dan's and Five Guys from their perch atop the 'damn good backyard hamburger' pyramid of taste?\\n\\nLet me explain: Might Fine Burgers Fries and Shakes (MFBFAS from hereon) reminds me that there are really two 'tiers' when it comes to burgers.  One is the 'gourmet burger' tier, one that is defined by exotic meats (elk, boar, cougar, California condor) and exotic add-ons (brioche buns, arugula, snake venom, unicorn tears).  The other is the 'damn good backyard burger', which is a simpler thing that seeks to impress with little more than a properly done patty, a plain bun, and more 'common joe' toppings.\\n\\nA place like Hopdoddy's is an example of the former.  MFBFAS should be the avatar of the latter.  What I term as juicy, other less-enlightened people would call 'greasy as hell'.  Ah, but it's so good.  The service is friendly, the dining area pleasant, and the crinkle-cut fries are delish.\\n\\nSome tips are in order: \\n\\na) For the adventurous (or plain gluttonous), order the 'Beast' which is two 1/2 pound patties.  That's right, 1 pound of grind-it-there fresh beef on the bun!  Bonus points if your name is 'Belle'.\\n\\nb) Get the lemonade.  It's the same price as a soda, plus if you're a Philistine and don't like the lemonade, you can always empty it out and go up to the soda machine to get the swill of your choice for free!  \\n\\nc) Do try out the 'hand Jacuzzi' before you go; preferably before you eat.  Your hands will feel tingly afterwards.  Very cool bonus.\\n\\nThis place pegs the 'CTJ Scale' at 5 stars, as noted below.\\n\\n5 out of 5 stars: Come-to-Jesus good. Would be OK passing on after finishing a plate here.\\n4 out of 5 stars: Come-to-Mary good. Would be OK being seen eating here by Mother Mary.\\n3 out of 5 stars: Come-to-Joseph good. Would be OK having a beer here with Jesus' Dad.\\n2 out of 5 stars: Come-to-the-Apostles good. Meh. Wouldn't have my last supper here.\\n1 out of 5 stars: Come-to-Nobody good.

The contradicting flavors that Indian food is known for, is yet again, blended together to make this delicious creamy, and smooth chicken deliciousness that makes your taste buds sing \\"hallelujah\\". The funny part is, unbeknownst to them, it has been given a southern flair by accident. They put a pat of butter on top when you receive it, kind of funny. Make sure you mix it in and make sure that buttery goodness is mixed in.\\n\\nThe Chicken 65, an appetizer in most situations, is also a really dish here. The marinating has penetrated all parts of each morsel of chicken that you can not stop eating it.  I don't know if they broil, pan fry, or deep fry, but it is delicious. The sauces are a good compliment to the plate, but it is just as good by itself.\\n\\nThe Chicken Tikka masala....Do not get this dish. It is not at the taste or caliber of the aforementioned dishes, and if it is your first time going...this is will kill your desires to go again...unless you don't know what it should taste like. The creaminess is there with the 4 to 5 pieces of chicken pieces, but the color and taste is so far lacking I would suggest them to either take it off the menu or get a specialized Chicken Tikka Masala cook. Yes...its that bad.\\n\\nKulfi...a desert...should be delicious goodness to calm down the crazy spice flavor you just ate. This is not...its not disgusting but it has an old taste to it that makes you wonder. The consistency of the dish is also kind of chunky...its supposed to be smooth. The Pista...my normal favorite...has the grainy old taste on top of have pistachios in your mouth. The pistachios is fine...the ice cream itself should be a smooth creamy rich consistency of ice cream.\\n\\nthe straight toe up part....you are fighting for seating if you go during rush times. either expand or move locations and get more seating.

When I came to Austin on a business trip, I looked forward to visiting Java Noodles. It's not hard to get there (about a mile off I-35), but it's easy to miss, tucked into a strip center. The dining room is kind of dreary, and the restroom wasn't terribly clean, but I had driven 20 miles to get there, so I stayed and ordered.\\n\\nFirst red flag - nobody knew a word of Bahasa, not even simple greetings, and when I asked if they had \\"es kalapa\\" (iced coconut water) I got a blank stare. I ended up ordering Mie Goreng with shrimp and chicken and sate ayam.  These are both staples of Indonesian cooking and if you can't get these right, you shouldn't call it an Indonesian restaurant. My Mie Goreng arrived first; it was quite tasty and I anticipated the sate being the same. The waitress asked if I'd like some hot sauce, and, expecting some sambal, I said yes. She brought a bottle of Schiracha to the table; not quite the same thing.\\n\\nThe sate arrived and as I took a bite and savored it, I realized I was eating undercooked chicken; sorry, I don't do pink chicken. When I pointed it out to a waitress, and showed her the pink meat, she first said it was the marinade. I don't think so. Anyway, to their credit, the offered to fix me another batch of sate or anything else I'd like, but I declined. They didn't charge me for the sate. BTW, the peanut sauce didn't seem very tasty either, but maybe the raw meat had something to do with that.  \\n\\nThe waitstaff were pleasant and most seemed concerned that I was not pleased, so that's a plus.

It was a Saturday night around 9pm, so maybe we had the leftovers from the day, but in BBQ, there are no leftovers. The pit should constantly be making meats, so there should be no excuse for having dry meat.\\n\\n2 of us ordered pulled pork, I had it in sandwich form. It came on a super thick ciabatta roll which to me is a waste. A BBQ sandwich should be about the meat, not the bread. It should be on a no frills hamburger bun or something with not much texture. The roll took every thing away from the meat (which was not much to write home about either). I ditched the huge roll and went for the meat. \\n\\nThe pork was super dry to the point where I was dousing it in sauce. I am of the school that sauce is not needed with BBQ, but nice to have. The meat should have enough moisture and flavor on its own that the sauce is kind of an afterthought. The sauce was definitely needed here. Also, the meat was super smokey. I am not sure if they use hickory or mesquite, but if its the latter, that might explain it. Either way, it was too smokey in my eyes. \\n\\nThe sides were ok. The burger was ok too from what I hear. But nothing special. The orzo salad was like a lump of mashed potatoes and was not eaten. \\n\\nAll in all, I will not be back here.

For years, I always passed by Zyka's, but never thought to go inside. The location is a bit random, by Lawrenceville Highway on Scott Blvd/Church St. and attached to a Montessori School. Once inside, I was pleasantly surprised by how spacious and updated the restaurant interior appeared, compared to the outside. \\n\\nZyka's probably serves the tastiest Indian food that I've had in Atlanta. Taking into consideration the taste, portion, price - it's probably going to be my go-to place in the future. I tried the Chicken 65, one of their best known dishes, which is essentially just fried chicken nuggets; the chicken is extremely red, which misleadingly makes you think it's spicy, when it's actually not. It comes served on a plate with two dipping sauces (a sweeter, brown one and a pinkish, yogurt-y sauce) - I actually didn't use either and opted for a separate white yogurt sauce. I also tried the butter chicken, chicken that's simmered in a creamy gravy; the hyderabadi mutton beryani, marinated goat meat that's tossed into basmati rice; the channa masala; chickpeas that are blended with tomatoes and spices; and nehari, a stew-like dish with beef and spices. All of these dishes come out in small paper bowls, so the portion sizes may not be as large as you think, but they only cost about $6.99 per dish, so it's a fair amount and is sufficient when you eat it with rice or naan. Another thing to remember here is, unilke other Indian restaurants, the naan/saffron rice don't automatically come with your dish but need to be ordered separately - the only con. If you order the naan, it'll cost you about $1.50 for 1 large circular piece; if you opt for the saffron rice, it'll cost you about $2.79, but you'll get a full plate's worth. Altogether, you're getting a pretty solid meal for under $10; if you decide to add another dish, the meal will cost you probably around $15 - which is the normal price for one entree at a lot of nicer Indian restaurants in the area. \\n\\nThe dishes here are probably a little cheaper because the entire place is self-serve; you order at a counter, then pick up your tray when they call your name. Napkins, drinks, utensils are all in an area to the side, so you grab them yourself. Worth it for me! I thoroughly enjoyed my meal and thought the different flavors in each dish were a lot more pronounced/tastier than other Indian restaurants I've been to.

They have what is probably the strongest AC unit on all of 82nd (avoid the table near the middle of the room off to the right if you are sensitive to gusty cold air blowing on you constantly!).\\n\\nYou can tell that the Chinese menu of dishes posted on the east wall is much longer than the one in English post on the west wall.  My father noted on our last visit that the price on at least one of the dishes was also different.  He didn't really make a big deal about it (or ask about it) though, because he likes the people there.\\n\\nWe always get the clay pot dish with eggplant, chicken, and little bits of salted fish.  The salted fish is incredibly potent (I think it's slightly fermented/preserved in salt) so a little goes a long way - and it is what lends the dish almost all of its flavor.  \\n\\nDad wrote me a cheat sheet of some more of the dishes we tend to get there (usually a steamed fish of some sort, and then another dish with black bean sauce (sometimes beef, this last time it was clams)).  You can order good food here without the translator present (and we have) but I feel more comfortable when the 'rents are making the selections.  Now I can just point at my ragged little notebook like a loon to get the dishes I want.

As always, my review is based on the food experience only I would say 4.5 stars because my cookie was a fail.\\nCitizen Burger (with GF bun) - Loved it. I wanted something simple and this was the perfect combination of flavors\\nYucca fries - Expect that these will be large pieces. They were really filling and crunchy which I really liked. I would have opted for citizen fries (I mean who doesn't love regular/sweet potato fries) but I wanted to try these. The sauce that they serve with the fries is really flavorful, better than ketchup for sure.\\nPaleo Burger (lettuce wrapped) - Hub liked this burger. He was still hungry after but commented on the flavor combination. He is not a vegan/or vegetarian so I was surprised he liked this to be honest. Win win.  \\nCitizen Fries - Mixed serving or regular and sweet potato fries. You can't go wrong with getting these as your side.\\nChocolate chip oatmeal cookie - I wasn't into this at all.

I visited Cartlandia for the first time on Friday night, as I was walking by this joint I noticed the cook preparing a burger/sandwich. I took notice of the care he was using, almost as if he was in some kind of a competition. I continued my walk through the rest of Cartlandia and made my decision, I wanted the creation that this artist was building.\\n    I ordered the monster burger, as I did I noticed the cooks eyes light up. I felt like he could tell that I was a fat kid and that I would truly appreciate his craft. After a quick rundown of options I decided on all the fixings with grilled onions and Thousand Island dressing. The cook then told me to feel free to wait in the beer garden and that he would bring me my monster. I found the beer garden to be delightful for what it is. The server was very polite, it was warm in the tent and the beer was cold. I enjoyed a Pale Drifter that I found excellent.\\n    After about 15 min I saw the cook come through the door, he had a huge grin and made a bee line to my table. He then dropped the mammoth burger in front of me and nicely told me \\"I am not responsible for clogging\\". I am guessing he was talking about my arteries lol. \\n    After shredding through the wrapper at first glance this burger was a little intimidating. A Franz pub roll is what holds it together (I find these rolls to be really underappreciated often). It contains 4 steak burgers which consist of a fresh flat burger patty perfectly coked. I personally feel that this is the best approch to preparing a burger fresh and flat. Next lots of American cheese, bacon, and a fried egg. Garnished with spinach leaves, tomatoes, and Thousand Island dressing. All ingredients tasted very fresh. One big thing for me was that everything had salt and pepper on it, like the guy truly cared about every inch of this masterpiece. The cook here is an all-star and deserves a lot more recognition; he shows a lot of passion for what he does. You can tell he loves feeding people.\\n   In conclusion I can honestly say this is one of the best burgers I have ever had. Thank you Jimmy for feeding this fat kid and making his Friday night a memorable one. If I could offer any advice is maybe add a French fry option."},{"name":"Thai Passion","address":"620 Congress Ave, Ste 105","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"Goodbye Thai Passion. \\n\\nI am a lover like no other of Gang Dang.

My mom ordered a tom yum soup which came out first. The server didn't give us spoons or silverware, I had to ask for them 5-10 minutes after the guy brought out the soup because we didn't know where he went.

The service was also slow. We were pretty disappointed after hearing such great things.\\n\\nThe Food: I was hoping the taste would make up for the service, but sadly it didn't. We purchased the beef cheek, the chicken, the quail and the brussel sprouts. The quail (a starter) was actually the best tasting of all. The beef cheek was tender, but also very bland. The chicken was fairly bland as well. The brussel sprouts were good though. Oh, and the serving sizes are very small.\\n\\nThe Wine: We purchased a bottle of '06 Olga Raffault Chinon (Cabernet Franc). This was delicious. Oaky, smooth, hints of dark cherry and currents. So good. We both also tried the Bourbon Renewal. This was super good too. Tart, but very tasty.\\n\\nConclusion: Thankful I went here after hearing so much about it, though not overly impressed.

Not just 1 kind of ribs but all ribs: spare ribs and baby back ribs - which are my favorite kind of ribs.   Running out of side items? really? Fried okra which I know comes as a frozen product.  How could you run out of that?  And hushpuppies which every BBQ restaurant serves which are a frozen product too?  Give me a break.  I was so supremely disappointed I wasnt even going to eat.  The only reason I gave 2 stars was the waitress was really nice about the whole thing - though not apologetic more like a matter of fact 'when you come in late we've run out of things'.

I was born here, I was raised here, and I fully realised how awesome the city is after returning home from extensive travel and study. There is one thing, however, that frustrates me about Vancouver on a daily basis: the city's (and province's) conservative liquor laws. One of the things I like best about visiting nearby Bellingham, Seattle, and Portland is the huge selection of unique bars and cafes. On a recent trip to Portland my girlfriend and I went to a cavernous hipster cafe in the northeast for a coffee and cinnamon bun. When I was paying I noticed three taps behind the till. \\"Did this used to be a bar or nightclub or something?\\" I asked our barista. He gave me a confused look and asked why I thought that. I pointed to the taps and he said, in a slow and borderline condescending tone, \\"Those are for beer...in case people want to drink beer and eat instead of, you know, drink coffee.\\" This place didn't even serve food! Just kickass coffee, amazing local microbrews, and sweetass baked goods. To make the situation even better, people were allowed (nay, encouraged!) to bring in their own food. This concept of a cafe THAT IS ALSO A TAVERN was so foreign to me as a sheltered Canadian that my tiny deprived little brain couldn't even imagine these two delicious drinks being served at the same time, in the same space.\\n\\nVinoteca is one of the only places in Vancouver that promotes itself as a cafe (sorry...caffee) but is also a bar that offers craft beer and charcuterie. In addition to filling this gap in Vancouver's rigid and generally unimaginative restaurant scene, Vinoteca has also replaced the last (and much needed) coffeeshop that was in this block, Coco et Olive. I liked Coco et Olive, and it was also really popular with the student crowd, before it was closed because the block is being redeveloped. I haven't even eaten at Vinoteca yet, but they will have to screw things up pretty badly to fail with such a corner on the coffee-beer-combo market."},{"name":"Habibi Restaurant","address":"1012 SW Morrison St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Had the Habibi mezza plate and I recommend it if you're eating here!

Thank goodness, because the place filled up fast after we arrived!\\n\\nWe started off the the Soft-Shell Crab Tempura as an appetizer, which was amazing-- not too greasy, but still delicious. Our main dishes arrived pretty much immediately after, which were the hot soba with duck (for him) and the sushi deluxe (for me). Both were incredible but be warned-- the little dish of spice that comes with the soba is extremely spicy!! I made the mistake of wanting to try it and couldn't get the burn out of my mouth for a good number of minutes. The sushi platter was great (6 pieces spicy tuna roll, 8 pieces sashimi), and my only criticism is that it was hard to share, because the sashimi were all different.\\n\\nWe ended up paying a little more than would be ideal, but definitely worth it for the quality.

I wore a nice top and jeans, and felt fine, but it is not a jeans-and-t-shirt place.  Service was very friendly and helpful.  The lighting and decor give it a very romantic, rich feel.\\n\\nI cajoled my husband into taking me here as an early birthday present- we're watching our budget, but this was surprisingly well-priced!  The decor makes it seem much richer, and the food...well, we'll get to that.  But the cost was comparable to Beer Works or any other \\"regular\\" place.\\n\\nWe both started with an antipasti, me with the arancini, husband had the mozerrella.  We shared, they were both very tasty.  We were happy to see that Tues and Weds nights have a \\"Neighborhood\\" price menu, $24 for an antipasta, dinner and dessert and the selections change each week.  Some choices from that menu were on the regular menu, some were not.  My husband had a steak-filled ravioli-type pasta from that menu, and I ordered the Garganelli pasta- as a starter size, not an entree (husband's dinner was the same size).  I wanted to save room for dessert, and still didn't have much!  I ended up splitting my husband's dessert of panna cotta with blueberries, and had a decaf latte.\\n\\nI wish I had a gourmet's vocabulary to describe this delectable dinner.  The arancini were perfectly fried, just cheesy enough and served over fresh basil and thinly-sliced tomato.  The combination of fresh flavors brought me back to Italy.  The mozerella was served with a warm currant, caper and pine nut compote, quite an interesting mix of flavors.\\n\\nI tried a bite of my husband's ravioli dish, but I honestly can't remember it for the full flavors of my Garganelli pasta.  First, the pasta is obviously hand-made fresh in the restaurant, giving it a great texture.  Then, the duck was thoroughly eneveloped in a rich red wine sauce, with dried cherries that had been in the sauce just long enough to plump up a bit and add a tart sweetness to the whole thing.  There was also some type of green in the dish, but I'm not sure how much flavor it added.  I absolutely recommend this dish, and can't wait to go back for future visits, try the other delicious dishes I need to try, so I can have the Garganelli again.  Trying to remember the adjectives I used on the drive home...\\"sweet, smooth, rich, flavorful\\"  I mean it really all just melted in my mouth!\\n\\nAnd finally the panna cotta.  A tasty vanilla custard that had a slight bite to it, I wonder if it was partially cultured because even my husband mentioned it had a slight yogurt taste.  It was more sweet, though, and certainly didn't detract from the dessert experience.  Topped with warm blueberries and large enough for us to split, it was a smooth finish to a wonderfully smooth, delicious meal.\\n\\nThe only thing I might downplay is the latte.  I don't know why, I just wasn't quite happy with it.  Not quite strong enough, I think- and yes I ordered a decaf, but there should still be a strong coffee flavor to it.\\n\\nOverall a great experience, and it will definitely be a new favorite on our list of locals!"},{"name":"Artu","address":"89 Charles St","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"I did order this as takeout, but it's pretty hard to make bad carbonara.

It was really loud, and there were just tons of inebriated people walking around grinding random chairs and other things that just made me feel like I was in a restaurant trying to eat at a strip club feel which is not something I want.

It's also a great addition to Midtown -- which is a hood that severely lacks decent East Asian eats -- but I don't find myself dropping by that often.\\n\\n*****\\nI. FOOD: They have all the staples like lu rou fun, pork belly baos, and Taiwanese beef noodle soup. And my Taiwanese-American girlfriend and I ordered these exact dishes:\\n\\n*Lu Rou Fun: Nice cup of steamed Jasmine rice topped with a savory braised pork, chopped cilantro, and a soft-boiled egg. Not bad, however, I don't know if I would go out of the way for it. \\n\\n*Pork Belly Bao: Steamy buns filled with a tooth-some slice of pork belly, crushed peanuts, fresh scallions and cilantro. Pretty good.\\n\\n*Taiwanese Beef Noodle Soup: Broth? OK. Noodles and beef were fine, too. \\n\\nII. SERVICE: As long as I get my food in a decent time, I don't really care all too much if servers are nice. And about that, it took about ten to fifteen minutes before the first course came out. So, a little longer than what I'm used to for food coming out. \\n\\nIII. ATMOSPHERE/ D√âCOR: Super small space inside (that seats maybe 20-30) with chic new-age \\"Asian\\" design.  \\n\\nIV. PRICES: Expensive. Almost double from what I'm used to paying, and this is even taking into account this eatery residing in an expensive (Midtown) hood. \\n\\nV. OVERALL: Ah-Ma is a solid Taiwanese restaurant that's priced quite high. It would definitely be justifiable if the food made my eyes roll into the back of my head, but it's just solid to me. \\n\\nI'll be back to support in the future!"},{"name":"Mellow Mushroom Orlando","address":"11680 E Colonial Dr","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"Sooo good.

What can get better than Thai food that is \\"food from the heart\\"? You can see that Gene Kobboon does put his heart into the cuisine and the interior design of the restaurant. All the carvings in the restaurant are made by himself.\\n\\nLet's start with dinner. I always get the duck curry which is roasted duck breast topped with red curry, pineapple, tomatoes, bell peppers, and basil in coconut milk. The curry is super smooth and creamy and the coconut adds a exotic fragrance. Another favoriate is PLA-SUM-ROD, which is fried red snapper fillet topped with tomatoes, onions, lime leaf, mushrooms, bell peppers and basil in tamarind sauce flavored with Thai peppers. The snapper is super tender and flaky coated with the tangy sauce. The Dancing Seafood, which is stir fried scallops, shrimp, squid, New Zealand mussels, mushrooms, tomatoes and onions in Thai hot & sour (Tom-Yum) sauce is great as well. My upmost place to get dessert would probably be Thai Passion. The mango with sticky rice is solid. The mango is always sweet and the sticky rice is freshly made and never dry. They cover it with condensed milk and chocolate sauce. I love their coconut ice cream, which is made fresh too in a waffle bowl.\\n\\nI don't recommend lunch. Don't order chicken here, it's a bust. Always tough and flavorless. If you come for lunch, the curry comes with an option of chicken and tofu. The pad thai is not bad. I am a fan of the Pou Peersod, which are soft spring rolls stuffed with vermicelli, Shrimp or Tofu, leaf lettuce, cucumbers, carrots and cilantro. Served with Thai sweet & sour sauce, topped with ground peanuts. Super light & yummy!\\n\\n\\nI would give this place 5 stars but I've been noticing some inconsistency. Last time when I got the duck curry, the duck was overcooked to the point where it was rubbery and difficult to chew. The PlaSumRod was over-sauced which made the red snapper soggy and not flaky.

In mine and my girlfriend's case, this would be attending the Be Our Guest Restaurant for a 10 pm dinner reservation.The late dine-in is due to the venue being one of the most popular places to eat in the entire resort. However, it's popularity is completely justified. The moment the towering wooden doors are opened into the castle, you feel you are truly being treated. A quick tour was given to us followed by our seating arrangements. The most striking visual is definitely the grand ball room. It's sprawling Victorian charm, compete with an enormous crystal chandelier will make for wonderful photo opportunities after the meal. Funny enough, we weren't seated in the ballroom. We were escorted to the famous and very spooky \\"West Wing\\". Since the Haunted Mansion was our favorite ride, this was an added treat that catered to our personal tastes in the best way. The waiter was very friendly and was able to give us excellent descriptions of some of the unknown french cuisine. Since it was late we only ended up getting some soup, bread and some of \\"the grey stuff\\". It was delicious but it's hard to make judgement since we didn't try a heartier entree. After we finished our meal, it was picture time. While we were snapping away in the ballroom The Beast himself came out and addressed everyone eating. Then he rounded a corner to do some photo ops himself. We got a few pictures with him and then departed the castle for the evening. It was a wonderful experience and I highly recommend it to anyone.

Came here for lunch with a friend on a Tuesday afternoon. Right out front of the castle a worker there handed us some time cards to come back in about 30 minutes. When we came to the front, they were very serious about making sure we came back during the allotted time we were assigned for, as they were holding people back for being a few minutes to early and not letting people in for being a minute late. They directed us to a line just outside the castle where we waited for a few minutes, before being directed into a second waiting line inside the castle. After waiting about 10 minutes, we got up to the ordering station, where they handed us a plastic box with a rose on top of it, which would act as a GPS so the waiter would be able to deliver the food to us. From there, you now have to choose where you want to sit.\\n\\nThe atmosphere here is pretty awesome, inside and outside. The entrance way is that of a classical castle, with scary beast statutes adorning the entrance, and knights armors in the halls. There are three separate dining rooms, but by far the coolest is the beasts room where you had the magical rose, and the beast's human painting. It's a much smaller room than the other two, but has so much more life to it. It is very dimly lit, and the lighting strikes every few minutes. Disney plays pretty fast and loose with the term \\"quick service\\". Not only did we have to wait in a pretty long line to order our food, but once we ordered it, it took a long time for it to come. Now granted, the technology they use to find the customer is pretty cool, but still I'd rather the food come out a tad bit quicker. The French Onion Soup was good, but not great by any means. It was also $5, which is a tad bit higher a price than it should be, but not beyond unreasonable. The Strawberry Cream Cheese Cupcake was mediocre at best. And for the $5 it cost me, it really was a waste of a dessert. I also paid $2.50 for a water bottle, but I quickly found out when I went into the dining room that you could just get a cup and fill it with water. In fact, you can get a cup and fill it with anything, without even paying for it! Prices are high, food quality is mediocre, and the service is slow.

And I chose the word \\"confronted\\" specifically. He was aggressive and belittling, referencing my last  YELP rating. I attempted to explain that he isn't allowing the burger to rest before serving it. As most cooks know, almost all proteins continue to cook after you take them off of the heat source. So, if you want a burger medium, cook it medium-rare and take it off the grill. It will be a perfect medium by the time it is served.  well, he didn't want to hear any of that, making excuses like \\"what do you want for a $5 burger?\\" and telling me I didn't know what i was talking about. \\n\\nWell, I know how to cook a burger, little man, and a lot more. \\n\\nOnce we were in the van, the three of us could not believe the conduct of this owner. And thinking back, I am certain he was the guy cursing at his staff in the kitchen (see my earlier reviews). We all decided that was our last trip there. \\n\\nSince he obviously checks yelp, here's a little message for you: Get out of the business. You are a stupid, ill-mannered little slug. We don't want people like you in Winter Springs. This is a nice community. Go back to Philly, or Jersey or Baltimore (whatever metropolitan toilet you crawled out of) and you can talk to your customers any way you want."},{"name":"Barley's Brewing Company","address":"467 N High St","city":"Columbus","stars":"4","text":"Food was bad.....Greek salad tasted sour....mac n cheese was watery with no flavor.

I usually choose this location over the Allston-Brighton location because it is slightly closer and not as likely to be crowded. My go to dish here is usually the medium beef tofu soup with an egg (can't bust it open over the soup anymore per Mass Health Regulations :( ) and/or tteokbokki. The soup is definitely seasoned well though the amount of meat can be meager sometimes. Go for spicy if you have a high tolerance for spice. They vary the banchan though it invariably includes broccoli, egg salad, egg omelette wrap, and kimchi. More often than not, I get lucky and end up with my favorite bean sprouts. The service is usually prompt and the food comes out fairly quickly. One of the few gripes about this Kaju location is inconsistency; sometimes, the tteokbokki lacks the egg and the spiciness level for the soondubu is off by a few levels such that a medium spicy tofu soup tastes more like a mild spicy tofu soup. A few menu items, such as mandoo soup, aren't available either. Definitely pricey but that's to be expected from Korean restaurants in Boston (5% discount when you pay with cash; slight dent, but it still counts). For what it's worth, Kaju Tofu House is still one of the better places to get Korean food and I will keep coming here to satisfy my soondubu cravings.\\n\\nUpdate: The 5% discount with cash usually applies but occasionally omitted; consistency is again variable but not enough to deter me from returning. \\n\\nIG: Moodforfoodeatery"},{"name":"Wayfinder Beer","address":"304 SE 2nd Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"The food was ok, I agree with the other review that the prime rib sandwich was not what they expected, it was a Philly cheese sandwich pretty much.

McKnight's helps fill that void, and has a lot of potential, but may not be quite there yet.  That being said, I am a huge soul food or southern food fan.  I long for the day we have a true meat & three in Orlando.  Its also a food genre I am very picky about and while I liked McKnight's it did not blow my socks off.\\n\\nUpon arrival, the waitstaff greeted us with a smile and was very pleasant. Throughout my lunch the waitstaff was excellent.  There was one small hiccup in the order, but it was quickly remedied. McKnight's has some great people working there.  The dining room is nice, well appointed and comfortable.  \\n\\nThe menu at first blush was definitely limited.  There is a daily special and a few other everyday items noted.  That being said our server noted there were about 4 or 5 items which did not appear on the menu, including catfish and others. With those additions, the menu was much more complete, and satisfying.   \\n\\nI was a little disappointed we did not arrive on a day when the fried chicken was available.  To me, fried chicken is the one thing by which all soul food/southern food restaurants are judged.  I almost ordered the fried chicken wings which were a non-menu item, but I never find wings to be as good as a leg/thigh/breast when fried. Instead I ordered the smothered chicken and rice special. The chicken was well cooked and tender. The food was tasty, but might have used a little more seasoning.  The gravy was also good, but a little bland for my tastes.  The macaroni and cheese was a a very good side.  This was a highlight of the plate.  It is a well done southern style mac & cheese so if you're looking for a creamy macaroni, you'll have to look elsewhere.  Collards were cooked well, but again, were a little bland for my tastes.  Interestingly, the green beans had a very similar taste to the greens, as if they were cooked in the same seasonings. Although I usually prefer my beans to have a little more of an onion and ham hock taste, these were good, and tender.\\n\\nMcKnight's is worth a second trip and I will definitely give it another try, hopefully on a fried chicken day. We also discovered they serve breakfast, but  I did not have a chance to view a breakfast menu.   The place definitely has a lot of potential.  Just as a note, although the restaurant is in the area of the Amway Center, it is a block west of the Amway, near the west end of the CityView complex.  Its not off the beaten path, but also not in a heavily traveled area, either.

I let her know that I did not like fat and did not pay 15.00 to eat it. She refused to replace the meat for me and told me she would have to charge me because it states somewhere in the menu (probably in fine print and hidden) that there meat has fat.

No, if I wanted chicken, I would have ordered chicken. If you can make the effort to bring me chicken, why not just replace the damn pieces of meat for me and make your customer happy?

There were so many smaller groups coming and going, isn't it common sense to think \\"this group has been waiting for a while, I will reserve this table since the group next to this table is finishing up as well and I can push the table together\\"? But instead the hostess insisted that the two long tables MUST be ours.

Two people sitting at the bar, chatting with the bartender, then myself and my date. At first glance, it's a very nice looking space, although it looks like a lot of the left over decor from Red Squared still has a home here, we saw several USSR era posters adorning the walls.\\n\\nThe service seemed promising at first, we were seated and given menus to peruse. We looked over the food, which seemed like upscale appetizers and mains which seemed to embrace the sometimes overdone euro-fusion mentality in similar places. Nothing really caught our interest out of the gate, so we decided to stick with drinks.\\n\\nI started out with an eight dollar bottle of beer, I think a 500ml Czechvar, (not an atrocious price for Granville St.) my date had a ten or eleven dollar martini, complete with rose petal. Looking over their signature martini list, I noted a great many specialty liquors in the various recipes. Tobacco infused this, hibiscus infused that; with names like the Christina Hendricks, and various other Mad Men appellations. Hanging around the bar were T.V.'s with the hit show playing silently on the screens.\\n\\nNow, allow me to break away from the drinks for a moment, and strike to the heart of design / vibe choices. If you want to set up a hip retro-lounge, with a Mad Men vibe... great. However you don't do that by naming all your drinks after characters in the show, and playing the show on flat panel TV's. Go old school, serve Scotch, Martini's and Manhattan's, with your own twist if need be.\\n\\nI mean, there's subtly evoking a mood, and then there is smashing people over the head with it. Go with the former, not the latter. Being served a \\"Don Draper\\" with re-runs in the background is a little too reminiscent of my \\"Oh Geez, really Clint?\\" reaction at the end of Gran Torino, when Mr. Eastwood strikes a Christ pose as he's riddled with bullets from the Hmong gangsters. I mean, we get it Clint, Walt's the great white savior.\\n\\nMoving on.\\n\\nSo, Czechvar is great, but they didn't make that. The Martini was visually very appealing, although flat, flavor-wise.  The wrong side of balanced, if you will. My date didn't really care for it, and when I had a sip, I had to agree. However, when I looked for another Czechvar, my server was idly chatting with another member of the staff. Then he disappeared. I tried to catch the bartenders attention, with that \\"I'd like another beer look\\" but to no avail. Finally, after waiting for a few more minutes, I just called out \\"Check please\\" to no one in particular, and the bartender came over with the bill.\\n\\nNice space, nice looking bar, nice seating.\\n\\nEverything else, just sort of pedestrian."},{"name":"Toulouse Cafe and Bar","address":"3120 Palm Way, Ste 150","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Most of the people give few stars because of service is bad, this time, my service is pretty good, polite and efficient.

It's Chipotle. ;) So- for the price and what we got, the food was ok. \\n\\nWhere it's just awful is the service and the environment. Nicole S. was our server and although she was friendly, it was just terrible service. We ordered guacamole that never came, we asked for a water- we had to ask for it again mid meal because it never came. Our server was across the bar on her phone the whole time. We weren't even done with our meal and she dropped the check- we actually wanted dessert but was never asked. The vibe we got was basically, \\"get out.\\" There was no music on- and there were  a couple of really drunk patrons at the bar screaming so loud that we could barely talk to each other. The staff didn't do anything about it. They were just chatting about their personal lives- so we could all hear them. \\n\\nThe best part was when we got up and were leaving. The staff didn't even acknowledge us. We were the only people in the restaurant and they basically ignored us. The kicker is that one of the drunk patrons was outside smoking a cigarette- she told us to have a great night and she apologized for being rude. A drunk patron was actually nicer to us than the staff. \\n\\nYou have to wonder who owns this place and if they even poke their head in to see what's going on.

I was given sandwiches on white bread after specifying I'd wanted whole wheat on another 2 occasions. Sandwiches, while delicious, are made painstakingly slow. Given the high volume of orders that come in, and given that sandwiches are pressed, I understand it can take a while. If you have 15-20 minutes to kill while waiting for a sandwich, great.

The salsa was fresh and had a nice mild heat to it.\\n\\nI had the house special BBQ burrito and my wife had the tamales.  THe BBQ burrito was bizzare.  It was a ketchup based burrito but it had way too much ketchup and way too much sugar. it was very sweet and not savory.  It needs more depth and less sugar.  However, i did appreciate that the flank steak in the burrito was cut perpendicular to the grain, so it was easy to cut with a knife or my teeth to chew (it's the little things!).  \\n\\nMy wife's tamales were actually REALLY good. They reminded me of tamales I had in Mexico as a teenager going on mission trips.  Definitely top notch on that.  The rice was ho-hum, with your typical seasonings.

Sometimes the food takes a little longer to come out because they're so busy, but they always bring extra bread (they serve you a cinnamon one and a savoury/regular one when you arrive) so that you don't go hungry.\\nSuperduper thumbs up."},{"name":"Chez Nous","address":"510 Neches St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"We were here for lunch, so crepes seemed like a no brainer.\\n\\nI got the ham and cheese crepe with an egg.

I have tried it on two different occasions and although it wasn't bad, I have to say that it didn't quite fit my taste. I always add black vinegar to my soup which helps balance out the saltiness level but this particular broth was nothing spectacular. I also found the noodles slightly overcooked for my liking. However, the braised beef was incredibly tender. \\n\\nI also noticed they had a dry noodle version so I'll be back to try it out. I've also tried their deep fried stinky tofu (which was tiny, dry, and overcooked) as well as their stir fried beef with noodles (pretty standard). \\n\\nThe milk slush series for the bubbletea are delicious. My favourite is the lychee and the pearls are cooked to perfection. If you go between 3-5pm or after 9pm the bubbletea is 50% off!!\\n\\nI can't say I'm a huge fan of their regular beef noodle soup but their bubbleteas are worth the visit.

I have to say that the fried olives at FINO rock hard and I don't EVEN like olives. The goat cheese with honey is delish and goes well with the wine and hard booze drinks that are well-mixed (they make a lot of their own garnishes and mixers in-house). \\n\\nThe hummus/tzatziki/baba ganoush is good as are the Spanish almonds. You could graze on bar food at FINO and leave happy - but with a much lighter wallet (fellow cheapskates - this ain't no Horseshoe Lounge). The assortment of booze is confusing when you are drunk which can yield unexpected but welcome results.

Don't know what it was but the mixture of the sausage gravy, moist biscuits, and the over nighted marinated in butter milk chicken was just delicious.

Menus were delivered to the table immediately. \\n\\nAnd those menus, well, they're adorable. With sections like \\"My Father's Soups\\" and \\"My Sister-in-Law's Desserts\\" you get a welcoming family vibe. Legit. Open the front cover; there's a parental tribute that rivals any sappy Grammy acceptance speech. \\n\\nSo you figure the service would be off the hook. It wasn't. It easily took 10 minutes before the waitress returned to take our order. We ordered 7 items and two drinks. She didn't write anything down. Lacking my usual manners, I joked that ours was a lot to remember. She indicated she was a pro and had it all up top. \\n\\nThe drinks arrived and weren't overly impressive. The Habibi Martini has a crazy blue food coloring added to it making it look like a fruity cocktail. It isn't. In fact, it's surprisingly bland, certainly not a refined martini. \\n\\nThe food came out as ready, definitely not a fan of that nonsense. It makes it so hard to mix bites and flavors. As the chicken kabab was placed on the table, the waitress asks, \\"What did I forget?\\" Shaking my head there. You said you had it all, you! I mentioned the missing rice and veggie kabab. Which came out about 10 minutes later. Bah! Those are two things you want to eat with the other food, not at the end all by themselves.\\n\\nTo top it off, the flavors weren't particularly fabulous.

I would like to invent some sort of boston sandwich awards just so I can give them a 'best vegetarian' award.  Why?   Because the Sweet Potato Sandwich was without a doubt the best vegetarian sandwich I have ever eaten.  In my life.  And I'm 31.  \\n\\nHere's a breakdown:   It was on pretty ordinary bread and looked small, so I was worried at first.  But inside is where the magic happened.  It was a layer of perfectly baked, cooled sweet potato; a layer of thinly sliced apples; a layer of thinly sliced red onions, and a delicious goat cheese spread.  While I was eating it, my friend Elana was telling me and Mary and about her new job.  What is her new job, you ask?  I have no idea, I was paying all my attention to my sandwich!  That's how good it was!  (Sorry Elana, I really do want to hear about your job someday soon!

However to get the full flavor, ask your African server to recommend the traditional dishes and how to eat them.

Not sure what to try, do what I did and ask your server or better yet, one of the chefs that are preparing the food what their favorites are.  Here were my winners of the night:\\n\\nSoups:\\nVegetable Soup - don't ask me why, but this was sublime.  One of the chef's recommended that I give it a try and I was in heaven, it was so good.\\nSeafood Gumbo - this was a hit with my family, who loved that it was full of seafood, but for me the heavy broth was just too....um, heavy.  \\nEntrees:\\nBobotie - an African staple, made with meat and cornmeal.  I was not sure I was going to like this, but I really did enjoy it as did everyone at our table.\\nDurban Roasted Chicken - reminded me a bit of Tandori chicken, but flavorful and moist.\\nWhole Roasted Salmon - really good, my wife went back for seconds, but don't tell her I noticed (or told you).\\nSpiced Sweet Potatoes - the hit of the night, everyone enjoyed them.\\nSpice Crusted Beef Sirloin - I did not try it, but my son went back for thirds.\\nGeel Rys - eat them the traditional way with the tomato salsa and it was delicious.\\nDesserts:\\nBread Pudding - good, but nothing to write home about.\\nKey Lime Cheesecake - whoa momma, very good!\\nBrownie - so simple, yet so good and delicious.\\nGuava Panna Cotta - not my favorite, okay not the favorite of anyone at our table.\\nZebra Domes - okay, I know these are hyped a lot and they are good, but I was not as impressed as I was some of the other dishes I sampled.\\n\\nOverall, such a treat to try such diverse dishes.

A pleasant surprise was the basketball game we had been invited to watch was playing on one of the screens so we plopped down at a table in front of it & started to watch. Although there were customers at only 2 tables it took the waitress quite a while to seat us. Even longer to come back for our food order(10 minutes +). We could see her in the other room either wrapping gifts or on her phone. We kept looking her way but to no avail. We decided that if the game was over before she took our order we were leaving. In the mean time the bartender changed the game on the screen in front of us although there were no customers asking for it. By this time there were only customers at 1 other table & they weren't watching anything. I asked about it & he put the game on one of the screens behind the bar. We could see it but - why did he change it when we were watching? I finally figured out it was so he could watch a game which he also had on another screen behind the bar. That way he could watch his game in either direction. The food arrived and it was quite good. They do have a good vegetarian selection and a good mole sauce!! When I asked the waitress for some tortillas she said OK then went right down to the end of the bar & sat down for a few minutes to talk to a customer. Finally she hollered at the bartender to order up some tortillas. Maybe we just went on the wrong night(Tuesday 12/6) but end result was good food & reasonable prices but bad help!! Probably the worst waitress we have ever had."},{"name":"Trudy's North Star","address":"8820 Burnet Rd","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"An Austin classic!\\n\\nOut of all the Trudy's locations, North Star is probably the swankiest and consistently seems to have good service. However, it's still the food that gets me to keep coming back to Trudy's.\\n\\nThe Stuffed Avocado is probably the most highly recommended order, and for very, very good reason. Every element of this dish is delicious - the avocado, the chicken, the cheese are all delicious and complement each other well. It may seem a little pricey at $11.50, but the dish is very filling. Trudy's has really perfected this dish to an art and it's worth getting at least once (also: get Borracho beans).\\n\\nSome of the other dishes I really enjoy are the Pollo a la Plancha and both the Beef Fajita and Smoked Chicken Chimichangas. The Pollo a la Plancha is a top-notch chicken dish that comes with delicious mashed potatoes and corn. The chimichangas (basically fried burritos) are delicious but be careful - they're basically drowning in cheese.\\n\\nOverall, Trudy's is a solid option.

You can't check in until 5 minutes before so we waited outside the Meet Belle area in the shade and were given our Rose GPS to check in.  Walking across the bridge to the castle is cute - with the gargoyle lamp posts and such.  The details are adorable.  We had pre-ordered (thank GOD because the ordering computers up front were PACKED up - that's where everyone was because the dining room wasn't full) so we walked past them and checked in and quickly found a seat.\\n\\nWe waited for them to finish cleaning a table by the windows in the main ballroom so I could see the \\"snow\\" falling through the windows.  It's all fake of course but it's a cute touch to make it look like it does in the movie. \\n\\nIt's nifty that Disney is so technologically advanced and they seem to do a pretty good job with everything from the smart bands, to fast pass, to their app, to the meals.  We waited probably 15-20 minutes and one of the servers found us with the GPS rose and brought us exactly what we had pre-ordered: 2 bottled waters, French onion soup, a veggie quiche with side salad, roasted beef, and FOUR cupcakes.  Yes that's right - four because my fianc√©e is a cookie monster.  lol.  We ordered the Lemon cupcake, strawberry, grey stuff, and the triple chocolate. \\n\\nMy fianc√©e's beef was pretty good - it was tender and his veggies looked good.  My quiche wasn't very good - it was dry and nothing special.  I ate it because I was going to be hungry - but I didn't especially care for it.  My side salad was good (it was just lettuce tossed in champagne vinaigrette dressing) and the French onion soup was good but it had a TON of cheese so I didn't eat much of it.  \\n\\nThe real star of the meal was the cupcakes of course.  The signature cupcake with the Grey Stuff was good... the icing tasted like a whipped cream cookies and cream or something with a chocolate cupcake.  The little sprinkle things are like crunchy whoppers or something.... yum.  The triple chocolate was also good with a very thick chocolate ganache on top.  I liked it.  The lemon was gross - neither of us liked it.  The real star was my Strawberry cupcake which had some strawberry cream filling and the icing - it was so soft and delicious.  OMG - first bite was like fluffy heaven.  My fianc√©e loved it - I took like 3 bites and gave the rest to him - he's still raving about it. \\n\\nI'd like to come back for dinner - I did see a few things on the dinner menu I wouldn't mind trying.

There is a nice air of authenticity to the exterior as you walk up to the restaurant as if you were actually in Italy. \\n\\nOnce inside, a beautiful, large, ornate and colorful chandelier in the lobby greets you. The tile floor is also beautiful as there are some unique tiles that have artistically-designed images like musical instruments, face masks, etc. Beyond the lobby is the main dining area, where there are three large wood-fired ovens, each named after Italian volcanoes (Stromboli, Vesuvius, Etna). Each of the ovens has a mythical god-like face, and the opening slots serve as their mouths, with the glow of the fires visible as they burn inside. It's very fascinating and visually symbolic.\\n\\nThe restaurant's interior is mostly open with very few partitions, and the high ceilings give the restaurant a grand feel. However, it also comes across as a little impersonal feeling and less cozy than one might expect. We were seated next to a window, where there was a cute, well-manicured area with flowers and whimsical statues, all surrounded by a tall, groomed hedge. In general, there were plenty of eye-pleasing things to look around at. \\n\\nWe quickly received some water and our drinks. The iced tea was exceptional--I believe it must have been a special fruit-infused tea, as the flavor was wonderful and refreshing. \\n\\nWe ordered an appetizer of arancini, which consisted of three fried risotto balls with a cheese and meat ragu center served over red sauce. Every aspect of this dish was terrific and delicious. The risotto balls were incredible and I loved the contrast of flavors with the meat and cheese in the center. The sauce was so good that I almost licked the plate clean. I told my wife that if the sauce used on the pizzas was as good as the sauce in the appetizer, we were really in store for some awesome pizzas.\\n\\nMy friend ordered an individual margherita pizza (sauce, cheese, basil), and I opted for an individual piccante pizza (which is topped with spicy Italian sausage). \\n\\nI'll start with the good...the crust on both pizzas was delicious and looked authentic and of excellent quality. On my piccante pizza, the Italian sausage was good and had a nice kick to it there also was plenty of sausage on the pizza.\\n\\nHowever, the bad far outweighed the good. The sauce and cheese components and overall taste of both pizzas was poor. The amount of sauce used was extremely light and looked like it had completely soaked into the dough. The cheese was paper thin, looked dried out, and was crumbly instead of gooey--as if it the pizzas had been sitting for a while or were overcooked.\\n\\nEven the basil used on our pizzas was sparse, faded, dry-looking and shriveled up. Other than the crust and the sausage on my pizza, both pizzas were very bland, and there was no taste of cheese or sauce on either of them. They were a huge disappointment. \\n\\nBefore our dinner at Via Napoli I had read reviews and looked over photos of pizzas that were taken by other guests. I can tell you that the pizzas in those photos looked fabulous, with strips of gooey cheese, a nice red sauce and fresh green basil. Those photos had us genuinely excited about coming here. However, our pizzas looked nothing at all close to as good as I've seen in those photos. I don't know if we just got two really bad pizzas as a fluke or if there is a serious issue with consistency. Either way, it is obvious that some people are getting some good-looking pizzas, but that was certainly not our experience. \\n\\nAs for the service--our initial drinks and appetizer were handled promptly, but the rest of the meal dragged. We waited quite a while for our pizzas--which would have been worth the wait had they been good. After dinner it took a very long time to receive the check, have it collected for payment, and brought back for me to sign. \\n\\nIt's a real shame our pizzas missed the mark so much, especially after such a great appetizer. I didn't have a chance to see other pizzas coming out during our visit, but I did see some pasta dishes that looked like they should have been really good and I wished I had ordered a pasta instead of what we received.\\n\\nFor a bill over $60 for two non-alcoholic drinks, an appetizer and two pizzas that were sub-par, I'd be hard pressed to give this place a second try."},{"name":"Gahanna Pizza Plus","address":"106 Granville St","city":"Columbus","stars":"4","text":"My buddy and I decided to start trying the subs at all the pizza places around us, since we're starting to run low on new lunch options.

If it weren't for that dressing, it'd be a really good sub.\\n\\nThe pizza was awesome. Both of us really enjoyed it.

I heard this restaurant had a huge change a while back and the decor inside is amazing! Not only are things modern but the restaurant still maintains that Vietnamese restaurant feel. We came here because we wanted good authentic Vietnamese food that we couldn't find near Denman. \\n\\nI came here with 3 others from a recommendation and boy am I glad that I came. They serve you either sparkling water or regular and we obviously chose the sparkling water. As an appetizer we ordered Vietnamese fried chicken wings (C√°nh G√†) for $12 and were given an option of either having a chili fish dipping sauce or butter, garlic & green onion. Oh man. These were tasty. Seriously. Order these. I would have replaced my entree (which was delicious) for 2 orders of these wings because they were THAT good. For my entree I ordered a Vietnamese Cr√™pe (B√°nh X√®o) for $17. What was in my crepe? Pork, prawn, bean sprouts and mung bean in crisp rice flour, coconut milk & turmeric cr√™pe. Served with lettuce, mixed herbs & chili fish sauce. Haha good luck finishing this. I ate about 4/5 of it before tapping out due to insufficient stomach capacity. The crepe was amazing and it'll keep you full. The other people in my party ordered a rice and pork dish as well as traditional pho.\\n\\nParking here can be tight. The street is busy so you'll have to drive a block or 2 down behind the restaurant and park in the residential areas and walk to the restaurant. Service time was about average. I never like going to Vietnamese places that can serve you up pho or other traditional plates in less than 5 minutes. It took about 20 minutes to get our food and I can appreciate the time and effort they put into our food.\\n\\nI would recommend this place for anyone who loves Vietnamese food or is wanting to try it for their first time. 10/10.

Finally a friend and I met for lunch today. \\n\\nWe were both looking forward to it so much that we had already discussed and selected our entree choices - grilled salad with an egg on top! \\n\\nWhen we arrived at noon, the place was empty and we were seated by a rather apathetic employee. We were the only patrons in the whole place.\\n\\nWe quickly placed our orders and began to catch up. TWENTY FIVE minutes later, still without food or having been checked on, we asked her to please box our food as we didn't have time to eat before returning to work. She rolled her directly at us. But seriously.....how long can it take to grill some romaine. \\n\\nShortly thereafter a manager of sorts entered. I'm sure he was able to read our dissatisfied facial expressions and annoyed body language. He came to apologize for the wait, claiming the ticket never printed in the kitchen. Which, having managed a restaurant for several years, sounded like a cop-out excuse. Probably Ms. Eyeroll didn't manage to enter the order properly...and then failed to notice the kitchen wasn't firing up food for the only people present in the restaurant at the time. \\n\\nThe manager gave us the salads on the house. They came out after about 5-6 more minutes. Also, he was nice enough to give us a card to come back again for salads and have a better experience.\\n\\nBack at work we decided we could give the place a second go because the salad was tasty and the manager took care of us. \\n\\nAnd that was the plan until my friend found a bug in her food. I know lettuce grows out of the ground which sometimes means that, even after washing, small knat-like bugs can stay lodged in the layers of the lettuce.

Once we finished watching the fireworks outside, we stepped into the castle and waited for our party to be called and even received a text message that our table was ready. We were led into the main ballroom seating area, which looked true to the movie. It was absolutely stunning and a unique dining experience. The food was surprisingly delicious, considering the other sub-par, cafeteria-styled dining options in Magic Kingdom. The service was a little slow, but not to a point of frustration. Our check for 2 people came down to $60 before tip (with no dessert). We even got to meet the host (Beast) after dinner in his library, which is right next to the main dining area.

The sauce on mine was still boiling hot and was starting to run off the side, so I jumped back when the waitress set it down.  They place it right in front of you and I found it very awkward to eat from.  It keeps the meat hot, which is good, except that after several bites, I'd like it to cool off a little.  Unless you ask for a separate plate, apparently they expect you to eat from that.  My advice -- if you're wimpy like me -- ask for a plate and (carefully!) move the molcajete bowl away from right in front of you!

First of all, it was not very big, contrary to what was stated in previous reviews.

So basically this sauce added a flavor I did not like at all, and overall the burrito was way too salty.. The rest of the ingredients were fine, but that flavor totally overpowered everything and ruined the burrito for me.  The service was friendly, although somewhat slow.

In semi-awe I asked \\"where did you get those?\\".   \\"The Great Harvest Bread Company\\" he answered. \\n\\n\\"Where's that\\"?  I asked, being able to smell the sinfully and criminally fragrant chocolate chip cookie he was eating as I was talking to him.  It only being a few minutes from my office, and him telling me that their breads were equally as good, I had to visit this place as my friends and I get together most every week to have dinner together and I had been buying my bread elsewhere. \\n\\nAnd boy I'm glad I went!  This isn't the kind of bread you would eat every day to have an eggs on toast bread.  This is very special bread.  Special occasion bread.  It's about $4.95 - $7.95 a loaf bread depending on what you get.  But I don't care, because this is GOOD bread.  Wonderfully fresh (as it should be since it's made daily).  It's my weekly stop now to bring a loaf to dinner with the gang and possibly get lunch while I'm at it.\\n\\nSome highlights?  I ended up getting a Pesto Asiago bread one time...pesto woven all throughout the bread (although I only saw it this once, shame, it was good).  Their Dakota seed breads and the 7 grain breads are very nice also.  I almost forgot the Olive Loaf - probably my second favorite.  My favorite out of all the breads, though?  Their Bruschetta Twist!  Cheese and tomato all throughout the bread.  Oh my Good God you have to try this!!!  Even better if you warm it up in the stove a bit before serving.  The texture of this is soft, luxurious and heavenly.  One of the most wonderful breads I do believe I will ever have.  \\n\\nIf you haven't yet, try one of their sandwiches for lunch as well.  I've only gotten a couple (their Bleu Roast Beef sandwich was very nice and the one I usually fall back on is their Spicey Smoked Turkey & Pepper Jack on their focaccia bread; messy but very tasty, and some advice...have gum or a toothbrush on hand - onions on it), but other co-workers of mine have gotten a few of the other ones and loved them.  \\n\\nAnd finally, those cookies.  I think their chocolate chip cookies sometimes have nuts in them (depends on the day I think), but either kind is amazing.  These are $7.95 for only 6 cookies, but let me tell you... 10 of us were at our weekly dinner one time (I hadn't realized that many people were coming) and 10 people still couldn't finish 6 cookies.  They're delicious and rich.  \\n\\nAnd a little bonus incentive, they have one of those punch cards where you get a free bread after buying 12 loaves.  Jim & Cheryl Cellucci are the owners of this partiulcar Great Harvest and very nice people.   Support your small business owners!\\n\\nThe only con - it can get crowded at lunchtime, so you may be better off going slightly before or slightly after lunch.  No real tables except for one or two small ones, so it's probably more take out to eat at the park or to your office.  However, there is a pro in this - while you're waiting for your sandwich, ask the person behind the counter for a free sample/slice of bread, tell the person next to you how yummy it is, and who knows, you may strike up a pleasant conversation...if you're waiting, why not make it enjoyable?  The free slice is a great marketing scheme on their part, as once you try that free slice you'll hooked and will want to go back to buy that loaf you tried...or try another one.  \\n\\nOverall, their product?

I love this fast pass concept of ordering food ahead of time then you simply go in to sit down. There are three dining areas, the rose room which is dark and almost always full.

I immediately called the restaurant and spoke to the manager, Bob, and asked if I could make a change.  He informed me that the pizza was already finished, so no changes could be made to the order.  That's fine.  No big deal.  It was my mistake.\\n\\nHowever, when the pizza had still not been delivered an hour later, I called back.  I spoke to Bob again who, I guess, didn't remember that we'd already spoken.  He assured me that my pizza was being taken out of the oven right now and that the driver would be at our house within 20 minutes.  I didn't address the fact that he'd previously informed me that our pizza was already done, an hour prior.  But whatever.  I just want pizza.\\n\\nThirty five minutes pass and the driver finally arrives.  He had trouble finding our admittedly hard-to-locate apartment.  That's fine too!  He was exceptionally polite and we tipped him graciously.  However, our pizza was ice cold and raw in the middle.\\n\\nI called back to the store to see if there was any way we could get a new pizza since this one was practically inedible.  Bob, the manager, told me that the driver was \\"a knucklehead\\" and that the cost of our meal would be deducted from the driver's pay and that they would give us a credit towards a future order.  I told Bob that his name calling of an employee was unprofessional and that we did not want the credit if the driver's pay was going to be affected by it.  He was polite and did his job well, finding an apartment that even iMaps can't locate.  Bob informed me that it was company policy and that his pay would be docked, regardless of whether or not we received the credit.  \\n\\nI told Bob that we don't make a habit out of visiting places with bad business practices that treat that employees poorly and that we would not be ordering from Galla's again.  I ended the conversation politely and he huffed \\"Have a nice life\\" into the phone.\\n\\nAbout five minutes later, Bob called me back, this time from what I assume was a personal cell phone number.  He informed me that he wasn't \\"some rich prick\\" and that the delivery driver was \\"a screw-up\\" and that he didn't want to lose me as a customer.  When I tried to speak, he spoke over me, eventually screaming into the phone.  He told me that he had all of my information and that if  I wrote a negative Yelp review, he would sue me.  Bring it on, Bob.\\n\\nI asked him if he was the owner of Galla's.  He immediately hung up on me.  \\n\\nDealing with this man was an absolute nightmare.

That being said, I'm a fan mainly due to variety of baked goods that is available here. I've been to several vegan-friendly bakeries from Miami to Gainesville, Erin McKenna's has arguably the largest selection.\\n\\nI understand people don't appreciate the prices, but for someone like me who's had a lot of premium vegan goods it's about average in the price department.\\n\\nMy only gripe with the desserts here is the presentation - It feels like these desserts are mass produced and thus, do not have consistency in presentation that's expected with a premium cupcake.

A few downsides to the outside seating here, which normally I'd love. First, the chairs/tables are pretty rickety, which made it a bit uncomfortable since we were both perched a bit wondering if the chair was going to go:)  Any smokers that head outside to smoke result in all the smoke floating right over to you.

Forever. .... and then there's the routine PDX begging that goes on by passerbys. So.... dine inside:) \\n\\nThat should not diminish the food, which was awesome, if not really rich. We split the lamb meatballs to start, which were a great deal for 5$ (3 balls).  In a fabulously simple and not overdone tomato sauce and basil preparation, they were a perfect start. We followed with a tagliatelle with crab and shrimp as well as pancetta wrapped trout.  The tagliatelle was yellow and awesome, without skimping on the seafood, or peppers. The sauce didn't overwhelm it.  The trout was an awesome dish, if not overwhelming. A whole trout, stuffed with greens, wrapped in prosciutto, and then in a mushroom cream sauce. It was delicious, don't get me wrong, but there was NO way anyone could finish it. We both took a lot home. \\n\\nWe skipped dessert, both stuffed. Overall, food rates high. \\n\\nService was iffy. Bartender was awesome, host was great, but our server seemed really put off or annoyed by us? We asked for suggestions and he seemed annoyed to have to come up with any.

The service is solid. Unfortunately, the food is just not up to par. Teatro suffers from the same thing that a lot of lower end/chain Italian restaurants (think Vinny T's and even Bertucci's at time) run into - technique and skill being replaced by garlic and salt. I find that very curious for a restaurant of this caliber.\\n\\nLast night, I ate with a group of five. Here's how it went down:\\n\\nApps - arancini, white bean puree, mussels... The arancinis had a great texture, but unfortunately all you could taste was garlic... The white bean puree also had a wonderful texture (sometimes those types of things feel like you're eating sand), but once again all you could taste was garlic... The mussels were overcooked, over salted, and way too garlicky. Not a great start.\\n\\nEntrees - spinach & mascarpone raviolis, pappardelle with veal meatballs, and the pappardelle with lobster and peas. The raviolis were very nice. The mascarpone and spinach balanced each other out very nicely. Garlic and salt were used to season the food, but not overwhelm it...The pappardelle with lobster and peas was decent. I make a version of this at home which I think is better, but it wasn't horrendous. The sauce lacked depth, which pulled down the rest of the dish... Now we get to the worst dish of the night, the pappardelle with veal meatballs. My first issue is that the dish should be called veal meatballs with pappardelle. There were 6 meatballs and very little pasta on the plate. One would expect the first ingredient listed to be the main attraction. What little pasta there was on the plate was excellent. Unfortunately, you could clearly tell that this pasta wasn't finished with olive oil/might have stayed under a heat lamp too long because by the time it was served to me all of the noodles had congealed together to form a ball. While on the subject of balls, let's talk about the meatballs which could double as golf balls. They were clearly over worked by the cook before being rolled into balls. They were rock hard and way too heavy.\\n\\nWe passed on dessert, in favor of drinks. The cocktail list is fine, and one can never go wrong with Sam's Summer on tap. I do take issue with the fact that the bartender topped off my Belvedere on the rocks with a little water. If I wanted water, I would have asked for it. The wine selection was pretty good, and had some reasonably priced bottles.\\n\\nOverall, I'd probably go back to sit at the bar and maybe give an appetizer another try, but I'm definitely not going back for dinner.

You can get the same quality counter food at the dozens of other themed places scattered throughout the park.\\n\\nThe reason you should come here is not for the food, but the atmosphere. Be Our Guest is truly a beautifully themed restaurant that looks like you have actually stepped into the movie itself. You get the choice, depending on the crowd, of three dining areas that are each individually themed from the movie. I would even say that it is a must-see type of place.\\n\\nAs for the food, it is very average. My wife and I had the French onion soup for an appetizer. It was serviceable in an Applebees sort of way. An orange and chocolate eau Claire was the highlight for dessert. The one thing I was extremely disappointed with was the Croque Monsieur sandwich. I could honestly make something better at home with a loaf of bread, some ham, and some sort of white cheese. It literally looked like it came off a bad kid's menu. I dutifully ate half but that was all I could stand. Just picture a homemade grill cheese with a slice of lunch meat added.\\n\\nOne thing you have to remember, though, with any of these restaurants is that you are eating in an amusement park. When I read other reviewers trying to compare restaurants in the World Showcase to being in the actual countries or expecting 3 Michelin stars from a restaurant that serves on paper plates, I think they are a little too harsh and unrealistic. This is food prepared for the masses (and believe me, this restaurant has so many customers that we used a FastPass).\\n\\nIn summary, do your duty and take your little princesses inside to see it.

Upstairs in what looks like some office park, Fino has a really cool outside balcony seating area.  The day was too chilly for that so we sat in the lovely interior and were waited on quickly.  My table mate ordered the french fries and a sandwich with smoked mozzarella, and I ordered the chicken crepenette - which turned out to be two chicken meatballs on a small salad.  Huh.  Tasted fine but I wouldn't order it again - probably would have snagged my friend's fries.  The best part of the meal was that my friend, seeing me glancing at their signature drink menu, told me I HAD to order the mossberry martini!  HAD TO!  Well okay - I like and respect this person, so to make him happy, fine.\\n\\nLet's just say that the next week I called the restaurant and begged them to give me the recipe for the martini.  And they did without hesitation, including boiling the whole cranberries with pure maple syrup and honey and sugar and water for an hour, and then mixing a bit of that with some fresh lemon juice and 1 1/2 ounces of Craybar green tea vodka.  Let's just say I made it at my sister's in Houston over New Year's okay?  Let's just say we enjoyed it okay?  Let's just say we enjoyed it with tequila when we ran out of vodka, too, okay?  Let's just say I don't see myself without green tea vodka in my house ever again okay?  Let's just leave it at that okay?\\n\\nBut about the food. The chicken crepenette with salad was alright.  I will go back to Fino again for the beautiful space and outside sofa seating - I won't order that chicken anymore but I saw several inventive dishes on the menu that I would love to try for dinner, including paella, duck, and many tapas."},{"name":"FINO Restaurant Patio & Bar","address":"2905 San Gabriel St, Ste 200","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"I had a chance to try out the paella here on their Tuesday happy hour. We also tried some of the tapas. \\n\\nWe had the crab stuffed pepper, chips with the house sauce, pork skewers, calamari, and one other dish for tapas. The crab stuffed pepper order was small but was one of the tastier items. The dip for the chips was addicting. The pork skewers were moist and had plenty of flavor. The calamari came out good but the dipping sauce wasn't that great.\\n\\nI guess the reason for my low rating is what I expected from the paella. I have been spoiled by paella in Barcelona and I have had some good paella in the US. So for the regular price of 50 bucks for a serving of two sounded okay and seemed likt it should produce a quality product. I was not impressed. The flavor was missing. They did throw a good variety of seafood on here. I am just saddened because the paella wasn't really even worth the Tuesday happy hour price."},{"name":"Teatro","address":"177 Tremont St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"I'm shamed that as a semi-frequent visitor to the theatre district, I have waited so long to try this place out, but I am very glad I finally did!  The food was absolutely wonderful from beginning to end.  Our table started with the calamari and grilled octopus appetizers.  The calamari had a perfectly light, crisp coating and was not greasy at all.  I used to think all fried calamari was the same, but this one sets a new standard for me.  The grilled octopus was also excellent, though there was not much on the plate to be shared among four people.  I think we each only got one bite of octopus, but thankfully the accompanying potatos were so delectable that no one felt gypped (are we allowed to use that word?).  \\n\\nMoving on to entrees, we were all pleased to see that the pasta/risotto could be ordered as entree size or small plates.  Me, I'm a full size kind of guy, so I ordered the large portion of risotto with braised lamb shank.  The lamb was tender and the risotto creamy and delicious.  What more can you ask for?  Thankfully I was dining with people willing to share and so got to sample the sweet potato tortelloni and the special of the night, a gnocchi with a goat cheese sauce.  Both were excellent, but I'm glad I didn't order those as the portion did not look like enough food to satisfy me.      \\n\\nService from the kitchen was incredibly speedy for this kind of establishment, but the service from the bar lagged a little bit.  The cocktails are worth the wait though.  I stuck with a dry vodka martini, but there are some interesting libations available here.  I do seem to recall blood orange being a common ingredient in many of them.  Not that that's a bad thing, but it made me think momentarily that the bar was kind of a one trick pony in its cocktail craft.  But as one of my dining companions remarked, \\"Shut up, Tom, blood oranges are expensive and they have to make use of them.\\"  \\n\\nThe atmosphere at Teatro is incredible, cool architecture/decor that is very European feeling but doesn't come across like the designers are trying too hard.  Other reviews complain of the volume in here, but I didn't find I had to raise my voice to talk to those around me.  I would recommend this place for a romantic outing or small group get-together.  Whatever the occasion, most definitely make a reservation.  We had a 5:30 reservation and walked into a nearly empty restaurant, but by 6-6:15 or so the place was packed on a Tuesday night."},{"name":"Barley's Brewing Company","address":"467 N High St","city":"Columbus","stars":"4","text":"Where to begin...\\n\\nBeer- Its all good!

This place is AMAZING. I have so much to say about it but I'll try to keep this review short unlike a lot of my other reviews. All you really need to know about this place is the food is DELICIOUS and I feel like that is a complete understatement. There is no other way to describe this place than perfect. I will consistently be using the word perfect in this review. This is the perfect place for any special occasion. It's a bit pricey but totally worth it. It's essentially a flat price for a 4-course meal and you're given about 4-5 options for each course. \\n\\nPrior to going, I was told by multiple Yelpers to try their Frico Caldo, which is one of the few things they consistently have on their menu. I can see why there is so much hype around it. If you don't know what it is (like me), it's pretty much a potato cake. The potato is mashed and mixed together with cheese, onions, and prosciutto, then fried and topped off with a cilantro vinegar. \\n\\nI cannot say enough great things about their pasta... I mean just WOW. You can tell that it's made fresh and it is cooked to absolute perfection. I have never had pasta this good or cooked this well. I didn't even realize pasta could be this good. Who cares about watching carbs when it tastes this good?! \\n\\nWe decided to do the wine pairing instead of ordering a bottle of wine. I'm no wine expert so our server did the pairing for us. All of the wines were great and perfectly paired with our food. Our server did a great job of giving us a detailed explanation of each wine including origin, flavor, and why she chose to pair it with our dish. All together, we tried 8 different wines. \\n\\nSpeaking of our server.. the service is absolutely impeccable. Our server was great - extremely attentive and very well spoken. Our plates were whisked away as soon as we finished our last bite and we were given new utensils for every course. Also.. we were celebrating a few special occasions and we were congratulated by multiple people, including the chef who sent out a special message on our dessert and even gave us some cookies. \\n\\nOverall, this had to be one of the best dining experiences I've ever had. From ambiance, to service, to food, to wine, to EVERYTHING. I'll be back Frasca.. don't you worry. I'm currently trying to convince my boyfriend that we need to come back everytime they change the menu. Not going to lie...

We started with the Bufala Mozzarella e Melanzane, which was tomato slices, balsalmic reduction, big slices of bufalo mozzarella, on top of panko crusted eggplant - $18. The mozzarella melted in your mouth, and was definitely the best part of this starter.\\n\\nI had the spaghetti quattro, which is their signature pasta dish. It is made up of black beans, ground chicken, tomato sauce and chillies. Normally, I wouldn't go for spaghetti, but I was convinced by die hard Quattro fans, and the dish did not disappoint. It is a very unique take on the traditional spaghetti and the flavours and heat are unparalleled. It's a little greasy, but that just leaves plenty of room for foccacia dipping. Oh, their foccacia is also really good. Super rosemary-y and salty with big chunks of rock sea salt. You can also ask for some of their homemade bread sticks too. \\n\\nMy friend had the seafood linguini, with scallops, and dill in a cream sauce. I had a taste and it was also excellent - a mild flavour, but that could just be in contrast to my spaghetti dish. \\n\\nThey have 10 different $10 pasta dishes to choose from and I'm looking forawrd to trying them all, especially the Fettuccine Ghiottone - fettuccine with minced chicken, in a brandy cream!"},{"name":"Umami","address":"1704 Beacon St","city":"Brookline","stars":"4","text":"I haven't been here in probably over a year - but the few times that I did go there I was impressed.

Better cook too much and keep your customer happy. There is a LOT of competition for good BBQ in Portland so to run out of a BBQ staple like ribs is foolish business sense. Also frustrating is the fact that when I called them to order ribs today, every time I called their number, it went direct to voicemail and the box was full so you could not leave a message. I don't what message you are supposed leave, but had they answered the phone I could have been told they were out of ribs and save me having to waste my time driving there to be told they are out of ribs.

In a small town like ours with several options for pizza of all things, you would think they would make service a priority. I can't say that I will be returning to Cappellos anytime soon.

My husband and I like to share dishes when we dine out because we have similar tastes and we want to try as many menu items as possible, so we ended up ordering 2 appetizers and 1 entree.

What she ended up doing was bringing out each course, one at a time, with a different wine pairing for that particular dish. Each course was split into two individual plates so that my husband and I wouldn't have to serve ourselves and we each received a glass of the 3 different wines. The wines paired perfectly with each of the 3 dishes we had; the wild boar (our favorite pick of the evening), the hand pies (African street food) and the lamb two ways. At the end of our meal we chose to share the African coffee creme brulee. This was by far the most outstanding creme brulee we have ever had. The waitress also brought us out two shots of Amarula African Creme Liqueur to pair with our creme brulee.
