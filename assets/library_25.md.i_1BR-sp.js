The menu has a lot of variety and seemed like fine dining meets comfort bistro food. We ordered a handful of appetizers for the group and my favorite was either the octopus or the stuffed calamari. The octopus was cut into very thin sheets which I've never had that preparation previously. It gave it more of a delicate texture and less intense flavor but I liked it a lot. The stuffed calamari was also super delicious and the filling complimented the large sized squid well. For dinner I had the gnocchi which I frequently order at Italian restaurants. The gnocchi noodles were cooked to perfection and the veggies on top were also delicious. The only thing I didn't love was that the sauce with it wasn't anything special.

I got more beans than anything else (which the bartender apologized for while also apologizing for his incompetent kitchen). The shrimp tasted like it was dropped to the bottom of the freezer section in Wal-Mart for a year and then promptly microwaved and placed on these nachos. The sprinkle of shredded cheese didn't even completely coat the top layer of chips. All the chips below that top layer were totally void of any ingredients whatsoever and the ones on the bottom were soaking in a pool of room temperature liquid. Did I mention, along with several other reviewers, how creepy and empty this place is.

It's an interactive chance to have a cook in front of you in hibachi style cooking. Having that said make sure you have an experianced chef in front of you if you want to have the best time. Also be very careful when ordering because if you are looking for prices, platters also start and end with P and S this mistake was made with other people in the table because in platters combination sizes in bold letters is not the prices but size in ounces what I thought I was getting for 28 dollars I payed about 40 dollars for. This is not their fault it's just a note when ordering for you guys. Moving on the meal for 21 dollars includes a Sirloin, fried rice, salad, onion soup, vegetables, and noodles 6 courses for 21 dollars pretty awesome. Usually much is left over when the cook is cooking in front of you if you want to have left overs make sure when he asks if you want more for him to clear the flat top say yes! better value haha! Anyway the best in the whole thing was the fried rice, the vegetables were okay, the soup portion was a little small, the noodles were spot on, the sauce on the salad was delicious and the meat did not have much flavor but you have sauces to add so it's acceptable. For birthdays the manager comes out with drums and sings for you and brings a little cupcake. What should not go unnoticed is the amount of service you receive. You have a seperate guy taking your order, filling your drinks, another cleaning, another cooking in front of you and another seperating all the checks and everyone is there all the time. I didn't have to ask for anything. I thought of it and it was there already. Outstanding!

The egg patty as opposed to cracked egg also was a much cleaner option, and made it so much easier to eat!\\n\\n A burger wouldn't be complete without a side of fries, and probably our favorite part was the Parmesan Truffle Fries - truffle oil, Parmesan, chives, truffle aioli. These are on the shareable menu, and come with a very generous portion designed for sharing. They are shoestring fries, and fried perfectly, with just the tight crisp, yet soft in the center. The Parmesan/truffle combo is probably the best of any we've had, and each bite you get the full flavor in each bite. To be honest, probably some of the best fries we've found recently, and would absolutely go back just to grab these!\\n\\nFor those looking to track calories, they even offer a full nutrition menu and allergy menu on their website, which is a unique feature for a burger spot!

(I have a hard time keeping surprises to myself and accidentally blurted it to him). Hy's is in its own standing building with mansion-like features like dark oak, rich red velvet upholstery, and a brick hallway leading from the lounge to the dining room.   \\n\\nWe were seated in a romantic two person table with a great view of the steak grill. I did my Yelp homework prior to arriving and knew what menu items we had to try. I ordered the table side Caesar salad, cheese bread as appetizers. We've never had table side service before, so having the waiter prepare the Caesar salad from scratch and within 5 minutes was a very unique experience we thoroughly enjoyed. Not to mention it was the best Caesar salad we both had ever had. The cheese bread was delicious too!  Very buttery and extremely cheesy! \\n\\nFor entrees, Chewy ordered his favorite cut- bone-in rib steak. I opted for the steak and lobster since I love seafood. We both had the steaks medium rare with mashed potato as the side. The entrees were perfectly prepared and delectable! The steaks were a perfect medium rare and flavored to perfection- not too salty (my previous experiences from steaks is its far too seasoned). The lobster tail was also perfectly prepared and came with hot butter that remained hot with its own candlelit burner. The mashed potato had the option of being dressed with scallions, sour cream, bacon bits, and butter- just like a baked potato! Chewy said it was one of the best mashed potatoes he has ever had. \\n\\nWe were very stuffed from the appies and entrees.  But since it was a birthday,  we had to order dessert. Our server, Bonnie, recommended Hy's famous cheesecake.  He says it's like NY cheesecake with berries. In my OpentTable reservation, I had mentioned that we were celebrating Chewy's birthday.  So it was great that he brought out the cake with a candle. Bonnie even sang Happy Birthday with me to Chewy. \\n \\nUpon leaving,  Bonnie told us to go upstairs to the second lounge and check out their happy hour menu which is offered Monday to Friday, 3:00-5:30pm. This was a great tip since I didn't even know Hy's offered HH. It's not stated on their website. After we got our coats from the hostess, we ventured upstairs.  Their HH offers excellent deals on some signature items like Caesar salad (probably not prepared tableside) and cheese toast! We look forward to trying those selections in the near future.

The smell of BBQ was familar to my nose as I walked home from high school every day. I finally gave it a try a few days ago and while it didn't fill the high expectations I set for it, it was a good meal overall.\\n\\nFirst off, I ordered the baby back ribs as it seems to be their specialty. It was kind of a long wait, and reading from the reviews, it seems your waitstaff is hit or miss. Mine was pretty nice and came back to check on me often. When the food came, it smelled DELICIOUS. Of course, I dug in right away and while it wasn't the best ribs I've had, it really did \\"fall off the bone\\" as they rightfully say on their sign. You get a good amount of food, a side of salad (though dressing cost extra? ridic.), and a good meal for the price\\n\\nOverall, it is a establishment that, while not the best, has a traditional sit-down-and-eat feel to it and with the tender ribs, how could you go wrong trying out Floramos?\\n\\nP.S. To all these reviewers who are bashing Chelsea, you all sound ridiculously pretentious. One reviewer talked about serving on paper plates being a Chelsea thing? Ridiculous. My visit didn't include any paper plates, and I guarantee you if you go to any other restaurants in Chelsea, you will be served good food on a legitimate plate.

Service, can be A LOT better, but typical black establishment server behavior.\\nBut this new location on Main St. ought to be ashamed of themselves. My first visit on a Thursday, June 14th...main eating area empty, server told me and my sister that those were reserved tables. I questioned, \\"during happy hour?\\" She stated, \\"YES,\\" and stated that standing by another guy co-worker. Before leaving, I inquired who was the manager, turns out the guy co-worker standing next to the server was in fact the manager. I asked him is that common practice to make reservations during the happy hour time and he said, \\"No,\\" then he states, \\"and I heard the server tell you something that was not true of our policy and I apologize.\\" I asked, \\"if what you knew she was saying was not true, why didn't you either correct her or help us correctly.\\" He stood there looking goofy, so my sister asked for complimentary drinks for our inconvenience. \\nNext visit, same location...a party of three this time on yet, another Thursday, June 28th...no problems with the seating, or so we thought. Our party consistently ordered food and drinks and about 2 hours later, we were the only guest asked to move from our table because of a reservation. There was a completely empty table behind us that they said they had no use for, no other guests who arrived before and after us were asked to move. We were informed they wanted our table, period.

The beef itself had a bunch of cartilage running through it which gave it a nice texture and was pretty tasty. However, the noodles were a bit too soft for my liking and the broth, while wonderfully spicy, surprisingly lacked some flavor (although it's possible I couldn't taste it as much because my tongue was on fire).\\n\\nI've never had Beijing crepe before, so I don't have anything to compare it to, but I thought it was good! I don't think it's something I'd get again, but I could tell it was authentic (although maybe a bit pricey).\\n\\nThe star here was the mala. I'd actually originally ordered the beef noodle soup, but after stealing a bite from my boyfriend's meal (mala over ramen), I couldn't stop picking at it. Luckily, my boyfriend understands my demanding appetite/is just sweet overall, and swapped dishes with me. While I would say Mala in Allston is the best restaurant for this specific dish, IQ Kitchen's version is almost just as good! The dish was numbingly, deliciously spicy and hit all of my cravings.

I asked Lauren if I could get an email confirmation or anything so that I can be sure we will be seated and taken care of on Easter morning. She said that was not necessary she had written down my information my name in the party count of 15 guest and that we were confirmed for Easter at 11:30 AM. \\n\\nYesterday when we arrived at 11:25 am we were told by the \\" front end manager\\"  with glasses and gauges in his ears ( refused to give me his name)  that they didn't have our information and they decided to change it to \\"first come first serve\\" except for a few people who made a reservation.

I asked him to write it down his name and the general managers name and he refused. I asked to use his pen so I can write it down and he told me to leave the premises. This is the absolute worst place I have ever been to and we were treated as a problem instead of making a solution he just flat out refused to seat us. I can't imagine any restaurant management being ok with this treatment. I had saved my phone call log as a screen shot with time, name of employee that took my reservation.

The place gets packed, so if you want a productive day I suggest getting there during times when it is not busy so you can find a seat. \\n\\nBest things:\\nWhat made this place memorable: the unique set up of the whole place really made me feel relaxed and calmed. The environment is set up in a way that creates a peacefulness vibe. \\nDrinks: I personally loved the drinks especially the sakura soda. The different kinds of Asian teas they have also grabbed my attention. The Rose tea (the only one I have tried) was very refreshing and almost made me feel one with nature. \\n\\nBad things:\\nWhat I wanted to forget: The food quality was not the best, it was very mediocre. Especially their lunch menu. I had the Onigiri and an Oyakadon. These were definitely not worth the expensive price they were sold at. The Oyakadon was 75% rice, and the Onigiri was very subpar. They were still decently good, but I would definitely not order food for lunch again. \\n\\nOverall: This place is a great/perfect place for a cafe.

From the dated plastic covered menu's , to the generic dinning room furniture.The Chef statue at the front door told me that This place could use a visit from Gordon Ramsey. There is nothing made from scratch, Its one step up from cafeteria food. The decor, the cheap silverware and plastic cups. Everything was sticky.There is absolutely no attention to detail on the consistency of the meals we were served. The salad,or chopped romain, was obviously prepared in a huge vat and dished out. My wife had no cukes and way too many onions. I got several romain hearts and no onions. It didnt even look appealing. And the dressing is obviously packaged, and anyone telling you its homemade is lying. My surf and turf combo was terrible. The stuffed shrimp were bland. The ribs sauce was definately not made from scratch, M/R tips were well done and very chewy.  Furtheremore there is no way that they were cooked to order,they came out way to fast for how rhey were cooked, and it wasnt hot. My wife ordered the seafood mix. Everything was steamed and unappealing to look at. The meal sat in watery butter and wine sauce, I guess. What ever it was it wasn't good. Our waitresses never did a check back after she dropped her meals, and you would think while clearing and hardly anything was touched she would have asked a) if eveything was ok or b) we wanted to take it home. Which she didnt.There wasnt any type of table visit, or manager precence. She also never came back to see if my wife wanted another beer. After she dropped the meal. I only had water, nothing screams quality like a blue plastic coke cup. On the way out, no one made eye contact, asked how everything was, or wished us a good day.If you have been \\"Coming here for years\\" GOOD for you.  Thats why they make chocolate and vanilla.

We can usually order one thing and split it between the two of us.  Excellent perks and deals here too, such as free chips and salsa bar on Thursdays, $5 Long Islands, Mimosa and Bloody Mary bar on weekends, and a free pint glass on Father's Day.  They're also much cleaner than their companion location of Charlie's. They do a great job of things like this to keep us coming back.  And everything we've eaten here has been pretty darn good.  So it's pretty consistent.\\n\\nWhy I'm only giving three stars is due to the service.  The first couple times we went to Hooligan's, the service was fine.  Friendly and pretty quick.  The last time we went, it was noon on a Sunday, and there were only about 8 tables total.  The staff had a bartender and two servers, yet they were incredibly overwhelmed and acting like they were understaffed, to the point of even asking an older couple who came in if they wouldn't mind sitting at the bar so they could evenly distribute tables among the servers.  Pretty unprofessional to me.  On top of that, we waited over 30 minutes for a salad to arrive, and around 45 minutes for some specialty fries.  Considering how long we waited, the fries were still under cooked.  Maybe having a drink while we waited would have been nice, but they ran out of the cider we both wanted (only one of us could have a glass) and \\"couldn't figure out how to set up the keg\\" to get one for me.  All of these things add up to, I don't know, maybe even a simple \\"sorry for your wait.\\"  I'm not even asking for a discount or something free to make up for it, but just the simple acknowledgement would have been nice.  It was a Sunday morning, hardly busy, so it just didn't really make sense to me.\\n\\nAnyway, we'll still probably return due to the food being good and huge portions.

Unfortunately last night something was noticeably different, and that was the portions.  The burgers/buns/toppings were significantly smaller than in the past, so much so that we immediately noticed it.  While the burger was still great, the price becomes a little bit harder to swallow if I'm getting a good difference in portion.

We had some friends recommend us Terry Black's which was good, but their brisket did not compare against La BBQ's. Like some other Yelpers recommended, we arrived here an hour before opening. It's located inside a store that sells beer and snacks so we were able to wait inside in an air conditioned room. I don't think we really needed the full hour since people did not start showing up till 30 minutes prior to opening (but go an hour if you want to be sure). The line does move slow since there is only one register. \\n\\nBetween two people, we ordered half a pound of brisket, half a pound of pork ribs, one chipotle sausage link, and potato salad. Everything was delicious, but I think their brisket stands out against everything else. It's fatty, juicy, and just melts in your mouth! I saw a good amount of people order the beef ribs, but it was massive. Maybe next time if we're ever visiting the city. \\n\\nOverall, this is my #1 pick for BBQ in Austin. I'm comparing this against Terry Black's and Salt Lick. It was definitely worth it for us to choose this place over Franklin's since we only waited an hour. From what I was told by a local waiting in line, the owner used to work Franklin's BBQ so it is just as good...but that could be rumors! Also, if 1 hour is still too much of a wait for you, there is an option to pre-order and pick up at the window to the side of the building."},{"name":"la Barbecue","address":"2027 E Cesar Chavez St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"Who doesn't love a free sample of delicious, falling apart brisket? \\n\\nI'm definitely not a BBQ connoisseur whatsoever.

We also tried a side of the chipotle cole slaw and potato salad. \\n\\nThe sides are pretty standard. Potato salad had more a mustard flavor than mayo which I liked. Chipotle cole slaw has a nice kick of heat in it. Very unexpected from a cole slaw but good. BF said the slaw was a tad bit too salty for him though. We probably will skip the sides from now on. \\n\\nAmazing BBQ meat! Brisket had a great smokey outer layer with a peppery crust. Just nothing like I tasted before. Pulled pork was succulent as well. I love the sausage too! But the star is the brisket. \\n\\nThey have two sauces: tangy and sweet. Tangy is vinegar based and has a great tang but too tangy for me.

Ever since they opened we have been loyal costumers coming by in avg 3 times a week! So, what is Olia? It is family run business that offers an awesome blend of Hawaiian-Vietnamese cuisine in the South Waterfront. They offer Hawaiian style poke, musubi, Vietnamese banh mi and spring rolls. \\n\\nWhy do we love this place? First of all food is amazing! Second, I have a severe pepper allergy so eating out in restaurants is an opportunity that I rarely get. Since day one the owners took my allergy very seriously. They took the time to review all the ingredients in their dishes and if there was something I could not have, when possible, they went out of their way to provide a modified version for me! What?! So awesome! Quite honestly, I don't expect restaurants to do this but, when modified versions are available for me I am beyond grateful. To have found a place where I feel safe at all times is something very special to my heart. \\n\\nLet's talk about the food? Thankfully to their amazing accommodations I have been able to have at least one item from each of the dishes they offer\\n1) Poke Bowl: I love making my bowl with Ota Tofu, Tofu with scallions and raw Tuna whether is with rice or a mixed of rice/kelp noodle that dish is always amazing! All bowls toppings are customizable once you decide your protein (you have 2 and 3 choices of protein). So you can mixed match flavors to your hearts desire! \\n2) Vietnamese Banh Mi: my favorite is the Ota Tofu Bahn Mi sans the jalape√±os of course. Where do I start with this? the French baguette is perfection! And all the ingredients are so fresh and super tasty! Perfect balance of crunch, freshness and softness. \\n3) Spring Rolls: options from shrimp, pork and tofu and for the sauce you can choose between peanut sauce or fish sauce. This dish is always so clean, and the ingredients are super fresh!! Plus their fish sauce is the bomb dot com!\\n4) Musubi: I became obsessed with Musubi from the first time I visited Hawaii. And ever since that trip I always try to find a place that makes a version that reminds me of Hawaii all over again. I love their musubi so delicious but my favorite part is the unexpected crunch. They add fried onion and let me tell you the crunchy effect form those fried onions is something to try! So much flavor it is incredible!\\n\\nAmbiance: I love their ambiance, it is clean, spacious and the best part is all the windows. Even on a gray day this place is bright. All tables close to the wall have plenty of outlets making this place a nice study spot. Bright, clean, spacious spot always makes studying so much better!\\n\\nLastly, as a new mom finding a place with a baby changing station is always plus. This place has a bathroom with a baby station!

They also have pickle hot sauces and pickle vinaigrette. All very tasty. \\n\\nIt was a quiet Sunday evening with few customers. Our fried pickles came out quickly and piping hot. Very crunchy exterior and salty sour juiciness on the inside. The pickle ranch dip was the perfect addition.  It was crying for a beer (they are in the process of applying for a beer /wine license so no suds today). \\n\\nWe got the fried chicken sandwich and an egg salad sandwich, plus a queso mac and cheese and green beans. The egg salad sandwich was great. It was creamy and eggy and the pickle relish inside was crunchy and salty - perfect pairing. The toasted croissant was a very good base for it. Unfortunately, I wasn't so crazy about the chicken sandwich (not bad but it didn't do anything for either of us at the table), mac (run of the mill), or beans (dull). Everything needed salt. I can sorta see why they go light on salt given the saltiness of the pickles but some of the food lacked flavor. \\n\\nWill probably be back for fried pickles and egg salad.

Ive long perused your North End neighborhood in search of something special, in a sea of so called \\"amazing\\" Italian dining. How many times did I walk by you over the years, completely obviously to the treasure that lied between your walls. Search no more...fork drop. (Symbolic of course, don't want to cause a scene). \\n\\nCarmelina's serves traditional Sicilian comfort food with a Mediterranean twist. \\nA classic Italian dish, done the right way, needs no additives. Trust me I get it, I'm a purest at heart. But on a few rare occasions, a little off center can be equally as good, if not better.\\n\\nYou can bet anything coming out of the kitchen, including Pasta, is scratch made. That is very much evident after just one bite. There aren't many things more satisfying than perfectly al dente pasta. The complimentary bread is soooo good, a hybrid of focaccia and dinner roll. The penne Gorgonzola is also wonderful, but nothing beats the one and only(drum roll please)....Crazy Alfredo. \\n\\nChicken, sausage, roasted red pepper, in some sort of non traditional Alfredo sauce. It's a sight to behold. And what takes this dish over the top is the sopresatta. Subtle, yet it makes all the difference.\\n\\nCarmelina's isn't exactly a hidden gem. Not only is it on the North End's main strip, but it boasts a pretty impressive number of yelp reviews. As always, I'm late to the party. As for you fellow food lover, make your way to Carmelina's pronto. \\n\\nTip: so the reservation thing is kind of a big deal. Tables are booked at least a week out. If you are a party of 1 or 2, walkins are not only acceptable, but there's a great chance you won't be waiting long. Party of 3 or more? Absolutely no chance.

And if you knew me, that's saying something, as I'm definitely obsessed with tiramisu - it's probably one of my favorite cakes.\\n\\nThey have a matcha tiramisu that has ladyfingers soaked in sake (yay!) - if you don't know what that is, it's a Japanese alcoholic beverage. Traditionally, tiramisu would have them dipped in espresso, so this is such a nice way to get a different sweet flavor that gives the dessert a nice balancing flavor.\\n\\nAnyway, on to the rest of my experience dining here.\\n\\nAMBIENCE\\nSo they have live music on certain days. I forget which ones but I do remember they mentioned Tuesday and Saturday (the night I went). This is a nice touch to the dining experience.\\n\\nSERVICE\\nI'd probably say it's abysmal, but at least the people were nice. First off, our waitress was very hard to find sometimes - but I want to say that is management's fault as I think there was literally one person doing the entire back half of the restaurant. Second, ordered the lavender bubble tea. DON'T GET THIS - it's not very good - super floral like soap, and not much tea flavor (maybe lavender syrup + milk). But that's not the kicker - apparently our order had been doubled up for no reason. Also, when we asked for the second \\"to go\\" (before ordering dessert), the drink disappeared and never came back to us (why did you steal my bubble tea ToT?). Third, when we asked for our candles to be lit (after they lit every table but ours), they never came back. Finally, I checked in and got a free green tea (yay) but when I asked the waitress about the teas, she suggested the mild one (I believe UMAMI) that's most popular (I asked for which one has the most tea flavor) - so I try this based on her recommendation and it literally tasted like water with a slight hint of tea (maybe). But that wasn't the worst part of the service...so I have a little baby sitting in the high chair and we moved all the stuff on the table to the other side out of her reach. So when the server comes by WITH PIPING HOT BOILING WATER IN A CUP...he/she puts it over her head and SMACK IN FRONT OF HER. Are you serious? You could have burned/scalded my baby - that's a lawsuit just waiting to happen. If management reads this, please PLEASE for other parents - train your employees to NOT place scalding hot drinks by an 8 month old.\\n\\nFOOD\\n1. Matcha Salmon over Ginger Sweet Potato Pur√©e: I didn't order this because I was worried about ginger being overpowering but it actually was remiss, which I enjoyed a lot. Baby did too. I couldn't see or taste the matcha, but the salmon was cooked to perfection: crispy on the outside, juicy on the inside.\\n2. Sesame Encrusted Tuna: think lightly seared tuna with sesame on the outside. Kind of like a deconstructed roll. A lot of rice, though. I can't say this was a mind blowing dish though.\\n3. Pork Tenderloin over Matcha Mashed Potatoes: love the mashed potato, though again you couldn't taste the matcha but the color was there. Potatoes were good - tasted better with the next dish (Beef Tenderloin) but the pork was overcooked, under-seasoned and very dry.\\n4. Beef Tenderloin over Veggies: beef was cooked to a perfect medium/medium-rare. However, the sauce was VERY salty (too much soy sauce maybe). As a result, the veggies ended up being too salty to eat. Also, you have uncooked raw red onion in the mix which is an added flavor that could be omitted (less is more here). Honestly, I ended up mixing the matcha potatoes from above in this dish which brought up the dish to 100. If they take suggestions, I'd pair the beef with the potatoes (the normal mix you'd see anywhere else).\\n\\nDRINKS\\nSteer clear of the ones I ordered (umami green tea and lavender bubble tea) Can't say anything about their other drinks.\\n\\nDESSERT\\n1. I already talked about the lovely tiramisu so won't go in excess here, but it was served in a nice glass and was plenty for sharing.\\n2. Yuzu and blackberry cheesecake: decent but would go for tiramisu again over this hands down. Yuzu flavor is there, which is refreshing.\\n3. Chamomile Cr√®me Br√ªl√©e: could not taste any chamomile, but the idea was nice. However, I still liked this dessert since it was nice and light, not too sweet and the sugar on top wasn't too burnt or hard (right amount). However, you only get a really thin amount of custard as the ramekin is very shallow. If you're looking for a small dessert, go for it.\\n\\nPRESENTATION\\nGot to say the dishes were all nicely presented. With the exception of the cheesecake, but at least that tasted nice."},{"name":"Era's Tiny Diner","address":"4549 NE Cully Blvd","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"Right now, Era's Tiny Diner burger is my very most favorite burger in all Portland.

Three of our party of five entered explaining the other two people were parking and would be in in a moment. We were shown to a table, and literally immediately greeted by a waitress who asked if she could take our order while we were standing taking off our coats and not having yet been given menus. We explained we were waiting for others and sat down. In less than (literally) 30 seconds she returned asking if we were ready to order. We again explained we would be waiting for the rest of our patty to arrive and would be a while. Our party arrived a moment later and we opened our menus. Without detailing each instance she (and others) returned no less than 5 more times in the following ten minutes, including interrupting a discussion clearly occurring at the table about what best to order. (We also had a child with us who was unfamiliar with the Indian menu and was clearly having things described and explained to him) Finally one member of our party who was upset by the insistent pressure started ordering throwing us into a momentary chaos and resulting in angry people and a decidedly less than pleasant vibe for the rest of the visit. \\n\\nKeep in mind they were not trying to close, (other patrons were arriving) she did not appear to be trying to end her shift as she was still there taking new parties at the end of our meal, we had not sat there for anything close to a long or unreasonable amount of time (all of this occurred within 10 minutes of coming in the doors) nor was it a language issue. \\n\\nIt was just bizarre and annoying. Also this wasn't a case of a brusque mom and pop shop type service, they had a staff of professional servers. Nor was it miscommunication between multiple servers as each of the several who pestered us was told we needed more time only to ignore it and continue to pressure us.\\n\\n(As an aside, we seemed to be the only table not served chutney or Papadum, a small issue, but something some of us were looking forward to)\\n\\nI know one person's server grudge should not be a reason for lost stars or bad reviews and certainly (hopefully) YMMV.

I think they have a lot of great dishes that you typically would not order for take out. The decor is just regular, like most Chinese restaurants the atmosphere is not really their main focus.

I could probably eat this entire dish by myself. They cut up the lobster in a way where it is pretty easy to just pick out the lobster meat.\\n\\nWest Lake Beef Soup - if you are a big fan of scallions and cilantro you will love this soup. If not please stay away because it is all over and impossible to pick out. This is basically an egg drop soup with minced beef, scallions and cilantro. It is super flavorful, the texture is a bit corn starchy but not too heavy at all. \\n\\nHouse Roast Beef - the most tender beef dish at GG. I love the sauce that comes with this! It sort of reminds me of steak tips but Chinese style of course. \\n\\nSalt & Pepper Soft Shell Crab - super crispy and lightly breaded soft shell crab. just amazing!\\n\\nI'm confident that there are other delicious things on the menu but these are my top choices.

Slow, confused, dispassionate and disconnected. \\n\\nIf you're going to plate food at this level, and put on the air of a high-level eatery, the service has got to match that--or the whole thing is off.

She did some quick checking and found National Carpet Care.  They seemed reputable, had been in business a long time and was a local option, which was important.  The original technician that came out was in our home approx. 45 minutes, and cleaned approx. 700 sf of carpet.  After the technician left, our carpet was sticky.  My wife called and spoke to Clint, and while he was rude, set up a technician to return the follow day.  Great I thought.  My mistake.  I arrived home to sloppy wet carpet.  16 hours later and it's still wet and now really sticky.\\n\\nI was not happy so I called and spoke to Clint.  Wow.  Unprofessional to say the least.  He offered to send a technician out to advise me of a solution but he would have to charge to remove the stickiness.  What?  He then stated it was our fault for the stickiness because my wife \\"occasionally\\" pre-treats the carpet for spilled stains.  Huh? On the entire surface of the carpet?  In ALL 4 rooms?  I asked for an MSDS sheet for the chemicals he used as Im going to get a chemist friend of mine to sample the carpet and tell me what's in it.  He passed me off to some website.  I wonder if OSHA would have something to say about him not being able to provide MSDS sheets to his customers on request.  I have no doubt I will find too much of his product in my carpet, hence why he sent a tech to come back and \\"maintenance\\" clean our carpets again.\\n\\nHe states he has millions of happy customers.  Where are they?  All I see on this website is unhappy people.  His demeanor is unprofessional, condesending, and disrespectful not only to my wife, but to me.\\n\\nClint, you state customers \\"like us\\" get on the internet and give good companies bad names.  If holding businesses that provide service to me and my family accountable for inadeqauate service and workmanship, no matter the price, yes, I am one of those.  Your problem Clint is that you truly don't respect your customers, the buying power they have, or their right to voice their opinion.  My wife and I aren't unreasonable people and we understand good value isn't always affected by price.  Simply put, our carpets have been cleaned professionally before, and we've never experienced sticky carpet.  We've only experienced this after using your service.  If you feel that offering us that you could come out for an additional charge is good customer service, you are mistaken.  If offering to send a technician out to look at the carpet causing one of us to take off work is acceptable, you are mistaken.\\n\\nFear not Clint.  I will be glad to share the praises, or lack of in this case with those that will listen.  Not because of your rudeness, or lack of respect.  Simply for the fact that, IN MY OPINION, you did not perfrom a service worth paying for, AT ANY COST.\\n\\nSo maybe you are right in your statement that I'm \\"that customer\\".  I CHOOSE to warn my fellow consumers about a bad experience I had with your company.  I choose not to EVER use your company for any service.  Large companies like Subway and Kraft can change their perception about how important customers are to them (recent news items) and how unhappy customer can affect their bottom line.  Someday, Clint, I hope you wake up.

There's a large amount of staff buzzing about and plates were never sitting for long, drinks filled, and all the buffet pans well filled. This was a Saturday afternoon trip and while not completely full, the place was quite busy.\\n\\nThere are 6 full buffet bars, plus a wrap-around bar for the hibachi, sushi and desserts. There is a LOT to be consumed here.\\n\\nMy first review is always the sushi, because buffet sushi can be scary. This was not the case. Everything I ate was fresh, and they had a fairly decent sampling of nigiri aside from some more complex rolls - two things that are not common on most sushi bars in buffets. While not amazing sushi, it was quite good considering lunch is only $8 and it's AYCE.\\n\\nI did not opt to eat from the hibachi or salad bars, but they were both very fresh looking and had a great variety. Again, picky eaters can really indulge here and get exactly what they want.\\n\\nThe hot bars had a great mixture of regular chinese dishes with a few less common items thrown in, as well as some American items like ham, pizza and french fries. Everything was moving well, pans were consistently filled, and nothing seemed like it sat for long. I was pleased to find that some of my favorites like chicken and broccoli were not overly salty or mushy, and the grilled chicken skewers and pot stickers were not dried out.\\n\\nOverall, a great extensive selection, fresh, and cheap.

Prob a one and done type of deal for me unless someone else is waiting for me lol. Tried two bbq places and this one was my favorite. The meats were well seasoned (more heavily, and more pepper-y FYI) and the barbecue sauces were phenomenal. Meats we tried:\\n\\nBrisket (of course)--MUST GET. This is sooo fatty and flavorful and the first bite truly blew me away. Really really well done. \\n\\nBeef rib--heard these often sell out but we were lucky enough to get our hands on one. One rib is GINORMOUS. Meat is super tender and easily shredded off. Was very good but a little too fatty and not as special and not my favorite of the assortment. \\n\\nShredded pork--again just so tender and flavorful but without overshadowing the actual pork itself. Goes perfectly with the recommended lighter colored bbq sauce. \\n\\nSmoked turkey--so tender for such a lean protein, and such great smoky flavor to it. Went great with the sauce and was a nice contrast to all the beef.\\n\\nChipotle coleslaw was a nice complement and good, even though I don't usually like coleslaw.

Generic, unimpressive, and lacked any sense of passion in the cooking.  10 thin slices of pork in a flavorless concoction of sauce and vegetables.  There was more baby corn and broccoli in the plastic tub than there were meat.  It was seriously a big waste of $18 dollars.  The worst still was the menu labeled this dish as \\"spicy\\".  Not an ounce of spice.  There wasn't anything to this Hunan Pork dish.  No spice.  No flavor.  No passion.  No effort.\\n\\nBiggest waste of $18.

Their whole process of order at the front, then go to the back to pick up your own food someone shoved through a slot in the wall just seems weird to me.

They have some classic ramen dishes such as tonkotsu and shoyu, while also having some more interesting ramen dishes with foie gras or a spicy Korean soft shell crab ramen.. The sushi rolls could be bigger since they look a little small for the price point of around $11-$13. My biggest complaint however is the service. My server was an older Asian women and although her English wasn't very good my biggest problem was the fact that she took forever to get us our checks. Not only did it take a long time for orders to get placed in but she delivered our food all at once rather than when it was ready as we had asked. In addition once we are finished eating there was trouble splitting our checks and in applying a coupon code for Yelp restaurant week.

This intrigued me, wanting to find out further more the mystique behind this place.  So for my first UYE (back in March), I wanted to plan a \\"Redemption\\" for this place and give it a nice unbiased chance.  Mind you, 5 months later, and here I am.  Due to the restricted days this place was open, trying to get a time together was pretty difficult.  Also mind you, this place is across the street from Turner Field, so finding a night where this place isn't mobbed made it more difficult.  \\n\\nHell, even one night, we made the trek only to find it damn closed (however I called earlier in the day and they said they were open).  So I had to \\"cancel\\" the event, and make plans for an incognito visit.  I was dying to try this place.  Last Thursday, it finally happened.  \\n\\nThere was a group of 4 total, and we were the only people.  It gave me a warm fuzzy feeling when I pulled up and my friends were inside (meaning it was open, yay!).  The first thing I noticed was the decor.  It reminded me of almost a man's private barn in the 50's- tons of pinups, old signs, and the wooden beams.  I liked it!  All of the seats were made out of jeans, pockets and all, never seen anything like that before.\\n\\nThe next thing I noticed, was the menu- it had some innuendos on there to say the least.  It also had a few things with an Asian flair (yes, they even have BBQ Banh Mi!).  Everything almost seemed like it was priced and portioned where you could order 2-3 things if you wanted to and still only spend $12-16PP and leave full.  With that being said, I ordered 6 wings, a 1/2 rack (sold in 1/4 racks) of baby backs, and a cup of \\"Buford Highway\\" Brunswick Stew.\\n\\nSince I have read the 34 previous reviews of this place and quite honestly, I didn't know what to expect, so I was in for a treat.  The first thing that came to us was a plate of fried collards- something I have never seen.  Honestly, they were pretty damn good!  So at least one thing was right!  The stew came out, I liked it, as it was made with a lime-chicken broth and had some unconventional ingredients. I enjoyed that.\\n\\nThe one bad thing though is they told us the spare ribs (which I originally ordered) were not done cooking yet, so I had to get the BB ribs, but they said they wouldn't upcharge us (as the BB were more $$).  The ribs and wings came out and another thing I noticed- I have NEVER in my life seen a dry rub that looked like that.  By the time I was done I realized that there was a ton of meat on those bones (wings and ribs), and that rub was tasty, still trying to figure out the flavors (I know cumin and brown sugar were 2 of the items).  They have 5 sauces to choose from (with more specialty as well, for extra$$); I chose the Hotlanta.  I only used it on one bone on each, not because I didn't like the sauce, I just enjoyed the spice rub that much.\\n\\nOur server was very friendly as well, a huge plus (as I heard from previous reviews that wasn't the case, total BS).  The back page of the menu is labeled \\"Lubrications\\" and has a decent variety of beer for a 'cue joint.  They even have a pretty cool spot you can go upstairs and order/eat/drink/party, as it has a great view of not only Turner Field, but the city as we know it.\\n\\nPlease note that there are a ton of sexual innuendos inside, so bringing a kid here could be a good idea, you just may want to steer their eyes from the chalkboard and menu(s), or you might have some explaining to do!\\n\\nI was very glad that I finally got to make it here, as it has definitely been the most unique BBQ experience I have ever endured.\\n\\nCheers!"},{"name":"Ovation Coffee & Tea","address":"941 NW Overton St","city":"Portland","stars":"5","text":"When I think of drinking coffee, I'm thinking two scenarios.

The place opened up around the same time. I love this place. It's too bad 2 of my favorite people no longer work there. I used to call in an order and soon as i give them my name, they knew exactly what i wanted and how i wanted. As you can tell, i frequent the place. \\n\\nI've read a lot of the reviews below and some of them were exactly to the T, while others were a bit harsh. \\n\\nThe thing to remember is that, this is a fastfood restaurant. Being Chinese, I am particular about my food, especially Chinese food. I want it to be a close in authenticity as possible to either my own or how i remembered my mom or grandma used to make them.  However, you will always find something different about it - especially if you're not from the Boston area. \\n\\nI have 2 kids. They're pretty picky about food as well but they will eat just about anything i pick from here. We usually order pretty much the same dishes - stir fry meats with veggies or a noodle plate. i usually ask for light sauce because i don't particularly care for a lot of soy sauce in my food. \\n\\nBeing that it's fast food - the expected wait time is usually 10 minutes or less. when they're busy - usually around lunch or dinner, it can take up to 20 minutes. It's still good. I usually call it in and by the time i walk there - 3 mins - the food's either ready or just about done. They always greet me with a smile. i would hope so - they want my money after all :) \\n\\nI've had very few issues with it. Once we asked them to add tofu to my Chicken with Broccli and they forgot. They offered to credit me back or just order it next time and they won't charge me the difference. No problems there considering how often i frequent the place. The next time i ordered - 2 weeks later - they remembered and didn't charge me and apologized. Once i ordered delivery and they used the wrong sauce. Their delivery time is pretty good - better than most places. They deliever even in the most extreme weather when you don't want to go out.\\n\\nThe place is actually pretty clean in comparison to many of the kitchens I've seen and I've seen plenty as well as worked in plenty. They do wash their hands. the cooks do too. I usually observe and observe before i purchase. It's one thing when the kitchen isn't open as theirs are, it's another when it is. \\n\\nI don't particularly order fried rice. Many it's because it's precooked already. they reheat it by restir-frying it a second time to give it the warm and texture. i don't particularly like the darkness either. so, when i do want to eat fried rice, i either make it at home, or ask for Yang chow fried rice. \\n\\nAlso, i don't care about time so much, so i always order something they have to cook fresh, nothing pre-done that require a heat up, etc. For example, Chicken or Shrimp broccoli is one of my favorites. I always ask them to not overcook the broccoli that i prefer almost al dante. \\n\\nLastly, for those of you that complain about their eat-in. The eat-in is a convenience. It's a fast food take out. it isn't a sit in. You look around Boston - or any major city - where there's a sit in only and no wait staff and tell me if there's a better place. Even if you do, there aren't many around. The area is very small. So they expect you to eat and go. they clean it up as soon as you're done eating - although i am sure it's expected that you clean up after your own mess with most people don't. they have a recycling bin. they offer free hot tea where most places do not. \\n\\nWhen it comes to authenticity, it's as close as it gets, seeing as though it's a fast food joint. If you want something much more authentic, you'd have to go to Chinatown and even that, you'd have to know the right places to go. While it's sit down, it's still catered to the demands of the many who crave for spices that are close their palets, not those of the real chinese. \\n\\nI hope this has provide some insights to this place. There are so many fast food Chinese restaurants and this is probably 1 of 3 that i will actually order from and eat in, aside from those in Chinatown."},{"name":"Dirty Martin's Place","address":"2808 Guadalupe St","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"I used to live right behind Dirty Martin's, which was truly bad for my health.

We could detect a smoke ring, but couldn't taste it.  Luckily, we had also ordered a beef rib & that did have some smoke flavor; strange, one would think both would have nearly the same amount of smoke. Both the moist brisket & beef rib meat were tender, succulent, & had the fat rendered; it's just sad that the brisket didn't taste like it had been cooked on the pit. \\n\\n\\nThey had some bottles of bbq sauce on the communal tables & 1 of them was stellar - tons of flavor & plenty of heat. Usually we skip using sauce cuz we enjoy the beef flavor along with the smoke, but we were pleasantly surprised by their hottest sauce. Had to ask for onions, not put onto tray with order like before (also wasn't sure if the pickles were complimentary anymore, so didn't ask for any); frankly, at these prices, they should give free onions & pickles with each order.\\n\\nHoping this is a 1 off & the flavor profile (bring back the smoke) of old returns.

(aside: if you are ever in a restaurant and for whatever reason ask to speak with the manager - and out waltzes a complete stranger who you've never laid eyes on before - well, that says a whole lot about that place to me.  i am much more comfortable when the manager appears and is an old familiar face that you have seen repeatedly during your visit.  \\"oh, THAT guy\\".  and by \\"guy\\" i mean the generic.  managers who are not on the floor do not impress me.)\\n\\nthe menu is interesting and unique.  we started with the crispy green beans which were lightly coated and served with an sambol aioli.  i don't know what the heck sambol is but apparently it is magic fairy dust because, let's face it, \\"aioli\\" is just a nice way of saying \\"mayonnaise\\" and mayonnaise is, well, disgusting.  and yet here i was dipping my deliciously crispy green beans into it.  repeatedly.  pretty impressive fairy dust.\\n\\nwe followed that with the grilled cheese, to which i added tomato.  it was served on delicious homemade brioche and the nice sharp cheddar they use was very tasty, but for me the bread to cheese/tomato ratio heavily favored the bread and in this day of low carbs, it was a little overwhelming.  the sandwich was served with a generous helping of sizzling shoestring fries.  personally, i might recommend something green as a side instead.\\n\\nmy date had the crepinette - a pork sausage with black pepper, paprika, and infused currants which our server accurately described - he told us that they did not use traditional casing but some other method involving something from the midsection of the pig.  i have to admit i zoned out once he had gestured the whereabouts of this non-casing (as a reluctant carnivore, i must recommend to servers everywhere against using any bodily gestures when describing meat.)  anyway, my carnivorous companion was pleased with his selection, and i helped him devour the little arugula side salad that came with it.\\n\\ni enjoyed a few \\"moscow mules\\" which were delicious and refreshing.  my date sampled a beer from their interesting beer selection and then had a expertly crafted mojito.  drinks were excellent and watching the skilled bartender make them was like watching ballet.\\n\\na couple of more things at contigo were impressive and earned them high marks with me:  a lovely and large (and dog friendly!) outdoor patio, and a spotlessly clean restroom (i know, but it matters).  so while we may not have hit on 100% with all of our food choices - our drinks, our service, and our whole experience was really enjoyable and i recommend you check them out."},{"name":"Tea Haus","address":"10815 Ranch Road 2222, Ste 207","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"I first heard about this place from my sister and brother-in-law. I can't quite remember, but either the owner(s) or co-workers are/were from ACTS, which is the church that my sister and brother-in-law go to. They were raving about this place, but honestly, I was very skeptical. Coming from Houston, which has a plethora of amazing bubble tea stores, I was highly disappointed with what Austin had to offer. I suppose I had too many bad experiences with the various bubble tea stores around Austin or maybe my expectations were too high. Either way, I judged Tea Haus too quickly.\\n\\nHonestly, I don't know if I would call Tea Haus a bubble tea store. I mean, as of 4/21/15, they only have one bubble tea drink and that's the classic boba milk tea. All the other drinks consist of teas and various types of coffee. With that said, I believe Tea Haus has the best milk tea in Austin and for that sole reason, I've decided to give this place 5 stars.\\n\\nThe store itself is also very clean and well-kept. I've never studied here, but I've seen many people do so. It seems pretty conducive to studying considering the large number of seating available and how quiet the store is.\\n\\nIn terms of food, Tea Haus seems to be famous for its Brick Toast and Basil Fried Chicken. The Brick Toast is basically toast topped with strawberries and condensed milk. It's AMAZING! To be completely honest, I'm not a big fan of the Basil Fried Chicken.

I've gone twice already, and I will probably be back later today for a quick tea fix.\\n\\nI love the \\"tea\\" flavor of the boba milk tea. Whenever I drink boba milk tea anywhere, I always compare it to the ones that I have in Taiwan. As someone who enjoyed boba milk tea in Taiwan almost every day for a month this year, I would say that Tea Haus's milk tea is really up there - the flavor of black tea is strong and the ratio of tea to milk is pretty good - creamy, but still with the refreshing tea taste that many milk teas tend to lack. The bubbles are also sweetened with longan honey rather than sugar, which is awesome - explains the more honey-esque taste of the boba. I always order it half sugar, just because I like my drinks a little less sweet. & for only $2.95 WITH boba for about a medium-sized cup, the value is great.\\n\\nI've also had a chance to try the mint blueberry lemonade (made with LOCAL blueberries and mint). The lemonade is minty and refreshing - normally not a fan of fruit and mint, but it was yummy and (also) looked pretty.\\n\\nI also got to try the grapefruit honey green tea yesterday. I'm not normally a fan of grapefruit, but...I was still not a fan after this drink. Since they use fresh grapefruit to make this, they end up putting pulp inside their drink, but also the parts of the grapefruit that make it taste bitter, so the drink ended up tasting really bitter.\\n\\nCustomer service is also great - they're always up for giving and receiving suggestions. We were the annoying customers that ordered five drinks five minutes before closing yesterday (thank you, traffic on Mopac), and the employees were still willing to answer all of our questions, give suggestions on what to order, and provide excellent customer service in general. They had run out of boba last night, so they gave us some buy one, get one free coupons. Solid. I will be back Tea Haus! I just wish you weren't so far away!\\n\\nUPDATE: I ordered their brick toast today and it was SO delicious. A bit pricey for about $5.60, but worth a treat. It's a warm, thick piece of toast, perfectly crispy, buttery, and golden on the outside and fluffy on the inside, drizzled with condensed milk, topped with fresh strawberries, and sprinkled with powdered sugar.

The balls were a little harder and chewier than I like them, but I chalk it up to going on a weekday morning.  I would try this place again when it is busier to see if the tapioca quality changes. I enjoyed the taste of the basil chicken with its cute little chopsticks. Like others have said, it is a little too salty, but the taste otherwise is excellent.  One note: don't eat this if you have to go somewhere with immaculate breath.   The garlic taste is awesome, but others won't enjoy it secondhand!  I would also probably ask for more lime next time (they give half a wedge), just because I love the acidity factor.\\n\\nI thought the setup was cute.

The salad also came with 4 crispy tortilla chips resting on the salad.  I did like the dressing, which had a nice savory, slightly spicy flavor, but it seemed like there could've been more of the pico and beans because they easily got lost in the salad from the small amount there was.  Not a bad salad, but not one i'd likely get again.\\n\\nThe sweet potato fries weren't bad at all!  I asked if they could make the fries extra crispy, how I like my fries, and they made sure to do just that.  Very cool!  The \\"side\\" of fries were actually a pretty decent size, easily shared by two people, making for a pretty good deal for the price.  \\n\\nCustomer service was good, attentive and fast, getting my meal to me in under 10 minutes.

This was a Thursday night meal around 7:45pm. \\n\\nParking.  It's down town Westerville so parking is limited to a few spots or on street.  \\n\\nSeating.  This is a small mom and pops shop with 1 server.  The kitchen area is actually bigger than the seating area.  \\n\\nService.  Sketchy.   Non existent when we first got there.  Finally got service and ordered waters and a soda along with our meal.  However the drinks did not come for another 10 min.  So total time was about 20 min before having something to drink.  \\n\\nFood.  Arrive about a total of 50 minutes after arriving.  That is just too slow.   \\n\\nPapaya salad.  I ordered extra spicy because I want it hot enough I have to stop eating it.   This came out and was not spicy enough.  But my main issue is there were waaaaay to many carrots in my salad.   It took away from the flavor of what was supposed to be a papaya dish.   \\n\\nSoup.  Soup had great flavor but was missing a lot of ingredients.  Only had chicken mushrooms and white onions topped with cilantro.   Portion size was also a bit small.  \\n\\nCalamari.  Crispy and light and overall a good dish.  However, portion size was too small.   Seeing a theme here.  \\n\\nBeef Salad.  Tons of fresh veggies.  But hardly any meat.  So they increased portion size but skimp on the meat.  This was disappointing and not really the taste of true beef salad.   \\n\\nFried egg omelette.  This was a request of mine because its a staple of thai food and they were nice enough to cook it for me.  Was probably my favorite dish.  Not enough portion though.  \\n\\nFried Rice.  Just plain bad.  Tasted like burnt oil and burnt spices.   Over powered the dish.  Way too many large veggies and the rice was too wet with oil.  Worst dish of the night.   \\n\\nNoodle dish.  Had good flavor but where are the noodles?   Every dish, they skimp on the main ingredient. Very frustrating.  The theme of dumping in scalloped carrots and veggies across every dish is very evident as fillers and screams cheap.  \\n\\nCrispy pork.  I said the fried rice was the worst but this dish was by far the worst.  It was a culmination of all things bad.  Dirty burnt oil, scalloped carrots and veggies, dried hard pork which had nothing crispy about it.  This dish was not original and not appealing.  It was more of the same.  Plate of veggies used with all the other dishes with dried pork.  \\n\\nBill came out to just over $100.   With tip closer to $120.   \\n\\nFor the price the food should have been much better.   For the actual dining experience, the bill should have been closer to $65 tops.  \\n\\nI hate paying good money for bad food.  \\n\\nI cannot recommend this restaurant based on what I experienced across a multitude of dishes.

The tables, walls, & even ceiling offered something fun to look at. A couple minutes later we were seated & were promptly greeted by our waitress, who was very pleasant. We ordered & as expected the food did take some time to come out. It was busy so we weren't surprised, and we weren't in a rush so we just enjoyed looking around. The food came out & everything we ordered was very good. A couple issues: I had a salad w/chicken & had to pull out numerous outdated pieces from the salad mix; the grits with the southern scramble weren't traditional grits - not sure what it was, it wasn't bad, just not what was expected; my coffee cup sat empty the entire time our food was there - I had to ask for a refill & didn't get it until I was done w/my meal; and although our water glasses were filled once, we could've used more water throughout our meal.

We ALL had to try Gladys Knight Chicken and Waffles. WHAT A MISTAKE. It was by far, the WORST part of the trip. I was so so so disappointed. THIS IS NOT SOUL FOOD. We waited an hour before asking if our name was coming up, to find out we had been CROSSED OFF the wait list. We were then seated. It was a rather SPECIAL experience, i.e., some of the wait staff were very very special (YELLOW BUS SPECIAL). We were excited about the experience, wanted to get a feel for everything on the menu. BIG MISTAKE. The MIDNIGHT TRAIN had missed a couple of stops (and was the only item on the menu that came with a waffle, no seasoning on the chicken, and my son who does not know how to cook could have made a better waffle. The other review was so correct, DRIED OUT AND BURNT MACARONI & CHEESE, The GREENS were not thoroughly cooked, and tasted like leaves (no flavor), the YAMS were also TASTELESS, NOT SWEET, NOT THOROUGHLY COOKED -- Gerber baby food tastes better. I thought I was ordering mashed potatoes and gravy (I know that's what I said), but I got this potatoe casserole that was just NASTY -- and too hot (spicey). I ordered CHILDS CHICKEN BASKET W FRIES for the baby. The fries were so HOT w PEPPER the baby started choking, and so did I. SWEET POTATOE CHEESE CAKE was just NASTY, not sweet, bland -- looked pretty though.  I asked for a refill on my TEA/LEMONADE \\"concoption\\" and was told that drink refills are $1.50!!!!\\nBOTTOM LINE: The price was too high, the portions were too small. This is just a gimmick. I can't tell you not to go, because it is a \\"tourist\\" attraction, but apparently \\"Gladys-N-dem don't expect return business.\\" This is a ONE-SHOT-WONDER.

Got hungry so a friend suggested we go to Hooligans. Got there and the scenery was pretty chill, our server Sarah was pretty pleasant, got us everything we asked for. I asked her about the hummus plate and she said it's \\"actually pretty good and that it's \\"homemade\\" they make it fresh in their kitchen.\\" Halfway through eating my hummus I felt a weird texture in my mouth that I could not quite chew, for a second I figured it was a chile flake... until I noticed that the texture on my tongue felt to similar to the texture on my nails so I immediately paused during my conversation and slowly pulled out a torn off finger nail straight out of my mouth, I then observed it and knew immediately without a doubt what it was. Trying to keep my cool I passed it around the table to show 7 other friends, and without a doubt they ALL CONFIRMED that it was indeed a finger nail.\\n\\nI kept my cool, And showed our server Sarah. So I presented the nail and ask her what she thought it looked like and without a pause, Sarah (waitress) said sickenly \\"it looks like a finger nail\\". She then takes the finger nail from me and takes a picture to send to her manager, I asked to get it back so I can take a picture of it she immediately pulled it as far away from me and said \\"no, I don't want you to POST this\\". And walks away. I was speechless.\\n\\nShe then returned and gave us our checks, by that time, thoughts were circulating in my head of how disgusted and sick I felt. She said that our hummus plate was removed and that she took 50% OFF our \\"HAPPY HOUR\\" nachos. not only that she gave me a \\"comp card\\" for my next visit! I was appalled of how that was handled, I told her I was never coming back and before I could finish telling her I'm from Seattle she tosses it back at me and says take it anyway.\\n \\nI was then upset at that point and told her she should have atleast taken care of our bill, which was 50%off nachos. She argued with me and ADMITTED that the nail was found in the HUMMUS and not our nacho plate and how she already gave us 50% OFF, so don't take it out on her but that it was the kitchens fault! At that point I completely lost it, never felt so disrespected and embarrassed in front of my friends.\\n\\nMy friends could see how bothered i was and suggest that it would help if I pulled her aside before I left and told her how she made me feel especially after feeling sick to my stomach, she said that was not her intentions to snap at me, she just snapped because she was \\"tired of fixing the kitchens mistakes \\" and that the owners didn't know what they were in for when they opened this joint. I sided with her and told her I was still going to write a review, but because she was so understanding at the end I almost dropped it.\\n\\nUntil Kyle P.  Finley reached out to a friend and apologized and said that he had heard about the chaos Saturday night inside the kitchen, and how I had made a mistake that it was a piece of Garlic tusk, and that it was not a finger nail and that his head chef was so embarrassed that there was even a piece of tusk in the hummus. \\n\\nNow that just made me realize I obviously need to write a review to share with the people what goes on behind the scenes!  I was so humiliated and even after the fact he covered it up and handled it in a improper manner acting as if I don't know what I saw or what your waitress took away from me. No CUSTOMER should ever have to go through the humiliation that I went through and even after the fact of making me feel like I have no idea what I saw and tasted.\\n\\nSo Kyle, if I had made a mistake.

If she's the store manager then I won't be returning to this location... I'd rather bring her something else or just go out of my way for my kid then have to deal with that kind of non professional non customer service attitude. She could have spoken to me without her attitude, she could have been a little accommodating as I wasn't asking for anything for free or something way out of the ordinary... I managed a pizza restaurant and this is def not a reason to lose a customer.

My wife ordered the a cute and tasty Thai tea, as well as red curry that was actually spicy enough for once (so many places aren't) and full of great vegetables and meat. My pineapple shrimp fried rice had a great curry flavor, solid veggies and fruits (raisins were a good touch), and was generally pretty solid. My only complaint would be that it could use more pineapple chunks.

Sometime, more than six months ago I went with my Dad and we both noticed that the quality of the meat, in the steak tips, had changed ... it was tougher and not quite as tasty.

I decided to go there today.\\n\\nAt lunch the kitchen service was so slow that the wait person apologized, When the steak tips arrived, cooked medium, three of the four were tough. The fourth one was inedible. It could not be cut with a serrated knife. I pointed this out to the waitress, showing her that it couldn't be cut. While not making a big deal about it  I expected a visit from a concerned manager ... maybe even trying to make good on the situation. Nada.\\n\\nThe side dishes were at best room temperature and the broccoli maybe even a little cold. \\n\\nLet me repeat ... this was a go to place for me ... I recommended it to people.

We had a moderately large party of 9 people and were seated in the expected timeframe of about an hour (no surprises here).  However, the oil / garlic plates were set out for more than 45min before we realized we didn't get offered any bread.  If I was alone I could care less, but we also had some very hungry young to older children in our group.  I don't think I need to elaborate further on this.  If you have children you know.\\n\\n2. The homemade pastas are legit, perfectly chewy, and clearly unique to the restaurant.  The only downside to the dish I order (Spicy Sausage Antonio) and the pizza my wife ordered was that it was probably saltier than I had expected.  Having a palate that already leans towards saltier foods and to have to admit to a food being salty says something.  Possibly a reflection of the dish and not so much the style of food.\\n\\nHad it not been for those two issues I could easily be won over to a 5-star review.  My children had kids menu spaghettis and my friends all enjoyed their meals.  The portions here are insane and makes sense based on the price.

Starting with the Mango Lassi, I really enjoyed how it didn't taste like it was made of powder. You can really taste the freshness of the mango in each sip. The Meat Samosas were made to the right level of crisp and the two dipping sauces that came with the appetizer complimented it very well. We also ordered both the Cheese and Garlic Naan and was impressed with how soft the bread was. Naan in general combines really well with any sauces that may come with your curry entree, such as curry or tikka. Last but not least, let's not forget the main entree I ordered - the Fish & Shrimp Tandoori! It came out still sizzling in the cooking pan and the flavors were so overwhelmingly delicious. I wanted even more spice to it so I had them get me an extra side of Indian hot sauce and that was the final touch to an incredible meal. We even had leftovers to being back home because everything was so filling and they give you generous portions.

Courtesy of the my fellow Yelpers and the positive reviews, I was game.\\n\\nLocation/Parking: Tacos La Villa is on Cobb Parkway in the shopping center where Goodwill and Office Depot are. Parking was pretty good since it was a shopping center parking lot. I did notice while sitting in my car that people were going there in groups of up to six, so I hurried up to get inside and in the line.\\n\\nRestaurant Details: Once I got into the restaurant, there were people everywhere. It is very small on the inside. There weren't any available tables and the line to order stretched all the way to the back where the restrooms are. I waited about 10 minutes before I was able to place a to go order. If you are looking to go here during lunch and be able to eat in, my advice would be to get there early before the lunch rush or afterwards because you more than likely will not find a seat to eat and enjoy your meal. Once I placed my to go order, I went to the salsa bar and got some salsa and then headed over to the drink machine, all the while ducking and dodging people who were also waiting on their order, going to the salsa bar, or those who were eating in and getting their order once their number was called.\\n\\nService: The guy at the register was very nice and he helped out when he could with bagging up the to go orders and he also was taking phone orders. The cooks behind the counter were working at a good speed and the food was going out fast.\\n\\nFood: As a lover of Mexican food, I must say this is as authentic as it gets and is not in the class of the traditional Tex-Mex. I've been wanting to try a \\"California\\" style taco for awhile and I got it here! I ordered the Taco Plate and it comes with three tacos with your choice of meat, rice and beans and a drink. Also, you will be asked if you want onions and cilantro on your tacos. I said yes to that. The meal was very filling and it was only $5.93! The rice was very good. The beans were a little watery but thickened up once they cooled down. They really didn't have any flavor but I ate them. The tacos were really tasty. I ordered chicken as the meat and it was well seasoned and the cilantro and onions topping paired with tomatillo salsa sprinkled with lime juice. The tacos were in corn tortillas instead of flour tortillas. I enjoyed it!!!\\n\\nI will be adding this restaurant to my list.

So much so, we made the trip from NH to Boston just to bring my mother in-law for birthday dinner. We got here early on a Saturday, around 3:30. We had no wait and were able to sit outside. Our waitress was relatively quick to get our drinks in and an order of guacamole, but seemed like she asked us 3 times if we knew what we wanted for dinner before we said ok, we were really trying not to rush. After our food order..... we RARELY saw her again. The margs we got were great. I had La Sandia and tried the Mango Chile, all delicious and fresh. The guacamole was not mashed up well, warm (a little too warm) and not flavorful. Not similar to DC. Our first round of drinks went with the app, yet we didn't see our waitress again. Stopped the manager who brought us menus, but never checked back in for an order. Not until someone brought us meals could we place another drink order (and still not our waitress). The food was delicious. I had Carnitas, and someone has Carne Assad that was also amazing. I had plenty left on my plate. My very rushed waitress did come back, scooped up all our plates in record time and didn't ask anyone if they'd like to wrap it up..... I would've taken my home so that was annoying.

The daikon and carrots they put on it completely ruins the dish, in fact.  So overwhelmingly fishy tasting it borderlines rotten.

It is right across the highway from the airport so you see it as soon as you leave.  The vibe is very dive, doesnt look like much on the outside but pretty neat place.  The interior is very basic tables and chairs and has all the standard decors and colors you see at most Mexican food places. This building has been here awhile but they make the interior work well.  Very vibrant and beautiful colors and decor. \\n\\nMenu - well it is a Mexican food place, so the menu is what you would expect. They actually have a pretty big menu and offer a lot of variety within each category.  They hit all the basics of taco salads, fajitas, enchiladas, dinner plates and so on.  I was actually quite impressed with the selection of entrees as to be honest i thought this place would only have a few things to choose from.  But i was wrong. They did have some of their own signature items which is always a good sign for a store. The one thing about the actual physical menu was that the words were printed in a very elaborate cursive that made it kind of hard to read. I'm no illiterate mo-ron, but i actually had to read some things 2 or 3 times to find out what it said.  But other than that the menu is really solid with lots to offer and a really nice variety. \\n\\nService - our service was super cute and homey.  We were greeted and sat by an older Hispanic lady who was all smiles.  We had gotten there a little after opening so we were the only ones there.  But i could tell see was sincere in her personality.  There were some other Hispanic ladies working and they all seemed really friendly. Our waitress in particular had the whole broken English or English second language going on.  For me that's a good sign as it normally means the food is more authentic or at least better than most.  I still cant get over how see was all smiles like that, like someone had sewn her mouth corners to her ears.  Anyways, she was really sweet and it felt more like being in a friends house rather that a store.  So props for genuine and inviting service.  \\n\\nFood - I came in with my family and wife to make a party of 6.  Ultimately thou between the 6 of use we only got 3 entrees.  My parents both got a taco salad, my wife and mother in law both got a black bean nacho dish, and my sister and I both got the enchilada trio.  My parents taco salad was pretty average like anywhere you would.  But the one thing about it that was great was the beef.  The beef was actually really good, seasoned well and cooked properly. It was dry or overly moist.  It also didnt have that widely use flavor that tastes like it came from a bag of Ortega or El Paso seasoning.  It was its own nice flavor.  Really good.  My wife and mother in laws nachos where pretty good too.  It was mostly just a few tortillas cut in 4ths and then fried and with the toppings poured on.  They both also asked for chicken fajita meat on top which it doesnt come with.  But when it came out it looked really funny and kind of lame.  Each nacho had 1 slice of chicken on it.  LOL.  But it is what it is.  I liked these nachos still thou because it was a different take on nachos.  Most nachos are cheese, gauc, and some protein or any subset of items.  But i really enjoyed the black beans and cheese and other toppings on this.  The chicken was also pretty good, had a nice flavor but leaned a little on the overcooked side, so it was just a tad dry. But overall the nachos was a nice change of pace.  I always get an enchilada plate when i try a new Mexican food restaurant. Because it you cant make good enchiladas, then you probably cant do anything right.  I got the Trio which was a green chile chicken, a cheese, and a spinach enchilada.  The addition of a spinach one instead of a beef, like most places do, was a interesting take and very rewarding.  The first one i ate was the cheese.  Pretty basic, cheese and tortilla.  The cheese was good but it didnt have very much cheese on the inside as it came out pretty flaccid.  The green chile chicken was pretty decent as well.  The sauce was really good, had a great flavor and some mild kick.  I really liked their green chile sauce.  The chicken was overcooked thou, as it was impossible to cut into bites.  So i basically ate the chicken first and then the tortilla with sauce. The chicken tasted fine but it was just pretty dry that even a knife had trouble cutting thru.  But i still enjoyed the sauce. Now for me the best one was the spinach enchilada.  It was a basic like of ingredients; spinach, tomato and cheese.  But it packed a great amount of flavor and spices.  It had a great fresh taste and lots of deliciousness. So overall, the food was pretty good, a few downfalls but thats like most places.\\n\\nOverall - I really enjoyed our service and the food.  It doenst look like much on the outside but it was definitely a gem. And the fact that we were the only white people in there, was also a good sign."},{"name":"Twyrl Pasta Bistro","address":"315 Broadway","city":"Arlington","stars":"4.5","text":"We found this place because of the gluten free pasta since I have celiac disease and often find it difficult to eat around Cambridge/Boston and it did not disappoint!!

I still would've preferred trying their actual brisket, but thankful we were still able to get this!\\n\\n-- PORK RIBS - $17.98 per pound\\nMore solid than spectacular, but still pretty satisfying.  The ribs were meaty and super moist and I liked that it wasn't slathered with sauce.  I wouldn't have minded a bit more rub/pepper (i prefer dry rubs to sauce), but I'd definitely get this again.\\n\\nAlong with their array of barbecued meats, la Barbecue's menu also offers an assortment of sandwiches that all sounded delicious.  Most are rather straightforward (e.g. their barbecued meats served on buns), but a few are pretty interesting, especially their El Sancho Loco (Sausage, Pulled Pork, and Chopped Beef with Pickled Red Onions on a Potato Bun).  What's more, there's also a small \\"grocery\\" section where you can pick up some other necessities, as well as your pick of something from their fantastic selection of beers.\\n\\nAll in all, while I'm not sure I agree that la Barbecue is just as good or better than Franklin (despite how much I appreciated walking right up to the counter to order), I didn't try enough to really make a fair comparison either.  However, based on what we did have, I can definitely say I'm a fan!  I'll definitely make another visit the next time I'm in town to try the brisket and beef ribs we missed out on, but even if we did manage to get some, I'd still want to come back to try their sandwiches.  What can I say - la Barbecue is definitely worth the hype!"},{"name":"Helen Asian Kitchen","address":"1070 E Dublin Granville Rd","city":"Columbus","stars":"3.5","text":"Not impressed.

So now I can confirm that after dining at 2 restaurants, there is zero reason to come here for the food.\\n\\nHere's what you should know about the FREE concerts promoted on their website. Baseball analogy~ The band plays on a respectable size stage with good audio and lighting. The stage is home plate. The O.H. Restaurant sits back from the 3rd base line. A limited seating bar with bar stools sits about 3rd base. VIP casino players sit in padded, roped off, elevated area at 2nd base. Casino tables and machines would occupy the outfield and 1st base line. A very large screen above the stage projects the entire stage show to the outfield, so you never have  to leave your gaming table. So where do you go to see the show? You stand! There is a large open area/dance floor in front of the stage for people to fill. It's from the very front of the stage to the VIP velvet ropes. Several viewers stood in the aisle behind the VIP seating. If you are lucky enough to catch a seat at the 3rd base bar or edge of the 3rd base line you can see most of the stage. They don't kick you out of the OHR if you finish your food and are watching the show, but they do keep asking \\"Will there be anything else\\".\\n\\nI found out from a regular that minimum bets are increased on tables Friday and Saturday. Since the onslaught of people crowding the tables prevented me from playing comfortably, I bailed on that for machines. I had to ask someone where video poker games were.

Despite the utterly nondescript (and, as Heather N. said, sketchy) storefront, we decided to take the risk.\\n\\nUpon entering, we were greeted by the unmistakably acrid smell of cigarette smoke and, well, a very worn and dirty interior.  I asked the server/greeter/barman if people were allowed to smoke (since I thought that was banned in pretty much every place that sells food*) and he ushered us back to the curtained area, as if the smoke-heavy curtains would serve as HEPA filters for the smoke.  (Spoiler:  They didn't.)\\n\\nWe ordered two vegetarian platters and some foul (it's pronounced \\"fool\\" and it's a really yummy dish made mostly from fava beans).  The foul was listed on the menu as an appetizer, so we expected it to be served first, but ours arrived pretty much when we were finished with our veggie platters, so we asked for a to-go box.\\n\\nWhile this was our first trip to an Eritrean place, we've been to a bunch of Ethiopian places.  We found the food here to be average (the foul was below average) and there were several times we were waiting for our server to return (e.g., when my wife and I had run through our one-napkin-each allotment).  He was nice, but scarce.  To their credit, the food was not as oily as we've seen at some Ethiopian places.\\n\\n(My wife noticed the server riding a bicycle back and forth in the restaurant.  We had no idea what that was about.  We joked that the big draw of the place was its atmosphere.)\\n\\nWhen it came time to leave, we gave up waiting for the server to return to our table, so we walked up to the bar to check out, where my wife was hit on by a man so drunk he couldn't find his mouth with his cigarette.  (She thought he said something to her, but I imagine that if he was so drunk that the cigarette wouldn't go in, intelligible words probably weren't coming out.)\\n\\nThe server employed some undocumented calculations (all he handed us was the change) to come up with the final amount owed and, to his credit, he mentioned that the total included a mandatory 18% gratuity.  (While awaiting the result of his calculations, I watched a lone cockroach descend from the counter of the bar down to the footrest.  Yum.)\\n\\nConclusion?  There are plenty of competing places that have better food, don't have the (and I'm being quite charitable here) quirky service, and don't make me feel like I shouldn't touch anything (particularly important when I'm going to use that same hand to shove food into my mouth), so I think we'll let the drinkers and smokers keep this dive afloat.\\n\\n(I tried to cajole my wife into checking out the restroom, but she refused.)\\n\\n* Turns out that smoking is allowed in restaurants and bars that do not admit or employ people under 18 years old, so there you have it."},{"name":"Gladys Knight's Signature Chicken & Waffles","address":"529 Peachtree St NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3.5","text":"LOVED IT!

My food was DELICIOUS!! I ordered The Southern Sautee w/Salmon! OMGG!! Finger licking good(so mad that I forgot to take pics of the food).

The dinner service and dining room are are top-notch.    For Starters we had oysters, and their lump crab cake.    The oysters seemed fresh, and were nice.  The crab cake was proper Steakhouse style with lots of lump crab meat.  It had a textured, like a corn flake crust.   \\n\\nFor steaks we dined on their NY Strip and their Pastrami Bone In Rib Eye.    The Strip was cooked perfectly, and I like that they offer to slice the steaks.  That said the Strip was not as flavorful as I would have expected.   The Rib Eye had lots of flavor, but as others have pointed out, it was a bit too heavy on seasoning.   If I was to order it again I would likely get it without the seasoning.    Often at places that do Cajun style (think Ruths Chris, or Stoney River) I ask for light seasoning.  Here they let the steaks season in the seasoning in advance, so I was told that would not be an option.  To his credit, the server who was great, properly explained all of this and informed us of our options.\\n\\nFor sides we had the onion rings which came with a mildly spiced Ketchup.   The sides here are nice size portions, which for $9 makes sense.    The rings had more of a thick batter on them, as opposed to the crisp thin batter I would normally be accustom to.    For the other side we had the Collard Greens.   They had candied pecans in them, and they were great.\\n\\nOverall the stand-outs from this meal were the Crab Cake and the Collards.   The steaks were good, though perhaps not amazing.  Next time I think I would try their Tomohawks Prime Rib Eye for Two.     There is a trend where \\"trendy\\" Steakhouses like this and STK no longer use USDA Prime beef for most of their steaks.   I think if I come here for dinner next time it would be to try some of their fresh fish selections, or the Tomohawk for two.\\n\\nLastly, the roof top patio, The Regents Club (there is one in Miami in a boutique hotel), is a great addition to the Buckhead seen.

Church street, adjacent to Hamburger Mary's.\\n\\nSure, they have Tex-Mex classics like enchiladas, chimichangas, tacos and burritos, but Pepe's strives to be innovative with a menu that puts a new twist on traditional Mexican cuisine. Table side guacamole, tacos with authentic fillings and fresh homemade tortillas are great for lunch or dinner, but ordering off of the dinner menu is where the difference is. Pepe is a real person by the way, as in Chef Jose \\"Pepe\\" Baranneko.\\n\\nFor dinner they serve entrees like Pollo Pepe's a grilled chicken breast served with onions, peppers, tomatoes and bacon and is topped off with a signature red sauce and queso, or the Pacific Salmon topped with a sweet and sour mango jalapeno sauce. An interesting appetizer on the menu is the Shrimp Dip which is grilled shrimp with cheese dip, topped with pickled onions and cilantro.\\n\\nOf course any good Tex-Mexery should have plenty Tequila and Margarita specials on hand, and Pepe's certainly delivers in that category. Guests can try a Spicy Mango Margarita, a Jalapeno Margarita, a Mezcal-Rita or just go straight for the good stuff and slam a shot of Avion Reserva 44 extra anejo for $26.00/shot.\\n\\nI haven't got to try out all there is at the new Church Street location, but we did stop by for lunch one day, and it was really good.\\n\\nChips and Salsa are standard fare at any Mexican restaurant these days, but this salsa is made in house as well as the chips, and that's what really makes Pepe's so good. They focus on fresh.\\n\\nThese Grilled Chicken Tacos were topped with radicchio, pickled red onions and cilantro then topped with a chive aioli sauce and are served with black beans and Mexican rice. You can choose flour or corn and soft or hard for your taco, and all tortillas are made in house.\\n\\nThis is a Mexican Pizza. It's totally not what you would expect, but that's what Pepe's really strives for...classic dishes, or even not so classic, like a Mexican Pizza, made with different ingredients, flavors and styles that you are not accustomed to. You can choose shredded chicken or ground beef, and they top it with red sauce, cheese, jalapenos, sour cream and cilantro and serve it atop a lightly baked tortilla. \\n\\nStop by the new location and say Hola to Pepe. Chef Pepe and his team are doing a great job at both locations offering his signature blend of authentic Mexican ingredients with innovative culinary techniques."},{"name":"Gen Sou En","address":"299 Harvard St","city":"Brookline","stars":"3","text":"I was super disappointed coming here.

I am usually a fan of miso soup, but I didn't even enjoy that on the side of my main dish.

The Osso Bucco may be one of the best restaurant meals I've ever had.  Even their bread was outstanding!  So why am I giving only a 2 star review?  Because their incompetence came dangerously close to ruining a very special evening.  I booked a reservation 2 weeks in advance.  I specifically requested a upstairs window table with a view because I wanted a romantic experience.  I also informed them that my date's birthday was that day.  They assured me that they would take good care of my requests.  They asked for my name and phone number.  So I assumed my reservation was in good hands.  I called the next week and they couldn't find my reservation.  I spoke to someone named Mo, who said he was the General Manager.  I reiterated my requests.  And he told me not to worry, because he was the GM, and all would go well.  Finally, I called the night before my reservation and spoke to someone who confirmed my reservation and said that I would get the table I had requested and that they would have the special treat for my date's birthday.  \\n\\nUnfortunately, they blew it.  They attempted to put us in a non-window seat in the middle of a noisy and crowded downstairs room.  I had to become a bit assertive before they moved us to the proper table.

When my friend conveniently went to the lady's room, I questioned my waiter who knew nothing about the birthday request!  Yes, he made good.  But, when you call three times, is it unreasonable to expect that things will go as planned?  For the fairly high prices, I expect more than just excellent food.  I expect impeccable service.

I liked how the pecans were actually in the batter and not just scattered on top. I'd recommend the chocolate chip one for a more decadent treat though, because the melty goodness of the chocolate just can't be beat. Only downside is that it doesn't come with real butter, just with some type of fake softened butter. \\n\\nI also tried the eggs with cheese and the \\"famous scattered, smothered and covered\\" hash browns.

At $28, should get more than a bland seared tuna and few leaves of spinach.\\n\\nMy wife ordered the Pappardelle with Spicy Sausage, Leeks and Mixed Mushrooms. Too bad they forgot the mushrooms. \\n\\nWin list was way too pretentious.

The good food here is why we keep coming back to La Tapatia. The plates are huge, the service is fast and the prices are cheap. I see lots of people looking confused when they first come in. No one really tells you (unless you speak Spanish) that you're just supposed to seat yourself anywhere. The line up front front is for paying out once you're done. Once you get it figured out though, one of the waitresses will swing by with a couple menus and get you taken care of. I love that I can get breakfast tacos for lunch or dinner and they are always delicious. Chorizo, egg and cheese are my favorite. So if you're in the mood for yummy, fast and cheap Tex-Mex, head on over, but don't expect a warm and friendly wait staff.

I'm always on the lookout for good Peruvian restaurants in the Boston area. Union Square already had 2 and Celeste is the new addition to a list of disappointments. \\n\\nThe Good:\\nThe ambience is good. They play chicha music, and their decor is a mix of modern and Peruvian pop culture. They even had a quiz on the bathroom about Peruvian historical figures. The causa de tuna was decent. The tuna tiradito was good. The wait staff was friendly and hospitable.\\n\\nThe Bad:\\nThis place markets itself as a Peruvian restaurant, but a lot of their dishes are actually a fusion of Mexican and Peruvian food. Not a problem in itself, but Celeste needs to be more upfront about what their style of cooking is. This is the crux of all the other Latin American cuisines in the United States. They all want to incorporate Mexican food to appeal to something their American audience is familiar with. While living in Peru, I never had any food served with black beans or wrapped in a taco...\\n\\nThe Ugly:\\nI adore Lomo Saltado. Celeste's dish could not be called a Lomo Saltado. \\"Saltado\\" means to saut√© and in Peru this is traditionally done in a very hot wok. What I was served looked more like a soup. I got beef, tomatoes, potatoes, and onions in a deep bowl of sauce. The sauce was underwhelming and not savory. The potatoes were not fried as it is traditionally done in Peru. They were boiled and barely had any flavor. There was so much sauce that the potatoes were dissolving in the sauce. The sad part of my experience was that the wait staff didn't know my dish came with rice!!  Instead they gave a side of rice to a friend eating ceviche... what?!?!? When I asked my friend to taste some of her rice, it was beyond bad. The rice didn't have enough salt and it was stale and hard like you had just reheated it in a microwave. \\n\\nUnfortunately I won't be coming back."},{"name":"TILT","address":"1355 NW Everett St, Ste 120","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"Well, it certainly isn't diet food but holy cow is it good stuff.

Here's the headline: the wait and prices were not commensurate with the food or the experience.\\n\\nFull review: Yeah, it's a full on no. First, Pancake Social is located in Ponce City Market (which is full of amazing eateries) so it takes effort to get there. Once, we got there the wait was 45 minutes, which is bearable for great food. To Pancake Social's credit, they will text you when your table is ready, allowing you to roam around Ponce City Market or walk around Old Fourth Ward Park while you wait. Fifty minutes later we received that much anticipated text. Upon entreating we were seated and given the menu...it's all downhill from here. Let's talk about prices. In fairness, I've never been a fan of the √† al carte setup, but if the food is amazing, I'm willing to pay whatever. However, I was taken aback by the price of the side items, as a country boy $5 for two eggs is the type of stuff that leads to pitch forks and torches gathering on your front lawn. But again, if the food is amazing, I'll pay...key word: A.MA.ZING. I ordered the Dutch Baby along with scrambled eggs. Before continuing to read my review, please google \\"scrambled eggs\\"...I'll wait...got it? Good! Let's continue. When our food came out, 20 eggless minutes later, I received a small skillet containing baked dough and apples and a folded over fried egg not unlike the fake eggs McDonald's used to put on their breakfast sandwiches. I was so taken about that I had to stop myself from proclaiming that they got my order wrong. In hindsight, they in fact they did get my order wrong...not from their perspective of course, only from the perspective of great cuisine and the world of cooking food the right way. What's worse, nothing I had tasted good AND I was still hungry after choking down their bland dough, sad apples, and recession eggs. In mitigation, at the time of this post, Pancake Social was only open for about three weeks. In aggravation, it should have never opened. Let's hope they pull it together and start SCRAMBLING eggs.  \\n\\nAtlanta has too many great restaurants to be mediocre.

Picture heavy, featuring anything you might want to have, and usually in more than one style. Duck, lamb, pork, chicken, beef, fish, shrimp, squid, tofu, etc. - their beer duck is outstanding, as well as their lamb. They also have organ meats like liver, kidney and lungs.

The brisket paired with their vinegary sauce was splendid. \\n- .25 lbs of pulled pork: I'm usually not a fan of pills pork and truth be told, we only got a small portion to try.

Very savory and tender, with plenty of flavor and smoke in just the meat to savor on its own. \\n- 1 regular hot link: Not the best hot link I've had but still a damn good one. \\n- 1.5 lb/1 beef rib: We flip flopped on this a little bit while waiting in line.

However, because it's so hard to find beef ribs and since it was a special occasion, we decided to spring for it. Hands down the BEST item on the menu. Heart achingly good.

While the vibe has stayed the same, the quality of the drinks and service have gotten worse. The past few times I've had less than stellar drinks (particularly the boba itself, which was clumped and hard instead of soft and chewy), and the service had been lacking (once, there was no one at the counter and it took five minutes or so for someone to come from the outside to take my order -- long smoke break? Another time, someone gave me the wrong drink). Due to this cafe's popularity, management probably had to hire additional staff, which is understandable. Some extra training/retraining should help get the quality and service back to five stars."},{"name":"Bon Ga Korean Restaurant","address":"7130 Buford Hwy","city":"Doraville","stars":"3.5","text":"No frills traditional Korean bone broth soups and meat dishes in a quieter part of BuHi.  Bon Ga is located couple of miles north of the perimeter in the Global Forum shopping center.  I visited during a weekday lunch.  \\n\\nPSA:       open 9:30am-10pm 7 days a week!  I've requested Yelp to update the hours.  \\nThis is NOT a tofu house... in fact no tofu on the menu!  \\n\\n+.     Ambiance is light Asian...screen doors and sectioned booths and tables for more intimate setting.  It's not fancy but newer and clean.  There's a ceiling level TV with Korean news but wasn't loud.  It wasn't busy...about 10 older customers who spoke Korean and some were reading Korean newspapers.  Noise level was on the quieter side...very pleasant and I liked the casual vibe!\\n\\n++.   Their menu is small... 8-11 soups and 8 meat mains.   BG specializes in traditional Korean bone broth soups with rice noodles and rice cakes and traditional meat dishes.  Most soups are beef bone broth based but they also offer oxtail, pork and other base as well.  Another specialty is their cold noodles bowls / soups offered during summertime. For dry mains, common dishes such as bibimbap, galbi, bulgogi, pork belly, seafood pancakes are offered.  Pork blood sausage is less common at restos but you can get them here.    \\nI came to BG for ddukguk, rice cake in bone broth before going to BFM.   I'd been going to Dish for the same soup that isn't on the menu for the past couple of years.   Happily, I found it on the menu here and BG is more authentic!   It was perfectly creamy white and rich depth with chewy rice cakes :-)).  Banchan-wise, a handful of different kimchi and seasoned soybean sprouts.  Not too many but they were on point...unlike many places, they weren't sugared, more fermented but not over-ripe and spicy!   Beverage is Korean tea or water.   \\nFood-wise, BG is an impressive little traditional!\\n\\n+.   Service was friendly.  You seat yourself here...no sign or greeter.  A couple of Korean ladies wait and cash.  They were prompt upon seating with the menu and order.  The food came out in about 10 minutes - piping hot!  They don't really check on you so you have to flag them, but they are friendly and prompt with requests.  English is not a problem here ;-)\\n\\n++.   Price is pretty reasonable.  Figure $10-$15 pp for lunch and $15-$25+pp for dinner.  They offer lunch specials from 11am-2:30pm.   Credit cards are accepted.  \\n\\n+.   Parking is shared, free and easy.\\n\\nOverall, I'm thrilled and BG will be my go-to for my bone broth fix!    Bon Ga is perfectly not over crammed and over sugared mediocrity....just a great spot for decent traditional Korean comfort fare!"},{"name":"Abby Lane","address":"255 Tremont St","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"Abby Lane is a 200-seat restaurant and bar located in the heart of Boston's Theater District at 255 Tremont Street.

Chef Jason Santos who is still perhaps best known for his time on television's popular cooking competition, Hell's Kitchen, is the executive chef.\\n\\nThe menu at Abby Lane offers a bit of something for everyone but with only approximately a half dozen main plates, we turned our attention to the rest of the menu that is divided into small plates, soups & salads, sandwiches & burgers and pizzas. With some helpful tips from the bar staff we settled on the Shitake and Goat Cheese Pizza ($13) and the Abby Burger ($14).\\n\\nWhile the bar was comfortable and the staff helpful and friendly, we both agreed that the food was not memorable.  Even though the pizza looked delicious when served, the crust was bland and the toppings lacked the flavors we expected. The burger also looked delicious, served with fried onion rings and toppings piled high but unfortunately the bun was a bit stale, the ground beef lacked the grilled flavor I had hoped for and tasted a bit dry.\\n\\nDespite a disappointing dinner, the look and location of Abby Lane ensure that it will continue to serve crowds each evening that come for a quick bite either before or after attending a show at one of the Theater District's many play houses.

So much flavor, I was in coconut and chicken heaven! The perfect size small bowl. Wet our tongues and got the juices flowing! Chose the Beef Curry, but subbed in shrimp instead, for the main plate. It's a slightly sweeter, yellow-colored curry. Lots of veggies. I got extra shrimp, and it was very good too. We shared a dish of their Mango Sticky Rice for dessert: two small domes of black rice, six thin slices of fresh sweet mango on both sides of the plate, topped with a sweet condensed milk sauce.

We both agree Carmelina's food is very good, just not authentic Italian food good. So, our hopes were not realized, but that did NOT diminish our enjoyment of Carmelina's. The food here is really good.\\nWe made reservations for an early seating and were placed at a table by the window wall. It looks like they can fully open this wall to the sidewalk which must be lovely in warmer weather. The tables here are quite close together and my SO had a bit of a panic attack being in such close quarters. \\nOur waitress came by in short order asking if we would like to place a drink order. We were looking over the wine list and needed more time.  She was back with hot, fresh baked bread, and a small bowl of olive oil and balsamic vinegar. \\nThis bread is very tasty and the olive oil didn't last long. The oil can stand on it's own and we would have preferred it without the balsamic. We asked for more as one piece of bread soaked up all the oil in this tiny dish and there were a few of us wanting a taste.\\nAfter some deliberation, we ordered a couple of beers, which where served in bottles, and a bottle of wine to share.\\nFor starters we order Risotto Milanese and a beet salad. From the first bite the risotto really pops! The rice is well cooked to the point it is soft, not mushy, and has a nice creamy consistency. The beet salad was very thinly sliced boiled beet under a bed or arugula with cheese and nuts (if I remember correctly). The beets were delicious, and perhaps a bit too much arugula overshadowing the beets. \\nThe Sea Bass was a thick filet and perfectly cooked. Chicken piccata received rave reviews and the pasta in the Carbonara cooked 'al dente'.  The baked pasta with mushrooms is not comparable to the other items ordered. The pasta is nothing special, the mushrooms don't stand out and it all sat in a thick bed of oil. Very little of this dish was consumed.\\nThe side dish of greens was very tasty, but the texture too chewy to enjoy them properly.  For the taste, I would order them again: if I were in the mood for a good chew. If they had been chopped into small pieces before cooking that probably would have helped a lot.\\nOur waitress was very personable and kept a good eye on us. There were a few staff members on hand, and the waitress seems to be the primary contact with guests. Food was delivered by another person who asked if we needed anything else before leaving us to it. I did not notice if the host had other duties. The food quality is quite good and the timing of how the dishes arrived is pretty good. The tiny kitchen is open to the restaurant and it is quite impressive how these two chefs manage to get the food out.\\nWe can only guess the staff are related to each other as there is a lot of 'touching' going on in the dining room by staff members. We did find out one person is dating another, so that solves that for those two, but for the others, we are still wondering. A comment was made about it being a bit 'creepy', but it does offer something to occupy the mind if you are with a quiet companion.\\nThere is one shared restroom at the back toward the left half of the room. It is small and could use a bit of. . . well, something. It looks like it has been updated 'here and there' and has both a toilet and urinal.  When I made a stop in, the urinal had not been flushed. Come on guys, no one wants to smell that with their dinner. Give it a flush. There is a hand dryer in there, no paper towels. \\nMy biggest disappointment with Carmelina's is: the pasta is not made on site.  We specifically asked about the pasta and were told by staff it's 'home made' without being specific about if it were 'house made'. After eating a lot of 'house made' pastas in Italy, we are sure this is dried pasta and that is very disappointing. Someone may have made it 'by hand' at one point, but where and when is the question. It surprises me that something as easy to make as pasta is not house made in the restaurants of the North End. It really should be, as this makes all the difference in the enjoyment of a pasta dish.\\nDessert is not available at Carmelina's and there are a couple of places on the same street that do. So, if you have room, wander toward the water and stop in an Italian cafe for a seated dessert, or buy some pastry from a bakery to enjoy at home."},{"name":"The Pickle House","address":"9521 US-290, Ste 100","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"We've been here several times now and it's been really hit or miss.

We were also a little surprised that the fried chicken plate is just boneless breast meat...so...large chicken fingers? I just wasn't expecting chicken fingers on a 'fried chicken plate.' \\n\\nI ordered some pimento cheese (which is delicious) to go one visit and they gave me a half-filled container. When I asked why it was only half-filled I was told that was all they had left. I asked why he would sell me it if they didn't have a full order and he seemed puzzled. I ended up getting a discount but the whole transaction was just...awkward. \\n\\nSo yeah, we kept going back because our first visit was good and we love to support new local restaurants but things just got progressively worse each subsequent visit so unless we hear about some changes being made we probably won't be back."},{"name":"Kabayan Grill Filipino Restaurant","address":"1328 North John Young Pkwy","city":"Kissimmee","stars":"4.5","text":"This is a true hole in the wall find!!

I am not a fan of Amayas food, to begin with, but I sucked it up because we were celebrating my great aunt's 86th birthday. While we understood they do NOT take reservations (not even for a party of $40) you'd think they would at LEAST be prepared. \\n\\nMy aunt called 3 times during the week (including the day of) to let them know we'd be coming. Upon arrival, we STILL waited 30 mins to be seated. When speaking with Ricky, the manager/owner's son, he told us that they don't just stop everything for a party. Again, we get that, as most of our family IS in the food business...however, with a \\"heads up\\" (as written on the wait list) they were barely putting the tables together, and assigned only 1 waitress (who was amazing, by the way) to our party. We got there at 2pm (some of us were there on lunch breaks or had time constraints that allowed only 1 1/2 hours for lunch). We didn't leave until after 4:30pm. 2 in our party left before we could order, and 1 in our party left before all the food was finally delivered. We absolutely understand that large parties take a while. However, with preparation (having tables ready, assigning more than 1 waitstaff, and having additional cooks ready) our experience would have been better.\\n\\nAs the manager/owner's son, you'd think Ricky would have a higher level of professionalism. However, he laughed at my sister when she asked why they weren't better prepared, and he made us feel like parties aren't welcome there. Before he states that there was attitude when approached, you're the face of that restaurant. If I was the owner, I'd be embarrassed by the way my manager (son) treated patrons of the business. Some of our party came all the way from Houston to attend this party, and 2 of the last remaining elders were in this party (of what ended up being about 50). I don't visit Amayas because I'm not thrilled about the food, and now I won't be visiting for any reason at all. Not even for a party. I would definitely discourage anyone, with a party, from eating here.

I bet you can guess what happened. The dust spots from the fans somehow did not come up. Strange that paying for spot removal did not remove said dust spots. Called the company and told them about our experience and then they decided to tell us that we did not pay for the deep spot cleaning, that we paid for general maintenance, the invoice I had received said that I paid extra for something, but it did not specify what that extra was. Guess that's how they get away with not guaranteeing spot removal. \\n The company sends their employees out with a very basic machine that can fit in the back of a mini cooper, no special vehicle that has not even a semi-commercial grade equipment that can actually get dust and stains out.

We thought for sure there would be no place around here that had this, but then we searched and found Helen Asian Kitchen and saw it got good reviews on Yelp. We went yesterday to check it out. I've probably driven by it a million times and have never noticed it before. It's sandwiched between the Waffle House and the Super 8 Motel off of 71 on 161. Not sure how long it has been around, but walking in the restaurant looks very dated and decorated how you would imagine an authentic Chinese restaurant would be decorated. Lots of red, lots of green, and lots of mirrors. I absolutely adore it. The staff was very friendly and although there was a language barrier, I got by just fine with ordering. We ordered the salt and pepper squid, the vermicelli with ground pork and bean sauce, and, of course, xiao long bao. The food came out in shifts as it was ready so that was nice to get to sample each dish one at a time. Everything was so tasty! It reminded me of the xiao long bao dinner we had in Hong Kong and also of an authentic Chinese restaurant in Seattle's International District we used to frequent.

The gimicky Waygu beef was on the menu, but I was excited about the burger. Was asked by my waiter I'd like some mushrooms with that burger and I answered in the affirmative. Mushrooms were served in a hefty bowl and were too salty to eat straight so I had to temper them with the \\"duck fat\\" fries. It was way too many mushrooms for my verbal affirmation to have implied. Hoping they were just trying to get them out of the kitchen because they were badly prepared and they wouldn't register on the bill. I put some on the burger which wasn't very helpful. I should have gotten something else. I think in 2019, places that cook bad burgers should just move over to Beyond Burgers or something. It's done wonders for the Drafthouse. I'm a clean plate man but I left a little of everything on the plate tonight. I'm not proud about it but the amount of salt (there are other spices, folks) was too much.

After Lea P. pounced on FTR, I figured there was no big rush to get downtown, and we ended up meeting for dinner later that weekend.  It is street parking, but if you're there for dinner, it should be easy to find unenforced meters.  There's also a pay lot right across the street if you're not interested in circling the blocks for street parking.\\n\\nWe were seated in the loft area of the restaurant, which has a lot of light during the evening.  IT WAS WARM.  I'm sure they are very aware of the fact that they need some blinds and adjustments to the A/C for the dinner hour, but just be aware that it may be too warm for the comfort level of some people, especially if you plan to partake of hot ramen.\\n\\nI had a couple questions about the menu, asking about the nature of the \\"ball sushi\\" (see photo) and the difference between the two \\"add your own topping\\" ramen offerings (there isn't).  I ended up ordering one of the salmon ball sushi, and ramen with the house broth, sprouts, bok choy, and chashu.  I've long held Moshi Sushi as being one of the best places to get sushi, and Rishi seems to be following in the same vein (the specialty rolls include several of the same offerings as Moshi).  The salmon was very fresh and flavourful, and on my next visit I'll definitely be ordering more of it.  Both the broth and the noodles in the ramen were excellent, though the large wooden spoon was a little awkward to handle.  I felt like the bok choy was a little sparse (though when I make ramen, I'm usually throwing in entire heads of baby bok choy).  The chashu was two good thick slices, and the sprouts were fresh and there were plenty of them.  \\n\\n.... but oh the prices.  The basic bowl of ramen (broth, noodles) starts out at $8.95, with the specialty ramen going up to around $17.95.  This is not your $5.99 SoCal ramen house (not even Tensuke has prices that cheap).  I didn't see the lunch menu, but Lea said that there didn't seem to be much price different in the ramens.  It's certainly going to be a special occasion sort of place for me (sort of the way that Moshi is \\"my\\" birthday place).\\n\\nUPDATE: Came back for lunch with Lea P. and Heather C.  This time we sat downstairs (although they have now installed shades for the windows).  Our server was very personable, interacting with the kids in our party and recognizing Lea and me from our previous visits.  This time I ordered two pieces of the salmon ball sushi and the beef ramen.  The sushi was excellent, as before.  I was slightly less impressed by the beef ramen.  It smelled lovely, but the spiciness of the kimchi was a bit too much for me (next time I would ask for the kimchi on the side).  The soft-boiled egg was a delicious touch.  The ramen does appear to be a dollar or two cheaper at lunch than at dinner.  It was fairly easy to find nearby metered street parking, and we were there right at 11, so it wasn't crowded at all.\\n\\nI'll probably stick with the house broth next time I visit, and maybe I'll eventually get to some of the other sushi offerings.  Can it be my birthday again soon?"},{"name":"la Barbecue","address":"2027 E Cesar Chavez St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"I was in town for the MotoGP race last weekend and obviously had to get my BBQ fix.

We had three different kinds of meat on the grill which you get to cook yourself, we had the round one which is slightly aggravating to use, the rectangle or flat one is better. We also ordered vegetables which were nice and fresh however oddly they did not have any onions in there vegetable selection. We tried beef pork and pork belly which was unseasoned. Now the pork belly unseasoned I rubbed with some raw garlic and that helped a little bit along with some salt and some sesame oil they had at the table, pork belly is kind of thing all on its own so it was fine like that with the grill marks, the pork and beef are both fantastic, really, I chowed down Way more than I needed to. \\n\\nThe service was nice and friendly, she was helpful if we need it but not overbearing. The inside only has about 10 tables maybe and they were rotating mostly full but the service did not seem hurried at all and everybody seemed to enjoy their food, I saw much food going by then I wanted to try including what looked like a kimchi pancake or perhaps a seafood pancake but I was way too stuffed to try anything else.

My advice is: If you want Chinese food then go to Chinatown. Seems logical...\\n\\nMoreover, go to a place that has a live tank. You won't get any fresher than a fish that was just pulled from a live tank and cooked pronto. Contrary to this, most all round-eye \\"high-end/fancy\\" seafood restaurants around Boston are not really fresh seafood as they boast to be. And they charge mega-high prices for some puny chunk of fish that is no fresher, or in fact often less so, than you can get at DeMoulas. I bet that restaurant stuff often sits on ice or is refrigerated or even frozen for days. Fresh my eye. Fresh fish comes from a live tank, bro. \\n\\nThe Jum served me up a fried whole fish from the tank with a bean sauce and spicy to order and it was supreme and extreme. It was just 25 bucks and the sauce was out of this world and the fish was dynamite. I even ate the eyeballs as these are a collagen-laden treat. And they taste good too. \\n\\nThe Hot n' Sour Soup was good and my One got her \\"usual\\" -the PuPu Platter but she wished she had gotten (got?) the fish that I had. Next time for sure.

The waitress nicely helped me eat my fish by deboning some of it for me since my lack of skills and experience showed.\\n\\nSome good American-Chinese stuff on the menu here too.

Why ruin a good thing? Its refreshing, hand crafted and I've never detected that fake, syrupy crap. These are the real deal, guys.\\n\\n- CEVICHE!!!!! The base is generally yellow fin tuna, with variations from there. I've nibbled on tuna with plantains, lime, cilantro, onions, and unadulterated magic, while other times they'll throw in a diced avocado instead of the plantains, but no matter how they make it, I highly suggest you order it. Their chips are the perfect size, and hold just the right amount of grease to make you feel guilty and in love at the same time.\\n\\n- Pastel Azteca - This is like a gloriously cheesy Mexican lasagna. The menu describes this dish as \\"layered corn tortillas filled with spinach, almonds and raisins. Covered with a tomato chipotle sauce with crema and cheese au gratin.\\" Meanwhile, I'd describe it as culinary genius in my mouth. Its cheesy, filled with love and care. I dream about this stuff.\\n\\nOther contenders:\\n\\n-Carmones (shrimp) al mojo de ajo - A light shrimp dish with a light, citrus flavor.\\n-Poblano Relleno - This isn't like the stuff you get from a generic Mexican restaurant. Its made with so much more than that.\\n-Tampiquena - A simple, yet tasty steak dish.\\n\\nEven their breads that they serve prior to dinner are perfect. Its presented as tiny little two-bite pieces, served with a small bowl of pickled onions, carrots and cauliflower (the actual name of this escapes me. I suppose its something like  chow chow or something?). It is also accompanied by a small dish of room temperature orange-flavored butter. Glorious! And the final piece is a house made, purchasable smoky, chipotle hot sauce/salsa? I feel terrible that I can't describe it in a sexier manner - I just know its delicious.\\n\\nPoint made. Its fabulous. Its not offensively pricey. Its just more upscale than a lot of the other Rainey joints. And there's a reason.

I've also tried the Cream Coffee and Sea Salt Thai Tea but I am not a fan of those for I taste way too much cream and very little coffee or tea. The Matcha Latte is okay. Don't come here if you're looking for a meal though because the basil friend chicken is more of a snack than an entree. It is pretty good and one of my favorite things to get here. However it can be a hit or miss because sometimes it is way too salty and other times it's just right. Their Strawberry brick toast is okay because it's nothing very unique or special, however still yummy if you want to try it.

Everyone said they ordered the same item as they always have but food quality just seemed...off. We haven't been in over a month as we wanted to see if it really changed...well, went today and it is awful. So sad...food was below par- all dishes served on bland cheap white dishes , breakfast bowl looked worse than a diner meal, avocado toast couldn't eat, kids got burgers and fries...again...could tell quality of food product was different. I mention the white cheap plates because they all had a sprinkle of parsley to try to improve the look of the dish. We all agreed that it has become the equivalent of cafeteria food. In addition, the bathroom had a wet floor sign randomly placed and blue paint tape around a non working facet. Understand problems occur but it just added to the perception of a place going downhill.

The plate comes with slaw and green beans and 3 large pieces of boneless chicken. This chicken was so tender and flavorful and perfectly fried. Light and crispy. Probably the best fried chicken I have ever had. I'm salivating just thinking about it. The fried pickles were pretty good. We got a mix of dill and sweet. Their dill pickle dip is awesome. \\n\\nThe pickle bar is fun and has lots of different flavors. Sadly, it was hard to differentiate much other than spicy and sweet. I really enjoyed the Moroccan cabbage and daikon. Also - the pickle sauces. Everything tastes like pickles!! \\n\\nAnd lastly, try their pies!! The peanut butter pie was insane.

This was my latest stop In my continuing quest to try and find Vietnamese close to where I live (inner SE).\\n\\nThe building is set back from the street, with a small parking lot in the front.  When facing the building, there's a large, covered patio on the right.  Once you enter, the counter/cash register is directly in front of you, with some seating to the left.  Not a huge space.\\n\\nI sat outside and ordered the bun with grilled pork and rolls.  I think this was 11 or 12 bucks, which I thought was steep.  When it came out, I was really surprised to see it was on a plate, practically deconstructed.  The noodles were in one corner, the sprouts and green in another, and the other half of the square plate had 3 skewers of grilled pork framed by two very skinny/long spring rolls (cigarillo sized).  The plate was accompanied by the standard small bowl of fish sauce/dressing.  Pretty plating, but definitely not what I was expecting.\\n\\nTook a bit of work to remove the pork from the skewers, cut it and the spring rolls into bite size pieces, mix everything together, and drizzle some sauce on it.  Pork was a little dry, though the spring rolls were good, albeit a little smaller than I was hoping for.\\n\\nWhen I went to pay, the lady working the register looked at my name on my card and asked what my ethnicity was.

Yum!!"},{"name":"Salty Sow","address":"1917 Manor Rd","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"I've only come for happy hour but really, what reason is there to come at another time? Salty Sow's happy hour has a diversity of small plates for around $5.\\n\\nFirst and foremost: get a reservation. This place is absolutely hopping during happy hour and I suspect it's hard to be seated without one. This, despite the fact that Salty Sow is WAY bigger than it looks. It's footprint on manor is tiny but they make good use of all the space on the entire lot. The restaurant consists of multiple buildings with breezy, shady porches in between, all full of tables.\\n\\nOne final general note is that they run their happy hour service like a clinic. I'm not sure I've gotten food this quickly anywhere, ever. Certainly not food this tasty. I assume this is because so many people are ordering the same thing that they're making dishes a dozen at a time rather than as-ordered. The food quality was great, however, so I hope they keep doing whatever it is they're doing. Service was quick without making us feel rushed.\\n\\nI've eaten everything on the happy hour menu except the catfish taco, so here goes:\\nHighlights:\\nBrussels sprouts leaves - So incredibly tasty. Crispy, salty, savory, and the best Brussels sprouts I've ever eaten. I assume they're cooked in lard because they offer a lot of umami. You've gotta try these, even if you don't think you like Brussels sprouts.\\n\\nDuck fat fries - I'm not sure what the duck fat adds to the flavor but the fries are good and taste awesome when dipped in the 110-minute egg. 110-minute eggs really need to become a standard fry condiment everywhere.\\n\\nFried Chicken - I like this dish because you get 2 chicken thighs and a giant biscuit so it's quite substantive. I eat a lot of food so I usually leave feeling hungry when I'm at small plate affairs and this is a nice remedy for that. It's basically a much more bougey honey-butter chicken biscuit. Eat your heart out, ruling classes.\\n\\nEggplant fries - these taste like eggplant Parmesan in french fry form. Fried eggplant has a delightfully airy texture that feels like eating a cloud.\\n\\nThings that are ok:\\nChicken Liver Mousse - I'm not sure what distinguishes \\"liver mousse\\" from \\"pate\\" but here we are. Salty Sow's kitchen has accomplished the difficult task of making liver not taste like liver. This is probably a good gateway drug into other liver dishes and it palatable if you're like me and don't like liver (except for some pate on your Banh Mi).\\n\\nTruffled Deviled Eggs - I didn't know it was possible to have too much truffle in anything but this might fit the bill. I do love truffle but these are a bit overpowering. You certainly don't want to eat more than one of these. Bring 3 friends.\\n\\nPork Belly Taco - despite the trendiness of pork belly, it's actually incredibly bland if you don't know how to cook it correctly (spoiler - I don't know how to cook it correctly) so I count it as a feat of cuisine to give it flavor at all. Truly, pork belly exists for the sole purpose of being turned to bacon. So, while I'm impressed that they've converted pork belly into a tasty dish, it's still not the best thing on the menu.\\n_________________________\\n\\nIn sum, Salty Sow has some really interest dishes and happy hour (4:30-6:30pm) is a great way to try a bunch of stuff with your friends. If you haven't been, grab a reservation and check it out. Plus, if you've got 3 friends you can easily sit down and tell your waiter \\"One of everything, please!\\""},{"name":"Tom, Dick & Hank","address":"191 Ralph David Abernathy Blvd SW","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"I am from Maryland and ate at TDH late night after moving my daughter in at CAU.

After looking over the menu, we ordered 3 slices, garlic bread and 2 waters. The total was $20 plus tip. It seemed a bit high but I didn't think to ask about it. I grabbed our waters while the husband found us a table. When I sat down, I noticed I was charged $2 to add pesto to my pizza. The menu had this item marked as a specialty topping, which are $1 to add to a slice. When I went to ask about this, both cashiers agreed that the menu says $1 and didn't know why it rang up as $2. One cashier grabbed a manager. The manager proceeded to tell me it was a specialty topping, which are $2. I pointed out to him that their posted and menus near the cash register all say specialty toppings are $1 per slice. He then tried to say it's $1 for the specialty up charge plus the standard fee for an added topping. A.) Thats ludicrous. B.) The standard cost to add a topping is $.50. I'm not a math major, but that's only $1.50. He's got nothing to say to this and not once does he apologize or acknowledge that it's an issue for their system to over charge me. I told him it's BS - cancel my slice and give me a refund. At this point, I don't want the $6 slice of pizza. (Who the hell charges $6 for a slice?!? I've had huge, artisanal slices in Manhattan and they weren't $6!)  The manager can't refund to my card so he just takes $6 from the register and hands it to me. For real?!? I don't mention tax.

It's a very small restaurant, so not only would I highly recommend reservations, I would also recommend being prepared to either have everyone around you hear your conversation or even engage in a convo with the tables next to you.\\n\\nThe complimentary bread was good (not great) but the dip that comes with it was to die for!! I wouldn't have touched that bread without the dip. I wanted to try almost every appetizer, but knew I also wanted to enjoy my main meal, so we settled for the  Garlic Shrimp in the Pan. My boyfriend isn't the biggest seafood fan, but the preparation was so amazing that he (and I) downed these babies. The shrimp were very large, which I wasn't expecting, and there's so much garlic in the buttery, lemony delicious sauce. We basically licked that pan clean. I would have loved that sauce on a pasta too. We also split a house salad - it was very basic and I would go without it next time just to save room for the main dish. \\n\\nMy boyfriend ordered the Sunday Macaroni and I had the Carbonara. I'll start with the Carbonara... sadly, I was underwhelmed. Our server said its the best he's ever had, I found it very meh. I like my carbonara creamy and eggy, this one was very oily. The pasta itself was good and tasted fresh. I would have actually given this place 3 stars if my boyfriend's Sunday Macaroni had not been in the picture. Trying his meal made me realize I just made a bad call with my order because holy wow that thing was good. First off, 2 people could probably split this. There are 3 huge meatballs, a sausage and a rib, along with a nice heaping of rigatoni and the best dollop of ricotta I've ever had. The ricotta was so creamy and really made the whole dish. The meatballs were juicy and perfectly cooked. His only complaint was that the beef rib was quite fatty. \\n\\nDon't get me wrong, our server was one of the nicest and most personable servers I had during my long weekend in Boston, but it seemed like he was the only server for the entire restaurant. It took him a bit to come back and clear our plates after we had been done for a while, which was fine because we were in no rush, just worth mentioning. All in all, this is a cozy place with really friendly staff and what I would consider very authentic food."},{"name":"A Cup of Peace","address":"3216 Arapahoe Ave","city":"Boulder","stars":"3.5","text":"Love the Dub Bob (spicy) with beef and egg, and the tea selection.

I've never SEEN such an assortment of vegegtables in dishes!  they were all very flavorful, and I hve to say I am now a Thai fan.  The service was excellent, and everyone was so attentive.  \\n\\nI lagged begind to tell Rich just what I'm writing here.  This was the best Thai food I ha ve ever had, and at least I will be back.

I ordered a turkey sub and found it odd when the woman behind the counter asked me about chicken parm options. I corrected her and again said, no I want a turkey sub. She said okay and asked what I wanted on it which was mayo, tomatoes and pickles then asked again if I was sure I didn't want cheese. That should have been a sign. The wait was about 15 minutes and people ordering after me were getting their food much faster. Eventually, they handed me the sub and I left only to find it was a chicken nugget sub. Now, the chicken nuggets were great so I can't complain but it didn't really work in sub bread with mayo, pickles and tomatoes. So I ate the chicken and scraped the toppings off of the bread for an improvised salad but I really wish they had listened to my initial order even after I corrected the woman. I probably wouldn't go back because it's important to get good and correct service. The chicken nuggets were delicious and the reason for three stars.

'East Village') has a lot of food joints popping up/rebranding lately - part of the revitalization of the hood with a bunch of low-rises and indie businesses coming in.  Like flies to a turd, when you have indie shops in a 'edgy' neighbourhood, the hipsters will propagate.  I guess Gastown and Mount Pleasant are too 'mainstream' now.\\n\\nAnyways, it was pretty clear that Red Wagon was at the forefront of this trend.  When I wandered by on random weekend mornings and saw a big lineup of hipsters outside here - couldn't help but say, \\"There goes the neighbourhood.\\"  I normally won't have bothered - I seriously think Western breakfast/brunch is the biggest ripoff in the restaurant world.  I mean - you seriously have the gall to charge me ~$10 for two slices of toast, two eggs, fried potatoes and a sliver of meat?  Sorry, $4 is the most I would pay for a breakfast combo - Bon's Off Broadway or Master Chef Cafe (down the street), yo.  Dirty and ghettolicious.  And I only wait in line for sneaker drops - nothing else.\\n\\nBut my mom really wanted to check this place out - so I guess I could let the lady that carried me for 9 months chose where we're eating breakfast.  As I said to my mom, \\"Alright - this one time. Just know: this makes us even for the whole giving birth to me and motherly love thing.\\"  When my mom sees a lineup, she assumes the place must be good.  When I see a line-up, I assume everyone standing in it is a dolt and their time isn't worth anything.\\n\\nThe good thing is that we came here on a Friday morning, so there was no lineup and we were immediately seated.  The funny thing is that we were seated by a nice middle-aged couple from Arizona that was eating here for the second time in the same week because they saw it on 'Diners, Drive-ins and Dives'.  Guy Fieri -- some people take food advice from him... he makes the list of Top 5 people that I would love to punch in the face.  Just imagine how satisfying that would be.\\n\\nMy mom got the breakfast special: pastrami hash with poached eggs and hollandaise ($11) and I got the Super Trucker ($15): eggs, toast, home fries, crispy pork belly and pulled pork pancakes.  $15 is pretty steep for a diner breakfast but I guess it would be worth it if I got all their marquee items in one shot.  But I was pretty surprised to learned the Jack Daniel's maple syrup was extra.  For $15?!?  ARE YOU FOR SERIOUS?  I resisted launching into a tirade of curses and just turned down the upsell.\\n\\nSo overall, I have to grudgingly admit that the food was pretty good.  The crispy pork belly is better than bacon (and that's saying a lot) and pulled pork pancakes were pretty dope.  And the pastrami hash wasn't bad either.\\n\\nAnd beyond the hype, I figured out why there are line-ups here.  The service is slow as hell.  It took us a good 15 minutes waiting for our bill.  If I was a Playboy Playmate, 'Inefficiency' would top my list of 'Turns-Off'.\\n\\nOverall, the food is good even considering the high price point.  However, I would never, ever wait an hour in line for this.  It's a bit of a Catch-22 -- line-ups means they should raises prices, but it would be obscene for this place to be any more expensive.  This place is good, but extremely overrated.\\n\\nBut hey hipsters, I know you guys love line-ups.  I mean, I see you guys posted up outside every weekend morning at Red Wagon, record stores and bicycle shops.

BBQ !\\n\\nWhen we came to Austin Texas, we had a ton of barbecue recommendations from friends and numerous articles on the internet pushing various Bar-B-Cue joints offering the best meats... a few names are repeated over and over, but the ones we wanted to try ALL REQUIRED A LONG WAIT IN LINE LONG BEFORE THE RESTAURANTS OPENED !\\n\\nWe swore we'd never camp out for food... but after thinking about it, the craving got too strong and we gave in. We chose the restaurant that interested us the most... and here we are at La Barbecue... earlier than I'd like to admit. \\n\\nWe had just over 25 people in front of us and way more behind us when they finally opened the doors. While waiting the line is rumbling with chatter about what to get... it very much seems that the line is made up of mostly tourists and of those almost all seemed to be first timers (like us). \\n\\nA menu was posted outside to assist with knowing your order before you reach the counter. They have an assortment of side dishes and sandwiches (all running around the ten dollar mark); but it's the \\"meats\\" that everyone goes for... I recommend having a snack before coming to eat just to prevent over-ordering because... IT AIN'T CHEAP !\\n\\nTHE OFFERINGS: two different sausages (both more than 4 dollars each link)... pork ribs, pulled pork and turnkey (all around 18 per pound)... brisket was 20 dollars each pound and I don't remember the price but they sell each beer rib at market price (it's huge though). \\n\\nAt the food counter you place the order and they pulled each meat from the cookers or smokers and cut and plate it right in front of you... the meats just glisten. \\n\\nThe problem is everyone wants a bit of everything and at these prices our lunch was OVER ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS !

We arrived promptly on time for our 6:30pm reservation and proceeded to order an appetizer. Within 20 minutes we had ordered an appetizer, a main course, and a bottle of wine. We were eating, drinking, and chatting and all was going well until we started noticing the wait staff impatiently circling the table and asking us if everything was going okay or taking plates away every 5 minutes. My friend remarked that this place was known for being a bit pushy, but I made nothing of it - I had eaten at places like that before and I thought I knew what to expect. I was wrong.\\n\\nWe were happily finishing up our dishes, continued talking and pouring from our bottle of wine. At a certain point, one of the waiters came up to us and let us know that they usually allot exactly an 1 hour and 15 minutes to every table, and we were already clocking in at around 1 hour and 30 minutes. He said that since they had other people waiting and they were a small establishment with limited space, we unfortunately needed to finish up. Sure, he said it in the kindest possible way you could ask someone to hurry up and leave, but what he asked us to do was still to hurry up and leave!\\n\\nWe were stunned... Neither of us had ever had this happen before in our lives. Instead of catching up, we could now only talk about what had just transpired. We suddenly felt like impostors in a hostile environment, becoming hyper-aware of every waitress passing by the table, the waiter gesturing toward us to the party after us, and this next group staring at us from the window. We felt so uncomfortable, we had to essentially start chugging our remaining half a bottle of wine.\\n\\nOur waitress came by shortly to let us know she had nothing to do with the decision to allot only 1h15m to each table - which, as you can imagine, was very comforting. Because she decided to mentioned she was herself Italian, I conveyed to her the irony that this supposedly-authentic Italian restaurant created the most un-Italian experience for its patrons. I reminded her that in Italy, you can sit at a restaurant for hours on end and no one will bother you until you decide to leave, which she had to concede.\\n\\nNever before had I been made so plainly aware that a restaurant I was eating at was no more than a business that needed to have as many people as possible come through each hour to achieve maximum profits - and that I was nothing more than another credit card holder passing through its doors. \\n\\nI don't go to a restaurant just to consume food. I can already do that at home. I go out to a place like Carmelina's not only for well-prepared food, but also for the atmosphere and the service - which are essential to the whole dining experience. It boggles the mind that Carmelina's management has chosen to undermine the very thing a restaurant exists to provide - not just some food on a plate, but a pleasant and comfortable dining experience. \\n\\ni hope my recount of this experience inspires them to revise their time limits or at least start to communicate this information upfront - on the menu, or while seating their customers. Until then, you have lost a customer."},{"name":"Mi Casita BBQ","address":"321 S John Young Pkwy","city":"Kissimmee","stars":"4.5","text":"Awesome service!!!!

I rely heavily on Yelp reviews and I made an account solely to write this feedback. To clear things, this review has nothing to do with the quality of the food they serve nor the young lady that works a majority of the shifts with the amazing customer service but this is SPECIFICALLY about the gentlemen who was the cashier for today. He had horrible customer service skills, cussed my mother out, and refused to give her money back when he undercooked the chicken. I came a while after to find the owner to file a complaint. After asking the guy for the owners contact information, he refused. Long story short, he called me a \\"b*tch\\", flipped the bird, & sprayed my face & chest with a bottle of ranch after I complained to him about his lack of customer service skills. He also tried to smack my phone out of my hand while I was trying to record him cussing me out. I genuinely feel bad for the owner because this employee will be responsible for a decline in customers if this person continues to be employed here.

This restaurant desperately needs new management or better tools to handle even a reasonable dinner volume. The first time I came here a few weeks ago, my family and I came here for the tenders. After waiting in line for 30 minutes, yes, THIRTY minutes, they were out of tenders, and their stock was apparently frozen. After waiting this long, we ordered something else and pulled around to the window. \\n\\nWe sat at the window with no acknowledgment for another 10 minutes. When the girl came to the window, she was obviously frustrated and overwhelmed, which was very evident in her attitude when she came to the window. There was no \\"hello\\", no smile, no apology for the delay. When she handed my my food, she dropped it into my hands and slammed the window as soon as her hands were clear. We were frustrated, but figured it was a fluke. Surely no restaurant could possibly conduct business this way on a regular basis and remain open. We got home, and our biscuits weren't even cooked all the way through. They were gooey dough! Fluke, right? \\n\\nWe decided that we would give this location another try. I got into line tonight at a little after 6:00 pm. There was a line around the front parking lot, but that was to be expected considering the time. I got to the speaker to place my order 20 minutes later, and that was AFTER 3 other cars got tired of waiting and left. Can you imagine the wait time if those cars hadn't pulled away? I got to the speaker and the woman on the other end asks me to wait a moment, she'd be right with me. I think to myself, \\"ok, understandable, they're busy, it's dinner time\\". \\n\\nAfter waiting at the speaker for at very minimum 10 minutes, I said, \\"hello?\\" fearful that perhaps she got busy and forgot that I was there. She responded with, \\"I'm going to need you to wait a minute. We are short staffed tonight, there are literally two of us in here working.\\" I understand being overwhelmed, we all have those days, but there was no \\"I'm so sorry, we are really struggling. I promise I will be with you as soon as we can. I really appreciate your patience,\\" like one might hope. However, I could tell she was genuinely overwhelmed and frustrated. So I sit there for another 8-10 minutes, and decide I'm done waiting and left. \\n\\nEither management needs to give this store better leadership and the equipment and staff that can accommodate the volume of a restaurant right off of a major thoroughfare to and from downtown, or they need better pay and incentives for people who work there to come into work. Either way, this restaurant is HIGHLY disappointing. I can deal with waiting if the staff is friendly and acknowledges my time just as I would acknowledge theirs. I know not everything runs as smooth as we would like, but when you're waiting in line for 40 minutes... just to be able to order at a \\"fast food\\" restaurant. That's unacceptable and absolutely ridiculous. I could have gone to a sit-down restaurant and at least gotten even moderately reasonable service and a luke warm smile from a snobby hostess in 40 minutes (not that all hostesses are snobby, that's not what I'm saying, but we've all encountered that ONE who was) \\n\\nWon't be returning to this restaurant, and it doesn't look like I'm the only one who's experienced this."},{"name":"Small Pharoah's","address":"340 SW 5th St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Ok so I legit drove from Sacramento to try this place and I did NOT leave disappointed.

Plenty of street parking in the area.  \\n\\nIt is hard to describe the perfection of cooking this is. Brisket smoked 12+hrs at a slow heat with just deep salt & pepper rub.  The bark on brisket is the real deal.  The brisket smoke ring is perfect and quite tender. Sauce really isn't needed since the meat flavor is so bold.  The meat still cooking after it makes your plate. Beef ribs are easily 1.5+ lbs, serious taste, and sell out fast.  Everyone loves the smoked turkey, pork ribs, and sausage links.  They also have multiple sandwich options like the El Sancho.  They have great sides, but I don't order any because the meat alone is enough.  LA BBQ even serves a keg with free beer (just please add to the tip jar).  \\n\\nLots of covered open picnic benches at the new spot.

People will go over who they think is the best.  I even struggle myself with that answer.  I think all are fantastic, and I have a special heart for LA BBQ.

Now let's move onto the amazing food.  For an appetizer, we got the lobster chili.  Lobster in a buttery Sirracha based sauce with hints of lemon.  It came with Texas toast that you could dip in the sauce...a pure delight.  Best steak I've had since a trip we took to Omaha! The steaks were so tender you could cut it with a butter knife or even just your fork.  We got two beautiful medium cooked filets: one topped with maitre de butter the other topped with blue cheese and red wine sauce.  We got the collard greens and the creamed spinach for sides.  The collards had a nice smoked taste to them with a hint of sweetness and pecans.  The creamed spinach gave a artichoke dip type vibe.

My sweetie took me to Ristorante Damiano in Boston's North End and we were so bothered by the treatment we received from the management that we feel compelled to Yelp about it. First of all, I'll say that my sweetie took me there because she'd been there twice (while in Boston on business) and wanted me try to try their Carbonara. We're both good cooks and we think we know good from bad. I'll also say that I lived in this neighborhood for a year and there are fabulous restaurants including the Daily Catch and Giacomo's. So we were enthusiastic. We put our name down and said we'd wait for a window table because the other tables are too noisy for us. The hostess offered to ring our cell phone, saying we'd be seated in about 20 minutes -- very sweet. And she did call, after just 20 minutes, but it turns out that was for one of the tables we said we didn't want. She was apologetic and said it'd probably be another 20 minutes before a window table opened up. No worries, we said. Busy night. Good for them. We came back 15 minutes later and stood there while two \\"two-top\\" tables by the window opened up and were then combined to create a four-top which was then given to someone else. That was a little annoying, but okay. We were told we'd get the very next table. So we waited some more. After a total of an hour of waiting, another table opened up by the window. Guess what -- they sat a foursome there. At that point we complained. The manager came out and gave us a line of hooey. Told us that they'd been on the list ahead of us, which was simply untrue. Apologized and offered to bring us each a glass of wine while we waited, which he didn't. Ten minutes later, we got seated. The food was fine, very tasty but not remarkable. We were intent on enjoying our meal -- we were starving! Guess what -- the bill came and we were billed for the wine. We mentioned to the waiter that the manager had offered to buy us a glass of wine for our troubles. Guess what -- the manager came over as said there must be a misunderstanding. The comp wine was offered while we were waiting outside. The offer wasn't good for when we got inside. Unbelievable. We appreciate that the restaurant is small and that the manager wants to fill every table -- it's a tough economy -- but that's no way to treat customers. Short-sighted. Small-minded.

As with most very small pizza/sub shops, it's a pretty minimal set up inside;  They have room for a few people to dine in, but it's not really expected that you will.  The atmosphere is designed for the employees to answer the phone, make your order and have you pick it up...not much else.  I honestly don't fault them for that at all because, really, who orders pizza to eat it anywhere but in front of the TV?\\n\\nOne thing I'm noticing about Columbus pizza shops, for better or worse, they all have the same style of pizza.   They all mostly use the straight cut, probably the same pepperoni, etc.   Honestly, I probably wouldn't be able to tell the difference between a few of them.    If you've had Donato's, that's \\"Columbus style\\", although a bit more toned down for the masses.  Fortunately for me, I really like the \\"Columbus style\\" of pizza.   \\n\\nSo, the pizza I'm eating right now.  Yeah, it's pretty good.   It's 3.5 or 4 star pizza, as far as I'm concerned.  The price was decent for a medium one topping.  I live close enough that I may order again, but not close enough that they'd probably ever be my very first choice.

My husband got some beers that time, and was really happy with the offerings and the quality of the beers he was served (including some from Cambridge Brewing Company); I got black iced tea.  Everything was fantastic.  The burger I got came with roasted tomatoes, which were delicious, and included sides of potato salad and dressed arugula, and I cleaned my plate.

We split a slice of the sweet potato carrot cake for dessert, even though I despise sweet potatoes, since our waitress assured us that it didn't taste like sweet potatoes.  And she was right.  It was the perfect choice.

Busy.\\n\\nWhat we ordered this time:\\n\\nSZECHUAN DAN DAN NOODLES \\nFirst time I ever tried this dish, I gotta say HANDMADE NOODLES \\"rock like an avalanche\\" \\nAl dente, flavor was bold. I could of order just this, but that would just be silly. \\n\\nSESAME CHICKEN \\nMy daughter's favorite dish. If you order this elsewhere, you have to try this dish. Perfect crispy to tender ratio. I don't order this dish for my self, but am always picking off the plate. I think it could use a little heat in the flavor, but I like heat.\\n\\nCHOW FUN COMBINATION \\nI want to try something different next time. That is what I said the last 3 times. I have ordered this everywhere in 3 different countries and  7 states. This is it for me. I cannot say enough about the flavors in all the dishes we have tried. The quality  of ingredients is clearly a commitment made by the owners.\\n\\nPOTSTICKERS \\nAt this point, you  Should be in your car and on your way to Tang Dynasty. Hand made with love as the main ingredient. Night and day difference between hand made noodles and \\"restaurant supply\\"  I live in South Beaverton so driving to Tanasbourne at any time is not too exciting. But it is worth the drive just for the fresh made sausage inside.  \\n\\n\\nBEEF ROLLS\\nBeef Rolls, tortillas? This is a Chinese restaurant. What are beef rolls doing in a Chinese restaurant?? Madness. (It did dawn on me that I just might have been missing something,  so I looked it up and Beef Roll are really a thing) They do not belong here; however, if you don't belong in a Chinese restaurant,  make yourself happy and order the Beef Rolls. It is so much more than you are imagining. Good for picky kids too. \\n\\n I love the highlight restaurants that make a commitment to quality ingredients.  Even better if they're able to take dishes that are being done everywhere and make it something special, make it their own. Home/Hand made noodles."},{"name":"Southside Flying Pizza","address":"2206 S Congress Ave","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"I've been coming to Southside for years.

The waiter was legit, classic Italian (hilarious - full of character and knew his stuff!), and was attentive to all of our questions and needs. He knew every item on the menu and could speak eloquently to it, also making good recommendations when we told him what we were looking for. We started with a couple nice glasses of wine and also a couple appetizers: Fried Calamari (came with a bit of spicy topping - real nice!) and a braised rib on top of risotto - meat fell right off the bone and risotto was slightly el dente which was perfect. Then we shared a couple entrees: Carbonara which came with fresh, home-made pasta (RIDICULOUSLY GOOD), and Gnocchi with Vodka sauce. They were both such an amazing experience. \\n\\nOther than a well-earned 5 stars for service and food, I needed to charge my phone and the waiter took it and plugged it in right away... such good service.\\n\\nCan't say enough about this establishment.

The flavor is an explosion of deliciousness, and the bun they use...*expletive*!  Their slaw has a great balance of crunch, flavor, and it's not saucy. It's clean and crisp. Their beans are phenomenal, so don't be afraid to try those. I also ordered their fried pickles, which were a pleasant surprise! Why? Because there seems to be a philosophical debate of Spear versus Chip fried pickles...these guys give you both! Not only do you receive a variety of fried spear and chip pickles, you also get different flavors of pickles. \\n\\nOne item I cannot wait try is their Rueben sandwich.

Very busy, diverse patrons for a monday lunch time, made for interesting people watching.\\nI had the bacon and eggs, which was decent, but i've had better, for less than $7 in this area. My friends had a burger, and a sandwich, which they both enjoyed, but I do find the prices here a little high for the area, and this restaurant. The servers are kitschy-cool and friendly enough, and it has a retro feel, but the special of the day was a double burger for $14 which I found a little pricey for the Hastings/Sunrise area.

The noodle& rice dishes are huge here!!!!! We had leftovers for dinner the next evening. \\nWhat we did NOT have leftovers of was the French toast with Hong Kong style tea which comes at a discounted rate when purchased together it was not like any French toast you've ever had and we ate every last piece.\\nThey are open late and have additional items on the menu between 11 AM and 5 PM and then again after 9 PM next time we will come during either of those hours."},{"name":"Akira sushi","address":"1718 NE 122nd Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"There are signs that tell you what each Sushi is with descriptions of what's in it.

They do not have a Seasons 52 in the Portland area, so we decided to go to Yard House.  I've always thought Yard House had excellent food (years ago), but this time was disappointing.\\n\\nWe ordered the following:\\n- Paradise Found cocktail - this was very tasty and I'd get it again.\\n- Filet and White Cheddar Melt - This was terribly disappointing.  Nothing \\"melt\\" about it...I wouldn't even say it was lukewarm...it was almost on the cold side.  The steak wasn't flavorful or tender.  The fries were also not fresh.\\n- Nashville Hot Chicken Sandwich - this was delicious.  The flavor of the fried chicken was on point.\\n\\nWe let our pleasant server know (afterward) that the melt was too cold (I know, we should have said something at first, but we were on a time crunch and usually don't like to be too difficult).  She said she'd talk to the manager and see if they could do anything about it.  After a while longer, she brought us the full price bill.  No manager, no discount, no nothing.

I know it makes sense to her, but to folks coming in it's a bit much.  Worse, the greeter I encountered today verbally attached you upon entry, \\"IS THIS YOUR FIRST TIME HERE?\\" And depending on your response she informs you of how the place is organized and then gives you orders to follow.  This is like a bad wedding planner who is stressed out.  The attitude of the greeter is contrary to what the ambiance behind her is intends - calm, chill.  \\n\\nThe service is also not the best.  People are friendly enough but it's a tad disorganized and you should expect a wait.\\n\\nThe food and beverages are good.  Not for the price however.  If you want really good Japanese fair, your best to walk around the corner to FuGaKyu.\\n\\nI do hope they settle in to whatever it is they are going for soon.
