The challenge in writing this review is how to describe this lovey, family-run gem in our neighborhood. We have been there about 6 times in the past 2 months. It is my number-one favorite restaurant in this foodie city, with the potential to be a long-standing classic in Portland (oh please oh please): mouth-watering food, outrageous portions, impeccable service, a warm atmosphere, and an unflinching attention to detail. All of this is due to the amazing owners, Leila (server) & Ali (chef). \\n\\nAMBIANCE: At first glance, there are contradictions between the exterior (lights flashing \\"Promise Land\\") and the interior (red tablecloths, china, crystal, roses, chandeliers). Don't let either fool you. It is neither ultra casual nor fancy-schmantzy. It is appropriate for any occasion: a casual Wednesday night, Saturday date night, a special occasion, family visiting, take out, etc. It may not seem family-friendly based on the interior, but it is friendly to families in the best sense of the word. They are so welcoming and would not frown for one moment if a child gets fussy, and other reviewers mention that they even entertain their children.Their small children can sometimes be seen peeking from behind the doors.\\n\\nFOOD: We have ordered most of the dishes on the menu, and we've covered fish, chicken, seafood, and red meat. Not a one has disappointed. At our last visit I said, \\"Chicken is not supposed to be this good.\\" The chicken and salmon appear to have been seared to form a slightly crispy brown exterior and a juicy interior. The hummus is delish! The dishes generally come with rice, carrots, & broccoli. I ask for the carrots only (not a broccoli fan): they are soaked in rose honey water and have a delicate sweetness. Every time, we take half of our entree home for at least one more meal. Dessert- the pound cake is a must-order: tastes like a Lebanese tiramisu without the coffee nor chocolate. It is two slices of toasted pound cake heaven with a creamy filling sprinkled with pistachios. Easily could be shared with 4 people, except it's so delicious that we polish it off between the two of us. And my partner doesn't even really like sweets. I think the rose water limonata might be the perfect drink: tart, sweet, complex... I'm sure they'd make it a cocktail if desired. The prices might seem a little steep, and I'd pay even more considering the taste and portion size.\\n\\nSERVICE: Attentive, warm and accommodating. They truly pay attention to their customers, and will go to great lengths to make them happy. On our second visit, they remembered where we sat and what we ordered. Do not hesitate to give feedback on a dish or request a dish to be altered. I bet they will bring you a fresh order. Also on our second visit, Ali came out to ask if I wanted to substitute shrimp for broccoli (!!). The pound cake originally came with a drizzle of chocolate the first time we ordered it. My partner doesn't like chocolate, so they brought us another without and insisted he try it warm before putting it in a to-go box. One time, they brought us a yummy pomegranate champagne drink for free. Leila describes each part of the meal, and is happy to share more details. They make every dish as ordered, and they gladly adjust meals (and even offer suggestions). \\n\\nI LOVE LOVE LOVE this restaurant. It is becoming busier & busier as more people discover it. Even though it may be a longer wait for a table, I want them to have well-deserved success."},{"name":"Screaming Goat","address":"900 W 10th St","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"The BEST breakfast tacos in town.

After my first review the owner gave me a ring and very kindly invited me back. He was very polite. It took 3 months but I wandered over finally. And it was better. Take out was the problem last time. So comparing chicken broth to chicken broth id say this place is more similar to rammenmam vs marutama. As in the broth doesn't start congealing as it gets cold like as marutama. Difference with ramenman being you actually get your food way faster here. They had me the same chicken truffle broth again. Its good. But definitely a higher price point. I think I'd do the regular chicken broths next time. I was comped a sweet yuzu drink and a yuzu parfait. The drink was really good but sweet. If you let the ice melt abit it's perfect. I was ambivalent about the parfait but great presentation and dessert by default is good. At this place you get very pleasant service and very spacious seating plus options beyond Ramen.  So all in all I think it's got a good future. \\n\\n\\nwanted to like this place since I did take a chance on it over my typical faves santouka and danbo.

Either way it turned out soft just like the Chinese instant noodles with the delivery boy on the front.  I got the expensive chicken truffle sea salt one. \\n\\nThe broth was good enough.

There's really not a whole lot I can be positive about with this diner. This is the 2nd and last time I'll be visiting. The last time I went was probably 2 years ago (right after they opened), and it wasn't good. This time, we needed food late and this place was close, so I thought, 'Hey, I'll give it a try again.' BIG mistake!\\n\\nI went with 4 friends and we were ALL disappointed with our food. We had: a burger w/ fries, tuna melt w/ coleslaw, chicken and waffles, and the loaded tater tots.\\n\\nFirst, the burger, which was the one with the goat cheese and tomato, was VERY small and didn't taste great. It was also partially pink (a BIG no, no!) but we had waited around 35 minutes for our food at this point so we didn't bother sending it back. The fries were ok, but waaaaaaay too salty. The tuna melt was ok, but I honestly make a better one at home and they were also a bit stingy with the tuna. The coleslaw was gross, lacking in flavor, and also tasted a bit old/spolied-ish. The chicken and waffles weren't good, and also expensive. They came with a side of gravy that my friend deemed, \\"nasty\\". It was completely watery. The loaded tater tots weren't too great, and the chili on top was not flavorful at all, so much so that after we all finished eating around the chili it was the only thing left on the plate! We only wanted the plain tater tots.\\n\\nOne of my other friends ordered a milk shake with her tots and the server completely forgot it. After we had finished eating, the manager came over to ask if everything was ok and she told him that she was still waiting on the milkshake. He said that he \\"would check on it\\". 10 minutes later our server came over and had no idea about the milkshake (and had completely forgotten she ordered it), so the manager obviously told her nothing about our waiting on it. He also never came back over to make sure we got it, etc. so there's a definite lack of management there as well.\\n\\nAfter all that, our meal took a total of about 1 hour, 20 mins. which is ridiculous at a diner for burgers, tater tots, etc. \\n\\nOur server was pretty inattentive and slow. WHAT A BUMMER. I want this place to be good, but man, they need to get a new chef who actually cooks good food. How awesome would it be to actually have an awesome diner to eat at that's local? I think IHOP and Denny's are honestly better, and that's saying a lot because I think those places are gross and I never eat there!\\n\\nLittle secret: My friends and I were tipsy, and we STILL thought it was horrible so what does that say?!

HOWEVER, i do think that ruth's is worth a visit if you have a few extra bucks at lunchtime. like, the second i left i texted my fiance to tell him that we have to go for a special lunch sometime. the prices for salads and sandwiches were in the $15 range, with the entrees a few bucks more. for us, these are prices for a moderately special occasion. it costs way more at dinner, but if it's been awhile since you've had a high class ho meal, i say you plan a luncheon date.\\n\\ni was surprised that the lunch portions filled me up. i figured they wouldn't. our table got three appetizers, and i had a few pieces of seared ahi tuna (WHICH BLEW MY MF MIND) and an osso bucco ravioli. with a couple pieces of bread, and then the tenderloin and portobello salad (which was INSANE), i left pleasantly satiated but not roll-me-out-the-door uncomfortably full. a couple coworkers that got entrees felt that way.\\n\\nthe only thing i didn't LOVE was this chocolate cake-ish thing that my coworkers brought back for me, as i had to leave before dessert to open up the office. i am one of those chicks that can't function without chocolate every day, yet this was just too chocolatey and rich for me. it wasn't cakey, but it didn't taste like flourless cakes or tortes that i've had before. anyway, it was good for a bite or two, but i know i didn't finish more than half, and i actually think the rest of it may have ended up in the trash."},{"name":"Carl's Jr","address":"12140 SW Scholls Ferry Rd","city":"Tigard","stars":"2.5","text":"Went here after a bad experience at McDonald's earlier.

The taste was alright, but the thickness made me full quickly and disinclined in sipping the majority of the broth. The broth is the soul of ramens- unfortunately, our souls did not click that night. The broth during their soft opening, however, was normal. Perhaps it was just a bad night. \\n\\n-All their ramens are based off of chicken broths. Boston needs more tonkotsu broth places :( \\n\\n+Since their soft opening, their service has improved with friendlier and more prompt service. \\n\\n---Cash only. Hate that. It doesn't help Allston is very short on BoA ATMs.\\n\\n-It's hard to put into words, but Boston's Totto or any ramen scene in Bean Town for that matter is just not the same compared to NY. Having Japanese staff and having a shop in East Village -the Japan town of NYC- changes your dining experience psychologically. Not to mention there's huge competition in NY for any establishment to survive, thus quality is of the utmost importance. It's common practice for the chef to sip their broth before serving it to the public. If quality was of the essence and deeply rooted in their practice, they would not have let that cornstarch-broth go through. \\n\\nAfter we left Totto, my honey and I agreed the gods must have punished us for choosing Totto over Pikaichi as we used to be Pika fans :P"},{"name":"Nubian Queen Lola's Cajun Soul Food","address":"1815 Rosewood Ave","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"This place is amazing!

No. Perhaps it was the hype, or perhaps it was the fact that they just changed their chef de cuisine, or perhaps it was because we went at an unwittingly poor time (more on that below), but I was way underwhelmed. \\n\\nFOOD.\\nWe did the 8 course tasting menu because, honestly, their pricing scheme pushes you that way. it was our anniversary and we thought, What the heck. The 8 courses were supplemented with an app amuse and a dessert amuse, plus truffles with the check. We did leave completely stuffed, but for over a $400 tab, we had better be!\\n\\nSome things were amazing (like the dessert amuse, a Concord grape and kaffir lime sorbet served with basil seeds and a vanilla foam; venison with a sweet apple puree was my husband's favorite). My favorite savory was hake roasted just past raw--flaky, tender, sea-salty, with lovely tender roasted mussels and nice bright radish curls. \\n\\nMost things were yummy but not special, and a couple things were mis-steps (an amuse of kombucha-marinated mackerel so unrelievedly fishy it seemed like no one could have tasted it before leaving the kitchen; pork belly served lukewarm so the fat was rubbery instead of melty; and while I loved it, there were *bones* in the hake--at this price point, not cool). Also, in 8 courses, not ONE was vegetable-based or focused. I felt heavy and too full of protein at the end of the meal. The only veggie-ish course was pasta made of corn...with rabbit and guanciale. Bread tasted good but was either old or had been stored in plastic--tough, chewy crusts.\\n\\nAMBIENCE.\\nI like the decor. They seem to be shooting for bustling French cafe-feeling, which they do sort of achieve...but only too well. In the main dining room, there are simply too many tables for the space; it's crowded. Despite the nice lighting and warm surroundings, it does not feel intimate or cozy. The bathrooms were utilitarian and not immaculate--in one, a trash bin was overflowing--and again, just took away from what should be a luxe experience.\\n\\nThe music was flat-out awful. Alt-rock, electronic blues, stuff I might want to listen to while driving or working out but certainly not while lingering over a ridiculously extravagant meal. It was so bad we asked our waitress about it, who said that on Sunday nights after 9 it's a \\"manager's special\\" of music where they play whatever they want. We were seated at 7:30, though, and the music was something both my husband and I noticed right away. It seriously detracted from our experience, partly because it was being played loudly and compounded the issue of poor acoustics in the space. We often could not hear each other across the table. Hardly romantic.\\n\\nSERVICE.\\nAfter a chilly reception at the door, we had a darling waitress. The pacing of the courses was excellent. However, beverage service was off-kilter, and while she was super friendly and attentive, the waitress was weak on wine (and it's a small list). We had a spill at the table and it was handled well once someone noticed. \\n\\nIn sum, the next time I want a real splurge dinner out I'll return to the superb Journeyman or try for Bondir; and for a celebratory delicious meal whose tab is easier to stomach, I will keep returning to my beloved Bergamot."},{"name":"Red Lentil Vegetarian & Vegan Restaurant","address":"600 Mt Auburn St","city":"Watertown","stars":"4","text":"I love this place.

The rice was also extremely well made--simple but tasty. The yogurt and cucmber side was bland, but we ate take out and maybe sprinkling on some sumac that they keep on the tables would have helped. The falafel sandwich was good, but not extraordinary, and the salads were pretty average. The chicken barg was on the dry side and very mildly seasoned, although that might be the way it is supposed to be.\\n\\nWe'll definitely be back for our favorite dishes though.

This was by far the worst experience.\\n\\nMy friends and I stayed on a Saturday night.  We started off trying to find parking.  The front desk gave us a paper and directed us to a parking lot that they have an arrangement with for $15 a night.  When we arrived at the parking garage, the sketchy guy said we were late (it was 5pm) and we needed to give him the keys.  The whole experience was so weird we drove around aimlessly until finding a nearby church which was lucky as they only charged us $8.50 for the night!  \\n\\nWhen we got to our rooms, it was a surprise to see just how small and loud they were.  The walls are VERY thin and the windows are not sealed, causing lots of street noise and noise from your neighbors.  The beds were exceptionally uncomfortable and I swear my whole room was slightly slanted with huge cracks in the ceiling/walls.  Someone had a dog in the room next to mine, which barked for hours and there was a domestic dispute in the room next to my friend's which lasted through the night.  When we advised the front desk the next morning (after getting only a few hours of on and off sleep) they simply said, oh, we'll look into that, there shouldn't have been any dogs...then charged our cards.\\n\\nWe ran into issues at every turn.  When I asked about passport stamps, which was the whole reason for our stay, in the evening the girl at the front desk said we couldn't get stamps at Crystal Ballroom due to a private event, but could attend the tour at 2pm the next day, which was after the time we'd be leaving.  Super frustrated no one told us about the 2pm tour when we came and asked about stamps and parking at 1pm.  We were also told we would need to pay to get into Lola's Room.  Fortunately we asked again when we got there, because hotel guests get in for free!\\n\\nLots of misinformation and overall poor customer service from the front desk.  Additional training is definitely needed as well as some improvements to the rooms (new mattresses and window insulation).  Edgefield, Kennedy School and the new Anderson School know how to do it right.  Crystal needs to get their act together with several components.

Over-priced, underwhelmed. Referred by a friendly guy we met in the park. \\n\\nGuys ordered the Thai iced tea: fine, but nothing special. I had the turmeric whiskey sour: good, but pricey ($12). \\nWe had the spicy chicken wings, savory, but very salty. Good flavor, though. Next up, the $17 scallop special. False advertising there. We were told it'd be 3 scallops: one for each of the three of us, we thought. WRONG. After we commented on the lack of scallops, we were actually told they were \\"sliced thinly.\\" Translation: one scallop sliced into 3 pieces! Ordered the pork salad; was told that was a favorite here. VERY salty; we couldn't even finish it. We guessed it was old and they had tried to reflavor it. Also had the beef noodle soup: that was our best dish. Enjoyed that. \\nBOTTOM LINE: WAY TOO MUCH MONEY FOR NOT THAT GREAT OF FOOD. By the time we got home, my belly wasn't feeling very good and, as I write this 2 hours later, I'm still very queasy and bloated. Not worth it at all. \\n\\nOur server was fine.

However, some people need them, due to sensitive teeth, etc. he did go upstairs to get me a straw from the seafood and wine bar upstairs. I really appreciated it! \\n\\nThe pizza had good flavor, but wasn't quite cooked enough on the bottom, so it was soggy. We had the margarita with add prosciutto and arugula.  Just an FYI, the prosciutto comes not cooked into the pizza. I prefer my prosciutto crispy. And the arugula is also freshly placed once the pie is cooked.\\n\\nThe salads are too big. And they don't offer a half salad option like some other restaurants in the area does. The reg price for the one salad we had was $12. It was an ok price. But I'm not a huge eater, and my hubby only eats a few bites off my salad. So I ended up wasting half the salad...even if they charged $7 for a half salad, I bet they would sell more and have more satisfied customers.\\n\\nWe ordered the meatballs, and since they were pork, and we couldn't tell if they were cooked properly, we didn't get to taste them. Hubby was on lunch and we didn't have time for them to correct it, though they were very happy to correct if we wanted. And he gladly took them off the bill. Also, hubby is a very experienced cook, and even he thought they looked undone. He wouldn't let me use my fork, after I had cut into the meatball with it....and usually he makes fun of me cuz I'm like is that cooked?!? So that's how I know, those meatballs were underdone. \\n\\nI had a fountain soda, they carry coke products... and they were very generous with refills. I didn't feel ignored, and they were moderately busy.  \\n\\nOverall, they have a good concept, but they need to make a few tweaks to make me want to come back.  \\n\\nMainly the 3 stars are because the food was almost there, and our waiter went the extra mile to make us feel taken care of. \\n\\nThere were charred parts to our pizza, but it was not a hinderance. Also, the food was fresh. While we were there they had a delivery of fresh greens. They def have their hearts in the right place, but like I said, it's just a bit off. \\n\\nI wish this new place well, but I'm not sure I want to go back."},{"name":"Chambar","address":"568 Beatty Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4","text":"Had brunch here for the first time, and it was a great experience.

This was the best steak I have ever eaten.\\n\\nThe mashed potatoes weren't great. They had the consistency of instant boxed mashed. But I did really like the button mushrooms, light and tasty. \\n\\nAs for service, our waiter gets a 1 star, and the manager Jeff gets a 5 star. Our waiter was annoyed/put off/mad/etc that we were dining at his table. Not sure if he was like this to all of his restaurant wk customers or what. We were friendly to him despite his condescending suggestions about ordering the most expensive wines or appetizers, etc. He'd mutter something then look around the room as if he couldn't believe he was waiting on such low life.\\n\\nHowever, Jeff (the hostess told us his name), was great. He stopped by the table a few times (without overdoing it) and made some nice suggestions/jokes. He talked about the shrimp appetizer and how it was his fav, and suggested we get some more bread to eat the sauce with. He also talked my mom through the martini list and got our waiter so she could order one. Ruth's Chris is lucky to have a guy like Jeff!!

The pad thai is terrific, curries are great, and the chicken basil has a nice bite to it.  Warning: the food here is quite spicy.  If you can't handle spicy food, be very careful what you order.  Personally, I like the kick that they give their dishes.  While the prices are a little higher than most thai restaurants (curries and stir fry dishes run around $13-14), the portions are enormous and definitely big enough for 2.

Its expected.  I'm not ok with a server who is complacent and just has no sense of urgency.  When we finally seated, we ordered drinks.  We didn't see the server back for almost 15 minutes with our drinks.  Then when they dumped our food, it was impossible to get her attention.  When she was there, she wasn't really that nice, and we just felt like Salt Lick was doing us the favor. \\n\\nIt doesn't matter how good the food is, There's no excuse for bad service and bad experience.  It made me feel like The Salt Lick felt like they really didn't need our business because they already had so much.  I really won't go back probably.  $20 a person is a lot for what you get, and they do the same old trick where they serve you loads of bread right when you sit down.  \\n\\nIt won't matter what I say, they will still get the business.

First, no where online or in any communication with the restaurant did it indicate that we were actually supposed to go into the restaurant NEXT DOOR (called Paradee?) to find the \\"secret bookshelf\\" entrance that lead to Langbaan. My husband and I were walking about outside - in the rain of course - looking for an actual door to the restaurant we had reservations for. Finally, we gave up and went next door to ask for directions. We walked into the hostess area and asked \\"Where do we go to find Langbaan?\\" And the man with a handwritten clipboard of last names for reservations abruptly replied: \\"we're not ready yet, I'm seating people now, just wait\\". Already without even having one bite I was looking at strike 1 and strike 2 for this spot.

However, neither of us cared for the soup -tofu, mushrooms and broth combo. \\n\\nI think we had about 3 different \\"servers\\" bring the food to us at any given point throughout the night - not sure the system here nor did the latter 2 introduce themselves before jumping right into a laundry list of random ingredients and spices in each dish. I was also very disappointed that there was no way to de-spice the spicy dishes, or at least get the spicy sauce on the side.

I've tried their Grilled Cheese Sandwich, Cheddar & Green Onion Scone, Pain au Chocolat, and Monkey Bread. The food was decent, with the standout being their scone, which was very tender, moist and flavourful. The prices are fairly reasonable.

The sandwich was a good size and had a pretty generous amount of filling, and was quite rich. I did find the cheese to be a bit too sharp and pungent for my liking - I personally would liked a bit milder cheese. The bread was nicely toasted and tender near the centre, although I did find it to be a bit too hard near the edges and hurt my mouth a bit.\\n\\nPain au Chocolat ($3.50):\\n3/5\\nThe pastry was buttery, and had a nice bit of saltiness. I found the outer layer to be a bit on the chewy side, and not flaky enough for my liking. The chocolate was good quality and was not waxy. Not the best croissant I've had, but still tasty.\\n\\nCheddar & Green Onion Scone ($3):\\n4/5\\nThe scone was rich and had a great savoury flavour and fragrance from the onions. The interior is incredibly moist and tender. It is a bit on the salty side; while I personally really enjoy the salt, it may get a bit overwhelming for some others after several bites.\\n\\nMonkey Bread ($3.75):\\n3/5\\nThis consisted of pieces of croissants baked together with cinnamon sugar and orange peel. The dough was pretty soft and buttery, and was mildly sweet with a nice fragrance from the cinnamon.

I'm an exec for a very successful restaurant chain in the bay area.  Blitz does things differently from the way we do it - and suffers from it.    For example, I went to Blitz Ladd during the day on a weekend recently, and our server had about 15 tables AND had to pour her own beers.  Was she running around frantically?  Yes.  Did we get our food on time?  Nope.  Was our food warm?  Nope (we watched it sitting there for 5 minutes). Did she remember to bring us more napkins as we asked?  Nope.  Did my beer get refilled?  Nope.  Did I want more beer?  Yes.  Did she ask how things were?  Nope.   Did she lose sales?  Yep.  We we happy?  Nope.  Did her tip suffer?  Oh yeah.    I asked our server if she enjoyed havng so many tables.  She said she loves having tons of table because her tips are better that way.   This is a very common misconception in the restuarant business.  The fact is:  if you skimp on labor, service suffers, it is impossible to delever true hospitality, and everyone makes less money.

It was overwhelmingly full of sausage, like overcooked sausage crumbles piled on top of tasty ravioli drowning in what was supposed to be a butter sauce, but it was extremely creamy, like they added too much dairy.  (Perhaps the dairy that should've gone towards the mashed potatoes.)\\n\\nThe white chocolate bread pudding would've been excellent if not for the strawberry coulis, which I'll say was more like strawberry preserves.  And there was so much of it; disgustingly so, it really masked the flavor of the actual dessert.  Hated it.\\n\\nI kinda got what they were aiming for with the bananas foster belgian waffle.  Though to be honest, it was absolutely poorly executed.  And it had nuts on top.  Like, why?\\n\\nAmbiance is cool.  The wine list is huge.  Our server was around, and when she wasn't, the manager was to see how we were enjoying our meals.  And we had a great view of a quaint lil' town center.

Enough rave reviews have been written so I won't dwell on the fact that the kitchen staff do a great job of turning out quality product.\\n\\nThe service however was lacking. The busboy was on top of his job but after the appetizer our waiter pretty much vanished for the evening and we waited an inordinate amount of time to receive our main course.

No tomatoes or peppers either. A small scoop of rice and 3 pieces of steak for $9.\\n\\nNext for the Nachos - no pico de gallo left and no beans available. A pile of chips with a spoonful of queso and chicken and that is about it after requesting no olives and jalapenos. \\n\\nThe quesadilla was bland without any of the typical grilled vegetables included, as they were out of everything except lettuce. It was tossed on the grill to melt the cheese and thrown in a Styrofoam box with some chips dumped on top. \\n\\nThe salsa bar needed some attention, many of the choices were empty and as a \\"self serve\\" bar it was of course a mess.

Also the owner/chef is an incredibly sweet man. He puts out the best food the he himself makes, and although there is [less than] minimal seating, nothing is really lost in getting the food for takeout. It's worth the parking and the lack of seating and all of it, it's really amazing, authentic food.

My. God. I think I had an out-of-body experience. If you like Cajun soul food, this place is amazing.\\n\\nI had the chicken and waffles, a bowl of gumbo and some of Lola's Special Tea. All of it was delicious. The tea had a pleasant kick to it, the gumbo was tasty and spicy but not overwhelming, and the waffles were nice and fluffy. However, the real standout was Lola's fried chicken. I can confidently say that out of all the fried chicken I've eaten in my entire life, hers was the best. Hot and juicy, plus she just smothered each wing in this--I know I should be careful with what I say, but I just can't think of a better term--*orgasmic* seasoning. \\n\\nFor the money we paid, the portions were BIG. A small bowl of gumbo is plenty, plus two pancakes and like five delicious chicken wings and up to three free refills on tea. \\n\\nThe only two downsides, which are very minor, is that A) the place is small, maybe four tables, and B) the food does take a long time to get to you. But that's because it's run by one person, the friendly and spiritual Lola (who hails from Lake Charles, LA), and she makes all the food from scratch. Not to worry though, as this place has enough character that you can take in the atmosphere and chat while you wait for your food. There are plenty of decorations and even several leather goods for sale such as cups and pouches and ornaments, mostly New Orleans Saints gear. \\n\\nAt any rate, even if the wait may be long, the food is totally worth the time. My dad had the jambalaya, cabbage and black eyed peas and he was equally satisfied with his meal. One thing I should add about the jambalaya though is that it wasn't very spicy. I know people who know their soul food really love spicy gumbo, so I don't know if that may be a turnoff. I hate spice and it didn't affect me, so you might want to request a spicier bowl from Lola.\\n\\nOn a small note, Nubian Queen Lola's is in what's considered a not-so-nice part of town (corner of Chicon and Rosewood). But even so my dad and I went during the day and we weren't worried for our safety at all. I'm not sure if anyone's been concerned by that, but it's really not too dangerous.

Besides, my wife, whose 71st birthday it was, didn't want to climb up onto a stool and sit there for an hour plus. I was told it would be a 15-20 minute wait.

I can't see how this restaurant is so highly rated. It wasn't bad. It just didn't impress anybody. We ordered five different appetizers with only the Irish Egg scoring highly. The rest? Just OK, no better. The entrees(Banger & Booz, roast chicken, shrimp and pea risotto among others) did not rise above that level. The kids found nothing on the menu they would eat. The bill?

We planned ahead and made reservations for 830pm on a Saturday and arrived 15 minutes early. People were out on the sidewalk crowding the door and it was a pain in the ass to navigate the gauntlet of Atlanta's  \\"in crowd\\" just to get inside. When we finally made it to the hostess table we said we had a reservation and of course they were running \\"a little behind\\" but  the host was very gracious in keeping us informed about when our table would be ready so we decided to park ourselves at the bar while we waited. Tucker our bartender was great, recommended a bold  red from Argentina that I enjoyed and was very attentive even though they were slammed. Unfortunately with the massive amount of people there it was hard to enjoy much of anything because someone was always beside you or behind you attempting to get to the bar. I recommend coming early or early during the week because it is just overwhelming the amount of people they try and pack into the place. 45 minutes later we were taken to our table where we were seated less than two feet away from a 6 top with a group of people who apparently went to Paris, Italy and a few other places in the last month. The couple on our other side, again less than two feet away, were at least semi quiet. If you enjoy being a part of other diners meals and hearing everything they did that day or being able to read their text messages then this is the place for you. Our server Kaylee was very good but had to squeeze herself in between tables at times and as you eat it's tough to really enjoy your food when you're that close to other people talking on the phone, texting or simply talking so loud you want to stuff olives in your ears. \\nBut I digress..onto the FOOD! On the whole ok to good but nothing that blew us away. I ordered the olives which were good, then the ceviche and for $10 you expect more than three bites but no that's about all you get. My wife got the wild mushroom with herb goat cheese which was very good as were the batata bravas(the sauce of Heinz ketchup with mayo plus liberal amounts of paprika has you thinking for a second but no its base is just ketchup...). The serrano ham and cheese croquetas were underwhelming with almost no ham and the fried cauliflower was good but again LIBERALLY dusted with paprika. We basically stayed with the tapas and bread which was good so you won't starve while you're there. We did not try the desserts although they all look great and sound very tasty. I liked the fireplace outside but again hard to enjoy anything because there are people everywhere!! I caught a glimpse of it between people and said, \\"wow\\". The service by Tucker, Kaylee and others was great so in that regard I cannot complain but the downside is you are quite literally sitting with other people as you eat and that is a huge turnoff. I will go back again but at a less crowded time and will request a table on the patio no matter what and will gladly wait for it. Inside is just over the top loud and so packed that it's really tough to enjoy much. I'll give it another chance but as I said I've had better both in atmosphere and food."},{"name":"McMenamins Crystal Hotel","address":"303 SW 12th Ave.","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Hotel was very kitschy and cool.

My boyfriend, Jason L, however, lives for the stuff, so I agreed to accompany him to the Salty Pig, with the promise of a pizza compromise.\\n\\nFirst things first, they do not take reservations for parties less than 6. It is a small space and there isn't really a lot of place to idle while waiting for your table.  We went on a Monday night around 8pm and were told it was a 45 minute wait. The hostess took our name and number. We were granted access to an app that allowed us to see how many patrons were ahead of us, and were told that they'd text us when our table became available. I LOVED this accommodation. It allowed Jason L and I a more civilized waiting experience. We happily skipped across the street and had a drink. Table was free within 45 minutes, text came promptly and we were seated immediately.\\n\\nWe ordered: \\n\\n1) Prosciutto di Parma, Aged 16 Months: $8\\n2) Porchetta, Pork Shoulder, Fennel Pollen, Rosemary: $7\\n3)Manchego de Corcuera, Sheep, Aged 3 Months, Rich & Buttery: $6\\n4)Bianco Sardo, Sardenia, Sheep, Aged 6 Months, Sharp: $7\\n5) Marinated Olives: $3\\n6) Marcona Almonds: $3\\n7) Fig Jam: $2\\n8) Pizza Bianca, Speck, Brussel Sprouts, Provolone, Sunnyside Egg: $16\\n\\nVerdict: WAY TOO MUCH FOOD! We didn't need the pizza, the meat and cheese board filled us up, but damn I'm happy we got it anyway. We were both very happy with the price point, the meat and cheese servings were large and delicious. The olives are addicting- I wouldn't judge you if you ordered two servings of these bad boys. The almonds are buttery. The meat and cheeses are served with huge helpings of perfectly crispy, buttery, lovingly charred bread. You will want to eat this bread on its own. Don't do it. Smother it with cheesy goodness. Fig jam tastes awesome with the sharp cheeses. YADA YADA meat and cheese perfection...\\n\\nBut OH!, the PIZZA! Dear god. The Pizza Bianca was the best pizza i've ever had, AND I LIVED IN NEW YORK CITY. It was salty, it was savory, it was melty, and cheesy and it was  cooked to perfection.  If I could eat it every night of the week. I want it in my belly right now. SIGH. The only reason why I'm not eating it right now is 1) Salty Pig is not currently open and 2) I live in Quincy and it's hard to get to on the regular. I literally hate all the people that live within walking distance of this pizza.... but I digress...\\n\\nSpace was warm, intimate, dark but not depressingly so. The small bar space was bustling and lively. Food came promptly. Christy, our before mentioned server was awesome! She cheered us on as we ordered, and congratulated us on our \\"exquisite taste.\\" She checked on us frequently and explained all of our choices to us and suggested pairings. She did everything right in terms of service, but really what made her special was her warmth and enthusiasm. At the end of the night, Christy surprised us with a free desert and thanked US for being so nice!? We were completely shocked and a little embarrassed. Shouldn't we be thanking her for being so great? Anyways, it was some sort of chocolate thing, and it was delicious, obviously. \\n\\nI think I can safely speak for Jason L on this one, we are definitely going back!\\n\\nP.S.

While she was there, we asked whether or not the pizzas were sharing sized (for 15-18, it could go either way). She said they weren't really, and we were cool with that. What was less cool was that I felt like our treatment after that went kind of down hill. It was clear that she was much more attentive to the table next to us (you're kind of close, so it's hard to miss). Even if we had split the entree, we tip really well when that's the case, so please don't assume that we're cheap a****.\\n\\nWe ended up ordering two pizzas, neither of which were very good. My husband got one with sausage, mushroom, and artichoke. The sausage was gristly, and the artichokes tasted like they came straight from a can. I got a four-cheese pizza, which would have been fine, except they made it with smoked mozzarella. Many of the pizzas featured smoked mozzarella, and I avoided them, because I'm not a fan. The four-cheese wasn't labeled as such, so this was disappointing.\\n\\nThe bread was pretty terrible, but the wine was good.

You still get that gust of fresh air from the water.\\n\\nAtmosphere:\\n- The minute you walk in you see a raw bar with all sorts of seafood waiting to be gobbled up. It is a very simple and open concept. Very modern looking atmosphere and always loud and lively. There is a large patio located at the back of the restaurant. Although it is next to a main street, it isn't too loud or bad at all.\\n- This place is pretty trendy. Most of the people are there from work so expect lots of business attire.. it isn't essential but i don't think wearing sweats and a t-shirt would suffice.\\n\\nService:\\n- Their service was amazing. Quick, nice and comforting. They started off us with drinks and explained to us how the menu works and presented us with a small card. \\n\\nFood:\\n- I'm a bit biased as I love seafood, especially raw seafood. But how it works at this place is you can order A La Carte for any types of seafood you want. They have anything from mussels, clams, oysters, shrimp, fish ceviche, scallops, etc. My suggestion is if you are going with a party of two to just get the Seafood Tower. It's a 3 tier tower loaded with seafood. It's more than enough for two people. There's nothing more gratifying than having fresh seafood on a patio on a nice evening. Just disregard the people staring at you when there's a tower presented to your table and you can't see your partner on the other side of the tower.\\n- They also have a wide range of drinks. Lots of craft beers and wine selections. I'm a craft beer buff so I was in love the minute they presented me the drink menu.\\n\\nPrice:\\n- Besides the fact that the Canadian dollar is bad, the pricing for this place was fair. You are going be spending a good penny but it is definitely well worth it.\\n\\nOverall:\\n- Definitely a must try. I will keep coming to this place each time i visit Boston.

The wine list (although interestingly un-local, with only Old World wines) is expansive, the cocktails (and bartenders) are top-notch, and the service is impeccable.\\n\\nI took my father here for his birthday and we both got the Sunday night's \\"Chef's Whim,\\" a 6-course tasting menu which included probably the best lentil soup I've ever had (with a little slab of melt-in-your-mouth pork belly on top, natch), perfectly fried smelt, and a to-die-for Taza chocolate mousse dessert. If you're going to make it over to Craigie for a special occasion meal, I can't recommend one of the tasting menus enough.\\n\\nThe genius of Craigie, however, is that it's not just for tasting-menu haute cuisine experiences. I was here with friends earlier this week to try Craigie's legendary burger. All of the ingredients are calculated, including several cuts of fresh ground steak, bone marrow, and miso paste. Seriously. (http://www.goodeater.org/2009/11/24/cheffing-with-tony-maws-not-just-a-cheeseburger/) It's not going to satisfy your craving for an old-fashioned burger, but it might push the boundaries of what you think a burger could be. Coarse ground meat makes it surprisingly light and juicy -- really a treat. Accompanied with duck fat fried brussels sprouts (oh my god yes) and a top-notch charcuterie plate, it made for a decadent weeknight meal.\\n\\nFinally, it's worth noting that Craigie has a bar to back up everything. The $20 \\"Cocktail Whim\\" is well worth your cocktail dollars -- the expert bartenders will make your four miniature cocktails, drawing from a menu of both classics and more modern and original creations, starting from light, fruity, and sparkling and ending with something rich and desserty. Out cocktail flight ended with their original Jerez flip, merging sherry, Pimm's, Benedictine, and egg into an absolutely delicious nightcap.\\n\\nCraigie may not be cheap, but I'd say it is easily worth the money.

We stumbled across Giacomo's and decided to go in because we were on the hunt for calamari and an antipasto plate.  They had both on the menu and we were in luck!  We ordered both of these items and a glass of wine.  Everything came out quickly.  As soon as the appetizers were delivered, our waitress, Rose Marie (or Rosemary), asked us what we'd like for dinner.  We told her we weren't planning on eating dinner, and that what we had was just fine.  Apparently this set her off.  She snatched the menus out of our hands and proceeded to ask again if we were having dinner.  We told her we were not.  She then let us know that she wasn't going to let us sit there for 30 minutes and then decide to eat, and that the appetizers were all we were getting.  Unfortunately, her lack of concern for the customer totally ruined our experience.  She went and complained to a waitress 3 feet away from us about how we weren't eating dinner.  I didn't realize that was a requirement for the restaurant.  I would have ranked this with one star; however, everything we ordered tasted great. The run in with Rose Marie/Rosemary made us feel extremely awkward for the rest of our time there, and we couldn't get out of there faster.  She didn't check on us after that except to deliver the bill.  \\n\\nOverall?  Definitely not worth it if you're looking for a good experience or if you just want appetizers.  The awkward feeling overshadowed the taste of the food and unfortunately that's the memory we walked away with, as well as the one we've told our friends."},{"name":"Giacomo's Ristorante - Boston","address":"355 Hanover St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"food is okay but the\\nservice 0 stars\\n\\nThe painful wait later , the service that you get is inadequate to say the least !

As a former vegetarian for many years, it has taken me quite some time to cross over into eating certain types of meat. BBQ, brisket, ribs - all of these were my last frontier. I opted to order the bbq brisket sandwich instead of the plate o' meat. The sandwich was enormous and the brisket was melt in your mouth fantastic. Even though I was tasting my way into a sweet bbq brisket food coma, I probably would have attacked anyone who tried to take even a morsel of meat off of my plate. It was so damn good I wanted to vomit a little so that I could make room to finish off this ginormous Texas sized sandwich.  \\nThis place gets down to business. I expected a small restaurant since it was so far outside Austin, while in fact it's like going to the county fair with parking for acres and the restaurant must easily seat 300 people. I love the no frills menu, the BYOB option, and the fact that I left with the happiest belly full o' beef I've ever experienced. Even cooler was when I tried to take a photo of the amazing bbq pit, the cook stopped me, invited me back into the kitchen to take a photo with the best gander at the mass quantities of meat cooking at one time.  I doubt I'll be back in Austin anytime soon, but at least the Salt Lick will pack and deliver their fantastically sweet bbq fare.

Food and drinks came in a timely manner and we were asked to make sure everything was okay just the right number of times, not overbearing but also not a non-existent service.\\n\\nAtmosphere: All of the tables were full, a nice ambient calm type of music playing. The general feel of the place was that nothing was out of place. Very impressive decor and presentation. A lot of hustle and bustle from servers, but that is a given, it's a busy place! Bar looked impressive, but it was a little to early to be perusing that part of this establishment. \\n\\nFood: Ordering from the \\"Brunch\\" menu. I had the Gaufre Au Saumon which is Gravlax spring salmon, savory waffle, yuzu dill hollandaise, poached eggs and pea tips. First of all, let me say, presentation was very amazing. The salmon was the star of the show, very fresh and of a very high quality. Nothing was out of place, fresh greens, perfectly poached eggs with the hollandaise. All of this on a waffle. It's just an odd concept to me, a savory waffle, but it worked so well. \\n\\nDrinks: I ordered still water (a choice of still or sparkling) and a coffee. I simply asked for a coffee which I assume is of the drip type. It was satisfactory. Apparently they have very nice artisan lattes, next time I shall have to try them!\\n\\nPrice: My entr√©e was $19 (CAD) which is very reasonable for the quality and the presentation.

Very tastefully done and clean! I wish every restaurant had restrooms like these!\\n\\nOverall: What a great deal, luckily we got a seat as we had not pre-booked a table.

Overall, the food is great, there is very extensive vegetarian (much which can be made vegan) options, the service is swift and attentive, and the restaurant itself has always been clean and nice.\\n\\nThe Service:\\nWe have gone to Tamarind a handful of time in the last couple months.  We have yet to receive any sort of bad service.  The waitstaff (who seem to work every night without break) is kind and always willing to strike up a conversation with you as long as they are not busy.  Every waiter as well as the kitchen has been considerate and completely accommodating with my wife and I's veganism.  Most importantly, our water glasses are always full and any extra requests we have are promptly dealt with.\\n\\nThe Atmosphere:\\nAlthough Tamarind does not look like much from the outside, the interior is much better than your average \\"hole-in-the-wall.\\"  The floors and decorations have always been clean, and we have never gotten dirty dishes or dinnerware.  The decor is semi-typical for an Indian restaurant, but not at all \\"cheap\\" in the sense where it detracts from the experience.\\n\\nThe Food:\\nMost importantly, the food is absolutely superb!  We have tried quite a few different items on the menu that we could eat as vegans.  Our favorite dish for sure is the Vegetable Jalfrezi.  If we are feeling very hungry, we both get one (wife:medium spice, me: extra quadruple Indian hot spicy) and then have plenty to take home for lunch the next day.  Many times though we just split one Jalfrezi and order a Dosa as well for an appetizer.  We have tried the Spring Dosa, Mysore Masala Dosa, and the Vegetable Utthpam.  In our experience you get more filling with the Spring Dosa (extra veggies as to be expected since it is $0.50 more), but we like all of them pretty equally.  Which Dosa we order is really dependent on our mood.  We have also tried the Tadka Dal which was very good as well, but we just prefer a larger variety of vegetables and therefore stick with the Jalfrezi.  Just note that the Jalfrezi is not available during lunch though :(\\n\\nAll in all, if you want some great Indian food, especially if you are looking for vegan/vegetarian options,  you will not be disappointed with Tamarind."},{"name":"Pambiche","address":"2811 NE Glisan St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"I did myself a huge favor by going to Pambiche to try Cuban food for the FIRST TIME EVER!

There we were, playing the last hole of disc golf out at Pease Park before they remove the disc golf course there for good, bitching about how hungry we all were, and then BAM.  Words were exchange.  Friendships were strained.  A mad dash towards the cars ensued, followed by a medium speed chase down North Lamar towards the Screaming Goat.  I'm a scientist, dammit!  I need facts!\\n\\nI'm not going to leave you in suspense.  Look elsewhere for descriptions of the cute house and borderline surly staff.  Let's cut right to the chase.  While the Screaming Goat does make fine tacos,  I would not say that they are anywhere near as good as Torchy's.  They're cheaper, but that's only if you want the bare minimum on your taco.  If you want extra swag like cheese, guac, or a different type of salsa than the standard verde, you gotta pay extra.  Once you add in all those costs, the price is comparable to Torchy's while the taste falls short.  I ordered a fish taco and an adobado chicken taco.  They were both good, and the salsa verde was just spicy enough, but I like Torchy's better.\\n\\nThe one thing this place has that Torchy's does not is spiced Mexican beer.  They add lime, Worcestershire sauce, and Tabasco to a Mexican beer and serve it in a chilled glass with a salted rim.  After a morning of tossing discs,  that was the most refreshing beverage I think I've ever had.  Absolutely delicious.  I would come back here for that alone."},{"name":"Red Lentil Vegetarian & Vegan Restaurant","address":"600 Mt Auburn St","city":"Watertown","stars":"4","text":"Last week I was lucky enough to go to the Red Lentil for their fixed menu/fixed price pre-Thanksgiving dinner.\\n\\nFirst, can I just say that growing up in the Boston area as a vegetarian teenager I never in my dreams could have imagined that a restaurant like the Red Lentil would ever exist outside of California?\\n\\nDinner was amazing.

It's similar to Verna's, but with a slightly more durable glaze and a slightly less rich fry. On the plus side, they also frost it with chocolate. Which, when you get down to it, is a pretty huge plus side.\\n\\nSpeaking of plus sides, their maple frosted raised donut is the best in the business. And by \\"the business\\" I mean \\"greater Boston.\\" That frosting has a wonderful, substantial texture that makes biting into one of those a weirdly visceral experience, even though the raised dough is exactly as soft and rich as it ought to be. \\n\\nThe buttercrunch is the other go-to raised -- it's a butternut covering on a raised, glazed donut. They're common out west, where standard butternuts almost don't exist, but I don't see many around here.  \\n\\nTheir other cake  donuts are fun too -- the dough they use for the old fashioneds is sweet and pure in a most undonutlike way.

The flavors I tried were plain, spicy bbq, and sea salt caramel.  The actual kernels of all three flavors are fluffy and fresh with not a hint of staleness.\\n\\nStarting with my favorite, the caramel.  The caramel has formed a nice solid shell without being sticky or overwhelming the actual popcorn.  It is pretty sweet, but when cut with the salt forms a nice combination.  This stuff is addictive and is a diet breaker for sure. I'm having a hard time resisting just shotgunning the entire bag.\\n\\nThe spicy bbq is a great flavor as well.  Sweet base of bbq with just a hint of heat to it.  Anyone will be able to handle this level of heat, but if you're looking for something crazy spicy, this isn't it.\\n\\nThe plain (or buttered, can't tell) is excellent basic popcorn. Crunchy with a bit of salt but not too much.  However its hard to get too excited about it when the other flavors are right there.  I can't really taste the butter in what I tried, so I'm unsure as to what actual flavor it is (as I don't see plain on their website's list of flavors)\\n\\nThis sampling of flavor's definitely makes me want to go there myself and try the other flavors.

Whoever does the hiring here picked people that were highly-motivated, friendly, and professional. Specifically, Eric who keeps the drinks coming, Sunny who always has a great smile, and Jenny who is the life of her shift. Sam is my final shoutout. He's fun, he takes care of customers quickly, and he knows his drinks. We love being here with this staff because they make life fun!\\nThe other great thing about this spot is the crowd. You're looking at a late 20's through 30's crowd where no one's vomiting drunk and there aren't crying pubescent girls like downtown college crowds.\\n*Those are the only pro's....\\n\\nCon's: The food. I wrote professional food reviews for years and I can only imagine what they'd look like for this place. My grilled ham and cheese was burnt to a crisp, the salmon taco tasted like regurgitated seafood, the eggs were raw (clear, raw eggs) in the bennies, and the biscuits from the biscuits and gravy were so hard I wiped one off and banged it on the table (it didn't break). Almost everything else I've had either had hair in it or tasted like it came pre-frozen and over deep-fried. It's been super disappointing to have a place great food options that are cooked so poorly. Soooooo, my suggestion would be, eat brunch somewhere else and come here after for drinks.\\n\\nSecond, WATCH. YOUR. TAB. And if you work here, and you're reading this, SO MANY people are commenting on this issue and I'm nothing short of shocked that it hasn't been fixed yet. \\n\\nMy friends and I have all had the same issue here; drinks are added to our tab all the time that we didn't order. I know I didn't order Deep Eddy because I'm allergic to it (people can be allergic to certain impurities found in very specific brands). And I've never once ordered whiskey because it tastes like warm cat urine smells to me. So those weren't mine. I didn't say anything when it happened the first couple times because I honestly didn't notice. I can drink, well, so it's not unusual for me to have a decent tab. It wasn't until a close friend said he was noticing this issue that I started to pay attention. Once, my friend and I tested this and both opened tabs on arrival, ordered our separate drinks on our separate tabs, and what happened a couple hours later when we close was amazing. His bill was $0 and for some reason, every single drink he ordered was on mine. Simeon double-checked (but had not been the one we'd been ordering from, he's always very nice) and reported that while my friend had a tab open, both of our orders had been put solely on my tab. When confronting a manager, Jessica, we were told, and I quote, \\"Well maybe the bartenders are just comfortable with you guys....\\". What?!?! What does that mean?? It's ok to pad my tab then?? Or just to plain not pay attention when we order? When my friend confronted her about the same issue, she told us she watched the camera of us drinking for several hours on a Sunday (she watched several hours worth of drinks in a little bit over one hour, somehow....) and she accounted for us ordering what was on his tab with the exception of the whiskey. She admitted we didn't order that and it was an erroneous charge. So, management knows it happens, and she made a pathetic attempt at an apology, offered my friend exactly $9, and walked off. She was rude, unprofessional, and seemed to lack not only accountability, but any sense of management skills. \\n\\nMoral: When you drink here, seriously, write down everything you order and dispute the receipt of its incorrect before you leave. \\n\\nSummary: 90% of the food we ordered is either burnt, over-fried, or just gross. Always check your tab for accuracy. And if you do come here, eat somewhere else first then come upstairs where the bartending staff is energetic and the people are friendly. Look for Sam downstairs, or Eric, Jenny, or Sunny upstairs. They'll make sure your day drinks are quick and ice cold!\\n\\n*But still watch your tab (and seriously, there are multiple reviews about this very issue)...."},{"name":"Circa 1926","address":"358 N Park Ave","city":"Winter Park","stars":"3","text":"Why was I ever dragged here?

They are genuinely excited when you like what you're eating, they will engage you if you want to know about your food, yet they give you space if you are more interested in your dinner conversation than whether the ramps were sourced from Massachusetts or New Hampshire.  Once, we were examining a knife because we liked its design, and, a minute later, a server clandestinely replaced the knife, assuming we had seen a spot or something.

Since that time I've been a life long regular. Over the years, I've had nearly everything on the menu. \\n\\nWhen we want hibachi there is no other place in ATL that compete. The food is fresh and prepared with concern and the people watching is is some of the best in the city; from suburban families with kids out for a big night to local strippers with their sugar daddies and everything in between. It's great to relax with a drink, hot food and just take in the atmosphere. My favorite is the tenderloin and shrimp, but sometimes I go for the vegetarian as it's totally delicious, too. \\n\\nAs good as the hibachi is, the traditional side is where Nakato really shines. The service is excellent, they don't up sell and the staff has been consistent for years. The crowd is very different from the hibachi side with Japanese customers and serious foodies loving the truly traditional specials. Everything is fresh and so much better than 95% of the sushi bars in town. \\n\\nFor a special treat throw down for a special meal in the tatami room. You'll have a private room all to yourselves with a personal waiter.

To be honest I prefer Shangri La and especially Taiwan Cafe. Slightly more expensive than either too. When you stand outside it looks like a hole in the wall but when you go in its surprisingly very nice looking inside. The spicy beef noodle soup is barely spicy but tasty. The bao was good but does not have the soupy goodness that joe shanghai or taiwan cafe does. And it bugged us that the bao came out in less than 2 min.  When that happens you know they're cutting corners. The highlight was definitely the beef sandwich. Crisipy flaky bread with some tasty beef. \\n\\nOne thing to note though. WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE EVER! For this reason alone I will never dine in this restaurant again. Maybe pick up a sandwich from them if i happen to be in the hood but that's about it. The waitress never came by. Had to flag down the busboy to get a waitress and believe me the place is not big enough where a waitress should not be able to notice us. Wait staff was grossly unattentive. We asked for hot sauce and they gave it to the table next to us. WTH? The busboy slammed into my chair with the dirty dish cart. And then the greeter smacks into my chair with a couple of chairs he was dragging. \\n\\nKeep in mind that this is a authentic taiwanese restaurant. Being such you have to know that efficiency is more important than customer service. So ordinarily i wouldn't care because you have to just expect it.

We were seated at the patio, which is gorgeous! We ordered the L'Omelette de Saison, Oeuf et Steak, Salmon Benedict and the Cassoulet. Everything looked and tasted amazing. We all loved the dishes.\\n\\nThe part which knocked two stars off this review was the service. We never really figured out who are actual server was. The host seated us and there was a server who took our order but was never seen again. Different staff came to serve us our dishes and another person came to clear our table. The staff seemed eager to clear our table but no one ever came back to check on us, pour us more coffee or take any more orders.\\n\\nAfter our entrees I had to ask the guy who cleared our dishes if he could bring us some menus so we could order the waffles which he happily did. But then we were sitting for a long time waiting for someone to take our orders. The place wasn't busy and the tables around us were being waited on. And even with the number of staff around us, it was hard to make eye contact or get their attention. \\n\\nA different server finally came - did not acknowledge in any way that he's never been at our table (maybe there was a shift change?) or that we've been sitting there for a while while the place wasn't busy at all. Anyways he took our order, the waffles came and they were wonderful. \\n\\nTo have had different people seat us, take our order, bring our food and clear our table quickly BUT NO ONE SEEMED TO CLEARLY BE OUR SERVER, it felt pretty overstaffed yet underwhelming. The service was bad enough for me to feel quite embarrassed to have raved on and on about this place to my family. \\n\\nThe saving grace was the food was great and the ambiance out on the patio was wonderful on such a sunny day, it was hard to get mad.

The greens were good, it had a TON of onions (maybe a little too much) and was skimpy on the tomatoes.  Everyone seemed to really enjoy the corn chowder but I passed because I don't like crab.\\n\\nThe filets were good but not the best steak I've ever had - I definitely think 23 was better.  I ordered their blue cheese crumble topper and while it was good, it was a bit overpowering for the steak, so I mixed it in to the mashed potatoes, which were ok, sort of bland.  I also had the creamed spinach which I agree was nothing to write home about.  One of our other diners also ordered the blue cheese crumble and her steak came without it, so we had to send it back.  I am pretty sure one of the guys ordered the au poive sauce and didn't get it either.  The shoestring fries were really good - had some really good spices on them.\\n\\nThe desert was a bread pudding and it was good but nothing to write home about either, but I guess for them at restaurant week that is all they are willing to fork over.\\n\\nThe staff was very friendly and I had no problems with the online reservations I made with OpenTable.

We had actually called to verify if they had fried Cameos and he indicated that he didn't at the time, but that he was going to get them for us. Once we arrived I decided to order the famous a finger licking good ChiMoo sandwich. My fiancee opted for the quesadillas and let me tell you they are the best quesadillas I've tasted in a long time. The chicken was nicely marinated and juicy, and the addition of the Parmesan cheese crust took it to another level. Now back to the ChiMoo, by far the best sandwich in Orlando. The chicken was juicy and tender and the marinated skirt stake was to die for. The sweet brad or (pan sobao) was the perfect vessel to carry this magical concoction of flavors. Plus the sandwich was topped with homemade sweet potato fries and Cole slaw DELISH is all I can say. \\n\\nChef Louis definitely knows what he's doing in the kitchen, the man is classically trained and has worked in some wonderful restaurants and kitchens around the states. \\n\\nFinally we had our desserts fried Oreos and fried Cameos that Thomas had gotten for us. They are literally pillows of goodness in your mouth. \\n\\nThe place is a must if your in the downtown are or not it's that good and your taste buds will thank you.

I plan on branching out and trying more, I'm just prone to sticking with what I already know I love. It's an issue. Their pizzas are kind of pricey, but to me it is worth it for the quality of food you are getting. Their ingredients taste fresh and their dough is thin with a nice slightly charred crust. It does have a tendency to get soggy if you let it sit too long though. I wish I could have a bowl of their tomato sauce just to dip bread in or eat plain...it's so very tasty.

When moving over, we asked if we should bring our appetizer with us and they said they will handle it.  When transitioning over, they forgot our tray of cheese and olives.  We asked about it twice and finally the waiter brought over a new plate.   At the end, our bill was over $100 for 3 items and 2 drinks.  After leaving the restaurant, we realized they charged us twice for our appetizer.  I would have been okay if the waiter had at least notified us that he was charging us a second order because they tossed out our half eaten appetizers.  Service was below average.

Before arriving, I thought I would enjoy the brisket the most as it looked the juiciest and fattiest in photos.  However, after eating everythingI felt the best tasting item was the pork spare ribs. I'm usually not a fan of ribs because it's really hot or miss. I've had juicy ribs and burnt cardboard like ribs . The spareribs here, I felt absorbed the most of the oak charcoals. The brisket although it had a nice crust had uneven cooking, some of it was juicy and smoky and other parts were dry and flavorless. The sausage was also good but I don't think sausage can ever go wrong.\\n\\nI would give this place a 4 but it loses a star because it's CASH only, although there is an ATM on the premises, I really don't appreciate the need to be charged an ATM fee.

We arrived too late for the dinner menu but were pleasantly surprised with the bar menu which has plenty of interesting and delightful options. The ambience, d√©cor, is outstanding and I love how the kitchen is part of the dining room; the state of the art cooking station was made in France. This was my third visit and I was surprised to see the place half empty; I've never been able to get a seat at the bar.  The staff has always been very knowledgeable about the food and drink menus and tonight was no different.  We were sat as soon as the staff cleaned and set our table; within minutes our server greeted us and asked if we would like bottled or tap water.  I checked out the extensive wine list, most bottles are in the $45-$100 range with a few in the thirties.  This was my second time ordering 2005 Faug√®res 'Vieilles Vignes Ch√¢teau d la Liqui√®re from the Languedoc region at $34.00 and we've been extremely pleased with the quality and consistency.  It's a darker, heavier blend of grenache, carignan, syrah, cinsault and others; there are some bold tannins, probably oak-derived, with a smooth vanilla finish. \\n I was happy to hear our waiter offer the roasted bone marrow to the table behind us (it's not on the bar menu), I've been eager to try this resurrected dish for a while.  The sour dough bread (which happens to be my favorite) had a beautiful hard crust; soft on the inside with large air pockets and the perfect balance of sourness.  We started out with the Dodge Cove Oysters on the Half Shell with candied lemon mignonette; fresh, plump, and succulent; the lemon mignonette complimented the oyster's butter texture.  Next up were Maine Mussels with toasted garlic, chile caribe, miso, and herbs; my first reaction was holy $%&* these are the largest, meatiest, mussels, I have ever seen.  They were served with plenty of toasted sour dough for dipping in the jus.\\n  It would be impossible for me to visit Craigie's without sampling the Terrines, Assiette of House-Made Charcuterie: Duck Rillettes, Pate de Campagne, Foie Gras au Torchon; with a home made mustard, some type of blackberry sauce, and again plenty of toasted sour dough.  The texture was fine, smooth, not a country style; well seasoned and perfectly executed.  As we were enjoying these our server brought over the Crispy-Fried Pigs' Tails with pickled peanuts, nuoc cham, cilantro; a little too greasy for my wife but well worth the effort if you don't mind using your hands and getting a little dirty.  She thought the cartilage was fat; it does look similar.  Crispy Fried Nova Scotia Smelts pickled peppers, preserved lemon, dried black olives, squid ink anchoiade; these were large and de-boned which made it easier for us.  I do prefer the smaller ones with the bones intact, you can eat the bones and heads; these are one of my father's favorite foods.  Perfectly seasoned but could have been a bit crispier and slightly less greasy in my opinion.  \\n  I guess our main course would be the Local Grass-Fed Beef Burger and a pricy $18.00.  The burger was pretty huge at least 8-10 oz with Shelburne Farm cheddar, house made red wine pickle, celery root slaw and mace ketchup, house made sesame seed bun and crispy shoestring potatoes.  It was ordered medium rare, but it came out slightly undercooked and rare (which was acceptable), we enjoyed the burger; it is easily big enough for two.  The texture was smooth and moist, but I'm not sure if it beats Fuddruckers, I might have to do a side by side taste test.  The shoestring fries reminded me of some chips that I would eat out of the can as a child, I'm still not sure if I prefer them with the shoestring cut.  The service throughout all of the courses was timely, not overbearing or annoying, the server topped off my wine and water when it was low and answered all of our questions; he gave his opinions on beverages and dishes when asked by my wife.  \\n  Last but not least was the Peanut Butter Parfait house-made hobnob cookie, cocoa nibs, banana foam.  I guess the banana foam could be considered molecular gastronomy; but to us it just tasted great and made sense.  Store.gourmetsleuth.com describes cocoa nibs as \\"simply roasted cocoa beans separated from their husks and broken in to small bits. The nibs are a new chef favorite and can be used in place of nuts atop ice cream or in cookies and even as a snack\\"\\n  Was everything 100% perfect?  No, but it's about as close as one can get; definitely a solid \\"A\\".  My wife didn't finish her Hot Buttered Rum Cider with Fragrant and Lush\\nAppleton Estate, canella, orange, and clove; she found it too buttery.  She didn't complain about it, but our attentive waiter noticed and told us he had them comp the cocktail.  I thought that was a nice touch to a perfect evening."},{"name":"The Lower Depths","address":"476 Commonwealth Ave","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"Absolutely inexplicable menu revamp took away the charm and appeal of one of our favorite spots to grab a beer, dog and an order of inventive tots. Now they serve mediocre tacos just like any one of the many similar joints popping up around our fair city. They are literally deleting any voices of dissent from their Facebook page with no real response to the public outcry from their (once) loyal fan base. The tacos are fine, nothing to write home about, and certainly lacking compared to similarly priced joints like Lone Star or Burro Bar--or even La Catrina. The size of the $5 'sides' is laughable.

So this could be the GREATEST BENNIE I HAVE EVER HAD, but when you lose your appetite after being STARVING. Well, food tastes like shit. Honestly, this is literally THE WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE I have EVER RECEIVED. When the food finally came out, it was ALL COLD, probably because we were given our food after 4 TABLES that had been seated after us did. Didn't refill our waters. And then when they had made a mistake on one of the orders (what a surprise) the douchebag who is lucky that I didn't wanna get arrested and throw him through a window, decided to tell my friend to FUCK OFF AND NEVER COME BACK because she politely asked if they had actually started cooking it or not. So unfortunately there is this thing called \\"law enforcement\\" and that piece of shit's life was spared. So unless you want to get a cup of water every hour, glared at from a bunch of losers who hate their lives (because their life sucks cause they wait tables for a big titty bimbo), and told to FUCK OFF by people who (once again) hate their lives, then I would avoid this place at ALL COSTS.

Never before had I ordered oatmeal at a restaurant: it's a meal I usually reserve for camping trips or outings of that ilk (since, you know, I do those kind of things all the time). I don't know why I ordered the oatmeal, but I was very pleased. I will definitely be adding dried cranberries the next time I have oatmeal... say, in about 3 years or so. \\n\\nService was pleasant and the entirety of brunch was simple and easy.

I wanted to expand my culinary intake and step outside my usual go to spots in Portland.  Never ate at a Cuban joint before and the only semblance of the cuisine I've ever had were \\"Paseo's\\" interpretations of the sandwiches.  Sitting down, I told myself I am going abstain from ordering a Cuban sandwich and try something more homely and authentic, their menu is quite extensive.  I had to cross reference the items on the menu with the pictures posted on Yelp to narrow down my choice.  I finally settled on a beef empanada and Ropa Vieja, both were solid choices, the empanada had a good crust and was generously filled.  The Ropa Vieja looked spectacular, but was lukewarm at best which kinda took away from the meal.  The meat was very tender, it wasn't all that flavorful though, there was steam water, or condensation dripping on the plate, which taste like nothing.  The red beans and rice, veggies, peas, and crusty bread rounded out the meal.  Overall, I enjoyed dinning here, the atmosphere was lively, the service was solid, and the food was good."},{"name":"Antica Posta Ristorante Toscano","address":"519 E Paces Ferry Rd NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3.5","text":"Came here for a work group dinner while in management training.  This was one of the best restaurants I have ever eaten at.  From the moment our group of 10 walked in, we were seated right away in the upstairs part of restaurant where there were no other customers.  It was nice and private.  Walking up the steps made it feel very intimate like we were walking up someone's upstairs house.  The stairs were carpeted in red.\\n\\nOnce we sat down we had about two servers tending to our needs at all times.  Both were dressed very well in formal black and white with towels draped over their arms.  I immediately noticed the 7 bottles of wine placed at a table not too far from us--- are those for us?  And sure enough they were!  Now, if this was a Yelp event I may have drank two of those bottles all by myself but this was a work dinner so I had to share, begrudgingly, so as to appear as professional as possible.  Darn work dinners!\\n\\nThe food... I must talk about the food. We had several appetizers.  We had meatballs covered in marinara sauce, delicious bruschetta, as well as spinach ravioli, caprese salad and warm bread.  We ate those up almost as fast as we drank the wine.  After the shared appetizers, we got to order our own three course meal.  I chose the cantaloupe and sliced prosciutto as my (now 2nd) appetizer, my entree was free range chicken with roasted potatoes and dessert was a simple fruit salad with pinapple and strawberry slices (I really wanted the chocolate mousse, but I'm on a diet, grrrr).  \\n\\nI was concerned about the cantaloupe and prosciutto but it turned out the be quite tasty.  The saltiness of the ham complimented the sweetness of the cantaloupe.  I think everyone should try it.  And the free range chicken was amazing but buyer beware they give you almost the whole darn chicken.  I ate dinner at 9 and I was still full when I woke up the next morning!  They don't skimp on the food here.\\n\\nIn the end, my experience was great.

I pulled up to a small, unassuming building on Burnet. I live nearby and I had driven by countless times without even noticing Simplicity's existence. That's the kind of unassuming we're talking about.\\n\\nAt about 4pm, I strolled in and grabbed a table. The place was empty. I was skeptical about the whole thing. I don't even drink wine because it gives me headaches. Why did I agree to meet at a wine bar again?? My friends arrived and ordered their wine. I ordered a pitcher of Blue Moon. When I finished off the pitcher by myself (hey, don't judge!) I was starting to feel that familiar feeling of alcohol-induced rampant hunger. My friends and I started ordering their Tapas-style appetizers like crazy. We had 2 escargot plates, a pappas aioli plates, a baked brie with peach chutney, and a bowl on spinach artichoke dip. The first 3 things we ordered were delicious. I was a little underwhelmed by the spinach dip (it desperately needed salt) but overall, it was delicious. I finished off the night with a bottled Abita Turbo Dog and a full, happy stomach.\\n\\nThen came the bill came. I was dreading it. Oh boy, here comes a $30 tab that I shouldn't have really wasted money on with my college-student budget.\\n\\nBut then... SOMETHING MAGICAL HAPPENED.\\n\\nMy total bill came out to $12. Yes, $12. The pitcher of blue moon (yielded about 4 full pints) costed me $5. The Turbo Dog was $2. And the other $5 was my share of half-priced happy hour appetizers. \\n\\nSince then, I have back for many, many Happy hours.\\n\\nThe ONLY reason this place is not receiving 5 stars is that recently they re-did their menu and I was a little disappointed to see that Escargot and one other item I loved had been booted from the happy hour special list, dwindling down the number of half-priced items to a measly 4."},{"name":"Trident Booksellers & Caf√©","address":"338 Newbury St","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"Dirty cup of un-iced water.

It was quite good - the pork was seasoned very nicely, the beans were delicious, even the white rice was well done! The others in my party had the chicken and rice, the red snapper in coconut sauce, and the oxtail. Everyone really loved their food. As far as drinks go, I just tried a sugar cane limeade. It was ok, but I don't think I'd get it again. I'd probably go for the fresh orange/pineapple juice or check out the cocktails. \\n\\nOverall, our service was great, the portions just right, the prices not bad, and the experience quite fun!

Orlando has several major foodie pockets, Winter Park, Mills 50, Thornton Park to name a few. What about Hunter's Creek? People live and play there too. The Loop on Osceola Parkway rivals Waterford Lakes on the east side of town. Around Town Center Blvd is as bustling as Park Ave without the flashy cars and high end snobbery. This is where I discovered a little gem, Bistro Europa Express.\\n\\nThis inviting place sits on a corner storefront. There are quaint tables and chairs that line the sidewalk outdoor. Indoor seating is a combination of regular height and high top tables and chairs. Walking in greets you to the delicious glass counter. Forget looking at the menu, this is where the eye candy starts. Amazing colors and smells swarm and envelops to tantalize the senses. Looking up to the menu board leaves you conflicted. What not to order? Everything seems amazing. But the glass showcase is to capture the eyes. Almost everything else is made to order. The Greek and Mediterranean inspired dishes, small wine selections, beer, fountain drinks, coffee drinks offer something for everyone even kids. We settled on something light and less adventurous.\\n\\nLatte I am not a coffee buff by any means, but I can smell a good coffee. Nice frothy head swirled with smooth strong notes. My companion enjoyed it.\\n\\nTurkey and Brie Panini with Lemon Chicken Soup was a hearty meal and great presentation. The soup was packed with flavors. Turkey was tender and delicious. A nice healthy portion.\\n\\nGyro with Macaroni and Cheese was a filling portion. This generous lamb portion was lightly salted and succulently tender. The mac and cheese was creamy.\\n\\nBaklava with Walnuts came fresh out of the oven. Yes, I saw it coming out. How many restaurants do you know make their own Baklava? Many import from some famous store in Michigan. Not this place. It is made in house with walnuts and pistachio. Do you think fresh made would taste different? Go taste this tender, flaky, delicate, not too sweet, crunchy bite full and then let me know about your favorite hole that buys from somewhere else. I dare you. As for me, I found my little slice of paradise.\\n\\nNot too often do you find a warm welcome feeling from counter ordering establishments. It seems like this place embraces you from the warm welcome and every step of service. I am always moved when people make eye contact and nod, even to just acknowledge that you exist in the same space as they do. I am more excited when restaurants offer free portions on the house just for asking about an item. That shows an enormous amount of confidence in their product and genuine hospitality. Is it because this restaurant is nestled in the very neighborly residential Hunter's Creek that it seems very warm? I think this is it's culture. I am definitely going back to order more adventurously. This time I might just order from pointing at what captivates my eyes. That could put me in a whole heap of foodie goodness."},{"name":"The Lower Depths","address":"476 Commonwealth Ave","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"Sick place.  Great beers and tacos.

I tested the classics (California, Negihama), some of the more complex (Rainbow, Spicy Tuna, Spider, Seafood), the innovative (can't remember the name, but it was certainly out there), and some classic sashimi.  All were delicious, but my personal preference was the Seafood roll.  It's pretty hard to beat what Nakato has to offer in terms of quality and variety.\\n\\nHowever, the painful drawback to this place was that the service was extremely slow.  Sure, it was during peak hours, and we sat at the sushi bar to avoid an hour wait for a table, but it still took our waitress comically long to serve us.  Our first few rolls came out pretty fast, but it was agonizing waiting for the final four.  All in all, we spent a good chunk of our evening just waiting for food.

We were sat at a high-top table. There was a seat on a long couch for one guest and a stool for the other guest. The stool was a little uncomfortable and seemed to be in the path of waiters and guests, so the two of smushed together on one side of the sofa. It wasn't super comfortable, but it wasn't a huge deal. I think it would have been more comfortable to sit at the bar, actually.\\n\\nThe second thing I noticed was the smell. It smelled pretty smokey. I don't know if it was the kitchen or the oil lamps near the bathroom. The ventilation must be pretty poor, because it was really off-putting. It didn't seep into our clothing or anything, but it was enough to make me not want to stay very long. God forbid it was intentional...\\n\\nThe selection of drinks was good. They all sounded delicious, so it was hard to pick just one. I was planning on having a few, since they all sounded great. I ordered a painkiller ($15) , and my date ordered a saturn ($13). My painkiller was okay. I've made a better one myself, to be honest. I think that a $15 drink should have some kind of special or memorable twist or execution. I realize that a painkiller is a pretty prescriptive drink, but it kind of fell flat. I can't even really give it points on anything else, because I only got a few sips out of it (it was mostly ice), and I could neither taste nor feel the alcohol. I tend to get at least tipsy after one drink, but I didn't feel a thing after finishing my drink. My date's saturn was okay, as well. And it was also pretty small.\\n\\nThere was a mix-up with my drink, but it was quickly corrected, which I appreciate. It is very loud there, so I'm not really surprised, since it can be hard to communicate over the noise.\\n\\nWe ordered some crab rangoon ($13). There were five pieces per order. These were okay. The wonton skin was really thin and limp. The chopsticks would pierce the skin when picking one up, and when eating the rangoon, the filling would flow out. I'm used to crab rangoon having a really hard, crunchy shell, which makes it a lot easier and more enjoyable to eat. The dipping sauce (apricot duck sauce) was not really memorable. I was hoping it would be nice and fruity, but it tasted dusty, kind of the way maraschino liqueur tastes. \\n\\nI agree that the decor is nice, but I don't feel that it made up for the drinks or the food.\\n\\nAfter finishing our drinks, both of us agreed that we didn't really want to spend any more time or money there. We were pretty disappointed, as we are both big fans of tiki style drinks and were excited about a tiki bar popping up in Boston, which definitely has a dearth of them.

The hostess seemed flustered, and was not very personable at all. She said hi, then it took her at least 10 minutes to say anything else - finally, one of the waitstaff said we could sit at the bar.\\n\\nOur drinks were really good. We decided we wanted to share the pig head, but eating that at the bar felt a little awkward, so we asked for a table instead. It took a while to get bread, and when it did arrive, it was stone cold. I understand that they don't bake their own bread (they get it daily from Iggy's) so they don't want to \\"cheat\\" by warming it, which \\"freshens\\" the bread - but this was like... \\"straight out of the walk-in cold\\", not \\"this was delivered 4 hours ago room temperature.\\" Not exactly delicious, and the butter was also rock hard. It would have been much more enjoyable if either the bread or the butter had been allowed to temper slightly before arriving at the table; trying to spread cold butter on cold bread kinda sucks. Anyway.\\n\\nWe split the octopus appetizer and the pig head for our entrees. The octopus was awesome. Perfectly tender, good balance of spices and acidity, nice textures. Super tiny portion for $18, though. \\n\\nThe pig head is a novel presentation. It's confit and roasted, so of course it's 80% fat - skin was super crispy, meat was nice and tender, but... it didn't have a lot of flavor. It came with a little bowl of sea salt, which helped, but... I think it would have been better served with a sauce that was slightly more acidic to balance (and help digest!) the massive amount of fat in the dish. Also, for such a large portion of meat that's meant to be shared, the accompaniments were rather scant. You get 6 little crepe pancakes and a small bowl of bean sprouts and some other stuff (kind of like an asian-inspired salsa/slaw, can't remember what was in it) and a small dish of hoisin sauce; you're supposed to make \\"pig head tacos\\" out of it, but there was a ton of meat left over after we finished the accompaniments, so we were left munching on just the meat. and skin. For $60, I guess I expected a little more.\\n\\nOur entree took a while to come out, so the kitchen sent out an \\"oops, we're sorry\\" bowl of their duck fat brussel sprouts, which were delicious.  At the end of the meal, we didn't order dessert so they sent us a little shot glass filled with foam, which was an odd choice but the gesture was appreciated.\\n\\nSummary: Decent, but overpriced and over-hyped.

Usually the sausage at these joints is lame Eckrich junk.  Sausage is commonly a result of economical butchery but every once in awhile that \\"peasant food\\" sneaks passed the prime cuts. The Texas Bohemian influence makes it mark at Saltlick  where the lean and peppery sausage should not be overlooked. \\n\\nThe potato salad is German-Style too. Even if you have tried the overly sweet store bought version and have a poor opinion of German-style potato salad give this another try.

It worked well together and came off as something very special that seemed the matching puzzle piece for Shiner Bock Beer to wash down.\\n\\nFor me there is something magic about the land out here so the drive was a gorgeous get away.

We moved into a nearby condo, then to a house and now to a home in Lexington on the Arlington line.  We raised 3 kids who are grown up and on their own. Through this whole time Nicola's has been a constant.  Having a party?  Order a Nicola calzone platter.

I probably consume more sustenance from this place than any other spot in Austin.  While waiting for them to open today I read their Yelp page, and decided I had to try their (homemade) corn tortillas.  To my delight, as I stood in line, one of the lovely and talented cooks was rolling up little balls of dough and squashing them into tortillas using what looked like a medieval press with a long wooden handle, to be cooked up seconds later on the grill.  The experience was transcendent.  The flour ones are delicious too, but this was something else.  Moist and not-grainy in the least.  Wow!  \\n\\nMarcelino's sources their ingredients, as much as possible, from \\"The 02\\".  Some jerk left a review that claimed that their flour tortillas were \\"store bought\\", when they're actually sourced from Milagra, the effervescent tortilla factory just across the railroad tracks from Yellow Jacket Social Club.   \\n\\nAn under-appreciated aspect of this place is that they're happy to mix-and-match ingredients.  It's like an alchemical workshop for tacos!  \\n\\nThe bacon / egg / cheese is the best I've ever had, from anywhere!  It mates super well with the homemade creamy green salsa.  Fluffy eggs, generous crispy bacon crumbles.

Offering us seating inside or outside. We opted to stay in the A/C. They weren't busy but pretty steady midday on a Saturday. The decor is very hip and fun, between the high top tables and the wall art (chalkboard drawings that seem to cross advanced math/science with pig) and the Far Side strips that cover the bathroom walls. \\n\\nOur waitress offered some great suggestion based on both her own experience and the feedback she's received from other customers. We took her advice and ordered the Coppa and the Hot Soppressata for meats, and the Tomme and something that was like a cheddar (I can't remember what it was called) for our cheeses, marinated olives and an onion jam to round it out. It was delivered on a cutting board with some bread, mustard, and pickles. The whole thing was great. \\n\\nThey've got a good selection of craft beers, and some delicious sounding cocktails. My friend ordered the Dartmouth St Cooler, which after tasting hers I wish I had ordered the same. Mixed well and very refreshing for a summer cocktail. They were out of Pretty Things which was what I initially ordered, but the waitress was quick with suggestions, so I had a Notch Session Pils (not a pils fan usually but I liked this one.

Our new waitress, Sarah, was MUCH better but we had to deal with the other waitress for most of our meal.\\n\\nThe chips and salsa were delish. They serve their chips warm - yum, and the salsa was perfect. The food came out fast and the portions were large. My meal was ok/good, but small things like serving the food hot would have made it better. Mine was served warm but I expect piping hot when I'm in a restaurant. It actually tasted a lot better once I went home and reheated it. I wish the food was spicier. I like those flavors in Mexican cuisine but Pure seems to have backed off of adding too much spice  They have a great bar and drink menu. My hubby ordered a nice Mexican beer on the menu for only $1.99. It is a taqueria of course, so the Mexican beer & authentic style of the cuisine was nice.\\n\\nIf Pure would pay closer attention to detail, they'd be a lot better. For instance, there were two of us dining, but our menus had different prices for the same items. And the food just needs a little more flavor/spice.

Then, when I moved to Texas, I thought it was something you tortured people with when you fed large parties -- all the things I do not like: white bread, pork, beef. Ick. \\n\\nAs I grew to eat more barbecue over the years and studied a little but more about its creation and the care that can go into this sort of cooking, I became more enamored with it, especially after trying different sauces from all over. And let's face it; it's all about the sauce. And while The Salt Lick is a great place to bring out-of-town guest, it's just not a favorite. \\n\\nThe meat plate (11.95 and pictured above) come with only one rib strip,, two pieces of brisket, and a handful of sausage. The friends I was with thought there should have been one of rib or one more strip of brisket. They found the sausage over ground, which gave it a smoother texture than they preferred. I had the turkey plate, which was good, but again, the sauce just leaves me wanting something smokier and spicier. I think Salt Lick uses a firm vinegar base which makes their sauce come out the color of mustard. I like something a little darker, richer, and not a sweet. I put lots of habanero sauce on my turkey to get more spice, but before I knew it, all I had was wet meat. \\n\\nI've been to the Salt Lick many times before, and I end up with pretty much the same experience.

The ribs were satisfactory. It's hard to mess up sausage so that was good. I LOVED the turkey, which was white meat but moist. The three sides they offer are potato salad, cole slaw and beans, all of which are nothing to call  home about. The cole slaw had sesame seeds so I guess that was unique.\\n\\nThe variety and sides at Rudy's are much better.

It was amazing. The ceviche was delightful and fresh, and the tostones came out perfectly hot and crispy. They also serve their amazing garlic sauce, and added to my meal, it sent everything over the top. \\n\\nMy friend ordered the bandeja paisa, which was a LOT more food than we anticipated. We expected more of a sampler platter with a little bit of everything. Nope. It was probably enough for at least two people. Although I don't eat pork, I did try a bit of the pork skin, and it was very tasty.

Not dark as in, \\"oh, this is kind of romantic or fun\\" but just...dark.

They have a lot of homestyle favorites like meatloaf or biscuits or chicken pot pie.

So you can imagine my surprise when I found out what a foodie hot spot this is in Boston, after being invited to tag along to dinner with some friends.\\n\\nThe food itself was exotic, and in some cases a little strange. The entrees themselves were pretty small....think small beautifully presented food at big prices. Although you can dress up here, the atmosphere seemed casual to me. You'll have to make reservations if you want to guarantee yourself a seat, or be one of the first in line to get a spot at the bar right when they open. On the night we went, the bar line was down the block already at 5:30 pm.\\n\\nWhile some might think of the food as pretentious, the service, for the most part, was not. I think the hostess came off as a bit unwelcoming,  but the waiters were great. I liked how willing they were to explain what different ingredients and items were on the menu, and didn't make you feel silly for not knowing in the first place. The food I could eat was yummy. I tried the chicken for two, which was super tender and juicy. They even showed us the whole chicken before cutting it for us. I just wish it came with some sort of side. Their iconic dish, the pig's head, was scary to look at. Our friends seemed to enjoy it though, and it came with little pancakes to serve the meat in. There is something just really strange about ripping flesh off a head on your table. I was adventurous to try the pig tails, which were tasty and reminded me a lot of fried chicken wings.

My first outing, I ordered a soy latte with extra foam and received a very odd looking beverage with white clumps and huge bubbles. Yes, I do know my foam from being a barista slash coffee snob for years, but this was not even remotely close to resembling foam. It looked more like the bubbles you blow with children at the playground. And whenever there are unidentifiable white clumps in my beverage, or anything unidentifiable for that matter, I refuse to consume it. Basic common sense, I believe. Now, I always feel awkward being \\"that\\" complain-y customer and asking for a new one, but come on, even the most timid and passive person would not accept this. So, in the kindest vocabulary and tone I could muster, I requested a new latte. The girl who made it looked at it and did a skeptical eyebrow raise indicating I should be on some sort of mental-chemistry-balancing drug for being insane enough to suggest there was something wrong with my latte. Okay, an elderly, color blind person with thick cataracts in both eyes could see that this latte was far from fine. Anyhow, the second one she made was less like a bubble-bath, more like shampoo foam and did not have mysterious clumps, so I drank it, whatever. I would not be surprised if her irate spit was floating around in it.\\n\\nWow, I cannot believe I am still writing about the first of three visits. Okay, so we went on a dead morning, it must have been mid-week and later in the day. Point being we were some of the only dining patrons and still waited eons longer than is acceptable. I seriously felt like crow's feet were developing in the corners of my eyes as we waited for the waitress. I think my \\"favorite\\" part of the whole experience was when we glanced at the bill and she tried to charge us for two soy lattes. \\n\\nSo perhaps we are complete masochists for returning for a second round of potential dining torture, but it actually worked out much better. I ordered some super hippie tofu scramble with soy cheese which was amazing, a soy latte that was still sub-par but drinkable, and two sides of fruit. After this somewhat enjoyable meal, it makes sense that we returned for yet a third time. I officially attest that the phrase \\"third time's a charm\\" is complete BS, because the third time eating at the Walnut Cafe was absolutely the opposite of a \\"charm.\\" Okay, we sort of knew what we were getting into: showing up at a hip n' happenin' spot on Mother's Day around brunch. However, figuring that the inclement weather would be a deterrent for some, we decided to test fate a bit. Upon arrival the waitress informed us that the wait was around 25 minutes. Fine, that was doable, we agreed. \\n\\nAs time ticked on, the intensity of that lie began to manifest itself. Twenty minutes past, and a pair of people who certainly arrived after us were seated at the counter. Seriously?? The one redeeming aspect of the morning was the soy latte I ordered to sip while waiting. FINALLY, they got it! Ding, ding! Perfect foam! After about 30 minutes, another waitress came up to us and led us to a \\"secret waiting spot\\" which was just in another part of the diner by the magazine rack and less in her way. Wow. I think we ended up waiting a total of 45 minutes. In what world is 45 minutes close to 25? Perhaps she has a strange accent making her fours sound like twos, or perhaps she just makes up whatever number first pops into her head when people ask for a wait time. Either way, I was cranky and the coffee was worse than gas station coffee and my huevos rancheros gave me GI problems for the rest of the day. Sorry if that is TMI, but I feel like it is in everyone's best interest to know."},{"name":"Craigie On Main","address":"853 Main St","city":"Cambridge","stars":"4","text":"So I finally made it to Craigie.  After all the hype and amazing reviews, I can't say that I was blown away like I expected to be.  The boyfriend and I chose the 10 course tasting.  I will say the service is a solid five stars.  Sam was incredible, checking in at just the right times and just frequently enough to make us feel like we were his only table, but not too frequently to bug us.  His pacing of our meal was also great and he made great wine pairings with the meal.  The chef did stop by the table to serve up the last meat course, which was quite nice.\\n\\nAs for the meal, I would imagine that the 6 course tasting would be a better value and more impressive than the 10 course that we had.  After hearing so much about Chef Tony's love for the pig (we absolutely love Kevin Gillespie's Woodfire Grill in Atlanta for this reason), we were disappointed that only one of the courses featured pork.  The first four or five (I can't remember now) courses featured seafood, which I didn't mind, but I don't feel it showed off the chef's strengths.  Although I will say the squid noodles were the best showing of the night.  As part of the first course, I just couldn't get it out of my head and perhaps that spoiled my view of the rest of the courses.  \\n\\nDon't get me wrong, all of the food was cooked and seasoned wonderfully, but I would have liked to see what everyone else is raving about.  Sam told us that we could suggest some items off the menu that we might like to see, but after asking for the raw oysters (they can't add that) and the pig's tail (chef said he was already featuring pork), we just went with what the chef chose to serve up.  The couple next to us got the bone marrow and loved it, so perhaps that's the next thing to try.\\n\\nThe desserts were great.  We had a sour milk pudding that was absolutely delicious, and a frozen yogurt with beet that was quite good also.  Although assured by Sam that the portions were not that big, it was quite tough to make it through all 10 courses.  Perhaps the portions could be sized down just a bit more for the 10 course option.\\n\\nAll in all, it was a fine meal, but nothing that blew us away.  The amuse bouche that is typically offered with a tasting meal was absent, which was somewhat disappointing.  The ambiance of the restaurant was really nice, intimate but not too much so.  The open kitchen was also really great to see.  If we return, we will either order off the menu to pick exactly what we have heard is the best of show or perhaps try the 6 course Chef's Whim.

Lola cooks each person's meal by herself in the back, so I really felt I was getting an authentic cajun home-cooked meal. I also tried the chicken gumbo. As a gumbo lover, I was a little bit disappointed in it because it was pretty salty. The first two bites were amazing, but after that, the salt just took over the other tastes of the gumbo. Also tried the special cajun tea, and it was very interesting. \\n\\nThe restaurant itself is very small, so I wouldn't come with a huge group unless it's at an odd hour.

I've been here a handful of times, and each time I have mixed feelings about Antico. I have really, really tried to love this place! Please believe me! I wanted nothing more to consider myself of the in-crowd, foodie group that saw Antico as a savior to Americanized pizza. I wanted to believe that Antico was a place of authenticity to the true Italian art form of pizza making, and to a certain degree I was able to come to term with these views, however, the glaring negatives seem to hold me at bay from truly becoming a fan.\\n\\nThe age old Pros and Cons list will have to suffice...\\n\\nPros...\\n- Simple, high quality ingredients\\n- Authentic, traditional pizza (the Italian way)\\n- Amazing experience (for those who don't know you sit right inside the kitchen on giant family sized tables, where it's a BYOB friendly environment)\\n\\nCons...\\n- Attitude \\n- Price\\n\\nThere are other cons that I failed to mention such as the lack of parking and almost sardine like nature of the always busy restaurant, but personally I don't mind these qualities and if the food is worthwhile I am willing to go through a lot. This being said, I enjoy my Americanized Pizza. The traditional style of pizza is definitely something I believe everyone should experience, but I'm not that big of a fan. \\n\\nI will highlight the two negatives I listed, as the positives I mentioned are mimicked in almost every other Yelp review. The staff attitude here is just off. You would think a restaurant that prides itself on sticking to traditional ways of cooking and elevates pizza making to an art-form would be proud and willing to welcome individuals to experience the truly tasty creations they have to offer - this is not the case. The menu printed in Italian is one of the main 'authentic' features of Antico, but when asked for clarification of any of the menu offerings the staff seems almost upset and frustrated. I can understand how it may become annoying to be continually asked by patrons for specifics, but then again not everyone can read Italian. The mood from the owner, chefs, and other staff is almost the same. I could never shake the feeling that they were always upset, or looking down at you when I visited Antico (every time! i can understand once, but come on every time!) \\n\\nSecond, in my con list is price. There prices are fairly steep, and I understand paying for quality and authenticity but there is a fine line between high-end and price gouging because you know your an 'in' restaurant that can charge what it wants and get away with it. \\n\\n\\nSummary:\\nThe snobbish attitude, coupled with the exorbitant price was too much for me swallow. I've been here a few times, and will probably frequent it again (begrudgingly) due to a few of my friends who are part of the die-hard fan base, but I really wish Antico would change.

She didnt know, which is not a huge deal, but since there are only six or so specialty cocktails, you would think you would know if it was vodka based, etc. Another friend asked about the happy hour, because there was a sidewalk sign saying \\" Happy Hour 4-6\\". The server said she didnt think there was a happy hour because it was Saturday. When asked about the sign, she said \\" Oh, then maybe there is?\\" Never did get an answer. \\n\\nSo onto the food. The server mentioned that everything was farm fresh and organic. So I asked if the french fries were hand cut, she said absolutely. Everyone has their \\" things\\" and to me this is one of them, I love hand cut fries but will opt for something else if they are frozen. Sure enough when my friend ordered his poutine, the fries were frozen. I'm glad I saw this prior to ordering our entree because I would not pay $4 for frozen, lackluster, GFS french fries. ( It should be noted that everything is a la carte. It should also be noted the server did not know what that meant when we asked her if that was the case.) So I ordered a chicken thigh and macaroni and cheese. Both were solidly good. The mac and cheese was spicy, and the chicken was fried nicely. I also ordered coleslaw, which was inedible. It was literally strings of cabbage, soaked in vinegar. \\n\\nIn short, I will never go back to this place.

When you go into Ruths Chris in Old City Hall you expect certain things: big steaks cooked right, a good wine selection, tasty accompaniments, great bread, indulgent desserts, attentive waiters and a huge bill at the end of it all.\\nWell, I was fortunate enough to have a company dinner here to celebrate the end of a particularly messy engagement. Our party was ten people, and we were seated quickly and without any fussing with moving tables or preparing silverware, always good to see that the restaurant is on top of things, nothing worse than an hour wait because they \\"lost\\" your reservation (I'm looking at you Mortons).\\nThe dining area was downstairs, in an almost country club setting, lots of dark woods, good leather seating, clean bathrooms, so far so good.\\nWaiters were prompt, but I get the feeling that they should reconsider having each waiter sprout of 10 specials, maybe splurge for a printed specials page? Maybe not as tasteful, but we all had to have the specials repeated a number of times, because there were so damn many! (not that this is a bad thing).\\nThe table had possibly every appetizer available as there were 10 of us and it was on the company. Stuffed mushroom caps were especially memorable, as was the tuna sashimi. \\nPartner selected the wine (of course) and made a good pick (I'm not even going to guess at the price, suffice to say its far more than I could afford considering there were two other partners at the table..). \\nI ordered a Delmonico medium rare, and got to sample most of the accompaniments as well (the potato dishes, esp the au gratin were fantastic).\\nThe steak was quite good, however I felt it was a touch undercooked. I did not want to fuss considering I wasn't paying, but generally when you order a Delmonico from an upscale steakhouse (S&W, Mortons) and get it medium rare the marbling will be hot, tender and fall apart. Here it was tough, and I found myself leaving it on the plate, so I had to basically perform surgery on the steak to single out the edible parts. No great loss, next time the filet.\\nFor desert I had the berries with crme, tasty and my only concession to my desire for good health (it was hard to resist the chocolate offerings, but I succeeded!).\\n\\nI will give Ruths Chris 4 stars, it was a wonderful experience, but I cannot help but think had I not gone in such a group (both large and affluent with me not paying ;-) I would have had a worse time, esp considering I would have made a fuss about my undercooked steak, and of course the prices would make me cry after seeing the check."},{"name":"The Old Mohawk","address":"821 Mohawk St","city":"Columbus","stars":"4","text":"This place is awesome!

I thought the flatbread had just the right amount of crisp, which went perfectly with the softer tomato and mozzarella cheese toppings. It also wasn't too thin, so don't worry about it crumbling under the weight of its toppings while you're eating it. The whole thing was very well-balanced. They cut it into two halves, and each piece has 4 tomato/mozzarella pairings. The tomato slices are cooked and blend very well with the slightly melted cheese. There is a layer of marinera sauce coating the whole pizza (minus the crust area) and a balsamic sauce is drizzled over the top. I really enjoyed it! It wasn't too heavy, but it was definitely filling. If you're not a fan of mozzarella cheese, you probably won't like this dish.

It doesn't seem so much to ask to offer a double burger, does it? Maybe I just want the 2nd patty and not all the extras...?\\n\\nThat said, all disappointment was quickly swept under the rug as I bit in to my burger, and was met with a very properly cooked little beauty. The restaurant name taken to mean \\"Little Burger, Big Flavor\\" definitely lives up to the promise. I opted for chevre on the burger - a neat choice. I think cheddar would be the star here, but I'm all for trying new things...\\n\\nAs for the fries, I'm still on the fence about truffle oil. I have Anthony Bourdain yelling at me in one year that its a fraud, and so many foodies saying it's amazing. I'm just not sure.\\n\\nMain issue I found was that the oil did not mix with the ketchup. I thought the house made spicy ketchup was fantastic, and a great addition to the concept, but you can only mix so many flavor combinations into one dish. The fries are salty, the ketchup is sweet and spicy, but trying to add umami to that is just...too much. Actually, the truffle oil got lost among the ketchup, so I found myself eating the fries and ketchup separately (yes, you read that correctly).\\n\\nI'll be back for sure, and will order two cheeseburgers, and share an order of fries with my friend. That would cost me under $9. I think I can handle that.\\n\\nAlso, they serve beer.

I wanted to fall in love with Giacomo's, but I just couldn't. \\n\\nI have lived in Boston for most of life, and I frequent the North End, but I have always avoided this place due to the long lines. We arrived on a very snowy Friday night, hoping to miss some of the lines. We were partially correct - there were about three parties ahead of us, so we waited about 15 minutes. From what I have seen of these lines before, that was nothing compared to other Friday nights. \\n\\nThe setting is typical North End - Tables so close together you can barely move and you better make friends with those sitting next to you since you will basically have dinner with them, too. No problem, I love the North End and was expecting no less! \\n\\nOur waitress came over and was fantastic - helpful, funny, and direct to the point. I could tell there would be no dilly-dallying in this place. We ordered wine ($17 bottle? Yes please!) and an appetizer of calamari. The app came out so quickly I swear the must have known we were coming. It was tasty but not the best. Then comes the main course. I ordered a shrimp and scallop dish with the house sauce. First, the pasta was boxed spaghetti. I have nothing against boxed pasta, but in the North End I at least expect the option to have handmade pasta. Perhaps I could have ordered it? I am not sure because I was never given a choice. The sauce was very good, but not out-of-control-amazing as I would have hoped it was. The scallops were small and the shrimp was a bit overcooked. Wait.... wasn't this supposed to be the most amazing Italian food I have ever had? Unfortunately, it wasn't. \\n\\nTo give them some credit - The food was pretty cheap... $30 each including tip and the wine.

In the end, we picked the lamb with cumin powder, lamb dumplings, and sizzling beef with a side of rice. All of the food came out really fast and in huge portions. Unlike a lot of Chinese restaurants that like to boost their dish size with vegetables or non-edible decorations, Silkway's dishes were legit huge in portions and packed with meat. I don't know how they could cook meat this tender, but every slice of lamb and beef was like the softest and most flavorful meat I have ever tasted. They tasted just like the ones I had in China.

I was so shocked by the expression on the face of my waitress that I actually felt compelled to tell her to smile. Delivering food to me is NOT the Bataan Death March. I am NOT an ogre. In any event, I got the Polpette for an appetizer, it was one meatball and it was ok but a little dry. I was surprised that it was so dry because making meatballs should be a basic skill in the North End. I got the Risotto di Mare for the entree. The risotto was burned and the \\"di Mare\\" consisted of on shrimp and one small scallop. The portion was almost as small as the appetizer. I got the Tiramasu for desert. Now, let us not forget this is the North End and pastry is a specialty. The tiramasu I recieved appeared to have been puchased at Stop and Shop. Very disappointing all around.

At $40 - $60 for the steak itself, this is one of the only places I feel actually matches the price.  \\n\\nService - Generally good.  I've had a few \\"meh\\" experiences, but that is to be expected now and again.  On average, their service is better than most high-end restaurants I've been to.\\n\\nAmbiance - Old, dark wood, somewhat dimmly lit.  You feel like you're in an old politician's place.  When they're busy, it can definitely get loud and snug, but they make good use of the space.\\n\\nLocation/Parking - Finding parking is quite the challenge, I've usually had to park blocks away, or get vallet.

We had a great bartender, Jay, who happened to be from the Pacific NW just like us, so we naturally bonded pretty quickly. \\n\\nWe ended up staying there for dinner and had a nice time.  The food was good (and I'm a foodie saying that), but nothing out of this world.  \\n\\nWe noticed what looked like a pretty cool deck off the upstairs that would be fun for the summer.  We're looking forward to checking the deck out as soon as it gets nice!\\n\\nA few days later, we came back as we were entertaining out of town guests.

I guess that consistency is part of what makes Thai food so popular.\\n\\nI often order from the traditional menu, like the noodle soups or the roasted pork on rice which includes crispy skinned pork and hard boiled egg.  Sometimes I even order the mama noodles which is really more like stir fried ramen, but the Thai version.  \\n\\nWhen I order from the non-traditional side, it's usually their signature Chilli Duck which is also very good.  It's a crispy boneless duck breast topped with a sweet chili sauce.  The peanut sauce they put on the veggies is also very tasty.\\n\\nI've never had a problem with the service here.

Finally got ringside seats, and it was awesome. I'd forego eating if I could sit there and watch the symphony of chef's create these beautiful dishes all night. Ok maybe I'd want to eat too. But these seats are great.\\n\\nWe did the chef's whim (Sunday night after 9) and this was probably my favorite time at Craigie thus far. Tony wasn't there (even though the website says 'Chef Tony Maws cooks for your table...') but the meal was still spectacular. I had met him at the Smoke This Rib Fest in Cambridge a few weeks prior and he was more than happy to chat for a few (and to take a picture).\\n\\nChef's Whim took about 2 hours (9:30 to 11:30) and service was great from start to finish. It was almost as satisfying to see the cooks break down the kitchen and clean everything as it was to watch them cook. Being ringside leaves the kitchen completely transparent, and it is so fun to watch the communication and camaraderie between everyone there throughout the night as they create the food for the dining room.\\n\\nIn terms of the food, I don't think there was a misstep all night. This is definitely the way to do it if you don't want to break the bank but still get delicious food (57$ for 6 courses). They give you a notecard to write down the dishes (see attached picture), but for me the highlight was (surprisingly) the pumpkin soup with crab. I didn't think the butter soup at Menton could be beat but I liked this even more. Savory, sweet, and spicy with texture from the crab meat was perfect. The kampachi sashimi was delicious with the pine nut cream and pear. There was only one meat course, but the lamb neck was meltingly tender. We got the brussel sprouts and bone marrow sides, which were perfect per usual.\\n\\nThe green apple sorbet palette cleanser and three different desserts (one for each of us) was the perfect nightcap.  Three 6 course meals, 6 cocktails, a beer, and two sides ran us $340 with tax and tip. Not bad.  We got to converse with a couple of the cooks as they were cleaning the kitchen at the end, and as I think of our experience I still marvel over the organized chaos that is the Craigie kitchen.

The sauce is my favorite part.  Usually the sauce is sort of a bland prerequisite merely serving as a vessel for tons of oregano and a canvas for the rest of the pizza.  But here they have some delicious recipe using chunky tomatoes.  They're just a little tart and they make the whole pizza!\\n\\nUsually I get the slice of the day, and at just under $4.00, it's not too bad of a deal, especially for Charles Street.  They're not small, either.\\n\\nHowever, if coming with a crowd, it's a good idea to order a whole pizza.  I would recommend Bub's Barbeque.  There's quite a lot of barbeque sauce and a few onions, so it's not what you would call delicate flavors, but the chicken is really good and makes for a hearty pizza.\\nAs an indulgence, the Steak and Gorgonzola is also quite decadent and bursting with strong flavors.  The steak is actually pretty tender, considering it's on a pizza, and the gorgonzola tastes nice and aged or whatever.\\nLOVE the Hawaiian too.  Every time I walk in I pray it's the Slice of the Day.\\n\\nOn another note, the employees are usually very friendly considering the number of noisy customers filling the tiny restaurant.  Once  I paid all in quarters (obnoxious, I know) and yet the cashier put up with it happily.

The building really isn't designed for the amount of traffic it has. \\n\\nThe order area has reasonable room for probably around five people at most. It is combined with the drink cooler and the condiments/napkins so anything more and you're starting to get in the way of people. The line-ups are often 15-20 people long. You are regularly in a position where you're waiting outside or the line-up goes through the eating area (again running into the issue where you're in the way of people). \\n\\nThe staff are kind. They're reasonable. I've never had an issue with wrong orders or difficult cashiers. \\n\\nI'm a fan of fried chicken and sandwiches. Who isn't? Church's is acceptable. This is the only franchise of the restaurant I've gone to so it is my only metric for the quality of Church's. The fried chicken itself is okay but I crash pretty heavily afterwards. It leaves me feeling ill. Tastes good but the after effects sort of ward you away. \\n\\nThe fries are good with the gravy. I personally prefer the chicken sandwich and the wrap over the fried chicken itself. They are quite good, filling, and don't leave you sick afterwards. \\n\\nThat being said, the prices aren't so great. They are mostly comparable with KFC so it's not an unreasonable price point given the market, but it is certainly an investment compared to other nearby restaurants.

Eventually, we asked for the late night menu so we could begin choosing our own tapas. We asked the waitress if everything on the menu was included in the unlimited deal, to which she responded \\"yes.\\" So, we began picking what we wanted to try, which were meats and cheeses as opposed to roasted carrots, chickpea spread, potatoes, etc. We thought everything was included in the $35 price, but when we got our bill, our waitress had upcharged us for the dishes we ordered. Instead of charging $35 per person, our bill was $115. When we questioned it, our waitress ended up taking off the charges but told us she had to charge for the Ceviche. We never actually received the Ceviche, so she did end up taking that off as well.

I prayed that it would at least meet my expectations.\\n\\nI ordered one of the specials, a home-made pasta with loberster, shrimp, and their house sauce. The pasta was much chewier than I would have liked, and the pasta sauce wasn't really different from what I've had many times over. The whole reason for getting fresh pasta is becuase of the texture. Its like eating instant noodles versus having a bowl from a japanese ramen joint. I would have been happier eating Barilla in this case. The food wasn't bad, but pretty standard.

If you have, go back and try the bolognese. I love Italian food and this is by far the best pasta dish I have ever tasted. The pappardelle pasta is perfect al dente, the sauce is exquisite, escaping the usually heavier characteristic of the bolognese sauce, the taste is almost delicate. The wild boar meat is cooked to the perfect degree of tenderness and melts right into your mouth. I wish I had ordered it too because I felt bad stealing from bf's plate of bolognese. I got the Linguine alle Vongole with linguine pasta and Ipswich clams, which was also delicious. The sauce has an very distinct taste and does not overwhelm the fresh seafoody taste of the clams at all. Usually it's very easy for clam dishes to become too much because sea clam tend to be more or less salty. But this was perfect.\\nA lot people have mentioned this place tend to be expensive, I think the pasta dishes are regular priced for North End and the quality is superb. I have certainly been to more expensive places and walked out disappointed. We didn't order from the Piatti Unici portions of the menu, which are on the pricier side, maybe rivaling the price of a more fine dining atmosphere. But the food is really good and with a Groupon, it's a steal.

Really, I didn't know what to expect from this place. It's funny because the publicist for another restaurant told me to check it out, so based on that recommendation, I did. A running buddy of mine never quite made it, so I was solo on my first visit. I had an appetizer and a drink. The appetizer was the French onion soup, but it was served a little different than normal. There were four or five dumplings in the french onion soup and inside there were onions...not sure I saw the cheese though. I still prefer the traditional style.\\n\\nThe second time I went to Stats I think was more indicative of how the place is best enjoyed. I met a couple of girlfriends up there and we hung out at the bar and met some guys and ate a big platter of nachos and had some drinks while shooting the breeze. The place was still relatively empty, surprisingly, but I guess it was a Sunday night, but shoot...isn't that when the football games come on?  I took more of a tour my second time around. The fight room is cool and when it isn't freezing I think the patio will be a decent hang out spot, though I can think of several places that have a much better view than the old Nike Pavilion parking lot.\\n\\nWill Stat redefine \\"sports bars\\" for Atlanta? That remains to be seen. It gets an extra star just for being \\"NEW,\\" being part of the Concentrics brand and having the history of being the old Adidas building or whatever the server was trying to tell me (notice they all wear Adidas gear). While it's nice to have a tap at your table I think many people will stick with the old standbys like Dugan's, Barley's, ESPN Zone, FOX Sports, to watch the big games.

Lately, I've been trying truly spectacular places and Cibo e Beve is no exception. We came in a few days after attending a special event at the chef's table, and wanted to experience the restaurant on a normal night.\\n\\nReservations were made and hopes held high for early on a Friday evening. We walked in just as the staff was gearing up for what promised to be a busy night. Our server was Matt, who was the perfect host for a wonderful dining experience.\\n\\nWe started with bread (H&F Bread) and a few cocktails. I have to admit, their cocktail program is much better than I expected. We tried their Moscow Mule and the Mr can't stop raving about it. I settled on the Hemingway Daquiri, since I've read so much about the resurgence of the daquiri as something other than a beach drink. I REALLY enjoyed it.\\n\\nIn terms of appetizers, we opted for the caprese salad with burrata. I cannot stress enough just how amazing this cheese is. You should try it. Yes, you. We also sampled the roasted cauliflower and were seriously impressed. Cauliflower needs lots of love to be truly delicious, and whatever magic they used on it absolutely worked. It was truly inspiring.\\n\\nWe HAD to try one of the pies and Matt recommended the Pope's pie. Wow. We were blown away. Veggies and smoked mozz atop a butternut squash crema. A tomato-free wonder.\\n\\nEntrees:\\nI had the \\"Storico Fresco\\" Casunzei, which was a savory beet and ricotta filled pasta. Really fun and different. The presentation alone is worth the price tag. A really beautiful dish.\\n\\nThe Mr went with the fish of the day and was quite happy with that selection.\\n\\nEven though we were ready to BURST at the seams, we couldn't pass up the dessert menu. The cereal milk panna cotta and cannoli left us dumbfounded. I was really impressed with the idea of using cereal milk (soaked in \\"Cap'n Crunch\\") as the base for a decadent panna cotta. \\n\\nSo why 5 stars? Easily one of the best meals we've had in Atlanta. Knowing Chef Linda Harrell is running the show in the kitchen, and the staff out front is over-the-top friendly and helpful makes this a go-to recommendation for friends and coworkers.

They are another example of what not to do when you have great pizza pizza at reasonable prices in the 1990's.  Yes, they used to be a gem.  I was psyched when I first found Pino's and I would frequent them, every time to my delight.  What happened?  Time passes and with it Pino's is slowly becoming less and less desirable.\\n\\nI'm not saying the pizza isn't good, it is.  It is also inconsistant.  The heart and sole that used to go into every pizza shows up here and there, far from always.  The overall quality just isn't there anymore.  Over the years I have gotten the impression that they are increasingly concerned with maximum profit and less concerned with the quality of their pizza.\\n\\nPino's is not alone, I would group Regina Pizzeria right along with them.  Two formally great pizza places that assume everyone will think they are the best because they were 20 years ago.  If you are going to either of these places because someone told you that it was the best who hasn't lived in the area in quite a while, you will be dissapointed.  Take away points for Pino's - other pizza places are getting better and new ones are popping up, you are slowly dying.\\n\\nPino's is also way overpriced for the quality these days.  There is comparable quality in the area for much less.  $15 for a one topping is a little obsurd for the size and quality.  The prices also increase like clockwork.  The number specials (2 slices and a soda, etc.), always seem to increase around August - I'm sure this has nothing to do with a new batch of students coming to the area who will inevidably be told by someone that Pino's is the best.\\n\\nPino's will always have their place, and I do still go, regardless of how I continue to be dissappointed.  They still get 3 stars because they are pretty good.  For those who judge pizza reviews based on the reviewers individual preference, I think Ernestos is the best.  The pizza is delicious and the size is right, although try and order a whole pizza there and not slices - Ernestos can be sloppy with leaving slices out too long."},{"name":"The Onion","address":"408 Brazos St","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"I called the onion for pizza delivery and asked the guy who answered the phone what he recommended for approximately 8 people.

After all, I had to try both the pepperoni and the mushroom.  Also worth mentioning that the sauce has a little bit of a kick to it...and the pizza is especially hot when you dump a whole container of crushed red peppers on it as well (whoops).

The server was extremely slow to take our drink and food orders.  He often disappeared for long periods of time.\\n\\nMy girlfriend and I ordered 4 tapa plates and a 2-person sized paella.  The tapa plates we ordered were the seafood ceviche, vanilla breaded salmon, cheesy scallops, and roasted duck leg.  Usually there's a variety of seafood when I've ordered ceviche in the past, but this ceviche only had salmon.  The vanilla salmon was breaded and overcooked.  The breading was hard and dry.  The cheesy scallops were ok, exactly how it sounds.  Lastly, the roasted duck was completely dry and overcooked. \\n\\nThe paella we ordered looked promising as it was loaded with seafood.  The initial bites were great but then there were many extremely salty bites that followed.  Some of the bites were so salty they were barely tolerable.  \\n\\nWe also ordered the special valentine's day dessert: profiteroles with ice cream.  Profiteroles and ice cream are one of my favorite desserts, but again, they looked great but the taste didn't live up to the hype.  The profiteroles weren't flaky.

Either way, I would like to share the blame with previous reviewers who gave far too many stars considering all the negative details provided in the review itself. If you had a bad experience, you shouldn't give 3 stars. Mango Thai Cuisine is NOT \\"A-OK.\\"\\n\\nSUMMARY: Depressing empty restaurant at 1:45pm on a holiday Monday with all the lights out, so it was dark and dismal. The server was unfriendly and could barely be bothered. The food was horrible.\\n\\nSERVICE: When I walked in, not a soul was eating or working in the dining room or at the front desk, and there was no bell for me to alert the staff that there was a customer. Once I sat down, the server still spent the entire time in the back until I was getting ready to leave. I suppose she wanted to make sure I didn't dash. Thai food is eaten with a spoon, yet when I asked for one, she looked at me like I had 10 heads. Once she brought it over to me, she looked it over and handed it to me. That would have been cool, but when I looked at it myself, I clearly saw that it was absolutely filthy and food stained, which I immediately brought to her attention. I swear she seemed to be talking loudly and crying in the back before she returned with a healthier looking utencil. From the moment I walked in, I felt unwelcome and that any simple request I made was a huge burden. It just seems wrong that I was worrying more about the server's restaurant experience than she was worrying about mine.\\n\\nATMOSPHERE: All the lights were out, so it was dark and depressing in the room. Despite the fact that today was unseasonably warm weather, the heat was blasting, making it uncomfortable.\\n\\nFOOD: I ordered Fresh Rolls ($5) and Pad Kra Pow which can be had with either ground pork or chicken. I chose the pork. (I forget how much. I'd like to say $8.) \\n\\nFresh spring rolls are a big crap shoot. Most restaurants don't do them all that well. They were the best part of the meal, but still missed the mark. On the positive note, the ingredients all seemed fresh (at least at one point). There was a generous basil leaf in each as well as some green onion to add flavor, but there was too much iceberg lettuce and vermicelli noodles. I couldn't tell whether the specs of shrimp were actually shrimp or imitation crab and the peanut-based dipping sauce had no flavor.\\n\\nPad Kra Pow is a spicy basil flavored meat dish made with either ground pork or chicken. I'm used to it being fairly dry apart from the oils that come out of the meat, and there is usually a generous amount of spicy basil, green and red pepper and onion. The Mango Thai Cuisine version was drowned in some sort of brown gravy, and the meat was of questionable quality and the grind was far more coarse than I would have liked.\\n\\nI asked for my check long before I was ready to leave. I was relieved to discover that I had perfect change and was able to bolt as soon as I'd had enough. I've had enough Mango Thai Cuisine to last a lifetime."},{"name":"Super Burrito Express","address":"10506 SE 42nd Ave","city":"Milwaukie","stars":"3.5","text":"I wanted to try this place.

He is from Latvia and his mother is Polish (she has went with us to Polonia a few times as well) so we are all well-versed in the ways of the beet and cutlet. (Wow, wouldn't The Beet & Cutlet be a cute restaurant name? Or a food truck name.) Polonia is one of our favorite places to eat (it's in our top 10) especially if it's been an especially drab week and we need some comfort food.\\n\\nMy favorites from this restaurant are the red beet borscht, stuffed cabbage rolls with tomato sauce, and smoked kielbasa. I'm not too much of a pierogi fan, but they do have delicious ones. Their sauerkraut is also pretty good but I am partial to my mother-in-law's version which is red. (I'm a little spoiled.) My husband is into the chicken, pork or veal cutlets. And welcome to one of the only restaurants in Orlando which serves horseradish with cutlets. (We love the HR.)\\n\\nGoing to Polonia so much actually inspired me to make red borscht myself, which I did successfully (the second time around). I am pretty good at it now but if I am not in the mood to scrub and boil beets, I can go to Polonia instead and I love that.\\n\\nSo there's delicious food every time (we've never had a bad food moment) and inspiration galore if you're trying to figure out how to make your favorite beet soup. They tend to also have different beer selections at times so there's always something fun to drink. Plus they have meat available to buy, as well as delicious breads, cake and pastries. \\n\\nBut what does Polonia not have?\\n\\nWell I will tell you. They do not have an endless supply of sour cream - they are trying to hoard all they can for the impending Great Sour Cream Depression. You see, we love our sour cream. Lots. Sour cream is a huge part of eastern European cuisine so naturally we're expecting some hefty spoonfuls. But at Polonia whenever we ask for extra sour cream, sometimes they say they'll have to charge for it, but sometimes they graciously don't. Either way, we get a tiny cup of sour cream to add to our soup. There also seems to be another connection - anytime that I have ordered pierogis, but have asked for extra sour cream for my soup, I do not get any sour cream at all for my pierogies. A potato and cheese pierogi without sour cream is a sad moment.\\n\\nSo there's some generosity problems here with the dairy, but we've been able to live with that. Everything else is in tip top shape at Polonia although at times they have different waiters/waitresses who don't seem so happy to be there and often forget things that we have asked. \\n\\nSmall quips aside, you should still head over there and get comfy. It's like any quaint family restaurant you'd find in the Polish countryside, including the big basket of flowers on one of the tables."},{"name":"Row 34","address":"383 Congress St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"What an unbelievable experience!

The crab cake was good as well but it was overwhelmed in the bernaise sauce. The asparagus was fine. On the side, my friend and I split a lobster tail. It was overdone. So that was disappointing. For the dessert was the chocolate cheesecake with fruit. The cheesecake could have been colder and it was a bit dense.

Everything was plated beautifully.\\n\\nWe ordered two of each of the appetizers.  \\nAppetizers:\\nLes coquilles st. jacques -Seared scallops, smoked kurobuta pork cheek, pickled green beans & horseradish vinaigrette.\\n - - Everyone LOVED this dish and we ate everything on the plate.  The scallops were tender and hot, the pork cheeks crispy and succulent, and the pickled green beans were crunchy and led us to feel a bit better about our food choices now that we had eaten some greens ;)\\n\\nLes Tapas - Charred octopus, avocado, aji vinaigrette. Pickled watermelon, serrano ham, arugula. Burrata, sun dried tomato & olive tapenade.\\n - - Octopus that isn't sickly chewy but delicious?  You got it here!  Great tapa dish, variety of flavors that contrasted one another in a harmonious way.\\n\\nCarpaccio d'omble de l'artique - Sumac & fennel cured artctic char, jalapeno vinaigrette, pepperdew, capers, creme fraiche, sunchoke chips.\\n - - I usually enjoy any type of capaccio and this is no exception.  \\n\\nMussels:\\nCoquotte - Mussels cooked in a white wine cream, smoked bacon lardons, spring onions.\\n - - Great fresh mussels and lots of \\"filling\\" in the pot.  The sauce is fantastic enough that we ordered bread rolls to soak it all up after the mussels were long gone.\\n\\nMains: \\nD√©gustation de fl√©tan - Battered, roasted & poached halibut, asparagus, mint, tamarind, bacalao, ginger & mustard sauce.\\n - - I was a bit disappointed by this dish.  The battered halibut was tasty, but such a small portion.  The poached halibut was not overly flavorful, and I didn't feel this dish was very special nor worth the $32.\\n\\nCanard et chevre - Roasted duck breast, goat cheese & tarragon gnocchi, sauteed scallions, hazelnut gastrique.\\n  - - This was easily my favorite dish.  The duck breast was succulent and cooked to medium rare perfection without being oily.  The goat cheese and tarragon gnocchi was al dente and though I normally don't eat goat cheese, it was balanced so well with the other flavors that I happily hoovered it back.  I highly recommend this dish if you like duck, and unlike our party, I'd recommend ordering your own dish and not sharing it just so you can eat more of it!\\n\\n\\nOverall, I would come again for a wonderful evening of great food."},{"name":"Dog Town Food Cart","address":"2880 SE Division St","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"Amazing food and service!

El Gringo has closed.  Happened in here last weekend and news is that they have closed this restaurant only to re-emerge as an Italian place (reason apparently being that there are no Italian restaurants on this strip of Manor already, solid reasoning the way I figure..supposing the new food's good).  Our server mentioned that the chef is a native of the old country (in this case, ahem, Italy) and the upcoming menu change should be an improvement.  \\n\\nThere was a table of about a dozen to sixteen folks all trying out dishes, Big Night style, when we were there, and they looked amped, maybe because the server kept bringing out mounds of food to eager eaters, and maybe cause they kept asking them what they thought of certain dishes.

Went in for Sunday brunch, and I couldn't believe that this place is still running and charging the prices that they were after my experience there. Not only was the service atrocious (the waiter absolutely looked like he didn't care, we saw our food waiting in the kitchen for a good 10 minutes so when we got our omelets they were cold, waiter didn't bring us any of our drinks/refilled water after I asked repeatedly that I had to get up and grab a water pitcher to fill my own glass), when we complained to whom I thought was the manager, she didn't even make any concessions or really offer any help. On top of that, my friend found a PLASTIC WRAPPER (as in the sheets that separate slices of cheese) in her omelet. Disgusting, I have never been more appalled by a restaurant in my entire life."},{"name":"Giacomo's Ristorante - Boston","address":"355 Hanover St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"A few things to note right off the bat:\\n\\n1. WARNING: If you are someone who craves attention and intricate special treatment from the server, this place is not for you. The servers move fast due to the line and amount of people they serve.  They simply have no time to lollygag with you or chat with you about your day.  They will simply do their job filling your cup and serving you food.  They're just trying to make the process as fast as possible.  Don't take it personally.\\n\\n2.  The line is without a doubt always worth it if the weather is nice/tolerable or if the line isn't insanely long.  If the weather is terrible out and the line wraps around the block I would just go to another restaurant in the North End due to the large amount of other great Italian restaurants in the area. However, I would certainly recommend going here at least one night if you are on vacation/business in Boston.  \\n\\nOn to the food: To put it simply, it is fantastic.  The linguine in any form is guaranteed to taste great.  We chose linguine with clams and the frutti di mare linguine.  The seafood is fresh and the scampi sauce is superb.  The food here is also cheap, with the most expensive linguine dish costing $19 (the frutti di mare which includes shrimp,scallops,calamari,clams and mussels).  They don't skimp out on the portion sizes either.  We were both fully stuffed after.  \\n\\nOn to the atmosphere: The atmosphere is certainly not for everyone.  It is fast paced, bustling, and a little loud.  It is NOT an upscale romantic dinner location.  This is exactly why I love the atmosphere.  It feels genuine and far different from the faux upscale feeling Italian restaurants surrounding it.  In the background over the bustling noise was the faint sound of 1940's/1950's Italian music which made the experience that much more genuine feeling. This is what an Italian restaurant should be in the North End; crazy and bustling, but also crazy good with a touch of ambiance that perceptually places you firmly in a busy restaurant in Italy in the 50's."},{"name":"The Salty Pig","address":"130 Dartmouth St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"I went to the Salty Pig for after work drinks and pizza for the first time.

Nope, it was just the door sticking.  Give it some muscle.  Also close the door with great intent, otherwise a draft will slip in through the sizeable crack and sweep over the tables set along the front window.\\n\\nWe opted to share a number of items, beginning with their Croquettes de Poisson $7 Pan fried savory fish cake (flounder) served with cilantro and garlic sauce.  It arrived as three irregularly shaped and portioned patties.  Moist, but on the bland side.  Yeah, it needed some salt.  But it had a nice crisp crust.\\n\\nThe Salade Ordinaire $6 Mixed greens, chopped russet potatoes, sweet potatoes, beets, and boiled eggs, tossed in coconut-lime dressing, in my opinion was ironically named, as an ordinary salad in the U.S. is generally iceberg lettuce with perhaps a scattering of shredded carrots, a piece of tomato and a couple of slices of cucumber, with your choice of bottled dressings.  The mix of ingredients here were not new to my palate individually, but as a conglomerate, it was.  It went well together and made for a light and refreshing course.\\n\\nThe Michoui $17 Marinated roasted lamb shank (falling off the bone) served with a caramelized onion sauce and Moroccan couscous was as described, with the meat easily eased off the bone.  But it was must have been a tiny lamb - I'm sure this entree alone would not have satiated my hunger.  And everything on the plate was on the soft side, which gave me little to test my teeth against.  Sometimes you just want a little chew, you know?  There was also an unannounced spicy heat to this dish.\\n\\nWe considered ordering a side of their Yucca Fries $5 after considering the size of the lamb entree against the remaining space in our tummies, but they were out, so that was not to be.\\n\\nWe tried two of their three juice offerings.\\n\\nBissap juice $3 \\nSorrell juice mixed with pineapple juice and flavored with orange flower water and vanilla sugar\\n\\nBouye juice $3\\nBouye (fruit from the baobab tree) juice mixed with cream and flavored with orange flower water and vanilla sugar\\n\\nThey were interesting.

That aside, I like the Indian kitchen.  It's small and can be crowded at lunch with OSU students and staff taking advantage of the lunch buffet, which includes a good selection of both meat and vegetarian options.

Hopefully it will ease you're mind while you wait:\\n\\nI got there at about 20:50 (8:50 PM), and the line was backed up about eight parties in front of us.\\n\\n- There are about ten tables that seat about four people as well as a couple seats at the bar. I think your best chance of getting a table quickly is with a party of four or less.\\n\\n- You don't need to put your name down. The waiters and waitresses will come out and see how many are in your party to assess how they will get you in\\n\\n- We were told that upon arrival, we had an hour to an hour and a half wait. We got in at about twenty to thirty minutes\\n\\n- We were also told that if we didn't get in by 21:30 (9:30 PM), we wouldn't get to eat today. However, we left at 22:07 (10:07 PM), and they were still letting people come in to eat. Still, this could be a nice day, so I do suggest getting there early.\\n\\nInside:\\nLike I said, there's only about ten tables, so you imagine that things are tight. Don't be surprised if you're sharing a table with another group. There's a lot of hustle and bustle, but it's all a part of the process.\\n\\nService:\\nI thought service was great. You order right when you get in, the food comes out hot and quickly, your drinks are always filled, and the waiters and waitresses are pretty entertaining. If you feel like you're being rushed, think about the poor souls that are outside waiting to be as happy as you are! I did my best to get in and out while still getting the full experience.\\n\\nFood:\\n- Calamari. Best I've ever had. This is a must! Super tender. Not rubbery. The breading doesn't separate from the squid and isn't gritty. The especially liked that they fried some peppers and through it in with the squid.\\n\\n- Mussels in Giacomo sauce. First off, if you're like me, you always butcher Italian dish names. The restaurant and the sauce is pronounced gee-ack-ko-mo. Alright, the mussels combined with the Giacomo sauce combined with a little bread for dipping... Awesome! The sauce just melts in your mouth, and the mussels taste so fresh.\\n\\n- 1/2 Lobster, Clams, and Mussels over Linguini in Giacomo Sauce. Usually when I go Italian, I like to get the Frutti di Mare. Though this was an option, I couldn't say no to the 1/2 lobster option for a dollar more. The one thing that made me hesitant at first was that I wouldn't get scallops, but when I got my dish, there was a single scallop on my plate for me to get my fix. Hahaha. The plate is no joke. Nothing on the plate is lacking. You get enough of everything. The lobster was sweet and consisted of head, tail, and claw. The linguini was cooked very well, and the plate is piping hot. It didn't take me long to clean my plate. I did leave the claw at first because it's not usually my thing, but the waiter came out and told me that I need to finish, so I complied.

It specializes in authentic Italian pizza. There is an adequate amount of free parking, and it is open to all sorts of age groups. The restaurant can hold a large group. One down side to the setting is that the restaurant is quite loud with the restaurant music. It can be disturbing when you are trying to talk to someone across the table from you. The restaurant allows BYOB/drinks. \\n\\nFirst starting off, the pizza is not your typical Papa Johns pizza. The pizza is made from scratch unlike other chain pizzerias. The restaurant's ingredients are freshly made by the cooks, and the customers can see the employee make them. The production speed is fast and efficient. A customer must order first when you enter the restaurant and has to find his or her own seat. \\n\\nI had the pleasure of trying out multiple kinds of pizza in this restaurant. Two facts stick out the most for me: First, fresh ingredients with authentic style of toppings, and second, the pizza does not leave you feeling bloated or greased out. A lot at times, chain pizza places use butter brushes and drench the dough and crusts with melted butter, but in Antico Pizza, you're not going to find that. No matter how much cheese the restaurant smothers, it's still not oily or greasy like other pizza chains in town. \\n\\nThe Margherita Pizza is very simple, and this is the only pizza where you can pick a protein topping. Other pizzas on the menu cannot be modified. I had mine with sausages and it was very flavorful. The tomato sauce was not too sweet or dominant, and it balanced very well with the garlic and the basil. It's one of the most popular pizzas in the restaurant. \\n\\nMy favorite pizza is the Capricciosa. The flavor on this pizza is very diverse. The acidity from the artichoke goes very well with the cheese and the tomato sauce. The mushroom is very fresh, and the restaurant uses the \\"good\\" kind of mushrooms. A lot at times, pizza places like to use the cheap mushrooms, but this pizza did not have those type of mushroom. The prosciutto cotto was beautifully placed with a well balanced portion on the pie. What so good about this pizza is that it has a melody of acidity and the base of cheese playing against each other creating a great harmony. It has multiple flavors and that's what I love the best about this one. \\n\\nThe Calzoni Napoletana are great, but I am not a huge fan of calozones in the first place. I can't comment too much about them, but some people describe them as folded pizza with marina sauce on the side to dip in. If you love calzones, I recommend trying them here because the people that like calzones overall like the Antico calzones. \\n\\nOverall, I want to say that this is the best pizza place that Atlanta can offer. I know some people love Mellow Mushrooms and other bar pizza places, but Antico Pizza offers an unique flavor and combination of ingredients that leaves you wanting more."},{"name":"All Asia Bar","address":"334 Massachusetts Ave","city":"Cambridge","stars":"3","text":"Eh, I still get the creeps here. I love the whole \\"Asian restaurant that's given in and become a rock venue, mostly\\" thing, but the booking is erratic, the drinks overpriced, the setup just horrible, and the constant, nagging signs on every available surface saying \\"One drink minimum -- what would you like?\\" are really irritating. Making things worse, the last time I was there a waitress saw me without a drink and made sure to remind me there's a one-drink minimum, as if it was possible not to know that.\\n\\nSee your favorite band here if they come to town, but be sure to offer them suggestions on better places to play."},{"name":"Draft Pick","address":"1620 E Riverside Dr, Ste 1618","city":"Austin","stars":"3","text":"This place is great for watching sports. Almost every inch of every wall has a flatscreen on it playing a game. They even had a few on the golf channel which is awesome. Their late night happy hour is also great, half price appetizers for 3 bucks and discounts on drinks. I think it runs from 9pm-11pm. The food isn't anything special, typical sports bar fare but at $3 you can't complain. The ambiance is clean, modern, and spacious. I've only been here for the happy hour and the reason why I'm not giving it more stars is because I don't think I'd pay full price for their food. It's pretty pricey for what you get. Also this is an Oakland Raider Nation bar during football season, another star deducted. Go Niners."},{"name":"Nakato Japanese Restaurant","address":"1776 Cheshire Bridge Rd NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Love love love! The atmosphere was great! I wanted to try Benihana's so bad but when I got there the prices were ridiculous. My boyfriend and I decided to try Nakato based on the Yelp reviews. I am NOT disappointed. Usually at this type of place, they will make you wait until someone else comes to sit at the grill to fill up the table. This wasn't the case here. We were quickly served our soup, then salad. Only downfall- which is totally personal, I hate ginger sauce as salad dressing. This is the only dressing they have. The service was great, the chef was entertaining and very personable. Nothing bad to say..I will be back!"},{"name":"Hi-Nippon Japanese Restaurant","address":"2274 W 4th Avenue","city":"Vancouver","stars":"3.5","text":"Better than average sushi place.  A little expensive but fresh, good service and neat.  It's, to my opinion, a sure shot."},{"name":"Raglan Road Irish Pub","address":"1640 E Buena Vista Dr","city":"Lake Buena Vista","stars":"4","text":"This restaurant is over rated and over priced. Service was slow and the food delivered was mostly French fries along with a $15 hamburger. The fish fry was the same. One small piece of fish and mostly fries. I suggest you dine across the highway at one of the restaurants in the Crossroads area."},{"name":"Fresh Off the Truck","address":"4209 Airport Blvd","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"This is easily one of the best food trucks in Austin.  Great flavor combinations.  The Bruce Lee is amazing.  Tried this truck at one of the \\"Trailer Tuesdays\\" and have yet to be disappointed.  Consistency in quality & flavors.   Food is fresh.\\n\\nEnjoy thoroughly and wish it were closer to my home.  Only reason FOT got 4 stars is because I have not sampled the entire menu.  But am looking forward to it!"},{"name":"The Lower Depths","address":"476 Commonwealth Ave","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"Best beer selection in Boston. Yes, it is getting overly populated lately and the prices are getting raised. But if you are looking for Unibroue and other Belgian or Trappist ales, it's one of the few places to go. And I pick it over Bukowski's due to its size and the fact it has outdoor seating in the summer. Also, I am completely 100% addicted to their soft-baked pretzel with sourdough/beer mustard. The food prices are beyond reasonable (meaning you can indulge in more beer of course!). The staff is always friendly and knowledgeable, great to ask beer questions and fun to joke around with. I prefer going while the Sox are on the road, but can always be persuaded to go to the Depths."},{"name":"Pita Pit","address":"479 Harvard St","city":"Brookline","stars":"4","text":"We have pita pits at my school and they're ok, So I decided to stop by and honestly if it's not on my meal plan the pita pit is not where i'd want to go by again"}]`),N={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:M},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:6,poemsData:O,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.poemsData.filter(n=>{const e=this.searchQuery.toLowerCase();return n.name.toLowerCase().includes(e)||n.city.toLowerCase().includes(e)||n.text.toLowerCase().includes(e)}).slice(0,this.visibleCount):this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(n=>setTimeout(n,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},R={class:"search-container"},E={class:"card-container"},j=["disabled"],D={key:0},H={key:1};function L(n,e,s,f,i,r){const u=p("PoemCard");return a(),o("section",null,[e[3]||(e[3]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"üéâ Restaurant Reviews ü•≥")])],-1)),t("div",R,[e[2]||(e[2]=t("span",{class:"search-icon"},"üîç",-1)),b(t("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=h=>i.searchQuery=h),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[v,i.searchQuery]])]),t("div",E,[(a(!0),o(y,null,m(r.filteredPoems,(h,g)=>(a(),k(u,{key:g,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),r.hasMorePoems?(a(),o("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:i.isLoading,onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=(...h)=>r.loadMore&&r.loadMore(...h))},[i.isLoading?(a(),o("span",H,"Loading...")):(a(),o("span",D,"See more"))],8,j)):w("",!0)])}const F=c(N,[["render",L],["__scopeId","data-v-68c21f81"]]),V=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"people/1.md","filePath":"people/1.md"}'),G={name:"people/1.md"},Y=Object.assign(G,{setup(n){return(e,s)=>(a(),o("div",null,[I(F)]))}});export{V as __pageData,Y as default};
