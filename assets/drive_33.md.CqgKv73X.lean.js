My husband specifically asked if they had hard cider on draft and she said yes. Then she brought him a bottled cider. I asked for a martini with an upgrade on the liquor and she didn't even ask me what I wanted. I gave her two choices and she said \\"OK.\\" What?!! I have no idea what my drink was made with and it tasted like the well version not an upgrade. I foolishly ordered the grouper special ($20) and it barely filled me up. Tasted good but not the typical generous portions we are accustomed to at BRG. Our server was the biggest disappointment. I asked her if she was new and she said she had been there 7 months. One of the main reasons we love BRG is the service. We are used to being greeted with a smile and feeling of being welcomed. Last night was a serious disappointment.

Sucks too, because I've heard so many great things about Hopdoddy. \\n\\nThe biggest reason I think the ordering/seating system doesn't work is because this place is in a prime location on SoCo and rather busy. The amount of seating just doesn't seem sustainable for how popular it's become. I got there on a Wednesday evening, and the line was not yet out the door. I was rushed in by an exhausted looking server (I don't blame her, I'd go nuts working nights here) to wait my turn at the first stop which is the bar. The people behind me were rude as hell, edging up right on my ass and having no respect for my personal bubble. I felt crammed and uncomfortable, even after downing a beer. I know it's not Hopdoddy's fault entirely, but I was stuck with these jerks the whole line and it made me miserable. \\n\\nThe next stop was to wait for food, and at this point it had been almost 30 minutes. I was not happy. If I'm going to wait to eat, I don't want to do it in a line feeling like a piece of cattle being herded. But, I'd already ordered a beer and made it this far. Might as well go all the way. It wasn't like I could easily walk through this place anyway. I got up to the counter and ordered a Buffalo Bill, got a number, and was left to search for my table. It was loud and hard to hear my server as she rushed off to deal with something else. I wasn't too happy about that either, but whatever. At least I was able to sit down. \\n\\nNow, the food is quite good. The burger was tasty and cooked right so that was great. I also got a Nutella shake which was my favorite thing about my visit. Actually, when I was finally able to sit and just ENJOY myself, and relax, the whole Hopdoddy experience was much more enjoyable. I wish I could have just done that from the beginning.\\n\\nWhile I enjoyed the food and everything after sitting down, the line system just ruins this place for me. It's way too crowded for it, the line takes a long time (we weren't even there are peak hours, apparently), and there are places in town serving burgers just as good or better that know how to be efficient.

Would order again.\\n\\nMy wife really enjoyed the lamb (I didn't have much so can't comment in too much detail).\\n\\nThe goat chili was extremely good -- rice just right, some peppers, some vegetables, meat tender but still with just a bit of chewiness. The flavors were perfect, as was the heat level (I got 5, which was spicy enough to be present but not covering the other flavors). Looking forward to trying this with duck next time (lamb is the obvious choice but the menu is so wide, I have to branch out!).\\n\\nThe blueberry haluwa I could take or leave; it was whipped cream (I think?) over a blueberry-chocolate cake that was pretty firm. My wife really enjoyed it. On the other hand the rice pudding was just so good, I wish I could take a vat of it home..."},{"name":"Desta Ethiopian Kitchen","address":"3086 Briarcliff Rd NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4.5","text":"By far one of the best Ethiopian restaurants in Atlanta.

It is located INSIDE of a Toyota/Scion car dealership. The dealership occupies 3 of the corners at the intersection of NE Victoria and NE Broadway; the cafe is in the building on the NW corner of that intersection.  Fortunately there are some signs that reassure you that the Only Way Cafe in fact exists.\\n\\nWhen I went inside, I was worried I was going to be swarmed with car salesmen trying to get me into a Toyota TODAY, but they left me alone. \\n\\nThe cafe has a small counter, and  about a dozen tables (mostly high-top 2 seaters). The menu is small, and consists of basics like breakfast wraps, soups, and sandwiches.  I got a turkey sandwich on sourdough, chips, and a Pepsi.  Total price: $6.  I wish the sourdough had been toasted, but other than that it was pretty good.\\n\\nService was friendly, and the food didn't take long.\\n\\nI can't really understand why this cafe exists.  Is it for the employees? Are customers supposed to eat there while they are shopping for a car? Do the neighborhood locals frequent it? It is bizarre. \\n\\nI don't think anyone would go out of their way to dine there (\\"Hey guys!

So last year, we started a \\"Locke Ober fund.\\"  Each time we had a bit of extra cash, we'd squirrel it away.  That way, when we made it to the restaurant, we could truly enjoy it instead of having to order only the least expensive entree and cheapest glass of wine.\\n\\nWe were surprised that it was pricey, but not any more expensive than some of the newer high end restaurants around town like KO Prime. But on to the food...\\n\\nMy companion started with the JFK Stew and an iceberg salad with humboldt fog cheese and warm bacon dressing.  The stew was excellent, with a creaminess and savory spice that was unusual and delicious. The salad was a creative take on a classic iceberg wedge, with thick chunks of bacon and a slab of quality cheese.  I had the \\"unique Caesar,\\" featuring a soft-boiled egg and just a hint of anchovy.  I also had the soft-shell crab--the almond flour added a great flavor, and the garlic and ramps really added dimension to the dish.  \\n\\nAlready we could notice what high standards of quality they have for their ingredients.  The lobster had none of the aftertaste that you might find in some shellfish, and even the iceberg lettuce seemed greener.\\n\\nHe had the filet mignon, a good cut of meat served with a wonderful sauce that was unusual but fitting.  My bluefish was a generous portion of delicious fish despite it's bad reputation.  It was served with half a lobster tail, which had a chipotle-lime butter slab atop it, as well as more lobster on the side.  (How I missed the lobster accompaniment I don't know, as I don't enjoy lobster. But this was excellent nonetheless.)\\n\\nThe modern additions to our entress like the chipotle-lime butter seemed a bit out-of-place.  We'd have preferred a simpler dish that highlighted the quality of the ingredients. But it was all good nonetheless.\\n\\nThe wine list is daunting; we didn't ask if there was a sommelier to help us, but we should have.  Our choice was just okay. A manhattan before the meal was excellent, and my companion's dessert Riesling was perfect.\\n\\nSomehow we found room for dessert.  My creme brulee was wonderful, not too eggy but smooth and tasty.  My companion loved his Indian pudding, which he felt was a perfect ending for a quintessential New England experience.\\n\\nService was as it should be: always attentive but never obtrusive.  The maitre d' also kept an eye on the room, anticipating any need.  Instead of pointing me to the ladies' room, he escorted me to the door.  Nice touch.  Oddly, I was one of only four women dining the entire evening; their clientele definitely skewed toward older white men conducting business meals while we were there.\\n\\nLocke-Ober is a great one-time Boston experience for locals and tourists.  But unless you have the disposable cash to eat here regularly without a second thought, I'm not sure it's a place to visit again."},{"name":"FLIP burger boutique","address":"1587 Howell Mill Rd","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Steak Tar Tar burger is dope.

If you're from Guam, you know that the best Chamorro food is made by moms, nanas, titas, some dads and uncles, etc., and brought out in full force at fiestas, weddings, funerals, graduations, golden anniversaries, etc....anything that involves a large gathering of people!  This is the kind of food you will find at PDX671!  \\n\\nI flew in from the East Coast and made it a priority to visit PDX671. A couple of friends and I ordered almost the entire menu.  It was a lot of food and we expected to wrap leftovers, but we ate everything.  We couldn't stop because it was so delicious.  Only the chicken bones were left.  \\n\\nChef Ed and his ultra congenial wife/assistant really know their stuff.  PDX671 has the best Chamorro shrimp patties I've ever tasted.  Chamorro shrimp patties are usually a batter of ground fresh shrimp, flour, milk, some baking powder and salt, and bits of sweet corn, peas, and carrots.  PDX671's shrimp patties are excellent -- crispy outside, tender inside, and not a hint of greasiness.  They are delicate delicious puffs.  If you visit, order a lot of these.  The titiyas (Chamorro flat bread) are impressive - made fresh with coconut milk, hand rolled, then grilled to order.  The barbecued chicken, grilled on a hot pit, is savory and juicy with its soy sauce lemon marinade.  The red rice, made with top grade Japanese rice and ground achiote seed, is a great accompaniment to the barbecued chicken, especially with a drizzle of finadene on top, veggies stewed in coconut milk, and pickled papaya (which has great bite and is infused with just the right amount of heat). The chicken kelaguen is hand chopped and has that authentic kelaguen flavor - that means you can taste chicken that has been grilled on a fire (not boiled or baked), and tossed with fresh lemon juice, green onions and grated coconut.  The lumpia are light and delicious, rolled by hand, fried crisp, and served with a tart vinegar and garlic sauce.  \\n\\nPDX671 is great food and service with a smile.

Wonderful cupcakes and Bars and Breadpudding like you wouldn't expect. \\n\\nService: As to the service, I'm with you on the slowness; but I can say, they accommondated us through the food and the constant sample platters of desserts that were brougth to our table.  And they explained that they were ONLY a 2 week old business that were HIT with scout mobbers.  We scout mobbers have definately SHUT DOWN businesses to where they have RUN OUT OF FOOD.  \\n\\nRecommendation/RETURN:  I DEFINATELY RECOMMEND this place. The food was excellent, service TIME needs to be worked on, but friendly people, and Great Ambiance.  we returned 2 days in a row following Dec 10th and have gotten great service since then.  And I also asked about the \\"french thing\\"  - I dont believe they are a FRENCH bakery, I was told its a \\"southern style bistro/bakery\\" with FRENCH influence (thus your moroccan pulled pork, and light french fan-fairs).  \\n\\n@Adam S - you should try them again in the near future and perhaps give them another opportunity and then make a final decision.  \\n\\nBut Im with Brian K and Keaton - Great little gem.

The sambar  (the lentil soup) that comes with the dosa tasted stale and I was afraid to have that with my dosa.  The chicken items tasted like they had been recycled too. So we decided to only eat the 'poori' and samosa and some of the veggie items. \\n\\nb) Not only did some of the food taste stale, but all the items lacked the true taste and flavor of Indian food and were pretty blah! I can understand that an Indian restaurant in the US will not offer authentic spicy and hot food since they cater to a large group of non-Indian customers. But the chef did a poor job of preparing some very typical Indian food items such as the chicken tikka masala, aloo gobi, palak paneer etc. \\n\\nThe only good thing I can say about the restaurant is that the decor is pretty nice. It was very crowded at around 1:30 on a Saturday afternoon, but most of the people were non-Indians. There were no Indians at the restaurant when we were there. Well, I am not surprised! Chances are they checked out the place once and made up their minds not to waste money there! In fact, most of the rave reviews about Bukhara are from non-Indians and perhaps they are not too familiar with Indian food to know or care too much....\\n\\nAnyway, I conclude by repeating that both my husband and I had a horrible experience at Bukhara and are definitely not planning to vist the place again!"},{"name":"CafeNineteen","address":"265 18th St Nw","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3","text":"Located right mid of Atlantic Station, with nice outdoor seating. \\n\\nThat's about it though.

Well, how about to cut down the hype. Cafe Medina has a great atmosphere, but it's a little underwhelming for the hype and the line. 30 mins at 11:00am on a Tuesday? This better be amazing.\\n\\nWe got two waffles, the salmon fume, and fricasse. The short ribs were tender but nothing to write home about. I think I prefer a kalbi style marinade to the BBQ-sauce heavy marinade used here. The fricasse was an interesting combination and had beautiful artisanal plating (props for the mini cast-iron skillet), but for $17 and all the hype I expected to be wowed.\\n\\nThe salmon fume was closer to getting good value as it was only $12, and I especially liked the combination of vinegar and the crunch of the red peppers, so if I returned I think I would get that.\\n\\nI will say the waffles were very good. Possibly the best waffles I've ever had. Tender and soft, and full of flavor, these definitely are an experience. But at $3.15 (+$1 for sauce), I'm not sure how many you can have. They are tiny! If you're a foodie, you may love this place for the waffles alone.\\n\\nI saw that lots of reviews also raved about the coffee. I can't comment on that, so maybe that would've swayed me, although I'm doubtful given how much the rest of the menu was hyped.\\n\\nOverall, it's an \\"A-OK\\" type of place. Overpriced and overhyped, with a few spectacular things on the menu, but also more style than substance.

Although it was ridiculously busy there, I have to admit that it wasn't very hard to get a drink so the service was quick. We did not eat there, but it looked like they were serving bar food.

Turkey sausage, egg and cheeses with this wonderful salsa and their very best shmear--a spicy manifestation of creaminess and jalapeno spiciness.  Under the warmth of the meat and eggs it gets nice and melty, achieving that ooziness that is cream cheese realized in its more perfect form.

This is a local hang out where you just sit back and soak it all in. \\n\\nThe waitstaff served pies to Pilgrims they have been here so long. Some people have called them rude, but I find them engaging, personable, and committed to their product and customers. \\n\\nI have never had a kebab ... \\n\\nBut the pizza .... The pizza is a combination of flavor, atmosphere, tradition ... The taste is far better than it looks ... Though they look pretty good!\\n\\nMy favorite is the sausage, hot cherry pepper, and garlic. Always charred to perfection, it is the perfect combination of salt, heat, sweet, and texture. One bite somehow takes you back to a moment in time that means something to you. \\n\\nMuch lime the Roxy Pizza takes me back to the Portville Drive In with my mom and sister when I was a kid. \\n\\nBut I digress ... My family love the Pepperoni Pizza. I know it sounds pedestrian and pedantic (Family Guy reference), but the pepperoni pizza somehow just tastes better than any other. \\n\\nSantarpio's blows away Regina .... It is not even a contest. \\n\\nI put Santarpio's on my Mt. Rushmore of pizza ....\\n\\n1. Mozza - I LOVE Nancy!  It was great meeting her the other night. \\n2.

For its thickness (still pretty good, not like Pizza Hut thick or anything), it had a really good slight crunch without being burnt at all.\\n- Service was pretty bad. We ordered our pizza over the phone and walked into the mostly empty restaurant in the middle of the afternoon on a Saturday, and basically got yelled at by the bartender for calling in the order and even THINKING about stepping into the restaurant and sitting. So sorry for not knowing that's the way it works. We had to go into a side door and wait awkwardly for our pizza to be cooked while the chef, dishwasher, and cashier guys worked away. The lady who ended up wrapping our pizza up and handing it to us was pretty sweet to us though.\\n- Wish they had more toppings (like spinach! sun dried tomatoes!).

They have about 7 employees at a time all running around the back, and there are only about 3 cunstomers in line.  They are very inefficient in processing/taking orders.  One lady had to glance at the screen about 10 times, 20 seconds each time just to read one order.  Some people don't wear hair nets, and some people don't wear gloves.

I really should knock off two. I had the salmon teriyaki bento box; my friend had several different rolls: Spicy salmon, the Rocky Mountain roll (tuna, eel, avocado, tobikko), and ika nigiri. My salmon teriyaki had a hair in it (in the bottom suggesting that it fell in when they were plating it up), and the brown rice was very dry. My friend's spicy salmon was not spicy at all, and he found a very large bone in the roll.\\n\\nIf a place cannot even break down fish, do NOT eat there. I am not a sushi chef but I actually know how to de-bone a piece of salmon. It isn't rocket science. If they are neglecting some this basic, and important, it makes me worry.\\n\\nAlso: Way too much rice for the rolls and nigiri and it was too sticky, too wet, and not packed well at all so the sushi fell apart. My friend's rolls would break into pieces before he could get it to the soy sauce dish. Same for the nigiri. Today was humid and slightly drizzly so obviously they did not adjust their blend or moisture recipe to account for the added moisture in the air, something any competent sushi chef should be doing.\\n\\nI will probably not be going back. Between hairs, bones, and rice quality, this place is now henceforth stricken (struck?) from my list of eateries.\\n\\n***************\\n\\nPrevious review (3 stars):\\n\\nI work across the street from this place and have only been three times because I would easily go broke trying to afford the food here.\\n\\nEven their lunches are a little on the pricey side. Their hamachi Jalapeno style sashimi is tasty but about $15 for a couple ounces of fish and jalapenos which, last I checked, aren't exactly expensive. And hamachi is not exotic, I've eaten some pretty weird fish and this is not one of them.\\n\\nI will give them props for their bento boxes, I had a chicken teriyaki for lunch one day and it was quite tasty. Lightly breaded chicken in a flavorful, not overly sweet teriyaki sauce with brown rice, a veggie roll, and a salad. The peanut dressing on the salad was quite good and the rice wasn't overly dry, which is quite a feat.\\n\\nThe one dish I would recommend to stay away from is the katsu: I ordered it one day (chicken) and the top was relatively crispy but the bottom was soggy which is consistent with cooking ahead of time, then popping it in a microwave. Bad call.\\n\\nTheir sushi is not terrible but has its flaws. I had saba (Boston mackerel) nigiri and they were HUGE. I have a pretty big mouth (no jokes, boys) and had a difficult time with this. The rice was overwhelming. Nigiri means \\"rice finger\\" but these were like thumbs. Of a mountain gorilla. In addition the saba had a slightly metallic taste which means it was probably not very fresh. I did however have tai (red snapper) nigiri one time and the rice fingers were nicely shaped and it was actually snapper, not tilapia like some places serve, and the fish was fairly tender and fresh tasting.\\n\\nAll in all a hit or miss: If you know what to order and have the wallet, it is a fine place to eat.

Who the hell was the smart-ass who put my bed on a rollercoaster? Since when does the sun lower itself instead of rise? And how did the hotel get the desk and chairs to hang off the walls like that? Why is it that instead of standing up like a normal human being I'm falling sideways and having to grip the wall. Note to self: no more drinking heavily. Or at least drinking heavily without eating. And then taking cough medicine on top of it. \\n\\nOK, that's it. I'm seriously going to kill the chucklehead who's pounding on the drums so rhythmically in my room. Was that an added bonus with the hotel? Oh... no, that's my watch ticking off seconds.\\n\\nWarrior needs food... badly! And coffee. Give me coffee or give me death. Or... if I'm already dead, please just pour some coffee on my corpse, maybe it will sink in and give my pour tortured spirit some respite.\\n\\nI don't know how I managed to shower without falling down and braining myself. I did drop my deodorant on my toe. Frickin hurt. Which took my mind off the pounding in the rest of my body for about 3 seconds.\\n\\nI wandered down to Mother's Bistro. Looked inside at the humongous crowd. Listened to the cacophony of dishes and dining. No thanks, I'd rather listen to thrash metal.\\n\\nI checked mobile.Yelp.com on my phone. Punched in 'Breakfast' in Portland, OR. Limited to downtown. Got the Bijou... Brett O.'s review. Good review to read. I headed over, walked in, saw that there was no waiting list for the counter, and sat my sorry, aching, pounding, caffeine-less body down.\\n\\nThe wait staff were awesome. Maybe it was obvious I needed nourishment, I mean I didn't need a glowing neon sign over my head, I think the red in my eyes and my general sickly skin pallor did that for me. I got coffee and OJ right up. Pulp in my OJ, which I usually hate but this was some fresh squeezed stuff, like they had one of those machines out back that grinds the orange down into delicious juicy-ness and puts it in a cup. Oh man. I started feeling better immediately.\\n\\nAnd the coffee. Ooooh the coffee. Yeah, it probably tasted especially good considering my condition, but it tasted ESPECIALLY good. I don't know why. There was a rich flavor to it that I don't normally notice. I mentioned this, and one of the waiters made sure to come fill me up from the fresh brewed pot as soon as it was ready. Thanks man, holy crap!\\n\\nI started feeling human again. I couldn't decide between a mushroom/cheese hash and a mushroom/cheese omellete. My waitress let me know that the hash has a lot of garlic in it. Which is usually fine, except... warning bells went off in my head (which still hurt, but not as much). DANGER WILL L. She said, and I quote: \\"I like our omelets better because they're... well... perfect.\\" Ooooh. A challenge!\\n\\nWell, she was right. I've never seen an omelet look so pretty. I mean... perfect shape, perfect cheese consistency, perfect ratio of mushrooms to cheese to eggs. I didn't put salt/pepper/anything on it. I ate it as was. It was REALLY FRICKEN GOOD.\\n\\nThey had marionberry jam for my toast. In the words of Dr. Dre: \\"Hell yeah!\\"\\n\\nI ate some of the potato side stuff, typical filler, nothing special there. Tabasco always makes everything like that tasty.\\n\\nAs I walked out into the fresh air, I realized I wasn't in pain anymore. I was actually full and happy. Human again.

The burgers are mediocre, and the customers tend towards Texan douchebags and their accompanying platinum-blonde, stiletto-wearing trophies.\\n\\nMy third trip there was during a Dallas Cowboys game, which distracts most of the douchebag client base, so the restaurant was virtually empty.  I was alone.  The hostess, a short, skinny thing with long black hair and big glasses, looked at me. \\"Two.\\" I looked around, thinking someone may have snuck up behind me. \\"Just one.\\" \\"Two,\\" she repeated. I looked around again, \\"Nope, just one.\\" \\"Two,\\" she repeated again. A puzzled look spread over my face. What the fuck was her problem? \\n\\n\\"You can sit at the bar,\\" she nodded in its general direction. If a quarter of the tables weren't empty, or if they had a line, I would be sitting at the bar, but I generally don't like to sit at the bar. Whatever. I started heading towards the bar. But how would I order? It's counter service. I asked her. She impatiently informed me that the bartender would take my order.\\n\\nThe space itself is pretty cool and slick, with big windows and photographs of musicians lining the walls. But the food? Let's see, first time was so bland I don't remember (although I vaguely recall that you selected your own bun back then); the second time I had the God awful sickeningly sweet tuna burger; and this time I had the Llano Poblano burger. \\n\\nThe bartender asked if I wanted avocado or egg on my burger. No, I ordered a gourmet burger, put together by someone that should know what they're doing, hopefully a chef. If I wanted a Build-your-own burger, that's what I would have ordered. \\"But surely you want some of our wonderful, crispy fries with that?\\" No.  I've tried the fries. They're just fries drizzled with oil and dusted with shredded Parmesan. Who can't do that at home?  And the serving is too big for one person.\\n\\nThey bring the burger out less than five minutes after you order it. Pretty convenient to have all these premade burgers sitting around the kitchen. I wondered how they kept them warm. Tasting the Llano Poblano I suddenly remembered why I couldn't recall what I ate the first time - the burgers are just bland. It was cooked medium, as requested, but it was tasteless. I had to douse the damn thing in ketchup just to get some flavor.\\n\\nI'm clueless as to the popularity of this place, and the only thing I can contribute the high Yelp ratings to are their suaveness at playing social media, like Jinya Ramen and Gaucho Parilla.

With a name like Gus's World Famous, you really can't afford NOT to try it. \\n\\nWalking in, I could tell they were a Southern joint focused on their roots: chicken. The tables were topped with blue checkered clothes, they had eclectic chandeliers around and neon lights. Each table also had their own condiments and paper towel rolls so you know it was going to be finger licking good!\\n\\nSince we were given a daily allowance through our company, we decided to splurge a little. For dinner, I got the Dozen Wing Deal for $17.75 which came with three slices of white bread and two sides. The chicken was REALLY good. Like REALLY good. Super crispy and fried to perfection. The breading wasn't thick at all. I couldn't stop eating! Although I didn't eat the bread, (never really quite got the concept unless you were eating sauce and using it to mop up the sauce), but I chose the potato salad and braised greens as my sides. The greens were nicely cooked with ham, potato salad was a little too tart, probably from the mustard. No worries though, it was all great!\\n\\nOverall, I enjoyed this meal and was glad we stopped.

I've been there. I've taken my team from work there for an appreciation meal. They have a ton of different burgers that are truly excellent and their bar is well stocked. \\n\\nThe thing that isn't on a sign that I could find but that they offer as a service is that they will mix and match the patty from one burger with the fixings from another. Since they have a greek burger with a lamb patty that means I could get an ultra-rich burger with caramelized onions and all sorts of loveliness with a lamb burger patty. That's just lovely.\\n\\nThe second thing to remember is that you're only partly there for the burgers. The other thing you're there for are the parmesan truffle fries. These are very nice and are one of the only fries in Austin that I'll take over Kerbey Lane's Sweet Potato fries. They're come in a nice big paper cone in a wire stand. One order may be enough for 2/3 people, but when I took my team out almost everyone had ordered some before we left.\\n\\nLastly, the finally lose a star because they generally don't take reservations (though I've seen reserved tables there whenever I've tried to reserve a table ahead of time I've been told they can't) and the lines can be ridiculous.

Sadly, She's Not Here is not quite there. \\n\\nFirst, the wait staff insist (repeatedly, to the point of annoyance) that the food is meant to be served family style.  But \\"family style\\" doesn't work when it comes to sushi and sashimi.  Family style works at Buca di Beppo because you get giant bowls of pasta, salad etc. perfect for sharing. But when you're ordering individual pieces of fish or rolls, it doesn't make sense to serve it family style. This is especially true when you're on 2nd street downtown--where you probably don't get many families.  We had 8 people and we all wanted different things, and that \\"family style\\" concept fell flat and seemed forced. \\n\\nSecond, the food itself was pretty good, but definitely overpriced. Go to Uchi happy hour and you can spend 1/2 of what you'd spend at She's Not Here, and get better food.  Drinks were very expensive too. Of the items we tried, the fried crab hand roll was our favorite.  And the Matcha cocktail was good.  \\n\\nThird, the service was subpar, especially considering the price point.  Our waiter was impatient, unaccommodating, and rude.  He was clearly unhappy that we all wanted different things and that wasn't really going with the \\"family style\\" thing they were trying (and failing) to accomplish. But he said it'd be easy to split up the check when everything was done so the 8 of us pushed on, and each ordered individually.  Unfortunately, when the check came it was all together and he would not break it up, so we spent 20 minutes adding up everything and writing down how much to charge each card.  Thanks for going the extra mile, SNH.  It just felt like amateur hour...little things like not doing anything nice for the birthday person even though they knew, or having our sashimi and rolls served before we even had individual plates.  (I guess it's truly \\"family style\\" when everyone has to eat off the same platter!).  Overall the service left us with a bad taste in the mouth that $14 cocktails couldn't cleanse. \\n\\nOverpriced, strangely pretentious and trying to be something it's not. Unless significant changes are made, I give it 6 months."},{"name":"Clay Pit","address":"1601 Guadalupe St","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Yeah, yeah, I know.

In fact, it's one of my favorite places to go on a date. I love that it feels fancy, but at the same time isn't pretentious at all. How do they do that? \\n\\nThe waiters are some of the best in the city, in that, they generally know the menu well, and in fact, are sometimes brutally honest when asked their opinions. I asked our waiter once how he liked a particular signature martini, and he said, \\"I hate it.\\" Bravo to him for giving me his real take when asked for it. Refreshing! Additionally, the waitstaff isn't in your face at all times. They blend into the background while you're enjoying your curry and seem to be available whenever you need them.\\n\\nSpeaking of the curry, I am in love with the Mirch Masala with lamb (spicy and onion-y sweet at the same time?!), and I adore the Mixed Grill kabob as my go-to backup. It's difficult to serve up several different types of meat, grilled, and have each be just as moist and delicious as the next, but Clay Put does it well.\\n\\nMy only complaint lies in the chairs. Yes, a small thing, but some of them are rock-hard, and I don't understand why they can't spring for nicer furniture. It does, however, force me sit straight up instead of slouching my ass back into the seat of the chair.\\n\\nDefinitely make reservations if you are wanting to come in on a Friday or Saturday night, as it can get jam-packed, and the bar area is a bit small."},{"name":"Truva Turkish Kitchen","address":"60 Andrew Young International Blvd NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"This place was so warm and exotic!

The restaurant itself is a little easy to miss, and parking would be a little difficult to find because it's limited. It's highly suggested to find street parking, but since my friends and I went in an hour before they closed, there was parking available by the restaurant. Usually valet is offered. \\n\\nOnce I got in, there were no staff to be found and it took a minute or two until someone came to the front to help me. We were seated at a pretty small booth for the four of us, which felt very crowded even though it ended up being just enough space.\\n\\nWe were given menus and instructed to mark our orders on a small sheet of paper. Once you're ready to put your order in, they have a card on the table to put on a paper holder to indicate you're ready and they also have a card if you have any questions or need anything else, like more water or napkins. Their menu included items such as tacos which are priced at $2.50 each or $7 for three for kinds such as their baja fish, pork belly and chicken. They also have other selections such as fried oyster, curry shrimp, duck or sesame ribeye for $3.50 each or $9.50 for three. Non-taco items which are their small plates (tamales, shrimp ceviche, guacamole, etc.), sides (spicy cucumber salad, chipotle slaw, black bean salad, etc.) which are priced at $3.50 each or $7 for any three, rice bowls, drinks (alcoholic and non-alcoholic) and desserts. The asterik indicates that it contains gluten. \\n\\nWe ended up ordering their guacamole with chips, grilled corn with lime, cayenne, and cotija, spicy cucumber salad, cheese quesadilla, baja fish, veracruz fish, pork belly, chicken, sesame ribeye and fried oyster. \\n\\nPersonally, I tried the grilled corn, spicy cucumber salad, cheese quesadilla, veracruz fish, pork belly, and sesame ribeye. The corn were excellent. Each order comes with one corn on the cob, but cut in half. I'm not usually a big fan of corn, but the cotija and cayenne were a really good mix of taste and the lime gave it a small kick. The spicy cucumber salad threw me off a little because there wasn't much of a spicy taste, more sour and it almost tasted like a type of salad dressing that was thrown and mixed in. The cheese quesadilla is literally one piece and it was a little upsetting because our waitress didn't mention that to us, but it was pretty good. Not sure what kind of sauce was in it, but it was a hint spicy and my friend said it tasted a little almost like curry. I had their veracruz fish, pork belly, and sesame ribeye. The veracruz fish is baked in some sort of seasoning served with slices of peppers, onions, and cilantro. The pork belly were braised/glazed in a sweet brown sauce with chopped onions and cilantro. The sesame ribeye also cooked in a brown sauce served with cilantro. Out of all three, the pork belly would probably be the one I liked most, but the meat wasn't as tender and tasted a little old. The sesame ribeye didn't have much of a sesame flavor and was a little sweet for my taste. And the veracruz was quite salty, mostly from the seasoning. Not sure if it was because it was close to closing, but heard a lot of good reviews for this place and wasn't too excited when leaving. \\n\\nOverall, I'd give three stars because of parking, service, and quality of the food. Willing to go back for another try, and definitely a little earlier."},{"name":"Pier 6 Boston Waterfront","address":"1 8th St","city":"Charlestown","stars":"3.5","text":"Nice location with a view of Boston Harbor.

If you're okay with all this, then be prepared to enter an amazing culinary journey.\\n\\nThe menu changes every month while there are some similar dishes. There's also a chalk board with special dishes, drinks, and desserts. The servers are very kind and will help you decide between dishes and give a great description of the tastes that a list of ingredients can't tell you. \\n\\nThe only reason Barley Swine gets 4 stars is that not every dish is a home run. Yes, the dishes are small so be prepared to eat 3. A friend and I were probably full off of 5 dishes but we ordered 6. You have to place all your orders as once so if you over order then you're SOL. But you can place your dessert order after you have gone through your plates.\\n\\nMy favorites that I had were the foie gras (the grill char brought an amazing taste), the duck breast (cooked perfectly, and also I love duck), and the scallop dish which reminded me that I actually like brussel sprouts. But for every good dish, there was another one that wasn't on par. It would be a tad too salty, or the flavors didn't go together right, or something was missing to give it that WOW factor. \\n\\nBarley Swine is probably on the 'must try' list of Austin, but definitely ask about each dish to make the best decision for your adventure."},{"name":"The Crepevine","address":"249 W State Rd 436","city":"Altamonte Springs","stars":"4.5","text":"Very cool atmosphere with very friendly staff.

They seem to always be booked way in advance so book early if you want to try the place.  La Quercia has been ranked as one of the top 100 restaurants in Canada and it's usually featured as one of the best 25 restaurants in Vancouver, according to Scout Magazine.  \\n\\nThe first time we went we had their tasting menu, which was unbelievable.  This time I don't think they were offering it which was disappointing.  I'm thinking they might just do it for groups of six or more.  \\n\\nWe both started with the Cured Meats.  Delicious.  They offered seven different kinds of meat, along with their fresh bread.  It also cake with asparagus and egg, plus pickled tomatoes.  We also shared their Broccoli as a starter.  It came with a subtle mushroom sauce.  \\n\\nFor the main dish I ordered the Roasted Chicken.  It came with chanterelle mushrooms on top of the chicken and celeriac pave as the side.  I've never had celeriac pave before and it was so good.  It's celery and potatoes that are thinly sliced, with some cream.  The top was golden brown.  Despite the plate being really good, I wish the chicken portion was a tad smaller.  I also would've liked some greens or something to be included in the plate.  I was so stuffed after eating it that I didn't have room for dessert, although some raisins were given with the bill.  I love having little treats as a thank you.  \\n\\nIt's a small team at La Quercia.  You can just tell that there's so much passion for Italian food with the staff.  The dinner was around 90 minutes, although they always reserve two hours for each guest.  \\n\\nMy entire meal was $70 for the main dish plus the two-shared plates.  Service was 3.5.  Food was 3.5.

The falafels are good, but I couldn't stand the cabbage.  I usually love anything pickled, but I found the cabbage to be inedible.  Two other people in our group agreed.  It was way too salty and it just had a yucky taste.  The hummus is great.\\n\\nMy boyfriend liked his shwarma pita.  Another in our group ordered a custom prepared wrap that was about as big as my car.  Another ordered a custom made falafel bowl.  They all enjoyed their food.\\n\\nI'm getting old, so I'm not really into out of control crowds.  People have to hover over tables in hopes that someone will be leaving.

When he walked back to our side, my friend asked about the lemonade.  I was ready to order and asked for one of the burgers in the menu.  He refused, telling us to order an alcoholic beverage instead.  His demeanor was neither welcoming or courteous.  From the interaction, one can assume that he probably hated his job.

I've been here so many times now (and the one in Kits) that I've filled out at least 3 punch cards. My preference is a lighter soup, still packed with so much flavour and thick noodles. The chashu slices are soft and melts in your mouth. I also almost always order the gyoza on the side, which is also amazing here. \\n\\nThe only downside is the extremely long lines during peak hours, I've probably waited over an hour before.

I got a recommendation from one of our customers a few months ago and finally had a chance to check it out.  Wifey, son, and me.  A family dinner for a party of 3 Koreans at an Ethiopian restaurant.. nice.\\n\\nLike most of the other reviews here, I give the Fish Tibs and Lamb Tibs a friendly high 5.  We were the only asians in the restaurant and the server didn't make us feel all that welcome.  Felt more forced than anything.. a lil more about that later.  I let the waiter know we were happy to be there and in my enthusiastic way I let her know that we were excited to try whatever they recommended.  She suggested the fish tibs which we ordered and of course me loving lamb as i do, we ordered the lamb tibs which were also fantastic.  \\n\\nOur orders included spongy bread aka Injera which you tear off pieces off, get some of your meat, and mix in with some sweetly seasoned lettuce (tastes like Italian dressing).  Would have been nice if the server taught us newbies a bit better how to do it like the Ethiopians did it, but she just kind of expected us to know how to do it.  We didn't have too much problem figuring our own way of doing it. \\n\\nLocation was a bit tricky to find, as after my navigation said \\"You have reached your destination\\" we saw another Ethiopian restaurant with kind of a similar name.  We made a right turn only to find another ethiopian restaurant on the right (opposite) side and I nearly got into an accident trying to figure out where Desta was.  Readers, please note there are THREE Ethiopian restaurants on the same corner 1/8th mile radius.  Parking wasn't bad, but space was pretty tight.  We had a hard time finding a spot comfortable for our baby, but we were able to make do.\\n\\nWe didn't stay for dessert, but overall we were happy with our meal (food anyways).  Service is what prevented me giving this place a 5 star.

I've tried both the cheese plate and the meatballs for appetizers and neither have been disapponting. My Italian grandmother would give a thumbs up to the meatballs and the little kick in the sauce which I also found in one of my favorite dishes, the penne arrabiata.

It's slightly spicy but nothing too terrible, and with a side of potato pancakes, it's perfection on a plate.\\n\\nWhich leaves me with dessert, and though it's not a popular opinion I'm going to go out on a limb and call the creme puffs over-rated.

Waffles and pop tarts...and beer? And... coffee mojitos? Well, it works. Whatever is going on here, it works fabulously. They serve Stumptown Coffee, which as someone from the Northwest, I totally appreciate. They also brew coffee correctly. There is not a hint of bitterness or overcooked milk going on here. The iPad ordering screens are mostly cool, (although they need more options for customization) and the million different types of seating, (couches, pillows, swings, big chairs, little chairs, bar seating, regular tables) is both delightful and refreshing.

They had a pretty big bar area with plenty of bar seating. No line or rush so we got seated right away at a booth. \\n\\nThe menu is fairly small and not overwhelming to look at. I ordered our server's recommendation of the Bison Patty Burger that comes with roasted pablano, cheddar, avocado, red onions, and spicy mayo with a choice of a side.

Definitely not the medium I ordered so it threw me off, and it wasn't that good...

I was also very surprised that it took 30 minutes for the food to come out.

On the upside, the brussel sprouts were good. \\n\\nOverall, not a huge fan. Service was good. Nothing over the top but she was nice. I also think their menu is priced a little too high. There's also a price discrepancy: as of now, the bison burger is priced $12 on their online menu and $14 on their dine-in restaurant menu. There's actually a couple more. I guess they did a price increase and haven't updated their website yet. \\n\\nI'd give this place a 2.5. Not too sure if I'd come visit it again, but they did have a pretty cool looking bar.

At my suggestion, my date went with the daily special, a savory-sounding barbecued chicken and spicy red cabbage on toasted nine grain bread. Smart man, because it was one superlative sandwich! Just the right amount of barbecue sauce on tender, still-warm chicken, peppery and ice-cold coleslaw, it was a mouthwatering combo. \\n\\nI picked the \\"Mohawk Stroller\\", cause I'm a sucker for local pride and cutely-titled menu items. They were out of the herb and cheddar roll, and the alfalfa sprouts, but my mind was made so I subbed in some nine grain. I'm glad I was determined, because the end result was simply delicious. There was a thick layer of zesty basil pesto on both slices of bread, piles of smoked turkey, and fantastic roasted red peppers that I immediately declared a new addition to my kitchen. It was nearly as filling and flavorful as my husband's stellar sandwich, which is no easy feat.\\n\\nWe sampled a couple of sides, the greek pasta and macaroni salads, and they were decent but mediocre. I'd skip the bag of chips next time as well, it adds a lot to your total and not much to the meal.

Fortunately the creme filling wasn't too vast.\\n\\n-RASPBERRY CAKE: if you like pink, this is the prettiest donut to snap pics of, but for crying out loud, please no selfies with it! It's a well executed donut that includes a touch of pistachios on top.\\n\\nI enjoyed them all while we sat on stools at the counter facing the window.  The staff was helpful and conversational.

The staff were too busy chatting and laughing with each other to notice; even when we poured some tea on the table and cleaned it with napkins, they never offered to come over to see what was wrong or clean (I am not sure if they ignored the issue or if they were too busy chatting with each other).\\n\\nAfter cleaning we took a look at hte menu. We had to flag down a waitress to order; we ordered two bowls of soup and Vietnamese coffee.\\n\\nWhile we were waiting for food, I noticed that they a) didn't help any other diners, b) spent the entire time talking to each other with their backs to customers. Again, I don't expect a fine dining experience but do your freaking job!\\n\\nOur food arrived and it was actually pretty decent. Unfortunately the coffee didn't arrive until after we were done our food (we had to remind the waitress about our coffee, instead of making the coffee while the soup was being done, she was busy chatting...laughing with her friends).\\n\\nIt made my blood boil.

It was seasoned to be somewhat spicy, the seasoning tastes like gochujang, a Korean spicy paste.

It's made freshly everyday by the chef who doesn't share his recipe with anyone else. I can see why people would order loaves of it to-go. Dipping it in freshly grated parmazan and olive oil tops my list of bread baskets in italian eateries. The waiter was nice enough to pack half a loaf to-go for me, which I promptly murdered later that night.\\n\\nI highly recommend local Austinites to try it out, support a nice independent place instead of chains.

This was my favorite meal in Texas on a recent trip to Austin and San Antonio. After returning from my trip, I gushed to friends about Gus's perfectly seasoned and extremely moist fried chicken and am SO sad that there isn't a comparable spot in the bay area.\\n\\nMy friend and I came here around 5:30 on Saturday and had to wait a couple minutes for a table. It didn't get super crowded at any point in the evening, which was surprising to me given how popular it seems to be (or maybe I'm just too used to SF lines...lol).\\n\\nI'll be the first to admit that I cannot handle any level of spiciness in my food, and as much as I love fried chicken, I was worried by the \\"Hot & Spicy\\" part of the full restaurant name \\"Gus's World Famous Hot & Spicy Fried Chicken\\". \\n\\nI opted to play it safe and went with their 2 piece dark combo set. For $6.75, you get one thigh and one leg piece along with baked beans, slaw, and white bread. My friend went with the 3 piece dark for $7.95 (two thighs and one leg).\\n\\nOur food came out shortly and I started with the leg piece. Upon my first bite, I was amazed by how much moisture they managed to pack into just that one bite. By far the most moist fried chicken (or any type of chicken) I've ever had! The flavoring was right on too, as it was neither too salty or bland. \\n\\nAs I continued eating, there was a small burn in my mouth due to the spice, but I was so engrossed in the food that I simply didn't care. There aren't too many dishes that make me feel that way! I had to stop once in a while to let the fire in my mouth die down a little bit, but it was never so spicy that I couldn't continue after a break.\\n\\nI enjoyed the leg and thigh so much that I ended up ordering a 3rd leg piece. Even as I write this review, my mouth is starting to water from my memories of that moist and tender fried chicken...\\n\\nI also ordered a half sweet, half unsweet tea (hey when you're in the South...) and loved that it came with a Gus's souvenir cup. \\n\\nAnd one of the best parts of the meal was the price...my friend and I each had 3 pieces of chicken and only paid $25 after tax and tip! Definitely wouldn't be able to get such delicious fried chicken for such a steal in the bay area.\\n\\nParking in this area is all on the street.

Their spice levels are \\"hot\\", \\"hotter,\\" and \\"hotterest.\\" Yes, \\"hotterest.\\" So you know this place has a sense of humor which is quite tricky for a restaurant to do. I chose the F-bomb which involves dropping a shot of plum wine into sake. The waitress came by with the chopsticks and shot glass, set it up for me, and along with another waitress and the BF, the four of us banged on the table \\"yelling\\" F-bomb. We didn't actually yell...but it was fun. And the drink is funky! Although in retrospect I would have gone for the Julep gone Asian drink.\\n\\nFood is awesome and they really have quite the range of fusion fare. There's one section that reads \\"buns baos rolls wraps + a taco.\\" We did in fact get a bun-braised pork belly bun. It was as tasty and decadent as it sounds but had the usual problems associated with pork belly...namely the fat is hard to cut through so your bites may not be super clean.\\n\\nWinner of the evening was by far the wok-charred octopus with grilled corn. I loved every bit of this plate. The octopus was charred just so-enough to give the taste more dimension while conserving the octopus flavor. The texture was fantastic-too often I order octopus and regret it because it's been cooked in such a way that makes it hard to chew. Not here-the octopus was perfect with the grilled scallions and heavy cilantro flavoring.\\n\\nStaff was super friendly and they seem excited to work there. They brought us some raspberry pina colada samples to start and throughout the evening were just great. As we walked out everyone said bye to us which really seals the deal. The decor is funky-fierce with bright red dragons and tigers. I wasn't a giant fan of the rice milk panna cotta but it was by far the giggliest panna cotta I have ever seen. Still, it's not a deterrent I'm definitely coming back to try even more of the food and some of the other desserts.

My husband and I both had the bacon cheeseburger and it absolutely melts in your mouth. The quality of the meat along with the juiciness and the flavor is amazing!  To top it off, the bun is so soft and melds with the patty perfectly. The cheese is melty and the lettuce, tomato, onion, and pickles are cold and fresh. The bacon was crispy and smoky. It was PERFECT. Now for the fries...  also awesome!  Crispy, salty, and crinkle cut and the shake sauce is so yummy with them.  We are fans of the entire experience and quality and will be frequenting this place. \\n\\nOn top of having delicious food, the service was great and everyone was friendly.

I was pretty pumped up from all the positive Yelp reviews and I'm glad to say that I wasn't disappointed! The decor was unpretentious and unassuming, and I liked the colorful decals on the windows. My friends and I got to sit at a table near the all-glass front by a friendly waiter who was patient and gracious when my friends and I were scrambling to figure out what to order.\\n\\nIn the end we decided on the pork belly buns, tea-smoked pork spare ribs, wok-roasted mussels, and the wok-charred udon noodles. We ordered all our dishes to share. Everything was great -- my favorites were the pork belly buns and the mussels. We also got a free drink from the bar. I forgot what exactly it was, but it tasted like a combination of lychee, coconut, and something else. It wasn't terribly good and the texture was actually kind of gritty and dry, but it was a nice gesture. I would have liked the portions to be bigger for the price that we paid for the food, but it was a pretty good experience overall."},{"name":"bartaco","address":"969 Marietta St NW","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"I came here for a friend's birthday because this is one of her favorite restaurants. So for that I put on a good face but THE MASK COMES OFF NOW PEOPLE.\\nFirst off, the ordering process. Everyone gets a long card and pencil to check off the items they want to order. You put your name on it, fill it out, and then out it on the stand for the server to pick up. I felt like I was filling out a score card at a mini golf course. After we all finished the server read out all our orders to verify they were correct (which is chaotic when you have a large group of people). If the order is read out again to verify after I filled it out then why can't orders be taken in a normal fashion? \\nSecond, the prices. At first $2.50 for a taco and $3.50 for a specialty taco doesn't sound bad. However when someone in my party asked how big the tacos were the server replied the tacos were \\"2-3 bite tacos and the restaurant recommends 4-6 tacos per person.\\" As I stated in previous reviews, YA GIRL CAN EAT so I'd definitely be on the higher end of that spectrum. WHY would I pay for 6 tacos to get full?? That's a pretty significant chunk of change. Actually it's a significant chunk of credit card as this is a cashless restaurant.\\nThird, the serving of the food. When the tacos did come out, they were not plated for each order. They were plated with like tacos. For example, I ordered a baja fish, pork belly, and sesame ribeye however when they arrived there was a tray with 4 baja fish, a tray with my sesame ribeye and 3 other tacos, and a tray with 2 pork belly and 2 other tacos. Then they brought us all individual trays so we could all grab our tacos off the tray ourselves. I don't know about you but if I wanted other people's hands near my food I would take my lunch to a preschool show and tell.\\nFourth, the taste. The food was good, not going to lie. But that's all it was, good. Not great, not life changing, just good. Definitely not worth the price tag. One thing I paid for that was worth it was the Spiced Chocolate Pudding. It was fantastic, like christmas in a jar. \\nIn short, prepare your credit cards for a big ole swipe if you want to get full here and order the spiced chocolate pudding.\\n\\n\\nHey fam!

I will start out with the positive things.   I tried the sesame chicken at lunch which is made with dark meat.  The teriyaki chicken is made with white meat.

The lettuce was good quality.  Almost every other Japanese steakhouse in Columbus serves iceberg.\\nNow the negative part.  I got white rice which was the worse white rice in town.  It tasted like minute rice, I think it was old.  They served veggies with the chicken which most of the steakhouses in town only do during dinner.   Unfortunately they were overcooked and tasted burnt.  The place was freezing and the manager had to help the only waitress that worked there.  I just read another review here that said something about sauces.  My table did not get any dipping sauces and I didn't see anyone at other tables served them.

I explained that I had never been there before, but read some reviews and had to see for myself what the all the commotion was.\\n\\nSome of the items were sitting in the open air above the bakery case.  I thought that was weird, especially considering it's flu season.  I requested any gluten free items, and was initially told that the only GF item was a sort of peanut fudge treat in the refrigerator.  But knowing how GF foods look (a little darker, flatter and heavier than those made with a rising yeast) I questioned the flax-oat cookie.  Turns out it was made with spelt flour, a grain that I substitute for wheat.  I purchased one of those (for $1.75) and a bag of ginger, pecan granola (for $5.75/lb).    The cookie was pretty bland.  I could taste the nuttiness, either from the flax-spelt combo, or added peanut butter.  There was a slight sweetness pulled from the raisins, but otherwise it was dull.\\n\\nThe granola on the other hand was awesome!  I love granola and eat way too much of it.  I hate what I get a bag that contains mostly rolled oats that have been minimally baked.  This batch was cooked for the right amount of time and at the right temperature to give it the perfect crunch. The real pieces of crystallized ginger adds a nice, spicy touch.  \\n\\nYou can place an order in advance.

The bun is a little lost in everything, mostly being a vehicle for the pork to get into your mouth without the use of a fork.\\n\\nMy wife stresses, though, that you eat it with the papaya peanut salad. The vinegary bite from the salad cuts some of the sameness of the sandwich. Go back and forth with a fork or plop it on the sandwich, but the two pair extremely well together.

We wanted to try something different for a change (since we're big fans of Matt Murphy's pub)... it was switch up time.\\n\\nWe walked a few steps down the street and picked Orinoco on a whim.

We were really hankering for a mojito, but apparently, they aren't served at this location (am I mistaken??)  Regardless, the ingredients didn't appear to be behind the bar and we did ask the bartender (who was also the only server in the joint) and he said no.  We opted for the sangria... which was pre-made and served out of a huge Rubbermaid bucket.  If we had known we were getting Bucket'ria, we would have went for a glass of vino first.  We did drink our sangria, but ordered a glass of wine afterwards.  The sangria just didn't do it for us.\\n\\nTo start, we ordered the bacon wrapped dates, which were the bomb.

Went for lunch with my husband on a Sunday afternoon. We got there about 12:35p and we put our drink and food order in when we were acknowledged (a little slow). My husband got a draft beer- cold, delicious, and best draft he's gotten in awhile. We ordered a cup of clam chowder, fish tacos, and fish sandwich. The clam chowder came out almost immediately and it was delicious. \\n\\nWe sat at the bar so we were watching football and it just felt like we had been waiting awhile for our food, so I checked the time and it was 1:15p. I looked at the tab and noticed that there was only the beer and the clam chowder on the tab. A group next to us had just gotten their food (they were there before us) so I was thinking, \\"Ok, they are just a little backed up today\\". Then I see a couple across from us who came about 30 minutes after us get their food. I asked the bartender if we could get an update because at this point it was 1:30 and we still haven't gotten our meals yet. He came back to tell us that the kitchen was backed up and they got a lot of orders all at once and ours should be coming right out. He then updated our tab ticket to show the food we ordered. I don't know about the lounge area, but when we put our order in at the bar there weren't that many people. It started to get busy about 30-40 minutes after we arrived. There was also a party of two next to us who put their order in well after ours and got theirs as well. Are you trying to tell me that the kitchen was backed up over an order of fish tacos and a fried fish sandwich?? I would have felt better about the experience if the bartender just told us that he forgot to put our food in rather than blame the kitchen. We finally got our food just over an hour of placing our order.\\n\\nThe food: The clam chowder was delicious. It was creamy and had a nice added touch of sliced scallions on top. Husband thinks it could have used a little salt and pepper, but I thought it was  perfect. The fish tacos were good- a lot of lettuce, not much pico de gallo, reasonable amount of fish, tasty sauce. My husband was satisfied. The fried fish sandwich was not as crispy as I would have liked (they must have put the bun on top immediately after coming out of the fryer making it a little soggy), and there was no flavor to the batter. The bun was good and the tartar sauce was amazing. The fries were a little too done for my liking. \\n\\nThe service: A little slow at first, but the bartenders were nice enough.

I love the North End, and as much as I'd love to give it a five star review, I simply can't.  The reason? Because yuppie scum, and worthless college students are moving in by the droves. These people have no sense of community, they offer nothing; all they do is drive up real estate prices, push out families that have been living there for generations, look down on the locals, and generally make a mess. If it wasn't for these people, the North End would get 5 stars from me hands down. It's one of the greatest, and safest neighborhoods in Boston, so long as you don't cause any trouble, and avoid the drunk idiot college students. \\n\\nOn an unrelated note, I know everyone always seems to go crazy for Mike's, but I've always preferred Modern Pastry."},{"name":"360 Pizza","address":"6203 N Capital Of Texas Hwy, Ste A100","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"The yelp reviews were definitely helpful in us choosing to dine here.

Really a shame there is virtually nowhere downtown to get decent chinese, but this place makes up for it.  Picked my food up and the staff was fast, friendly and the place seemed really clean.  The dinner combo is a steal for $8.25.  TONS of food and their pork fried rice is THANKFULLY not all greasy and nasty.  The pork seems lean and there are tons of veggies in it.  We went with the Mongolian beef and the sesame chicken.  Both were very good.  We also got some teriyaki beef (the kind that comes on a stick) and wish we'd doubled the order.  Very tasty and we scarfed the four (large) strips of meat down in about 1 minute!  LOL  The egg rolls are OK but I think next time I'll try a spring roll instead (the combo is 1 dish, lots of pork fried rice, and an egg roll that can be subbed out for a spring roll).

Since moving from Florida 5 years ago, being at Bartaco was probably the closest I have felt to the beach in Atlanta. \\n\\nService was quick. You put up a laminated card when you are ready to order. They confused our food so it took a while for the kitchen to cook our items, but the staff were really helpful and took the items off our bill.\\n\\nThe guacamole is the bomb. I am a guac snob and think this might be my favorite in the city. It is perfectly creamy and chunky, and has a strong lime flavor which I like. IN terms of entree, the Baja taco was my favorite. The Baja is fried fish, while the Veracruz is baked. My coworker said the Veracruz was just OK, but she was a huge fan of the chorizo taco. The falafel was good and spicy, while the chicken taco was just OK- kind of bland. \\n\\nOverall, I think this is a good place for happy hour after work.

It's a great, healthy alternative to grabbing a burger for lunch or a burrito (and I love me some burgers and burritos). A salad is a good way to fill your stomach back up in the middle of a workday that won't put you in an afternoon slouch.\\n\\nLocated on E. Central Blvd downtown, it's a pretty convenient location next to Lake Eola. Since it's downtown, your experience with parking will vary depending upon if you have free parking somewhere or if you're willing to pay for a meter or garage. The decor is nothing special, but it doesn't really need to be. It's simple, and that's that. \\n\\nThey make your salad right in front of you as you order. You can go with one of the salads on the menu, or you can tweak it around to fit your taste buds. They're very flexible. I usually go with the Athena salad because I'm a sucker for Greek influenced dishes, but I've also heard many good things about the Desperado. I'm going to give that one a go one of these days.\\n\\nThe ingredients are fresh and ripe. I've never seen any wilted lettuce or bad veggies in my salads here. You can also add a protein if you want. The lemon pepper chicken is a good addition to the Athena salad. The staff is very patient when explaining your options. I've never felt like I'm being rushed when I've got questions. A+ for that.\\n\\nThe prices are totally fair. I have to point out that they're big on portions. They're not kidding when they offer \\"big\\" salads. The first time I came here,  I ordered a \\"big\\" sized salad and had enough leftover for two more meals. If you're planning meals ahead of time, I say go for it. If you just want a quick lunch, go with a \\"small\\" salad. It's more than enough to quell your hunger at lunchtime but still leaves room for dinner at night.\\n\\nEden's is also vegan friendly, so if you want to do lunch (or dinner) with a vegan friend, Eden's is a great option. \\n\\nI've been here several times now, and I can't really find anything negative to say about it.

So I ordered the magic shroom burger, by recommendation of the group, and I got a small order a fries and water.\\n\\nFirst off, I'd like to say the caramel sea salt shake is pretty damn great. Until you get to the possibly salty bottom. That was salty. The magic shroom burger was on a buttery bun, big patty of medium well meat, mushrooms, lettuce, goat cheese. It was good to say the least, but the buttery buns were kinda gross to pick up.The fries are similar to Highball/Alamo Drafthouse, and they are crunchy and salty as can be. I love salt, but it was hard to handle without the reverse osmosis water. The burger was about $9, and the fries 2.25, and then tax. Shakes are $5. So if you're looking for a cheap value, this is not the place. \\n\\nMy problem with this place is that they feature strange gourmet-like burgers and food items.

I have intended to eat at La Quercia several times over the past two years. One time we wanted to have a birthday dinner there for a friend but the small space could not accommodate our numbers. Another time I tried to walk in off the street with my aunt and they were fully booked for the night. As soon as January rolled around, and I began thinking about Valentine's Day plans, I decided to book a table at La Quercia, more than a month in advance. Nothing would thwart my efforts this time!\\n\\nOur dinner here was incredible. While La Quercia does offer a small a la carte menu, the servers (and chefs) encourage adventurous diners to opt for their familia set menu. This is $50 per person and consists of seven shared courses, based on items that are fresh in the markets and in the kitchen. Before I describe what we had, I should mention two things I noticed about the restaurant. First, the kitchen is jam-packed with chefs. For a restaurant that only seats thirty people, they had four chefs, a dishwasher, and an expediter. Second, the service was outstanding. I can't stand the austerity of staff members at many fine dining establishments. The price of dishes should not alter a server's personality, nor burden the customer with behavioural expectations or forced formality. The serving staff at La Quercia were faultlessly attentive without being intrusive, and they came across as being both relaxed and extremely proud of what they were serving.\\n\\nNow down to the nitty-gritty!\\n\\nOur first dish was Trout Three Ways, which consisted of trout mousse along with an in-house smoked and cured version of the fish. This was served with celeriac slaw, wholegrain mustard, and watercress. I liked the sashimi-like texture of the cured trout while my partner favoured the subtlety of the smoked version. The mousse was great with the baguette that came with this starter.\\n\\nOur second dish was a rich, perfectly baked Parmigiano-Reggiano souffle. This would have been great on a large bed of greens, but it only came on a token bed of arugula that could not support the piquant richness of the cheesy sformato. Good thing we had some of that thinly-sliced baguette left!\\n\\nOur third dish was a polenta gnocchi dish with a braised rabbit and white bean ragu. My girlfriend found this dish too \\"slippery\\", but I thought that the density of the gnocchi and beans perfectly absorbed the gaminess of the rabbit. I definitely would not want a bowl of this to myself, however.\\n\\nOur fourth dish was a handmade lumache all'amatriciana, a pasta with smoked pork cheek and a light tomato sauce. This dish almost had a palate-cleansing effect after the pungent gnocchi.\\n\\nOur fifth dish was pork belly with homemade headcheese and roasted vegetables with a herb aioli. My girlfriend hadn't tried either of these pork-based \\"delicacies\\", and we definitely both liked the former more than the latter. Headcheese is just not easy to appreciate or wrap your...head...around when considering the ingredients and preparation. \\n\\nOur sixth dish was lamb shoulder with roasted cauliflower and hazelnuts. The cauliflower was cooked in a pleasantly sweet balsamic sauce, which also contained raisins. At first I was a bit disturbed by the raisins considering the garlic and herb foundation of the lamb and cauliflower, but they really complimented the lamb and were a natural match for the hazelnuts.\\n\\nOur final dish was a chilled panna cotta with raisins and hazelnut streusel. We were both struggling at this point, but panna cotta acts in a similar way to a mild cheese or creme caramel in that it's soft, fairly easy to digest, and neutral-tasting...which is a nice way to end a big and bold dinner!"},{"name":"Santarpio's Pizza","address":"111 Chelsea St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"As for the food, it seems to be a bit hit or miss.

This most recent time, the pizza was burnt and the crust was hard as a rock. I've also picked up takeout from Santarpio's and the whole pizza was a soggy mess after 15 minutes.\\n\\nAnd as for service, I appreciate the laid-back divey atmosphere, but maybe I just don't \\"get\\" the whole rude waitstaff shtick? \\n\\nSo, yeah, I'll probably be back.

I don't know if this place knows what it wants to be. It seems like a lot of the seating is gone which may be a good thing because I cannot imagine this place being super busy and the waitstaff being able to keep up. Although pleasant, the waitstaff is poorly, poorly trained. We were greeted with a kind mumble and sat at a table and there we stayed as it was unclear if we get up to order at the counter or wait (for a long, long time) to have someone finally come back to the table to actually take an order. We just sort of sat at our table for 10 minutes before I had to get up and ask for drinks. There were 5 other people (4 at the bar watching the soccer game) and one other person at a single table in the entire place so it isn't like the place was busy at all. The person that mumble greeted us sort of gestured that he understood that we wanted drinks but seemed unsure of what he was supposed to do about it. After we told him what we would like he disappeared for a very, very, very long time and then came back with 3 iced teas. The tea was delicious so maybe he had to brew it in a special way that takes forever or something. It was good but not worth waiting so long for. A person I was with sucked his tea down and we had to track down our waiter (during our long wait to get our food order taken)  to get another one. He brought one out, eventually, in brand new glass, leaving the empty glass, which isn't too big of a deal but I might recommend a pitcher of tea being brought out to the table and poured into the existing glass to speed up service... It was just a weird and long amount of time to wait for tea. I can't imagine this place being busy and dealing with basic drinks that way. Anyway, after that, our waiter just disappeared again. No one asking if we had questions about the menu or anyone asking if we were interested in eating at all, which we were. So, finally after getting back up and asking if we should order food at the counter or what our waiter said he would come to the table. He came, eventually and  just stood there. I don't expect a show or anything but some kind of general conversation of \\"Hey, what would y'all like to eat?\\" or \\"What can I get you?\\" usually happens when I order at a restaurant. He just seemed rather lost and unsure of what he was doing. \\n\\nSo, after a very, very long time, our food (which consisted of one burger, one order of fries, 2 sandwiches and two bowls of soup) started to trickle out. First the fries, then a bowl of soup and then another bowl. I guess these were supposed to be appetizers and not served with our sandwiches/burger(??) because it wasn't until about 7 minutes later that the burger came out, then a sandwich then another sandwich. The food was served staggered. The timing was just off and weird. I had the cranberry chicken sandwich which was very good. The tortilla soup and potato soup were okay. The burger was good but the fries were a little soggy. I suspect the fries were sitting somewhere for awhile before our waiter managed to get them to the table. \\n\\nIts too bad. Such a great location and it could be such a great place but sadly, I do not see this place making it. I hate to say it. I hope they can turn it around.

It seems like that kind of place you'd go to if you were hungry and you just decided to go into some random place because you'd never been there before. I had the chicken tenders for an appetizer which were good but average at the same time, and then for my entr√©e I had a turkey burger with sweet potato fries. The turkey burger was fine, but the sweet potato stood out more in terms of flavor. I went with 3 other people so I was able to try a nibble of the crab cake (meh), the steak tips (delicious!), and the turkey tips risotto (risotto was fantastic but apparently the turkey was too dry).

The guacamole is AMAZING, as are the mojitos. I also had two chicken tacos that were very good, but a bit on the spicy side for my own tastes. Overall, I had a great time and loved the food. Service was good, but I felt like we were \\"left on our own\\" for a bit when we needed more water or the check. Apparently there is some sort of system there, though, where you place a card in a stand on the table to signal the waitress, so perhaps the slow service was partially our own fault!\\n\\nOk, now a side note about the parking situation. I pulled up to Bartaco and when I realized it was a valet only parking situation, I decided to venture out on my own to find parking in a lot nearby. I parked in the public parking lot right behind the restaurant and paid for 2 hour parking. This seemed sufficient for a Sunday afternoon lunch with some friends. Well, our lunch ran a bit later than I anticipated -- in part to it taking a while to get our check and split it 5 ways -- but by the time I made it back to my car to go home, I had been booted. I checked my watch and yes I admit it was about 45 minutes past my 2 hour limit, but I got extremely annoyed that I had to now deal with removing the boots from my car and paying $75 to do so. This is one thing I just hate about going to lunch/dinner in Midtown because you have to worry about things like this. I paid for my meal at Bartaco and tipped very well, so the fact that I then had to pay $75 because our meal ran a little late was not cool.

A big part of a dining experience is how you are received by waitstaff, and this was not a good evening.\\n\\nThe food was good, as it always is. But the service was terrible. The waiter couldn't have been less interested in us. My children very politely asked him questions, and he literally just stared at them and didn't respond.

But no, it was actually a restaurant, which I actually knew because I was told so.  \\"Burger Boutique\\" was the subtitle of the restaurant, and I thought this was interesting, as I gathered that I might be able to get a haircut or a nice suit here or something.  Fortunately, or unfortunately, however you want to see it, you could only buy burgers and sandwiches here.  This was what I came here for, so I can't complain about the lack of fashionable doo-dads.  The sign was also weird, as I thought the place was called Trib Flip, but the \\"Trib\\" part was just flip flipped upwards.  My mistake.\\n\\nSo I got there and I ordered the Philly.  There were a lot of different choices but I went with something familiar, because I like cheese and onions.  Some people don't, but I do.  I've got no beef with onions.  But this burger had beef with onions, cause it was a burger. I can't fault it for that.  And it was pretty tasty.  The burger was very small, but it was actually very tasty.  It didn't actually have any cheese on it as I would expect a Philly to have, but it had a mayonnaise-esque sauce with a bit of extra spicy zest.  I can't complain, though I can't say my taste buds were exactly bursting with excitement.  \\n\\nThe atmosphere of the place fit the bill of being a boutique.  I was bombarded what I figured was some sort of trendy house music.  It had a pulsing bass and I would have tapped my foot if I actually enjoyed that type of music.  But I don't.

Top that with a lavender mocha and I was sold immediately. \\n\\nI finally made it here yesterday for Canada Day and was glad that I showed up early before the restaurant opened. There were already people in line, and many more came after me. We were all quickly seated, which was fabulous due to the weather. \\n\\nI tried the milk chocolate lavender mocha and was very pleased that they had soy milk to offer. It came out with lots of froth and a pretty leaf pattern created. The lavender is nice and subtle but I can understand fellow dinners wishing more of a presence of it. My dining partner's regular mocha came with a heart pattern in the froth and so we ooo'd and ahhh'd for a bit. \\n\\nWe decided that we wanted to try the famous waffles but still wanted a 'proper' breakfast. We decided to share a waffle with the caramel raspberry sauce and it was perfect. They gave us two smaller waffles so it was easy to share and there was tons of sauce. We probably didn't get through half of it and I was scooping it on at the end. The outside of the waffle was very crispy and the inside was super hot and melted in my mouth. Delightful! \\n\\nFor a main course, we got the Les Boulettes and the Fricassee. Heaven. Absolute heaven. \\nThe meatballs in the Les Boulettes are made from beef and lamb and were perfectly seasoned. They held their shape and were topped with super thin slices of lemon. Yummm. The tomato sauce went wonderfully with everything and the cherry tomatoes, olives, and cilantro made perfect garnishes. My eggs were cooked to a perfect medium and the grilled foccaccia assisted in sopping up any sauce. The cucumber salad and hummus provided a lighter taste to the dish and overall, it was so good that I would settle for meatballs for every breakfast. \\nThe Fricassee definitely also lived up to all of the reviews. The short ribs were in a delicious sauce and were super tender. The cheese had a nice kick to it and the arugula provided a nice peppery taste. \\n\\nFrom the dishes, to the decor, to the wonderful servers, breakfast at Cafe Medina is a definitely must. One note: ensure all of your party is with you as you won't be seated until they are. But to kill time, there's a cute kitchen shop across the street and seats are available outside for you to wait.

It's an order for wings at a wing house and a roast beef sandwich, basically.\\n\\n45 minutes after we ordered, starving hungry and with nothing brought to munch on, we finally saw our server again.

Yes, I know - there have been plenty of places with sports themes, memorabilia, and vibe - but places where each seat is a guaranteed decent chance of seeing the game on a good screen - that's a more recent phenominon......once Game On opened and CnF went through a reno across the street... then finally everyone realized flat screens are cheap, and other places followed suit.\\n\\nIn Porter, until recently, all there was to watch the game was Spirit - and everyone knew it, so you had to get there well before a big game to get a seat.  Now Tavern opened, and it's a great space.  TVs are everywhere, and every seat at every table has a good chance of catching the game.  I also dig their long bar and the fact that it only ever really feels packed on the weekends.\\n\\nBut it gets 3-stars, because you need more than a bunch of TVs to really wow me.  First the food - the menu is expansive, and full of really mediocre options.  every dish I have tried has been a large portion of crap - and at $11 a burger, you need to do it right.  Beer, too was retardly expensive.  3 burgers, 1 salad, 1 app, and a couple of beers each ran us $40 a head.  I know the economy is in the tank, but $6 a bottle of beer is just way above average.\\n\\nSecond, their lighting and music is enough to start seizures.  Last night luckily they had the sound of the Sox game on, so the DJ wasn't spinning random loud music - but the lights would go bright, then dim, then flicker - come on guys, pay the electrician to fix that with my beer money, at least.\\n\\nSo in a pinch, this place will fit the bill to grab a seat and a few beers - but when a bunch of us want to hang out for the whole game and not go poor in the process, we will head elsewhere - because finally other places have gone the plasma way as well"},{"name":"Sinha Brazilian Steak House","address":"13586 Village Park Dr","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"I went here for my birthday very sick.

Such a strange combo, and being seated on the small patio you get to witness it all firsthand. At least it's serviced by a handful of busses to/from civilization, plus the silver line which runs every few minutes (but you may want to stick to coming here in early evening hours- as the sun goes down the vibe gets seedier).\\n\\nWe were able to snag a table right after work, and got to sit on the patio. I'd been wanting to check this place out after hearing such good things, and was excited for some quality family-style Asian food sans MSG. The boy and I split the following:\\n\\n-Mango Raspberry Sangria (special sangria of the day, one glass for me): had high hopes, but didn't end up caring for this. I think it was a combo of me not caring for the sake addition and the mango/raspberry being too sugary sweet. \\n-Scallion pancakes: light, crispy, flavorful, but oh-so-salty. I think that was intentional, and I actually did enjoy the saltiness of it, it seemed to bring out the flavor more. But if you're salt-averse, skip this one.\\n-Pork and chive dumplings: well done, browned nicely and seasoned well. Dipping sauce was on the spicy side (so, not for me). Solid dumplings (but not as mind-blowing as Gourmet Dumpling House, IMO).\\n-Triple Pork Mushu Stir Fry with brown rice side: I'd order this again in a heartbeat. Great char, awesome combo of bacon/sausage/pork with various veggies, delicious sauce on the stir fry plus an additional yummy sauce on the side, and some nice pancakes and bao on the side to make little sandwiches with (could have used an even number though, 2 pancakes and 1 bao are a bit hard to split between two people). \\n-Coconut cream pie: awesome. Light but substantive, full of flavor, a dessert that really stands out in a sea of chocolate tortes and ice cream. I'm already a huge fan of Flour's baked goods, so I knew I'd love any sweet that came from Joanne Chang, and this pie did not let me down. Make sure you save room for dessert- I highly recommend this pie in particular, but I'm sure any of the desserts are excellent.\\n\\nOur waitress was pleasant and service was pretty attentive in the beginning, but after we got our main dishes there was a bit of a wait to get dessert menus, and another wait to get our check. We weren't in a hurry so it didn't really bother us, but the table near us was freaking out because they had to get to the airport and things weren't moving fast enough for them, so take that into consideration.\\n\\nI don't do spicy (like, at all) and the boy doesn't do seafood, so that significantly cut down our own menu options to share, but I still appreciated the variety of items to choose from (would love to see more non-spicy, non-seafood noodle choices in particular).\\n\\nI'd be happy to return, but it didn't thrill me enough to make it a regular spot (plus the area's a bit sketch/remote)."},{"name":"Big City","address":"138 Brighton Ave","city":"Allston","stars":"3.5","text":"Came here to play some pool, since bowling is too damn expensive around here.

We hadn't seen one of our friends for many years so were catching up, drinking a nice bottle of wine, reviewing the menu and specials - in general enjoying the start to the evening. \\n\\nOur waiter kept coming around every few minutes asking to take our order and at 6:55 he was there again.

I thought maybe there was a large group arriving and he was looking out for us not to get behind that order but no, he explained that they have a 2 hour turnaround and the table was booked for 8:30. From that point forward, we were treated unbelievably awful. We were pushed and rushed to order, eat and get out. \\n\\nWe had no idea there was a 2 hour limit on dinner (they did not tell us this when we made the reservation nor when they confirmed the reservation). We spoke with the manager at one point expressing our disappointment and the rude service we were getting and his attitude was \\"this isn't a fine dining restaurant - you should have known this if you've been here before\\" BTW, when I was there previously, there was again no mention of this policy they have now and we weren't rushed. \\n\\nThe evening was a complete disaster - we didn't order appetizers because we felt we didn't have time.

My wife's lobster bisque was sublime, and the crab and corn chowder was thick, tasty, and very rich.  My wife had a crab cake for an entree, and while it was certainly large enough, I found both texture and taste to be lacking.  My \\"Market Fresh Fish\\" -- a broiled halibut filet -- was singularly unremarkable, with an excess of salt overpowering the delicate flavor of the fish.\\n\\nMany reviewers rave about the service at Eddie V's, and perhaps we just drew a server who did not appeal to us.  His manner of speaking was completely artificial and affected, and he repeatedly addressed my wife as, \\"My Dear,\\" a title I consider to be overly familiar.  He didn't understand my wife's drink order, forcing us to flag him down and order it a second time, this time with more specific instructions.  The price of my entree was not on the menu, and when I asked about the cost, he told me that it was \\"about $23.\\"  When the bill arrived, I was charged $34, nearly 50% above his estimate.  In all fairness, I did not dispute this charge because the dinner was a special occasion that I didn't want to spoil by bickering over price.  I am confident that if I had called this discrepancy to our server's attention, he would have adjusted the bill.  However, one would hope that a well trained server at an elite restaurant would take the time to verify the price if he were uncertain about it.\\n\\nSpeaking of prices, be prepared to spend upwards of $100 per person.  The wine is priced at quadruple retail (!) meaning that we spent $88 on two very ordinary bottles of $11 wine.  Entrees are in the $30 - $40 range, and there was a subtle but constant pressure for us to spend more.  Our server was constantly trying to upsell us on most of our choices and did what he could to expedite the disappearance of our beverages in apparent hopes that we would order more.\\n\\nOverall, Eddie V's is not a bad place to eat, but neither is it the top dining destination it considers itself to be.

The large fry is a perfect size for two hungry folk and the small is still perfectly splittable for two lighter eaters. Always busy, but their unique layout and line-plan gets you through the order line, seated and gazing at your tasty burger before you know it. It also totally helps that you can order a drink at the bar as you pass it in line. Drinks are delicious and intoxicating. Beers are wonderful and come in a chalice!

She offered me fast replacements which I  agreeded to. The replacements were both fast, hot and totally better as they should have been first go round. \\n\\nThe fish fliet; had me contemplating what high tech method can a portion of fish be sliced sooo crazy thin whilst not loosing its structure as a filet! Maybe 3/16\\" max. thickness, if not only an 1/8\\" thin! Had a seasoned salt on it which was okay. So, the filet got extra point from the intrigue factor. Taste and texture (well all the texture that  3/16\\" can offer) was acceptable but with no reason to condemn or recommend or desire a repeat.\\n\\nThe shrimp scampi also has this interestingly different (point getter) presentation. The grouping appears similar to the large swirly lolli-pops but w/o the stick. They nested 6 shrimp (or so) in a circular  design and are served in a shallow dish of really  garlicky butter. Ummm.  This was the winner on the plate. Only wish the shrimp could have been bigger as these were pretty small guys - but shrimpy and  lusciously buttery-garlic. Met my expectation for scampi w/o the pasta. \\n\\nBiscuits were their famously hot, sorta crunchy top-with a buttery and salty goodyness. DANG!! Sometimes eating Paleo is sooo hard. A pinch or two, or three?  couldn't hurt.

We were in there around 10:30 on a Friday and have never had such a terrible experience. Yes we were close to closing time... But if you are going to rush people out and make them feel unappreciated and deliver poor service and poor quality burgers with cold fries maybe you should stop taking orders after 10:30. I tried to get over being frustrated telling myself that we shouldn't have come so close to closing time but over a week later I still felt like we were cheated out of what we had grow to expect from Hop Doddy. When you paid just as much as the person who walked in at 6pm you should receive the same experience.. Its not like we walked in at 9:55 on a Tuesday. There were plenty of other patrons still seated and dining. I emailed management about this trying to give them a heads up before blasting it on yelp,  but my reply was met with..\\n\\n\\"We don't receive many messages like this , can you please elaborate more on your experience?\\" \\n\\nI find this to be quite counterproductive as I am pretty sure that's was why I emailed you in the first place.

As soon as we attempted to sit down the bartender informed us that those seats were already reserved for someone waiting in line... (first we have ever heard of this) OK, so we go over to the line that we could have been in 10 minutes sooner. After we get over to the other side waiting a few more minutes she finally asks us if we would like a beer.. Well yes we did and were ever so grateful she finally asked. To our luck and well maybe hers too, the keg was blown and she said she would change it and bring it over to us. Appeared as if she changed the keg.. but then we waited and tried to get her attention, however she went to serving the guests who she was reserving the seats for who already had beers. She never delivered on the beer and we continued to wait in line.. The order takers were trying to get all orders in as at this point we were at the back of the line, they were rushing and not being friendly. We finally ordered our burgers and brews.

The servers are accommodating to special requests and the food is delicious. Prices are pretty good too"},{"name":"Maenam","address":"1938 W 4th Avenue","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4","text":"Service: Mediocre. I felt like they needed more employees as the place was packed and they seemed spread a little thin. It also wasn't very friendly. I felt like it had the stereotypical high end restaurant vibe that came with its snoody attitude. I'm not saying they were rude or anything, but it wasn't leaving me with a warm and fuzzy vibe like I usually get at almost every other authentic Thai restaurant.\\n\\nNow let's get to the important stuff: food. I will fully admit that I came here with very, very high expectations. My friends rave about this place left and right. I have friends who drive here from different parts of town just because they say this is the best Thai they've ever had. Having been to Thailand and loving several Thai dishes myself, I thought I'd be just as wow'ed.\\n\\n- Betal leaf wrap with grilled prawns was tasty...without the betal leaf. I felt like the leaf really didn't marry the flavors well...it took away from it. It was such a contrast that I think it lessened the taste of everything else.\\n- Steamed mussels were lackluster. Someone needs to have a chat with their seafood monger because whomever is bringing in the mussels is doing them a disservice. Any decent mussel you get is nice, meaty, fresh and juicy - I'd say 80% of ours were not that. \\n- Grilled thai sausage and crispy rice salad was decent. I loved the crispy rice and the flavors in there but the thai sausage was nothing spectacular. In fact, the dish could stand alone without it.\\n- Crispy fried oysters were just crispy fried oysters. Have had them elsewhere at non-Thai places and the only thing that made this one different was the dipping sauce on the side. \\n- hot and sour soup of braised beef was decent but nothing outstanding. I love Thai soups of all types but this one didn't hit the spot. It had all the smells but it wasn't packing a punch.\\n- oyster mushroom and baby corn tempura was interesting. It was extremely crunchy which I loved but my partner, not so much. The dipping sauce was spectacular.\\n- salmon larb was delectable. I can probably say it was the most delicious thing we had that night. \\n- cashew chicken was very un-Thai. Throwing thai basil in with a protein and some vegetables does NOT make it thai. Just like using a wok on something doesn't make it Chinese food. I thought the dish was flavorful and I'd get it again but it didn't make me think of Thailand.\\n- beef curry was the worst dish of the evening. The usual complaint we all have at any restaurant is that there wasn't enough flavor/seasoning, but this dish had the opposite problem: it was overseasoned. I have never seen so much \\"stuff\\" in my beef curry to the point when I ladled the coconut curry onto some rice, there was a lot of stuff on the rice. It was so potent that the beef had no flavor at all. Yes the meat was smushable by fork (which is a great thing) but the beef might as well not have been there because it was just an overpowered dish.\\n\\n\\nThis isn't the most expensive Thai I've had so I have no complaints about the price point. I can honestly say that the food simply didn't wow me. I really wanted to love this place since I've heard so many great things and the Yelp and Urbanspoon reviews are great. I left feeling full stomach wise but not content. Maybe it was overhyped? I'm just so disappointed because I was hoping to find an amazing Thai place in my neighborhood I could frequent.

A very small waffle. This breakfast staple, that has been pushed aside by others such as pancakes, omelets, and even granola, is allowed to shine brightly at Medina. As common as ordering water, people at this cozy yet modern cafe, order their waffles before even opening the menu. Some even have a chance to taste one before setting foot in the cafe! That is, of course, if there is a wait and the waffler happens to open the window that you have been starting through since you got there. \\n\\nThere are several several toppings to choose from. I tasted the fig and orange marmalade (amazing!), raspberry caramel (most unique), and the mixed berry compote (classic). All very good, if you choose to dunk your waffle. The waffle itself is very fluffy on the inside with a slight crunch on the outside. It melts in your mouth as soon as you take the first bite. \\n\\nWe also ordered some lunch item. I got the roast beef sandwich with horseradish pistou, cornichons, and frisse among other flavorful ingredients. The roast beef was cooked rare which allowed its flavor to really come through. The baguette was fresh and slightly toasted to make it an excellent vessel for the roast beef and other complements.  The hummus, tabouleh, pita, and cucumber salad were also very good.  \\n\\nThe service was friendly, the atmosphere is appealing and happy, and the prices just right.

I ordered the mushroom/swiss burger with an extra side of the smoked mayonnaise that I have heard RAVE reviews about thinking, \\"when can a burger disappoint(?)\\". \\n\\nSadly, this was the first time a burger was disappointing.  It was so greasy that I could have probably soaked it all with a beach towel with remaining grease to play with. There was no flavor and with the amount of whipped cheese topped on the meat, it was overwhelmingly awkward. The buns seem to have been soaked in butter and oil before getting on the grill, too. I was left with indigestion and the feeling of nausea for the remainder of the day.\\n\\nI will say that the smoked mayonnaise is to DIE for and their french fries were crispy and perfect, which is to my liking. Perfectly seasoned and I appreciated at least that.

He said he was told to not get us waters because we were only having soup. I can only guess full wait staff service (getting waters) is for buffet purchases only. This is a not only a horrible practice to decline a patron water but generally a bad way to run a business as it follows ZERO logic and makes no sense. The place was looking up once they fired the last cashier that had really bad customer interactions but has since settled back into their routine of hiring people with no basic customer service etiquette.

I have yet to order anything off their menu which was not excellent.  My two go to burgers are the Llano Poblano and the Magic Shroom.  Both are a creative mix of ingredients and usually the deciding factor is whether I'm in the mood for spicy.  The truffle fries are fantastic.

I recently moved from MI to TX and *the* place to go in MI was Red Coat.  Up until now, I thought NO ONE could be Red Coat's burgers......until I discovered this little gem.  MY LORD. Let me explain. \\n\\nLast Saturday my boyfriend and I were craving burgers (well, may be I was craving burgers.....) and we found a spot to park on a side street because there was a small art fair going on and all of the back in only spaces on the street were taken, which actually seemed to work out better.  We walked up to the restaurant which only has a small sign outside so we thought it looked kind of hidden, which I really dig that kind of vibe.  We walked in and the place was PACKED. I mean PACKED.  We didn't mind because we knew it was going to be jumpin' considering it was 6:30pm on a Saturday night.  \\n\\nWhen you walk in, you are given menus and you need to figure out what you want to order before you get to the front of the line.  While you are waiting, when you get to the bar area, you can order some drinks while you wait.  How this system works is you browse the menu, wait in line, order at the front, they give you a number and you go find the table with that number.  They then bring your food to you. We had a bit of a struggle trying to figure that out until someone moved and we saw the small guideline list.  :) \\n\\nWe knew were going to wait about an hour or so...until we got to the bar area and started to order drinks when the bartender said, \\"Hey guys, if you want to have a seat over here, I've got two open seats.\\"  Of course we snagged them.  I'm not one of those people that has any shame in eating at the bar area - especially when we knew it was going to be good judging from the line that was now out the door and around the building. \\n\\nWe sat at the bar and ordered our burgers.  I order the bacon cheeseburger and my boyfriend ordered the magic shroom.  They come served on small silver platters.  Let me tell you - it tasted like they injected the burger with confetti, balloons, cake and presents because there was a fiesta going on in my mouth. The burger was so juicy and so full of flavor.....I was literally eating smaller bites and eating slower so I could savor every last bite!!  We also ordered chili cheese fries (cheese automatically comes on the side) which kind of look like string fries but they are a little bigger and are amazing!! You can ask for chipolte ketchup which is on the spicy side and delicious!! \\n\\nI will definitely be back.  This is HANDS DOWN THE THE BEST BURGER I HAVE EVER EATEN!!

The skin wasn't /super/ crispy, like some other types of fried chicken where there's an excess of batter (which doesn't taste that good), but it was really flavorful with an appropriate amount of crisp. As for the chicken itself, holy smokes!, it's the juiciest fried chicken I've ever had. UHMAZING. The chicken is also really fresh, and the pieces are fried when you order. The potato salad and cole slaw is really good too, as are the beans (you know what, everything here is good). By default, the plates come with beans and cole slaw, but for $0.50, you can swap a side for something else (e.g. mac and cheese, fries, etc). For those of you considering the fries, just know that they aren't very crispy on the outside, but that's not to say that they are soggy. They /are/ real fluffy on the inside though. You also get a slice of white bread. After a generous tip, the bill is still under $11. That's insane, especially if you take into account how good and full you feel afterwards.

The key to this deliciousness was the very fresh, very high quality ingredients, plus the incredibly rich and complex creative flavor combinations. Four of us shared a pescatarian version of the chef's tasting menu. I'm usually not a big fan of chef's tasting menus because I get confused and annoyed with too many flavors and sizes and textures across the meal. I prefer to focus on two or three things that work together for a meal. But at Maenam, I very much enjoyed every one of the 10 different dishes we had -- it all worked together so well ... the sweet, sour, tart, piquant, fishy, salty, crunchy, creamy ... and the portions were perfect. Especially memorable were the prawns with gorlae marinade, the salad with seared tuna, and the grape sorbet dessert. Incredible flavors and experience.

I have to admit to being underwhelmed by the croissant. It didn't have the airy, flaky quality that I've seen in the best croissants, and the chocolate inside didn't feel especially special. On the other hand, the chocolate marquise was quite delicious (that caramel will make you work, though)--enough for me to eat the whole thing, even though I probably shouldn't have.

Clam chowder was ordered for an appetizer, which smelled really good and had a pretty good flavor; however, the clams were so chewy it was like I was chewing gum. The entree was fish and chips which I didn't think would be that easy to mess up, but it was way to salty and the batter was sliding right of the fish, the fries were soggy, and the Cole slaw was extremely watery (sitting in a puddle).

Light, fluffy, moist, & the glaze was moist and not overly sweet. The basil wasn't overpowering either. My hubs ordered the maple with bacon. I had to try a bite, of course. The maple was a nice mix of sweet & savory in one bite. Maple was nice & mellow as well. They had a small variety of other good looking flavors as well, but we were still full from an early breakfast so couldn't manage to shove anymore food in our belly. \\n\\nWhat I liked is the quality of ingredients they use.

The first thing we asked our waitress (after waiting 15 min for her to come to our table) was if she'd fill our water bottles on the way out and she said she would. We ordered an appetizer which promptly arrived, but then waited another 30 min to place our order. I finally stopped another waitress who took our order. I was drinking my glass of water and actually found a small shard of glass in it - after telling our initial waitress she acted bothered by the fact I requested a fresh glass of water instead of continuing to drink out of the one I had just found a shard of glass floating around. After lunch, we waited another 45 min before I actually had to get up and ask for our check. She brought our checks, slammed them on the table, and when my husband asked if she'd fill our water bottles as initially requested she responded, \\"I'm really busy and just got sat three more tables. If you want water, you can grab the water gun at the wait station and fill it yourself.\\" Can't make this up. Coming from a waitress of 10 years, service can really make or break a restaurant. This service was bottom of the barrel to say the least, hence the 1 star."},{"name":"Buffet Palace","address":"4608 West Gate Blvd","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"One of the best Asian buffets I've ever had.

At least at Mooyah the people yelling at you are pretty friendly and welcoming. :) It does seem very similar to a place down south that some \\"guys\\" just opened  (I think there were 5 of them).\\n\\nBurger - pretty good overall. Free toppings are great, but lead to a messy burger eating experience. I kinda like a messy burger experience though. Not sure why people are saying the burgers are too expensive. A double burger for $5-ish is pretty good if you ask me. This isn't fast food drive thru ya know.  Fries seem expensive, but the orders end up being way more than you thought. I found the fries to be very tasty - especially with cider vinegar - although extra salty on my first visit (not as much on a subsequent visit).\\n\\nI think in the end, Mooyah ends up being a little less expensive than Mighty Fine for a whole meal. I think extra visits should be in order to determine whose burger reigns supreme.\\n\\n\\nAs an aside - it's tough to get a yelp first on a new restaurant these days.  I'd been driving past mooyah for a couple months before they opened, watching for an indication of opening. I drove past one night and saw they were open, so planned to stop in for lunch the next day. Of course by that time someone else had already visited and reviewed for the first.

We probably should have turned back then, but we decided to take a gamble based on good yelp reviews (which I'm now convinced are not written by actual patrons). \\n\\nMore than once our party described the atmosphere as being \\"like a morgue\\" -\\ncold, empty & lifeless. We asked several times for the heat to be turned up, and as we suffered through the chilly temperatures, our server wore a winter coat for the majority of the meal.\\n\\nConsidering the restaurant was nearly empty, you would think the chef could devote all his efforts to putting his best dishes out. Either he didn't care or he can't cook. The food took ages to arrive and when it did it was uninspired & most of the dishes were things we could have prepared from the warmth & comfort of our own homes. One member of our party ordered the fish special. After a very confusing explanation of what the dish entailed, he was served a bowl of broth while we all received our entrees. He had to then ask for the fish to be served so as to not just be eating broth while we all ate actual food. The presentation was unappealing. It was literally one color - white.  \\n\\nTo top things off, when we told the server we were not impressed with the food, he responded \\"well, I'm sorry, but I didn't cook it\\". As someone who worked as a server for over a decade and as someone who enjoys eating out, I was shocked to say the least. That is not the appropriate way to handle that situation. You offer free desert, you have the manager come to the table, you comp some drinks. You don't pass the buck.\\n\\nFrom start to finish, this dining experience was one of the worst I've had in Orlando in quite some time and the only one that's inspired me to write such a lengthy review.

For example, on my last visit they were featuring a new margarita concoction blended with espresso. I personally prefer my margaritas with a kick of another kind, so instead I opted for my traditional white hot chocolate. Although the beverages are good, the food fails to deliver. I've tried the brownies, carrot cake, and doughnuts, all of which were incredibly bland and harder than any building material known to man.\\n\\nService: All the staff were friendly and efficient. The ordering process is fairly standard; you pay at the register and then retrieve your drink order once it's prepared at the other end of the counter.\\n\\nAtmosphere: Very expansive. I'd prefer not to keep making Starbucks comparisons, but the one thing that really impressed me about Dancing Goats was that they opted for open space instead of packing every available crevice with worthless chotchkies and over-sized mugs embossed with nauseating quotes. They also have a really nice outdoor patio, as well as indoor bar area where you can sit and watch the staff preparing everyone's drinks.\\n\\nPrice: Commensurate with most other coffee shops.

My BFF ordered the Southern burger and self admittedly \\"inhaled\\" her meal. She really did.

The Butcher's Cut was the tastiest with beef, crumbled bleu cheese, caramelized onions, soy truffle vinaigrette, fris√©e, pickled shallots and red wine jam. The rBQ with beef and pulled brisket was dry, but the Fried Chicken with b+b pickles and spicy Duke's mayo gives Chick-fil-A a run for their money.\\n\\nThe Fry Side Sampler was equally tasty with Beef Fat French Fries, Sweet Potato Tots and Vodka Battered Onion Rings. The Beef Fat French Fries with smoked mayo and ketchup definitely take the win over the other two in the trio.

The lamb was cooked perfectly, good bit of pink, seasoned very well and flavorful. I do wish the burger had been grilled rather than griddled. I prefer grilled burgers in both taste and texture, but this was a good burger.\\n\\nWhat made it a good burger was the attention to proportion. You could taste each individual component, save maybe the picked onion. Thinly sliced cucumber (think scalloped potato thin) and the herby lamb were were detectable as individual flavors in each bite. Throw in the creamy tang of the feta and the peppery tang of the arugula...it was a damn good burger. \\n\\nAs for extras: the fries were fries. Nothing to write home about. The horseradish mustard sauce is definitely my kind of condiment. Slight heat from the horseradish, slightly different heat from the mustard and richness from mayo. Fantastic. The chipotle ketchup was underwhelming, if that's a word, and the mesquite bbq was forgettable.\\n\\nThe only problem I ran into was with drinks.

After hearing everybody I know here in Austin about how incredible Hopdoddy is, I decided to go for it.... and to tell you the truth, I wish I had gone earlier.  One of the things that turned me off was the fact that for the most part, you have to line up for quite sometime to actually get a table and you can't order it to go or via takeout. But honestly, the wait was pretty painless especially when there are servers handing out water to people in line as well taking drink orders, which is a rather welcome service especially in the Texas heat. I personally recommend the skinny dip, which is this mixture of margarita and St Arnold's Lawnmower in a huge glass chalice... I know its supposed to be a goblet, but I like chalice better. \\n\\nAnyway, after about 30 min or so we finally ordered. I ended up getting the Greek, which was a lamb burger cooked medium rare, with feta cheese, arugula, pickled red onions, tomato, cucumber, and my favorite tzatziki sauce, actually on suggestion I ordered an extra side of tzatziki. All I can say is that this burger was incredible, all the ingredients were fresh and quite flavorful.  I also had a taste of the primetime burger, which was pretty awesome as well. Full of flavor and a rather decadent burger if you ask me.  Another thing we indulged on were their famous truffle fries, which were crispy and really, really tasty.  I also had a sip or two of their caramel and sea salt shake, which was probably one of the best shakes I have had, but then again I am not big on shakes.  All I have to say is that this shake was undeniably  tasty.\\n\\nIn terms of ambiance, the place itself was very clean, well organized, the staff was friendly and very helpful, and they had a pretty awesome bar.

If you're interested in giving Pattycake's goods a try but don't live anywhere near their Clintonville location, don't fret- each Cup 'O Joe location in the greater Columbus area (I believe there's at least six of them) carries the greatest hits that they have to offer, including the cookies I mentioned above.

It's been T'Kilas for a couple years now, and while they've kept most of their staple dishes, they've also added a lot of deluxe entree's. The menu is now quite extensive, yet the end result remains a restaurant where the portion-to-price ratio remains very customer-friendly.\\n\\nI've probably been coming here for about twelve years. Since I don't drink, I can't vouch for the margaritas, just the cuisine. I've enjoyed many of their chicken dishes. I've had pollo con papas, pollo relleno, and pollo cordon bleau multiple times. These tend to more along the lines of a fusion dish rather than traditional Mexican. They also serve a killer chile relleno appetizer. If you just want some basic Mexican, they have an extensive list of combo platters featuring tacos, tamales, enchiladas, taquitos, burritos, quesadillas, and so on. \\n\\nThe entree's added over the last couple years are of the deluxe, family-sized variety. Most combine portions of beef, pork, chicken, and/or shrimp along with cheese, bean, lettuce, and tortillas. Good stuff, just not minor undertakings.\\n\\nOne thing to avoid here--and probably a reason for some of the more negative Yelp reviews--would be anything on the menu that features ground beef. It's usually an unseasoned semi-liquid slurry. \\n\\nAs far as the service, I would say it's pretty mediocre, which can be attributed to the absence of any managerial presence out on the floor. It's always odd to come in and find there's no staff around.

We ordered two martinis, Chardonnay and Cabernet for drinks during the dinner.  The drinks were fine. \\n\\nWe ordered ciopino, salted sea bass and dungeness crab for the main course.  We ordered a toro roll, cold lobster and crab poutine for starters.   We had their panna cotta for dessert and coffee. \\n\\nThe sea bass was excellent, perfectly done.  The meat was juicy and wasn't over cooked or under cooked.   The dungeness crab was good.   The dessert was good. \\n\\nThe toro roll and cold lobster was okay.  Both were not special.  I would recommend not ordering these two dishes.   All the dishes used fresh ingredients and it is apparent in the taste.  The dishes in general lack creativity both in presentation and flavor.  To be fair, sea food is usually best kept simple and this is what they did.  But a little more creativity could be better.   Generally speaking, one may not remember the restaurant as something special.  I didn't think anything was fantastic.  It was good enough that I felt I got my money's worth but nothing  to rave about. \\n\\nThe service was very good.  The waiter asked how our starters were and I must have made a negative facial expression.  He picked up on it and asked further and actually had the manager come talk to me.  For the record, I was not complaining, I only felt it was not as good as my expectation based on yelp reviews, the first impression from the ambiance and price of the dishes restaurant..  The place is very busy so the waiter can't give you as much attention as you may want.  I don't usually make too much of a big deal with this for  restaurants.  I will only tell you my experience.  The waiter didn't fold the napkins all the time when I stepped away from the table.  The waiter didn't bring wet towels during the starter.  Even though we had to crack the lobster ourselves.  He did bring wet towels for the crab.     Again it wasn't  big deal for me, but it may be for you. \\n\\nThe total bill came to $210ish before tip.  That price is very  reasonable for a restaurant with this type of food (especially the freshness).   The restaurant lacks a  professional waiting staff, as should be and lacks creativity in food flavor and presentation for their reputation. \\n\\nFor those of you from SF so you can have baseline reference I am comparing Coast to Le Boulevard or Park Tavern  in SF since both are suppose to be top of their class in the respective city."},{"name":"Terry Black's Barbecue","address":"1003 Barton Springs Rd","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"Very good beef ribs n turkey.

It's sort of a small plates place, except the plates are really pretty reasonable.  The pork potstickers were well loved by my boyfriend, as was his very spicy beef pho.  Our edamame and celery slaw was one of the most simple yet interesting tastes I've had in some time ... we were both a fan.  We split the spring rolls and liked them, and I really enjoyed my lemon shrimp potstickers.  It was my first time voluntarily ordering shrimp, and they were really great.  My only gripe was that there wasn't anything vegetarian in the entre category.  You know, some veggie fried rice, veggie pho ... something.  While I still occasionally eat fish, I had been hoping to go meat-free for the night and was disappointed.\\n\\nHowever, the wait staff was friendly and ber-present, and the space, though small, is very cool.

One of my friends ordered a maragarita (straight up, not frozen) with a specified tequila (which they have a lot to choose from), and the drink came out pretty much straight tequila. When my friend went to return it, he was told when people order good tequila, they don't want to cover up the taste... alright... the second version of the drink might as well have not had alcohol in it.\\n\\nWe started with the habanero teryaki wings... interesting combination. Pretty good. Also had some of the pulled chicken nachos. Good portion, good flavors, good starter.\\n\\nThe problem with the starters... we were not given any plates. We pointed this out to the waitress, she said she would get some. 5 minutes later, we went to the bar and got them ourselves. \\n\\nFor my main, I had the fajitas with the steak, chicken, and fish.

Flip burger is at least 1/4 pound mixture of 3 different types of beef. The quality of the buttery toasted bun is much superior than the typical burger joints. The toppings are fresher. If taste is how you judge a burger as opposed to size and greasiness, then Flip Burger is the burger of choice. \\n\\nThe parking situation is a little challenging.

My carnivorous friend also ordered the pork belly buns for herself, and I ordered the tofu banh mi.

In Thai food, the five different flavors we are able to taste should be incorporated in every good meal.  I have been to Maenam a number of times now and have not ever been disappointed.  Actually, it was my gourmand sister from Chicago who had introduced me to this fine restaurant about two years ago. Angus An, the owner is one who favors fusion and experiment instead of sticking to the traditional recipes.  It would not be a fair assessment if you judge this restaurant by the traditional recipe.  But then again, why would Chef An have to go through all the training in Montreal, NYC and Europe if all he wants to is just open another Thai restaurant?  The fun of eating at the Maenam is having all your taste buds tickled and as always, in an unusual and better way.  I have  found the flavoring of the different dishes here to be different and not traditional, but the blending of the spices with the careful treatment to the different food materials were cooked to perfection or near it.  And Chef An should be complimented for it.  \\nThe Maenam is also about quality fresh local food products.  Recently, we went for the Royal Thai Dinner when the Maenam was featuring BC Sport Prawns.  i cannot imagine a better way to celebrate the fabulous local spot prawns. And what a meal that was.  \\nThe Maenam is also about value.  With most higher end restaurants that feature a tasting menu with fresh, local food products, the typical price is $60 and Up.  The Maenam Chef's menu is only $30! And I prefer the food here to most of the higher end restaurants. There is also a wonderful wine list with reasonable markups.  \\nMenu items of note are: Steam Mussels with lemongrass and Thai Basil.  The mussels were steamed to perfection, not too raw nor overcooked.  The broth had a hint of Tom Yum to it, but fortunately, far more complex yet lighter.  I love the Crispy Fried Oysters.  The batter is so light it melted in my mouth.  The Green Mango Salad with grilled Albacore Tuna is a dish to die for. The tuna is very lightly cooked, more like a Sashimi along with a generous Lime sprinkling with a slightly sweet sauce to bring out the green mango flavor. Writing about this makes me want to drop everything and run to the Maenam right now.   All the curries are exceptional but the best is the Dry Curry of Cripsy Lingcod.  \\nSometimes all these dishes show up in the Chef's menu and that sure would have the combination of Sweet, Salty, Bitter, Hot, and Sour taste by the time you are done with the meal.  One of the dishes had deep fried sprigs of whole peppercorns and when chewed, they have a really nice contrasting bitter flavor.

Apparently, that can't be done.... So I had to wait while they brought another sauce, about an hour later. What is the point?\\n\\nI still order from here, but have minimal expectations."},{"name":"Herb's Mac and Cheese","address":"4255 SE Belmont St","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"Visited the food court on Hawthorne on a recent trip to Portland.

I had the scallops, the pita bread with spreads, the spinach pie, the lamb pie, the rib eye and I think that's it. We pretty much tried everything on the menu with everyone getting to taste. Next time I think I will just do the appetizer meal as the small appetizer plates are wonderful. The rib eye was good, could have used a little more flavor, but it was good and huge, like a slab of meat from the Flinstones. I also tried a little of the Risotto and that was phenomenal.

This place definitely did not disappoint me. We ordered the papaya salad, chicken satay, lettuce wrap, mango cashew stirfry, and Thai milk tea. All delicious and very flavourful. I especially liked the lettuce wrap, nice and refreshing. Papaya salad is a bit too spicy for me, but overall is good. I also love the chicken satay and the seasoning is just simple yet delicious, and the chicken is not too dry. I do agree on the greasier side for the food, but I guess most of the stirfry tend to be like that. I love the Thai milk tea that really balances out the food in the end. I want to come back to try their deep fried ice cream the next time, as well as the mango salad.\\nI had the food to go, one reason is because I prefer to eat at home tonight, but I also find it is a wiser choice because there's no air conditioning. It is very warm in the restaurant. If the windows can be opened instead of just all glasses, I think it'd be a lot cooler.\\nSeems like this is an owner-run restaurant.

The Indian food from Whole Foods is much tastier. Skip the time it takes to get to this restaurant and the hassle of parking"},{"name":"Clay Pit","address":"1601 Guadalupe St","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"I first went to Clay Pit with low expectations.  I came away pleasantly surprised and find something new to love every time I go back.\\n\\nThe location is great, in a part of Central Austin that doesn't have too many options.  The building is an old feed store.  Look at the front from across the street and you'll see the resemblance to some of the old feed stores that surround Austin.  Legend has it that the downstairs cellar was a tunnel to a brothel in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.  The interior is immense, with a large bar and main dining area, 2 rooms in the back, cellar seating downstairs and a private party room on top.  Sometimes it can feel like it's too big, but the cellar and back rooms don't leave you feeling that way, so if it's not too busy, you might want to request a table there.\\n\\nThe menu is comprehensive and full of surprises.  First off, the appetizer menu is what I would generously call Americanized Indian.  Delicious, but not traditional.  Mussels are very nicely done and you can even order a side of the mussel curry to dip naan in.  Crab cakes are a surprisingly good choice and the Tandoori bites allow you to see whether or not the Tandoori chef is on point or not (they usually are).  I was shocked to see beef on the menu.  They know how to work the tandoor here and cook their beef well. It's one of the few places in Austin at least that you can try all of the curry flavors with beef which is a whole new set of flavors if you're counting.  My personal favorites are the chicken saag, the lamb vindaloo, or the rack of lamb, which are all well-cooked and spiced to your request.\\n\\nI don't normally go meat free, but Indian restaurants are a great place for vegetarians (probably less so for vegans with all the clarified butter), and Clay Pit is no exception.  The Daal Mahkni (lentils with a tomato cream sauce) and Aloo Gobi (cauliflower curry) are well executed.  The rice is fragrant and perfectly cooked, and every naan selection I've tried, I've been impressed with.\\n\\nWhen you're ready to try Indian with a wrinkle, Clay Pit is a solid choice."},{"name":"Veracruz All Natural","address":"2505 Webberville Rd","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"Wow, this place is as good as all the reviews say.

Will certainly be back!!\\n\\nUpdate 10/5/18 - New Management\\nMomz's is under new management so I decided to head down and give them a try as this has been my go to for lunch regularly for 2 years. The dining room looked nice and there was a new coat of paint. This is the only thing that was good about the new ownership during my visit.  When I first came up to the counter, there were no menus on the tables or on the counter.  It took the lady at the register over 2 minutes to even ask me if I needed help as she was having trouble with credit card machine.  I asked for a menu.  I was told there were no menus.  I asked if the food and prices were the same before.  I was told yes.  I asked about the lunch special as that is what I always got.  I was told yes, still $5.99.  So I go to order Jerk chicken and I was told it wasn't ready yet.  This is 12:30 on their opening day of new management.  No excuse for not having food ready.  There were no beef patties or coco bread to buy so I didn't even ask.  So I got the brown stew chicken with rice and peas.  No more compartment container with choice of rice, meat, and side.  Just a small container with rice and meat now.  And no mac and cheese now! Since the waitress had issues with the credit card machine earlier and I was already short on time to get back to work, I decided to pay with cash.  Guess what?  They didn't have change.  I had to wait around for another 3+ minutes while someone goes to get change.  Well that didn't happen so they had three different people get money out of their pockets to eventually give me my change.  First day mishaps happen but this wasn't even the worst part.  The worst part was the food.  I have had Jamaican food from at least 6 different restaurants around Central Florida and this was hands down the worst.  There was absolutely no flavor to the brown stew chicken.  The vegetables were still raw except for one small potato that somehow got cooked.  The chicken was dry and bland.  And the rice and peas, bland as could be and overcooked.  This is such a disappointment as we have a lot of people from work that visit here regularly, but they will lose our business if this is how they conduct business and cook their food.

This bakery is more of a take out place versus being a sit down bakery. It is a hole in the wall and you would not even know its a bakery from the outside. It's been a secret to the banh mi connoisseur. After being in Iowa and eating a banh mi on a hoagie roll (sacrilegious!), it was nice to return to PDX and have a good banh mi in my childhood neighborhood. We have been going to this bakery since it first opened, about 15 years ago or more? It's been so long I can't even remember.  Initially this bakery catered to the Vietnamese and SE Asian population. But now it is more mainstream with the popularity of Vietnamese food, especially the banh mi which appears to have evolved into one of the hipster foods. \\n\\nIf you are a banh mi connoisseur like myself, you can be blind folded and know exactly which sandwich came from which bakery. The banh mi bread at this bakery is more glutinous, smaller, less flaky and more chewy as compared to Best Baguette. I also don't taste the Vietnamese mayonnaise when I bite into the original banh mi sandwich. Also, I can't taste the sour, salty and sweet flavor of the marinated daikon radish and carrots. In the old days, they use to include cucumbers sliced the long way but unfortunately this is not done anymore. If you are used to a banh mi from Best Baguette that includes lots of meat and marinated veggies, then you will be disappointed at this little bakery. Don't get me wrong, it is a good sandwich. I have my biases.\\n\\nOn the upside, they have what I think is the best and freshest pate chard for $0.89. Their Vietnamese pastries are also very good. The banh mi are made to order and you will not find any in cases. You have to order the sandwich. If they are busy, you will have to wait. It is a family bakery and there are not alot of staff so please be patient. We are close and frequent flyers to this bakery.

The signature sauces with rather bland.  Nothing stood out as great except the risotto that came with my appetizer.  Bread service, seemed to be from Publix.  Nothing that made me say yes, I want to go back.\\n\\nThen there was the table of 2 middle aged men and 5 ladies.  One was drunk and very loud, two were drunk and somewhat loud.  Obnoxious YES.  The server was trying to make peace with other tables and was not doing such a good job.  One of the gentlemen approached another table when she was trying to offer an apology and wanted to know if everything was ok in away to infer to that party that he would do something about it.  This was a place for the GM to step out, but I saw no one in charge.  In a crowded dining room they were a focus of embarrassment.  This place lacked good food, service for the price paid and no management of an unruly group.  The whole experience was bad, especially on a night when everything should have been set for the evening.  I do realize each place has bad days, but with so much out there, I would not waste a do over here that I might at another place.  I also know there are those that will defend it til the death.  For me, I have had way better for less, and much, much better for the same."},{"name":"Babica Hen Cafe","address":"15964 Boones Ferry Rd","city":"Lake Oswego","stars":"4","text":"I had way higher expectations for this place. \\n\\nThe decor is lovely, very sophisticated and clean.

It was just so sour and considering the price of it (I believe $9), I would be mad at myself if I threw away something that expensive. \\nI got an ice cream for dessert and it was basic to me.

I shared half of it with my friend last Saturday, and ordered one tonight to eat by myself. Absolutely no sharing. I really like the fact that they use real mushrooms with flavor, and not those white button things that come in those blue foam containers. The earthiness of the mushrooms and the beef pairs perfectly with the goat cheese, and the bright, herby basil pesto seems to bring it all together.\\n\\nThe fries at Hopdoddy are delicious too. Apparently, they use KENNEBEC potatoes. What're those, you ask? I have no idea! But they're special, and they make some darn good fries. Really crispy and well-seasoned. Delicious with the chipotle ketchup. The chili cheese sauce that you can get with the fries is AWESOME. I don't know what else they put in there other than chili and cheese, but it was addicting... an illegal substance comes to mind...\\n\\nI only managed to steal a few spoonfuls of my friends dark chocolate milkshake, but it was goooood, and I don't usually like chocolate milkshakes.\\n\\nThe ambiance at Hopdoddy is nice.

A subtle sauce of egg yolk and mustard add a touch of richness.\\n\\nNothing on the plate is superfluous. A leaf of baby arugula adds a peppery contrast to the savory pinto beans.

Our group was pretty much ignored for most of the evening, we couldn't hear any live music (although there was a jam box playing a CD that was skipping so badly we had to just turn it off), and no belly dancer came to dance for us until we complained at the end of the evening to the owner.  She sent in a belly dancer just as we were finishing up with our checks, and we had an enjoyable time with the dancer-- she was very talented.\\n\\nAnother night, I went in a smaller group, but the main dining area was so loud and crowded that they went to seat us next door at Christopher's.  After my last experience in there, I asked them to seat us outside instead.  This made a really big difference in our experience for the evening.  The outside seating is really lovely, and we were able to enjoy the music that was being played over loud speakers.  The belly dancers took turns taking the stage and wowing the crowd.  The only really awkward part was when the owner, Phara, decided to take a turn-- it was very uncomfortable to watch, and I kind of felt bad for her.  I just wanted it to end.\\nThe service was slow (just as it had been the last time), and on top of that, the waiter said that he couldn't divide our checks (there were four of us) even though that same waiter had divided the check last time when I was with a group of 12!  Frustrating.\\n\\nNot sure if I'll go back to Phara's or not.  I definitely enjoyed the food and (most of) the dancing, but I'm not sure if it's worth having to deal with the poor service.  Maybe if I try it one more time and get a better waiter, I'll have a more positive experience.  Right now, I'm just on the fence."},{"name":"Shan-A-Punjab","address":"500 Harvard St","city":"Brookline","stars":"4","text":"I never write reviews but I figured this place deserved one.\\nFirst of all the staff is super friendly and will give you some great advice for the food you order.\\nSecondly, the food is DELICIOUS.

The shiro was a tad bit tart (maybe too much tomato?), but it was good with the injera bread. \\n\\nLamb Tibs- The hubs LOVED this dish. Not being a lamb lover myself, I have to say they did a good job of making the meat not gamey tasting. The texture of the meat was just right (and it's not fried like the fish tibs). It came with a side, and we picked the collards. The collards were cooked perfectly- not sour (like the usual Southern way),  but just with garlic & salt. Not too soft, nor too crunchy. Yum!\\n\\nMeat Sambusa- these were essentially small meat samosas. the wrap reminded me of Chinese spring rolls (the lighter version, not egg rolls), and were fried similarly. tasty, but they're small and disappeared in less than a minute. :)\\n\\nThe food came out really fast, and the service was friendly.

The chocolate eclair (our benchmark,) was outstanding, with a slight twist of an almost bitter chocolate cream filling to contrast the sweetness of the chocolate dipped top (or more accurately, bottom.) The choux was light, crispy and a perfect backdrop for both. Our rich choice was a chocolate and cassis layered torte that again made good use of the bitter quality of chocolate to produce a well-balanced and satisfying experience.

We also had a Tibetan restaurant on campus that I frequented at least once a week. I've also had friends who lived in Tibet for years, and have been there to visit them and my Tibetan students.  All that to say that I've eaten authentic and homemade Tibetan food many times (our Tibetan students often came over and cooked for us as well) and love it.\\n\\nI discovered this restaurant while visiting a friend in Cambridge.  I was VERY excited to find a Tibetan restaurant in the U.S.!  I then called my friend who used to live in Tibet and recently moved back to the Boston area. and told her about it.  She didn't know about it and was ecstatic to go try it with me.\\n\\nSince it was over a year ago since I ate at this restaurant, I don't remember the specifics of the food very much.  I do remember that it was generally good Tibetan food, though definitely tasted different from food found in Tibet. Some dishes were definitely close, but were altered for the American taste buds (and veggies added that normally aren't found in Tibet).  \\n\\nIf you've had real Tibetan food, you'd know that most are not very similar to Chinese food at all.  If some dishes are, it's probably due to Chinese influence.  Some of their foods are similar to Nepali food and Indian food because of past influences from those countries.\\n\\nSo if you're here, ask the server for dishes that are traditionally or commonly Tibetan.  Those are always the best, though may be very different from other foods you've tried. \\n\\nHere are a couple of common Tibetan foods that you might want to try.\\n1. Shogo Namtak (breaded and deep fried mashed potatoes) - Really good if you like potatoes.\\n2. Langsha Momos (beef dumplings) - In Tibet, all beef is usually yak meat, which is the most often found meat in most foods.  I like the pan fried, though the steamed is good too.\\n\\nI wish they had the steamed rice dish with potatoes and beef/yak in a type of light curry broth.  That was one of my favorite Tibetan foods. \\n\\nIn Tibet, vegetation is extremely difficult to grow because of the dry weather and high elevation.  So I've never eaten salads in Tibet or have ever heard my students ever eating them.  In general, raw vegetables aren't usually eaten in China.  So I didn't try any salads and only ordered the hot foods. (Notice none of the salads had Tibetan names.)  Most vegetation (especially greens and fruits) in Tibet is either imported or locally engineered there.\\n\\nShrimp isn't common in Tibetan food, and I don't remember pork being either.  So if you want more authentic Tibetan, try dishes with beef.\\n\\nOverall, the food was very expensive, especially compared to how common and extremely cheap these foods are in Tibet.  But since this isn't Tibet, the food is obviously priced more for being so unique and rare in the U.S.  But the food was good, and I wish it was cheaper so we could eat more. :)\\n\\nA couple of the servers actually looked like they were Tibetan.  I noticed though that most Tibetan-Americans I've talked to have actually never even been to Tibet, but came to the States with their parents when they fled Tibet about 50 years ago. I wish I could talk to them more and hear their stories, but generally Tibetans are pretty culturally shy and modest.  If you have a friendly and outgoing server, maybe ask them a little something about their culture. :)\\n\\nMy friend who used to live in Tibet goes to this restaurant whenever she can.  That says a lot.  I'll be visiting Cambridge later this fall, so I'll make sure I go and try this restaurant again.  I'll write an updated review then."},{"name":"Gusto Italian Kitchen & Wine Bar","address":"4800 Burnet Rd","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"I have eaten here several times and have always loved the food... and the drinks... and the desserts!

The plates are small, so they recommend that each person gets three plates at $7 to $15 a plate. The couples I sat with shared dishes. The waiters explain what the dishes were when they put it down. Each dish I tried was amazing and would impress any foodie. The duck egg dish was my favorite. 1) Scrambled duck egg, morels (mushroom), goat feta and green bean salad- the eggs were textured like hummus and there was a frothy white sauce squiggled on top. 2) Scallops, brussel sprouts, peanut, and grapefruit- two scallops and two juicy pieces of grapefruit with a sprinkle of peanuts and brussel sprouts. Good, but expensive at $15 and not worth it. 3) Grilled quail, duck liver dirty rice, charred leek, hoe cake- the two pieces of quail were so plump and stuffed with dirty rice. The hoe cake was okay, and the dish came with a poached quail egg. 4) Cream of artichoke, gruyere fritters, white anchovy- the cream was like eating a rich, thick soup. The gruyere fritters were good and the anchovy came curled up like snails. Overall, I think the food was amazing and creative.

The donburi was a giant order and I can see it being great value for anyone looking for a quick lunch. The takoyaki came in these interesting shells. From their kitchen, you can see these takoyaki being fried in a wide deep fryer which gives them an extra crispy taste. While I prefer the soft shell takoyaki from traditional grills, this one was pretty good too. The octopus inside was a sizable portion and noticeable in every ball.

With its fantastic atmosphere and excellent menu there's going to be something for everyone.  Being located on East Hastings not far out of the DTES there is still definitely some \\"local color\\" around in the neighborhood, and the abandoned Canadian Tire across the street may not be the most desirable thing to stare at from the patio, but really there is nothing else in the area that comes even close to matching what this place has to offer.\\n\\nThe menu and things can be a little confusing - Nuba is open weekend mornings for brunch, but not till 11:00.  Brunch is mexican-style and quite excellent.  We arrived at about 10:45 not realizing the later start, but the staff were pleasant and sat us anyhow though we couldn't put our food orders in till the kitchen opened.  Coffee was no problem though, and theirs is quite good.\\n\\nFor brunch I had the Molletes - first time I'd ever had anything like that.  I got mine with chorizo - it comes crumbled in underneath the cheese.  I mean what's not to like - good cheese, beans and chorizo? Count me in!\\n\\nAfternoons are a bit funny - their dinner menu doesn't start till 5:00.  First time we went there around 4:45 and never even knew they had a more complete menu until after we had finished our food, though the \\"limited\\" afternoon sheet had plenty of tasty treats like the meat and cheese plates.  Those are fantastic btw.  Second time back for dinner we got there more like 6:30 so dinner service was in full swing and we got the full menu.\\n\\nI had the market fish the second time, which was a fabulous snapper dish.  The portion size was totally awesome, I definitely got more than I was expecting.  The dish was super tasty again too - I can definitely say I've never had any problems with the food here whatsoever.\\n\\nI'm a definite beer connoisseur and Nuba doesn't disappoint here either - they have an extensive selection of bottled beer.  There's LOTS to choose from. \\n\\nThe one big negative I will have to give them is related to service unfortunately.  The last two times I was there I had no issues - we got served promptly, the staff had great attitudes and things went well.  The first time I was there though it was a complete and total disaster.  Since I haven't seen a repeat I won't get in to it, but the long and the short of it was some people in our group had already finished their food before others had even managed to order drinks, the bartender was doubling as a server (which he wasn't very good at) and in the end we had to tell them to charge us for stuff since a half dozen things were missing from the bill.

A couple of nights ago I went to yet another contemporary version of a fine dining restaurant in the city or environs of Boston serving a form of  \\"New American\\" cuisine.  After I leave these places I am always awed - not by the food or the ambiance- but by the lack of impression of any kind I am left with.   The food is generally well prepared (thank you Yelp), but so eclectic that its intent becomes murky.   The best of the servers are either nice, or a little snarky - a model of behavior I imagine is meant to make the customer feel comfortable.  This type of service leaves me feeling like I just handed over the better part of my paycheck to a Starbucks barrista.  It doesn't feel special.\\nWhich leaves me asking this question - What is wrong with my city that it is unable to support a fine dining establishment like Locke Ober?  Much has been written about the demise of this restaurant following the loss of chef Lydia Shire and I don't need to repeat it.   Recalling conversations with my peers about this restaurant - Peer: \\"Where should I take so and so for his birthday?\\"  Me: How about Locke Ober?\\"  The response was almost always 'I've heard of it, but I've never been there'.   \\nPerhaps my tastes are unique in this day and age, but I loved so many things about this restaurant.   I loved the fact that the restaurant was down an alley - who knew Boston had alleys?  I loved the little bar with its dark wood and old oil paintings; as well as the bar tenders who mixed solid unpretentious versions of classic cocktails.  And the service was perfect.  This was the personable yet polite service my grandparents would appreciate; the type of service where even when you are blind drunk from multiple gin martinis and groping your companion in full view of the other diners, you are still treated with such reverence that you get the mistaken impression that you are not an alcoholic, but merely a valued customer.   And the food was good; the rich delicious franc-ophied fine dining food of another era.  And the best part of all: Locke Ober was all these things without a hint of irony.  \\nWhat kills me is that like my grandparents generation, this type of dining is dying off and it is probably not coming back.   My grandparents were born during the depression, so they like their parents were tight.  If they dropped a lot of money on a restaurant they sure as hell were going to be treated well and by golly they were going to dress up.  But, they were also flawed, complex human beings who understood the joy of pushing social boundaries in the tight confines of a dinner jacket.  Now we are creating a world for ourselves that is bland despite all of its comforts.   And, if we keep going in this direction I fear the only difference between dinner at home and an evening spent at a fine dining restaurant is that we will be poorer for it."},{"name":"bartaco","address":"969 Marietta St NW","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Fantastic!

It's a really cute concept, inexpensive and opened by a cute celebrity chef. Unfortunately, every time I go here my meal is always kind of hit or miss. The veggie burger has vastly improved since they first opened. It's got a nice crust on the outside and a \\"meat-like\\" texture on the inside. The taste is a little boring and bland though. The crab burger is also only okay. The crabmeat tasted semi-fresh and was pretty bland. Even with the slaw that came on it the taste was still pretty underwhelming and had the faintest bit of fishiness.  I don't eat beef but any time I go here with real burger eaters, they always enjoy their food. The sweet potato tots are super greasy so I usually forgo those in favor of french fries which are really, really good and are served with ketchup or a smoky mayo which if they would just serve with that crab burger it would probably be the best thing ever. The Krispy Kreme milkshake is so good. It has actual chopped up donuts in the milkshake. The Nutella/Burnt Marshmellow milkshake is not favorite. I didn't get the hazelnut flavor of Nutella. It just tasted like a chocolate milkshake to me with some marshmellows on top.

All of us opted for the 6 course tasting menu for $45/each.  The kitchen designs the menu for you and it's served family style.  So you don't know what you will be getting.\\nPre-dinner drinks ordered, two of party were not drinking that night and ordered the sparkling water.  They placed it on the window sill when poured and it was difficult for us to fill up our glasses unless the waiter was on the ball..which he sort of wasn't.  There are other bottles there so it was difficult to tell which was ours.  That little annoyance aside...\\n\\nThe food.  Wow.  Amazing.  I personally enjoyed all of them but for me the two that stood out was the stinging nettle agnolotti simple tossed in butter..it was amazing and tasted just like the version we had in Italy a few months ago.  The lamb 3 ways was my other standout.  Rack of lamb, lamb sausage and the start - roasted lamb shoulder.  Tender, juicy and flavourful!\\n\\nThe two courses that didn't do it for me as much was the gnocchi with mushrooms, maybe it's just me but I like my gnocchi a little more firm.  For all four of us we found dessert a bit underwhelming which was too bad because they actually had a really nice selection on the menu.  We were given a firm chocoloate pudding-like square with marinated sour cherries and a berry tart in a berry sauce - sorry couldn't recall.  I was still thinking of the lamb :)\\n\\nIt was also interesting to see what the other tables beside us were getting as it seemed most people opted for the set menu.

No one complained about the beer but also no one was talking it up as one of the best in Portland. \\n\\nI tried the Burger and frys off the late night menu. Compared to other menus for late night fare it was sparse but they had a few things given a Happy Hour style pricing. The burger at 10 dollars with 3 dollars for the frys side was getting up there but I tried it out. Sadly I am going to agree with a bunch of other reviewers who have given a ding to this place for the prices here. I felt the patty was rather small, the bun not well sourced, and the special house made ketchup not well seasoned for my taste. I dont know where they come up with 13 bucks for this burger and frys that you can have bested down the street at Red Robin. Sure these are natural cut frys but mine were soggy and limp and lacked the slight crunch I enjoy in a good fry. There might be other good things on this menu but this one experience will make it hard for me to want to come back and try again.\\n\\nSide note: service was easy on this Saturday night at 10 and our party was one of only 3 in the whole bar.

The tater tots were crispy and delicious, and something I almost always get either as a bar snack of to accompany my meal.  The grilled squid and gnocchi were tasty, even if stuffing a squid with oxtail seems odd, and the gnocchi was correctly fluffy.  The Caesar salad was a head of romaine with a tasty Caesar dressing, the only thing I didn't like was that it was served with an anchovy-paste toast that was too greasy.  My dining companion got a shrimp salad she enjoyed.  For dessert, we got the baked Alaska, which the bartender was kind enough to light on fire for us.  \\n\\nThe bill, with drinks and tip came to about $130, not cheap, but one shouldn't expect a bargain at Locke Ober.\\n\\nIn my opinion, the carved wood paneling is the best part of this place and merits a special visit.\\n\\nValet parking is available."},{"name":"FLIP burger boutique","address":"1587 Howell Mill Rd","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Checked it out last with night with my new crush...He drove and opened the doors so Flip Burger was getting credit before it was even due.

Leaving me with nothing positive to say in my \\"final\\" review of them. I give them 1 star overall and won't be going back. I paid them good money for their food and it was so bad my wife and I had to go eat somewhere else on more than one occasion. Very frustrating! We gave them chances, but no more. This level of consistent failure is simply unacceptable.\\n\\nSome of the negative highlights from my visits since the first review include: \\n\\n- Bones and Cartilage ruined every chicken enchilada I ever ordered here, and would effect any dish with the shredded/pulled chicken. Disclaimers on their menu state, \\"3. The shredded chicken some times may have some bones & cartilages\\" - Is that some kind of poor excuse to let the kitchen staff off easy for not doing a good job of sorting through the inedible bones and cartilage and removing it from the food to be served to paying customers? I think it is, and my wife and I are highly offended after having 50% or more of every chicken enchilada at this place being inedible due to huge chunks of cartilage and bone (and that's not taking into account undesirable flavors, more on that below)! What would Chef Gordon Ramsay have to say to his kitchen staff about this policy? You know he wouldn't let it fly one second and no good restaurateur in their right mind would, either. It's just laziness, at the expense of the customer. Most of the Mexican restaurants around town try hard and do a very thorough job at removing bone and cartilage from their pulled chicken meat, but Casa Maria obviously puts zero effort into it, except for their little disclaimer as noted above. \\n\\n- Flavors: Bland, watered down, or downright disgusting has been the general experience. Examples include Chicken Mole enchilada that tasted like canned cat or dog food smells - the chicken didn't taste good and the mole sauce had zero mole flavor, more like a greasy brown sauce. We already mentioned the bone and cartilage ruining their pulled chicken dishes like the Chicken Mole enchilada. Watered down sauces and guacamole. The verde sauce didn't look or smell or taste like verde, it was watery and had a little green color, but that was it. The guacamole was watered down and flavorless to the point that it seemed it was either pre-prepared for restaurants or was just about expired. The lettuce and tomato served with the guac was also turning and was not fresh. The beans tasted like the lard in them was starting to turn rancid. I know the economic times are tough, but that's no excuse to stoop to these levels with keeping old food around to make an extra buck. \\n\\n- Temperature: The hot foods are supposed to be hot and the cold foods are supposed to be cold. Not at Casa Maria. Everything from the Chili con Queso, to the Rice, to the Beans, to the Enchilada to the Chili Rellleno has been only partially warmed up, to such an extent that the inside of the foods are chilled from refrigeration and the cheese has not even melted inside the food. This tells me a couple of things: 1. that the food is prepared ahead of time and is plated and merely partially warmed in the oven versus being freshly made to order and served bubbly hot. 2. that I might get sick from bacteria that would otherwise have been killed by properly bringing the food to temp before serving. \\n\\n- (In)Consistency: The first time I ate here I gave them 4 stars because they did enough things right. Ever since it's been consistently horrible, to the extent that most of the food is inedible and is left on the plate uneaten. \\n\\n- Service: The service was fine the first visit, but ever since it has been almost unfriendly. The management doesn't even ask how the food was, nor does the server. I don't think they care - they got our money. \\n\\n- City of Austin Health Department Scores: are inconsistent. The most recent was 94, but prior to that they are all near-failing or failing grades: 74, 72, 60, 73. \\n\\nI hope they can get their restaurant in order and address these serious problems, but I probably won't be going back to find out after all of these bad experiences.

True, my actual German friends call this place an \\"embarrassment of Bavarian s**t,\\" that doesn't represent really modern Germany, but I don't really care.\\n\\nWhen you come here, GET THE BUFFET.  It's the best deal for the money and largely has everything that you want anyway.  Plus you get a dessert for a discounted price (used to be a free cream puff with every buffet order...stupid inflation...).\\n\\nSome things to note when coming here: \\n\\n1.  Schmidt's is a frequent stop for senior citizen traveling bus tours, so if you see a large tour bus out front, be prepared to wait awhile or just come back again when you have more time.  \\n\\n2.  If you are coming with a group, they generally won't seat you until your entire party is there.  It's annoying, but I've been coming here almost my whole life, so I've just sort of become used to it.  \\n\\n3.  As for the parking that other's have mentioned, it's German Village so it's just a given that parking is going to be an issue.  Just park in one of their lots or pay attention to the street signs where you shouldn't park or where the streets require a special resident parking sticker.  If you do that, you'll probably be OK.  I've personally never heard of a $500 parking ticket in Columbus, but I'll take another reviewer's word for it (and believe me, I've gotten my fair share of parking tickets working downtown for so many years).\\n\\nAgain, and as other reviews have written, this isn't really true German food.  But, I'm a Columbus native who is from a Swiss German American family so just I don't really care about authenticity when I'm eating here.  On holidays my family eats sausage, potatoes, and sauerkraut, and all of the other things that Schmidt's has to offer.  So for me, eating this food here is like a nice memory of being a ittle kid watching my grandparents polka at weddings.  Or coming here every year on my birthday and getting my picture taken with those ridiculous wooden cutouts.  Schmidt's is one of those restaurants that holds a special place in my heart and probably always will."},{"name":"Amrheins","address":"80 W Broadway","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"Superb service.

She also brought my husband something else than he'd ordered. We got it semi-sorted, and were okay with that. But then my brother-in-law showed up. He's 19, and the place is a bar, but we were all eating *dinner* and none of us were drinking and they still wouldn't let him in. I understand that they have to uphold some rules or whatever, but the kid wanted to eat, looks about 25, and wasn't wearing a coat. They finally let him come into the entryway while we finished our dinner without him. The part that pissed me off most was that the manager refused to come talk to us, even though our food had been messed up and we had an issue we wanted to resolve. That's a definite mark of poor service--the manager should always be willing to talk to a customer, even if it's to let them down gently.

We actually heard the owner tell his employee, \\"feel free to lock the door if we get to busy while I'm gone\\".  Who says that as an owner?  I get being understaffed, but at least explain to the customers there will be a wait if they choose to stay vs. locking the door.  I asked for Ranch to go along with my calzone and they indicated they charge extra for that.  I was okay with paying for it but had to wait on line again to get my ranch to be charged the 54 cents.  My calzone was at that point lukewarm and the dough was WAY undercooked.  Also probably half the size of the ones you would get at Homeslice or Saccones.  We also got two sides salads that were supposed to be two different sizes and both came out in a plastic box and appeared to be the same size.  We were expecting them to be different sizes as they were different prices and to be on plates!  We also heard customers who were outside told your order is up and to come and get it.

Well, I should've. The location is great and it definitely seems upscale but it's not. Everything we had was just fine. A friend and I wanted to each try a different chowder and then share a bunch of other small plates. However, EVERYTHING CAME ALL AT ONCE and we were seated at a small table. The waiter didn't even apologize or try to bring some of the cold dishes back like the oysters or burrata so she could eat her chowder. Keyword: her. The burrata came with sad kale and quinoa which wasn't great. And the heirloom tomatoes were both hard and squishy at the same time. The oysters were great! And so was the wine! Her chowder was just fine. The burrata was fine as well. We are everything and then I just sat there waiting for my chowder to arrive but our waiter didn't come back for quite some time. When he finally did, I reminded him about the Lobster Bisque Chowder and he literally said \\"Oh, I thought you were kidding. That you were sharing everything.\\" Ummmm why would you put the chowder in front of her when we were sharing and only provide one spoon. And why would I say, \\"ok, I want the lobster and she wants the New England\\" and be kidding. He cleared the table and brought over a new soup spoon and then another server came over and took my spoon away. When I told her I still had soup coming, she said \\"ok\\" and walked away. Still no spoon. He finally brought it out and the server basically dropped the Bowl in front of me like they wanted us to leave. I finally got a spoon when I realized there's a lobster tail, shell and all, with no way of getting the meat out. It was like pulling teeth trying to get utensils. The bisque was, well, fine. Not great. We ordered the chocolate lava cake because we thought, this should be good and it was so dry and the ice cream was rock hard.

When my girlfriend got her food after 3 bites she noticed what seemed to be a body hair in her food. Brought this to our servers attention who was willing to do whatever it took to make it right, until the owner stepped in very argumentative not willing to really do anything but remove it from the bill, she also argued that it wasn't possible for hair to be in my girlfriends food.  now I've been a chef for 14 years and I can tell you that it is extremely possible for hair to fall in food\\n.

I figured that I'll never be justify the prices at O Ya, so this is about as close as I'll get to eating there.  This burger was amazing.  The tuna was just lightly seared to perfection, the spicy mayo and pickled ginger were amazing, and the greens and kabayaki drizzle topped it all off.  The only gripe is that it's served with potato chips.  Come on Parish, a burger this good deserves a more noteworthy side!\\n\\nMy wife ordered Rowdy's Famous Chicken Sandwich.  It definitely lived up to all the hype on Yelp.  It may or may not be a heart attack on a bun (breaded chicken, applewood smoked bacon, swiss and cheddar cheeses), but it's definitely worth every calorie.

I absolutely LOVE Indian but don't eat it that often for some reason. I did some Yelp-ing, and decided to try the Punjab Palace. Since I live in Beacon Hill, I would normally not make the B-line trek out to college student central, but I work at Packard's Corner so it wasn't a big deal. \\n\\nI took my boyfriend (who somehow has never eaten Indian food before) with me. He loves trying new foods, but did put up a bit of a fight because he loathes going to places that don't have full bars. \\n\\nAnyways, I persuaded him, and off we went. We each got a glass of red, and ordered some of the garlic nan. It was ok, although rather bland, despite the copious amounts of garlic. Nothing to write home about, but definitely acceptable. The decor was also nothing to write home about--it's sparse and generic. However, unless I'm going out for a romantic or special meal, I don't care what the place looks like, as long as the food is good! \\n\\nI got the Channa Saagwala (chickpea, spinach, yogurt, spices), and my boyfriend got the Chicken Tikka Masala; both came with rice. \\n\\nI LOVED my dish. It was amazing, and I ate almost the entire thing, despite being very full towards the end. It wasn't greasy at all, and was very flavorful and perfectly seasoned. There weren't really that many chickpeas in it, but those that were there were cooked perfectly. I hate when you get chickpeas that are either undercooked or too mushy. These ones were perfect. \\n\\nThe portions are big, though they come out in those silver pots that look really small and belie the copious amounts of food that are in them. \\n\\nBoyfriend liked his dish a lot, but I think he liked mine better! I tried a bite of his, and it was good, although I prefer Indian dishes that have more spices and herbs. \\n\\nWe got dessert, which I rarely do. I don't have much of a sweet tooth, so desserts usually don't appeal to me. However, I HAD to try their coconut ice cream, because I love all things coconut. My icecream was incredible. It was really, really delicious, and it was definitely made from real coconut and not just flavored like it. Boyfriend ordered the kulfi (slow cooked, homemade icecream) which he liked and which I thought was ok. I wasn't a huge fan, but again, I'm not a sweets person and had just eaten coconut ice cream so I was on sweets overload.

The bitter cuts both the edge of the alcohol and the fruitiness of vermouth. The apple and the cinnamon take the edge off the bitter. The flavors of the other ingredients do not go away.

Second, the waitstaff, all men by the way, not a problem but they took FOREVER to come over. I'm not into comical dining, they were very old fashion singing and whistling old songs from the 40's. My husband loved it, me not so much. It was a bit obnoxious.\\nThis place is known for not giving out menu's, i've heard and remember that if you dine there you are a regular and therefor not needing a menu. \\nSo we opt for the combo: sausage and lamb. The sausage was so over cooked and hard my knife couldn't even cut through it. The lamb, fatty as hell and over cooked. \\nNow lets get to the pizza; it was so over cooked that the crust couldn't even be broken in half, hard like a rock. \\nThe first 3/4 of the pizza was soggy has hell and the rest well hard as a rock. \\nDISGUSTING in a nutshell. \\n\\nI will never return again. VERY DISAPPOINTED."},{"name":"Santarpio's Pizza","address":"111 Chelsea St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"I just visited Boston for the first time and my boyfriend took me to Santarpio's to experience \\"the best pizza ever\\".

The meat comes entirely from naturally raised livestock farms and is antibiotic free. The burritos and burrito bowls come with white or brown cilantro lime rice and vegetarian black beans or pinto beans (I love options).  The toppings are plentiful and typically fresh.  Chips and salsa are not included so you have to ask for them on the side. I usually get out for around $10.

Food takes a few minutes to come out however I was enjoying a Castle Island Keeper and had nice company so all good with that. \\n\\nWe always start with healthy summer rolls. They cut the rolls here which is nice. The dipping sauce I thought could have been more peanutty but thats just my taste. The Tom Gai soup was tasty but not the best I have had. A bit more coconut and a bit more chicken would have done it. On the other hand the crispy Nisa's duck, a chef specialty was amazing. The fat was gristled perfectly yet the meat was moist. The veggie Pad Thai was also very good. We took quite a lot home.

We had 3 or 4 different waitresses helping us at different points, which may sound good but ending up making me feel like they didnt know (or care) what was going on.  None of them were particularly friendly and our table was crammed up next to the bar (even though it wasn't that crowded and there were plenty of open tables near the back).\\n\\nI am a vegetarian and as the veggie options are lacking, I ordered the Elephant Walk sandwich (basically a veggie omelette on a baguette).  The bread was delicious but the sandwich itself was completely tasteless (and cost $12!).  I could have dumped a load of salt on it and it probably still wouldn't have helped much (and just tasted like salt).\\n\\nOne note: they have an extensive beer menu, which is nice but a little unwieldy.  I wish they would offer pairings with the sandwiches (like restaurants do with wines) to help figure out what might be good to order.\\n\\nOverall I was just disappointed."},{"name":"Navarre","address":"10 NE 28th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"I am torn about Navarre.  The space is TINY, with almost zero decoration (less the oils and food on shelves along the walls - which I am sure is less about d√©cor and more about space restrictions), and there are way too many tables to comfortably accommodate people.  Small can have a ton of ambiance (The Farm/Le Pigeon), but Navarre is lacking in this regard.  That being said, the line of patrons waiting was consistent from the time we arrived at 7:20 until we left well after 10pm.  I highly recommend getting a group of 6 together so that you can make a reservation, or you will be waiting for hours (and they have no bar to bide your time at).  \\nDrinks:\\nNavarra has an impressive and affordable wine selection (two full pages), with bottles starting in the $20's as well as dozens by the glass.  One unique thing they do (and I wish more restaurants would participate in) is offer wine by the  bottle and  1/2 bottle.  Sometimes these amounts are just right, and it is always nice to have the options.\\nFood:\\nSince it is a tapas restaurant, everything is ordered to share (served in small or large size).  As most of the best restaurants, the menu changes often based on seasonal availability (all produce comes from their CSA with 47th Ave Farm), so it is separated into traditional items and then specials.  They hand you a checklist style menu and have you go at it.  It's a bit overwhelming deciding what to order, but luckily they offer a prix fix Chef's Choice.  I highly recommend this to get the best overall understanding of the food offerings, as well as a great value ($28!).  Also worth noting is that we had a Pescatarian and Gluten-Free needs with us, and there was enough menu items to accommodate both of them.  Served over several courses, the dishes were all nicely plated and in ample portions.\\nTo start us off, we were served a plethora of hearty chunks of Ken's Artisan bread with \\"grassy\\" olive oil for dipping...this combination has yet to disappoint and was the perfect way to begin the meal.\\nNo menu of any sort is offered when you choose the Chef's Choice option, and although I think the idea is fun, I do like to know what to expect on my plate or how much I will be served.  Many restaurants have menus that change daily/weekly, but they are still able to provide you a list of what you will be receiving.  After badgering the wait staff a few times, I finally got them to send me home with a marked up menu highlighting the items we ate throughout the night.  \\nHere is a list of the menu items from our dinner, with an asterisk next to the winners and a ? next to the one loser:\\nRadishes w/French Butter\\nFarro w/Black Trumpet Mushrooms & Parsley\\nMiners Lettuce w/Pickled Carrot\\nCountry Pork Pate* A favorite of everyone at the table - not overly creamy/heavy, perfect consistency.\\nCornish Game Hen Escabetx Salad ?  Way too gamey for my taste.\\nCrab Cakes* I think they must have caught this that morning - freshest tasting crab cakes I have had.\\nCauliflower w/Spanish Paprika\\nPotato & Nettle Gratin\\nSteamed Clams* Could rival mussels from Brussels any day!\\nLeg of Lamb* Simply marvelous...best prepared lamb in Portland.\\nIn true European fashion, dinner at Navarre is an event...courses were spaced so far apart at times we thought the meal was over.  But then, ah yes, more goodness arrives.  It was a great opportunity to spend an evening chatting with friends, drinking great local wines, and enjoying some amazing food.  I am not sure exactly why, but we received a free French cheese plate (probably a mistake from the kitchen) AND our deserts were comped (maybe it was due to the long waits for the courses, but this was actually perfect for us).  In any case, it was much appreciated.\\nDesert: \\nRed Velvet Cake - After seeing our neighbors order this, I knew that I must have it.  Although it was good, this was not excellent, which is what I was expecting based on the amazing presentation.\\nDried Fruit Tart w/mixed Nuts - Now here is where you should indulge.  This was so unique and the flavors were bursting...the pear is what did it for me.  It was like a turnover, only even better!\\nOrdered drip coffees to accompany, and they were perfectly brewed.\\nService/Pricing:\\nInterestingly, the wait staff also has a tapas-style \\"sharing\\" format, so throughout you meal you are served by multiple people.  Confusing, but it worked out just fine.  Our initial server was knowledgeable about the wine menu, and helpful in going over the menu choices as well.  \\nFor price point, I have to say Navarre is a fantastic value.  For two of us to have the Chef's Choice menu and two nicer bottles of wine (desert was free) our bill was $140.  Totally reasonable for this caliber of restaurant.\\nNavarre is spectacular cuisine.  I am glad we tried it, and we had a wonderful dining experience.  The dishes were delicious combinations of high-quality, locally sourced ingredients.  I do have to admit that it pales in comparison to our beloved Toro Bravo."},{"name":"bartaco","address":"969 Marietta St NW","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"You know that scene in When Harry Met Sally, yea you know the one I mean... well when tasting the guac and salsa here I'm pretty sure my table did an exact rendition.

Its also great that you can order the tacos mix and match, and the lunch platter that includes a salad and three tacos for $10 is incredibly easy, cheap and filling. \\n\\nThe food speaks for itself though.  Can I mention the guac again - I have to, it is so good and so fresh.  The small portion (for only $5) is insanely generous.  The tacos themselves are also very good, super fresh and tasty.  They all come with their own toppings, and are a pretty good size.  The favorites were the fish tacos, the steak tacos and the pork shoulder.

The samosas were SO good - not overly greasy and the inside wasn't too mushy. The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is there was no coconut naan and I only tried one of the veggie entr√©es.

This restaurant was impressionable from the start.  The aroma of spices in the restaurant made my taste buds dance.  The Ethiopian servers are beautiful, friendly, and helpful.  The atmosphere was lively and casual.  It included indoor and outdoor seating and was filled with a variety of people from all over town.  The sunroom has a 'tree of life' in the middle of the room that adds to the ambiance of the restaurant.  Most importantly, the food was DELICIOUS! \\n\\nWe ordered the sambusa (pastries stuffed with meat) for an appetizer, which was reasonably priced $3.00 for two rolls. They were well seasoned and tasted good, but were not the most authentic--I prefer the triangular flaky pastry over the fried egg roll wrappers. We ordered the vegetarian platter and pick three tibs platter (lamb, ribeye, and tilapia) for four people. I would highly recommend ordering the aforementioned to have the opportunity to try a variety of foods. The presentation was nice--the vegetarian dishes surrounded the meats and fish in the center all on a bed of injera (see attached photo). The meat was deliciously seasoned and grilled. The fish was the best tilapia I have ever had at an Ethiopian restaurant! My friend loved the gomen (Ethiopian collard greens) and we loved the tomato fit fit (tomato with pieces of injera mixed in)--I could eat a whole bowl of this delicious goodness! The injera was very fresh and yummy! Our server was attentive and made sure she refilled our injera regularily while we devoured the dishes.\\n\\nI debated trying the kitfo (raw ground beef) for the first time, but as adventurous as I am, I have only had 'carpaccios' and 'tartares' at high end places--I had a flight in the afternoon and was afraid to fly and have possible gastrointestinal issues. However, I was very satisfied with my culinary experience at this restaurant that I may try it next time!\\n\\nDon't let the online menu discourage you from trying this fabulous restaurant! The menu online is missing quite a few items, but the menu at the restaurant has a lot of items to choose from along with definitions on the side for those who are unfamiliar with Ethiopian cuisine. The only thing this restaurant is missing is mouthwatering wat (stew, curry) dishes. I would probably give this restaurant five stars if they added wat dishes.

I was really looking forward to the food here as everything looked delicious on Yelp. We were seated quickly in one of the outdoor seating tables. The place was filled on a Sunday evening. Our waiter was prompt and attentive. \\n\\nHere's a few things to consider: \\n\\n- The Ethiopian beer (as with any other nationally branded beer) is absolutely mediocre. Nothing to taste here, try something else. \\n- One entree can be easily shared between two/three people. I guess you already know that. \\n- I tried a little bit of tilapia tibs and it was good. Vegetarian platter was good too. \\n\\nThis is a decent place to satisfy your Ethiopian food cravings.

I don't have much to add to the other reviews. All I can say is that this place wins for me in that it has: \\n\\n(1) Fast cart service. I don't always like how at those gigantic dining hall type dim sum places it takes hours for a cart to get to your table.\\n\\n(2) Friendly waiters and waitresses. They were a bit pushy as other reviewers mentioned, but I'd rather they come frequently than not enough.

It was \\"D√≠a Mundial de la Tapa\\" (World Tapas Day), which featured seven specials appetizers plus the pear dessert and a Vi√±a Real Rosado (ros√©) wine from the prominent Rioja region ($8 the glass, $32 the bottle). \\n\\nOff this special menu I greatly enjoyed Gambas al Ajillo ($7), a generous small plate of medium-sized shrimp in a garlic brandy sauce. I also thought well of the slightly bitter Espinaca Catalana, spinach saut√©ed with onions and white wine topped with feta cheese Catal√°n style (the northeast province where Barcelona is located), $5.50), one of 30 tapas on the regular menu. \\n\\nLess successful was the big pile of Sushito-style fried \\"Padron Peppers\\" ($7.50) - way too salty and also over-priced for this now de rigueur appetizer. Google told me these peppers are from the municipality of Padr√≥n in the province of A Coru√±a, Galicia, in northwestern Spain. My request for bread brought a whole little loaf of bland white pan.\\n\\nOddly for a restaurant that specializes in Spanish and Italian dishes - and sometimes fails at executing its very expansive offerings - its menu is devoid of needed tildes: those swirls over 'n's\\", which are necessary because √± is a separate letter in Spanish, and also accents where called for. \\n\\nDoubly odd because a Spaniard, Antonio Rullo, most nights supervises the establishment: one large dining room, the outdoor dining area - thankfully not on a street like many outdoor \\"patios\\" in Boulder but rather hidden back beyond a Lucky's supermarket on a quiet plaza -  and a cozy back bar, muy espa√±ol. My waiter, fresh out of CU-Boulder, proffered smooth, confident service that greatly added to a great dinner.

Once you have tried the real deal like I have at Cafe du Monde  in New Orleans, then the ones in Disney will surely disappoint.

He suggested we try The Breakfast Club, being in the mood for some breakfast foods cooked on deliciously greasy flat top grills, I figured it'd be a good choice. \\n\\nIt was a fairly short walk from his apartment, which is convenient because it was freezing cold this particular morning. When we arrived the line was out the door in the tiny trailer turned 80's movies themed cafe. We stood in line seeing the inside completely packed, an inside decorated with numerous movie posters (All 80's, lot of John Hughes). I was also surprised at the number of quality televisions present inside the restaurant, so while standing and waiting we could watch the football game. \\n\\nOur server was quite nice, and moved well considering how little space is available for free movement in a packed trailer. The milkshake I ordered was both delicious and hearty. The food wasn't anything spectacular, but serviceable for the morning. \\n\\nNow, what I've described above is clearly at least a 3-star experience. So, why would I give it 1-star?

Mmmmmmmm, mac and cheese)!\\n\\nAnd... we were incredibly disappointed. I could barely find a HINT of chicken in my chicken pot pie. And it was overly sweet with too much sweet corn. And his mac and cheese... it was supposed to be this glorious marriage of truffle oil and creamy cheese that would send my lactose intolerancy to the hills. And instead, it was this bland dry concoction of a dish that made a poor representation for the mac and cheeses of the world. I hate it when dishes aren't properly spiced, and the mac and cheese needed about half of the salt shaker's contents spread liberally over it before it tasted like anything except dry pasta. Blegh. But I still liked his dish over my overly sweet \\"chicken\\" pot pie. We both barely ate half of our food. I was sadly disappointed. And yet still thought our waitress was SO cute.
