I grew up in St.Louis where some of the first ones opened as \\"St.Louis Bread Company\\" before they expanded nationwide. \\nMost of the time I go here because as I've traveled and lived in many states, I knew I could go to these restaurants for consistent healthy options. Almost every other place I've lived that has held true. Consistent with serving sizes, fresh produce, decent soups and sandwiches. This location? Ummm not so much. To be fair, I've not been inside this location. I've used drive through twice. Both times for my favorite salad. And they are batting ZERO. \\nThe first time I asked specifically for dressing to be on the side. I'm not even sure why that's a necessary step since it is a to go salad and lettuce will get gross if you dress it and let it sit a while before eating it. But I asked specifically anyway just in case. I got the salad home and it was dressed and had more dressing on the side. My problem is, I think almost all restaurants overdress salads to the point you can't taste the ingredients. So this was a horrific fail. I sent a review directly to Panera via the email they sent me asking about my recent visit (I use a Panera card to get points/freebies/etc). I never heard a thing back from them about it. \\nWell tonight I wanted something fresh. I decided to give it another try. Again, same salad, same request if dressings on the side. This time they were indeed put on the sides. Four dressing cups for a very very small portion of a \\"large\\" Spicy Thai Chicken Salad. \\nI get it that it was almost 8 pm, but in champions gate which is are resort and vacationer filled area your ingredients shouldn't be diminished to that point. And if they are, tell the customer when they order and do not sell them a large salad with 4 small slices of chicken in it, hardly any of the fire roasted vegetables and only filling the to go container up mid to two thirds full. (Mostly of lettuce and the wonton strip things that I eat around for the most part). \\nThe containers they use for their to go salads are different than any other Panera I've ever had around the nation. Instead of the large rectangular box with a window in top it's a clamshell style round plastic that holds much less than what a large salad did in other locations. \\nAlthough I love Panera, from reading a few other reviews of even inside this location, I don't think I'll be going back again.

The Oreos don't crunch which I prefer. The bacon maple bar was also delish though I wish the bacon was sprinkled evenly on top instead of just two skinny slices of bacon. The voodoo doll which I think is most commonly associated with voodoo donuts on social media was a bit of a let down. It's most definitely because of the shape but the donut was so unevenly filled.

Said the place was packed outside (not my problem) and she would go ask the kitchen. Here's the thing. This is BBQ and sides. I think it's safe to assume that all of (or almost all of) the food is made ahead of time. So why is the kitchen SO SLOW? We've had this problem many times. We order and wait 30+ minutes for our food to arrive. When our waitress came back she was in tears because I'm sure all her tables were complaining. We got our food 10 minutes later.

Was it really Neopolitan creation? Was it a product of the Greek soliders? Was it Mr. Lombardi in Little Italy?  \\n\\nWho knows. And frankly, I could give less than two flying horse craps where it came from. All I know is that it's here, it's now and some of the most delicious triangular slices of sweet, sweet heaven are created at Home Slice pizza on South Congress in...out of all places...The Great Nation of Texas (TM)...specifically Austin.  \\n\\nPizza is one of those things...so simple, yet like William Wallace's giant-ass claymore. One edge contains the power of creating the most perfect meal which could, depending on your pizza preferences, provide you with sustenance from all four food groups in one nice compact triangle.  Genius. The other edge contains the potential for disaster. If one were to visualize beheadings, disembowlings, and maimings, that is what one feels like participating in (or at least I do. Does that make me a bad person?) when just ONE of those things is out of balance in a pizza. You feel destroyed. Ripped off. Sapped of your will to live when you realize that you'd probably rather be eating a bowl full of hot garbage than the entire entire ruined pizza you've just ordered \\n\\nYou cannot have one thing wrong on a pizza without the overall experience being soiled.\\n\\nCheese on the pizza burned? CHOP OFF THE ARM.\\nSauce too sweet? Sour? Chunky? Thin? GOUGE AN EYE.\\nDough underdone? Overdone? Too chewy? BREAK 6 TOES.\\nToo little pepperoni?  Sausge to fennel-y? BEHEADINGS FOR ALL.\\n\\nAnd that, my friends, is where Home Slice is extremely successful. They make creations worthy of the yin yang symbol. When I think of Home Slice pizza, I think of Zen masters and Buddhists and bald martial arts monk dudes that are able to break brick walls with chi focused into their small toe.  \\n\\nThe owners of Home Slice have perfected the art of creating a pie so balanced that I am humbled and thankful to Darwin, Dionysus, Jesus, Buddha, Muhammad...hell, even Joseph Smith...that good pizza making genetics converged on the owners/cooks of this place and they decided to open a restaurant to serve their product in the city where I happen to live.\\n\\nI know they make amazing pizza for two reasons:\\n\\n1. I'm generally pretty picky about what goes on my pizza. If there's something I don't like on it, I won't eat it. At Home Slice, I'm happy to shove whatever they put on a pizza into my digestive system. For example, last night, there was one with pepperoni and mushrooms and one with spinach and tomatoes and some other fairly nasty non-meat vegetarian junk. But I huffed down a piece of both like I had been eating and loving mushrooms (I freakin' HATE mushrooms) and tomatoes (I'm Italian...and I hate plain tomatoes. This makes me somehow less...) since I was a wee lad. \\n\\n2. I can eat more than a couple of pieces. I'm a fairly controlled eater, but when I start eating Home Slice, it's like my stomach turns into a black void that leads to the nether world. It's like some weird kind of quantum physics happen in me where I like to imagine the equation is this:\\n\\nIf AndrewsStomachxn=y2 x 1400000(SQROOT)x-factorElecticity=isTheLumpSum of 1000(n-finity)pcs.Of.pizza, then TheLumpSum + pizzaConsumed = neverending\\n\\n...or something like that. I barely passed high school level algebra II...the bare minimum to get me into college...so cut me some slack.\\n\\n\\nBut my overall favorite pizza is, I believe, a #4, which is sausage, ricotta cheese and red peppers. While I've never attempted it, and don't ever plan on it, I'm pretty fairly certain that if, say, I had 8 minutes to consume one version of the aforementioned pizza or a tiny nuclear explosion would destry a block full of baby kittens, I could probably do it in about 6 minutes.\\n\\nOK. More likely 5.\\n\\nPlease...for all that is good and just in the world...do yourself and whomever else you know a favor and go eat at Home Slice pizza. The ONLY downside is that you'll have to wait for it. I don't think I've ever been there at a time where it's not really super busy. But I swear that it's worth it. The service is good. The atmosphere is good...albeit a little loud. They've got pretty good beer and wine there for you to sip on while you wait. It's on South Congress. And you live in Austin.

It was Seafood Platter (Fried Fish, Clams, Oysters, Scallops, Shrimp and Calamari, fries) ... \\n\\nAfter we got our order, I did not see the waitress until we were done with our food and ready for the check. Thats like 30 minutes....  I put my empty glass at the edge of the table so the waitress or busboy could  see it and refill it... but no luck, I had to deal with the oily lunch with only 1 glass of water. \\n\\nBut the most annoying thing was that the restaurant had this thick heavy fried oil smell that was soooo sickening... I had to take out my clothes right after I got home and throw it in the laundry. \\n\\nWell I would not be surprised if they've been using the same oil for cooking for that 200 years.. You just cant get the taste of the calamari or the oysters or the clams b/c of the heavy, over used, low quality canola oil they fried in...\\n\\nMaybe I had high expectations but still the place is way below avarage.."},{"name":"Mary Mac's Tea Room","address":"224 Ponce De Leon Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"I ate here on the recommendation of a work colleague I was dining with.

Seafood is great here and if you want it spicy ask for it.  \\n\\nThe service can be just ok or terrific and more times than not we just get take out because we are short on time.  The food is always good and the fresh not canned ingredients do make it cost more than your typical thai place but to us it is worth it.  So for non-typical Thai try Typhoon just order new things not tired dished you could eat anywhere.\\n\\nOh and my wine pick for Typhoon is Sokol Blosser's Evolution, a great match with Thai's spice or a nice syrah for those red wine drinkers actually matches quite well too."},{"name":"Voodoo Doughnut - Old Town","address":"22 SW 3rd Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"I was worried this place would be over-hyped, but it really wasn't!

It took us FOREVER to get there, even though we live in SW Atlanta. Little did I know, (should've checked yelp first) that there is a second location like 3 miles from our house. Sheesh. Oh well. So anyway, we go, find out it's cash only, have to go to the most horrific excuse for a Kroger I've ever seen up the street, and come back to finally order our food. I am not a fan of fish and I'm allergic to half the things that live in the ocean, so I ordered one of the few chicken items on the menu - the 4 pc tenders with fries. The SO got the tilapia and shrimp. \\n\\nWhile waiting for our order, we were able to take in the decor. Very hole-in-the-wall, but clean and lots of plants all around. There were a couple of older men sitting at a table selling President Obama memorabilia and Trayvon Martin shirts, along with CDs, shoes and cologne. I found all of this quite fascinating, because I had never seen anything like it. The big TV was turned to MSNBC, so we were happy catching up on the news and (left-wing) political commentary. I liked this much better than being out in the 'burbs where the mom and pop places all have it turned to Fox News. \\n\\nIt took about 20 minutes for them to make our food. The order came out perfect, with condiments added right into the box along with napkins. I thought my chicken and fries were very good. However, when I was done, I felt like I had just eaten a brick. The whole mess was much saltier and greasier than I am used to, even with fast food. Also, I picked a few bone shards out of my teeth afterward, which really grosses me out. The honey mustard was fabulous and I think it was homemade. SO loved his food. \\n\\nAll in all, an interesting experience. I think I would return and maybe try some of their sides next time.

I LOVE ramen and have tried almost all of the ramen places in Boston. Santouka is decent - above average - but doesn't compare to either Sapporo (better) or Pikaichi (much better), in my opinion. \\n\\nHaving said that, the meat at Santouka is some of the best I've had. The pork belly is very tender and flavorful. However, the rest of the ramen - broth, vegetables, etc - are not stand-outs. In addition, their ramen is pretty expensive. Most bowls are around $12, with $1 less for the smaller size and $1 for the larger size, plus extra if you want to add an egg, more meat, and so on. If you compare that to Pikaichi, where you get more noodles and a more delicious ramen bowl for less cost (a bowl is about $8-9 at Pikaichi), and I'm willing to travel to Allston for the better tasting ramen."},{"name":"Bouldin Creek Cafe","address":"1900 S 1st St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"The coffee at Bouldin  is great!"},{"name":"Poor Calvin's","address":"510 Piedmont Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4.5","text":"Food is amazing and bottomless drinks for brunch is a no brainer.

We had reservations for 5 for 7:30.  The first and biggest complaint is that the noise level is overwhelming.  You cannot have a conversation with your tablemates unless you shout.  I realize that \\"energetic\\" restaurants are trendy but this was the noisiest restaurant I have ever visited.  My voice was hoarse by the time we left from shouting above the ambient noise and the music.\\nThe service was poor.  We were seated after 8 for a 7:30 reservation.  Then for 20 minutes we were totally ignored until we finally grabbed a waiter who turned out to be a trainee.  He got us water  and then disappeared.  Five minutes later another waiter showed up and immediately started explaining the specials without asking about drinks.  So it was a good 35 to 40 minutes before we got drinks.  After that the service improved but there was no attempt to apologize for the bad start.\\nThe food was average at best.  Oysters on the half shell were good but the mignonette was warm not chilled and much to vinegary.  I ordered the scallops and they were okay but I have to say $22 for 3 scallops and nothing else is pricy.  None of my tablemates was impressed with their dinners either.  The halibut in particular was overcooked and bland.  \\nI would give this restaurant a C at best.

However, the bean dip was pretty tasty and the Monkey Wrench was delicious.  I came with a friend who had kids, and the ground floor was pretty accommodating for them; the waiters even played with the kids a bit.

To make the experience more affordable,  enjoy a leisurely Saturday afternoon cocktail (around 2pm) when the restaurant is a little slower. In the early afternoon you can usually get a table for drinks, minus a reservation. If you stay long enough, Top of the Hub is the best place to watch the Boston sunset. Sounds corny, but trust me, after a couple cocktails you'll appreciate it too. \\n\\nIf you start to get hungry, the appetizers are pretty good - but small and expensive.

These were exactly right.  Even the bacon was 5-star.   Services was friendly, informed and unobtrusive. Went back several times for lunch. While not incredible, it may be the best lunch downtown that is not Arepazo.  Sandwiches are overstuffed and tasty.  My friend raved about the un-Cobb salad and ordered it all three times.  The reason for the 5th star, though, was a bar dinner last weekend.  Aged old fashioned that was a perfect start.  My seared foie gras, while smallish, was perfectly cooked and the parsnip/vanilla puree (trust me) a perfect accompaniment.   Melt in your mouth deliciousness.  My wife's lobster poached in butter was unctuous richness.  The lobster was done very well, its flavor never hidden and the accompanying pasta was worth the price by itself.

We started coming regularly.\\n\\nFast forward a few months (this has primarily been over the past year, since the rise of the Coupon Craze brought tons of new people to Pescatore). Prices on the menu went up fairly significantly ($2-3 more per some entrees). Service got slower. Food quality went down. The whole ambiance of the place seemed to change.  For example, they no longer give out this olive oil with olive and seasonings gratis with bread. Drinks now seem to go unfilled. Food takes 2-3 times as long as it normally did. The pasta itself - in fact, the very dish we usually ordered every time! - changed taste-wise. \\n\\nIt's very disappointing: we love this place so much that we even recently went there for our anniversary. For the first time since we started coming to Pescatore, we walked away thinking not that it was great (as it was the first few times), or that it was good, or even just okay (like we felt the visit before) -- we walked away thinking it was a bad experience.\\n\\nIt's been a downhill progression over the past year.

If the friendly people seated next to us hadnt assured us that the seats were free we would have had to stand. Our service was excellent and prompt, the drinks perfectly blended again, the atmosphere was much louder though and it was a little difficult to just chat with each other. The only other downside that comes to mind is that the arm chairs in the lounge are designed for tall gentlemen to lounge with their whiskey, not for petite women to relax with their martinis.

This dish was so creamy and flavorful and delightfully spicy.  I'm really glad they made it for me.  Elements of this dish also keep coming back at me.  The cauliflower really absorbed a lot of the red curry and just exploded flavor in my mouth.\\n\\nFor they made me an impromptu napoleon with caramelized filo pumpkin puree, candied grapefruit peel, pear puree, and spiced pecans.  It was SO good.  The pumpkin was a very simple and mild, maybe even a little bland, and the candied grapefruit was very strong and tangy, so the mix of them together was incredible.

I couldn't quite figure out how I was supposed to eat it since it was so big.  After scooping out some of it and just eating it plain, I figured out my plan!  The lobster was very refreshing and the pickle that came along with it was very good too.  It was salty and sweet...a great snacking for in between bites of the lobster roll.  And the fries...YUM!  They were fried to perfection.\\n\\nOverall,  I would definitely return again for the clam chowder."},{"name":"Top of the Hub","address":"800 Boylston St, Ste 52","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"Mediocrity amidst a stunning city skyline.\\n\\nTwo things made the dining experience worthwhile. First and foremost was the view. The breathtaking views of Boston, especially at night, helped make dining at Top of the Hub a memorable experience. The second was our waiter. Our waiter was very professional, and very sociable. Not only was he always attentive and constantly checking up on us, he was very polite and open, telling us how he lost 160 pounds in a little over a year, (which of course didn't help our decision to eat desserts).\\n\\nThe food, however, was mediocre at best. For my entr√©e I had the seared tuna, but also sampled the braised lamb shank and lobster linguine.\\n\\nThe tuna dish was a seared furukake crusted Tuna with coconut rice garnished with edamame and daikon sprouts.  My first problem, which was more of a pet-peeve rather than a critique was that the menu mispelled daikon for diakon. The presentation of the dish was simple, but elegant, with the tuna placed on top of a drizzled sweet chili sauce, and with a circular mound of rice garnished next to the fish. The fish, in my opinion, was slightly lacking in flavor and could have used a slightly longer/ stronger sear. The rice was a bit mushy and lacked the coconut flavor in which it was described. Overall, the dish was mediocre but had potential. I've had furukake crusted ahi tuna which was marinated with wasabi; and when seared correctly it was delectable and far superior to this version.\\n\\nThe lamb shank was pretty good, with the meat somewhat falling off the bone. It could have been slow cooked or braised a little bit longer to make it have the right amount of tenderness, but it wasn't so bad. The lobster linguine was very ordinary, with nothing special or distinct about the dish. The linguine tasted like everyday marinara pasta, while the lobster seemed slightly overcooked, making it a tad too hard.\\n\\nFor dessert I had the caramel date pudding with vanilla bean ice cream. The ice cream was rich and decadent but as always, a great accompaniment to a dessert. The pudding, however, wasn't amazing. It was sweet and had decent flavor but seemed, again, too dry and not nearly moist enough for a pudding.\\n\\nIf you choose to come to Top of the Hub, I recommend not staying to have a fancy and very expensive meal. Rather, go spend some time at the bar or lounge, hang out with friends, listen to the band and just enjoy the wonderful view that the 52nd floor has to offer."},{"name":"Boi Brazil Churrascaria","address":"5600 International Dr","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"We were in the area visiting Disney and our hotel was nearby.

Our server made sure we understood everything and that we got any meat selection we desired. The gauchos were constantly available with new meat selections. I would say they had about a dozen different meats.\\n\\nTo start we did the salad bar. The salad bar was just okay compared to Texas de Brazil or Fogo de Chao. But seriously who goes to a churrascaria to fill up on salad. Let's get to the meat. I noticed several reviews bashing the meats for being fatty. The only meat that was \\"fatty\\" was the Picanha, but that layer of fat is supposed to be there people. The meats were very well seasoned.\\n\\nTo me the only disappointment was the cheese bread. I'm used to the cheese bread being more doughy/cheesy.

The design and decor are pleasing and fit in well with the rest of the area, even though 2UL was around before most everything else. For our meal, we shared the fried calamari to start. I had several pieces that looked to be freezer burned. The coating is a definite miss, lightly fried with some pieces dolloped in a sweet sauce, but not all. On top of that, an aioli sauce was clearly flung onto the plate landing haphazardly on the edge and didn't mesh well with the pieces covered in sweet sauce. Flavor and presentation were disappointing. Next, we both ordered the bar steak with chimichurri. It arrived in a pool of olive oil and balsamic. I enjoy olive oil, but this was just too much, it filled up the entire bowl of the shallow plate. The steak itself had good flavor, but was quite tough.

The bartender here ignored us as we sat patiently at the bar, and it got worse when a bunch of her friends came in and she started making them all personal drinks.  Eventually a waiter came to us and apologized for the wait and I ordered a couple of glasses of wine, which by the time we got them - we took right into Gracie's with the rest of our party.\\n\\nGracie's was decorated superbly in the same Golden Era theme that the lobby uses, and it works well.  Tables dot the center of the restaurant, whereas large half padded booth, half chair tables are the majority.  I found the booth seating comfortable, if a little deep.  If you need good back support, sit in a chair.\\n\\nThe menu was simple, clean and displayed about 10 appetizers and 10 entrees.  The prices range from $12 for a Gorgonzola stuffed ravioli, to $28 for the Kobe Fillet.  \\n\\nWe were asked by our waitress if we were attending a show, and she timed the meal accordingly, as well as told us that they had a special that included an appetizer, entree and dessert for $18!  Anything on the menu was fair game, and portions were to be reduced somewhat.  Everyone in my group went for the deal.  For value, it was one of the best meals I've had in Portland.  \\n\\nFor my starter, I had a chilled salad of Roasted Beets ($8.5) with candied walnuts, poached pears, fresh goat cheese and arugula  The portion was small, but I found it to be just right.  The main courses came out shortly after, and it was then that after consulting the tickets, we realized the show was actually 30 mins earlier than we had initially told our waitress.  She was understanding and offered up the bill quickly, and invited us to come back after the show for our dessert course.\\n\\nFor mains, I ordered the Herbed Goat Cheese Stuffed Chicken Breast with blue corn and wild rice pancakes, cranberry, apple and pear chutney with winter beans. ($18 by itself if not for the special)  I'm not sure how this was a smaller portion, perhaps 2 breasts instead of the one?  The chicken arrived with the breast on the bone, which normally is a turn off for me, but a quick cut with the knife took care of that, and after I took the first bite, I wouldn't have cared if I had to eat it directly off the entire chicken carcass, lol.  This was the tastiest, most moist chicken I've had in a long, long time.  The stuffing was very nice, light enough not to overpower, and there was just enough of it.  The pancakes were an interesting addition, about the size of silver dollars, but the topping was a little sweet.  The winter beans were green beans that were very firm.\\n\\nDuring the entire meal, the service was quick, efficient and was nearly invisible in the way that water got refilled, plates came and left, and silverware was replaced.  I especially enjoyed that I was not requested to \\"keep my fork\\" as in so many other restaurants, (yes, even the nicer ones!)\\n\\nWe left for the show, and our waitress said just to come back and ask for her for our desserts, or if we were very late, and the restaurant closed, she would let the bar know to take care of us.  \\n\\nWe returned at just after 10pm, and the restaurant closes at 10.  We actually ran into our waitress as she shuttled a tuna dish to a customer at the bar and she invited us to sit in the lobby area for coffee and dessert.\\n\\nWith the same deft service, we indulged in some coffee, several Creme Brulee's, Pecan Pie, Bread pudding, Chocolate Espresso Cake, and my order of Caramel Apple Crisp.  I should note here that the desserts are NOT a reduced portion as part of the 3 for 18 deal, they are full size.  Everything was very good, and we all cleaned our plates.\\n\\nI asked the waitress for her name, Natalie, so that I could include it in this review and encourage you to make a reservation with her in the future.  I did notice that they are a member of OpenTable, so if you use that service (check out the iPhone app) it's very convenient to setup a reservation at the last minute.\\n\\nOverall, despite mixed reviews here, we had an excellent experience at Gracie's and will not hesitate to return."},{"name":"The Optimist","address":"914 Howell Mill Rd","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"This place is wonderful and excellent fish and everything else.

I was told it may have something to do with the oven needing cleaning. My friend then went back a third time and said things had improved, but still remained on the burnt side. Cherry Street has a way with blackening their crust, which tastes awesome, but only if done right.

I was recently sent an email that offered a complimentary bottle of champagne due to previous reservations being cancelled. I followed the instructions to receive the bottle when I arrived at the restaurant. We arrived around 7:30 PM due to an anticipated wait time. \\n\\nFortunately there was no wait; however, there was also no hostess at the hostess stand and we had to wait a minute or two while the doorman got her attention. I asked about my reservation and the bottle just to make sure it was confirmed. She had a confused look on her face and just said \\"Ok\\". We were seated but we did not receive menu's until about 10 minutes afterwards. The extra silverware and plates were not removed. So we pushed them to the side. Our server was named Amir. While very nice and respectful, I don't know if he or any of the waitstaff has been properly trained in food service. There was also a server assistant who poured our drinks. Water and \\"Sweet tea\\". I say \\"Sweet tea\\" because it had something extra. Maybe an orange or citrus mixed into it. Also no ice. I asked him about it and he said he did not know what the secondary flavor could of been. \\n\\nAfter another 15-20 minutes our food arrived. Note: It arrived before a table who was seated before we entered the restaurant. I ordered shrimp and grits. My wife had chicken and waffles. My food was lukewarm at best. I informed the waiter who promptly took it away to be reheated. Note: Not remade. But reheated. It had chicken broth/gravy, grits with a little andouille sausage on top. In my opinion, anytime you add andouille to anything I expect more of a Cajun flavor. There was none. Just basic ingredients. Basic flavor. Not worth $23. My wife's food consisted of a sweet potato waffle and about 6-7 chicken drumettes. Not full chicken wings mind you. $14. Amir continued to serve us but you can definitely tell there was a lack of communication amongst the staff. Multiple waiters greeting the same table. There was another staff member, who I assume was the head server, mildly arguing about where to sit another party. Just overall confusion. A chair was removed from our table to seat a party at another table. No one asked if we had more people coming. They just took the chair. \\n\\nWe're now close to being done and the actual manager appears and asks us how everything was. I asked about the bottle of champagne that was offered. He offered that or a dessert instead. He advised that they were out of the peach cobbler. He left a menu with us to decide. Amir checked with us to see which dessert we would like. We chose cheesecake. After about 10-15 minutes he returned to tell us that the cheesecake was also unavailable and offered another choice of dessert or the bottle. I declined both and asked for the check. Total was around $46. I left a tip and left the restaurant. Overall my experience was lackluster. You would assume opening night would've brought more focus on precision. However I do think this was a failure to launch. I understand that this is a new establishment. But you'd think that due to opening night being pushed back two and a half months, some time would've been taken to rehearse dinner service. May try again in the future to see if things have improved. But it won't be anytime soon."},{"name":"Voodoo Doughnut - Old Town","address":"22 SW 3rd Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"When I lined up 5 feet behind the door amongst a string of onlookers, I expected nothing more than a novelty experience.

I'm not a doughnut person. I'd rather have a cupcake. These doughnuts, however, were the best doughnuts I've ever had in my life, and it goes beyond the captain crunch and bubble gum frosting.\\n\\nSpeaking of toppings, Voodoo delivers the quirky, eclectic experience it promises. The sexual references, double entendres and pop cultural references will impress those with an affinity for wordplay. The unique innovation and creative craftmanship will satisfy the starving artist. There's bacon doughnuts for the carnivores, candy and sugar cereal encrusted doughnuts for the kiddos, risque and obscene doughnuts for the adults, blunt doughnuts for the stoners,  and gaybar doughnuts for the activist in us all.

I'm not a fan of the cereal doughnuts, but that's not the point. Part of the fun is the experimentation. You're not meant to enjoy these doughnuts. You're meant to savor a unique experience. If you hate your grape dusted or M&M coated pastry, at least you can say you've tried. My personal favorite is the Voodoo doughnut. As a toy and food product, it's the ultimate two-in-one. Every Voodoo doll doughnut is a box of chocolate; with a unique design each time it's frosted, you never know what you're gonna get. The fact my Voodoo doughnut came with a vagina made it even better.\\n\\nThis was better than I expected. Frenetic insanity that doesn't skimp on taste. Such a unique creation could be excused with a crappy product, but the flavor makes this place even more worth the while. If you're too impatient to wait for your chance to open the gates to hell, this is not the place for you. If 20 minutes of stalling is no big deal, you've found your heaven.

He didn't check on us to see how the food was, didn't warn us about the scalding plates he delivered without saying a word, cleared the table while mockingly declaring, \\"it was delicious!\\" rather than asking what our experience of our meal was, dropped the check without a thank you then returned the credit card slip again without a thank you, have a good day, happy holidays, etc.....and this is the service he gave to a couple of happy, friendly, people who were polite, didn't ask questions, just ordered, ate and paid the bill. He's clearly been in the industry too long and has become embittered. The customer shouldn't be the enemy. The assistant manager was very sweet, and as we left he asked how everything was.

I know there will be a line; this is to build suspense to the glory I am about to experience.  Each step I take builds my desire to hold that little pink box in my hand.  I watch as others fall out of line because they are not worthy of this sensory-shattering journey.  Others are weak.  But I know the deep satisfaction I will feel once the rich doughnuts reach my pallet.\\n\\nAs I reach the benchmark of the interior of the store, the case of doughnuts teases me as it rotates and shows off its goodies.  My senses are now heightened as the aromas of the doughnuts waft through the air.  I can hear the doughnuts in production.  Unlike Krispy Kreme, which never touch a human hand until serving, my treasure is hand-crafted to perfection.\\n\\nAlas!  It is my turn to fill up my little pink box.  Go with a Voodoo dozen.  It is the most economical and you get to try things that you otherwise may not have ordered.  But of course, add on a bacon maple bar.  Indulge as the tender doughnut is met with the sticky sweet maple.  As you bite down, notice the delightful crunch as the smokey-saltiness cascades with the other flavors to create a symphony of pleasure in your mouth.\\n\\nFinally - depart with your pleasure box in hand.  It is your precious.  Your own.  Protect it as you wade through the drunken masses - all trying to get at what is yours.  Until at last you can arrive at home, brew some bold coffee and enjoy.\\n\\nThis is truly the Voodoo Doughnut experience.  And if you can't eat a dozen doughnuts by yourself, at least take a bite of each one, because it will be well worth it.  And certainly do not by in to the nonsense of the cereal doughnuts.

Request a table next to the window. If you're sitting in the 2nd or third row, the view is disappointing. If you're on the side (i.e. not facing downtown), the views are also disappointing. If you're on the side and in the 2nd row, it's that much worse. You can request to move tables but not after you've ordered apparently (even if your food hasn't arrived).\\n\\nTo make matters worse, there are signs everywhere saying \\"This area is not for observation, please go to our skydeck on the 50th floor.\\" This messaging is obviously there to keep bar patrons and others from loitering near the tables and annoying the diners, but this kind of signage is very obnoxious. People come here for the views - don't make them feel negative about wanting to look at them. \\n\\nI would definitely go back but I'd be a lot more aggressive about requesting an experience that supports the purpose - dining in a unique environment with an unmatched view of Boston.

Instead, I made do with some yummy food instead. I was having lunch that day with a co-worker so that allowed me to of course have a bite of another menu item. Whereas I ordered the Chicago Style hot dog, I must say that the sausage my friend ordered was out of this world. \\n\\nIt was called \\"The Greek\\" and one of the things that Frank does is have a daily changing menu of specialty sausages. These daily specials come and go but this one should definitely stay on the main menu. It was a lamb and mint sausage with tzatziki sauce, fig orange jalapeno chutney, garlic butter roasted peppers and feta cheese on a french roll.  It was delicious!  My friend shared a bite with me and we decided to flag down the waiter to let him know that this needed to be added to the main menu because we were both immediately saddened knowing that we might not come across this option again. \\n\\nMy Chicago Style dog was very good.  It came with all the requisite fixins. Poppy seed bun, Vienna Beef hot dog, celery salt, sport peppers, tomatoes, day glo green relish, onions, dill pickle spear. I had it all the way and it was a good dog. This is always on their regular menu and was only $3.75. The daily specials run a wee bit pricier given that they are usually made with local, limited supply artisan sausages.  \\n\\nThe waffle cut fries large basket is a nice basket of fries served with your choice of two delectable sauces from the many that they have.  They use kosher salt on the fries.  I got the buffalo blue and the punchy sauce - is a mix of hot sauce (tabasco?), mayonnaise and vinegar I believe. Just the right amount all blended together to make a slightly addictive and spicy sauce. The buffalo blue is just what it sounds like - buffalo sauce and blue cheese mixed together. A nice tangy, spicy combo as well. They do offer a veggie dog and even a portobello cheesesteak if you're cutting back on the meat.\\n\\nI am definitely going to come back to try out the corn cup which is described as grilled corn served with cilantro, lime, chili and cheese as well as a beer soaked brat. With the regular menu combined with the changing daily menu, there are endless combinations of sausage/dogs that you can have.

We were promptly seated in a small dining area off of the bar, not in the main dining room, which on a quiet night made me feel a little exiled. Our server promptly greeted us but was just a tad over-enthusiastic, almost pushing menu items on us when we told him that we still needed time to decide. He also expressed that he had only worked there a week \\"but he still knew a few things\\"...yikes. Food was lackluster for the price point. Pad Thai was basic, and came with five shrimp for a $22 price tag. We had also had a fish curry that was substantially more flavorful but still came with two measly pieces of fish for around $25. If I'm paying $25 for an entree, it should either be substantial in quantity or in flavor/uniqueness. For a non-busy night, it seemed to take around 20 minutes between appetizers and entrees...with our poor newbie server sweating and fumbling the whole time. I painfully watched as the table next to us (who had an appetizer when we were sat) get their entrees after we had finished ours. It was a long, awkward experience.\\n\\nTL;DR if you want thai food, go some place that isn't going to price gouge you for mediocre renditions of basic dishes.

I had shrimp and chicken fajitas and asked for no green peppers and double onion - I received my dinner which included green peppers, red peppers, and mushrooms which I have never had in fajitas.  The shrimp had the tail shell on and the chicken was diced into such small pieces that I could not identify any chicken which the pieces were smaller than the mushroom slices.  The guacamole was not freshly made and had a bright almost fake looking green color.  The corn tortillas were cold and had not been warmed on the grill so the tacos were disappointing as well.  The chicken burrito used the very small diced chicken as well.  My final experience was the horchata which I ordered to drink while we were waiting. After taking my first sip, I realized it was not fresh and came from a drink station similar to how soda is served.  The box underneath exposed that the horchata came from a water and syrup mixture - just one big disappointing experience.

I can certainly understand she may be a new hire and still learning the ropes, but as a previous food industry worker myself I would hope someone is informing her that it is considered poor form to bring a completely different dish from the one ordered despite being corrected 5 times at the table, then to give her customers passive aggressive attitude about being corrected, and downright offensive to carry food in her bare hands across the restaurant to hand to us.

When drinks did arrive, the beers were warm.  \\n\\nAppetizers were decent:  the grilled oysters were very tasty, but the raw oysters were not served on ice and not as cold as they should have been; this seemed like an amateur move for a place with \\"Oyster\\" in its name.  \\n\\nEveryone seemed to enjoy their entrees.  The Union Special lobster was excellent, which had the claws served lazyman style.

Super excited to try an infamous Atlanta institution and enjoy some proper southern cooking! We were seated in what was once the original space (the restaurant is very \\"piece-y\\" with lots of separate rooms) after passing a hall full of famous past diners. Like a lot of southern restaurants, we could order an entree and choose from about 20 sides. I ordered the baked chicken which came with dressing (or stuffing for Northerners) and cranberry sauce. While the dressing was moist and flavorful, the cranberry sauce absolutely came from a jar and was put in a teeny-tiny serving cup. The chicken was surprising DRY. I was expecting absolute perfection (partially based on our waiter's recommendation), but I would not suggest it to anyone. My sides fared much better. I started off with the Brunswick Stew which was AMAZING!!!  So so so good. I also got the squash souffle and fried green tomatoes. Yum. BEST part of the meal and quite honestly the most popular item on the menu, the cinnamon rolls. Yes, these are served all day long with the bread basket. Truly delectable.

We were about 30 min into the wait for our last two cold dishes when our server came by. I advised her we were still waiting for two appetizers and pointed out the table next to us had received a ton of food. Here's where it goes downhill.

He said we would like our check and to please check the remainder of our order. Mind you we were waiting for shrimp cocktail and a cold avocado crab dish. Why we were now at 40 min on these was a question. She disappeared in disgust with us and a few min later our avocado crab dish was sent to the table in the incorrect portion we ordered. Still no sight of the elusive shrimp cocktail. We pulled a manager over and this is the only redeeming quality I can attest to. He apologized profusely.

I ordered the catfish dinner, my two sides were Macaroni and cheese, collard greens, Peach Cobbler for dessert. Catfish was fresh, Mac and Cheese was pretty good, collard greens were just okay (not as seasoned as I like my collard greens to be). Their Arnold Palmer is delicious though! I had the fried chicken a while back and it was juicy, cooked to perfection. So why not 5 stars you ask? The prices are a bit much compared to their competition. This is ATL you can get Soul Food anywhere and for less. Also, Mary Mac's really needs to pull the carpet, it has a mildew smell. I'm sure they're trying to keep the building as original as possible but it'll be just the same if they get new carpet or all hardwood floors. Just a thought.

At first, we only ordered 6 because the last place we had them were very salty, but these ones were just right, especially with the cocktail sauce and horseradish mixed in together. The clam chowder had so much clams in it, but the only drawback was every time I took a spoonful of chowder, I also got a spoonful of shells too (but let's you know it's fresh). The star of the meal was the lobster scampi, which our waiter named Frederick. Poor Frederick, but he was so juicy and for a medium sized lobster, it was like eating a large one for a medium price. The linguine was well cooked but not over cooked and the sauce was very buttery but not salty. Overall, the meal was great!

Best of all, it's right around the corner from my place and easy to get to, regardless of the weather.\\n\\nBut what I love about Buddha C is the food.  Now, like all restaurants, some of the dishes are a miss, but when they have a hit, its great!  \\n\\nThey have a great sushi menu that has decently priced rolls, as well as the pricey \\"add all the extras you can put on a slab of fish\\" rolls.

Over here in Dunkin' Donuts territory, I sometimes feel the word is in danger of losing its silent letters forever, √† la the commonplace and ridiculous spelling of \\"drive-thru.\\" \\n\\nGrammatical considerations aside, I was excited to go see the selection of vegan doughnuts at Voodoo, a mecca for hip kids and drunkards (as it's near a lot of late-night bars in downtown Portland) as well as for vegans tired of missing out on fluffy, sticky, delicious sweetness.  Midday on a Thursday (Christmas Eve, actually) the line for Voodoo snaked not quite out the door and the air was thick with the scent of sugar. \\n\\nNow, Voodoo is the kind of place you go for the novelty, really. With a bacon-draped maple bar and doughnuts festooned with Fruit Loops and crushed Butterfingers, the point here is as much the entertainment value as it is the flavor. My brother and mom selected six regular doughnuts (although there's nothing much normal about a giant chocolate doughnut dredged in Oreos) and I asked for an assortment of six vegan ones. \\n\\nWe spent the next couple days sampling the doughnuts little slices at a time, because there's really only so much fat and sugar that's appealing to an adult before you start craving an apple or some nice steamed broccoli. In general, I'd say the vegan doughnuts were so-so. My assortment included cake and glazed varieties, one with what tasted like grape Pixie Stix powder on top, a couple with blah vanilla glaze and sprinkles, one with what appeared to be (and tasted like) orange crayon shavings, and one maple-glazed (with which you can never go wrong!). Maybe Voodoo puts too much emphasis on the sugary glaze and toppings and not enough on the taste and consistency of the dough itself.

The sirloin was juicy and cooked perfectly to medium rare, and the lamb was practically falling off the bone.  The portions were also a good size, and I finished the meal full but not overly stuffed.  The wine was a little overpriced, but it did go with our meals very well.  The amazing food combined with the gorgeous view meant for a great night and we both had a very good time.\\n\\nWhile I would definitely recommend the 3 course meal ($55, or $75 with wine), the individual items on the menu were a little pricey.  However, the atmosphere, service, and of course the view make the meal worth it.  I am already planning on taking friends or family here when they come visit me in the future."},{"name":"Launderette","address":"2115 Holly St","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Had dinner at this great place last night. Super trendy minimalistic Decour that was very cute. There were five of us and our menu consisted of fried olives, crab toast, and the whipped ricotta. Absolutely loved the fried olives and the whipped ricotta but the crab was a little off and was quite fishy. I love crab and with some sweeter crab it would've been delicious. My appetizer beverage was the bird of paradise and it was really delicious. For a main courses we had the Plantcha, whole Branzinno, brick chicken times two and and the pri pri  prawns. All were seasoned perfectly and we're quite nice. The portion sizes are a little on the smaller side but still very reasonably priced and I appreciate not having wasted food.

I love Brookline Village and always try and support local businesses.\\n\\nThat being said, my first visit to Stoli was with an Amazon local voucher.  My four course dinner consisted of the following:\\n\\nBaby spinach salad with (maybe) three grape tomatoes cut into quarters and placed around the spinach.  The dressing was nice and light, but overall this dish was very underwhelming.\\n\\nBorsch soup - I blame myself for this, but I didn't know this soup was supposed to be served cold.  It was just ok, there was A LOT of dill in the soup.  If you don't like dill, don't order this.\\n\\nVegetarian Crepe - Not warm at all, shredded zuchini, cabbage, onions, and other inexpensive vegetables.  I didn't see any sun dried tomatoes or mozzerella as advertised.\\n\\nBlintzes - Tiny, but good.  Two mini crepes the length of my middle finger stuffed with apples and cherries (I think) and drizzled with chocolate.  They smelled delicious.\\n\\nThe highlight of my meal was my honey infused vodka martini.  Everything else was poor.  There is no way I would ever pay full price for this meal. \\n\\nI strongly believe that doing there promotional vouchers, as well as restaurant week, are a way to reach out to new customers.

Instead of thinking of the next crazy thing to put on a donut, why don't you just focus on making a really good donut?  \\n\\nBut Voodoo will not do that, they will continue to make bad donuts will stupid stuff on them, that people will continue to line up outside because they want to follow the crowd because it's the cool thing to do, and I will continue to have to listen to people praise this place, and I'll have to argue with them for either following the crowd, or for just having really bad taste.\\n\\nBrandon\\nwww.totalepicness.com"},{"name":"Union Oyster House","address":"41 Union St","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"Chowdah outstanding.

Everything is fresh, largely local and served with a smile. Our server, Clay, hit it outta the park. He was so helpful and attentive. He made the experience special. The brunch we had was also spectacular. We tried the beet salad, trout crepes and a pecan scone. Everything was perfect including the coffee. I never rave about restaurants b/c i think most of them are overrated, too expensive and generally not as good as they like to think they are! This one is actually appropriately priced, unique in its offering, generous service and hip surroundings. If you add gluten free to the list that's pretty much a dream offering. \\nSo glad these guys have arrived in atlanta!"},{"name":"Voodoo Doughnut - Old Town","address":"22 SW 3rd Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"On a recent work trip to Portland, my coworker and I decided we had to find our way to Voodoo Doughnuts, after being told about it by our one true chef love, Anthony Bourdain.\\n\\nWe walked on over from our hotel in the early hours of a Friday, through the wet and quiet streets of downtown.

We arrived late for our reservation, but they made no fuss, and quickly adjusted to bring us to our seats.  \\n\\nThe lighting and decor is dim and intimate.  The table was preset and the waiter greeted us promptly with water and food suggestions.  Throughout our dining experience, we had consistent service by our waiter, food runner, the bartender, and another service employee. The restaurant was half full and we were seated not far from a large party celebrating a birthday, but the noise level and eating disturbances were minimal, if at all.\\n\\nFOOD was AWESOME!!! I ordered the Fried chicken and Lobster mac & cheese. The chicken was lightly breaded and seasoned well.  There were huge chunks of lobster on the Mac & Cheese and the cheese had a smokey flavor...delish! My boyfriend ordered the Scallops and Shrimp with Jasmine Rice, the sauce was amazing, scallops and shrimp were cooked PERFECTLY! It was a very light meal, but a great portion. My bf's mom ordered the Unicorn Fish topped with crabmeat and mixed vegetables. It was very flavorful.  It was very moist and more firm than most white fish.  At the suggestion of the waiter, she ordered it with the curry sauce instead of the bacon cream sauce, so it gave it a spicy kick.\\n\\nThey brought my boyfriend a slice of the red velvet cake to sing Happy Birthday...awesomeness!!!! It was a huge, moist slice of a Marscapone Cheese based rendition of Red Velvet with fresh berries in it.  He loved it, and we were all three able to eat off of one slice.\\n\\nOverall, the dinner meal options are very unique and tasty, the service is fast and friendly, and the setting is intimate or casual & fun (depending on which corner of the restaurant you are sitting in).

The place was crowded and there was a 15-20 minute wait for a table so I would recommend making a reservation before hand just to be safe. The interior has a small waiting area but, I decided to head over to the Hong Kong for a drink before my meal and got a text message when my table was ready. One thing about myself is that I really drink a lot of water when eating so having the pitcher on my table is a major key which is exactly what they did here. Another thing that impressed me that was unique was the small bin next to the table that you can store a backpack, small suitcase or a purse. \\n\\nIn regards to the food I decided to order the gonzo & shio combination which was delicious. The large bowl is only $2 more than the small and worth the extra as the noodles melt in your mouth. I could use a bunch of adjectives to describe the food but, to put it into one word it would be amazing. I would highly recommend this place as a meal for two that will fill you up costs $30 for 2.

The inside was tiny, only room for a short line with no tables or chairs to speak of. The menu was vast with great names for all their treats. You vegan hippies would love this place due to their extensive list of vegan doughnuts.

The edges were perfectly crisp, as any good fritter should be, and the toppings were simply decadent. Because it was so big, biting into it was difficult. I ended up ripping it apart and saving most of it for my healthy breakfast the next morning. Inside the beast, there seemed to be a layer of some unidentifiable filling. I have no idea what that was, but it helped keep the monster moist and delicious. \\n\\nMy friend got the fruit loops doughnut and I got a mango filled one for seconds.

However, the restaurant must have been incredibly busy because I barely got any service the whole night and went through most of my meal with no water.  The food was OK this time.  I ordered a scallop tapas and it was cold and not very impressive.  My friend ordered the \\"lomo saltado\\" and the beef was so so cold. My adobo de cerdo tasted.... burnt. It just tasted like char and if it was supposed to be that way I was disappointed.  I should have just stuck to getting the ceviche.  \\n\\nI would have given them a better rating had my last experience not been so bitter (the pork too).  I will probably be back for the ceviche, but this place can be pretty expensive so that may be awhile from now."},{"name":"Poor Calvin's","address":"510 Piedmont Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4.5","text":"This restaurant is really special for me.

Normally, when the 4 of us dine together at a new restaurant, at least one of us is disappointed. Not so this time!  Each of us raved about our respective dishes, which simmered full of flavor and perfectly prepared.  I could make a meal out of the creamy, garlicky polenta alone.  The shrimp was perfectly cooked and the sauces brilliant compliments to the dishes.  One of our diners ordered the tiramisu for dessert and it did not disappoint - all the necessary flavors with good consistency.  Nikki the table attendant was patient with us newbies to the restaurant and super knowledgeable about the offerings.  She was also very personable, yet not invasive of our dining time.  We were so relaxed, we felt as if we were in a good friend's dining room, particularly after the master chef cruised the tables to say hello and checked to see if we were enjoying our choices.

Got on here and saw that the highest rated Mexican place was Mexas Tacos. I too was a little skeptical once we arrived. Could Yelp actually be wrong? A resounding NOPE!   Mexas Tacos was exactly as rated. Amazing, delicious and homemade-tasting tacos.

At the bar they had a variety of sauces from mild to hot and a fantastic salsa verde. They also had onions, cilantro and limes.

I think you're my favorite McMenamins. Your only competition is Edgefield because of their amazing soaking pool but they're not as generous with it as you are, which makes you my preferred sibling. \\n\\nLet's start with the soaking pool. $5 to soak in a hot, salty pool? Hell yeah. Here's a Lincoln for ya. I rarely turn down the opportunity to soak and catch up with a friend. \\n\\nNext, the building is incredible.

It's so fascinating! The pictures of the kids are as creepy as they are enthralling.\\n\\nThen, there's the bars. I'm a huge fan of detention and the principal's office. There is something really satisfying about drinking in places I was often sent to as a student. Like a bigger bar? The boiler room is a creative masterpiece. I always pop into all three of these bars when giving a tour to newbies. \\n\\nLastly, there's the movie theater. It's SO great! An auditorium turned into a second-run movie theater that serves liquor? Genius.

This tartine was presented somewhat haphazardly, with the preserves and nuts falling off. The bread had a great texture because it was firm and moist. It was not flavorful though. The brie was creamy, but keep in mind that it is a mild cheese. We wish they would spice things up a bit because this tartine was a little boring. The sweet preserves went well with the cheese, and a few more walnuts would go a long way because they added an enjoyable crunch. A piece of watermelon accompanied this sandwich. There is oil and balsamic vinaigrette on every table so we used it to finish off the fresh salad greens.\\n\\n(7/10) Smoked Salmon with Garlic & Herb Cream Cheese Tartine\\nThis tartine is served with salad greens, cucumbers, and watermelon. The thinly sliced salmon tasted fresh and was not chewy at all. The garlic and herb cream cheese complemented the salmon well and gave it a delightful creamy texture. The cream cheese and salmon were placed on the bread in a uniform way with complete coverage (unlike our other tartine). Thankfully, the bread was soft and did not overpower the other ingredients. This is a solid but simple tartine, so don't expect to be blown away\\n\\n(6/10) Bread Pudding with Butter Rum Sauce\\nThere was hardly any pudding in this bread pudding! The waiter told us they use day-old bread to make it. It tasted like a yummy piece of French toast dipped into butter rum. The raspberries and blueberries around it tasted fresh. The crust of the bread was very tough and seemed to make up 1/3 of this bread pudding, which made eating this sweet dessert a little less enjoyable.\\n\\n(6/10) Flourless Chocolate Cake with Raspberry Drizzle\\nThe chocolate cake was nice, but didn't wow us. We would have preferred a more chocolaty flavor. Also, it would have been nice if the powered sugar was actually on the cake instead of decoration. The raspberry sauce was a little sharp, but complemented the cake well.\\n\\n(5/10) Rockstar Bagel\\nWe ordered the plain one, and it was a regular bagel but a little on the firm side.\\n\\nService (7/10)\\n\\nWe dined on a weekday evening and the restaurant was half-full. It was self-seating and we chose to sit next to the large window to get a view of outside. Our waiter was friendly and made some great wine recommendations, but Granache came out warmer than room temperature. The Riesling was nice and chilled. Our food came out in a timely manner. We did have to get his attention a few times to get refills or to order more. Also, he assumed we were finished eating too soon and brought out the dessert menu - but we weren't done ordering just yet! Still, the service here was good.\\n\\nAmbiance (8/10)\\n\\nBlue Dahlia encompasses a French bistro vibe; it is cozy and adorable. There is only street parking available, but it is pretty easy to find spaces close by. The interior is intimate without feeling overcrowded. There are a few long, shared tables in the center of the restaurant, lots of wood beams, and local art hanging on the walls. There was some New Orleans style jazz playing softly from the speakers. The front patio has benches with large comfy pillows, and tables and chairs. The back patio has even more tables and it feels as if you're dining in a secret garden. There are fans with misters so you don't melt away. This place isn't good for large gatherings, but great for smaller groups. Blue Dahlia has reasonably priced items, especially considering it's mostly local and organic. The menu is also vegetarian-friendly. Unfortunately, the sandwich selections that are described so enticingly on the menu, seemed mediocre at best.

Last night december 7th I decided to take my fiancee who is visiting the city of boston to what is suppose to be a high end place, Top of the Hub restaurant at the Prudential Center. I am VERY DISAPPOINTED with the service and the indirect RACISM that occurred last night.\\n\\nWe arrived around 8:45pm, we were told the minimum was $24 per person as if i needed to know how much money i would need to spend. I expect to spend at least $60 whenever i take my fiancee out. I understand this may be standard procedure but i felt very uneasy due to the way the hostess repeated himself to my fiancee. \\n\\nfurthermore, we were told that it would be a 15min wait even though many tables were already open and ready to serve. we waited 30 minutes to be seated. When it was time to be taken to our table the hostess did not even walk us to our table but instead said, just follow the man in the suit, as if many people weren't wearing suits. After finding the hostess i needed to follow to be seated i was told several times to take my beanie off my head. I haven't even taken my seat and i was being hassled about it. He did not open our chairs as he did for the Caucasian couple behind us and he did not tell us his name.\\n\\nWhen our waiter arrived he did not tell us his name nor did he care to offer us anything on the menu or explain the menu in any fashion. when it was time for us to order he did not say a word, but rather just looked us and waited for us to tell him what we wanted. We order 2 10oz Hanger Steak's, 2 caesar salads, and a sweet ice tea for my fiancee. after 10 minutes our appetizer salads were brought to the table by a waitress and she did not even say a word to us when we said thank you. 40 minutes later our main course was brought out and served to us. The food was not only cold but not up to the expectation of what we imagined. \\n\\nAfter my fiancee finished her sweet tea she pointed out to me that her cup was dirty. I examined the cup myself and was applaud to actually see the cup covered with a stains and a sticky substance on the outside of the cup. I immediately got very upset and asked the nearest waiter to find my server. it took 10 minutes for my server to come and all he had was a list of excuses as to why the cup looked like that. he said \\"the sugar made the cup sticky on the outside\\". And then he said \\"when i poured the drink it had overflown\\". I looked at our nameless waiter and said \\" if you made a mistake why didn't start over with a new glass instead of serving my fiancee a glass that looks like it was CLEARLY not washed\\". I had no patience for this waiter no longer and asked to speak with the manager. He walked away quickly to go speak to his manager and comes back and offers us another meal. I said to him\\" NO, i do not want another meal, and i will not pay for this meal\\". The waiter didn't seem to care and said he spoke to the manager and said that the meal will be covered. \\n\\nI have NEVER in my life felt so embarrassed in front of my fiancee! I expected to take her to a high end restaurant to enjoy good service, good food, and a good viewing of the city of Boston. I was completely let down and felt as if i was not an equal to all the other couples because of the way we were treated.\\n\\nTheir slogan is:\\n\\"You can trust us with your most important moments.\\n\\nWe are Boston's best hospitality team. We pride ourselves on continually finding new ways to delight visitors to the Top of the Hub Restaurant.\\"\\n\\nIt amazes me to see that a place such as Top of the Hub could give such a horrible representation of Boston hospitality. \\n\\nI hope this letter will make a difference in your service because i plan on making sure every press and everyone who cares to hear about will hear about it,\\n\\nChristian Marrero"},{"name":"Hair of the Dog Brewery and Tasting Room","address":"61 SE Yamhill St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Today a group of 9 of us biked in on a saturday morning when they just opened and we got not so good service.

I came here around 1ish on a Wednesday and there was no wait - thank goodness because I was starving haha. Right as we got in, the hostess welcomed us and was super friendly. She seated us and our waitress came to our table 5 mins later. Because the menu wasn't extensive, we were ready to order when she got to us. \\n\\nI ordered the tonkatsu char-su ramen with miso soup base and butter corn. I have to admit, this ramen blew my mind. I didn't expect it so be so good. Every bite was just as good as the last one. Adding the butter corn to the ramen was a great idea so I highly recommend it. I ordered a small bowl and that filled me up (I don't really eat much). The pork was absolutely perfect too - it had a nice layer of fat that made it super juicy and it literally melted in my mouth. The broth was really good too! Everything went well together.\\n\\nI also ordered the gyoza - it was average. Not too bad, but also nothing to rave about. I'll probably pass up on it next time I come here. \\n\\nIn terms of customer service, I think they do a good job of it. I didn't see our waitress that much and she didn't leave an impression on me, so it was whatever. However, the owner stopped by our table couple times to check up on us and took our bowls away. Super friendly gesture. And as mentioned before, the hostess was really friendly and welcoming. \\n\\nI think the thing that I love most about this place is that they have options for the soup base and for the serving size. I personally don't eat a lot, so I hate it when I order something and I can't finish it. I don't like to eat leftovers either so I never take things to go. The small size is honestly the perfect serving size for me and it makes me feel good that I am not wasting any food. I can't wait to come back here for the ramen again! Better than Pikaichi IMO."},{"name":"Bouldin Creek Cafe","address":"1900 S 1st St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"In true Austin tradition, Bouldin Creek Cafe offers a twist on brunch in a friendly, quirky atmosphere.

The food in the restaurant is good and healthy (although the brunch portions were a bit small) and people with all different tastes will be able to find something they can enjoy.

I have not yet had the opportunity to try the rooftop, but look forward to it.\\n\\nI only have one bone to pick with the restaurant and it is the atmosphere.  The music and general vibe of the restaurant is lacking.  It seems it is meant to be a neighborhood restaurant, but it feels more like the lobby of a chain hotel or an airport restaurant.  It has potential to be a great place to grab a glass of wine and a bite with a friend, sit at the bar... etc.  In my opinion, the atmosphere is missing the quirk and originality that makes Grant Park such a special neighborhood. \\n\\nThis restaurant/coffee shop is a much needed addition in this part of the neighborhood.

It taste fresh and not like canned salsa, which i completely detest. Their corn chips is light and crisp & you can get an unlimited supply of it. Their salsa comes in several different kinds of level of hotness, you just gotta ask your server if you want something spicer & they'll provide it for you.

It was the only side dish without meat we could find to order, and I am glad I did, I could make a meal out of this alone! The saltiness of the smoked fish and crispness of the peanuts was an explosion of happiness to my taste buds. \\nTo finish we had the Salted Caramel Ice Cream, what can I say, it was sweet, salty, creamy and full of what dreams are made of."},{"name":"The Paramount","address":"44 Charles St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"I classify this as a high-priced diner.

At 45 minutes with no news from either manager, I complained to the front desk at the Alfond Inn and spoke to the hotel manager on duty, explaining the aforementioned issues. He went to the restaurant, and we were seated immediately. Many, many tables were empty, including all but one table on the patio. There also appeared to be plenty of staff. The waitress was not nice, probably because we complained about the wait. My medium burger came well-done and the fries were undercooked.

I'm a fan of the ubiquitous charcoal chicken places, but the sides here really elevated this meal. We went here as a group of four adults, and got the Family Dinner 2. This included a whole chicken, 4 large sides, 2 each of the hot and mild sauces, and choice of rolls or tortillas.\\n\\nThe chicken was average for these kinds of places. It was good, nothing that blew me away, but nice and moist, if a little salty.\\n\\nThe sides are really where this place stands apart. I could happily forget the chicken entirely and just live off the sides. First of all, they were all steaming hot. We have a couple in our group, me included, who are very picky about food temperature - Inka definitely delivered. The Yucca Fries were amazing, and were inhaled within minutes of reaching the table. Hot, crunch, creamy deliciousness, that I liked best dipped in the mild (white) sauce. The plantains were thickly cut and nicely caramelized with a little crunch on the outside. The basmati rice and black beans were enjoyable - nothing special like the other two, but a good balance. Corn tortillas were served warm, and helped bring the meal together.\\n\\nI loved the mild sauce; it had flavors reminiscent of the Mustard Curry sauce from Chicken Kitchen - one of my favorites. The hot was salsa-esque with a nice kick, and the guys demolished the two tiny cups no problem!\\n\\nFor drinks, we tried in the golden Inka Cola, a flavor nobody could quite agree on - bubble gum/cream soda/banana is what I'm going with. The fresh squeezed lemonade tasted like it was probably a mix of lemons and limes, and was quite refreshing. Speaking of which, there are lime wedges up by the drinks, and they go well with the chicken.\\n\\nI see a new dinner takeout spot in my future. We will definitely be back, especially to grab an order of those yucca fries!\\n\\nDinner also happened to fall on my parent's 46th anniversary...Happy Anniversary, Mom & Dad, I hope to celebrate many more with you over Peruvian chicken!!"},{"name":"Stammtisch","address":"401 NE 28th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"Probably my favorite meal ever in Portland!

We walked in and took one look at the prices ($50 for one lobster) and decided to get the lobster next door, but we had to go back, everything looked so authentic and delicious. Walking up three flights of stairs you get a sense of the colonial feel of this restaurant, and once we were seated they brought us some of the best cornbread I have ever had, slightly sweet, warm, moist, served in huge chunks.  Each bite you could really taste the corn, and if I closed my eyes I could imagine what it would be like to be sitting in this restaurant 200 years ago enjoying a very similar chunk of cornbread.\\n.  The old timey antique water pitcher added to the authenticity.  We ordered the Oysters Rockefeller (after much debate on whether to try the raw oysters or the cold sampler) and although it was a little pricey $12.95 for a half dozen, they were delectable.  Huge oysters, very fresh, and I think I found more than one in each shell.  After slurping up the spinach and cheese sauce the oyster swere a pleasantly chewy, salty treat at the end.  Oysters Rockefeller...delicioso.  Follow the Oysters with another piece of cornbread . and then... I had to try the clam chowder, and I was pleasantly surprised, it lived up to the hype, thick creamy, full of clams with a  a hint of salt water flavoring in the aftertaste.

Drooling from the thought of these doughnuts. *insert drooling emoji*\\n\\nSo, my team and I were in Portland for a 3-day competition and we had Voodoo Doughnut on the top of our list. After day 2 of our competition, we decided to hit up Voodoo. Apparently, there are two locations. We went to the one in Old Town near Chinatown. It was Saturday evening around 8pm and there was a long line.  We happen to visit when all the roads were closed off because of some race. The area is pretty sketchy, a lot of people sitting on the streets. There are some benches you can sit on within the pink gates to enjoy your doughnuts and while waiting in line you can stare at the people with the pink boxes eating their doughnuts..... in jealousy. I was drooling while waiting in line - the smell of fresh doughnuts is one of my favorites! Although the line was long, it was moving - we waited maybe 20 minutes before we got in.\\n\\nThe place is quite small, there are two displays of rotating doughnuts and four cashiers. There's a huge ass doughnut stuck to the ceiling and a lot of funky lights and stuff to look at. ***CASH ONLY!!!! They do have an ATM machine if you forget cash. They offer MANY doughnuts - they have a picture of all the doughnuts you can look at while you wait in line, there are so many I wish I could have tried them all.\\n\\nThey offer cake doughnuts, vegan doughnuts, cruellers, raised doughnuts (bars, fill doughnuts specialties), fritters and coffee. They also sell some merchandise, clothes and mugs. We ordered about 16 doughnuts: blueberry, 2xchocolate peanut cake, lemon chiffon, grape ape, 2x maple bacon bars, 2xold dirty bastards, 2xsmores, 2xoreo, portland cream, the loop and apple fritter. I claimed the apple fritter, it was the size of my face and it was DELICIOUS, the edges were perfectly crispy while the overall fritter was very cinnamony and soft - DROOL. I had a bite of the smores doughnut which must have been a feature, it was filled with marshmallow cream and topped with golden graham cereal and it was SO GOOD - I was really sad I didn't get one for myself but I took note for next time ;) Apparently, the bacon maple bar was amazing too. The doughnuts that were meh from our selection that I wouldn't get again was the chocolate peanut cake doughnut, and lemon chiffon crueller, they were just a little dry and didn't have the WOW factor like the apple fritter and smores.  I regret not trying the buttermilk bar and the classic old fashion glazed doughnuts.\\n\\nWe had some doughnuts left over for the next day and obviously the doughnuts are the best fresh. I found the yeast doughnuts were dry after one day, still edible but not the same.\\n\\nOverall, Voodoo is definitely worth the hype and the wait. I suggest ordering a minimum of a dozen doughnuts and eating the whole box the day of for ultimate freshness!! ;) hehe\\n\\nps. Voodoo Doughnuts in the midst of a competition is great way to carb load :) haha"},{"name":"Voodoo Doughnut - Old Town","address":"22 SW 3rd Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"A must try is the Grape Ape, I believe it's called.

We were told it would be a 15 min wait for a table so we said we would wait at the bar.  At the bar we found fast and friendly service.  After about 10 min we were seated at a table and then the service went downhill from there.  We waited about 10 min for someone to ask if we wanted any water to accompany our drinks from the bar. After we got our water and saw other people seated after us ordering I asked a waitress walking by for an order of fish and chips and to bring it out asap for my daughter.  We do this all the time at other places and it's no problem.  At this point in time the waitress offered to take all our orders (she never introduced her self but ended up serving our table the whole time.  45 min later the table next to complained about not having their food to the waitress. The manager came to our table and apologized for the wait saying all the orders came in at once (He never visited the other table). At this time I had recognized him as the guy sitting at the table to the side of us doing everything but eating with his friends instead of managing the restaurant.  When we finally got our food, everything at once, over an hour later my hamburger that I asked for medium rare was well done and the bacon on it was burnt so that was all I could taste. The 3 other orders were, 2 fish and chips (nothing special), a prosciutto sandwich.  During this time we even saw the manager outside walking his friends to their car. When we finally got the check it came with 3 limoncello.  At this point in time my wife and daughter went outside to wait because my 14 month old could not sit any more.  It was a couple minutes before my friend and I left and walked by the manager talking to a table at near the door(no words spoken).  In front of the restaurant we were able to warn other potential customers that they should not be in a hurry and explained some of what I am writing here.  When I finally crossed the street to my car and was putting my daughter in her seat the manager came running over saying they were supposed to notify him when we were leaving and he was sorry for the wait and wanted to give us a gift card.  I told him to keep it that we  would never be back! \\n\\nI live Danvers left my house a little after 1 for lunch and then went straight home and it was after 3 when I got in the door.

I expected maybe $2-$3 extra but $6???? And it didn't even taste authentic. Was not impressed but stayed optimistic and hoped that my quesadilla would taste better. My two younger brothers ordered a virgin strawberry/whipped cream kind of drink that was probably only about 8 oz. and they charged $4 per drink! Seriously over priced! Just on drinks and queso, I wasted $14.. And I do mean WASTED! My quesadilla came and it came with rice and beans. Rice wasn't very impressive, neither was the beans. Guacamole tasted fresh. Not amazing, but fresh so that's cool I guess. The quesadillas were not great either. Honestly the ones from taco cabana taste wayyyyy better. Food wasn't crazy over priced.

Unfortunately they did away with the hummus taco and their version of a sloppy joe. \\n\\nThe atmosphere is fairly social although you're good to either yak it up or read a book quietly. It isn't really one of those coffee shops where 90% of the people are on laptops. It's more of a neighborhood social hangout. Music varies depending on the person working.

Here's my pros and cons:\\n\\nPros:\\n- Blue Devil - great stilton bleu cheese, homemade applewood smoked bacon, crispy fried onions. Can't go wrong with that combo. \\n- Truffle Parm fries. Delicious. I always get a large because I know there will be plenty left over to reheat & pan fry the next morning with a runny egg on top. It's so delicious. Do it.\\n-Adult milkshakes. My go-to is the Nutty Cup. Peanut butter, chocolate ice cream and booze... Ain't nothing wrong with that. \\n\\nCons:\\n- Terribly inconsistent. At a glance, I'd say that's there has been a pretty big turn over in staff since the place opened a little over 2 years ago. Maybe that has something to do with it...\\nEither way, if you're going to charge $7.50 for a burger, not allow temperature requests and not include fries of any sort, ya gotta get that sh** right. I'm a medium rare type of girl, I'll accept medium. Several times I've gotten a burger and it was well done and dried out. That's half the appeal in eating a higher-quality, grass-feed beef! It's more safe and tasty than eating the cheaper, mass-produced meat with the DNA of 1000+ cows. Cook it so it's most enjoyable please!\\nAdditionally, they're buns seem to change a lot. This week I got a bun that was straight up cold. Sometimes, you can also tell that they are serving frozen fries instead of their usual, nice hand-cuts.\\n-No more A-10 sauce! And I'm sick of it! For any of you who don't know, A-10 is the steak/BBQ sauce that they serve with the burger at Ten Tables, which is two doors down from Grass Fed. This is the best sauce that I've had of its kind, without a doubt. They served A-10 the first 6-12 months that Grass Fed was open. This past summer, I asked one of the people  at 10 Tables, (I won't say who), why in the world they would take that away? I had seen them working in both establishments frequently, and I had been dying from separation anxiety. Their answer, which they immediately tried to repair, was \\"Well the chefs at Grass Fed aren't really as talented.\\" They tried to reiterate their statement by explaining how labor-intensive the process of making the A-10 was, with the vast number of herbs and spices in the recipe. My thought; if that's really the case- make extra and have one of those employees who I see waking door-to-door anyways, bring the A-10 from Ten Tables to Grass Fed. \\n-No more poutine, and I'm sick of that too! Now granted, most of these cuts were made at the same time as a price cut. But it was cruel to make those two items oh-so-delicious and then take it away. Although the poutine was inconsistent too at times, I'd rather that than none. They also use to have a homemade garlic aioli that they use to put on some of the burgers instead of generic, jarred mayonnaise. I much preferred the aioli too, even when it did mean paying a couple more bucks. \\n-It really kills the whole vibe that they serve the jarred, crap condiments. You're restaurants name is Grass Fed Beef! You post fliers and tweet about the great farms that you're product comes from! So stick too it! You have two restaurants on the same block! I can't believe that it is totally unfeasible to make your own ketchup, mayonnaise, mustard and a BBQ sauce of sorts. Instead, you pay $7.50 for a burger and get the same, preservative filled condiment brands that fast food chains offer. In the same conversation that I had with the individual at 10 Tables, they said \\"We felt like we were trying to make Grass Fed too much like 10 Tables.\\" Well, since you made that conclusion, I've cut my trips to Grass Fed from about once per week to about once every-other-month. And, I can't afford to go to 10 Tables once a week like I use to back in the days of A-10 and poutine. \\n-I'm always disappointed every time I try something new. Last month I tried the Thanksgiving Burger. Turkey burger with cranberry sauce essentially. It was saturated in that bitter cranberry sauce. I thought it was inedible. My boyfriend took one for the team and gave me his Devil and tried to eat the special despite the pucker face it was giving him. (We're both big fans of cranberry sauce normally.) \\nBlack bean burger- great burger, ruined with way too much crappy mayonnaise that wasn't in the menu description on the chalk-board. \\n-It's incredibly uncomfortable to sit in there. They have aluminum, high bar-stools which are pretty much the most uncomfortable chair I've ever had to sit in. \\nTake out results in soggy burgers.\\nAll in all, great concept currently being executed poorly.. In the last year, most of the time I regret spending the $30+ for two burgers, 1 fry and maybe two special $2 beers. \\n\\nHope this essay will give a fair perspective to other JP locals!"},{"name":"Taco Bell","address":"8300 NE Vancouver Plaza Dr","city":"Vancouver","stars":"2","text":"I wouldn't even give it a start.

I was satisfied after devouring my half, not quite full but not hungry anymore either. \\n\\nOverall I wasn't blown away, but I wasn't disappointed either. There's nothing in the flavors that necessarily stands Naked out from the pizza crowd and I wouldn't totally rave about them per say... but I really like their commitment to all natural, plus they don't have a history of exploitation (looking at you, Upper Crust), and so I'll probably put Naked on my pizza radar.

I asked her if it was supposed to be this tough and she said the dry aging process is different and can affect the meat. She offered to send it back and give me a new one, but my husband was already eating and I didn't want to disrupt our meal by waiting for another steak so I declined. Also, she didn't make sense because the dry aging process breaks down the muscle which would make the meat more tender, and this definitely did not taste tender.\\n\\n80 percent done with my steak, I didn't finish all of the steak considering my jaw felt like it finished a marathon with the intense chewing and chomping into the steak.

I ordered their rendition of Boston Cream Cake: The plate was beautiful, I will give it that, but the cake itself was HORRENDOUS.  Not just bland or plain or average, it was truly disgusting and if I hadn't paid $10 for it,  I would have left it on my plate.  The cake was dry, the cream was thick and sticky (not rich and creamy), the chocolate ganache was old and drying, and it tasted like it had recently been defrosted.  My boyfriend ordered the date pudding cake which should be full of flavor and that too was a disappointment.\\n\\nThe Service: Now here is where Top of the Hub has a chance to excel.  Not the case.  After seeing the standard menu, we decided that we'd prefer the lounge menu - this turned out to mean that we had to be re-seated in another part of the restaurant  - I can both understand and forgive this (except for the fact that the side of the restaurant we were in was half empty).  HOWEVER, after being re-seated, we had 3 different waiters, none of whom, shockingly, could be there when we needed them.  They were rude, slow, and inconsistent - being asked what I want to drink 3 times is the sign of a poorly run restaurant; then having to wait for that drink makes the problem even worse.\\n\\nSummary: good view, everything else is horrid.\\n\\nRecommendation: Go to McDonald's for dinner (at least that food has flavor) and then go to the 50th floor skywalk instead"},{"name":"Elsi's Restaurant","address":"6601 Burnet Rd, Ste 300","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"Elsi's is pretty unassuming, sitting on Burnet, next to some trade shops, adorned with some very boring exterior design.

I am almost certain they cranked out the (probably ready-to-mix) doughs, filled them with my desired fillings, and THEN fried and/or griddled them.\\n\\npinach and mushroom For my Salvadorian empanada, I went with the spinach and mushroom filling. It was very orange in color and had a little sweetness. The very robust filling benefited from the creamy, gooeyness of the cheese. It was very small, but it was crafted with a refined hand. It was a tad on the oily side.\\n\\nThe pupusa, which is a gordita, sort of a flattened corn-based disk with assorted fillings, was not as thick as I would have like, but the pork and cheese filling was just hearty enough to pair with the hearty dough. There was great corn flavor and a very nice crust, to boot.\\n\\nThe salsa was sort of boring, though it contained a nice kick. The cabbage salad was OK, merely just providing a refreshing crunch.\\n\\nThis establishment is a fine fit for Austin; it provides the right amount of ethnic flare without too much fanciness or jankiness.

The guy behind us swore he got there before us, but we were already in line when he walked in 5 minutes after us. Here's my review for the 5 dishes we tried. \\n\\nXiao long bao was bland and the pork was sour. I could feel each ground of pork and that's really unpleasant. Flavor of the broth was lacking and the dipping sauce just made the whole bite even more sour. \\n\\nGreen beans just tasted smokey, with some pleasant flavors, still not enough for me to go back for seconds. Definitely not the same as the saut√©ed green beans you'd typically find at Chinese restaurants. Not great, not bad, not recommended.\\n\\nHoisin duck baozi was good. Nothing to praise, just good. \\n\\nBeef ho fun was the biggest disappointment. You can't really mess up this dish and yet I sat there thinking of all the ways I'm going to doctor up the dish once I get home. Typically, this noodle dish is sweet and salty, but all I could taste was the same smokey flavor I found in the green beans. At least the beef was nicely cooked. \\n\\nLastly the only dish that we actually enjoyed was the Shanghai pork and shrimp noodles. Great flavor and soft noodles. Still not enough to bring me back. \\n\\nI don't understand how some of the food was good and others tasted like their was no effort put into the recipe. For having a dozen items on your menu, I'd expect each item to be spectacular. I really wanted to like this place because it's new and in an area where people who don't know traditional Chinese food can enjoy some real Chinese comfort foods. Please save your money and go to an actual Chinese restaurant to savor the real deal. This place is overpriced and you don't bang for your buck."},{"name":"Home Slice Pizza","address":"1415 S Congress St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"Good new york style pizza, cool atmosphere."},{"name":"Blue Dahlia Bistro","address":"1115 E 11th St","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"On vacation I don't like eating at the same place twice, because I love checking out new places.

However, it is the perfect description of Andina. Everything from the white tablecloth atmosphere, to the exquisite plating of dishes makes for an \\"upscale\\" the dining experience. \\n\\nThey offer a wide variety of tapas along with entrees that will suit most palates. I so desperately wanted to try their ceviche, however unfortunately, my dining companion is not a big fan of seafood (or vegetables). \\n\\nWe ended up sharing the carne (meat) empanadas which were quite tasty. They were nicely fried - crispy on the outside without being overly oily. The beef filling was nicely seasoned with spices, raisins and also olives. \\n\\nI'm not the biggest olive fan, so that threw me off, but even so they were excellent empanadas. I also particularly enjoyed the heat from the accompanying \\"salsa criolla\\", comprised of onions, tomatoes and chilies. \\n\\nI ordered the Lomo Saltado as my main. For those who don't know, it's a stir-fry dish with Chinese origins comprised of marinated beef steak, onions, tomatoes served with fried potato slices and rice. \\n\\nAndina's version of the dish was by far the \\"fanciest\\" version I've had with its garlic rice and Yukon potato fries arranged in an almost Stonehenge-like fashion. The steak was tender and quite flavorful. The portions were generous. The aioli paired well with the fritas and rice. I would definitely order it again. \\n\\nMy buddy ordered the cr√®me br√ªl√©e trio, which he enjoyed. It came with 3 different (supposedly rotating) flavors. As far as the drinks go, my pisco sour was good but a bit too sweet. Less sugar and more bitters perhaps? My friend enjoyed his mojito-esque drink though.\\n\\nOverall, Andina is a restaurant I would definitely go back to and recommend.

I walked in once just to take a look and the second time some weeks later to have lunch there with a friend. In both cases the staff could not have been friendlier or more welcoming. 5 stars for the staff, for sure.\\n\\nFood came up fast - no complaints there. Taste? Boring as hell. I had the \\"L.A. is my Lady\\" on a vegetarian patty and my friend had the \\"Cabo Diablo\\" on a turkey patty. The names are cool and the descriptions on the menu sound great, but what a disappointment when we bit into these burgers! I so expected a place that is only a burger place would be really good. Wrong. My patty immediately fell apart and started plopping out of my burger, leaving me holding a bun full of condiments and other stuff and my friend's burger, while it held together was described by him as \\"boring as hell\\". Seems to me that each burger was over $9 which wouldn't be bad if it came with something but that's only the burger. We bought onion rings for $4.99 and got about 7 onion rings in total. The beer (lager) was cold and good but I can get that anywhere! \\n\\nSo, two really boring and almost tasteless burgers, plus a total of 7 onion rings and two beers was around $40.00. \\n\\nI can think of a lot better places where we can spend $40 and walk out happy. Plus, the place has zero atmosphere. It's modern with clean lines but really just feels like a high-end McDonald's. Nothing special at all about it. \\n\\nThis place isn't going to last. Even if the burgers came with fries, they are just too boring and people in the area are not going to pay that. Once, maybe. Twice?

But...I'm not sure why people consider this to be such a great place.  Here's the run down for brunch.\\n     1.  You wait in line to order; I've waited over 30 minutes before.\\n     2.  The food is hearty, and looks to be priced well, but it's deceptive.      Lets say you want pancakes...that seems cheap, but add on an O.J. and a side of fruit, and you probably top off around 12 bucks.  I'd normally consider that cheap, but not when I have to wait in line for 30 minutes and no table service.\\n     3.  You don't get a seat until you get a food.

We chose to simply order four small plates of tapas, but before describing them, the bread and... salsas?... are worth commenting on.\\n\\nThere were three dips in an array of spicinesses which were a lovely complement to the slightly-sweet dinner-roll bread that was served. My only complaint was the portions: for two of us, they gave us three rolls... which was too little. So when we asked for more bread, they gave us an additional six rolls... which was too much. \\n\\nWe ordered the grilled asparagus which was sublime, honestly one of the best grilled asparagus dishes I've ever had. It is VERY difficult to get the proper blend of charring that gives the grilled flavor while keeping the asparagus crisp and tasty, but Andina nailed it in spades. A seriously perfect example of a dish.\\n\\nNext up was the greens salad; it was quite good, but the only remarkable thing were the toasted seeds (of some no doubt native Peruvian variety with which I am unfamiliar). They provided a great flavor against the little cubes (as in 2mm) of cheese. All in all, a nice dish, but perhaps simply overwhelmed by the rest of the meal.\\n\\nThird was the chicken skewers, accompanied by a delicious sauce (hence part of the need for more bread...) They were lovely, but felt a bit skimpy for a $7 tapas-sized plate. There were only two, but they could have been either more substantial or jumped to more skewers on the plate. \\n\\nAnd last was a potato fritatta with aioli. It was good, and I can't really find anything bad I'd want to say about it, but it didn't jump out at me... it felt like starch that would be best served as a side dish, rather than a stand-alone small-plate. \\n\\nThe service was the lowlight of the experience. It wasn't bad, just indifferent. I had to ask for a refill for my ice tea instead of having it just magically appear, and when I asked for more bread, I had to ask twice (perhaps that's why they gave me so &^#*@!#! many rolls!)\\n\\nI'd go back for dinner and drinks, but I'd likely order different things from the menu.

Bottom line: food is good, but cataclysmically overpriced.\\n\\nWe ordered the Asparagus Benny and Fried Egg BLT. Imagine a very small English muffin with two small eggs, a sprinkle of pancetta, and a few pieces of asparagus--that's the Benny for $18. Yes, 1-8. The hollandaise allegedly had truffle in it, but you couldn't taste it. That's how they get you! Who would even be able to taste truffle in a sauce as rich as a hollandaise? They probably don't even put any in it, so unless your hollandaise has gold leaf in it, Launderette, please get over yourself. The BLT was tasty, but was $12--no sides.\\n\\nService was either spotty or spot-on. Our friend got an attitude from one waitress for accepting the wrong drink order who then proceeded to take one of the drinks directly to another table. So, not so big on food safety here. Sure it's hip and a place for people to see other people, but you're paying for it.

I wish he didn't listen to me this one time.\\n\\nHe called a month in advance to make the reservation and asked specifically for a window seat. The day of our reservation he called in to confirm that we indeed had a window seat, in which the hostess gave him a firm yes. We get to the restaurant exactly at 8pm (our reservation time) and whoops, they gave the table to someone else.  They quickly gave us another table, but it was much smaller and it was NOT a window seat. When my boyfriend explained that he called ahead and made sure it was at the window, the guy that brought us to the table just looked fed up with us. (And listen dude, it's not that much to ask for when we absolutely requested it ahead of time.) So we head back to the hostess and let her know that we would rather have a window seat and she looked aggravated. She said the wait time for the next window seat is 30-45 minutes and that 3 groups were ahead of us. . . She did not give one single ounce of sympathy. My boyfriend didn't want to make a scene so we just took the small table but that ruined the night for me. TERRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE, TERRIBLE TERRIBLE TERRIBLE.  NO ONE EVER APOLOGIZED FOR THEIR LACK OF ORGANIZATION. They made it feel like we were inconveniencing Them!\\n\\nWaitress was ok, they were understaffed so our waitress had a LOT of tables to take care of.\\n\\nFood was eh, nothing to rave about. Let's be honest, people go there for the VIEW. My boyfriend didn't mind his food but I was not a fan of mine. Maybe I still had the bitter taste of bad customer service lingering in my mouth.\\n\\nThe only thing i was really looking forward to was the Creme br√ªl√©e dessert! But instead the waitress brought out a chocolate cake with ice cream, with a candle for my birthday. And yes, the gesture was nice but I really wanted the Creme br√ªl√©e. when the bill came out, she charged us for the cake...that we didn't want... not sure why... \\n\\nThey are lucky they have a view no other restaurant has, because otherwise, there's no way they can survive. And I thought maybe I was just being overly annoyed because it was my birthday and I didn't get what I wanted but I read other reviews and customers had similar gripes (hostess/staff not giving a damn about the customers)\\n\\nAnd you might ask, why didn't she read the reviews before she went there? It's because I've been there years before with a friend for restaurant week and no one was there so the experience was good. So I expected the same level of enjoyment the second time around.  \\n\\nManagement needs to do something about this.

My one gripe (and this is my fault) is that I didn't realize that the spicy miso was \\"spicy\\" from the addition of lots of chili oil. It honestly wasn't super spicy and it was waaaay too oily for me; I have a very sensitive stomach. While it was delicious and I finished the bulk of it, the oil will probably leave me feeling gross all day. Again, my stomach is very sensitive to stuff like this so it may not be too oily for the average diner. If I lived in Boston I'd for sure come back and try something else!!  As it is, I was disappointed that oil was the only way to make the miso spicy. In terms of portions, I'd say the bowls are quite generous. Lotssss of noodles. I can't imagine still being hungry after eating here, but if you are, just go to JP Licks across the street for ice cream. I think that, for most people/hunger levels, these portions are perfect.

So given that my buddies and I were unable to partake in our Austin ritual of dining at Veggie Heaven (not open until noon on Sundays and we were already up and at 'em at 10:30), I was able to negotiate a detour to this place instead.  After all, I'd be a fool  to not exploit an Austin trip for a delicious vegan meal, as those are deficient in Houston (less so recently, but still . . . ).  \\n\\nAnyway, this new location is notably more cramped, although not very homey feeling.  It was typical Austin-y somehow, but not too bad.  We had to wait twenty or so minutes to be seated as it turns out this vegetarian joint seems to be quite popular (Oh Austin, I miss you!).  Once seated the service was indeed quite spotty.  It was borderline frustrating, hence the four stars instead of five, but it was moderately busy and our waitress was otherwise on point.  \\n\\nThe Renedict, veganized - absolutely flipping amazing.  Like I really really want to eat it every day, for the rest of my life.  No lie Yelp friends, this place has the most delicious tofu scramble, I've ever had, STILL.  And I've have a buttload of the stuff, let me tell you.  It's deliciously flavored with silghtly crisp nutritional yeast and lord knows what else, probably a little piece of Heaven in every single bite?!  It's possible.  Anyway, it was hella delicious, but I will admit I have no point of reference as I've never consumed an omnivore Eggs Benedict, but I'm quite okay with that.  The black beans I ordered as a side were pretty all right, not bland, not SUPER salted (don't you hate that?), and they surely satified my protein needs.  I also had a mimosa and coffee (guess who won that battle?  MIMOSA!) - both pretty delicious at the time.  \\n\\nSo my two friends, they both loved it!  Score!  As I've more than once led them astray into some pretty questionable restaurants and other such establishments.  They are now true believers of Boudlin Creek Coffee House & Cafe, Veggie Heaven, watch yoself!  \\n\\nThis isn't a five star review because, as touched upon earlier, the service left much to be desired.  I realize they were rather busy, so the waitress had to tend to many other tables, but it seemed she just didn't much care to check on us, and I had to make it a point to catch her attention.  She also kept forgetting our few requests (when we finally got them in), so I had to remind her, which is fine and all, but anyway!\\n\\nOh, I had the Renedict hours later and it was still quite yummy - I'm assuming actual eggs would not have fared as well during the 2 and half hour drive home, but man, that tofu scramble . . .

We wish we had gotten bread to soak up the sauce.  The octopus was also very good - and we're glad we got the large so we had enough.  We ended up dipping the octopus in the lime butter that came with our scallops.

Many seafood places, such as Legal Seafoods, serve a SELECTION of oysters caught from different parts of the Atlantic.  Union oyster house has one variety, and they were not that good.  It tasted like they had been shucked hours before and kept in the fridge: drier and more rubbery than I would expect.  \\n\\nThe rest of the food was cooked ok, but everything just lacked flavor and it all needed plenty of salt and/or pepper to make it palatable.  Asparagus was just steamed with no spices, the potatoes were just boiled and drizzled with some oil, even the Caesar salad dressing tasted watered down.  On the plus side, I liked the stuffing for my haddock, the chowder was very good, and our waitress was awesome.\\n\\nThis is the type of food I'd expect to eat at some dive mom and pop seafood restaurant for 1/3 the price.

It's not exactly nuclear science, but there is also not a great deal of nuance here. Either a sub is good, to start with, or it isn't and then, as Mies van der Rohe (who was at Harvard, just down the road apiece) said, \\"God is in the details.\\"\\n\\nAnd my sub sandwich details, mutatis mutandis, are no doubt different from every other judge of these things for whom these matters are of great moment--think about it. What could be more important? The little things that added together make up your idea of a great sub, at a cost of about six bucks. Or how a white cloth restaurant prepares an entree that they present and then persuade you to ease 30, 35 bucks out of your wallet to pay for?\\n\\nI'll go for the submarine sandwich every time as a criterion for testing one's mettle as a judge of what makes this one great, and that one only good.\\n\\nBut, as I said, I don't know the subs at Armando's and so I am not qualified to say anything about Jack's remarks, except that he is a little confused on the question of location.\\n\\nIn my estimation, the really strong suit at Armando's lies in the calzones. The pizza is a good effort, but timid, as if not to offend. The ingredients are all fresh and wholesome, and they will cook a pizza to order (why it never occurs to more people, for example to order a pizza well done is beyond me... the Maillard effect on even the most pedestrian of pizza dough is an astonishing thing, and ordering a pizza well-done, especially at Armando's, is one step to significant improvement; and of course it also helps the other ingredients, especially the toppings if they endure a little bit more of the process of caramelization). But the calzones are uniformly quite quite good, and I endorse the high rating of Armando's merely for these.\\n\\nI'll revisit the pizza and try the subs, on the strength of Jack's recommendation, but first I have to survive the next two months in the south of France, at my house in the deep rural areas of wine growing country for AOC Cotes de Provence and Coteaux Varois appellations, too little appreciated, because too little known, in any part of Cambridge, never mind West Cambridge, where they should know better.\\n\\nFor my money, for what it's worth, the much better submarine sandwiches (on a speculative basis, as I've never honestly compared them) and pizza comes from a place called Village Kitchen (the name derives from the fact that it is the heart of Huron Village) just a few more blocks further west on Huron Avenue, and likely unknown to a San Franciscan out on a Cantabrigian spree, because it's best known to too small a number of natives, who cherish the knowledge.\\n\\nThe meatball sub, and the eggplant parmigian, which are my varietal touchstones for submarine sandwich quality, are ne plus ultra. They're also reasonably sized, as I don't think being gigando is a measure of quality, or even, possibly, food value. But then I'm always mindful of my caloric intake.\\n\\nProbably already on here at Yelp and if so, I'll add a more direct review, but maybe not till I've had my fill of wood-fired oven Provencal pizza, which is another matter entirely."},{"name":"Sushi Me","address":"3655 SW Hall Blvd","city":"Beaverton","stars":"3","text":"If there were a negative number of stars, I would be giving this I Love Sushi a negative 5 stars....I have never been so appalled by such HORRIBLE customer service.

She looked annoyed and said she would ask if we could still do that since they closed at 9. When we got the okay we started to get food. And she would come every other minute to ask if we were done with the buffet yet because they wanted to close it down. This really bothered me. I understand what time they close and I get wanting to close down as much as possible so you can get out on a decent time. I work at a restaurant so I completely get how bothersome it can be when guest come in so close to close. But that does not mean you treat them the way she treated us. She and the manager both came over to rush us to eat and get out. We left within 20 minutes because it was so uncomfortable trying to eat when you are being nagged to hurry up.

I'm very anxious to try them once they're really up and running. The other reviews have talked about long wait times and scattered servers, which we were fortunate enough not to experience, but even if we had of, this is their first week. I have to cut them some slack. Especially now that I've tasted the food. I had the smoked turkey sandwich with the and my boyfriend got the pulled pork sandwich. Both of us agreed that the meat, even without barbeque sauce,was so flavorful and tender. We also got the gouda mac and cheese which I highly recommend - very creamy and tasted homemade. If the rating was for food alone, they would have gotten 5 stars. HOWEVER, one unprofessional incident by a server prevents me from giving this place five stars. While I highly recommend vising this establishment, if you have the misfortune to get Isabella as your waitress, I'd recommend asking for a new server. She, thankfully, wasn't our server but she did deliver some food to our table and was extremely rude to our server. Our server was very friendly and personable and is a great server in my opinion. Isabella delivered our appetizer and then things got weird. It appeared that she was criticizing the way our server entered our order. Right in front of us. She had attitude to spare and didn't seem too concerned that she was insulting our server right in front of us. I made sure that our server reported this incident to the manager because in the restaurant business, bad service can severely damage a restaurant, even one that serves good food.

It has three dining areas (that I could see) so it can fit a lot of people. Reservations is recommended since it's usually packed. They have a musician playing guitar who is quite good. His music isn't distracting at all. I think it actually enhanced the mood if the restaurant. As for the food--fabulous. We got three small tapas to split amongst four of us as an appetizer. My favorite was the Atun Fusion, which was very thinly sliced tuna with some kind of sweet peanut sauce. Didn't care too much for the sauce but the tuna was excellent-I preferred that by itself. Another plate was Trio de papas y Salsa Peruanas-a medley of potatoes with various sauces. The pairing of sauce-potato was great. Unfortunately, this plate is served cold and I think if the potatoes were served warm, I would've enjoyed it exponentially. \\n\\nFor my entree, I got the Quinotto. The best part of it was the quinoa risotto. I had forgotten the description of what I ordered so when I took the first spoonful of the quinoa I was surprised by the flavor. There is some type of cheese (tastes like blue cheese) that topped the risotto. Fortunately, I like blue cheese. It does have a sharp, strong flavor, so stay away from this dish if you don't like blue cheese. Loved the risotto. The one thing I didn't like about my entree was the broccolini that came on the side. It was so bitter. I took one bite and knew that if I forced myself to eat it, it would have ruined my whole experience. It was tossed in truffle oil, but dang, that didn't save it. \\n\\nLook to spend $12-40 for tapas (depending on the size) and $20-40 for entrees."},{"name":"Mary Mac's Tea Room","address":"224 Ponce De Leon Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Very nice home cooking southern food experience.

Also, fair warning that I am getting tired of the trend of tiny portions of food at too high a price.\\n\\nBrunch, Sunday, came as they opened. Seated on the nice back patio - lovely! I chose salad nicoise ($14) and my friend chose the Americana platter ($12). Both of us ordered green tea, then the peaches and cream donuts to split. \\n\\nFirst, you should know that we scraped our plates clean. It tasted delicious. Whatever my other comments, the food is well prepared here.  Thanks Chef! Nice wait staff.  Cool makeover of a laundrette to a restaurant.  I like this place!  Check out the hummingbird wallpaper in the bathroom, love it! \\n\\nLowlights: portions, omg. On my salad (which I'm going to say was a \\"take\\" on traditional salad nicoise) was big on some nice greens. Decent, maybe 3 oz portion of tuna though not a hair of a fraction more. OK so far - tuna is pricey everywhere, right. What made me grumpy: I had 3, count em, 3 green beans (menu says I would get wax). I had not even a whole little red potato, I had 3 1-inch cubes of potato.  No olives what-so-ever, though I was crazy about the olive sauce drizzle they put on top of everything.  I could have eaten that with a spoon. And 4 thin slices of egg, not a whole egg. If you google salad nicoise, the photos show a ton more food than I got.\\n\\nMy friend liked her Americana, but again, for $12 I'm expecting more.  We shared tastes, I thought the hen-of-the-woods had nice flavor but it had a long tough stem. Her portions of bacon and of mushroom were quite small. Her plate also included one piece of toast, a roasted tomato and a small garnish of greens. It was nice, not great, although hey, it's mainly  just eggs and bacon. But that bacon portion was pitiful as was the hen of the woods.\\n\\nThe donuts were fabulous. Loved my green tea and the way it was served. \\n\\nAll this came to $42, $50 with tip.

The patio is pleasant even though it's right on Piedmont.\\n\\nOrder at the counter and then pick out your seat. You can customize your own burger or get one of Grindhouse's signature styles that come in junior (1/4 pound patty) or double (1/4 pound patty x 2) sizes. The name doesn't lie, killer burgers indeed.\\n\\nI had the Grindhouse style burger recently during Atlanta Burger Week. A junior size was $5 though normally it's $5.50. The Grindhouse sauce that is well-coated inside the burger is something like thousand island dressing which I am typically neutral about but it goes well here. You'll also get American cheese, lettuce, pickles, and grilled onions. The Yankee burger is tasty too; it features blue cheese, bacon, lettuce, and grilled onions. I've found that the burgers are a little small though. Perhaps get more sides or a milkshake? The latter, I have yet to try.\\n\\nAs for those sides, Grindhouse serves crinkle-cut fries which aren't my preferred style of fried potato so I usually get something else. I got a small Caesar salad ($5.50) the last time and was satisfied with it. Not the best salad on the planet, but hey, Grindhouse isn't a salad store. And it was a generous size.

So even if you're not a fan of watching sports or your company there's a host of options to keep you entertained. The only thing I'd want to add but couldn't afford is the excellent service from the bartender Amanda. Even with a lack of staff she had no trouble multi tasking with accuracy for both our food and drink orders. This made me happy to use my unbroken legs to help her out if needed. \\n\\nFirst we ordered the hummus plate which had a nice variety of fresh topping's but could have used more pita bread. I ordered the Blitz Dip which tasted good and was a hearty portion but overall a little too salty. My g/f's burger on the other hand must have been out of sight because that's how quickly it disappeared! My only complaint was once it started to fill up the jute box overpowered the TV volume, which detracted from the games.

A friend of mine and I decided to have an impromptu late lunch on Wednesday afternoon.\\n\\nThe view was great.\\n\\nLarry our server came up, and his demeanor was off-putting to start. It was far too casual, and almost bumbling. It put me off immediately. Having not researched, but knowing it was Restaurant Week, my friend asked if he could see a Restaurant Week menu. The server proceeded to tell us, \\"Well lunch ended at 2:30, and dinner starts at 5:30, but I can get it for you.\\" It was around 3:30 at this point, and his response what a bit patronizing. Obviously we could've done the research beforehand, but this smugness was uncalled for. Clearly we weren't looking to wait two additional hours to have the dinner menu, so we declined his generous offer to get us the useless Restaurant Week menu.\\n\\nMy friend ordered a drink immediately, a Ruby Manhattan I believe, which he loved. I settled on a glass of Cabernet on Larry's suggestion, and it was fantastic. \\n\\nMy friend ordered a Pulled Pork sandwich, which was served with chips. He said it was ok. He did finish his entire plate, so it must have been pretty good.  I had the 3-course $40 menu, and started with a Cobb Salad which was you know, a Cobb Salad. Good.\\n\\nI ordered my steak medium rare, and it came out mostly well, with some med well pieces, and maybe a low-rent chain's definition of medium. It was a very thin cut of beef, so I made sure to cut it all into slices to get a better sense of how overcooked it was. It was bad. The well done pieces tasted of char, or as my friend said \\"Like a really bad Burger King burger.\\"\\n\\nLarry never did a check back with us, and never asked me how I was enjoying my meal. It was pretty slow, and I saw him walk by a few times, but he didn't stop by once to ask how our meals were. He even came by and cleared my friends dish away, all the while I had barely touched my steak. He eventually comes over to remind me I have Creme Brulee coming. I'm a pretty big dude, so if he actually thought a small Cobb Salad, and a bite or two of steak filled me up, that's a poor judgment call. At this point I finally get to tell him how overdone the steak was (this was about 15 minutes after he had cleared my friend's plate). He told me in his opinion it was medium, and asked me if I wanted to have another one. We had been there for an hour at this point, so I canceled my dessert and told Larry I was all set for the afternoon.\\nA few minutes later our server came back, clearly just elected Mayor of Excuses Mountain, and said it was the lighting in the dining room, and if I went into the kitchen I could see that it was medium. This was a major problem for a couple reasons.\\n\\n1) Don't give me a lame excuse 30 minutes after my food was served.\\n2) The lighting there during an afternoon is mostly dominated my the natural light coming from the windows the are on the perimeter of the restaurant. It wasn't inundated with neon signs or anything quite like that. \\n3) Maybe it did look medium in the kitchen that really is a moot point. I ordered medium rare. Thanks for telling me that my steak was still overcooked if I looked at in the bright lights of the kitchen.\\n\\nI was so furious at this point I asked for a manager. 5 minutes late the manger stopped by, and he was friendly if not convincing during his speech. While I was explaining the situation, he actually interrupted me to tell my friend he looked familiar. Which was both rude and creepy.  He offered a dessert plate as an apology, which I declined at first, but gave in on the second query as I was actually starving and a little tipsy off the wine on an empty stomach.\\n\\nThe plate had creme brulee, two tarts with coconut ice cream scooped inside, and a chocolate/boston cream pie thing. It looks delicous. The creme brulee was good, not great. The sugar could've been under the torch a couple more seconds, but it was still good. The Boston Cream Pie was a little bland, and dry. The coconut ice cream was very, very good however.\\n\\nAll in all it was poor food, the was made more unappealing by the horrendous service. While we had the dessert plate Larry avoided eye contact with us, and wouldn't even bus our dessert even though we had put our napkins on the serving plate (he was very prompt at all other times of the meal). We finally had to call out for him for the bill, and we were off, never to return.\\n\\nAs we were leaving WE wished the host a good afternoon, as he ignored us upon our exit, which truly was the most appropriate farewell."},{"name":"King + Duke","address":"3060 Peachtree Rd NW","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Four scallops for $27. 8:00 reservation and we were seated at 9:00.

Strangely the best tables in the center of the dining room were never filled by 830pm.\\n\\nWe never really knew who our waitress was. Lots of people sort of walking around and sharing tables when they seemingly felt like it. No one especially passionate about anything. Drinks took forever, sometimes missing the course they were to be paired with. Food courses separated by long stretches of time. The entire meal took almost 3 hours. \\n\\nThe room is cool. Reminded me of something you might see in Barcelona with modest furnishings, bright colors and hip art. But my biggest problem with Townsman is it's too hip for its own good.

Like jeans and sneakers. That's why I think Townsman is just TOO EXPENSIVE. The service and approach to customers need a lot of work to justify charging $250 for a dinner for 2. If I it weren't so expensive I would have cared less about the lack of warmth and hospitality from the hostess, the hidden table and the very casual and slow service. \\n\\nI would have gone with 2 1/2 stars if I could but thought 2 was too low in light of the food."},{"name":"Garden Caf√©","address":"810 W Colonial Dr","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"My husband and I are new transplants to orlando and the food scene here is quite bad (all chain restaurants, very little that is innovative).

I'm not sure what prompted me to check out the yelp page for Home Slice today, as I have been going there for years, and in fact I haven't been in probably a few months...I guess I was just bored at work. Anyway, I'm writing because there are too many people on here saying that this pizza is not THAT good, or nothing to write home about. I am from New Jersey, and I have eaten the best pizza that New York and New Jersey have to offer, and I'm telling you, Home Slice rates. It is not the absolute best slice of pizza I have ever had, but it is in the top ten, without a doubt. My girlfriend's parents, who are both Jersey born and raised, came out to visit and we took them to Home Slice, and they both agreed it was the best pizza they had had in a long time. \\n\\nI understand that there is probably a certain amount of assumed snobbiness associated with my saying \\"I'm from New Jersey\\", and implying that you should take my word on pizza as gospel. I guess there is some truth to that, but honestly there is a lot of really good pizza in the New York and New Jersey, and it is reasonably hard to come by once you leave the tri-state area. Now, I'm sure lots of people aren't going to like New York style pizza as much if they didn't grow up eating it...those people are going to prefer the pizza that reminds them of the pizza they are used to. Therefore, plenty of people are going to eat Home Slice and say \\"this isn't very good\\", and they're not wrong, because it is obviously an opinion. If you grew up eating Domino's, then you think of pizza as tasting like Domino's pizza, and Domino's pizza and pizza are two completely different things, so NY style pizza would be a letdown. I get that. \\n\\nMy point is that, if you're looking for New York style pizza in Austin, Texas, Home Slice is a very accurate representation. If Home Slice moved to New York, it would stay in business.

I've only been in Boston a few weeks and needed real food after an exhausting day at work. I was heading towards the Chinese food restaurant across the street when, to my surprise, I spotted a Dominican restaurant. I was so excited.. Real Hispanic food was in my future! \\n\\nBeing a NewYoRican raised in an Italian neighborhood in the Bronx, my Spanish is conversational at best but I always try to pull as much English out of Spanish speakers as possible. That being said, no one working spoke a lick of English but my waitress certainly tried her best to communicate effectively.\\n\\nThe music playing was loud, but you could still see that people were able to hold a conversation comfortably over it. There were a few families at tables and a table of gentlemen all watching the game over beers. I sat at the bar only because I was alone. \\n\\nI throughly read through the menu before placing my order. That night I was on a budget so I went for inexpensive and classic: Mofongo de Pollo and a plate of rice and beans. Both were reasonably priced. \\n\\nI was served in a timely manner and the presentation was just fine. Both plates tasted good but nothing to really brag about. The hook here and reason for my two stars was one smaller kicker that made all the difference. My waitress recommended a passion fruit juice and I said sure. I noticed as she served me in a large glass filled with ice, that it was from a gallon of Tampico. No huge problem there, but when I saw my bill and realized they charged me $4 for 6oz of Tampico, I was completely turned off by the restaurant.

The typical meal is single or double 1/4 lb patty on grocery store sized egg bun, with whatever toppings you get.  You can go custom, or you can get some suggested combos like the Cowboy (bacon, cheese, barbecue sauce), the Apache (the item on the CL list, with cooked onions and chilis, plus cheese) or some selections with pimento cheese, something that interests me not.  My double Cowboy came with krinkle fries and beverage, and ran about $12.50.  \\n\\nThe burger?  Bacon was good (BIG surprise, right?), cheddar cheese was gooey and irresistable, and meat was pretty good.  Fries seemed double-fried:  crispy outside, fluffy inside.  Probably the best krinkles I've had, but still nothing spectacular.  Onion rings were thickly breaded and good. Neither fries nor rings were greasy at all, in fact, the rings mini-tray barely had any trace of oil in it when the rings were gone.  Everything was LIGHTLY seasoned - the burger improved from salt and pepper, the fries were barely kissed with seasoning salt (but perfectly fine that way) and the rings definitey needed salt.\\n\\nI loved the upbeat mood of the place and the employees were very nice.  The quirky robot decor was fun, and a single \\"Gnome Be Gone\\" was added to shake things up.  \\n\\nVerdict?

Shorts and a shirt for the summertime have been my dress code and its never been a problem.  However there is a new sheriff in town, Matt the guy working in the Pro shop; he doesn't like it if you are not dressed up as much as he is in a tie.  Sorry Matt hitting golf balls in a business suit on a hot summer day is not fun.  So Matt told me I can't hit range balls because I was not dressed up enough. Oh man don't let me bring this place to its knees with my nautica shirt and Calvin Klein shorts, oh nooooooo. I am hitting range balls dude, get a grip, the parking lot isnt even full on a saturday and you are turning away customers. I am sure the owners are quite delighted in your actions and will continue to support you sending customers away all the time.

Upon realization, I had already eaten several bites (my girlfriend pointed it out to me before I noticed myself).\\n\\nSeverely disappointed and I think the staff needs to get their act together. The price is too high for a fast-food-like experience... And it's definitely not up to par with the Burgerfi in Alpharetta.\\n\\nWhat a shame."},{"name":"Home Slice Pizza","address":"1415 S Congress St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"Everytime I eat here, I get giddy.\\nWent here the other day so my mom could experience authentic Austin cuisine and she loved it just as much as I did.\\n\\nThis time I tried the peporoni, mushroom, and onion.  The onions are so cute, like thin little shoe string onions.  I also ordered a greek salad, which is also of course, yummy.\\nMy favorite thing is the ice they use in their drinks.  When our drinks arrived my mom and I looked at each other and were like \\"oooh, they have the good ice\\".  Haha.\\nNot only is it a good place to eat, but also a good place to tell your mother all your deepest darkest secrets.. like.. yes I do drink alcohol (I just turned 21).  Oh, and its not a good place to tell her that her house is haunted.. \\n\\nAnyway, love this place, love the food and the people.\\n\\nI do request one thing, for dessert you guys have milk and cookies.. can you make sure the cookies are fresh and warm?\\nThanks!"},{"name":"Frank","address":"407 Colorado St","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Before coming to Austin on vacation, I did a ton of research on where to find all things yummy.  All signs pointed to Frank.  Mostly because of the Red Headed Stranger (their infamous bloody mary) but also because of their super interesting hot dog menu.\\n\\nWe ate here our last night in town and I had been looking forward to it the entire week.  I must have brought up wanting to try it our at least once a day since we got into town on Monday.  Maybe Saturday night was a bad night to pick, but it went downhill 10 minutes into our dining experience, and it went downhill FAST.\\n\\nOur server was friendly and easy going, but as it got steadily busier and busier he seemed to get nerve wracked and over loaded.  Our food came out rather quickly and some guy who was not our server dropped it off.  We sat there for about 3ish minutes waiting to see our dude again to ask for silverware and napkins.  He asked who gave us our food and seemed PISSED we didn't have our silverware.  That's awkward..then..\\n\\nThe food.  Major, major bummer.  Seriously, how does one mess up a hot dog?  I'll tell you.  The bun..cold.  The dog..cold.  The \\"house made\\" pimiento cheese..nothing to write home about.  The grilled cole slaw..cold and definitely not grilled.  AT ALL.  And!  There was nothing \\"cole slaw-y\\" about it.  How about more like sliced up cabbage.  LAME.  I ate about 1/3 of my dog..\\n\\nWe order the fritters.  We had to ask for them after our food came out because our server forgot to put the order in.  When they did come out,  I was happily surprised that they were hot (that in itself is depressing) but they were bland and badly huge and boring and mushy and nasty.  That's all I have to say about those.  We each took one little bite and pushed it aside pretty much disgusted.  \\n\\nThe waffle fries were okay.  They, also, were not hot.  SUPER LAME.  Now - the bloody mary - pretty yummy.  That's the ONLY good thing about our dining experience.\\n\\nWhen our $40 check came (there were 2 of us), I thought we could have eaten better at a hot dog stand for under $15.  To top the horrible experience off we had to seek out someone to ring our bill up.  We seriously sat there for about 10 minutes waiting.  I don't think the service is actually bad, I think they are just understaffed, which sucks for them.\\n\\n Would I come back?  Not just no, but HELL NO.  \\n\\nSorry, Frank.  Get it together."},{"name":"Grass Fed","address":"605 Centre St","city":"Jamaica Plain","stars":"3","text":"This review is about Grass fed online delivery system and website. I live near Jackson Sq and when I punched in my address for delivery a message popped up saying that delivery wasn't available in my area -- it's .9 miles away..biking that's 7 minutes away. That's ridiculous. When I called I was told that it is most likely outside their delivery range...what?!  I would love to try their food and don't mind walking, but it seems unreasonable that they don't deliver to the Jackson Sq area. Hopefully the food will make up for this disappointment."},{"name":"King + Duke","address":"3060 Peachtree Rd NW","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"This was our 2nd visit to King + Duke and we were not disappointed.

The bar tender must've been having a bad night because she was less than welcoming and acted like she didn't want to be there.  Also. $4.50 for a draft beer seems a bit steep, especially when it wasn't that cold and kind of flat. Lousy atmosphere at the bar and an overall less5than satisfying experience.
