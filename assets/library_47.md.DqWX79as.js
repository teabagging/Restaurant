This dish was fantastic, despite being such a small portion.  The classic spaghetti and meatballs were quite decent but we were a bit disappointed by their famous lobster lasagna.  We were puzzled at the fact that everything we had was served piping hot but the lobster lasagna was just luke-warm.  We ended up just finishing it without complaints since we did not have much time and needed to leave shortly. \\n\\nIn the end, I contemplated on giving only 3 stars but the amazing bread and butter bumped it up to 4.

You know what that does?  It knocks about 100 calories off of your meal.  Does it taste bad?  Nope!\\n\\nPei Wei also has a gluten free menu, and let me tell you, those are hard to find.  Gluten is an ingredient in an enormous number of foodstuffs, so it's really a miracle to find an establishment that has actually made the effort to include some certifiable glutenlessness on their menu.\\n\\nMy only Hunan beef with this place (oh, that was just horrible, wasn't it?) is that their locations are sprinkled around the outerbelt.

I showed up at about 11:05 (they open at 11:00am) and voila, I was seated and waited upon immediately.  Going all out since I wanted to get the most of my experience in the short time I was there for, I ordered a Calamari Fritti and a Melenzane Parmigiano as starters (but only picked at both to leave room for the entree -ordering them both to-go knowing full well I wouldn't finish).

The Melenzane Parmigiano was alright, full of a cheesy tomatoey punch, but the calamari was a clear winner of the appetizers for me.\\n\\nThen for the entree, I went with the most popular dish on their menu, and for good reason, the Lobster Ravioli.  It was excellent.  Five Stars!  Bug chunks of lobster all stuffed into a homemade ravioli pasta, topped with a creamy sauce that complemented the lobster, just fantastic.  Very rich though, just a warning in case you don't like big flavor punches in the mouth as much as I do.\\n\\nA lot of other people complained about the service, and in particular about the rudeness of the staff and I have to say I experienced quite the opposite.

Someone knows how to fry food at this place. All of the ingredients were top notch and careful attention was paid to flavors. Tartar sauce was lemony, jalepeno maple syrup was perfectly balanced, French fries were crispy on the outside and salty! Really, everything was very good. \\n\\nDrinks: A fun list of specialty cocktails. I had the Betty Sloop and it was heaven for a grapefruit lover like me. Well balanced drink and served ice cold.\\n\\nAtmosphere: Fun and communal. \\n\\nNegatives:\\n1. Just a little too loud. The atmosphere was fun but I still had to shout over the music and everyone else shouting over the music. Vicious cycle...\\n2. A little bit of a long winded explanation of their \\"family style\\" approach.\\n\\nNotes: This place would be okay for kids if they were mildly adventurous eaters and liked seafood. Not necessarily great for a date, but a double date, yes. Everything is meant to be shared! Coat rack by the stairs! Woot!\\n\\nThey do run out of things but they'll let you know. I like this about restaurants, it shows they don't have a lot of old stuff on hand, everything is fresh!\\n\\nNot accessible unless they have another entrance of which I am not aware.

Unfortunately my entree reminded me of a pasta dish I once had at a Perkins Restaurant in Billings Montana. Seriously, I ordered the fettucini with shrimp and scallops (cannot remember the Italian name / title of it) and it was utterly underwhelming if not outright dissappointing. Lame would be the most apt description.\\n\\nMy cousin said his veal with mushroom and gargonzola sauce was not edible. I tried it and found it to be edible but, again, lame. \\n\\nOn a positive note, my caprese salad was okay; however, Eclipse da Luna does it a lot better (and for a fraction of the price). Like  Petite Auberge, prices here are not cheap.\\n\\nI will say that not everyone at my table disliked their food; however, we all agreed food was not served fresh and hot (as with past visits). Either we went on an off night or this place has fallen really far downhill.\\n\\nService was merely adequate. Not that it matters, but I did notice that the people running / staffing the place are more along the lines of Russian / Eastern European rather than New York / Italian. \\n\\nPerhaps this is what passes for fine Italian dining in Kiev or Bratislava.

Actually all the servers were helpful, courteous, and friendly.\\n\\nOn to the food: we ordered a variety of their Asian-inspired tapas, and we paid Boston prices for those tapas. That said, they are not of high quality. They were \\"meh.\\"  The figs with goat cheese were a disaster, placing a tiny fig on top of a huge piece of goat cheese made it feel like we were just eating a block of cheese and it wasn't even good goat--stop and shop brand? You are supposed to put goat cheese INSIDE the fig, which should be a larger fig.  We ordered probably 4 or 5 different tapas and I think the best word to describe them was unsophisticated.  We also ordered Chinese from the sister restaurant and had it brought over.  Again, the Chinese was B quality.  It's ok, I'd eat it again if someone really wanted to go there, but it's not even in my top 5.  If they want to charge the prices that they do for the tapas then they need to have some tasters come in and work with the chefs to actually get something palatable--it was just one plate of disappointment after another.\\n\\nThe drinks:  Inexperienced bartender?  All of the drinks are sugary sweet. We ordered at least 2 drinks each and couldn't find anything that wasn't sweet and poorly mixed.  The drinks were by far the largest disappointment of the evening.\\n\\nThe atmosphere:  Shoot and a miss.  They clearly tried to make a \\"classy lounge\\" atmosphere but it is awkward.  The tables are only along the side to make room for what I guess is a dance floor and it feels awkward having all that empty space around you while you're eating.  We all agreed the chairs are lounge chairs and make it difficult to sit up and eat your food.

Yes, salt is normal when you eat pretzels, but from my experience, if you're eating pretzel bread, it shouldn't be salted. The salt made it way too salty. Granted, it's probably a marketing ploy for the people who are eating it in the bars to get them to order more beer, but it was very disappointing for us.\\n\\nI also ordered the house made jerky because I love jerky.

The driver was very nice and took my coupon even though I hadn't mentioned it before placing the order. Bonus: they also deliver Ben + Jerry's ice cream.\\n\\nI can't imagine anyone would be ordering from this place looking for some kind of gourmet meal to pair with candlelight and a rare french wine. So that being said, expectations are in check. The menu covers a lot of territory--calzones, sicilian pizza, things made out of chicken. They even do catering and school lunches! But I was not aware that out there somewhere was a pizza that claimed to taste like a cheeseburger. And does exactly that. For that, and that alone, I will definitely be exploring more of what Pizza Days has to offer.\\n\\nBonus: the have lots of coupons and some pretty great deals.

The place is nice inside, plenty of tables, tvs, and a bar. Our food was finally ready and we drove back to our hotel less than a minute away to chow down.  The Quesadilla was cold- you would think it would be hot since we waited so long. The taste was mehhh.  The lobster roll was 2 scoops of lobster salad plopped on top of bread- not even in the bread. Again the flavor was lacking and I needed to add salt to it. I was also disappointed that they packed my sandwich, mashed potatoe, drippy coleslaw and a pickle all in one container for 2 reasons- I don't like my food touching and 2 the coleslaw was runny and got the bread soggy. It definitely should have been in a ramekin! Another disappointment was the potatoes- a generous portion but rather cold and after the 4th bite or so, I tasted bacon. Thankfully it's not an allergy or religious reason I requested no bacon but I've not had it in 25 years so it's kind of important to me!  \\n\\nPerhaps we should have just stuck to pizza... save your money and time and find another place to dine!!!"},{"name":"Truluck's","address":"10225 Research Blvd, Ste 4000","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"Yesterday, my boyfriend and I went out to celebrate our three year anniversary.

The bar area was a great atmosphere with live music and a great bartender, who helped us pick out a couple of specialty cocktails from the menu. After being seated at our table, our waiter Dillion quickly came over. He was great! He was extremely knowledgable about everything on the menu and was able to answer every question we had. I ordered the night's special which was a white fish on top of rice pilaf, topped with avocados, jalape√±os, cherry tomataos and a Thai fusion sauce. By far, the best fish entree I have ever consumed! My boyfriend ordered the blackened red fish entree, one of the signature entrees, and was blown away by how perfectly cooked and seasoned his fish was. As if that wasn't enough food for the two of us, we ordered a side of the crab fried rice, and I must say that it was well worth the $14! It was phenomenal! If you are going to order dessert, the carrot cake is a must! It is literally 1/4 of a round cake, covered with homemade cream cheese frosting, topped with hot Carmel sauce and spicy pecans... AMAZING! Besides Dillion never allowing our water glasses to go beyond 1/4 empty, the manager stopped by our table three times to ensure that every course of our meal was up to our satisfaction!

So the pizza and salad aren't bad, but the service is a bit of a disaster and its not really any one persons fault. It was a team effort. First it starts with taking your order at the front door instead of at the table. Why? No good reason other then to be modern or trendy. Just let me sit down and order directly to a waitress who puts your order in. We had six people and we all ordered lunch items.  We sit down. After a bit, 3 salads show up. Then another salad shows up 5 minutes later. Then another one shows up 3 minutes later. Finally the 6th salad (my salad) arrives 10 minutes later. During this time the waitress has dutifully sent me two re-fills of the homemade soda.  Just as I am beginning the salad, ironically, my pizza shows up first. Then again, the pizza's dribble out one at a time except for one pizza that doesn't come out, but instead another pizza comes out to make up for mine which they said was too small. (I thought it was a fine size). Finally, after 20 minutes of waiting the final pizza comes out to the last person just as everybody else has finished their pizza. \\n\\nOk! So this is where the stupid ordering at the front door doesn't work. If a group of people come to a restaurant and order food together, the food should come out together. Part of dining out is the enjoyment of eating with the people you are with. This is all part of the experience. Rize - let me help you. Let people sit down and take their order at the table.

I often frequent the pho places on 82nd, and thought I'd give this place a try since it's closer to home.  \\n\\nI was seated quickly, and service was prompt.  Menu is simple to read, and maybe a little limited.  I ordered a bowl of pho with well done briskets, and asked for more noodles and less meat.  Not sure if the meat in my bowl of pho was reduced but it was less meat than other restaurants so that was good.  However, my \\"more noodles\\" ended up being a side order of noodles sitting in a bowl without any broth.  What this meant was a wad of glued together noodle that I had to rip apart quickly and add it to my soup before it gels together.  I only added a little more and that was plenty of noodles.  Next time, I'm just going to leave well enough alone and just order a bowl without any changes.\\n\\nThe broth was sweet, and flavorful. I felt the anise taste was a bit strong but the sriracha I added helped out a lot.  The well done brisket was overly done and chewy.

Unfair, I know, since some restaurants don't have a pastry chef. But this is where I think if you only have a few basic offerings, they have to be exemplary.

My friend commented the crust had 'a fortune cookie-like' texture. \\n\\nService was friendly and attentive. She must have refilled our water 3 times and didn't rush us out, even though there were people waiting. The noise level goes up to a din as the restaurant fills up as it's a small space.

I didn't realize that around this time the menu options are reduced which was a little disappointing but the condensed menu still had some appetizing choices. (I checked the website before we headed to the restaurant to verify if dinner was still being served. There was nothing on the site that indicated that a condensed menu was used starting at 10pm.) I had the St. Johns River Catfish PoBoy and it was delicious. The fish was flakey, juicy, and had nicely seasoned breading. The mini tomatoes added a hint of sweetness to the sandwich. My favorite part of the dish was the side of homemade tartar sauce which was very flavorful and really made the whole dish come together. The only criticism of the sandwich was that the bread was a little too toasted and almost felt like eating a crouton. The side of fries were also good and topped with a Cajun-like seasoning. The beer menu features nine different in-house brewed options. I tried the Five Points IPA and the Working Man. Both beers were good but the Working Man was really unique since it is a lager brewed with coffee, vanilla, and maple. This beer had a light but very flavorful body. My girlfriend wanted to trade me her wine for this beer. I am anxious to visit this restaurant again during normal dinner hours and to try more of their beer options.

However, yesterday we had a terrible experience and I feel bad for even having to call them out because we really want to like this place. \\n\\nWe showed up yesterday around 6:30pm. We noticed there wasn't anyone to greet us or even a sign to let us know if we should just take a table, wait for a hostess, or whatever.  Think about a customer that's never been there.  Well it all went downhill from there. We decided to head out back and let the kids play while we sat at a table hoping someone that worked there would take an order, say hi, anything. I asked a gentleman that was fulfilling orders finally if he could get someone out there to take an order which he said sure. Unfortunately 30 mins later still no service at all. Not wanting to give up so easily we decided to head inside to maybe get some food going before the kids bedtime.\\n\\nGoing inside was no different. We went to a table and waited another 15 mins without any service at all. I asked the bartender if there was a waiter, she said yes there's 1 and she's really busy.  Again still wanting to give it a chance I agreed to order from the to go counter to get our order going.  I finally placed an order and went back to our table to hopefully get a drink order by the 1 waitress supposedly making the rounds.  But that didn't happen. 24 minutes later, and I only know this because the guy fulfilling orders corrected me after I checked on our order being almost 30 mins and still no food. Yes, he flippantly said that which was shocking in and of itself.  No customer service whatsoever. I understand that your management must have no clue how to properly staff the place but you certainly shouldn't express this frustration with customers or be rude to them. \\n\\nAfter about 35 mins, not sure if that is exact, I told the bartender to close our tab and that I didn't even want the food as it was nearing and hour and half since our arrival without a single ounce of food or service whatsoever. One of the only saving graces was they took care of the food for the gross mismanagement.  And the bartender seemed genuine in her discontent on our behalf. And here's the biggest problem, the food is great, except the buttery noodle excuse for Mac n Cheese.  But seriously the fried chicken was delicious and so were the greens.  The drinks from the bar were great!  So I hope they honestly take a look at their operation and fix the service aspect so they can thrive and get some good reviews.  We'll be back one more time and I hope they do. Until then, I warned you. Get your operation together!!"},{"name":"Tasty n Sons","address":"3808 N Williams Ave, Ste C, Hub Building","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"Just okay to me.

No carbs = No problem = order zucchini pasta instead.  Also on the lighter side get a salad and split one their tasty unique pizzas (my favorite is the Gorgonzola with caramelized onions and fig balsamic).

Beverly has a long Jazz History that Chianti continues from Sandy's.  The Belichick-esque musician himself owner tells me the musicians love the room, as I think they take less to play here.  I love it when they get funky and among my favorites are any band with Sax player Henley Douglas Junior including his band HDRnB and Krewe De Groove led by guitarist/vocalist Brandon Tarricone.  Both have spent a ton of time in New Orleans and it shows in their music and on stage energy! In these days with clubs closing like Johnny D's and Ryles, we are so lucky have the Chianti Jazz Lounge in Beverly!  Again, I should not be telling you this, but I want to see Chianti thrive and keep getting the phenomenal music!  After most shows, I actually pinch myself walking home to make sure I'm not dreaming as the music is that good.  The Cabot across the street is cool and it is so great for Beverly, but it is spendy, so go to Chianti to get as good or better music with a great meal for the same money!

Unfortunately we had to wait in front of the entrance for about 10 minutes for our table to be ready.

It was nothing to write home about...  I'm sure some of their other dishes are better, and I will probably go back again and give it another try but I won't be ordering anything with hashbrowns as I was more than disappointed when these came out seeming like they had been cooked over an hour prior and kept warm, they were crispy which I like, but stale like they'd been sitting around.  The biscuit on it's own had no flavor, no buttery flakiness like a good biscuit should have.  The gravy was bland at best and it too seemed like it had been sitting around for a while; ironically my meal came out very quickly, but looked like it had been prepared a while before I showed up and ordered it.  \\nThe waitress was friendly at first, but after I ordered she seemed to forget about me.  It's always off-putting when the check is dropped off seconds after your food hits the table too.

We knew it was a predetermined menu, and had a general idea of what we were getting. The staff had us all set up in the upper room of the restaurant. Now let me first begin by saying that this restaurant is GORGEOUS. The decor is warm and inviting but still upscale. It's great for a date night or friends dinner. \\n\\nThe chef came upstairs and introduced himself and explained how they like to use local produce, and all locally sourced ingredients for every dish they make. They also try to keep each dish with a minimal number of ingredients to acheive the taste, flavor and texture they are going for without overdoing it. To me this guy was a 5 star chef out the gates for knowing this. My grandfather was a master pastry chef and taught baking and pastry at Johnson and Wales Culinary Institute for many years so I grew up with a more vast knowledge of food and fine dining. I was super impressed with the chef, his knowledge and his approach and couldn't wait to get started! \\n\\nThey thoughtfully prepared a wine and cocktail menu that was also vegan, to accompany the meal. That too was thoughtfully planned. \\n\\nWhen our first bites arrived the flavors did NOT disappoint. From the first dish to th last it was abundantly clear that Quaintrelle was very serious about the quality, texture and taste of their foods. I am literally obsessed with texture. It can ruin a dish or dessert or make it stand out. Chef Wallender was not the typical chef, hidden away and arrogant in the kitchen. He checked on our group many times and went to each table to ask how everything was and how we were all enjoying his vegan menu. \\n\\nI was also impressed because though this is NOT a vegan establishment, Chef Wallender wanted to give the vegans there THE very best Cuisine and experience that he and his staff could provide. This meal and experience were worth every penny. I spoke to Chef Wallender after our meal to express our gratitude and appreciation of his food. He let us know to please come back and he can make delicious vegan food for us anytime. That's a real chef right there. This restaurant is 5 stars and an A list, top restaurant for a reason. So I can honestly say that may be our favorite \\"nonvegan\\" restaurant to go to for a special night out. Vegans, don't discriminate because they don't have an all vegan menu. Chef Wallender will cook you an unforgettable meal. I can't speak to their non vegan cuisine, but it has got to be top notch as well. \\n\\nAbsolutely loved this place.

This seemed odd since we were only a party of three.  The waiter disappeared after leaving the bill so I approached the \\"manager on duty\\" who informed me (after much discussion with others at the bar) that the \\"General Manager\\" decided to include the 18% gratuity for our table only.....confusing.

And I have to say that it deserves an upgrade. Yes, it is super busy, and it's rare to get seated immediately if you arrive after six pm. However, the wait times are always shorter than you're told, and you always have the option of eating at the bar if spots come available. The bar itself is a good spot to hang out to get a pretty good view of the local scene in all its glory, and their drinks are becoming more and more interesting. The daily specials are always fun to see- the drinks range from the very old-school to the super on-trend, and are always prepared with care. Once you do get seated, the efficiency of the operation continues, but always with a friendly attitude. The food is superb, and I mean that. I will admit that I haven't tried all the entrees, but having had a variety of the appetizers/small plates, sandwiches, salads, soups, and a couple mains (plus brunch), I feel like I can say that. The Monday night fried chicken special is something not to be missed, and whenever they have any small plates involving rock shrimp or lamb, I'm in. The food is contemporary Southern done well, but there's also a range beyond what you might expect. For example, the grilled baby artichokes appetizers is sublime, and one of the best artichoke dishes I've had. Coming from a girl who really likes artichokes, that's a strong recommendation. Their fried calamari come with a spicy twist, making them slightly unexpected. Price-wise,  you can't beat their sandwiches; the burger is enormous and very good for less than $10, and the blackened catfish poboy is my standby. Complete with serious spices, a crispy baguette, and really good fish, it's a delicious meal. Then I feel I must get to brunch. If you show up at opening, the line may in fact stretch down the block a bit, but don't be too intimidated. Despite its small size, Highland Kitchen can really pack them in (to the point that some of the tables are almost too close together...). But it's worth it for a wait, and if you come a little later, there's often room. They have the best shrimp and grits I've ever had (including many, many sojourns to the South) and the smoked fish hash is undeniably amazing. I have to say that all the brunch options I've tasted are delicious, just the right options for a good recovery brunch or just a really filling, relaxing meal. Plus, I must say, their brunch drinks are beyond the normal Bloody Mary/mimosa options, and in a very good way.\\nHighland Kitchen might not be the best place for a large group or to take your 'rents when they're in town, since it does get loud and the waiting is more difficult with a large group. But when you're looking for seriously good food and drink in a fun atmosphere, with all the hip kids of Somerville, it's the place to be. (Side note: I love that I routinely see staff from other favorite spots, like say The Independent, eating on their nights off at Highland Kitchen. That seems like a pretty good recommendation to me.)"},{"name":"Five Guys","address":"2606 Cedar Hills Blvd","city":"Beaverton","stars":"3.5","text":"Been a big fan for a long time of burgers, some of my favorites have to be Red Robin, Burger Master, In N Out, and Tommys.

The toast is just perfect.\\n\\nWould recommend the Knackwurst. It has a really interesting curry ketchup along with a topping of kraut. Not too much spice.

My mom wanted Italian so we got on Yelp & decided to give this place a try. We had reservations for 7:30 & we arrived a few minutes early and they sat us then. The restaurant is basically a hole in the wall ma and pop place. The parking lot outside is small & not very well marked but it wasn't difficult to find somewhere to park. For dinner we both started with a salad (della casa), which we both enjoyed. My mom ordered the filet and got a side of angel hair pasta with meat sauce. The pasta came as a side with the filet. she enjoyed the filet and said it was cooked well and the sauce it was in was good. i was stuck between the gnocchi and the seafood ravioli special they had that night. the waiter told me they offered half portions & i could do both for the price of one full pasta dish. so i elected to go with that. both were good, but i really liked the seafood ravioli. my mom then joked and said when you go to an Italian restaurant you cannot not get dessert. Italians know how to do dessert. Nino's has a huge dessert tray. There was flourless chocolate cake, coconut cake, tiramisu, a cheesecake, gelato & a few others i am forgetting. My mom loves tiramisu so i knew that's what she was getting. i decided to get the cheesecake. both were great choices. it was also just the right serving size - not like some restaurants who give you enormous portion sizes you'll never finish. since we were so full by the time we got to dessert we ate some at the restaurant and then took the rest togo. i am not a huge Italian person but i would recommend this restaurant and would return. i knew my mom wanted Italian so i said okay, but i actually really enjoyed Nino's."},{"name":"Winsor Dim Sum Caf√©","address":"10 Tyler St","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"Came for Dim Sum...

First, our waiter was new he didn't know about a drink understandable but, when asked about what comes on a food item that was on the happy hour menu but not in regular he could not tell me.

My friend order quesadilla I ordered a burrito, her food was nice n hot I cut in to my burrito soon as I touched it it was cold. I went to take a bite thinking maybe just the tortilla wasn't warmed enough nope i was wrong the whole inside was cold, beans were suppose to be refried beans and that was not even close to refried. After, bout 10 mins of waiting for the waiter to come see if everything was good I finally just asked someone to grab him so the manager came to the table asked what the problem asked if he could replace it I denied the replacement just didn't want to wait another 20 mins. Manager also offered us free drinks we just said ok, we never got those drinks. My friend asked for napkins we the food first came to the table the napkins never showed. We asked if we can get a booth when the sat us they said booths are usually for parties of 4 but 5 mins after us they sat 2 people there and they got everything they ordered before we did but, I blame that on the waiter for not attending to us properly. The table across from us were there about 10 mins after us also, asked for a manager because there food came out but the had nothing to eat with, they hadn't got the sides they ordered and by the look on the ladies face the manager wasn't polite.

Wow, I am soooo glad I chose this place for my celebration.   Plus, I love tapas!!  Very hip place with good music and cool vibe.  They were super packed with reservations so we decided to sit in the cozy stools at the bar.  Glad we did.  Talked with the bartender, Rebecca, and she made us some delicious cocktails.  My boyfriend had some drink with jalape√±o vodka in it, and I had a ginger and white cranberry martini with some lime vodka.  Both were terrific.   Next to the food.  We started with the NY cheddar biscuits, which came in a small cast iron pan.  They were pretty good, but a little dry.  Of course, they were biscuits so I shouldn't be too picky on that.  Next we had some smoked salmon, which was amazing.  It had dill, capers, little pickles, and some kind of Greek yogurt.  The flavors exploded in my mouth.  We also had the piquillo peppers filled with ch√®vre and laid over some sweet honey.  The pairing was perfect.  Couldn't stop there.  Next we tried the salmon poke tacos.  Amazing!!!  The delicate flavor with the sesame aioli and the lightly fried very thin shell with the salmon topped with roe was just genius.  Not to be outdone, the pan seared scallops came next, and they were also incredible.  They were cooked to perfection and served in a bed of lentil pur√©e.  Though I was stuffed, I had to try the brussel sprouts, which went from \\"I want to throw up\\" as a child to \\"love me some sprouts!\\".  These brussel sprouts were amazingly delicious.  They had the charred crispy edges around them, and the soft but not too soft inside.  Beautifully seasoned. Can't stop there.  We ordered the grilled octopus which comes served in a bed of arugula, one of my favorite greens due to the peppery taste, and tiny roasted potatoes, red onion, and cilantro.  Had to squeeze in room for dessert.  Here comes the major letdown.  We ordered the PB and J mousse and the s'mores bread pudding.  The PB and J was terrible.  I couldn't eat more than one bite.  The bread pudding was just okay.  It certainly didn't pair well with the food experience here.  So next time, I would not get dessert and just eat more tapas.

When there are places like Life Alive down the street which serve hearty, healthy, more tasty bowls for half the price ... They need to step this up.  \\nOur oysters were delicious- that was the highlight. \\nWhen the bill came the food was taken off so we only paid for drinks.  This was very much appreciated.

The restaurant was empty because it just opened therefore my motto is, if it don't feel right, just go.\\n\\n2nd occasion, March 22nd, 2017.  We went after shopping and the wait was not long, maybe 15mins;  It was me, my son and girlfriend.  My Waiter-Marcus came and we ordered our drinks, food, and appetizer.  Everything rolling along fine until we placed our order.  Appetizer came out within 15mins, after that radio silence. My girlfriend ordered the turkey burger, I ordered the Gumbo, and my son order the Filet Mignon, therefore we were spending a good amount of money w/ drinks.  After 25-30 mins, we looking around like where is the food; Marcus comes by and says nonchalantly let me check on your food.  About 5 mins later (30-35 total),  turkey burger came and Gumbo. I ordered my gumbo w/ white rice which sits in the middle of the bowl, this one had brown rice. I told the server I order Gumbo w/ white rice. The server said here I will bring you out some white rice, I said no take this back, that is not what I ordered. He stated it only sits in the middle.  I am like, did he just try and give me a different version of what I order and wanted me to make the adjustments on the plate that I am paying for.  I told him to take the plate back and bring it out correctly.  During this point our server Marcus is no-where to be found in response to the mishap.  And notice, I did not mention my sons plate, because he hasn't received it.  So now, here comes my corrected Gumbo w/ white rice, no apology or anything.  Also here comes the Filet Mignon w/ mashed potatoes and green beans. My son ordered a Filet Mignon w/ French fries and broccoli. We look at the plate and say, are you serious?  Mind you that's a $30 dollar dish, at this point Marcus appears and I inform him, this is not what we ordered, His response, \\" I'll bring him out some fries and broccoli\\" (i.e No accountability or apology).  He brings out a bowl of broccoli and unseasoned fries, and says my bad to my son.  At this point, Marcus isn't even worth eye contact because I'm upset.\\nI am the type of person that if good service and quality food is provided, I will forever patron your restaurant.  Because, I can count on feeling good about the entire experience.  I don't know why the service was so horrible nor do I care because I am the customer and Marcus was the face of Cheesecake at that point.  You had 3 orders, got 1 right and 2 wrong, that's 33.3%; that's below failing.  I hate when people do not tip and give good service a hard time, but on occasions like these, I see no reason for anyone to hold back if they want that type of confrontation.  Me, I am a little more reserved and better voicing my opinion in other ways, such as this.  \\nFinally when the check comes, there isn't an apology or nothing.  I am like this is ridiculous.  I expect more from a location such as yours and its disheartening knowing people aren't treated with the type of service they are paying for, And the only reason Marcus got a tip which was 14.00 dollars on a 100.00 tab is because we chose to come and eat there.  But, let that had been no tip, the only comment would have been, black people don't tip, even though the service you provided was awful; between you and the kitchen staff.   I am not a waiter but if I was, my main goal would be to provide the type of service that you cant deny giving me an exceptional tip no matter what is going on in my life, that is blocked out because I am working.\\nI am very disappoint in Cheesecake Perimeter."},{"name":"Moondogs","address":"3179 Peachtree Rd NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3.5","text":"Wednesday's night are mostly kids (under age) with a fake.

Thanks to Jaime and him giving us a chance to try chevys again we decided to go again. We came here for a later lunch, at first it started off quite the same longer wait greet time. But once Jeffery came over with his bright smile and great personality he was very enthusiastic and felt very genuine, our whole experience turned around quite quickly. He was great apologized for that long greet time and was able to take our whole order since we were ready and took his time which showed he was knowledgeable about the menu, and even was able to back up what we wanted which felt very good. As everything came out it was delicious, their tortilla soup is incredible I love the avocado and the spice it has the perfect amount. We got the fajitas again, idk we just love fajitas haha, but it was still very good; I don't really care for the carnitas but that is just my taste buds but the shrimp and steak combo is awesome definitely give it a try. Their watermelon margarita is good as well just very sweet and would suggest it after dinner, so get the bull dog margarita for dinner and finish over the experience with the watermelon! Haha Unfortunately we were definitely too full to get a dessert, but wish we could get that chocolate brownie/cake whatever it is I saw a picture of that looks awesome.

The sauce was fresh, light, and plentiful enough to set the tone for flavor.  Every one of the ingredients seemed to be of high quality, and well balanced with each other.  The crust was not the ultra thin, crispy, slightly charred one that you'll find with the wood-fired experience, but it was flavorful, with just the right amount of chewiness for my preferences.

I am now intensely envious that this place is in College Park.\\n\\nThe pub is housed in a really lovely converted Tudor house with a large patio nestled between a wooded area, a church and a residential neighborhood on Virginia Avenue. The atmosphere is as charming as the architechture (which includes a stunning arch-shaped entry door). I walked in to find a small bar, cozy tables and friendly, laid-back, attentive staff.\\n\\nWe were seated in the upstairs space which has exposed beams, but, somehow, feels cozy and not at all echoey. We ordered beers which came quickly (impressive considering how many times the poor server had to climb the stairs!), and then ordered fish and chips and the steak-and-Guinness pie. Our dishes arrived quickly, and they were hot and delicious. The fish was crisp on the outside with just the right proportion of breading to cod and not too greasy. The chips (i.e. fries) were also crisp on the outside, but soft and steamy on the inside. The fish needed a little salt for our taste, but it was perfect with a drizzle of malt vinegar. I haven't had fish and chips like this since I was in London.\\n\\nI didn't try the steak-and-Guinness pie, but it looked and smelled amazing, and my companion's plate was nearly licked clean, so I think it was also excellent. \\n\\nWe then ordered the bread pudding and the Guinness brownie, the two desserts our server reported are prepared on-premises. The bread pudding was decent. The Guinness brownie was transcendent. Soft, chocolatey, not-too-sweet. I'm not a sweets person, but this brownie is everything that a brownie should be and more. The kind of brownie that two bites is enough to satisfy because it's so rich and gooey and perfect. *drool*\\n\\nOur server happily split our checks, and the meal was more than reasonably priced for the excellent service, the homey atmosphere and the high-quality food.

Especially, as this waiter is not new (he waited on me 6 weeks ago).  Further, when I asked for a wine list, I was told that their wine offering that evening was short.  I asked what whites they had and was told Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio and Riesling.  Vintner and label matters to me, I expected a more knowledgable presentation of the limited selection.  After all, this is Buckhead and a restaurant where wine is $8+ a glass, appetizers and salads range from $8-13 and entrees are $24+.

I had been interested in going to the Beat Hotel for a while, so because the restaurant  was participating in Boston's Restaurant week I thought it would be a good time to go and get a nice sample of their menu. \\n\\nWhen we arrived they made no mention of Restaurant week and had no set 3 course menu for the advertised $33 (on Boston Restaurant Week webpage). When we asked the waitress if the restaurant was indeed participating she explained that they do not do anything special but the menu items highlighted in red would get you to the price. This still confuses me because it was supposed to be 3 courses for $33 but my appetizer and main equaled that and our bill still seemed like $30 more expensive than it should of been. Okay, well not what I expected. What they had was just lame, french onion soup, house salad, side salad. I ordered a side salad. What came out was just wrong. It was romaine lettuce with a few tomatoes and sliced radishes and what tasted like Kraft Italian dressing. I should mention that earlier that same day I had gone to Grafton Street  in Cambridge and had an awesome side salad that featured micro greens, blue cheese crumbles, a sliced pear and a delicious vinaigrette, for $1 less I might add. As for our main course options, all lame again, a uninspiring pork chop, mussel frittes and a basic no meat added Inca or Earth bowl.  I settled for the Mussels and Frites. The fries were great, they were seriously over salted but as a person who can deal with too much salt on her fries I forgive it. The mussels were okay, I could not figure out how I felt about the broth they were in. I ended up leaving a lot of mussels in the bowl, which is not something I would normally do. Dessert was god awful. I had their deconstructed cannoli. Gross, no other word, just nasty. My boyfriend ordered the chocolate cheesecake, which was okay, it tasted great compared to my cannoli but  nothing special.

More waiting. A server came by and said \\"has anyone let you know it will be a minute?\\"\\n\\n\\"No,\\" we said. \\"No one had told us anything. Or addressed us at all.\\"\\n\\nShe said, \\"Oh, well, it will be a minute, we don't have any open tables.\\" She walked away as we glanced at the two open tables about ten feet away and just shrugged. \\n\\nThat should have been our second sign.\\n\\nSo we got to our table, got our drinks after a minute and ordered. There wasn't too much that happened next. Why? Because nothing happened next. We sat for literally an hour in our booth waiting for food. I know I'm not exaggerating because the server came over and apologized, because she was keeping track of when we ordered, and admitted we had been waiting an hour. We did get complimentary pancake ball things (as did many other tables, because it seemed the kitchen couldn't get anything out), but a ball of fried pancake batter didn't exactly make up for the half hour of waiting before it or the half hour of waiting after it. \\n\\nWe sat as other tables walked out or threatened to walk out. Those who threatened to leave got their food. We sat as other tables who arrived after us received their food. We sat without once being addressed by a manager, who we didn't see until the very end of the meal because we specifically asked for her. We sat as two other tables left, and told us how bad they felt for us, and joked about cooking our meal themselves. \\n\\nWe did however have a nice server who kept our drinks full and apologized. She thanked us for being patient; luckily we're all good friends so we were able to chat our way through it. Not her fault; she could only do so much with the most dysfunctional kitchen my friends and I have ever experienced. \\n\\nOnce the food finally arrived, it wasn't entirely ready, our sever had to make a few trips.

All the utensils, pots and pans look fresh from the restaurant supply store. This is a well scrubbed, spanking new place with a budget i'm guessing most restaurant owners would die for in this economy. \\n\\nOkay, enough prelude, here's the food: baby octopus skewers (nice, spicy and tangy); kopitiam toast (twith an extraordinary egg/coconut jam -- my favorite bite of the night); Vietnamese short ribs (flavorful, fatty and what you'd expect); and naam phrik kha (steamed Oyster mushrooms with a chile paste --interesting, but I probably wouldn't order again). For dessert I had the duck egg in a sweet milk broth and a cup of kafae boraan, a chinese coffee drink sweetened with condensed milk.

Funny enough, most of the aforementioned dishes from fellow Yelpers are off the specials list and we began with half orders of the Shrimp Limoncello and Wild Mushroom Ravioli.  The former turned out to be the one small miss of the meal as the sauce was bland and the three shrimp were far overdone.  For a moment, they tasted as if they'd been sitting around for a while, but the chef's passion for food seems far too strong to let such a thing happen so he has the benefit of the doubt here.  The ravioli was very tasty though - firm, al dente casings opening up to fresh, earthy flavors within.\\n\\nOn mains, we trusted good ol' Guy to lead us in the right direction so we opted for the Lobster Ravioli and Rino's Special.  Before I get to the crustacean'ed pasta dish, I'll say that the special was most delicious.  Classic Italian flavors characterized by EVOO and a healthy dose of cream and butter.  All the meats were very tender (you almost don't even need a knife), the wild mushrooms were fantastic and the homemade pappardelle had excellent texture.\\n\\nNow the lobster ravioli...this is seriously a one-of-a-kind dish.  $25 for the most hugemongous ravioli you'll ever encounter stuffed full of and surrounded in sauce by every last ounce of flesh (literally) squeezed out of a 1.25-1.5 lb lobster!  It goes without saying that the quality:cost is through the roof and reaching for the stars.  It's also more than enough for two meals unless you've been starving yourself all day in preparation ;)\\n\\nDesserts came in the form of Tiramisu and Coppa Spagnola, both pretty good though complete afterthoughts compared to the apps and mains.\\n\\nIn terms of logistics, one just needs to plan accordingly and be aware that Rino's works similarly to comparable Italian hotspots like Giacomo's and Neptune Oyster.  We were seated within 10 min around 5 pm on a Tuesday night and things were still totally manageable (ie. no crazy lines out the door, etc.) by the time we left around 7 pm.  If you must come during prime hours, do your research and have a plan so you won't have to whine about 2-3 hour waits.  I'll also add that the staff is great and comes without the brashness often seen at places in the North End.\\n\\nAfter all is said and done, Rino's is def a must-visit and pretty easy to get to being just a short walk from the Blue line.

It has been years since I've eaten at Holy Taco despite having lived on the East Side for a while now. From memory I didn't like the food but my colleague suggested it and I was starving so I didn't put up a fight.\\n\\nSat at the bar. Dude behind the bar was kool and seemed really genuine in the interaction with his customers. Appreciated that. Went ahead and ordered 2 shrimp tacos and the corn on the cob (which they actually offer to cut off the cob for you...yes please!). \\n\\nThe shrimp tacos come with pico de gallo, cilantro and queso fresco and you can get flour or corn tortilla...I opted for the flour. The shrimp had really nice grill marks and was cooked just right. The tortilla surprised me. Alot of times when you get flour you get what looks like a store bought packaged tortilla. But this almost had the texture and look of a genuine corn tortilla BUT of course tasted like flour. Really really enjoyed this. The pico, cilantro and queso fresco were really fresh tasting and go really well together. My only complaint was the temperature. I would have liked the shrimp (and the taco overall) to be a little warmer. However, if somehow this would kill the combo of flavors then by all means don't change a thing. The street style corn on the cob comes topped with spiced mayo, queso fresco and what looked like chili flakes. The flavor was pretty delish with the chili flakes giving it a nice kick. However, YOU HAVE to spray some of the lime wedge (that accompanies it) on it...brought it to a whole new place. I would have also like this dish to be a little warmer. Perhaps the cold factor on the things that top the corn make it impossible for the corn to stay warm...who knows.\\n\\nThe portions are extremely big. I could have eaten three tacos easy. But for EAV everything is pretty reasonably priced. The tacos were $3.75 each and the side of corn was $3. Quite respectable. Total before tip a lil over $12.

Honestly, I didn't come here because I had the craving for veggies, I came here looking for something new and slightly out of my comfort zone.  The decor is very nice: the kitchen is open, the lights illuminating each tabletop, and the ambience is lively.  The table design and flowers on the tables are nice to the eyes, and you really feel like you're sitting at your dream home.\\n\\nI got the Thai Cashew Quinoa with Steak while she got the Late Riser with Salmon.  The vegetables are stir-fried, so even though I'm not a fan of zucchini, I totally dig the tenderness it had from the high heat.  Everything tasted good and the bowl was licked clean.  The steak is cooked medium, but the color and tenderness satisfied my preference for medium-rare.  My one complaint is that once I got through half the bowl, the sauce will get a tad heavy, and the quinoa does little to absorb the saltiness.  I also had a bite of the Late Riser.  It was also pretty good, but the salmon could've been a bit more tender.\\n\\nSadly, you do have a spend a bit extra for healthier food, but when you're in the Domain, Flower Child is hard to pass up, especially with the quality of their ingredients.

Being the Chinese New Year weekend probably didn't help too much.

This price doesn't include the soup base, so be prepared to spend a few bucks more.  With that said, this place has some of the tastiest bases I have had in any hot pot restaurant.  The satay was very flavourful, and the spicy chili one (see pics) really is something special.  You'd think the soup would be one giant burning sensation, but they balance the flavours out with lots of peppercorns and other herbs and spices.\\n\\nAs for the food? The variety is excellent, and the high turnover here ensures that the ingredients are fresh.  The pork neck is very tender, and the other seafood is quite fresh.  Fresh oysters are capped at 2 per person.\\n\\nAnother thing worth mentioning is their plum juice, is some of the best I've had anywhere.  Maybe it's actually because it's diluted or there's a bit more sugar, but this is one of the few places where I liked it enough to drink my entire glass.

We came here for dinner a couple months ago after reading good reviews, but we were left standing there just inside the door for almost 10 minutes, and the wait staff just kept walking past us, didn't even acknowledge us and the restaurant was practically empty! We just left that night and went to Genji down the street. \\n\\nSo this time, it was August long weekend and we were planning to go to Genji but it was closed so we decided to try and get takeout from Momiji. We weren't planning on trying the sit down dining experience as customer service seemed off to us. We were greeted by a middle aged woman and she seemed nice enough, and I told her we wanted to get takeout and took a few minutes to look over the menu. After we were ready, we waited about a good 5 minutes before anyone came out. The same lady could see us standing there ready to order but she was busy asking coworkers questions and scooping bowls of miso soup for other patrons. It was fine that she attended to them first, but couldn't she have acknowledged us and let us know she'll be right with us? Anyway, a younger girl came and took our order. As we were giving her our order, the older woman came and stood right between us and kept asking her questions. I thought it was kind of rude since I was interrupted a few times by her questions. Needless to say, when the younger girl read back my order she had missed a sushi roll because she was distracted. \\n\\nOur food was ready in 20 minutes, and it was the saving grace. Now, don't get me wrong, I'm definitely NOT a fan of the prices. It's more expensive than a lot of other places. I ordered 4 chopped scallop nigiri's and they were $2.95 each. EACH!! I'm perfectly happy with sushi garden/sushi nanaimo nigiri's for $1.30 but I'll order this at other places and pay the $2, but $2.95? That's almost the price of a roll at other restaurants. As for the taste, yes it tasted good. The pieces were nicely chopped and tossed with a good amount of tobiko and mayo, but man, I don't think they were worth the $2.95 price tag. We also had an order of tuna roll and negitoro roll, and they were pretty good as well. The seafood all seemed pretty fresh. My boyfriend also wanted to try out their yakisoba, and he liked it. The beef pieces were sliced really thin and the flavour was good. \\n\\nOverall, we can only justify the prices if we get take-out and not pay the tip, IF that at all. Our order of 2 small rolls, 4 nigiri pieces and a noodle dish came to just over $30! We've had the same good quality food at other restaurants for $10 less. Would we come back?

Royal's beef is similar to Kelly's, in my opinion. It is cooked a little more on the medium side and sliced a little thicker. Not a bad thing, by any means. You HAVE to get the super when you go here because it is served on a delicious onion roll. They get a bonus point for that - none of the other spots on my roast beef tour offer the onion roll (yet, at least).\\n\\nWe always get a small side of fries.

One has been great, several mixed, and now, most recently it was ridiculously poor.  The worst service I have experienced in any restaurant  in Portland and with no acknowledgment of their error.  Initially, we were seated and ignored for a solid 8+ minutes.  Finally we waved down the hostess to ask if we had a server, and she took it upon herself to take our initial drink order.  When the drinks came, we still had no server, so she took our food order as well.  We waited for our food, ordered a glass of wine to go with the appetizers in expectance.  Wine never came.   First two courses came out, a very mediocre arugula salad and a simple and good fish plate. When asked a second time if I needed a second drink I explained my wine was forgotten about and now that the fish was done, I'd prefer red to go with the steak.  No dedicated server still.  Steak came out rare (not medium rare, when I asked for it to be cooked more, the waiter stated \\"well this is med. rare.  how do you want it? medium well?  medium?\\"  Taking him for his word I ordered it medium, only to have it served on the well side of medium (I'm fine with their medium rare being on the rare side, but this should then mean medium is also served on the medium rare side not the opposite)  Shouldn't there be something in between almost bloody and barely pink?  And for the waiter to accuse us of ordering the steak wrong??  What happened to the customer is always right?  Throughout our wait for the recooked steak we ordered a second glass of wine that didn't come out until after we had almost finished with the steak.    \\nAll this, with gangster rap playing (apparently this is their soundtrack as the past three times I've been, this is all that has been played).  This used to be one of my favorite places.  No longer.  I'll be hesitant to ever go back.\\nThere was never an apology for forgetting our wine....twice....never an apology for the undercooked steak, or for the fact that we sat for almost ten minutes before we were helped.  I realize that things happen in the restaurant business, that people don't show up or call in sick, that sometimes they can be understaffed and the confusion we experienced is not the direct fault of the server that you may have that night.  But something was definitely wrong with this place, and nothing was done to try to ameliorate the problem.  And in the end, the food was simply average."},{"name":"Namaste Indian Cuisine","address":"1403 NE Weidler St","city":"Portland","stars":"3","text":"Omg this place is great for the price the food is terrific ugh wish I found this place earlier."},{"name":"The Cheesecake Factory","address":"4400 Ashford-Dunwoody Rd, Ste 3005","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3","text":"One of my favorite stops.

Appetizers both times were delightful (hummus, mussels, empanadas).  I like the vibe of the place, and the staff have always been friendly and kind.  Some good choices on their wine menu, but only a couple are available by the glass.  Beer menu could use some better options (like Orval, Dupont, Nogne), but they're certainly trying more than most (Houblon Chouffe was on tap here last time).  Mostly worth the price, but it may depend on when you go (as with any place)."},{"name":"Tasty n Sons","address":"3808 N Williams Ave, Ste C, Hub Building","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"Delicious!

Well after an hour of searching we came across Ava in Cohasset. When we entered there were a few empty tables that the waitress/owner told us were reserved for people who know enough not to go out on a Saturday night in August without a reservation. But she did offer us a seat at the bar or one of the remaining high backed chairs adjacent to the bar which we gladly accepted. We were greeted by the owners daughter who was also waitressing and efficiently asked for our drink orders and recited an impressive specials menu. After we ordered both our drinks and menu items the owner came by with sun glasses for me to wear because the sun from the west side of the building, which of course I was facing , was blinding. Very much appreciated. The meal itself, while filling , was not what you would find in an Italian restaurant in the city or even at a place like Orta, in Pembroke but again, filling and nice. One thing to be mindful of is when ordering a bottle of wine, which I frequently do especially if it is a bottle that I can't normally find in a retail establishment, I will often have a glass with my meal and bring the rest home to have at another meal later in the week end. I was told by our waitress that they do not carry the speciality packaging that the state requires when bottles are recapped for transport.  So,I was left either to drink the entire bottle, within 30 minutes because the concert was starting in that time or leave a $30 bottle of wine on the table, not a great choice ether way. Our waitress did come back and apologize for not telling me that when I ordered the wine and offered to charge me for just the one glass I consumed. All in all, we had a nice meal, didn't spend a lot of money after all and were able to see a great Vince Gill concert!"},{"name":"Highland Kitchen","address":"150 Highland Ave","city":"Somerville","stars":"4","text":"Great Food and a nice drink selection... only downside is it gets quite busy on most nights."},{"name":"Flower Child","address":"11721 Rock Rose Ave, Ste 120","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"The atmosphere is very relaxing and cozy.

It is directly connected to an Amy's Ice Cream store and has a huge playground in the back. Interior is kinda old fashion and country, got picnic tables and lots of wooden paneling and warm colored painted walls. The menu board is painted onto the back wall with is kinda cool.  When i got there this place was balling out of control, lots of guests and surprising to me, was there was a ton of kids.  Very kid friendly joint.\\n\\nMenu - This is a burger joint thru and thru so it has the main staples of burgers, cheeseburgers, chicken burgers and so on. One of their signature things is that your order comes with half sweet potato fries and half normal fries. Nice touch to add a little extra variety to the standard burger and fries. They have several beers on tap and a selection of other beers as well.  Makes for an awesome place for families and let parents have some fun too.  The burgers are all named after Austin neighborhoods, districts or zip codes. They do have a couple different kinds of buns like sourdough and some kind of jalapeno bun. Most the burgers have the normal toppings to be expected but they do have variations like a BBQ burger, mushroom melt and even a breakfast burger. Nice variety of burgers, non-burgers and alcohol.\\n\\nService - Got in during the lunch rush but was the first in line.  Lady at the register was pleasant, told me to take my time since the menu is vast and to let her know when i was ready. The man behind the counter that was expo'ing was really friendly as well.  Gotta kinda be when you have to call out each order by name over the mic. LOL. I observed the crew make their rounds thru the dining room cleaning and whatnot so that is a good sign. The service was right at good.  \\n\\nFood - I got the Brentwood burger which is basically a bacon chesseburger with the normal fixin's. (Lettuce, tomato, onions, pickles, mayo and mustard) I got my tray of food and the burger looks really big but the bun they use is actually the biggest part, it is a big top and bottom bun.  I could barely see if there was anything in it when i got it. The mix of fries was a nice touch and i totally enjoyed being able to have both.  The fries were 85% good.  I say that because 85% of them were hot and fresh and seasoned lightly. The rest were super old and cold fries. No biggie really since it was the rush and i got a few that have been chilling under the heat lamp getting a tan. Fries were good, so now for the burger. I take my first bite and all i really get is bread and some of the add ons. One in particular was a pickle. After a few more bites i realize this burger was not assembled well. Bout halfway thru all i had was a top bun because all the insides started to move. Thats ok because the bun was very dominating, it took away to much of the other ingredients. So the last half of my burger i was finally able to start tasting everything else.  The beef had a nice flavor very moist an hot and lots of juicy dead cowness. The meat itself was great but with all the bread i could barely taste it for the entirety of my meal. So my burger for me was ok.  The reason is each bite there were only 3 main items i tasted the entire time that dominated the rest of the flavors.  With all the bites i took all i could taste was bread, pickle and mustard. I dont know if that is due to maybe my burger was made wrong, assembled wrong or someone got heavy handed with the mustard and pickle. The main downfall, for me at least, is there was so much bread.  The bread was actually really tasting, kind of a sweet and buttery bun, but that shouldnt be the star. The bun was just too large for the meat to bun to condiment ratio. So the bun either needs to be smaller or the patty bigger..or both.  But that is just my opinion. But my opinion is about as useful as Rosie O'donnell's personal trainer. \\n\\nOverall - The food for me was a 3 star but i gave a 4 star because of what this place is. The amount of business men, families and other guests was outstanding. The concept here of a truly family restaurant is very prominent. This place was packed with kids on a Thursday afternoon, like McDonalds doesnt even have that.....but thats probably because...well... its McDonalds. Point being is that the whole vibe here and what they are striving for is wonderful. I know they are doing something right because this place was packed to the brim. I had to sit next to strangers, do you know how many years of being told not to go near strangers, just to have to go to strangers. LOL, i kid....but seriously. Plus there may be a better burger suited to my likes.  There were several other kinds of buns and burgers to choose from. I am definitely looking forward to trying them again, because aside from the dominatrix I call bread, the beef was really good and thats who should be the focus of the burger with the rest to compliment the dead cow goodness"},{"name":"Francescos Ristorante Italia","address":"860 Burrard Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"3.5","text":"I went for a business lunch and we were there for almost three hours.

The only reservation I made in advance was for Beast. I wanted to eat at the best place in Portland, and according to Yelp, Beast is it.\\n\\nWe took the bus from Downtown and arrived too early. In the rain. We stood outside for a little while, peeking in the window to watch the prep, then walked back down the street and found shelter in a nearby coffee shop called Extracto. As it got closer to our reservation, we walked back to the restaurant and waited. Eventually another party showed up, and another, until finally a server opened the door and let us in. He told us to wait there, in the corner, as they were not ready to seat us yet.\\n\\nA while passed until another server came out with a reservation book and asked who was there first. We were! She sat us in the middle of the long table, facing the kitchen. Sweet view!\\n\\nMost people were on time, but some were not. It's really not cool to be late for reservations here since they try to feed everyone at once. Being late means making everyone else in the restaurant wait.\\n\\nThe menu for Saturday, November 6th, 2010 was:\\n\\n1. Andaluz & Gypsy Pepper Soup with Almond, Lemon, & Parsley Pistou\\n\\n2. Foie-gras Bon-Bon, Sauternes Gele√©; Steak Tartare on Quail Egg Toast; Chicken Liver Mouse, Pickled Shallot; Locally Made Olympic Provisions Salami; Pork, Pork Liver and Cracked Peppercorn Pate\\n\\n3. Cattail Creak Lamb Loin Chop with Butternut Squash, Cippolini Onion, & Kale Gratin, Candied Hazelnut Salsa Verde & Lamb Demi-Glace\\n\\n4. Arugula & Persimmon Salad, Tomme Du Fedou Sheeps-Milk Cheese, Crispy Leeks & Aged Sherry Vinaigrette\\n\\n5. Cheese From Steve at Cheese Bar, Bittersweet Farms Honey, Cracked Black Pepper & Fleur de sel Shortbread, Red Wine Poached Pear, Candied Local Walnuts\\n\\n6. Br√ªl√©ed Apricot & Vanilla Custard Tart\\n\\nEverything surpassed my expectations, from the olive oil-based pepper soup (which tasted so rich I thought it had to have cream in it), to the charcuterie plate of deliciousness, to the lamb, to the salad, to the cheese and that incredible honey, to the dessert. 5+ stars for all the deliciousness and amazement.\\n\\nThe things that I didn't like were:\\nA. The chairs. If you're going to have these long meals (ours took 2+ hours), please have comfortable chairs. The seat was small and the back was uncomfortable.\\nB. The chefs were about 8 feet from my face, yet they seemed to refuse to interact with their diners. Why the open kitchen?\\nC. The attitude upon arrival. I understand you have to prep and you only have so much space, but did you really have to pretend you didn't see us waiting in the rain? And how about when you finally let us in... Why seem put out that we're there early? We're sorry we're so polite and responsible.\\n\\nSo I loved the food and I would definitely recommend others try it at least once, but I don't know if I'll wait to go out of my way again and be uncomfortable for really fantastic food."},{"name":"Cask & Larder","address":"565 W Fairbanks Ave","city":"Winter Park","stars":"4","text":"Excellent, smaller restaurant in Winter Park.

Everyone who has gone before us were raving about Salsa and Agave so we had to try it. Plus I was craving my mexican so I was excited to hear about a good place nearby.\\n\\nWhen we got there, the place was packed. We were lucky to secure a table within minutes. The host and the waitress were friendly and very accommodating. We were served chips and salsa right away. As much as I wish it was pico de gallo, it wasn't. It was just some kind of salsa sauce. But it was decent.\\n\\nFrom the selection they had, I couldn't make up my mind. I finally decided on the shrimp burrito and something additional: chicken and soft pork tacos. Around the table, someone ordered the gringa (flour tortilla w/melted cheese and pastor, or their version of pork in red spice sauce) chicken and chorizo tacos, and vegetarian sopes (thick handmade corn tortillas w/ beans, lettuce, sour cream, cheese and avocado sauce).\\n\\nWhen our food arrived, I was happy to see it was presented nicely. My shrimp burrito's tortilla was toasted, which I wasn't expecting. I quite liked it; it added a nice crunch to my burrito. The rice was filling and the shrimp was juicy; I really like how there were a lot of shrimp in my burrito. The only thing I wish my burrito had was more components instead of just rice and shrimp, because that's all that stood out to me. The sour cream and avocado sauce (not guacamole as it didn't really have the same consistency) were good. It complemented the dish well. My tacos were not on par with the burrito. The chicken was dry and the lime was so hard to squeeze with virtually no juice coming out. The pork tacos however, were fantastic. It was juicy and tender. The tacos were served with the salsa sauce and the avocado sauce. \\n\\nAccording to my friends, the sopes were \\"interesting\\". The mushrooms and the pepper were tender and the onions added flavour. It was also nicely presented.  The gringa was really filling (my buddy almost didn't finish his because of the huge portion). It was \\"nothing extraordinary, but it was still good\\". He said  the chicken taco was really dry and the chorizo wasn't as tasty as he had hoped it would be. He also had an issue with his lime wedge; it was as hard as a rock and couldn't squeeze any lime juice out. \\n\\nI would've liked to have given this place 4 stars but dining in a restaurant isn't all about the food; it's about the complete experience. The service, the atmosphere, and even the bathroom. Well there was no bathroom, but that wasn't a big deal. What annoyed me was the fact that the waitress wanted to put the tip in herself, and she tipped after tax. I'm not being a cheap-o, but I'M the one tipping her for her service; it should be MY decision how much I'm tipping, not hers. Really annoyed me. Because of that, I'm knocking them 1 whole star rating down.\\n\\nWould I ever go back? Most likely, because I don't know of any other Mexican places around (yet). I will most likely order take out so as to not deal with such incompetency again.\\n\\nOnce I do find a different one, I won't be coming back here."},{"name":"Muqueca Restaurant","address":"1008 Cambridge St","city":"Cambridge","stars":"4","text":"God, this place is so damn good.

This place came very close to ruining pizza for me.\\n\\nPro: This place stays open insanely late. But let's not get too hung up on that and move on to the \\"Cons\\" because there's plenty...\\n\\nCons:\\n- This place is always packed with belligerent people - even on Christmas Eve. The clientele slowly sways from side to side, which - I kid you not - makes it hard to maneuver to the counter to place an order. I'm in no way judgmental - I came here once in a less than perfect shape and had an absolute blast, might've even eaten something - just a word of warning if you plan on grabbing a late night snack.\\n\\n- The staff is rude, and I'm guessing that comes with the pizza makers being Russian. I don't expect a pat on the back for placing an order on the first try (the customers in front of me had a hard time ordering a cheese pizza), but a quick \\"Thank you\\" would be greatly appreciated.\\n\\n- I ordered a bacon cheeseburger pizza. The gray, gooey mass that they call pizza dough is rubbery, tasteless, and takes longer to bake than the staff assumes - my pizza came out half-done. I guess I accidentally ordered it medium rare? The bacon is tasteless and dry to the point of being a potential health hazard - I could feel it scratching against my throat as I was trying to force it down. The sauce... don't get me started. It's tasteless - let's just leave it at that.\\n\\nIn summary, this place sucks. The whole experience makes you wish you never got a craving for a slice of pizza at 2am. I will not be returning. Ever.

The salsa has a good kick to it and I love how the chips are dense and thick enough to hold the salsa.  I ordered a pull-pork aprea and he ordered empanadas.  Beck ordered a beef-short rib Mexican style sandwich.  When my aprea first came, I was shocked and  thought the waitress made a mistake.  The aprea  was SMALL.  It was the size of my palm....the content was good?  Really couldn't taste all that well considering i finished it in 3 bites...It definitely was not worth the $7.50.  When my bf's empanadas came, he was shocked too.  There they were...like 3 slightly bigger, deep-fried pot-stickers that cost $3 each.  From his remark, they were medicore and nothing too amazing beside the size.  Beck's sandwich came and it was normal in size!  Her braised short ribs were great and flavourful.

VERY FRIENDLY and apologetic. Actually, both the manager and waitress were genuinely embarrassed over our experience.  There is a complete lack of coordination, timing and, apparently, training.  The manager even stated that, even though they've only been open at this location for 3 weeks, they've already had to get rid of employees in the hopes of finding a staff that could do the job..... (it didn't work apparently).  Truthfully, we almost didn't go. I had read other reviews online and most of them, for this location at least, were rather bad. The manager was aware of those reviews and was embarrassed by them stating that she's hoping things will improve.  Hoping?  Hey MANNY... Time to hit the restart button.

Decent cocktail.\\n\\nI really liked my vegan curry sauce a lot, in fact more than the creamier and more cinnamon rich flavor of my companion's regular one. Fried chicken is really good-- a really light batter fry with good sauces.\\n\\nVeggies in the vegan curry were cooked exactly the way I like them: still firm. BUT the disappointment for our trip and really just kind of weird was that the vegan curry had only 2 pieces of cauliflower, 2 chunks of eggplant, and a single halved cherry tomato. If this dish is meant more as a side dish, it should have been a couple dollars less and in the sides section. When it's listed next to the meat entrees and is $9, you expect a decent meal for one person. It really seemed odd to me that there were so few vegetables in it. Maybe they just need to change the expectation of the dish by placing it in a different section of the menu or having a note about portions, because the taste was good it was really just a little shocking to have such a tiny smattering of vegetables set in front of me -- we immediately looked at each other and laughed! It was very beautifully and elegantly plated and the flavors were there, but I really don't like it when the vegetarian dish seems on the menu as an obligation and not it the same robust intention as the meat main plates. That's the sense I got but again maybe it's just a matter of managing expectations better. \\n\\nI will note that there are very few vegetables on the menu elsewhere, it's almost all meat and starch and sauce.

Check out Little Trouble for their badass Blade-Runner/ underground-New York/ this-is-where-the-foot-clan-from-ninja-turtles-hangout joint. And if you know that going in, you're likely to have a fantastic time with friends. \\n\\nThings to know:\\n*****\\nI. LOCATION & PARKING: Find the Foot Clan hangout beneath Marcel in the Westside Provisions eating and shopping area. Parking is a cluster f***, but you have two general options:\\n\\n- Valet (which is right outside by the parking deck.\\n- Park on the East side of the complex and walkover the bridge.\\n\\nThe outside entrance to the hallway, with sexy illuminating light and all, is located by J Crew.\\n\\nII. FOOD & DRINK: As I noted above, the food definitely does not compare to the stellar kickass-ness that is this hideaway. The menu is a hodgepodge of popular East and Southeast Asian eats, from Taiwanese to Thai, many non-serious food lovers gravitate to (and that's totally fine). So if you're serious about food, and would drive to Stone Mountain to eat cheesesteak from a hole-in-the-wall, this is not the place for you. \\n\\nHere's what I had:\\n\\n*Grilled Shrimp: Lightly grilled and lightly doused with, maybe, ponzu sauce and garnished with sweet basil. It was a nice snack, but overpriced. ($7)\\n\\n*Pork Belly Bun: Nice soft bao with pickled cucumber, cilantro, and spicy sesame mayo. It's not the best bao in The A, but I would consider getting it again if I were to visit Little Trouble in the future. ($5)\\n\\n*Blistered Shishitos: Lightly charred and topped with lemon and sea salt. It's a fun snack. I would order these. ($6)\\n\\n*Thai Beef Dumplings: The beef has a nice kick, the dough they use is slimy good, and the chili, cilantro and fish sauce are fine. A-OK. ($8)\\n\\n*Ceviche: It was a little redundant how it was called ceviche on the menu, since it has Hamachi in the description (which is basically Japanese-style ceviche). Regardless, with red onion, ponzu sauce, and other goodies, this was probably the best thing I ate at Little Trouble. ($9)\\n\\nFor drinks, all of them were very strong (but they became not so strong as the night went on). Here's what I sipped:\\n\\n*Sweet & Spicy wings: A bit over fried, but the flavor is good!\\n\\n**Drew Gillespie: Gine, suze, and bitter lemon soda - it's good after a long day of work.  ($10)\\n\\n**Dessert Cat: tequila, stool, maraschino, and strega, lime -- this drink definitely made a meeting I had here less awkward. Especially after the second one. ($9)\\n\\nIII. SERVICE: I've never had a problem with the service, and I really thought they were friendly. Bartenders are less friendly on the weekends, but that should be expected.\\n\\nIV. AMBIENCE & D√âCOR: Look -- this place is super, sexy, and cool, and the low-key, yet vibrant, underground theme vibe is well worth it. Call me a sucker, but I love me some low-lights. And it's not in a pretentious type of way, either.\\n\\nV. PRICES: I think you'll get decent value, considering it's on the Westside. Are six shrimps on a stick with a little drizzle worth $7? No. But, again, you're paying for the atmosphere.\\n\\nVI. OVERALL: Despite meh-OK food and having a few over-priced menu items, I think Little Trouble's atmosphere is worth checking out at least once. Lots of out-of-towners visit me, and this nook often ends up of my short list of \\"Cool Bars I'd Take People To\\" list."},{"name":"The Yaletown Distillery Bar + Kitchen","address":"1131 Mainland Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"3.5","text":"We came in here on Saturday morning for brunch to celebrate my fathers birthday.

I'm bringing up In-N-Out because Five Guys is the closest thing to my aforementioned favorite burger place that I've been able to find up here in the Great Pacific Northwest.\\n\\nOf course, a burger, regular fries and a regular drink set me back more than a ten spot. Ouch. That's steep. Nevertheless, the burger was juicy and loaded with meat. I have to say that the fresh cut fries at Five Guys are actually BETTER than the fries at In-N-Out. They are thicker and cooked longer. No need to order them extra crispy at Five Guys.\\n\\nThey have a nice variety of toppings at Five Guys, too. You can get your burger customized to your exact specifications. They even have mushrooms and jalape√±os. Sweet. Of course, I bet if I asked for my burger \\"animal style\\", I'd get a spatula across my face."},{"name":"TooJay's","address":"2624 E Colonial Dr","city":"Orlando","stars":"3.5","text":"I love Toojay's for many reasons, but for the purpose of this review I will say that if you like desserts, you need to visit.

Moist chocolate cake with a layer of cheesecake between and frosted with a thick fudgy chocolate.

We were all really pleased with our experience!\\n\\nIt was, however, scorching hot outside! So, we were thankful they provided (free) water to everyone to stay hydrated between beers. The process was easy - we walked up and an employee explained what to do/where to go for what beers, etc. They no longer provide tasting glasses. Instead you show up and pay for the beer you want, but you can get them in small 4 oz sized for tasting if that's what you fancy. \\n\\nThey had lots of shaded areas to site and some outdoor games like corn hole. The beer tour was interesting! You just gather around at one of the designated times (1:30, 2:30, 3:30) and join. We loved it! \\n\\nWhen you are in the area, stop by!

We came here for an event that was booked a good week ahead of time  for a corporate outing. The manager and bouncers refused to let us in. We arrived on a charter bus and they claimed that they saw a cooler of drinks on board and therefore we must have drank too much and couldn't enter. \\n\\nThey didn't give anyone the time of day or even see us one by one to confirm that we were sober enough and OK to come in. They flat out refused to let anyone in. The leader of our group argued with the bouncer and one manager for a good 25 minutes while our entire group stood outside shivering in the cold (It was about 20 degrees out). Then the bouncer got aggressive and pushed my manager, HARD. He, of course pushed back and the two of them had a short brawl of sorts until it was broken up and we left. \\n\\nOh, they called the police on us too, and we were stuck there for a good hour before they finally let us go. Yeah, THEY called the cops on US, for a fight their impulsive bouncer started. Greeeaaaaatt hospitality. I will certainly never come back here. Too bad, because the cocktail menu looked decent.

I have tried the one at Cool Moon but didn't quite like it as much. Can't go wrong with the Almond Brittle either. I have been to the other two locations and always feel that the line at the Division location (recently opened) is typically the shortest.

The right place at the right time. I don't know about any of that, but suddenly we were descending a flight of stairs and walking into a large basement complete with bar, restaurant and stage.  \\n\\nWe sat at one of several large community tables in the center of the room.  Lindsey was our server, and most attractive and helpful she was. She brought us menus and drinks before requesting our order.  It was a bit too early for dinner, and a little too late for lunch. So, we opted for dunch, consisting of Buffalo Cauliflower, Bacon, Broc and Cheese Quiche, and their Burger Special.  They were all okay, but not memorable enough to want to return to see what else their kitchen could do.  The cauli was spicy and tender, and about the right size for the appetizer it was. It came with  small container of creamy blue cheese, carrot and celery sticks. The quiche turned out not to be bacon at all, but rather cubes of ham. Disappointing as that meat is not a favorite of anyone at the table. Also, rather than it being a wedge from a quiche pie, it was in the form of a rectangle from a lasagna pan out of the oven.  It didn't alter the taste, but did reduce the amount of pie crust on the plate. The son was satisfied with his burger and shoestring fries. It was closer to well done than the medium requested.  Ho-hum. \\n\\nAt the prices found in this neighborhood we were hoping for a higher quality presentation and meal.

My friend's pasta was delicious, but we made a mistake of not ordering anything with their red sauce. In general the Rino's experience felt authentic, but it was definitely not worth the build-up.

When they first opened it was a great neighborhood joint that was a cut above Jeveli's , good food, friendly service and a great neighborhood vibe. Now..meh! Still good food, but the service was horrible! I was in between jobs (I'm a chauffeur) so I thought I'd treat myself to a nice meal. My waiter was the only male waiter amongst all the hot guidettes that work there, but he seemed more interested in flirting than paying attention to one guy eating alone. That's just wrong. Being in the service business for over 26 years, you try to look for all the reasons you might get bad service, but in this guy's case, there were none. The place was not crowded, I was alone, and it took this guy 10 minutes before he took my order. When my meal came, he asked if I wanted grated cheese, and while I watched him apply the cheese to other diners' meals, he merely dropped the grater on my table. I guess he realized I would not be running up the bill with wine, so my soda sat unattended to after I had finished my third bite with no inquiry if I wanted another and after he dropped off my meal, I never saw him again until check time. I waited 5 minutes for my check and another 5  for him to bring back my CC. So, good food with nothing to wash it down with, a waiter who seemed more involved in socializing than attending to a lone diner, and 3 other waitresses who walked by my empty glass on the edge of table and none bothering to ask me if I want a refill. And this was a Monday night! Just another place that has let success go to it's head."},{"name":"Holy Taco","address":"1314 Glenwood Ave SE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3.5","text":"They didn't even have flavored margaritas and their food wasn't that tasty...nice location to sit out and have a drink and chips though."},{"name":"Cantina La Mexicana","address":"247 Washington St","city":"Somerville","stars":"3.5","text":"Awesome family dive restaurant.

So I thought I would look at Swift Attic's menu that was posted outside. It was still early and no one was out, but this place happened to be open for lunch already. When you walk in, you walk up a set of stairs (it's attic, get it?). The space is super hipster with bird cages hanging from the ceilings and exposed brick. I was the only one in the restaurant, I even l got to watch an interview for one of their bouncers. The waitress was super nice, she even let me plug in my phone to charge. I ordered and the food came out rather quickly. \\n\\nThis food was so fresh! I don't think I've ever had meat that tasted so fresh. I asked them jokingly if they had just killed the pig in the kitchen, she said that they cure all of the meat there in-house. The salad was also very good. I'm not a huge fresh-kale person, but the sunflower seeds and the cheese were the perfect combination and made the kale taste very good. Overall, this was a very good place to happen upon.

Finally, after about a minute (no exaggeration) of her ignoring us and literally yelling at a guy seated some indiscernible question, the gentleman cooking asks us if he could help. We state we called in a take out order, so he asks what we would like. We explain we already called it in and were told it would be five minutes. Now when it comes to the collection of the payment, the lady who ignored us was right there demanding payment. Now for the food. I started with a cup of wanton egg drop soup which was pretty good and stuffed with four wanton (most places give three). A good start that, unfortunately, would not be the trend. The egg roll was abysmal, completely horrid. I went with the pork lo mein. A good portion, but at best it would be described as mediocre.

Drinks came out a little slow, and it took a while for them to take our order. They did feed us tortilla chips with a tomato sauce and Parmesan cheese though which was pretty tasty. Overall service was decent.\\n\\nFood wise they offer a variety of popular Honduran dishes. On the menu you can find items such as Baleadas (a thick flour tortilla) & Carne Molida/pollo con Tajadas (ground beef/chicken with fried plaintains). \\n\\nThe baleadas can be served plain or you can add some sort of filling such as steak, huevo (egg), aguacate (avocado), or Todo (All of the above!). Thanks Google Translate! I had the baleadas with just the steak. You get 3 of them for $8 and they are HUGE. Way bigger than what I was expecting for $8. It was a complete meal. The baleadas were really good and the steak inside was pretty decent. It was sprinkled with some cheese. \\n\\nNot thinking the baleadas would be so big, I also ordered the Ground Beef with fried Plantains for $9. Also a huge serving. The ground beef w/plantains was actually pretty tasty. The plantains are soaked in some sort of tomato sauce and they have a texture almost like french fries. The ground beef was really well seasoned and also had some cheese sprinkled on top. I kinda wish I had the ground beef on a baleada; that would have been pretty tasty. Thinking back at it, this plate was pretty good. Simple, but good.\\n\\nThe girlfriend had the Seafood soup. It's a pretty lite soup, but the broth isn't bad. They have mussels, shrimp, imitation crab, squid, and a whole piece of tilapia. Only thing I didn't like was the imitation crab. Everything else about it was ok. Overpriced really.\\n\\nThey have other items on the menu such as a whole fried tilapia, pork chop, fajitas, and grilled chicken and breast. A lot of people in the group got the \\"Traditional\\" Honduran Breakfast/Dinner which is eggs, beans, chorizo/steak, rice, & sweet plantains. Not a lot of food on the breakfast/dinner plates, but I did Google it and it is indeed a traditional meal. \\n\\nI wouldn't go out of my way to eat here again, but if it were down the street from where I lived or worked, I could see myself stopping in every once in a while.\\n\\nHappy Hour from 1-3pm w/$2 beers and they supposedly have free wi-fi, but forgot to check/ask."},{"name":"Border Cafe","address":"356 Broadway","city":"Saugus","stars":"3.5","text":"Great food and cheap drinks.

Being that the area I live in is down the street from Victory, and not too far from Dogfish Head, we asked for a suggestion that wasn't from any of those breweries, and something not too hoppy.  The beer she suggested was fantastic.  She was also ready and happy to answer any questions we had about anything on the menus.  I want to say her name was Rachel, or something with an R.  Whatever she's being paid, she needs a raise!  When I asked about the house cocktails she broke them down for me, and even let me know what parts of each were made in house- which frankly, was the one thing that made me move from drinking beer to the \\"Cool as a Cuke\\".

I love a good fried tomato, so I was a touch dissapointed when the tomato came out only lukewarm, needed more time on the griddle. The mushrooms were canned and boring as well. The blood puddings were, may I say, an acquired taste. Since blood is the key ingredient, they have a metallic taste to them, and while very rich, was not my cup of tea. The sausages were sweeter than normal sausages, but were like Vienna sausages, sweet and small and not terribly attractive.\\n\\nThe service was attentive and the coffee was hot. I am glad it was only $10 for a meal that could easily feed two people, so value gets points added on, but I expected to be wowed by a nice Irish breakfast, in a neighboorhood that has a great, vibrant, Irish heritage. It had good value, and I will try their other foods in due course.

Come on, people....\\n\\nMy wife and I stumbled across this place shortly after moving to the Orlando area, and it is easily one of my favorite places I've eaten at. Anywhere. The burgers are out of this world, the hot dogs are fantastic, and the chicken tenders are -- no joke -- the best pieces of chicken I have ever put in my mouth. \\n\\nI genuinely don't understand all the underwhelmed responses I've read on Yelp. I've taken everybody I know here -- visiting family members, friends, co-workers -- and I have yet to see anybody less than blown away by the quality of food. My wife's cousin from Miami plans her trips up to Orlando based on what the burger and shake of the month are. Visiting with us is an afterthought (thanks, B21).\\n\\nThe restaurant itself is also super clean and chic-looking. Another family member we took here mostly eats at fancy restaurants. She was shocked when we brought her to get burgers, but once she stepped inside, she was impressed enough by the atmosphere to give it a shot, and -- needless to say, I guess, based on the rest of my review so far -- she loved it.\\n\\nBurger 21 is also a great value. I'm not sure why it gets $$ on Yelp. A crappy fast food burger and fries that some kid probably hocked a loogie in (just joking... I hope) only saves you a buck or two. Even just in terms of quantity per dollar spent, though, I would be surprised if B21 isn't actually the better deal. I can barely finish a full burger at B21, and the shakes, although somewhat pricey, are gigantic (and made with high-quality ingredients like Ghirardelli syrup).\\n\\nFinally, B21 offers a huge amount of variety. Even people that hate normal burgers will find things to love here -- chicken burgers, fish burgers, salads, chicken tenders, cookies, shakes, vegetarian AND super accommodating gluten-free options.... They've got it all.\\n\\nSo basically, if there's any justice in this world, people will stop eating at McD'sand Burger King and support places like B21. I don't think I'm being too melodramatic to say that a 3.5-star rating for Burger 21 is a perfect encapsulation of what's wrong with the world right now....

Sadly she had to work. \\n\\nAnyways, so first things first w/the crawfish that one must know. If you want any of the corn or potatos on the side, they charge extra for those. Ya, its only .25/piece of either, but its still the fact of the matter that bummed me out about that.  Mudbugs were running $7.00/pound, which is $1 more than I normally pay, and I get corn & potatos included with that.

They were definately the biggest batch I've had all season. And this is why the waitress was jealous of em. THere were 7 big boys that had some huge John Holmes style claws that were packed w/that juicy meat we all like. The 2pounds w/the side pieces of corn & potatos was a great meal to put in my aching tummy. My only sorta negative comment would be that they weren't spice heavy. I mean, I could taste a lil kick in em. ANd I realize that they can't be all \\"Bruce Banner turns into the Hulk\\" style spicy, but me personally, I just prefer them to be so damn spicy that they make my lips swollen that way I can get my Jar Jar Binks speak on.

Unfortunately, it was raining the day I went, but I was still up for great beer and delicious fare. To be certain, this isn't German food. It's a beer garden that serves Americanized German food because the Germans are known for their beer. Having fallen head over heels for the veggie sausage at 24 Diner (same chef), my expectations were still high for Easy Tiger.\\n\\nGood:\\n- Easy Tiger's great beer list can't be denied. I'm adding this to the list with Draught House and Flying Saucer of places meant for hopheads and beer nerds. I was happy to see such a selection of East Coast craft brews, but I came to ATX from NYC, so I'm biased.\\n- The Corned Beef Sandwich was, in the words of my Queens-born boyfriend, \\"great, the best I've had in Austin.\\"\\n- I wish the beer cheese and house mustard were sold in jars so I could continue to enjoy them at home. D-lish-us.\\n- The potato salad also had unbelievable flavor - topping all the BBQ places in Austin.\\n- The service was attentive, hip, and well-versed in the beer list. Even though a lot of my picks had run out on their second day in business, our waitress had suggestions at her disposal.\\n\\nBad:\\n- The sauerkraut was more of an interpretation of your classic pickled cabbage. I found it a bit salty and too crunchy and it felt more like a side than a brat topper.\\n- The prices are a bit pretentious for what you're used to seeing in ATX bars. That's not to say that Easy Tiger isn't worth it. I was just a little turned off by the plastic tray and plastic to-go containers that made my German Board feel more like a picnic lunch than a home-cured epicurean experience. Even a wooden board with little cut-outs for the plastic containers would take it up to the level the price tags demand.\\n- The decor seemed a bit stark. There are a few cute details like a bookshelf and cute lighting fixtures that give it character. Again, given that I went the 2nd day they were in business, I wouldn't give this critique too much attention.\\n- I bought a chocolate croissant walking out the door. It was delicious and reminded me of the semester I spent in Spain. I just wish it had been heated up upon request like they do on the other side of the pond.

Despite the \\"onion and garlic\\" name, it was only lightly seasoned and perfectly salted.  \\n\\nFor drinks, JP had a pale ale, and I did the unheard of thing (for me) of ordering a glass of wine (Syrah).

My favorite among the 3 was the quinoa salad - maybe b/c I'd never had quinoa before. I'd seen that ingredient a lot lately in recipes for \\"healthy\\" foods. I liked the texture a lot, and honestly, I think \\"liking it\\" was psychological too - my body was probably delighted to be getting something good for me :) Their quinoa salad also had shredded chayote, marcona almonds, and herbs (mostly parsley) - yummy! I'm definitely buying some quinoa at Trader Joe's this wknd!\\n\\nAs for the tacos, I liked the fried tilapia taco better. A lot had to do with the chipotle aioli - and the taco also had Mexican slaw. I wasn't a fan of the beef brisket - like Jang C mentioned in his review, the taco was way overstuffed and completely fell apart. I'm not complaining about too much meat though - better more than none. However, it was more meat than anything else. The taco also had Vidalia onion relish (barely tasted) and random-looking big slices of pickled carrots. The most interesting sounding taco was the chicken hearts - I was hoping someone at our table would get it b/c I just wanted a taste - but I guess we were all chickens w/o hearts :) \\n\\nNot a fan of their chips & salsa - the chips are extremely greasy.

The previous reviews have covered it all and said it better than I ever could.  But I like to see myself type so here is my $0.02.\\n\\nLet's start by saying that this is a brunch menu which can't be found anywhere else in town.  No omelettes here, no pancakes or waffles, no moon over my hammies, not a single country fried steak....what a relief!  Thank you good people of Toro Bravo for expanding our horizons!  Who needs hash browns when you have polenta, why ask for an omelette when you can get the shakshuka, and a bacon wrapped date is an obvious choice over any fruit bowl.  Be glad to know that there is no shortage of eggs or bacon here to remind you what meal you are eating, but there is no mistaking this menu for any corner cafe.\\n\\nThe atmosphere is urban, clean, and inviting.  Even at a communal table, the space feels spacious and relaxing.  Servers are on point and never let your Stumptown get cold!  \\n\\nSo if you are tired of the run-of-the-mill brunch offerings, go down to the Hub building on Williams and get you some Tasty n Sons.  If you are wise you will bring a group and share everything because you WILL want to try it all.\\n\\nP.S.

This store, there on Bethal before the street makes its lazy end at 315, is no change from the corps-wide 'bipolarness' of the chain.  I've came here for years because their simple rural meals were always consistent--you knew what you were going to get--and the service was excellent.  Today I find myself visiting less and less; though the upspring in competition has something to do with it, the main cause is that Bob's seem to be in a slow decline. \\n\\nThis store seems to suffer from staff changes.  For several years they've maintained a quality staff that knew and executed their job with friendly precision.  This staff has completely turned over in the last few years leaving a bit of a void.  Though I was want for nothing this trip and the service was good, it still seemed something was unharmonious.  \\n\\nWhat really has dropped this place from the top-five of my Breakfast choices is food quality.  They just don't hit the high notes they once did with their folk tunes (dishes.)  The culprit is upper management I think; pressured by either food cost or profit margin they have selected to cut ingredients or amount instead of raising prices.  I am on the Yelp record in saying I'd rather pay a few more cents then be scrimped on quality.  Here are a couple points in that regard: \\n\\n1.)  The Western Omelet once chuncked full of ham and peppers is now a thin egg wrapped phantom of itself.  Omelets, to me at least, are about the filling.  The egg is just the base; it is not meant to be the strongest flavor.  But as they fix it today it comes off as scrambled eggs with a ham seasoning.  Today it has at most 1/3 of the ham it once did, for what I can tell. \\n\\n2.) Their blueberry hotcakes ( imbed fruit which I like) once busting with berries in a thick cooked batter are now thinner disks with substantially less berries.  Ten years ago these came almost purple with the berries teaming at the top.  Today they often don't look like they have any fruit at all coming off the stove.  \\n\\n3.)  Home fries, wedges of potatoes that Bob was a mainstream master at, once came in an adequate pile.  Today they serve fewer wedges an order as a side.  They also seem to be lessed cooked, as too often they are not absolutely soft all the way through. \\n\\nThe issue here isn't just value. Making a product with less than the recipe is changing the product.  A chain like Bob's thrives on consistency--you know what you are going to get.  When they tinker with that they threaten their very strength in the market. \\n\\nBe that as it is, it is still a 3-star place imho.  Out of staters may like its comfort food down on the farm ethic and I urge any one if them interested to try it.  It is still good and may be a novelty for them.  But for us long term midwesterners, it has lost a few steps, and that's a shame. \\n\\nThough the coffee is still great!"},{"name":"Truluck's","address":"10225 Research Blvd, Ste 4000","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"Went last night for our 11th anniversary.

But the burger at its best is GREAT.  Just the right amount of fattiness, and they generally actually cook it rare or medium-rare when you order it, which is tought to find.\\n\\nAs previous reviews have said, casual, unpretentious, welcoming, relaxing.  Lots of neighborhood families on some nights.  And the beer selection is pretty incredible for a place like this.

This is a common theme throughout the evening.\\n\\nWe waited. And waited. My stomach was full of ill-eaten pound cake and Cheddarjack Cheez-it's  while awaiting for my boyfriend to awaken from his slumber to go eat food with me. \\n\\nStill, after reading the menu intensely and being ready to order for at least 5 minutes, my boyfriend's stomach couldn't take it anymore. He got up and go his own help. He waited at the bar awhile while being ignored for another 5 minutes. Were we invisible? Servers came by to service the other patrons who were sitting inside, they saw us and didn't come by us. Oh, the humanity!\\n\\nMy boyfriend finally flagged down the attention of one of the bartenders to order food. He had Italian beef, I had the venison cheddar link (no pretzel buns, because they were out).\\n\\nI sat at our little corner all the while, still being ignored by servers who were there as often as fleeting glimpses of ankles at a 1920s burlesque show. \\n\\nWe ate our food, which was brought out to us by the same bartender who took our order. We witnessed him run around faster than Roadrunner, bussing tables, bringing food to other tables, wiping down tables, and simply doing it all. He was the hero in this sorry tale.\\n\\nThe food, outstanding. My link was spicy, the pickled veggies that came with it salty and sour. It would have been great with the pretzel bun that didn't exist for me.\\n\\nThe Italian beef, fantastic. Right balance of meat, cheese, veggies and bread, made with the best ciabatta I've ever had. \\n\\nOriginally we planned on staying longer, enjoying ourselves on a surprise night out. The state of service at Easy Tiger and being repeatedly ignored by servers left us with a sour note in our mouths. \\n\\nWe walked out through the patio area, and saw a large group of non-homeless people hanging out near the bridge area.

We agreed we do better in our respective kitchens.  Our main dishes - the polenta in her case and the benedict (with oysters) in mine - were good.  Not exceptional, but good and worth the price.  The reason neither of us would probably go back:  the noise.  Accanto's interior surfaces comprise acoustically \\"hard\\" materials, which cause sounds to echo throughout the place.  At times we could hardly hear each other talk.  Part of the problem is their insistence on maintaining a musical soundtrack...the music was  fine, but it became a \\"competitor\\" in the sound wars in that diners had to talk over it, which just escalated things, etc.  Neither my friend nor I want to have to shout to be heard during a meal we are having to catch up on each others' lives, especially when that experience is had over \\"OK\\" food."},{"name":"Southern Kin Cookhouse","address":"500 Assembly Row","city":"Somerville","stars":"4","text":"This is seriously one of the best restaurants in the Greater Boston Area.

Really the price keeps me away from places like this for lunch but since my friend was picking up the tab that day, money was no object.  SWEETNESS!  Don't get me wrong, this is not a pricey joint at all.  I just prefer to spend $10 or less at lunch but I crave quality so therein lies my internal lunch conflict!\\n\\nSo I arrived to a somewhat busy restaurant but really given the large space that is Cinco, it seemed somewhat empty (strange, the parking lot was pretty full).  My friend and I ate at the bar and were served by a somewhat disinterested bar keep.  She absolutely did her job of serving us food but really did not spend much time beyond that conversing with us and was more interested in completing her side work.  \\n\\nBut I digress and am really here to let you know about the food.  We snacked on some chips and salsa while our orders came out.  IMO the salsa had major potential of being very good but was lacking in flavor by one ingredient to really take it there.  I thought the chips were fresh and quality but also just short.  So for my lunch entree the bartender recommended the dish with tortillas, black beans, guac, choice of meat (I got steak), with melted cheese and creme fresh on top.  Name escapes me but it was the 9.99 dish.  I will say once again that it was missing flavor by one thing.  You know, everything on the dish was quality in ingredients and in freshness and the steak was cooked to temp just right but it just missed that awesome flavor by one thing. \\n\\nIn conclusion this place reminds me a lot of Rosa Mexicano.

The dates were sweet and savory. We then had the hush puppies that came with a side of jalape√±o butter. The hush puppies were deliciously fluffy in the center with a crispy, crunchy outer layer. At first I thought the jalape√±o butter wouldn't work. I tried it and the first thing out of my worth was wow, the flavors of spicy and deep fried savory dough really work. \\n We then moved on the the lamb shanks with the kimchi. The lamb was thinly cut with the bone in. It reminded me of Korean style BBQ. The kimchi was also great. The Speggetini carbonara then showed up and didn't last long since it was one of our table's favorite dishes. The noodles were cooked a little over aldente but perfect for the carbonara dish which was covered in the perfect amount of ragu sauce and guanciale. The bread that came with the carbonara looked to be oven toasted to perfection, crunchy on the outside and soft and delicious once I bit into the toast. \\nI ordered the hanger steak with onions on a bed of butter lettuce.

Disney Springs has a vast selection of restaurants to choose from but we wanted something quick and simple.  We noticed a long line coming out of a place called Chicken Guy. Neither one of us had heard of it, but we figured it had to be good to have a line all the way out the door!  We even asked someone in line if it was a good place to eat and he said the Bourbon Brown Sugar BBQ sandwich was amazing!  So we decided to try it out.\\nCome to find out, this restaurant creator is Guy Fieri who is trying to corner the chicken sandwich market! \\n I ordered the Chicken Tenders meal combo which came with 5 tenders, fries,  drink & 2 dipping sauces. The key feature of this restaurant is the variety of 22 signature sauces. As well as how the chicken is prepared. Each piece is brined in a bath of lemon juice, pickle juice, and buttermilk. Fieri says there are two schools of thought when it comes to making fried chicken: \\"There are chefs that brine and chefs that don't. It took him 2 years to perfect the brining. The chicken is also all-natural, antibiotic-free, never frozen, hand-pounded, and breaded fresh daily. The famous sauces are categorized as: Guy Favorites, The Classics and Hot & Spicy.  I tried the Curry Mayo, Garlic Parmesan and Avocado Crema. Note: for any additional sauce, it's 50 cents each! \\nThe Avocado Creama dip was very bland and a bit brown. So I replaced it with the Bourbon Brown Sugar BBQ sauce. All 3 were delicious.  I was disappointed with the fries being a bit overcooked and flat.

An everything bagel with caviar cream cheese, dill and gravlax along with hot sauce (which seemed absent on mine) comes wrapped in butcher paper and split in half. The caviar cream cheese gave it a slightly pungent taste and the gravlax was melt in your mouth luxurious.

Tried the sweet biscuits with blueberries and creme, which was small and afforded one bite for each of us.

We were his only table, and he took forever to bring anything, and when he did, he wouldn't come back forever.\\n\\nIt really, really surprises me, that someone would open up a Mexican restaurant within spitting distance of two others. Even more surprising, is that it isn't as good as either of those other places, AND, it is the site of not one, not two, but at least THREE failed restaurants; all of which were not even Mexican.\\n\\nIf you are desperate for something new, I say try it. Don't be surprised if your food is totally forgettable, and you leave dissatisfied, with more money gone from your wallet than should be. Seriously, I had three tacos, and a vodka and grapefruit; which worked out to $15. \\n\\nA friend of mine joked that perhaps they were aiming for more mid-upscale Mexican, but I have to say it; you actually have to do more than charge too much for your food... it should be good, and the service should be too.\\n\\nThis place will NOT be open long.

Myself and a few friends went for Restaurant Week in Boston which is always a good excuse to try nice new restaurants in the city. It's location is right off of the Boston Common but we almost walked by it when we were looking. It has a small, unassuming \\"49\\" on the door with the full name written out on the walkway in front of the door. First impressions of the decor were very contemporary upscale. This place definitely caters to the twenty-something Boston crowd. Not a place you'd want to wear a graphic tee and flip flops to but anything from a nice pair of jeans and a polo to business casual seems to be ok here. It's dimly lit inside but the layout of the place seems very tasteful with a bar at the front and tables at the back. \\n\\nWe came on a Tuesday night so there were only a few tables full with a handful of people at the bar. We all ordered the same thing off the fixed price restaurant week menu, starting with Fried Frogs Legs and Tarragon Waffles. The frog legs were the real reason we came to this restaurant and they didn't disappoint, tasty almost like chicken with maybe a bit more chew. I would never think to pair them with waffles (I wouldn't know what to pair frog legs with anyway), but it was a great choice by the chef. \\n\\nThe main course was Quail served over a bed of vegetables. It was tough to follow the frog legs but this was absolutely delicious. The Quail had the texture of dark turkey meat with just the right amount of gamey flavor. \\n\\nThe dessert was truly the pi√®ce de r√©sistance of the meal. Nutella Cr√®me Br√ªl√©e with Amaretti Biscotti. If you could distill sex into food form, this would be it. The Cr√®me Br√ªl√©e was incredible, light and fluffy under a hard surface of caramelized sugar. We all wished they had given us smaller spoons to eat it with so that we could enjoy it longer. \\n\\nOverall the meal was excellent. One of the best I've had in Boston. The waiters were incredibly attentive (not overbearing) and were always on hand to refill our glasses. After looking at the full menu, 49 Social really seems like a good deal for the upscale feel of the place. Most main course items are in the $25 range and if their restaurant week menu is any indication, it is certainly worth it. This is a good \\"third date\\" sort of place with excellent food and a very contemporary-Boston feel.

These came and they were practically inedible because they were doused in garlic salt and that was all you could taste.  I tried to scrape off as much as I could but it was pretty futile.

I took one bite of the onion rings and they had some weird aftertaste I couldn't put my finger on so $1.50 extra for nothing because I didn't eat them.  The hubby's onion rings didn't have that aftertaste but they still weren't good enough for either of us to eat.  He said the pepperoni on his sandwich tasted funny and he wouldn't get it again.

We felt like over $30 was too much for what we got quality wise.  Now we know I guess.

It even eclipses Pacific Northwest's hometown sustainable favorite, Burgerville.

The basic limited menu beats In N Out by size, quality, and incorporating virtually any extra you actually love- grilled onions to jalapenos. Hand cut fresh fries complement the American standard. Five Guys makes both the way we always heard Mom & Dad (or grandma and grandpa) reminisce about hamburgers in the \\"good old days.\\"\\n\\nMy wife noticed how juicy these burgs were right away. She is not a hamburger person either.\\n\\nPersonally I love the fries which come either in original or cajun style. It's a matter of taste I guess. If you grew up with today's pre-cut frozen fries, or remember McDonalds' old days when they cut their own, double cooking them (my job in high school) you may still prefer that crisper taste. These are \\"original original\\" style- fresh cut, one long stretch of cooking giving them a particular consistency, flavor and level of crispness. So they're not a crisp fry, but they are the way all of us old McDonalds prep crews used to make them in the 60's and 70's when the managers weren't around.\\n\\nPrices are on par with Burgerville, a little more than the national chains  and less than Red Robin. Five Guys taste simply blows all of 'em out of the water.\\n\\nThere are a few things that are not quite so great. \\n\\nWalking into the store, if you choose to stay and eat, you'll be bombarded by bright red & white tile where supra-liminal advertising-- posters & large sized  print reviews are EVERY WHERE commanding us to love these delights. So Five Guys lacks the burger ambiance of a place like Helvetia Tavern, but it does communicate (somewhat loudly) \\"simplicity\\" in all its deliciousness!

I may have been lucky. During our stay we were helped out by the most bubbly and friendly employee who introduced herself to me as Q. If this girl is not a manager, she should be! She knows how to keep the customers coming and displays FANTASTIC customer service. \\n\\nShe greeted us as we walked in and Alex and I sat down with the menus to figure out what we wanted. It was Alex's first time, and I've only been to a Burger 21 once years ago, in Fort Myers, and it was.. forgettable. \\n\\nWhile we were figuring out what we wanted, Q was singing throughout the dining room and she was having a good time. Nice voice too! It's always good to see employees having fun and still getting the job done. \\n\\nAnyway, she took our order like normal and when we ordered fries, she offered to make something for us called \\"boss sauce\\", which is a mix of a few different sauces from their sauce bar (I have to say, this sauce bar is an AWESOME addition to the store, located next to a hand washing station.) and she came out and gave us one to try.\\n\\nI had a strange request. I didn't really know what sweet potato fries tasted like, and they offer it here. We asked Q if she could possibly throw literally maybe like 3 individual sweet potato fries in our shareable of regular fries just so I can try it. \\n\\nThis girl. She brings out a side cup full of them, with a few regular fries in there too. I was so taken back. I didn't expect such amazing service! I tried them with the boss sauce. It was amazing!!! I told her I loved it and she brings THREE MORE. Our big shareable of fries came out next, then our burgers came out. \\n\\nAlex got the loaded spud burger. It was pretty good! It had an oniony flavor but wasn't like an unpleasant oniony flavor. It was tasty, trust me!  It also had a scallion cream which was very unique and a great addition for flavor, and the potato pancake was fluffy and crispy. I ordered the patty melt and added lettuce and tomato. It was a pretty big sandwich! It had a specific sauce in it (I forgot the name..) that added a lot for flavor. I ate it with boss sauce in every bite too! \\n\\nBefore we left, I got lost in a random conversation with Q. It's awesome when employees treat you like more than a customer that comes in and leaves. I love when employees make a connection! It makes people want to come back. \\n\\nYou leave plates on the tables and they take care of it for you. They also serve beer and wine, and have a shake bar! \\n\\nVery cute restaurant and excellent food and customer service."},{"name":"Satu'li Canteen","address":"2901 Osceola Pkwy, Ste E","city":"Orlando","stars":"4.5","text":"We have been here several times since it opened.

When you walk in the door, one of the first things you notice if that it's often filled with Mexicans. That's a good sign when picking a Mexican restaurant. \\n\\nThe Sopa Tortilla is the best in town. The tacos al pastor is excellent. The Tampique√±a is served exactly as it should with an enchilada verde, rice and rajas (grilled chilies and onions) is also top notch, . I love pretty much everything on the menu, but then again I just love Mexican food! \\n\\nIf you have been to their original location you know it was cramped, and best suited for take out. Recently they have opened a second location, just a few doors down from the original, which offers much more seating, and a far better ambiance. There is some outdoor seating if it's a nice day. \\n\\nThe only problem I have with Salsa & Agave is their washroom. They don't have one in the restaurant, you have to go outside the building, unlock a door and the washroom is in a labyrinth of hallways. If you don't mind that, you'll be fine. \\n\\nIt's not fancy - leave your tuxedo at home.

The outside patio is the perfect place to sit back and enjoy a cold beer with what is hands-down the best guacamole in the city. The chips are homeade, so are different from what you might expect, but they are tasty and a good complement to the guac. The tacos are fresh and delicious, (according to my husband who loves the carne asada) but I'd advise ordering them on flour tortillas as the corn ones just disintigrate. \\nMy personal favorite item, and the thing that keeps me coming back, is the shrimp coctail. I have never had one served like this, in a big glass with tomatoes, cucumber and sliced avocado, in a thin, spicy sauce. This is NOT traditional shrimp coctail, in fact if you served it with a shot of vodka, it would be the best bloody mary you ever tasted. (weird, I know, but trust me) There are 6 collossal shrimp in the glass, making it a decent deal at 6$. I get this and an order of the cornmeal cakes (which are basically silver-dollar sized grits/polenta pancakes, mmmmm) and this is more than enough food for me, after a guac starter.\\nThe prices are reasonable, but keep in mind that everything is a la carte, so you get what you order, and nothing more.

For some reason, Panera thinks a vegetarian sandwich is a piece of lettuce and two tomato slices between two mushy pieces of soggy bread.  There isn't any hummus or even a slice of mozzarella cheese (no middle to the sandwich).  Yet, they charge you the price of a meat sandwich.  If you are vegetarian, do not eat here (even if in a hurry and with no other options).  They hate vegetarians.

Just an observation. \\n\\nThe menu was page after page of items listed by their Mexican names, with their English descriptions underneath. I found it a little difficult to sieve through and narrow down on what I wanted. In the end my guest and I opted to slip the largest and most expensive of share platters.

One of the servers delivered it to us without a word or brief description. Luckily neither of us had any food allergies or restrictions. Had it been the case, it could have been negligence. The dips were poured into little ramekins from a two liter plastic drink jug. The brown one was spicy and tasted almost meaty. And the green, I believe was made from tomatillos, with a texture that closely resembled the creaminess of sour cream. The chips were not your regular Tostitos. They were a tasty corn chip, with only the slightest hint of oil. This we ate down to the grease soaked paper towel, that lined the bottom of the wicker chip basket. And of course we had to have the Mexican beer special along with our meal. \\n\\nWould I come back? - Yes. I knew I liked the place when a smile crept across my lips, as I navigated to my seat. This place was just fun to be in. Kitschy decor, upbeat beats, and amazing food. Food from a well dressed and well groomed kitchen staff, operating out of a partially opened kitchen.

There is so much more to the menu that I would like to try. \\"Armadillo Eggs\\" (deep fried jalape√±os stuffed with cream cheese), \\"Flauntas\\" (flute shaped tacos), and authentic Mexican desserts with agave nectar and abaelita (a Mexican brand of chocolate).

Anyhow, that was all really good.\\n\\nThe bread that comes to your table is dense, dry, and tasteless. I would think that that's a simple thing to get right, so I was surprised by its mediocrity. For dinner we ordered the sardine appetizer, and for our meal Ovo a Cavallo, and muscles. The steak was surprisingly bland, though still edible and the muscles were small, though the sauce they were cooked in was probably the best clam sauce I've ever tasted. Our server couldn't have been slower, although she seemed nice enough (probably new). When she brought our bill, she had charged me for all three cups coffee I'd had (which seemed weird considering most restaurants don't charge you for each individual cup and allow casual refills).\\n\\nShe insisted that it was the restaurant's policy that they charge you. I wanted to  confirm so I asked to see the manager. When he came over I asked about the policy, \\"I'm just surprised, I've never heard of a restaurant that charges for each cup of coffee.\\" He became incredibly condescending saying things like, \\"I've been in the restaurant industry for longer than you've been alive, don't tell me how to run my restaurant.\\"\\n\\nI've never been spoken to like that by a manager. Eventually he took it off my bill, but after being spoken to like that, I don't think we'll be back. If you are looking for good food, this is a good enough option, though the food is a bit overpriced for the quality. Just don't expect to get good service."},{"name":"Double Mountain Taproom","address":"4336 SE Woodstock Blvd","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"just OK.

They were like diced up pieces of medium-cooked steak. Not only this, but they weren't any bit fatty (to some other folks' delight). Not sure if I just got a \\"bad\\" sandwich, but my coworkers' pulled pork and brisket sandwiches looked quite tasty. The bacon collards were delicious but a bit too greasy and salty, and I think because we had to wait so long, they gave me some delicious cornbread free of charge! However, all of our food was cold. I think our plates were out on the counter for awhile before they could wrap it all up. Note to those getting food to go, while the packaging is nice, I would advise against putting this in a bag or rubbed up against nice clothing since grease might bleed through.\\n\\nHaving been to the Kendall spot, I suspect the owners/staff are still figuring things out.

GREAT price for what you get! My girls and I stayed here for a weekend getaway and we had an AMAZING experience! The only thing that left a bad taste in my mouth was the front desk staff, they weren't that inviting or friendly at all. My girls and I walked in along with a group of other ppl and the two staff at the front desk both had customers in front of them and they didn't bother to acknowledge anyone that waked in the front door.t would have been nice if they tried looking up and greeting the crowed with a \\"hi how are you? We will be right with you\\". When it was finally my turn to get checked-in the staff who was assisting us by the name of Gloria still didn't bother too greet me with a proper welcome, all she said was \\"you're checking-in? What name is the reservation under?\\". It wasn't til the actual end of the whole process when we were almost done with paperwork is when she decided to try and spark a conversation. Also the  wifi info that she gave to us was incorrect, she said it was our room number and the pw would be the name of the resort. We eventually had to figure it out on our own once we got to our room. Also front desk does not answer  their phone, we dropped a glass platter while getting things out our car, we called front desk over and over to have someone pass by and clean it up cause we didn't want anyone to cut their selves since the glass was right outside in the parking lot. No one bother answering. We eventually had to drive back to the front desk and tell them to send a cleaning  person by, they never sent anyone so we ended up finding a broom in our room and did it our selves. Also on the website they advertise for an on site grocery store, that's a lie. There isn't a store within the resort. \\n\\nAnyways besides the flaws I told you about,  the resort itself is BEAUTIFUL and CLEAN! The rooms are huge as well as the bathrooms! Just amazing, the resort is really big so depending on where your located you'll have to drive to the pool.

The Irish bacon that comes with the Irish breakfast was way way way too salty, their toast is always limp and not particularly toasty, and their home fries taste okay but there's always chunks of potato that aren't fully done (and they're not crispy). \\n\\nNot much to say, it's just middle-of-the-road food, fine for an occasional weekend breakfast."},{"name":"Momiji Japanese Cuisine","address":"3720 Mt Seymour Parkway","city":"North Vancouver","stars":"4","text":"I've found it easy to forget our rather lackluster opinion of Momiji when it first opened back in 2014.

So if you're getting anything on the menu I'd recommend this dish. I decided to try something new and this was my result...\\n\\nIt was my first time here and I have to say I was not a fan of the community tables (you sharing a table with 3 or four other groups of people) lucky for me one of them happened to be directly across from me, a couple just casually making out the entire time rather than eating the food in front of them. Whenever I go to restaurants I go straight for the booths or anywhere where I am not side by side to other people so I have my own personal space. If that's what you're looking for, you won't find it here... for this reason alone I already wasn't feeling it.\\n\\nFood: I got the chicken and waffles it brought three big pieces of chicken and one huge waffle underneath. Whoever said this plate was enough for two clearly has never been out to eat with me, but that's besides the point.... I was content with my food until I got to my last piece of chicken and it was not cooked all the way, it was all pink and it just tasted disgusting, it completely ruined it for me. Let me just say that even if all the pieces had been cooked all the way I still was not wowed by this meal where I would feel the need to say it was so good I'd have to come back and order it again. That was not the case... it was just ok. I had went through photos of the food prior to coming here and wanted to try the roasted oysters but was disappointed when mine looked nothing like the pictures. The oysters were completely burnt, they were all black and I did not see that happen in anyone else's photos. It honestly looked so awful I was embarrassed to even post it. For drinks we got the \\"flights\\" it was basically 3 shots of different flavor whiskey and it was really strong (still good though) but it was probably the only decent part of the whole experience. They were 4$ each and the pecan pie flavor was my favorite.\\n\\nFinal verdict: I will not be back here to eat again. I wasn't a fan of the seating, the food was not what I expected it to be and overall I just didn't have the best dining experience. The only thing that gave this place a 3 instead of a 2 was the drink menu and the drinks I happened to order, which I was very satisfied with...other than that I would easily pass on this restaurant."},{"name":"Tasty n Sons","address":"3808 N Williams Ave, Ste C, Hub Building","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"One great place for brunch.

I think I preferred it cooked through the way it was, because yolkiness would complicate the flavor profile of the well-crafted tomato stew.\\n- It's actually baked, so the food is quite hot and takes awhile to cool down in the casserole dish.

There is absolutely no parking available so you have to find a spot on the street. If there isn't a table then you have to wait and it has to be outside. The bar across the street was being remodeled so we had to stand out in the very cold Boston weather. We were first on the list and waited about 30 minutes. Once we were seated we had a waitress who was experienced and a lot of fun. We started with wine and I like how they pour a glass. They are smaller than your typical wine glass but they filled it to the rim. The bread was average which I was actually surprised about. Selfishly I was pleased because I didn't want to fill up on it. We started with an order of the rice balls and meatballs. Both were flavorful and I like the red sauce or \\"gravy\\" served with the meatballs. We then ordered the antipasto which was well presented. The meats and cheeses were very tasty along with the artichokes and mushrooms. The restaurant is small and the tables do not have a lot of room so juggling plates became a skill with all the dishes we ordered. The next course was the house salad which was fresh mixed greens and some onion and a tomato. Again very basic but I didn't want to eat too much and miss the main course. We ordered four different entrees to include the eggplant, open ravioli with seafood, lobster ravioli and seafood fra diavolo with a white sauce. We then had a side of pasta with red sauce. Yum yum yum!! The portions are insane and you will eat three meals off the one serving they give you. The eggplant was tender, lightly breaded and just delicious. The open ravioli came with a marscapone sauce with shrimp, lobster and scallops. It was incredibly light, flavorful and the pasta sheets were perfect. The lobster ravioli is packed with meat. For once a dish is stuffed with lobster as it should be! It's heavy, colorful and creamy. The fra diavolo had so many clams and muscles you couldn't get to the pasta. Excellent white wine sauce and will be ordered again. We ordered three desserts which included Creme br√ªl√©e, pastry with vanilla and chocolate sauce/pudding and an almond cake. I have no complaints. We will be back and hope the bar across the street is open while we wait for a table.

And by greeted I mean they just stared at us until one of my friends stepped up to the plate and asked, \\"Uhhh what do we do?\\" They told us that we could either eat inside or go upstairs to the rooftop patio. Choosing the latter, we walked upstairs into an oasis of misters and loud music. We sat down for a few minutes but due to the amount of people upstairs we decided to move back inside because we were hungry and wanted to be served faster.\\n\\nThis is where things get really interesting...\\n\\nWe were seated downstairs and within a few minutes, our waitress walked over with menus. After showing us the drink specials we decided that we just wanted waters and some queso/guacamole. Seems like an easy request... But not at Cinco. The queso arrived first. With no chips. Then the guacamole. Still no chips. Finally, the water showed up to wash down all those salty chip-- nope, still no chips. We finally got chips (after pulling aside our waitress and reminding her) and put our orders in.\\n\\nAs we're waiting, an employee walks up to our table (presumably from the rooftop bar) looks at my friend and goes, \\"Want your purse?\\" and dangles my friends purse while making an ugly face. My friend laughs, takes the purse, and says thank you. The woman promptly walks away. No \\"you're welcome,\\" no smile. This is Cinco after all, nothing positive happens here.\\n\\nWhile we wait, we notice the \\"playlist\\" of music blaring through the speakers.

Consistently bad service doesn't count.\\n\\nTime drags on and eventually our food comes out. The guy bussing our food forgot the kickstand for our order (because of course he did) so we have to stand up and surround him while he balances the food in his arms, carefully picking our plates off the circular serving table. I'll be honest, it was his first day on the job so I can't blame him for the culture of mediocrity that seems to pervade every inch of Cinco.\\n\\nThe food was decent. Not great by any means.

The biscuit/pork belly app consisted of a biscuit, topped with a peachy jam, pork belly, and a fried green tomato--the flavor was okay, but it was stone cold and the pork belly was a sad grey and extremely dry, which is odd due to pork belly being a fat piece of pork.  The pork rinds in the pork rind nachos were actually pretty good, but the nacho polenta/grits dip was bland, not cheesy at all, needed more salt, and contained more of said pork belly although the pork belly in the dip was less dry that the pork belly on the biscuit.  The ribs were just downright terrible, both in terms of meat quality and flavor, and slathered in sauce that tasted like it came from a bottom of the barrel 99 cent bottle of barbecue sauce you buy at the supermarket, and came with a cold griddled slab of cornbread and a side of mac and cheese (the sides tasted okay).

Everything is well-made, that much is clear, but they're still in the process of working out new restaurant \\nkinks - slow service, figuring out what flavors work for their products, the waitstaff's knowledge of their product, etc - but I'm willing to stick with them. Their knishes are far better than Katzinger's, which are slick with oil and reconstitute poorly. These knishes however, are hearty and delicious with a simple potato onion filling that thankfully doesn't try to be anything other than comfort food. It's also the only place that I know of to get jelly-filled sufganiyot in the city.

Our reservation was at 8pm and we are seated promptly after we arrived at a very nice table with a view of the water in Deep Cove.  The service by our server Kristy was excellent as she was attentive but not overbearing.  I actually informed Kristy about my allergy to dairy and she was extremely accommodating as she knew which items on the menu did not have dairy.  She even offered to bring us olive oil and balsamic with our bread instead of butter.  \\n\\nWe started with the Seafood Chowder and Beef Carpaccio which were both absolutely amazing.   For my main, I ordered the Linguine Pescatore which was a delectable pasta dish with a generous portion of fresh crab and shrimp tossed with the pasta.  Perfect for $17 I must say.  My husband had the angry chicken and was also very pleased.  We actually had a hard time deciding on our meal because there were so many really great sounding choices.  We will definitely be back to try out some more items on the menu.  \\n\\nOur bill came out to less than $100 for two appies, two mains, two glasses of wine, tea and coffee.

C&L brews their own beer which is pretty awesome and from what the waitress told us, they tend to mix it up every few weeks.  We shared the ham plate and oyster sampler to start.  The ham plate was awesome and came with an assortment of condiments like a red pepper jelly and some kind of cheese spread. I could eat that entire plate for dinner and be totally happy. The oysters were really good as well and I really loved that they served 6 different varieties from different regions. You could really taste the difference between something from California and something from Nova Scotia-a really nice touch.  I wish that I could praise this place all day long but unfortunately the entrees were a pretty big letdown.  I had the stuffed roasted quail and my boyfriend had the boar stew.  The dishes were good but they were both fussy and busy.  It seemed like the chef put too many ingredients on the plate and in the end you couldn't really taste proteins' the natural flavor.  The subtle sweetness from quail was overpowered by tart/sweet tomato and the chickpeas gave off this weird sandy texture when you had one in the same bite as the quail making the quail taste just like chicken.  The boar stew was very aggressively seasoned and I personally felt like it was mushy instead of being gamey and heart.  The egg noodles the stew was served over was also a bit disappointing-very bland and pretty boring.  Nevertheless, this place is still a pretty solid 4 stars in my book because the simple items on their menu are phenomenal!

It doesn't look like much from outside - and after years and years of driving by it without a second thought, we finally made the move to check it out.\\n-\\nIt's not bad!  A casual vibe inside.  2 rooms:  The first as you walk in has a row of booths up against the windows, a small curvy goofy looking bar to your left, and some tables and chairs further down on the left.  Through this main room is another - and it's just tables and chairs - very bright in there - it was really weird.  Anyhow - the decor is cheap - not BAD just certainly not a place you need to dress up to go to.  The chairs all look like the kind you'd see in a pizza joint or something.  There were these totally out of place decorations hanging from the ceiling: like flowers or fairy wings.  I couldn't figure it out!\\n-\\nWell, they had the standard big screen tvs hanging with the game on, and so we got a booth by the window and ordered.  These booths are right up against the window - you are literally several feet from passing cars - and cars stopping at the light outside.  I thought it would be noiser, but it wasn't bad.  And the shades were drawn so that the people sitting right outside the window aren't glaring at you as you eat.  Thankfully.\\n-\\nWe got some of their mixed drinks - a \\"Smurf\\" and some other kind - I can't remember and it's not listed on their menu online.  Anyhow - we both really liked them.  The Smurf drink looked like some kinda star-trek thing, and so of course I loved it.  It was really good too!  The other was what - a white russian type thing?  The dame liked that too.\\n-\\nThe free bread is amazing.  It's this fresh white bread toasted with garlic and oregano and literally swimming in butter.  Kind of gross and greasy, but also kind of AWESOME.\\n-\\nWe got the \\"Joey's Garlic Bread\\" as an app - cause hey, we like bread!  It's 6 giant slices of that awesome bread with slices of tomatos and cheese and spices.  That in itself would be a nice meal.\\n-\\nEggplant Parm:  We split it.  I don't even like eggplant but this was really good.  I didn't care for the lukewarm pasta though.  And it didn't come with enough sauce.  But the baked cheesy eggplant thing was really nice.\\n-\\nSo overall, not a fancy place, but the food and drinks are solid.

Their muqueca dishes are worth 5 stars, but other's didn't impress me as much.\\n\\nAmbiance:  Muqueca is a small restaurant with only about 10 tables.  The kitchen is open so you can see all of the chefs (mostly female) working in the back with their white hats bopping around.  In front of the kitchen is a counter where they have some of their desserts and cash register.  I think they can accomodate one large party (10+ people) at a time.  Luckily, I think you can more or less make a reservation.\\n\\nFood:  If you love seafood, fresh tomato, and cilantro, Muqueca is the place to go.  \\n\\nFor appetizer, I had their fried yucca.  It was not anything super special.\\n\\nSmoothies:  We oroder the pina colada and blue caju.  The pina colada is definitely the better of the two.  The blue caju was good but not out of this world.\\n\\nMuqueca:  This is the specialty of their restaurant and this is why you should come to this restaurant.  Served with a plate of rice, the muqueca comes in a  small iron(?) pot of sorts.  The main ingredients are the seafood of your choice, fresh tomatoes, onions, and cilantro.  The flavor is fresh and the dishes are well seasoned.  There's also a smaller bowl of sauce that's for your rice.  The flavor is similar to the muqueca but the sauce is definitely thicker.\\n\\nMariscada:  A hearty portion of shrimp, mussels, crab meat, calamari, the mariscada has a very similar flavor to the muqueca.  I think it tastes more like muqueca with more variety of seafood.  It also comes with a plate of rice and a side of plantain muqueca.  The plaintain muqueca was good but not as good as the seafood muqueca.  You also get fried yucca flour with this dish and you can put the yucca flour on top of your mariscada.  I was pretty full when I came to the restaurant but I just could NOT stop eating.  Luckily, I was able to share this dish with 2 other people (we were all pretty full).  I think you can definitely break this meal into two, so the $18.95 price tag isn't too bad.\\n\\nFried Plantains:  Sweet plantains that are deep fried to perfection.  Delicious but I don't think you can really mess up fried plantains though.\\n\\nService:  The service was good but nothing too special.  Allowing for reservations always makes it a plus for me at any restaurant."},{"name":"Number One Bento","address":"598 SW 10th","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"i waited for 20 minutes only to find they didn't make my order. and they didn't seem sorry about it either.

We ended up going for two sandwiches the blackened catfish po'boy and the pulled pork sandwich the catfish po'boy was a bit unpleasantly spicy - don't get me wrong I love spicy food but I feel like this spice was just layered on top of the catfish and just stuck to the roof of your mouth. Other than that, the catfish itself didn't have much flavor. As for the pulled pork, I was also pretty disappointed. I feel like the pork itself could have been marinated better and definitely could have had much more flavor. I may be a bit harsher when it comes to rating pulled pork since growing up in Miami I had some of the best pulled pork ever.

You're then let in and seated communally--not great for a romantic date. Naomi, in creating the restaurant of her dreams, seems to have ignored the needs of her diners. No front of house, no one asking how your food is, no one asking whether you want something else to drink--and no one to complain to when things go wrong. Our lamb loin chops were way oversalted, and on the first bite, my boyfriend got a piece of cartilage that he had to spit out. But you can't send anything back, or at least we couldn't figure out how to do it, since no one ever asked, and we would have had to complain in front of a table of ooh-ing and ahh-ing diners.

The line was out the door and around the corner, after all! \\n\\nI think it comes down to execution for me. The texture just wasn't right (too much fat perhaps?) and some of the flavors didn't shine like I hoped they would. I picked a couple to sample, and sadly I had to ask to sample a couple more because the ones I thought I would surely love just weren't very good. Not that the ice cream was outright terrible, but I think it could be improved - or maybe S&S just does it in a way that I'm unable to appreciate. \\n\\nWe each ended up getting a single-scoop combination of two flavors. The Meyer lemon chocolate sorbet actually was pretty tasty - a nicely done, sweet Meyer lemon (not regular, tangy lemon) followed by a very subtle chocolate that wasn't overly sweet or indulgent. The Arbequina olive oil was divine. If you love olive oil in and of itself, I would highly recommend this one. The coffee and bourbon was also well done - you could actually taste both flavors and neither one overpowered the other.\\n\\nI would return in the future and check out some of the other flavors if I happened to be in the area, but there are some other really good ice cream purveyors in town that I'd go to first simply because they hit the spot - Lovely's Fifty Fifty, to name one, along with the miso butterscotch gelato at Staccato Gelato (also served at Biwa)."},{"name":"Spider House Ballroom","address":"2906 Fruth St","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Music and ambience are good.

Since Peachtree Cafe, nothing has had much staying power in this nifty little spot in the heart of the \\"original\\" Buckhead. I was delighted to think that maybe a place with good food etc would have finally cornered the market here, so to speak - and even more hopeful when we walked in and I was immediately impressed by the cool vibe and swanky-but-not-too-much-so decor. \\n\\nAlas. \\n\\nThe best way to describe our experience is with the phrase \\"all over the map.\\" Or, in this case, the menu. By that I mean some of what we had was totally delicious (the tomato and mozz stack-like salad - yum!) and a huge portion that more than two could have easily shared; also, at maybe $5 this particular pick was a great one. Also yummy and generous in size was the soup of the day- a creamy tomato and shrimp bisque. The Boy and I shared both of these to get started, and were both very pleased. \\n\\nUnfortunately, the rest of the *map* wasn't similar in quality, quantity, or value. We decided to share the strip steak and fries, with a side of sauteed mushrooms. Totally \\"all over\\" the map! We're pretty sure the steak, as the boy can attest since he used to work for US Foods, was select meat/frozen/then thawed and, well, something even I could have made at home. It was not bad, it was just . . . meh. And for $19, it should have been much better, along with a bigger side of fries (I thought they were tasty, he didn't really, but we both agreed the serving was skimpy - and I rarely comment on serving size so this had to be noticeable enough that even I remarked on it). The mushrooms were a lovely mixed variety of schmancy types but, again, something either of us could've made at home - his version would be waaaay more flavorful, mine would be about like these were done - and for $7 we definitely should have gotten a serving bigger than a cup, cup and a half. Again - \\"meh. I've experienced better.\\" \\n\\nWe sat at the bar and our main bartender Tab (super nice and cute and btw, that's short for Tabitha, y'all, as apparently most people don't pick up on that according to her) was helpful enough . . . Though she definitely needs to work on her sales pitch for a few items - according to her, the calamari \\"is kinda bland. I mean, plain-tasting. Well (backtracking here) it is just a more simple taste than, say, the oysters so if that's your thing . . . (trailing off awkwardly)\\" Um, that pretty much talked us out of the calamari, something I'd been craving since our earlier lunch at Verde!! \\n\\nMore significantly to note, it took forever for our tomato salad - an uncooked app, as you'd expect - to arrive after she put in the order, then when I ordered our entree right when it did finally arrive, the steak et al came out like three minutes later. Which made us deduce that what the kitchen was doing was serving the two big parties (one group of a dozen or so lovely girls celebrating their bride-to-be friend, and then a slightly smaller group party at an adjacent table) and putting orders from any parties of 2, 3 or 4 on hold or somewhere less prioritized in the \\"line.\\" Annoying and a sign of poor (no?) management/supervision. This perception was enhanced - along with the douchebaggery quotient Kit F. mentioned- when we spied one of the owners blithely chatting up friends with a total attitude of \\"I'm just here to schmooze and have cocktails, I'm sure the restaurant will run itself.\\" Refer to Kit's other comments about the \\"Situation,\\" etc and you'll know exactly what this scene was like . . .or, as The Boy said, besides the bridal group, \\"Thursday night must've swallowed up all the good looking girls and left nothin' for Saturday.\\" That is, unless cheeseball guys and some cougars hanging on them are your thing. Yeah, that pretty much covers the *scene* at BBB. \\n\\n*Le (Aggravated) Sigh* Like I said, this is a place I'd love to love . . . but at least on first experience, there's not a special place in this girl's heart for the newest incarnation of this longtime Buckhead corner spot.

Shall we take a magical trip through this gorgeous scene of a place? \\n\\nAt first thought, we started our drive here only to realize just how far out from the city it actually was. After traversing the long winding roads, we rolled up onto this huge piece of land, seemingly old school and decorated as that of Schrute Farms, we felt like we  had just escaped the city. How is the parking you ask? Outdoor, unpaved, and rugged! Both available in the front and in the rear, kind of feels like a big family get together in the countryside. Most people I found to park in the front so that meant back parking for me to keep the car safe and enjoy a little more of a walk which was fine. \\n\\nThere are several farm houses scattered about, grouped, and sectioned so take time to explore. The main area, broken down with several buildings connected to a large open barn acting as the central social hub. On one side of this long stretch of barn, a huge open field, and a little building where you can go to choose a select number of their spontaneously fermented ales. Open a tab here and the tab will stay open throughout the other buildings where orders can be placed. On the other side of the open barn, another little building where one can go to select home made pizzas, and other beer foods to compliment your drink of choice. Separated by a path lined by flowers, you'll find yourself moving towards another wonderful section of the brewery, where you can go and sample more flavors of their unique ales. You also have an area to purchase merch to take home and rep around your town that YOU got to check this place out. What's enjoyable about this section is that its on the quieter side, away from the louder families and games. This is great for conversations with groups, and time to get to know your drink intimately on those beautiful summer evenings that Texas is known for. Breathe and relax while you're here, you deserve it.  \\n\\nWhat about prices? Expect that the food will be on the more expensive, and smaller side, while their drinks will be on the more reasonable end. This is as expected of any brewery in my opinion. They do offer discounts on select items so just double check if you're unsure. \\n\\nPlenty of things to see here and, to be honest, plenty for a family to enjoy as well. On the side of the barn with the open field, there are little games such as bean bag toss that people of every age can enjoy. The thing here that takes the cake for me, would have to be when they bring out the goats for feeding time. The most adorable site to see little goats being herded and then children and adults petting and walking among them. Peaceful and a much better alternative to the typical city brewery scene, what with the walls usually adorned with TVs and loud speakers, there are just the sounds of people laughing and conversing. The bringing together of people are what creates a community and its through communities that bonds are strengthened. At the end of the day, what I can say about Jester Kings Brewery, is that it is truly a unique experience that you cannot find just anywhere."},{"name":"Ty Ginger Asian Bistro","address":"5689 Woerner Temple Rd","city":"Dublin","stars":"4","text":"I have been here two times only, and so far is one of the best places I ever been, great price and excellent food quality and flavor, Teriyakis, Noddles, Soups, Entries, and one hell of a Salmon stuffed with crabb...

Located near some of the heavy hitters in the area like Watershed and down the street from Holeman and Finch, it can be easy to miss it. \\n\\nMy date took me here and it was a nice time. There was a \\"Monday Night Date Night\\" special going on, which we were both unaware about, so we took advantage of the $25 special. We each ordered a cocktail: him, a whiskey concoction (Whiskey Tango Foxtrot) while I ordered a gin cocktail \\"A Step in the Right Direction.\\" I was a huge fan of my cocktail - can't go wrong with gin and St. Germain's. \\n\\nWe took a while choosing our different apps and dishes, but ended up ordering small plates tapa style to share. We ordered:\\n\\nSalmon \\"poke\\" tacos - I don't know why they had to put \\"poke\\" in quotations - it was essentially poke, not \\"like\\" \\"poke\\". One of the highlights of the night were the salmon poke tacos, from the crispy taco shell to the salty salmon filling. Definitely a must order!\\nAhi Tuna Tartare - pretty tasty, although not on the level of the poke tacos. I liked the crunch of the peanuts and the spicy chili along with the miso aioli. A little different take on what should have been a typical dish.\\nFlash Fried Brussels - soooo good. But nothing I hadn't tried before. If you're struggling to find some veggies to go with your meal, you can never with fried veggies. \\nBurrata - this was probably the redheaded stepchild of the meal. It was just so much cheese and so little everything else. One or two bites was nice but more than that became annoying, but we couldn't get rid of it. Maybe avoid this one unless you want to be nursing a huge blob of cheese all night. \\nPan Roasted Scallops - omg. One of the best dishes of the night. $13 for a great small plate, with heavy garlic flavors that didn't overwhelm everything else. The seared scallops sat on a bed of farroto- and I'm a huge farro enthusiast.\\nCrispy Gulf Oysters - not bad. I've had better but this was still a tasty rendition. Not super memorable, though. \\nBlack Linguine - unexpectedly delicious. Even though we had made reservations at Boccalupo the next evening, we just had to. The linguine was perfectly al dente. Seafood was fresh. Everything was buttery and smooth. A great carb option, especially if you're still hungry, which we were stuffed at this point. \\n\\nWe couldn't resist ordering the S'mores bread pudding. Ok, more like I couldn't resist. It was rich and decadent and delicious. You can't go wrong with this one. I also decided to order the zeppolis, which were topped with rhubarb and brown butter crumble. I loved the crumble and the crunch of the rhubarb with bite of fried cinnamon dough. However, at the end of the dessert, I was left with a pile of rhubarb, which was not exactly my favorite on its own. Maybe a disproportion, but I felt bad leaving so much rhubarb on my plate. \\n\\nMy one thing is I couldn't get over how they charged us for our food. We ordered way too much food, thinking we would be able to use the $25 special for both of us - I mean, $50 for the 8 dishes we ordered was a steal (with the black linguine as an extra order). However, since our server didn't explain the Monday Night Date Night special to us properly, we were charged for each dish a la carte. Even after pointing it out to him, he ended up still charging 4 of the dishes we ordered a la carte. If there could be more of a standard menu to choose from, it would be more helpful and less confusing for Saltyard noobs like us. \\n\\nWe ordered way too much food - but hey, that's the \\"SOML\\" of a true Yelper."},{"name":"Flatiron Restaurant & Bar","address":"520 Flat Shoals Ave SE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3.5","text":"I so wanted to give this place a 5.

I really like the cheese plate, the gnocchi and the scallops. The scallops were especially excellent. The lamb chops and green beans were also winners. My least favorite was probably the deviled eggs, but it just may be that they're served in lots of other places and I've had better. As for service, while the manager was spot on, the servers seemed frazzled. Everyone was very apologetic and we got it, but the bottom line is when you are apologized to 3-4 times but service is still frazzled, well, service is still frazzled. But what really did it for me was that when we asked for more bread for the cheese plate (they gave us three anemic, paper thin circles of toast), they brought us, 15 minutes later, three more anemic, paper thin circles of toast and, above it all, we were charged for it. Sure it was only $2, but we were still charged for bread that should have come with our order to begin with. This kind of nickel and dime'ing just doesn't sit well with me. I hope they change this policy, and in fact go beyond that and just bring everyone a bread basket with their cheese plate.

We were pretty soaked from the rain (you'd think we'd know by now that just because it isn't raining when we leave the house doesn't mean it won't start 15 minutes later!) but entered into a warm inviting environment.  There were only a few other patrons there, a few cooks playing under the hood and the bartender, of course.  I only had bourbon on the rocks, but my friend had the A Traversiamo, a nice delicately mellow martini.  Robert, our bartender was engaging, friendly and sharply put together, not blinking an eye to our somewhat crass conversation.  Feeling all warmed up from our drinks we decided to see what those chefs could do so we ordered a fritto misto to split.

I love the vibe of this place and the servers are so incredibly pleasant. Let's cut to the chase: The shakshuka is one of the most satisfying breakfasts I've had. It's a Middle Eastern or North African dish, a stew with tomatoes, eggs, and other spices. You have to order this for breakfast. And definitely add the mergeuz sausage. There is no better way to jump start your morning than to have your taste buds dancing first thing in the morning. This stew is so amazingly flavorful. Tasty and with a kick. They know it; it's no coincidence they give you four huge pieces of bread to help mop up the thing. When you first start, you think it's an impossible task to finish. But then you finish. Satisfied is too weak a word. It's filling but by no means do you feel disgustingly full. After I had this I was rejuvenated and excited. \\"I have this several times a week,\\" my server told me. Yet she was still drooling over my dish. No kidding. If I lived in Portland, I can't say I wouldn't do the same.

The board also came with just one (big hunk) of cheese, which I knew when I ordered and was tasty, but having just one cheese isn't that interesting as compared to a typical board that comes with three. In sharp contrast to the lack of fruit and nuts, there was a big pile of bread on one side of the board.

I typically spring for a single scoop of gelato in a waffle cone for $4.75.  Once you pre-pay, you hand your receipt to the employee behind the gelato, who will then prepare your gelato.  I prefer the token system at La Casa Gelato compared to the receipt system personally, but it gets the same result.  \\n\\nNow the important part, the gelato.  Mario's Gelati has a pretty decent selection of flavors, ranging from fruit sorbetto's to decadent gelato.  All of the gelato is made with all natural ingredients, which is a huge plus.  I absolutely LOVE their green tea gelato, it's the best I've ever had, hands down.

My husband and I used to get our favorite pizza there religiously until we had two, maybe three VERY unpleasant interactions with whoever answered the phone to take our \\"to-go\\" order. \\n\\nThe first time, my husband called in while we had family visiting from out of town. He preceded the conversation with a disclaimer that it would be a big order. He ordered several pizzas and when informed of the wait time, he said he'd have to cancel it. The guy on the phone scoffed in annoyance and hung up the phone. Sure, maybe that's annoying for a small business, but there is certainly a better way to respond being a grown adult and all.\\n\\nThe second time, my husband called in our usual order (of a SINGLE pizza) to be picked up. Upon requesting our usual, the same guy who had answered the previous call, says they don't make it anymore. My husband asked if we could still order it anyway as a custom order. The guy responds by asking him what was on it. My husband tells him. He asks what kind of cheese. My husband can't remember. Again, he was met with a snide remark when my husband bailed on the order because the guy who works there was completely uncooperative or helpful.\\n\\nSo, if I had written this review a year ago, I would have raved about our favorite pizza and the service we got when we ate there (the wait staff were always very kind).\\nHowever, we will likely never eat there again because feeling like chumps when trying to support someone's business is extremely off-putting."},{"name":"49 Social","address":"49 Temple Pl","city":"Boston","stars":"3","text":"The decor here is really beautiful: exposed brick, wrought iron balcony, chandeliers, comfy bar chairs.

The second drink the boy had was a Stone IPA because they were out of what he had originally wanted, and he said it tasted skunked.

The vivisection:\\n\\nWhen we arrived, we walked in and then stood helplessly in front of the pastry cooler, eyeing the central register and the menus. Was this place an order-at-the-counter setup? Seat ourselves? There was no hostess stand, nor even a \\"please seat yourself\\" sign. After a good five minutes of standing there, having everyone in the crowded restaurant shoot us questioning looks, a busy waiter/cashier/busboy looked up and pointed in the general direction of the floor and told us to be seated, anywhere.\\n\\nOnce seated, we could barely hear each other. The noise level in Primizie is ridiculous and could be easily dampened with a few drapes or padded wall sections. Not at all acceptable for a date, or for going out with friends to socialize. If I wanted to yell, I'd go to Trudy's.\\n\\nOur waitress was nice enough, as I've said, but service was SLOW. During our meal, we watched her (1) serve tables all across the restaurant floor, (2) prepare mixed drinks at the bar, even though there seemed to be a bartender, (3) clear plates from the diners at the bar, (4) open wine bottles at the bar, and fetch bottles from the back area, (5) enter the semi-open kitchen and (6) try to not collide with the four other waitresses doing the exact same thing. There is no clear sign of delegation or order. We'd see a chef emerge from the kitchen and bring orders to the table, or even a spare fork. We'd see the \\"bartender\\" disappear for long minutes, only to abandon his supposed duties to his wait staff. No restaurant can be run like this, especially on a busy night.\\n\\nOur food. The daily soup was salted beyond recognition. No kitchen can send out food that salty, and if they aren't tasting their daily soup, who knows what else is getting botched. The pasta gnocchi dish arrived with acres of red chili pepper flakes, without warning. If I'd wanted Thai food, I would have gone to Madam Mam's. Spicy dishes need little peppers, the words \\"spicy\\" or \\"hot\\", or maybe just a caveat on the menu about being a Real Texan Establishment. At an Italian bistro, I expect to be lulled by heavy cream and herbs -- not by lip searing handfuls of chili pepper. The Tagliatelle alla Bolognese comes with high-end Italian sausage. When you order a dish like this, you hope that all that delicious fat renders into your sauce, creating something savory and rich. At Primizie, the chefs smothered this dish with olive oil, creating instead a mine field of orange grease, like you'd see at Chuckee Cheese. Simple ingredients can speak for themselves, and chefs who throw olive oil onto every plate are wasting money and these ingredients. We're betting it was the Salty Souper.\\n\\nReady for more? The pasta isn't fresh. Boxes of De Cecco pasta are piled atop the reach-in fridge, plainly visible from the front door and from most parts of the dining area. \\n\\nAfter having our meal draw out for almost 2 hours, we were ready to leave. No dessert, no thank you. Primizie has high hopes, but by failing to accurately describe their dishes on the menu, failing to cook them with a steady hand, and failing to run an efficient restaurant, they have a lot of work ahead of them if they hope to succeed in the long run."},{"name":"Bistro Wagon Rouge","address":"1869 Powell Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4","text":"Wonderful french cuisine.

With eight of us going out for dinner, six of us from out of state, it was left to the discretion of our hosts as to the spot in which to indulge our out-of-town tastebuds.\\n\\nType of cuisine: A Portland Neighborhood Restaurant boasting a regularly changing menu, based on seasonal variations, local farmers' produce, and the kitchen crew's inspiration, the aim at Tasty n Sons is to impress, not one item on the Southern comfort food inspired menu worth throwing out with the bath water.\\n\\nAmbiance: One feels a sense of warmth and cozy, down-home comfort from the moment of entry. From the coat rack alongside the entry staircase, to the dim lighting and the red-painted concrete walls uniformly decorated with matching artwork and simple shelving, to the wooden and full bar space, one is immediately set at ease in the space. This is the type of restaurant where you imagine everyone knows your name, the patrons greet each other lovingly, and neighboring diners are eager to tell you all about their tasty dishes. Sit back, relax and make yourself at home. Everyone else will.\\n\\nWhat I ordered: To start, our table was offered bread and butter, which was quickly consumed. Drinks arrived and it was then time for the glorious entrees. Among the items I was not privy to: Griddled Bacon Wrapped Date with maple syrup & almond ($2). At the suggestion of our server, and being interested in something smaller, I opted for the Bambino Plate with scrambled eggs, bacon, biscuit & honey butter ($7). We had two orders of the Tasty Burger with house bacon, beecher's cheddar or smoked bleu cheese* ($11), one of the Spaghettini Carbonara with house guanciale* ($14), and one Shrimp n Grits ($17). My husband surprised me and ordered the Grilled Octopus fra diavolo ($15)! A table favorite was the Spicy Smoked BBQ Ribs ($16/$28), (not to mention the sweet presentation of complimentary hand-cloths) while the side of Brussels Sprouts ($7) became their own show-stopper.  For our desserts, despite feelings of being over-stuffed, our table devoured the Warm Chocolate Chip Cookies baked to order with vanilla ice cream ($7), warm Ginger Cookies baked to order with earl grey ice cream ($7), Auntie Paula's French Toast Sundae with bananas, caramel & walnuts ($8), one Samoa Sundae ($7), and Chocolate Potato Doughnuts with cr√®me anglaise  ($1.50 ea) for good measure.\\n\\nWhat I loved: In this order: Brussels sprouts, octopus, ribs and shrimp n grits coming in tied for third.\\n\\nWhy I loved it: No words.

Sometimes, I dream about it. The thing is, I'm pretty particular about what constitutes good falafel. Al Koura exceeds these particulars and advances itself to great falafel. I have been dying to try this place since the day we moved to Westwood(literally that day) in July and the menu was dropped off on our front door. My biggest mistake--waiting this long to try it. \\n\\nTonight was a night when my husband had other dinner plans that did not include me. As I drove home from work, my mind weighted all of the many options available on Rt 1 for takeout. All I could bring myself to think about is the delicious, crunchy, golden balls of falafel deliciousness. Thus, I found myself waiting as I watched my meal being fried fresh at approximately 5:45 this evening. By 6:20, I was shamefully looking at the near empty takeout box, sad only in that there was no more falafel for later. \\n\\nTheir hummus is garlicky and slightly lemony while the tahini sauce has just the right amount of nuttiness. Combined with the light and fresh pita, it was quite simply blissful. I ordered the falafel hummus combo plate and a side of tabouleh and could not have been happier. The plate came with hummus, 6 huge falafels, pickles, tomato, and pita--the perfect combination when all rolled into the pita. The falafel is a flattened ball shape and so crunchy and delicious on the outside with the perfect chewy chickpea inside. Many times falafel falls short in that it is overly greasy, lacking flavor, or just too mushy--Al Koura has none of these problems. I would put them on par with Rami's in Brookline for fried balls of chickpea perfection. The tabouleh is more parsley than wheat-- if you are expecting it to look like the preserved premade stuff from the grocery store, you may be disappointed, however if you are looking for authentic, lemony-parsley salad with tomato, you cannot go wrong. I think I could eat this by itself with a spoon. \\n\\nThe restaurant itself is small as is its equally delicious neighbor, Thai Thani. It amazes me to think that both of these gems are hidden in the same little strip in Norwood. Despite the size of the place, the food packs such a punch you would be a fool to let this deter you from trying this place out. \\n\\nI highly recommend this restaurant to anyone wanting a change of pace from the multitude of corporate owned chain restaurants.

I think its safe to say he won't be coming here anymore. The waitress did not have our table cleaned as someone was just sitting there prior to our arrival. She said,\\"they only had drinks so the table is not dirty, there was no food on there so I don't have to clean it\\". The food was subpar and the customer service was the worst I've experienced in years. My food was lukewarm when it arrived after taking an extremely long time to get to me. I paid extra for white meat, and somehow received a leg and a thigh, which to my knowledge is not white meat. I told them that and they tried to convince me that it was so I just pushed it to the side and did not eat it. Mind you I am from the Caribbean myself so I know what good Jamaican food taste like. The rice and peas taste like it was sitting out all day and it was sticky which is NOT GOOD. The cabbage was bland. Our waiter did not even bring out our food someone else did, with no utensils I may add. The waiter did not show up until the end of the meal to ask if we are ready for the check. Mind you during the time of the meal my boyfriend had to ask someone else to bring us a drink because our waitress was no where to be found. When she brought our check she was surprised we had an additional drink. When she brought our check and I told her how the food was not good, she did nothing to rectify the situation and did not even consult her manager. It took us 30 minutes after getting our check to actually leave because it took her that long to pick up the check and bring it back.

We somewhat accomplished this having called in a reservation beforehand. Upon first glance my immediate thoughts were as follows:\\n-Crowded parking lot; we had to park around the back by the trash bins....busy parking lot is a good sign though, right?\\n-Meh seating; we ended up at the high-tops that somehow make you feel like you are on display to the lower tables around you. Somewhat unfortunate since we called in early and asked for a good spot somewhere quiet. But maybe I'm just being picky. \\n\\nOverall the staff we interacted with was very nice if not a bit overly friendly and helpful. Our waiter was training new staff and did a thorough job explaining the menu and their restaurant to us, seeing as it was our first time there. And after getting the full rundown, I ordered one of their signature cocktails and my husband ordered their house-made brew. We then ordered an appetizer and our entrees. \\n\\nOkay so now we've reached the food and drink review part. However, I have to warn you about our slightly biased review. After having a few unimpressed sips from his beer, my husband began to have an allergic reaction which progressively got worst over the next 45 minutes we were there. At the point where we had decided to take our food packages and pay our bill, we had already eaten our appetizer, pimento cheese spread with a ham jam (4/5) and I had slightly sipped on my cocktail which I'm unsure of the name other than it had a super strong licorice taste (1/5). I'm not rating the beer as I'm sure most people wouldn't have had the same reaction as my husband did. The waiter was kind enough to comp the beer and helped us get out of there as quickly as possible. Upon returning home, we did eat the no-longer-warm entrees and side and reviews are as follows:\\n\\nSteak: meat itself was perfectly cooked and very great quality. Flavoring was so-so and sauce was off in some way. (3.5/5)\\n\\nWreakfish: the fish itself was perfect and I felt that the flavor combination was really good. No real complaints. (4.5/5)\\n\\nBrussels Sprouts: the flavoring was okay. Pretty unique. But they had a strong burned flavor that spoiled the flavoring. 2/5\\n\\nOverall, The Cask and Larder was a good restaurant with knowledgable staff and a passion for food much like their sister restaurant, the ravenous pig (Amazing!!). But after having a less than pleasurable first visit mixed with food that was good, but not near worth the 105$ we spent for two people. I don't usually expect to pay that much and eat leftovers from cardboard boxes from home (haha)\\n\\nI'd say as a restaurant, the Cask and Larder is a 2.5/5.

I work at WeWork Domain and they just catered a lunch for us and WOW. I could easily eat there every single day. Today they had a buffet style of food to try and I would like a repeat of everything please. \\n\\nFirst they had a their kale salad, and it was easily the best kale salad of my life. Its a combination of shredded kale, (Which is so much nicer than big huge pieces), grapefruit, white cheddar, almonds, black currant, and apple cider vinaigrette. Obviously this was catered and free so I am not one to complain, but when I go to the restaurant I will def be getting the dressing on the side. \\n\\nThey had the flying avocado wrap as well, and it was the perfect bite to accompany the salad and fresh veggies with avocado hummus. The rebel wrap was easily my favorite thing though. Grass fed steak, charred onions, cheese and a horseradish yogurt sauce it just melted into a burst of flavors in your mouth. I demolished my plate and felt so happy and full, yet not needing to take a nap after. \\n\\nI highly recommend eating here, I know it will easily be my new favorite lunch spot! :)"},{"name":"China Hut","address":"16721 SE Division St","city":"Portland","stars":"2","text":"It was okay wasn't nothing to write home about but what I would like to know is how the hell do you get a receipt"},{"name":"Talita's","address":"2700 N High St","city":"Columbus","stars":"2.5","text":"Noticed this place when it opened a few weeks ago in our neighborhood and decided to give it a try.

There are dozens of other Mexican places in Columbus with more varied menus. \\n\\nThe food itself is neither fresh nor flavorful. The nachos were stale. The guacamole and salsa had little taste. As for my enchiladas, I had to dig through an enormous layer of melted cheese before finding one of the most plain enchiladas I've ever eaten. \\n\\nI know tacos and enchiladas aren't supposed to be the healthiest food option, but I've felt better after eating at Taco Bell.\\n\\nOverall, I'm glad to say I tried it, but I don't see myself going here again.

They were spicy and delicious. After that we finished with the beignets, a very delicious way to end an excellent meal. Our bartender's name was Sean and he was great, very personable, and fun to talk to.

Line out the door on a chilly Monday night, but the line moves pretty well. Servers are very liberal in letting us try as many flavors as we liked. I settled on the split one scoop with Olive Oil and Almond Brittle with Salted Ganache.  Generous portion (I felt like it was more like two scoops instead of a split one scoop) with the delicious waffle cone.

The menu is simple and straight forward but the interior of the restaurant is too spartan, some pictures on the wall or additional decorations would help.

I'm very happy that this is a successful local business that isn't focused on coffee or beer- variety is the spice of life and all that. \\n\\nThis review is of their scoop shop on NE Alberta.\\n\\nSo I had the cinnamon snickerdoodle and chocolate with gooey brownies. The chocolate one was tasty, but actually fairly pedestrian. I adored the cinnamon snickerdoodle which had delightfully large chunks of cookie in it. I didn't sample some of the other more exotic flavors, but when I go next time, I'll definitely try the coffee bourbon and meyer lemon chocolate sorbet. The waffle cone was newly from the oven, noted to me by the friendly staff. I was there on a Tuesday night at 7:15, and when I left around 8:00, there was a line out the door! I was so happy for them. I can't imagine what kind of foot traffic they get during summer.\\n\\nThe space itself was open and airy- and as someone who is car-less, they are super-easy to get to by bus.

And after checking up on some reviews on Yelp we decided on Tasty N' Sons for breakfast. \\n\\nUpon arrival we noticed that even though it was a Friday morning at 10:45, the place was PACKED! However, we had to wait maybe 5 minutes for a table and were seated by a friendly and welcoming hostess. And even though she was extremely busy, she took the time to explain their menu and quickly brought us our drinks. The atmosphere is a contemporary warehouse feel, but also is very homey with the large tables seating multiple groups together. Or you can choose to sit at their breakfast bar, their bar bar or have your own individual tables. \\n\\nThe place specialized in tapas style breakfast food, something that I have never experienced before. Sadly, our eyes were bigger than our stomachs and we ordered way too much food, but oh my goodness was it delicious!\\n\\nI would highly recommend getting their chocolate donuts with the vanilla sauce, they tasted like they had just come out of the fryer. Both donut holes were fluffy and crispy, DELICIOUS! We then ordered the polenta with a ragu sauce and a poached egg on top. I have to say that I could eat that every single day and never get tired of it. It is far and away one of the best things I have ever eaten for breakfast. The polenta was creamy and flavorful, however, the ragu was the real star. The sauce was zesty and a little spicy and paired deliciously with the polenta and the perfectly cooked egg. We also ordered the hash with the horseradish cream which was also wonderful. Then we got the bambino scramble with a fresh homemade biscuit with a wonderful honey butter and fresh strawberry jam. \\n\\nOverall, if you're in Portland and are looking for a breakfast place you MUST go to Tasty N Sons, you absolutely will not regret it. I would just make sure you make a reservation as their reputation precedes them!"},{"name":"Tasty n Sons","address":"3808 N Williams Ave, Ste C, Hub Building","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"Good for brunches.

I was delighted to find a restaurant in the Boston area that served this after having devoured many delicious muquecas in other cities. \\n\\nThe fish and shrimp muqueca is a must-try. Rich, tomato-y broth, fresh seafood, all combine to give incredible flavors, especially when eaten with farofa, the delicious toasted flour they serve as an accompaniment. (I was inhaling the farofa like cocaine by the end.) I adore the mariscada, a stew consisting of shrimp, crabmeat, mussels & squid with cilantro, tomato, onion & coconut milk. There's something about the combination of tomatoes, onions and coconut milk that is absolutely divine.\\n\\nIf you hate cilantro, the muquecas might not be for you. We specifically asked for the removal of cilantro for one of our party, and they either didn't remember or couldn't do that as I think the broth is prepared with cilantro already in it. For a cilantro-free alternative, try the Feijoada Completal, Brazil's national dish, which is diced meat cooked with black beans and served with collard greens, farofa, fried plantains and of all things, orange slices. Our cilantro-hater loved it.\\n\\nThe service is spotty, however, and the reason for docking one star. This is not a place to grab a quick bite, nor do they really go out of their way to perform anything more than perfunctory service. Nothing bad--no attitude or anything. Just rather brusque and cold service, with extended periods of wait time. Plus, they had a tendency to forget our requests like more water.\\n\\nAll in all, definitely worth a stop if you're in Inman Square on a cold night."},{"name":"ArtEpicure Cooking School","address":"1 Fitchburg St","city":"Somerville","stars":"5","text":"Tonight my friend and I attended the chocolate class thanks to our Groupons.
