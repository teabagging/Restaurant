Old school Austinites will recall this space was home to the original Angie's (excellent puffy tacos) location.  Gabriella's moves that tradition of killer Tex Mex into the 21st century in all the right ways.  Al Pastor tacos featured tender, marinated big cubes of pork goodness prepared with skill in estilo tipico.  The basics done perfecto with homemade corn tortillas, limes, cebolla, and cilantro.  Chicken Doradas (flautas) shine with shredded well seasoned moist chicken cooked just crisp enough and all smothered under mega-sabor chopped red cabbage, pickled red onions, cilantro, crumbled queso fresca, and drizzled with crema.  Both came with rrrreally good arroz and borracho beans.  Street elote appetizer had big carved fresh off the cob sections (not just kernels)and all the right classic ingredients.  Great horchata further enhanced by the fact the menu advertises one refill.  Nice!  Server and staff super kind and on the ball working together as a team.  A/C cold like you want it on a blazing summer day.  Cool phases of the moon wall paper.  It's a small space inside and it's a great restaurant so it's crowded and it's LOUD.  No intimate conversations but everyone is having a good time.  Outdoor patio was crowded with folks not bothered by 100 degrees but that heat ain't for me.

There's also nice benches out front and the center of Ladd's Addition in front of the cafe sometimes has an old-time music circle going. At the very least, it has grass and space for people to hang out w/ coffee, etc. \\n\\nBUT Palio has no A/C and can get very hot sometimes. AND the brewed coffee is weak -- definitely weaker than it should be brewed. (I actually walk an extra mile to the Ford Building coffeeshop because the brewed coffee there is better. And less expensive. And yes, the staff are friendlier at the Ford Bldg too. And the Ford building is better lit overall for reading and writing. )a\\n\\nIt is also true that the place can be too uptight about customers not paying enough for their seats/tables. The worst thing I witnessed -- by far -- was when a group of 4 or 5 people arrived toward the end of the night, clearly there to visit and share a dessert or two -- but when the server saw that they were going to -- god forbid -- SHARE just one or two desserts and drink self-service water (and maybe buy a drink or two, I don't recall), the server went to the table, told them to buy more or leave. They ended up leaving. \\n\\nYet a single person could have sat at the same table, ordered the same thing, and not had any problem. Moreover, it was 10pm or later, and the place had empty seats and tables, and the number of vacant spaces were only going to increase. \\n\\nHonestly, I think the group was discriminated against partly due to their looks & high energy (but they were NOT intoxicated or loud or distracting). They were, however, a group of tightly-knit friends w/ their own fashion and interests, and it wasn't your typical Portland hipster/barrista thing. Think maybe very long-haired, hippie/beatnik types who might also be into theater & drama. If that makes any sense. \\n\\nAs soon as they entered and sat down -- and yes, they took a seat before any of them went to the counter to place an order -- the server was paying very close attention to them, and did not seem to want them around. But nobody else appeared bothered. In fact, I think the few other people still there in that room that night were surprised at the server's rude behavior and his insistence that they pay, I'm guessing, $12-24, instead of, say, $6-8. (A slice of cake runs $5 or more, as a recall. Though I've not bought it for a long time.)\\n\\nI don't normally write reviews. But the weak coffee has bothered me for a long time. And I thought it was outrageous that the server told a group of 4 or so people at the end of a night that they could not all share a dessert.  \\n\\nGenerally, in my experience, there's no problem getting a coffee and spending 2-3 hours working there. I've seldom paid more than $2.50 or so. And never been harassed about it. \\n\\n(Quite a few people do order more, however, and their savory menu items are often sold out or mostly sold out later in the day.

After the movie they'd decided to try and find a good Mexican restaurant for dinner and set off with an iPhone to find one. Ranch 616 came up. It sounded good so we decided to catch a cab and head that way. \\n\\nOur cab driver had heard of the place, but thought it was French, we think due to serving frog legs, which was the only thing he really knew about the place, but we're not sure. We decide to try it out anyway and get there (was close enough we should of walked) and there's a big-ass snake on the side of the building made out of ducting. That was enough to sell me on the place so we head inside. We were greeted and quickly informed that on weekend nights they're pretty much reservation only, but he asked us if we were from out of town and after we answered yes, he said he's see what he could do. We headed over to the bar where there were 2 seats open, 3 of us. The guys on either side of us started talking to us, while they're eating, and said we should definitely stick around that it was worth the wait. Another seat quickly opened up and we decided to eat at the bar as the people had been friendly and the menu/food looked good. \\n\\nWe shared a frog leg appetizer, after the cab drivers mention how could we not. I order the mixed grill special and my friends ordered the fish tacos and chicken fried tenderloin (I think.) The food was ok, pretty high prices, substantial portions so I was ok with that, but tastes wise it was just OK. Kind of a let down for me, b/c the place and people were great. Anyway, four stars b/c it was a fun evening and cool place, but the food was more 3 1/2 star."},{"name":"Random Order Pie Bar","address":"1800 NE Alberta St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Their chocolate cream pies are really good when they're good, and really disappointing when they're not. \\n\\nMaybe one out of two times, there is less chocolate pastry cream in the chocolate cream pie than there is whipped cream on top.

The first time this happened, I brought the slice back to them (completely uneaten) and asked them for another slice that had more chocolate in it thinking it must have been a mistake. \\n\\nThe woman at the cash register had attitude about replacing my slice. \\"Oooohhhkaaaaay I guess....\\" The description is chocolate cream pie with whipped cream!

We arrived on Saturday at roughly 10 pm. The place was very lively and probably 80% full. We were greeted by a friendly woman who seated us immediately and got us chips, salsa & drinks. After looking over the menu we decided to order a chicken burrito & an order of carnitas tacos to share. Food came out in about 15 minutes. We both loved the carnitas tacos! They were so well seasoned and very fresh. The rice & refried beans that came with them were also very tasty. The burrito was unlike any we've ever had though. It was more like an enchilada. It was smothered in sauce & cheese. We split it in half and ate it with forks. I was expecting a regular burrito. The one here was not terrible (it had guacamole without having to pay extra which is always A-OK in my book!) but I probably wouldn't order one again because it was a different style than I'm used to. I would absolutely consider going back here to try other menu items and get more carnitas tacos! Overall the experience was nice. The decor here is beautiful, they had live music and singers playing loud (but we liked it!) The waitress was very attentive and friendly.

They were fresh, tasty, and enjoyable.  Though the server didn't tell us which was which (we'd ordered two different kinds)  We asked and she found out, but that was a bit silly.  Why not just come to the table prepared to tell us?  Also, we were overcharged for the oysters bc we got 3 and 3.  So we didn't get the half-dozen pricing, even though individually, the two types of oysters were priced the same.\\n\\nBeer.  Brought to the table in a bottle.  When we asked for a glass, we were brought a water glass, not a cold beer glass.  Yep, super fancy. \\n\\nScrod.  The fish itself was fine.  A little fishy, but not inedible.  A generous serving.  The rice it was served with had a mexican flavor profile.  An awful fit for the butter, cracker, parsley vibe of the fish.  And most egregious - the veg was straight out of a freezer bag into a chafing dish, where it must have sat for three hours before being plopped on my plate.  It was a pile of disgusting, butter-soaked mush.  When the server rudely commented \\"I guess you don't like vegetables\\" as she took my plate, I responded in my most friendly voice that nope, I don't like frozen bagged vegetables that are so overcooked they're disgusting.  She didn't respond.  \\n\\nFish and chips.  The fish was fresh.  It was breaded not battered, which was odd but fine.  The fries tasted like they were from a snackbar somewhere.  Frozen Oreida style.  Again, fine for a cheap meal, but when you're charging more and claiming to be upscale, at least cut and cook your own freaking potatoes.\\n\\nWe asked for the check and it came pretty quickly, along with a \\"it was nice meeting you guys\\" from the server.  We put our card down and waited.  And waited and waited and waited.  The hostess came over and without saying anything, reached across the table to light a candle.  She didn't bother to ask us how our meal had been.  She didn't bother to take our clearly visible credit card.  So we waited some more.  And some more and some more.  Finally our server came and took the check without a word.  She brought the receipt in silence too.  I guess we'd already said our goodbyes, and she was no longer interested in pleasantries.\\n\\nAll in all, it was just a bad meal and we won't go back.

The food is the same and much cheaper.\\n\\nGave 2 stars for the large seating area and the attractive wait staff.  Aside from that, the food is horrid.  I went here on one occasion and the Burrito I ordered tasted like the Chef defecated on a cardboard box, threw some beans and cheese on it and served it up.  I figured maybe it was just this one time I ordered the wrong thing and planned on going again before I put my review in.\\n\\nNevertheless, I went a 2nd time and ordered the taco plate.  How can they screw this up?  Well, the Chef served the taco plate up in those pre-made taco shells (same ones from Taco Bell) threw ground beef in it, 3 slivers of cheese, burnt side of beans and charged me $12.00.  I took 2-3 bites, couldn't stomach it anymore so I just ate 3 baskets of chips to fill up and get my moneys worth.\\n\\nIn summary, they are over priced for the horrible food.

I had a bad experience in the one by the Mall of Millenia, and a rather slow service in the one by Winter Park Village. But the Altamonte Springs location has been good to me so far.\\n\\nThe wait can be horrendously long during the weekends, but that is to be expected.

The atmosphere reads upscale casual, but in no was is it pretentious. There's bar and high-top seating in the back front room, and plenty of tables in the adjoining room. Each table is draped in brown paper to give some of that gastropub vibe, while the food is all presented in a modern form. \\n\\nI ordered their Spring Vegetable Salad with added Mahi (asparagus, english peas, fava beans, heirloom carrots, local radish, minted yogurt, green garlic agrodolce, frisee). The presentation was beautiful, but I will say, unless you add a protein option to the salad, it is on the rather small scale. But, what it lacks in bulk, it certainly makes up in flavor. The Mahi was tender, light, and almost had a bit of a smoky flavor. The salad itself is dressed in a very light vinaigrette, a little peppery, adding to the caramelization of the roasted veggies."},{"name":"Bull McCabe's Pub","address":"366A Somerville Ave","city":"Somerville","stars":"4.5","text":"Bull McCabes has great music, good drink and a fun staff.

I don't remember a lot of details due to the amount of alcohol imbibed, but I know I had the pub burger, and I remember it being absolutely delicious. I also remember everyone raving about their food.\\n\\nMy second visit (this one, without my wife) was for one of the pig roasts. For $20, you get a small plate of ribs, collard greens, some black eyed peas, a piece of cornbread, a small dessert and a choice of beer or soda. A pretty great deal - but the ribs are a little on the small side. I know it's kind of implied being a pig roast - but there is no alternative option for non-meat-eaters. I'm not sure the kitchen is serving anything else during the roasts.\\n\\nOur visit last night was a belated birthday dinner for myself. They're closed on Sunday and Monday, so we had to put off dinner there until they were open. I asked a friend who dines there regularly if he thought I needed reservations for a weeknight. He said no. He was wrong. \\n\\nWe showed up at about 7pm. The hostess told us the dining room was booked until 8:30pm, but we could sit at the open seating bar and still eat off the full menu. There were, however, no seats left. We stood at the side for a few moments deciding what to do. I guess the hostess saw how dejected we looked and took pity on us. She squeezed us in at a small table.\\n\\nThe menu changes from time to time, but they seem to have at least a few items that are mainstays. While I loved the burger before, I wanted to try something different. I went with the steak frites, while my wife got the swordfish.  Of course, we started off with the gruyere biscuits and ordered a couple of drinks to go with it all. I had a \\"Old Fashioned\\" which is a bacon infused bourbon with a bacon garnish. My wife ordered a bloody mary, which our waitress said was very tomatoe-y and made with some sort of pickled fruit.\\n\\nThe \\"Old Fashioned\\" was good, tasting mostly of the orange. The bloody mary - not so good. The waitress said, when she brought it, that it seemed to have been made different tonight. Barely any tomato taste and woefully unseasoned. The biscuits were extra cheesey though - and delicious.\\n\\nOur entrees arrived. They looked fabulous. The steak was cooked perfectly and tasted great. The truffle fries were a bit salty, but we still could have eaten another order of them. My wife enjoyed her swordfish, but felt there were too many vegetables for the plate. A manager walking by asked her for her thoughts as it was a new dish and they were still testing it.\\n\\nWe didn't order dessert, but as we paid, the waitress said not to go anywhere, and returned with two half-bite size morsels of dessert - a peanut butter brownie. \\n\\nSo, if everything was so great - why only 4 stars? I debated this for a long time last night - and the fact is that while it's all delicious and the service is great, it still feels expensive for what you get. Our bill came out to $80 last night, and to be honest - I was still hungry. Yes, we could have eaten and drank cheaper there (get well drinks instead of signature cocktails, get burgers or pasta instead of fish and steak), but if I get a steak that costs almost $30, I only want to be left wanting more because it was so great - not because it wasn't enough food."},{"name":"Cafe Canela","address":"9070 Research Blvd, Ste 303","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"We visit Cafe Canela very regularly and the food is ALWAYS great.

It's the best Mexican food I have ever had--I don't typically even like most Mexican food, whereas I love this place! They focus on fresh, local ingredients and their food is cooked in a traditional way from their region of Mexico: amazing roasted potatoes, fish tacos with just a sprinkling of cheese, lots of delicious veggies, cooked cactus, corn tortillas handmade from fresh masa, etc. Abundant handmade nachos are brought out as a free appetizer, and are served with a special, delicious salsa that they also sell in mason jars. And they serve great beer from a local company called La Familia whose proceeds partly benefit Portand-area immigrant communities.\\n\\nI have many dietary restrictions, so it's often hard to find things I can eat, but there are various things on Conin's menu that I love. My restrictions are no gluten, dairy, or sugar/sweeteners; to others with similar diets, I highly recommend the fish tacos with guacamole substituted for the cheese and cream. I'm also able to eat the salsa, which isn't too spicy and which I love; and the side dish of roasted potatoes that come with several entrees are a must-have.\\n\\nAlong with the quality of Conin's food, their service is also great. Staff are friendly, and Ivan, the owner, is often around and sometimes comes to check on people and chat. The ambiance is casual--a TV playing Mexican channels, a bar, and music creating a din just right for conversation.

Service was great and food arrived promptly. We got several baskets of free bread with olive oil/spices. What we ordered:\\n\\n1. Olive plate- didn't try, as I don't like olives\\n2. Cheese plate- had several varieties of cheese as well as some yummy jam. Only complaint was that it only came with 3 crackers/toasts, but we had plenty of free bread to use instead. \\n3. Beet/arugula/goat cheese salad- super fresh and the dressing was vinegary and perfect. \\n4. Fried calamari- cooked perfectly. Had an interesting breading on it that I have never had before on calamari. Came with an aioli dipping sauce that was very tasty.\\n5. Paella- today's paella was the Barlata Paella, which has a ton of seafood, veggies, and a red sauce. It was very tasty. Almost ordered more but it was pricier than the other dishes at 7$ a pop. \\n6. Octopus and shrimp ceviche- this was one of my favorites. The octopus was prepared beautifully. Again, not enough crackers served with this but we had plenty of bread. \\n7. Chorizo in wine sauce- Very tasty. Came with mashed potatoes that were really good. \\n8. Catalan toast with Serrano ham- This was my favorite item. Thick bread with delicious thin shaved, cured Serrano ham dressed with a garlicky olive oil. Could've eaten several more plates of this. \\n9. Patatas bravas- fried potatoes with aioli and tomato sauce. So so so good. Perfectly greasy and salty and amazing. \\n\\nBetween the three of us, we each spent about 15 dollars including tip, which I think is a great deal. I don't think I would order off the regular menu though because it is pretty pricy (10$+ per item).

We had some time to kill before our friends arrived and opted for Tuscan Kitchen instead of some bar food.\\n\\nMy initial reaction to this restaurant was confusion, and I left feeling the same way. Here is why:\\n1. Entrance: Unclear entrance with foot traffic going to the movie theater and bowling. You never really walk into the restaurant. I think the exterior part is supposed to be more casual, seat yourself, but it wasn't casual enough and there wasn't any guidance. Alas, we claimed some seats at the side bar and asked a waiter if it was ok if we sat there.\\n2. Vibe: It feels like Tuscan Kitchen has an identity crisis. We definitely weren't dressed in nice dining clothing by any means, but it's not clear to me even now if that was ok. It seems like they want to be a place where you need to dress up more, but also quite welcoming. I appreciate a place that pull this off aesthetically and am definitely not opposed to this concept, but was confused by the goals of TK here.\\n3. Food: It is difficult to truly judge the food ordered when it comes out at suboptimal temperatures. We ordered two things from appetizer menu because didn't have a ton of time -  the arrancini & the large meatball. The food came out in five minutes and both items were borderline cold. It was clear that this was prepped ahead of time and just delivered when we ordered.\\nSauce - pretty bland and uneventful\\nBread - SO GOOD couldn't get over it. Best part of night.\\nWine - good, could've used more help ordering and took a while to come.\\n4. Cuisine: I am not an Italian food expert, but the menu was definitely a generic Italian menu and not truly focused on the nuances of Tuscan cuisine. I think they have a great opportunity to distinguish in this way but aren't using it.\\n5. Prices: quite expensive, especially for what we received.\\n\\nIn conclusion, the food was disappointing given the price, and definitely did not give much reason to return. Maybe we should give it another chance in the dining room, but it is certainly not near the top of the list in the near future."},{"name":"Ginger Exchange Symphony","address":"250 Huntington Ave","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"Today, I ordered a plate of Pineapple fried rice with pork and a plate of Mee Goreng beef.

Not a huge drink selection unlike every other takeout place in the area.  But the guys behind the counter were nice and joked with us.

Meh.\\n\\nI typically order a filet mignon cooked medium because I like tender pieces of meat and do not like fatty cuts. I believe that any good steakhouse should be able to cook a mean filet; Fleming's falls short - very short - in quality meat and execution. Both times I have been there the steaks have been very fatty, stringy, and the texture in general off - a poor cut. The steak should be seared before cooking to seal in the juices and flavor, the Fleming's steak was completely bland. I requested some Madeira sauce to try to add some flavor, but that didn't help much. The garlic mashed potatoes I ordered seemed to be completely lacking garlic and they were dry.\\n\\nMy husband ordered one of their specialties, the peppercorn steak, and described it as being \\"not a very high quality meat\\" and also complained his steak had an odd texture. The mushrooms he ordered as a side were \\"not as good as Ruth's Chris\\". The mysterious F17 sauce was \\"like Heinz 57 but spicier\\". \\n\\nThere are plenty of other restaurants in Orlando where you can get a better steak - start with Del Frisco's, Morton's,  Ruth's Chris, Norman's, or Shula's."},{"name":"Bruegger's Bagels","address":"1630 Neil Ave","city":"Columbus","stars":"4","text":"I knowwww this is a chain restaurant but there's just no denying I love Brueggers!!!\\n\\nThe bagels are chewy and dense and delicious.

In a recent Globe & Mail interview, famous Chef Vikram Vij says \\"I'm sick of Indian food\\" ... and it certainly shows! I'm sick of his food too! You know how sometimes something is just so very bad that it comes back full circle and ends up being so good? This is not that. Good taste is diametrically opposed to Vij's. This is not Indian whatsoever. A good Indian resto may or may not cater to non-vegetarian patrons but in any case it full well needs needs needs to have excellent vegetarian items. \\"Ahimsa\\" is the Sanskrit term for the ancient philosophy of non-violence. And goddamn if my tastebuds and sensibilities weren't assaulted and offended. As a racially ambiguous and post-race individual with a mixed ethnocultural heritage; half Indo-Guyanese-Canadian and half Québécois-French-Canadian ... and having had Indian food in (to name a few places) my Indian grandmother's kitchen in Montréal, restos in Montréal, Boston, NYC, Vancouver, Los Angeles, Bangkok, Tokyo, Greenville S.C., London, Amsterdam and all around Northern India for like six weeks and having cooked Indian food for myself, my friends and my family since I was like fourteen years old ... I think I can definitively proclaim that this is not Indian cuisine whatsoever. It is more like pretentious pseudo haute cuisine à la française; a type of failed fusion involving some stale spices, bland lifeless portions and little effort. It might walk like a duck, it might talk like a duck but it's a chicken. Well, my fine feathered friends, the case with Vij's is exactly the opposite of anything delicious. While the toilet is spotlessly clean and the wine glasses are nice and the ambiance is okay but kinda loud  ... the food is meh. Vij's is beyond the hype. The hype waited two hours for a seat, finally got a table, chewed this place up, took some strong antacids and subsequently had violent gastroenteritis. I wholeheartedly affirm that Vij's probably at one point had a soul and was indeed a \\"real boy\\" ... but that was once upon a time ... that was before it sold its soul (and its ability to make good food) in a Faustian stroke of treachery in exchange for some paltry C-list notoriety. I'm sure the food was good when there was a place on Broadway but the hype burned it all to the ground. The hype killed it dead. The hype killed everything good about this place. Frankly, I'm embarrassed on behalf of Vij's, on behalf of Vancouver and on behalf of Canada and the CBC. There is such good, damned good, Indian cuisine in Vancouver. Isn't Vij's supposed to be one of the best Indian restos in the entire world? Nope, no Michelin stars here. Vij's just brings a knife to a gunfight. It brings a puerile scratch and an infantile pull of the hair, you know ... like a bottle rocket, to an all out Cold War style ICBM arms race. Seriously. This would be a total travesty if we didn't have the ghost of Christmas future to deal with. That ghost of Christmas future ... she wasn't a ghost, she was actually real; you never knew her name but she did make your iPhone when she was five years old ... with her small hands and big suffering in a Chinese sweatshop. Enough suffering; Indian food is supposed to envelop you in a sensuously warming glow of perfectly balanced flavour. It is ancient, nuanced, inclusive and scrumptious. It is the true and tested culinary science of spice. Indian food leaves you satiated and fulfilled. Vij's on the other hand ... gives you heartburn. Heartburn! Go to any five dollar Indian hole-in-the-wall in Vancouver and you'll have a delicious, filling and oh so wonderful meal ... without heartburn. But at Vij's you'll spend 250$ and it doesn't matter what you order ... you'll be served a ghastly and flavourless concoction of oiliness. There is a dearth of choice with the vegetarian options. The only thing worth eating here is the free amuse-bouche that they serve while you wait for two hours ... also the chai and mango lassi as well as their highballs are good. I love cardamom in any form. So, the food was meh. Please, please, just go elsewhere. Go to Chutney Villa on Broadway and Main or Annapurna on 4th Avenue or House of Dosas on Kingsway or Saravana Bhavana in the Toronto area or Thanjai in Montréal. Anybody that has the gall to wait in line for this food whilst exercising common sense and acknowledging the multitude masses of humanity the world over for whom poverty and malnourishment are simply second nature...are yellow bellied posers with the intestinal fortitude of lily-livered chicken shits. Instead of standing in line here ... volunteer at your local InSite, take a stand and protest against institutional inaction concerning murdered and missing First Nations women in the Downtown Eastside and across Canada, build a home or bring clean drinking water to the Attawapiskat First Nation, go to Darfur and build a well or try to raise awareness about the global pandemic of violence against women.

I reserved a table for 6 of us, the restaurant was tiny, but had a nice ambiance to it and by the time we got there it was full. (I would say there is probably only room for around 20 people max).  It took the server about 15 minutes to get to our drinks order and then another 10 to take our food order.  We ordered oysters, seafood chowder, salmon and a few steamer pots. \\nWe were just chatting amongst ourselves for the next 30 minutes (no sign of food) around this time we all smelled weed coming from the kitchen. We found it kind of comical and joked about getting \\"special oysters\\". Anyway, about 45 minutes went by with everyone beginning to get very hungry. Still no sign of food. The server comes up to us at this point, apologizes and says the oysters will be along in around 10 minutes but the rest of the food will be a long time (come again???) We had already been waiting for 45 minutes! \\n\\nI tried to catch the servers attention to order some more wine- she snapped and said she'd get to me in a minute. When she took the wine order I asked if we could have some bread and she said we would have to wait 20 minutes if we wanted any. I don't understand how picking up a baguette and putting it on a plate can take 20 minutes but whatever. \\n\\nOur oysters finally came about an hour after ordering, yay! They came with a nice selection of sauces and I have to admit, they were good. The rest of the food came about 20 minutes after that, great, except we had no cutlery. We tried to get the servers attention but to no avail, the server ignored us and went into the kitchen so we flagged down the chef/busser/dishwasher (I don't know who he was), and actually asked him for cutlery. The server popped her head out of the kitchen as we were trying to get service from this guy (**awkward**) and then she went to fetch our cutlery. \\nMy friend liked the look of my chowder and asked if he could order a bowl, for which the server responded \\"it will be at least 20 minutes\\" -we were getting quite used to that response.\\n\\nSo yay! We finally had our food, you would think it would be plain sailing from now on right? Wrong. As we were just getting started on our long awaited food, a group of around 6 people showed up at the door, having reserved our table. Luckily we were given time to finish our food and wine, but only just - We were handed the bill, which included a 17%service (service??) charge, and then pretty much told we had to get out to make room for the other people that had reserved our table. \\n\\nI have to say it's a shame because this place has potential- I love the venue, it has a nice intimate, cozy  feel to it.  The oysters were good, my chowder was delicious, my friends enjoyed their steamer pots and the salmon. It's just the service was horrendous. It wasn't really the servers fault, she was run off her feet - although she could have dealt with the situation better. I use to be a server and would never have snapped at customers or waited 45 minutes to tell someone their food was going to be a while! You can't help being busy but you can help how you communicate with your patrons.\\n\\nI put this down to very bad management, they were just too under staffed. Maybe this was a one-off but I don't think so, I overheard the server talking to people at the bar saying Monday nights are always like this because of the wine deal.

Let me begin with a few things just to set the climate:\\n1. I hope this review gets to the management department and even to corporate. \\n2. I waited two weeks to write this review because I was so disappointed.\\n3. People go to Chick-Fil-A for consistency and customer service. \\n\\nLet's start with the line- not a problem at all, I 100% understand that CFA will have long lines, plus being in the busiest airport in the US, I decided it was worth the wait to get food that I could count on during a long trek from the Northeast to the Southwest. The line supervisor was very friendly and helpful, moving the line diligently to open cashiers. With my luck, I got the most disengaged young man I have ever had (not just CFA might I add), when I asked two questions he said, it's not up there is it? I said, fair, maybe a bad day or he didn't want to be at work after the holiday. After placing my order with no eye contact from this young man, I waited for my food. It was pretty simple, a CFA sandwich meal with a large order of French fries. When my meal came out, I still didn't have my drink, so I asked the young man, could I get my drink. No reply, he grabbed a cup and got my drink. I went to my table, opened my bad and had a medium order of fries.  had I had great service, I would have let it be, but I decided, I would ask a complete stranger to watch my belongings while I go back to the counter to see if these team had any remorse for the error. The line supervisor was very nice and told me to keep my current order of fries as she told the kitchen manager about the situation to get me new fries and the rights size. The kitchen manager said who has the fries and I raised the bag and of course I got a nasty look. By this time I got the fries and walked to my gate. \\n\\nLet me say this, I've never had this kind of service from CFA. I'm a national recruiter and every event I put on at college campuses I order CFA, well I can tell you, I will give it a second thought now. I didn't get a my pleasure, I didn't get a smile, I didn't get eye contact, hell I didn't even get my order correct. \\n\\nOne thing I've always respected about CFA is that, any location you go to you get the same product and service. Not here! I love that CFA sticks to what their founder envisioned- great customer service, great food and give your staff Sunday off to be with their family. I think many businesses could learn from Sam Truett Cathy ( and yes I know the whole story of CFA without googling it all the way to their conservative contributions). \\n\\nThis team needs some help and attitude adjustments. It's the holiday time, easy to be frustrated at work but also easy to remember your 'why' even when it's difficult. I really wish to speak to that young man, because I started as a young man (15 years old) working at a pizza place, and because of my customer focus, has afforded me so many opportunities and blessings at a young age. You never know who is watching you and could be the next person to help you in your career. \\n\\nI want to end with this- the food was good and fresh. For this CFA site, please keep customer service at your core. CFA is a great company and we all get busy at work and have tough days. For the young man, I wish you many blessings and if something was distracting you that day, it's all good.

That's not difficult, but this location PERPETUALLY skimps on toppings on the veggie sub,  which is infuriating considering the fact that it costs the same as a Meatball or Tuna sandwich. Look, I feel that if I'm paying the same amount as I would for meat, I should get an equivalent amount of vegetables to compensate.

This review is written because I find the outdoor patio area to be frustrating.  We went there last night, and for the attention to detail they put on the inside of the restaurant, the outside has beautiful plants, fire, and rockwork, but the rest of it seems it was left to go.  \\n\\nThe patio furniture is like something you would see at carlos and charlies, and they seem to have made the patio the area where they store everything they arent using.  There are stools stored upside down, a random ugly portable bar that looks delapidated, and the tent covering makes you feel like you are in a cheap temporary set up for a saint patricks day party.  \\n\\nFurther, the service inside is great, while the outside is like a stepchild.  I don't get it, this place brings in the dough, why not finish the job Ranch 616 ?  You could design a cool slanted roof or something simple, and invest in some decent tables that you dont have to put sweet and low underneath so they dont wobble.\\n\\nThis could be the coolest area of the restaurant, but you have made it a dump.  And the outside service needs to be beefed up, big time.\\n\\nDont make us eat in your storage closet.\\n\\n\\nKeep going with the good food though."},{"name":"Tequila's Mexican Cantina","address":"979 Main St","city":"Wakefield","stars":"4","text":"Loved it!\\n\\nCame here for the first time for lunch on Saturday with a friend who was dying to try it. I'm generally not a huge fan of mexican, but I AM a fan of margaritas so I agreed to go. I got a coco-rita (excellent) and I believe she had the pomegranate margarita, which she also loved. We started with tableside \\"everything\\" guac and queso with added spinach. They were both awesome. The queso is white, which is a kind I've never had - but now I don't want to go back to the orange kind!\\n\\nWe were kind of full after those apps and drinks, so we ended up just splitting the mango quesadilla. It was really good, although I was under the impression it would have a lot of mango inside of it - but only saw a few pieces of diced mango on top. I only bring that up to let people know not to order it if they want a ton of mango flavor. REGARDLESS, it was delicious! The next two drinks we got were the coconut mojito and the paloma - two more really great cocktails.\\n\\nThroughout the meal, the waitress checked back on us, refilled our chips, got us water, asked if we needed anything. Additionally, the owner, Eric (at least I think he's the owner) dropped by to see how everything was, ask how we liked the place, etc. He was super friendly and receptive. When we left, he even stuck his head out the front door to say goodbye to us and thank us for coming in. Great customer service over there, and i hope they can keep it up!\\n\\nOverall I would definitely recommend this place and will be going back soon.

The Fried Green tomatoes lacked flavor, depth, and were overpowered with red onion. The antipasto was heavy on spinach for some reason, with average meats and decent cheese.

We came on a Friday night at about 6:15 and were seated immediately.  After looking at the menu for a short while we decided on the bone in 21 oz rib eye.  We ordered two for the four of us to share.  The side choices were nice with your standard potato, salads, and fries with a few additional sides such as onion straws.

Maybe Ziosk is just some corporate marketer or customer experience guys idea of customer service, without having to pay to staff actual human beings that you can actually flag down as they walk by and provide true customer service.

Maybe it's because Ziosk has caused them to drop some staff and now the servers are busy running around trying to get everything done and are not hanging around waiting for some light to flash.

Really good if you like a more citrusy rendition.  The jamon toast was my favorite.  $4 gets you two pieces of toast with tomatoes and more than expected ham.  Really good dish.  Overall service was slow to begin but then dishes came out quickly and poorly paced.  I'd recommend coming here for tapas, but order as you want food, since the kitchen brings it out as ready and things could get hectic at the table."},{"name":"Barlata Tapas Bar","address":"1500 S Lamar Blvd, Ste 150","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Super slow service, it took forever for food. \\nThey don't have any idea about tapas, they brought frozen bread to table, it was brunch only two tables in the restaurant still not able to handle"},{"name":"Boston Tea Stop","address":"54 Jfk St","city":"Cambridge","stars":"3.5","text":"Forget about the bubble tea, I was so thrown off by all the passive aggressive signs all around when I first walked in. \\n\\n\\"Less ice does not mean more tea\\" \\n\\"If you drop your drink, we will not make you another one.\\" \\n\\"If you pop your straw on your drink on this counter, pay $300.\\" \\n\\"No bathroom/cash only\\" \\n\\"Do not forcefully pop your straw, tough guy\\" \\n\\nI saw all of these before even had a chance to look at the menu.

At 5:00pm we were still not seated. Finally at 5:15pm we were seated. Servers were  very good and we placed our order. All but 3 ordered  the Turkey. Food was brought out and the portions were absolutey the saddest portions I have ever seen and 5 out of the 8 plates did not have stuffing and the 3 who did get it got about a tablespoon of stuffing. We asked for stuffing for the 5 who did not get it and was told they ran out Sorry. We ate and then ordered desserts. Our choices we were given  was pumpkin cheesecake or a special  apple critter or crunch something.  Waiting for our desserts which 9 ordered the apple crisp whatever a manager came over and says I am sorry but we ran out of the apple  dessert but we can offer you something else. Our friend George Roma paid the entire bills which was about $1000.00 if you count $100.00 at the bar  and our food check for $694.00 and then the tip.  We had no idea he was paying the entire bill which made us feel worse that he spent about $1000.00 on a bill worth about total $300.00.

My girlfriend and me happen to yelp the area our hotel was in and found this place. Arriving at the restaurant we walked into a dead looking place. Only a few other tables were filled and the bar was pretty empty. This was definitely deceiving, after eating here I couldn't understand why it wasn't busier. We got chips and salsa along with our drinks fairly quick. The chips cone in a cone shaped holder with two sides of salsa. One big negative for me is that you only get one FREE order of chips. The salsa that comes with this chips was pretty good. It didn't taste like it was from a jar like some places. After reviewing the menu with my date we decided to share the fajitas. Our waiter said they were \\"Shareable\\" and put in a extra order for tortillas for us. Pretty much right after we ordered a giant skillet of steaming hot fajitas comes barreling out of the kitchen. This was the biggest negative of my whole dining experience. I hate when food comes out immediately after ordering, I like to enjoy my time dining. Back to the food, the toppings for the fajitas were all fresh looking. It came with the standard stuff like, guac, sour cream, pico, and lettuce. It was kinda disappointing seeing the portion of guac, especially for two people to share. On to that steaming hot skillet, it was very good. Came with lots of chicken and veggies and it was more than enough for two people to share. So we ended up saving money by only paying for one meal and a side of tortillas. In the end, we both left full and satisfied. If I can change anything about the meal it would have been the time the food came out. I know its Mexican, but come on! Slow it down a little! \\n\\nOverall, if you're in the area looking for something Mexican. Check this place out.

In Spanish she told the guy (She ordered a drink and decided to get water, she wants the charge of the drink taken off) He asks her to continue preparing the food while he tries to figure out how to reimburse me correctly.

The waiter said the hold up was because we had food from the grill but nothing we ordered came from the grill. Everything we got was Fried or roast beef which was not from the grill (not to mention it was a lunch special so they should have plenty of it).  Additionally we asked for the check when the food came and it still took another 10 minutes for the waiter to get us our checks and checkout.

I always just seemed to prefer it to Starbucks during my L.A. tenure.\\nSo the first time I availed myself of the Northwest Austin 'Bean', was during my experience with my new tire at Discount Tires, right across the parking lot.\\nthis location had an old familiar feel to it (about 8 years have past since my last visit to 'The Bean'), and I was greeted by the affable Kiki. I explained my quandry--as a coffee fanatic, and a fan of CB&TL, I really wanted a huge, steaming cup of hi-test joe; BUT as a newly-minted cardiac patient, I needed a *gasp* DECAF...  In my coffee dogma, decaf is sacriledge--with no real reason to even exist--but I guess as a placebo for the hi-test, it would have to suffice.

I can buy bootleg dvds in Chinatown with Visa, but not food and beverage in Harvard Square?\\n- All they have is regular sized boba. No mini boba. No pudding. No lychee jelly. Back in the bay, I almost never get regular boba anymore. \\n- They show random TV shows on their flat screen, with the sound inaudible, pretty much wasting the fact that its there. Flat screens at boba joints are supposed to play music videos or Asian movies or at least something other than silent Law & Order. \\n- No food except for the mediocre dumplings. Where's the popcorn chicken? Where's the fried squid? No waffles or any desert food either?Where's any sort of food which is half the reason I usually go to boba places.\\n- They're selection of magazines and games is subpar. \\n- The place doesn't have enough seating, and the seats are like old school wooden classroom seats. I guess it's harvard-esque but there are no big comfy couches or anything like that, which make it not the most comfortable place to chill. Which maybe is because they don't want ppl chilling there because the place is too small to fit that many pl anyways. \\n- It seems bland and sterile inside. Pale green and white are the only colors. But maybe I'm just comparing it to the bright orange and blue of Tapioca Express.\\n- There's nothing fobby and fun about this place at all. It seems incredibly stripped of the fobby background from which boba comes from. I'm all about inclusion, but the place is not Asian enough (accordingly, Wagamama is right across the street). At any given time, a random white person whose never seen a boba place could walk in and not know that boba is an Asian thing. Maybe that sums up a lot of what I've been talking about. Boston Tea Stop is a fake, plastic, stripped of fobby-ness boba place that reinforces my general feeling that there is no strong Asian-American presence in Boston.\\n\\nStill 3 stars since there drinks are pretty good, and their boba is reliably the right consistency.

My friend ordered the Taudry Tillie sans vodka (it was midday and we were working). The drink was way too sweet for my taste and the pop rocks were kind of sloppy on the rim. Clever idea but could use a little work on the execution.  My food was delicious. The tomato soup was tied for my favorite with another local restaurant in SW.

I've never felt like such an inconvenience or less welcomed from these people . I'll be the first to say that customer service isn't a job that just anyone can fill and As someone who takes such pride in that position it breaks my soul to have to continue being treated so terribly by this establishment. Rude is an understatement ! I've been going there for over 3 yrs and after so long you would think I would have given up on them by now , but dining out is a luxury that not everyone can afford and my dollar always went a long way where food was concerned. I have tough skin and a big heart and I always hope next time will be different so I've given them the benefit of the doubt until now . The entire staff lack personality, professionalism, and any kind of care towards providing exceptional guest service . There was one gentleman today , the youngest male on staff who by the grace of god approached us with a smile and provided us with waters while I watched our server sit down to have himself lunch while we remained unattended, ignored and forgotten. Every thing we asked seemed to bother him, we had to ask for everything we needed to share and eat our meals which seemed to bother him even more . A previoustime I invited a friend with me to eat dinner and while we were finishing our desserts, my seat was faced towards the t.v , it was pushing towards closing time with time still to spare and spoon in mouth , check already paid , tip already given , our server pointed the remote to the t.v and literally powered it off . MIND BLOWN at the nerve she had and how comfortable she was with being that nasty to rush us out . Today while our server was still MIA our check was dropped off by another nasty staff member who proceeded to pull out the cash in the book and count the money bill by bill while she placed it on our table right in front of us . Needless to say I left 0$ dollars for tip and instead provided a generous one to the young man who graced us with not only a smile but attentiveness in the absence-of our  poor excuse of a server and it's poor excuse of a business.

The service is phenomenal and so is the food. They cater to Vegans/vegetarians and have gluten free options. The coffee water and tea is self serve.

You can sit outside at the bar or at a table. They provide blankets, it's pet friendly and child friendly. The bar has full service and they carry kombucha.

The food is ok but what makes me give this such a negative review is....no room & slow service. I honestly don't think that Flores is equipped to handle more than 30 customers at a time. It took forever to just get drinks and then another 45 minutes to an hour to receive our food. I do have to say that we did not call before we headed over there and they did accommodate us quickly. However, I still feel that with such a big party they should have done more to get us out of the way of other customers. We were squished between the restrooms and the bar. I got bumped so many times by waiters and customers headed to the bar or restroom that I lost count. In addition to where we were, there is the matter of our tables, they were miss matched sizes. 4 people out of a group of 13 were sitting with a plate that was 2 inches lower than there drink because there was just not enough room. I do have to say again, they did get our tables together quickly and they were very nice while arranging everything. As far as the food goes, I have had better and I have had worse. I don't think we will be back any time in the future. I'll stick to Jardin Corona and next time we have such a large party, I'll make sure someone calls ahead!"},{"name":"El Patron Mexican Restaurant & Cantina","address":"12167 S Apopka Vineland Rd","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"Amazing!

The broth has the traditional tonkotsu flavor to it but also some mushroom ish flavor (I doubt its mushroom though), which is quite unique and I enjoyed it.  Noodles are your traditional Japanese ramen noodle with firm texture, not the straight or thin noodles. The bowl came with chashu, ajitama, wood ear mushroom, grilled corn, bakchoi, nori, fried garlic, bamboo and kuromayu.\\nNow I'm not going to pick on what needs to be or not in their ramen, especially since this is a signature ramen for them, but corn and bakchoi was definitely an interesting choice.

We have always enjoyed the excellent, authentic traditional Italian food, and even the truly old-school decor. We went there recently as a group to celebrate a special occasion, and while the food was as we remembered it, we received truly poor service. The server taking care of our table was slow to appear at first. Because of the delay, we were already prepared to order appetizers when he arrived for our drink order. He began to walk away before even giving us an opportunity to do that and acted annoyed when we politely asked him to wait a moment so we could order those. The appetizers and drinks were brought fairly quickly; however, the server who was actually taking orders for our table did not reappear for an inexplicably long time. We had to flag him down. When he did appear, he gave no explanations about the menu--odd, since we had a group of 12 people and doing so likely would have saved him some time and trouble--and when he went to take orders, he was extremely curt and rushed each person, actually making a \\"speed it up\\" motion with his hand if the person did not order quickly enough. Servers there customarily ask what type of pasta one wants as a side. Not only did he not do that (and a few in our group did not even know there were other options), but he had to be hailed back again so we could make those requests. His rudeness was so egregious that one in our party actually had to ask him to speak with respect, a request a polite patron at a restaurant never should have to make. HIs behavior was not confined to our table. We witnessed it at the table behind us as well. They had to flag him down for routine things like taking entree orders after appetizers are delivered. He also rushed them along and spoke to them the same way he did us. Even superlative food cannot compensate for the sour taste such behavior leaves behind.

Just 2 shrimps, 2 slices of fatty char siew, 3 pieces of squid, 2 pieces of chicken and 2 pieces of mushrooms. We paid over $13.00 for this plate. Service was bad too.

Once for karaoke, once for Sunday brunch. The service was amazing both times--we had quick, friendly waiters who knew how to do their job. \\n\\nThere was a fun crowd at karaoke, very supportive (when the music cut out during my Billy Joel solo, everyone joined in to help me finish the song). Also, this was when I learned they serve half pints. Awesome. \\n\\nBrunch was dee-licious plus we took advantage of their $25 for a pitcher of mimosas and any 2 entrees deal (and it was a big pitcher, enough for us to have 2 pint glass-sized mimosas each). I had french toast topped with Bailey's and raspberry coulis, my sister had the sausage and sundried tomato scramble, and my other sister (vegetarian) had the crab cake eggs benedict with the crab cake on the side (they listened to her request and made sure it wasn't touching her food at all). We got sides of grits and rosemary home fries and shared everything so I got to try it all. And everything impressed me except the crab cake, which was unlike any crab cake I've ever had and just weirded me out a little bit. I couldn't see the flaky crab meat without cutting into it; it looked more like a little cylinder of grilled chicken to me from the outside, like smooth instead of flaky. I could taste shrimp flavor when I took a bite. It wasn't necessarily bad, just weird. I asked the waiter what was in it and he said it was held together by a shrimp, egg, and mayo mousse, which explained the shrimp flavor, but not really the smooth outer layer. My sister (non-vegetarian) liked it though. \\n\\nAnyway, I may have been a bit harsh about the inadequacy of this place as an homage to James Joyce in my previous review. But for what it is, a Decatur (not Irish) pub and townie hangout, and when it's not being taken over by pirates and wenches, it certainly does the job."},{"name":"Hot Pot Buffet","address":"70 Beach St","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"At first, I was just excited that someone had decided to resurrect this end of Chinatown from the dead. But I was even more excited to find that it was a buffet hot pot! Usually, I find eating at Shabu Zen  or Kaze not worth the money. Hot pot is probably one of my favorite dishes but it could get a bit expensive for my thrifty taste. My hope for an all-you-can-eat hot pot place had previously vanished with the closing of the somewhat overpriced Jin's in Saugus. But alas, spring is here and hope springs anew with Buffet Hot Pot! The set up is not as extravagant as Jin's--- there are no buffet tables overflowing with everything one can possibly dip into hot steamy broth.  However, throw-away menus are provided so you can check off what you want--similar to the paper menus at a sushi joint and reminiscent of Little Q in Quincy. The offerings are more than decent here--- big clams, crab legs, scallops, lobster (for extra 7.95), fish balls, different grades of sliced beef, lamb, chicken, watercress, taro, and many more. The size of the cuts and quantity of the items are definitely above those at other hot pot places.  Shabuzen and Kaze are for pansies that don't like value and depend on the surrounding and atmosphere to make their food taste better. Buffet Hot Pot is above that trickery. Like other old school places, it doesn't depend on furnishing but the food itself to rope in eaters. For a decent price (14.95 for lunch, 19.95 for dinner), you get a good variety of food and leave feeling full for hours. We had the Mala (spicy hot) broth at our table, it was herbal and very good. If you like the different condiments for dipping (garlic, red chilli pepers), you will have to ask the waiter for them. We ordered the crab--delicious--you will have to use your hands but who cares, this isn't the Oak Room!  Actually, don't order this if you are the type to prefer food that comes in pretty packages without skin and bones from the supermarket--you'll end throwing out the top crab shell containing the delicious rich mustard. Opt for just the crab legs. The salmon was good and the white fish was surprisingly good. The clams were cherrystones, way better than the littleneck clams at Shabu Zen. The different meats were tasty and didn't come out somewhat frozen like I've experienced at Kaze (don't get me wrong, I used to love Kaze and I think they are still a good place).  The tofu was big and lovely--- I hate going to places where they give you tiny cubes of tofu-- here, they give you hefty square globs, love it! My eating partner's main gripe was that the scallops were imitation scallop but I don't think most regular diners will notice. I myself thought they were a different type of scallops but who really knows. Besides that, service was more or less efficient in that we didn't have to wait too long for plates to come out or get our water glasses refilled. Although they could definitely tighten up their operation--- some items we ordered did not come and we jokingly wondered if that was their game--- to \\"forget\\" to bring something out so that we don't end up eating them out of business. I hope that's not the case because I really think this is going to be my to go place for hot pot!\\n\\nBottom Line: Asian's Asian restaurant (i.e. you know how to eat (order things to your liking like the side condiments for dipping, how to eat a crab in public and not care about how you look, etc), you don't care for décor, you don't want smiling waiters sucking up to you, you value abundance over presentation, and good food above all else)"},{"name":"Cathay Pacific Restaurant","address":"111 Hancock St","city":"North Quincy","stars":"3","text":"I dont even know how to put this.

My friend had arranged an outing with our kids, who ranged from ages 3-10years old.    Everything started out fine. We reserved two lanes, and everyone was having a great time.   Unfortunately both lanes malfunctioned probably a dozen times between the two of them. (If you're  competitive bowler, take note! you will lose your score and your pens will randomly reset)   Anyway, we were with kids, so no harm done, we weren't exactly keeping score.  We made the best of it.  The last time one of the lanes malfunctioned, two of the older kids in our group took it upon themselves to reset the lane  (they had seen the tech do it a number of times, so they mistakenly took matters into their own hands)  they were already half way down the lane when two of the parents in our group reprimanded their kids and told them to get off the ally.  The kids were totally in the wrong, I get it. They crossed the line.  It happened so fast.  I can confirm the parents were very proactive, and corrected the problem immediately.  And they were sincerely apologetic to the employee who addressed the group.   He accepted their apology (from both kids and parents ) and everything was settled.... Well,  the manager found out what happened, so 5 minutes after the incident,  she shut down the entire bowling ally,  lights, lanes, and computers, and then over the intercom, SHE WENT OFF on a two minute rant shaming the parents and the kids for crossing the line. Her tone was unprofessional, hostile and down right angry.  I happened to be closing my tab at the bar when this rant over the intercom took place, and everyone (including the bartender) was in complete shock.   Jaw. Drop. Shock.    It was a public shaming and it was very embarrassing.     Were the kids in the wrong?  Absolutely.   Should the kids have been reprimanded?  Yes.   Should the parents have been lectured? Perhaps.  I totally get it.  The employees had every reason to confront the kids and parents.   They know they were wrong and they learned from it.     The kids weren't raising hell, they didn't damage anything, they didn't make a mess, they weren't' being disrespectful.   Yes they crossed the line, and they apologized, everyone apologized.  Both parents emphatically apologized. \\n\\nShould the manager engage in a face to face conversation with parents? Yes.   Even it's an unpleasant conversation? Absolutely, without a doubt.    Shutting down an entire bowling ally,  and then chewing out the parents/kids over the intercom for two minutes was extremely low, insulting and downright wrong.  In our group, we had a total of 10 kids and 6 parents, we spent around $300 for 2 hours of \\"fun\\"  and we were ALL humiliated and shammed in front of everyone.  That should never happen to anyone."},{"name":"Hudson Grille","address":"4046 Peachtree Rd NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3","text":"Had some beers and appetizer here.

Thanks for that. \\n\\nWent during Easter Sunday, family is a mission to try different foods each year. This year family style pasta. We wish however our servicer would have better explained size of dishes.\\n\\nFor 10 of us we ordered two large salads, a large spaghetti & meatballs, large lasagna and a small cheese Alfredo. \\n\\nStarting with the salads - for the prices this should be included in the meals. The house Italian dress was very tasty, and all kinds of different lettuces mixed in. Fresh salad, didn't go wrong. None left, even the kids had some. \\n\\nSpaghetti- three huge meatballs that we cut in half for each person. They were seasoned & cooked well. The pasta its self was done perfectly. The pasta sauce, we will call it watered red color. It was runny, didn't stick to the pasta noddles, and lacked any flavor close to pasta sauce. The bowl the spaghetti came in was filled to the top with noodles. It was so large & taste less most of it went home (added jar store bought spaghetti sauce)\\n\\nThe Lasagna was the worst lasagna I've had, and I've had banquet microwave lasagna. It had want tasted and felt like breaded cheese in the middle layers. It didn't go home and most went to waste. Servicer also never asked if it was ok, a nearly whole large lasagna should have been a clue to ask.\\nThe sauce on this also lacked any flavor. It was very sad and a big disappointment. \\n\\nThe reason for the 3 starts is all do to the small Cheese Alfredo. It was cheesy goodness. With a hit of butter. Perfectly cook noodles. This small Alfredo was so good, everyone ate it and wishes we would have had more let along ordered in on a large. I cannot explain how tasty and wonderful this simple cheese alfredo was. Bar none, the best item on the menu. \\n\\nMight go back to give that cheese alfredo another try.

I didn't come in the front door, which would have helped.  Still, having to ask a staff member to point me in the right direction put me off from the beginning.  Then, when I found what I thought was the front desk, it turned out it wasn't.  It was something called Quick Queue.  I haven't looked it up to see what that is for.\\n\\nIf your room is not facing Sea World, then it's on the opposite side of the lobby from the front desk.  It's a pretty good hike to get to the right elevator bank.  If you're on the Sea World side, the elevators are right behind you at the front desk.\\n\\nThe rooms are okay, just standard hotel rooms.  There was adequate soundproofing between rooms, at least around ours, but the doors slamming along the hallway is very audible.  And all the doors slam when they close, unless you close them yourself.\\n\\nCleanliness:  I did my usual check for bedbugs and found none.  Sheets were clean, and the mattresses also seemed clean.  Bathroom was clean:  showers, sinks, and toilet.  The towels were spotless.  The toilet lid was off center.  There were no visible stains on the chairs or carpet.  One stain that looked like green ink on one of the bed runners.\\n\\nTV, refrigerator, clocks, alarms, telephone, and coffee maker all worked.  Climate control was smooth and kept things comfortable without lots of noise or excessive air blowing.\\n\\nThere's a laundry facility that was pretty busy when I walked by it.  Starbuck's is in the lobby, as is a creamery that makes ice cream sundaes, milkshakes, cones, etc.\\n\\nWe ate at the sports bar in the lobby.  Food was overpriced and probably all frozen.  My blackened chicken sandwich was okay - the spicy mayo had a bitter herb that clashed with the spices of the chicken.  The fries were limp and bland.  Pretty disappointing for $14.  Service was slow, probably because they have to hike the food across that vast lobby, but our waiter was friendly.\\n\\nAside from a flashy lobby and having maximum convenience to Sea World, there's not much special about this place except the great customer service.  About the best part of this hotel was the staff I encountered.  All of them were cheerful, friendly, professional, courteous, and helpful."},{"name":"The Busy Bee Cafe","address":"810 Martin Luther King Jr Dr SW","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"If you are old enough to remember when yo Big Mama made every dish from scratch (or just extremely) lucky, then you need to run, not walk, to Busy Bee's right now.

I woke up Sunday and was in the mood for some good southern cooking but I didn't feel like cooking, I wanted to sit down in a restaurant and eat so I decided to try this place because I'd heard great things about it from different people, PLUS we walked in and their grade was a 92, so I'm thinking great!  uuuuh Nope! It's disorganized, the people that call in their orders are the smart ones but because there is no separate area for them to wait they are standing in the door.  There is a bench to await your impending pounce on an open table but it's of course shared with those that are waiting on their take-out.  They actually have a counter area to eat but of course it's also first come first serve.  The setup is much like \\"Thumbs Up\\" except that diner actually has seating arrangements.  You know sign in/party for xx, and they call you when it's ready..you know normal restaurant/diner stuff.  But hey, it's just what i expect around my people in the hood.

The jalapeño slices were fresh and brought some zing to the plate. The steak was a little chewy at times, but that's expected with flank steak. The avocados and cheese further enhanced the fatty profile of this meal without feeling overboard. The bread was pillow soft yet sturdy. They didn't do much to the bread, but never did it get dry or overbearing. The fries had a great salt and oil taste, but they had no crunch. If you order tap water here, don't drink it. It's basically chalky tap water. \\n\\nI didn't expect this place to blow me away, but I was impressed on their torta. Too often a torta promises the world and offers little in retrospect.

For the newbies at hotpot, the experience goes like this, you're seated, asked what to drink, pick your choice of broth, check off the items that you'll want to dip in the broth and it'll be out in about 5 minutes. \\n\\nThe menus gives you a wide variety of beef cuts, seafood items, noodles, rice and anything else that you can dip. Here's the catch, if you're ordering over 10 items its likely that you'll get half of what you've checked off. So if you have something in mind, keep an eye out for it or you'll have to ask them to bring it out. For the most part, most of the items are fresh but there are days where they come out and it's clearly been sitting in the fridge all day. We ordered enoki mushrooms and they were almost yellow rather than their off white color.

A good deal for the amenities and upgrades that this HOTEL has. I emphasize the word hotel because that's what it is -- not a \\"resort\\" that many mid-to-upper scale hotels are now claiming to be in lieu of milking those \\"resort\\" fees out of customers ($25 a night plus tax here). To start, it's obvious that the hotel has been updated to stay with the times. The lobby and atrium are beautiful. The room itself: well appointed and clean. Service: overall well. Now for some negatives. You are forced into self parking or valet, $25 and $34 a night respectively. I am cheap and able bodied so I opted for self parking. For $25 a night, the parking isn't covered and is very tight but it is secured by gate at least. The major issue is that by evening the parking lot is full resulting in many paying customers having to park in the overflow parking next door at Seaworld - not even on hotel property and a 5 min walk to the hotel door and not secured by any means. This happened both nights. To pay the fee and not reap any benefits is unacceptable, so I encourage you to politely dispute the fee if you find yourself in this situation - the hotel obviously has a parking problem because we were told this happens frequently. Next, the bathrooms... Wow! I guess the renovation money dried out by the time the bathrooms were thought of. Very outdated and the toilet ran the entire time - cheaper hotels have better bathrooms!

This place has plenty of great ideas of different dumplings, but the two we sampled didn't impress.  The pacific dumpling was undercooked, and the filling was too pastelike to be any good.  The emperor dumpling was a bit better as it was fried, and at least cooked better, but also lacked anything special.  Both dumplings were fairly small as well, and for the premium this place is charging for it's dumplings, I had expected better.  Otherwise, I'd rather go to my local Chinese place, and just get some peking raviolis.  We also tried their love noodles, which weren't bad, but also didn't come out as we expected based on their description of hot peanut sauce.

My first bite tasted fishy, in the way that said 'something' isn't right fishy. I couldn't exactly pinpoint what it was.....freezer burn? fishy in not a good way, but no not really. So my guest tried it and said to send it back. Our server, Mandi, was more than ok with getting me something else. So here came the Taco Mama and mami it was good. The short ribs were tender and full of flavor, and with a addition of 'beer bacon jam', well you couldn't go wrong. The blue cheese was a perfect addition. \\nThe taco and beer came up to $12. Take some napkins if you go to the bathroom. I will have to give Vanbarry's another go before I toss is completely aside. \\nHave a seat outside if you need a B Grade place for a bite and beer."},{"name":"1000 Degrees Neapolitan Pizzeria","address":"13599 W Colonial Dr","city":"Winter Garden","stars":"2.5","text":"Took and impromptu trip out for dinner and we ended up wanting to try a new local place.  Walked in and was overwhelmed by the shear amount of employees behind the counter.  Overall impression of the restaurant was it had a cheapish fell kind of lime the McDonalds of brick oven cooking.  The pizza and wings order was simple and the staff was very cordial.  I understand a few hiccups as they are newly opened.  They brought a completely wrong pizza to the table that my wife had built, and we were the only ones in the restaurant, not quite sure who's pizza we got, but hey exchanged it and made a new one fairly quickly. Now for the quality, kind of felt it had the same feel as the decor, not much personality, just a bland pizza, the wings also didn't have much flavor.  Crust was cooked fine with no issue there.  Maybe we just need to wait a while for them to develop, but have no plans to return in the near future.

My son has been going to Mini Miracles for a few months now. After visiting several daycare centers in the area, we fell in love with Mini Miracles. All the kids seem so happy and cared for that it felt like the right fit for our son. I was on the fence about sending him to daycare or getting a nanny and I am so happy with my decision! I have never felt like the center only cares about my money. In fact, I thought it was incredible that the director, first Nikia and now Amy, knows each child by his/her name! All the staff is very friendly, smile and say hello whenever we are dropping off or picking up our son. \\nI can only \\"review\\" the Infant 1 room as my son is still in that room. The teachers, DD & Stephanie, are amazing with him! When he sees them, his face lights up and he is genuinely excited to see them! I can tell that they love him and truly care about him and his wellbeing. I have seen them kiss him and I have no problem with it at all! If I can't be with my son all day, then I hope that whoever is with him is treating him well and showing him love! Babies need love and attention! I'm not sure why someone wouldn't want they're baby to feel loved at all times! The room itself is clean and organized and there is a \\"dirty toy\\" bin for toys that need to be washed before another baby can play with it. I have never seen anyone in the Infant 1 room with shoes on unless they are covered with booties. \\nAs for the Infant 1 curriculum... they are infants! They eat, sleep & play. But I have definitely seen changes in my son's abilities and I'm fairly certain he had his first giggle with DD at daycare! As he grows, he is learning more and more!  I have no doubt that as he gets older the curriculum will prepare him for kindergarten.\\nIn reference to the baby who had heat rash... I believe that was my son however the heat rash had NOTHING to do with daycare. He got heat rash from being in a very warm room outside of daycare with lots of people cuddling and holding him. I mentioned it to the daycare providers because I wanted them to keep a bib on him to keep his chest/belly dry and to keep him in a light onesie so he didn't get hot and irritate it. I have noticed the Infant 1 room is warm which is why I send him in a short-sleeve onesie and pants. \\nAll in all I would highly recommend this daycare. I actually did recommend it to a friend recently!

Set up to be something like a sandwich bar, the ingredients for the rolls are laid out behind the glass at the counter just waiting to be chosen. But unlike most sandwich bars, there aren't really any clues as to how you're supposed to order or what the finished product will look like. After much discussion, I discovered that each roll is MASSIVE -- like a whole meal, kind of gargantuan (this would explain the $8 price tag on a single roll thing they've got going on). No need to order more than one. Trust me.\\n\\nOptions are either a nori or soy wrap, white, brown or black rice, two meats and two veggies, one sauce and two toppings. I'm not a huge fan of mixing my meat, especially in a sushi roll, but my (male, mind you) dining companion so kindly noted that so long as I don't look at the process as a sushi bar, but rather a strange mashup of North American stoner customs AND Japanese sushi, then it's a new game. One wherein meats are mixed, toppings include -- but are not limited to -- potato chips (because, why not?), tobiko, tempura flakes, wakame salad (yes, as a topping), fake crab, and a whole other assortment of confused cultural edibles. The finished product wasn't entirely what I wanted, but I'm the only one who can carry the blame for this. I made the damn thing. \\n\\nThis place has a few kinks to roll out (though it appears to be a fast food joint, it takes forever for a roll to be finished; they use too much rice in said rolls; and the ingredients themselves are cut a bit thick for my liking -- but like I said, this isn't traditional Japanese), but I still really like the concept. Hence the fourth star. This is a solid 3-star spot, but it's like that kid who could almost be flunking grade 7 but shows that he understands what's being taught so is passed based on potential. They just need a little time, is all. Also, the guys who started it are so stoked on the whole thing, that it's pretty hard not to be just as enthusiastic about it. \\n\\nI'd totally go back, if only to try the other dishes they have to offer (tofu ice cream, bubble tea).

So let's call it 3.4 stars for good measure.\\n\\nLast Wednesday, the fiancée and I met my sister-in-law for dinner at Artist Point. Like all the other 2 point restaurants on the Disney Dining Plan, you do need reservations many months in advance. Perhaps they take walk-ins, I can't say. I imagine if they do, and you try it, you'll be waiting forever for a table. \\n\\nDespite having reservations, when we checked in we were given a beeper to alert us when our table was ready. We took it to the bar and had a few unnecessary, ridiculous drinks. I ordered the manliest drink on the menu: a BluTini. The rim was laced with sugar and that's about all I tasted as I drank it as fast as I could to end the dumb gag. The glowing blue cube in the middle makes this truly a drink any lumberjack will curtsey for. Boo.\\n\\nWe were seated at a pretty decent table near the center of the room. Our waiter was fine, no complaints. Using the Disney Dining Plan, the fiancée and I were each entitled to an appetizer, entrée, dessert, and non-alcoholic drink. For an app, I got some bacon pork thing. It was better than I anticipated but not half as good as my fiancée's smoky portobello mushroom soup. This is the restaurant's signature app and when you taste it, you too will know why. My sister-in-law got the mussels and she liked them. \\n\\nAgainst my better judgment, I ordered the filet mignon for my entree. I've lost track of how many of these I've eaten on this trip. Because I've had so many different steaks in Disney, I think I can say with some authority that the filet mignon at Artist Point is the least appealing. It was a far cry from terrible but it certainly wasn't anything spectacular either. I asked for it to be prepared medium-rare and they took it upon themselves to cook it borderline medium-well. Brash! Beyond that oversight, it was also a plain and flavorless meat despite the lobster mushroom ragoût and roasted savory truffle that accompanied it. But here's the kicker--hold on, we need a new paragraph for this gem.\\n\\nThe filet comes with a hazelnut crunch donut filled with yukon gold potato and red currant gastrique. If it looks intriguing when you read those words here (or on the actual menu), back away. It is nonsense. What is it? I don't get it! You're offering a sugar donut filled with potatoes and this is enticing why? Well, I fell for it. And I ate half of it just to make sure I wasn't crazy. I'm not. The donut, she's not good.\\n\\nMy fiancée ordered the Airline Chicken that, despite it's horrid name, was excellent. We both loved it. It was so moist and flavorful. Five stars for the chicken here folks. Get that.\\n\\nMy sister-in-law had the scallops. She enjoyed them but wasn't doing backflips over the taste.\\n\\nDessert for me was the crème brûlée and a specialty drink called the Nutty Mountain. The crème brûlée was good and the Nutty Mountain actually had some nuts in it. I wasn't expecting that. Kinda weird to be drinking coffee one second and then realizing there are nuts in your mouth the next. Um.\\n\\nThe cobbler is highly raved about here on Yelp. Is it amazing? My fiancée (who ordered it) says no. But it's good. It tastes like a blueberry muffin with some ice cream on top. \\n\\nOverall, my meal was disappointing while my fiancée's was great and my sister-in-law's was decent. 3.4 stars.

Chips and salsa come out fast. They don't have a liquor license, so no cerveza, which is too bad. There is a HUGE tv on the wall that was blaring some A&E doc about whether wrasslin' was real (spoiler: it's not)- since I was the only one in the place, I let the waiter watch his TV and just tuned it out, but atmosphere it ain't.\\n\\nI was feeling hungry and unimaginative, so I went with chicken enchiladas rojas. One nice touch is that they came out with plenty of delicious queso on top, in addition to the standard shredded/melted cheese. The chicken was kinda weird- it wasn't really shredded that much, just huge chunks. Nice mix of dark and white meat though- there's nothing worse than an enchilada full of dry white meat. Good flavor, though. The rice and beans were completely standard- the beans were more of the \\"glue\\" than the \\"soup\\" texture. \\n\\nOne big disappointment- the chips totally sucked. They were made on premises, but had been sitting around for a while so they were super oily and chewy.

I'm not normally a fan of restaurants bumped out of a corner of a mediocre hotel but this was a hidden gem and I'll definitely go back.\\n\\nThe dining room is plush with comfy & roomy high-top booths and tables. Granite slab table-tops, hardwoods, nice lighting and tasteful decorations make for great ambiance. Unfortunately, the door to the hotel was jacked open all night, presumably to entice hotel guests in, but this took away from the environment of the dining room. The restaurant is next to the pool and seeing kids walk by in bathing suits and towels, and random people peering in all night was off-putting.\\n\\nThe \\"Frito Misto\\" appetizer was stellar with perfectly cooked scallops, shrimp and calamari served with grilled french bread oozing with flavor: buttery, garlicky goodness.\\n\\nEntrees were very good too with lamb chops cooked perfect medium-rare as ordered and surf & turf special consisting of two jumbo steak tips (great flavor but not the best piece of meat) and lobster. (Half tail and jumbo claw: cooked perfectly but served without drawn butter?)\\n\\nThe onion rings side order were some of the best onion rings I have ever had. My previous favorites were Arnold's Seafood on Cape Cod but these were thin, crunchy, flavorful and perfectly cooked. \\n\\nService was great too. Our server was extremely professional (tough to find these days really) with an eagerness to please.\\n\\nMinor bonus points for the stellar glassware.

Nope, they don't carry it & counter minion didn't have the service skills to say even \\"yeah sorry\\". That was below him. And this was how it went. Ladies making sandwiches seemed pleasant enough but aloof. Bakery display looks amazing so I'm guessing the bakery is really good. Lastly, the bathroom looked really nice but would it hurt the bottom line to install a jacket/purse hook on the door. Most women do not hold their purse in their lap while they do they're business. It was either that or the not-super-clean floor. I don't know, it costs $6 at Home Depot? Takes 8 minutes to install? That's my impression of Henri's, not going to take an effort.

For some reason she then presented us with a copy of an email where the owner told Enjoy the City he did not want to participate in the 2012 book as if it had something to do with them refusing coupons from the previous year's book.  If they're going to stop taking valid coupons 6 months before they expire, they should, at the very least, put up a sign or something.\\n\\nThe food was OK, but we will not be going back because of the dishonesty.

Yes, I know that Atlanta is not the birthplace of Cajun food.   But ever since I moved out west, I make getting my fill of So Co  (food, not the liquor), my top priority whenever I am below the Mason-Dixon line.  Sure, I could have driven my rental Ford Focus even further from the Perimeter to hit up the ever popular chain, Pappadeaux, in Suburbia, GA.  (Had it been Tuesday or Wednesday, I would have strongly considered it since they have a rockin' boiled crawfish deal right now on those days).  However, I turned to Chowhound for real answers, and found myself searching for a place named French Quarter Too.  Apparently the name has now changed to Beyond The Bayou, but the location is the same and the menu is definitely Cajun--po'boys, gumbo, alligator, jambalaya, Abita, etc.  I had a cup of gumbo to start...dark and spicy...reminiscent of my old college friend's family's recipe.  I was torn between entree decisions: oyster po'boy or shrimp and grits.  I went for the shrimp and cheese grits...very flavorful, but I wish they had given me more shrimp instead of so many tomatoes, peppers, and onions in the sauce.  Unfortunately their oven was broken, so dessert wasn't even an option.  :(  The service was genuinely friendly and prompt.  If I were a local, I would definitely make Beyond the Bayou part of my restaurant rotation.

I wished I had gone with a full bowl of the chowder along with the Fire-Cracker Shrimp (stir fried shrimp, rice noodles, napa, crushed peanuts, more....) but that's a reason to return.\\n\\nThe restaurant was nearly empty as it just opened a week ago, overall the food was good, service was excellent.\\n\\nThe menu looks interesting and I look forward to returning often."},{"name":"Barlata Tapas Bar","address":"1500 S Lamar Blvd, Ste 150","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Yum yum yum!

Definitely a must try if your staying at the domain.. we had the corn, queso and three different types of tacos; picnic chicken, shrimp n grits, and fish. The corn is perfectly cooked on the grill and has the right amount of everything; cheese, hot sauce, and cream. It's a great side dish for two. The queso has three main ingredients which are curry, coconut and cheese :) I'm surprised on how all three ingredients are well balanced and not one over powers the other. My favorite taco was the fish. The fish was cooked perfectly and it had the perfect amount. I like how every bite there was fish because not many taco places add enough fish in the taco. There was a drizzle of curry sauce on it which gave it an interesting flavor. Second best was shrimp and grits taco. It was seasoned just right and the amount of grits was not overwhelming it was perfectly balanced. Last but not least was the picnic chicken. The chicken was juicy and full of flavor and had a good sauce to it. Overall this place is great and has a good vibe to it.

The place where I felt they fell short was the pizza crust, it was doughy with no hint of it being crispy at all. This is really their only short coming, but when it comes to pizza, crust is everything. In fairness, I felt the same way about Blaze when they opened, crust too doughy, having gone back there, it seems they improved it significantly, so hopefully for Pie Five, it's just a growing pain and something they just need to optimize, cooking time and temperature etc."},{"name":"Pisces Rising","address":"239 W 4th Ave","city":"Mount Dora","stars":"3.5","text":"Salad was heavy with arugula would have prefer a blend of lettuces \\nSalmon was delicious with the wild rice and quinoa mix"},{"name":"Mattie's","address":"811 W Live Oak St","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"We booked a table for four on Tuesday evening and were seated upstairs.

Just an amazing, beautiful, cozy, and delicious restaurant.  Where do I begin.  Their motto on the menu reads, \\"Where the Hospitality and Cuisine of the Pacific Northwest Come Alive!\\".  They are spot on with that statement.  The restaurant is located in Disney's Wilderness Lodge Resort which is one of my favorite places to stay when down there.  Going into the meal I had very high expectations as Artist Point is one of the pricier restaurants on property. \\n\\nAtmosphere: High ceilings, big windows overlooking the pool, lake, and trees, and beautiful artwork and murals around the restaurant.  Easily one of the prettiest places I have ever eaten.  The space is cozy and intimate despite the very high ceilings.  \\n\\nFood and Waitress: I finally know what a Disney Signature Restaurant is.  Sure it is the atmosphere but the wait staff as well as the food make this place stellar.  Everyone at Disney World is nice.  Even the janitors have big smiles on their faces.  But our waitress was a step above the normal cast member at Disney World.  She made this meal special for my family and I.  Our waitress gave us a hard sell on the portobello soup but we declined since the entrees are quite pricey.  For our meals my parents each got the Swordfish and Buffalo respectively while I decided on their famous Cedar Plank Salmon.  So we talked and drank and it had been awhile since we ordered food.  A few minutes later our waitress comes out with three tiny cups of the portobello soup because she wanted us to \\"try it out\\".  I was not that dumb, Disney is not the company or place to just give you something free!  The kitchen was obviously behind and the soup was a nice touch.  This was definitely a \\"signature\\" move.  And the soup was killer; creamy, and just awesome.\\n\\nOur food finally came and my salmon was terrific and actually served on a cedar plank.  Best salmon I have had.  I also tried a bit of my mother's buffalo after I got over the fact it was buffalo.  It was a very dense meat, unlike the steaks and chicken we are accustomed to.  It was very tasty but a little too chewy for me.  It came three ways: in mac and cheese, a steak, and a sausage.  All were unique and good.\\n\\nTo conclude our meal, our waitress tried selling us dessert but we were all stuffed from our amazing meals.  As a Disney Signature of course, she brought out one final special touch; three glasses of champagne to conclude the meal.\\n\\nFinal Thoughts:  Amazing atmosphere, stellar food, and world class service if you can afford it.  This is the only Disney Signature meal I have had and I really do want to try more next time I visit.  5+ Stars."},{"name":"Corner Bakery Cafe","address":"19325 NW Emma Way","city":"Hillsboro","stars":"3.5","text":"Think of the Corner Bakery Cafe as a deluxe version of Panera Bread.

The legion of my friends who are diehard and rabid for Four Rivers will freaking lasso me when they find me, dump me in the smoker over there at either 4R locations, and 12 hours later, tear me apart like pulled pork!  Seriously, guys - like Brandi says, one doesn't have to be snobbish about BBQ, and there's room enough for all.  Plus, I can't abide the lines at 4R - guess I just don't care enough about food, but nothing is THAT good that I have to wait 30 minutes to hand them over my hard-earned money.  4R should just go ahead and jack up the price until the lines thin out, or offer variable pricing (cheaper before 11 and after 3...)  It's simple supply and demand: customer service will improve, and water will seek its own level.\\n\\nOh this review is about SMOKEY BONES??  Oh right, right... got side-tracked.  Back to SB: other than finding their rib portions on the small side, and the BBQ sauce a touch sweet, I think the quality of the food's been pretty good.  I'm usually surprised by how tasty and moist the chicken breasts are, and the brisket is beefy.  The sausage is a little spicy for the unwary.  Among the sides, the usual fan favorites like mac n cheese and mashed potatoes are both too calorie-laden.  I think I like the beans and fire-roasted corn the best.\\n\\nBeer lovers: they have a signature lager that I've got to try one of these days - $3 for a 22 oz. pour.

I hate how some even dare charge above 10 for a plate of meat. This is why I like Hotpot Buffet in Chinatown. The place opened up pretty recently, taking over what I recall to be a restaurant called Imperial Seafood. \\n\\nI've been here twice so far.\\n\\nThe first time with my eldest brother and boyfriend. Boy, was it hectic in there. We walked in the door to dozens of Chinese people hovering around the host's counter while the hosts were running around trying to get everyone seated. They really make do with what they have and try to squeeze in people wherever they can. The host gave us a table for two although there were three of us and the table was REALLY just meant for two. I didn't care too much. I actually thought the host was being efficient.  How much can we order anyway? Right? \\n\\nWell... \\n\\nThey gave us a sheet to check off whatever we wanted. We selected: \\nAll cuts of beef\\nAll cuts of lamb\\nAll cuts of beef tongue \\nAlmost all the balls: shrimp, cuttlefish,fish,pork,beef\\nAlmost all of the veggies: watercress, tong ho, bok choy, pumpkin \\nA lot of seafood: shrimp, crab legs, white fish, flounder filet, salmon clams \\n\\n okay we were super hungry and we chowed down on whatever came first. we had two broths (mala and chinese herbal). First came the seafood and vegetables. we finished almost the entire massive plate (they put it all on one big plate instead of a million individual tiny ones smart & practical). We were wondering where our cuts of meat were so we asked our waitress.She wasn't really sure and was kind of lost herself. So she told us it was busy and we should wait a while. So we waited longer. Its an hour into the meal and still no meats! So we asked once again and she suggested we fill out another sheet since they might have lost our original order. So we fill out everything we were missing and more! More seafood and more vegetables come out so we really nagged the waitress about our meat and alas two plates of meats came out. But its funny because we ordered at least six different cuts. So we asked AGAIN!  So the  waitress goes back into the kitchen and out comes the meat! voila. Tons and tons of meat. So we dug into our food. After a while we realized they never gave us the Tong ho veggie that my bf really wanted. So we bugged more people again about or order. the waitress goes back and out comes two giant plates of food. They looked kind of famliar, hmm could it be? It was the very first sheet that we filled out. This time they brought everything we order the first time out once again! Holy crap! What happens now? We were trying to explain that we only wanted the Tong Ho veggies and no more seafood and meat. so the waitress finally tells us that they ran out of those veggies. darn! We ended up stuffing ourselves with the rest of the food that came out. \\n\\nThe service was good because she really tried to find out what was going on for us and kept trying to give us all the food we wanted, but the confusion in the kitchen was so bad! Quality of food was decent so its A-OK for the amount you get and the money you pay.

I had to ask for tortillas to fill me up as it hardly any chicken, overly spiced you could barely taste the tomato or chocolate and the chunks of tomatoe skin, just horrible!

As my entree, I tried the strawberry pecan salad.  It was really fresh and tasted great.  My husband tried one of the flatbreads, and it was also really good.

You use laminated menus to mark what you want and the quantity of each.  But the pricing is OFF THE CHARTS.  $3.95 for ONE pork bun,  and over $4 for any item that comes with 2 small pieces.  I mean, come on - this is AUSTIN, and this certainly isn't sushi.  My total was $69 - and the food tasted horrible.  Extremely greasy, starchy, LOTS of filler with very little meat/vegetable, and nearly everything was bathed in salt.

I tried 5 different restaurants and it took about 2 hours in total due to the long lines. My absolute favorite was Another Broken Egg Cafe's Fried Green Tomato BLT. It was my last stop and I'm glad because it was the yummiest taste left in my mouth when I left. I had Nana G's chicken and waffles which was really good. I liked the waffle more than the chicken, but that's because they had bacon in the waffles .  My next favorite was Dominic's NY pepperoni pizza. They were charging $4 instead of $3 and I'm not sure why, but whatever. The slices were a decent size ad it was good so I didn't make a fuss about it. Chef Marcee served red Velvet French Toast. I thought the flavor was good, but I have to get another taste while it's hot. It was really sweet and I didn't think it needed any syrup. Very good eats! Now for my least favorite: Bar Margot and Babalu. I got the duck confit chorizo and potato hash cake. It wasn't that it wasn't good, it was just such a small portion I really didn't get a really good taste of it. I will stop by their restaurant and give them another shot tho. Babalu's breakfast empanada was kind or boring to me. I expected a lot more flavor than I got ad I thought it was kind of dry. Given that they were bite size samples may have been the reason, but eh I don't think it's worth a visit for. I wish I would've tried the avocado toast. That looked good and definitely worth a visit. All in all, I thought it was a great event. There was plenty of booze and free water was passed out. The weather was great and I was thankful I got out of there before it rained.

Husband went for the Pork Platter, I went for the Venison, friends went with the burger and Steak Frites.\\n\\nThe presentation of the food was flawless, but the flavors were even better. The pork platter was so well done that the flavors were oozing out under my nose as it was being placed on the table. The variety was pretty amazing too! My venison was cooked perfectly (this was my first time having venison and Husband and friends whom have ALL had it before said that it was cooked even better than the ones they've had), but I wish there was just a little bit MORE.

No interesting spices.  just kind of bland. \\n\\nI had ordered the chicken addition ($3 more).

Thanks to Christin K's suggestion, we came up with this place.  None of us had been, so we were all excited.  I mean, this helps us with our review counts, eh?\\n\\nIt was only a block walk, and when we got there, it wasn't too crowded.  The first thing I noticed was the patio area- looked awesome!  Long metal benches, fountains, and an open bar as well.\\n\\nIt is a counter order then bring food to ya deal.  So we all got menus and studied em.  Drinks on one side, food on the other.  As the name of the restaurant implies, everything is named after some sort of whateveryouwannacallit.  The items looked spotty- with nothing really looking like it would hit out of the ballpark.  No fries here or anything like that.  Salads, noodles, and sandwiches.  The sandwiches are served on 8 inch buns.\\n\\nI ended up getting I think the Montgomery Burns, the most expensive food item at $15.  I wanted to see what a sandwich of that price would do to my palette.  I also ordered some kind of iron drink (forgot what the whole name was). I also ordered a fountain drink.  I got a cone with a number, and my drink shortly came out, and so did my sandwich.  The food does come out quickly here!\\n\\nI tell you what, my palette was sure pissed off when I bit into that sandwich.  It consisted of shaved ribeye, and a horseradish brie.  I have not been a fan of horseradish, but I am trying to slowly eat more of it (hell, I finally started to enjoy mustard now!).  The cheese was the best part about it.  Unfortunately, the $15 sandwich literally tasted like meat, cheese with a kick, and bread.  The meat was juicy, but it was bland- as it tasted like it was never seasoned.  Bummer.\\n\\nOn the other hand, my drink (which was rimmed with a chili-salt) was pretty damn tasty.  I liked the rimjob (hehe) on it- complimented it well.  Since I was driving back to Memphis that night, I only had one- easily could have downed 5-6 more.\\n\\nAt the counter, they had dessert pushpops made by Sublime Donuts (hell yea!).  They had strawberry mango and chocolate peanut butter, @ 3$ a pop (pun intended).  I ended up buying them by the hordes.  The cashier realized I never got my fountain drink from earlier, so she knocked the price off of one of the pops.  Hell yea.  The pops were yummy!  I would say they were equally tasty- but the chocoPB tasted just like a reeses cup :)\\n\\nIt was time to then doll up and check out the restroom.  I like how the walls were painted like green ooze is pouring out of them (something I really want to think about when I am in a bathroom).  But they were clean.  The light fixtures in there were industrial and cool- I had not seen lights like that before.  Thankfully I didn't get attacked by a villain when I was in the restroom.\\n\\nIn the end, I got to spend some time with 7 special people and I enjoyed their company.  I think we all came upon the conclusion that this place is a great hang out spot for drinks, but do not get hung up on the food.  Hell, at least they have popsicles- but they also usually have King of Pops out front too (earlier in the day, at least)."},{"name":"Tin Shed Garden Cafe","address":"1438 NE Alberta St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"I love the self serve coffee.

No need to return.\\nWent there for lunch with a friend. It was a gorgeous day out but the restaurant was not crowded. We wanted to eat inside but the TVs were so freakin' loud, we could not hear one another talk. We waited over 5 minutes for the hostess to appear, and when that didn't happen, we went & found her. We were seated outside in the direct sun. While there was a covered section on the back patio, there were no tables set up there for people who found the sun too strong. There were no umbrellas on the patio tables, so the sun heated the surface of the metal tables so much that they became uncomfortable to the touch. (It also melted the ice in our drinks, so they became luke-warm very quickly, which is not very refreshing in hot weather.) We waited about 10 minutes for our server, who did not bring us menus. She came over, without a smile & asked us if we knew what we wanted. My friend suggested menus, and she left without even asking if we wanted anything to drink. We placed our order several minutes later with the still unsmiling server, and it took about 30-35 minutes for our food to arrive. When the food arrived, we asked for our drinks again. No one returned to the table with the drinks. Five minutes later, our server stopped by to see how our meal was and we asked for them a third time. Still, it took at least another 5 minutes for them to arrive. The server station was about a 30 second walk from our table, so I don't understand why there was such a problem with our request. Meanwhile, a nearby table nearby had arrived after us, ordered & received cocktails 15-20 minutes before our drinks arrived. Food was good, but nothing fantastic.

I have no idea why so many shops in Massachusetts seem to ignore this point.  Just focus on the customer.  If they want water, bring them water.  Be courteous, be kind.  If they don't like the food, ask why and learn from your mistake.  Sometimes you'll get a wonky customer.  You'll know them when you see them, so just work to get them out as soon as practical, and don't inflict your anger on everyone else. Your server(s), by the way, get this but I'm afraid the managers dont. \\n\\nSecond, advertise honestly and clearly, and honor your mistakes.  If you don't like groupon, then dont use it.  \\n\\nThird, advertise broadly!  Too many great restaurants in this area go under because they act as though everyone knows they exist.  That's not true!  \\n\\nFourth, look at what works in your neighborhood.  Tenoch is the shining example of how to run a restaurant in Medford square.  GREAT food, low cost.  You could be that as well, and you even have a shot at generating an awesome dining atmosphere! \\n\\nGood luck Carrol's.

The French Onion Soup was delicious, good bread and melted cheese - pretty hard to argue with that.

It made it so that each of our dishes had some sort of substitution on it, and another dish didn't arrive until long after the others. A waitress sheepishly said the chef was going to the store to get some key ingredients to finish up our meals.\\n\\nAnd again, the food is not that flavorful. \\n\\nThe drinks are great, though! The signature cocktails are flavorful and appropriately strong. They have an okay wine list with some good specials. \\n\\nAll in all, I debated between two and three stars. But the food is edible (my husband says that's a debatable point since he thinks he got food poisoning after eating a really terrible chicken club) so I kicked it up to three.\\n\\nSo, if you're there for drinks and appies, that's awesome! Especially since they do have a great patio that's open year-round, is heated, and HAS BLANKETS!!

The restaurant was formerly the fledgling Sakura Stix, also a Japanese steakhouse and sushi bar.  New ownership took over, renovated the old Sakura space, and have revitalized the business.  Yoi Yoi is located in the Howell Mill Village shopping center, where Publix is located, near the intersection of Howell Mill Rd. and Collier Rd.\\n\\nThis is a relatively popular neighborhood restaurant.  It's one of the only places (perhaps the only place) to get real sushi in the area.  Many customers like to order take-out or delivery.  Online ordering is available.  I admire what the new owners have done, rebranding the place and putting more emphasis on sushi.  One of the owners, David, is the head sushi chef.  As he works away behind the sushi bar, he's often the first to greet customers as they enter the restaurant.\\n\\nThe atmosphere is casual.  The interior is Asian-themed with small waterfalls, Japanese paper lanterns, and bamboo at almost every table.  It also feels loft-like with exposed ductwork above.  The walls towards the kitchen and restrooms are covered in wallpaper made from Japanese newspaper.  If you look closely, the newspaper looks to be from Atlanta as you'll see ads for local businesses such as another Atlanta area Japanese restaurant, Umezono in Smyrna (now I Love Sushi).  The sushi bar has two flatscreen TVs so you can hang out at the bar and watch TV.\\n\\nIn addition to sushi, Yoi Yoi serves hibachi dishes.  Unlike a stereotypical Japanese steakhouse such as Benihana, there are no teppanyaki grills and chefs in the dining room here.  All of the hibachi foods are cooked behind closed doors in the kitchen.  Hibachi proteins include chicken, shrimp, steak, salmon, scallops, and calamari.\\n\\nYou can order bento boxes which are box-shaped containers with different compartments filled with various foods.  For example, one bento box may contain salad, sushi, a spring roll, rice or noodles, and teriyaki chicken.\\n\\nFor hibachi, I think prices are generally in line with, if not better than, other teppanyaki restaurants.  You can get a hibachi dinner or bento box for less than $15 per person here.  Some Japanese steakhouses charge $20 or more.  Sushi prices are comparable to other sit-down sushi restaurants.  Basic rolls are under $10 each and special, more \\"extravagant\\" rolls are as much as $15 per.  The restaurant has affordable lunch specials too.\\n\\nMy favorite is the nigiri sushi.  They serve all the standard nigiri and then some, priced around $2 for one piece.  The best deals are on the $4 uni (sea urchin), toro (fatty tuna), and ama ebi (shrimp with head).  I'm not aware of any specials on nigiri and wish they had some.\\n\\nI've tried a fair amount of Yoi Yoi's nigiri and overall, it's A-OK.  It's fresh and satisfying.  It's hard to go wrong with almost any of the selections.  I like to get assorted nigiri and prefer the egg omelet (tamago), striped bass, albacore tuna, fresh salmon, white tuna, mackerel (saba), smelt roe (masago), octopus (tako), tuna (maguro), yellowtail, eel (unagi), scallop, uni, and toro.  I like my nigiri simple and \\"pure\\" and tend to stay away from options such as smoked white tuna and smoked salmon.  I like how the unaltered, non-smoked fish taste.\\n\\nSome notes/observations: The tamago is a bit sweet.  The saba has a significantly different flavor and texture than the rest of the fish.  It's not as soft and has more of a chew and pasty consistency to it.  It's got more of a briny taste.  I still like it, though.  Masago nigiri contains tiny little bright orange fish eggs.  I've found the tako to be tougher and bit more rubbery here -- octopus is supposed to be this way, but I've found Yoi Yoi's to exude these characteristics even more so.\\n\\nThe unagi is not bad, but it doesn't seem to have enough sauce and almost tastes dry.  The uni and toro are good, but I can notice a difference in quality between them and their more expensive counterparts at a higher-end or more authentic sushi restaurant.  The uni, in particular, tastes slightly more fishy.  Keep in mind these are all nitpicks and I wouldn't hesitate ordering these nigiri when dining here.  I don't recommend ordering them for carry-out or delivery, however.\\n\\nIf I had to recommend a sushi roll, I'd suggest the Hawaii Roll.  It consists of tuna, salmon, yellowtail, avocado, cucumber, tobiko, and a soybean \\"seaweed\\" wrap.  Instead of rolled seaweed, a soybean skin is used.  It's different.\\n\\nPresentation of dishes is great.\\n\\nService is outstanding.  Co-owner Eeleen also works as hostess and server.  I think the servers do an excellent job making sure everyone is happy and taken care of."},{"name":"The Ravenous Pig","address":"565 W Fairbanks Ave","city":"Winter Park","stars":"4","text":"A local favorite.

I have not decided on a conclusive overall rating but at this point have no plans to return to Hudson, at least any time soon.]\\n\\n\\"A Bar Tale\\"\\n\\nThe scene: Hudson Brookhaven, just after opening on a weekday.\\n\\nThe players: CN, her date, and one of the bartenders she knows best.\\n\\nAct 1 . . .CN and date initially don't plan to be there long but have such fun that they stay several hours enjoying bloody mary's etc. Much pleasant exchange with said bartender.\\n\\nAct 2 . . . Date had made it clear he planned to pay for the festivities but realizes he didn't have enough cash since they had run up a bigger than planned tab; he is going to go to ATM and be back. No problem with CN or bartender, though CN does have to leave by 3pm to be somewhere by 4pm and date's bank is one of those annoying only-three-local-branch ones that isn't super close. Date is going to hurry because it's just after 2pm.\\n\\nAct 3 . . .It gets to 3pm and date isn't back. CN has to leave, so she leaves a credit card *just in case* - this is a place she's been known at times to come, oh, five or six days a week so there's no way she's gonna risk stiffing them. Also leaves her beloved laptop as collateral (kind of a joke bc they all tease her about always having it with her!) Bartender is cool with this.\\n\\nAct 4 . . .CN returns late, after midnight. Turns out, date never came back! [That's a whole other story and no, CN will not be seeing him again!!]  CN has $60 cash on her and it turns out she gave them the Visa that had just expired rather than the new one so her card wouldn't go through; she's only carrying one with her these days out of budget-mindedness, so she doesn't have anything else to give them. The tab is close to $90 before tip.\\n\\nAct 5 . . . The manager is a complete ass. When a very embarrassed CN tries to apologize and say she'll be back first thing in the morning with cash or another card - they know she lives down the street, they know how well she always tips, it would seem that based on the fact that a bar stool should practically have her name on it this would be acceptable though not ideal - the manager essentially acts like she's trying to weasel out of a tab. The following conversation ensues:\\n\\n[Manager, CN, and the late shift bartender that CN also knows very well standing at the bar register where bartender is closing out]\\n\\nMGR: \\"You don't have any other way to pay?\\"\\nCN: \\"No.\\"\\nMGR: \\"That's all the cash you have, really? And you don't have another card?\\"\\nCN [who is getting more and more embarrassed]: \\"No, I'm sorry, I don't.\\"\\nMGR: \\"We expect our customers to pay their tab every single time they come in. I know you come in a lot, but you have to pay.\\"\\nCN: \\"I'm sorry, it's not something I expected, I always pay my tabs-\\"\\nMGR [interrupts CN, as he's studying her tab]: \\"You aren't this time.\\"\\nCN: \\"Uh, I'm not sure what you want me to say here. I came back tonight because I wanted to make sure this was covered and I didn't realize about the card. I'll be back first thing in the morning, it's really late tonight for me to go home and get a debit card and go to the ATM and-\\"\\nMGR [cutting CN off]: \\"I guess we will let you go this time, but every time from now on you are expected to pay your tab. This is a business.\\"\\nCN [shocked at his tone and total rudeness]: \\"You know, I work in a restaurant, too, and I cannot imagine my manager talking to a regular the way you've just spoken to me. I don't think I'll be back after I settle this tab.\\"\\nMGR: \\"Sorry you feel that way. Hope you have a wonderful night.\\"\\nCN and bartender just look at him.\\n\\nAct 5 . . . CN drives to get money, comes back to restaurant and finds bartender still cleaning up. Apologizes to bartender, who apologizes for her manager's behavior. CN gives enough cash to cover bill and a 30% tip.\\n\\nAct 6 . . .CN doesn't return to Hudson, and she writes a Yelp update.\\n\\nThe End."},{"name":"Mattie's","address":"811 W Live Oak St","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Yummy brunch on Sunday!

Now, the process is streamlined, fast and delicious food will come your way. \\n\\nThis place is not friendly towards first-timers.. I was utterly confused when I walked in on what to do. \\n\\nThe process: \\n\\n1) They greet you from behind the counter\\n2) You are suppose to know that there are paper menus stacked in a pile on this stand and your suppose to grab one\\n3) Pens are provided for you to mark down your choices once you realize why there are stacks of paper next to the pens\\n4) the menu just states the name of the dish , price and you make how many you want OR... you turn it around and there are two combo choices...1 or 2..\\n\\nThe combo..includes two dishes of your choice, house special for the day and for 1 extra dollar you can get a drink\\n\\n5) Once you mark down your choices, which is suppose to be self-explanatory once you read the menu and follow directions, you walk to the counter and pay. They give you a number and tell you to take your seat, the food will arrive shortly.\\n\\n6) Get your drink at the drink fountain along with soy sauce, spicy oil, napkins and chopsticks and find a table or stand during busy hours.\\n\\n7) Within a few minutes, your dim sum is brought to your table in these bamboo streamers and white plates (very classy). \\n\\nEnjoy.

The individual dishes are average pricing $2.5-5 a dish, but the combo saves you a lot of money and you can still get your dim sum. \\n\\nI recommend this place to everyone. It is very roomy and way cheaper than traditional dim sum.  Plus, if you don' t like dim sum...at least you can come into the restaurant with your friends, hang out, buy a drink and not have people always bothering your table about food and giving you funny stares. \\n\\nThe downside...I am so used to seeing food and just pointing that when I have to read the dishes in English...I don't know what I am eating..haha...and okay I am Vietnamese so seriously..when those ladies start to talk to me..I dunno what they are saying...I just look...and node gracefully...\\n\\nAre You Ready?

Note: only one vegetarian item on the main menu and only one non-pork dumpling on the main menu. \\n\\nMy seat in the restaurant gave me prime viewing of the kitchen where I could see Patty herself making our dumplings by hand and on the spot. For those who complain about the wait time, know that it is because the chef is literally making your dumplings to order - - none of this pre-cooked/re-heated garbage, just straight up fresh dumplings. The seasoning of the dumpling meat is excellent and you can distinguish many of the different flavors (unlike the mystery meat that you might as well chew without swallowing). Texture of the dumplings themselves is slightly thicker and slightly doughy, which you either enjoy or hate.  We found 9 dumplings per person would have resulted in the right amount of full-ness (we got ambitious and ordered 12/person - but the thought of reheated dumplings was worse than the prospect of leaving them behind or being a little overly stuffed). \\n\\nOrder the milk tea! Chalk full of tapioca balls and giant straws - a different type of drink to order with your meal that you won't regret. \\n\\nThe TV on the wall is slightly distracting, but meh, whatever when your dumplings arrive you forget everything else all together. \\n\\nDefinitely heading back soon for more, definitely not for a giant group, and definitely not for the impatient."},{"name":"Oppa Sushi","address":"185 Harvard Ave","city":"Boston","stars":"4.5","text":"Oppa sushi is the best sushi restaurant in Allston.

Buca is kind of a mess. I say this in the best way possible. It resembles a maze stuffed with hundreds of people. You'll wait a LONG time to be seated on a weekend. The food is not the best Italian ever, and yes, it's a little pricey. \\n\\nThat being said, I still have a soft spot for Buca. It's one of the best places to go in Columbus when you're looking to accomodate a large group. The food is good enough. For about $20 per person, you'll get to eat an absolutely absurd amount of food. My two favorite things here are the Eggplant Parmesan & the Apple Gorgonzola Salad. Both of them are delicious and will leave you quite satisfied.\\n\\nOverall, I take Buca for what it is: a fun restaurant with decent food.

A foodie friend that I trust referred us, but I wasn't moved by the atmosphere, food, drinks or service.   As a whole, I'd say it was OK - nothing was bad, but nothing was good or great.    Well, I take that back - the specialty drinks leave a lot to be desired - didn't like any that I tried.   They do have a couple beers and a good wine selection though.   \\n\\nThe menu is almost all cold & hot tapas with a selection of 5 or 6 plates (larger items) and maybe 10 paellas.    We tried 3 of the tapas (salt cod, mussels, lamb skewers) - all were fair to decent at best.   We then tried the half chicken, which came out with no bones and had very little flavor.   We wrapped up with a traditional chicken & seafood paella, which was pretty small and was only fair.    \\n\\nThe worst part was the bar staff, who all were acting as if the world was ending.    I understand that they were slammed, and I've worked as a bartender and waiter, but you can't take your issues out on customers or yell at staff right in front of customers.    They were slow and sloppy and generally unimpressive.  \\n\\nThere really isn't any good place to wait for your table (which took twice as long as we were told), so everyone is kinda jammed into the area by the bar.

Nice space, great decor with a hint of Asia, very friendly and attentive waiter (did not stop pouring my water), and everything on the menu looked absolutely delicious. Since it is tapas style, we ordered quite a few plates to share. \\n\\nWe started off with fanny bay oysters, fish sauce, cilantro, lime - this was my favorite dish. Very tasty oysters with Thai-inspired sauce, over a bed of seaweed (yes, it's edible).  The dungeness crab, wakame, nigella, egg, chili flake- however was disappointing. All I could taste was the chili sauce- which was so strong and salty it totally masked the flavor of the crab. We then had the fried broccolini, candied bacon, fish sauce, mint- the candied bacon was delish, but the dish was way too salty and oily. The broccolini was deep fried with too much starch. I requested rice to go with it and that seemed to help. I liked the dashi poached egg, trout roe, mustard greens- again, it was too salty but this time it might have been from the small trout roes. I would have preferred larger salmon roes. It went well with the poached egg and dashi sauce. The chicken lollipops, sriracha mayo- again disappointing, my chicken was still raw inside. Out of the 5 chicken pops, one piece tasted good because there was some ginger on it. I liked the halibut, chrysanthemum, mustard, hon shimejis, lime- my BF thought the mustard was too hot. The fish was perfectly cooked and the mushrooms were tasty. My only complaint would be that the dish was too salty, which seems to be the trend here.\\n\\nWe ended the meal with the house chocolate mousse with whipped cream, their only dessert option. It was good, at least it wasn't salty!\\n\\nOverall, I think they have creative dishes with potential, but it the taste still needs to be perfected. (hint - less salty). Also, it would be nice if there wasn't such a long gap between each dish (they brought out one at a time). \\n\\nI would probably come back and try a few other dishes at some point, and let the waiter know before hand that I have high blood pressure, heart and kidney disease and see if they would lighten up on the salt."},{"name":"Starbucks","address":"265 Peachtree Center Ave","city":"Atlanta","stars":"2.5","text":"I read the reviews and saw the complaints about the wait.

We made a reservation through Open Table approx. a week in advance. The atmosphere was raucous but not too loud. Our waiter (unfortunately I can't remember his name) was extremely knowledgeable about the menu, and all his recommendations were spot-on. The cocktails - though pricey at 12$ a pop - are delicious and strong. The Bacon Old Fashioned was pretty good, as was the Gin and Jam, but the star cocktail was a summer cocktail I never would have picked it out, but the waiter strongly recommended it - absolutely delicious. For food we pretty much jumped around the menu based on the waiters suggestions. I can't remember all the dishes we had, but they were almost all fantastic. IMO the most underwhelming was the Charcuterie plate - the meats and pates were great, the cheeses were so-so, and it only came with 3 small pieces of baguette. We were left eating pungent cheeses and pates without bread! The Gruyere biscuits were - as everyone else says - addictive, and slightly overpriced (and I usually don't like Gruyere). They also ran out of a lot of dishes, but that's understandable as it was peak time on a busy Friday night. Overall, it was a great night, with mostly great food, and fantastic service.\\n\\n----\\n\\nFlash forward a few weeks: Lunch. Our mission for this trip was to try the Burger that everyone raves about (and is always #1 in any Orlando's Top Burgers list). We were seated right away (@12pm Saturday) just as tables started filling up. Our waitress seemed a little less knowledgeable about the menu this time, and was less apt to offer reccomendations. We started with the Deviled Eggs (unique, but meh.) and the Shrimp Tacos - the tacos were the highlight of the meal. The shrimp was perfectly cooked and the batter was light and airy. Highly reccomended. \\n\\nFor entrees we orderd the Po' Boy with porkbelly & shrimp and - of course - the burger (medium-rare). The Po' Boy was fantastic, very flavorful and all the ingredients meshed well. The burger was a disaster. It was *extremely* overcooked - close to well done. The other problem was the flavor profile. All we could taste was very sharp bleu cheese. It completely overwhelmed the dish. The bacon, onion, and beef flavers were completely gone. If you really really like bleu cheese, you might enjoy this - but don't go in expecting to taste the meat. The saving grace of this entire dish was the truffle fries. I typically find most truffle fries *overly* truffly but these had a subtle truffle flavor and were *very* good. I plan to go back during dinner, and try the burger again (maybe it was the \\"2nd-string\\" in the kitchen during lunch), but was let-down on this visit.\\n\\n-------\\n\\nOverall: If you are open to your waiter/ress's recommendations, and don't go in with your heart set on a dish, you will probably enjoy a fantastic meal. There are some misses on the menu, but a lot of hits too."},{"name":"Oppa Sushi","address":"185 Harvard Ave","city":"Boston","stars":"4.5","text":"The management need to be better.

My wife and I went here on Saturday night after making reservations a few hours before. When we went inside, the first difference that we noted was the host stand was further inside than we would normally expect, we had to go past the waiting line and the bar to go check in with the host. It seemed like even though we had made reservations, we would need to wait a few minutes, no big deal. The place itself is pretty small and you can definitely tell the age of the decor. It had pictures of \\"famous\\" people on the bar wall like you see in many restaurants, but the only one that I recognized was Michael Imperioli from the Sopranos. Of course, this may just be my ignorance of the others. The place was packed and had a few people waiting as well.\\nMy wife ordered a glass of wine at the bar, but the service at the bar seemed very inattentive. The bartender did not seem to acknowledge the presence of any customers besides those that she was currently serving, no glance over at the others or any type of \\"I'll be right with you\\" or any such notification that we existed. Of course, once she took the order, she obtained the wine quickly. However, once the host came to seat us, we waited at least 10 minutes to close the tab. When the host came back to see if we had closed, I sent my wife along with him to get the table while I proceeded to wait another 10 minutes without success. I don't really know how the bartender did not see me or my credit card waiting to pay. She was taking payment from other customers as well as arranging glasses and seeming to arrange checks for diners as well. Probably for 90% of the time, she had her back to her customers at the bar. I'm a pretty patient guy, but this was pretty ridiculous. Finally, the host came back and took me to our table and said he'd take care of closing our tab at the bar. All for one glass of wine!\\nI am able to compartmentalize well, so I put that experience out my mind. We were seated at a table close to the kitchen. Considering that the place was pretty crowded, I didn't mind. There were already some garlic bread slices at the table which were very good. It was toasted well and had a good amount of garlic and olive oil. There was also a plate of pickled vegetables which was fine, depending on your taste. It took a little while for a server to come take our order, but it gave us time to decide what to get. My wife had already decided on the pasta Alfredo and I ordered one of the raviolis along with the fried mozzarella and a glass of wine for myself. The fried mozzarella came out very quickly and was very well done. The mozzarella wasn't breaded too much and the marinara that was on top was well spiced. Of course, the server had forgotten to give my wine order at the bar and so I had to get his attention to remind him. The entrees came out in a reasonable amount of time though. I had a taste of the pasta alfredo and it was really good, it was the right amount of rich and creamy, yet was not bland either. I'm not usually a alfredo sauce fan, but this one was among the best I've had. My ravioli was also pretty good, it had lots of artichokes and there were enough ravioli pieces to satisfy. This wasn't one of those ravioli dishes where you get only 4 pieces so I was happy.\\nBy this time, the service was improving somewhat. A different server came by now and then to check on us so we ended up ordering the mousse of the day which was chocolate and a cappuccino. These came out very quickly. The mousse was good, but way bigger than I expected and almost more like a cake than a mousse. The cappuccino was only so-so.\\nAll in all, like I said at the beginning, the food would be the only reason I went back. Maybe it's better when it's less crowded, but I don't know if the food was good enough to overcome our bad service experience to convince us to go back."},{"name":"Yi Soon Bakery","address":"112 Brighton Ave","city":"Allston","stars":"4","text":"Why yes, I am a fan (when I'm in the neighborhood)!\\n\\nI like how there are sweet, nice girls working there that as soon as you come in, they greet you, and eventually ask if you need help looking for something or explain what's in a certain pastry.\\n\\nI recently had they egg and ham bun, and that was delicious.

We arrived at 8pm on a Weds night to about a half full dining room. We chose to eat outside because of the nice weather.  Sitting on one of the elevated sidewalks overlooking 13th street, we also enjoyed the passing street traffic, mostly pedestrian. \\nWe started with a couple of drinks from the limited cocktail menu which seemed to emphasize easy drinking fro fro drinkgs which aren't our favs. I had a grapefruit, gin and something else. It was very drinkable but nothing outstanding. the other drink we ordred was the only interesting one on the menu: drambuie, orange peel, cognac, lemon and something else. It tasted more like an after dinner drink, however.\\nOur waiter was very friendly but clearly just leanring his job. He didn't know the cheese on the beet appetizer (but it was listed on the menu, so we didn't really care) and he spent a lot of his time chatting with a buddy at a nearby table. We like to be served slowly, so we didn't mind but if you wanted quicker service this might have been very irritating. let me get the two other complaints out of the way and then I can focus on what we did like: french fries were lousy--seemed old and they kept setting our used silverware back down on the wrought iron table which just seemed dirty. Either get a napkin to set them on or bring me new silverware.\\nThe food though was quite good: our beet appetizer stated it was salt roasted (we couldn't taste any salt) but the tomme cheese and arugula with an orange glaze was quite tasty. The salad with bacon bits and English peas was quite tasty even with the subsitute dressing of thousand island (which was more like a french dressing). The salad comes with bleu cheese but we didn't want that. They were happy to accomodate the change. Our mains included the boar ribs which were outstanding. The undercooked baked beans were still very flavorful rich with maple and spice. Even the potato salad was flavorful, a large serving with hard cooked eggs, green onions and mayo.  The other entree was a combination of two of their four sliders and the fries. The sliders included a hawaiian version with kobe beef, pineapple and ham. The beef itself was quite thin and could have been juicier but the grilled pineapple was a tasty accompaniment.  The other was called a \\"roscoe\\" and included fried chicken between waffles. The best part of tihs was the spicy mustard that came with it.  We ate almost all this food (except for tthe sub par fries).

First, there is no maid service whatsoever, and a total BS explanation is provided on a notecard in every room which states that that this is an effort to be eco-friendly. Really? Being eco-friendly requires not making guests' beds at all, even if the same sheets are used? Give me a break. That's not being eco-friendly; that's just being cheap. Please don't insult your guests' intelligence by misrepresenting your plainly obvious rationale. To me, it doesn't matter if I can *request* maid service when you've initially chosen not to provide it for budgetary reasons, while falsely claiming environmental benevolence as your rationale. I resent the deceit and presumption that guests aren't perceptive enough to recognize it as such.\\n\\nSecond, for the interior facing rooms with windows overlooking the atrium, there are no exterior windows, which isn't that unusual, but this hotel adds insult to injury by not equipping these rooms with overhead ceiling lights, and the lamps are all quite dim.. So, not only is there no natural light unless you are ok exposing your room to the entire atrium, to have any reasonable amount of dim light, you have to make a lap around your room to turn on 7 or 8 different lamps. But even then the room remains dark and depressing. No one comes to Florida with the intention of staying in a dark and dreary hotel room.\\n\\nThird, the powdered eggs at the breakfast buffet are runny and disgusting. I never want a buffet if it involves inferior quality food. Also, it is equally offensive that you provide what are tantamount to shot glasses for the orange and cranberry juice, clearly to deter guests from drinking as much juice as they would like. No restaurant with table service would ever in a million years serve juice in glasses so small, so what would make it ok to do so in a buffet, where the only way to get a normal serving of juice is to walk back to the buffet three or four times?\\n\\nThe bottom line here is that this hotel cuts corners for budgetary reasons in extremely customer-unfriendly ways. Although the building is nice and the staff is friendly, the policies are the pluperfect opposite. I will never stay here again without confirmation that there have been real changes made."},{"name":"Top Shanghai Cuisine Restaurant","address":"120-8100 Ackroyd Road","city":"Richmond","stars":"3.5","text":"I'm giving the super star for the pork shanghai dumplings I couldn't help burning my mouth on.

I've visited this location many times to watch NBA and college basketball games.  The only differences between the two locations are more space and free parking (as opposed to valet) at the Brookhaven location.\\n\\nThe menus at both locations are the same -- standard bar fare (salads, wings, burgers, sandwiches, hot dogs, etc.) and over 50 beers on tap.  The wings and burgers here are decent.  Try their Maker's Mark burger, which contains Maker's Mark Bourbon BBQ sauce, bacon, and crispy onions.  It's large, cooked-to-order, and the onions are nice and crispy.  While the food is average, I come here primarily to unwind and watch sports.\\n\\nI used to prefer the Midtown Hudson Grille to this one, but this location has grown on me.  I do like how it's generally less crowded and has a more laid back feel to it.  Inside, there are plenty of TVs with multiple feeds, making this a great place to watch games.  There are two main areas inside: the bar with high-top tables and booths surrounding and a longer, more traditional restaurant-style area with regular tables and booths.  No matter where you sit, you'll have several TVs around you.  I've yet to venture out to the patio.\\n\\nAs expected of any good sports bar, they carry many premium sports channels and packages including ESPNU, NBA TV, and NBA League Pass.  Since they have League Pass, they carry *every* NBA game during the regular season.  During the first round of the playoffs, I came here to watch the Spurs' Games 2 and 5 against the Memphis Grizzlies.  These two games of the series were only available on NBA TV, a channel I don't have at home.

I am unsure what origin the owner is, but every person who has had these drinks will tell you that the condense milk is truly what makes the drink.

I ordered an herbal iced tea and asked if it was sweetened and the answer I received was, \\"Um, I don't think so.\\"  I ordered it in the hopes that the girl was positive on her hunch though very annoyed that she didn't know and couldn't be bothered to ask anyone preparing the drinks.  The tea certainly tasted sweetened to me!\\n\\nWayfinding: your order can come from either side of the bar.  Not sure which? Yeah, me either.  If it correlates to the side in which you ordered from, call me dumb but I've never made that connection.  Signage or communication from the person at the register would be helpful.  I don't need a surly look from an employee when I try to pick up the wrong drink because when my name was called I walked to the wrong side of the espresso bar.\\n\\nPrice: one large iced tea, one large iced coffee and a very small muffin cost me $11.

The fried pickles and mac and cheese on the menu might have been enough to seal the deal.  \\n\\nYou'll quickly forget about the patio space in the face of a combination of the following: (1) stale, soggy, mediocre food at worst, thoroughly unspectacular at best; (2) slow, sometimes unfriendly service from hostesses and bartenders; (3) a crowd that usually features a more than normal number of \\"professional\\" male students (too good for the typical student bars, but can't afford to hang out at Towne across the street yet) who are unsurprisingly giant d-bags.

Especially when you know them - Lucy is one of the sweetest, kindest folks you'll meet.

I don't give a lot of 5 stars, so when I do it's real. Vij's has taken Indian cuisine and totally redesigned it for a classy, upscale, and diverse audience. Be prepared to have your mind blown away here, from the initial seating to the service to the food. A+ experience. \\n\\nThis restaurant is pretty expansive and gets BUSY. I've been here on numerous occasions and sometimes have had to wait an hour for a table. Luckily, they have a cozy waiting area with appetizers and drinks that you can order. \\n\\nThe servers here all seem very passionate about the food and dining experience, so you know that you're being well taken care of. The menu is very carefully thought out and caters to a diversity of palates. Everyone in your group will find something on the menu they love. \\n\\nThey recommend ordering family style, so ordering a bunch of dishes to share across the table. Entrees can be ordered in regular size portions (~$30) or half size portions for $18. The serving sizes here are not ginormous as expected, but it's nice to get a flavor of multiple dishes in family style sharing. \\n\\nI have tried basically every vegetarian dish/item on the menu here, as well as multiple non-veg dishes. Vij's rotates his menu occasionally so you never get bored, but the classic favorites always stay on the menu. Those lamb popsicles. Mmm. The goat curry is a little watery for my liking. \\n\\nIf you come here looking for an ordinary Indian meal, you'll be disappointed. Everything here is unique and can't be found at other Indian restaurants. That's what's so great about it. Vegetarian dishes include jackfruit, portobello mushroom, koftas, layered paneer dishes, and more. My favorite non-veg dishes include the sablefish in tomato curry and the lamb popsicles marinated in wine in a fenugreek cream curry. Everything is just bursting with flavor and screams \\"Indian food redefined.\\" \\n\\nNote: Vij's curries are a little thinner in general compared to most Indian restaurants. Doesn't take away from the flavor most of the time, but makes them better suited to eat in rice than with naan. \\n\\nA lot of Yelpers complain about the price here. I get it, $30 for a curry is high especially when other Indian restaurants serve larger portion curries for $12. However, the dishes here are all so different! You're paying for upscale dining here, so be prepared to dish out. Like the service here is top notch. One time my server heard us quietly say the food was a bit spicy and within seconds he brought out yogurt for the table. Super attentive and shows that the restaurant clearly cares about customers. \\n\\nMy one complaint is that they no longer serve unlimited rice and naan with the food for free.

They didn't have a beef version available, so I had the eggplant.  \\n\\nFirst the positives:\\n\\n- They used a good amount of true holy basil, instead of the North American sweet basil many places substitute.\\n\\n- They minced the bird chilli pepper nicely and had a good level of heat.\\n\\n- The sauce was nicely balanced between the heat from the chillies, salt from the fish sauce, and sweetness from both sugar and the eggplants.\\n\\nRoom for improvement:\\n\\n- The rice served was a low quality.  It detracted from the excellent balance they had with the grapow.  \\n\\n- The mixed greens they served were a small handful of the type you get at a grocer with no dressing at all.  Just the greens.  Some were wilted.  They were a distraction.\\n\\n- They put two deep fried wonton crisps on top which were overly greasy and didn't have much flavour.  \\n\\nSo overall it seems like they can get good flavours on the main part of the dish (which is no small feat!), and now just need to get the rest of the plate in order to move on up.

We have often contemplated visiting Polaris Grill, since we see it as we head to the mall. We decided the next time we do not have our kids with us we would go. I normally review new places, but felt the exterior from the highway, location and the word \\"grill\\" would be a suitable place for an afternoon lunch.\\n\\nBoy, were we mistaken. The exterior as you get closer is very old and not well kept. Once we went inside, there was a musty smell, that resonates with an older building. The hostess was nice, but had over applied make up and attempted to look years younger than she really is. \\n\\nThe dining room is very outdated. I felt like I should be living in the late 60's. The first table had a full table, everyone in a suit enjoying coffee. The table behind us was a guy who was writing notes.  We sit down in the old uncomfortable booth, listening to music that was so mind numbingly boring. This music makes Kenny G sound like rock. As we sat down, a 2nd gentleman comes in to sit in the table behind us with the solo person writing notes. Our waitress makes a beeline past us to greet the table, and asks how her \\"2 favorite customers\\" are. This is when we really knew we were not going to enjoy this. So after 5 min of conversation, never asking if they want to order, the gentleman passes her his notes, and asks her to deliver these \\"love letters\\". After a few more minutes of conversation she disappears to do so. She then comes back, ignoring our table and letting the guy know she could not find one of the ladies. After a few more minutes she visits us.\\n\\nShe explained our questions on the menu and asked if we wanted any drinks. My wife and I both asked for water, as we were going to order brunch.\\n\\nThe food was the only bright spot in this place. That is not saying much however, as it was over seasoned, cooked and perhaps previously frozen. I ordered the french toast, with potato cakes and turkey sausage. The sausage had obviously been frozen and probably purchased from some low quality bulk dealer. It was not seasoned and really tasted bland. At least it was edible. The french toast, was not seasoned properly. The cinnamon was not spread out well, and there were pieces that had none, while other pieces had a concentrated amount. The potato cakes were mushy and did not seem they were made at the restaurant. I really wonder if everything they make is frozen food? My wife had the same sides with the California Omelet. The egg seemed over cooked, but the avocado was fresh and good. \\n\\nAt this point, we had already decided we would not come back. However, the real kicker was when we received the bill. We were charged $2.50 for a glass of tap water each. Perhaps, when my wife and I are retired and want to visit with other older folks, we would visit there again for brunch, however the charge for water, quickly erased their thoughts. We left sad, depressed and confused why such a place could, would and does exist. What had been a great afternoon together, ended with such a lackluster lunch. I never felt so defeated leaving a business before.\\n\\nI can not recommend this place to anyone. The owner needs to update the space to be within the last decade at the very least, and need to hire new cooks.

Rated based on food alone, this would easily be a 5-star review. The highlights:\\n\\n-jackfruit and cardamom curry: I recommend ordering this, partially because it's such a unique menu item. The curry itself was fragrant with just the right amount of spice.\\n-lamb popsicles: listen to the other reviews: you must order this. Incredibly flavorful, very tender. The cream-based curry was light and delicious. Accompanied by spinach and potatoes. Perfection!\\n-rajasthani spicy goat: usually goat has a strong aroma and aftertaste, but this was really well done - Vij's somehow kept this really light. Fantastic flavor.\\n\\nThe common thread here: the food is innovative, an excellent fusion take on Indian dishes. Somehow packs a lot of flavor without being too heavy. Not overhyped in the slightest, in my opinion. I also disagree with the reviews that pan this restaurant based on it being \\"not authentic\\" enough...honestly, it's a fusion upscale type of restaurant and you're judging it on the wrong criteria. \\n\\nDespite the fantastic, 5-star quality food, here's why I'm only giving it 3 stars:\\n\\n-The wait is ridiculous, and the service does not mitigate this problem. Yes, it's a Friday night and 45 minutes really isn't too bad. But when you're waiting in a lounge area, and every other party is called before yours (including those who arrived after you) without any explanation or notice from the wait staff, that doesn't set a good first impression. And, this all occurred after I had called ~10 min prior and asked how long the wait was; the answer: \\"not too bad at all\\".\\n\\n-I appreciate the complimentary appetizers and lounge area (instead of waiting outside like in the previous location). But, this new lounge area could easily accomodate 30+ more guests; wouldn't this space be better used to expand the main dining area and serve more people, thereby reducing wait times? \\n\\n-Once seated, service was again rather inattentive. I thought the main server who initially explained the menu was fantastic and did a great job, but then somebody else came to take our order? Confusing, and again totally fine in the name of efficiency, but there was no explanation given for this. Complimentary naan and rice: yay -- but it was really hard to track people down to actually ask for this!\\n\\n-30 minute wait between when we finished our appetizer to when our entrées came out. Again, I completely get that a busy kitchen can be challenging on a Friday night. But we were never approached by servers telling us our dishes would be out soon, and we were not provided any naan or rice during this time period either.\\n\\nI appreciate the merits of leisurely dining, but this was a bit much. And again, if I felt like service was present and attentive, that would be a much different matter. \\n\\nOverall, there are some serious problems to iron out at this restaurant. I would recommend trying Vij's for the food in the case that you can snag a table without much of a wait. Otherwise, you'll inadvertently be in for a 3 hour dinner experience during which you will be hungry the majority of the time."},{"name":"BD's Mongolian Grill","address":"3977 Worth Ave","city":"Columbus","stars":"3","text":"Soup, salad, and egg roll appetizer were good.

The sliced pork was chewy as hell.  The rice was so overcooked and the teriyaki chicken tasted like absolutely nothing.  The egg drop soup was also flavorless.

Thankfully they offer the NFL ticket and a bevvy of normal TVs hung from the ceiling--in the bar area as well as all over the dining room.

The dish was large, covered in shredded cheese and topped with bbq chicken.  The salsa served on the side looked as if it was homemade and packed a flavorful punch.  They hit the spot and were adequately priced at $9.  \\n\\nBecause it was a cold and rainy Orlando day, the next obvious decision for my boyfriend was to order their Hot Bag of Donuts.  For $6 you are served 6 warm donuts, in a white bag, that have been tossed in cinnamon and sugar.  They smell heavenly and looked absolutely delicious.

Nope.  \\n\\nFirst, lets talk coffee.  Its awful.  That's just the truth.  Watery, flavorless, blah.  You're a coffee place, figure out how to make coffee.  Lesson 101.\\n\\nThe breakfast tacos were rocking for a while, but they started suffering serious quality control issues.  Somedays the tacos would be greasy monstrosities.  One day they decided to put my taco on the panini press or something.  So it came with these grill marks and the tortilla was all hard and dried out.  Nice.  One day I ordered a taco with potatoes, not realizing they put those shoestring potatoes on everything.  Lame.  I was kind of digging the Sol taco for a while, but come on, the thing is like redonkulous huge and has every known breakfast taco item known to mankind on it.  Gluttony only works up to a point.\\n\\nThen there's the 'bakery' part.  They stopped carrying a lot of their baked goods, which kind of makes the 'bakery' part a misnomer, no?\\n\\nThen they expanded to this full menu.  My gf ordered chicken tenders one time.  Don't know why.  Some people like chicken tenders.  Anyway, they were basically burnt bits of fried chicken.  Inedible.  \\n\\nThe staff: please take some anti-depressants people.

A business model based upon not making money.  Interesting.\\n\\nNow lets talk about the inside.  Concrete floors and black ceilings.  No wonder everyone is depressed.  Every other coffee house in town has some design scheme, some vibe, some way to make the place feel comfortable.  Not Quacks.  Nope, we want to make it feel like a morgue in there.\\n\\nNow lets talk about outlets.  There's like 2.  So the folks that like to buy drinks and food all day and work on their laptops, ummm, how are they supposed to do that?  Yeah, lets have a business model wherein we want to have a business where people are supposed to hang out, but we make it as uncomfortable as possible (with our also super uncomfortable chairs) for them to do any work there.  There's a patio, but really no work has gone into making it nice.\\n\\nI mean why wouldn't I just go to Clementine's to get good coffee and hang out and go to El Chilito and get good tacos?  Hell, I can go to Fiesta and get better breakfast tacos and probably stronger coffee.

Our group of 7 had to be split up into two tables because the restaurant only has about 15 small tables to begin with.

The brewery is right across the street!\\n\\nClam chowder, fish and chips, and fresh cold local beer makes for an excellent lunch.  My friend got a half dozen of their oysters and couldn't stop raving about them.  I was tempted, but I was stuffing myself on my food.  The clam chowder was very good, pretty standard stuff.  The cod was okay, tasty yes,  but I felt like the batter was a bit thick and while it was crispy on the outside, you had to bite through a layer of it to get to the fish.  Also, I appreciated that the fish was a filleted piece rather than a fish stick.  The special was $10.99 if i remember correctly.\\n\\nThe service here was okay, there was mainly one waitress serving every table and I felt kinda bad since she was constantly running around taking orders, delivering food, getting people drinks, etc.  I mean, can she get a little help?  The food still came out pretty quick, though we had to wait halfway through our meal for the beer.\\n\\nSo overall, this place is a good stop off for lunch when you're in the mood for fish and chips.

Inside, basically is one long room. The acoustics are bad and it gets so loud in there, especially when the clientele is there to watch a game.

I wanted to order a whole plate of the garnish, but I held back and ordered the strawberry rhubard crisp, which was a nice finish with a little tartness from the rhubard.

So I checked in mid-week which isn't super crowded.  \\n\\nWhen my cab arrived, there were several bellmen by the door chatting.  None of them came to my cab to help me with my luggage.  When I made it to the door with my suitcase, a bellman finally asked me if he could give me a hand with my luggage.  He then carried my luggage to the desk and waited for a tip.\\n\\nI had arrived about 45 minutes early so I checked in and asked if my room might be ready.  (It had been a long trip and it would have been great to freshen up.) The woman at reception said that their \\"system\\" was down and she would have to contact the housekeeping staff.  She took my mobile number and assured me that she would call when it was ready.\\n\\nI went to the cafe for coffee since there was almost no place to sit in the lobby.  Apparently, the Taj has leased out most of the space that was once included in the Ritz lobby. The cafe was lovely, and the service was excellent.  I waited for a half hour and did not receive a call, so I returned to reception where the woman I had spoken to acted as if I had never talked to her.  I was again told that the \\"system\\" was down and I would have to wait. At this point, it is only 15 minutes before the official check-in time.\\n\\nThis time I waited in a chair across from reception.  I watched as three people were immediately checked in with no questions asked.  Finally, at precisely 3PM the woman I had initially spoken with called me over and indicated that my room was ready.\\n\\nI was then given my suitcase back, and I proceeded alone to my room.  I was given no additional instruction or directions...\\n\\nI arrived at my room which was large but rather sparsely furnished. There was only one comfortable chair, so I was glad that I was traveling alone.  The room was clean, but there was a huge dark stain on the carpeting next to the bed.  The room looked pretty tired and in need of refurbishing but it was large, clean, bright and quiet.\\n\\nThe bathroom was VERY small, but it was clean and well appointed.  Even though the bath was small, it was very pretty.\\n\\nThe turndown service included turning the TV on, drawing the drapes, putting bottles of water at the bedside and filling the ice bucket.  No fancy chocolates here.  \\n\\nRoom service was prompt, and the service was cheerful, but the continental breakfast included dry croissants and barely ripe fruit.\\n\\nI stayed at this hotel during the last year it was the Ritz.  At that time it was in need of refurbishing, but the service was fantastic, and it was incredibly well appointed.  Just a bit worn.  When it was the Ritz, you felt special to be there.  I remember trying to walk out into the rain and being stopped by a bellman who insisted I borrow a Riz umbrella if I was going to walk.  Not only does the Taj not offer you an umbrella, they have plastic bags and a sign asking you to please not let YOUR umbrella drip all over their lobby.\\n\\nI am so very sad to leave such an awful review, but I love this building, and it breaks my heart to see the level of service and care to have deteriorated to this extent.  This is the best location in Boston.  Too bad the hotel is such a bad experience.  If it were an inexpensive place to stay, I would still recommend it based solely on the location.  Unfortunately, it is expensive and has poor service.  \\n\\nI will stay at the Lenox next time.  The location is not as great, but the service is MUCH better."},{"name":"Mother Juice","address":"100 Hanover St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"I work nearby and come often (maybe a bit too often) for lunch and often for dinner.

We immediately noticed how cold it was in that area.  Cold air was blowing on us.  Even my sons who are always hot had to put their hoodies on their heads.  I asked if they could turn the air down and the guy that sat us said they couldn't because of the hot hibachi grills. That made no sense at all. I went to the bathroom and noticed there were empty tables and it was much warmer in those areas.  So he lied of course.  Even the family that sat next to us was freezing. Here we are in Florida having to wear our hoodies and coats in order to be comfortable eating dinner. RIDICULOUS.  Then...... they don't serve noodles and rice together like our fav spot in NJ, Kiku.  It's either or and an extra cost of you want both.  LASTLY, the shrimp were so undercooked they made me sick.

Really nice open space, clean, bright  and comfortable.  First time I stopped in I couldn't tell if it was a patron on the bar itself but someone smelled really good.  Not restaurant good but kinda like strawberry starburst.   When I returned the smell was absent so it must have been a fluke. \\n\\nThe beer selection is on point.  Lots of local beers and some you don't usually see available in restaurants. (Weihenstephaner is a nice break from bars with their usually IPA forward selections) \\n\\nThe first meal I had was only an app, the Mezze plate and it was pretty mundane.  Plenty of limp celery and carrot slices with pita triangles that got wet, a small cup of katamala olives and a soupy tomato, cucumber feta salad . \\n\\nJust a boring and flavorless attempt at a fresh summer dish, it could have benefitted from some hummus. \\n\\nOn my second trip I brought my wife along.  Beautiful day outside and they had the street side windows open.  Weymouth landing isn't the sexiest of locations but there's a certain charm to the suburban hustle and bustle and enjoyable to people watch with a couple of beers. \\n\\nBeer selection was still top notch.  It's not super exciting but a style for just about anyone.  The bartender made my wife a mixed drink with mint, watermelon and other mixers and she absolutely loved it (she lived the next one even more) \\n\\nThe food this time around was much better.  I had the fried chicken sandwich and it was fantastic.  It was juicy and the spicy slaw on top of it added a nice touch of heat and a cold crunch .  The fries were good too.  Pretty salty but enjoyable, especially paired with my wife's meal which was the chili. \\n\\nLet's get the bad out of the way here.  This might be he saddest looking chili I've ever seen.  Looked like a watery mole sauce with some cheese melted on top.\\n\\nBut never judge a book by its cover.  This was absolutely delicious.

Off the bat, we ordered pizza and cheesy bread and asked if we could use a coupon from their app. We were told yes, but when we got to the register we were told no, which by then it was too late to cancel the cheesy bread, and the coupon was lost because I had already hit redeem expecting to have it ready to use. The service was extremely slow, and it didn't seem that any of the employees knew what they were doing. There was no communication between them and I watched them mess up, take a long time on, or mismatch order after order. \\n\\nThe food as a whole lacked presentation and taste. The toppings were very center heavy and one pizza was undercooked, while the other was a little burnt. Both were poorly cut, to the point of barely being cut at all and in very big, unsymmetrical pieces. The crust also had gel lines. The taste was nothing special, almost as lacking as little Caesar's.

The place feels crisp and clean and comfortable. The huge windows make for great people watching while you enjoy your burger.\\n\\nThe staff were very friendly and prompt. They are enthusiastic about the place and you can tell they try their best to ensure you are having a good time.\\n\\nNow to the important part, they real reason why you come to this place, the burgers. Overall I would say they are average for what you pay. I had the Stackhouse burger which consists of:  prime rib patty, pancetta, portabellini, guinness cheddar on a brioche bun. \\n\\nFirst the bun, brioche buns are nice but It's not my thing on a burger. They are a little to rich and a tad on the  sweet side so for my tastes they don't seem to match with the meat.\\n\\nNext the meat, prime rib patty. The meat was pretty good but could use a little more seasoning. I don't think i'm sold on using prime rib over something like ground chuck, then again I work with computers not food so i'm no expert here.\\n\\nThe cheese? Well i'm not sure how much Guinness cheddar really adds to the overall product compared to some of the other aged cheddars out there.\\n\\nWould  I come back? Sure I would, but right now it's not a place that I would put on my regular lunch pick list.\\n\\nSince I really want to see this place succeed here's a suggestion for the owners: \\n\\nYou use some great high end ingredients in your burgers which is nice, but sometimes the best burgers are the simplest ones. Offer me a burger with fresh regular buns baked that morning with a simple aged cheddar and a ground chuck patty with some of your seasonings. If i had the choice between something like this at $10-$12 over the Stackhouse burger, this would win 9 times out of 10, it could even convert me from a casual eater to a regular lunch visitor."},{"name":"El Patron Mexican Restaurant & Cantina","address":"12167 S Apopka Vineland Rd","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"We're from out-of-town and took a chance on this strip mall restaurant and boy, are we glad we did!!

So, we did The Wave because we were super hungry. There was little to no wait at The Wave, so we were able to pretty much walk right in with no reservations, no problem. You can order a la carte at the Wave, but the server informed us that if you did the buffet, the drink was included. This seemed to be the better deal because most a la carte items are over $12 and drinks are $3, the buffet is $22. The food on the buffet is exactly the same as Chef Mickey's, there may be a few exceptions because it is smaller, but the mainstays are still there - mickey waffles, biscuits and gravy, eggs, bacon, etc. etc. The buffet also features eggs benedict, sweet potato pancakes, bagels, muffins, fresh fruit, oatmeal, and yogurt.

And he is really passionate about sushi. So if you get him started he can educate you on sushi, the different cuts, the quality of the fish. I'll give him a 5 star. And since we start coming regularly, if went out of his way to make some dish that weren't on the menu. And oh my god, those were all excellent, and fresh. And that's how come we kept coming back because every day was a different experience.\\n\\nAbout the place:  Well we found it via yelp because of the great recent reviews, it's actually a very cosy place, with very friendly staff. Some staff made us laugh because they would actually spend their tips on the sushi. The chef laughs about it, says they work just to eat sushi. Yes it's that great in my opinion.\\n\\nAbout the sushi: Well most of the time we went for very traditional sushi, so we didn't try too many rolls, but the few we tried were excellent, we didn't go for the habachi, teriyaki and all that sort. The tempura also were great. But sushi and Sashimi we thought it was just awesome.  I'll post some of the pictures.\\n\\nWe also tried some premium sushis, like the Uni, the O-toro, lobster, Abalone, Jumbo Amaeibi, Jumbo prawn, fresh sea bass. Tomorrow he promised us some fresh crab. And we look forward to that. We end up spending more than we intended simply because the sushi were really great and we end up eating all the premium fish. But it was all worth it. \\n\\nSome other notes worth mentioning:\\n\\nThe chef makes his own soya sauce so it's not bought off the shelf. He also makes some special sauce on his own that he applies to each sushi. \\nHe has some wasabi oil that he puts on the sushi, the cuts are great, the fish is fresh. Honestly one the best sushi we've had. \\n\\nIf you are around make sure to stop by, and ask for the o-toro which is a real bargain currently at $4 a piece.

I feel bad that I cannot remember his name but I have to say for such a large party, he did a good job of getting everyone's orders right and bringing us second and third requests.  He did look a bit miserable though (can't blame the guy!) and service was as good as you can expect for a one person to forty ratio.  As for the food, I got the greek hummus wrap and thought it was interesting.  It was basically a greek salad w/hummus wedged inside of a spinach tortilla.  It wasn't bad but it wasn't something I would not go out of my way to order either.  Salad dressing inside of a wrap just had a strange taste to it.  On the other hand, the fries that came with the wrap were delicious.  They were long and crispy with a soft interior.  The salt was just right.  Honestly I would've been happy with just a big bowl of fries as my meal, they were terrific.  Price-wise, it was not bad to get a tab of $8 and change for a filling meal.

It is fresh, clean, well cooked (raw in the middle just how i like it) and very flavourful. Also i tried my friend's burger, the kobe burger, and it was amazing. The patty was bigger than the bun itself which makes it even more awesome but the most excellent thing among the excellent thing i experience here is their bun, the bun was amazing. It was not too soft and not hard to the bite and could handle my (Godzila) grip just right and therefore didn't break at all also it was moist and it soak the juices from the patty really well. Their aioli was also really good and really tasty, i just wish they serve me a whole bowl of it rather than a tiny sauce bowl. \\n\\nMore about the Ahi burger, the ahi was really good it was fresh and clean the condiments were perfect with the burger. there were avocado, letuce, tomatoe and some aioli. \\n\\nI really like this place a lot but the price...

I think it's totally inappropriate for a restaurant to make you wait 15-20 minutes when you have a reservation. The waiter was nice, he was super friendly and probably the reason for the extra star on this review.\\n\\n2) Ambience--underwhelming and inauthentic. Wallpaper marble columns just aren't a good look. Rather than being hip or fitting in with the neighborhood it felt very blah.\\n\\n3) Food--no finesse at all.

It didn't feel as heavy as I thought it would be, but it is definitely filling. I wish they had a smaller portion for the specialty poutine though because I personally like my fries or frites as y'all call it crispy, so after awhile, they get soggy due to the juices and other layers of beef and sauces. I don't know what it is about soggy food, but it's just not my deal. You can only imagine how I felt as I sat there for minutes trying to finish my meal.

The food itself is good, but the service here is very inconsistent. Previously, our order was mixed up and the wrong oysters were served. When we asked our waiter about it, he tried to pass them for the actual oysters we ordered. We are not oyster experts, but they definitely looked different from our friends' oysters who have ordered the same thing.\\n\\nWe went back recently with a reservation for two at 5pm. The hostess guided us all the way to the back by the washrooms to our table. On the way there we saw a two-seater booth which we would much rather be seated at and asked if we could sit there instead. She basically told us no and gave an excuse that didn't make sense (\\"just because of the way the reservations and the whole thing worked\\"), before I could question her more, she walked away. This was unacceptable as we were not walk-ins; we had reservations and the tables were both for 2 people. It did not affect any reservations. In addition to that, we were only given the regular menus without the drink menu or happy hour menu. The people seated beside us offered their happy hour menu to us instead. Later on while we were eating, the hostess came by to clean and wipe the table next to us. My husband got sprayed on the arm with the cleaning agent. That meant that our food might have been sprayed too (it's a small table). We brought it to the attention of our waiter and luckily he said the spray was only water, but still she should have been more careful with the spray while people are eating! When we left the restaurant, there was nobody waiting to be seated and the hostesses were just standing there chatting. Neither of them even said thank-you, good night, or acknowledged we were leaving. They had one job..\\n\\nThe restaurant is usually pretty busy, so expect longer waits for your order, especially the oysters and especially during happy hour.\\n\\nI like the oysters and the bacon infused vodka Caesar drink.

The people the run this are either Koreans or Chinese but the \\"owner or manager\\" with the gel hair with dress shoes etc - he was busy seating diners and going to tables hearing COMPLAINTS from diners!

They offered the menu with Happy Hour and All you can eat - also a menu book. The menu book is helpful because it reveals more details on the rolls they serve from the AYCE menu. \\n\\nThe water here was ok tasted funny and I had drench it with bunch of lemons to make it feasable to drink.

The diners behind me were complaining etc to gel guy about food and the service. Then the woman turned to me and stated her complaints. \\n\\nThey give you the order sheet with no pen to write with. Wth?! \\n\\nThe wait time on the food OMGGGGG!!! I had to order a salad from the AYCE to calm my stomach down. The AYCE MENU is not bad and its cheaper to order from because the menu consists of sashimi, nigiri, rolls, appetizers, dessert for$21.95. \\n\\nThe wait was very long I think waited more than 30 mins until my rolls came to the table. I ordered Rainbow roll which was the most decent one than the rest of the rolls I ordered. 2/3 of the rolls I ordered were tempura fried. When took a bite of the tempura rolled rolls - it was HOT! Couldnt even eat throughout because it was too warm to chew! I was soooo hungry that I kept chewing anyway.\\n\\nThe rule to the AYCE menu is any sushi roll pcs leftover - you will get charge per piece that is left. Also no sharing. \\n\\nThe house salad was lukewarm with ginger sauce - the salad dressing actually good. Just lukewarm to eat. \\n\\nThe dessert was actually good - Fried Cheesecake with Green Tea ice cream. \\n\\nThe service here was bad imo - if you hear diners complain etc and food takes toooo long - its a turn off. The icing on the cake was I ordered another set of 2 pcs \\"egg cake\\" nigiri and Squid Tempura.. The squid tempura was never cooked because server forgot and the Nigiri came out as 2 triangle pcs of egg cake NOT NIGIRI. \\n\\nI quickly got up the woman server apologized etc to me while I was walking to pay the pill the teen server stated to me they are cooking the squid tempura and I couldnt stand waiting any longer for long wait on food. I told her    to not worry about the food and that Im ready to pay. \\n\\nTokyo Restaurant on Lee Vista has better service and quicker to serve food than here. \\n\\nOnly good thing about the AYCE menu with here is mostly full menu is AYCE unlike Tokyo its only sushi rolls/sashimi and nigiri items."},{"name":"The Ravenous Pig","address":"565 W Fairbanks Ave","city":"Winter Park","stars":"4","text":"Meeeeh.

The place is definitely funky and easily worthy of the Austin motto of \\"Keep Austin Weird\\".  The food, while not what I would consider gourmet, was very flavorful.  Every item that the four of us ordered was tasty, filling, and unique.  And, I usually don't admire the \\"texture\\" of food but, the food had lots of crunch (when appropriate).  We started off with the fried oysters (a specialty according to the waitress - she was on target) and a few drinks.    (By the way:  The drinks were very reasonably priced and strong.)  I got a great Caesar Salad that they mistakenly divide onto two plates for my wife and I to split.  It was just as well since \\"my half\\" was plenty for both of us and we brought \\"her half\\" home.  My wife had the Divorced Trout which was way more than she could handle so she shared with me.  It was great!  I crudely put a part of my trout on one of the biscuits they brought for the table.  My make-shift fish sandwich was awesome.  Our dinner partners shared a steak that they loved - although it appeared a little too rare.  (At Ranch 616 if you ask for rare, you get rare.  I can't complain about that.)  Also, the table got a side order of onion rings and jalapenos.  I highly recommend this for all future diners!  If I had one complaint it would be the noise.  When we first arrived at 6:45 (on a Thursday), the noise level was reasonable (and fun) but by about 8:00 is was loud (and obnoxious).  By 8:00 we wished we had sat outside where the noise would not have been so suffocating.

They seemed fairly busy and about to get busier. Our server was very nice and checked in with us often. We ordered a couple margaritas, the queso with chorizo, bacon wrapped jalapenos and a cup of their tortilla soup. The queso was good, loaded with pico and meat, but not the best I've had. I really enjoyed their jalapeno poppers, though they could have had more heat. I didn't personally try the soup but was told it was delicious. I had the shrimp salad and it was great! The mango vinaigrette dressing is subtle on the mango, which I prefer. There was a fair amount of shrimp and they were very good. It is a large salad, more like an entree salad. \\nThe ambiance of the Matador doesn't scream \\"Mexican restaurant\\" so much as Spanish Gothic night club.

I selected some smaller pastries. Sharing them with pals I noted some of the qualities that had been discussed on previous reviews i.e. unusual textures, harder, chewier chews and simple flavours - which somehow come together to make tasty treats. While the culinary experience is certainly different from the cloud-soft bites in hip GF cupcakeries, an open palate will enjoy the old-fashioned farmstead flavor in their baked goods. It's a \\"whole-grain\\" tasting sweetness without the allergens. A tip: try to get the goods same day, the next day they are noticeably preservative-free-tasting! \\n\\nThe Vibes:\\nI love that it is located in the cheerful Boston Public Market (major plus) and the staff seem reserved but quite friendly and accommodating.

It's just folks trying to hurt and help the cafe because of recent political controversy. \\n\\nAn honest break-down of comments:\\n\\n1. Cleanliness/Smell: any review suggesting that the Red & Black Cafe smells bad is utter B.S. These comments come from people who want to hurt the cafe's reputation and are just assuming a radical place must be filled with dirt and foul smells. Having visited the place this afternoon, I can honestly say that I was surprised at how clean and well-organized the cafe was, and that includes the bathroom.\\n\\n2. The food: ignore all comments from people who are not used to eating vegan food. They expect the flavors of animal fats and dairy in all of their foods and aren't used to tasting grains, herbs, and vegetables without other substances. That said, I think the rice & beans could use less cilantro-- it was incredibly overpowering.\\n\\n3. The coffee: strong! Yeah, it's a little bitter because of this, but dang, you'll be up finishing that book or article for hours after a mug-full.\\n\\n4. The \\"unwelcome\\" attitude: five bucks says the customers who felt uncomfortable weren't exactly emanating non-judgmental vibes themselves. I walked in today with a tank top and sneakers on, and everyone was just minding their own business. Maybe some of you are just used to annoying, corporately required overzealous fake friendliness from coffeeshop employees?

It offers a wide arrange of unique Americana BBQ and traditional pub platters with a little bit of their own homemade twists. The food was delicious and the ingredients and freshness to both the meat and otherwise was bar none to the best restaurants in the city. If you're looking for a new place to try out, and want to enjoy the more profound flavors of meat in your life, it's definitely a place to consider. However parking within reason to the restaurant can be difficult, and it can be priced a bit higher than most traditional establishments. All and all at the end of my experience the only complaint I had was, I still left hungry. After thoroughly enjoying what I ordered, I felt as though I could eat an entire second portion without hesitation. So if you're more wanting as much meat as you can get, try Texas De Brazil.

We will most definitely be returning often!"},{"name":"Tin Shed Garden Cafe","address":"1438 NE Alberta St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"The Tin Shed continues to be one of my favorite brunch spots, my friends and family from out of town all know it by name because its the first place we eat when they visit. \\n\\nThe Goat Boy is my favorite breakfast ever, and though it disappeared for a while, it made a triumphant return and reaffirmed my love for the Tin Shed. \\n\\nAlso, pint sized mimosas. So, there's that."},{"name":"Random Order Pie Bar","address":"1800 NE Alberta St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Went for lunch yesterday and had the chicken pot pie.  I would rename it the chicken-less pot pie.  What a scam and RIPOFF!!!  $7.50 for a small piece of pie with only 3, count them on one hand, THREE small pieces of chicken throughout the whole slice.  I would not recommend that to anyone, unless you are a vegetarian.  The flavor was fine, but I was still very hungry after that bullshit snack.  I just call it as I see it, and I won't be seeing Random Order ever again.  Too many fine eating establishments in Portland to waste my time there."},{"name":"Ranch 616","address":"616 Nueces St","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"Best food I have eaten in Austin.  Not that food has not been good,it is this food is great. Different spices and fresh tasting food made this a great experience.  I had the chicken Maize jalapeño and it was awesome.  The wait staff was very attentive.  I will recommend this to anyone."},{"name":"Gabriela's Downtown","address":"900 E 7th St","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Love this place!

Every birthday and special celebration has included a cake from White's.  Therefore, it was very disappointing and upsetting when the cake we had most recently was well below their standard.  As we cut it, it was falling apart.  We contacted White's and explained the situation.  The lack of concern or good customer service from them was quite surprising.  They eventually relented and said to return the cake. \\n\\nWhen the cake was brought to them, they would not refund what we had paid for it.  Worst of all, they laughed at my father and he could see them mock him in the back room.  Rather than coming out to speak to him, they sent out one of the young girls to deliver the message that he could have a partial store credit and his money would not be refunded.\\n\\nRegardless of how much we have enjoyed the bakery goods at White's, the poor treatment of a long time customer has just caused the loss of business of our family (11 adults and many children)."},{"name":"Hudson Grille","address":"4046 Peachtree Rd NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3","text":"Great service and food the patio was hot but with a cold beer got better my whole family members had a great time and this place never disappoint me."}]`),E={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:O},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:6,poemsData:z,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.poemsData.filter(s=>{const e=this.searchQuery.toLowerCase();return s.name.toLowerCase().includes(e)||s.city.toLowerCase().includes(e)||s.text.toLowerCase().includes(e)}).slice(0,this.visibleCount):this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(s=>setTimeout(s,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},N={class:"search-container"},R={class:"card-container"},H=["disabled"],j={key:0},G={key:1};function D(s,e,n,f,i,r){const c=p("PoemCard");return a(),o("section",null,[e[3]||(e[3]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Restaurant Reviews 🥳")])],-1)),t("div",N,[e[2]||(e[2]=t("span",{class:"search-icon"},"🔍",-1)),b(t("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=h=>i.searchQuery=h),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[v,i.searchQuery]])]),t("div",R,[(a(!0),o(y,null,m(r.filteredPoems,(h,g)=>(a(),k(c,{key:g,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),r.hasMorePoems?(a(),o("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:i.isLoading,onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=(...h)=>r.loadMore&&r.loadMore(...h))},[i.isLoading?(a(),o("span",G,"Loading...")):(a(),o("span",j,"See more"))],8,H)):w("",!0)])}const F=u(E,[["render",D],["__scopeId","data-v-410b6bdf"]]),V=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"quotesmag/47.md","filePath":"quotesmag/47.md"}'),L={name:"quotesmag/47.md"},Y=Object.assign(L,{setup(s){return(e,n)=>(a(),o("div",null,[I(F)]))}});export{V as __pageData,Y as default};
