After a brief period of time, my waiter asked me if I was ready to order.  I replied that I was undecided between two appetizers.  What I really wanted was some help in deciding.  Instead, he walked away quickly after saying he'd give me more time.  I didn't get a chance to say \\"But wait!\\"  \\"Help me!\\".\\n\\nI decided to start with sauteed chicken livers and a glass of wine, with some puffy bread, and condiments of beet strips and olives.  The chicken livers were good, and there was an ample amount of juice for dipping the bread into.\\n\\nMy entree was Baked Kibbeh, \\"ground meat and cracked wheat, stuffed with meat, onions and pine nuts\\".  That's how the menu described it -- meat stuffed with meat!  It was a little bit like a quiche, but on the dry side.  I chose the dish mainly because it was served with laban salad, consisting of yogurt, cucumbers and cilantro.  It sounded better than it tasted.  I had visions of Anatolia's cacik soup dancing on my taste buds, so the laban somewhat disappointed.\\n\\nMy waiter passed by a couple of times and didn't ask how things were (eventually he did), nor did he seem to notice my wine glass was empty.

Braised Beef Casserole: not a \\"casserole\\" in the traditional sense of the word, but it was served in this earthen clay pot.  Beef was tender and tasty.  Could have cared less for the daikon that came with the dish.  Overall the gem of the evening, worth the ~$11 -- but then again that's not saying much given the other dishes...\\n\\n(2).  Yuen Yen Fried Rice: interesting presentation -- presented in a yin/yang fashion with a duo of sauces on top of fried rice.  However, I found both sides lacking in flavor.  The \\"red sauce\\" side was the better of the two with slightly tangy salt/soury flavor with small japanese scallops.  The creamy sauce side was unflavorful and just seemed like starch water.  blech.  \\n\\n(3).  Twin Lobster Special ($17).  Flavor wasn't the best.  Portions were *extremely* small.  There seemed to be no tail to the lobster at all!  The lobster must have been in the 10th percentile on the growth curve. \\n\\n(4).  Kon Sue String Beans: unremarkable.  Texture was done right, potentially too salty for some people, but I thought it was ok.\\n\\nService was as per usual for a Chinatown restaurant, so no complaints there.

I had the Oso Bucco - at $42 I was debating getting it because I am big Oso Bucco fan and am very picky about the quality of the meat and  the sauce. I am so glad I took a chance!

I was new to the area and just recently started dating my boyfriend. He would rave about how good the ribs were, and since I was new to the area, I wouldn't argue.\\n\\n\\nI'm not going to lie, I am always very satisfied with their food. I've had the ribs, which literally do fall over the bone, their friend shrimp, and their steak tips. While my boyfriend can finish his rack of ribs, I always have to take home left overs whenever I order, whether it is a rack of ribs or the surf and turf fried shrimp and steak tips. Usually I need steak sauce whenever I eat steak, but at Floramos, I don't need it. The way it is marinated is perfect enough for me!\\n\\n\\nNow comes down to the reason why I only gave them three stars... \\n\\nCustomer service. Horrendous. It's like whenever my boyfriend and I decide to dine here, we always tend to get a terrible waitress. We recently had one that didn't even introduce herself to us. It seemed like she only asked us how everything was when she happened to be walking by our table. It took forever to bring out our drinks, granted they were busy that night, but at least say I'll be right with you or something. \\n\\nOn a different night with a different waitress and a whole lot slower, we had the same experience with their waitresses. Only this night, the waitress did not smile or anything. She took forever to bring out our drinks, then she didn't give us straws, not that is a big deal or anything, but I'm the kind of person who needs a straw when I drink from a public cup, haha. The customer service was so bad that night that my boyfriend had to complain to the manager, and my boyfriend felt bad because some poor guy was involved in a hit and run in the parking lot.\\n\\nI did experience one good waiter though. He had a positive attitude and was very accommodating. Very friendly too. Wish I had gotten his name because he has provided the best service by far. \\n\\n\\nOverall, I would still recommend eating there, although a 'to-go' dinner might be your better option. Their food is very good but they could teach their wait staff some customer service skills.\\n\\nOne little thing I found funny. This last time we ate there, we had to sit in the bar area. They have a sign posted that says one and a half hours max in the lounge on Fridays and Saturdays which is funny because it takes them 15 minutes just to bring out your drinks, and then you have to wait even longer to bring out your food.

The less drinks I order, the smaller your tip.\\n\\nSome more time passes, a waitress (not ours) brings a tray of food into the room and sets it down before serving it. Instead of serving it to the party next to us who were staring at their food, she turns to the next table and talks to them/takes their order.

Maybe a lot disinviting. When you open the front doors, you're met with floor to ceiling velvet curtains, and it's a bit strange to peek in hoping you didn't screw up & enter the wrong building. But once you're in & assured by the lack of naked ladies hanging off of poles, you're made to feel right at home! The hostess was very sweet & welcoming, the waitress was patient & accommodating. It was our first trip here, so she gave us plenty of time to pour over the menus. I will say... Sitting at a table against the wall with a mirror hanging right at table height was a bit distracting. I'd ditch the mirror & go with a bare wall or some art. \\n\\nI had a daily special for the cocktail, the Shandy--Live Oak Hefe (personal favorite) with lemonade & pomegranate juice. It was so good! Sweet, but refreshing and very tasty. Husband had the maple old fashioned, which he gulped down rather quickly. I appreciate the water on the table, but feel it may discourage the wait staff from touching base often enough. We had to wait longer than I liked to order additional drinks after our food had been delivered. \\n\\nOn to the food... I decided to go with the slow cooked beef shoulder. It was served in an old-fashioned metal sauce pot with a fairly long handle. Decent concept, but it was a little much for me. The handle got in the way. The depth of the pot made it a bit awkward to get at the food with a fork or spoon. The presentation also meant the dish components were served more like a stew with the beef, mash & veggies all mixed together and soaking in the liquid from the beef. The meal itself was extremely tasty, but I would have preferred a shallow bowl or plate over the pot. Husband had the daily special burger. 2 beef patties, what I assumed was a layer of pork belly, cheese and lots of purple onion. I snuck a bite, and it was pretty good. A little heavy on the meat & onion for my tastes, but well seasoned and well cooked. I wasn't terribly impressed by the duck fat fries, probably because they didn't seem to be fresh off the fryer and were under seasoned. To wrap it up, we shared the bananas foster beignets. Holy heck. Very heavy way to end the meal, but you better believe I'll be saving room for that dessert every time we pass through. The ice cream was the perfect texture and absolutely delicious. The beignets were piping hot & perfectly fried with tasty, but not overpowering, bites of banana inside. \\n\\nOverall, it was a good meal, the service was fantastic, and I'm sure we'll be back!"},{"name":"The Hungry I","address":"71 1/2 Charles St","city":"Boston","stars":"3","text":"Oh this a place I just want to love. The courtyard is really adorable; a very romantic setting. The service is fine; friendly servers, but I kept having to ask for more water which gets annoying after a while. The food however is so unsatisfying. The escargot dumplings- absolutely gross. The escargot are wrapped in a thick/pasty/chewy flavorless dough. It was very unpleasant. I ended up just taking the escargot out of the dough and just eating them by themselves. I ordered the steak as a main. It was a overcooked and generally unexciting. The other people at the tables food was also overcooked. The food here isn't terrible but what makes this a place I won't return to are the prices.

It's a pretty small cafe so that's fine I guess if you don't go during peak times. \\n\\nI didn't like the sound of any of their raw food dishes so settled on the veggie burger instead. Generally raw food recipes should be kept simple, or made by someone who knows what it should taste like and do taste testing on each batch. So I skipped that. \\n\\nWe got a Thai burger and daily soup. It was decent, but there is not a lot of flavour in it.  Most veggie burgers are all right, nothing amazing in general.  This place is close by our house so we go there occasionally. \\n\\nI have a juicer and Vitamix at home so I would never pay for a juice or smoothie there. It's way too expensive and I can make much better at home.  They serve the juices all frothy and they are pretty bland. \\n\\nThe menu could use a little pizaz and be more inventive.

It's also nice that they're open late, as it's a perfect place for getting dessert either after eating at home or eating out. They also sell cakes and will package anything up in a gift box, so it's a great place for getting some unique and tasty gifts for the sweet tooths in your life. I would definitely recommend the baklava, both for yourself and as a gift. I'm not a huge fan of nuts and have had baklava plenty of times that just didn't do it for me, but this is the real deal. \\nThe only problem I had with the place was their prices--so expensive! I got two pastries and a small box of baklava for the same price as a dinner out at one of Brookline's fine cheap dining institutions. However, I'd have to say that the quality is worth the price and I'd rather pay more to have Athan's than to get sweets that aren't home made and baked fresh, certainly.

Tea for me has been what coffee is to others so a menu with tons of tea options sounded perfect.\\n\\nPrior to trying the place out, I saw mixed reviews on Yelp. People either loved it or hated it and I can see why. It seems like the line to order never ends: I had to wait in a ~25 person line right when I got in and the line never died down the entire time I was there...it wasn't even peak lunch time and I was there from 3:00-5:30pm. The place is crowded (probably due to hype) and it's so hard to find an empty seat. The floor plan of this place really needs improvement as I saw tons of unused space that more tables and chairs could occupy. For example: there is this \\"shelf ring\\" of packaged products like tea leaves that customers can buy, but I never saw a single person browsing that area and it took up so much space. There could be at least 4-6 more tables set up there and the register can just hold those packaged goods. I could go on and on and point out some more areas and I'm sure others were thinking the same.\\n\\nAlso, I ordered my latte and baked item to go after seeing how crowded it was but was surprised to find that I also got a \\"number\\" stand even though I wasn't dining in. The cashier told me to just find an area to wait and a server would bring out the drink to me, just like dine in customers. It's so awkward holding a little stanchion and standing around so luckily I found a seat and decided to stay. You can see the staff constantly wandering around trying to find the right number and once they give you your drink / food, they don't take the number away because you might have ordered more than one item... so it just gets super confusing for everyone. My suggestion is to have to go customers wait and grab their stuff from a designated to go counter, and dine in customers to get those buzzing widgets that tell you to go up to the counter because your drink / food is done. \\n\\nWhy I'm giving them a middle ranking: all the employees were wonderful and I didn't have any complaints about my food, although the seating layout and \\"waiting\\" experience was awful.\\n\\nWould I come back?

I don't know who decided on this split, but it has a clear impact on the business itself since majority of ppl associate the restaurant with sushi, so for our visit today, it was very peaceful with only one other today that was there before us and were still there after we left. For perspective, my wife and I previously came monthly for the seafood or fishcake udon and I felt obligated to write this review in lieu of all of the other reviews I read. \\nWaitress didn't have much to do so she was incredibly attentive of us. Order consisted of hot green tea, edamame, agedashi tofu, kimchi mandoo ramen, and veggie ramen. Edamame is edamame, sea salted a bit, tasted fine, not weird and frozen like the packages from costco. Agedashi tofu presentation has changed from before but was the same components, came out super hot, lightly battered soft tofu blocks with green onions, radish, sitting in a pool of dashi. Still could be more generous with the dashi. \\nKimchi mandoo ramen was $10. Very dense, bowl was very full. Noodles were ok, not overcooked so had that bit of chew to it you'd expect, very plentiful. Had some fatty chashu, a generous number of pork dumplings (it's more like wontons but whatever), 2 halves of an ajitama egg, some menma, some kimchi, in a tonkotsu broth that wasn't too robust (for reference, tatsuya usually leaves me feeling queasy about 20 minutes after i eat) but still tasted right. Kind of like... Michi's normal tonkotsu broth?\\nVeggie ramen was $9, i felt like it was a pretty solid deal. For the record, there's not much protein in it so you might feel hungry later. Noodles were about the same consistency, shiitake mushroom broth was really good, lots and lots of veggies (bok choy, corn, bean sprouts, onions, woodear mushrooms, white mushrooms, zucchini, carrots as far as we can remember. Whatever vegetables that were in the udon from before but with bokchoy and bean sprouts added, essentially.) Lot less heavy than the kimchi mandoo one. Wife couldn't finish it, I had to assist. \\nSo as far as our meal goes, it exceeded the expectations we set when we saw the new menu, though we miss the somewhat nice desserts from before.

At around 625, our party started coming in and people didn't know where to sit so everyone was just pulling chairs everywhere and sitting at random tables.

The hazelnut torte was relaly good. Had to swipe a forkful from my sister even tho I am allergic to nuts.\\n\\nI tried the Earl Grey truffle because I really couldn't resist. It wasn't as good as the one at L.A. Burdick's because honestly, I couldn't detect even a hint of tea.

The only time I had been to a Brazilian Steakhouse like this was about 6 months ago in Detroit. It was AMAZING. about 20 different meets, four full length buffets of everything you coul want (10 different salads, cheese and fruits, vegetables and potatoes, everything) and an exhaustive wine and beer list.\\n\\n\\nSo with that being said, I was anxious to try this one, since obviously it is a lot close. \\n\\nWell it was an experience.\\n\\nI will start by saying we went for lunch on a Saturday, around 3 pm. So this may have played into it.\\n\\nthe positives though\\n\\n- was inexpensive. $14 each I think (versus $23 at night, and $35 where I had paid in Detroit).\\n- Also, was not crowded, and not to noisy. being with my parents who are both north of 60 yo, this was a welcome thing.\\n\\n\\nnow on to the other stuff.\\nThe staff was not great. I understand not everyone speaks english. it is the world we live in, the city we live in, and it is a Brazilian restaurant. But it makes it difficult when the people bringing you your food have no idea what you re saying or asking.\\n\\nnow for those unfamiliar with this type of restaurant. They have servers walking around with the meats on giant skewers, and they come to your table, slice some off when you ask. \\n\\nThis is great, as you can pick and choose, and try different things. Although when they give you something you dont want, or dont ever come back with something you want more of (see above), it isnt as enjoyable.\\n\\nnow, there were not as many options as the other place I went to. This is fine, because if there is a couple good ones, i dont need 15-20 choices. The meats were for the most part Ok. the sirloin and garlic beef were good, but the ribs were not very appealing.\\n\\nAnd the buffet (with basic rices, sausages, and a few other things), was lacking and disappointing.\\n\\nI could go on and on with some of the things I was not happy with, but I think I have already gotten my point across.\\n\\nI would not necessarily deter people from going, especially to try something new, but I can say i would not go back again."},{"name":"Small Pharoah's","address":"340 SW 5th St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"I've passed by Mohammed's cart a few times, and he has quite the following for only being open a few months.

Again, the gyro bender was in full effect, and I wanted to try his version. At $5.50 for the big lamb gyro, I figured I couldn't go wrong.\\n\\nNo feta here, but Mohammed put some \\"hot sauce\\" in here -- in quotation marks because it looks like he uses sambal to create it. Not spicy to me, but great flavor.\\n\\nMohammed toasts the pita on the flattop before putting the gyro together. The lamb is cut into uniform thin strips here, juicy and tender. A generous helping of fresh vegetables (lettuce, tomato, cucumber, onion) makes the meal even more guilt-free! I do prefer my gyros with feta and perhaps a little more tzatziki would be great. Overall, I got a fairly large portion for the money spent, always a good thing.\\n\\nOn my visit, there was a tray of baklava out, and even though it was maybe only noon, over half the tray was gone.

However, we needed to go to a place with a gluten free menu so we decided to give it a try.\\n\\nThis place takes reservations on some nights, however the night we went they weren't taking reservations. The line looked a bit daunting, but after a 20 min. wait we were seated. We had read about the gluten free bread sticks, which were not available on the night we went. The menu also says \\"gluten free bread available upon request\\" and the server informed us that this also wasn't available. Several of the gluten free pastas also weren't available - again, this wouldn't have been an issue except for the fact that this place advertises an expansive gluten free menu and that simply wasn't the case. The server kept saying they sold out of items, however it was a Wednesday night around 7pm so this seemed a bit surprising to us.\\n\\nGluten free claims aside, this place was decent but by no standard does it compare to some of the great dining that Boston offers.

Melt in your mouth deliciousness. Per Tommy's recommendation, we also tried both the she-crab soup and the mushroom bisque. Again, two more slam dunks! Yes, I was definitely feeling full after these starters, but a menu like this requires full exploration. For our main courses, we had the shrimp and grits and the lamb chops, and of course, a side of the mac n' cheese. We leave no cheese dish untasted! No meal is completely without a lil' sweet so we asked Robert to pick between the bread pudding and the Godiva liqueur cheesecake. He surprised us with the most heavenly, warm, scrumptious bread pudding I've tasted in ages. I wish I had more thumbs so I could give this more than just the standard two thumbs up! It was certainly the perfect way to cap off the evening and head home to indulge the delightful food-induced coma.\\n\\nCocktail list had some good offerings, but I would appreciate a few more options in the non-sweet domain.

Note that in Columbus, OH, $28 is pricy for a meal. \\n\\nTo begin, there was evidently no vinegar used in preparation of the sushi rice, and the consistency was that of sticky rice. The preparation of the rice is so important to sushi that I found it a little insulting that they would literally serve me fish atop sticky rice.\\n\\nThe choice of nigiri for the combo was predictable, cheap, and the fish did not seem very fresh. I found almost no flavor at all--I highly suspect some of these had been frozen-- and a small bone remained in one slice of fish. It tasted exactly like one of the plastic to-go containers of sushi you might get from the grocery store. The nori was wet and chewy; ideally nori will be on the crisper side. Even the ginger looked a little sad.\\n\\nThis was one of the worst meals of sushi I've ever had, not accounting for price, and considering the price it was probably hands down the worst value sushi meal I've ever had. I could get the same combo with fresh fish and properly prepared rice in any expensive major city (DC, SF, NYC...) for a lower cost. It is really hard for me to believe that the chef is not aware that they are sending out poorly made sushi with ingredients that are not fresh. \\n\\nMultiple people had suggested Rishi to me as a place to get good sushi in Columbus, so I'm willing to consider that this was an anomaly, but overall it left me feeling very sad for the state of sushi in this city."},{"name":"Hy's Steakhouse & Cocktail Bar","address":"637 Hornby Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4","text":"My all-time favorite restaurant.

The seitan hash didn't really taste like corned beef hash, but was well seasoned and a great complement to the poached eggs. It was pretty similar in flavor and texture to Chipotle's sofritas filling. The biscuits were soft and buttery with a nice black pepper flavor. The poached eggs and vegan hollandaise sauce were a nice topper to the biscuit/seitan foundation, though the hollandaise sauce was kind of watery and didn't have a lot of flavor.

Delicious, mellow food; bolongese and osso buco in particular.  Spacious and clean interior.\\n\\nBad stuff: The bread could have been better.\\n\\nThis was easily one of the best Italian meals I've had in my life.  Having been partially raised by an Italian godfather, I've had my share of Italian meals, both from restaurants and homecooked.  If I lived in Boston, I would be here every month.  Hell, if I lived within a couple of hours, I'd still go back.\\n\\nI went here for a Saturday night for dinner after making reservations.  I was early, but as soon as the door opened, I was greeted by a smiling host and coat check and walked to my table.  One thing I love about Boston restaurants compared to those in San Fracncisco is that despite being in a congested city, the rooms are quite spacious.  I was very comfortable in Mamma Maria.\\n\\nThey don't mess around with a huge menu.  The menu consists of two pages, but one side is only wine.  The wine menu is the opposite; it was one of the most extensive wine menus I've seen.  Most of the items I saw were traditional and very accessible.\\n\\nThey start you off with some bread, which by itself is actually quite bad.  It's very chewy and has very little taste.  The olives and pesto sauce the bread comes with, however, is delicious.  I almost always ask for butter if none is served, but after tasting the pesto I found no need to make that request.  The pesto was very fresh and you could taste the woodiness in it.  I would definitely return for pasta in pesto sauce.\\n\\nI got to try some of the bolognese.  It was possibly one of the best I've had.  The pasta was perfectly al dente and the sauce, which seemed to have a lamb or otherwise game-y meat flavor, was absolutely delicious.  Oftentimes, a pasta served in such delicious sauce becomes dominated, but the texture and flavor of the pasta really stood on its own.  It was a well balanced, delicious plate.\\n\\nI had the osso buco, which is a specialty of this restaurant.  Another incredible dish.  As expected, the meat came right off the bone and packed delicious veal flavor.  The sauce was mellow but contributed very well to the taste.  It was served on a delicious creamy bed of rice a la milanese which carried a unique, but addicting flavor.  Definitely recommended.\\n\\nFor dessert, I had the chocolate torte, which is served quite flat with a topping of coffee ice cream.  I'm not an expert on tortes, but to me it was another winner.  The ice cream in particular was delicious and creamy.\\n\\nIn conclusion: Mamma Maria makes me wish I lived in Boston.  It's that damn good.  If you skipped over my novel length review, I recommend the osso buco and bolognese."},{"name":"Mi Tradicion","address":"111 N Stygler Rd","city":"Gahanna","stars":"4","text":"They kept the salsa and chips flowing and warm.

This place is a horrendous barbecue place. It's fine as a LUNCH buffet ($13) but definitely not worth it for dinner $(25). \\n\\nThe warm buffet section was pretty decent, not great. The food was warm and freshly brought out, but it was made in such quantity that it sat around for the entire 90 minutes we were there. So the dry food got hard and crunchy. The wet food got limp and soggy.\\n\\nThe cold buffet (including the creamy dishes) were never replaced, that's a sanitary issue. I'm sure it must have sat for awhile after we left as well.\\n\\nBut the killer is that the meat skewers were just as terrible as the last time we went. This time the lunch service started slow at 11:30, but picked up by 12:30 that it should have all been fresh. And indeed we saw them making fresh skewers in front. But EVERY meat that came to the table was the same. Overcooked. Charred. Dry. I like meat on the well side. And even for me, it was just terrible. The beef ribs were greasy and salty with no remaining succulence at all. The chicken was atrocious as it was so dry I had to soak it in tomato stew to force it down. The beef steaks were also salty and dry; my friends who wanted the rare portion finally found a little bit, but it was completely fatty and inedible. The kielbasa was fine but nothing special.\\n\\nAnd the service was just as shitty as last time. The worker strolls around in a half-daze to serve the meat. When we were not immediately attentive he would get impatient; granted, some at our table could be more aware, but it's his job to let us look and make a decision; but really we should have just said the food sucks no thank you. And they KEEP MAKING A MESS. Every meat they carry at an angle so the grease ends up dripping all over the floor and my shoes. And the table. Stop doing that! Seriously! And when you cut, don't splatter things.\\n\\nThe owner needs to fix a lot of basic things. 1) Go to a big city and watch the service at the tables, emulate that. 2) Get a chef who cooks the meat better. 3) Make smaller portions for the buffet and bring them out more often so they do not sit forever.\\n\\nI'm never coming back. And unless you want sub-mediocrity, don't come even or lunch. It's just not worth it.

My boyfriend got the Mac and cheese and let me just say it was freaking amazing. Creamy mushrooms, peas, and pasta mixed together in a lovely fontina cheese sauce. Very, very tasty. I had the French onion burger and it also was very good, a nice upgrade to a standard burger with fried onions, worchestshire aioli, and fontina cheese. Super tasty! As were the fries!!!! \\n\\nAfter dinner we went upstairs to the lounge to have a drink and while the drinks were a little pricey that was to be expected across the street from a large theater. They were good though! I had a pink lady and it was mixed really well. The lounge was really nice too with lots of sofa seating as well as another bar and lots of projector screens for sports. \\n\\nAll in all, I thought this restaurant was going to be iffy after looking at the reviews before going. However, we were pleasantly surprised to find ourselves having a very nice meal with convenience to our show plans. Great place and I'd highly recommend it for some upscale pub food."},{"name":"Thai Bloom","address":"3800 SW Cedar Hills Blvd","city":"Beaverton","stars":"4","text":"The food is consistently delicious and fresh, and the staff is very helpful and friendly.

My husband booked a brunch reservation (Sunday, March 1) for himself, me, and the VP of his company (an out of town guest). My food was very good. I give the establishment credit for good food. And the party I was with also said the food was good. The reason I give this place 2 stars is because in a place like Austin TX - where there are so many places to eat, yet alone traditional Mexican cooking this place was not awesome. 1) When we walked in, the host didn't acknowledge us, was on the phone and then said \\"give me two minutes...\\" and stormed out of the front area. Probably would've been better to acknowledge us and say \\"welcome, I'll be right with you...\\" Something more welcoming, right? 2) We waited for forever to be served once seated - and when I say served I mean to even get water. The place was not full, we had a reservation, and we probably waited 10 minutes or longer just to get water and drink order; 3) When my plate came out it was very hot (which is awesome food-wise!) and when I went to touch the plate, I burnt my fingertips. The waiter never mentioned a word about the plate being hot and I had no clue. 4) A refill on water? Nope. In general, it was fine. Would I go here again? Nope!

We started with a few bottles of the Montepulciano, which were nicely priced at $30/bottle for some good quality wine. Prior to ordering our entrees, we alerted the server we would be requesting 3 separate bills, based on sections of the table and this was very confusing for our server to understand, with lots of explanation provided. For my entree, I ordered the Chicken Primavera ($18), which was large strips of chicken breast served with peas, zucchini and broccoli (and I added mushrooms also), over a bed of homemade pasta (an additional $3 charge but well worth it!). The dish had nice flavor and the portion was pretty large. My husband ordered the Veal Saltimbocca  ($22), which came with nice size pieces of veal topped with prosciutto and smothered in melted mozzarella, over a bed of homemade Gnocchi ($3 additional charge)  tossed in a butter wine sage sauce. The Gnocchi wad delicious and pillowy, and the Veal was sweet and tasty. The sauce was bland and oily and nothing special. Unfortunately, the rest of our large group didn't have as much luck with their dishes, as some were served cold and some were served undercooked. Again, I do think such a large group was a challenge for the kitchen and in a smaller group we may have had a different experience. When we left, the line was out the door and wrapped around the corner, so they must be doing something right.

It took a while for us to get someone to fix the wobbly table, so there were certainly some sloshed drinks. I didn't even notice the piano until a quarter way through our meal when a guy sat down to play. It was super loud and not a very good music. To be honest, give me a headache, and it made conversation difficult. The piano was placed in a very odd location - directly behind the host stand and bar but in an awkward spot. You have to walk around it to get to some tables and it just doesn't 'fit' where it's at. \\n\\nNothing was really talking to me on the menu, by we ended up ordering a couple appetizers, a soup, and 2 entrees. The first app was duck grilled cheese with goat cheese and caramelized onions, but you could only taste the bread. I did not get any goat cheese flavor, there is barely any duck or onions. The other appetizer was crab stuffed avocado, which was a joke.  The avocado was deep fried but the batter didn't stick, there was barely any crab (maybe 1 bite each?), and it was drenched in a sauce (think spicy mayo meets thousand island).

Being a total and utter tourist I thought I *had* to go to Franklin.  Alas by the time my flight landed and I got to my hotel it was already 1pm, and when I pretty much ran over to Franklin they were sold out.  Not to be deterred I asked the cab driver what his favorite spot was and he said La Barbecue.  He actually recommended it over Franklin!  I didn't know anything about it but I took the word of a local and headed on over.  I am so glad I did!\\n\\nLa Barbecue is a food truck in what looks like a food truck park.  Except the other 3 or so food trucks had absolutely zero business the entire time I was there.  There was a pretty significant line (outside, in the Texas sun), but I figured it would move quickly.  I was wrong.... very wrong.  I ended up waiting around an hour and 15 minutes, though I think that's actually pretty good compared to how long some other people have waited.  I could tell that a lot of the people in line were locals (especially the groups of friends who brought a couple of six packs and were enjoying a cold beer and just hanging out in line) so I decided it must be worth the wait and I stuck it out.  They have a handwritten sign taped to the front of the truck and slowly things were selling out so I was crossing my fingers that I would be able to try the beef brisket!  I think if I got up there and found out they were sold out I literally would have cried.\\n\\nFortunately, after the long long wait, I got up to the front and ordered my beef brisket sandwich.  By this point other things were sold out, but I was grateful to get my sammich and dig into some lunch.  The guy working inside started by cutting off and giving me a bite of the brisket to try.  It was, hands down, one of the single best pieces of food I have ever put in my mouth.  I couldn't believe it.  The sandwich was a lot of beef brisket on a roll - no frills.  The picnic tables outside had sauces that you could put on top.  It was all very casual and relaxed.  The meat was seasoned so well and was a perfect balance between juicy, fatty pieces and dry pieces.  There was a TON of flavor.  The *only* thing that I didn't love is that it was very, very greasy.  I know it's barbecue and it's really the only time you can justify eating literal discernible fat, but there was way more grease than I was expecting.  What a mess!\\n\\nI would definitely recommend la Barbecue to anyone coming to Austin who wants to try some authentic Texas barbecue.  It is very popular and there will likely be a long wait, so wear comfortable shoes and prepare accordingly.  But let me tell you - it is worth the wait.  I am so happy I went and stayed!

My friend and I came last night for the Magical Dining Month menu and made a 7:45pm reservation.

I got there at 8:15 and our table still wasn't ready - we were told some of the tables were taking longer than expected, but the hostess offered for us to wait at the bar. We did not mind waiting as our bartender was attentive and friendly! A manager (young man with dark hair whose name I didn't catch) came by to tell us he was taking care of my drink because of our excessive wait, which really impressed me that he went above and beyond for us. When we were seated our waitress Sasha was an absolute delight! She was personable, funny, and knowledgeable about the menu. We tried the soup duo (didn't care for the crab soup as it wasn't very flavorful, but the mushroom soup was excellent) and the fried avocado which was rich and very fresh. We also tried the rack of lamb which was good but the real star of that dish was the risotto - some of the best I've ever had. The duck waffle was OUTSTANDING - perfectly cooked, juicy, flavorful waffle, and the blueberry hoisin sauce was unique and delicious. For dessert we had white chocolate bread pudding and peach cobbler and enjoyed both although our entrees were the real stars of the show.

This is easily the standard out of all the vegetarian/vegan restaurants I've encountered in New England.  I've been here close to a dozen times, any time I'm in town seeing a show at The Sinclair or the Middle East (the latter of which is immediately next door), I make sure to arrive well before showtime so I can sit at the counter and grab a bite, or grab a table with friends.\\n\\nThe menu is vast, the staff are all friendly, and, except at the very peak of activity, the service is always lightning fast.\\n\\nYou can come here for breakfast (I highly recommend the stuffed French toast).  You can come for breakfast at 7pm.  You can have a burger, a sandwich, or some shepherd's pie.  You can get other diner fare like fries, crispy onion rings, and frappes, which all match the quasi-retro diner decor.  And I haven't even begun to talk about the vegan bakery!  I haven't explored that particular aspect of Veggie Galaxy all too well, as I'm generally too full of frappe to bother with dessert, but the slices of cake I have had are all perfectly moist.  There's an art to making vegan desserts that aren't dry and flavorless, and VG makes it look easy.\\n\\nI think the strongest menu items are definitely the breakfast items, the aforementioned stuffed French toast being a standout among that category.  I haven't tried any of the 'egg' offerings, as scrambled tofu really doesn't do it as an egg replacement for my vegan self (ever, not just here), but the staff will substitute any egg or cheese for a vegan equivalent at no charge if you're so inclined.\\n\\nIn my many trips I've also had, to name a few items, the vegan mac and cheese, which was a bit small of a portion for the price but perfectly seasoned and delicious; a mushroom burger matched only in its messiness by its deliciousness; and several of their sandwiches, vegan takes on classics like the BLT and the Reuben, which do the job admirably but perhaps don't stand out as much as other items.\\n\\nOn my most recent foray, I tried the seitan cutlet of the week, two large hunks of lightly battered, fried seitan served over garlic-sauteed spinach and mashed potatoes, all in a lemony sauce with capers.  It was perhaps the best 'meat'-and-potatoes dish I've ever had, including my time as an omnivore.  The lightness of the lemon sauce helped alleviate the heaviness of the seitan, which was perfectly seasoned and cooked in its breading.  And while the medallions of the seitan were large, ultimately the portioning proved perfect.  I've generally avoided dish-of-the-day or -week offerings in the past, but this dish has changed my mind - though I'll be sad that I may not be able to come back and get this again.\\n\\nAll told, Veggie Galaxy is the pinnacle of dining for those of us who have given up animal products to any degree in this corner of the world.  While there are certainly some places that can rival some individual aspects of Veggie Galaxy in quality, VG is the only place I've encountered that has perfected breakfast, lunch, dinner, and dessert, all under one roof."},{"name":"Salty Sow","address":"1917 Manor Rd","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"Super dope spot.

No fuss, no feud, no looking for things to talk about.\\n\\nOn to my review: I ordered the Italian Omelet. It took 20 minutes for it to come out. I figured greatness took time. When it finally came out, Presentation was okay, but when I cut it with my fork the provolone cheese was stringy to the point where it refused to separate from the rest of the cheese. I had to use my knife to cut it. After taking my first bite, I realized the entire omelet was cold. I informed the waitress and she apologized and returned it to the kitchen. When she returned, I noticed that my ketchup was still on the plate which meant they microwaved a cooked egg. Ugh! This made not only the egg dry and disgusting, but also dried up the small pieces of Italian sausage and made them super chewy. I sent it back for a new omelet. My new omelet with cheddar this time, came out in only 8 minutes. It wasn't bad, but wasn't terrific either. The omelet was hot, but still lacked flavor and a nice, fluffy texture. I started to question whether it was made with powdered eggs or a very old batter. I ate half the omelet, because I was really hungry, but I wasn't going to waste my daily caloric intake on eating the entire thing. I got about 8 small cut up home fried potatoes which were a bit hard and some smaller than usual toasted rye bread halves with half melted butter on them.\\n\\nThis was my 2nd trip to NC. The first visit was with my daughter and we ordered raisin bread french toast and that was good so I wanted to come back and try a different dish since their prices seemed reasonable enough. My bad!

Well, that didn't happen, but the place is well worth going to for a bunch of reasons. \\n\\nFirst, parking is great because they have this huge parking lot right outside the door. \\n\\nSecond, they have a lunch buffet which is remarkably good. On one side they have three different types of maki (i.e. sushi rolls). Were they the best maki I've ever had? Nah. In fact, the rice used for one of them was as hard as I've experienced in a while. But the other two were decent. Also, they have two types of soup: hot & sour, and egg drop. They tasted fine. \\n\\nOn the other side is their main buffet cart, and the food was as good as I've seen for a Chinese buffet. They had the standard classics such as chicken and string beans, chicken teriyaki (okay, I know this is Japanese), boneless spare ribs, and lo mein. But then they had wonderful shumai, tempura shrimp, and a wonderful sauteed eggplant dish. \\n\\nThird, their Diet Coke is good. It's a little light on carbonation, but the fact they give free refills is fantastic. \\n\\nFourth, our waiter was on the ball. Was he kind of aggressive? I guess. But I don't care if the waiter is a bit proactive about clearing finished plates of food when I'm at an AYCE (all you can eat) buffet. \\n\\nFifth, the place was clean and the decor was nice. Obviously they put some money into designing the place because it's far nicer than many of the Chinese restaurants in Boston. \\n\\nSixth, the diversity. Whoa, the diversity of people at the buffet was the greatest I've ever seen at a restaurant in this area. It ranged from people having a typical party to a landscaping crew with guys dressed in dirty boots and jean shorts to preppy people dressed entirely in Vineyard Vines clothing. The point is that it was one great big melting pot of humanity.\\n\\nThe final point is the big kahuna: the price. It's not advertised anywhere, so I was kind of expecting something large, especially because the decor of the place is so nice and the food was great. \\n\\nIt was $10.95 per person. No joke. \\n\\nI was stunned.\\n\\nHonestly, that's a tremendous deal for what you're getting. \\n\\nCould I eat here every day? I could, but I'd probably balloon to 400 pounds. The food is on the heavy side, but that's what you expect when you go to a Chinese restaurant. In a lot of ways, this place is the perfect complement to Shabu in Quincy.

Menu Mistakes :(\\nI'm not that big of a grammar nerd, so your menu's gotta be pretty effed up to get noticed by not only me, but post-happy hour me.  Missed capitals, poor typography and spacing, and a glaring misspelling of \\"sparkling\\" for \\"sparlking\\", all made me and compadres cringe.  But since we were also semi-smashed we did the obnoxious thing and corrected all the menu mistakes (free of charge!) with a trusty red pen (don't worry we made sure it could be erased).  Our awesome waitress actually thanked us for marking up the menu, claiming that many had approached the manager about the errors to no avail.  Apparently our attempts were in vain as well.  As soon as the manager saw the menu, he took a washcloth and wiped the whole thing down, without even looking at it.  At that point we feared for our waitress' job, but luckily the manager wasn't that offended.\\n\\n2. Elixir??? and other nauseating and weird decor :*(\\nWhy in a place called \\"tenOak\\" is there a HUGE sign on the wall saying \\"ELIXIR\\"?  It's downright confusing.  \\"Elixir\\" is not nearly as abstract a term as \\"peace\\" or \\"penis\\"  to not be confused for the name of the actual bar.  Maybe the bar would be better off if named \\"Elixir\\"? Why does tenOak's definition of elixir read like the back of a cookie package imported from China?   Why is there a horse head spitting water out of its mouth in the patio area?  Why are chairs placed around said horse head, highlighting it as an excellent sitting area?  Why is there some weird mural on the wall of involving blood?\\n\\n3. Sugar does not a cocktail make :X\\nI freaking love whiskey.  And a good whiskey cocktail is a fantabulous thing.  So why does every whiskey cocktail on the tenOak menu make me vomit a little in my mouth upon reading it.  It's not a cocktail menu, it's a how-much-sugar-can-we-put-into-an-alcoholic-drink contest.  After asking the waitress for a signature cocktail that wasn't too sweet, the closest I could get was a cocktail with maple syrup( a lot) in it. In fact, it tasted like fermented maple syrup.   The gimlet were obscenely sweet as well, so the rest of just ordered wine.  At least I can somewhat hold the onset of type 2 diabetes with something my body can tolerate.  \\n\\nAll this being said, I will probably end up here again some day to sample the whiskeys straight up. But if you're thinking about coming here for cocktails, and you value your body's ability to use insulin, pass...just pass."},{"name":"Subway","address":"1742 S Orange Ave","city":"Orlando","stars":"3","text":"Line wrapped around the store and still wasn't much of a wait.

If I were asked to rate the location I would also leave my vote at 5 stars.  However, in my experience when you not only go to a restaurant but decide to frequent the place because of the first 2 things you have higher expectations for the following list of issues which dropped my rating severely.  First, the time it takes to get your order right.  As mentioned in a couple of the posts you will have to wait for your food.  However, with the kitchen and front counter's laid back and chill attitude you soon find out lacks customer service.  It's one thing to ask repeatedly for \\"no cheese\\" on a burger and another to continually get cheese on what you ordered.  I guess I should have understood that maybe when the front is on cell phones and the kitchen staff are drinking beers while on duty you start to see a trend in how \\"cool\\" in appearance of chill starts becoming a major fail in customer service.  To make matters worse we have ordered food to be delivered to house because we live so close.  We got a call from a local church where our order was actually delivered.  I finally threw up my hands realizing you can only give a place so many tries before you give up.  The problem is at first we chalked all the problems up to growing pains.

Today, we decided to try the Big A again.  The marinated grilled chicken sub had a good amount of chicken but there was a large piece that was pink- not white/pink but pink, not cooked.  The fish sandwich had several nice pieces of fish but tasted fishy and on 2 pieces the edges were hard as a rock.  I mean, its a miracle I didn't chip a tooth.

She went out of her way to find us a table on a very busy Friday night during restaurant week, so that we didn't have to eat our dinner at the bar. But this review is not about our heroine hostess. \\n\\nMy culinary comrade and I both chose our appetizers a la carte from the special restaurant week menu; I ordered the citrus salad with fried goat cheese, and he ordered the lobster bisque. The citrus salad itself was fresh, springy, tart, fragrant... overall wonderful. I was disappointed though to discover that the goat cheese portion of this dish was a small lonely ball of goat cheese with inadequacy issues. Admittedly, it was very good, but barely deserved mention in the name of my appetizer. The lobster bisque, however, was fantastic: thick, creamy, sweet, and seasoned perfectly. It could have benefited from just a few more lobster chunks, but it was still easily the star of the show. Note: the drinks we ordered before the appetizers had still not arrived.  Fortunately for us, the apps were the best parts of our meal (at least we enjoyed something about it)-- unfortunately for you, they are not likely to be offering these dishes anymore by the time you read this. \\n\\nIn somewhat of a rush to catch a show, we both ordered a simple cheeseburger. They were indescribably average-tasting. I managed to finish mine with some effort, but I was shocked to see my carnivorous companion struggle to get through his. Drinks arrive at some point with a half-assed apology about waiting for wine glasses. My drink, the house-made sangria, was merely acceptable. However my friend, normally an enthusiastic drinker, nursed his drink begrudgingly. My friend left his burger half-eaten. Do I want it, he asks. No, not really. This speaks volumes. \\n\\nWe both psychically agree to skip dessert when the waiter asks. \\n\\nThe bill comes, and we survey the damage. \\nTwo drinks + two apps (being soup and salad) + two burgers= $86 and change?! We had to check the math to make sure it was right. Shockingly, it was. \\n\\nI've had much better meals in Cambridge for a fraction of the price.

Okay: this is not necessarily the fault of the restaurant, but finding the valet is an atrocious experience in itself. Upon entering, the hostess staff did not greet me, and they were also dressed very casually in contrast to the restaurant staff which added to the negative first impression. I finally approached the podium and let them know I had a reservation. I waited for the rest of my party in the cocktail lounge...I sat at the bar, and again, was not greeted. When the bartender did take my order, he hastily asked what I wanted and walked away before I could complete my sentence - then returned to ask me to repeat myself. I finished my drink, my party arrived, and we went upstairs. Very noisy, but absolutely beautiful. I was hoping the negative impressions thus far would be overthrown. I was wrong: the baked oysters are on the brink of disgusting (for lack of a more dignified adjective) Drift in Roswell has wood-fired oysters for half the price and they are exquisite. I will say my server was wonderful and the management did check in about the parking fiasco and allowed us to valet after the fact which was extremely thoughtful and polite. My entree: a filet and a side of twice-baked potato: the steak was cooked perfectly, no complaints there, it was very good - the twice-baked potato, again, grotesque. Totally flat on flavor, no seasoning, not warm in the center...you could buy one at the Publix deli and it would be more pleasing to your palette. For dessert: a chocolate cake, it was mediocre at best. I went outside to retrieve my car at the valet - again, unprofessional staff. It took (no exaggeration) 15 minutes for them to retrieve my car, while the stand attendant muttered to herself, \\"Where they at?\\" without offering for me to wait inside or assure me it wouldn't be too much longer. Overall: GREAT server and floor management, great wine, great steaks...poor first impression, poor bar staff, poor kitchen staff.

It's all from scratch, no added sugar, and super fresh.  The Acapulco, Vallarta, Jamaica (see how those names work?) and so many more were just excellent.  So fresh, so tasty!

Hanabi is a nice restaurant. Really cute ambiance, pretty good (although kind of pricy) food, decent-ish service. \\n\\nOn the one hand, the sushi was pretty good. My friends and I ordered an Ahi Tuna Tower for our appetizer, and even though I hate wasabi, I thought it was really good. Light on the wasabi, more focus on the fish and the crab. I ordered a Spicy Zen Zen for myself, which was good. The fish definitely tasted fresh, and the roll was topped with spicy crunchy flakes--which I'm pretty sure were the shavings of hot Cheetos. Still, it was a good combination.\\n\\nOn the other hand, the service was kind of a mix. My server was really sweet. We tried using the free appetizer coupon on Yelp on a Saturday and didn't realize it was only available on the weekdays. She made the mistake in telling us that we could still order our appetizer and then comped it from our meal. That makes me want to say she was an awesome server!\\n\\nHowever, when we got our free appetizer (the Ahi Tower), she asked us if we wanted her to mix it (or maybe she phrased it differently than that)--which we said no to because half of us wanted to take pictures, and the other part (me) didn't want to eat it as a mix because I'm really particular about what I eat. \\n\\nBut then in a second after she asked us that, she mushed it and mixed it together. \\n\\nI'm sure it was a misunderstanding, so I know it's not really her fault. But as soon as she did that, we made it pretty obvious that we didn't want her to mix it, and though she realized she was at fault for mixing it, didn't stop. \\n\\nSo here we are, awkwardly trying to tell her to stop mixing the tower, and she keeps on keeping on. \\n\\nIt was just a really uncomfortable moment of silence where she knew we didn't want her to mix it but still kept mixing it. If she realized her customers didn't want her to mix the tower, she should at least have stopped to ask if we wanted her to continue instead of continuing to mix it on her own. We had told her it was okay that she mushed it down (I mean, it was already too late to go back)--but she definitely could have just left it at that instead of continuing to mix it. \\n\\nAll in all, I would definitely come back to Hanabi.

The food blogs have been abuzz about them for years, but again, there are so many lists and duck fat fries were buried on one of them. They're triple fried at Salty Sow, which tends to make for an awesome fry no matter what you're frying it in. The fries were very crispy and topped with two 110 minute poached eggs with a side of cold b√©arnaise sauce. The surprise here was more the b√©arnaise sauce, as I'd only ever had it warm. And on top of that, it apparently goes PERFECTLY with fries. As I perused the menu for an entr√©e, it struck me that I hadn't had fried chicken in a long while (\\"foods I've not had in forever and need to eat immediately\\" being another list). I chose the crispy chicken thighs with smashed fingerling potatoes with neck gravy. The thighs come boneless and the batter gives a crisp coating (not crunchy, if that's what you're looking for). I'd recommend hopping right in, as they might run the risk of getting a little soggy. The gravy was delicious and I'd probably drink it from a mug WITHOUT the stipulation of a date or offer of money. My friend ordered the crispy beef tongue, which had a really interesting texture (think SPAM - but not in a bad way) and a lot of flavor; a little gamey but not overwhelmingly so. It was a daily special, so if you ever see it, it's definitely worth heavy consideration. For dessert, we ordered the bananas foster beignets with nutmeg ice cream, which was the perfect portion for two people. It could be split amongst four but there wouldn't be much of the ice cream (which is awesome).\\n\\nThe d√©cor is pretty standard for the growing list of \\"New American\\" places opening up in town; Lots of wood, intimate settings for small groups, dim lighting with interesting fixtures (some shades are made of forks and spoons here), and that whole sort of thing.

My first experience here a little while back left me somewhat indifferent. The soup and salad were both satisfactory, but the pizza was just kind of okay. Some of my friends frequent the place, so when they invited the boyfriend and I to tag along last night, we enthusiastically joined (as I am incapable of turning down pizza). While trying to determine what to order, we hit the inevitable disagreement of pizza toppings. You see, we have opposing pizza philosophies: he prefers a wide assortment of toppings, the more the better; while I prefer to keep it simple. In fact, I usually order the same toppings (if they're available): goat cheese, jalapenos, and Canadian bacon. The cashier, I assume, recognized our dilemma, and informed us that they can do split toppings for pizza. So one half was the Southsider (specialty pizza) and the other was my goat cheese and jalapeno creation. I guess I forget that many places are willing to do the split toppings on pizza, but I really appreciate that they will do it for half specialty pizza and half create-your-own. Anyway... so we get our pizza, and from the looks of it I'm pretty impressed. Huge clumps of goat cheese throughout, and plenty of jalapenos and Canadian bacon to go around. They definitely don't scrimp on their toppings. And it tasted just as good as it looked. So good! I really enjoyed the hell out of this pizza. I managed to save a little to take home, and it passed the cold morning-after breakfast-pizza test with flying colors. It definitely tastes just as good cold as hot, and saves really well. I have one piece left that I've been munching on all day and I'll be sad when it's gone. \\nI subtract one star because whatever they clean the tables with is like a kick in the face of bleach odor. Really unpleasant while trying to eat or drink. I would almost rather sit at a table that's a little bit dirty than have to swallow that smell with every bite. Yuck."},{"name":"Assaggio","address":"29 Prince St","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"To be honest, when I heard the name of this place, it sounded \\"chic\\" and it made me really want to eat here. Sometimes the sounds of words can be prettier and sexier in Italian and \\"assaggio\\" supposedly is the Italian word for \\"taste\\". I think it is the right name for this place. I found the food here to be really good and tasty, not terrible. Here is what happened. \\n\\nI went with a couple people in my family, and we ordered 3 pasta dishes. I ordered the Veal and Spicy Sausage Cacciatore, while the other 2 ordered Shrimp Scampi and Spaghetti Carbonara. The Veal and Spicy Sausage Cacciatore consists of sliced veal, sausage, peppers, mushrooms and onions over spaghetti doused with tomato sauce. The veal and sausage was pretty good, they were cooked just right, and the vegetables were also really good. Tomato sauce was definitely not thick, but definitely not watery. I put some parmesan cheese on the sauce and pasta, and it actually made a difference in the flavor and the pasta tastier. \\n\\nI sampled the other dishes. I think the Shrimp Scampi is a good choice. The shrimp was big, plump and tasty. Spaghetti Carbonara is a dish originally from the Lazio area of Italy, and it is probably one of the most famous pasta dishes from Rome. The sauce is made from whipped eggs and topped with pieces of bacon/ham. I have not eaten this dish since visiting Italy several months ago, so I had low expectations. I took one bite of this dish, and I was impressed. I really liked the texture of the pasta, and the light creaminess of the sauce. It was a tasty pasta dish, and tasted very similar to that same pasta dish I had in Rome. It may not taste exactly like Spaghetti Carbonara in Rome, but it's a good choice for a pasta with less meat. \\n\\nBread is good, the crust was not rough to chew, and the texture of the inside of the bread was very soft. Dipping it in the tomato sauce from my pasta dish made the bread tastier. Prices for the pasta dishes are decent, all of them are under $20, but above $12. A pasta dish, with a few pieces of bread will definitely fill up your stomach, unless you are planning to go to an Italian bakery or cafe to get some dessert such as cannoli or gelato. \\n\\nAs for interior, I thought it was a little tawdry and gaudy and lacking a little in refined elegance. This was mainly due to the slightly colorful paintings on the wall and the statues. The beverage refrigerator is placed right at the entrance, making the hallway look narrow and awkward. Service was decent, they were proper and always made sure our glasses were filled with water. One thing notable about this place was that this was probably the only Italian restaurant I have been to where the waitstaff was all ladies. That might be a good thing or a bad thing. \\n\\nOverall, despite the somewhat tawdry and gaudy interior, this is a decently good choice to get some tasty pasta dishes. I also think it is a good alternative compared to the more well-known Italian places in the North End. It may not be an ideal place to have a dinner appointment, but it's not a bad choice."},{"name":"Salty Sow","address":"1917 Manor Rd","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"Salty Sow's happy hour just can.

There are so many different combinations it is almost overwhelming to look at the menu - especially when you realize that each smoothie uses about the same six fruits. I think it would be better to just list the fruit options and tell people they get to pick three fruits...but I eventually decided on what to try. Can't go wrong with any of them! I do wish they had more add-on options, though, and more vegetables to add in, like avocado or something. They have veggie juices, but no smoothie option had both fruits and veggies, that I saw.

The clientele is an intriguing mix of hard-edged, craggy-faced, middle-aged locals during afternoons, early evenings and weekdays, and nod-your-head Tufts students and younger area bros and girls during the nights and weekends - they come to jump and scream to the DJ'd, bass-propelled club music that shakes the club during those hours.\\n\\nPick your poison. Personally, I love going during when those hard-edged, craggy-faced, middle-aged locals are there and a game is on the television (it's a GREAT place to watch the Bruins), so you can hear them roll their aaahrs, yell at Tuukka Rask or Kevin Garnett, and talk about how the plumbing is out on the second floor of their house. It's a warm, welcoming atmosphere.\\n\\nGreat group of bartenders working there, too - good dudes, all - and the owner, Froggy (you can't miss him) is an absolute pisser of a guy. Surprisingly good beer selection with plenty of stuff on tap (Natural Light is available, if you're a masochist) and the wings - cooked on the grill and slathered in sauce - aren't to be missed. Very, very good sandwiches, too; I'm a big fan of the steak and cheese, which is cooked to perfection and dripping with melted American. Add some peppers and onions to make it even awesome-r. There's always some good specials - check the board outside to see what they have in store. \\n\\nSo, in summary - a great neighborhood bar that you're guaranteed to have a good time and some good wings at.

I hate leaving reviews like this. I had dinner tonight (May 7, 2013) at the Stanford's next to the Nordstrom at the Lloyd Center Mall. Nice looking place, very helpful and nice waiters that were very attentive to keeping my ice tea full. I ordered a garden salad and for the entree  garlic chicken with green beans, mushrooms and mash potatoes. The salad arrived and I immediately thought that my dining experience was about to go south quick. The lettuce in my salad was spread out on the plate as though they had run out of lettuce and there were big gaps where you could see the plate. It looked odd and cheap. I finished it in a matter of a few moments-have to say that the taste was very good but it was bizarrely small. \\n\\nI was right-my dining experience was about to leave me underwhelmed. My chicken entree was next and arrived just smaller than my palm in size and flat as though it was frozen(I'm going to guarantee that it was frozen). I was able to cut it into 5 polite pieces and that was it. Man that chicken was TOUGH to chew through. It looked very similar to the cut of chicken you get in the frozen bag's at Trader Jo's although this would have been one of smaller ones in the bag-and no offense to Trader Jo's by the way. Mash potatoes tasted like they were from a box and were lumpy. Beans overcooked, mushrooms REALLY overcooked. What can I say, I was starving so I ate it. My normally iron-clad stomach is a bit sore as I type this.\\n\\nI get the smaller-portions concept for fine-food but for a mid-range restaurant like Stanford's the portions need to step up a bit. I mean, would piling on some more lettuce add that much to your costs? It was quiet tonight so there's no reason for the food to be that overcooked. My bill was $28.15 before the tip which seemed easily double what it should have been. \\n\\nPortland is an amazing town for food. Most of my worst experiences are here on Yelp which says a lot over 5 years since I eat out a lot. I can skip Stanford's next time for sure as there is almost an endless supply of great food elsewhere."},{"name":"Life of Pie Pizza","address":"3632 N Williams Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"I love pizza.

The rack of lamb ribs was probably the star or the meal--smokey, sweet, meatey, and perfectly seasoned. I appreciated that none of the proteins came pre-sauced. Instead each table had four sauce varieties to choose from (mustard, vinegar, regular, and spicy.) None were outstanding, but all were good. The protein portions weren't enormous, which is good because this left room for the ample sides. The side portion of mac and cheese was nearly as big as the entree portions I've had at other restaurants. The bbq beans were tasty as well, though I preferred the braised greens.

I went back once, then once again on Valentines day with a couple of friends and there was a free 4 roses bourbon tasting that I had seen advertised on instagram that we thought would be fun. We went at about 5:30 and got dinner, and sat and chatted while drinking a delicious bloody mary that was unfortunately mostly ice. Once it hit 7, which was the time for the tasting, we were asked to move from our table ( we were sitting at the table the tasting would be at). We said that we were waiting for the tasting and an employee told us we needed a ticket. He didn't tell us where or how to obtain a ticket. So we left. We waited an hour for nothing. \\nUpset about this, I commented on the instagram I saw advertising the tasting saying that they didn't tell us where to get tickets for a free event. I was responded quickly and kindly by someone who I do not know from the instagram page and they offered my friend and I our next meal free.\\nSo we went back tonight, and I awkwardly had to show my conversation about my review and getting our free food to the same guy that told us we needed to leave since we didn't have a ticket last time. He apologized a few times (and I felt so bad cause he's so cute). They kindly took our order and everything was free. Unfortunately, they had mistaken my friends order and gave her the same thing as me. She ordered a Fat farmer (veggie burger) and I ordered a chicken biscuit. Now it may be just me, but I feel like you should try very hard to not mistakenly give a vegetarian meat. They fixed it quickly and gave her a free slice of pie. \\nAlso, yes the bathrooms are terrible. They're dark, the toilet seats are all metal and cold, and the water out of the sinks is cold. The hand dryer is cool though. \\nWe really liked their food but will not be going back. They've messed up too much for us.

I wasn't expecting a trendy southern style ambience.  There's not much to choose from in this restaurant. I've decided to order the curry popcorn with candied peanuts $4 ( $1 off happy hour) and Dewberry chicken $18.  If you're overly hungry I suggest ordering a small plate with your main entree. The Dewberry  comes with squash and some other veggie. What you're actually getting is crispy skin chicken breast  with a line of puree squash, 2 sliver of dehydrated radish, and 2 microscopic cubes of mangoes. What appears to be lacking in quantity they made up for in taste. This dish was wonderfully created from the well seasoned squash, fresh clean taste of the chicken to the 2 small cubes of sweet mango. The hints of flavor teases your palette that you are left craving for more. Their homemade hot sauce has a delicate combination of heat and peppery spice which is not too overpowering. It's a perfect pair for my chicken. Oh and the curried popcorn. My friends were not a fan of the curried popcorn.  However i love the union of curry spices and the candied peanut. It's not salty at all but its packed with curry spices that salt is not necessary.  All in all food was great.... oh and I tried the fried beans as well. Delicious!

All in all this was a very poor experience, and it's very expensive for what you are getting in terms of quality.

Of course, I got one of each to try. To my disappointment they didn't look fresh and a bit small. Not what I was expecting from a seafood house. Probably that's why they got this promo going on.\\n\\n-Coconut prawn and scallops (4/5-$15): You get three prawns and two scallops served to you in a spoon filled with coconut milk broth. This was super delicious. Both the prawns and scallops were cooked perfectly and the coconut milk broth was a delight. The side salad it came with was weak. It had no dressing and was just greens put on a plate.\\n\\n-Appetizer platter (3.5/5-$15 pp): It consists of Abacore tuna tartare, Qualicum Bay scallops wrapped in European double smoked bacon, mandarin orange and lime sauteed tiger prawns, smoked salmon and goat cheese timbale. The tuna tartare was disappointing. The tuna was dark in color (not the good one). It's suppose to be a vibrant red, but no this didn't look nor tasted fresh. It was served on top of a deepfried nori which was not crunchy either. The scallops wrapped in bacon was tasty. The prawns were also good. I liked the sauce that came with it. Tasted like herbs with butter and a bit of citrus but I remember the server saying something about brandy. The smoked salmon & goat cheese is pretty straightforward - can't go wrong with that. The crostini that came with it tasted good. It was drizzled with some balsamic. Yum!\\n\\n-Rack of lamb (4/5-$33): I asked for medium rare but it came out medium well done. That's a fail. BUT it was so tender and still moist I did not complain. It was well seasoned and didn't require any sauce. Looking back at the menu in hindsight, I didn't get any prosciutto and I'm pretty sure it wasn't a brandy sauce. It tasted like a red wine reduction that was taken too far that it turned sour with a slight bitterness. Oh this dish was so elegantly plated that it came with an edible flower that looked like an orchid....and I ate it. I asked first though. Verdict: Flowers aren't really my thing.\\n\\n-Chocolate bomb (3.5/5-$9): Usually not a chocolate fan but ordered this for the theatrical effect. I sort of got it. It certainly wasn't what I saw others had on their instagram. The chocolate shell was lovely. Very rich and sweet chocolate flavours mixed with some peanuts. This would pair well with a cup of espresso or simply milk. \\n\\nDrinks:\\n\\n-Full sail (5/5-$6.95): Pineapple, vodka and gingerale\\n-Elderflower fizz (5/5-$3.50)\\n-Sangria (5/5- Free with yelp check -in)\\n\\nOverall, I'd give this place a 3.5 star rating with a round up to 4 stars.

I've been to Salty Sow in its previous incarnations and must say that the redo is lovely, albeit a bit heavy on the piggy artwork. Good lighting, comfy chairs, tables with plenty of elbow room, and decent acoustics that allow you to easily hold a conversation with your dining companions. \\n\\n- The drinks. I had the Blanche, a blood orange margarita that totally hit the spot with just enough tang to keep it kicky. There were several other beverages that I plan to try when I return for happy hour. A side note: I think the mixologist may have a sweet tooth because many of the libations involved sugary, fruity ingredients moreso than the typical cocktail menu.\\n\\n- The food. Standouts at the table included the brussels sprout leaves (the combination of salty pecorino, sweet raisins, and crispy veggies was addictive), the petite bone-in filets (fantastically flavorful), and the milk-braised pork shoulder (a warm, cozy dish that felt like elevated home cooking). Oh, and I have a little obsession with butterscotch budino, so we had to end the meal with that. All four spoons descended upon that dessert with gusto.\\n\\nCons:\\n\\n- The service. We may have gone on an off night because it seems like many other reviewers rave about the waitstaff. We arrived right on time for our reservation and stood there for several minutes before the hostess acknowledged us. She then showed us to our seats and literally tossed the specials card onto the middle of the table before walking away. Weird. Our waiter was enthusiastic and personable, but lacked finesse. When we were making small talk while ordering, he informed us that our friends' lunch destination was his favorite restaurant in all of Austin. Hmm...we're sitting in your restaurant right now, sir. The busser cleared plates as people finished, rather than waiting for the entire table to wrap-up before clearing. I realize that I'm a hold out for old-school etiquette and this is commonplace these days, but it's a personal pet peeve of mine. And, the waiter delivered our check before even asking if we wanted dessert. We had to inform him that we weren't quite done yet and would like to review the dessert options.

Each selection was a pile of one thing - be it potatoes or chicken or garbanzo beans - with like a measly Tablespoon of sauce on it - all of which gets soaked up by the rice - leaving no wetness behind whatsoever.  The sauce in the Channa wasn't even rich and curry-like, it looked more like soup broth.\\n\\nHonestly the best dish was the Biryani because at least I expect that to be dry and bland.\\n\\nThe one nice thing is that it's reasonably priced.  The combo plates are $7 which would be a screaming deal if the food were good.  And the guy was nice enough.  I feel bad giving a poor review to a start-up cart with a nice guy in it but unfortunately I have to judge it based mostly on the quality of the food since it is afterall a food cart.\\n\\nMaybe they're just getting past opening day jitters?  I kinda doubt it though because literally - it would take 5 times more sauce to even approach an acceptable level.  It wasn't even close.\\n\\nSauce it up guys!

Meanwhile, I notice the woman to the right of us didn't eat her meal which was late. I'm not sure what happened there. My date doesn't really like marinade on his steak tips, I do, so he takes a chance on them. Way too tangy even for me. I ordered the haddock. Some weird sweet taste or marinade was on the haddock. The menu said only lemon and garlic so I'm confused. I know taste is a matter of...well, taste, so I'm sure it might be delicious to someone else. \\nPortions were ok. It's supposed to be \\"Grill House\\" however the largest steak they had was 12 oz. That's ok for most but generally a steak house will have a selection of sizes. And no prime rib on the menu.

Not a $20/person lobster, but something regular, quick... but fresh and tasty.  Weekdays noon to 3, this is your place.  $3.99 for soup and one of about 30 mains.  That's not a typo.  Party of four, we ordered four dishes.  All solid and satisfying.  Kung Pao Shrimp was the smallest and probably the least impressive -- not that many shrimp, not that much of anything else either.  On the other hand fish with vegetables had ample sliced fish and a huge amount of bok choy (or a similar green vegetable).  Squid with scallions was also very good -- probably 20+ chunks of squid, lots of vegetables, and an appropriate, tasty sauce.\\n\\nWe asked for spicy.  It came out normal -- not bland, but no heat.  Maybe they saw white customers and thought we couldn't take it.  \\n\\nClearly all cooked to order.  Very hot, completely fresh.  Partially open kitchen, nothing hidden, chefs working hard.\\n\\nOutside the restaurant, multiple large signs touted the lunch specials.  Inside, we were seated and offered ordinary dinner menus and higher-priced combination menus much less to our liking (deep-fried General Tsaos, deep-fried Egg Rolls, etc.).  Got up, looked at the host's station, and found the $3.99 menus matching the larger and nicer selection presented outside.  Not sure if the waiter forgot to give that to us, thought we wouldn't want it, wanted to upsell us, or what.  It's tempting to jump to conclusions but I'll give them the benefit of the doubt.\\n\\nWe're not big tea drinkers so we were pleased to see that the bill did not charge for the tea they had automatically brought to the table.  That seems fair but is not always the case.\\n\\nOur food came out quickly, but then the place got mobbed (weekday peak times seem to be 12:15-1:00, as you'd expect given office schedules).

The sauce for it was a little sweet--maybe add some vinegar from the sauces they provide. The takoyaki was pretty good, but also sweet. The fried rice had a nice amount of different types of seafood, including some really big pieces of flaky and tasty fried fish. The curry noodles were also tasty by virtue of the fact that they're fat noodles, but their flavor wasn't remarkable.\\n\\nI really wanted to like this place so I'm sad to not have loved it.

I also appreciated the little crunch of bacon on the egg. Yolk mixture was very creamy and flavorful.\\n-Honey rosemary dipped fried chicken looked plain, but had such a great taste. I was impressed by the fresh texture of the chicken and the good mix of gravy. I love eating my chicken with gravy, so this was a treat for me. It also comes with a heavily honey-ed biscuit that was fluffy in texture.\\n-Duck fat fries were topped with a runny duck egg. Fries did not stand out to me, but the dipping sauce and topped egg was a good mix.\\n-Genuine blackened redfish had all bones removed and came with a great seasoning on top of a generous slice of fish. Quinoa and lentils were tucked under the fish that created a tasty sauce. Dish had a large smoked tomato on the side. Highly recommend taking all components and eating it together in one bite. Yum.\\n-I had a HH Rosemary's Piglet. Good amount of bubbles and the right pom mixture. The rosemary really enhanced the drink itself.

The chipotle slaw was really good with a nice kick. The pinto beans were everything I want in pinto beans, a medium thick base, a good kick, and packed full of flavor. I could eat those all day. Then I had the sancho loco sandwich. It was the loco since it had the pork guts sausage, chopped brisket, and pulled pork. What can I say? I needed all my food groups! The red onion slaw was such a nice complement to the meats and cut through those flavors. Now onto the pork guts link of sausage. This is everything you want in a link of smoked sausage.

I, too, feel the need to dispel some of the negative reviews by explaining how I obtained a 5-star experience.  First, I have never ordered off of the menu.  I go with friends and order a dollar limit omakase.  I've done the $15 and $20 and both times I left full and happy.  Second, I don't go in expecting anything in particular and I don't have dietary restrictions.  I go with a big appetite expecting to try new things.  If these two things are okay with you then you are set to enjoy this place.  I wouldn't recommend this place to people with food allergies as the kitchen is a tiny space where it would be impossible to separate foods.  \\n\\nOn to the food.  Ordering the omakase is essentially ordering a 6-course meal of inventive, tasty dishes you would never make at home.  The kimchi is amazing; spicy, thick slices of cabbage.  I LOVE the quail eggs in cinnamon sauce.  They are creamy and zesty.  Here is an example of something I would never make at home nor think to order but there it is.  YUM.  On this last visit about a week ago, I was served an amazing thinly sliced sausage with wasabi mustard, wild boar fried rice, oysters topped with kimchi shaved ice, a duck and mushroom salad, and seaweed salad with pickled onion among other delicious concoctions.  The highlights though were the best pork belly I have ever encountered and a creamy shrimp cashew dish.  The pork belly was cooked to perfection and I have been on a mission with my boyfriend in search of delicious pork belly and have tried a few (Ned Ludd the week before was a fail).  The shrimp dish was flavored expertly and I could not put my chopsticks down even though I was full as this was part of course 5. I recall from the visit I made in the summer having a shrimp fried rice and declaring it was the best fried rice I'd ever eaten in my life.  In fact, I don't think I'll eat fried rice from any old Chinese take-out restaurant again.  I've been spoiled by Tanuki.   \\n\\nThe sake and beer selection is brilliant.  A variety of tasty Asian beers and sake of all styles.  The ambience is as the others posted, dark and cozy with random Japanamation on the tube.  This is a two person operation covering the kitchen and the front of the house and they have a great operation.  Their teamwork is solid and their delivery seems practiced and purposeful.  I don't mind being patient when I am in for a long evening of drinks and dinner with friends.  All in all, this is the type of place you go out to dinner at:  a long enjoyable evening filled with unique, well-prepared food you wouldn't make at home in a small, cozy restaurant with great alcohol to choose from."},{"name":"IHOP","address":"1675 28th St","city":"Boulder","stars":"2.5","text":"Can I put zero down for this IHOP? I'm writing this review for my son, who visited the IHOP last weekend with his friend at about 10:30PM. It took about 10 minutes for them to be seated and about another 10 minutes until the server took their order. Then the wait began, and continued. maybe 20-30 minutes later the cook comes out and says to my son and his friend that the previous cook left the kitchen a  f$&@ing mess and it had to be cleaned. The server did offer a free appetizer, which never arrived. When the check was delivered the server apologized for the kitchen being a total s$&/ hole. After maybe an hour and quarter total, the food was finally delivered and was not up to IHOPs normal quality level (note: this IHOP is typically the worst of the IHOPs we've visited across the country). After waiting another 5+ minutes (it's after midnight and the place is essentially empty now) to be able to pay, my son and his friend left.\\n\\nMy son called me at quarter to one in the morning to tell me this story, as he had to blow off some steam about it. I was totally appalled, when I heard the story. It's nice the cook wanted to clean up, but two employees cursing in front of customers is inexcusable, as was the long the wait. If the kitchen wasn't in working order, the the place should not have been open. Also, with service like this, the meals should have been comped and in good faith a couple of gift cards should have been provided.\\n\\nWe will never visit the Boulder IHOP again."},{"name":"Life of Pie Pizza","address":"3632 N Williams Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"One of the best Margherita Pizzas I've ever had...if not the best.

They also had Connect Four and Rubix Cubes laying around which I liked (instead of staring down at your phone). When you get to the table, they also have coloring books. \\n\\nANYWAYS, the food. I'm not sure if the menu is always like this but they have both sweet and savory options, and you can choose two as your meal. I got the eggs Benedict over potatoes and a waffle with graham crackers, blueberries and whipped cream on top. I like the sweeter one a little bit more, it was delicious. \\n\\nIt's definitely a nice place to go to after riding your bike in the rain (which is what I did), and I also forgot my bike helmet where I was sitting. I came back for it and they had it behind the bar, which was great. The manager also remembered my name, which was pretty nice.

La Barbecue has nestled it's way deep into my heart for many reasons, but I truly love La Barbecue because it accesible to me. If I want the most delicious barbecue Austin has to offer, it's no longer a daunting 90 minute wait away. I can just pop over to La Barbecue and wait 20-30 minutes at most. For now. \\n\\nBut I will write this review because La Barbecue deserves every bit of the success and hoards of customers that will eventually be extending the line out the parking lot and down the street.\\n\\nFree beer, and live music. I know that's been said but I'm sure you haven't truly taken it to heart. FREE beer, LIVE music.

I'm just going to say it, I think it might be at or around perfect. It's so good that I would eat the brisket fat off of a strangers tray. I would eat this brisket out of the trash, maybe even off of the dirt floor. \\n\\nThe guts are great. Real spicy, juicy, snappy, smokey. \\n\\nThe beef ribs. See brisket.\\n\\nThe turkey is what blew me away. Not because it's better than everything else, but because I was always like, \\"turkey? nah I'll save room for brisket thanks\\" But one of the employees was generous enough to give me a try of the turkey and it knocked my socks off. I may go back for just the turkey. Best bbq turkey ever. I wasn't aware that turkey could be juicy. I took one bite and was surprised I didn't have juices running all down my face and all over my clothes. SO MOIST and flavorful.\\n\\nThe pulled pork was also outrageously good.\\n\\nHaven't had the pork ribs, yet. I'm only one girl, here.\\n\\nThe service is the best I've experienced in Austin.

We were very happy with our waitress - and the host was great. When we got our prime rib it looked beautiful on the plate but even with the sharp steak knife was almost impossible to cut or chew. I ask the waitress to ask the chief what grade of meat it was (select - choice - or prime) and she came back and said that the people in the kitchen did not know. HOW is this even possible! I was able to eat 3oz of the meat and my partner chewed and spit out almost all of his. The green beans were I guess fresh but so under cooked and were stringy raw to chew. The mashed GARLIC potatoes were good but cold.  I ask the waitress about rolls or bread and she said they did not serve bread although she found me an old hard sliver of bread.  She did her best also with giving us two free soft drinks. I really felt sorry for her.

They open at 11:00 am but what's better about La Barbecue's wait?  Free breakfast beer for the wait!  It's a trailer, the line is tented and there are picnic tables.  We started chatting with the girls behind us, best friends from childhood in Georgia, one now living in Austin and the other living in Seattle.  Seattle was visiting Austin for the first time.  A jet lagged artist and her chatty friend in advertising.  Cool people.  The guy in front of us, we'll call him better looking Casey Afflek with Ryan Reynolds fast talking wit, was complaining about the line after they opened.  He said that the people in line just needed to order and move along, like the Soup Nazi line.  Instead, he complained that these people, after being in line for over an hour, just start studying the menu when they get to the window.  We assured him that we knew what we were getting.  They are known for their beef ribs.  As we get closer to the window, the girl states that there was a delivery problem yesterday and they don't have the beef ribs that day.  Bummer!  So better looking Casey Afflek, says, \\"Well, it's not their fault, just don't order a sandwich, I will flip your tray if you order a sandwich!\\"  We assure him that we would be ordering beef brisket, pulled pork, pork ribs, sausage and chipotle slaw and that we would complete our order in less than a minute, no chitchatting with the girl at the window.

She said 8:45 was available, so we went for that. And I am so glad we did.\\n\\nWe were seated in the front porch area, which was a little chilly at first but then she noticed we were cold and bumped up the heat a bit. Our server was just fantastic. She was just the right level of nutty and so very good at her job--it's not that often that service adds to the experience, but here it really made it that much better.\\n\\nAfter getting a glass of wine and agonizing over what on earth we were going to choose from the menu (I think there was nothing I wouldn't have loved to order), we settled on a quite substantial meal. In fact, when we ordered, the server warned us that we had ordered a lot of food...and we might not have room for dessert. But that was really OK, as neither of us tend to be focused on that part of the meal and usually skip it. We started with the seasonal vegetable salad (all salads should be this amazing--off the charts delicious, filled with interesting vegetables that were blanched but still bright and crispy) and the meatballs (reminding us both just how luxurious a good meatball can be). Then we moved to a primi pasta dish each (half orders--but these were quite generous). We had the Bucatini Amatriciana (it looked so plain when it arrived, with a few slices of guanciala on a bed of bucatini in a tomato sauce, but it was the surprise of the night with a subtle spiciness and bright tomato freshness that were perfectly balanced) and the Parparadelle with rabbit ragout (a favorite dish of ours, and this one did not disappoint, rich and savory). After ordering another glass of wine, out came our main dishes: veal osso bucco (a classic, and classically done with a nice touch of some shishito or similar peppers that gave a great counterpoint to the velvety richness of the dish) and steelhead trout (perfectly cooked on a bed of veggies and cauliflower puree, with olives and capers--to die for, I didn't even want to share! :)).\\n\\nAfter all of this food, we still eyed the desert menu, but there was just no way, and then our server brought us out a nice little glass of muscato d'asti which was sweet but slightly effervescent, and such a perfect end to a perfect meal.\\n\\nThe pace of the meal was wonderful, allowing us to spend 2 hours really enjoying the flavors and giving us time in between each course to relax and chat and not feel one bit rushed. \\n\\nHeavenly, a top meal of my life, not a single misstep, and next time I'm in town I'm definitely going here again.

My boyfriend and I sat on the patio, on the edge of the covered part near the open air. We weren't near the breeze of a fan like many of the other patio tables, and when we got our food, started getting attacked by flies.  We got a couple of drinks and a small appetizer that we ate quickly, but when we got our mains which were two huge portions of meat, that took much longer to eat and were more fragrant due to what they were, the attack of the flying insects got a lot worse. My boyfriend covered the pot his dish came in with a napkin while he was eating, and I eventually had to sacrifice my napkin to do the same.  My pork chop was also extremely salty, and I wasn't that into either of our mains. When our server finally returned, we had finished as much as we could of our food, having swatted flies the entire pre-gratuity $90 meal.  We told her why our plates were covered and she said she'd send a manager over to talk to us-at her own suggestion, not our request, and we waited 15 minutes for this person, but they never came. Finally our server returned instead, and basically said sorry that happened, if you'd said something earlier we could have moved you though.  I told her that it really wasn't bothering us until we got our food, when it got progressively worse and worse to the point we had to cover up our plates.  She said she could get a manager if we wanted.. I stated that she already told us one was coming to talk to us (again, at her suggestion, not our request), and we had already waited around for a good while for this person after we were ready to go.. for nothing.  Neither of us wanted to hang out there anymore, and of course, as soon as our food was gone, so were the flies. We eat out at restaurants of similar quality and price point a lot, and giving your server feedback on problems or concerns is a pretty standard, usually seamless and neutral part of the experience.  We weren't expecting or asking for a comped meal or significant discount or anything, but we didn't appreciate waiting around for a manager who never showed up, only to be blamed for the unsanitary problem with our meal and made to feel that our concerns didn't matter at all.  We both felt disrespected as returning guests, and like we didn't get to enjoy the food (and over 20% gratuity) we'd just paid for.  It put a really bad taste in our mouths, both because the flies were annoying and gross, and we were shown that our concerns about the experience weren't remotely important to the staff.  Based on how we were treated today, I'm sure the owners either won't respond, or continue blowing it off. Hopefully they at least get more fans or other fly deterrents so other guests don't have to have this problem.

It is not bad for the price you pay @ $25 all you can eat.  Food was fresh- some apps and entree's lacked a little seasoning, such as the grilled steak.  Quality of sushi was alright.  I do agree with other reviewers that if you're looking for volume, this is the place to get it.  I wish I had read the review from one of the diners prior to going last night.  I did not know whether they charged our table for any leftover food (there was barely any-- maybe there was a bite here and there on our last 2 or 3 dishes of the evening).  My Godfather picked up the tab.  Had I known about the possible charge for leftover food, I would've taken a quick glance to check.  \\n\\nService:\\nAlthough the staff was friendly and courteous, you can tell they were quite amateurs as waitstaff.  First of all, we had brought a cake with us for my mom's birthday.  The cake was stashed inside the kitchen so we could surprise her at end of dinner.   You would think if you had any questions about the cake, you would ask the person who brought it (which was my mother-in-law).  Well, not the case here-- guess whom they approached?  Yep, the birthday girl herself.  Surprise ruined.  Aside from that, as I mentioned, the staff was friendly but service was slow.  The restaurant was at full capacity, but because this was not a buffet style dining, the waitstaff had to run back/forth all night for every table's food.  While it is nice to be served at a sit-down dinner, from a business perspective, it turns away many customers since this hinders turnaround.  We could have completed the meal in 60-90 minutes, tops.  With the slow service due to this type of dining experience, we were there for 3 hours.\\n\\nOverall, I would revisit this establishment again if I am looking for volume but I would have to be sure that I have 3 hours to spare in order  not to be agitated by the wait."},{"name":"la Barbecue","address":"2027 E Cesar Chavez St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"The reason for the 5 star rating is for the beef rib. That is what made the decision for not going to Franklin's, worth it for me.  The perfect amount of salt and pepper, along with the great marbling of the rib, created an extraordinary crust. It is what I was hoping for and expected out of the brisket.  I feel that it fell short of Franklin's brisket, and a few other local barbecue establishments. Was it good yes, was it worth a 5 star rating, no.\\n I like to give positive reviews, so maybe the brisket I had did not get enough seasoning on it. It had a nice colored smoke ring, but with very little flavor as expected in Texas barbecue. Also, the detail to a uniform cut of brisket was not to be found.  It would have been fine as a chopped sandwich, but personally I look for a cut of brisket to be around 3/8\\" thick. What I was served was closer to 3/4\\"- 1\\" cut. If it would have had a thick flavorful crust, it probably would how been fine at that size. \\n\\nThis is just my thoughts but if you are looking for excellent beef ribs on a weekday, go to La Barbecue! If it's a once in a lifetime experience for brisket, Franklin's is where I will be going next time.

My friend ordered the Tandoori platter (non-veg) and we had an order of the Roti & Na'an bread to start.\\nI can still taste the Masala in my mouth as i type this... and its sending me down memory lane full of aromatic indian spices and flavor!! my dish was great, the waiter did an excellent job suggesting that dish over the other one i wanted.  the roti was good, nothing special.   the na'an was VERY GOOD! it was piping hot, fresh outta the oven! and super soft and chewy and doughy..and super soft...and so so gooood.  i LOOVE na'an bread and if i get bad bread, it can just kill the whole good experience i might have been having before it.  \\nWith all my gorging of my own dish, i didnt even bother to steal a bite of my friends... darn."},{"name":"La Famiglia Giorgio's","address":"112 Salem St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"Very pricey but very good.

We'd drive by with friends and I'd always say, we have to try it out.  Well, I got my chance to do so today.  My plans to go out with the kids got cancelled and my brother called me up.  Hmmmmmmmm where should we eat.  HEY!  Lets try the new place out.  Some kind of Chinese BBQ house.\\n\\nWith that we were not sure what we were in for.  Wondered if it was like the typical BBQ joints that we grew up with that were famous for RIBs and Roast Chicken and stuff.  Memphis Blues kind of food.  Or was it going to be like a Korean BBQ or even Japanese BBQ?\\n\\nThe latter was the closest.  I hadn't thought of Chinese version of Yakitori, but this was what it was to my brother and myself.  \\n\\nUpon entering, I was happy all of a sudden.  The wooden furniture and earthy feeling with lots of natural light made me feel good just to be there.  The smell of cook meats over a grill and the scent of cumin infused lamb.  I think I was sold before I could even order.\\n\\nWe tried an assortment of skewers, from lamb to beef to pork and chicken wings.  Had some black fungus, which for under $5 was a good deal compared to other places that served this dish.\\n\\nI wouldn't call their skewers top notch. I think they're still working it out.  However it is good and I will give this place a solid notch of 3 stars for BBQ items. 3.5 stars for the appetizers that we had and a 4 star for our lamb soup that we shared.  I really enjoyed the broth.  Quite tasty, not overly salted clear broth and not too oily.\\n\\nService was nice.  Available in well spoken Chinese Mandarin and English.\\nThe only let down was the spicy chicken wings which were marinated.  The meat looked a bit raw, but was probably cooked, but just because it was marinated.  I didn't bother to finish them or tell them I thought it should be cooked a few minutes more.  They're regular chicken wings on a skewer were tasty.\\n\\nLoved  the wooden furniture.\\nLoved the atmosphere.\\nLiked the food.\\n\\nI would recommend it for a try and see for your self."},{"name":"Thai Bloom","address":"3800 SW Cedar Hills Blvd","city":"Beaverton","stars":"4","text":"After seeing such high ratings I ventured to try something new with the boyfriend and friends.

The service was absolutely horrible I believe our waitress came to our table a grand total of two times and it wasn't even to replenish our drinks in which we had to hunt down people when both our water and alcoholic beverages were empty. Then we waited over an hour for our actual meal to come to us only after the chef came to us a mere 10 minutes prior to our food being served to tell us we can't take out a certain seasoning....

I settled for a chocolate concoction of chocolate layered pastry with almonds mixed in (just forgot the name!) and a napoleon and both were amazing! \\n\\nIf you're buying a pastry, know that it will run you around $5 or so each, but once you get past the price for an upscale pastry shop, you'll realize the chocolate's divine and they don't skimp on flavor for anything! The napoleon was my favorite mostly because I actually found the chocolate to be almost TOO powerful and the napoleon was just a bit softer. The crusts were flaky and the filling was creamy, but not too sweet like I was just eating plain frosting. \\n\\nAnything in here would make an excellent addition for a birthday or anniversary celebration or when someone you know is craving something sweet. \\n\\nI also see a lot of people studying in here or enjoying afternoon tea, it doesn't matter what the time, the place seems to be consistently full of people!"},{"name":"Amaya's Taco Village","address":"5804 N Interstate 35","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"Been a loyal patron since the early-mid 80's.

The table next to us got the Turkish Meze plate which looked like a great vegetarian option.\\n\\nFor dinner, we ordered the pork chop ($28) and rack of lamb ($29). The meat was all cooked to our liking, but really was not worth the price tags. The best part was the pancetta risotto accompanying the lamb and the ricotta dumplings accompanying the pork chop. Note: the pork chop was HUGE. I had to take half of it home with me.\\n\\nThe cocktails didn't look too inventive so we ordered the cardamom rice pudding with fried bananas instead. YUM! Less liquidy than its Indian counterpart, kheer, and the fried bananas -- well, what's not to love?\\n\\nThe service declined over the night due to the influx of customers throughout the night.

I had to move our table out of the way to get through, but not without bumping theirs in the process. My purse was also right up against the woman sitting next to me. Any time I moved, it would touch her. I'm sure she would've said something about it to her friend, had we not been sitting so close, I could hear the conversations of both tables on either side of us clearly.\\n\\nMy husband and I decided to share a plate so we weren't walking around with leftovers. We ordered the carbonara, his favorite Italian dish. The waitress brought us two pieces of bread with oil and balsamic dip to start. She didn't seem the least bit interested in serving us. At a good restaurant, this isn't too big a deal, but at a bad restaurant, it's fuel to the fire.\\n\\nThe bread itself was nothing special. Not sure if it was just me, but I tasted a hint of banana, like it was a little on sweet side. When we were finished, the waitress cleared the plates, but did not offer us anymore bread. I get it, it costs money to serve free food, but the offer would've been greatly appreciated from a place that is lacking in other respects.\\n\\nOnce we got our dish, it was nothing to look at--just noodles in a bowl with some black pepper and bits of meat. It tasted as bland as it looked too. The noodles were chewy and it seemed like the only seasoning they added was the black pepper. The meat had hardly any impact on the flavor. The sauce was so sparse, I couldn't even tell what it was. Not to mention, we were starving. Anything tastes amazing when you're starving...so I once thought.\\n\\nAfter leaving the restaurant, my husband asked what I thought about the meal and I told him I wished we would've ordered the \\"crazy Alfredo\\" instead. Both tables next to us had ordered it. It looked delicious and sounded like it would be from the menu description. My husband said he overheard the guy next to us telling his friend that it wasn't good at all and that it was too spicy. He even left half of it behind and refused a to-go box. \\n\\nBad for him, good for me because now I don't regret not ordering it.

We were leaving the ACL music festival and happened upon this little gem. A real low key establishment with a simple concept, good pizza! Even the architecture of this building reminded me of the parlors I have worked for in the past. My wife and I walked into the store and found the kitchen to be exposed so the public can watch these talented kids toss, spin, and top their pizzas! At this moment I realized we should order two pizzas, got to think ahead as breakfast is right around the corner. We shared a beer while our pizzas were created and enjoyed the simple vibe of our surroundings. Twenty minutes passed and it was on! One twelve inch four cheese and one twelve inch all meat. We couldn't drive to our hotel fast enough! The dough is soft , chewy, and held up well to the toppings. The sauce is fresh, savory, somewhat spicy with a garlicky punch that would knock you out! The pies were topped adequately with flavorful meats and cheeses. And best of all, it was delicious right out of the microwave the next day!

Most items were a-ok, but nothing special. The ox tongue slider, for example, was a disappointment - a missed opportunity on a luscious combination of textures and flavors:  the small slice of tongue reminded me of a thin, pounded out piece of round steak, the baguette bread was toasted hard, and the green tomato provided acid to balance out fat that was not there.\\n\\nI admit the rabbit pot pie (which reminded me more of rabbit & dumplings) was comforting, but still, nothing special, unless you consider rabbit the cool, new thing.\\n\\nHonestly, out of everything, I liked the fries on the side of someone's sandwich the best - perfectly seasoned with sea salt. And the fried and battered green beans too. The one thing I didn't get to try was the bavette (flap steak); my friend liked it so much that he didn't share, and thankfully people didn't know what it was (so it wasn't sold out like the chicken). \\n\\nFinally, my pre-dinner cocktail, a cucumber tequila drink, should have had the salt on the rim rather than in mass quantities within the drink. \\n\\nI'm a big proponent of and grow local food, so kudos to Contigo for showcasing the local bounty.

I LOVED the decor and big walls of wine and I'm sure much of my joy was just being someplace new. We opted to sit at a high-top by the bar and had a great perch for people-watching. I like that you're able to shop the wall for your bottle of wine (if you don't want a full bottle you can buy by the glass). The best thing was that I saw bottles as low as $10. Kind of a bummer the corking fee is $8, but oh well. I hear the corking fee is waived on Mondays and Tuesdays.\\n\\nBf & I each got a Winery Salad, which had great flavor. The proportions of ingredients were nice too - just enough gorgonzola to match the tartness of the dried cherries and counter the sweetness of the candied pecans. Really enjoyed this salad. The bread that came with it was hard as a rock though. Kinda tossed that aside.\\n\\nFor dinner we split the Fondue Trio and Veal Meatball. Both were amazing and I would definitely order again. The fondue consisted of 3 cheeses mixed with wines. The cheddar and port was AMAZING! It came with italian bread and pita, though I could have done with just bread.\\n\\nThe meatball was equally amazing. Tender and flavorful and covered with a delicious marinara and melted gooey cheese.

However, I had myself a Cafe Latte and I've got to say not only is it delicious, but definitely has more caffeine content than I regularly would taste otherwise in a chain establishment with high prices.\\n\\nNot to mention that the people are very friendly and it's a nice clean space with free samples almost every time I go :) Oh and if you buy a bag of coffee (doesn't matter how big it is), you end up getting a free beverage with it!

Let me start off by saying that I have been a regular customer to this place for two and a half years now. I used to frequent Dirty's twice a week for their OT Special burger, half-price appetizers during happy hour, and $6.75 premium pitchers ALL DAY, for the coldest beer I've ever had. But sadly, things have changed a lot at this place. The food is still wonderfully greasy, and they have the same awesome cooks that they've had since before I started coming here, but they experienced a change in management a few months ago which led to multiple unfortunate changes. First, almost the entire waitstaff, which had become my friends, inside and outside the restaurant, quit. That should be the first sign of bad changes. Second, they completely did away with their happy hour, which is ridiculous. I can see removing some items from the happy hour, or raising the prices a bit, but no happy hour at all? That's blasphemy. Now I have to pay something like $6.50 for an order of cheese sticks. Third, and worst of all, they cranked up the beer prices beyond belief. Those $6.75 pitchers from before, which gave you choices of beers like Widmer Brother's Hefe and Fireman's Four (great brews), are now priced at $13, and their pitchers of shitty beer are now $9.\\n\\nTwo years ago, I never thought I would be ragging on Dirty's like this, but now that they've taken away most of the reasons I love(d) this place, I find this review is necessary. If you're alright with overpaying for appetizers and beer, or you really want a amazing, greasy, bacon cheeseburger, come to Dirty Martin's. Otherwise, you're money would be better spent elsewhere in Austin until Dirty's management realizes that they're slowly killing an Austin staple that has survived since 1926."},{"name":"TILT","address":"1355 NW Everett St, Ste 120","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"Super fun and cool place to go in the Pearl District!!

The ambiance was pretty nice at the restaurant and even though it was raining outside and it was a packed house we were seated in less than 15mins. After being seated our server came over and took out order for drinks and appetizer.  We ordered the loaded cheese fries as an appetizer and for a small it was pretty big and fulfilling.  We then ordered our main course which consisted of Ribs with BBQ Chicken and Steak.  The server asked how I wanted my steak and I told him that I wanted the steak medium well.  After some time the server stated that they are running out of ribs and that it would be 30mins before our food came out because the ribs would take time to be cooked. We were ok with the time as we had the appetizer and drinks.  After some time our food came out and it looked pretty good.  I cut into my steak and it was pretty tough.  The steak was cooked well and the ribs had a lot of fat on it and it didn't even taste well cooked.  Needless to say we sent the steak back and I didn't even finish eating the ribs and my fianc√© changed out his ribs for steak. When they brought our steak out it was still cooked well.  At that point I didn't feel like sending it back again because if the steak and ribs wasn't cooked right I didn't want to try and give any other meat a shot. I ate the steak cause I was hungry but I truly was not satisfied with the food at all.  The manager on duty was nice enough to bring us our steaks the second time around but I was still not satisfied with the food.  I don't recommend them in my opinion.

We had an early reservation (4:30) that we were able to make the week before. We were in town for the Eagles Concert at TD Garden. The North End was very busy as the weather was beautiful. Almost all the restaurants on Hanover Street had their front glass walls open. There was a crowd already at Carmelina's, and two people in front of were turned away because they didn't have reservations. Place was packed. We got a bar height table right near the center of the restaurant. Service was quick, and mostly attentive. But it was very busy. We opted for two apps (Fried Calamari & Exploding Little Neck Clams). The Calamari was excellent. A bit meatier than most places I have had it. Nice and lightly fried with a sauce that had a bit of cherry pepper bits in it. It wasn't hot but juts enough spice to offset the calamari. Delicious. The Clams were also good. They could have come with bread to soak up the sauce after eating the clams but didn't. Make sure to ask for some if you order the clams.\\n\\nFor main courses I had the Lamb Shank over gnocchi. It was delicious but the portion was a little below my expectations. It was fall of the bone tender and had a nice rich flavor. The gnocchi was the best I have ever had. It literally melted in my mouth. My wife had a pasta and sausage dish. She enjoyed it as well.\\n\\n\\nAs I stated earlier, the restaurant was very busy and they were pushing dishes out a dizzying rate. My one complaint was that we received our appetizers fairly quickly, and right after we finished the main courses came without a break. In total, our dining experience here lasted maybe 45-50 minutes. I would rather have had a little time in between to let food settle and chat a little more.  One of the quickest meals I have had at a restaurant, well, ever. Unless you count take-out. \\n\\n\\nHowever, I heartily recommend this small but authentic Italian treasure.

You can definitely tell it was an old Quizno's because a lot of their signage is still up.  I ate there for lunch on a Friday and there was a steady trickle of Hispanic customers throughout the time we were there which I consider a good sign.\\n\\nI ordered 3 tacos (in order from left to right in the picture I uploaded): marinated pork (pastor), grilled beef (carne asada), and chicken (pollo).  Each of these tacos was excellent and I was very impressed with each of the meats.  They were all seasoned perfectly and tasted like they had come off of a charcoal grill even though they were cooked on a hibachi-esque flattop grill.  I was also impressed with the amount of meat in each taco.  The tacos come with the meat only and 2 corn tortillas.  The corn tortillas were some of the better ones I've had.  They were soft, warm, and not overpowering in flavor as I find some corn tortillas to be.  \\n\\nTheir salsa bar is small but effective as it has all of the essentials needed to dress the tacos.  I believe there were 3-4 different types of salsa varying in spiciness, as well as limes, cilantro, onion, and other veggies.\\n\\nThe tacos were $1 each and 3 were enough to make me feel stuffed.  You can also order a taco plate for $4.99 which includes 3 tacos, rice, and beans.  I couldn't imagine eating the rice and beans after the 3 tacos, but if you're hungry, you should score the taco plate.  They also serve other standard taqueria food like quesadillas, tortas, nachos, and burritos.

I must have had this dish at 25-30 different places by now, and although some have certainly been delicious, none of them have yet to stack up to Raja.   The chicken is always tender and not at all dry, very flavorful, their sauce is wonderfully balanced with just the right amount of acidity, and since I am a glutton for punishment, I always ask restaurants to crank up the heat as much as possible - most just dump more powder in, or cut up those little green chili's and give me a side dish etc.  But raja is the only place that will actually honor my request in a creative way and cut fresh scotch bonnets and add to the sauce - it takes a little more effort, but the result is spectacular!  This is an example of the approach taken here, a little extra creativity and effort make the difference.  \\n\\nAs for other dishes, the chicken tikka masala is wonderful for those not looking to burn their faces off like me, the garlic naan is some of the best around, and even the rice kheer is great to finish it off.  \\n\\nEvery place can have a bad day, so for all of those disgruntled reviewers, I suggest you give it another try and you might be surprised."},{"name":"McDonald's","address":"9814 International Dr","city":"Orlando","stars":"2","text":"If you plan to find a quick meal after 10pm this location is NOT the best location to visit.

First time, I met some friends for Happy Hour drinks on a weeknight. It was crowded, which I expected, but they had just opened. Service was fast and friendly. Next visit was a Tuesday night around 7:00pm., the young, cute hostess said it would be 20-25 minute wait. I got the impression that she either didn't want to be there or needs more training. I would suggest someone more friendly and confident as a first impression to this new establishment. Seats opened at the bar, so we grabbed them and ate there. My boyfriend ordered the arancini app and a panini sandwich called, Veg Head. I got an entire pizza, planning to take most home. Food was fast, delicious and pizza almost better cold the next day! Most recent visit was around 2:30 on a Sunday afternoon. We were pleasantly surprised that we didn't have to wait, however, that same, less than enthusiastic hostess was at the door. We followed her to the small room behind the bar where she started to seat us. I think because we told her that we may have up to three people joining our party of three. I asked if we 'had' to sit in there, as there was only one t.v. and it was dark and felt like you were in timeout, while there was this awesome football party happening right around the corner! She seemed frustrated and bothered as she led us to the main dining area, mumbling something about not sure what they'll do if our other friends came!? I just kept saying, we'll figure it out, as there were several vacant tables. The waitress was very friendly, but apologized (complained) more than once about the fact that she had 7 tables. We all ordered bloody marys and they were great! For lunch, my friends had chicken and waffles, muscles and fries, the paisan panini and I ordered the roast beef torta sandwich on the daily specials menu. I should have known that she didn't understand what I wanted (although I pointed to it) when she asked if I wanted anything on it. The description was roast beef, cheese, roasted red peppers, caramelized onions and horseradish aioli sauce on a torta roll! Sounds awesome, right? But, what else would you put on it? The wait for the food was longer than expected but not horrible. Some of it not hot. When my sandwhich came, I noticed there was no sauce and when I communicated this to the waitress she seemed confused but said, \\"Coming right up!\\" The more I looked at my plate as I waited, I was glad I saved the menus in case our friends came. I looked at the menu and realized that this wasn't what I had ordered, it was the regular roast beef sandwich  off the main menu. When the young, kitchen runner delivered my horseradish sauce, I communicated this to him and he asked, \\"Do you want the other one?\\" Uh....yeah. I have to say, from here it was handled perfectly and professionally! The waitress came over and apologized for the mistake, my correct sandwich came out quickly, delivered by the owner or manager and he even said that there would be no charge! Way to go! I certainly wasn't expecting that, which made it even nicer. All in all, I think they have a few kinks to work out, but they are new. The food is good, prices reasonable, location awesome!"},{"name":"la Barbecue","address":"2027 E Cesar Chavez St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"No, it's not as good as Franklins as some Austinites like to say, but that's not a bad thing by any measure.

They are for portions much smaller than most people create, so it'll be bland and perhaps unbalanced if you aren't careful.

Personally, I like creating my own with orange, light soy, rice vinegar in the noodles, honey mustard, and maybe some sweet and sour.

We had great memories of our last visit, but it can get very crowded and is a tad on the pricey side, especially for cocktails, so we don't come as frequently as I'd like. I love the ambience here: a little rustic, outdoorsy, but well-thought-out design. I also adore the combination of people it attracts, from families with kids to hipsters with dogs to older couples. Everyone we dealt with was very friendly. Service can be slow at times, due to the large volume of customers, but on the other hand, service is very thorough and detailed, and they try to personalize the experience, so I can understand the difficulty of the situation.\\n\\nWe were a bit disgruntled at being told there would be a 30-minute wait, and things got off to a rocky start when the line at the bar moved at a snail's pace. However, once my turn came, the experience couldn't have been nicer. The bartender asked how my day had been so far, and I mentioned that we were a little stressed, because everyone was hungry. She immediately suggested a couple of appetizers that she could get for me right away, and went straight off to the kitchen for a dish of olives, which were lovely,  and certainly tided us over.\\n\\nWe ordered the rabbit pate and the crispy green beans, as well. Sadly, I couldn't partake of the beans, as they were battered, and I have Celiac disease, so they were a no-no. However, the host came to tell us that our table was ready, so we were seated before the 30 minutes were up. Another very nice thing was that the manager came around and went through the entire menu with me, explaining which dishes they could modify for me, and marking everything very clearly. He also brought us some baby carrots and fresh rutabaga slices for the pate, to replace the bread. What a sweet guy! He really went the extra mile.\\n\\nThe Vinegaroon cocktail, with tequila and pineapple sage shrub, was outstanding. They also serve a non-alcoholic beer, which is always an important item and often overlooked by many bars.\\n\\nMy teen loves the pigs in a blanket, so he ordered them. I went for the daily sausage without a bun. Neither of us were crazy about the sauerkraut,  which was definitely lacking in flavor. They need a new recipe for that. But we were very satisfied with the appetizers and entrees. The overall quality of the ingredients was excellent, raising what could have been an ordinary meal to a higher level. P opted for a cheeseburger, which he assured us was very tasty. The atmosphere was great, if a little noisy, but we enjoyed people watching and conversing, and didn't feel crowded or pressured to hurry, even though they were obviously very busy.\\n\\nI love this place, as I said, but we spent over $100, including a generous tip, for the three of us--beverages were quite expensive.

I am not from this area, and I've been looking for a good breakfast spot and one of the locals ranted and raved about this place. Along with the Yelp reviews that seem to sing its praises. I decided to give it a shot yesterday (9/9/15). Firstly, I went there a few minutes after opening. Upon entering, I was a bit underwhelmed, the place was empty. However, there was flies buzzing around, it is very very dated, and I did question the cleanliness. But, I maintained my resolve and approached the counter. I was greeted, and I picked up menu. I asked for  recommendation and was immediately barked at \\"DEPENDS ON WHAT YOU'RE IN THE MOOD FOR, I WOULDN'T KNOW WHAT YOU WANT!\\" Taken back, I didn't bother pursue looking through the menu any further, I just told her scramble some eggs, pancakes, and bacon. Which turned out to be the \\"NE Breakfast\\". She rang me up, took my card swiped/typed it in. I stood there with my hand out to receive my card back and she placed it on the table. Strike 2! When people do this, I usually just don't tip as it is the most elementary form of disrespect, considering I handed you my card. There was no place to sit while I waited for my breakfast to be made so I occupied a table. Considering, that the place was completely empty I didn't think it was an issue. Finally, she brought it out and was on my way. \\n\\nNeedless to say, the food was rather enjoyable. It was hot and fresh. Therefore, I figured OK. I will go back tomorrow (9/10/15) and have breakfast again. Maybe she was just having a bad day. Therefore, this morning rather than aimlessly stand around in an empty dining area, I decided to call my order in. Again, I felt like I was being hustled off the phone. Before I could finish giving the first part of my order the lady was rushing me off the phone. I thought to myself, surely this cannot be the same individual as yesterday. I was given my total and I drove down to get it. Wouldn't you know it! IT'S THE SAME LADY. No worries, I am going to stay focused get my stuff and get out. She heads back to the counter and tallies up the bill. I hand her my card, hold my hand out to get it back, and again she places it down on the counter. BUT this time, it falls between the counter and the register. Super annoying! So now it has to be fished out, all because you couldn't just hand it back to me.\\n\\nNot only are you not getting a tip, but this time I am not coming back! HAND ME MY CARD BACK! I handed it to you. Therefore, you hand it back!! Don't treat people like garbage. Show some decorum, professionalism, and respect! Take some pride in what you do and who your serving, I am spending money at your establishment. Because your $8/hr ass could be doing the same thing at the golden arches! Not like there is much of a difference...\\n\\nRemember, customer service is paramount above all else. Doesn't matter if you have a quality product, if your customer service sucks then you're going to lose a lot of business and potential business. For example, I work for the local hospital where we are all underwhelmed by the breakfast service we get here and my department specifically (over 40 people) have been searching for a breakfast spot that's opened early and the food is hot and fresh. We order out practically everyday and when there is a bday or event we really do it up!! And that card you couldn't hand back is the one that gets processed for those orders. \\n\\nNewcomb could have been the official breakfast spot EVERY morning.

At the risk of being called a pizza snob from the East Coast, I am going to be honest. The ingredients on top of the pizza (e.g. tomato sauce, mushrooms, cheese, etc.) are fresh and very good. However, I do not like the taste of the dough at all. It is a theory that the water is the reason pizza and bagels are infinitely superior on the East Coast.

Two times I've ordered the Buffalo chicken wrap, which SPECIFICALLY says it comes with lettuce tomato cucumber on it. And each time I get only Buffalo chicken on a wrap.  Nothing else. Even the blue cheese is on the side (which I think is just lazy, but I digress). Finally the third time I ordered it and got just chicken on a wrap, I was thoroughly annoyed enough to bring it back. I told the cashier girl that the wrap was missing all the vegetables that the menu said the wrap comes with and she replied \\"oh you must have an old menu.\\" So my husband pointed to the menu above her head which said it came with lettuce tomatoes and cucumbers and said \\"oh well that must be old too...\\".  If you advertise it, you should provide it. Pizza is ok. Nothing to write home about. With so many new places popping up, Pats better step their game up.

Great place!!!"},{"name":"Al Forno Ferruzza","address":"2738 NE Alberta St","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"First off, I lived in Sicily for a few years so this is going to be a harsh review. In practice, this pizza is similar to Sicilian Pizza, but still falls well short. \\nBefore I start to bash the pizza let's talk about the decor. The restaraunt has a nice authentic pizzeria feel to it, which led me to be very excited about the pizza. The only problem with the decor and atmosphere of the place is the waitstaff. I expected the owner to be shuffling about shaking hands and chatting up customers, like any proper sicilian would. However the staff was the normal portland apathetic hipster chick who needed to be flagged down for a beer and to take our order at the front. I took my beer (decent selection of micro and bottle), plopped down in the corner and waited... and waited... all for a calzone.\\n\\nThe thing to know about sicilian pizza is that it's wood fire cooked. Wood fire cooked pizza cooks really fast. The combination of thin crust and minimalist approach to ingredients allows these ovens to cook pizza's like they are on a Ford assembly line. So this 20 minute plus wait in an empty restaraunt was pretty agitating. There have been several times when I ducked into a small pizzeria and they cooked my pizza before I had time to finish my espresso.\\n\\nSo my food finally arrived, a calzone and a simple margherita between me and my girlfriend. My calzone was thick crusted with soft chewy dough which as I describe it sounds great but it's not authentic. Any sort of crust is crip and thin, it's even acceptable to have some bubbles and tears in the skin with delicious cheese steam seeping out. This calzone had the texture of a ball of dough filled with cheese and pasty sauce. Ricotta, while used in many sicilian dishes, is not a common ingredient in a calzone. So it fell short of my expectations.\\n\\nMy girlfriend's pizza was a little better but still had plenty of room for improvement and was far from authentic. Again, not so thin and a soft crust. The freshness of the sauce was questionable and made in a northern italian style, more of a tomato puree instead of a normal light Sicilian mashed tomato style sauce. The cheese was pretty good but the pizza lacked oregano and olive oil, a staple for authentic sicilian margherita pizza.\\n\\nSo it's misses the mark. Apizza Scholl's actually makes a more authentic crust and simple designed pizza. Al Forno Ferruzza could make up for the pizza by having a more welcoming sicilian style restaraunt and expand to offer some very easy to make sicilian pasta dishes. There is room for improvement so for now I would skip the trip. \\n\\n-1 star for waiting on our food so long\\n-1 star for bland food\\n-1 for the false label of Authentic, just because the place is owned by a sicilian, doesn't mean the food is going to be proper Sicilian."},{"name":"Harp & Celt Irish Pub & Restaurant","address":"25 S Magnolia Ave","city":"Orlando","stars":"4.5","text":"We ate here last Friday night when we realized we had (again) missed the last sunrail before the two hour break.

It's since become a mecca of 9-5ers and probably not worth the wait of a 12:30 visit unless you're really craving tacos. It's not fancy tacos like Texas's Torchy's Tacos or Atlanta's Tin Lizzy's. It's simple Mexican tacos. \\n\\nI've had every kind of meat and many of the plates. I rate this place 1 star for decor/ambiance and 5 stars based upon what I order. Several tacos or, if i'm indulgent, nachos. The rice and beans are boringl, and the quesadilla can be pretty greasy although still tasty. The burritos aren't bad either, but I recommend sticking to a bunch of tacos (4-5) or the chos. Some of the food can be a 2-4 star experience.\\n\\nAll of the tacos meats are good, but what separates this place in my mind are the barbacoa and lengua tacos. The barbacoa is exceptional and would be what makes this place worth the wait/drive. If you get 1 thing get a barbacoa taco. I've had some of the top rated taqueria's in Texas and the barbacoa is on par. I mention lengua because it's so tender. Granted I haven't had a ton of cow tongue in my life so it may all be this way, but it's great. Not as distinguishing as the barbacoa, but worth the buy and especially worth the try. \\n\\nThe nachos are a fantastic way to feel good about a bad decision. Despite ordering the least healthy thing on earth, you at least do it in a way that is incredibly satiating and cheap. A lot of places screw up such a simple thing but not here."},{"name":"Wasabi Grill","address":"398 14th St","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3.5","text":"Sushi was well-made (good considering location) but was sparse on expensive ingredients (i.e. eel).

At $2.50 each, the sides they had included Asian Pear Slaw, Loaded Baked Potato, Potato Salad, Mac 'n Cheese, Jerk Collards, and Honey Baked Beans. \\n\\nThey accept credit cards, which is always a plus!  Cash payments are processed quicker, but I really appreciate when food trucks accept credit cards.  Who carries around cash all the time nowadays?\\n\\n* Beef Brisket Plate ($9.50) - For my two sides, I ordered the Mac 'n Cheese and Potato Salad.  I asked for little to-go sauce containers so that I could get some of each bottle of each BBQ sauce they had - Spicy and Sweet & Smoky.  I could hardly tell the difference between the two (weird), but I preferred the slight kick from the Spicy sauce.  The beef brisket was tender and tasty with the BBQ sauces.  The Potato Salad definitely contained some type of meat (I'm thinking it was bacon!), so it was unique and pretty good.  Unfortunately, the Mac 'n Cheese was EXTREMELY disappointing.  They make it with rigatoni pasta, which is cool, but the cheese was very thin/runny and overall, it was really bland.  \\n\\nOverall, Sweet Auburn BBQ gets 3.5 stars for their good BBQ, but I don't think the food was really worth the amount they were charging, and again, the Mac 'n Cheese was so \\"meh.\\"  The other thing I noticed was that they don't supply plastic knives, which I normally use to cut up my BBQ into bite-sized pieces.  My co-worker loves their Fried Ribs plate ($11.50 including two sides), so I'll consider trying that if I see their truck again in the future.

Pretty simple, with pig-related decorations (paintings, statues, etc.) scattered around and a bookshelf with several books on cooking techniques and other topics, which I really want to glance through if I come back and have the time to do so. There are 2 buildings, 1 containing the kitchen and front of the house, and the 2nd housing the bar. They are connected by a courtyard and patio with open-air seating, giving this place a really nice intimate and comfortable feel.  But anyways, onto the food...\\n\\nOh wait, quick note. Happy hour is like... 4:30 to 6:30 I think, and it consists of $2 off all appetizers, \\"things in a jar\\", drinks, and a brand new $4 drink and food menu. Okay anyways..\\n\\nWe ordered 4 appetizers to share, avocado crudo ($4 new menu), Duck Fat Fries ($5 w/ HH), chicken liver mousse ($6 w/ HH), Goat Cheese Fritters ($4 new menu), and I ordered a Pork Belly taco off the $4 menu.\\n\\n1.) Avocado Crudo: I was really interested in this as I imagined they'd treat the avocado in such a way that the texture and look would be similar to a fish (granted a green fish). However, what we got was 4 wedges of avocado w/ EVOO, salt, and cilantro. It was unremarkable, and honestly a complete waste of $4 and to be a bit brutally honest, menu space. Don't get me wrong, it tasted good, but there was no wow factor, and it felt like an overpriced half of an avocado.\\n\\n2.) Duck Fat Fries: If you're going to choose 1 appetizer or need a pick me up from a long day this would be it. I'm not sure you can choose any better frying medium than duck fat. The fries were super crispy but still had a nice soft center, the two 110 minute eggs were perfectly poached, and the combination was just awesome! There was a sauce on the side, which was a good compliment, but honestly it was excess because the fries and eggs would've been enough to make me happy.\\n\\n3.) Goat Cheese Fritters: 2 fritters w/ 2 halves of toast and a sweet sauce that I forgot what was in it besides tiny grapes. This was a pretty solid dish w/ the sweetness cutting the richness of the cheese and complimenting well.\\n\\n4.) Chicken Liver Mousse: Delicious. They give you a generous amount of the mousse, which has a layer of apple gelee on top. The pickled onions cut the richness and complimented the taste, and just putting it together on toast and eating it was a great experience. Furthermore, you can ask for extra toast (because we definitely needed it) and they'll give it to you for free. A very solid dish and one that I would get again.\\n\\n5.) Pork Belly Taco: Honestly, I was a bit underwhelmed by this taco. The taco consisted of a slice of pork belly, a runny egg yoke, and some greens. It was an okay taco, but I actually lost the flavor of the pork to the egg =/ and I didn't find the taco packed full of flavor. Plus $4/taco is a bit ridiculous. So I'm gonna vote down for this one =/\\n\\nAll in all I think Salty Sow is a solid restaurant. There are some things they experiment around with and I there were definitely some misses, but what they got right they got reeeeeally right. As of now, I feel like I would definitely come back to try out more items on the menu and explore what they have to offer here in its entirety."},{"name":"Keltic Krust Bakery","address":"1371 Washington St, Ste 5","city":"Newton","stars":"3.5","text":"Had high hopes, menu looks great and sandwiches sounded great.

The restaurant we had been hoping to get into finally got around to telling us that there was over an hour's wait for the next table given the reservations that they had.  I didn't want to wait that long.  So we headed down the street looking for a spot with available tables and a terrific Yelp rating.\\n\\nBella Vista had plenty of space (too much space?), but a relatively simplistic menu filled with your traditional chicken and veal entrees, and a 3.5 star rating.  Then we realized that Carmelina's was right across the street with 4 stars up their sleeve, so we hopped on over to give them a shot.\\n\\nWe scored a table right by the window where we could enjoy the beauty of the snow falling from our safe warm seats.  Oddly enough, we were initially provided with only one menu by the host.  But our waitress soon rectified that once she observed the three of us huddling over the single one provided.\\n\\nAfter eyeing the portions served to the table beside ours, we decided to share one appetizer and two entrees between the three of us.\\n\\nThe Caprese Risotto $14 listed as an appetizer was pretty creamy good and satisfactory for 3 to share.\\n\\nTwo pairs of eyes had been drawn by the Sunday Macaroni ~ Meatballs, Sausage, and Beef Rib in a savory tomato sauce, with a dollop of whipped ricotta. Served every day. $24.  Sadly, however, we were told that they were out of the beef rib.  They could make it sans the beef.  I inquired if the missing rib would be substituted with anything.  Nope?  How about additional meatballs?  Okay, they'd add one more meatball to the normal 3.

This is not the type of place I like to go, we totally didn't fit in with the crowd, I will probably never come back, but for what it is, we actually had a really great experience. \\n\\nWe came here during happy hour to really max out the benefit of the gift card. We were promptly seated and greeted by a very helpful, friendly waiter. Because of the decent happy hour prices we were able to order ourselves far too much food. I got myself the pizza margherita and the shrimp ceviche. Both were excellent. Pizza was sufficiently large and had the perfect amount of cheese and tomato with a decent crust. The ceviche was awesome, very fresh with some really good chips that seemed like they were made in house.\\n\\nMy girlfriend got the mushroom lettuce wrap, the poke stack, and the california roll. California roll was very strange, it came out as one giant roll about 4\\" wide, but it was apparently pretty good. Her reports on the wrap and the tuna were also quite positive.\\n\\nYard House clearly puts a lot of emphasis on quality plating, which I generally appreciate. This time, however, I believe they took it too far. As gorgeous as the poke stack looked, its presentation made its consumption more difficult than necessary. The ceviche ingredients were beautifully layered in a large glass, but trying to mix it together resulted in its contents spilling out all over the plate.\\n\\nThe tap list here is weird. Sure, there's an enormous selection, but unlike other places with similarly large selections it does not seem like they rotate much of the selection or offer much in the way of seasonal or specialty beers. Most of what is on this huge list is the really standard larger-micro offerings like Sierra Nevada Pale and Fat Tire. It's not such a bad thing, but it really took me some time to find something interesting that I hadn't tried before. \\n\\nMy water glass was never empty, a new beer arrived right as I finished off the old one, the bill came promptly, and whenever we needed anything our waiter came right over.\\n\\nThe happy hour prices were great, while the normal prices seemed to be on par with other restaurants in this part of town. \\n\\nSo, thanks Yard House.

For dessert, I ordered the Boston Cream Pie, decently moist and yummy but much more of a cake and not a pie.

I think the food server was so embarrassed that she was hesitant to even make eye contact with us.  Someone, who was finished with their meal had to get up from the table to inquire about the rest of us. The server  was left to fend for herself and apologize. No table check by a manager or recognition that they blew it. Yes, they were busy! It was a promotional night for a local school. A great idea for a restaurant on what is historically a slow night in the restaurant business. It cost them our business permanently. On what was over a $100 bill collectively, it would have been nice if someone acknowledged that our experience was not typical. Without that we were left with one of two conclusions? 1. It was typical and unless you have an inordinate amount of time to hang out for burgers with fries we suggest you keep driving down Main Street or 2. They did not care. These are the kind of experiences that for a business that is targeting young families (we had 2 under 5) or young professionals will soon have them catching the next train out of Tucker.

The grilled cheese was a bit unusual, almost more of a cheese sauce inside with no gooeyness, but very solid with great bacon and accompanied by a nice bowl of gazpacho. The fried green tomatoes were ok. I wouldn't recommend getting them unless you're really hankering for them. They're typical \\"New England style\\" FGTs - small and heavy on the F, light on the T.

If you have \\"scotch\\" in the name of your restaurant, I think that you should have quality glassware to serve it in and also quality ice to pour it over.\\n\\nWhere Hops N Scotch really shines is their beer.

Stone Ruination and Pretty Things Jack D'Or were also available. I settled on a Boulevard Tank 7, a fantastic pour at $6.\\n\\nAll in all, quite happy with my western excursion.

The roast pork was tasteless yet so pink that it looked like it was spray-painted that color. \\n\\nStill, there is something about this place that charms me. Maybe it was the Chinese lady behind the counter trying to talk to me in Chinese, even though I'm not Chinese, and then yelling at me in English.

Pretty safe for the faint of heart, no doubt.\\n  \\nSee, the funny thing is I thought you all were kidding when you said it was bland...sadly, it's not a joke.

You get your order on a metal tray (yes, like in prison), you then pick out your utensils/condiments and you get to the napkins. The napkins are shop rags, which is so unique and goes so well with the overall theme and vibe that tilt has.

The sauce was unique, and apparently Big Mo makes it himself every day. The time he puts in shows, because the sauce is very well balanced with initially sweet tones followed by smokey goodness and a lingering spiciness. The chicken was excellent, and was cooked on one of Moe's two large grills that permanently sit in the abandoned lot behind his truck. Our ribs were good - but not perfect - and we learned after we went that Mo was trying to cook the ribs on a new (and very large) portable grill, because he had to cater a party in New Jersey the following weekend and wanted to try it out. Thus, I felt the ribs weren't actually as tender as they could have been, but I think it was probably Moe's unfamiliarity with this temporary grill.

I went with Stephen who reviewed below so my experience was similar.  The highlights for me (besides the experience of eating BBQ out of a truck) were the sides, especially the rice and beans and the onion potatoes.  The collard greens are also worth trying, but taste very fatty and oily.  The chicken was also really good.  The ribs were good, but not as tender as I think they usually are since Big Moe was learning to use a different grill then usual.

I have tried my share of Halal food in New York but none of them compare to how good the lamb over rice at Small Pharoah is. The lamb comes in big chunks and is very tender and full of taste. The rice is also excellent. Although I was just hungry and wanted anything to eat, the food at Small Pharoah went way above my expectations and blew me away.

There was no greeter when we arrive finally about 5 minutes after arriving matre d showed up and seated us on the first floor near the window (I had requested a nice table for an anniversary dinner) it was SO LOUD my wife and I had to literally yell to hear each other. tables are inches apart and there must have been a lot of local Italians because it was unreasonably loud.and uncomfortably warm as well. We asked to be relocated to the terrace hoping it would be cooler and quieter and it was. Service was not exceptionally great..waited quite a while for water..and btw this is on a Monday night. The waiter was above average and made the experience worthwhile. He recommended a wine that was very good and I had the rabbit and my wife had the palenta. Both were very good and presented well. But this is not what I would call traditional Italian fare. It is over the top dining. So if you want to blow $50-$60 per person just to experience it, then do it. But if you want a quiet, romantic outing the Top of the Hub is a much better choice and costs about the same. The waiter did give us a complimentary desert since he forgot to bring ice and salt as I had requested. The desert (which I don't even know what it was called) was the best part of the dinner. It was blueberries on top of a creamy filling with a graham cracker crust. VERY GOOD. BTW this is the second Boston restaurant that has no salt or pepper on the table.

Seriously, OVER AN HOUR LATE with no real excuse. Apparently, I'm not the only one who's had this experience, and I found out that several colleagues have boycotted them for that reason. The food is good, and they're very polite, but DO NOT trust them when they say the food will be there at a particular time, even if they assure you repeatedly that it will be.

It is totally affordable, as opposed to most other options in the North End, and offers a nice enough ambience (we sat upstairs) and attentive service. We were a little disappointed that the bread wasn't warmer and homemade-ier and the green salad was a little generic (but the tomatoes were suprisingly delicious).

I don't know if it's the best Korean restaurant in the Orlando area, but as a person visiting from California and growing tired of eating the typical vacation foods, this place managed to satisfy my craving for some rice, grilled meat, and spicy soup with an overall average dining experience.  I think the place is fine if you're visiting from out of town, but it will have you missing your favorite place from back home.  \\n\\nI placed my order with about 20 minutes to closing - plenty of time for me to get to the restaurant.  I ordered the BBQ chicken and spicy soup, basic \\"can't go wrong\\" items from the menu.  The woman was very adamant about the fact that they were closing in 20 minutes...maybe they have a lot of flakes on the phone orders?  She reminded me 5 separate times.\\n\\nDue to some traffic, I arrived 5 minutes late - they called to make sure that I was still on my way.  They were in the middle of cleaning the tables when I walked in...slight look of annoyance, followed by the look of relief that the customer didn't flake on the order.  I usually tip on my pickup orders, and she seemed surprised and appreciative of the gesture. \\n\\nI got plenty of food for my money.  The side items (banchan) were average to slightly less than average.  The pickled vegetables didn't do anything for me, so I hardly ate any of it.  Perhaps it was because it was the last order of the night and they thought I was going to flake on the order, but the soup was subpar.  It was spicy and had tofu, but the soup was totally watered down and lacked flavor.  Compared to the other items, the chicken was actually tasty.  A large mound of rice, strips of chicken, and an occasional spoonful of forgettable spicy soup...not exactly heaven but a good stopgap.  \\n\\nI don't know if ordering so close to closing had anything to do with my experience, but Shin Jung left me a little unsatisfied in terms of taste despite it temporarily halting my Korean food craving.  Sometimes, average is better than terrible, so I can actually recommend this place if you're from out of town and looking for a Korean food fix because I've had worse.  This place is not too far from being better than average by simply improving their banchan and soups."},{"name":"Thai Grille","address":"15 E College Ave","city":"Westerville","stars":"4","text":"We were biking through town and decided to stop for lunch.

When we arrived there was loud music in patio and no one sitting inside the restaurant. A taller man who I found out later was the manager greeted us with \\"the inside is closed and we have no seating outside\\".. Wow, great customer service. As we looked outside there was an empty table and we asked why we couldn't sit there. He looks and said okay, they needed to ask the family in the adjoining table if they minded. Really? That was my first clue that we just walked into the arab mafia. Finally after seating ourselves we had to endure the very loud electronic arab music for 15 minutes before the waiter actually took our order. After another 30 min they brought the food which was less than expected, cold.. Colorless.. Lke they just got it out of the microwave. My Lebanese friend apologized for suggesting this place and said he thought the cooks might be Spanish but definitely not Lebanese as the food was nothing like he expected. When the manager came by we flagged him down to complain but he told us \\"we are busy, many families come here regularly and this is how they prefer the food\\". Bland and cold? He was completely unhelpful and could not care less for us as we were not the \\"arab customers\\" he wants to cater too. We paid our bill and all left vowing never to come back. The manager is arrogant and rude, the staff is less than helpful and the food is bland and cold. Save yourself money and go enjoy the wine bar next door as we did. The ambience of the wine bar and kindness of the owner saved the night!"},{"name":"Veggie Galaxy","address":"450 Massachusetts Ave","city":"Cambridge","stars":"4","text":"The dinners are often filled with yummy spices and a thoughtful mix of veggies with great presentation.
