I have never had meatballs in any kind of buffalo sauce and this tasted amazing! The sandwich comes with a salad. If you check in with your Yelp app, you qualify to receive a free cannoli.

NO PRESSURE! When we arrived, we instantly noticed how unique this place is. Cool vibes is an understatement. The floor plan is really open. The kitchen is exposed for all the guests to see what is going on, and even the ceilings are high and unfinished, adding to the feeling of big spaces. On top of it all, there are plants and herbs growing or decorating every table, nook, and cranny, so the entire restaurant smells like a fresh garden. The one negative atmosphere-wise was that the acoustics of the setup really amplify sound. I couldn't hear anyone two people down from me because the restaurant was filled with the clatter of the kitchen and the conversations of other tables.Once we got over the shock and awe, we all ordered and waited eagerly for our food. Coming in on an empty belly, the open kitchen was a little bit of a torture. I desperately hoped every dish I saw thrown on the grill or passed out to a waiter for serving was mine. Cool to watch, but not so great to have your stomach grumble through.When my turkey burger arrived, I was completely impressed. Really well done. All of the ingredients were fresh and flavorful, and I made a complete mess of myself trying to stuff it all in as quickly as possible. Seriously, ask for extra napkins because this burger is held precariously together with guac and other condiments that are bound to get all over you. Some of my coworkers opted for the grass-fed steak tacos, and although they were pleased with the flavor, they were disappointed by the portions and price point. $20 for two small tacos when you are used to $20 for ten small tacos at authentic Mexican joints? No thank you."},{"name":"Thai Wok Kitchen","address":"5000 E 4th Plain Blvd, Ste A101","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4.5","text":"For lunch today, I decided to check out Thai Wok Kitchen.

Got a Lamb Sandwich, the \\"World of Taste\\" (hummus, tabouli, grape leaves, falafel), Mixed (Beef, Chicken) Schwarma Platter with babaganoush, yellow rice. Our food was made to order, the dining room was comfortable enough, shiny granite tabletops, flatscreen TVs at every table (that we couldn't turn on).  Music from the club next door was thumping through the walls -- yes, at 3 pm in the afternoon, crazy.  Our platters came pretty fast.  We watched them form the falafels before us, they were creamy on the inside and darkly fried and crunchy, came with a savory tahini dressing.  Def ask for the housemade chili sauce, it's hot, but also spiced, like with cinnamon or mace.  Lamb for a Lebanese flatbread sandwich was seasoned with za'atar and other warm spices, wrapped with a schmear of hummus and bright pink beet-pickled raw turnip batons.  I put the hot sauce on the meat, also delicious.  The tabouli was fresh and tart and mostly parsley with a smattering of bulghur, was a fresh, cooling side.  The hummus was smooth and slightly bitter with the tahini, drizzled with a fruity olive oil.  The babaganoush was more tart than most we've had, but we liked it that way.  The meats for the beef and chicken schwarma were well seasoned, highly spiced, but possibly out on the heated rotisserie lamp too long (and we were inbetween the meal rushes).  Watch out for the Lebanese garlic sauce, especially if you're on a date, it's delicious, but potent.

Please, Mr/ms owner hopefully reading this, this is my first and only yelp review because I'm tired of this happening (ie Pita on piedmont has great food but messes up your order hence they're empty every night). I am begging you to take my complaints to heart as I want you to succeed. Here are a few things I noticed: \\n-Employees chatting very loudly while food takes forever. I get you make it fresh, but when you pay for a $12 burger and fries you at least expect the experience to be enjoyable while you wait. Also it didn't make me feel good that before the server picked up my food from the kitchen he reached down and pulled up his pants right before touching my food. Maybe a dress code is in order (ie Chick-fil-A again)       \\n- the cashier Rushed through the menu and we had no idea how to order. It's a cool concept (individualizing your burger) but needs to be explained in an intriguing way \\n-Burger took so long Fries were cold. That's a kitchen timing issue. \\n- the lettuce wrap looked like the cook had never done a lettuce wrap before (see picture)Please again-  I know the rent on this place must be ridiculous and I don't want to see you fail (sorry Pita).

My wife and I just spent 9 months travelling in Mexico and Latin America and I always found myself comparing the food to this place.  Even when I lived in another state, I would make sure that I got to get back here at least once during my return home.  One of the owners is from the Jalisco region of Mexico and I believe his cooking is therefore more heavily influenced by seafood.  The caldo de camaron (shrimp soup), shrimp a la diabla, and siete mares (7 seas soup) are all so full of flavor they will make your head pop.   The other owner is from Argentina originally and brings a unique twist to the food.  The gaucho burrito is the fusion of Mexico and Argentina from the two owners with an Argentine chimichurri smothering the steak burrito.  Okay so I got through the food, now we can get to the best part of the restaurant:  The margaritas.   The house margaritas are pretty much your standard margs and are not really anything special.  The other, (more expensive) margaritas are really amazing.  The fruit infused tequila signature margarita is a little sweet, but I always end up ordering one and I am happy I did.  My only complaint is that I think the margs are a little pricey, but then again they do come in pint glasses so at least you are getting your money's worth.  I dare you to have 3 and drive anywhere.  Overall this place is probably my favorite restaurant.  The prices are reasonable, the food great, and the people very friendly.  One thing I would add as an addendum to the posts below is that if you order run of the mill Americanized Mexican food you are going to get run of the mill taste.  I am sure they have this stuff because that is what most Americans want and it is the only way to make a business survive, but it is the other stuff that you have never heard of that makes Casa Alvarez a gem.  Step out of what you know and order something you have never had before.  Prickly Pear Pork, Inferno Chile, Mojarra Frita (whole fried fish very popular in Mexico)  are a few suggestions."},{"name":"Din Ho Chinese BBQ","address":"8557 Research Blvd, Ste 116","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"I typically don't write reviews but I had to write this one.

We've both had thai food before, but weren't big fans of this type of cuisine. We decided to give this restaurant a try because it was a different cuisine than what we usually have and  the reviews were good.The ambiance was good. It was romantic and a tad dark, but since we were seated under the skylight, we had the evening sky lighting up our table. The service was above average as the waitresses were knowledgeable and easy on the eye. My water was refilled almost immediately when I downed it after eating a dish that was one level (if not ten lol) too hot for me. The appetizer was Isaan Lettuce Wrap (Yom Nam Khao Tod). This was the spicy dish. We were recommended level 2 out of 5 spiciness, but it was still too much for me. Though, I still finished the appy, I was just crying, eating and downing water all at the same time. A stir fry of veggies, ham, ginger, peanut was piled on one side of the dish and we put them in lettuce wraps. It was one of the best things I've had - maybe even better than some peiking duck lettuce wraps in Richmond!We then had the Beef Panang. Most. Awesome. Dish. Ever. It came with a small bowl of either jasmine or coconut rice. The beef was tender, the peas were soft, the bell peppers were cooked well. The sauce.....the sauce was to die for. If I were alone, I would have probably licked the plate clean so that I wouldn't waste the curry sauce. It wasn't spicy, but sweet. I could taste the coconut milk and it just went very well with the rice. We would definitely order this dish again. Hands down.Final dish was the Pad Thai. It was better than the other Pad Thais I have had before in the sense that the noodles were fresher. I don't think I would be ordering this dish again though because it didn't stand out to us like the other two dishes. Don't get me wrong, the dish was good, it just wasn't 'lick the plate clean' good. All in all, my boyfriend and I both LOVED this place.

It took us sometime since the restaurant was filled with customers. I bet it's even busy on sundays with lots of church goers.I got Gamjatang ($11.99) which was big and it came with stone bowl rice. And my sis got Doganitang (beef tendon soup, $13.99) with bowl of rice as well. Tendon soup came with dipping sauce which is a mix of mustard and soysauce, it was tasty. And Gamjatang was good as well. Definite plus for me is Gamjatang is one serving, whereas most places are 2-3 servings minimum YES! Meat fell off the bones and it had good amount of veggies and perilla seed just the same as original one. Lastly, be sure to scrape all the rice out of the bowl and put water (there's pitcher by the wall) it's delicious this way. Side dishes were simple and some might disappoint in lack of sides.

However, if you don't rave about these flavors, I would have a friend get it and try before committing--my mom had wished she had gotten the Honey Nut instead.We've also gotten their drip coffee and cortado, and both are very good!

The waiter was great although he forgot my shrimps and we definitely ordered them but he said he didn't hear it. Cocktails were well made. Unfortunately they operate separately from the hotel so you can't put it on your room. The one total miss on this place was the piss poor attitude of a hostess with a scowl on her face. It was a Saturday night and the restaurant was max 25% occupied mostly in the bar area an hour and a half to closing and she was very NOT accommodating for our large group.

I love pork belly and prawns so the kung op wun sen was a deliciously savory dish. The muu khan wan was something quite unique to me. It's a heavily spiced pork dish served with chilies. You wrap the pork in mustard greens and then are encouraged to eat some crushed ice after each bite, since the flavor is quite intense.I thought the wings were pretty decent.

I was starving so I ordered a combo platter which came with 2 eggs, 2 sausage links, 2 strips of bacon, potatoes, and a biscuit.  I got a multigrain pancake, which was a shockingly low $1 extra and added cheese and an extra egg.  The food came out as ordered.  The pancake had cinnamon, which added to the flavor and was really good.  The potatoes were cooked perfectly, having just the right amount of crisp.  The bacon was great--not overly crispy.  The sausage links were large and also tasted good.  The eggs with cheese were perfect--not runny or too dry.  The service was friendly and it's the kind of place where they rib one another while serving customers, which adds to its no-frills charm.

The owner came out a few times to make sure everything was ok. My wife and I found the food to be excellent. So good that we ordered a baker's dozen of their classic meatball and had them over the weekend (they reheat just fine).

I love the randomness of it.We ordered calamari as an appetizer, and the first thing I noticed about it is the weird way they are cut. Instead of the squid being cut into rings, it's cut into strips. It changed the texture significantly in that it kind of tasted like high class chicken strips? If that's your thing, that's cool.Then I ordered the mac and cheese. It is INTENSE. DO A JUICE CLEANSE BEFORE EATING THIS. It is creamy and gooey and cheesey and so delicious. But seriously, you will want to food coma for days after eating this.

The place was pretty much empty, so we got a table right away. Service was prompt and friendly. We started with tea and coffee, and both were pretty good. Coffee is served in funny, unique mugs and comes with free refills. We started with the coffee cake, which leans closer to a dessert than a breakfast item since it's topped with whipped cream. It was pretty delicious, but definitely sweeter than we were expecting. For my entree, I had The Florentine, a three-egg scramble with spicy greens, ricotta, parmesan and bread crumbs, served with what the call \\"Library Fries\\" (a pretty good cubed potato hash) and toast of your choice (I chose sourdough). When I asked for ketchup they brought a really interesting homemade-looking tomato mixture that resembled salsa, but turned out to taste like ketchup. The jam they brought for the toast was excellent. Overall we enjoyed our food. It wasn't the best breakfast I've ever had, but it was solid.

Overall, a bit overpriced and underwhelming. The Kung Op Wun Sen was really good though! If you like spicy-sweet foods, the sauces and flavors in a lot of the dishes will hit the spot.Between four people, we ordered the Papaya Pok Pok, Ike's Vietnamese Fish Sauce Wings (regular), Kung Op Wun Sen, Muu Paa Kham Waan, Jasmine Rice, Coconut Rice, and Sticky Rice for take-out. We didn't want to eat too much since we were going out Friday night, but I thought it was a good amount of food, as we still had some leftover. Overall impression, they had some good dishes but the wings were okay.Papaya Pok Pok ($9.75) -- 4/5. I liked this a lot. It was spicy, so be warned for those who are not into that. I liked this a lot as it was really refreshing and nice to munch on the side.Ike's Vietnamese Fish Sauce Wings ($15.75) -- 2.5/5. This was the reason why we went here. Everyone talked about how great this dish was, so it was really hyped up for us. Eating it though, it was kind of hard for me to understand why it was so talked about. I've had fish sauce wings before -- most of which were sweet and spicy, a great combination. I was expecting that here, but the fish sauce was a bit too salty and has a pungent odor. It wasn't too bad, but I've had better for a better price. I wouldn't come to Portland just for this dish though.Kung Op Wun Sen ($16.75) -- 5/5. The glass noodles has a nice sweetness to it. One of my friends thought it was too bland though, but with the sauce provided with the dish, it was really good. The marinade around the pork belly was so good, and I was sucking on the shells of the shrimp to get all the sweet flavors out. It was really good, my favorite dish here. It was a bit pricy for the portion size, but it was good! I'd come here to get this dish again.Muu Paa Kham Waan ($15.75) -- 4/5. Tiny pieces of boar collar served with chilled leaves of some plant. The portion size was small, so I'm not sure if I'd get this regularly here, but it was definitely delicious. The spicy chili garlic sauce that was used for dipping the collar-wrap really hit the spot for me. Great snack!Coconut Rice ($3.75) -- 4/5. It tasted almost like the sweet Vietnamese glutinous rice, xoi. It was kinda dessert-like for me in that sense. Very coconut-y and light.The jasmine rice ($2.75) was normal, as was their sticky rice ($3.25), which was bland and nothing special to note."},{"name":"Island Creek Oyster Bar","address":"500 Commonwealth Ave","city":"Boston","stars":"4.5","text":"Best Oyster bar I've been cosy not crowded, the food is awesome and the staff are friendly"},{"name":"Buster's Bistro","address":"412 S Sanford Ave","city":"Sanford","stars":"4.5","text":"Excellent beer bar and bistro, with lots of great Belgian Beer, food and atmosphere.

There is someone standing there that is so nice, who sets up but he cannot make you a drink.

We have tried many dishes on the menu and have always considered it one of our regular dining favorites.  We also grew up eating Cantonese style food in NYC so Din Ho is authentic for the American palate and the style in which it is served. If you are expecting friendly waiters and table cloths, you obviously don't have a clue on how this type of Chinese food is served for the value and quality.  It is a family run business and you get to see their dysfunction on display while you eat which is part of the experience. We have gotten to know the adult children of the owner who work during busy times and find them to be very pleasant and welcoming once you get to know them.  I have never written a review, b/c it is was already so popular with 200+ reviews and  a 4 star on YELP when we first visited.  However, I can see they have lost a 1/2 star in the past two years. I am concerned, b/c our dining experience has also diminished over the same period, and we do not visit as frequently.  The prices have risen by at least $1-$2 on almost every item on the menu. I would not generally be upset by such an increase over 5 years, b/c we all know Austin's cost of living has risen and Din Ho's food preparation is very good. Our issue is that the food (or ingredient) quality has also gone down with the price increases.  I hope the family reads the Yelp reviews and listens to its patrons. I would like to give it back its 4 star rating.   Last night, we ordered the Orange Beef which has become a different dish than when we first had it there. It is not unlike many of the other beef dishes that we have recently ordered--essentially much less beef ,more cheap vegetables, and beef tastes of lesser quality. The Orange Beef is now $15+ and was overcooked with more fried batter than beef.  it was completely opposite of what we had two years ago.  The duck fried rice is still excellent and kept us from being totally dissatisfied. The menus look new (probably thanks to price increases) but nothing else in the place has been refurbished in 5 years and the restrooms, as some other Yelp reviewer noted, are a mess. I can live with  that and rude service, as long the meal quality stays superior with commensurate/modest price increases over time.  Of course, at a certain price threshold, which Din Ho is fast approaching, it will put itself in competition for better food, ambience and service quality and then steady patrons will reconsider going to Din Ho.  Not a good result for a restaurant that knows how to make great Cantonese style food."},{"name":"Kolache Factory","address":"3706 N Lamar Blvd","city":"Austin","stars":"3","text":"HORRIBLE SERVICE.

I found Mehman based on Yelp reviews and off we went for an early Saturday lunch.  We arrived just as the restaurant was opening at 11:30am and so we started off as the only patrons.  By the time we departed an hour later, it was still pretty quiet save for a couple of Persian ladies picking up some take-out and another two-top (Non-persians) during the interim.  I'm sure the restaurant was packed later in the day, as generally Persians eat lunch late and the weather opened up into a beautiful day!  The actual restaurant was pretty small, just two rows of tables running along each wall of the narrow restaurant to the back kitchen.We ordered the barg kebab ($13.99, hub's favorite kebab, usually made with filet mignon) and he subbed zereshk (barbari) pulao ($0.99 extra) for the regular saffron tinged rice.  I knew a regular size meal would be too much for me and so made a 1/2 portion meal from the a la carte section ($5- 1 koobideh kebab, $1- 1/2 portion rice, $2- 1/2 Shirazi salad).  And then we shared.  Hub's barg was a little disappointing (dry and not too much flavor) but my koobideh was a moist, flavorful delight! Quite possible the best koobideh I have ever had...  anywhere!  Even better than homemade which you will generally NEVER find me saying!!  At first we thought they might have done it the traditional way-- a mix of ground beef and lamb but our server told us... nope, it was just beef!

The butter is wonderful, but without being too sinful I spread it on their homemade bread.  I'm addicted to both, unfortunately.   Menu items are served with your choice of soup or house salad.   I enjoy their house tossed salad.   Add gorgonzola cheese for extra zing.  I have tried a number of items from their menu in the past.   Most portion sizes are quite generous.  It is pretty common to take the extra home for a second meal.  My recent visit I had their Cannelloni.  Its baked egg noodles filled with ground veal and covered with their tomato sauce and mozzarella cheese.   The tomato sauce has a bit of kick to it.  Although tempted to have dessert, I was simply way too full.   Service has generally been pretty responsive and personable. They do offer an outdoor patio for warmer days.  It does lay right up against a very busy parking lot, but is comfortable on a nice evening."},{"name":"Morton's The Steakhouse","address":"213 SW Clay St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"It was my birthday and my husband took me to Morton's along with a performance at The Keller across the street.  We made a reservation for 5:30 pm and arrived at 5:20 pm allowing plenty of time.  We ordered champagne and when the waiter brought it we ordered our dinners.  Almost an hour later and after inquiring about where our food was it finally came.  Other people had come in, ordered and were finished by the time we got our food.  The waiter was full of excuses.  We ordered our steak medium, but it came well done.  We had no time to send anything back or we would have missed the beginning of the performance.  The potatoes lyonnaise were dry and lackluster.  The waiter did have his manager give us credit for part of the meal, but we were looking forward to a nice birthday dinner.  I would not recommend this steakhouse.

I came here with 8 other people for food and drinks, and when we put in our name for a table we requested a certain table that had been unoccupied. The host told us that was fine so we waited around for them to clean off the table. (We are all in the industry, including my boss who is a seasoned restaurant/bar owner.) a waitress then approached us and was immediately rude. She asked us \\"who told you that you could sit here\\" \\"are you planning on getting food?\\" \\"They aren't supposed to let you sit here\\" \\"are you going to the game?\\" and then proceeded to turn around and scold the host's for allowing us to wait by the table while we finished our drinks and were ready to be sat. I then went to the host station to tell them the situation and that we wanted a new server. They proceeded to tell us that we needed to move to the back of the restaurant to get a new server and that they don't allow table switching with server staff. Overall a terrible experience, we ended up just leaving and coming across the street for food. I have been here before but have never sat for dinner and being a waitress and a bartender I was extremely disappointed with the customer service. There is no excuse to not give good service regardless and we were not unreasonable customers. We were literally sitting and waiting for our server after being told that the table was ours. And I wouldn't be writing this complaint if it wasn't necessary but that waitress had my entire party pissed off because of her attitude.

I was craving the flavors of my trip to Morocco last fall and stumbled upon this place. Its food is complex, delicious, and stays true to its North African roots rather than joining the regionless \\"Middle Eastern\\" trend. This is now my new favorite spot in Central!- Mint lemonade - this is such a unique floral, herby mix of flavors that feels nostalgic yet is never found in American food. Try it!- Chicken tagine - While this is not on the main menu, I gather it may be a fairly frequent special. The tagine style of cooking makes the chicken extremely tender and flavorful, with a perfect mix of sweetness, savoryness, and sourness that makes it perfect as an autumn dish. I wish the couscous were less dry and not so finely grounded, but that is probably based on individual preference.I look forward to going back and trying more of this place!

In my haste, I overlooked the military discount price, and they were happy to reimburse us for the difference. I haven't been to a theater where the movie doesn't start on time, so that was a first. As far as I could tell, the delays are due to taking orders, delivering the first round of orders, and then cleaning up and closing checks at the end.We only ordered drinks as we weren't at all curious about the food menu. From what I could see around me, that was a good idea. I heard a gentleman complain that his nachos were cold and there was no offer to make it right or find a solution. We did put a card down to open a tab, but unfortunately, our server delivered the check to an empty seat...?

The small bottle of pancake mix was 8 dollars and the side of chocolate chips was 2 dollars. I felt this was an unfair price with the amount of food we made. The small bottle of pancake mix made about 6 small pancakes which resulted in us still being hungry. The waiter came back with the check but didn't ask us if we wanted to order anything else.

Some of the recent reviews are just atrocious.   Even by you so-called Elite Yelpers.  Hello, the place is literally across Piedmont are from the Park.  Yes, that means some times the patio is too packed and the bar is running 4 deep.  As a former industry guy, I love the pontificators who criticize and expect 5 star service at an establishment that can have 150 people walk in the door in 15 mins at a Saturday brunch.    Yeah, you're going to have wait an hour for a table.  Yeah, the bartender may pass you by cause he literally has 16 people yelling at him.  Yeah, that manager might be busy.   This place is awesome.   MJ has never purposely ignored a customer.   Craig never said what one reviewer said.   You two reviewers...

We had delicious meal here, which I'm sure cost a pretty penny.The staff was very pleasant and let us move our table to a better area (at first we were right next to the kitchen door). From what I understand, they will not seat you until the entire party has arrived for the reservation. We started with bone marrow grilled cheese; lobster fritters; grilled thick cut bacon; and I think we also had a big plate of Onion rings (not sure who ordered that).\\nAt first everyone was wary of the bone marrow grilled cheese, but I am a fan of trying new foods. Half the table actually took a bite because they thought they were eating the lobster dish... muahahaha. Really, you pair anything with cheese and it will always amaze.For mains, we all ordered steak. I had the six ounce fillet Mignon and it was perfectly cooked to order, medium and at a perfect temperature all the way through. I would say that 98% of the sides available are not very healthy and even the steamed broccoli is served with melty cheese, so I asked for it on the side. I made sure to try the grits (you can't visit the South without eating grits!) and they were so good and, of course, cheesy.Dessert was a plethora of tasty treats: We tried the peanut butter baked Alaska (pictured), the bon bons (ooh!), the bread pudding and.... I know there was something else but can't think of it now. As you can see, I was in a serious food coma waddling out of this place. Very friendly server (Amanda, I believe). We were not rushed through our meal but still felt attended to, and we really enjoyed ourselves. :)**Just thought of a tip, in case you were wondering what to wear to this place. It's dark and swanky inside, could be considered romantic but also a good corporate pick. You could probably get away with jeans but definitely leave the sneakers at home. Your best best would be at least corporate casual but it never hurts to pay a little extra attention and take it one step above.***"},{"name":"Moonshine Patio Bar & Grill","address":"303 Red River St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"The Moonshine Patio Grill was ok.

Holy wow, so excited about this joint. Went for the first time last night and am very enthused. I don't know what else to say! Actually that's not true, there's a lot to say. Ordering is straightforward as the menu takes you through step by step. We went halfsies and ordered mussels (step 1, pick your seafood) with the Louisiana (step 2, pick your sauce) and made this the hot option (step 3, pick your spice - mild, medium, hot and extra hot) and added garlic noodles to the bag (step 4, add a side, optional). Hot is VERY HOT. We can handle spice, but their definition of hot borders on extra hot so be careful! We still loved the heat, it kicks you in the face immediately and you'll like it if you're fiends like us. My biffle's sister told her that mild has a bit of heat, too, which we plan on testing out on our next visit (just to taste the sauces at baseline).\\n \\nThe mussels with garlic noodles - very very flavorful and satisfying on all fronts. Fresh noodles, delicious mussels. Very spicy and as others have said, very garlicky (not a bad thing for me personally). Spice profiles A+ all around - YES, they know what they're doing!We also ordered lobster with lemon and pepper and made this hot as well with corn in the bag. They gave us 3 small cobs of corn. Delicious, sweet corn steeped in sauce? Heck yea! The lemon and pepper option is very buttery and if you order hot, it's almost indistinguishable from the Louisiana. Just a heads up because there's also a butter and garlic sauce option along with the Louisiana and lemon pepper.  We were very satisfied with this one as well. Other sides: Cajun fries and Cole slaw. The slaw was crunchy and sweet, maybe needed some salt? Not a must but not a bad option to offset the spice! Cajun fries were well seasoned through and through - you will get shoestring fries (love) instead of thick fat ones you associate with joints like these.  They supply gloves and bibs, and utensils of course - you'll want all these.  I'd suggest not wearing white! The space is Pinterest come alive. Fun d√©cor and well lit interior with snazzy jazzy music in the background. We got there around 6:45-7ish and didn't have a problem with music from Brighton Music Hall. Although, maybe 40 minutes into dinner, they must have had a sound check because we DID hear music through the walls on the right side of the restaurant for 2 minutes (weird - music hall is adjacent on the left?).  You likely won't have an issue if 1) you're sitting on the left side of the restaurant and 2) if you come at the right time (I would personally put up with the music for this kickass food).  P.S. This place is not like adjacent fast food joints - a host/hostess will seat you.Our server, Lynn (new in town!), was super sweet and patient with our many questions.  Our waters were always full and any need for plasticware/requests were met.  Fun to chat with as well!P.S.

I had a mixed plate of chicken and falafel and the portion size was quite large. The prices are somewhat higher than competitors in the area, but the size and quality makes up for this additional cost. The dill rice is fantastic and helps to bring out the flavours of everything on the plate, especially with their secret sauce on top. The chicken was average in terms taste and quality, but the falafel is where Xpress shines. The fry on each falafel is perfectly crispy while the inside is fluffy and exploding with flavour. Unlike the falafel of their competitors which are either too dense or over seasoned, these falafel find the perfect balance of texture and taste. I will 100% be back to order a falafel plate again. Not only are the employees very kind and friendly, they even served a complementary meal of meat and rice to the dog of a family who was eating on their patio. The service is on the slower side but is something I expect with the high quality of their food. I welcome Xpress Donair House as a successor to the previous tenant.

I wanted to try this place out because their menu boasted a couple of vegetarian options that I thought would be easily made vegan. For all you vegans out there, your only option besides appetizers are the veggie enchiladas sans cheese, but you're in luck because this was actually really good! A lot of yummy veggies inside a blue corn tortilla and covered in ranchero sauce with a side of beans and rice. They reminded me a lot of the Amy's Kitchen vegan enchiladas. They do have another vegetarian option on the menu, the vegetarian combo plate. I asked if they could substitute the cheese inside the chile relleno with guacamole but our server told me no, it comes pre-made and can't be altered, so that was a bummer. Nevertheless, I was very happy with my enchiladas and between the large portion and the unlimited chips and salsa, I was stuffed!

I had the beet burger and I swear it was one of the best vegan meals I've ever had. Soooo good. The texture of the burger is malleable, like not a stiff piece of meat, and the rest of the toppings complement it so well. It's topped with cashew cheeze, pickles, lettuce, tomato, and I think banana peppers. It also comes with vegan mayo but I opped for the \\"oil-free\\" option, which does not include the mayo (the burger bun contains minute amounts of oil inevitably). I'm blown away they could make such a decadent, seemingly-indulgent dish without a synthesized fat. I appreciate the fact that there are so many whole-food options at Counter Culture, because in the long run, they are highly beneficial to commit to. It's a commitment to nature no doubt.My sister and I had an awesome, genuinely kind, and knowledgeable server! She answered my questions patiently and respectfully. The vibe of the decor at Counter Culture blends a mid-century design style with the southwestern flair of Austin wonderfully. I think the owner likes blue.

We made a reservation, but we were easily able to be seated in the dining room upstairs.To start off, they have a basket of bread and breadsticks which had some interesting options that you don't normally find and were decent.For an appetizer, we decided to go with the octopus. The octopus was cooked well, but I felt it was a bit gamey and had a little bit of grit on it that made it a little less desirable. My friend and I both really enjoyed the sauce it was paired with--though we wish there was a bit more of it.For the main course, we decided to split an order of the monkfish and duck breast. I love monkfish and this dish did not disappoint. It was served atop a slice of eggplant and a cooked tomato concoction that was really tasty. The fish was also cooked nicely and had a great flavor to pair with the veggies.The duck breast was a classic preparation and was served with hints of cherry jam and sweet potato puree that really heightened the flavors of the dish. I wouldn't say that we were totally blown away, but it was definitely a solid rendition.For my drink, I ordered the Sirocco--damn was this a great drink--maybe even the best drink I've had in Boston thus far. I can't even remember all the ingredients in it, but it was packed full of flavor.Overall, this place had some great qualities and some good qualities.

A friend of mine told me about this restaurant, so we decided to come here on a Saturday evening. From the moment you walk in, you immediately feel as if you are in Spain. From the cozy tables, to the dim lights, a perfect date night setting. When we arrived, there were 4 bar seats just waiting for us (which never happens). The bartender or should I call him Mixologist, because boy was he mixing away some pretty neat and crafty cocktails, was extremely cordial and inviting. My friend and I started out with the The Bad Boy, (of course it has Mexcal in it), do you dare to ask..lol! Mexcal is my favorite since it's mentioned in many of my other reviews!! Plus some other cool ingredients like a scotch bonnet pepper syrup, sounds daring! The cocktail was pure heaven!! Their menu is quaint, but appealing. We weren't all that hungry, but after sipping on a few cocktails, and perusing their menu offerings, we had to order a few tapas to try. Because besides making my mouth happy, I had to follow with making my stomach feel the same way. We ordered the Patatas Fritas (picture below), basically think \\"super-size fries.\\" I prefer a smaller fry that I can dip and pop, but they were still tasty. Then we had to order their brussel sprouts, because they were fried. Those were very good as well. I highly recommend checking out this restaurant. Plus, Somerville has so many cool spots to hang out and check out. Whether you prefer wine (Rebel Rebel Wine Bar) or beer (so many breweries), you won't be disappointed.

I have been a loyal customer to Wingstop for years and have ALWAYS gone to this location. Last night will be the LAST time I will EVER spend my money at this place. I was also not the only person having issues here last night. Not only was I yelled at by the cashier (who clearly probably never held a job ever in his life) I was also yelled at by the so called \\"manager\\" (old man in his 50's with a sparse grey pony tail). Mind you I did not raise my voice at all my whole encounter here. I placed an online order for pick up. I showed up 15 minutes (9:02) after I placed the order because it says on the app that the order should be ready at about 9:12 PM (5/12). I ordered a medium combo w/ 8 wings. When we got there I sat in my car as my partner went in to pick it up. I waited 20 minutes in my car wondering why my partner hasn't gotten the order yet. So I got out and went in to ask why it's taking so long. My partner had already confronted prior to the manager and the manager had the audacity to yell across the store from the back of the kitchen. When I went in, the cashier kid tried to accuse us of never paying for our order. first of all, YOU CANT EVEN PLACE AN ORDER WITHOUT PAYING. I even had shown them a receipt which the manager DEMANDED from me. Then they had the audacity to say \\"we had a lot of orders before you and we are only 2 minutes behind in orders.\\" In total we had already waited 50 minutes since the order was placed online. THIS WAS JUST FOR 8 WINGS. EVERYONE WHO WENT IN AND ORDERED AT THE COUNTER HAD RECEIVED THEIR FOOD BEFORE US AND WE WERE STILL WAITING. Before leaving the store with a portion of our order, the cashier child said \\"at least your food is hot\\" when we said, \\"50 minutes for 8 wings, ridiculous.\\" My partner and I left the store and tossed the food away because at this point we were humiliated, disrespected and basically paid to get YELLED at. FAST FORWARD, this cashier child left the store in his uniform, on the clock, STOOD IN FRONT OF MY CAR and threatened to fist fight. Not only that, he spat on my car. I went back and looked at my dash cam to see how long each customer had waited in the store. All of them had received their order within 15 minutes or so. I have attached a photo of the cashier. It seems like someone else also had an issue with this rude employee. I suggest you guys fire him or you will continue to lose business. The \\"manager\\" also needs to be fired because rather than be apologetic and reassure customers, he berated me and was all up in my face pointing fingers, making up bs excuses for their behaviors. The way he handled this whole situation was unprofessional and if he's the manager then he's setting a great example of how to get people to never come back. No wonder his employees act this way. I will make sure all the people I know never come back to this location ever again."},{"name":"Ceviche Tapas Bar & Restaurant","address":"125 W Church St","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"Love it, love it, love it.

They still had forgotten our queso and we finally got it after finishing our tacos completely. They gave us some queso to go to try and make up for it, but it was the queso with meat (we didn't check until we got home) and neither of us eat meat, so it was kinda pointless.It's just consistently slow, but it's the closest one to me, so I don't really have a choice.

Their presentation is superb and service was okay but the food itself was mediocre. I found that the sushi was just as good as any regular sushi restaurant you find in central Florida. Their prices are much higher than what you usually see in the typical sushi restaurant without anything special to warrant said prices. Overall i was disappointed with what i ordered. It was all just subpar. I couldn't see myself going back even if i was in the area. The soup i had was salty and i found the wontons had an odd frozen taste to them.

After learning all about the restaurant, me and my friends were extremely hyped up and excited to try this place.Decor- super brown, woodsy decor and thai looking (I don't know what authentic Thai restaurants look like but it looks pretty authentic to me). Metal cups, utensils, and plates with floral tablecloth and the clear cover over it. Thai Iced tea- super refreshing and strong. Must order!Ike's Vietnamese Fish Sauce Wings 14.50\\nWe ordered these spicy, and they were so tangy and delicious. but a little bit on the salty side. Not really a big fan of wings, but this one was absolutely unique.Pork Belly and Pork Shoulder Curry 14.50\\nYum! The pork belly was tender and flavorful, and the curry was fresh (not from a powder). Boar Collar Meat 14.50\\nThis was my favorite. The meat and the sauce on top was very light and refreshing, and although they said this was supposed to be extremely spicy, I found it very manageable- not that spicy to me. Khao Soi 14.50 with Chicken\\ncurry noodle soup with chicken and coconut. I am not a big fan of coconut but I could not stop drinking the soup! The chicken leg they gave us was great, we kept picking at it until there was absolutely nothing left.Service- was pretty good for the most part, but we did have to flag them down a few times.Overall, I felt as if the documentaries raised our expectations on Pok Pok. With that said, the dishes were super flavorful and unique, but I wish I had ordered some more of the more traditional dishes you don't ever see around.

HOWEVER. the lemonade, the rosewater lemonade, cherbata was excellent. i loved that. it was sweet and refreshing and beautiful. the roses were very pretty,the service was nice. there host/waiter wasn't memorable at all. but there was this old man that came out with an apron and he was much more attentive. not to mention just absolutely adorable. the food does take a while to come out, but its a very independent operation so i give it the benefit of the doubt.the decor was very very cozy like many of previous people have mentioned. i love the exposed brick and the long drapes over the windows. the plates were actually taken from a cabinet, which gave it that family kitchen feel. i enjoyed the decor. might've been a little cramped, but its just a little location i can't expect any more."},{"name":"Chuy's","address":"8123 International Dr","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"Some of the best Mexican food I've had in my life.

There were plenty of tables available so not sure if they were short on staff, that's how the stagger/pace out service, or if they were intentionally trying to create a wait. Almost everything on the menu was $15-$20 which felt expensive given how relatively inexpensive everything else in Portland was. Understood most dishes are meant to be shared but the portion sizes were pretty small so at most, each dish looked like it could be shared between 2-3 people, maybe 4 if they weren't that hungry. It also bothered me that they were trying so hard to recreate a casual street food vibe (sticky plastic table cloths, tin cups and plates, basically sitting on top of the tables next to you, etc.) which felt really inconsistent with what they were charging. The menu can be a little intimidating but the descriptions and commentary were really helpful in deciding what to order.Service was friendly but a little slow. For the food, the wings were every bit as good as the hype. It's 6 wings for $16 but the wings were pretty large. The mussel crepe (hoi thwat) was salty to the point of being inedible and even if it was meant to be eaten with rice, it wouldn't have helped. Overall, food was hit or miss and it didn't feel like it was worth the price or a long wait but definitely recommend getting just the wings if you can pop in at a random time when there is little to no wait."},{"name":"Mo's Pizza","address":"3109 Briarcliff Rd NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3.5","text":"I was in the area running errands, saw this spot, never heard of it before, so gave it a shot and grabbed a quick to-go order. \\nI mean QUICK!!!!!! \\nThe cashier was extremely friendly and efficient in taking my special requests.

Save some of the bread they give you in the begining and use it to scoop up the remaining sauce from the plate...so amazing!  I have also had the Cod stuffed couquettes (?) and those were TASTY!!!!   I try to get something different every time since the menu is massive, there's no reason to just get the same thing every time :)\\nNow...for my favorite item... white sangria!!!!   So yummy!!! They also have a red, so for the traditionalists out there, you're covered.  They do have a happy hour special, can't remember what it is, but I do remember that I wanted to go back for it....so it must have been good :)\\nSo, YES! Go check this place out.  There's gonna be something for everyone and I believe that's what makes it such a unique place to go for lifes celebrations."},{"name":"Commonwealth Restaurant and Market","address":"11 Broad Canal Way","city":"Cambridge","stars":"3.5","text":"Decent spot for lunch fare or after-work drinks. I haven't been wowed by any of the food but the portions are very large and I love the decor. Most recently I went for a work lunch on Monday. I got the kale salad with chicken. Very filling option, but there was way too much kale and very few sweet potato pieces. The chicken was cooked well but could have had a little more flavor. On a previous visit, I've had the crispy cauliflower sandwich, which is a great option for vegetarians. The pickled peppers add a lot of flavor. During the summer this place gets pretty lively since it's right next to Charles River Kayaking. Overall, wouldn't necessarily come here for the food, but not a bad place to grab a drink if you are in the area."},{"name":"Weather Up","address":"1808 E Cesar Chavez St","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"Wow worst service & fancy, what a combo.

That alone makes me want to return as many restaurants don't take the time to speak with their customers. So the food: \\nThe salsas that come with the chips are very authentic. Both the red and green salsa are extremely flavorful. I wish they were a little spicier but they still were packed with flavor. We ordered the trio to munch on as an appetizer and it came with queso, guacamole, and refried bean dip. All three were delicious but the guacamole was OUT OF THIS WORLD. Best guac I have ever had. My fianc√© ordered the \\"hair of the dog\\" fries which had carnitas, a fried egg, cheese, and salsa verde. We both thought the flavor\\nCombination was delicious and he said he would order them again. I got the posole, which I was super excited to see on the menu as I rarely see it in central Florida. We make posole every Christmas Eve for dinner so I was excited to see how this compared. It was amazing! The pork was so tender and it was spiced perfectly.

It closes at 7PM and you have to request access from the desk next to the room. However, it's definitely worth checking out if you can.

Since it's crazy hot in Portland today, we decided to go ahead and order take out back to our Airbnb. The menu can be quite overwhelming - I used the help of Yelp Photos to help me narrow down some must-try items.  Thankfully, Alec @ the Takeout Window was extremely helpful and patient with answering our questions. We ended up ordering:1. Ike's Vietnamese Fish Sauce Wings - They are a tad spicy - extremely flavorful and delicious. 2. Khao Soi - Chicken, Beef or Veggie. Alec recommended the Veggie as the Chicken & Beef can be a bit more oily than the Tofu/Mushrooms. 3. Pok Pok Special - Half Papaya Salad (Beware, the sauce is spiccccccy - use sparingly) + Half a Roasted Natural Chicken4. Cha Cha La Vong - We originally wanted to try the Prawns in a Claypot, however Alec mentioned that this dish is better enjoyed at the restaurant since it is served in the clay pot to preserve the flavor etc. Totally worth trying out this restaurant - would recommend to friends who visit in the future!

The place is still cafeteria style, and everything is either already on display or is made right in front of you.  Kyriakos, the owner, still knows who I am and anytime he sees me asks how everything is going and such, which just adds to the \\"home\\" type feel this place has.  All the workers that are there too have been very friendly and happy to help give suggestions for food to people I go with that have never been before.I've had quite a few of the things on the menu here, and some things I would definitely recommend are the Turkey dinner, the Moussaka, the Shepherds Pie, the chicken and lemon soup, any of their club sandwiches, and their mac and cheese.  I can't say I really have a favorite dish here, as everything I've had here is really good and it really depends what I am in the mood for.  They also serve breakfast and brunch stuff here, but I usually get lunch or dinner items, so I can't really say much about their breakfast items.Whenever I'm back home from college, this is one of the places that I consistently go to as I love the food, service, and memories that I've had at this place.

We didn't say anything, he sat us towards the back. He gives us the menu and quickly ask if we are ready, we tell him we need more time. So we order and when we got our food we politely asked if we can have chili, the lady brings out chili paste and we ask if we can also have sriracha, she seemed irritated and said ok then as we where going to get the chili paste she takes it and then brings the sriracha which was a small little dipping bowl amount! We ask her if we can have another one and she says \\"why do you need another one you have this one finish it and I I'll give you another one\\" at that point we all looked at her and she goes back and gives us another one and puts it on the table quickly. She never did bring back our chili paste, I assume she put it back to give to someone else. The food was ok, pretty bland, but temperature wise it was hot.

The ones I tried in the past were either too sweet or lacking a distinct flavor. Clearly, I'd never had any from the Macaron Queen! I stopped by the kiosk on a whim to ask about custom macarons for a baby shower. The associate was pleasant and answered my questions to the best of her knowledge. I was just gathering info and not planning to try them, until I saw they offered red velvet. I thought it odd I couldn't pick the flavors I wanted, but eventually settled on a package sans mango. Ohmigod. These were perfectly chewy and full of clearly recognizable flavor. I could eat the lemon and red velvet all day. Even my husband and his persnickety palate loved them. \\n \\n**Note to the Owners: Please allow a la carte orders.

I was offered a table promptly and my drink order taken. This place is very nice and decorated in a very traditional manner. My drink was delivered promptly and I ordered the Galbi lunch special. As I enjoyed my drink my entree arrived in a reasonable amount of time. On the tray was a delicious and generous helping of tender Galbi. A simply salad and pickled bean sprouts. A veggie dumpling, deep fried tofu, and sweet potato tempura. A big covered bowl of steamed rice completed this combination perfectly.

I asked for extra sauce for my two orders of gyro over rice in my uber eats order (something I know they honor since I've done it before). Normally each order of gyro over rice comes with a container of hot sauce and white sauce, as well as both sauces poured on the gyro. Instead of extra sauce, I got only one container of white sauce (that means three containers of sauce were missing). When I asked for the hot sauce, they said that I only asked for white sauce (not true, I checked the order). I had to insist on the hot sauce so that they'd reluctantly give me one. Then I had to ask for the second container of hot sauce (as I normally should've gotten) which they only filled up half way. I'm not sure if things are tight or if the two workers were having a bad day, but they should've given me at least some of both sauces since it's listed in their menu.

I think that's the lot. Zhug on the side, but honestly, it doesn't need the sauce.

Typically eaten as breakfast, it's good for lunch or dinner here in the US.  It's flavorful, rich in ingredients, and if your order the Sampan version, without the intestines and preserved eggs that westerners find odd.The combination roast plate, about $18, is huge with your choice of duck, pork, tripe, and other meats.  The duck is delicious, the pork has great crispy skin and very flavorful meat, and the trip is just about one of my favorite.  Lunch menus are reasonably priced, and my non-Asian family enjoyed it more than well enough.  The staff is friendly, the place is clean, and they will pack your leftovers for you.The only criticism I have is their egg noodle soups.

Compared to other sushi buffets I've always held Nori Nori at the pinnacle of quality since you're paying so much to eat there. Now, it's just okay. The sushi quality is mediocre and the rice tastes too dry. The kitchen food is too salty and for the most part just not worth it for me to get.

Showed up very early in the dinner hour, and were told to sit \\"by the window\\" (there are three window tables - one was already occupied). We picked the one that was farthest from the table with people, and sat down. Waited a couple of minutes, then got sharply told off from across the room, that we were seated at the wrong table. Of course, if they'd taken us to the table properly, we'd have known that we were meant to sit at a specific table, and not just either of the window tables. We wanted to stay at our chosen table, but were forced to move; apparently a big group was coming soon and they needed that table to form part of a bigger table. That aside, the restaurant is clean and organized, and they appear to be doing booming takeout business.Get the menu, and all the prices are covered over and re-written. Lol. Probably time to get new menus! Within a minute, the waitress is over to take our order. We haven't had a chance to go through more than the appies at this point, but she's quite insistent we order, so we say we will order our appetizers first, and then work on mains. Husband orders the BBQ pork appetizer, and told, \\"No BBQ pork. It causes cancer.\\" WTF? Then he says, \\"Ok, I'll have pork dumplings,\\" and she responds, \\"Too hard to make.\\" At this point, I am choking back laugher. I have never been to a restaurant that flat out refuses to make things on their menu, just because they didn't feel like it.A couple of minutes later, the first of our appetizers, a soup, comes out, and we tell her we are ready to order our mains. \\"One minute,\\" we are told. Over 15 minutes, 6 separate requests from us, and innumerable distractions later, we finally get our order in. It was like some kind of joke. I wondered if we were on one of those pranking shows. She would acknowledge us, then go take payment from another table, greet and seat a guest, answer the phone, hand over a take-out order, brush us off again, go to the back... on and on it went. We were pretty close to getting up and leaving at that point, but there was something cluelessly amusing about it, so we stuck around.Finally got our mains ordered, and the food came quickly. Overall, the food was fairly decent, if a little bit bland at times (and some sauces kind of thick/gloopy). It was fresh and satisfying, and the ingredients seemed to be good quality. We waited a long time for a table check and water refill, but at least we had our food to work on, so everyone was pretty happy.In the end, it was $90 before tip for 2 adults and 2 kids, which isn't exorbitant for a meal for four, but is about 50% more than the bill normally is for Chinese food at a mid-range restaurant.

The four of us weren't too hungry so we decided to share the following:-\\"Corn dog\\" shrimp\\n-Berkeley house salad\\n-Blackened catfish w/ a side of mac\\n-Jalapeno hanger steak w/ a side of green chile cheddar gritsEverything was fantastic! I was least excited about the salad but it was well dressed and added a bit of freshness. However, I did notice that several leaves in the salad were yellowing, so that is an area for improvement. The \\"corn dog\\" shrimp was great. It's their take on tempura shrimp and it works! Out of the two entrees, I liked the hanger steak more. The catfish was good, but the salsa verde on the hanger steak coupled with the grits was something else! Overall, Moonshine seems to be a great place for all occasions.

They're open Thursday-Sunday, and I could never manage lunch or dinner. My life is complicated. When a big sign went up about \\"now serving breakfast\\" I knew I could manage that. So at around 10:30am on a Sunday I dragged in a hungry friend. There are about eight or ten tables. Only one other table was occupied. There was one friendly man running the show.  He took our order, cooked our food, and waited on us until help arrived a bit later. Omhg the food. Most of the breakfast items are wonderful Mexican breafast standbys. My chilaquiles verdes was so good: tender tortillas, perfect green chile sauce, expertly cooked eggs,extra delicious smoky carnitas, tasty beans and rice. Really really good stuff. And a lot of it. My dining companion had a farmer's scramble with savory spicy chorizo, chiles, eggs,  lovely potatoes, and cheese. It came with rice, beans, and warm corn tortillas. It was freaking delicious. The coffee was good. We had to find the sugar (on the counter) while our food was being prepared, but we didn't mind. I wasn't really excited that the only cream offering was nondairy french vanilla creamer in little cups, I would be happier with half and half, but that is literally our only complaint. Breakfast was utterly reasonable, under $20, and I like the homey small town feel of it. It totally reminded me of little places in Arizona, where I grew up.I am willing to put up with small issues for those big tastes of home.  And in case you missed it, the food is REALLY good.

Usually stuffed clams are filed with bread crumbs and chopped up clam. But this had the entire clam intact. They were super plump and fresh. The stuffing was super tasty as well. Very zesty and crunchy on the outside. Each order came with 5 clams and was $10. We were given the option to add another clam for $2. Definitely worth a try.

I got tacos and nachos. The tacos today is  OK, but has absolutely no dressing just a few shredded cheese that I barely even noticed until I taste one of them and a few lettuce and tomatoes. Not even a dash of sour cream or salsa. The nachos seem store bought; they were mediocre with just a small side of salsa and no cheese, which I can just buy from a convenient store. I have tasted better tacos and nachos than this and I have been to a number of Mexican themed restaurants. As for the customer service, the guy who was helping me didn't even let me finish my orders and instead just proceed to \\"preparing my order\\" before I even finish saying what I want. Also, there's this guy who was on the phone at the time who was quite rude when he was trying to \\"ask me\\" what to drink by tapping the cup on the fountain. That guy didn't even listen when I told him I want sprite with no ice. None of the staffs even ask if I want anything on my tacos and nachos. It's like they just want me to leave as soon as possible. As for the decor, it was OK. I have nothing bad to say about their decor. Today wasn't busy during lunch. So that should not be an excuse for bad service.

I chose the Nacho Totchos, which consist of chicken, pico de Gallo, sour cream, jalape√±os and cheese sauce. A whole nom nom situation. The cheese sauce covers the bottom of the plate and it's so good. This is definitely perfection on a plate. Just typing this makes me want them right now.

The menu is huge and there's plenty of options.  I have a long way to go before exhausting my choices, but I return often to favorites like the mole enchiladas (cheese or chicken), tacos al pastor, or the shrimp endiabolados appetizers.  These are all good value for money and spicy and hot as they should be. I have not encountered any lamentable \\"gringo-ization\\" of the food at Casa Arandinas.  Three different sauces are supplied with the complimentary chips during happy hour or with meals and they all pack some heat.  The margaritas I've sampled have all been excellent (superior fresh-squeezed lime juice) and the bar makes a truly fine Mai Tai that's heavy on the citrus flavors and doesn't have the syrupy sweetness that ruins so many of these drinks at other places. Terrific breakfast tacos, too.   They say there's mariachis sometimes but I've never been lucky enough to catch them.

The lobster roe noodles and briskets are served with a generous piece of lobster tail and tender pieces of briskets. The lobster rolls are served alongside a ridiculous amount of fries (I personally hate this, but that's the standard I guess). If the entree is all you order, you may feel that it's on the small side and walk away hungry. But be assured that the food on your plate is carefully prepared and cooked to perfection.The desserts here, at 10 dollars each, is the perfect way to end your dinner.

I asked about the Chilean sea bass, was it the thick Chilean sea bass or the thin sea bass?  The server said \\"thick\\".  It definitely was NOT the Chilean I expected.  I would guess it was no more than 2 ounces.  For the price (in a market it's around $30/lb) I expected at least a 3 ounce piece.  The truffle fries were more like crispy potato sticks.

Check.I've heard stories about the daunting wait, but a (relatively) early, weekday solo show-up resulted in sans list and immediate seating. I picked one of the in-between bar seats that straddles the interior dining room and the outdoor veranda.It's not hyperbole to state that I wanted to devour anything and everything on the menu. I could easily see Pok Pok's optimal dining adventure as one experienced with a large party, whereby sharing small bites becomes a diverse culinary affair. Unfortunately, the aforementioned solo led me to limit myself to an app and main, accompanied by a cold brew.I had to start with the famed Ike's Vietnamese fish sauce wings and end with the Khao Soi curry noodle soup. The former is really, really good. It's a large dish, with a half dozen wings, inclusive of wing and drumstick mix, easily a full meal for one and shareable amongst, well, up to six. However, it's not otherworldly, compared to your local buffalo wing joint (ATX-finest Plucker's lemon pepper FTW) or regional variants like Korean KFC. The khao soi is. I cannot recommend this dish enough; it's so incredible, it'll make my deathbed top whatever dish list.I'm half-Singaporean, and while I don't take my curry as seriously as some of my fellow brethren, it's innate somewhere in my blood. The kicker on this dish is the house-made coconut milk, which lends a richness and complexity to the broth that is mind-blowing. It made me wish I'd ordered the house special cocktail instead of a beer, a play on pina colada that involved that aforementioned coconut milk.Back to the khao soi. The curry flavor accompanying the coconut milk. Equally phenomental. Everything else is window-dressing. The springy, chewy noodles are excellent, and the pickled mustard greens (a must with my Taiwanese alter-ego favorite dish) are a nice complement. Honestly, the only superfluous ingredient is the protein. I selected beef but ended up leaving residual pieces in the bowl while I slurped the broth clean. If I were re-ordering, I'd select the much less intrusive and flavor chameleon tofu.Too long, didn't read?

A few impressions:\\nDecor is impressive. Really nice slightly upscale vibe. \\nThe wine menu is very well put together. \\nThe food however was unmemorable, especially at the price point. Our appetizer (Frito Misto) was lightly battered (in a good way..), but the accompanying sauce was a bit bland. My wife had to return the Salmon dinner as it was almost completely uncooked in the center. It's possible it was then microwaved, and was certainly put back on the same plate.\\nOur server passed us several times without making eye contact,  so it was a  bit hard to convey when we needed something,  and of course we didn't want to call across the restaurant for her.\\nOverall,  nothing about the experience made us feel like we would want to return"},{"name":"Steve's Pok√© Bar","address":"4A 9965 152 Street","city":"Surrey","stars":"4.5","text":"Finally, poke in Surrey! First time here and I was impressed. The girl at the counter was super helpful: as I sampled each type she gave a commentary on the subtleties of each flavour to help me decide. I settled on a large bowl of shoyu salmon and spicy scallops. Very flavourful marinade, though in hindsight I wished my poke-to-toppings ratio was higher. Speaking of toppings, I like that they offer quinoa in place of rice! Overall, I enjoyed my first try at Steve's thoroughly, having customized it further with sauces from the self-serve bar. Their water cups are small though, but likely to encourage buying a drink. The decor on the wall describing the company's journey is a nice personal touch.

But 20 minutes go by before I had to get up and ask for my cleanse. The guy tells me \\"well you came in the middle of a rush\\" and I'm thinking \\"are you retarded? I've already finished my large drink. I didn't JUST get here.\\"I see the girl behind the juicer make a half gallon of a cleanser that wasn't mine and I new immediately she made the wrong one. But tells the guy next to Her that cleanses take \\"about 30 min\\". I rolled my eyes. ***wrong. The other juiceland makes my cleanses in about 10min even with a rush. Five minutes later I go back and the guy finally admits that the girl made the wrong cleanse and says it'll be another 15 minutes. Are you serious? And then he has the audacity to ask it I have anything to do!? Because that would make it better that I'm waiting 30+ minutes for my drink. If I told him I was on the way to see my dying mother would that have lit a fire under their asses? *pardon my language. Actually no I have nothing to do today and came here because I had time to waste. Please please make me wait longer! (note my sarcasm. I would have said it outloud except they may have taken me seriously). He tries to offer me a shot as a consolation and I decline because no 2oz sample cup of grass is going to help me at this point. Maybe 5 minutes later my half gallon is ready and I'm thinking \\"oh yeah, that took 15 minutes\\" and the girl puts it down and says \\"Thank you\\"Bitz, please.

I got a spicy pork bone soup, while my friend got the bibimbap. They were accompanied by a side of kimchi (cabbage & radish, which we cut ourselves with the scissors they give), but the soup I ordered was plentiful for me on its own. I can be a little picky about rice, but despite being just a tad softer than what I usually prefer, it was perfect with the soup. In terms of spice, it was the perfect amount. *For reference, I can eat most store-bought kimchi without need for water, but a couple bites of the notorious hot fire chicken noodle leaves me crying.

We got there around 6PM on a Saturday and we had to wait about an hour and a half, but it wasn't too bad because we explored the downtown area while we waited. They start the table off with popcorn which I thought was unique and tasted like the buttery goodness of movie theater popcorn. In terms of drinks, I got the Blind Mule which is moonshine, lime juice, and ginger beer and I was a huge fan of this drink! We ordered a few appetizers including the fried green tomatoes and the original moonshine corndog shrimp. I personally strongly dislike tomatoes, so I can't speak too much for those, but the rest of my table loved them. The corndog shrimp were so good and many in our party said this was the highlight of the entire meal. In terms of main dishes, we ordered the chicken and waffles, the chicken fried steak and the jalapeno hangar steak. I would say skip on the chicken and waffles. It was good, but nothing out of this world and I've definitely had better. The chicken fried steak was so good and so giant! I would definitely recommend sharing this one. The jalapeno hangar steak was definitely where it's at! It was so good and I would 10/10 recommend this dish! For sides I tried the baked macaroni and the green chili cheddar grits. The macaroni was solid but nothing out of this world but the grits were fantastic! Just the right amount of flavor. Overall, I definitely enjoyed this place and would come back the next time I'm in Austin.

The BBQ Pork was very juicy and tender and had these tasty little crispy bits around the meat.I also came by on a separate visit to give their Breakfast Special (4.99 + 1.00 for coffee) a go. The one thing that struck me about this breakfast was that it was surprisingly not greasy! The fries were actually pan friend potatoes that were super crispy and had a light seasoning to them. The sausages were your usual breakfast fare (these were a little bit sweet actually). The owner from the other shop was so funny.

I am a big fan of personal pizzas, as my husband and I don't always want the same toppings. At Your Pie, there is no limit to how many toppings you can choose. Wow! And for only $8.50. The pizza was delicious. I made my meal a combo and had a side salad with the pizza. There was more than I could eat, which was nice because I took home three slices of pizza for lunch.We had the cheesy bread sticks as an appetizer, and they were a table pleaser. The perfect amount of cheese, a hint of garlic and incredibly scrumptious. Definitely order these!I had a small scoop of the butterfinger gelato after my meal. This might be my new spot for dessert! Seriously, the gelato was amazing. Only a handful of flavors to choose from, but with the butterfinger, you really don't need any other flavors.The staff was friendly and walked us through the entire process. Also, there is a free parking deck. Double win for a restaurant in Atlanta!We are looking forward to the craft beer selection and trivia nights that are coming soon.Overall, Your Pie is a winner.

Everything was very good. The highlights were the karaage, the mackerel nigiri, in the ramen. Especially the karaage. It was just outstanding.

My friends and I split a curry puff appetizer, which was surprisingly delicious. It tasted like Indian curry, which I was surprised about. The pastry itself was very light and melted in your mouth. A great starter! On to the curry itself. I was so so happy upon taking my first bite, because I immediately knew I had found what I've been looking for in the past few weeks. The vegetables were cooked to the perfect softness and flavor. The chicken was tender and flavorful. The rice was fragrant and perfectly cooked. The curry sauce was the perfect thickness and well seasoned. All around, a delicious dish, and also beautifully presented. Also, for only $10.95 for dinner, there was enough food for two meals - massive servings!!!The only reason that this isn't a five star review is because the service was not the best. The servers seemed very busy with the crowd, so it is understandable. However, it did take us multiple attempts to get the servers' attention each time, and they were quite frazzled.

This was my second time ordering from this restaurant and I am very disappointed and felt they dealt with the issue in a very unprofessional manner. They put me on hold for over ten minutes so they could talk to the manager. Why should I pay for something that I did NOT order.

Aptly named, Hit the Spot does just that. The cafe and library are all one building, and you enter through the front of the library, which is small but well done: it has several shelves and furniture that speaks to an old colonial-style. The pictures of every president behind the white desk adds to the romantic nature of the idea. The cafe has twelve tables and booths of different sizes and a well-developed menu that offers everything one could want off a highway between Houston and Austin.We stopped in for breakfast and were surprised at how many offerings they had. To be clear, the kitchen cooks southern style meals--so our food restrictions went out the door when we opened the menu. No gluten free. No baked options. But we didn't care because we were starving and everything looked delicious! I ordered the miga plate with a side of bacon (crispy or not, your choice). I was happy to see that they were not afraid of spice and flavor, offering jalape√±os in the eggs and two salsas for any preference. When I say it was the tastiest migas I have experienced, that is no exaggeration--the eggs were well cooked, the tortillas were crispy, and the cheese added a creaminess that was perfection. The hash browns added superb texture as well. The side of crispy bacon was a bit overdone but that didn't hurt the meal one bit.My partner ordered the short stack of pancakes and a side of bacon as well: two well-sized fluffy pancakes with a mix of salty and sweet made a large meal. The flavor was perfect and went so well with syrup and a side of bacon.Altogether this place is a diamond in the countryside, nestled between fields, unassuming on the side of a highway in the outskirts of Austin.

The Chicken Bastilla was like nothing I've had before. The pastry was flaky and buttery while the chicken filling inside was full of flavors with the well-balanced spices. Surprisingly, the copius amount of icing sugar and cinnamon on top of the Bastilla tie everything together perfectly - the ideal blend of sweet and savory. Got to say this one is a must here!The Zalouk which is a dip consisting of eggplant and tomato was also a hit. It was cistrusy and fresh because of the tomatos and had a slightly thick consistency from the blended eggplant; the flavor was, again, spot on. The Zalouk came with a side of Moroccan bread that is similar to pita bread other than that it has a rougher and thicker texture. However, it was the perfect side for the dip, soaking up all the flavors with its coarser consistency.The Seafood Tangines added the necessary proteins to the meal with plenty of scallops, shrimps, and a couple of slices of tilapia. All the seafood was well-cooked. The tangines also came with a lot of stewed veggies, adding natural sweetness to the dish that balances out the sourness of the dish. The tangine is served with a side of either rice or cous cous.The food was stunning but I had to duck one star for the rather negligent service. We got to the place right at the dot at 11AM but the store was still closed and being set up. Nobody approached us to inform us of what was happening and we're left waiting cluelessly outside.

I had the blueberry lemonade one! My hubby had the spicy mule. The selection of oysters is phenomenal. We tried 4 different kinds but I don't remember which ones. All were fantastic. The clams are to die for. The lobster Roe short rib pasta is a combination I never thought of but am so glad it exists. The buttery fattiness of the short rib really brings out the sweetness of the lobster. The cayenne honey butter is out of this world. Wish they sold it by the jar. The only thing I wasn't fond of was the lobster bisque but they took it off the bill. I think it just needs more cream.

After hearing Pok Pok come up every time I asked for recommendations in Portland, making a stop here was a no brainer.We absolutely loved Ike's Vietnamese Fish Sauce Wings. The wings were plump and had great texture, and each wing was an umami bomb of flavor. I've had Vietnamese chicken wings before and always found them to be more on the vinegary side, but Pok Pok wings were very savory and ended on a sweet note. I recommend getting the wings spicy, as the peppers don't pack too much heat and just elevate the fish sauce and garlic flavors. We also got the Kung Op Wun Sen which was a clay pot full of seafood, pork belly, and veggies. It comes with a yummy dipping sauce that packs a ton of flavor, and all the components of the dish meshed really well.Definitely plan on passing the hype forward to all my friends visiting Portland.

Modern, elegant and definitely very busy. But this does nothing to the quality of the food provided , especially the oyster at. I got to say though..I'm not a big fan of Massachusetts oysters...just a bit too salty for my taste. However there are still quite a variety of MA oysters here and I was surprised at the depth of taste each brought to the palate. Lobster roll was great too but a bit too pricy in my opinion.

I'll round these guys to 4. We had an enjoyable dinner here.Smoke Ring is a barbecue restaurant that opened in the Castleberry Hill neighborhood of Downtown Atlanta in November 2013. I first visited this restaurant shortly after it opened for a Yelp event in December 2013 (https://bit.ly/2ERGtgN) and have subsequently returned. This place appears to still be going strong. It's part of the 101 Concepts restaurant group that includes other Atlanta area restaurants like Food 101 (Sandy Springs), Meehan's Public House (Vinings location only), and 101 Steak (Vinings). The restaurant is named after the smoke ring that's formed when smoking meats for barbecue.The restaurant is in a prime location because it's close to Mercedes-Benz Stadium (Falcons, United, college football), State Farm Arena (Hawks), and the Georgia World Congress Center (conventions, trade shows). If you're attending an event downtown, this is a great spot to grab lunch or dinner. The patio has a nice view of State Farm Arena.Smoke Ring is situated on the ground level of the Castleberry Point Lofts building. Free parking is available on the street (pay attention to parking signs) and in the Castleberry Point garage. The entrance to the garage is on Chapel St SW.The space still looks good after several years. The bar and dining room share an open space that has a bit of a rustic feel to it. They have lots of TVs which are great for watching sports and decor consists of flags/banners, signs, and various trophies and awards/recognitions the business has earned. There's plenty of seating from small tables for two to long tables for groups. We visited on a Tuesday night and the restaurant seemed moderately busy with a mix of both regulars/locals and out-of-town business travelers.Smoke Ring's barbecue menu consists of pulled pork ($14), sliced brisket ($16), pulled chicken ($13), pork belly ($16), chicken (1/2 for $13), sliced turkey ($13), and baby back ribs (1/2 rack for $17, full rack for $29). Like other barbecue restaurants, they offer sandwiches and plates with Southern sides liked baked beans and potato salad. They also offer smoked wings in a few different flavors (6 for $9, 10 for $14, 20 for $26); apps like fried pickles ($7), deviled eggs ($6), and fried green tomatoes ($9); soups (Brunswick stew) and salads; several kinds of sandwiches ($11-15 each); and desserts such as bread pudding ($6) and key lime pie ($5). Beverage-wise, they've got a full bar with beer, wine, and liquor.We ordered 2 trays and tried 4 meats and 4 sides:Meats\\n* Pulled pork\\n* Sliced brisket\\n* Pork belly\\n* Baby back ribsSides\\n* Chopped slaw\\n* Mac & cheese\\n* Creamed corn\\n* Collard greens1/2 rack of ribs + 1 meat with 2 sides and Texas toast cost $22. A \\"pick 2\\" meat BBQ plate with 2 sides and Texas toast cost $17 (pick 3 meats is $21 and pick 4 meats is $27).In general, the food was good, but not great. Our favorite meat, without a doubt, was the baby back ribs. They were meaty, fall-off-the-bone tender, and flavorful. I liked the savory spice rub. The ribs were tasty enough on their own to not need any sauce. If you order only one meat, get the ribs.The sliced beef brisket was my second favorite. The portion size was generous. They gave us several long and thick slices of brisket that ranged from very lean to very fatty. Of course, the fatty pieces tasted better, but I appreciated the lean pieces too. Far from the best brisket I've had in town (that distinction belongs to DAS BBQ on the Upper Westside), but still not bad and worth ordering. Quality.The pulled pork and pork belly were OK. The pulled pork was more like chopped pork. Unfortunately, it was a little too dry and tough for my liking, but the sauces definitely helped. The pork belly fared better. Pork belly isn't something you see too often on a barbecue restaurant menu so we knew we had to try it. Like the brisket, we got long and thick slices of pork belly. They had charred outer edges, a subtle pink smoke ring of their own, and grill marks across the meat. They didn't have a whole lot of flavor, so sauce was also needed for these guys.House barbecue sauces, in squeeze bottles at every table, included tangy vinegar, white BBQ (mayo-based), and sweet (tomato-based). I liked the vinegar-based sauce the best. The other two were good, but thicker, richer, and more overpowering.The sides were solid. My favorite was the collard greens followed by the mac and cheese. I love collard greens and Smoke Ring's greens were the sweetest I've ever tried. We asked for some pepper sauce and got a bottle of the restaurant's yummy housemade pepper sauce. The shell macaroni was an ideal balance of cheesy and creamy. The creamed corn and slaw were also delicious. The corn was rich in flavor and thick in consistency, almost pasty. The slaw was cold, crunchy, and refreshing, a nice contrast to all the smoky meats.Service was good. Our orders came out fast."},{"name":"The Meatball Stoppe","address":"7325 Lake Underhill Rd","city":"Orlando","stars":"4.5","text":"Great mom and pop place, always try to visit places like this when I come to Orlando on vacation.

A big plus is how the patty is just right in juiciness. The patty is not rich in flavor, but the onions help with adding more taste.The fries that come with the burger are crispy and lightly seasoned with salt and pepper. You can definitely enjoy your meal without worrying too much about grease in the burger or fries.The bar is huge and has a good number of draft options if that is your style.

Me and my sister ordered a dozen of the char-grilled oysters along with another dozen of the regular oysters. They have a nice variety of the type of oysters; although I can't remember which ones we ordered, they were good. Unfortunately, the char-grilled oysters were extremely small as well as the regular ones. For an entree, I had the market fish option of the seared Salmon. My sister had the stuffed shrimp. Both were pretty mediocre. The presentation of both entrees were nice, but the meals themselves were bland. My salmon came with two steak potato wedges with broccoli. My salmon was rather bland and I only truly tasted the grill, despite the fact I had the lemon herb sauce to go on top. Overall, this is a very upscale and classy place with a beautiful aviance.

We got a mix of entr√©es. The ones I can remember was the papaya saladWhich was perfectly spicy and salty and tart. Another favorite was a light yellow curry with noodles and papaya was some pork and fish. It was really delicate flavorful. The other dishes were not so successful. When that comes to mind is the steak salad which was way too salty and needed a bite of white rice to neutralize. Service was average.

All of the skewers (chicken, steak, mushroom) are good and I recently tried the saut√©ed cauliflower with egg, which was surprisingly one of the best cauliflower dishes I've ever had. Even if you're not a big fan of cauliflower, you might like this dish! Plus, it never hurts to add some veggies to your meal. I also highly recommend the hibiscus lime slushie! It's so refreshing. The only thing I don't like is that the paper straws that they give you for the slushie are pretty terrible. I'm all for reducing the use of plastic straws, but there's gotta be better paper straws that don't completely lose function after a few minutes.

This is one of those warehouses turned into an amazing looking, chic, upscale restaurants. We had reservations, but still had to wait 15-20 minutes before we were seated, so the hostesses suggested hanging out at the bar area. Though the ladies didn't really seem to care that a bunch of us were waiting to be seated, one guy (I guess a manager-type guy) made sure to update us every once in a while. We couldn't get over just how beautiful we thought the restaurant was and I guess from that, we built up expectations of the rest of the place.After we were seated, our waitress came over and introduced herself, and went over the menu briefly before leaving to let us look over it. Not long after, a basket of warm bread and butter was set down before us. We felt as though there was nothing special about any of the breads, and if anything, we actually didn't like any of them so we pushed the entire basket aside. For the appetizers, we ordered the Buttermilk Soaked Calamari and White Oak Pastures Braised Short Rib. Again, nothing special, though the calamari was very fresh and neither of us cared for the short rib app. For entrees, we ordered the Prime London Broil Steak and the Heritage Breed Dry Aged Pork Porterhouse. Yet again, we weren't impressed. After we both tried each component of our own dishes, and then swapped and tried the other, we pushed these off to the side, too, and just held hands and became enthralled in our own conversation. By this point, Natalie (another manager or manager-type employee, who had complimented me on my shoes when she saw us earlier, before we were seated) approached us and said she had noticed that we hardly touched our dinners and if there was something she could do for us -- get us new entrees, provide feedback to the chefs as to why we weren't happy with the food, etc. We graciously declined new entrees and made sure we let her know how appreciative we were of her generous offer. In hindsight, we both admitted to each other that we should've ordered the Pan Roasted Rainbow Trout instead. Disappointed that there wasn't anything she could do to make our evening more enjoyable, she let us know that our desserts were on the way. Mm.. desserts. I ordered the Fudge Cake with Mocha Cream and he ordered the Butterscotch Pot de Cr√®me with Chantilly cream and Toffee crunch. Both were too decadent for our tastes and we were only able to finish half.To our surprise, our waitress informed us that Natalie comped us for one of our meals. In return for their gratitude, I definitely made sure to leave a huge tip (off of the original total, of course) in cash. This was originally going to be a three-star review. However, the following day, the beau noticed a decent discrepancy between his receipt and online bank statement. It should've only been the one meal, plus taxes, because I left the tip in cash, as aforementioned. Hm.There is valet only, but there are a couple of lots you can park in within a reasonable walking distance.This place is definitely swanky and high class.

Even though I'm at a point in my life where I don't really want to own a lot of physical books anymore (they just take up so much space and I have a Kindle and a library card), I still love coming to bookstores to look at what they have, discover something new, and enjoy people enjoying literature.Powell's is a really cool place. They have stacks on multiple floors so there's no way you couldn't find something that interests you. There's a well-curated local Portland/Oregon section as well as nicely put-together displays of different literature on the first floor that seems to change often. There's staff recommendations written on cards and there's enough employees roaming around that you can always ask someone a question.I was really, really giddy to find they had a foreign language section with new and used French books. I'm a French speaker and teacher and I'm always on the lookout for French books for my classroom and home libraries. I found a wonderful copy of Mother Goose stories in French, complete with illustrations. Though it was used, it was in great condition and I was happy to add it to my home collection. There were a ton of books on learning language as well as used novels so you could read something in a new language on the cheap.At the end of our tour around the store we stopped in the \\"knickknack\\" section (I guess that's what it's called?). They were selling all kinds of cute things like socks, bags, scarves, toys, games...

Like everyone recommends, Ike's wings are the thing to get! You can get them spicy or not-spicy, and my bf being the biggest spice enthusiast, we went with spicy. Honestly, they are TOO spicy for me, but the sauce is so good I powered through and let my tongue suffer a sweet death. He, however, thought it was perfect. On top of the wings, we got the curry pork belly and that... was amazing. The curry flavor is so strong! I love it. The pork belly was also so soft, the pork fat melted in my mouth. This dish was made by loving hands. Each bite was a hug and I savored it. Glad we had leftovers... Somehow, our stomachs expanded when we saw the food coming. Interesting! The service was excellent as well! They were prepared with recommendations, and were quick with our every demand. The table is also set up with cute dinner ware, metal cups, peanuts... it was a cute experience. The servers were so.. homely, casual? It made us feel less like tourists and more like locals. The restaurant had a very intimate feel, yet it was very loud. I would definitely bring a date here, or even bring my entire family! Not sure of the day we went, but it was around 3:00 PM on a Thursday/Friday, so our wait was only about 15 minutes? Probably less. We may have been lucky as we saw people waiting outside after with 1hr waits. It was also an awkard time between lunch and dinner, but the restaurant was still packed outside and inside!

A nice lady left me a message saying that I called the wrong number and she called Pok Pok for me to make reservations but she didn't know how many were in my party.  WOW!  I called her back and thanked her, she said she gets those calls a lot and to try to chicken wings. =)I eventually dialed the right number and the hostess suggested that I didn't need reservations for 2.  But to tell you the truth, I wish I made reservations for 2 because we still had to wait and the only seats open were the bar seats and the ones outside next to the rice cookers.  The set up of this place is pretty wicked.  There's an indoor area that's tightly packed and then outdoor areas that are covered and then an area in between where a few people can sit for a quick meal.  I've been here a couple of times, I highly recommend the chicken wings.  I tend to avoid the spicy ones, but the spicy level isn't spicy at all.

With that said, the basis of this review is taste and value compared to other take out establishments. According to my Foodler account, I've been to Hearth 5 times in the past year. For pizza, I've had the Classic Cheese, Buffalo Chicken, Green Goddess, and Sausage Pepper Onion. I've also had the Caesar Salad, Buffalo Wings, and Meatball Poppers for sides. My major complaint is really the pricing compared to portion. Some of the pizzas are over $21. Salads and appetizers are $9.The pizzas are certainly good, but they taste healthy. When going out for pizza, I'm not exactly concerned about the health benefits. I just want it to taste good and leave me feeling full. For the wings, you get 6 per order. While the wings are good, they are on the small side for $1.50/ea.The meatball poppers I ordered last night were tiny; I'd estimate 1 ounce each. There are 5 per order. They were supposed to be served with focaccia bread, which was absent. The meatballs tasted fine, but almost $2/ea was outrageous. These are meatballs not oysters. The salad is also expensive for what you get. I think $6 would be a fair price for a container of lettuce and croutons. For a pizza and 2 appetizers you can expect to pay between $35-40. This will be enough food to feed no more than 3 adults.I think Hearth will remain in my rotation because it adds a change of pace to my take out routine. However, for it to become my favorite restaurant in Needham, I'm going to need to see better portions and/or more competitive prices. I'd also like to see more protein options on the menu like steak tips (just not at filet mignon prices)."},{"name":"Don Asado","address":"18385 SW Alexander St","city":"Aloha","stars":"4.5","text":"Truly one of my favorite restaurants ever.

We wanted to try Uni, but the line seemed crazy and we heard that Soto compared in level, so we decided to give it a try!I want to say, all in all, the food was very good. We sat in the counter and the chef was very nice to us and knew what he was doing. I wouldn't come to Soto expecting traditional rolls or sushi where you focus on only the fish. Instead, this is more of an eclectic sushi where they have built beautiful creations to help enhance the flavor of the fish that you are eating and give your palate an adventure. My biggest disappointment was the lack of albacore and the quality of the salmon. For the price that we paid, I did expect a higher quality of fish for the salmon. However, I have to admit, what was outstanding for me, was the hamachi - yellowtail dish. I've never tried yellowtail as fresh as this, with such a wonderful texture and in a creative setting. Every single addition to the hamachi made the fish spectacular, and that is the reason why I thought this place was worth it. The \\"chip\\" dish was also very fun and good! Something very unique to Soto, so I'd recommend it.Now in terms of the service, it was an ok experience. In this kind of setting, I'd expect it to be common to order dishes in rounds, rather than all at once, but that didn't seem the norm here. I felt a bit rushed, and wish I could have talked through the menu with someone to get an idea of which dishes would have been right for us. I might have been reading too much into it, but he was very nice and explained things. So, it was a mixture of feelings in that category. All in all, I ended up spending $100 for the both of us and we were still hungry. I would have spent more money if we had found another dish that made us as happy as the hamachi and chip, but we couldn't justify spending as much if we didn't love each dish.

While this place is known for its totchos, I personally don't love tater tots enough to eat a whole plate (I know, I'm the worst) and I've ordered other things off of the menu. The shrimp and grits as well as the Piedmont Pork (served with a yummy jalapeno cheddar bun) have been delicious. This place is also known for its fishbowls, which is a giant, literal fishbowl full of liquor and mixers. My friends and I always get the one with starbursts in it. Be wary that this is a big drink and should be split with a decent bit of people - maybe 2-3.Their other cocktails are delicious as well and generally taste very fruity/candy-like. The only thing I have to complain about is the smell of the place. The patio is lovely but the inside always smells like throw up.

Thank you for creating food that explodes with flavor, is beautifully presented and served in an elegant yet understated atmosphere by friendly wait staff!I don't understand the negative reviews but the short review with one star is suspect as that is the only review from that particular person.  Possibly left by another Thai restaurant owner or employee?We went there for dinner last night and alerted the staff we would be using our groupon.  As another poster mentioned, the staff happily acknowledged this unlike some restaurant in other places who immediately cop an attitude when a groupon is mentioned.   We started with the chicken wontons.  They were crisp and the chicken inside was perfectly seasoned with lemon grass and perhaps galangal.  I rarely order duck unless it is served confit (crispy)  but the description of this special made my mouth water so I asked Mon, the owner/chef about it when she happened to stop by our table.  She described the dish.  I mentioned I generally don't order duck unless it is crispy and didn't like sweet food too much and she offered to crisp up the duck a bit and use fewer lychees so it wouldn't be too sweet.  I love a chef who is willing to push ego aside to alter one of their creations in order to please a customer.When this dish came out the aroma of the red curry with basil over the duck wafted toward me and I knew I was in for a treat!  The duck was cooked to perfection and the sauce with lychees and pineapple knocked my socks off!  This was an excellent dish (see photo)!  I think I just drooled on my laptop thinking about the sauce.My boyfriend ordered Phad Kee Mao and before he was half way done with it he was talking about returning for lunch this week.  The portions for both dishes were generous, which is a plus.  I was hoping for Thai leftovers for breakfast but my boyfriend is like a Hoover vacuum cleaner and ate every last bite of food, his AND mine!There is a nearby parking lot and as long as you spend $20 they will validate for up to 1 1/2 hours.

Mind you my brother and i has order a plethora of sea urchin, soft shell crab, salmon roe, etc. (which was all delicious!) My brother just wanted hot sake (not an usual request by any stretch) when the bill came she not only charged him $30 for the signature sake but she charged him TWICE!!  While we did order to hot sakes we had no idea that she switched it out for the 'signature' sake!!  Then to top it off she tried justifying it and initially wouldn't remove it from the bill. This back and forth went on for 10 minutes!!!  . Needless to say we have no desire to ever return. All this despite the food being delicious!!"},{"name":"Eddie George's Grille 27","address":"4575-4667 Sawyer Rd","city":"Columbus","stars":"2.5","text":"Took 30 min to receive a basic burger and fries at the \\"to go\\" window which is simply unacceptable.

DO NOT give them your credit/debit card before you order. We did that the first two times then learned our lesson. Every time we visit the server messes up our check and since they run your card before you can review the check you're stuck with the messed up check OR you can get a refund then have the correct charge so you have to wait for the refund to be credited back to you. At one visit two of my 3 kids didn't even get their food until 15 minutes before the end of the movie after we countlessly asked when their food would come. There are also A LOT of hidden charges. Want the wings even though the description says \\"tossed in sauce\\"? That's $1 up charge that you won't see until your bill comes. Want sauce for the chicken strips? That's a $0.50 charge per tiny cup that you won't see until your bill comes. My daughter asked for \\"sweet tea\\". Server says they \\"don't have sweet tea but we have strawberry lemonade!\\" So she ordered that.

The Pepper Lunch chain has finally arrived in Canada. With its first location in Canada in Richmond, this is sure going to be a popular spot. Keep in mind that parking within the London Drugs plaza may be a bit difficult.The shop isn't too big, with seating for around 40 people. We came on a Monday around lunchtime, and it was almost at capacity. You order up front, which can be quite intimidating because they have a lot of different choices and combinations, and sometimes it's hard to read from just a screen on the wall. Being a first timer, I decided to have their signature Beef Pepper Rice, with extra beef. You have the option of making it a combo for an extra $1.50 with miso soup and a drink. We were then given a number which corresponds to a pre-designated table. Water is served at your table. Within minutes, our food arrived. I noticed that mine only had 8 slices of beef, and had to wonder if it was really 'extra' beef. When I inquired, they did indeed say that it was a regular sized one and exchanged a extra beef one for me. 2 sauces are also available, a honey based sauce, or a garlic soy sauce. I prefer the honey sauce. Then comes the 'fun' part, where you mix everything together. The end result is a tasty mix of beef, pepper, corn and green onions within grains of rice. I like that the hot plate kept the whole dish hot, and allowed some of the rice to be a bit crispy. At $11, my lunch was filling and tasty. There's some other items that I would like to try, such as their hamburger patty. PS. You will end up smelling like your lunch afterwards."},{"name":"Fuloon","address":"214 Cabot St","city":"Beverly","stars":"4","text":"I was impressed with the Malden Fuloon years ago, so we tried this one when we happened to be visiting Salem.

Nothing stood out in any way, and I've had these dishes prepared elsewhere, which much better results. The portions were small, and the protein was rationed out in every dish.

We downloaded the app to track our wait time, but it ended up being off by 25 minutes. Luckily, the text system of notifying you when your table is ready works while also providing time to hit the nearby food truck village (pre-meal appetizers) and Salt & Straw (pre-meal dessert). We were almost full by the time we got a seat at Pok Pok. Service was a-ok at best. It's a busy & packed place focused on getting you in & out of the cramped seat as quick as possible. They succeeded in getting us out of our seat quicker than we wanted ... but with time for a 2nd dessert down the street."},{"name":"Chuy's","address":"8123 International Dr","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"How does this place not have 5 stars!!!

Ordered the Dim Sum Samplers - Tasting for Two for $28.88 because we thought we would get more bang for our buck since the prices was already outrageous. What we got was a sad steamed basket of 2 pieces each of the Shiu Mai, Prawn Dumplings, and BBQ Pork Buns(total of 6 pieces for $28.88).  No where in their menu did they mentioned the number of pieces and you would think you get a better deal than ordering these three items individually but completely not.Had we ordered the Shiu Mai($9.88), Prawn Dumplings($9.88), and BBQ Pork Buns($8.88) individually off of their Dim Sum menu, we would have gotten 3 pieces of each item(total of 9 pieces for $28.64.) Somehow when doing the math, it just did not make sense to me why anyone in their right mind would order the Dim Sum Samplers - Tasting for Two for $28.88(6 pcs) and pay more rather than order the Shiu Mai, Prawn Dumplings, and BBQ Pork Buns for $28.64(9 pcs).  When I informed the server about this, he mentioned that the menu is set and that there is nothing he could do about it.  That's when I asked for the manager and although he was able to offer an additional piece of everything, the staff made it seem that we were causing trouble for just pointing out the obvious problem with their menu. They handed us the bill even before the dish of 3 pieces that the manager offered as a resolution arrived and couldn't wait for us to leave. Just before we left, the server checked the receipt in front of us to make sure we included tip which we did more than what was deserving....That was so just really RUDE.Below is my additional ratings and reviews of Red 8.Service 2/10: Everything was unorganized and slow.  We were left waiting after being seated for 15 minutes until our server came to offer us water and another 40 minutes for our food to arrive. We also could not tell who was our server as it was alternated by two different people.Price 1/10: If you are looking to eat here, expect to pay 4-5x what you would for Dim Sum in Chinatown and still get less. At $8.88 for the least expensive Dim Sum dish, I felt that we could have gotten more for the price that we paid. When our meal arrived, we were very disappointed at how little the portion size was. I know 8 is a lucky number in the Chinese culture and they are trying to keep it a theme with their restaurant being inside a gaming establishment but it is kinda taking it too far with these outlandish prices. Quality & Taste: 4/10: Although the food tasted clean(at least cleaner than Dim Sum in Chinatown), it was a little bit on the salty side and we were disappointed also that there were no sauces or condiments on the table or offered to us. The only thing that we somewhat enjoyed was the Hong Kong-style Fried Noodle with Seafood which was $23.88(still not worth it in my opinion for deep-fried noodles covered in corn starch gravy-style sauce with Vegetables, 2 pieces of Shrimp, and a couple of thin slices if Scallops - that's right!!! Slices, not whole Scallops). Lastly, I personally do not think I will be coming back unless I am really desperate.  Save your money and go eat elsewhere. The quality and the portion does not amount to their ridiculous prices."},{"name":"MOOYAH Burgers, Fries & Shakes","address":"199 Boston Rd, Ste 8","city":"North Billerica","stars":"2.5","text":"Killer burgers\\nClean store\\nNot that greasy feeling like some other burger places the fries are crisp not greasy and soggy"},{"name":"Counter Culture","address":"2337 E Cesar Chavez St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"We went here while checking out the PhD programs at UT.

We got there a little under an hour before they closed so I knew we couldn't lounge around and take our time, but I was really in the mood for BBQ. When we walked in we were greeted by, I guess the manager, that was behind the bar (guy with a beard) He was SUPER nice and sat us down and told us our server would be with us shortly. And this is where it went down. Arthur was our server and from the beginning you could tell he wish we hadn't came in so late. Mind you there were 7 other people in the restaurant at the bar. He came and told us they would be closing soon and we needed to order right away. He wasn't really friendly about questions on the menu and this being our first time we weren't that familiar with the items or how things worked and we really felt rushed. About 15 minutes after we ordered, we overheard a couple at the bar ordering food so we didn't need to be rushed as bad as we were. We got our food and he did come back to refill our glasses. He brought our ticket, but I asked it to be seperate so he took it back. I put my card in the check holder right away, but my friend didn't. He came to the table and took my card and said \\"So both tickets on 1 card?\\" and walked away. He didn't even let me answer so I had to yell to him \\"No. Come back\\" We finally paid and we were watching the basketball game (it was 3 minutes left). There are still people at the bar eating, drinking and talking with the 2 employees behind the bar. Arthur goes and sits at the hostess stand by the door and I can tell he is really wanting us to leave. After a while he starts to whistle at the employees behind the bar. They didn't hear him at first. He did it a second time and the customers turned around and looked at him, looked at their watch, looked dead at us and said \\"OOOOO\\" I get up to leave and Arthur, who is sitting at the front door, literally jumps up to get our check. He didn't say goodnight or thanks for coming, he didn't say anything. Now my friend owns a restaurant so we know how this works. If he needed to leave or take our checks he could have simply said \\"hey, do you mind if I close out you guys tab\\" That's why I waited to long. I wanted to see if he would be nice at all. The guy that greeted us at the beginning told us goodnight, but I was so annoyed with Arthur I didn't even turn around. I feel bad lol. I'm sure you want to know about the food. Ribs weren't tender and could be seasoned better. They were really tough. The bbq sauce is watered down with vinegar. Mac N Cheese was really good and the waffle fries were good. I paid $18 for the 1/2 rack of ribs and 2 sides. Moral of the story: Worst service i've had in a while. Definitely won't be back as long as Arthur is there."},{"name":"Pok Pok","address":"3226 SE Division St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Ah, Pok Pok: this is regarded as one of the best food experiences in Portland and just maybe in Oregon. The only reason I heard about this place was from my friend who is from Portland and after that, I started seeing the name \\"Pok Pok\\" EVERYWHERE.Apparently, Pok Pok is only found in Portland and New York. It's a Northern Thai restaurant, meaning that they won't have your typical curry dishes or your pad thai (both of which are more central Thailand food). The only dish that actually has coconut in it (since it's scare in Northern Thailand) is their Tom Kha. So what's great about this place? EVERYTHING! We had the opportunity to try out a number of their dishes. A lot of the waitresses and waiters will keep reiterating that Pok Pok is meant for a shared food experience, and I also echo that. Order a number of dishes and eat it family style. The portion sizes are a bit small for each dish and so it's meant to distribute around the table. If I recall correctly, we got their fish sauce wings, the boar meat, waterfall beef tom kha, the pok pok papaya salad, and cat fish noodles. First of all, the fish sauce wings were amazeballs. There are a number of places in the US that are known for amazing chicken wings (such as San Tung's garlic wings in SF), and Pok Pok's wings definitely rank up there. The sauce wasn't too overwhelming and the wings were cooked perfectly. It's a nice dish to try and I highly recommend it.Second, the Tom Kha was probably one of my favorite parts of our meal. It isn't hard to make a coconut curry soup, but they added the perfect blend of coconut milk and curry in there. The soup was flavorful, not too creamy, and overall delicious. This is another one of those items that you need to share with other people.Third, the waterfall beef and wild boar were tender and SO JUICY. They both taste a bit different and the sauces that are used have some distinctions, but you really do need to try each. We got extra leaves and ice to use with the wild boar because it was apparently spicy - it wasn't. Portion size is small so please be aware of that!The curry catfish was another great dish. It's pretty much vermicelli noodles and catfish in an oily, curry sauce. It comes in a small bowl and works well with a salad or piece of lettuce on the side.Last, we tried the pok pok papaya salad. The menu warns that htis dish is very spicy, but it really isn't if you have any experience with spicy food. Again, portion size is small but very delicious regardless!Don't forget the drinks though! The waitress recommended the non-alcoholic ginger/vinegar drinks and they were splendid. I ordered the black pepper one and it tasted unique with a bit of a kick to it.Overall, Pok Pok is a perfect experience with fine Thai dining. You really don't get many opportunities to try Northern Thai food unless you are actually in Thailand (Chang Mai). The only reason why I give this place 4 stars is because the portion sizes are a bit TOO small for me for the price. Though we ordered a lot, we ended up paying about $30 a person, and I feel like that is a bit much for Thai food.However, you need to check this place out...Eat well and prosper,"},{"name":"Powell's City of Books","address":"1005 W Burnside St","city":"Portland","stars":"5","text":"If you love books, you came to the right place.

We sensed there is a lot on the menu worth highlighting but we were left to guess on our own. We ordered a mojito and the Hemingway's a las rocas, and the Black Bean hummus. 10-15 minutes went by. My wife noticed that the table behind us got same drinks (came in after us). Waiter came by and seemed surprised we did not have drinks. Shrugged shoulders and went to bar. Did not come back with explanation. A few minutes later I got my Hemingway. My wife did not get her mojito for another 5 minutes. Later, the bartender came and asked me if I had ordered a 2nd Hemingway. Nope. Clearly, communication between waiter and bar was not great. We ordered Cubano Sandwich and Lechon Asado. Both were very good. Portion size is quite large so we had leftovers for next day. With the great food, our moods significantly improved. I ordered a 512 Brewery IPA which was cold and tasty.

Totally didn't know what to expect, but for the most part the experience was pleasant. The interior is the same as it was when it was Displace and The Blenheim, with the wood tables, black booths and white walls. Small changes in decorations, like little mirrors that are supposed to be boat windows??? Otherwise, it's pretty much just a different name and menu. The menu seems to be Mexican/Caribbean inspired, with things like Nachos, Burritos, Fajitas ect.  The food was my favorite part of the experience, with huge portions for both the nachos and fajitas. Prices seem a little expensive, but honestly with the portions it's quite fair. Loss of stars come from the service and the drinks. The drinks are a rip off! A classic margarita; 1 ounce, and I dunno how you even make a 1 ounce margarita for $7.50, or 2 ounce for $10. Naturally, I ordered a 2 ounce (if you read my reviews you know I like to taste what I am paying for). My 2 ounce margarita tasted like a 1/2 ounce margarita. I actually thought they messed up the order because my bf ordered a single rum and coke and his you could actually taste the alcohol; the server was certain mine was a double lmao!! Also, service was initially fast, and then died down... We ordered guacamole which was completely forgotten and when our fajitas were delivered the server dropped the sour cream and it went flying all over the floor. I saw at least 5 people walk through it before they cleaned it up. OMG Lol. Oh, and they didn't even pick up the sour cream container it was left under another table (I shoulda said something but....).I was impressed by how well our left overs were packed up. All in all, I would go back, but I think I would go during happy hour and kick it on the patio (hello spring). Just watch out for flying sour cream and remember the nachos is enough for two people as a meal (freaking massive)."},{"name":"Sweet-Stack Creamery","address":"25 Piedmont Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4.5","text":"So glad I had the chance to stop by this addition to the downtown scene!

The wait isn't terrible and the staff are really apologetic and courteous about it. I've been here twice now- the first with a friend and the second with the boyfriend, and both times I've loved the food. The benedicts are good, although the crab cake one was a little dry.

Unfortunately, we left extremely disappointed and $75 poorer due to our vehicle getting booted in the parking lot directly behind their building. The businesses facing South Central Ave. including Fish Bowl Poke, have absolutely no parking aside from maybe 5 spots in the front of the building. This requires everyone to park directly behind the business complex. There are signs designating customer parking for *some* business on this same South Central strip, but Fish Bowl Poke (maybe because they are a relatively new business?) does not have any designated parking spots or any signage informing their customers where to park to avoid booting. Having never visited before, we parked in front of a sign that indicated that spots were for customers visiting businesses of South Central Ave. Upon our return to the parking lot, we quickly (after about 20 minutes it took us to eat our poke bowls) realized our $75 mistake. When we walked out, the man who booted our vehicle was explaining to another customer why he too had been booted. The boot man seemed apologetic and said there have been a lot of complaints against the businesses facing South Central Ave due to the deceptive signage that indicates parking is available to customers of businesses within the address of 636 South Central Ave. He said it is commonly assumed that 636 is the address of the entire complex facing South Central Ave, but in reality it is one specific suite number in that complex. I don't think this is entirely the fault of South Central Ave businesses, but I do think the owners of these businesses should take an active interest in safeguarding their business reputations by providing proper signage so their customers (especially first time guests) know where they should and should not park. As a side note, I did go back into Fish Bowl Poke to inform them that I had been booted and I was told that while there is no visible parking designation for their establishment, the 2 hour parking spaces are the correct spots to park in. But how are customers supposed to know this without proper signage designating spots or lots as the \\"correct\\" place to park?!It's unfortunate because this could have been another 5 star experience, but I don't feel good about not speaking out to let others know (since Fish Bowl Poke has failed to do it) to ONLY park in spots indicating 2 hour parking. This was an expensive mistake, but one I could have avoided with the help of a simple sign. I'm sure the other customer who was booted feels the same way. Unfortunately for Fish Bowl Poke, unless they come up with a solution, this probably won't be their last one star review due to their customers getting booted. I hope this review saves someone else $75 or at least prompts Fish Bowl Poke to provide signs in the back lot designating where their customers are allowed to park."},{"name":"Starbucks","address":"44 Main St","city":"Wayland","stars":"3.5","text":"If I could give this place a zero for a rating I would.

They also have wraps and salads and stuff, and just takeout chickens, but honestly - for the the chicken - I'd just go to HEB or whole foods for like half the price.

Also, they had four salsas, and two were just meh.  The jalapeno ranch was good and there was another one that was decent, but I remember one was just not good.Being critical of those two staples, everything else was pretty darn top notch.

The manager was nice enough to reply to my Yelp review and clue me in to the fact one was weeks away from opening in Austin.I waited patiently. Opening dates were delayed, I stalked their instagram feed, and called on more than one occasion to check dates.Well, I was finally able to head over on Friday - and what a relief!!  It was around 4pm on a Friday and the restaurant was bustling, but not packed.  The bar area was barren so I headed over.  I already knew what i wanted to eat, so I negotiated with the Jamie (awesome bartender) on a drink.  I noticed they had St. Germaine and he promised to whip me up something.  He came back with a cucumber/vodka/St. Germaine heavenly concoction.  Very drinkable and refreshing - I had to hold myself back and remember there was a double shot of alcohol in it.  The waitstaff behind the bar was pretty considerable and everyone took a few moments to chat about my food options, the menu, the drinks, and just how enjoyable it was for them to finally be open.  Really, these guys were genuine and kind.  I had actually put some effort in to my appearance on this day, so I'm not sure if they could just tell a girl was trying too hard, or they're just awesome folks! ¬Ø\\\\_(ÔøΩ?_/¬Ø  I'll take it either way, and I'll be back for more.  Btw, the entire waitstaff is very attractive here....something is in the water.I opted for the Edamame Dumplings; gorgeous, light, buttery pillows in a superb sauce that I left no remnants of.  I ate all the dumplings, all on my own.  Second up was the Spicy Thai Curry - for me curry is where TFK is the all-star, and this was no exception.  A perfect balance of spice and coconut milk with the freshest veggies.  I do prefer their Panang curry (not on the menu here); the way they choose to plate/present here put me off a bit.  I had to add rice to the curry dish - without a separate \\"mixing dish\\" and really without the right broth/rice ratio (the panang curry is served all in one bowl, perfect balance of ingredients). The veggies were cut a little large - especially given the plating choice.  But, we're just getting nit-picky there.  Did I finish it all, yes.  Overall the caliber of the service, the food, and the ambiance leave me a loyal True Food Kitchen fan.  Hands down still my favorite all around restaurant and will be a consistent go-to.

You can marinate your chicken or beef there as well, but it takes about 10 minutes so if you plan on doing that definitely call your order in in advance.

I bet she was a manager or something.  I liked her service because she explained a couple of different ways to eat the appetizer and even let us know we may want to request a hot towel to clean up a little so we would have garlic fingers.  The dish was fantastic.  You just can't go wrong with roasted garlic and goat cheese.Each one of the five of us ordered something different, and each of us had great things to say.

I'm a true blue Texas gal and my family makes the best garlic cheese grits in the state, so it's not easy impress me with this dish.  Well done.  The sandwich was bigger than my head and quite good.

One such song (and one of my all-time favorites): \\"Dunk\\" by Noiseshaper.* modern, yet farm-to-table / open-concept, yet comfy-cozy ambiance & decor* the food (obviously) - let's talk...I came here for dinner tonight to meet a long-time friend from Chicago, for whom I'd actually nannied during my days living and studying in the northern lakeside suberbs. Her mom had mentioned she was a \\"foodie,\\" but I still wasn't sure what to expect. For starters, I was blown away by the quality on every level of this restaurant. It was BEAUTIFUL. (And I am not easily impressed - especially if the only thing a restaurant has going for it is its decor [think many high-brow restaurants in Washington D.C. who mistakingly prioritize ambiance above food quality].) Yet, the decor here is noteworthy since it wasn't the main attraction - the food rightfully was - although it perfectly complemented the food, as an apt wine pairing can also do, and thus the decor was an enjoyable experience. Music: basically all my favorites (and I'm very picky / precise with my musical taste).The food: let's be honest - this is why we're here.Raw Bar Starter: \\n\\"Halibut Ceviche* pickled grape, cucumber, scallion, lime\\" - yum.Main Courses (x2):\\nI ordered the \\"Bone In New Bedford Monkfish: mustard spaetzle, grilled onion, ICOB tasso ham\\" - our server was right, it does resemble lobster! And it was fabulous. SOOOOO good. And yes, I waited to google what a Monkfish actually looks like until after I ate it. Will do now (and am preparing for shock & horror).My dining companion ordered (and I sampled): \\"Grilled Faroe Island Salmon: saffron rice, cucumber, almond, spiced yogurt\\" - beautifully prepared and delicious.Dessert (x2):\\n\\"Carrot Cake: burnt caramel ice cream, walnuts\\" - so this was a disappointment, and I definitely don't recommend. If you've ever had any derivation of caramel at Bi-Rite Creamery or Humphry Slocombe in San Francisco and you're thinking \\"ooh! burnt caramel! i think i might love that!\\" No. Just no. No, you won't. I'm sorry.\\"Banoffee Pie: dulce de leche, banana\\" - YESSS. Get *this* one. Yes, this is the best. I'm not even going to fully describe it other than say that it's almost ineffable. Banana Toffee, and I don't even love bananas. Or toffee, for that matter. Graham cracker crust. Yummy, comfort.

It was very fresh and I loved the attention to detail with peppers and microgreens on the plate. The teeny tiny fried garlic pieces were a nice touch and added a surprising amoung of flavor. It was a fairly small portion but very delicious. We also shared a spicy tuna roll, which was deliciosMy boyfriend had the sake nigiri (as he does anywhere), but said it was the best he's had in Atlanta. I splurged on the O-Toro signature nigiri, which is listed at market price and ended up being around $20 for 2 pieces that night but it was WORTH IT. The tuna is so tender and the dijon mustard is a perfect compliment to the fatty texture of the fish. It basically melted in my mouth.We paired our sushi with a nice riesling. Nothing special about it, but it held up well to the sushi and was fairly priced compared to the rest of their wine menu.

The brand opened its first Georgia location on Buford Highway in Doraville on April 16, 2018. You can find it in Pinetree Plaza in between Bo Bo Garden and I-CE NY.I've tried several desserts. While all the desserts looked great, only a couple really tasted great while the rest were just okay. My drink was average at best. Service was terrific. These guys were speedy.Like many of the Asian bakeries, cafes, and dessert shops that have opened in the Atlanta area over the last several years, Mango Mango has a cute and aesthetically-pleasing design. The shop is clean and modern-looking with tables, a banquette, and counter seating. It's a bit on the small side with capacity for approximately 36 (guesstimate). At this place, you stand in line, order upfront (one register), and your order is brought to your table when it's ready.Free Wi-Fi is available. The password is ilovemango.The menus are well-made, sturdy, spiral-bound books with helpful high-quality photographs of just about every item. No digital displays, wall menus, or anything like that.Mango Mango offers a wide variety of dessert bowls featuring ingredients like mango and other fresh fruit like durian (one of the rare dessert shops in Atlanta that actually serves real fresh-cut durian) and pomelo, shaved ice and juices, ice cream, herbal (grass) jelly, red beans, basil seeds, sago (spongy pearls similar to tapioca), black rice, glutinous rice balls, and more.  These bowls are priced at $6.50 to $8 each.In addition to dessert bowls, there are similarly priced ice cream sundaes and a waffle ice cream sandwich, mango and durian \\"pancakes\\" (not pancakes in the traditional American sense; these are more like dense, snack-sized treats), panna cotta, mochi, crepes, cakes, custard, and more. Pre-set combos are available which allow you to save a couple dollars on multiple items. For example, Mango Mango Combo B gets you two different mango dessert bowls and mango pancakes for $18.50. If you ordered them all separately, it'd be $20.50.There are various soups (e.g. black sesame, walnut, and almond paste soups, black rice soup with dried longan and dates; $5.50 to $7 each), waffles and crepes prepared with fresh fruit and ice cream ($8 to $8.45 each), a variety of hot teas served by the teapot ($4.50 each), and fruit \\"Slush-Os\\" (slushes, starting at $5 each).Here's what I tried:* A5. Strawberry mango juice sago & lychee jelly with mango ice cream ($7)\\n* A21. Durian dessert bowl ($8)\\n* I01. Mango sundae ($6.50)\\n* I05. Triple ice cream delight ($6) - green tea, vanilla, and mango with chocolate syrup\\n* S5. Mango mille cake ($7.50)\\n* S6. Mango platter (dine-in only) ($8.45)\\n* D1. Snow White mango Slush-O ($5)And here's how I'd categorize them:Terrific (my favorites and recommendations):\\n- Durian dessert bowl\\n- Mango mille cakeI know durian isn't for everyone. A lot of people are turned off by it's stinky smell. Unlike stinky tofu (another smelly, but popular Asian food), I actually like durian. If you step inside Mango Mango and wonder what the off-putting, funky aroma is, it's probably durian. Durian actually has a unique and pleasant taste. In the durian dessert bowl, Mango Mango cuts up the durian and serves it with durian ice cream (yum), sliced banana, basil seeds, and herbal jelly. It's good.The mango mille cake was excellent. Mille cakes are like crepe cakes. They have many soft, appetizing, and delicate layers. In addition to the mango mille cake, Mango Mango also has durian and green tea mille crepes. The mango mille cake I tried had fresh and ripe cubes of mango and lots of mango sauce. The fluffy cake, which was almost like many layers of pancake, was easily the best part.Good (worth ordering):\\n- Strawberry mango juice sago & lychee jelly with mango ice cream\\n- Mango platterThe strawberry mango juice sago & lychee jelly with mango ice cream looked amazing. Unfortunately, it didn't taste as good as it looked. I found this dessert to be too sweet, mainly because of the mango juice and mango ice cream. The lychee jelly was my favorite part.The mango platter is also eye-appealing. It contains a small bowl of mango mochi and chopped mango, another bowl with rice balls, mango, and mango juice, and another bowl with mango ice cream and lychee jelly. It's a nice little trio.Ehh... (not bad, but I don't really recommend these):\\n- Mango sundae\\n- Triple ice cream delight\\n- Snow White mango Slush-OWhile the mango sundae and triple ice cream delight weren't bad, I didn't think they were anything special or brought anything new to the table. However, if you want ice cream, they should suffice. The Snow White mango Slush-O has real mango on top. Like one of the desserts above, I thought this drink was too sweet. Currently, I still prefer the mango drinks at Cafe Mangosix."},{"name":"Caf√© Luna","address":"612 Main St","city":"Cambridge","stars":"4","text":"There was an hour wait my first time going here but the food was totally worth it!

Therefore, I do have more- than-average patience when popular restaurants have long wait times and I'm generally willing to wait when the food is supposed to be amazing.My boo and I showed up at Pok Pok on a summer Wednesday, late afternoon. The place is pretty much empty. There are a few patrons waiting, seated outside. We are quoted a 1 hour wait. I'm somewhat shocked by this, but we understand that even at 4pm on a Wednesday, this place is popular and surely has many reservations already set. Plus, we are heathens without one, so we don't fuss and grab a seat on a nearby bench. After about 25 minutes, literally no one else has shown up for a table. There are 3-4 other groups next to us waiting. When I go to find the restroom, I'm filled with fury (I take my wings seriously y'all), to find there is another indoor room that is also empty, save for 2-3 tables.We wait 45 minutes and still, the place is empty and we haven't been seated. If they'd sat us right away, we probably could have eaten and left in that time period. Is this some kind of ruse!? Like the kind nightclubs use to make their empty nightclubs seem popular? If you make everyone wait in a long line behind the velvet rope, your shit seems pretty hot. Generally, restaurants with long waits are filled with people. Not in Pok Pok's case, apparently.We left a still vacant Pok Pok after waiting an hour to the nearby Kati for delicious Thai food. The locals we chatted with throughout our time in Portland argued that Pok Pok is indeed overrated, so we didn't waste our time trying to go back.

This visit was for breakfast and for a Sunday morning at 11, the wait for 2 was decent at 15 minutes. During past trips to Brother's I've ordered Greek meals (mousaka) and lunch food (burger and steak tips), both of which were better than average. This time I ordered a bacon and cheese omelette served with homefries and wheat toast. I also added a single buttermilk pancake on the side. It was your average breakfast fare. The omelette was well-prepared and luckily wasn't very greasy, although I didn't appreciate the american cheese which brought the taste down significantly. Bacon was wrapped around the omelette, a nice touch. Home fries were average, a bit dry and not very crunchy. The pancake was good, although again the Aunt Jemima syrup brought the taste down significantly. I'd stick with butter on the pancake to enjoy it. The staff and ambiance were decent. Waitress was fast and attentive, always refilling our coffee. Next time I think I'll continue up the highway to Red's until I have a bad experience there, then float back to Brother's.

We were seated and I would guesstimate that it took about 10 minutes for anyone to come to our table to take our drink order. I saw other waitresses walk by and roll their eyes as I assume they could tell we were not being waited on and that we were getting frustrated. I was with a group of four, and my friends ordered their tea's and soda's or whatever they got, and I loosely recall ordering something from the bar... Maybe a margarita? I don't know what it was at this point. Our waitress brought their drinks by quite some time after we ordered, and then disappeared again for a while. She eventually came back to take our order (I still didn't have my drink at this point.. after being seated for probably 30 minutes by then) and disappeared again. Some time later, three meals were dropped off at our table--and before I could even ask where mine was, she was gone again. I had no food, and no drink, and my friends insisted that they would not eat their food until I got mine. At that point, I was starting to get more than a little frustrated, and for good reason. Their food was going to be cold and gross by the time we got my situation straightened out. I got a manager involved and she was very compassionate and apologetic, which I very much appreciated, but I don't understand what was going on to allow this to happen to begin with. She took care of our meals and made sure that mine did eventually come out along with my drink, but I think it was a little too late at that point to salvage this experience at Chuy's.I don't know what was going on with our waitress. I'm still not sure why I left her a $20 tip for her terrible service, but hopefully there was a good reason why our service was so awful that night... and if not, I hope she's looking for another way to pay her bills.I'm not sure that I'd consider going back on my next trip to Orlando. While I appreciate the management taking care of the tab, I would have appreciated being able to eat with my friends and paying for the meal too. It was probably a fluke, but the food and drink wasn't very good as I ended up finding out. I didn't even eat most of my fajitas because I was so ticked off at that point."},{"name":"Powell's City of Books","address":"1005 W Burnside St","city":"Portland","stars":"5","text":"If you go down the long list of reviews for Powell's Books (5 stars), you will be hard pressed to find a negative rating. When a bookstore has such amazing reviews, you know you have to stop by when in Portland.So what's so grand about Powell's? Uhm, EVERYTHING?! First off, Powell's Books is basically a 4-5 story bookstore with both new and used books. You can definitely come here to sell your used books for cash and buy new ones as well. On top of that there's plenty of nonbook gift items spread throughout the entire store if you are here to buy souvenirs as well as a coffee shop inside.One of the many cool things at Powell's is that the store is divided into sections and coded by colors. For example, you have one are specifically designed for games, another for rare books, and even one for children's. I'd have to say that I got lost a number of times just trying to find one area.Of course if you are on social media you have probably seen the famous purple steps with a fancy quote concerning all the famous self-established writers. It's somewhere in the middle and you can find it if you navigate towards the purple room.My all time favorite part of this store is definitely the rare book room on the top floor. Anyone can get in if you get the pass from the desk. Inside there is a huge collection of rare books that have been bought by the store over the years. I believe the oldest one they have is a 1400 or so Jewish book that was published 20 years after the printing press.All in all, Powell's books deserves the hype it gets. If you are into reading or just love exploring new places, this is it for you and nothing more.Have fun and prosper,"},{"name":"The Meatball Stoppe","address":"7325 Lake Underhill Rd","city":"Orlando","stars":"4.5","text":"Great place!

We live in the neighborhood and have been regulars at most the local food joints and bars so decided to test this one out. Our first order was for the pan pizza extra cheese, add feta. We noted on the board that it took 30 minutes to cook so we ordered and went next door for drinks. We came back and we're handed a suspiciously large box which we opened in the restauarnt as it already looked wrong. What we saw was a burnt thin crust pie, no extra cheese (which we were charged for anyway), and cold feta thrown on top AFTER the pizza had cooked. We turned around and asked the guy immediately what this was as it did not look like our pizza? He insisted it was and we told him we ordered a deep dish pan pizza, he said oh I guess I misunderstood cuz all pizzas are pan (I don't even know how to process that one). He seemed very \\"meh\\" but asked if we wanted them to cook another one. It was now 10 minutes to close, we were hungry, and we aren't jerks so said no, but would have been nice to get offered some kind of credit. Get home and realize the bottom of the pizza is also burnt (not to mention chewy), this pizza was HARD to eat, actually making your jaw a little sore trying to chew through the burn cheese and dough. The crust was completely inedible, so cracker hard, looking at it wrong made it explode into pizza dust. Meanwhile my boyfriend is grumbling the entire time he's eating it about how much he not only hated it but how much he paid to hate it.  We decide to try again one last time about a week later and actually get the pan pizza we ordered the first time (which is more expensive). We order and again go to a bar on the same block, where we are regulars, and chat with the bartender who tells us how old the pizza looked when he went in and he had not had the courage to go back yet, but let him know how it is! We get a box again this time about half the size of the previous box (so when viewing pictures imagine the smaller pizza is also in a much smaller box). I pick it up and am immediately suspicious, it weighs almost nothing. =_=Open the box and this more expensive but significantly smaller pizza takes up maybe 1/2-2/3 the box so is sliding around free balling it in the box. This one also had cold feta thrown on top not cooked with the pizza. Plus it looks like someone picked off a bubble after cooking maybe, as there is a large spot of dry dough on one side. It tasted better than its predecessor but also no extra cheese and unreasonably small for the price. Plus square cut, so some pieces have no cheese at all, as all the cheese had congealed in the center. So to conclude, we ate our tiny pizza, went back to the bar for pretzels and drinks, showed pictures to the bar tenders on duty and made faces at this terrible series of pizza events. Why would you go here when Sparky's sells infinitely better slices across the street and Sizzle Pie is a couple blocks away and Babydoll a little past that... all far superior options. Just don't do it."},{"name":"Clay Oven Indian Cuisine","address":"7696 W Irlo Bronson Memorial Hwy","city":"Kissimmee","stars":"3.5","text":"Great Indian cuisine - you will not be disappointed in the quality of the food!

And because I grew up in Houston, those expectations are pretty high, so take this review with a grain of salt. When I go to most restaurants, I do a quick scan of the customers and see what the customers are like, which gives me a gauge on the kind of food the restaurant serves. About 3/4ths of the customers that day were non-Asian which, to me, was not a positive sign of how good the \\"authentic\\" Chinese food would be. Maybe the BBQ pork, sweet and sour chicken, and fried rice would be good, but my desired Chinese family style dishes might not be. Aaaand...those expectations proved to be true. The salt-and-pepper pork was tough and over-battered. The sauteed water spinach was okay to good, but I don't think I've been to a Chinese restaurant that could mess up that dish.

Management staffs this location at dangerously low levels. Be cautious of spending your money here, you will not feel it's worth. In all cases, I tipped my servers as they deserve a living wage. By and large they are not the problem; if only there were more of them. I have visited this location three times since it opened (I think in March or early April of 2019). My first visit, for Avengers: Endgame, was mediocre. The service was inconsistent as each in my party of three received their food at very different times and servers were attempting to talk to Guests about their checks during the climax of the film. After an apologetic manager and understanding the infant state of the location, I was fine attempting another visit. Especially since the food was decent. My second visit, for Aladdin, was worse. Quite slow service, but clearly the theater was understaffed. The food was much lower quality as well, coming out room temperature at best. Given the speed of the service, most guests knew if they sent their food back, it would not return. We paid our checks and left after the movie. Because of a ticket mix up with a friend, I had a ticket for myself to see Pok√©mon: Detective Pikachu tonight at 7:15pm. Because of a service shortage, they did not open our theater for seating until 7:12pm (they didn't announce this, just barred any Guest with a ticket for the film from going past the lobby area). Under their breath, the two ushers taking tickets confusedly discussed why the theater was now open with no servers assigned to it. Once seated, I immediately rang the service button just to see how long it would take (not my first rodeo). A server arrived surprisingly quickly and I placed my drink and food order. They finished with taking orders about 15 minutes into the film. The drinks came halfway through the film. The food came as the credits rolled. Not only did I have to eat my cold fried shrimp in broad daylight, I then had to wait in line to pay my check. No offer for compensation, no apologies. Just one lonely waiter doing the best she could. Management staffs this location at dangerously low levels. Be cautious of spending your money here, you will not feel it's worth. In all cases, I tipped my servers as they deserve a living wage.

My wife and I were first time visitors to Boston and we heard from friends and family this was a good bar to stop at prior to the game. I must say it did live up to the hype.We got there about 3pm and waited about 45 minutes for a table; not that big a deal as we were okay with grabbing some beers at one of the bars while we waited.  We just got some Shandy's and some appetizers (boneless bbq wings and nachos) all of which was VERY GOOD!!All in all it's a great sports bar right outside a great baseball stadium. Being an avid Cubs fan and Wrigleyville tycoon the vibe in Yawkeyville is very similar to that of Wrigley.

Austin\\"Austin does Mexican and BBQ the best, you have to eat it when you're down here\\"Well, guess what? I've had amazing Mexican in Salt Lake City, and I've had great BBQ in California.... and, I would say that more then half of all the BBQ and Mexican places in Austin are terrible.This stereotype goes the other way as well, \\"Austin does BBQ and Mexican. They don't do Chinese\\"Are cities limited to only two specialties? This is a ridiculous assumption we're all guilty of... and it needs to stop! On my last trip to San Fransisco (I've heard it's one of the Chinese food capitals) I searched Yelp.com for the highest rated Chinese food in town... we went, it was amazing. Din Ho in Austin? \\"It couldn't possibly be good! I mean, Austin only does BBQ and Mexican!\\" Well, I would say my Din Ho experience was just as good as my San Fransisco experience...Yeah, that's right... i just said it. Din Ho is amazing. Every bite was delicious. I would argue that  you could place Din Ho in any city in the country and it would be successful. Forget about the idea that \\"Chinese in Austin sucks\\" and go into Din Ho expectation-free, you'll come out happy. Stop comparing Din Ho to some mythical Chinese place you ate at one time 5 years ago... I promise, it's not as good as you remember. Get the idea out of your head of some dish you had... you've just built it up in your head over the years. Forget about it.. and just enjoy Din Ho.  Don't be hard on yourself Austin. Don't give into the stereotype that \\"Austin doesn't do Chinese well\\"....

Well at least for in-restaurant dining for me.  Finale is biased against diners without company and that notion was well impressed upon me last night.  Which is too bad, because as someone who very much enjoys eating dinner on her own, I will tip very generously if the service is good.  And generally, the establishments that I am patronizing do not have an issue with single diners.  But sadly, I cannot say the same for Finale.I said: \\"One for dinner, please\\", and the \\"hostess\\" (who was really a water girl in hostess's shoes) looked around with a confused expression on her face and said \\"Well, I guess you are getting a table for four!\\" Okay, so there were no deuces available - but I spotted two parties of two paying or readying themselves to leave.  A proper hostess would not seat an individual at a 4-top in the middle of the dinning room without first asking \\"I'm sorry I don't have a small table at the moment - would you prefer to wait just a few minutes while one opens up, or will a larger table be alright?\\"  I watched the manager greet incoming customers after me with an air of Welcome, so happy to see you and What can I do for you today? - where the hell was he when I sat down? Strike one.As I sat at this table for 4 floating in the middle of the dining room, I picked my wine and entr√©e and closed my menu, to wait for my server.  Two minutes.  Three minutes.  After about 5 minutes my server, Eric, finally came by and asked, trying for politeness but never quite getting past insulting: \\"So are you still waiting for the other person or did you want to start without them?\\" To which I replied \\"I told the hostess it's just me.\\"  Then he said \\"Oh, Okay\\" - and left without taking my drink order.   All you servers out there, listen closely:  Do not assume.  The worst thing you can do to yourself - and your tip - is alienate your customer.  Furthermore, why didn't the idiot \\"hostess\\" tell my server that it was just one in my party?    Strike two.When I was served water - which I asked for with no ice due to very sensitive teeth - a deuce had just been cleared (but not wiped) and I ask to please move there. No problem.  The server put my water glass down but did not wipe the table, which I had to ask him to do.  Then he set my glass down - but didn't bring silverware or a napkin until the meal was served.  The wine took another 7-8 minutes and there were, at most, 5 other patrons that could be ordering drinks.  Eric set my glass of wine in front of me with an apologetic look on his face , then turned around to suck up to the rude Italian family next to me, who kept putting their hands on my table and were talking obnoxiously loud.  I got a water refill, chock full of ice, and damn if I had to repeat myself: No ice.  Dinner arrived, which was delicious (and the only reason for anything better than 1 star in this review): sweet potato lasagna, perfectly portioned, with a spinach salad.  After the obnoxious, loud family left, I was able to actually enjoy my meal and my wine and my book with few interruptions from Eric.  But when I finished, he did not bring me the dessert menu or even ask if I wanted to see it.  I just got the check dumped on the table.  TOO BAD.  I was considering a glass of port and something sweet, which would have added a good $10-15 to his bill and a bit more to his already less-than-stellar tip.  His loss.  I got my dessert at the counter and kept the change.  No port.  No upsell for him.  No encouraging his customer to stay and enjoy the course for which Finale is best known.  STRIKE THREE.I am pretty appalled but I am not going to stop enjoying nice meals on my own.  I just won't ever be doing it at Finale again."},{"name":"Maizal RMF","address":"2815 Main Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4.5","text":"I was already planning to go to Sal Y Limon, but my bus took forever to come and I decided to go here instead.

Haven't been to the Buford location in forever due to all the pigeons that were always surrounding the place.  Other than that, I always liked their food so was thrilled when this was located close to work.Pho is one of the best hang over cures, quick and easy bite or slurp, and good for those rainy cold days.  Pho is scarce in Buckhead so I don't doubt that it will do well, but it definitely comes with a hefty price.  With tip, I'm paying almost double of what I would at Buford hwy so personally, I would stick to Buford Hwy.As for the food, it's still as great as I remembered.  I do see that the portion looks a bit bigger to match the price, but I rather pay less and eat smaller portion.  Service was good, but the food came out so slow that I wondered if they got our orders delivered from the Buford location lol.  I see that the decor, service, ambiance, and everything is more fitting for Americans that are not as adventurous to go to Buford Hwy for international food.  Oh and they do skimp out on the garnishes as there's no cilantro and the long herb that I don't know the name of.  Maybe they'll add it later, but don't forget to order yourself FREE jasmine tea!  It was quite different from other jasmine tea and had a sweet barley taste.Side note:\\nThe front signage of Pho Viet looks foreign due to the font that they have chosen and can only tell by the wording on the bottom that states Vietnamese Restaurant."},{"name":"Powell's City of Books","address":"1005 W Burnside St","city":"Portland","stars":"5","text":"When in Portland, go to Powells!

BUT THEY LIVED UP TO THEIR HYPE they were amazing and so so so so delicious. A little on the pricey side (6 wings for $15?) but well worth it in our opinion. It also filled us up for not being too hungry. The flavor: It was definitely on the salty side but well-balanced. Also had a nice Asian zing that made it sweet. Was different than any other salty/sweet chicken wings I've ever had and was definitely the BEST. We also added spice since we looooove spicy  you can taste the fish sauce as well but we're Asian so we love that taste anyways  I can see how eating more than 6 can seem overwhelming and a little bit too salty for ones tastebuds."},{"name":"Island Creek Oyster Bar","address":"500 Commonwealth Ave","city":"Boston","stars":"4.5","text":"The final food destination for our Boston trip was at Island Creek Oyster Bar. My friends, boyfriend, and I came just before 5PM and got seated immediately. I really liked the ambiance because it was chic, modern, had high ceilings, and just feels very cozy and spacious.We started with some drinks and light appetizers. My friends ordered the Crispy oyster sliders on a brioche bun and lime chili aioli. I didn't eat any of it or the raw oysters since I am simply not a fan of oysters. We had the Fried Ipswich clams as well which was way way way cheaper than what we had at Neptune Oyster (the night before). The fried clams were crisp perfection, but not as juicy as the ones from Neptune. We also had the fried calamari which was pretty tasty and I wanted to try the roasted crimini mushrooms, but they were mediocre. It didn't really taste like it was roasted, more like it was bathed in a bath of butter and oil.We also ordered the lobster bisque, which was absolutely lobster bisque heaven! It was bright, warm, inviting, and had rich lobster flavors and juices.We also couldn't pass up the opportunity of ordering a lobster roll. The lobster roll was made differently compared to the one from Neptune Oyster. The lobster roll was served cold and with mayonnaise which I much prefer over butter.We asked our waiter to have the lobster roll cut in four sections so we can split it evenly among the four of us.  It was extremely yummy and worth the $28.00. It was also accompanied with cole slaw and the kettle chips.Finally, the last item we had was the Lobster Roe noodles which is a highly recommended dish at Island Creek Oyster Bar. It's cooked with braised short rib, grilled lobster, oyster mushooms, and Pecorino. It was absolutely beautiful, the way it's plated and an interesting dish. This is definitely something I haven't found in New York City restaurants yet. It's also a little expensive ($36.00 to be exact), but I guess if you're sharing it with other people then that's okay.Overall, I think we all prefer Island Creek Oyster Bar much more. We didn't have to wait five hours for a seat and we didn't feel squished or rushed. The entire experience was great and relaxing. It feels very laid back here and I would definitely come back again when we return to Boston."},{"name":"Torchys Tacos","address":"166 Hargraves Dr, Ste J-100","city":"Austin","stars":"2.5","text":"I ordered a brush fire, trailer park and Republican taco.

Not sure if their regular guac maker was out sick but it seemed like it was the girl that made ours had never made guacamole before. What she gave us was basically mashed up avocado with no seasoning. Not even a squeeze of lime. The chicken fajitas I ordered didn't taste freshly made and once again lacking big flavor. The beans that came with it had a strange purple tint to them that I didn't altogether trust. Would've much preferred some classic black beans. My daughter did like her chicken quesadilla and the salsa bar was sort of interesting with its varied options, so it wasn't an entirely bad experience. I just miss the old zip and zing that Margaritas' food had. Maybe they'll improve as they go along, I guess we'll see.

We had ordered a pasta dish - and I specifically asked for the marinara sauce not to be placed on top of the pasta as it would make it soggy. And you guessed it...the pasta dish showed up with marinara on top. It was a Christmas dinner we were hosting and I didn't want to get upset or bothered. But I was embarrassed. The individual lasagnas was a hit with the family. So were the meatballs. Most recently we went to the Meatball Stoppe and we ordered a bucket of balls and a few other items.

My girlfriend (who is a fan) coaxed me into trying this Bexley location to see if I would change my mind, and I did...for the most part. I still think the franchise is a bit overrated and overpriced, given that it's essentially a Chipotle for Mediterranean food, but looking past the hype and the relative price, the food is indeed good, and the atmosphere of *this* location, at least, is much more conducive to sitting down and enjoying a meal.On this occasion, I wound up getting a falafel \\"sandwich\\" with various greens, pita chips, hummus and special sauce, while my girlfriend had the brisket with similar fixings, and we shared an order of French fries. The fries were admittedly excellent -- crispy, savory, and rich -- and my falafel sandwich was great as well. I've been on a bit of a falafel kick this year, as my girlfriend makes it every few weeks, and this falafel was definitely very good. I also appreciate that it was made to order, meaning that it didn't have time to get soggy; I was happy to wait a few minutes for it to arrive. I still don't understand the purpose of the metal rings that hold the sandwiches, because the paper inevitably gets all bunched up by the time you're halfway through eating, and it forces you to have to pull off pieces of the pita, rather than use a knife and fork...but this is a quibble more than a serious criticism. All told, this location of Brassica does a good job at the important parts -- the food, service, and atmosphere -- though there's still a part of me that thinks that more ado is made of it than necessary. Of course, that's not going to stop me from returning the next time I have a hankering for a good pita, so take it as you will..."},{"name":"WAVE Asian Bistro & Sushi","address":"301 N Baker St, Ste 106","city":"Mount Dora","stars":"4.5","text":"Had dinner there last night which was a Wednesday.

Also coined as \\"Calimari Cafe,\\" this place specializes in both its namesake, especially their black ink squid pasta.  Armed with one chef, one dishwasher/busboy and one waiter, this place is surprisingly efficient in serving everyone.The fried calimari has the look, flavor and texture of fresh rubber bands, but the squid ink pasta was PHENOMENAL.  I was lucky to be in a dinner group of 3 where we got to try each flavor of pasta (alfredo, putanesca, and anglio olio).  The chalkboard description of the alfredo sauce is a lie - there's WAY MORE than a pat of butter in that super thick yet deliciously flavorful sauce.  Nevertheless it's the best alfredo sauce I've ever had in a mom-and-pop Italian eatery.  The anglia olio flavor with olive oil and roasted garlic was the most well-balanced of flavorfuls and was good to mix with the alfredo pasta to cut the richness or with the puttanesca to cut it salty brininess.  The appetizer pasta portions is plentiful if you have other appetizers.  Don't know if you want the full portions as it is served off the pan it's cooked in.The place probably sits no more than 20 snugly at a time, so be prepared to wait a long while for a seat.

Seeing how I'm starving for this food, I'd expect it to blow my mind away. The food was good, but definitely not worth the wait.I had my heart set on the Kung Op Wun Sen seeing all of its glowing reviews on yelp, but they were out- my group ended up spending half an hour to decide what to order because we couldn't figure out the differences between each dishes because there 1) aren't any pictures on their menu, and 2) there aren't any picture on yelp other than the Kung Op Wun Sen and the Fish Sauce Chicken Wings. I would definitely recommend Yelp remove some chicken wing photos- it's the same thing a thousand times.\\nInstead, I got the Tom Yam Kung Naam Khon. It was a bit too spicy to enjoy, and the flavors were so strong that you had to pay the $3.5 for rice to balance out (which is absurd for any asian establishment to charge for plain jasmine rice.) My table and I shared an order of the Ike's Vietnamese Sauce Chicken wings, and they were definitely unique and worth a try- a bit too salty and since I'm not the biggest fan of fish sauce, I stopped eating it after one chicken wing. Also, the water somehow tasted and smelled like watered down coconut water.The restaurant has seats indoors and outdoors, and they were able to accommodate for our large group, but it was off to the side, so it was difficult to get a waitress's attention. For the bathroom note, for an establishment that charges so much for rice, I expected better bathrooms. They're located deep in the back of the restaurant, so while you're waiting in a cramped space for bathroom to open up, you're in the way of workers as they transport food and dirty dishes."},{"name":"De Dutch","address":"60-1055 Canada Place","city":"Vancouver","stars":"3.5","text":"So quaint and cute!

So far my experiences have been more about education than socializing. The owner David is a sommelier who enjoys passing on his knowledge to eager participants. He is very laid back and uses an unpretentious approach to his teaching. He encourages everyone's involvedment regardless of knowledge level. The format or wines largely depend on the type of class you attend. I do like that he takes an opportunity to mix it up, bringing in both new and old world wines to showcase their differences. Inside the space is very minimalistic and industrial, matching its surrounding neighborhood. With cement walls and floors, a large wooden bar and a communal table its layout is still inviting, which welcomes interaction. Besides wine classes Red Slate can offer a venue for small events or gathering's. Another worthy mention is that it's right next door to Olympic Provisions!

Not very friendly and she was hardly ever around. My wife wanted me to bring her home something but I couldn't even get my waitresses attention after my food was brought out, because she never even bothered to check up on me. I ended up having to place the take-out part of the order through another waitress. And then it was one of those instances that when you were finally able to get the check, you made sure you had your card ready to hand to her as soon as she gave it to you because you didn't know when you'd ever see her again and didn't want to wait another half hour just to pay the bill. The food wasn't even that great. I got the Danvers omelette which in the description says it has \\"their house marinated steak\\". The steak was dry and flavorless.

I guarantee this place was THE hotel/bar to be at about thirty years ago.... and that's the problem: I'm not sure they have put a penny towards upkeep/renovations SINCE thirty years ago! Everything is old-timey looking. Kind of a quirky, cool thing to have for a hotel... if they kept it all together. Everywhere you looked, however, things are just falling apart. Starting in the pool area. When you turn on the bubbles for the hot tub, it looks more like a champagne glass - tiny fizz that only comes out one side and dissipates before it reaches the middle. The umbrellas on the tables are old, ripped, dirty and, in some cases, mildewed! When you look around at the outer walls from the pool (the hotel does a kind of U shape with the pool in the middle), virtually every section of wall needs re-painted. Some of these areas look like they have been re-painted... and that's the problem, you can see definite differences in colors of paint!Going into my room, there was the distinct smell of marijuana from the previous guests (or our neighbors). There was no mistaking it. When I turned on the light to go to the restroom, two cockroaches skittered across the floor. Our \\"ironing board\\" had no pad on it.... it was just the frame, so if I had tried to iron my shirts on it, I would have had a nice waffle iron pattern across my chest. Our beds had these gold looking frames for a head board. However, with a couple of the bars, the outer \\"gold\\" part was missing, revealing the gray metal bars underneath. The TVs were from about 20 years ago and several of the channels were not useable (including the premium channels they advertise) because all you get is a loud buzzing sound for audio. The switch that turns for the reading lights between the two beds did not work. In order to turn them on, I had to push in and turn ten to twelve times just to get one click.... if I wanted both lights on, I had to then unplug the light, plug it back in and turn another ten to twelve times. If I wanted to have one side on, I had to repeat the process... and again for the other side and again to turn them back off. Takes about 5 minutes to turn off the lights. Continuing with the theme of the hotel not spending a dime on upkeep and overhead in general.... the \\"hot breakfast\\" consisted of a pile of disgusting eggs that sat there for three hours and a loaf of Kroger-brand white and wheat bread sitting next to a toaster. Their coffee tasted like muddy water. After the first day, I decided I would rather walk a few hundred yards and pay for McDonalds coffee than drink the free \\"coffee\\" in my room. On top of their lame excuse for \\"hot breakfast,\\" don't expect the \\"room service\\" to be anymore accommodating. They do have it.... as long as you are hungry between the hours of 430pm and 9pm. That's it. No lunch, no afternoon snack by the pool, no late night munchies. Their bar? It opens at 3pm and closes whenever they feel like it. 9pm, 2am. You never know. As there were a ton of us in town for a wedding, we were not the only ones to stay here. These are just my complaints. Others agreed with everything listed above, but also had some personal experiences of their own.... those on the upper levels complained of a musty smell on the elevator, a/c units that sounded like chainsaws, a bed whose frame busted and fell to the floor when a 100lb girl sat on it and one couple even had their room given away and had to sit and fight with the front desk for an hour after a cross country flight in order to get their already paid for room. I have stayed in hotels more than 90% of the country. I even lived in a long-term one for three months while doing a semester away. My father was a controller for several Marriott hotels. The work I do now deals with dozens of hotels across the country. I say all of this because I want to emphasize how bad it is that I have NEVER seen a hotel care so little about upkeep and all the little things. It's completely baffling. Have I had a worse time in other hotels? Yes, but it's normally  because of one glaring problem while other things are great.... there wasn't one redeeming quality in this entire place. While one of the cheaper places to stay in Boulder during the summer, $70/night plus taxes and fees is far from chump change. To put it bluntly, if I had a time machine, I would go back to right before I clicked \\"Confirm Reservation\\" and punch two months ago me square in the face."},{"name":"Veritas","address":"11 W Gay St","city":"Columbus","stars":"4","text":"This place is wonderful. My s/o and I have been a few (maybe 4 or 5) times for the tasting menu, and it's been great every time. The food is presented beautifully, tastes great, and you can tell the amount of time, effort, and thought put into each dish. We also indulged in the wine pairings, which are so worth it! We've moved around the country a bit, moved to Columbus from California, and were really missing non-sweet wines until we found Veritas (and also Twisted Vine in UA)! I'm a fan of minerally wines, and was so surprised and pleased to have a few different ones here! The wine program is really impressive, Greg and the team should be proud!Mitch was our server, I think 3 of the times that we've been, and was also great and knowledgeable about each dish and wine pairing. I'm finally writing this review now, as my s/o and I move back to our home area of Boston. I have to admit we were very picky about the places we ate at, as both of us have been/are in the restaurant industry, but Veritas is one of our favorites and is one of the things we will miss the most about Columbus!I'm hopeful that more people in the area will open their appetites to this great experience, and try new things!

There's a separate dining-only area (both inside and out), and if you round the corner beyond the bathrooms, there's a \\"nightclub\\" called Oliver's.  There, you'll find a dimly-lit area with even more open space.  Oliver's is probably best for live shows and dancing, but for watching games, you can't beat the front (Cask'n Flagon) area.For dinner one night, I ordered the \\"Papelbomb,\\" (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/bsGuOhibpJc-MHNXj9kiUg?select=rT6qAtFwDxqhBCNhWuegsw#nohbQWg9qO9ysuHOuCErAg) a derivitave of a Philly (get it?) cheesesteak.

I searched the whole place for the hidden nectar of spice to give my flavorless meal a bit of a punch.  Finally - the elusive salsa was only to be found behind the counter.  So I asked a guy if I could please have a salsa.  His response?  \\"No.  You get a salsa per taco.\\"  And then turned around and walked away.

It turns out the other items we ordered were far more delicious.  The squab was plump, juicy and had a nice crispy skin.  The bok choy greens with chinese ham & wild bamboo piths was flavorful and satisfied our need for veggies for the night.  But my most favorite dish of the night was the Tofu with Greens and Crab Paste.  The mixture of fried tofu, real crab meat and crab paste was just a wonderful explosion of flavors in the mouth.

I am pleased to say that, this time, the wedge salads, filet steaks and potatoes au gratin, were DELICIOUS and the service was great!!  BUT... sadly, what started as a lovely evening, was destroyed when we were seated by a woman, who was seated with her party, directly in the center of the restaurant. This individual was the loudest, most obnoxious, vulgar individual we've ever had the misfortune of encountering.  Her continued tirade of filthy, four-letter expletives (even in the presence of children at a nearby table) and her ear-splitting shrieks and comments, ruined the night.  Everyone at the tables within earshot, and there were several, were turning in their seats, in total disbelief, to stare at this patron.  Several of us made eye contact as if we couldn't believe what we were hearing. We wouldn't have given this a second thought if we were in a tavern, or sports bar, but, this was not something one would expect to find in a high-end steak house!! There was absolutely NO question that the staff and management, were completely aware of what was taking place.  While I realize Morton's has little or no control over the clients that walk through their doors, it is my strong belief, that while confrontation is NEVER easy, management should have calmly and discreetly asked this individual to respect the other patrons dining in their establishment that evening, or, at the very least, should have pointed out the obvious, that there were children seated nearby.  Yet management did nothing to address this situation, at least not during the length of our stay.  Had there been another table in the restaurant or lounge that was NOT within earshot, we would have relocated and finished out the evening with an after dinner drink, or two.  But, after bearing witness to, well over an hour, of her ranting, shrieking, profane outbursts, we left immediately after our meal, and, ended the evening at a different establishment.  Morton's used to be our \\"go to\\" for client dinners, celebrations, or just a relaxing night out, but this was, in my opinion, an EPIC FAIL BY MANAGEMENT.

I've dined here on many occasions and definitely think this is the best spot around UCF. I can't say that I really have any consistent favorites, as I usually just kind of wing it and order whatever, but the following are all exceptional dishes:Salt and Pepper Chicken: Damn! This is some seriously spicy fried chicken. Salty, crispy, and battery-acid hot. This is definitely not to be overlooked. Spicy Beef Stew: A perfect dish for a rainy day. Thick slices of tender beef served with noodles and bok choy in a savory broth? What's not to love? The flavor of the broth is a bit funky and might seem a bit off-putting at first, making this soup an acquired taste. Thankfully, it's a taste that you can acquire in a few spoonfulls. Thumbs up!Pork Belly Box: I think this is only available for lunch, but essentially this is pork belly with fried rice and some other stuff. It's good. Moving on. I'm not quite sure what they do to their hard boiled eggs to make them so fucking good, but they are so fucking good. Gua Bao (Gao Bao?): This is seriously the shit. Braised pork belly served with peanuts and mustard greens inside a soft and subtly-sweet steamed bun? This is unstoppable. I lied when I said that I didn't have a consistent favorite, because I usually get an order of this to split with my main bitch in addition to my entree.

The smell of a meal worth paying for crawled inside of our heads.Seated: We were given a table immediately, the same spot we've always known. Water graced our presence in a timely manner. A salad was also placed on our table after we had ordered. It had a onionish kick to it that's not for everyone. I ordered the Spicy Pork Bulgolgi and Susan ordered the Chicken Bulgolgi. Golf played on the TV opposite to the kitchen. The kitchen was open-window and watching the chefs filled Susan with confidence that she would get a satisfying meal.Eating: The appetizers came out seconds before the main course. The potatoes were \\" life changing\\", sweet and satisfying. The kimchi was perfect: spicy, cool, and crunchy. Both entr√©es tasted great and came out at a perfect temperature. The bulgolgi was delicious and I would get it again. A soup came out 3/4 of the way through the meal. It looked like miso soup, but it tasted like it was infused with incense. The white rice was sticky and a great addition.Digesting: My stomach was extremely happy and I couldn't leave the table until I finished off everything. The check came and went without hassle.

I'm tempted to use the word authentic here...Yet...The service and several conversations and snippy attitude exchanges between servers and managerial staff (perhaps) was revealing and obnoxious.  This is my first time in Portland and Le Pigeon was our dinner spot of choice.  We arrived (no reservation -- booked full up nearly a week in advance) at Le Pigeon around 5:30pm on a Saturday and they said it would be about 45 minutes maximum wait.  We decided to head over to Pok Pok as an alternative and Le Pigeon offered to call us when our table was available (table for 3).  By the time we got to Pok Pok it was after 6:00 and the wait there was approximately an hour and seemed very disorganized.  The hostess suggested we sit at the bar (a small black metal, very uncomfortable, long table bolted to the ground) and order some small eats and a drink in the meantime.  We give-in.  After horrible drink service but a rather tasty tamarind whiskey sour and some spicy peanuts, the couple sitting next to us at the bar is offered a menu and the opportunity to order food -- no menu for us!   Strange things begin to happen for such a hyped and seemingly together place!   Some \\"dude\\" in some sort of managerial position snips at the hostess for something and two servers argue with each other about their responsibilities.  We hear from Le Pigeon that our table is ready -- we decline and I begin to regret my decision.  Finally, well over an hour later we get a seat inside at a tiny little table in the corner, near the toilets and the bar.  A server drops a highball glass and it shatters all over the floor, little shards of glass everywhere.  Good thing I wasn't wearing sandals.  Not that they bothered to pick up the glass spatterings beneath our table.  We order and finally get some great service with awesome recommendations:Muu Paa Kham Waan -- tender, spicy, sweet boar meat served with a plate of super crisp mustard greens in ice.  Take a bite of the fiery meat and cool off with the snap of the greens.  This was my favorite of the three dishes we ordered.  Kai Yaang (whole bird) -- crispy on the outside, moist and flavorful meat but nothing special.  Duck Laab  -- my second favorite of the dishes, spicy with rich duck meat, duck liver, and fried bits of duck skin.  A sinful treat, super filling and exhausting!  Sticky rice (slightly overcooked) all around and Beerlao (my favorite Southeast Asian beer by a long shot) to boot.  The price is right for upscale Southeast Asian eats on the west coast (save the $8.50 cocktail), the menu excellent, and the drinks refreshing but our service was just too spotty, the wait not fully worth it, and the specialty dish just not special enough to justify 5 or even 4 stars here.

The restaurant was very spacious and clean.  Menu's were given to us by the host and I excused myself to the ladies room.  Upon returning, my friend commented that she had not seen a waiter but asked the gentleman for hot tea.  It took probably another 5-10 minutes before a waiter appeared (the only one we saw the entire time) to take our drink orders (water).  We decided on two of the lunch specials:  kung pao chicken with fried rice, hot & sour soup and a crab rangoon and the sauteed filet of flounder with fried rice, wonton soup and a crab rangoon.  We also ordered the spring roll (2).The soups were served first.  Wonton soup was rather salty and but the filling was rather tasteless.  Couldn't quite tell what was inside.  Friend said hot & sour soup was \\"ok\\".  I assumed the spring rolls weren't fried but they were. Also OK, nothing to rave about. Our lunch entrees were served shortly.  Flounder was very tender but somewhat tasteless. Kung Pao chicken was tender with the right amount of spice. Fried rice kinda bland.  Crab rangoons were good.

When my wife told me about it, I had to give it a try. Last Sunday her and our daughter had a girl's day out so I decided to give it a try. I found out the hard way I should have checked to see if they were open on Sundays. My Bad...Well after starting the day with an upset stomach I thought I was going to be skipping lunch but after a couple of glasses of milk and some ginger ale I was ready to eat something. Mama Mia...  Look out Meatball Shoppe, here I come...  When I arrived, the first thing I noticed was a very small dining area that was modestly decorated. It reminded me of a place little Italian sub shop in San Antonio I stopped in for lunch at. The waitress brought me a menu and took my drink order. I would have preferred unsweet iced tea but bottled water would have to do if I was not in the mood for something sugary to drink.When she came back I chose to see if she was willing to work with a difficult customer that wanted something nonstandard from the menu. She handled herself very well and brought the chef to the table. He was very nice and very accommodating. I was given one of every meatball on the menu with the sauce on top over some arugula, some polenta, focaccia and pita. I also tried the mini cannoli and cappuccino gelato.The Chicken Marsala had a nice flavor and caught me off guard with the layers of flavor. Next up was the Spicy Pork and was by far my favorite. It had just the right amount of heat. Jeffy's Sausage was up next and the flavor was good but it was a tad try. I forgot what was next but as soon as I bit into it, Mac n Cheese came to mind. I have to admit I was having a kid moment eating that one. On to The Mediterranean and I was expecting more flavor from the lamb but the tzatziki was fantastic. Last up was the \\"Traditional\\" and it was my second favorite. It reminded me of the way my aunt made her meatballs only not soaked with sauce. The sauce was very nice and coming from me, that is a real compliment for I have been cooking Italian food since I could reach a stove. By the way..  That polenta ROCKS! Nicely done!The Cannoli was very good. The ricotta was not sickening sweet which was pleasant. The shell was ok but something fresh made would have highlighted the ricotta better. The gelato was ok even though I prefer min a bit smoother. Keep in mind I grew up eating cannoli's and gelato as a little boy so I am a bit snooty on Italian desserts.Would I recommend them is what it boils down to... ABSOLUTELY!!! For only being two months old, I see this place outgrowing their store in no time. I was informed by the chef that they are planning to expand and I suggested an \\"Express\\" or fast food version and then a more formal version for places like Winter Park and Windermere. I can easily see this turning into a national franchise but I really hope that they do not cut any corners as they grow. I see a real gem in this place is for all of my fellow foodies... You would be a fool NOT to come check this place out! I will be coming by here with my wife next time and I already know which three she will fall in love with.

Still searching for that)  I might have even given them 5 stars but for the unfriednly service.  We are always served by the same adjuma, and she is always unfailingly cold, unhelpful, and unhappy.  (But she is attentive.)(I feel like she might be an indetured servant, working there totaly against her wishes, but forced to for some bizarre, tragic, confining circumstance.  Like maybe the owner is holding her children hostage until she can pay off some unimagineably large debt?  I don't know.  Evereytime I see, I start imagining what her unhappy plight might be...)Most likely, she is just embarrassed about her English, but even when I speak to her in Korean, I barely get a look from her.  C'mon lady, smile!But onto the food.  The food is about as authentic as you will get in Boston.  Flavorful and made with quality products (but not premium), the bulgogi and kalbi are tender and spiced just right.  The BBQ at the table is how we Koreans have been eating it since forever (it is not the new hot fad, as another reviewer presumed).  My mom used to cook it in an electric skillet in the middle of the dining room table!  And I love that the Adjuma, cold and emotionally unavailable as she may seem, totally understands that I do not want to be doing my own cooking.  She does most of the tending to the meat, but you should be ready to take it off the grill when it is done to your liking.The best thing about the BBQ is that they give you \\"ssam\\" -- lettuce in which to wrap your bit o' meat with a bit of rice, some pepper-and-miso paste, and maybe a bit of kimchee.  I don't know why every Korean restaurant doesn't offer this -- it makes all the difference.You get a lot of meat in an order -- plan on 1 meat dish for every 2 people.  When my husband and I come, we usually get the scallion \\"pancake\\" appetizer (pajun) and 1 meat dish, and we have to take a lot home.The scallion pancake is excellent -- just like mom makes.  The panchan are the usual fare, and pretty good amounts and variety.  The soups are everything they should be -- I think the broth is housemade, for the flavor is nicely complex and deep.  The hot-pot bibimbap is also quite good, and is often a favorite with Caucasians who are new to Korean cuisine.If you are new to Korean food, and you are alone (or don't want to share with others), try the hot-pot bibimbap.  For 2-3 people, I suggest ordering the bulgogi and an appetizer or two -- I like the pan-fried \\"mandoo\\" dumplings, and my Caucasian husband's favorite is the scallion pancake \\"pajun\\" (savory, it is just in the shape of a pancake.)  If you have more than two people, I suggest also getting the chicken bulgogi, which is excellent here.  The Korean version of sweet and sour pork/chicken is also a good choice for Korean-food virgins.For the truly intrepid and lovers of spice, try the soups!  I personally think they are the strong point of Korean cuisine.  My favorite is yukejjang (yookeh jjang?), but it is one of the spiciest.  The \\"chigae\\"s are the much stronger stronger versions of the Japanese Miso soup, but they are filled with meat and vegetables.  My dad could, and has, lived on chigae alone.  Great on a cold, snowy day.So do come, but just expect cold, unfriendly service (she is attentive, just not friendly) and don't be offended.  It's not you, it's her.If you want friendly Korean service, go to Yamas in Hanover, NH and WRJ, VT -- but the food is not as good.

I give every venue at least 2 or 3 visits before reviewing.  That being said, I have visited SMG 3 times now and had 3 totally different experiences.  The first was a weekday afternoon 2 weeks after SMG opened.  The experience was incredible and we were in awe.  Everything from the ticket counter person, bartender, ticket taker, server to food runners were awesome.  I truly felt as if my movie theater and food experience was important to them.  My second visit was a busy weekend afternoon and was fairly similar, with the exception of a few details being overlooked by staff such as receiving no silverware, not receiving the requested catsup or mayonnaise and needing to ask for additional napkins.  Still not enough to ruin my experience.  However, the third visit was another situation altogether.  I will preface this by saying the third visit was on Mother's Day afternoon!  Aaack.  The movie was almost sold out and we were lucky to get seats.  Apparently, every movie in the entire theater was unbelievably busy and they were horribly understaffed and overwhelmed.  We were told 3 or 4 times that the theater was not available for seating when we tried to enter with hopes that we could order before the movie started and not have our movie interrupted so often (as in our last experience.)  We were finally seated as previews began (as was everyone else!)  This was 5 minutes after Avengers End Game was seated in a large theater so we knew this was going to be a kitchen back up situation.  And we were correct.  It was downhill from there.  Our apps arrived before our drinks with no silverware or napkins.  Our drinks arrived in spilled, sticky cups with no straws.  Our food arrived cold with no silverware or napkins.  We had to push our magic button so many times and endure so much interruption to the movie that neither the movie, the food, nor the theater experience was enjoyable.  We wished we would have stayed home with Netflix and chilled.  Due to our first experience being very wonderful and the fact that this was Mother's Day, we are going to give it at least one more try."},{"name":"Steve's Pok√© Bar","address":"4A 9965 152 Street","city":"Surrey","stars":"4.5","text":"Five star service, and five star quality of ingredients.

Served with drawn butter and cooked perfectly - still drooling when I think about it.The dessert was disappointing. Apple Tarte Tatin - flavours were on point, but the pastry was too tough for the provided fork to cut through. Maybe not enough fat used in the dough, or perhaps it was overworked.

The weather was dark, cold, and rainy so there weren't a lot of people there. Since I was dining alone, I just parked my arse at the bar and ordered from there. Why waste a table?My visited started fine enough, the bartender (at the time) was pleasant and made my drink quickly. I ordered the spicy habanero margarita which had a good amount of booze in it but not enough spice. To each their own. The menu is fairly small and full of 'high end' (sounding) Mexican offerings unlike something you'd see at a more casual place like Howling Wolf. I settled on the carne asada with 3 chili shrimp which was cooked promptly and thrown to me like a frisbee from the OTHER crouchy bartender. She's older-ish (I'm old), blonde, and likely a supervisor / lead / whatever based on how she was ordering folks behind the bar around.My steak was cooked the way I like it, medium rare, and the shrimp was delicious. Of course, the only bean option they have is black but it sure would be nice to have the option of pinto and refried as well. Whatever. The rice, on the other hand, was crunchy and dry. Whether the rice was under or overcooked I have no idea, however, given the small portion size of the entire meal I was determined to eat it. I flagged down the grouchy bartender who was now the only person working on my side and asked for hot sauce. I was never given chips and salsa so I assumed those cost extra which is unheard of in the Mexican restuarant world. The bartender grabbed a bottle of tapatio from under the bar and slide it over to me like an old Wild Wild West Saloon. I drenched the rice in tapatio which helped a lot but before I could really dig in, said bartender walked by and took the tapatio back. I guess I was done with it?As I was about done with my meal, an older couple sat directly to my left. I was like \\"great, let's see her tear them a new one. I rubbed my hands together like villain waiting for a damsel to be run over by a locomotive. Alas, nothing happened. In fact, she was friendly to them and gave them chips and salsa! WTF, I almost spat out my hard rice when I saw that. I guess I'm not local enough? I digress.The rest of the meal was unremarkable. The g-bartender put my check down without a word and I paid with all the enthusiasm of someone who can't wait to walk in the rain. Interpret that as you will.I'll go back to En Fuego because my wife hasn't been there yet and you cannot beat their convenient location near the train and downtown Beverly.

I started \\"Yelp'ing\\" and found Taste of Peru ... so we set the directions and off we went.At first, we were a little confused as it looked as though we have turned into a building complex that didn't have much going on, plus, it was under construction.  We were about to turn around and I saw some neon lights around big windows and guessed that was the restaurant.  It was ... dang, I'm good.  For the outside, it doesn't look like much or that it is even open but we walked up to the door despite our hesitation.  We we opened the door, we were greeted with huge smiles and a \\"hello!\\" from the servers and cook (you can see him through a little window.)  I knew at that point that we were staying for sure.  I loved the vibe.  We were immediately seated and helped by a sweet lady named Millie (or Milly?)  We asked a bunch of questions and she was more than happy to answer them.  With that, we ordered .... for an appetizer to share, we got the Vuelve a La Vida (shrimp, calamari, fish and octopus marinated in leche de tigre) and for dinner I got the Tacu Tacu Con Churrasco Beef dish.Let me tell you, both of those items were out of this world.  By the time I had inhaled half of my dinner, I was extremely full but kept eating simply because it tasted so good and I didn't want that feeling to end .... \\"pleeeeasse, don't let this dinner ennnnnnnd.\\"Although I wanted to shove a dessert in my pie hole, I simply had no room.

Very nice on her part, but if your customers need that maybe you should consider adjusting the lighting. I started with the jumbo shrimp cocktail. Good sized and very flavorful. However, the dish contained only three shrimp for $12! For my entree I had a 6 ounce Filet Mignon and the creamy mashed potatoes. Excellent, terrific, wonderful!

Landry's Select seem to be \\"famous\\" for ensuring that the quality of food at restaurants they purchase falls drastically, e.g. The Chart House and Jake's.My family and I used to be frequent diners at Morton's.  The food was amazing, and the service fabulous.  Yesterday, my daughter in law and I decided to give Landyr's Select and Morton's another try and on the spur of the moment went there for dinner.  I very fondly remembered their chopped salad as well as their shrimp Alexander.So we duly ordered a chopped salad to share and each of us an appetizer order of shrimp Alexander.  After quite a wait, the salad arrived.  I had asked to have the onions left off and the dressing on the side.  Alas, it was not to be, the salad was drowned in dressing and bore absolutely no relation to the delicious chop salad of my fond memories.  It looked slimy and smelled bad.  My daughter in law was brave enough to take one bite before spitting out the offending food.  The server, who was great, removed the salad and offered to bring us a different salad.  Once bitten, twice shy - we refused his kind offer.Then the kitchen had to make a very long trek to the part of the ocean where they attempted to catch the shrimp for the shrimp Alexander.  At least so it seemed, we had to wait such a long time.  The only thing that made the wait bearable and why we did not leave, was Deshawn Butler, one of the managers.  Frankly, he seems wasted at Morton's.  He reassured us, checked on the shrimp, asked if there was something he could get us.  Wow!  Our server was also wonderful.  They are the two reasons I did not give Morton's one star.Finally, the shrimp arrived.  I was quite worried that aforementioned shrimp would be as bad as the salad.  Morton's used to serve absolutely GIANT shrimp in the shrimp Alexander and there would be three nestled in a piping hot little ramekin.  I usually could only finish one and a half, they were so filling.In this incarnation, four medium large shrimp arrived on a rectangular tray with the Alexander sauce around them.  We were pleasantly surprised that the shrimp was good.  At least we thought so until we rushed over to El Gaucho's after the dinner debacle,  to eat one of their amazing wedge salads to make up for the one at Morton's.  I also ordered the prawn linguine, wanting to compare shrimp.   One taste of El Gaucho's prawns, made both my daughter in law and me realize that the shrimp Alexander at Morton's were mediocre at best.I am sad that one of my favorite restaurants no longer has great food."},{"name":"Woking Dragon","address":"1198 Landsdowne Drive","city":"Coquitlam","stars":"3.5","text":"You're not going to get poisoned but I wont be back.

You just have to ask. The chuychanga is delicious as well as the salads. The restaurant is lively and colorful. There is plenty of room for groups. I always receive good service.

The drinks we got were amazing.  Really well balanced and exactly what we wanted.  And although we got cocktails, we just as easily could have gone with a bottle off of their extensive wine list. There were several bottles imported from Italy and Dom Perignon even made the list.  The friendly server was spot on with the drink suggestions and always seemed to be there when we needed her.    Their gorgeous patio was big enough to be its own spot, with several seating options.  (Our favorite was the couch near their adjustable fire pit.).   The squid ink pasta dish, which we got with squid as the protein,  was quite simply incredible.  The rich sauce was a perfect consistency, and the veggies in the dish were cooked spot on. There was loads of flavor bursting throughout. We would highly recommend this dish to any seafood lover.  Also, this is a bit random but they had the cleanest bathrooms we had ever seen in a restaurant.    The  Bad:  So I ordered the roasted half chicken with potato, garlic pan sauce, and roasted onions.  The dish was overall, a major disappointment.  The chicken itself was cooked quite well, was juicy and flavorful, and the skin was perfectly crispy. The garlic pan sauce was spot on as well. unfortunately, there was way too much of it.  The entire dish was absolutely swimming in it.  The crispy skin and potatoes became soggy and mushy as soon as it touched it.  Not that the potatoes did not have problems on its own.  Both the potatoes and onions were completely unflavored and soggy since they were drowning in the sauce.  It felt like they were there just to be there. This dish was just very underwhelming.The Ugly:  Directly related to the bad, most of the dishes just seemed to be missing one thing to take it to the next level and make it feel complete.  Already went over the chicken.  The dessert, an apple tart type dish consisted of the tart,  ice cream, and a delicious caramel,  which there was not enough of.  It was also missing something, maybe something crunchy( candied walnuts?) to make it feel complete.  And the bread was good but severed with an unflavored EVOO.  Throwing in some more flavor and herbs to kick it up a notch would be a good idea.\\nThe Final Word:  There were some definite highs and lows that stood out.  But in this case, the good definitely outweighed the bad. We want to go back to get a bottle of wine and try several of the apps. 4 stars"},{"name":"Sushi Kiku","address":"2770 Lenox Rd","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3.5","text":"Came here for a friend's birthday.

I don't go inside, I use the drive thru as I'm not looking for a \\"dine in\\" experience from a fast food place. I think in the 10+ years I've lived here and gone to this particular location, I can count on one hand the number of times my order has been correct. Even with the modern mobile ordering where I don't have to explain anything, the order is still wrong. I don't customize or add anything specific. The craziest I get is adding cheese (which costs extra). I glance in my bag no matter where I go to make sure things at least seem right as a force of habit from growing up. No matter how right things look they almost always require a return trip. The receipt can read correctly, the order screen can be right, and my order can be 100% different from both when I get it home to eat it. Items missing, sandwiches made wrong, things added that I didn't even order. And don't try to call and complain, that phone number may as well go to the space station. Today was no exception, but sometimes you just want a certain flavor, and like an idiot I trusted that the order would be correct. It wasn't. I tried to call, like an idiot, 6 times in a 45 minute window of finding the mistake. The call was answered by a fax machine every time. The temptation was unbelievably strong to write out a letter and let my fax machine send it in. At least the call would've been answered. Although I can't trust that they keep paper in their fax for that very reason. This is by FAR the \\"bad\\" Burger King in the area. I was even stopped once by another customer as I walked in with my bag of mistakes and told that if I wanted it right, I should always go inside. No. If I wanted it right, I should've driven the extra mile and a half to the other Burger King."},{"name":"Mimi's","address":"12636 Research Blvd","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"This is one of the nicest relaxing places to eat.

Plus, the place was really quiet and empty on a Thursday afternoon. Our cashier was very friendly and was happy to provide us an overview of the toppings and some containers to take as we liked. Also, we had to spend a minimum of $30 since I had a certificate from Restaurant.com ($15 off $30)-- you can't get the special combos with this certificate. The order: My gf and I ordered 2 carne asadas, 2 carnitas, and 2 al pastor tacos. We added the cheese and avocado upon suggestion, which was an extra 25¬¢ each. Then we got cheese empanadas and a pibil salbuto to reach the limit. Overall: the corn tortillas are certainly authentic, the meat is well prepared, and everything seemed fresh. The empanadas were just ok, though. Our favorites were the carne asada and the pibil. Would definitely come back again!

The food is not cheap, but you get what you pay for - in this case, a fresh wrap/bowl with fresh tasty vegetables steamed with whatever toppings you want.   Did I mention it's fresh? Service is friendly and helpful, which is good because their menu is confusing to new visitors. Everything they sell is a custom combination of vegetables, so it's not like a usual restaurant where you can identify dishes by name alone. This does lead to some occasionally painful  waits when ordering (see downside below), but the staff all seem super nice and food preparation itself seems speedy and pretty optimized. Being able to choose wrap vs bowl is good, having Braggs available is a nice touch.  The smoothies are great but overpriced.   Once you start adding in ingredients, a wrap and smoothie combined can push the cost of a meal up past $20!The downsides:\\n1. Lines and waits frequently get out of hand... even at random points in there day when there's not much of a line,  you may still get stuck behind some super earthy type who needs to discuss every ingredient on the menu and how aligned it is with their chi that afternoon (which the cashiers are of course happy to do because they're super friendly and I think this is meant to be one of the key selling points of the restaurant). Maybe this is nice the first time you go there, but once you've found your favorite few menu items, it's a nuisance on return trips having to wait for everyone else to go through this process again and again and again.I tried talking to the manager once about ways to speed it up for people who know what they want (some sort of touchscreen system alongside the cashiers?), but he pointed out that they consider their current scheme a point of pride so it's not \\"manufactured food like Mcdonalds\\".  He then went back to having to apologize for the wait to each and every person in line after me...2. the whole \\"yoga mom\\" atmosphere of the restaurant can get to be a bit much.  I can see why it works for the neighborhood and I'm willing to put up with it, but come on guys, these are just veggies you're selling. That avocado isn't a \\"soul nourishing\\" avocado, it's not an \\"inner-peace strengthening\\" avocado.  it's just a frigging avocado!! Along those lines, those wrap and bowl names are pretty agonizing and I still shudder every time I have to utter them. Just my luck that two of the worst (\\"the hot and healthy bachelor\\", \\"the green goddess\\") are my two favorites! 3. Not much in the way of side dishes - a couple of jars of dehydrated pineapple and some natural cookies which someone else pointed out are crazy high in calories.  I guess you can order any of the add-ins as a side, but I've there must be some fun side dishes they could serve. Also, while I like that they keep it fresh veggie based, I'd love to see what this place could do with Seitan as an optional side. I understand that might not work from a freshness/preparation time standpoint though. Despite those complaints, Life Alive is a good restaurant and I'm glad it's in Central Square...I go there a ton and will continue to go there.  Right now they're at about a 4.5/5 for me and I'd gladly bump that up to a perfect score if they dropped their smoothie prices and found a way to speed up ordering."},{"name":"Brassica","address":"2212 E Main St","city":"Bexley","stars":"4.5","text":"The food here is so good.

We selected the St. Luis Pork Ribs, Spicy Chopped, and Moist Brisket with some sides.  You walk away with plates of butcher paper, and your food wrapped up on a plastic tray.  The seating area is quite large inside and out.  There are large wooden picnic tables for open community style seating. Our group of friends dug into the meat, and our favorite was the spicy chopped.  Very different from anything I have had before, and it was delicious.  The moist brisket was a bit better than average, tasty but still a bit too on the fatty side.  The ribs were also decent. The sauce is OK, not fresh, it's full of high fructose corn syrup.  We had lots of left overs to take home with us.  The friends voted the creamed corn as the best side option.  I liked that they had pickles in a bag - quite tasty and crisp.

The lines never moved and if you walked up to the window they just ignored you.  I have a VERY narrow window of opportunity to have lunch and I don't have time to wait in lines or be ignored.  Abandon the practice of putting a bunch of idiots in the lot trying to take orders and just do it the old fashion way with the speaker.So over the months I have managed to get somewhat served a few times ... or at least leave with something in the bag, but I've bought more $10 drinks and had to leave without any food more often than not.  But even though I have managed to leave a few times with \\"something\\" in the bag they still have not been able to get my order correct ... NOT ONCE.  At this point it really seems as though it's on purpose ... I know that sounds paranoid, but c'mon not one correct order.  If my order isn't correct I don't consider that a successful interaction, so to date I have not had one successful, correct or complete meal from this location ... amazing.  Drinks have been wrong, I've gotten the spicy sandwich on several occasions (and I HATE the spicy sandwich so it goes straight into the trash), I've gotten less than half orders of fries, I got an order of fries once that was WET AND SOGGY, on the last visit the cole slaw was less than half full AND it was just white liquid, there was no cabbage or anything else in the container.I only ever order one thing.  It's the most basic thing on the menu.  It's the sandwich that the company was started with.  I order a number one meal ... regular sandwich and fries ... and I order a small cole slaw ...

My boyfriend got the Okinawa ramen and it was pretty unique since the broth was on the lighter side and was very refreshing.

We played here this past Tuesday and from the beginning, Grouch was NOT friendly at all. No friendly greeting, no smile, nothing. Everything we asked seemed to be a chore for him to answer. My friend asked him for game recommendations and he didn't give any, just ignored him. I asked how the candy was served (it's labeled $3 on the jars of them) and he said it comes in a bowl. So I asked how big the bowl was, and he curtly responds with an eye roll, \\"small bowl\\".  About an hour in, I was going to get my friend a milkshake and when I asked him what flavor he wanted, Grouch overhears and just says \\"we don't have ice cream\\". Like dude, work with us? I've worked in the service industry and I (and most people I know who have also been in the service industry) would reasonably expect a follow up like \\"we don't have ice cream but we have frozen lemonade! Or how about some ice tea?\\" Why did everything he say have to be so short/curt? Really strange.That being said, this place is not a restaurant and the whole review shouldn't be about the service. Thank goodness there were a huge range of games to deter from the experience, although we explored new games by looking up recommendations online instead of from Grouch. And luckily, the AC was actually on, which I wasn't expecting after having read multiple reviews about the place being hot.

Next we got a seafood linguini that had scallops and shrimp. Again, super fresh and tasty seafood. I'm not sure I've had scallops that good in a really long time.

My friend ordered the Double Belgian Waffle topped with fresh fruit of the day and added bananas. The fruit was fresh and the waffles were cooked lightly crispy on the outside and soft on the inside and the light maple syrup tied it all together.

I've been eyeing this place both in walk by and carefully observing some of the Yelp reviews as they were posted. I only have a small reserve for my fine dining expenses, therefore, this careful attention to research and detail prior to arrival was necessary. As for gluten free options, there are a few. I was appreciative that the waiter and the owner literally took 5 - 10 minutes going over each and every menu item with me to ensure that I was comfortable. This care and attention wins automatic points with me. What initially brought me in was most people's rave reviews about the expresso cr√®me brule. Anyone who knows me, knows that I am crazy about cr√®me brule. The texture of the cr√®me brule was light rather than rich, similar to the texture I make at home. The downfall to it being shallow is that the torching over heated the cr√®me itself (cr√®me is supposed to be served cold). The cr√®me had a brown tint, however, almost undetectable for a dominating espresso flavour. The shell, however, was nicely torched (even browning). Tomato bocconcini salad was good. Heavy on the balsamic to olive oil ratio, however, served it's purpose after it was all said and done. Heavy on the onions as well, therefore, if you're on a date and want to make out later, make sure you both have some mouthwash for later. Grilled New York steak & pommes frites was done to order, very moist and done the way I liked it to perfection to consistency. I had to skip the red wine peppercorn gravy due to gluten, however, the steak itself was flavorful that you could do without. Pear Almond Tart with Lavendar mascarpone cream. Nice and moist, however, where was the lavender essence? Was it hiding away from me? Was it angry? Other than the lack of lavender, the dessert still held up. Field berry cobbler. Culinary warning that this cobbler isn't the traditional cobbler that is seen in most North American restaurants. It's a warm jam like berry compote with a cookie on top (had to skip the cookie part).  The d√©cor is clean, dark and modern. We were served on kitch blue plates that threw the whole d√©cor out of whack, however, I am kitsch kind of person so it worked in my favour, not sure for the general ambience and presentation of what the bistro as the platting is supposed to convey as a 4 star establishment. My friend and I were the first to arrive for early dinner service which meant we got 100% of the attention. Our glasses of water was filled promptly, the dishes in proper order and in proper timed sequence cooked to perfection. Our waiter was super friendly and sociable. He noticed the Y.M.O record on the table and engaged in conversation of music with us. It's so hard to find someone who actually know who Y.M.O are, let alone some sort of knowledge of music.

The waitress and owner were both very friendly and came to check on us often. My only complaint is that the food took a little long to arrive. I ended up getting the choice maki lunch with the spicy salmon and California maki rolls. I don't eat meat so the beef was substituted with truffled tuna.

Since when has anyone charged gratuity for a carry out order?! Daylight robbery!"},{"name":"McDonald's","address":"3162 University Blvd","city":"Winter Park","stars":"2.5","text":"I was picking up a delivery for Uber eats. After waiting for ten minutes standing I decided to grab a chair to sit down, it was 11:00 pm on a Tuesday. After another 5 minutes with no problems, an employee comes out \\"possibly the manager\\" and tells me that I can't sit down. Mind you, there's less than 5 people in the store. This is the first time any employee spoke to me...no one asked what my order was. No one asked if I needed help. Only when I sat down did they pay any attention to me and it was only to make me stand up. I've had bad experiences at McDonald's but geez a delivery guy can't even sit down to wait 30 mins for a burger? Cancelled the order. Walked out calmly. Maybe I'm being petty but that seemed like a miserable person trying to take advantage of the little power they had over people.

However, Coquille not only nailed the consistency but also paired its delicate seafood with daring and bold flavours. I was greeted immediately when I entered the restaurant and was impressed with their coat service. Not a lot of restaurants offer such practice anymore. Seated near the window, I got to soak up the sunshine and the heart of Gastown. The wallpaper and choice of tiles definitely showed the amount of care and detail work placed in the interior design to reflect a modern French cuisine. I ordered the Coquille Ceviche, Bouillabaisse and Halibut. The Ceviche had cubbed white fish, lemon pulp cubes, jalapeno, cilantro and a tangy passionfruit sauce. Cooked in citrus, the white fish can't sit too long in the sauce but don't worry, you will be enticed and somewhat addicted because the acid will slowly increase your appetite. The nacho chips were crunchy and perfectly salted. I was glad I ordered the bouillabaisse because it was beautiful to see, smell and taste! The easiest way to figure out if chefs have their basic skills down is by looking at how the scallop was cooked. Well, Coquille hired chefs that knew their basics because the scallop had a beautiful golden sear which encrusted the top of the scallop while the inside was on the verge of translucent. Pillowly and easy to cut, the scallop was the highlight of the dish. Instead of giving a plain piece of bread, crusty \\"croutons\\" with a decadent smear (I believe it is mustard, correct me if I am wrong) and topped with chives, was my vessel to soak out the rich seafood broth. The broth had notes of carrot flavour as it had a thicker consistency compared to usual bouillabaisse. The shrimps, clams, mussels and halibut were cooked well. Definitely, a must order dish!The Halibut first came bare on a plate and I was surprised but let me tell you, no more is needed. The hidden mushrooms, underneath the fish, had a lovely wine and caramelized flavour! I believe the fish was poached in some type of liquid or steamed but the meat was flaky and moist. We ended the meal with 2 complimentary oatmeal white chocolate and cranberry cookies. It was chewy, delicious and the perfect sweet note to end the meal.I absolutely recommend this restaurants to seafood lovers and all Gastown lovers too."},{"name":"Sisters Ethiopian Restaurant","address":"1720 SE 122nd Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"5","text":"I have never had Ethiopian and decided to try this place since it's near our home.

The brisket is tender, flavorful, and always has a great smoke ring with equally great smokey flavor.  By far my favorite item, both lean and moist, on the menu!Ribs - The pork spare ribs here are always on point - falling off the bone and full of flavor.  I never need any sauce.Sausage - Rudy's sausage is not the best, but very good - especially the jalapeno links.  Never too salty, and always has that crisp bite with soft stuffing.  Turkey - I'm not a huge fan of turkey, but after trying a piece of turkey off a friend's plate, I do end up ordering a 1/4 lb more often than not.  The turkey is moist, which is usually difficult for BBQ, and packed full of smokey goodness.Overall, Rudy's is a great BBQ option amongst the dozens of options available in Austin."},{"name":"True Food Kitchen","address":"222 West Ave","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"Used to be a big fan of TFK, but today changed that. I understand there is a water issue, but that doesn't excuse poor service. We waited over thirty minutes even though there were empty tables with no explanation of why. Once we were seated nobody said anything to us for another fifteen minutes. I ordered a beer but it never came. I went to the bar to find out the taps were out, but our waitress never bothered to let me know, so I had to get my own drink. I give the experience two stars because the food was good and I appreciate how hard the kitchen is working with the water challenge. But the rest of the staff was not helpful. Too bad.

I spent sometime in the travel section (red room, 800 section) and found so many great books for my upcoming trips. I love how they integrate new and used books together; helps for the price conscious individual. What I really loved were the added accessories: Timbuk2 bags, mugs, t-shirts and socks! Tacosaurus socks!I ended up spending over $100 that day and only visit 2 of the many color coded rooms. One would need an entire weekend to peruse through the entire bookstore, it's that massive.

I had mussels, octopus terrine, cod with goose barnacles and a kefir panna cotta with fruit. Unfortunately, the wine selection doesn't match up with the food, neither in terms of choice (food-wine pairing options) nor in terms of quality. Why, considering that they advertise local sourcing, would the restaurant want to serve mediocre, past-peak European wines (in two cases oxidised to the extent that they wouldn't actually be consumed anymore in their regions of origin) rather than something from the continent? Are rejected batches of European wine being dumped on the Canadian market? Now you seem to be paying for mileage + label rather than for quality. I'd say make the wine worthy of the food: get some advise from a good wine consultant, enlarge the list, consider having South-American or even US wines. \\nAll things considered, the meal was a bit too expensive."},{"name":"Cafe Today","address":"825 NE Multnomah St","city":"Portland","stars":"2.5","text":"Decent place for a quick lunch.

I had to wait till our waiter to show up to ask for napkins to clean myself off and to dry out my new shoes. A simple sorry would of been nice and a little off of the bill, I understand mistakes happen but something should of been done. When we got out checks we were over charged the split beer that no one drank. Lastly the guys needed to wash their hand before we left and while in the bathroom they heard someone going #2. It is a bathroom where ppl use but when that person was finished he didn't wash his hands. Hoping it was a customer just being discussing it was not. It was the employee that we saw washing the chalkboard then started filling up children's balloons.

Misrepresentation. Seriously, I'm always looking for interesting things to do and came across this neat picture of black ice cream. I've heard of activated charcoal, but I've never seen black ice cream. The pic looked so unique, so instagram worthy jet black (plus the other items on the menu seemed interesting enough) that I thought it would be a fun outting for myself and maybe some friends who want to enjoy ice cream on a nice day. Got there to discover the one reason I came there, the black ice cream, is false advertisement. How strange to me. I mean, really? People do that? Blatantly false advertise??? The ice cream is not black. It's not even dark gray. It actually looks like vanilla ice cream that's slightly gray. Kind of how vanilla bean is not perfectly white, it's a tinge of beige. I'm sorry, this bugged me. There were ice cream places closer to me, but I wanted the black ice cream. So not like the picture, why is it their main image? Because it's interesting enough to get people to come, but turns out it's false advertisement. That was not worth the drive downtown and paid parking. This dinky little hole in the wall which is not nearly as cool looking as these pictures make it seem, was not worth my time and the ice cream I got was nothing to write home about. Booo.

Should I blame ESB for that? Nope. I don't think they've created any self-hype. But I have heard many accolades about this place, and when I finally made it in to try the food, I think I had a pretty high bar set for my dining experience. Unfortunately, that bar was not really met. I stopped in for breakfast this morning and went for my first-meal lodestar - a ham and cheese scramble (in this case, it came with caramelized onions) with hashers and toast. And a cup of coffee. God I needed that coffee. The other options on the menu looked tantalizing - quiches and tarts and sandwiches, oh my! But if there's anything that every restaurant should be able to do well, it's a ham n cheese scramble. My $10 (yes, $10!) plate arrived and it was... good. White cheddar and ham scrambled with some sweet, perfectly caramelized onions. It had a nice sweet, heady flavor. It was greasy, and the eggs were browned (read: a bit overcooked). The small-ish portions of hashers was a tasty creamy/buttery treat, but fairly small in size. The toasted sourdough was flavorful and large. Overall, it was greasier than I expected, and while tasty, was not a generous portion for the price. Overall, 4 star food, but with price and size factored in (for such a simple meal), it was pretty much a 3 star breakfast (remember, that means A-OK in Yelp speak). The service was pretty laser and on-point. I was seated quickly, my order taken quickly, and the food produced with haste. No failings there, whatsoever. So this raises the everlasting question - should my review be affected by my raised expectations of this place? I think not. But for the price, and for the quality, I'd have to say that even in the abstract I'm not sure I'd be running back for more. If I lived in the area, this would be a choice somewhere on my list, but not near the top. I will come back to try some of the other delicious-looking items on the menu like the French toast and the quiche, but as far as straight scrambles go, this one underperformed."},{"name":"Cask'n Flagon","address":"62 Brookline Ave","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"Great food and atmosphere before and after a Red Sox Game.

I want to try every style of foods so I portioned each good little so I can try out which is worth it. So far the best foods that stood out to me personally is the chicken kaarage, crab balls, vegetables kaarage ( mixed kaarage), and the skewered salmon. Those are really great to try out. The sushis has a nice quality but I wouldn't go crazy over them. The wasabi is powerful, so grab just a little bit. They do have a crepe station. It was decent, but it wasn't your traditional crepes. They make it small, not an average size. The dessert is my favorite. The cakes was alright, little bit dense than I would like to be but still good. The chocolate mousse tasted like dark chocolate if you are into Hershey's dark chocolate. But my favorite highlight of the buffet is the green tea or matcha ice cream. It is so smooth, not so much sugar which it so nice. For the price, it really worth the money for a great quality of food, just go for the hot food. Sushis if you're willing to fill up just a little.

I asked why cans are even an option on the \\"eat-in\\" menu if you cannot order them, but I did not receive a reply. I paid the extra $1 for the glass and was pretty \\"hoppy\\" with the IPA even though their beer prices are about a buck higher than most places in town.With Ryan's input, I ordered the Elevated Emily ($12) sandwich with brisket, Swiss cheese, caramelized onions and mushrooms on a ciabatta roll with a side of au jus, as well as a side of Cajun fries ($3 - sandwiches and burgers do not come with a side BTW) for a grand total of $15. A tad on the high side for a sandwich, it was actually quite tasty although a bit small for the price.Not a horrible value, I have eaten better, more robust sandwiches (with fries) and have drunk equivalent brews at other local establishments, having paid a total of $3 to $5 (per person) less on average.

We followed all of his recommendations and couldn't be happier! We ordered the chopped house salad, the prime Cajun ribeye, the mixed grill Salmon fillet that came with lump crab meat and 4 shrimp (2 grilled, 2 shrimp Alexander ), and the lobster Mac and cheese. All of the food was so good! The ribeye was cooked perfectly. Before dinner was served they brought out a delicious onion roll with butter, and after dinner we got to pick which flavor of Souffl√© we wanted that was on the house (we picked the Grand Marnier flavor) and it was pleasantly light and super satisfying.

I think it must be called Powell's \\"City of Books\\" because it seems like it's the size of a small city. The store is huge and takes up an entire city block. It was definitely overwhelming for me, even with color coded rooms, good signage, and plenty of maps available. Our first time in, my boyfriend and I stopped in on our vacation, and I could only get through a few rooms before we had to leave. The second time we stopped in, it was much earlier in the day and less busy. I loved all the fun displays (like the \\"Books for My Younger Self\\" shelf) and staff/visitor picks. They also have a great selection of souvenir and gift items! We bought a Powell's tote bag, several postcards and cards, and even a Herschel packable backpack. Sort of random, but like I said - even if you're not a big fan of books it's still worth a stop. The free map we got has a poster on the back which is really cool and makes for a nice keepsake.

I ordered a skinny margarita and the waitress informed me their margaritas are already skinny, and I'm not one to argue or ask too many questions of a server so I said fine. What she brought back was absolutely not a skinny margarita - in fact it was barely a regular margarita. It tasted like tequila and a lot of orange flavor, hardly any lime. Lesson learned, I guess. The food is fine but nothing special. Definitely on the heavy side (think lots of fried options and items with heavy sauces and cheese).

Apparently, the usual table was taken, so we were sitting at the low wooden table in the corner of the patio.  I got an Oberon while the group worked on pitchers of Nook Beer (High Life) and $5 vodka specials.  I debated the hot dog covered in tater tots or the nacho totchos, and opted for the nacho totchos minus the sour cream, while the guys next to me got the truffled egg salad sandwich.  While the waitress was friendly enough, the food didn't show up for at least 30 minutes, and probably 45 after ordering.  The totchos were pretty good.  I would have preferred more toppings, since some of the tots were essentially naked, but I still ate them.  I also got some of the truffled egg salad, and that was really yummy, though I couldn't tell that it was truffled. We lucked out and got a rock star parking spot on 13th.

The amazing flavors in the sauces trick the taste buds into feeling fully satiated by the extremely healthy and light ingredients. I love that I can identify all the ingredients in the meal by looking at the warm bowl, and that the meal is as beautiful to look at as it is to consume. This is one of few places I've been to in my life where I leave feeling invigorated after eating a large meal instead of ready for a nap. When I'm having a hard week or need an extra boost this is the first place I think of going. The cons, this place is so popular it is rare to go here where there isn't a line out the door. The line is fast moving and tends to be populated with friendly people but it's still not a quick in and out. If you manage to get them to pick up the phone I suggest calling your carry out order in ahead so you can skip the line. The restaurant is an order at the counter and find your own table situation with a variety of great seating options if you are lucky enough to snag a table at peak times.

For starters, if you have a group over 12 people, you have to dine \\"family style\\" and that costs $60 a person (not including drinks and dessert). That meant rescheduling our dinner club to a date that only 12 could come (versus the 14 people we moved to a Thai restaurant that could accommodate us without an hefty meal price). The hostess on the phone was nice about the reschedule but when we were allowed to come as 12, we were put at a long table by a window and it was pushed so far against the wall that we had to file in and could not get back out without every one on that side having to stand up and get out of their seats. The head of the table was also pushed up to a wall so 6 of us had to be crammed in along the window, whereas the other side only had 5 people, with more room (because their 6th person got to sit at the end of the table). A friend of mine ordered Insalata Bresaola for us to share and another friend ordered Insalata Caprese. Both were better than the La Burina that ordered for my dinner. I suppose I was disappointed in my dinner option because it was dry and not creamy. Because I don't like mushrooms, and asked for them to be held, my plate was a white cheese (which was kinda dry, like mac and cheese gets after a short bit) rigatoni pasta, peas and some Italian sausage. So, I didn't love my meal but I did love the bites of Lasagna my friend across from me shared. I also should have ordered the Pappardelle al Cinghiale - which was pasta with slow cooked wild boar meat sauce and polenta (or what seemed like polenta). That meal looked amazing and tasted just as good as it looked. Our server, Mateo, got everything right and was charming and pleasant. We did our part by stopping for cash on the way like we were told to do but he didn't split our bill like we'd asked, and he agreed - so figuring out the sides and drinks got really complicated. However; he did offer to split it for us, 20 minutes after dropping the bill at our table and after we'd figured it all out. \\nWe were automatically charged 20% gratuity, (18% is typical for large groups), and since we had to pay a mandatory high tip, we expected that we'd get help figuring out our bill. Instead the 12 of us spent 20 stressful minutes trying to figure it all out.

It's not a place to really expand your culinary menu, but hell, they don't price it like that and what they do is generally solid.

Since we decided to start in the German Village area we knew that the newest Fox in the Snow location would be perfect. This rustic bakery + coffee shop has one of the best breakfast sandwiches in Columbus so Kevin started with the infamous Souffled Egg Sandwich and with the plethora of sweets, Fox in the Snow always makes all my sugary breakfast dreams possible. Since I need a little some to balance out all the sweets I talked him into splitting the sandwich which I cannot rave enough about and a custard-filled donut (although I was also wishing we got a cinnamon roll so that's on the plan for next time). In addition to the sweets and sandwich you can also look for items like buttermilk biscuits with housemade jam, ham and swiss tarts, steel cut oatmeal, house-made granola and more. Coffee lovers will rejoice with some delicious options and for those non-coffee lovers there are some tea options - I'm a huge fan of the chai tea latte.

I knew I wasn't going to come back from the moment we drove into the very tight and limited parking. I normally don't care how good the place is, if parking isn't convenient I won't return. My boyfriend and I got the light bulb Peach tea and the matcha bubble tea. It took about 20 minutes to get our drinks, and there wasn't anyone else before us either. I asked for less sweet and it still tasted too sugary. The bf's matcha drink was bland and just tasted like milk. With the competitors next door and all over this area, those are much better options for quality. I do love the cute bright interior. Also, do not try and park in the Tea House Formosa plaza behind.

I told the bartender I would like this sauce over pasta too because it was so flavorful.   The only problem with this establishment was WOW was it loud and it wasn't even a full restaurant so I can't even imagine what it's like when it's full.  I'm giving it the benefit of the doubt that the doors were closed due to rain so maybe it's not as loud in there when it's a beautiful sunny day.

There was cooked salmon salad inside the roll with cucumbers and raw salmon and ikura on the top. It tasted pretty good but my gripe is with the cooked salmon part. I kept finding odd bits of hard bone and salmon fish scales in my sushi roll.

We went with a group of six people, and were looking for an experience and good food.   We let Andrew's wife order since she knew what were great dishes.  The food was excellent, the snow pea leaves (a green similar to spinach) served with sliced garlic was excellent.   The vegetable fried rice was better than I could have ever wished.  The Sizzling Tofu, which was supposed to be vegetarian turned out to have shrimp.  The BBQ Pork was wonderful, and the deluxe noodles which included shrimp, chicken, and other meat was excellent.  \\n          The service though was lacking.  First the food was brought out in stages, not all at once.  First we had rice, then pork, then 3 more dishes, and last about 3/4 into the meal we got the last dish.    Also when we discovered the shrimp we asked for different tofu and the waitress balked at our request, as if it wasn't her problem.  I understand mistakes can happen, but generally I expect customer service to just go the step of resolving the situation, she did not.   \\n         I was very impressed at checkout,  we wanted to dutch the check into six parts but all of us had plastic.   Most establishments balk at the idea of splitting the check, but the cashier took the stack of cards and divided the check and included gratuity making the entire process simple and painless.  That was a huge plus one, which made up for the bad wait staff experience.  \\n        If I could improve something it would add a set vegetarian meal for 4, 6 or 8 people.

Side of sticky rice (recommended by our waitress to eat with the boar collar meat)1. WINGS: so there are 6 whole wings, meaning you get 12 pieces (6 flats & 6 drumettes). At first bite, it was delicious! Salty, sweet flavor - it was bursting with umami. But after the 2nd (whole) wing, I was over it. The flavor was getting too salty for me. I started eating it with the sticky rice just to off-set the saltiness.2. CLAY POT: it came with 4 large prawns, 4 (rather small) pieces of pork belly, glass noodles, and naam jiim seafood dipping sauce for the shrimp.  VERY GOOD. We really enjoyed this dish and the naam jiim was awesome!3. BOAR COLLAR MEAT: this was my favorite dish. It was basically grilled pork with a very flavorful sauce, that had just the right amount of tang and spice. It was really good with the sticky rice, so we were happy our waitress recommended it. Don't waste the sauce! We were dipping our sticky rice in it, as well, because it was so good! My only gripe was how small the dish was, compared to the other 2 we ordered.

The grilled chicken sandwich was surprisingly fresh and was not lacking in flavor.  It had a wonderful, grilled taste.  The macaroni and cheese was also cooked to perfection.  The brunch is just so charming here.  Our group was seated out on the patio on a beautiful morning, so the ambiance was just quaint and perfect.  The brunch selection is pretty extensive- migas, king ranch casserole, broccoli cheese casserole, chorizo/egg, potato/bacon/egg, french toast, kolaches, sausage/potatoes, and the list goes ON and ON and ON.  The brunch scene is very competitive in Austin, but Moonshine definitely holds it's own.  I suggest arriving early, the wait can be quite long.  However, I arrived at about 10 AM and only had to wait 30 minutes. I highly recommend Moonshine for lunch, dinner or brunch."},{"name":"Hat Yai","address":"605 SE Belmont St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"I've been watching this spot since I first saw the signs in the window and and the story on Eater almost a year and a half ago.  I'd liked their original location in the NE (which I'd only stumbled upon after not wanting to deal with the crowds and wait at Podnah's).  Even though I'd been peeking around the butcher paper in the windows during construction, I was surprised with just how big the space was.  The NE location is long and galley like, feeling crowded and requiring the occasional \\"excuse me\\" to make your way to an open seat.  This location is large and spacious.  Tables line the south and west walls, probably a little more than a dozen tables with a mix of four tops and two tops.  The space is bright and airy, with white subway tile lining the back of the open kitchen in the NE quadrant of the space, glass walls from the corner location, bright white and blue plaid pattern table covers, and a fair number of plants do an admirable job of distracting from the polished concrete floor and the exposed, industrial ceiling.I've been twice in the last week, getting the muu hong (braised pork w/a fried egg) and a mushroom skewer as well as the zucchini noodle/khanohmjeen special.  The braised pork was a perfect comfort food - single rice fill bowl, topped with the pork and stew and a fried egg.  Maybe I'm strange, but I really like single bowl meals that can be eaten with just a spoon or a fork.  There's just something comforting about the savory flavors and the simplicity.The noodle dish was exactly what I was looking for - cold noodles for the hot day, with light and bright flavors.  Garnished with lime, and generous amounts of finely sliced shallots, ginger, and Thai chilis providing a nice kick.  The chunks of pineapple were something that I wasn't sure about (I usually find pineapple cloyingly sweet and overwhelming), but in this case, they offset the other flavors well.I didn't order a curry & roti set, but did encourage both my coworkers who hadn't been there to do so, and they both raved about it similarly to how I did the first time I'd ended up in the original location.

We were quoted a wait time of an hour. At the 1.5 hour mark, I went to double check and was told they had tried to text me multiple times but I didn't respond. Note, I had not received anything but chalked it up to them having the incorrect phone number. Thankfully, a gentleman who I believe was the manager found us a table right away. The main reason we ventured down here was to try The Bloody Best which boasts \\"A 32oz glass overflowing with the Best Bloody Mary you've ever had. Featured on Urbandaddy.com, this beast boasts 6oz of Dixie Pepper Vodka mixed with our own spicy Bloody Mary Mix. Then we top it with pepperoncinis, jalape√±os, tots, steak, a slice of toast, lemon, lime, and a hard-boiled egg. You can even choose to get a beef straw to drink it from!\\"We ordered 2! Unfortunately, having experienced impressive Bloody Mary's from several establishments in Nashville (check out my pictures on those), I was JUST NOT IMPRESSED AT ALL. I order Bloody Mary's regularly when I go out for brunch and have tried my fair share of good and bad. This was easily one of the worst. I didn't even want to finish it. Since we ordered 2, I could tell the proportions were not the same between both drinks. The one I had was straight vodka (which I usually wouldn't complain about, but it wasn't tasty). The one my friend had was just the tomato mix and tasted like straight up V8 juice. Our toppings were also less than impressive and looked sad. They forgot our hard boiled egg although we reminded them twice about it. By the third time, I just gave up.Since it was Music Midtown weekend, a limited Festival menu was available. And they stopped serving breakfast items after 3 PM. Since we \\"missed their texts,\\" we sat down exactly at 3 PM and missed our chance to order. I was bummed since the rest of the menu was basically just totchos and burgers. I went ahead and got the Shrimp and Grits stuffed burger since it was the most breakfast-like item. My burger was greasy and not seasoned very well. I also opted for a side of sweet potato fries. When my plate came it had tator tots, I quickly reminded them I had asked for sweet potato fries. The girl dropped off my plate, said \\"Oh, we ran out.\\" and ran away before I could have asked for another substitution. So I was left with a plate of tator tots I didn't want and a burger that was just not very good. No one else in my group cared for their food either. They also only have 2 individual bathrooms inside with 2 portapotties outside so be prepared to wait when they're busy.Worst brunch experience I've had in a while.

Typically I find myself chewing the bamboo endlessly before I can completely break it down but not here! Last but not least, the cha shu was tender; however I do like my cha shu a little more thick cut with a fatty rim around it. This one was on the leaner side. Oh well, still good!

Perhaps because it was just us two.We loved the ambience and enjoyed the food. We both had the chicken and waffles with cornbread as a side. It's one of our favorite meals and we've had it at quite a few different restaurants in several different states. It was delicious! However, when I tell you our waiter was terrible.. I mean it was truly awful service. His name was Octavio and after taking our order, he NEVER returned. He constantly walked by our table, waiting on others, without ever addressing us and our glasses ran empty which, we've never had happen ANYWHERE. We sat there for 35 minutes after being finished with our meals before he finally looked in our direction because I raised my hand to ask for the check. Would you believe me if I told you it got worse? Welp, it did.After flagging him down for the check, it took him yet another 30 minutes just to give us the check. He continued walking by our table, waiting on others and neglecting us. We were both confused and almost in disbelief at how awful he was. I know what you're thinking; \\"Maybe they were a rude couple?\\" No ma'am. No sir. We were polite, friendly, smiling and waiting patiently as he literally danced and hopped to amuse his other guests. I'm not joking. He was dancing. For the other tables by us. Yet we couldn't so much as receive more water after our cups ran empty almost an hour ago.He finally gives us the check. And that's when he refills our cups. He must've known how obvious he had made his neglect toward us because without asking he tried to justify his poor service by saying,\\"I didn't want to bother y'all. You look so cute on your date I just thought I'd leave you alone.\\" Umm.. ok.Octavio ruined it for us and we left even more confused by his excuse. We signed the check and left wondering what in the world caused him to behave that way. I don't know honestly. Maybe it's because we were the only colored people he was waiting on? To think that could be the reason.. I hope not. I simply don't understand what we did and it felt personal. Can you blame us? Two stars for the good meal.

Interesting alternative gins. A small selection of well chosen beers. And some fine fine house cocktails.Very very fine yesserree.I had their chamomile cocktail which is essentially a straight chamomile gin mellowed out with a bit of honey and a minimalist touch of citrus.I'm in love, I'm in love, I'm in love, I'm in love.A perfectly executed classic martini is essentially pure and unadulterated gin, with just a molecule of vermouth and the addition an olive to take the edge off and add a soupcon of complementary flavor.This was the same \\"let the gin be gin\\" formula but with a completely different palette of tastes.This was a drink that was easily as great as a classic martini. *****The appetizer was another triumph.We had the Roasted Brussels Sprouts.Austin has many many fine Brussels Sprouts appetizers and sides.This is up there on the mountaintop with the best of them.Sultanas give it acid and fruitiness. Shallots and toasted hazelnuts give it richness and warmth.My wife and I were both ecstatic.It is rare to see both of us ecstatic over the same dish.*****The main was a Penang curry with salmon.It was the second most expensive item on the menu.It was worth every centavo.The curry was firey enough to be both uncompromising and interesting, but creamy enough to be suave. It burned but it felt good.The vegetables were full of flavor and exactly al dente. The salmon was the ideal foil.*****Desserts here are sophisticated and for grownups.My wife's adult dessert was a very restrained flourless chocolate cake - vegan except for butter.Lovely but you can find something like that in many Austin establishments.My dessert was something special:A chia pudding flavored with banana.We have all had traditional Southern style banana puddings - sweet and creamy with banana as a texture element but not that much banana taste.In contrast, True Food's chia pudding has real bona fide banana taste with very little sweetness whatsoever. The banana was slightly caramelized.I would be shocked if there were more than three molecules of any other sugar or honey in the dish.The chia gives a fascinating hot cereal like texture.They add toasted coconut flakes as a texture play - and in this dessert they work.This was a thoughtful intriguing finale.A fine closing and a great contrast with the rest of the meal. *True Foods is not a cheap night out. But it is a special night out.And you can't beat the incredible location.Wander around Seahold afterwards -Look at the artwork and giant pipes and smokestacks around youThink about the chamomile gin, and chia and bananas inside you ...*Austin is a great town!"},{"name":"Arleta Library Bakery Cafe","address":"5513 SE 72nd Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"I landed in Portland this morning.

I forgot how green and lovely Oregon was, and dining al fresco on the first nice weekend of the year just hit the spot.When we first sat down, I thought Arleta might be a headache. They were out of several things and didn't have any ice for the iced coffee. No matter, we both ordered the Sicilian hash with orange cranberry scone. I've never had a scone with my eggs before, and I was inspired. But let me tell you about something that was truly inspired:  those eggs on top of my hash. Holy good gosh, Arleta! What the hell? What did you do to these to make these SO GOOD?!? I have never, ever, EVER, in all my egg-eating years have I eaten eggs this good. I'm serious as a heart attack here. They were light, they were fluffy, they were the perfect texture. It's like they were whipped with yogurt, or folded with .... I don't know, magical fairy dust, these things were so good.

All we tasted was fried - no artichoke.  I had the duck for my main and it was good, but definitely not great.  The lamb tartare was ok.  And the eggplant olive dip was disappointing.

Instead of breaking up an empty table, they moved one with people pretty much on it, and stuck us in the path of traffic in and out of the place.  Bad decision on their part.  Worse decision that we stayed.\\n3.  Appetizers came out WITH the meal.  Leaving no room on the table for anything.\\n4.  Peking ravioli was way over cooked, fried to a crisp.

I've had all three of the squid ink pastas and I have to take the unpopular stance that the octopus version is my LEAST FAVORITE. I feel like the balances are off and it's just very salty and fishy on the palette. The puttanesca sauce is a lighter and veggie-heavier option that I feel like compliments the umami of the black pasta. The Alfredo sauce will change your mind about Alfredo sauce if you think it's not your thing. I love to get the squid ink pasta with Alfredo sauce and add scallops HOWEVER for the $6 extra you don't always get a good size portion of scallops. The fried calamari is great but heavy if you're also getting a bunch of pastas. I love the squid salad because it's such a huge portion of squid and so light and fresh tasting, but you have to be a hardcore squid fan to enjoy it. \\nFinally the pastas with white sauce where you can add the seafood of your choice are always solid and a great compliment to the black pastas. \\nGo in a group and share a bunch of pastas so you can try lots of things!"},{"name":"Pok Pok","address":"3226 SE Division St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"So disappointed.

What kind of a server rolls up her eye saying \\" what do you want me to do with mice in our restaurant\\".The answer is I wanted you to show concern, being apologetic and bring your manager to our table to acertain us that there is no pest or animal in food or in the kitchen, so maybe we could tell our problems with our service and food to him in the location instead of dragging into social media.That's why my friend ordered green tea only because he was so perturbed to eat the food.But, I am certain if we were some Caucasian patrons or some bleach boys, she would not dare to treat us like that."},{"name":"Big Tree Food Palace","address":"2106 W 41st Avenue","city":"Vancouver","stars":"3","text":"I can't speak for the other items as we only ordered a cod fish plus tofu and bamboo shoots for take out.

Oyster slider is a good alternative if you want to try something light.  Nice fried oyster in a small slider. The fried clam platter was also very good, you get to eat clams and not just crumbs. The fried fish sandwich is not bad, the season fries that came with it was a little salty.  But the seasonings was good.  The burger is huge. A double decker.

Our server arrives 15 minutes later...where was he in an empty restaurant you may ask? Not sure. But he promptly takes our order. 15 minutes later half our drinks arrive. He fails to notice that he didn't bring the other half. Appetizers, yep forgot those too. He comes back another 40 minutes later with 3 of 5 correct meals. No joke, he doesn't take the wrong ones back, but asks us if we would mind eating them so they don't go to waste. They tasted like they had cooked under the heat lamp for 20 minutes which would agree with the timeline. No shame in presenting an incorrect bill either. I can't recall the last time I left a 0% tip but I believe the worst meal I have ever experienced in Vancouver warranted it.

We had the spicy mushroom empanadas, the beef albondigas, the fried cheese with guava sauce (a table favorite), the garlic shrimp mofongo, the lamb sliders, and the Puerto Rican pot roast (overall table favorite!) for dinner. Everything came out piping hot, so flavorful, and was exactly the right amount for sharing. We were stuffed, but celebrating a birthday, we had to get dessert, and I never pass up a Tres Leches cake if they have it on a menu. Topped with a chocolate ganache, oh my goodness, that cake was up there for one of the best desserts I've had in a long time. We also shared a churro dessert with Nutella ice cream, and cleaned every plate! I asked the server if they could make one of the desserts a little special to celebrate, and they came through with a lit candle on the tres leches cake; much appreciated!

It was assembled nicely with a mound of pepper rice with corn and green onions on top, an egg on the side, and the beef surrounding it. It also came with miso soup and refillable pop since I got a combo. Apparently, the best way to cook this is to mix everything together and let the beef cook with the rice to get the most flavour. It didn't take very long to cook at all and the hot plate was definitely sizzling hot! There are 2 sauces on the side that you can add -- one is honey brown sauce and the other is garlic soy sauce. Both were good but I personally liked the honey brown sauce better since it had a slightly sweet taste, whereas the other one was pretty much just regular soy sauce. As for the taste of the dish, I actually thought it was a bit bland without the sauces but once I added the some in, it was good. I also thought the rice was too peppery for me. Thankfully, DC's dish had plain white rice instead so we got half of each other's and I mixed it in with my pepper rice.

There are lots of mango deserts on the menu, some durian deserts, and other Asian deserts such as sweet red bean soup and glutenous rice ball soup. We came on a Saturday night and this place was packed. We had to wait in a line but it moved up quickly. The place smelled like durian, which is something I enjoy, so it didn't bother me. If you are not accustomed to the smell of durian, you might not want to come in here. There were no more spaces at the tables, so we sat by the high counter space by the back of the shop, which was fine. We ordered the Mango Panna Cotta (S3) and the Special Mango Juice Sago & Pomelo with Mango Ice Cream. Both deserts were very delicious. My friend and I both thought that the Panna Cotta should be a soft solid/jelly like texture, but the Panna Cotta in the Mango Panna Cotta was completely liquid. That was kind of weird to us. I have no complaints about the deserts here, but I thought the price was a bit higher than what I expected. Also when the water came, it tasted like bleach. My friend almost threw up after she tasted the water. Obviously, we didn't continue drinking. Other than the high prices and the bleach water, everything else was fine.

There is always a line to get them, and they make it painfully slow and only refill them once in a while. Since there is a que, as soon as they bring out the fresh batch they are immediately gone. I don't even like crab legs, but I've dined with guests that went there specifically for them and it's a PITA to get them. I don't want to make assumptions as to why this is happening, but at the very least it's very poor operational control for the restaurant.Also, I'd like to add that I received a charge from them a couple weeks after I went and an instant credit for ten dollars less than the charge.

AGAIN.  I think I have 5 reviews of the north location and here's Number 1 of the south.  When I lived in Cedar Park, Soto somehow treated me both like a Rock Star and family member at the same time.  And it's not just because I'm ME :)  They do this with a lot of their \\"regulars\\" as evidenced last nite by all the patron hugging Chef Andy was doing.  So, after moving south 6+ months ago AND not even touching sushi since, walking into this new location was a bit like coming home to me.As others have stated, the quality and creativity of food here is just as stellar as the north location, although the menu has been pared down quite a bit to it's most elegant and thoughtful components.  Chef treated us to a mini omikase last nite where we got to pick elements from each section of the menu so were able to sample all around, from the foie gras gyoza, to nigiri, flaming salmon, rolls, and ending of course with the Green Tea Tiramisu.  Once again, every piece was artful in its simplicity and delicious in it's multiple levels of flavors in each bite.  My favorite of the nite was the \\"Potato Chip\\", which was a house made thin potato chip topped with salmon belly over rice (sorry, devoured before I even thought of taking a pic).  To this Keto girly, this was an almost lethal pleasure as I gasped upon tasting it and almost choked over it.  We also swooned over the snapper nigiri and the fatty tuna (\\"tuna butter\\" as i call it) nigiri.  Each topped simply with a hint of truffle or cilantro or sea salt.  And, as BFF and I were sitting at the sushi bar, every time we tried each new item, Chef was there with this boyish expectant look on his face, truly taking pride in his dishes and modestly accepting all \\"oooooh's and ahhhhh's\\" given in return.I was just commenting to my hubby the other day, that now Soto is officially in Austin, they hopefully will get the credit they deserve on all the \\"Best Of\\" Lists.  And they have gamely located themselves literally across the street from that other Best Sushi place winner.

Our local friend also highly recommended this place. We called in at around 5:30pm and they told us that the wait was about TWO HOURS. Okay... a bit of a long wait, but I wasn't surprised, and we were willing to wait. So we check-in and walk around Division Street to pass the time. Two hours later, we get our table. The restaurant's atmosphere is incredibly reminiscent of being in China and eating food streetside (I know this is Thai food). The semi-outdoors vibe which was an homage to the Thai streets and bars in which this food is served was blended excellently with the comfy and ambient vibe of a casual restaurant. The food they serve can be a little intimidating to someone who hasn't ventured much into Thai food, but this place welcomes you for the journey with open arms.We started with their iconic fish sauce wings. The wings were incredibly juicy and easy to eat. The sauce packed many different flavors. You first get hit with the pungency of the fish sauce, followed by hints of soy and garlic, finally the burn of the chili seeds sprinkled on the wings. They're incredibly enjoyable to eat, although I do have to say that them alone can be a bit salty, and that the pickled vegetables are there for a reason!Moving on to the main dishes, I want to start off with the best dishes we got, in my opinion, which were the Laap Meuang (pork salad), and Kaeng Hang Leh (pork belly curry). The Laap was super fragrant, with the flavor of the minced pork playing incredibly well with the spice mixture, crispy bits, and cilantro. But the thing that really brought it all together was the sticky rice, which really made a perfect bite. Yes, it can be a little bit unfamiliar to grab rice with your hands in eat like this, but trust me, it really is the best way to eat this dish! The pork belly curry was just excellent. The pork MELTS when you put it in your mouth, and all the flavors of the curry has seeped into the meat, making it incredibly juicy as well. This is such a great curry dish, and a must-get when you come here.The other dishes we got were the Kung Op Wun Sen (claypot prawns and noodles), Sii Khrong Muu Yaang (ribs), Hoi Thawt (mussel pancake). The claypot prawns were my friends' favorites, maybe because of how similar it was to Chinese food. Honestly, you can't go wrong with glass noodles. The prawns were great with the sauce it was served with. It gave a tangy and sour punch that complemented the sweetness of the prawn very well. The pork belly helped to round out everything. The ribs and the pancake, however, were definitely the weaker dishes. They were good, don't get me wrong, but they just weren't as good as the other dishes. I don't think I like Thai-style ribs by preference, because I felt like it was a bit inconvenient to eat the meaty ribs. That being said, it was marinated quite well, and the sauces it was paired with was very good (you'll notice this place knows how to make sauces). Word of advice: don't just use the sweet or spicy sauces exclusively, you HAVE to try them together, it does wonders! Finally, the pancake. There wasn't anything wrong with it, it just wasn't anything outstanding, but the sauce was really good and brought most of the flavor (again, they're really good at sauces). It also reminded me a bit of b√°nh x√®o, which is pretty neat. I would say you can skip out on the ribs and pancake since there are definitely better dishes on the menu.Overall, I really enjoyed this meal. While some of the dishes weren't the best, I really appreciate what this restaurant is trying to do. This is one of those restaurants that really want you to go out and explore more about a cuisine. It's a unique experience that is hard to find in the US, and makes you realize just how surface level your knowledge really is about Thai food. Forget pad thai, I know what Thai dishes I'll be craving now!"},{"name":"Summer Moon Coffee - Buda","address":"316 N Main St","city":"Buda","stars":"4.5","text":"Omgoodness, I could have sworn I already reviewed this place.

I had been hearing about Dish Dive since then.  Yesterday I decided to make a reservation and check it out.  I wasn't disappointed.Dish Dive is located in half a house.  They have one table for 6, two for 4 and two for 2.  Yes, it's that small.  The intimacy of the seating does not lead to any private conversations but the food is worth the lack of privacy.Note that all alcohol is BYOB.  This is not listed on the website but everyone seemed to know.Our server was very nice and efficient.The entire restaurant, minus one four top, was seated within about 10 minutes.  This made me concerned for the timing of our meal but that worry was unwarranted.We ordered the roasted chicken, a hanger steak and the carrots - as a side.  The carrots were not delivered as a side (which I would have preferred, but as an appetizer or salad.  Ultimately, when they sat there and we saw the other veggie dishes being delivered to the other table the same way, we decided to eat them before they were cold.  The combination of carrot, dried blueberries, walnuts, frisee and the delectable garlic ranch dressing was great.  The only criticism is that the carrots were barely cooked and very hard to cut with a regular table knife.Our entrees were delivered with excellent timing.  My chicken was well beyond what I anticipated.  The broth was so flavorful and the chicken was super moist.  The chicken was fall off the bone tender.  I normally won't order \\"just chicken\\" at restaurants but I was extremely happy I did.My husband's hanger steak was very tasty, although could have used salt and there wasn't any on the table (pet peeve).  His green beans were also very good.  He didn't leave a morsel on the plate.

I did make it mild as far as \\"spicy\\" yet it wasn't the spicy that hurts. Nothing was over powering each other; the coconut milk, lemongrass, galangal, kaffir leaves with the mushroom and chicken.. it was refreshing. Period.

It used to be one of my favorite coffee shops in all of Austin, but I've grown increasingly agitated with the establishment. I order the same drink religiously and I never deviate from it. While looking at my bank statement, I noticed that I have paid the same price 14 times for my go to drink but I have also paid different prices ranging from 3-5 dollars for the same drink 12 times. I have brought it up with the staff and they shrug it off and attribute it to the casualness of the East Side of Austin. I almost felt a bit disrespected having a white guy tell me, a Black woman, about the culture of East Austin. Maybe he was referring to its current and longstanding status of being heavily gentrified. I prefer diversity in all spaces. Including my coffee shops. It's sad to see East Austin lose its deep Black history to overly monotone and singular coffee shops that caters to the increasing white population. I said all of this to say that I would recommend this place for people who can go about their lives without noticing that there is only one Black person in the room or that everyone else is white like them. This place is for you if you too like to gentrify areas where deeply rooted cultures of African Americans have been established for generations. This place is for you if you are audacious enough to recreate and redefine the culture of East Austin and tell a person from there what it is.

They have a good amount of selection for seating and we snagged one in the shade outside since it was such a nice day. I ordered the five and dime, my friend got the farmer and we ordered the hashups to split. I also got their specialty coffee: the maple vanilla iced coffee. The food came out pretty quickly and the friendly staff walked it to my table since my hands were full. The biscuits were good, but just good. They were flavorful but tasted a little stale and not flaky, like I would've preferred. The gravy was good, but I can probably think of a handful of places where I like their gravy better. We did NOT like the hash ups at all; they were not seasoned, the veggies were mushy and did not go well and the ham was pretty uncooked. The farmer was scrumptious but the \\"apple butter\\" that they pour on it is basically apple sauce - not what we expected. The coffee was overbearingly sweet and tasted of straight syrup that I couldn't drink more than a couple of sips. Overall a disappointing experience that I did not expect.

Let me break it down for you\\". He then proceeded to describe the most popular dishes on the menu and some of his favorites - not just what the ingredients were, but the geographic and cultural context of the dishes and the EXPERIENCE we would have with each one. Dining at Pok Pok is more of an experience than at most places. From the menu's robust description of each dish to the waiter's instructions on the correct way to ball up our sticky rice to firm it up and then eat it with our papaya salad, it definitely made going out to eat worth it. Dining out should be more than just consuming food. With Pok Pok's cheery and humble interior, and it's impeccable service, it's clear they put a lot of thought and effort into making sure your appetite for culture and legacy would be filled as much as your appetite for food. But let's be real: for as fancy as the words or the decor might be, if the food at the heart of those garnishes doesn't hold up, then the entire experience falls apart. Luckily, Pok Pok is pretty great. The wings they're famous for are a bit salty and overpriced, but they are delectable and worth trying at least once. The Papaya Salad was a delightful surprise in that it wasn't loaded full of sugar like most Thai restaurants; quite the opposite, it was fairly spicy and we were glad to have that cutely packaged sticky rice to go with it. We also tried Muslim style beef curry soup, which was perfect on a chilly, rainy day. Don't make the mistake of not eating it right away, because otherwise the fried noodles on top will get soggy. For kicks we went with the Cha Ca \\"La Vong\\" (yes, you must also try pronouncing all the names of the dishes too, that's part of the experience). It's a catfish dish served on a bed of noodles, and it hit all the right notes in terms of texture and flavors. Pok Pok is a Portland staple worth visiting at least once. It's quite unlike any food you'd typically think of as Thai.

We went on a Thursday evening at 6:40. Our first time through the buffet line half the pizzas were gone. Our choices were basically cheese pizza or pepperoni. My husband asked about supreme pizza and they said \\"15 minutes\\"- he checked on that supreme pizza three times and every single time they told him \\"15 minutes\\". I don't even think they served supreme that night. The salad was good but the dressing came out too fast so I had way too much Italian dressing on my salad. The dessert cinnamon rolls were decent. And a plus is free refills on the soda. The restaurant was super dirty though, I didn't see a worker clean a single table and every time there was an open table it was snagged within minutes, so that's kind of gross.

I discreetly asked the waitress to bring a new menu and explained what happened. She proceeded to stand next to our table in this crowded dining room and wipe the butter off with one of their cloth napkins. It took her about 2 minutes, but felt much longer with other diners noticing. Then she handed the greasy menu back to my husband. A less cramped table could have helped avoid this accident and the butter incident could have been handled so much more professionally.

Nick, our concierge, had said \\"before you even look at the menu, get a couple fried oyster sliders\\" and damned if he wasn't 100% right & spot on. Sweet little buttery rolls surround a crispy but meaty fried oyster. And I'm not sure where they are getting fresh greens and tomatoes in the dead of winter - is there an insulated warehouse/greenhouse somewhere in Boston where they're getting these things? Awesome. So the oysters: exceptional quality, nice variety, and shucked just perfectly. And the staff is totally trained and knowledgeable about all of them. Freshness is showcased; we came back 2 days later to a somewhat altered menu, proving they care and pay attention to this a lot. Case in point was a change from Halibut Crudo to Fluke. Also a rotation in the oyster lineup happened - and they make a point to inform you on the menu which small farm and small farmer brought what. \\nThat's total respect for the ingredients! Yeah, so like I said, we did return for more sliders and some late night soup. This is the best 'Chowdah' I've had in Boston so far. Chives (big ones diced coarse) bacon chunks (thick little squares) good little potatoes (not too big or too much) great clams, and the kicker is the mini biscuits they substituted for traditional oyster crackers. Said biscuits are toasty-crunchy but still soft enough (plus dry) to soak up that delicious base. Wife had lobster minestrone, which was also amazing. Finished with a couple more oysters and washed down with deliciously authentic North Shore NEIPA. Pretty much perfect.

It is thin sliced, so it doesn't retain much moisture when cooked. Being a wheat meat substitute, it didn't jive well with the wheat bun. The combination was literally wheat on wheat and it was rather dry. I had to dock another star from 3 to 2 because the owner appears not to know the restaurant menu. The Philly Cheeze sandwich does indeed have a \\"cashew cheeze sauce\\" as specified by the menu and not the \\"sweet potato nut-free cheeze\\" that you claim. I have tasted cashew cheeze several times and it tasted like what was on the sandwich. Additionally, I encourage everyone to read the menu to determine this fact for themselves. It says \\"cashew cheeze sauce\\".I wish I had more time to try another dish on the house, but unfortunately I did not and needed to be somewhere shortly after eating. It is normal for a restaurant to be hiring people, but in my experiences so far restaurants that place employment ads on their storefront often have a high turn over rate. Probably not the case for Counter Culture, but I didn't see this sort of advertisement on any of the other 10 restaurants I visited in the prior 4 days.From my quick glance, the kitchen appeared to be clean, but the human waste smell coming from the metal barred water damaged wood door (with significant paint peeling) was pungent every time I walked by it and definitely shocked my appetite. That door leads to one of the bathrooms inside, so it makes sense, but it suggests there is a sewage leak of some sort or another. It was not the smell of fish and it was emanating from that door specifically. Original Review:This is a review specifically oriented around the Philly Cheesesteak. I guess I ordered the worst item on the menu. This was not a good dish. The seitan is a dryish wheat-based meat product. They combined it with a dry toasted wheat bun. The only moisture in the dish came from the cashew cheese and the jalapenos. I had to drink about 3 full glasses of water to finish the dish. It was not what I expected.The jackfruit and beans with BBQ sauce was basic. It was chewier than it should be. I have had jack fruit in several Asian vegan restaurants and it was always much more palatable.If I enjoy a vegan meal in the future, I think I will return to the original: Indian food.\\nSide note: the restaurant has a fairly strong human waste smell coming from the side of the building on the sidewalk area. The place definitely needs better upkeep as there is peeling paint and rotting wood, etc. I was somewhat worried about the hygiene of the restaurant. Another bad omen was their advertisement for a line cook that was posted on the front door. It gave me the feeling that there is a decent amount of employment turn over at this establishment."},{"name":"Din Ho Chinese BBQ","address":"8557 Research Blvd, Ste 116","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"Easy!

The menu is limited so the hope was that the choices would each be perfectly executed.  Unfortunately, that wasn't the case. I was really looking forward to the fire roasted half chicken which sadly turned out to be a slightly over cooked boneless, skinless chicken breast. No crispy skin anywhere. Big disappointment. The farro accompaniment was the winner on this dish. Perfectly cooked and well seasoned. The lemon fusilli was too thick and gummy for pasta and not a great attempt at homemade. The pistachio pesto was flavorful and added a nice texture. So, the saving grace was the sauce. The \\"chips and dip\\" appetizer got me excited for a great meal....it's unfortunate that the appetizer was the most well executed dish. The host was friendly and accommodating. The server seemed inexperienced. When I asked about the beer list (which is ultimately the highlight of the experience - unique with a variety of options) he didn't really offer much helpful feedback other than they were listed in order of lightest to most full bodied. Overall, the food was a disappointment and overpriced for what it was. The service was only saved by the host. The server never actually came back to our table except to offer dessert. We declined. My recommendation would be to wait until they get the kinks figured out - hopefully before the floors close for good.

If you go during dinner when the line is out the door, as you're standing towards the back of the line, you should place an order by phone. Then, when the line has progressed to where you are in the middle of the line, you could cut the rest of the line and go pay for/pick up your food at the front.When people pre-order and pick up, the combination of the pay/picking up transactions, plus answering the phone, takes the time of essentially one of the two cashiers. The last time I went, there were probably close to 10 people picking up pre-orders over the 25 minutes I waited in line.Suggestion 1: reroute the phone line to the back office and have another staff member take calls. This would keep both cashiers in action.Suggestion 2: customers pre-pay for their pick up orders using credit or another non-cash form. Then, move the pickup station away from the cash registers.Suggestion 3: utilize one of the many undergrad/grad business schools in Boston/Cambridge - contact the operations department and ask if any of their operations classes do (pro bono!) projects with local businesses to help provide recommendations on how to make things run more efficiently."},{"name":"Pok Pok","address":"3226 SE Division St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Ordered the wings, a half chicken, a noodle soup, a carrot/cabbage/shallot/peanut slaw-type salad, chicken skewers and sipping vinegar.

I had to work late and wanted to bring pizza home. I called early because I knew work was going to get crazy. I asked for them to make it to be picked up at 5:30. When the girl confirmed all the info with me she said \\"and to be picked up at 5:00.\\" I corrected her, she apologized and then I hung up and went about the rest of my work day. I went in at 5:15 expecting fully that I would have to wait. Lo and behold my order was ready? I paid (a lot) with tip and left. I thought the boxes felt cold. I asked the girl if they were made a while ago and she said \\"No...they just came out of the oven?\\" Okay? Off I go.I get home, open the box, and they were cold!!! They were so chewy it hurt my jaw to try and eat them. The Fig and Prosciutto with Blue Cheese had NO Blue cheese. The Eggplant was gagging me because it was not properly prepared and the skin was inedible. I was SO disappointed because everyone in town RAVES about this place. It was $48 for four 9\\" pizzas so it should have been AMAZING! I bet you'll notice that I still gave it 4 stars. You know why? Because they owned it!! I called and the manager took the call. He was SO accommodating and apologetic that I will DEFINITELY will go back. I always give restaurants at least 3 tries.

It was about 50 degrees outside and about 100 degrees inside.  7:30PM on a Thursday and the line was about 15 deep. At first, my husband and I took a quick tour downstairs before getting in line. We didn't realize this was a pickup window type of place, There aren't too many places to sit and these are not traditional tables/chairs. I heard a reference to an \\"opium den.\\" \\nThere was a duo warming up for their acoustic, bluegrass set and people lounging around on various couches as if it was a living room.We went back upstairs and grab some menus while waiting in line. I am not a vegetarian but I love all food, especially vegetables. The main \\"filling bowl\\" choices seem to be variations of the same thing. I literally just picked one without giving too much thought- the Rebel. It was very tasty, but I wish they had included just a little more tofu. I also tried the Pure Alive juice for $6.25 (the one with wheat grass); it's 12 oz. I knew right away this would be a high fiber \\"where's the bathroom\\" kind of drink. It was served warm but it was tasty and certainly went with the veggie hippie vibe theme.\\nThey do serve draft beer here, which I think is a little weird considering the healthy menu items. Seems contradictory. After placing our order we were able to grab a comfortable corner downstairs and a staff member brought down our bowls. We had a nice meal... but it was also nice to finally get back outside and get some fresh air. It was so hot in there!

There was almost a 30 minute gap between food arriving.   When you have a group of 8 people everyone should be able to eat together.   Instead it came out in pairs of 2 and it took almost an hour to get the food out. Same with drinks, it took almost 40 minutes just to bring a beer.   We had to remind the waitress multiple times to bring extra ginger, wasabi, and spicy mayo.   PARKING: The parking price is decent, unfortunately this place does not validate parking a and we were not offered like other restaurants nearby.  They are suppose to have Valet, but there was not anyone working the area, plus it was raining so it made it worse.  Overall the food is great, but for $150 a couple it's not worth it based on the poor service.  Hopefully you get lucky and have a better waiter/waitress.

The broth was a bit heavier than other, more traditional Vietnamese pho places, but it was still quite tasty.  Lot of meat in the dish, perhaps a bit too much noodle (had a good chunk left in my bowl).  Even so, the balance was still good; would maybe characterize it as slightly more catered to non-Asian tastes, but still good nonetheless.

I stumbled upon this lovely cafe about three weeks ago and I was fortunate enough to meet the owner, Devon. Upon entering the cafe, he warmly greeted us and gave us a quick tour of the place. There are two huge bookshelves stacked with board games and a chess board is set up near the front window for any Board 1, superb chess players that are ready to show off their moves. The cafe is still growing - on 12/10/2013 the cafe received their license from the Dept of Health to serve coffee and pastries and I think the owners are hoping to serve other food and beverages by the end of the year. Aside from coffee, the owner did go out of his way to mention that they will be offering hot choc and tea. If you're just looking to chill in their comfy lounge, admission is free and there's complimentary wi-fi! There is an admission price  for those that are interested in playing the board games - $10 for those that are just stopping by and checking it out. For those that are more serious, you can become a member of the cafe for $15/month and admission is reduced to $6 per trip plus you get one free beverage per visit. If you want to play board games all day, everyday, you may want to purchase the premium membership for $120 per month - which buys unlimited admission for the month and complimentary snacks and drinks. The cafe has a partnership with Eureka - so for anyone that is in dying need to own the board game that they spent 10+ hrs playing at the cafe, they can just go across the street and buy it! http://www.eurekapuzzles.com/I know that the owners are hoping to host events and Devon was kind enough to offer me a very generous discount since I had mentioned that I was part of the Big Sister Association. On 12/10/2013, my little sister and I took him up on the discount and we spent about 3 hours just relaxing and playing some board games. Devon was super cool and even looked up some words to see whether it was legit for scrabble points. The cafe is still doing some soft openings but I know that they are going to be open till 11 PM during regular business hours. If you want to make sure that they are open, check out their website and give them a call before heading over - http://knightmovesboston.wordpress.com.

We were able to easily find parking on the main road in front of Bluestar Donuts (yes, we got donuts afterwards :P). Party: 4 adultsWait time: No wait (Yes! I know!

Tam Khanun* (spicy jackfruit salad)*spicy with Thai chili's (you've been warned!) - you can adjust the spicy level if you can't handle the heat.Also, the water is infused with pandan. I think that's new because I don't remember that the first time I dined here. I love it! It has a very light and aromatic nutty flavor (think pistachio). Price: ~$100 for 5 dishesService:  Quick and attentive. Friendly. Ambiance: Feels like I've been transported to Bangkok in Portland with Thai country music playing. So magical.THE FOOD:FYI my taste palette: I like food that are spicy and bold in flavor.1. Vietnamese Fish Sauce Wings: This is my second time having the wings, and they are as good as I remember! Sweet, sticky, savory, and salty. 2. Pok Pok Papaya Salad: This was good (not amazing) because I prefer the green papaya to be soften some more by the pestle and mortar. I also like it with long beans, so the dish seemed lacking. I would love if they offered the Som Tam Poo Ma (with blue crab). :P I think papaya salad goes well with fried fish. In Thailand, I always eat papaya salad with a whole fried fish and sticky rice.3. Moo Satay (pork skewers): There's 5 skewers. 4 triangle bread slices, which is the authentic way they serve it in Thailand. Dipping sauces: white vinegar cucumber sauce and peanut sauce. (My mom told me some Thais like to use the skewers to pick at the cucumbers and eat it.)4. Pla Thawt Samun Phrai (fried whole tilapia): If you can't eat meat that still resembles the animal, you shouldn't eat this. This dish was okay. It tastes like fried fish, but I was expecting it to be stuffed with herbs or spices that would make it more flavorful and aromatic. I prefer other fish dishes like Pla Sam Rot (3 flavor fish) or Pla Kapong Neung Manao (steamed lemon fish), which they don't have.5. Tam Khanun (spicy jackfruit salad): AMAZING. Young and tender jackfruit accentuated by the minced pork and cubes of crispy deep-fried pork fat, and the ginger, garlic, shallots, and julienned kaffir lime leaf. This is my first time having this dish, and it was my favorite out of all the dishes I've had! It's very tender and flavorful! Note: Northern Thai dishes are mainly eaten with sticky rice, which is eaten with your hands. Sticky rice is easier to pick up and eat with your hands than steamed rice. Steamed rice is eaten with utensils. Overall: Pok Pok is still one of the best restaurants to dine at in Portland. The decor and music are authentic. The food is still better and unique than many Thai restaurants, so I would come back again when I'm in Portland. :)"},{"name":"Dunkin'","address":"1421 S Narcoossee Rd","city":"Saint Cloud","stars":"1.5","text":"Just a regular Dunkin' Donuts with ok customer service.

The greeting was good, and the personalized printed menu did make me take notice.  The atmosphere is great, but need to keep the menu close to the candle (in the iron pig which was very cool - I want one of those!).  Where is started to go downhill was when our waiter disappeared for 10-15 minutes (I actually do still wear a watch, and kept track). This was *before* the drinks order! The wine list is pretty good, even to my standards.  Even after apologizing in a showmanship manner, it didn't work as while the drinks were served fast, it was another 20 minutes before the appetizers showed up, and then another 30 before my steak showed up.  My wife's crabcakes evidently were incredible, however when taking the first bite of steak, the outside was lukewarm and the inside was cold in the middle. Cold? For a medium rare steak?  Even rare should be served at at least 110 degrees!  Also so much for leaving the steak out to warm before cooking. I never thought I'd have to send a $55 steak back to have it heated again. Even after that, it was just ok. It was the prime ribeye (for those interested).  Ruth's Chris, El Gaucho, and Ringside beat Morton's by far.The waiter was especially pushy with the desert and after dinner drinks, which by now I was not interested in. We'd been there two hours and I was done. So a $200 dinner for two was pretty much a bust. Will I be back? Not for steak - because who wants to go to a steakhouse for seafood?

The food in this place is not worth the hype at all. This is our first time in this restaurant and will not be coming back. The only item that is good in this place is the fish sauce wings - but it was still just ok, nothing extraordinary. If anything, the fish sauce taste is too pronounced that it ruins all the other flavor the wings are infused with. Aside from the chicken wings, we also ordered the Tam Khanun (jackfruit salad), Laap Meuang (minced Pork Salad) and Kaeng Hang Leh (Sweet Pork/Pork Belly stew curry). the Kaeng Hang Leh tasted decent but the first two item did not have any taste at all except spicy. You would think that with all the spices it is cooked in, the dishes will taste better but it didn't. The flank steak was so overcooked that it was so dry to the taste. It didn't taste good at all. I guess I should have learned my lesson and ended my dinner then (btw the portions were really small) but I gambled and ended up ordering the mango ice cream for dessert. I asked the server if it was homemade, he said yes. The ice cream is definitely not home made. I should know, I've made my own homemade ice cream before. My husband ordered the ice cream sandwich, and the bread it came with is several days old bread that is already dry and crumbly instead of soft and moist. This place is a big disappointment.  Could we have possibly just ordered the wrong entrees and that some dishes are better? I guess we will never know since we are not coming back.

We got the crazy roll (tempura fried California roll), spider roll, California roll, and the cucumber salad.  All in all the flavor was good, but I think the transportation of the food in the enclosed plastic container caused some problems.  The crazy roll ended up gummy and chewy - I think the oil from the tempura seeped in and made it soggy.  I think if we'd eaten it immediately at the restaurant, it would have been more crispy.  The regular California roll was tasty, but my friend did not like that it was covered in fish eggs.  The spider roll was good, but a little too oily - the flaky batter tended to crisp off and taste just like oil in the roll.  But the cucumber salad was amazing.  It had a lot of lemon juice, and I found the acid quite refreshing.

It can get pretty noisy when it is peak dinner service, but the overall ambiance and the food that's meant to be shared add up to a pretty great date atmosphere in my opinion. I'm also guilty of popping to Lucy's right next door to have onion rings for dessert, but I don't go to a restaurant like Burdock & Co expecting mountainous piles of food. I go because of their conscientious menu selection, the ambience and to share the really full, rich flavours with someone else. tl;dr\\nWide variety of flavourful tapas plates in a romantically lit atmosphere that can get a bit noisy when it's a full house. If you're looking to leave stuffed to the gills and feel like you've made the most bang for your buck - go next door to Lucy's or the sushi joint."},{"name":"Pho Basil","address":"177 Massachusetts Ave, Ste A","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"Such an amazing place for Vietnamese food. Just like the other reviews say, this place is totally worth it. Came in and waited about 15 minutes for a table. The place is a bit small, so better for smaller parties. I ordered the spring rolls and a Tai pho and everything was incredible. We asked for chicken in the spring rolls and the flavor really matched with the rest of the roll. The peanut sauce was so tasty and just the right texture. The pho itself was so delicious! The broth was the perfect amount of flavor, the noodles fresh, and there was a good amount of beef. The portion was also huge, so a great deal for the price! Overall such a good experience, made a good dinner choice~"},{"name":"The Nook On Piedmont Park","address":"1144 Piedmont Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3.5","text":"The tater tots are good!

The decor was delightful.  But in the end NONE of that mattered due to the bizarre, alarming, and hostile behavior of the server.  My lunch was wrecked because I kept having visions of the cook, who had disappeared from view.  I imagined he might be bloodied and in need of medical attention somewhere in the back.

I'm terribly jealous of the residents of Portland for having such a remarkable treasure like the Powell City of Books. You walk in and it's literally an evil mastermind's labyrinth. Think MC Escher but with book and you'll get the idea. I felt like I needed a little German boy to walk through the store with me dropping little bread crumbs so I could find my way back through the forest of trees. The people here take their literature quite seriously and there's a fantastic selection of the most obscure books ever.I found myself thumbing through a book of Chinese homeopathic remedies just around the corner from a Berlitz \\"How to Speak Korean\\" which was was steps from Americana Lit. which had some of my favorite authors. I could swim through the books and make little book angel patterns while giggly and drinking hot cocoa from the Cafe. In all seriousness though, do map out a game plan for visiting this place. Bring a list of books you're looking for-don't dawdle! I found myself lost in thought for over 4 hours when I only had a 5 hour layover in Portland because this place is just THAT good. I found a copy of \\"Cat's Cradle\\" from the 70's for $3 and a copy of \\"Catcher in the Rye\\" which was brand new for only $5. You just can't beat picking up a old book and breathing in the pages and feeling the cracked book binding. It gives me a mental boner as some of my friends would say. And not only do they have books, but they've got the cutest knick knacks, notebooks, pens, wine openers, purses, and gadgets. I swear, the ADD kicks in and I have to pick up every bright color, every bottle opener shaped like a penguin and every keychain shaped like a luchadores.

With Border's filing for bankruptcy and Barnes & Noble the last national chain selling printed books, it makes Powell's that much more special in its own right. Not only is it a tourist attraction when visiting Portland, but this place indeed has the largest inventory of in-stock books anywhere. With 68,000 square feet of books in nine color-coded rooms, you could find something for every interest or curiosity. I could just get lost in here for days and days, with so much reading material. I was able to find some first prints of books, albeit used, that I was not able to find anywhere else. With that being said, new and used books are shelved next to each other, so you can save a couple bucks if you don't mind buying a used book. Prices are very reasonable and you may find yourself walking out with tons of books. While you're there, you can also stop inside at World Cup Coffee & Tea to enjoy some coffee, tea, pastries, cookies and sandwiches.Powell's is an adventure in its own.

We had made reservations for a party of 5 the night before which was a good idea as we heard the hostess tell those who did not make reservations prior were waiting for an hour to get a table. At first glance, the decor is pleasing to the eye. There's alot of red and Chinese decorations. There is an injection of modernity with the red glasses (which turned out to be decoration as they were taken away upon us being seated) and plastic woven black and white chairs. All in all the staff was nice although we had to wait literally half an hour before we got our water. Our waitress was not very attentive but the older gentleman who brought out our food was very nice and fulfilled any requests that we had. Organization among the wait staff seemed to be not great and they were just be really slow despite being so many of the on the floor and not all the tables being full. I'm hoping it's because they are new and still getting used to the system. I do have to say that I felt like they did not receive enough training and that is why it was slow and kind of just all over the place.  In terms of food, it was outrageously expensive. Sure, I get it. It's a casino and it's supposed to be extravagant. We are not the type of people who complain about prices but these were not consistent with the quality of food that we received. The dim sum were 8.88-9.88 for three pieces. THREE. Yes you heard that right. Below I'll go through the different things we ordered. We did double up on some of the dim sum dishes like the dumplings and etc however our total came up to about $180 something before tip was added. Here's what we got:-Pork Wontons, Red Chili\\nThe wontons were hard and kind of dry. My mom compared them to rocks. Served drowning in chili oil with a little too much vinegar. -Almond Shrimp Balls \\nNot sure but the almond didn't seem fresh. Fried almond balls should be crispy but when we bit into these they were kinda soggy almost like when you leave nuts in a bag without sealing them? They just didn't taste right. -Steamed Prawn Dumplings\\nNothing special. Just normal shrimp dumplings. -Steamed Shainhainese Pork Soup Dumpling\\nThe presentation was cute with the little carrier baskets but I no one was impressed with the dumpling itself. The wrapper was super thick and doughy, not very delicate like the typical soup dumplings. I guess that's how no one ended up tearing theirs when trying to unstick their dumpling. The dumpling itself was like the pork wonton inside, hard like a rock with a very salty broth. -Steamed Chicken Feet\\nNothing special. They weren't served sitting in a puddle of oil which was nice. -Pan Fried Pork and Chive Dumpling\\nNothing special. Just normal pork and chive dumplings. -Assorted Barbecue Platter\\nThis was probably my favorite thing and really the only thing that we all agreed was good. It was a combination of the roasted duck, barbecue pork, and crispy roasted pork belly. The duck and barbeque pork was on the greasy side but not tough. The pork belly was cripsy albeit a bit on the hard side. -Kung Pao Shrimp\\nServed swimming in an incredibly salty kung pao sauce. Probably should consider asking for a cup of hot water to rinse it off a bit. You'll definitely need to order a bowl of rice to share to eat this without getting hypertension. -Pad Thai Flat Rice Noodles with Shrimp\\nI honestly didn't touch the pad thai since I don't like pad thai but judging by how both of my brothers barely grabbed any, it was at best nothing mindblowing.

Each patty had their distinct taste and flavor. The falafel burger was surprisingly good considering it was not even a meat burger. Spanish beef was probably the best of the bunch. Burgers are well presented and wrapped in a thin paper sheet and served to your table by name.The fries are fluffier because of their circular potato chip shape.\\nThe spicy garlic wings were quite large.

Giving four stars because service was a little slow (food was quick, but they were slow with the check, didn't bring sugar with coffee, etc.) We sat on the patio, which is kept well-cooled although outdoors and is nice in the Austin heat. Beware of over-ordering...we ordered some shareables  and then an entree each, but portions are very generous so we were stuffed! Favorite item for the table was the fried green tomatoes...best I've ever had! They have a cornmeal crust on them that was crispy and surprisingly light, and the tomatoes are perfectly cooked and juicy. They are topped with shrimp and a red sauce and on a layer of aioli, all of which balanced nicely and were incredibly flavorful. Grit cake was nice to look at, but a little too rich for me, even with the tangy greens on the side. Chicken and waffles portion my friend ordered was huge....all chicken thigh and nicely done, but wasn't a stand-out. My shrimp and grits were divine; the shrimp were perfectly cooked, grits were smooth and rich, and the red sauce underneath was had a kick and perfectly cut through the grits...seasoned and spiced very well. We did not order drinks but there were plenty of offerings. It can get busy, so get there early before the lunch rush."},{"name":"Skyline Chili","address":"8550 Orion Place","city":"Columbus","stars":"4","text":"A small restaurant with various booths and tables. The blonde haired woman at the front counter was really friendly.  I ordered the chili and it came with onion, shredded cheese, crackers, and hot sauce. Unfortunately, the chili has a strange taste to me; as if it has cinnamon in it and other odd spices that I don't feel should be in chili.  The meat in it is very fine, making it more like a sauce, than a chili."},{"name":"Powell's City of Books","address":"1005 W Burnside St","city":"Portland","stars":"5","text":"I give this place 4 stars, because of the amazing book selection.

I'm not sure what else to say except this place is a really good fit for the neighborhood, has outdoor seating, a cool and friendly staff, and excellent food and drinks. Right next to the green line too -- so it's easy to get to!  And when we left there was a girl walking by with a nine week old beagle puppy. I mean, how can you not love that? In short - no matter what your taste in drinks or food is - you will find something to love on the menu here. Five stars! Give it a try!

Service was decent but you shouldn't have to keep reminding them to give you more coffee. $3 btw, which ain't cheap. I had chicken tamales that were flavorless. We asked for salt and pepper but it did not save them. They poured an iced cold green sauce on the plate.  And sprinkled a bit of feta (this, imo, was a strange addition). I thought this dish was gross. My friends had chicken biscuits and the biscuit was tasty. The cinnamon rolls were ok. I will wait for an hour in Miami for the Knausberry Farms' cinnamon rolls, so maybe I am biased, but I think you can be more satisfied at the mall food court. Their rolls didn't seem fresh and were on the dry side. I am in the minority here, but whateva.

The physically uncomfortable visit was due to the fact that the central air system was not in working conditions that day. With the humidity and heat, it was just an unpleasant experience, which is fair, out of their control. The restaurant is service animal friendly, which is not publicly notated. While I do not have a problem with service animals,  I am severely allergic to animal dander. The service animal was seated right next to us... I did not complain or ask to be moved because I didn't think it would be too much of an issue.The ambiance and decor of the restaurant is gorgeous. There are grand canvases hung along each of the available walls. If you have an opportunity to wander, definitely take a moment to appreciate the wall art. You can tell that the restaurant was understaffed when the establishment isn't at capacity, few large parties, and what feels like an eternity to get a server to come by to check take your order, check on drinks(empty water glasses in a hot restaurant for the entiretyof the meal), or ensure that everything you order came out ( had to wave the server back to remind them that the food we had order did not come out and to take it off the bill 2x)... 2/5 stars for service. Grande Blanco Sangria - $37, pretty decent size, lots of fruits, made with Torres Imperial 10yr Gran Reserva Brandy & Gran Torres Orange Liqueur... 3/5 stars.ESPARRAGOS A LA PARRILLA - $7 Grilled asparagus with evoo was  amazing, 5/5 stars.PORTOBELLO RELLENO - $10 One giant portobello stuffed with manchego cheese and sherry cream spinach was delicious,  5/5 stars.CALAMARES FRITAS - $10 what should have been fried squid, shishito peppers, parmesan¬†cheese served with house aioli turn out to be a pile of soggy underseason breading with chewy squid, 0/5.MARISCOS paella - $36 Lobster, scallops, shrimp, squid, and mussels was unfortunately was overcooked. The rice was undercooked and over salted... the mild chorizo was  tasty, presentation was gorgeous ... really wanted to love this dish, 1/5 stars. GAMBAS AL AJILLO - $14 Saut√©ed shrimp in a beautiful merriment of garlic, onions, chilies, sherry  and  brandy was phenomenal.  A must try. Shrimp was cooked perfectly, 5/5 stars.PICANHA - $15 Skirt steak and  roasted mushrooms topped with  chimichurri was good. The steak was cooked unevenly, but that really has to do with the unevenness of the meat.. roasted mushrooms were tasty and the chimichurri was good... 3/5 stars.RABO DE TORO - $13 Braised oxtail was not fall off the bone tender, cooked in red wine, served over undercooked saffron rice, 0/5 stars.TRES LECHES -¬†$8 Meringue cake itself was pretty dense in texture, ¬†the cream wasn't sweet, and there was a hint of ¬†nutmeg... I was disappointed , 0/5 stars.CREME CATALANA - $7 Spanish style cr√©me br√ªl√©e was soupy and warm. I think it was sitting out too long that it melted and the carmelized sugar on top was uneven ( missing in parts of the dish and a thick pool in other parts) , 0/5 stars."},{"name":"Pok Pok","address":"3226 SE Division St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"We got takeout from Pok Pok tonight. Here's my breakdown of what we ordered for three adults and three kids (all 5 and under). I highly recommend putting the rice cooker on before you leave , that way you can really stretch this meal/ save a couple bucks. Sunny's Yam Wun Sen Chao Wang - spicy glass noodles with meat, mussles, and veggies thrown in the mix. They are spicy (3 out of 5 stars, we'd say). It's nice and light, the noodles to vegetable ratio was good. A nice side dish if you like spicy stuff. Kaeng Hang Leh - ORDER THIS! Yum! So good! It's a bunch of super tender pork in not spicy (but SO DELICIOUS) curry/ savory sauce. I'm writing this review so I remember to order this next time. Khanaa Waan Phat Naam Man Hoi - SPICY broccoli. Spice level 5 out of 5 stars. Honestly, since my brother and sister in law tasted this first and told me how hot this was, I didn't try this. Brother said that in addition to the spice, there was a very mild sweet taste to this. I would not order this again for myself. Kai Yaang - chicken. Delicious! Not as good as the pork, but still quite delicious. I would order this again! It's sweet.

Skip the chorizo one, it's the pricier one but it's nowhere near as good.\\nSalmon tartare. This is raw salmon with sesame seed oil among other things. Steer clear if you don't like the taste of sesame seed oil (although i don't know who doesn't) as its a strong flavor in the dish.\\nOyster sliders. Fried oysters in a delicious bun with aioli sauce.
