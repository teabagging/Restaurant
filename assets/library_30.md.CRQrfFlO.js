We had an early reservation on a Friday evening. I do love the atmosphere as many other reviewers have mentioned. I love the small plates concept and so was really looking forward to sharing some unique dishes with the Hubs. From the regular menu, previous posts inspired us to order the squid fries. They were good, but not great, although definitely potentially great. Ours were not so crisp on the outside as they should have been, which caused them to go soggy quickly. We also ordered the brussel sprouts, which were only average. From the \\"daily\\" or \\"weekly\\" menu, (not sure which since our server did not offer an explanation), we were tempted by the pig's ear lettuce wrap, which turned out to be VERY good, and local quail. My query about the quail got the following response from my server \\"hey, it's quail, what can you say.\\" Implication being that of course it was great, but I'm pretty sure the chef could have figured out something else to say to explain the dish. Our server was about that interested in explaining everything else as well, although he did manage to give brief explanations when pressed. \\nI ordered a bottle of wine (hey, it was a celebration!) and my husband a (relatively) local beer. We were disappointed that they didn't offer more local selections, given that we have lots of AWESOME beer in this area. I was even more disappointed that the wine was delivered without a chiller, which, when requested, took at least 15-20 minutes (and a reminder) to receive. I left a good part of it behind as it became too warm to enjoy. \\nWe did add a fifth plate, the albacore, and I have to say that I am SO glad, because it was amazing. They really are doing great things in the kitchen, but the front of the house needs a LOT of work. I will say that the folks who actually brought the food to the table did a much better explanation of what we were receiving, and maybe should be taking the orders, since they would have probably given us the descriptions and enthusiasm for the food that we were looking for. \\nBottom line, we were looking for a special experience, which is what I think one should be able to expect when paying these prices for both the small plates and the drinks. A server who is not only familiar with the food, but enthusiastic about describing it and offers recommendations (beyond - hey, you definitely should order at least 4-5 plates to start and then see where you're at!) is a part of that experience for me. Unfortunately, we won't be back - there are several other places in town offering this kind of experience and doing it beautifully."},{"name":"Dave & Buster's","address":"2215 D And B Dr SE","city":"Marietta","stars":"2.5","text":"I haven't been to Dave and busters for a long time.

The games were fun, we put our name in at the restaurant and an hour later they called me.  That is where it went down hill.  My wife ordered fish and chips a \\"fave\\". Which I thought meant a favorite but was actually an overcooked greasy price of cod.  It was supposed to have Parmesan crusted chips but it came with dry potato chips.  My chicken was overcooked, the veggies were cold.  We sent it back and said we didn't want anything else.  The waitress brought the bill and only took off one item and said she had to use her own employee meal.  I said I won't pay for it, she sent the manager over and he didn't want to take it back, he accused my wife of eating all of it and not wanting to pay.  I asked for the general manager, he couldn't find him and decided to take the items off the check.

We got the bbq spare ribs, crispy tuna spring rolls, pork nachos, and buffallo cauliflower. Every thing we sampled wsa pretty good. My favorite and the stand out dish of the bunch was the cauliflower. I know what you are thinking but it was delicious and I don't even like cauliflower. I am not sure if it was fried up but it seemed crispy somehow and had the distinctive buffalo sauce and the obligatory blue cheese dip. It was so good that I  am actually drooling as I write this thinking about it. My second favorite was the crispy tuna spring rolls. I am still new to eating tuna (never been my go to) but I thought it was well excuted. The ribs and nachos were ok - of the two, I would probably order the ribs again because they fell off the bone nicely but the pork nachos were uninspired.\\nWhile it is nice that they have valet, I believe it is over-priced.

It was thick, soft, but with a toasty crunch. The biscuit sandwich is a testament to how Portland makes wonderful biscuits. Fluffy, moist yet firm and buttery. The chicken itself was battered just right and the cheese really brought everything together. I saw they had jalapeno butter, and even though it doesn't go with this item, I ordered it anyways. My arteries may be clogged but damn was it worth it. That jalapeno butter takes it to a whole new level. I wish I had some condiments or gravy for the sandwich, but it was still moist and delectable without it. For appetizers, we tried the bacon wrapped dates and chocolate potato donuts. Both were absolutely fantastic, but those dates are worth ordering (even if you order just one). We didn't have to wait too long, but it took quite a bit of time for the food to come out.

(More details on how this ordering issue was resolved later).\\n\\nFood: 3 Stars\\nService: 2.5 Stars\\nLayout/Seating: 2.5 Stars\\nSauces: 3.5 Stars\\nShakes: DNP\\n\\nI ordered the limited time special - #21 Korean BBQ Burger - and my date, the #11, The Skinny (a turkey burger but she said I had to order by the number and not the name...). Since we both enjoy sweet potato fries, the \\"shareable\\" portion seemed the best option. \\n\\nThe burger was cooked to order - medium well with a touch of pink - and the lightly fried kimchi along with the sweet BBQ sauce on a brioche bun was a pleasant but not super taste experience. (When your hometown local restaurants offer superb burgers on OHB brioche buns, chains fall far down the list, IMHO).\\n\\nThe Skinny was reported as dry and tasteless.\\n\\nBTW, \\"shareable\\" sweet potato fries = super-abundant. More than enough for the two of us.\\n\\nThe sauce bar of 8 different flavors is worth exploring. We enjoyed the apple cider and Chipotle.\\n\\nLayout/Seating: while waiting to order, the line curled towards the sink, which if you want to wash your hands is convenient, but to stand there while strangers wash beside you is uncomfortable. Also, we initially sat beside the soda fountain machine. As I was the last to sit, to my immediate left was the machine and if I had ordered a soft drink, I'd only have to reach up to fill up. Maybe if the restaurant had free rain ponchos...not. We moved instead. \\n\\nTable service- while B21 does not offer it, a member of our party who is not very ambulatory, asked for and received a number of items from a very kind B21 employee.\\n\\nLastly, if you made it this far in my long review (congratulations! You're probably the only one!), a member of our party left the line to inform other B21 employees of the long wait.

Seriously, it's all about sharing innovative small plates and presentation with people you enjoy being with, and now we have Swift's Attic. Just the idea of going out to gorge on a two-pound mass of steak drenched in butter seems a little silly to me now - I wanna leave a restaurant ready to party, not pass out.\\n   \\nNow here's the bad news: If you're a Veggie/Vegan, forget-about-it. Our time will come, but right now, you're going to look pretty stupid demanding pork cheek be substituted with a tofu scramble, and they're not going to do it for you anyway. FWIW, I see meat and fish more or less as seasoning rather than sustenance these days whenever I make a Barley Swine or Swift's Attic run, and I calculate I'm doing less than three ounces of flesh among six or seven plates during the night. Well, good for me, and isn't that a lame rationalization? Probably, but I've never felt the need to purge immediately afterward or kill myself either. If you think of life as a \\"one-day-at-a-time\\" kind of thing, some days will be exquisite food day.\\n\\nThe Nuts and Bolts: On a Saturday night at 10, this place was jammed packed with every tiny black dress in town, and had to be one of loudest restaurants in the Universe. The two of us went there on a last minute whim, we didn't have a reservation, and we played it straight: \\"If you can fit us in, cool - if you can't, that's cool too.\\" Within ten minutes, they gave us the coolest two-top table in the middle of the room. Thank you Karma, and it was going to be a big tip night from me. I thought our guy Liam seemed a tad distracted at first, I couldn't hear most of what he was saying, but then he too became enchanted with Melissa A's hypnotic Green-Eyed Lady charm. And then the food started rolling in.\\n\\nThe Food: Welcome back, my friends, to the show that never ends. We skipped the apps and went straight for the plates: Scallop slivers atop cucumber sorbet and rock salt, pork rillette spread on grilled sourdough with fig preserves and mustard, an oxtail and mushroom flatbread - just one \\"ohhh\\" and \\"ahhh\\" after another. Their trout was so wonderfully crisp and succulent that when we were almost  finished, we casually looked around, and then lifted the bowl and drank deeply of its magical broth. It was almost a religious experience. Everything you have heard about the \\"Popcorn and a Movie\\" and \\"Chocolate Six Ways\\" desserts are true: You'll want to scrape every tiny morsel off your plate, and you'll want to lick that tiny last smear of chocolate, just because you're not wasteful. Okay, maybe that's just me.\\n\\nThe \\"Say What?\\" Moment:  The only plate that flummoxed me was the tiny octopus with antelope chorizo and Corona beans - I kind of thought I was nibbling a dish of gummy worms. I just didn't get what they were going for here, aside from putting together stuff on a plate that had never been put together on a plate before. I'm first to admit when I'm confused, and here you go.  It wasn't exactly a \\"meh\\" moment for me, but more of a \\"huh?\\" \\n\\nThe Invidious Comparison between Barley Swine and Swift's Attic: I just think the food and presentation at Barley Swine is simply the best, and I'd be there a lot more if I could find anyone willing to share plates with me late at night, which is the easiest way to deal with Barley's no-reservations waiting list and limited seating. But I don't think that makes Swift's Attic any less of a \\"go-to\\" experience either: The prices of both places are similar, this stuff is obviously all subjective anyway, and that's what makes eating out in Austin a fun thing to do most times. Maybe another way of looking at it is asking what you think of Franklin's BBQ: Would you still be eager and excited to be there if you had to wait two hours and discover they've run out of stuff? You either will or you won't. And if you're leaning toward the \\"It's not worth the wait\\" side, then definitely take advantage of making reservations for Swift's Attic, and get ready to marvel at their small plate experience. I'm pretty sure you'll have a great time."},{"name":"Cafe Agora Midtown","address":"92 Peachtree Pl NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4.5","text":"I've eat lunch here several times and highly recommend.

When we sat down to eat the service took incredibly long and the waitress spilled beer all over the table, and when she finally came back to clean it up (because we had no napkins at our table, we couldn't clean it up ourselves) she used a few beverage napkins and didn't properly clean it up.

I keep waiting for my socks to be knocked off and I try all these highly rated restaurants here and leave happy, but not thrilled. Until Beast. \\n\\nBeast is transcendant. It is the magic unicorn of dining: highly coordinated, concerned service from knowledgeable staff, a cozy and intimate setting that still allows you to have proximity to others, but private conversation. An amazing wine and  beer list (even for PDX) and I'll go more into the food, but the price, for what you receive, is a tremendous value.  No, its not something you'd do every night, but I've easily paid 2x as much for a dinner of this caliber. \\n\\nFrom the time we came in for the 8pm seating, they were already working on our second course and watching the staff turn the restaurant is like watching a symphony at work. We were seated and though there are only two community tables, we somehow had enough distance and space to not have to talk to our neighbors if we didn't want, and to feel a sense of intimacy. \\n\\nI skipped the wine and went with beer and was insanely thrilled with the options, 2 beers that I had never had before or even seen on a list. A mild sour and an phenomenal porter that was light and juicy (for a porter). My dinner mate had the wine and supplemented it with a few extra glasses here and there. \\n\\nThe food: I won't go into every dish here, you can read others for it. I'd rather talk about how it felt. The dishes were not so overly complicated that you would be challenged to like everything in each of them. Instead, each had a fabulous balance of texture, color and taste. A velvety soup had satisfying crunchy bits and a hint of vinegar to finish. The duck was prepared so perfectly that it melted on your tongue. The cheeses were the perfect after dinner accompaniment. \\n\\nBut I need to talk about that second course, the charcuterie. As a singular dish, it goes down in my top 10 of all time. It is bombastic. Executed as almost a clock, with a small taste at each hour. We watched the staff create these plates over an hour, carefully and thoughtfully. And each bite was an adventure on its own, finishing with a foie bon bon that will be the best thing you EVER put in your mouth (totally worth the TWSS I'll get here). \\n\\nWe were thrilled with everything.

But...\\n\\nThe bad: I was here on a recent Sunday morning and there was a line out the door (which is a good sign, right?).  Luckily for us, there were two seats along the small bar the runs along the front window where they will serve you breakfast.  We started with Mimosas while eyeing the bar proper (the full size bar with comfortable seats) where it looked like several parties were wrapping things up.\\n\\nBe forewarned...  SUNDAY BRUNCH AT HIGHLAND KITCHEN INCLUDES LIVE (*AMPLIFIED*) MUSIC!  Don't get me wrong.  I love live music.  But when breaking fast on Sunday morning I'd rather enjoy the conversation with my companion(s) without having to  shout over live music (and all the other patrons who are also shouting over it).  If I was in charge I'd have the amplification was turned down a few notches, or have the band play unplugged.\\n\\nDespite the noise, we decided to stay because we've heard so many good things.\\n\\nBefore seats opened up at the full bar the hostess offered us a table. \\n\\nWhen we were brought to our table we were seated in a row of tables for two with approx. 6 inches between tables where we waited at least 10 mins. before anyone acknowledged our arrival. Thankfully, the hostess brought the menus when we were seated and we were ready to order as soon as our server finally brought us some water.  \\n\\nWhen our food arrived we realized our silverware service was missing forks. Since we already had our food no one from the service team was paying us very much attention so I finally had to get up and go and tell one of them we needed forks.\\n\\nAlso, that seating arrangement sucked...  Having breakfast with 20 people I've never seen before is not my idea of a good time.  Don't get me  wrong, I don't begrudge the owner's desire to maximize restaurant revenue, and I didn't expect a private booth either.  But for Sunday morning breakfast it would be nice to give the patrons a little breathing room.\\n\\nThe good: The food and drinks were delicious and there were many interesting choices.  So much so I'd even consider going back *IF* I were dining alone and/or not expecting to have a conversation with anyone. \\n\\nAnd I'll probably give Highland a try some evening when drinks, loud music and noisy crowds is to be expected.

Hoping they iron that out.\\n\\nOnce they determined that no, I hadn't been served (I would think that standing there for 10 minutes without a white bag in my hand would've indicated that), they got me my biscuit and gravy. Open it up... man. This thing is smaller than my palm. And I have tiny lady hands. On the plus side, the chicken is cooked very well. Juicy without being underdone. Crispy on the outside. Yum. But the biscuit was tiny and... I don't even know how to describe it. Overdone and chewy at the same time? I don't know.

But is Beast worth five stars when compared to the price? and particularly for someone who can cook an amazing meal themselves? It's hard to say. For many people Beast would be the creme' de la creme' of meals... but for people who lament over recipes and meticulously create amazing meals at home I would say this ranks up there with what a talent home cook could so with a a sous chef and a wait staff to plate their food for them. Don't get me wrong the meal was fabulous and a splendid night off from the kitchen... but there just seemed to be an inventive uniqueness that didn't ever come through... Everything thing was perfectly prepared, beautifully executed, and all the while I was left with the question. \\"Where is the wow factor?\\" Even smaller less distinguished restaurants are traditional in their take on the indigenous culture of food... but at a 68dollar per person price tag, plus the 35 dollar wine paring per person... and coffee at 6 six dollars a night out for 250.00 for two is quite extravagant in my book and something I would expect to walk away feeling like I'd had the best food-gasam of my life.... \\n\\nMaybe another time, maybe another palate of tastes.... Beast puts forth a solid effort for well executed selections... if you want a safe bet and a romantic night out... this is your place... if you're looking for value, ingenuity, and risk....

It's been almost 2 years since my visit but it still stands out as one of my favorite meals. The charcuterie plate was delicious and seems to stay on the menu from week to week, which is good. The foie gras bon bon was really delicious and I wish they gave me a whole plate of just those instead. :) The cheese plate that day came with marcona almonds and table grapes with drizzlings of local wildflower honey, which I really appreciated as it was simple yet tasty. Another stand out was a lobster bisque with truffle oil. You can bet I tilted and scraped the bowl with my spoon to get the last drop. The tables are communal, but I didn't mind as each group received the same course at the same time, making the experience less awkward since people won't be staring at others' food.

The service is just okay, which is what keeps me from giving them four stars.  It just seems they never have enough wait staff for a sit-down place that has as much volume and quick turn-over as they do.

She had my husband's name and phone number, but somehow couldn't find our reservation. We got a table nonetheless. The server barely greeted us, and as this was our first time at the restaurant did not make suggestions. At one point we told him it was our first time and asked for suggestions. He pointed to a few items, but didn't really seem excited about anything. Later on he hit my husband's coffee with his hand, knocking it into the saucer. This is a harmless enough mistake, but he didn't bother cleaning up the mess.\\n\\nWe started with the biscuits and gravy, which were pretty tasty. My favorite part of the meal really. We then ordered two cocktails. My husband ordered the whisky smash which was good and I had the Sunday Morning Coming Down, a gin based cocktail. The fernet taste in the cocktail was so overwhelming that I did not finish it. In retrospect I probably could've asked to have it fixed, but I didn't feel like bothering the server. We ordered the chicken and waffles and the skillet. The chicken and waffles were pretty good, but half of the plate was cold. The chicken and waffles were tasty though I would've preferred less waffle and maybe some brussel sprouts on the side to round the plate out. Everything was cooked well on the skillet, especially the pork, but I felt the dish overall lacked flavor.\\n\\nI had higher expectations for this restaurant, considering how awesome Ravenous Pig is.

The hostesses were really young and very unorganized. It looked like they did not know what they were doing. We waited anyways. The wait was actually less than 45 minutes (about 25 minutes) which was great but once we sat we had to wait even more. We started with the biscuits (the portion comes 3) as an \\"appetizer\\". It took over 25 minutes just to get those out to us. The waitress barely checked on us while we waited. She seemed REALLY overwhelmed. Once our food came out, food was great. I ordered the chicken & waffles and my husband ordered the ribs. However, service was very poor throughout the whole time. They might have been understaffed or something. I was really hoping for this place to be good because it is so close to my house. However, I would much rather go further for better service and food. Also, the price of the plates are too expensive for the portion. Sweet Cheeks Q in Boston is better and has better prices and portions.

They could have easily doubled the number of biscuits (ingredients: flour, water, salt, butter) while leaving the amount of compote and cream the same, and it would have been a much better value.\\n\\nIn general, I would recommend not ordering any of the small plates.

My boyfriend got a chicken sandwich- I can't remember the name but it was fried and had coleslaw- which I hate coleslaw- but this sandwhich had the best fried chicken I've ever tasted in my life and the coleslaw was paired perfectly.

They also changed to table service instead of self serve, which I would usually be excited about, but it's been pretty slow the past two times I've been. And the cocktails are much more watered down tasting than before- they used to be amazing! It's still a really cool place to go- large outdoor area, plenty of seating, good for kids... but not worth the trek out there anymore. I hope they go back to what they were doing before!\\n\\nOriginal review: Wow. I have no idea why this place is rated low by some- maybe it's improved since their reviews were written, but I had a GREAT experience there! \\n\\nMy husband and I went on a Saturday afternoon. We both got the \\"Old Texan\\" cocktail which was absolutely delicious- at $8 each, they were well priced for the quality. We split the peppers and aioli ($6), which were pretty darn good, but the best part by FAR was the chicken biscuit. Sweet Baby Jesus. At $8, it may be more expensive than your average Chick-Fil-A chicken biscuit, but my goodness, this was far from average! Some of the best fried chicken ever smothered with this awesome hot sauce that's the perfect amount of spicy, and the whole thing drizzled in honey. And it was HUGE! My only complaint was that it required many many napkins to consume it :-) \\n\\nSitting outside was very pleasant and there are chickens and cows that are great for the kids to visit. The inside was spacious. I imagine that during peak evening hours it probably gets crowded, but it seemed like there was plenty of room to sit or stand. There is a big lawn outside so if we go again, we might bring a blanket to sit on in case there is no seating.

It's just your typical, run-of-the-mill dim sum shop that will suffice until you can get out of Boston and get some of that \\"dayum\\" dim sum. My girlfriend and I came here last night and ordered about 5 dim sum plates and 1 beef with broccoli rice plate. The dim sum plates were shrimp and spinach dumplings, turnip cakes, spare ribs in black bean sauce, shrimp rice noodles, and another dish that must have been too mediocre for me to remember.\\n\\nDim Sum Dishes ($3.50 each)\\n1. Shrimp and spinach dumplings: Pretty tasty with fairly large shrimp chunks, but only 3 dumplings\\n2. Turnip cakes: Again, pretty tasty but would have been nice if they could crisp the outside a little more. Also, I prefer soy sauce over hoison sauce with these (good thing they had soy sauce on the table!)\\n3. Spare ribs in black bean sauce: Great flavor, but extremely small portions. Just a handful of tiny ribs that were largely just bones. \\n4. Shrimp rice noodles: Nondescript. Not much flavor and lacked sauce. Texture was also lacking as it lumped together into one uncut noodle.\\n5. Don't remember: because everything else was meh, I'll say this one was meh too. \\n\\nThe beef with broccoli was what really filled me up. It comes as a heaping plate of rice with a decent amount of beef (tender... so tender there wasn't really any texture...), carrots, and broccoli.

It was another 10 minutes before the server came and took our order. The food came out literally 30 seconds after placing the order. The meat was dry and chewy, like eating leather. And it was not hot at all, warm at best. The mac and cheese seemed like they made it last week and microwaved it. The beans were meh. The cornbread was good and our waiter was nice.

Carbs with carbs on top of carbs drizzled with carbs, finished with a light carb-cheese zest. That's cool, because dad likes turkey breast, and he saw it on the menu, and he was glad. No sides or anything on this bad boy, but it's in-house made turkey so...\\n\\n\\"I's pretty good Dej, taste like fresh.\\" When you get that kind of reaction, you can't hate.

Since Anjali was asleep in her stroller it seemed like a good time to try out the place.\\n\\nIt was superb. Moqueca is a traditional style of cooking fish in a clay pot. I tried out the Fish Moqueca and Mihir, rather tamely I thought, took a Steak and fries. Everything was delicious. The fish stew was light and fragrant, flavored with cilantro. It tastes very similar to Bengali preparations of fish and I was hooked and homesick. We had ordered fried plantains on the side and it was among the best I have ever had. Mihir's steak was pretty good too, at least he loved it. It came with an unusual sauce and a small bowl of delicious beans. I have noticed many South American restaurants have this side of stewed canary beans that contrary to their appearance, taste heavenly. One more reason to not order those ubiquitous fries.\\n\\nThe wait was a bit long, enough that we started to get antsy, and I sent Mihir off to the kitchen to see if he could rustle up some appetizers or even dessert for us to start with. The staff, very sweetly, suggested that we wait for our meal as it would be substantial. How often does anyone say that? So we waited, and it was good that we did because after we stuffed ourselves we still had enough to pack for another meal.\\n\\nA lot of the people there seemed to be regulars, always a good sign, and all the plates around  me looked good. A couple next to me wanted to play it safe and ordered everything that looked deep-fried. But in a place like this playing it safe seems unnecessary. The decor strikes a fine balance between a cozy, laid-back atmosphere and an ethnic aesthetic that does not overpower you with souvenirs and artifacts. It's the kind of place that invites you try it out once as it looks exotic and different but once in you realize that it's everyday enough for you to keep coming back.

When serving, you need to be a bit more tactful in how you say things.  If you don't like a dish, you can say it's not your favorite and you prefer something else.  However, do not tell a customer what they can and cannot order!  This only annoyed us when the sweet potato dish came out and we really did not like it at all!

The happy hour is very resonable, as well as the items that are not on the happy hour menu.

The chicken plate came with a generous amount of chicken and rice as well as two salads and grilled veggies. The waiter messed up and sent over baked muscles instead of the potstickers, when we advised him we did not order that item, he said it was on the house and also brought the potstickers over quickly.

I ordered the vegan sausage with saurkraut on a baguette (the pretzel bread is not vegan) and while it was pretty tasty it was also quite small for the price.  Throughout our visit the waitress was more attentive, but her visits were still a little too spread out for my liking.  On our way out we picked up a few loaves of bread which were really fresh and reasonably priced.

I walked in about 9pm in hopes of grabbing some drinks and apps before mtg some friends out later that night. I took a seat at the bar (which was roughly half full) but immediately the bartender made it uncomfortably obvious that she was super stressed and way too busy for any sort of acknowledgement of any kind. It took about 10 minutes before i finally got the bartenders attention (which took a ton of effort on my part)..I asked to see the cocktail list and she returned with the drink menu only to inform me she was Not making ANY of the specialty cocktails on the menu then walked away. I asked if the kitchen was still open for food and i got nothing more than a \\"yes\\" for a response. Up until now, this was the first and only interaction I had with with the bartender since I arrived..no simple hello, welcome, i'll be with u in a moment, little smile or wave of recognition....Nothing!! So now I finally have the cocktail list but why I'm not sure cuz she made it very clear they were not making anything on it.  The group of 3 next to me must have arrived at the right time cuz they were allowed to order off the drink menu. They must have overheard my drink menu dilemma and assured me I wasn't missing anything as far as the specialty cocktails were concerned. Their goal was to try to finish at least half so they didn't feel so guilty about spending $13.00 on each. \\n    I ordered a stoli and soda but the soda H2O was completely flat. I sat there for 10 more minutes trying to grab someone/anyone's attention behind the bar so I could request a splash of cran to try and muddle the taste of my bubbleless beverage but no such luck. After being ignored (as I debated just flat out leaving out of frustration) I couldn't help but notice a twiggy green leaf with brown edges floating around the bottom of my drink. I finally get the bartenders attention and calmly inquire about my new discovery....oh yeah and the flat soda water. She reassured me that it was \\"probably just a garnish from another drink that got mixed in by accident\\" and she swears it wasn't a dirty glass. Boy i felt so relieved after hearing that! Are you serious??!! She said she could make me a new drink \\"if i wanted\\". At that point it was easier just to decline. I had officially given up on any chance of redemption. \\n   At this point I'm beyond famished, still without so much as a food menu in front of me.

The asparagus was crispy, but cooked, and the potatoes were perfectly cooked, while retaining a nice crisp outside and plenty of flavor. YUM all around.\\n\\nBoth guys went with the Chicken Parmesan (don't ask me why they didn't share), which was your typical breaded chicken topped with mozzarella cheese, baked in a tomato sauce and served with pasta.

I think they both felt the chicken could have been a BIT crisper, but overall, it was tender and so full of flavor. And the sauce was delightful.

The tacos come out fast, wrapped in tin foil, and hot.\\n\\nIf you get a taco with everything, it comes with onion, cilantro, and spicy green salsa.  You can get each of these things at the salsa bar, so it might be a good idea to add them yourself.  I once got my tacos \\"with everything\\" and they lit my mouth on fire (and I love spicy foods).  The tacos come wrapped in two soft flour tortilla shells, but even they are not enough for the sogginess of the ingredients.

One thing I never understand at this Cheesecake Factory is that they call my buzzer and let me wait for another 10 minutes every time. Anyway, our waiter seated us. At first his service was pretty decent, he took our order very carefully, even kneed down to the floor because he couldn't hear us very well. We ordered bufflo chicken meatball and decided to share Louisiana chicken pasta since we decided to save up our appetite for some cheesecake! He offered us water as we wanted pretty fast and then VANISHED. And things went down from this point. Nobody brouht us any bread or butter, we just sat for our meals with an empty stomach for over 20 minutes since the restaurant was packed. Here comes the worst part, our meal came out before our appetizer! How ridiculous was this! My boyfriend and I were so starving that we even didn't care about this \\"accident\\". The waiter who  brought our entree ( not our waiter) heard about our meatball didn't come, he asked us whether wanted to wait for it first, we just too eager to eat and  let it go. When we almost half done with our meal, the appetizer came out,  as I imagined, it was cold. I don't know how long it was seated under the heat lamp but it was definitely not fresh. I was pretty irritated by what happened there, but to this moment, our waiter even didn't show up once to check on us or refill up our water. I just finished our meal really quickly and decided to leave ASAP. Right before we finished our pasta he showed up with the dessert menu, I just ignored him and asked for the bill. I left without having the piece of cheesecake I was craving for, that's how pissed I was.

First of all, I didn't think it was possible to make \\"bad\\" Indian food. I know I've had excellent to possibly okay but I have never had the occasion to throw away my left-overs as I did this time, the food is only part of it though. \\n\\nThe service was the worst I've ever had anywhere. We were greeted by a young man who was nice but totally bizarre. He asked us what we'd like to drink and I asked for a Coke, he repeated, \\"Diet Coke\\" and I corrected him, \\"Regular Coke, please\\". He said they were out of regular but then he didn't offer an alternative so I had to ask. Fine, no biggie, I got a Sprite in a can I had to ask for a glass of ice - I only mention that because after ten little things, they all add up. Alright, so then we asked if he could tell us if the naan was vegan. At first he said yes, then he said no, then he asked what vegan meant. At this point I'm getting a little frustrated because he's not being honest but still, I explain what vegan is: no meat, no dairy, \\"no eggs - I think some people may refer to it as strict vegetarian\\".  He says, okay, does not tell me whether the naan falls into this category but, instead, proceeds to recommend a dish with cheese. I ask, \\"isn't paneer dairy?\\" and he laughs nervously; again, I ask if it isn't cheese and finally he says yes. Still trying to be nice because even though he's completely screwing up he seems *nice*. Then we finally straighten the entrees out and we order the combo per his suggestion, when I ask again about the ahan, he says he will go ask (novel idea). He returns to tell me that the naan is not vegan, he isn't sure what's in it but it's not vegan. I wait for some sort of suggestion which does not come so I bite and ask if another bread is - perhaps the roti. He says happily, yes! the roti is. So we ask to substitute it, generally not a big deal and they're the same exact price but! no, we can't do that. I am now a bit annoyed, it's taken like ten minutes to get anywhere and one already-made bread cannot be substituted? He tells me that they will deduct it from the price! I guess my composure got misplaced at this point because I heard myself say, 'that's the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard of!: I got up, can of Sprite still unopened, and as I was leaving my seat he said to wait, that he could substitute with roti afterall. So we said okay, despite feeling that the experience was so lousy we should split the way you know you should the first time the crazy comes out in a relationship. \\n\\nNow for the food. I get my yellow dal and my husband get chana masala - these are fairly common dishes we've had a hundred times so what could go wrong. Well, the dal was bright yellow, looked like it had jelly in it (probably corn starch), and was room temperature. My husband's chana looked more promising and was warm but that was about it. They were both bland - I didn't think that was possible either but I'm here to tell ya, it is! It's totally possible and it is pretty terrible, the closest comparison to the dal is probably baby food. The side of fried cauliflower was probably not bad at one time but mine was cold and limp - I ate it anyway because it was the best thing next to the rice which was actually almost hot. My husband reminded me that I forgot a couple of things. At some point during or after the meal, the waiter, for some reason, repeated that they made an exception about the whole bread thing and that it was not customary, maybe I misinterpreted the tone because it was really an unnecessary thing to bring up, but I got the implication that we should have been very grateful. And then when we were signing the credit card, the waiter stood directly over us as my husband was adding the tip and signing - it felt very uncomfortable so we both mumbled that we had it from here but there he remained. So we tried a more direct approach and asked that he let us sign without standing over us but there he remained so we said, \\"or not\\" and as we left I commented that it was really poor manners to stare at a customer when they were adding the tip. What did he think? That we were going to leave? He'd stood there to see my husband sign his name, we's already given our card information, it was all very weird and made for a terrible finish to an equally terrible beginning and middle. \\n\\nI had what I think were reasonable hopes for this place and it's so close so it would have benefited me to have liked it but there was nothing redeemable at all. I'll stick to the Indian place in the mall for cheap stuff and the restaurant down 436 for dinner and make sure I don't pass go when I see this chain.\\n\\nPS That roti, it was spongy, my guess is it's frozen, possibly thawed a little, and then heated - hopefully not in the microwave.\\n\\nLet me add another thing I had forgotten, it was close to 80 degrees inside on the day I visited and I'm usually very cold :("},{"name":"Ping","address":"102 NW 4th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"i'll begin this review by stating i've only been to Ping's happy hour... and i won't be going back anytime soon.  sorry charlie.  i suggest crossing the river and visiting Biwa... 1hoda% better and their happy hour rocks!... i promise."},{"name":"Highland Kitchen","address":"150 Highland Ave","city":"Somerville","stars":"4","text":"My most recent meal at Highland was a disaster, and I'm STILL giving it 4 stars.

When we informed the waiter about it he asked if we would like him to heat it up for us and then informed us that the area where the pasta is cooked is not working properly so none of the pasta items were cooked correctly but still brought it to the table for us to eat knowing it was not up to standards. We also only saw our waiter maybe every 30 minutes. My friend ordered a lunch menu item and because we were there for so long they then charged her item as a dinner entree because lunch was now over. (Even though when we ordered our food it was still lunch) I think our drinks were refilled once in the 2+ hours we were there. The table next to us waited almost 20 minutes until their order was even taken & the table on the other side got up and left because no one ever came to help them. Cheesecake Factory is one of my favorite restaurants but me and my party of 5 will probably never be returning after this awful ridiculous experience.

The menus are conveniently placed in front where you can select from all ranges of patties (see what I did here?) and other options as well as sides.  A plethora of sauces are available to choose from in its sauce station, from the conservative barbecue sauce to the liberal toasted marshmallow one (too sweet!).

The burger bowl is hefty and will fill you up.  I recommend the honey mustard dressing for it.  My only complaint would be that the patty could be a bit more generous in its size in relation to the amount of greens it was trying to compete with in this bowl.

There's even nice private group rooms set aside for parties and events.  Also the background music is quite hip with R&B and pop so I found it easy to get caught up in the beat chowing down the food.  I learned from Cindy the manager that they subscribe with Pandora to provide the upbeat music.  \\n\\nWhat makes this buffet stand out is that everything is made to order so no worries about other people sticking their hands and face into food that might go for someone else.  Of course on the downside I can see it taking a bit of time but they do have 4 dedicated sushi chefs furiously putting together orders.  \\n\\nOf course the problem is you gotta be sure to not over indulge and try a little of everything.  Rolls were very well made and not stuffed with rice as I would expect and sashimi was fresh.  They seem to offer various specials such as the first time we came when they had fresh oysters available for 75 cents a piece though we didn't try any.  I think the regular all you can eat menu is plentiful enough.

Based on this rec and what I'd read on Yelp, I was expecting an amazing meal. Unfortunately, things fell really short:\\n \\n1. The first waitress seemed more like an order-taker, rather than someone who wanted to share information about the different menu items... I was told \\"all the info is on the menu.\\"\\n \\n2. I am a vegetarian. And, I never expect a restaurant to cater to me (pretty flexible about getting creative based on what's available on the menu). Sometimes restaurants are able to put together a vegetable plate, based on what's already in the kitchen. I asked the waitress about this, and again I was told (and not very politely) that everything was on the menu. I requested that she check, just to make sure. She seemed rather put out by this request and came back just a minute later to tell me no. I am not convinced that she even asked.\\n \\n3. Having been told that there were no \\"vegetarian\\" entree options, I asked to put a few of the non-meat items together (shishitos, brussel sprouts) as an entree plate. When we were served, these items came out as appetizers prior to the meal to be shared by the table. This was incredibly awkward - both from an etiquette perspective as well as to eat (had to keep jumping from plate to plate). Again, I was not there for a casual meal, but a business lunch, so this made things even worse.\\n \\n4. It was strange that mid-meal, waitresses changed with no explanation.\\n \\nI realize that my requests were probably not the norm; it being Texas, I imagine there are not a whole lot of vegetarians. And I was not expecting to be catered to. However, being a restaurant of a level that Swift's aspires to, I was really surprised by the lack of willingness to make the dining experience more enjoyable."},{"name":"407 Cafe","address":"9161 Narcoossee Rd, Ste 108","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"Very good coffee.

Fat wasn't rendered fully and was a greasy mess instead of crispy and brown. Don't bother with the cheaper entrees like the pastrami sandwich (about the size of a biscuit) or the fried quail (description mentions brussels sprouts but there was no garnish on ours. felt like $22 dollars for a chicken thigh at kfc).

First I've never had Korean BBQ so I really have no base comparison.

So the second thing I would like to shout from the rooftop is this place is by no means a Two Star restaurant (which is where the current rating is as of this writing).  Two stars to me implies garbage food, horrendous service, and a potentially sick to your stomach dining experience.  None of that applies here-so please be aware that you can visit without any major concerns.  Is it a five star Korean BBQ joint--no, but it is in my mind more like a 3.5 star experience.  We went with the six person combo deal which is a ton of food--a few different kinds of beef, shrimp, salmon, including a LOT of sides including tofu soup, bibimbap, rice etc etc.  You will not leave hungry and all of the meat and seafood was very fresh.  Service was good, not exemplary--some language barrier stuff going on but all to be expected.  Give it a go--I enjoyed it and would go again.

Bartenders, especially Mike, are friendly, quick, and make strong drinks. Unfortunately, the rest of the wait staff may have been lobotomized upon hire. The first time I went here with my best friend, it took 2 HOURS for one round of drinks and a sushi boat, mostly because our terrible waitress couldn't manage to check in with us more than once every 30 minutes. Seriously. We had planned on moving to the bar when we finished dinner but were so disgusted by her apathy that we paid and left. Basically, she caused another $50+ of liquor sales to walk right out the door and over to another bar. \\nA few weeks later, we gave it another go - sitting at a high-top near the bar this time. A different waitress took our drink orders and then stared down our IDs for a good 2 minutes, during which one of the bartenders who we know well was trying to let her know yes, we were of age, and that he was already making our usuals.  When she brought the drinks, my friend ordered for both of us, but apparently the waitress only heard the appetizer. She also managed to forget waters for us and had to be reminded. When she came back to pick up our appetizer plate, she asked if we wanted anything else. We said, \\"besides the sushi boat?\\" Poor thing looked terribly confused, so we repeated our order. Sushi was mostly good, but the shrimp was extremely dried out and one piece of fish was so tough my friend couldn't chew it. But otherwise, we've always had good food.\\nBottom line: LOVE the bar - great crowd, good people watching, top notch bartenders.

I was sadly disppointed in both my meal and experience. \\n\\nThe drinks were not well composed. A julep is meant to be somewhat sweet, but it was extremely bitter. All of the appetizers and main courses came out at the same time. Normally I wouldn't care about this mistake for a more casual restaurant, but at these prices, I expect some progression of the meal. The biscuit plate was dry and bland, as were the chicken and waffles. The biscuit was dense and dry, as was the pork. The fried chicken included 3 pieces of meat, but one piece was a leg bone with most of the meat missing. The mac n'cheese and fritters were decent, but not remarkable.\\n\\nThe waitress was nice, but demonstrated her inexperience throughout the meal. She could not offer much in recommendations except for a couple of plates and didn't seem to know the menu at all. I felt it was her responsibility to catch the mistake when all of the plates came out at once. We did remark, \\"Oh, we are getting our main plate and appetizers at the same time?\\" When the waitress asked how are meal was going, we tried to respond that it wasn't great and she seemingly didn't hear or ignored the comment, saying, \\"oh glad it's good\\", as she walked away. And the end of the meal, she asked how things were and we shrugged and commented. She said, \\"oh not what you expected?\\" and placed the the bill down. A very minor mistake, but she collected our signed bill before we finished and left the table.\\n\\nThe meal and experience were strange and disappointing. We noticed things falling and breaking in the dining area/open kitchen on 3 separate occasions during the meal, which seemed congruous to the disorganization of the restaurant both in the front and back of the house. I expected more, as the reviews have been strong. Perhaps the cooks and staff had an off night, but I won't be returning, especially since we both got very sick later that night. \\n\\nFar better options for bbq and fried chicken: Highland Kitchen, Sweet Cheeks, The Smoke Shop, and Blue Ribbon -all great restaurants with wonderful food and competent staff.

This is the closest thing to real French bread you will find in town, and the prices reflect the quality of the ingredients and a taste you will find nowhere else in Austin. \\n\\nEasy Tiger also serves fresh pastries and coffee, and if one dares to venture downstairs or on their terrasse, they will discover a restaurant and beer garden. Easy Tiger serves the best vegetarian sausage I've ever had (infused with spices and a smokey taste so hard to find in common vegetarian concoctions), and their meat-based sausage, though I've never tried them, look succulent too. Their Antonelli's cheese plate is also amazing, with or without a drink. Their staff is nice, and the place overall is cozy as well, with its large, heavy and tastefully worn-out chairs and tables. \\n\\nUnfortunately, in spite of all their greatness, Easy Tiger does have some issues that must be addressed. \\n\\nFirst of all, Easy Tiger has a lot of trouble baking with levain (sourdough). Almost every time I have purchased a sourdough bread, whether it be the boule or the b√¢tard, it was overcooked, covered with a thick hardened crust that is very hard to cut through, even with a good bread knife. After 36 hours, the sourdough bread will inevitably become as hard as a rock, whether it is kept on the counter, hidden in a dry cabinet, or stored in the fridge (I've tried it all). If you can't devour a whole loaf within a day, don't bother buying it. It would seem Easy Tiger's employees do not test the quality of their sourdough products. That leaves me very disappointed as it's one of my favorite types of bread. I will stick to the Pane Italiano from now on, a sure bet that lasts a steady 48 hours without turning into stone.\\n\\nSecondly, I'm not super impressed by their pastries. It would seem that it's hit or miss. Some of them are tasty (I'm looking at you, cat-shaped ginger cookie), but others are just average, tasting like dry-ish flaky dough more than anything else. Where's the sweetness and the explosion of tasty deliciousness I'm supposed to feel when I bite into them? It's nowhere in sight.\\n\\nPerhaps, being French Canadian, I've been spoiled rotten by a society that knows how to bake bread, carrying the secrets of French cuisine from generation to generation, written in its DNA, and I compare Austin's best bread shop with what I know to be the best, what their bread attempts to be like.\\n\\nLastly, what's up with it being so difficult to get sugar in my coffee? Their coffee is fair, and I can vouch for the latte and the espresso. It's not the fanciest, but it's good enough. That being said, it's always served without sugar, and every time I have to beg for sugar to be brought at the table. The sugar tray is filled with stevia and other artificial substitutes, and I'm lucky if I can find a couple of regular white sugar packets. On three occasions, I asked for brown or raw sugar. Two times, waiters went upstairs in the bakery and brought back raw sugar in a little tray (a bit overkill but great service, guys). The last time I visited, the waitress who seemed a bit tired just replied they had no such thing there. I settled with the only two packets of white sugar available. That would do, I suppose.\\n\\nEasy Tiger, if you didn't screw up your sourdough bread so bad every time, selling me a rock I have to throw in the trash after only a day, if your pastries were a little bit less bland, and if you had decent sugar options for your coffee (at the table), I would give you four stars, maybe five on a good day. Until then, you are merely a wannabe, a pale copy of the masters. I do hope you get your shit together though, I'd love to become a regular customer of yours."},{"name":"Turner's Seafood - Salem","address":"43 Church St","city":"Salem","stars":"4.5","text":"Pretty AWEsome!

And that, is greatly appreciated.\\n\\nP.S. for the people who have issues with pricing. Yes, it does get pricey. And I do understand that at the end of the meal it comes down to whether or not it felt worth it for you. But keep in mind that there are financial breakdowns in this industry that vary from restaurant to restaurant on similar products due to costs to running a business (location rent, salaries, food cost, etc. etc.).

It actually didn't feel at all Boston to me, which tends to be a good thing for me.  \\n\\nWe had a fairly early reservation which seems to be the way to go with the place.  I watched quite a few people standing and waiting for quite a while to be seated at the big butcher block table and could see that this is a popular complaint once I read some of the other Yelp reviews.  I actually do think this is a great place to wait rather than most places that just pack you in by the front door.  The butcher table is much more roomie and there was immediate service to get us to try some of their wine.  This was another plus.  One of the servers came by to offer us a few wine tastes while we waited for our friends and was VERY VERY friendly throughout the course of the meal as well.  Their wine isn't cheap...actually not many things on the menu were, but I wasn't expecting it to be based on the service and \\"look\\" of the place.\\n\\nAs much as I liked my overall experience at The Butcher Shop, I'm giving them 3 stars because my steak was not the quality that I would expect from a place with such a tell tale name, hack saws hanging from the wall, and wonderful looking cured meats hanging everywhere.  We went with the restaurant week menu and although I was tempted to get the gnocchi, I figured it wouldn't be right to not order one of their steak dishes and went with the flat iron steak.  The flavor was mouthwatering, but I found myself chewing for a decade.  My husband got the same thing and said his was of similar texture, but when I gave him a bite of mine he was surprised at how much worse my cut was.  The rest of the food was tasty, but not memorable.   I liked the fennel corn soup and was happy when it arrived with a side of bread and raw honey...a treat!  If I went back I would probably skip the desserts.  I tried both the chocolate mousse and my husband's ricotta torte and they were both just OK.  The torte had some wonderful spice flavors, but the texture was dry and didn't beg you to eat more.  The mousse was good, but not the best I've ever had.\\n\\nI would likely go back to give them a second chance, but the prices might stretch that return visit till next year when they're doing Restaurant Week again.

She interrupted us on each one, not letting us order them until we answered her as she demanded \\"Starter? Starter?\\" to which we replied \\"yes, as a starter\\". We then also ordered the main courses. After a long wait (half an hour to 40 minutes), the waitress returned with our main courses. We asked where our starters were but she did not seem to care. She took great offense when she tried to shove the main courses down on the table and we explained that we didn't want them before the starters. Puzzling, as this was after she had insisted on making a big point of needing to know that they were specifically starters. She exasperatedly stormed off with the food.\\n\\nWhen the bar drinks that we had initially ordered finally came, they were thrust randomly in front of people at the table. One of the drinks was wrong. There was no chance the waitress, who ignored my father as she walked off, was going to help. Instead, we went to the bar and a helpful chap behind the bar assisted us and took the time to explain that they were understaffed and apologized about the delay. This was the first bit of customer service we had received all night.\\n\\nWhen the starters did come, they were great! We had the Kashkeh Bademjan and the Shalot yogurt with flatbread. Very tasty, would recommend giving them a try for something unique instead of more usual choices.\\n\\nThe hostility resumed again when the waitress returned with the main courses and sarcastically demanded \\"Is this OKAY now? Are you READY for them NOW?\\".\\n\\nThe main courses were excellent; distinctive and unique. We had an assortment of barg, soltani, and koobideh kabobs. Some people tried the rice with dill and fava beans which added another level of character to the food. In spite of having been sitting under a heatlamp for so long, everyone complimented their food, which shows just how tasty it was. The meat was succulent and the portions were very generous. Each kabob had it's own quality.\\n\\nPart way through the meal, after finishing his drink, my father asked for the wine list. The wine list never came. I would have assumed this was simply a mistake because of the rush but the crowd had died down at this point and, at the end of the meal, the waitress did return. She made a point of ignoring my dad and asking my aunt if she wanted another drink. We opted not to stay for coffee or desert at this point and my father paid the bill.\\n\\nIt is hard to fully convey in a text description of the sequence of events, but apart from all of the above-described behaviour the waitress demonstrated aggression and annoyance throughout the night through her body language, tone, and disposition. \\n\\nThe fact that there were delays due to short staffing is understandable. We did not actually complain about this at any point. The waitress's attitude was unacceptable I have served as a waiter for many years in the past and I know what it's like. We were undemanding, polite and, frankly, quite patient with the treatment we received. We didn't want to escalate things because we were there to celebrate my uncles birthday birthday in spite of everything. I do understand how stressful things can get when it's busy, but part of any job is to maintain professionalism. This is especially true when one works in the hospitality industry. People are able to prepare food at home or simply order take out. Part of the appeal of going out, especially to a place with a nice interior like Urban Gate, is to enjoy the ambience. Being treated impolitely as if you are a loathsome nuisance totally ruins that and is not something anyone wants to pay money for. This experience undermined what is, I must reiterate, great food. I suggest that if an individual working as a server finds the existence of customers irritating or does not have the ability to treat them in a courteous manner, that they should seek employment that does not require much interpersonal interaction. Unfortunately they not only ruin the customer's experience, but will also affect the reputation of the establishment at which they work."},{"name":"Jester King Brewery","address":"13187 Fitzhugh Rd","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"Up in the Hill Country, you'll get amazing Texas landscapes while enjoying a huge selection of craft beer and enjoying pizza from the adjoining place next door.\\n\\nIt's worth the trip!

Halfway thru the day having waited hours in line for the must see safari adventure we search for a place to rest our feet and eat some type of food with little expectation. We decided on Satu'li canteen, a quick serve cafe. Already in my mind I'm think ok prepare for fast food al la Pandora theme. Boy was I wrong!\\n\\nFirst let's start with the decor. I just wanted to stand and take pics all day but hey we're here to eat right and who wants to get pushed to back of line after an exhausting morning.\\n\\nThe menu oh my had such good option for meat eaters and well as vegetarians! I struggled between the boa buns and the byob (build your own bowl). Being brown it's hard to turn down anything curry (veggie boa buns) but I went with the byob. It helped that my friend wanted the veggie boa buns. :)\\n\\nWith the byob you get to pick your own base, meat and sauce. I went with the sustainable fish on a bed of sweet potato hash with a onion chimichurri, slaw and yogurt boba balls. Sound good? It was! The fish was crispy and flaky. The hash was delish and the sauce was good as well. It had a strong flavor I thought was garlic but thinking about it more, it was prob the onion. If you're on a date beware or make sure you have gum. Overall a decent dish but too much hash for lunch.\\n\\nNow I said my friend got the veggie curry boa buns right. Let me not even start! I have never had a boa bun but omg was this one delish. Next time I go to Animal Kingdom I'm going straight for the veggie boa bun. The curry veggie flavor was spot on!\\n\\nSelf service canteens/cafeterias usually have a bad rep but this one was great.

My new favorite place is Cafe Dino but they were closed today so I went back to Max's.  I've gone there before and I've only eaten lunch only once so my review is mainly  about breakfast time (specially today).  The cook sucks at Max's.  Plainly put. Sorry.  Maybe he's an illegal immigrant and can't understand English, i'm not sure, but I do know he doesn't listen at all.  I ask for my eggs well well well (Yes I stress it) done and he still makes them runny.  Actually let me go down the list of issues I have with the place.\\n\\n1) Bacon.  I understand you cook bacon in bulk but how is it possible to have half a strip of bacon cooked and the other side raw?  It's disgusting and I can't see how people eat that.  Every time I get the bacon, i'm left picking the good parts off and throwing half of it away.  Also, when people order bacon and it's been sitting there all day, warm it up.  Who wants cold bacon?\\n\\n2) Eggs.  Like I said before, I like my eggs dry not runny.  Regardless of how you say you want your eggs, you'll get them only one way.  His way.   I ask for scrambled eggs and he makes an omelet, flips it over and cuts it up and puts it on my plate.  This is not scrambled eggs sorry.  Not only that, but now I'm left with huge chunks of raw egg since they weren't scrambled up and he didn't even bother to cook them long enough.  Again happens every time I go there.  I even stress the fact that he always makes them runny and non-scrambled, the lady writes it down and hands him the slip and what do you know, he does it again!  WTF\\n\\n3) Home Fries.  Seasoned well but  always cold.  Again with the cold food.  Not only that but I don't think they're cooked long enough.  Tastes sorta raw.  Raw and cold great\\n\\n4) Toast is good though.  They have an assortment of breads to choose from.  The wheat is real nice and has bits of wheat pieces along the top.  But how hard is it to make toast?  Be better if they didn't have the little rotatory toaster but a broiler so they can put butter on the bread while they toast it.  \\n\\nAlso if you order the breakfast special (which is basically what I outlined above) and order French Toast too, the cook will not give you toast!   I have no idea why he feels the need to skip out on the toast as the French Toast could have been ordered for someone else but just chalk that up to another one of his weird habits.\\n\\n\\n**Edit:  Looking at the other reviews, they seem to point out that lunch is pretty good.

I planned my 30th birthday to be an 80's themed party here on October 7th.  This place holds a special place in my heart since it is where I met my boyfriend on a bowling league 3.5 years ago - but because of this, I understand why there are so many poor reviews.  I can personally attest that if you are not here as part of a previously planned event, get ready to wait.  That being said, Justin made our time at King's absolutely amazing!  Since we were planning to have the party on a Saturday night, I did an online inquiry as to a private party/VIP event and how much that would cost.  It was a little above what I wanted to pay upfront, so we opted to show up on the earlier side of a Saturday afternoon on a holiday weekend (although, the events coordinator, Kristina, was very responsive and informative).  There was about 30 in my group (not all bowling), but plenty of lanes open, and even then they gave us two semi-private lanes in the back room.  After we got all set up and the waitress had begun taking and delivering our orders, a gentleman comes up, introduces himself as Justin and tells me that he understands there was an 80's themed party going on, so he's changed the playlist specifically for us! Justin then asks what we are celebrating and I told him it was my 30th where after he returns with a birthday cake shot just for me.  He continually checked on us and made sure we were having a great time; he even brought us some quarters and played a game of 4-top air hockey when we needed a 4th! There was also a bartender at the bar near the semi-private lanes who helped us out all night, too, I believe his name was Dan.\\n  \\nThe only disappointing part of the evening was the waitress (whose name I did not get).  She was very slow, allegedly cut us off, and tried to charge my (female) friend's card when my brother asked to pay the entire bill.  I can overlook the bill thing, because it was a simple miscommunication.  Seriously though, the servers need training on speed and when to appropriately cut someone off, as this seems to be the most common denominator of all of the reviews (having fun does not necessarily equal shitfaced). \\n\\nAll-in-all, it was a terrifically fun night, all thanks to Justin and his team, and I will continue to recommend King's for any group event."},{"name":"ArtEpicure Cooking School","address":"1 Fitchburg St","city":"Somerville","stars":"5","text":"We had a private class (6 adults) today with Mark at Art Epicure and had a fantastic time.

Happily they had both my and my dining partner's favorites on the list (steak frites and boeuf bourguignon). Both of these entrees were priced at $19... I think this prix is reasonable for the well prepared French cuisine we were served. The steak was perfectly cooked medium (as I requested) and the frites were tasty. Oh, and the peppercorn sauce was magnifique. I tried a bit of the BB too and it was good and made of beef cheeks. We had the pinot noir/gamay blend and it was a nice pairing with our meals. The service was attentive despite the crowdedness. \\n\\nThe space is very small, and when it is crowded it can be an adventure to navigate your way to the washroom - you must wiggle through the sea of tightly packed escargot consumers and then walk through the actual kitchen to get there.

My issues are with the game area.  NOTHING worked.  Any type of game with a ball (basketball, football, etc.) was deflated.  The basketball games were not working...so you pay and play and get no points and tickets.  It seemed like the car racing games were working.  But everything else I would swipe my game card, it would take my tokens, and then either give me nothing to play and would be counting time or whatever the game did, and then I couldn't actually play.  Or you play and get no tickets.  Or it would just keep saying to swipe your card after it had taken your tokens.  So eventually I just left because I can use that card at a D&B where the games work and I really didn't feel like calling a game attendant every second.  They need to shut that place down and fix everything.  Even the skee ball machines weren't working...\\n\\nAlso, kids and crazy people are just running around throwing the basketballs, footballs, etc. whenever someone finishes a game.

We also got the summer rolls, which is your standard pork and shrimp with peanut sauce - also generous at 5 rolls and well made. My favorite was the bun bo hue. It's a childhood fave of mine, and rarely does anyone else make it better than my mom but Baoqi did a good job. It's a bit sweeter than I'm used to but oh so satisfying.

The meat is delicious, but everything else was not. \\nThe falafel was over seasoned, sweet, and served burnt and cold.

Chef nick and his kitchen team are really creative and challenge themselves each week to use local and fresh ingredients and creative in innovative way.

You won't spend a ridiculous amount of time waiting for your appetizer entree period and terms of the serving staff and the bartenders / cocktails they're mixed drinks are delicious and creative and you get the appropriate amount of alcohol for the price that you pay.

When we arrived there was only a group of four waiting ahead of us. They had to sit at the window and couldn't interact much with each other. We were crammed between two large families at the main communal table and I felt as much a part of their conversation as my own.

I can't help but mention I like their fun square shiny white plates as well. The antipasto is yummy as well as the arancini. The salads are a decent size - definitely shareable in my opinion. I have to say, I really like the chicken parm here. I like it because I feel that even though something is breaded and fried it does not have to be a batter-heavy, dripping in oil mess. Tremonte's chicken parm reminds me of the one my father makes - the chicken is pounded thin, lightly breaded and fried and topped with a good sauce (or gravy-if you prefer the terminology) and cheese. It comes with two pieces of chicken and the portion is large - plenty for leftovers. My husband got the rib-eye special which I greedily took a few bites off - very good. Oh and the potatoes gratin are a must. \\n\\nFor dessert, nothing but the chocolate lava cake for me and it did not disappoint. Also, the prices are not bad at all.

He picked the 3 items and got the flank, tendon, and beef balls.  I tried his soup, it was mediocre.  Definitely not one of the best I've had but the one good thing is that it wasn't too oily.  Generally the places where I don't like the pho, it's usually because you can see the oil floating on top.  I ordered the vermicelli bowl and got the grilled chicken and spring rolls.  It wasn't bad. I felt that the spring rolls weren't very crispy, they actually feel like they were reheated or something.  Also, I didn't feel like there was enough noodles.  Overall, this place was ok.

Server recommended this dish. Chicken was sauteed w/ Marsala wine & cremini mushrooms (although they looked like button mushrooms to me). I could tell my dad didn't like his dish - he wanted Tabasco (but I told him no, that would be too insulting to them). But I had to agree, his dish was pretty bland. The dish also came w/ a side of pasta - that was ok, too.\\n\\nGROUPER - CATCH OF THE DAY ($25.50)\\nServer spoke very highly of this dish so my mom decided to get this. The fish was brushed w/ egg and then pan-fried, and also flavored w/ capers. She got the mixed vegetables (carrots & broccoli) as her side. She enjoyed her dish, I thought it was just ok. And pricey for what she got. \\n\\nVEAL CAPRESE (reg. $20.50)\\nI love veal, and so I asked the server for his favorite veal dish - but I thought this dish was just ok ... although it was probably the best tasting out of the three. The veal was sauteed in light white wine, mozzarella, & fresh tomatoes. My dish came with a side of pasta, too.\\n\\nOverall 3 stars. Service was friendly, ambiance was dark, few tables were occupied, and the food was just ok and just not all that exciting. Maybe we should've stuck with the seafood dishes since I'd read somewhere that seafood is their specialty. Who knows. But I think the food here is little pricey for what you get.

We were told there would be close to an hour wait. I gave them my cell number and we walked around the shops. I was texted about 20 minutes later stating that our table was ready.\\n\\nFirst let me say, our waiter was great. He talked a little about the menu, answered questions and said we want you to try different items and be happy. He went on to say that if you order something and it's not to your taste, just let him know and he will get us something else and take it off the bill.\\n\\nWe started off with 3 Bloody Mary's  and 1 Mimosa. They have a large selection of different types of Bloody Mary's. All the mixes were homemade and they were very happy to add extra horseradish. We then ordered their homemade biscuits and cornbread served with homemade jam, and butter & honey, as well as their fried okra. The biscuits and cornbread were delicious! We enjoyed the okra but it was probably our least favorite although the dipping sauce was great. We then shared a wedge salad with with blue crab, fried green tomatoes, bacon, blue cheese, pickled red onion and smoked tomato-horseradish-buttermilk dressing. This was several steps above your normal wedge. Now for the main attraction, we order the bucket of fried chicken and a side of mac-n-cheese. This was a whole chicken cut in pieces and fried. I consider myself an affecienado of fried chicken having tasted it in many states. I have still been searching for something local that rivals the best I have ever had down south. Well this was pretty close! I don't know how they make it but it was cooked perfectly, crispy on the outside and moist and juicy inside. The mac-n-cheese was also very good.\\n\\nWhile we were very full, we decided to share 1 dessert. In the meantime the Manager who I had seen on TV came by to ask how our meal was. We all said we loved it and it was the real deal.  I had told him that I had seen him on TV and that the food and service lived up to what he said. Next thing we knew he sent over 3 desserts on the house. This certainly wasn't necessary. I will say either leave room for dessert or take some home.

Unfortunately, my expectations were much higher. \\n\\nWe pretty much tried everything, with a little extra here and there. I'm not new to the Barbara Lynch restaurants, in fact, I'm kind of her number one fan. For some reason, it took me awhile to make it here, but I think I'm going to need a redo, because it was just okay.\\n\\n I'll start with the wine. I discussed with our server the qualities I wanted in a wine, which were big and heavy, fruit forward, and more jammy than spicy. She gave three suggestions, 2 from Italy ($55-110) and 1 from France ($70). I chose the French only because I'm not as familiar, and I wanted to try something new. It was bright, fruit forward, but definitely a medium body wine. Good, but not what I was dreaming of. \\n\\nThen we chose a cheese, and had the server choose another for us. You only got little tastes of each cheese, which I guess is okay, but I wanted more - ha! The first was great, really complex goat/cow blend that was offered in two different ages. The second was of the manchego family, which was light and a great suggestion. \\n\\nAs far as the food goes - we tried the entire menu pretty much. The lamb carpaccio was deliciously seasoned, with a crumbly blue cheese. Good, and predictable. The cucumber, yogurt, almond soup? Heaven. Really refreshing, and perfect for summer. 5 stars for that one! We both chose the Hanger Steak for our entree. It was paired with a delicious buttermilk dressing that really jazzed up the flavor of the meat. Without the dressing, it was just okay. As in, I probably wouldn't have finished it. Maybe I'm a snob about my meat cuts, but this was part of the restaurant week menu and the only other option was Pork Belly. I thought it was most appropriate to go for the Hanger Steak, but really wish I had upgraded to a nicer cut. It just didn't melt in my mouth and make me excited. Which, I want to happen when I got to a restaurant that takes pride in their meat selection. The desserts were a Chocolate Mousse and Creme Caramel. The Chocolate Mousse was much preferred, nothing like a rich dark chocolate finish to a red-meat dinner. The Creme Caramel was similar to flan, good, but I'd definitely suggest the Chocolate Mousse over it.\\n\\nThere were definitely ups and downs to our courses, but I really was let down by the meat. I probably should go back and try a nicer cut, or even just a plate of cured meats and cheeses with a nice glass of wine...but for now I'm really only feeling 3 stars."},{"name":"Cinco Mexican Cantina","address":"2851 Akers Mill Rd SE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3","text":"I've been to the Alpharetta and Vicory Creek Cinco's several times, but this was my first visit to the Akers Mill location.

Bowling seemed fitting enough, tame and not offensive.  Place is conveniently located across from the convention center and next door (and connected) to Summer Shack for your NE flavored eats.  On a Sunday night there was no wait, but the lanes were pretty much all occupied.  It was dark, mood-lighting dark.  I know it's hip and all, but it was really hard to see.  Lane areas are totally cramped, felt like we were crawling over each other and pretty much in the other group's faces (lane neighbors).  Didn't help that most people coming to a place like this don't really bowl much anyway, so aren't aware of bowling etiquette.  The whole bar itself was rather large, there are dining areas, a full bar, pool tables, foosball, air hockey, etc. for other entertainment.  Late 90s pop was blaring across all of it.  Probably great for a college freshman night or after-prom.  \\n\\nHad to eat, so did get some food, tried to make it as least intrusive to bowling as possible.  Note, eating while bowling=sticky balls.  I shuddered each time I put my fingers into those bowling balls, ick.  Never the twain should meet.  Had to eat eventually, so got some foods recommended by our waitress as the least obtrusive to bowling, Spicy Southwestern Grilled Chicken Wrap (sufficient, plain jane, came with nothing else), Pizza of the Week (prosciutto, arugula, fresh mozzarella), thin chewy crust, somewhat tough, well-salted; Sampler Platter (fried food fiesta, enormous, and expensive $25).  Lane neighbors (not with us) had the wings with the sauce on them, like I said, the balls were sticky when they were done.\\n\\nWe had fun, but overall it was really expensive ($7/person/game plus $4 for shoes).  Wasn't really asked what size drink I wanted, got brought a vodka and soda in a 20 oz. pint glass.  It's a wonder everyone in Boston isn't an alcoholic (or are they?).

Hello women your chef burnt the dish, we didn't even eat it!!!! \\nAlso the staff constantly reminds you that  there's no tip added to the bill yet okay?  People forget that tip is for good service,  which you don't get here.

The sandwiches tasted great and we were excited for dessert. We put in two orders of caramel Frappuccinos, a shot of espresso, and gelato. They forgot our order twice and had to ask us a third time what it was we ordered. When we finally got our Frappuccino's it was in a plastic to go cup and pretty small. Nothing like what was pictured on yelp or what was shown on the menu. I didn't feel like waiting for the check so I went up to the cashier to pay and leave.

The beans had a nice sauce flavour, the cole slaw was a bit over mayoed, the potato salad was not bad for the style, the fries were hot and slightly seasoned, and the corn bread was cold sadly.

The ribs and rib ends were decent renditions, although some of them could have used just a little more time in the smoker and a bit more rub.  The sausage was a bit underseasoned, but not bad.  The pulled pork was a tad bit dry, but not bad once you added the sauce.  The chicken was flavourful and moist.  The brisket was tender and had a nice bark.

You can see the family dynamic from your side of the counter. Such is the case with Lee's Burgers, which took the place of Flippin' Burgers in Newton Center. The layout is the same, but the menu has expanded to carry much more. I have had the chicken sandwich which wasn't just comically large, it was delicious. But let's focus on the burger, as that is probably what you want to know about. It's great. Big, juicy, and smothered in toppings. The usual toppings are free, and they are really liberal with them! How often have you ordered a burger and one tiny pickle slice was on there? Not the case with Lee's. In fact, I have had to pull some onions off of my sandwich. The fries are sooooo good. Hot, salty, fresh, and once again, they are very liberal with them (you can split them without a problem). They have precisely one million condiments on the counter so if you are a condiment junkie (guilty as charged!), you can really go nuts. Their \\"secret\\" sauce is a combo of honey mustard and mayo. Not my favorite but my brother loves to dip fries in it. Don't worry, they don't put it on your sandwich unless you ask for it. \\n\\nWhat's great about Lee's isn't just the food. You can see that the people working there actually enjoy their jobs. They are extremely friendly and even recognized my brother and father. I am happy that Lee's replaced Flippin' Burger, it's just a better place in general.

I never thought to combine them but trust me this was a union that was meant to happen. The bahn mi sandwich was a delicious mixture of flavors all held together in a baguette. The rice and beans were tasty also. My boyfriend loved his sandwich and I stole a bite and agreed! It had a chimichurri sauce on it that was so flavorful. The sandwiches are pretty big.

It was a bit tricky to locate the driveway to drive in, but I didn't' give up and found it on the third drive by.\\n\\nThis resto had an old school feel to it and reminded me of the busy little cafes that once abounded in Chinatown.  Knowing that customer service isn't their focus, I just kept asking (hounding?) different servers for my tea refill until it came.\\n\\nWhen we didn't quite tip 10%, the waitress pointed that out to us and even told us how much we were short.  That's a first.  Tips must be how they survive, as I'm sure they don't make much in hourly wages.  The waitress was almost friendly as she carried on a conversation with us about low wah kiew immigrants and how she's from the same county in China where my parents are from.

Until we drove by this location I was under the assumption that Chevy's only existed on the West side of the country and that even those locations were slowly dying. My regular location during college in Mesa, Arizona recently closed its doors and I had heard rumors that this was happening all over. I was more than surprised to discover that this location is not only in existence here in Florida but is brand new and seems to be doing fairly well.\\n\\nChevy's is a mid-range Mexican restaurant with entrees around the $10-15 range. That's a bit of a jump from their previous pricing when I was in AZ... but I assume that they're trying to reimagine themselves. Okay, fine. A couple of bucks isn't worth sweating over.\\n\\nThis location is nice and clean and has a good vibe. But let's be real, at a Mexican restaurant no one cares if it is clean or has a good vibe. We'll take the chance of the hershey squirts for some great tasting Chile Rellano or carne asada! \\n\\nLuckily Chevy's seems to have stuck with the great food I remember from Arizona. There are a few small changes but overall the food was essentially unchanged. I love their chips and salsa which is always fresh and tasty. I'm sitting in a puddle of drool right now just thinking about it.\\n\\nI almost always order a 2 or 3 entree combination. Some of the options have changed but no matter what you get you won't be disappointed. I particularly love the chile rellano which gives me great memories of my younger days in AZ while I flirted my way around the chicas so I could get free cooking lessons.\\n\\nNow, if you live in a Southwestern part of the country, there are certainly better and more authentic Mexican joints but I love this place and will go again and again and again, especially now that we found one in Florida!"},{"name":"Maki Maki","address":"40 Cummings Park","city":"Woburn","stars":"3","text":"Good food, great value!

Sauce was great but not enough making the ench's rather dry. Further more the kick of the sauce could not begin to make up for the lack of seasoning in the rest of the meal. i.e. 'boiled chicken filling'. I know it say's roasted however roasted chicken with no seasoning has more flavor than that. My partners meal went back to the kitchen, wrong meal. Apparantly the server didn't have enough time to check the plates before delivery or perhaps the cook misread the ticket and so did the expeditor, who knows. The bill came with no extra marg taken off. We did speak to the manager who eventually comped the whole meal which we barely touched.

And here's why:\\n\\nTHE JOURNEY\\n\\nLike Woodstock, Tasty and Sons is a trek. (No one wanted to go to upstate New York I bet). This Portland brunch hotspot is about 2.5 miles from downtown. We footed it in a downpour.\\n\\nTHE ANTICIPATION \\n\\nWe arrived to a buzzing scene and were told we'd have to wait, approximately 45min. Glancing at the menu, we knew the line up would be worth it. Little did we know, the experience would be so remarkable we'd have been willing to camp out over night to be first in the gate. \\n\\nTHE LINE UP\\n\\nThe show began with a Tasty Mary - which is Tasty and Son's version of the hangover classic the bloody mary. \\n\\nShe was the Jimi Hendrix of the meal. Well spiced. Creatively garnished. Maybe not stiff enough to set a guitar on fire. But an amazing experience anyways. There was also a version with Tequila and, of course, other brunch booze staples like mimosas (grapefruit added a nice touch).\\n\\nOPENING ACT\\n\\nAs a starter, we had a daily special of biscuits and gravy. The dish was true enough to its roots to satisfy a southern classic like CCR, but unique enough to take us on a trip that even Jefferson Airplane would have be proud of. The twist? Three mini buttermilk clouds smothered with a venison sausage sauce and hint of heat. \\n\\nTHE HEADLINER\\n\\nThe stage was set. Slightly tipsy and warmed up by biscuits, we were ready for the main act -- steak and eggs. This was no lame cover band. THE DISH WAS AMAZING. But If I had to compare, I'd say it rocked like The Who. \\n\\nFour ingredients:\\n\\n1. The eggs, served scrambled with cheddar, would be pure Roger Daltry. Seductive. And blonde. \\n2. The meat was square cut and cooked to bloody perfection. This would be Pete Townsend who sent us into wind mill like bliss. \\n3. Underneath it all was a luscious cornmeal pancake -- the John Entwhistle bass line tying it all together.\\n4. And where's Keith Moon? Smothered over everything as jalapeno butter adding the rock and roll kick like only Keith can. \\n\\nWhen they came together in a cast iron skillet, this foursome showed up like the Who on that famous Saturday night in that muddy field in upstate New York. \\n\\nSo in summary, if you don't make it to Tasty and Son's, you might find yourself like so many sad boomers -- wondering what was so important that kept them from this defining experience of their generation? It's worth the journey. Don't miss it. You will regret it if you do."},{"name":"Hat Yai","address":"1605 NE Killingsworth St","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"We LOVED this place!

I crave sandwiches and burgers, not chocolate or donuts. I just don't ever feel like spending money and calories on desserts. Don't ask me why, I've just been this way for a while. All that being said, I can still appreciate good desserts and this was some pretty damn delicious ice cream. I booked a hotel through a site called Travel Portland and, with the booking, came a 'travel passport'. 8 or 10 places in Portland would stamp this thing for me and hook me up with something free. And with it, I had a free waffle cone coming from Salt and Straw. So middle of the day on a gorgeous Saturday afternoon (truly ice cream weather), we roll over to S&S.\\n\\nNow anyone who knows me knows that I love novel food. If you were to hand me a bowl of ice cream and tell me its cricket-huckleberry ice cream, I'd say 'where's the spoon?' So I was defiantly excited by what the menu had to offer. I tried samples of the Almond Brittle with Salted Gansche, Honey Balsamic Strawberry with Cracked Pepper and the Olive Oil. The almond was great, salty but not overpowering. The balsamic kind of dominated the other flavors, which is too bad because I love strawberry. And the olive oil, well, you defiantly knew that this was olive oil ice cream. Couldn't eat a full cone of that. The oil texture of it came through too much. What I ultimately went with was the Cinnamon Snicker doodle. Fantastic. It tasted like eating Cinnamon Toast Crunch with cookies interspersed in it. 12 year old Jeff would be very jealous of what present Jeff just got to eat. \\n\\nI gave Salt and Straw a four star rating, but that's just a four star rating for me. If you are a dessert/ice cream lover, you're going to love this place at a five star level. The novel flavors were fun and the ice cream was great. I'm quite pleased that we went here (actively patting self on the back)"},{"name":"Truluck's","address":"10225 Research Blvd, Ste 4000","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"This is one of my all time favorite happy hours!

Then, just when we thought there weren't any more opportunities for good restaurant etiquette to come shining through, she poured us a bottle of dessert wine to keep us happy while we waited for her to run our credit card through. \\n\\nIt is the little touches that go above and beyond your expectations that make a person, and a place, stand out. The Butcher Shop embodies this philosophy. For a place that has raw meat hanging on display, it says a lot that the details are what got my attention."},{"name":"Arby's","address":"17771 Lower Boones Ferry Rd","city":"Lake Oswego","stars":"3","text":"I wanted to take a moment to recognize your employee Derrick, he was informative, accurate, considerate of my child's safety, and authentically friendly...

It took about 30 minutes just to get our drinks, and we waited 1.5 hours for our food. Once it finally came, several of these friends were new to Indian cuisine and did not realize the wrong order had been placed in front of them. One friend in particular eats chicken but will not eat lamb, and she began eating a lamb dish without realizing it was lamb (she thought it was the chicken she had ordered, but after several bites and comparing to other's food, she realized it was lamb). She was very upset about this. Another friend who ordered lamb at a mild spice level got a chicken dish that was far too spicy for her; also she had gotten someone else's dish. We had to play musical plates because only one person out of all of us got the dish they had ordered, everyone else's was wrong or placed wrongly in front of someone else.\\n\\nWhen the mistakes were finally resolved, the food itself only was delicious.\\n\\nTonight, I called the restaurant four times. The first three times, no one answered, even though I went through the phone menu to the various options. I tried one last time and someone picked up. I placed my order of two entrees and one side dish (chicken tikka masala, lamb korma, and keema naan), all of which we were excited about. They took my name, and despite speaking clearly they couldn't understand it so I had to repeat. However when they told us it would be ready for pick up in 40 minutes, I said no, we have to cancel that order because that was too long of a wait. They hung up on me. I called back to make sure they heard I said cancel. All I could hear on the other end was a person say \\"I heard you, cancel\\" and they hung up again.

I've backed away from the beer scene lately (gotta watch those calories! kidding...kinda), but every single beer I've had at Easy Tiger during my visits has been absolutely delicious. It's a great spot to spend your entire night (I did so on my birthday), and also perfect for meeting up with friends before a night out (it's also SO close to other bars on East/Dirty 6th).\\n\\nFor the most part, I haven't had many of the beers listed on Easy Tiger's menu, so I told the waitress what I usually like (i.e. wheat beers, ales, etc.) and she brought out a couple of samples for me to try before I chose. First of all, I love that they let you sample beers because I hate ordering blindly and then getting stuck with something I'm not fond of. So far, my favorites have been the Alaskan Amber and one from Harpoon Brewery. Regardless, Easy Tiger legit has a beer to fit every taste. \\n\\nAlso, if you're not in the craft beer type of mood, they also have $2.50 Lone Star Tallboys!! 1) I love Lone Star. 2) I love tall things. 3) I love cheap things. Hence, I love Lone Star Tallboys at Easy Tiger.\\n\\nThe food, however, was kind of mediocre in my opinion though. I know many people are a huge fan of the pretzel and the beer cheese, however, my pretzel came out kind of cold and hard and was probably only somewhat enjoyable because any food is great when you're drunk, let's be real. So unfortunately, not a huge fan of the pretzel - it just kind of lacked the doughiness I hope for from a pretzel and the dough didn't have much flavor. The beer cheese however, is damn good. I would spread that thing on practically everything. It may just become my new nutella. Cause everything tastes good with some nutella.\\n\\nThe other items on the menu are pretty good and so is the bread they use in their artisan sandwiches. I've had the Smoked Turkey Breast and the Corned Beef, both of which were pretty good and substantial. I really like the fact that you can order just a half if you're not horribly hungry.\\n\\nAlthough the concept is very comparable to Flying Saucer, I would definitely say Easy Tiger is the better bet by far - they carry a number of beers Flying Saucer doesn't, has a great atmosphere, is a bit cheaper, pretty good food, and who can deny that outdoor patio?

This place is not as big as the maki maki in Brighton and instead of a buffet, it is a AYCE like Yamato and Sakura which you pick your selection on a sheet of paper and the chef make it order. They have lots of sashimi and nigiri choices like octopus, squid & yellowtail which is not often seen on other menus. My suggestion is order a lot on your first round because you don't know how long you will need to wait when you get your 2nd round. \\n\\nIn addition to the sushi, I recommend their tofu tempera or tofu teriyaki because it is not those firm tofu that we often see but instead it is the silken tofu which makes it soft on the insides and crispy on the outside...i'll pass on the shrimp tempura and salmon teriyaki because the shrimp is small on the shrimp tempura and the salmon teriyaki is thinly sliced and overcooked...I will give them an extra star if they serve salmon head or salmon belly teriyaki...\\n\\nThe reason that I didn't give this review a 5 star is because I also went there for lunch. Don't expect too much for 12.99... Limited selection of sushi, only tuna & salmon nigiri.

(Not that I did that, of course)\\n***OPEN LASAGNA - Assortment of seafood on top of their homemade lasagna noodles with a tomato-cream sauce. The amount of seafood in this dish was very generous, I actually didn't think there was enough pasta! I also ate the last of this. I just couldn't let it go to waste!\\n- Calamari (Appetizer) - The dinner appetizer contains a pepper sauce mix which is delicious. You just can't mess up calamari!\\n- Arincini balls(Appetizer) - Okay. Wasn't what I expected from arincini. Not enough cheese!\\n- Some dish with alfredo sauce and chicken with penne? (forgot the name) - I don't usually like overly creamy and heavy dishes like alfredo. Good if you like alfredo sauce!\\n- Steak with fusilli pasta (forgot the name) - Steak and pasta was good but nothing spectacular.\\n\\nI'm not exaggerating when I say the portions are GINORMOUS. One entree alone can feed 2-3 HUNGRY people. You definitely get the bang for your buck! And if you can - always pay extra for their homemade pasta.

I stopped by the place this Monday where I got a Quesadilla with Al Pastor and their large-sized (13\\") Burrito with Carnitas. The burrito was pretty good; the quesadilla was great. While I didn't think the portions were nearly as large as some other reviewers found them to be, they are quite generous with their ingredients (both the burrito and quesadilla are packed full of meat) and their prices are fairly low, making it a pretty good bargain. The food came quite quickly and the staff, while not the most attentive, were very friendly. All in all, I was quite impressed with this restaurant; it is definitely a great place in Vancouver for some tasty and affordable Mexican food.\\n\\n13\\" Burrito (Carnitas, $10.50):\\n3.5/5\\nThe burrito was filled with pulled pork, beans, and cheese, and was serve with sides of sour cream and avocado sauce (which I was unfortunately unable to sample as I'm allergic to avocadoes). The pulled pork was quite tender and juicy; it was completely savoury however, and I personally would have preferred some sweetness. They were pretty generous with the meat: the pork probably made up over 50% of the filling. While I couldn't really detect much of the cheese, the beans were creamy and flavourful. It was quite wet: a large amount of liquid/broth came out of the burrito when I cut it open, and it would probably have been quite messy to eat on the go. Portion-wise, I have to admit that I was initially a bit disappointed by the size: after reading some of the reviews from other patrons I was expecting something massive. Instead, the burrito I received was just of modest size, and not as big as the ones that I've gotten from Vallarta's or Bandidas. However, at just $10.50, I really can't complain.\\n\\nQuesadilla (Al Pastor, $11.00):\\n4/5\\nThe quesadilla came filled with pulled pork, pineapple, and cheese, and was again served with a side of avocado sauce. I really enjoyed this. The tortilla itself was hot, fresh, and had a great crispiness when it first came out (it did soften as it cooled, but was still delicious).

I'm typically willing to pay $12-$14 for a good chopped salad.  But i don't care how fresh or tasty your veggies are if the service is terrible.  And the last 2x i've been there, it's been ridiculously bad.  Like \\"Am I on Punked right now?\\" bad.  Both times a friend and I ordered online (separately) and 30 min later, i went to pick up our food.  The first time i arrived and went to the \\"pick up\\" counter, but had to wait until three others (including one person who walked in after me) ordered and had their salads made.  So it took about 10 minutes of me standing there before anyone would hand me my already paid for food.  No one said \\"Hi! We'll be with you in just a sec.\\"  No one acknowledged me at all.  In addition, they forgot one item of our order.  Tonight i decided to give it another try, but the moment I walked in I knew it was gonna be the same thing--but i was wrong.  It was way worse.  There were two people waiting in line at the register to buy sodas.  I was behind them, and there were two people who walked in right after me.  There were four people making salads, but no one on the register.  Again i stood there, this time for 15 min, waiting to be helped.  None of us waiting were acknowledged.  What is the point of ordering ahead only to have to stand there and wait in line?  After 15 min, someone finally came to the register to help us.  But--they didn't make my salads yet.  In fact i was told the order(s) hadn't \\"popped up until right now\\".  So we had ordered 45 minutes ago and i still had to wait while they made my salads.  I wasn't even offered a glass of water while i waited--just a weak \\"sorry about that\\".  While my salads were being made, i chatted with the two people who were in line behind me (and now were waiting again since the register gal was making my salads and again no one was helping those in line).  One guy was dining-in with his wife, who had already gotten her food and had completely finished it, plus a glass of wine, and the dude's salad still hadn't come out.  He told the staff \\"My wife is done eating and ready to go.  Either you comp the salad and make it to-go, or I just don't want it\\".  He had been waiting over 20 min while she ate.  They declined to comp his salad, so he and his wife left.  He told me that they're never coming back, that it's \\"always like this\\".  The next lady had placed an online order and--you guessed it--the salads weren't made/the order \\"wasn't received until just now\\".  If you're going to accomodate online orders, then for the love of kale, you gotta have someone check the computer for the orders!  Other suggestions:  hire a dedicated register person and train your staff to acknowledge the customers waiting.  Oh and comp items when you mess up.  Also, i've eaten there 6 times now and have signed up for the super complicated \\"loyalty program\\"--i have received no points or credits for those 6 visits.  Why so complicated?   This place has the potential to be great if the owner accepts the feedback of her customers and makes some changes.  I'm undecided if i'll ever return.  \\n\\nUpdate:  after reading my review, the owner wrote me immediately and was very cool and used my feedback to improve their customer service.  They added a dedicated register person, and the last two times i went in, my to-go salads were ready and waiting.

After 7 months, I finally got around to trying it out, and believe me when I say it did not disappoint.  Honestly, though, once I saw the menu they've managed to put together, I had complete confidence in the food before I even tasted a bite.  If you are the kind of restaurant with Irish Nachos, Meatloaf Sandwiches, and Broccoli Cheddar bites on your menu, then I will probably like your food.  Everything was great.  The nachos were smothered in delicious cheese, the ranch dressing was homemade, the sandwich rolls were fresh, and in lieu of salad croutons you get their delicious cheese puffs (which are reminiscent of a smaller version of a certain seafood chain's cheddar biscuits).\\n\\nIf i have any complaints it would be parking and ambience.  We arrived just before 6 and they weren't busy at all, but parking lot was mysteriously full.  We did manage to get a spot, but if you can't manage one, you're pretty much out of luck, as all the other parking is in residential neighborhoods (and not the kind where you'd feel comfortable parking in front of someone's house). \\n\\nMy only other issue was the crowd.  It was almost empty when we got there, but within 30 minutes the whole place had filled up with families.  I guess I hadn't anticipated a bar filling up with kids, but I guess that's what I get for eating dinner at 6.  There were kids everywhere, loud ones, with parents who didn't care at all about the relative volume of their children's voice.  Shouts for Mac & Cheese and sugary beverages abounded.  This is obviously not something Melton's can control, but if you don't have kids, and/or you don't like kids, you should probably wait until after bed time."},{"name":"Toast","address":"5222 SE 52nd Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"You might miss it because this section of 52nd doesn't seem like it would have a happening little eatery.

Oh and since we are on the topic of that delicious beverage sensation, they have vewy vewy good Bloody Mary's here. However, don't come between 2-5:30 PM as they are closed. I've heard weekends have lines.\\n\\nThe menu is pretty short and covers both breakfast and lunch, meaning that you don't get a lot of range since it is assumed that you would want to eat an omelette for lunch. \\n\\nI had an omelette and my dad had French Toast with his entire year's allotment of bacon on the side. He said it was great and enjoyed his bottomless cup of coffee too. My omelette didn't seem to really be three egg, but it was exceptionally fluffy. Billed as veggie stuffed, I found only two and one was celery which always strikes me as a filler veggie. But, it was savory celery. \\n\\nIt is sort of yuphoity, meaning I saw some overdressed real estate agents and ladies that lunch chatting away but since there was a cute 20 something slacker drinking coffee at the bar, it seemed balanced. The decor is Williams of Sonoma color scheme with framed pictures of all sorts of toasters on the wall. The neighborhood keeps it from getting too pretentious though and when I left, a family with kids was coming in. However, it also means you will pay $2.00 for an 8oz glass of orange juice, which is not, I might add, bottomless. \\n\\nOverall though, it was an oasis for a little family time and I would also bill it as a great \\"morning after date that lasted all night spot\\".

I guess it has something to do with it being the summer? \\n\\nAlso, I do not remember it being so expensive. My boyfriend and I each put $20 on our cards expecting that to last about 2 hours. Not really. Some games can cost up to $5 to play! \\n\\nOverall, I guess I would come again, but probably not until the school year starts. Probably on a Wednesday, when all the games are half off and the chances of a lot of kids being around are slim."},{"name":"Grand Buffet","address":"2625 Piedmont Rd NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"1.5","text":"If you look at my review star distribution, I don't have very many 1~2 star reviews.  Why?  Because sites like Yelp steers me clear of crap places like this particular atrocity.   \\n\\nAlas, I came here once a while ago without consulting fellow reviewers.  I was hungry and not particularly averse of Chinese buffets (in suburbs where many Asians reside, buffets can be extravagant and delicious, with fresh food and not just crabs but lobsters and dim sum aplenty).  I stumbled in and was instantly dismayed by what I saw.  Tiny, gloomy place, unsmiling servers (and customers), small selections of basic American Chinese stuff.  Taste ranged from bland to disgusting.  I think some of the servers took pity on me, like \\"oh lord how did this Asian guy end up eating here when Buford Highway was right around the corner\\".       \\n\\nI had since learned to just go ahead and walk out instead of toughing it out when I enter an establishment obviously reeking of sinister badness.

My husband and I had never heard of it since it's way out in East Boston (where we never have the chance/need to be), but we were game. After my friend told me that we were going to be meeting for Saturday lunch at 3pm, I knew something was up...\\n\\n...yep, you guessed it - this place (as per other reviews) was reviewed on Diner's, Drive-In's, and Dives, so it has quite a following. They open at 3pm and didn't take reservations for our small group, so we showed up at 2:45pm and waited in line for them to open (our group was probably sixth in the line). \\n\\nThe restaurant is small, but it's been re-done since some of the pictures I saw on Yelp reviews. It's quite weird that to go to the bathroom, you walk through the kitchen -- although none of them seem to mind that customers are wandering through looking for the bathroom. \\n\\nThe portions are gigantic. We ordered four dishes and the arancini appetizer and all of us took leftovers home. My husband and I actually ate ours for dinner the next day (that's how much we had left over!). The service is friendly and attentive, but despite there being no more line when we had finished our meal, we got the sense that they were trying to rush us out -- I guess they want to be prepared for the next crowd rush.\\n\\nBottom line? Great-tasting food that might have been made more difficult to enjoy due to its fame.

I have dined all over the world and Rino's is splendid...yet if your restaurant experience begins with your initial phone call for directions or a reservation...read on.\\n\\nOn July 23, 2011, we had tickets to a 7:10  Boston Red Sox game and had just left Salem at 2:00.  My daughter was famished and wanted to eat at Rino's which happened to be enroute.  We called and were told there was, \\"No wait.\\"\\n\\nUpon our arrival, parking was non existent.  We circled for about 15 minutes until we found a spot to park and commenced to walk the 10 minutes only to arrive and be placed # 6 on a waiting list.  What happened to the, \\"No wait?\\"  When we asked the woman taking names, she indicated that it wouldn't be long.  The temperature was over 100 degrees and we proceeded to wait...first 30, then 60, then 90, then 120...YES over two hours.  People continued to add their names to the waiting list and were told the same, \\"It shouldn't be long....\\"  ARE YOU KIDDING ME?  Now you ask, why didn't we leave, because we kept thinking, it won't be long and by now where else were we going to eat at 4:00-4:30 on a Saturday without waiting.  I may be from Los Angeles but I can assume that dinner on a Saturday evening will be a wait anytime after 5.\\n\\nWhen they called us, my daughter was so exhausted from the heat, she nearly threw up.  The bathroom goes through the kitchen and in fairness to Rino's, it holds 20-30 people.  With half the restaurant being seated via reservations, only about 10-15 are seated otherwise and the  meals are all cooked to order.

The Vietnamese short ribs are delicious, and we also got the spicy baby octopus skewer (great) and a pork skewer which could have used some kind of dipping sauce, but was cooked well at least. Add on to that some fried spring rolls and a couple of pork buns, and you'll know how full I felt. The prices were a little high for what you got food-wise, but I have no complaints about quality or service. Our server was attentive and helpful, although probably sad our bellies couldn't fit any dessert.

Everyone has been raving over this place and apparently Jimmy Carter!!!! was recently spotted there- super cool!  Also, the tequila shots were $1 that evening- also super cool!  And by the way- those were some strong shots!  \\n\\nAnyway- I joined the crowd a little late because the friend who was supposed to let me know when they arrived neglected to do so (you know who you are!!!!) and I had to pull up a chair and make a spot for myself.  The waiter had no problem with me doing that and didn't have a problem with our loud, large crew either.  He even created separate checks without being asked!!!  The dude was great!  So that part of my visit to Holy Taco was wonderful!\\n\\nI sat down and looked over the menu which is supposed to be full of sustainable and local foods- can we get more places on board for this?  Let me say that I both knew that this was a fusion \\"Mexican\\" type of place but frankly I was expecting a little bit more of the \\"Mexican\\" than I got.  Also, and this is me being weird- I don't like how some restaurants identify as \\"Mexican\\" (even when fusion) but then they have foods that are from other Spanish speaking places.  Sure, foods overlap and all but really- paella and jam√≥n Serrano are two things very native to Spain.  While I'm talking about the jam√≥n- why call the house fusion version of the traditional Serrano ham and cheese sandwich jam√≥n and cheese?  Just call it jam√≥n y ques, will ya?  Frankly, the stuff on the menu was stretching it to be called \\"Mexican\\" fusion.  It's like serving falsely in place of meatballs and offering pita instead of hamburger buns and calling a place Mediterranean fusion.\\n\\nBut the jam√≥n and cheese sandwich was what I got (after not finding much else that would suit my liking- seriously, rabbit?) and it was good.  It had quince as well and it gave it a very nice taste.  The flavor was actually very reminiscent of  Pinchos de D√†tiles y Bacon Fritos which I love and had while in Spain.  It was a little stringy, though making it a bit difficult to bite into without having a bit of an issue.  \\n\\nThere were two pieces of lettuce leaning against my sandwich.  Garnish?  Salad?  What the hell?  I really don't know.  I didn't get utensils so I'm leaning more towards garnish.  But it looked a little like it had been drizzled.  Whatever.  It was pretty greasy.  As were the chips.\\n\\nThe place is a no inside smoking place, too.  I don't know if that is a DeKalb thing or what.  A super cute little toddler was not far away from me and she was a delight but I don't know what she was supposed to be eating!  It seemed like a weird place to take a kid.\\n\\nService was GREAT and the shots were GREAT but the food- meh- eat somewhere else and drink it up at Holy Taco."},{"name":"Tonic","address":"1316 Commonwealth Avenue","city":"Brighton","stars":"2.5","text":"Thank God this place closed down.

I'd get it again without the tikka and I'm sure I'd love it.\\n\\nThe chicken al pastor was amazing! That's my favorite so far.\\n\\nMy boyfriend had the half chicken with the spices. Wow. That was really tasty too.\\n\\nI ordered the veggies again and finally got to try them...not a fan. The veggies themselves weren't the problem. It was the vinegar all over them. I despise vinegar. It would've been nice to know prior to ordering them that they were covered in vinegar, especially since grilled veggies don't usually have vinegar on them.\\n\\nThe food is tasty, the service was very good this time, and I left full."},{"name":"Phil's Icehouse","address":"13265 US Hwy 183 N","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Love Phil's next to Amy's ice cream -- they share a nice playground.

The soft boiled marinated egg was perfectly cooked. The pork gyoza was good as expected. No complaints there. \\n\\nFor starters, great price point. It is rare to find a ramen shop where you can enjoy a meal for under $10. As another reviewer pointed out, it is not the best nor it is the worse.

Pam served us and was very sweet and right on top of things. \\n\\nThere were a few specials and we looked over the breakfast and lunch menu before settling on the Gyro Omelet and the Banana Bread French Toast (which was a special.) \\n\\nGyro Omelet: Fantastic. I am not normally one to get omelets stuffed with meat for breakfast, but it sounded interesting and it was a great choice. The omelet is stuffed with gyro meat, tomatoes, topped with some cheese, and comes with tzatziki sauce on the side. It was one of those meals where I was so thrown off by the idea of it, and afterward, so happy I tried it! \\n\\nBanana Bread French Toast: They should make this a menu staple. It was simple but very well executed. The french toast was thick-sliced, moist and not to overbearingly sweet. It did come with syrup, but I think you could do without it, it was so good on it's own. \\n\\nThe ONLY thing I would say could be improved is their hours. They are only open for breakfast and lunch, so 1pm is the cut off for a Sunday afternoon.

I then walked outside with her and pointed out our table where my wife was still sitting - she then walked back inside to a computer screen, presumably to see what we had ordered and when.   My wife later told me that while I was inside talking with the manager, the waitress came to our table with a drink re-fill for me and said she'd check on our meals (salads, no less) that had been ordered about 30 minutes prior, and my wife told the waitress that we were leaving and the waitress just said \\"ok\\", never apologizing or saying she would get a manager.  My wife then walked up and the manager never offered us anything such as a complimentary meal in the future, a take-out of our order for free, or even a dessert to go --- and she never said anything about finding out what had gone wrong - she just said, \\"I'm sorry\\" - right, that only goes so far. - pitiful customer service.

A group of 4 of us shared the pork ragu and egg, so creamy and delicious. The Shakshuka with tomatoes and peppers, so yummy with bread. The stewed pork with rice which tasted like a vietnamese dish was too sweet, and we had the sausage omelet with asparagus which I thought was too plain but the egg was fluffy.
