I was looking forward to trying their baos which are like steamed bun sandwiches but found out through Yelp that they're only served during lunch hours. Too bad :(\\n\\nWe arrived around 7pm and the restaurant was pretty full. We didn't have to wait too long to get a table for two though.\\n\\nThe mood inside the restaurant was very energetic and the ambience had a hipster feel. I especially liked their wallpaper. We were surprised at how pricy the items on the menu were. Most of the dishes were at least $15, with a lot of them even going over $20. I thought the drinks were way too pricy too, especially the cocktails ($12-$15). The service wasn't great either. We had to ask twice to get a glass of water and we waited over 30 minutes for our first dish to come out. We wanted to order some fresh oysters too but their special ones for $1 were sold out. You need to order a minimum of 6 so we passed since the other oysters were around $2-3 each.\\n\\nWe ordered 2 dishes to share. The first was Fly Rice, which was basically fried rice with pork, slaw, crispy garlic, water chestnuts, and a fried egg. The egg was nicely cooked the pork was pretty good and flavourful. The water chestnuts were a nice addition too. However, the dish as a whole was subpar. Firstly, the dish was not hot at all when it came out -- it wasn't even warm... Secondly, bits of the rice were hard, not crispy. Not a very big portion either. The rice was probably less than a bowl.\\n\\nOur second dish, the King Fish, was a fail. We waited about an hour for this to come out and we had already finished our previous dish. Even worse, when I cut into the fish to split it between the two of us, I noticed that the inside was a pale, grey colour... It was raw. :( You could see that it was still bleeding red at the top too. We showed our server and she apologized and sent it back to the kitchen, saying that she'll bring out a new one for us.\\n\\nBy that time, we were already very unimpressed and wanted to just cancel that order and leave since we thought it would probably take another hour for them to cook up a new one. However, another lady, who was the manager/supervisor(?) came to our table and apologized and explained what happened. Apparently the fish they had prepped for had been sold out already but there was a miscommunication between the kitchen and the servers so they didn't know. We shouldn't have been allowed to order it but since we had already done so, the chefs had to cut a piece from a new batch and it was too thick. She then offered to give us another dish on the house. We agreed and took another look at the menu. She was very helpful and friendly, which helped ease our frustration.\\n\\nAs soon as we decided on what to order, the previous server brought back the fish that had been re-fired. They said we could still have it if we like, so we did just to try it. It wasn't good though. It was the same dish we had sent back and they just grilled the fish again. They didn't even change the papaya salad or the plate... :( By that time, the fish was already dry and didn't really have much flavour left to it. We didn't like the papaya salad either. It tasted weird because the acidic and spicy flavours didn't mesh together very well, unlike other papaya salads I've had.\\n\\nAnyways, moving on... The additional dish we decided to get was the Jumbo Black Tiger Prawns. This was much better. We had it with garlic fried rice but the rice still wasn't hot. At least the prawns were hot and freshly cooked. They were seasoned generously, giving it good flavour and they weren't overcooked, thankfully.\\n\\nAll in all, quite the disappointing experience here at Bao Down, given that we dined for around 2 hours waiting for our food, only to find out that it was not cooked properly. However, I am glad that they took steps to resolve our problems by taking care of our 2 dishes. We only had to pay for our first dish, the fried rice. They definitely have a lot to work on in terms of quality of food and timeliness of service, especially for their prices. Maybe their baos are better -- I'll have to go during lunch next time.

At the same time, we were dodging massive tumbleweeds hurtling across the freeway.  If that wasn't enough, we were buffeted by heavy winds and hard rain between Hood River and Troutdale.  And everybody knows what a treat that stretch of I-84 is when it is raining, particularly when you have to pass a semi and you can't see through the water the truck throws up.  So, Bar Lolo was the ideal remedy for jangled nerves.\\n\\nWe loved Bar Lolo's ambience, enhanced by huge windows along two walls.  Never having been here before, we called to make reservations, but were told reservations are only made for parties of six or more.  However, we were assured that being seated would not be a problem.  That turned out to be true, as we were the only patrons when we first arrived (though the restaurant began to fill up during our dinner).\\n\\nJP and I opted for the drink of the day:  gin tonic made with a cranberry orange peel infused gin prepared with Fever Tree Tonic ($8).  The drink size was decent and gin imbibers who like flavorful drinks that are not too sweet will like this one.\\n\\nIn true tapa fashion, we ordered several dishes:  including crostini, flatbread, deviled eggs (topped with anchovies), calamares, chickpea stew and lamb sliders.  Our favorite dish was the chickpea stew.  Though it might have just had the slightest tad too much cumin, we loved its buttery broth, spinach and saffron.  Upon ordering this dish, I came to discover that a chickpea is the same as garbanzo bean.\\n\\nWe also liked the calamares (calamari) spiced with piquillo pepper.  Accompanying the calamari was a very very nice saffron aoili.  Yet, the calamari might have stood to have a pinch less salt.  \\n\\nMy least favorite dish were the lamb sliders.  Oh, the lamb itself was great, topped with manchego cheese and roasted red piquillo pepper.  But gee, the sliders came on, yep you guessed, those ubiquitous Brioche buns.  The Brioche buns had a lousy texture, but what Brioche bun doesn't?  \\n\\nNonetheless, service was great,  and JP and I agreed we want to return."},{"name":"Houston's Restaurant","address":"3321 Lenox Rd NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"I witnessed the most discriminatory event of my entire life yesterday.

We recently moved into Mueller and decided to try out this place. My husband and I don't get a lot of date nights because of his work hours, so many of our \\"dates\\" include our 2 year old, so needless to say, when we go out, our expectation is that our experience is positive.  For a night where there were only 4 other tables, the service was incredibly slow. I would hate to see what service would be like on a busy night!  It took 45 mins for our daughter to get her kids pizza... and with a 2 year old, that is literally an eternity.  I wouldn't necessarily call myself a pizza expert, but I know my pizza. Regular old fast food slices, deep dish, Neapolitan style and wood oven...I've had them all. I'm also from Toronto which is kinda a foodie city and have travelled all over and have had some pretty good pies. This pizza was terrible. Honestly, the worst pizza I've ever had. I ordered the prosciutto and arugula pizza which is usually my old reliable go-to. Well, not only was the pizza as tasteless and dry as a board, but I think they forgot the 4 cheese blend and truffle oil, as the pizza had none of these things. So basically a hard piece of thin dry over cooked flat bread with the smallest pieces of hard prosciutto sprinkled post oven and a pile of raw arugula in the middle.  There was literally no taste. Like eating crusty sawdust with dry leaves. No oil. No cheese. Trash. Needless to say I took 3 bites and the pizza was abandoned.  I will say that we did order their interpretation of bruschetta which was quite tasty, so there is at least one menu item which I would describe as eatable. \\n\\nThis is my first Yelp review and am not one to criticize a business on any type of social platform, but I felt so annoyed that we wasted one of our rare date nights here and was served that terrible pizza, I feel like I have to write this review.

It's definitely a more adult oriented experience.  There was a car with Hawaiian plates.  Lottsa BMW/MB/Lexi/Acuras in the lot. The D&G on display isn't a knockoff.\\n\\nLet's talk food.  I want to like their signature cooked to order Angus burger.  Really I do.  At $11 including fries it should blow my taste buds away. And it has.  In the past.\\n\\nLately (over the last few years) I've noticed a trend toward quality control slippage.  The buns seem a little stale, cold & they aren't toasted they way they used to be.  The lettuce on Saturday's visit flew a little to close to the sun (the grill) and was burnt/wilted along the edges on one side.  I wouldn't put lettuce out on my table at home unless I wanted to catch flack.  I mean it's lettuce fergodsakes.  If you scorch it on accident replace it with a new green leaf.  The medium cooked patty was too pink to be considered anything but cooked MRare.  The tomato was decent but the hard green core was still intact.  At $11 you could gouge that part out back in the kitchen instead of making me do it for you.  The fries are good.  The O-rings could use a lighter hand on the beer in the batter.  Otherwise they are excellent.  The ribeye was decent.  The traditional pizza had great fennel sausage & onions but the sauce, cheese & crust left alot to be desired.  Overall the food seemed kinda cold.  Not to mention we were seated under an a/c vent that was freezing cold.  Normally that's a great thing in my book but it was the 1st real fall weather in Austin and the high was only like 70.  Why not turn the a/c up a few degrees & not cool down the already too cold food?\\n\\nSo overall I'm going to backburner NXNW for awhile.  I'll probably come back at some point in the future in a few years because I dig the look & feel of the space not to mention all the rich dorks eating there make for a great freakshow.  Plus I wanna keep my hopes alive that they will return to the glory days of culinary awthumness they used to have on display back in the day or something."},{"name":"Chris' Caribbean Bistro","address":"4479 S Cobb Dr","city":"Smyrna","stars":"4","text":"Amazing!

Short version- The Good: entrees of pancakes and steak tacos, and the cafe mocha. The Not That Good: the rest of the experience. \\n\\nBasically, if we had walked right in and sat down at a nice table on the patio and were served our entrees in 10 minutes after ordering, it would have been perfect. But we had a medium-long wait, about 20 minutes. The mocha I ordered was excellent, though. We were sat at a two-top inside that I guess is usually pushed together with the next one to make a 4, because we had to move several times as there was no aisle for people to easily move through the area. The pastry basket looked great, but most of it was kind of dry. I ordered one dish but 10min later Joy came out to tell me they were out of the bread for it, so I had to reorder. The pancakes were enormous and fluffy, but came with no butter or syrup, and it took a long time to get our server to bring it out, and they got a little cold. The steak tacos were fine, but our sides of bacon and sausage were both not good. The sausage looked to be frozen-patty variety, and the bacon was poorly reheated and tasted a bit off. We also had a hard time getting cream/sugar for regular coffee, and were never offered a refill. Or spoons. Really. \\n\\nSo, despite having what should be one of the best brunch patios in the city, unless they step up the service game and some of the details, it's going to be tough to make this a regular stop for brunch.

Upon entry, I quickly put my name down for a twenty minute wait to be seated. I immediately appreciated the dining space. It was open, airy, and modern. Though, I do wish that the owners had not covered the windows facing west, especially the clerestories. It would have helped alleviate the rather flat lighting. (Am I being nit-picky? The answer is yes.)\\n\\nBut on to the food! It is very, very traditionally American. Not a bad thing at all, but the two non-traditional dishes, jambalaya and migas, stood out. They were still good though. Anyway, the buffet was surprisingly large. There were salads and pies and grits and pastries and meat. Oh the meat. If there is one thing you must know about Jack Allen's, it is order the meat. Be it chicken or pork or sausage. But not the ham. I was not a fan of the ham.\\n\\nSo yeah, this place was good. But, you know what, I probably won't be coming back. My dad decided that you do not need to tip as much at a buffet. After all, you had to get the food yourself.

The tea is pricey for sure, and I was a bit disappointed in the limited vegetarian options, though our waiter accommodated our efforts to bastardize the menu by picking and choosing specific tea sandwiches. I ended up with smoked salmon, which was a solid choice. The scones were exceptional, so that was a win for me. I ordered a macaron on the side and was delighted with the light flavor. It was perfection.

We ordered a kid's yakisoba, and to my surprise it had NO vegetables in it. It was literally the yellow yakisoba style noodle type but no veggies added. Traditionally yakisoba has at the very last cabbage and some carrot and onion, but nothing. Kid loved it though, because well, chicken, carb and sweet sauce.. the portion was very small even for kids for the high cost. \\n\\nI got the chicken teriyaki dinner combo. The lack of vegetables again in my yakisoba was extremely disappointing. Please don't call it yakisoba if you're not going to cook it as yakisoba (call them plain egg noodles or something). The chicken teriyaki caters to the American palette, it was a very dry chicken breast. Traditionally chicken teriyaki is skin on thigh meat which has a lot more flavor, but even if it was breast meat it was over cooked. \\n\\nThe asparagus and cheese roll had far too much cream cheese in it, it could have made do with 2/3 less cheese and some additional textures.\\n\\nThey use garnet yams for anything described as 'sweet potato' which is very odd instead of using japanese sweet potatoes which are yellow and dry. Even my vegetarian friend who is not as familiar with japanese food thought it was unusual. The garnet yam is very wet which was strange in the tempura and sushi. The veggie tempura to go was placed in a completely enclosed clamshell at the bottom of the bag so it was very thoroughly humid and uncrispy when we got to it. Most restaurants that do fried items to go will at least cut ventilation holes or partially cover to prevent that from happening and place the item on top.\\n\\nThe worst offense of all was my order of tamago nigiri. Sushi fans will know that the tamago nigiri reflects the quality and skill of an establishment. They gave me the end piece which I have never heard of being served, and there was only one piece. It had a spongy texture, maybe from being the end piece. \\n\\nPositives: Kid loved kid yakisoba despite the lack of veggies.

Normally a JUG would be enough for 4 people easily. I split a JUG with one other person and it was amazing. \\n\\nThe food tho... ok. We started with the meatballs. Very good moist and amazing flavor. The sauce is where it's at tho. I could put that sauce on anything and eat it! Fantastic. Then we had the aronchini appetizer. The arrrochini was the best I have ever had. That says a lot! Yes I'm saying it was better than NY. Just this once. But we got a pizza. Now I'm not really big on getting pizza out of NY and although this was a different type of pizza it was amazing ! The pizza was sooo fricken fresh. The dough was on point ! It had cheese bacon corn and tomatos with fresh herbs! Omg I'm not kidding it freaked me out! It was that good! No lie. Sometimes the best foods are the simplest just don't right. This is the perfect example of that. We also had a chicken parmesan. And a pasta with sauce which was good as well. \\n\\nOverall. I will 100% be back to capo.

It was an omelette that was wrapped around a thin crepe and filled with either tuna or you could select the vegetarian option which was avocado and tofu bacon with a side salad. I had mines with tuna which I thought was going to be dry but it was actually very moist and flavorful. I'm pretty sure it was mixed with a lot of mayo. The omelette was surprisingly thin which I liked because it made the dish very light especially since there was a crepe and it was filled. The crepe inside was also very pleasant because it was thin as well and some parts were crispy on the edges which was nice. The side salad was drizzle with this orange miso vinaigrette and topped with dried cranberries and granola. The dressing was very nice and light, and refreshing. It was a bit tart and also kind of sweet so it had a good balance. Even though I had nothing negative to say about my dish, I wouldn't pay for it again because it was very expensive for $17.

I've exclusively dined at this Buckhead location even before relocating to Atlanta; even had my photo taken, after a celebrity siting (RHOA, NeNe Leakes) inside the crowded entry area--because there is always a wait! \\n\\nIf Houston's did those automated survey's that some companies text out and asked the ubiquitous questions \\"on a scale of 1 to 10 where 10 being the highest\\" how often would you return? or would you recommend to a friend? my responses would always be '10'. Even on one occasion having waited almost 2 hours for seating, I would still give it high marks. \\n\\nThe quality of service and food are what matters to this foodie. To boot, last night we had the pleasure of an awesome server named Toya. She was extremely welcoming, had personality for days, and went so far as to unknowingly impress my son because later on she called him by name. She was attentive. She had to be Valedictorian of Servers--she shared the feature meals, explaining how they were prepared all the way down to the butter and seasoning! She was friendly and funny. She ultimately took the time to box up the remainder of the meals, while making for good last moments conversation.  She ended our time by saying how much she enjoyed us and asked if we made room for dessert. I would definitely make it a point to ask for Toya in any future visits. \\n\\nNow to change direction.  I've been going to Houston's for over twenty years and can say I have seen the increase (!) in prices. It's become one of those dining experiences where my husband and I have to ask ourselves: If we want that Chicago Spinach Dip and our go-to entrees of choice bad enough to have to buy double apps and three additional moderately priced meals? Not to mention a wait with impatient and tape worm hungry teenagers--we wanted some Houston's! Houston's has also done away with free refills in exchange for bottle carbonated beverages which equates to per refill expenses that add up. This doesn't bother me because I'm an avid lemon water drink whether at home or out and about. Thankfully and because it's soda/Coke, and not an imported beer that my husband orders, he is usually good with one soda. On this visit, my son had a double. YOLO! Save for my daughters having water like their mama. God bless them!\\n\\nSpeaking of daughter, my oldest made the audible comment about it taking \\"five-ever for the food\\" (read as service was slow). I noticed that too. Houston's always seems overly staffed to accommodate the round-the-clock rush of their establishment. Last night, I felt like we had an unusually high amount of unfamiliar servers and staffers coming by, refilling water, dropping off appetizer plates, returning with our appetizers, before our server Toya returned to take our dinner orders. It had me thrown off. Because I was on the exceptionally hungry side my stomach noted the time between completed appetizer and meal delivery. \\n\\nDuring dinner, I also noted how the table next to ours--wait wasn't quite as long (and they had several prime rib dinners coming). I digress. I will add that the table to the other side of us evidently had a bit of slow service. I overheard management explain what their bank statement would like like once their discount was reapplied for their meal, despite having already charged out. The table had been waiting on a To Go meal that took forever to come. I thought that was an acceptable touch from Houston's management. The customer was happy to accept the intended meal discount after the fact. I was glad to overhear that it came from management and not the customer, as it should be where impeccable customer services is bar none in an establishment. \\n\\nLastly and working my way backwards, during our outdoor patio wait (quoted 40-45 minutes but was actually seated in 30... Yes, I start my iPhone timer when given wait estimations. Yelpers should try it too!) I was bummed that a couple who had come from picking up a few drinks, while they too waited, lit up to smoke directly within our vicinity. Coming from a hometown where even patio smoking has been banned feels like regression. Maybe it isn't fully banned and I'm having delusions of grandeur, hoping for a cleaner air America. When you consider peek wait times, crowded patios where customers clammer for available seating--playing musical-guests-are-gone-to-their-table-inside--hurry and get that chair before someone new walks up who hasn't been waiting nearly as long, allowing waiting customers to muck up the air just doesn't seem par for the course. \\n\\nHouston's we have a problem. Thankfully, your menu is worth sucking it up. And the flat-screens in both restrooms aren't too shabby either...if you're over 6 feet tall enough to see what's on TV. Save electricity and somewhere down the line I hope you consider implementing to save our lungs."},{"name":"Wings n Grill","address":"2883 N Decatur Rd, Ste 2883E","city":"Decatur","stars":"4","text":"My husband and I went through a phase where we ate here twice a week.

Growing up, I worked at a Cajun restaurant and our kitchen looked close to that, but there was smoke barreling out of the door they left open, so I'm thinking there are some major ventilation issues here. The guy who helped me was coverrrred in sweat, which is not hygienic at all. They need some AC and some ventilation. A light in the front cab part was covered in a mix of dusty cobwebs, and the iPad payment station and the top of the hot sauce bottle sitting on the ledge were covered in black smudges, like this was an auto repair shop. \\n\\nFood trucks usually only have a subset of their menu on any given day, but the day I visited, the Boudain Hut only had poboys, some boudain balls, and some sides. No baskets or fries at all, no fried or blackened crawfish or gator available. I was disappointed in this. \\n\\nI ordered a side of etoufee and a side of crawfish boudain balls, and my order was super cheap, which is a benefit. However, my etoufee was bad. It was way lighter than any etoufee I've had and also had sage or a similar spice in it, which I'm not a fan of, and again, is not something I've ever seen my Cajun family put in. Beyond the first bite, I realized why it was so cheap. There was one tiny layer of etoufee and then the rest was pure rice. But the rice was more than al dente. It wasn't even fully cooked. One bite of rice at the bottom had black stuff on it, like it had been scraped out of an unclean pot. \\n\\nThe crawfish boudain balls were coated in panko, which was a nice touch, and they tasted pretty good. They weren't spicy at all, which was appreciated. And, the remoulade sauce they came with was on point. I wished I paid an extra .50 for a second container. BUT, there was 1 single crawfish tail in two of them, and two crawfish tails in the third and final boudain ball. \\n\\nFurther, I was about 7th in line and had to wait 10 minutes to order, and another 10 minutes even to get my food.

And, I was expecting a bit more flavour from the Hainanese rice I chose to go with this dish.\\n\\nThe Coconut Seafood Fried Rice is good.  Very subtle coconut flavour, not a lot of seafood other than chopped up bits of shrimp and squid.

I agree with other reviews that it was very disappointing despite all the hype. The first drink I ordered was one made with saffron and pineapple rum, I was not a fan. However the waiter did notice I didn't like the drink and offered to replace it very quickly, which was great! Above all the service is great and the servers are very knowledgeable, but the food was not the best. We got the 9-course tasting menu and I think I liked 3/9 courses, let's say 2.5/9 because a lot of the components were not the best tasting. Everything we tried we described as \\"interesting\\" which translates to not that good but bearable I guess. I just was not pleased with their September tasting menu and I don't think I would come back. The taste of the food was very one-note, earthy, fermented flavors, a lot of oil/vinegar flavors but just nothing I found appetizing. In fact there were many dishes I took one bite of and couldn't do another. The squash dish I took a picture of was my LEAST favorite, it smelled good but the squash was extremely al dente, almost cold/hard and was covered in seeds that were an unpleasant crunch. The duck pictured was the one meal i actually loved, it was Smokey and sweet and had the most flavor of anything i tried. Their beef tartare was among the most disappointing because I've had amazing beef tartare but theirs lacked a lot of flavor and had really crunchy pieces of puffy rice that were unpleasant to chew while eating such soft meat. The KOMBUCHA IS A NO GO. It smelled like that pepper juice you put on collard greens and was not good. Lastly, to end the meal, the miso chocolate and some pepper jelly thing they gave us left us feeling unsatisfied. I was actually still very hungry leaving this almost $600 dinner. I do not feel it was worth the money, but we went for the experience nonetheless. The volume of the restaurant went from extremely loud where we couldn't hear each other speak to quiet and then back up again.

You can't go wrong with any of those. Favorite drink is \\"the captain\\" but when i have to be good, the oat milk nitro latte. I love how fresh the food is & how they are conscious about where the food comes from as well. Don't forget to get one of the cookies!!! the lavender one is sooo good! \\n\\nVibe:\\nYou can't go wrong with all the old school hip hop they play there. They definitely mix it up but whenever i go it seems to be 90s hip hop. The outside is just perfect. You get a nice view of the fire pits & the outside area of atlanta dairies. Also loving the inside. Some of the tables have places where you can plug your laptop in & charge your phone. Also!!! can we talk about how they are open till 10PM? Unheard of from a coffee shop.

Tried it for the first time today and it was better than expected.  I had passed by once and grabbed a menu as the prices were good, and my quick glance at their selection wasn't bad.  There have been a number of Thai Places opening in the financial district recently (3 within a half mile of each other) but an order of Pad Thai is $8-9, so I figured at $5, I had to give this a shot.  Their food is made in the back but sits in pans buffet style behind the counter so you can see what you're getting.  I have never ordered Pad thai this way so quality could vary depending on when you go and how long it's been sitting, but given the portions and prices I can't imagine it sits there very long.  Long story short, all the food looked good, but since I only got Pad that that's what I'll stick to here.  It was chicken and shrimp pad thai, with an ok ratio of noodles to protein.  It wasn't overly greasy like it can be at some places, and hot sauce and peanuts are available on the side.  It wasn't the best I have ever had but was definitely still good, and as a previous poster noted, you could probably get to lunches out of it.  They filled a large 3 section takeout box.  \\n\\nThe place is also pretty easily overlooked as it is inside the building and not really visible from the street.

We had the edamame hummus (gf/v, which meant served with veggies instead of wonton chips) which was good, but probably would have been better with the won ton chips. (It was a weird combination with the veggies, but was good by itself.) I also had the Ramaki Pasta with tofu, rather than pork. It was a pretty big portion and was pretty tasty. The server/bar tender brought us out siracha sauce and it was a good addition to the pasta as well.\\n\\nFor drinks, we had the mystery brew (delicious), My Blue Hawaii (fruity/sweet, very delicious, what you would expect for a Hawaiian drink), and the Caramelized Pineapple Coffee Grog ( a little too bitter for my liking, but had a distinct flavor others might like).\\n\\nOverall, was a really cute place that we really enjoyed.

Their regular menu is pretty vast, but I was overwhelmed and the buffet looked really great. Service was very chill and friendly. Must try this place if you like middle East/Asian/Nepal food. Especially their Goat Curry made of Goat meat cooked with tomato, green onion, cilantro, ginger and garlic; and their Chicken 65 which are boneless cubes of chicken marinated with deep fried and cooked with sauces, ginger, garlic and spices; both are mouthwatering examples of fine Nepali cuisine. They also have amazing garlic butter naan.\\n\\nThe absolute best value is during lunch time, when they have a lunch buffet. You can try so many different things.

Definitely try their Chicken Momos (dumplings) which is made of minced chicken with onion, garlic and Himalayan spices wrapped in dough and steamed; as those things are amazing although a bit pricey for the amount that you get. They do serve Indian beers like Taj Mahal and King Fisher. Generally quiet place, except when they're having music or any special events. A word of warning; their scale of spiciness is calibrated higher than westerners' palates, mild may be hot enough for you. The owner here is very friendly.

Kao Fu is very juicy and flavorful, provides a good taste counterbalance for all the other stuff, with a good portion size as well. Sheng Jian Bao (pan fried buns) on the other hand were lackluster, the bottom was a bit crumbly and the top insufficiently fried, also tends to be just a bit too big. Nuo Mi Ci (fried sticky rice cake) was somewhat tasteless. Siu Mai was decent tasting. Beef rolls were great. Red bean buns were solid. Wuxi ribs were extremely tender and have great sauce, but it seems as though they just slow-cooked the ribs and then drizzled the sauce on, as the flavor didnt make it into the meat.\\n\\nBut really the xiao long bao is the important stuff and I'm sure what most of the people that read these reviews care about, so yes, 5 stars based on that. Also, the last time I went there you get a free order of xiao long bao as long as you order over $45 (I think; it was a couple months ago and I'm working through my reviews backlog so I don't remember the specific amount, but it was somewhere around that) worth of food."},{"name":"Ball Square Cafe","address":"708 Broadway","city":"Somerville","stars":"4.5","text":"Great menu, large quantity of food that more than adequately fulfilled our breakfast requirements for the day.

That's not to say they taste bad necessarily; just not what I'm used to. The poke is a great example; it's not prepared how you'd expect in Hawaii, but it isn't horrible. \\n\\nIt's a little over-done with the \\"Hawaiian\\" decor as well. Kinda like your neighbor who stocks up on Hawaiian themed decor from Party City and says they're throwing a \\"luau\\" in their backyard and grills up some pineapple chicken. \\n\\nI come here occasionally when I work nearby downtown, but I probably wouldn't go out of my way. \\n\\nThe owners are sweet, it's inexpensive, and the food is okay."},{"name":"Capa Steakhouse & Bar","address":"10100 Dream Tree Blvd","city":"Orlando","stars":"4.5","text":"Perfect in every way!

We had about an hour to kill before our Red Sox game and ended up at The Lansdowne Pub mainly because they were the only place without a wait. All the other bars and restaurants in the area had 30+ minute waits but we were seated right away at The Lansdowne Pub which was a refreshing change! Service is friendly and since they ARE a pub you can get pretty much whatever you want to drink. We were here for a quick lunch so we didn't drink but the prices looked pretty reasonable. \\n\\nWe ordered the Irish Breakfast (Irish bacon, white & black pudding, breakfast banger, grilled tomato, Batchelors beans, toast, fried eggs) and the Fried Fish Sandwich (tartar sauce, coleslaw, malt vinegar fries). This was our first time trying a traditional Irish breakfast and it was pretty good! I found it to be a little too heavy but I think that's the point. My husband enjoyed everything except for the white & black pudding. It was good but nothing that I would ever crave. I enjoyed my fried fish sandwich.  The fish was cooked properly so that it wasn't dry when I bit into my sandwich and it retained a nice crunch. Still, I ended up removing the bread off my sandwich towards the end because there was just too much bread compared to the amount of fish. The coleslaw was pretty good. Something was slightly off with the dressing though. I couldn't put my finger on it. Still, nothing to really complain about. \\n\\nWe enjoyed our lunch here for the most part but the problem was that nothing stood out. Everything tasted just A-OK and it wasn't anything to write home about. Service while friendly was on the slow side. We waited a very long time for our check at the end of our meal.

Not really you get better food at marlows for less but I did not feel ripped off like I did at Cru . We sat outside and their was live music and a great ambiance. The service was excellent this time. I give them a solid 3 because the food was good but not great. If you want to charge me for $16 burger and $1 to add cheese that's fine but make that burger amazing .

I've yet to find a better calzone. And their pizza is pretty good too, among the best Neapolitan-style pizza joints in the city. I'm definitely a fan of this place.\\n\\nThis is the second location of Varuni and it opened inside Krog Street Market in May 2017. Their original location in Morningside (https://bit.ly/2SX2yiE) opened in April 2014. All of the stalls at Krog Street are unique and Varuni may have the most distinct one of them all. Their stall wraps around two corners and features an open kitchen with a handmade Stefano Ferrara wood-burning brick oven imported from Naples, Italy. It's the same style of oven used at the Morningside location as well as Antico and other Neapolitan pizza restaurants in the Atlanta area.\\n\\nYou can sit at the counter and watch pizza, calzones, and other food get made from scratch. Pizzas only take a few minutes to prepare and bake. I think it's neat to see the calzones assembled and placed in the deep fryer. It's interesting to see how everything comes together, from the raw mounds of dough to the hot and wonderful-smelling finished products.\\n\\nKrog Street Market has limited surface lot parking at the corner of Lake Ave and Waddell St. I recommend street parking along Lake, Waddell, or any of its offshoots. It's free. Inside the market, Varuni's storefront sits across from Makimono (facing Krog St). It looks nice. Along with the open kitchen, it's got a brick and tile design with stone counters and Edison lighting. If you dine in, you have to bus your own table.\\n\\nVaruni's fried calzone is known as the \\"KSM (Krog Street Market) Special\\" ($12). You can customize your own red (margherita) or white (bianca) pizza starting at $12 and add up to two toppings that cost $1-3 each. All pizzas are 12 inches and \\"individual\\" sized though two people could easily split one. If you don't want to build your own pizza, they have five reds and five whites with preset ingredient combinations that you can choose from ($15-16 each). They also offer $9 salads, a $10 meatball Parm (sub sandwich; we saw one of these and it looked terrific), and arancini (rice balls), three for $6.\\n\\nWe visited for dinner and had:\\n\\n* KSM Special ($12) - fried calzone with fresh mozzarella, Pecorino Romano, basil, and two toppings; we got Italian sausage and prosciutto di Parma (there was a $1 upcharge for the prosciutto)\\n* Porecca Piccante ($15) - fresh mozzarella, San Marzano tomatoes, hot soppressata, cherry tomatoes, Calabrian peppers, Pecorino Romano, basil\\n* Oro Bianco ($16) - fresh mozzarella, bufala ricotta, Taleggio cheese, pancetta, Pecorino Romano, basil, black truffle oil, black pepper\\n* San Benedetto Artesian Water ($3) - 16.9 fl oz glass bottle\\n\\nThe food was excellent. Varuni uses 00 pizza flour (also known as doppio zero flour or double zero flour, a special classification for a very fine flour milled in Italy), Italian DOP-certified extra virgin olive oil and San Marzano tomatoes (DOP stands for Denominazione di Origine Protetta which translates to Protected Designation of Origin), and mozzarella made from the milk of water buffaloes. You can taste the difference in the quality of the ingredients in both taste and texture.\\n\\nThe calzone is still my favorite thing to get from Varuni and I recommend it to everyone who comes here or the Morningside location. It's hard to go wrong with fried dough and their version is spectacular. This time, I got Italian sausage and prosciutto di Parma in my calzone and both were great additions. I was a little skeptical at first about how prosciutto might taste in a calzone, but it turned out nicely. Varuni's prosciutto is high quality and authentic. The pizzaiolo was generous with the sausage and packed our calzone with lots. The morsels were savory and flavorful.\\n\\nBoth the Porecca Piccante and the Oro Bianco were very good and I recommend them too. The Porecca Piccante and another red pizza, the Bastardo, are the only pizzas listed on the menu with \\"hot\\" ingredients. I love spicy food and didn't find the Porecca Piccante to be spicy at all; maybe a little bit when I bit into the Calabrian chili peppers (they're yummy). This was a satisfying red pizza with copious amounts of mildly spicy soppressata (Italian dry salami, similar to pepperoni) and cherry tomatoes that burst with flavor. \\n\\nI like white pizzas and I really enjoyed the Oro Bianco. The highlight of this pizza for me was the bufala ricotta. I love burrata and the bufala ricotta reminded me of burrata in terms of its freshness and light and soft consistency; very fresh and \\"clean\\" tasting. The Taleggio cheese was the opposite and provided a nice contrast. Overall, this was a tasty and robust pizza that was quite gratifying.\\n\\nVaruni didn't have tap water so that's why we got the San Benedetto Artesian Water. It was fine.\\n\\nService was good. The cashier and other staff were friendly and one of the pizzaiolos greeted us with a smile. Our order came out fast."},{"name":"Texas Chili Parlor","address":"1409 Lavaca St","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"We had the chili sampler and loved everyone.

First we had the aracini ( fried risotto balls) and fried okra as starters.  Sounds healthy doesn't it?  Actually while the okra and \\"balls\\" were great at the top of the dish, they got progressivley saltier as we got towwards the bottom.  I wish restaurants would realize that less is more and if someone really loves salt they can add it themselves.  Anyways the okra was whole, non-greasy, and yummy despite its salt content.  For dinner I got the trout ( I think) that was stuffed with lemon and croutons.  It was super fresh tasting which was great.  Sometimes less is more and this defintley was true in this case.  There was some greens tossed in a vinagrette on the side that was light and refreshing and went perfectly with the fish.  For desert we ordered the phatty cakes which so many people recommend on here.  They were very good and super light, almost like eating a ginger-flavored cloud.

From entering, the open atmosphere and view of the entire kitchen is extremely inviting. During lunch the prices were very affordable so much so my family went a little overboard in ordering but too much food never hurt anybody. My mom and dad being long time residents of Atlanta have visited in past years until recently alongside it being my first time so we tried as much food as possible. As a family we started with 3 of the 4 oyster options, French insulin soup, Caesar salad, and escargot with pastry tops.  My dad and I had the skate with brown butter and my mom the trout for our entrees. The starters were delicious with the oysters being fresh and the escargot buttery with the perfect balance of garlic. The skate entry was some of the best in comparison to other seafood restaurants in the area. The spinach and capers being the perfect passengers to the crispy and tasty skate.

I expected a market more like Reading Terminal Market in Philly that at least seems to be more local, mom & pop type of foods. Quincy was a lot of chains and stuff looked and smelled really good, but it just wasn't what we were looking for. So we left and started walking around the area.. Dick's Last Resort? Really? Bah. So we stumbled upon The Hideout and decided to just stop for a cheap drink. It is a dive and not for kids, but a nice stop for adults. One thing I did like about Quincy is that it has an exhibit space with the Bodies Exhibit on the 2nd floor. I've already seen the exhibit , so we didn't see it here, but it is still a great space. I loved reading about the overall history of the market and surrounding area. Despite not actually eating anything here, it was still neat to see.

One of our appetizers never came out and the quality of the steak tasted like what I would get at a Sizzler. Sorry Sizzler not trying to be a hater, but you know what I'm sayin'. The vegetables were also bland and overcooked. The one positive was the waiter made up for the missed appetizer with 2 free desserts which I felt was very nice. However, my opinion of Ruth's Chris has forever changed.

This wouldn't be that bad despite an open kitchen concept where you could watch all of it. Then there was a pizza sent to a table next to us where really bad sanitary practices were followed...and after our friends meal was delivered as ordered, it was the tiniest grilled cheese sandwich...ever.

Chicken.\\n\\nI have been anxiously awaiting the opening of this place since I initially saw the sign go up as it is ridiculously hard to find good southern fried chicken up here in Yankee territory.  After a rough day at work, I decided to treat myself to some chicken and cocktails.\\n\\nThe Good:\\nAforementioned chicken- perfectly crispy and juicy, with a hint of citrus (comes in a bowl with lemons on top).  As the smallest portion is 4 pieces, it's large enough to share, but still good as leftovers.\\n\\nThe lovely man behind the bar was extremely friendly and attempted to make some good recommendations.\\n\\nThe cocktail list is very interesting- love the descriptions- and I think there's enough of everything else to suit anyone's palate.\\n\\nThings that need work:\\nThe wait time between getting my drink, with my menu open, before someone asked me if I wanted to put in a food order could be improved upon.   Maybe it's because I learned to serve in the corporate arena- there's a way to have a rhythm without being overbearing or absent.   The chicken also came out so quick (yay) but before my side dish, so the kitchen could probably work on their timing, or the chicken can be fired after something that takes a little longer.\\n\\nI wasn't thrilled with the sweet potato pancake things- I guess I was expecting them to be more like hashbrowns and less like actual pancakes.  They sort of fall apart with a fork so you end up scooping pancake bits.  That being said, it's a great way to get kids to eat veggies.\\n\\nThe bad:\\nThe bar manager seemed exceptionally rude to not only me, but a paying customer next to me.  If you're front of the house, you leave the attitude outside, particularly if you're managing other people.  She tended to be short when she spoke to myself and my neighbor, and after I paid, she slammed down my credit card and receipt to sign.   I'm hoping that the GM/owner reads this and lets her know that she needs to work on her \\"customer service.\\"  \\n\\nI'll be back for the chicken, and I'm hoping any new restaurant wrinkles can be worked out."},{"name":"Shut Up and Eat","address":"3848 SE Gladstone St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"I had the meatball sub.

It has that cool 'Austiny' atmostphere, huge biergarten, pen for the dogs and/or kiddies, and over 100 beers on tap. The servers are helpful at recommending drink options, but otherwise not great. Their cheese chili fries (chili on the side) are truly amazing, but we get chili on the side because it has so much grease that you have to pour it off before you eat it. Their other sides are good too. \\n\\nTheir namesake bangers, however, fall short. My wife, my friends and I have never had an entree that was anywhere near our expectations. They have always ended up dry and bland except for the topping which was overly flavorful. I couldn't even call it 'good'.

After that, I went for a pint of the Mirror Pond.\\n\\nFor dinner, the spicy fried chicken and waffle was a bit of a hit and miss.  I think dark meat lends itself to a much better fried chicken, but this fried chicken breast was still moist on the inside with a very crunchy crust.  It was definitely spicy but not overly so.  The waffle itself was thin, not fluffy at all, and a bit dry.

Maybe it was just because I didn't order the right items... but when the 5 different things we ordered ranged from sort of mediocre to buyer-remorse inducing, I can't help but wonder if the kitchen staff was having an off day or the food just wasn't something to write home about. I will say that the staff was top notch and knew the menu inside and out. They were enthusiastic about the product they were selling and you could tell that they carried a sense of pride in their workplace and the product they were selling. Points for that.

For the size of the bowl, I still left a little hungry, and felt they're really a $10-11 bowl, tops.

Hidden gem of a restaurant located in a strip mall. There's plenty of parking. Love the free hot barley tea with unlimited refills. This is self serving though as is cold water. When you are ready to order, you go up to the front desk and place your order and pay first. I haven't quite figure out the tipping system yet. There is a tip jar up front also. I have done both, pay tip up front or I would pay cash tip upon leaving at the table for the bus boy. After ordering you take a seat and the waitress will bring out the food when it's prepared. \\n\\nFood overall is superb. I highly recommend their bimbap where the rice is served in heated stone bowls. I had the beef bimbap while my brother had the spicy pork bimbap. Both were delicious. You mix everything up and add the spicy red chili paste sauce found at the table for extra heat. The spicy chili paste sauce is not as spicy as it looks. It's more of a mild level heat. If anything, it's more sweet than it is spicy. The bimbap also comes with a small side of broth. This is somewhat common with Asian restaurants where a dry noodle entree or rice dish is served with an accompanying bowl of broth. \\n\\nThe kimchi chigae is fairly decent as well as the gamchatang (pork bone stew with potatoes). The kimchi chigae has a slightly sour broth due to the kimchi base soup, while the pork bone stew has a stronger pork flavor with a nutty and starchy broth from the potato and the crushed seed. Also has the beef and radish stew which was much simpler in flavor, not spicy at all. My overall favorite however is the seafood soonduboon which is a spicy soft tofu stew. \\n\\nI recommend the spicy fried chicken. The batter is light and the meat is very tender. It is not at all spicy but mostly sweet. My son lives this dish. \\n\\nThe Kalbi we ordered was a bit dry but the flavor was all there. The stir fried kimchi and tofu dish with spicy pork as well as the spicy squid have similar flavoring of red chili paste and fish or soy sauce flavor. The spicy pork entree also.\\n\\nMost entrees come with a bowl of rice and small portion of house made kimchi so be sure to ask before ordering extra sides of rice and kimchi. \\n\\nOverall, customer service was great all three times we have had dinner there. First time we went around dinner time on a week night, it wasn't packed at all. There was only one other table when we were there but a lot of take out orders. We went again on a Wednesday night at 6:30 pm and the restaurant was packed. It was busy and took good took half an hour to get our food but it is well worth the wait.

It looked like a watery mess of tofu and kimchee.  No presentation whatsoever.  There were only a few shreds of pork and no sour taste that a traditional kimchee jjigae has.  It tasted like overly salty water with not much umami-ness about it.  \\n\\nMy server, a young man of high school age, did an excellent job of checking in on my meal.  I told him that this didn't seem like authentic kimchee jjigae.  He informed management, and a very unfriendly looking middle-aged woman came over to defend that it was in fact authentic.  I told her that I had come once before and that time the kimchee jjigae was fine.  I asked her if this was some fusion version of the soup.  She told me that the old recipe was not as good as the current one and that because they use bones to make the soup, it may or may not have pork meat.  Well, most other Korean restaurants add pork to the soup.  Just really disappointing and completely overpriced for what they serve as kimchee jjigae.  \\n\\nWhile the meal was lackluster, I also ordered a seafood pancake that came with a subpar dipping sauce (even Hmart has a better dipping sauce), I ended up taking leftovers home because I was taught never to waste food.

We had eaten at this place several times over the years when it was still the URBAN TEA MERCHANT and we've thoroughly enjoyed them. We would go in at lunch time and order a west coast menu and something else and we will get a variety of savories and sweet delights on a nice tiered tray.  This time around this biz changed to TWG and as such we were told they no longer do high tea service at lunch time instead they have their own lunch menu. We were disappointed but since we're already there we wud make the best of it. We ordered 2 types of tea, 2 soups, one mushroom and the other squash soup with apple and dungeness crab.  Both soups came out a small tasting portion  - in a TEACUP nonetheless ! The mushroom soup was  acceptable  but my squash was totally tasteless. Even after I asked for salt, I cud not get the seasoning up to par. It's almost as if the chef had forgotten to season this soup completely. Then the lobster avocado salad came. It was small but pretty to look at and in terms of taste - nothing spectacular. We shared another pretty dessert and had a macarons each plus 2 types of tea. The bill came and it was $90 or so ! Only the desserts and macarons are worth coming back for nothing else. It's been ages that I had gone to a restaurant that's so disappointing yet so costly ! Usually you get what you pay for in a place like this ! \\nIn a place like Vancouver where great restaurants are everywhere - paying so much for mediocre tasting food seems so unnecessary ! I should have booked us at Nightingales, Chambar  or several other downtown restaurants and pay the same amount or less but know we will thoroughly enjoy our food. TWG made a mistake for not keeping to the concept of what URBAN TEA MERCHANT had. They should have served high tea at any time rather than turni the place into a ME TOO RESTAURANT serving very mediocre food in a charming environment because  they can't milk on the ambience alone ! \\nI don't usually write a review but i feel compelled to this time."},{"name":"IHOP","address":"2741 Clairmont Rd NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"2.5","text":"Went last Saturday and they were on it!

I've dined at this Lenox location a couple times. It's located catty-corner from MARTA's Lenox train station. This is a popular restaurant. Reservations are strongly recommended, especially on weekend nights, when waits can easily exceed an hour.\\n\\nAt dinnertime, the restaurant is dimly lit. There are candles at every table, so this place works well as a date spot if you're looking for a bit of a romantic ambiance. The interior is constructed mostly of dark woods and brick. It reminds me somewhat of a traditional steakhouse. There's a nice looking bar and an open kitchen in the back. The furnished stone patio outside serves as a waiting area.\\n\\nHouston's has a simple menu with American classics such as salads, sandwiches, burgers, and entrees like pork ribs, trout, pork chop, and prime rib. Expect to spend about $15-20 for a burger, sandwich, or salad and about $25-35 for an entree.\\n\\nItems I've tried here include the cheeseburger, Hawaiian ribeye, and rotisserie chicken. All taste good, though I'm not sure they're completely worth the cost, especially the $16 burger. Houston's burgers come on housemade sesame seed buns. I had mine cooked medium and the patty was thick and filling. The burger comes with a melted slice of cheddar cheese, shredded lettuce, sliced tomato, chopped onion, and pickle slices. All in all, it's a well made, basic cheeseburger that, while satisfying, probably won't blow your socks off.\\n\\nI can see why folks are fans of the Hawaiian ribeye. It's delicious. The pineapple sesame ginger marinade makes the meat quite appetizing and flavorful. It's pleasantly sweet, but not excessively so. I had the ribeye cooked medium rare and it was cooked appropriately with a warm, red center. The steak is very big and gratifying. If you're hungry, this is an excellent choice.\\n\\nA relatively healthy entree alternative is the rotisserie chicken. It's cooked with crushed herbs and and sports a rather tasty apricot glaze which, like the ribeye marinade, is semi-sweet. The rotisserie chicken is primarily dark meat chicken. It's a little oily, but not bad. The chicken comes with a side of cold taboulleh salad consisting of bulgur, tomatoes, and minced parsley and mint. It's tangy and refreshing. Aside from the taboulleh salad, other sides I've tried include the sauteed spinach and mashed potatoes. They're pretty much par for the course.\\n\\nService is satisfactory.\\n\\nValet parking is available right next to the restaurant's front doors.\\n\\nFun fact: When Georgia Tech grad and PGA Tour pro Stewart Cink won the British Open in 2009, the first place he went to when he landed back home in Atlanta from Scotland was this very Houston's restaurant.

It's like they've never had actual authentic Chinese food. The Chinese food here is literally what you can find at Panda Express, no offense to the owners here, they food was fine and I wasn't expecting anything to make me want to come back, but at least the service was nice.\\n\\nI came in, the owner greeted me behind the grill/stove, and told us we could sit anywhere we wanted and if we were of age we could've sat in the bar. We decided to see what the bar was like, and it was too rowdy so we came back to the restaurant side. Both sides are about the same, except the bar side has a full bar which you can order from. The restaurant side, has a few games you can play, look like they've seen better days also, just like the whole place here could use a new makeover. But hey, it makes it look more divey!\\n\\nUpon order we looked over the menu a few times, they even have a happy hour menu from 4pm-6pm with few things at $4 and a few drinks for cheap too. The first page is breakfast, the middle two pages are all american food, and other random things such as pizza also. Lastly on the back page is a few Chinese dishes which didn't stand out that much to me in this type of setting. Nonetheless I ordered a chicken fried rice and also a chicken chow mien because of one of the recent reviews that gave it 4 stars.\\n\\nThe order took a few minutes to complete maybe because there was literally no body that ordered food, and on the bar side were just people drinking and being loud. The food came out, it tasted fine. Nothing was too outstanding, usually to gauge a chef's skill in Chinese food, you start with the basics; fried rice, and this fried rice didn't stand out sadly. The chow mien wasn't that memorable either sadly.\\n\\nNext time if I do come back I'll try something other than the Chinese food, but for now  I don't understand why Decoy happens to be rated so high, there are much better places for Chinese food if you want to travel a little bit, but maybe not in Linnton."},{"name":"Ebisu On Robson","address":"827 Bute Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"3.5","text":"Came here recently for lunch during the Olympics - as I mentioned in my original review, this Ebisu is very drunk-centric so it was interesting to see what it was like in the daytime.

I do dig the $7.50 bottles of Asahi Black - pricey beer but I like the coffee aroma and I haven't seen it elsewhere.\\n\\nWith what I just said, I would have probably upgraded my rating to 3-stars.  However, service was even worse than my last evening visit - they told us there was a strict 2-hour seating policy even though the place was dead (maybe they were expecting a huge rush for the hockey game?).  Most of the waitresses seemed little more than decor pieces - we had to flag them down to break their vacant stares into space.  I think the problem is that we never had a single waitress assigned to us - I think they were all trying to avoid working.\\n\\nMy friend ordered 4 shots poured into a highball glass on the rocks - when it was brought to us, it was *at most* 2 shots.  She politely asked the waitress if she had the right order - the waitress took the drink away to check with the bar and just brought it back and insisted it was right.  She promptly walked off without checking if she wanted to cancel the order.  Oh well, $16 drink done in 3 sips.\\n\\nFinally, the bill was brought to us when we didn't ask for it and the manager even came to 'check' if we need to pay by Visa when he felt we were taking too long to settle.

Of the six choices of bread, one of them was a raisin sweet bread and the other more like a spicy  cracker, I cannot remember the other three. As far as I am concerned the bread was the most impressive appetizer dish I had that evening. When I received my Calendar Island Mussels I was quite disappointed, The \\"Andouille\\" that came inside the appetizer was actually a pork based sausage. Unfortunately Jenna overlooked this by mistake , and did not inform me of the sausage .Jenna did offer to take back the dish to have it remade without the sausage, but I declined. I did not want her to get in trouble, not that she would, but who knows, I just ate around it. Nonetheless it kind of dampened the experience, after eating the toe curling breads with butter. The Mussels were tasty but nothing really special. When I received the entree of  Rainbow Trout it was excellently presented, perfectly cooked and encrusted, it was very tasty, but nothing really special also.\\n\\nAll together outside of the bread, my other two dishes did not justify the price in my opinion. If I am going to pay this kind of price , I expect  the food to be toe curling like the in house made bread, and the entree's must be of a  much larger portion. The restaurant itself is beautiful  being located on a serene river with seasonally changed  outdoor landscaping. There is also a outdoor bar with strategically placed  seating designed  to take advantage of the landscape and river scenery  .\\n\\nJenna was excellent and she also gave me a short tour of the outside area including their herb garden where the restaurant derives a lot of its seasoning from. Ending I would  recommend Canoe as a  perfect experience for a outdoor wedding, romance dinner or a special date.The people who work here are very professional and attentive, everyone greets you and makes you feel like royalty."},{"name":"Umi","address":"3050 Peachtree Rd","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"This is by far the best sushi experience ever. But to pigeon hole it to just sushi is an understatement. The dishes are so imaginative and exquisite that they will push your boundaries. For example I hate onions. One item pictured is yellowtail with shaved onion. INCREDIBLE. Another mind blown experience is the avocado salad. If you're like me, you may think it would be ridiculous to waste stomach space at a fine eatery as this but I was wrong. The flavors of the juice, consistency of the avocado, and the crunch of the onion slices provide a reaction far too enjoyable for me to describe. To top it off, we ordered the lobster tower (not proper name). Phenomenal. This restaurant transcends the mere sushi bar. We will be back often.

We'd gotten many, many recommendations to check out the restaurants and bars on Rainey Street -- and Bangers in particular -- and we were definitely not disappointed. With the a casual and very energetic ambiance, seemingly spontaneous live music, communal seating at picnic tables, more than 100 local and craft beers on tap, and a menu of uniquely crafted sausages -- this is a place that takes beer and sausage seriously, but doesn't take itself too seriously. The spicy fried pickle appetizer ($4.50) is a must have to kick off your meal with a kick and pairs well with a custom flight of four local beers ($8.00). We opted to share three sausages between the two of us: the spicy Dak Bulgogi sausage -- Bulgogi chicken sausage topped with sriracha, kimchi, oyster sauce, cilantro, carrots, and jalape√±os; the South Texas Antelope & Venison Merguez -- a North African speciality with red wine, red peppers, cinnamon and cloves on a pumpernickel bun and curry ketchup; and the always popular bratwurst. All three were phenomenal. My only (and very minor) nit was that it seemed that the service could be a little hit or miss depending on your server. Our server was efficient but not overly attentive because she was training a new employee and managing a couple of tickets - while the people sitting on either side of us at the table got much more prompt and personalized attention from their servers."},{"name":"Absolutely Asia","address":"864 Main St","city":"Waltham","stars":"2.5","text":"4.5 stars.

Spitz is a solid option if you're looking for something fresh, relatively healthy, and tasty too. I ordered a zesty feta doner and split an order of street cart fries and doquitos with my partner. We chose lamb and beef meat for all of the items, which was a great choice. The meat was thinly sliced, as with any good gyro place, soft, and well-seasoned. My doner was filled to the brim with veggies and I loved the freshness of the tzatziki alongside the creamy richness of the zesty feta spread. The spread wasn't as zesty/hot as I thought it'd be, but the pepperoncinis added that nice bit of heat I was looking for. The street cart fries, which came with garlic aioli, feta, and a bunch of veggies, tasted amazing. The fries were surprisingly really crispy, even with all the toppings on top, and they didn't skimp on the feta or garlic aioli. Super delicious; highly recommend. Lastly, the doquitos were really interesting. It's like a taquito but mediterranean style, made with fried lavash bread and filled with your choice of meat, veggies, and topped with garlic aioli and feta. The doquitos were perfectly fried and not overly oily or heavy.\\n\\nPrices are fair for the amount of fresh produce and meat they give, but not necessarily cheap. A doner will run you around $12, and I believe the loaded fries were around $10.

Soul Vegetarian is located next to Sweet Auburn BBQ. Note that the parking lot next to Soul Vegetarian is NOT for Soul Vegetarian patrons - this is also clearly noted on the sign.  Find street parking or park in the public parking garage nearby.  The inside of Soul Vegetarian has a much older look.  The hosts/waiters were busy placing/taking orders and running back and forth in between the kitchen and dining room, so it took a while for us to be seated.\\n\\nOn the Menu: There are appetizers consisting of some of the restaurant's most popular items - cauliflower, tofu, or kalebone - which is a protein resembling steak.  There are also sandwiches that include lentil or gluten burgers, tofu, or the kalebone.  You can order salads as well.  Entrees include barbecue kalebone twists (think of vegetarian pork ribs, barbecue tofu, barbecue cauliflower, crispy tofu cutlets, and country baked (meatless) kalebone steak.  Sides include macaroni and cheese, sweet potatoes, broccoli, collard greens, and brown rice with gravy.  Entrees and sides can be ordered a la carte or in feasts that include salads and cornbread.\\n\\nWhat I Tried:\\nGinger Root Drink (12 oz - $2.90) - This is a sweet drink that has a really, really strong flavor of ginger.  So strong that you feel a warm sensation in your throat afterwards.  The drink is probably really healthy.  I'd suggest the kitchen make the drink a little less strong.  As a warning, the ginger flavor is very prominent.\\n\\nBarbecue Kalebone Twists ($4.50) - Vegetarian meat substitutes never match the texture of real meat, but the flavor profile came pretty close.  I'd say that Soul Vegetarian's strength is its sauces.  I really liked the barbecue sauce.  Entree portion size is decent.\\n\\nBarbecue Cauliflower ($4.50) - Same sauce as the kalebone twists with cauliflower.  The breading was the right thickness.  Also would recommend this.\\n\\nCountry Baked Steak ($4.50) - The country baked steak has a thick, rich gravy with a lot of different seasonings.  The texture almost matches that of a Salisbury steak and is softer than meatloaf.  If I came back and had one entree, I'd order this one again.\\n\\nSweet Potatoes ($3.90) - Very simple, but cooked just right.  The sweet potatoes were sweet, but not too sweet.  They were also soft, but not so soft that they would fall apart when poked with a fork.\\n\\nBrown Rice with Gravy ($3.90) - This was my friend's pick and not mine.  I think it's the same gravy as with the country baked steak.  That being said, it's a decent side.\\n\\nMacaroni and Cheese ($3.90) - Surprisingly, the macaroni and cheese was my least favorite side.  There are a lot of seasonings on it, but it's not as rich as in other barbecue restaurants.\\n\\nVerdict: While the food was very good to excellent, I have to give three stars considering both food and service.  The time to be greeted, to receive drink orders, and to receive food orders were all very long for how busy the restaurant was.  Moreover, when our orders came out they were incorrect.  The one positive is that the manager was very apologetic and fixed everything once we notified him of the situation.  That aside, the food was great once it came out.  Hoping that future guests will get a better service experience and enjoy the delicious vegetarian barbecue that is served here."},{"name":"Gourmands Neighborhood Pub","address":"2316 Webberville Rd","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"The best soup!

The first time my wife and I went there several years ago my wife loves to cook Italian food and does it very well she asked a waitress if there was any way she could get the recipe for one of the sauces. The waitress commented that they didn't give out recipes or coupons because Carrabba's was so much better than everyone else that they were willing to pay the extra and that's why they did not give out the recipes or coupons. The last time we went there my wife received a chicken parmesan that was raw in the center not undercooked roll.

Both times, I ordered the corn on the cob and beef taco, which are delish! Especially the corn! The taco didn't look picturesque but it was still good.

I had a short phone conversation with Terri, telling her the theme of the party and the size we needed to feed 40 people. She wasn't even really that familiar with the character so I was a little hesitant but I about died once I saw the cake. It really was decorated perfectly and she was so sweet. So 5 Stars, Terri. Everyone at the party asked about you and I will continue to tell everyone i know how wonderful and talented you are."},{"name":"Umi","address":"3050 Peachtree Rd","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Just like everyone said, Umi is expensive. In fact, I probably spent more money at Umi than any other restaurant in Atlanta. \\n\\nHannah and I decided to get the Omakase. Umi has 3 tiers of omakase: Umi, Miyabi, and Ito-Kase. The Umi is the cheapest of three--costing only $75. The others go up in price. I have no clue how much the Ito-Kase is since all it says is \\"market\\" on the menu. I would imagine it's at least $130 per person. You can even get wine or sake pairing with your omakase if you're a baller. I'm not, so I didn't. \\n\\nWe opted for the Miyabi course. I wonder if that's a sucker's play. Maybe the \\"Umi\\" selection would've been just as good. Oh well. Miyabi is a 5 course omakase, featuring both raw and cooked foods. Plus, you get a dessert at the end. So it's like a 6 course meal. \\n\\nFor the appetizer, we got to choose any from the menu. Naturally, I went for the otoro tartar. That is the most expensive and the best looking starter on the menu. The wife got the yellowtail jalapeno. The otoro was amazing. It came topped with some caviar and tamari sauce. The otoro was like butter. It was rich and fatty. The yellow tail was good as well. But it's hard to compare buttery, fatty tuna with yellowtail. At least the jalapeno gave it a good kick. I'm not sure if I liked the ponzu sauce though.\\n\\nThe second course was rock shrimp tempura with ponzu sauce. Since the yellowtail had ponzu, I was getting ponzu-ed out. But it was still delicious. It comes with the head intact. You should eat the head, it's delicious. I don't know what they fried it in, but its brains and shell were crunchy and yummy. You can be a savage and finish the whole head, along with the rest of the meat.\\n\\nThe third course was the sashimi sampler. It came with the fresh sashimi. They were all good cuts and delicious. The toro was buttery as usually, and so was the salmon. It comes with pieces of radish, daikon, shiso and other garnishes. These cleanse your palate well. You don't need to rely on gari so much. So it's a good change of pace from eating too much gari (I'm not a fan of gari). It was great sashimi, one of the top tiers in Atlanta. \\n\\nThe fourth course was a hot plate. We got to choose between cod and sea bass. Naturally, we ordered both. These fishes were awesome. They were grilled perfectly. They flaked off easily. The flavors were deep. The natural taste of the fish were there, and the sauces lifted it. Both dishes were a win. If I had to choose, I liked the sea bass better. \\n\\nAfter the fourth course, we were full. But we had 2 more courses to go. The 5th course was assorted nigiri. We were disappointed that we couldn't try their Uni, and what do you know? We had uni as part of our nigiri sampler. Again, they were fresh and delicious. They were one of the better nigiris I've had in Atlanta. \\n\\nFinally, the dessert came. They gave us chocolate mousse. It was rich and creamy. I liked it. It was a good way to end our 5 course meal. \\n\\nWas it worth the hefty price? Yes, it was worth it. But you must like seafood since everything was seafood based. While we were eating, I had no idea how much food we were going to get. They fed us until our stomachs almost exploded. So you don't have to worry about going home hungry. Everything we had tasted great, and it was a good experience overall.

The food is so tasty here! I've tried their pho, rice plates, clay pots, and a variety of their appetizers. The caramelized fish appetizer - oh my goodness, so good. The fish is silky and packed with flavor. It's the perfect dish to go with a simple bowl of white rice. Pho has never disappointed me. Portions are good and the meat is never overcooked when the food arrives. The rice plates! Also one of my favorites here. I've noticed that this place doesn't hold back on portions like some of the other restaurants I've been to. The rice plate portions are huge, I can rarely finish it in one sitting. And there's so many different combinations. Haven't been able to decide what my top is but I love the ones with the pork chops. \\n\\nService here is not as consistent but the workers are really nice. I've had a time when my rice plate was under cooked and they immediately took it back and fixed it. The one issue I've had with the service is that they aren't as quick to come to your table to check on you. Most of the time I would have to find a worker if I need something and I've also had to walk up to the front to ask for the check and pay. Still, I've never encountered a rude worker so this is something I can deal with. To end on a good note, also try their avocado smoothies!

Considering it wasn't fresh, but rewarmed in the oven, it turned out really well. We also ordered the artichoke pizza and the sausage/meat variety (sorry, I can't remember the clever names) and those were really good too.  The marinara was a bit too tart for my taste, but the sausage was really good.  The garlic bread with dipping sauce was also really yummy without being over buttered and oily like most other places. \\n\\nStaff was friendly enough for us, but I was a bit confused by the whole order in the front, pay in the back business.

They are always super sweet to my little girl who seems to think its appropriate for her to yell out tripe and then attempt to get her own. (We have learned to seat her out of the reach of the carts)  2nd the food is really really  good.  spare ribs are in a sauce that's so delectable I want to dip everything else I order in it..they also have a garlic version that my family loves and bbq pork buns especially the baked are little nuggets of heaven.  I didn't even eat turnip cakes before coming here but the abundance of Chinese sausage (and the fact that they heat them to order on this sizzling cart that also has some other yummy shrimp offering )has changed my mind.  I also love the shu mai, har gow, rice noodles (beef esp) and just about everything else that I have sampled at this gem.  The Chinese broccoli is a must and fried items like the shrimp on sugar cane are terrific..if they are hot.  I always see people ordering this lobster special that smells amazing.

Totally unnecessary given the amount of food you get, but I was really intrigued that they offered pickled chicken feet.

They were all very tasty.  I loved how much crab was in the crabcake and it was perfectly dressed. The salmon was so good and the crispy potato cakes with the salmon was a nice texture.   For the entrees, I got the rabbit and the table got the rainbow trout and the bolognese.  The rabbit was perfect - tender, juicy and paired perfectly with the mushroom and ricotta ravioli with the rabbit was phenomenal.  I wish there was a little bit more rabbit on the plate but other than that, I loved it. The other dishes were equally spectacular and everyone was pleased.  We even split the popcorn ice cream sundae.  It would not have been my first pick but I was glad we got it. It was tasty and nice surprising flavor combinations.  \\n\\nOverall, I really enjoyed it.

The wontons were completely inedible. They were overstuffed, dry and chewy. The dipping sauces are awful especially the spring roll one. The jasmine rice I got today was undercooked and bland. And there was also a hair in it. The popolo curry serving had five tiny pieces of chicken and the 5 other things in it were tiny vegetables and it was very soupy.

At first it seems as if they don't offer too many choices on their lunch menu, but each item is so unique & appealing that it actually makes it difficult to choose which dish you want to eat. \\n\\nWe ordered the Korean fried chicken with cheese truffle sauce & kimchi rice; it was absolutely delicious. I loved the twist with the truffle sauce and the pickles on the side - it really seemed like the chefs considered what each dish on the menu would pair well with. Each ingredient is specifically chosen. Same goes for the Squeaky Clean - a vegan rice noodle dish with cashew cream sauce, truffle, mushrooms, arugula & spinach. Super cool dish that tasted amazing as well (however I'd suggest not to get two truffle plates like we did because it can be quite overwhelming).  \\n\\nThe dessert came with the set - a chocolate covered coconut macaroon. It was delicious! \\n\\nThere are a few tiny flaws - the place is so nice that some things stuck out (their silverware was scratched, having the dessert paired with the set looked cheap and out of place).

Good! \\n\\nYes, I had to try the lobster corndog even if the price was a breathsnatching $12.  But what a great concept!  You will be pleasantly surprised at how much lobster meat is tucked inside the pronto pup.   And actually, you get two plump corndogs in your order.  One thing to keep in mind when cooking a corn dog is that they are very thick and need to be cooked for a sufficient enough time to heat the interior.  Today, the lobster was not cold, but it could have stood to have been heated longer.   Just ask for extra-well done!\\n\\nSort of curious - is that while the rest of Original Dinerant is toney in a West Elm/Design Within Reach sort of way (including the dish for my pigs in a blanket), they brought the lobster corn dogs out in one of those cheap plastic red baskets you get at Burgerville.  Yeah, I know that a corn dog is really just carnival food, but still!\\n\\nThe iced tea could stand more tea and less ice.

What is more Texan than chili?  What is better than having that chili served in a dark parlor?  Nothing, and that is how it should be.\\n\\nI'm a big fan of hearty, meaty, thick chili.  If you make a bowl of a rib-stickin, spicy goodness, you have me won over.  Sure enough, TCP offers none of the wussy \\"stews\\" or \\"soups\\" so often deemed as chili.\\n\\nHere, you get a solid bowl of excellent classic cowboy cookin'.  I had the XX (spicy) and their Black bean and Elgin sausage.\\n\\nCould I have some chili with my meat?  The chili here is so chockful of meat it is basically meat+sauce.  I mean, in my to-go container, I was given a fork+knife package.  Thank goodness because a spoon is most definitely not needed here.  You could almost just scoop the meat into your mouth with the knife.\\n\\nThe Black Bean and Elgin sausage has large chunks of the Hill country staple mixed in with a nice, rich black bean puree with lots and lots of beans.  Mild spice and most excellent in flavor.\\n\\nThe Spicy, which is apparently the most popular, is fairly spicy.  It's the perfect balance of heat and flavor; couldn't ask for a more solid bowl of Texas red.  It contains really nice hunks of beef stew meat and some crumbles of Elgin to mix it up.  All the meat is suspended in very little chili.  The chili is a meat-lover's dream here.\\n\\nSo, no frills here.  All chili, all meat, all Texan.  Oh, but they offer some vegetarian options.

We ordered the salad (which was spectacular) and hush puppies to start. The service is tapas style and we ordered the eight piece fried chicken, biscuits and mac and cheese . The chicken was good and the eight piece option is the whole chicken while the four is a true half. Plenty of white and dark meat. The biscuits were phenomenal. The loss of the fifth star is due to the mac and cheese. I asked the server to describe it and he was more than willing to share that it was made with Velveeta, we gave it a shot. I'm a bit of a mac and cheese snob and thought it was pretty bad. I kept going back to it because, well it's mac and cheese and you want to like it but the more it sat and the Velveeta congealed it just tasted worse. That being said if Velveeta is your thing, add a star! Great restaurant and service, good food, definitely a place to try.

A.A. meeting confession aside, I'd like to commend Ebisu as being one of the more entertaining places Downtown to hang out after work.\\n\\nI often notice that most bars/lounges have to compromise between drink-quality and food-quality; former's good while latter's bad or vice versa. Ebisu seems to have both ends covered. I normally have a good time eating their fusion dishes & chugging their sangria but even a better time puking it all back out.\\n\\nGreat food satisfying your palette to the utmost you won't find here but if you're sick of typical wings and burgers, give Ebisu a try.

While they brought it out quickly, it was just cut up avocado with some onions, cilantro, and tomatoes.  While it was fresh it wasn't mashed up as I'm used to guac being served so my friend and I took to mashing it up tableside.  I guess freshly prepared means finishing it on your own?  It also was sadly lacking salt and some acid that I've come to appreciate in guacamole.\\n\\nOnto the entries, the food came to us quickly and piping hot... one friend ordered the seafood soup and the other the fish tacos while I opted for the enchiladas.  I got a trio of their beef, chicken, and shredded pork enchiladas and each was topped with a unique sauce and a side of beans and rice.  What the guac lacked in flavor the enchiladas did not.

Parking is available at Ponce City Market for a fee. Per usual, it is difficult to grab a spot above ground, so head underground. You pay by the hour. I paid $7 for 3.5 hours of parking. \\n\\nUpon entry, I was warmly and quickly greeted by several young ladies. One of them checked me in for the show, and escorted me to my table. I was there solo, and was a bit taken back by the super intimate setting. You're seated at tables of four, so you may or may not know the others seated along with you. The seating is also TIGHT; yet another ATL establishment that compromises comfort for coin. Good grief. \\n\\nI arrived on time, which is early by Atlanta standards. The winery has an extensive menu, more or less for bottles than for wine by the glass. I had dined elsewhere prior to arriving for the show, so I chose a dessert wine. The Coppa Moscato was delightful: it was sweet, crisp and had a wonderful berry aroma. At $10 per glass, it is on the high end, for a Moscato. The wine by the glass averaged between $9-$14 here; bottles averaged around $45. They did fill the glass, though,  unlike other places that try to be faux classy and fill it 1/4 of the way. Our table's server was kind, attentive and knowledgeable.\\n\\nThree stars for the overpriced, limited menu. It's a good thing I did eat beforehand. The average food menu price was $13, and for all intents and purposes, these were tapas style plates. I understand this place is new and looking to establish itself but the prices are a bit crazy. I observed some of the murmuring at the table about how small the servings were. Speaking of tables,  management should consider ending dinner service once the show starts. I had a front row seat and was able to hear utensils and plates being dropped during the show. This is not the noise I paid to hear. Once the show ended, it was a free-for-all with people wanting to pay their tabs. I was escorted to a manager, who had about ten credit cards in his hand. I went back inside and found my original server among the crowd; luckily I had cash this day, and was able to pay the exact amount plus tip. I can imagine that a dishonest person would have easily slipped out of here. Hopefully this is something that they're working to improve for their own sake, but again, ending dinner prior to the show might alleviate this.\\n\\nAmel Larrieux was wonderful, and despite the newbie hiccups, I'd return to City Winery. I'm comfortable going places solo, but those who aren't may want to consider the intimate setting and seating arrangement, as it may be weird for ya.

The decor and theme remain Asian but tastefully so, without relying on traditional, usually tacky motifs. \\n\\nThe food and flavors are also competently prepared and as authentic as you can get for Boston, but also served on carefully chosen plates, folded napkins and little polished touches. \\n\\nThe end result is solid Chinese food but in an environment of modern poise. While I didn't notice elevated plating or reinterpretations of classic dishes, that honestly makes it even better. It help counteract the reputation that Chinese food is messy, loud, and casual with brusque waiters, but also shows you don't need to swing all the way to the other end of eating \\"art\\" to hit a certain standard of service and ambience. \\n\\nIt's not perfect; I wish the music wasn't some generic polite westernish jazz, I would've liked to hear a little more Asian presence. I think the prices are slightly higher than your used to paying for certain dishes, but the portions are healthy and still family sized. At times it felt almost a bit TOO polite/clean ; despite me bring able to eat comfort food here, the vibe kept me from feeling truly at ease, and certainly everyone spoke quietly instead of the hearty, uninhibited chatter of chinatown's no flare eats.

So hearing this I picked up the bottle from our table and unscrewed the lid and it hissed like I just opened a beer! And it smelled spoiled! We should of just got up and left after that but we decided to stay. And I order a Turkey and avocado sandwich witch was great!  Carving board Turkey. I loved it!\\nMy grandmother ordered Bacon- Cheddar Hash  and I comes with to eggs my grandmother the overly polite woman tried telling her that she wants her egg over medium but she dont want it to be crispy on the edge. (Not hard to do, I do it at home all the time!) My grandmother received a phone call, only lasted about 5 minutes, about 2 minutes into the phone the food showed up so that leaves 3 minutes tell she started eating. Guess what the eggs where burnt (attaching photo) my grandmother was not going to say anything. But when green hair came by and asked if everything was ok. my grandmother said her egg where over done. Green hair when into a Tirade about how my grandmother being on the phone the eggs overcooked themselves, they were cooked properly when they came out. you got to expect to have some crispy eggs, but what do I know! That's when I chimed in and said  \\"Obviously not a lot! and you don't talk to customers that way we were being polite with you!\\" And then green hair stormed off, and started yelling at someone in the back \\"she's not happy with her eggs!\\" A few minutes later some guy came to the table, and do you want me to make some more eggs for you.(in a  Snotty attitude ) my grandmother said, no we are in a hurry ( We  Were not until green haired flew off the handle at us ) and he said well when you order over-medum you have to expect some browning! Then I said no what you need to expect is to turn your burner down when you cook eggs! He stormed off!

You have the option of picking your spice level. I think their medium leans a bit on the spicy side, so keep that in mind when you're choosing how spicy you'd like your dish.They always provide a large quantity of rice with takeout and the containers seem bottomless. I get anywhere from 2-3 meals from one takeout order, especially if I also order an appetizer and some naan. Their garlic naan is out of this world, but the regular is also quite tasty. They also do a great job of packaging their takeout. It's wrapped in saran wrap to ensure that nothing spills in transit.

I was really impressed with the juiciness of it. I did not get much of an alligator taste, but it was not bad at all. The fries looked good, but did not have much flavor to them at all, a little bit of ketchup helped them out. The fish looked amazing, but it was pretty bland. Would I go back?

My burger from here has always been tasty and made fresh. The wait to get your food after you order can be a pain but since they're making it fresh, it's usually worth it.

But I do like that they have quite a few topping choices and you can choose as many as you like. I also get the Little Fries and they aren't so little because they don't just fill the container with fries, they also add a scoop to your bag. And every order comes in a brown paper bag, even if you are dining in. Basically, you're always getting a ton of fries. The fries are so tasty and always gave the perfect amount of salt.

Nope, it's too early in our relationship. But that's not going to stop me from dropping a 5ive-r on this brand spankin' new Dinerant in downtown across from Big Pink.\\n\\nThe Original is the newest of newcomers on the Portland food scene. Housed in the brand new Marriott Courtyard on 6th and Oak, the Original is a masterpiece of glass, vinyl, velour, chrome, and home. It's a soda jerk, a bar, a quasi-futuristic-yet-mid-century-modern diner, and a bomb comfort food restaurant all wrapped into one. The style is LA meets Portland meets Flo's. Open, light and hip but with that retro feel. \\n\\nThe menu is what drew me in, though. I saw the menu online and was immediately hooked. Locally sourced, gourmet, hand made comfort food. I opened the PDF file and within minutes was making tracks to get downtown for lunch. Here's a smattering of the offerings:\\n\\nVoodoo donut burger\\nLobster corn dog\\nLobster butter popcorn\\nDuck n' Waffles (duck confit, waffle, braised chard, syrup)\\nBeer butt chicken\\nMac n' Cheese (lobster, orzo, mascarpone, truffle)\\nPB&J Monte Christo (marcona almond butter, huckleberry jam, corn flake crust)\\nHot dog flight (Chicago, NY, and Portland style dogs)\\n\\nAnd the sandwich that blew me away, and cemented my crush: The Fried Bologna: mortadella, onions, shallot mayo, smoked mozzarella, ciabatta.  The mortadella was super high quality, grilled, and topped with amazing carmelized onion and melted smoked mozz, on an impossibly soft ciabatta roll with a sublime shallot mayo (which added a great, deep, complex zing). It was heart-stopping good. Paired with a side salad for $10.5, some might call it expensive, but knowing that all of the ingredients are locally sourced, high quality, and carefully selected is worth a few dollars more. Plus, don't let the name fool you. It's comfort food, but it's gourmet.\\n\\nThe menu is on the mid-range price side, with most substantial options between $8 and $20. It's obvious that you'll not leave full, however. With high end ingredients and no skimping on things like real butter, cream, etc, the food is rich, delicious, and plentiful. Add in the location (downtown) and the setting (swank meets Flo's), and the prices are exactly what I would expect.  If you're the kind of person that's going to compare the olive oil poached Oregon albacore sando with gherkin and cheddar on an English muffin to Subway and complain about the price, don't bother. This place is not for you. In fact, most good restaurants are not for you. If you like good food, however, and can appreciate that quality ingredients cost more, then don't even hesitate.\\n\\nOn to the drinks. The Original offers a full bar with a pretty decent wine list and some good local brews. They make their own sodas in house from scratch, so yeah, they're not cheap, but for $2, you can add some booze to your soda. Love it. \\n\\nHappy hours run from 3-6 and 9-11 (9-11 for beverages only), and offer a $4 daily cocktail (first customer at HH gets to call the drink of the day), a $4 daily punch, $5 wine, and $2 pbr. I hear they're going to be offering some amazing food specials for the 3-6 happy hour, but they're not posted yet. Whatever they be, I hope they include the Scotch Egg (yes, it's on both the regular and late-night menus). This place is definitely going to be packed for the 3-6 HH, what with being across the street from Big Pink and all. \\n\\nThe service? Well, that's a hard one. I ate lunch here on day #2 of operation, and they're still ironing out the kinks. That said, I had some awesome service. They almost had too many people on. Based on the direction they are going, and the \\"err on the side of too many servers\\" methods they are using, I have nothing but confidence. \\n\\nAll in all, The Original is going to breathe some fresh air into the downtown dining scene. With bold style, a great menu, amazing food, and top notch service, they have all of the components to succeed. I know I'll be back often. \\n\\nOh, and they have outdoor seating, on the bus mall, in the shade of the buildings and the trees, and as soon as things are finished, the patio will wrap all the way around onto 6th.

We were a little worried, but by the time we left, there were a lot more people starting to fill in. \\n\\nWe were seated upstairs in a very pretty little dining room. Our waitress was attentive and friendly and helped steer us in the right direction when we had any questions. We had the fish and chips, I had the burger, he had the cassoulet, and then we shared the apple cobbler for two. The fish and chips was really good, but not at all what I expected. It was a small mason jar of smoked trout dip served with some freshly fried potato chips and a pickle. We really enjoyed it! \\n\\nI had the burger and fries. My burger was good, although the bread got really soggy from the fried egg and it was incredibly messy and difficult to eat. I enjoyed sopping up the pimento cheese and egg yolk drippings with my fries though. The fries were fantastic, but man, I think I could've done with about half as many! My boyfriend didn't complain that I actually offered to share for once. \\n\\nHe had the cassoulet, which was a skillet with veggies and sausage and chicken. He liked it, but said that it wasn't as good as he'd hoped and that he'd wished he'd gone with the pasta dish instead. \\n\\nWe were hoping to try the Creme Brulee, but it had been removed from the dessert menu. The apple cobbler sounded good, but so did the coconut carrot cake. I ended up choosing the apple cobbler, which was both a good and bad choice! It was much more than we really needed and was very sweet, so by the time we left, I felt like my pants were going to burst open. Okay, I was wearing a dress, but you know what I mean. The apple cobbler comes in a little skillet, with sugar cookie dough instead of pie crust (what?! that's amazing!), and a little scoop of vanilla ice cream. If I'm being completely honest, I'll tell you that we ate more of the ice cream and the sugar cookie dough than we did the apples. I like apples and all, but faced with the choice, I'll take ice cream and cookie any day. \\n\\nWe really enjoyed Ration & Dram, and given the fact that we live around the corner, I think it's safe to say that we'll be back here again."},{"name":"Mezza Luna","address":"1669 Spring Rd SE","city":"Smyrna","stars":"4.5","text":"This place is a hidden treasure in Smyrna...I spent a good bit of time in Italy and the food here tastes exactly the same..def check it out!"},{"name":"Gus's World Famous Fried Chicken","address":"5486 Peachtree Rd","city":"Chamblee","stars":"3.5","text":"As far as homestyle fried chicken and sides go, this is OFFICIAL enuff for you to try it out for yourself...Greens were served hot and with full of flavor, mac n cheese was good amd so were the baked beans..The chicken was fried to order, crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside ( breast n Wing)...While, I don't eat fried foods often Gus's is a great once in a while guilty pleasure...This location is family and group friendly, very clean and Staff was extremely friendly.."},{"name":"Cold Brew Bar","address":"777 Memorial Dr SE, Suire 103A","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"This place is amazing.

We really enjoyed the bacon wrapped scallops appetizer. And the roasted Brussels were pretty amazing!  I also polished off my husband's fries, lol. That being said, I just have given the best compliments to an appetizer and two side dishes. \\n\\nWe also ordered the spinach artichoke dip. We loved the bread it came with but there were 3 of us and none of us ate the dip itself after 2 bites. My husband said he felt like he was eating grass. Seemed to be lacking any \\"dip\\" or flavor. Fortunately, our waiter voluntarily deducted the charge. \\n\\nI ordered the cedar planked salmon and altered the sides for bacon risotto and the roasted Brussels. Sounds mouth watering right? It was just ok. Not bad, just ok. I could not taste any Cedar in the salmon the way I do when I grill it myself on a plank. I'm not sure there was any flavor added to it? And the bacon risotto also gets the same reaction. \\n\\nMy husband got the fish and chips. Again, underwhelming, not bad, just a safe choice with nothing to rave about. I would have expected a freshly hand battered fish for a restaurant like this but it looked and tasted regular. \\n\\nOur daughter got the duck and same sides as me.

No mention of my equally angry companion.   He evaluated the situation by observing his surveillance cameras to detect my \\"body language\\".   Bingo, he detected my frustration which did become anger eventually, due to his nasty servers.  I never spoke to anyone at the next table, that was my companion who told them to back off.   I am aware that we live in Snowflake Land, where every criticism or complaint is a nuclear bomb dropped on some delicate creatures self-esteem, but I do try my best to avoid this mentality and those who promote it.   I think the owner is being run roughshod over by some very nasty spoiled women who will destroy his business, but that's up to him.  Service has been steadily deteriorating over the past year or so.  Portland is full of great breakfast joints.    Maybe I'll stop by and get my tenner back from the gleefully rude sad excuse for a server.

Had 7 pm reservations, and only had to wait about 10 minutes to get a table. Despite there being open tables with river views, we were put by the open kitchen. Granted, I didn't ask to be seated by the river, but I think a prudent person would presume that it would be the more coveted spot.\\n\\nThe restaurant is gorgeous - there's no denying it! The interior has a lodge feel with lots of exposed beams, but was contrasted with high end finishes. The outdoor space by the river is beautiful - definitely would be worth coming back for an outdoor brunch or drink.\\n\\nOur server was informative, friendly and efficient. I had the Canoe Manhattan and while it did have a bit of a cinnamon schnapps flavor on the back end, it was a great drink. My wife had a Chardonnay (don't recall which) and she loved it. The complimentary bread and chili oil flatbread was great too!\\n\\nAfter some discussion with our waiter I decided on the halibut, and my wife had the pork chop. She requested it fully cooked despite the chef's recommendation that it be served medium. We're just not comfortable with eating undercooked pork. \\n\\nOur food came out fast - almost TOO fast. We had just begun enjoying our bread when our entrees came. It would've been nice to have a bit more time to enjoy the environment. Also, how does a thick pork chop come out to the table fully cooked in 10 minutes? I'm guessing they have some at the ready? I would have presumed at this price point everything would be cooked to order.\\n\\nRegardless, our entrees were quite delicious, and we even opted for a brownie dessert. While we prefer a more dark chocolate, fudgy brownie, the homemade ice cream was wonderful. \\n\\nAfter dinner we strolled behind the venue by the river, taking in their garden, their hen house (where they presumably source their own eggs) and the views. All in all it was a great upscale experience."},{"name":"Wok' n Guys","address":"4655 SW Griffith Dr, Ste 115","city":"Beaverton","stars":"4","text":"Korean spicy garlic fried chicken.

Willys Woodfired Pizza & Pub","address":"Progress Ridge Townsquare, 12345 SW Horizon Blvd, Ste 61","city":"Beaverton","stars":"2.5","text":"So this place is appropriately named - as they do 'suck'. \\n\\nOur first visit, we had a coupon so we figured we give it a shot. Less than impressed when service severely lacks in an empty restaurant with more servers than customers. We left uninspired and disappointed but we weren't counting it out since it could have been an off day. \\n\\nSo I decided to give it another try - same story, restaurant fairly empty. When we walked in we were greeted by a host and immediately seated. As soon as I touched the table we were seated at, the entire table shifted as though it was missing a leg.  The menus that were left behind were warped, liquid stained, and downright shabby looking. \\n\\nOur server arrived at the table to ask about drink orders, I asked at that time if we could get a table that doesn't wobble - she advised she'd bring 'napkins' over (presumably to put under the short leg) and took our drink orders. She returned with our drinks and took our food order (still no napkins). She disappeared for a bit and returned with some ketchup and some plates for our flatbread (still no napkins). There was a clean, empty table within eye shot so I walked over to confirm all 4 legs were stable, which they were. I tracked down our server and asked if we could move to that table - got an 'oh yeah, sure, no problem' - no mention of her napkin solution. \\n\\nWe moved to a more stable table and waited a bit before food items arrived. We ordered a flatbread to share, which arrived first - really basic flatbread, nothing 'artisan' about it - similar to what you'd expect to see as a kids cheese pizza at a restaurant that doesn't specialize in pizza (BJ Willys Woodfired Pizza & Pub...hmmm), anyway we devoured it as we were all starving and hard to resist breading with gooey cheese. \\n\\nOur main meals arrived, a Ridge Burger, Buffalo Chicken Mac & Cheese, and  Macaroni & Cheese. The Ridge Burger contained three slivers of avocado - fairly small for a sandwich that features/highlights avocado. The Buffalo Chicken Mac & Cheese... started out as expected until I bit down on a bone in the chicken. That seemed to do the meal in for me. I ran out of my water beverage and without a server in sight, I had to resort to my own personal water bottle I had tucked into my purse. \\n\\nI server finally surfaced once we were completely done with our meals - she removed plates and took my empty water glass. She returned with filled water and disappeared again. As we were sitting there waiting for our check, the host (manager?) and our server walked to our table with a plate full of tater tots and sets them down on our table. My husband looks at them and says ' we didn't order those' , they removed the plate and walked over to another table. No apologies, nothing. And the best part was OUR server was with him and directed him to OUR table - \\n\\nAll I can say is that will be our final visit. We are pretty patient customers and really not demanding - all we ask is we have a server who is attentive and checks in on us. When the restaurant is as empty as this one is - it would seem to be a relatively easy thing to do. Hopefully they will figure this out soon before they meet the fate of their neighbor, Fuddruckers."},{"name":"Anh Hong","address":"291 Adams St","city":"Dorchester","stars":"4","text":"Since reviewers already raved about the 7 course meal, I'll chime in and talk about their other amazing dishes.

You can order by the slice, pie, or calzone, and are free to stick to their delicious specialties or get creative with your own ingredients. Today, I kept it pretty basic - two slices and a fountain drink for $11.00 even. As you can see in my photo, the slices are large and this is plenty of food for an average person. \\n\\nI usually feel a little more creative, but today I stuck to the script and got a slice of the white pizza (mozzarella, ricotta, basil, garlic, and plenty of parmesan and Italian seasoning) and a slice of the special (thin-pounded sausage, green olives, green peppers, onions, pepperoni, and delicious red sauce.) These slices, the minimal and the maximum in terms of toppings, complemented each other perfectly.  The crust is hand-tossed and slightly sweet, the way I like it, and retains its straight-from-the-oven crispness even under the weight of generous toppings.

This Italian restaurant was highly rated on both Yelp and Google. The restaurant is very clean and neat. Staff members are very friendly. The food comes out rather fast. I had the seabass special which was beyond amazing!! The seabass was prepared with a little crunch and well seasond. Several people at the tables around us had it so I said why not. My husband had the Veal saltimbocca which wasn't good with a side of fettuccine with olive oil sauce. This dish wasn't good at all. It was as if they just threw a suace over the entire thing. The side of pasta was soggy. It didn't even look good on the plate. I would have sent it back but that isn't his style. What bothered me was he was not cleaning his plate. The waiter did ask two times were we ok, was the food ok. On the third ask my husband told him the dish was not to his liking he apologized but didn't offer another meal for him. The was off to me. You know this customer wasn't happy with their meal and you are willing to not try to correct it to ensure they return!!??  We also had the caprese salad which was great. We had cheesecake for dessert and I had the chocolate mousse cake which isn't mousse cake. It is just tasty chocolate cake but yummy. The water is not tap water which I love! I'll return but I doubt my husband is interested. Prices are not that of a small local Italian spot. These are real white table cloth Italian restaurant prices. Dress is very casual so need to dress up but the ambiance is quaint. Owner or manager greets each table during their meal and says hello asks about food which is a nice touch.

I rarely order fries with my meal, so including them automatically isn't a good idea.\\n\\nIt wasn't busy when I got there. There was one other group eating as we walked in and there was a local pop culture TV show blaring. The folks at the counter were helpful, but didn't seem all that engaged in their work. We ordered a cheesesteak meal and a wing meal. If there were anything that wasn't simple it was the vast array of sauces for your wings. I would cut those down to maybe half a dozen and then maybe take everything out of meals. A simple 'Would you like fries with that?' wouldn't kill the counter staff.\\n\\nI thought our food came to the front a bit slow, but it wasn't terribly so. I think the ratio of people cooking to other help might have been a bit off that night. Also, since we were eating there, sending the meals out in Styrofoam to go vessels seemed a bit out of place.\\n\\nWe opened up the treasure boxes and oh my!

Her wings were equally good. They were cooked well with the fat rendered out of the skin so the wings were a delight to eat. (Ever eat those nasty Costco wings from the freezer section? Shudder!) The sauce was secondary to the wings themselves, but it wasn't bad. The fries? I think we ate about 2, but they were good.

I ordered way too much and this place doesn't allow takeout. I really enjoyed the sushi I had, but would only really order the vegetarian or the cucumber roll I topped with avocado. \\n\\nFor dessert, the waiter brought out complementary green tea ice cream and molten cake for my friend since it was his birthday. The green tea ice cream was delicious paired with the molten chocolate cake, and I'm not really that crazy for chocolate cake.\\n\\nDo check out umi, & be prepared to easily spend $40+ on a meal."},{"name":"Brick and Beam","address":"705 Adams St","city":"Quincy","stars":"3.5","text":"Tasty food and pleasant service, but they burned my nachos and I had to wait for new ones, which still had some black on them.

Lots of cheerful folks chatting each other up on a late Sunday night.  A nice well dressed young man took our order and told me all the vodka brands, as I'm a Russian gal &\\nthat's my muse! Though they don't have my go to grey goose, They do have many choices of vodka like ketel one, hammer & sickle, and our fave lava rocks created Reika!  We opted for a couple of hammer & sickle martinis plus a shot of reika for me  with dessert.\\n\\nWe had a cheese plate (wonderfully imagined/check photos), soft pretzels with beer cheese & fig (also satisfying with the drinks) & hubby really loved the standout Cobb salad which included a tasty chicken salad, avocado, deviled egg, lettuce Wedge, cured bacon & tomato. We were WoWed! \\n\\nAll Servers (it's so well staffed) were friendly and quick-my water glass was never empty!

They were filling, though I expected them to be bigger based on previous reviews. The Mac and cheese was also comforting and satisfying, though perhaps a bit too cheesy for me.

I've never been that close to two chickens before, but they seemed pretty cool and not at all henpecked. Austin can still be interesting sometimes.\\n\\nI think Gourmands describes itself as a pub or bistro or whatever, but I saw it as a big bar with surprisingly good food. Our large group took over the entire front section and pushed a bunch of tables together for some happy eating, and the long bar along the south wall was filled with apparent regulars doing some happy drinking. There's a whole back section here that I didn't even see. \\n\\nGourmands has sidestepped the usual bar fare of cardiac-burgers and fried shit for a different path of creative soups, sandwiches, and absolutely nothing I could detect from a can. Yes, it's full of requisite cute names and clever combinations, but I thought of it as Torchy's doing sandwiches, not Subway showing off. The $9 soup and half-sandwich combination is a hands-down winner. I thought my roasted tomato soup and Cleopatra was great. Homemade chips & pickles? Yes, please. Was it gauche of me to eat the entire bread bowl afterward? Sorry, I'll try to keep it more classy next time.\\n\\nI have no idea how the booze is here, you tell me and I'll believe you. If you also told me the kitchen staff had just stepped off some trendy trailer or a Food Network show, I'd believe that too. I'm more fascinated that Gourmands appears to be open everyday from 11am until 2 in the morning, and now we have another hip and cool day and night option available just for us.

The wontons are a fruit-punch of the dance party of the ordinary wontons. They are savoury at the touch of the tongue, and they're light and flavourful at first bite; I love the softness-and-leap-from-bland tingling and taste--it is a satisfying feeling. Fried rice is the staple tummy-stuffer, and it was packed on flavour. With the \\"vegan's favourite\\" fried rice, I had been met with refreshing veggie crisps and savoury mush on chewing the pasty-sweet rice medley. With regards to other fried rice, it is not dissimilar (it was also not too salty). It is a tasty addition to more tasty main dishes.\\n\\n   With fried rice and spicy wontons, I also ordered a Buddhas feast(?) vegetable stir-fry and mah-bo tofu dish. With this much variety, I made a complaint that I worried against too much salt. To my dismay, the later dishes were served lighter than the earlier ones. I hadn't made a request (since there was no extraordinary reason to do so), but the owner quickly obliged to accommodate a filling and not-stifling meal. The vegetable stir-fry was a nice way to cleanse my pallet with light-crispy vegetables and soothing-creamy(ish) dressing. The man-bo tofu, which is often heard as a most-popular dish, was a dandy take-home treat to remind me of the medleys which I infrequently pleasure to my senses (but it was all-the-same a heartfelt reminder to Asian food). With the adventure on my tastebuds and stuffed energy in my stomach, I left the restaurant with happiness spread around my chest. \\n\\n   I think that you won't get disappointed if you order from here. The plastered art is a sight for sore eyes. I think that it's a mood-booster to well-made food which (upon my reflection) are warming dishes. I don't feel bloated; I don't feel weighed-down; but I feel full of food which I know (in my gut) is a small hill to digest."},{"name":"Java Grind and Grill","address":"125 Main St","city":"Stoneham","stars":"4.5","text":"Stumbled upon this place today, if you aren't looking right at it you'll fly right by.

A bunch of our friends love this place, so we decided to finally try it since we were already down south. It didn't live up to the hype, but was pretty good and the value is definitely there.\\n\\nWe called ahead to reserve our table, which was a good idea because they were already getting packed at 5:00 pm. The beer selection is strong and while the frozen margarita was delicious, it tasted NOTHING like \\"black cherry\\". Their famous pimento cheese starter had wonderful crackers but the cheese itself is no better than what you'd get at the store or could easily make at home. Our queso was fine, but the portion was tiny.\\n\\nDinner left a bit to be desired as well. The cobb salad had good quality toppings but the dressing was bland. The chicken fried ribs were more interesting than your typical chicken fried fare, and the sides were abundant. Our daughter was happy with her quesadilla (as always). We decided to skip dessert since nothing seemed super appealing.\\n\\nSo, food: 3.75 stars. We're giving this place an overall 4 stars because the service here was exemplary. The hostess was efficient and polite and our waitress (Willa) was a sweetheart rockstar. Her section quickly filled up, but she handled the rush well. Jack Allen's seems to go that extra mile with the customer service experience and that did not go unnoticed by us.\\n\\nWe probably won't come back to this original location again because we live closer to the one on Anderson.

Also, I'd parked my car at Whole Foods and walked sixteen blocks to the interview, so I wasn't interested in walking any farther than I had to (I was assuming you-know-who would give me a ride...... back to my car afterward, which he did).  Texas Chili Parlor was right there, and the animated scent fingers, that you've seen in cartoons, literally pulled me in.  Strangely, you-know-who was already parking his car right there by the time I texted to tell him no about Fogo.  WTF?!  Why did you bother sending me that Fogo text, Errol... I mean, you-know-who?\\n\\nOkay, so we sat and perused the menu.  I had a hard time (shut up, Errol... I know how much you want to make a sexual joke out of that) deciding what to order.  I was going back and forth between the Frito pie and the chili baked potato.  Oh, but I just had a[n inferior] chili baked potato yesterday.  Oooh, a cheeseburger might be good.  But no, I should try their chili, right?  Okay, SOLD!  I ordered the Frito pie.  You-know-who ordered a grilled chicken sammich, and some sort of triple chili sampler thing.\\n\\nGotta say, the sampler is a good deal.  You get to pick three chilies, but we let the waitress decide for us.  She gave us a white chili, and I was surprised at how much I liked it.  'Twas HOT!  I don't have a fucking clue what the second chili was, but the third one had black beans and Elgin hot sausage in it.  I liked that one best, despite it being the least spicy.  The second chili was setting off fire alarms in my brain, but I didn't think it tasted very good.  Really, though, I worry about things being too spicy.  One spicy taco at Chili's, of all places, last year sent me into a five-minute coughing fit.  My friend, Arran, didn't know what to do.  Five minutes of that nonsense made me fear for my life (and gasp for air).  So, yeah, I'm always a bit cautious about trying spicy stuff.  I actually came out of yesterday's lunch event with no esophageal or tracheal issues, so perhaps I'm cured... like the sausage in that one chili.  Or maybe I just got lucky for once.  \\n\\nI bet you feel gypped since I can't remember what the one chili was, don't you?  I don't blame you.  Read Errol's... I mean, you-know-who's, review for details on that.\\n\\nAs for the Frito pie, it was fifty-thousand times better than the Frito pies I make a home.  Then again, that's not saying much since I use plain ol' Wolf brand chili.  I'm not a big onion fan, but I found myself throwing onions all over that bowl of Frito pie melody.  Not that it needed onions, but it tasted even more fantastic with them.  A symphony of flavor, and my mouth was a happy audience, taste buds applauding and yelling, \\"Bravo!\\"  Sheesh, could that have sounded any more cheesy?  Oooh, speaking of cheese... this Frito pie had some of the best-tasting cheese on it I think I've ever eaten.  Cheddar and Monterrey Jack, I believe.  I don't know what brand(s) they use, but I think I'm gonna break into their kitchen tonight and steal some.  Or maybe I should just draft an email and ask what cheese they use.  Yeah, that might work out better.  The beef in the chili was great, too, but I didn't really feel it belonged in a Frito pie.\\n\\nAs for you-know-who and his grilled chicken sammich, I quote:  \\"This may be the best chicken sandwich I've ever eaten.\\"\\n\\nThere you have it, folks.  Two of your favorite Yelp foodies give this place accolades.  Well, I assume you-know-who will.  I guess we'll have to wait and see.  I know he was at least considering giving this place five stars.  When I stated that I was, he said, \\"I was *just* thinking that!\\"\\n\\nGreat minds think alike, and great tongues taste alike.  Ha!

Heaveeennn\\n\\nLOCATION & INTERIOR:\\nIt's located in one of the shopping centers on Buford Highway and thus shares its parking lot. It's a medium sized lot so parking shouldn't be a problem. However, should the parking lot be full, there's more parking in the back. \\n\\nReally bright and lit up, not too much interior design going on, but it sure smelled delicious walking in! Came on a Saturday night, around 9:30-9:45pm, and were able to be seated right away. I've read that they do get busy on the weekends but that's probably during their dinner rush. \\n\\nFOOD: \\nThis is your ALL YOU CAN EAT (AYCE) joint. I was supppper stocked to hear that. \\nIf you're not familiar with hot pot, there's a huge simmering broth pot that's placed in the center of the table and you cook as you eat by placing ingredients such as meats and vegetables in the pot. There's usually no limit to what you can put in the pot. \\n\\nThere's a huge variety of items to choose from and the menu is sectioned off by the following categories: Pot Type, Sauce, Meat, Vegetable, Main Dish, and Extra Charge Dishes. \\nAgain, lots to choose from but some items we got where the following: \\nPot Type (broth): Spicy Pot and Nutrition Pot\\nSauce: Sesame and BBQ sauce\\nMeats: Sliced Lamb, Sliced Beef, Cuttle Fish Ball, and Shrimp Ball\\nVegetables: Nappa Cabbage, Spinach, Cilantro, Wood Ears, Cauliflower, Fried Tofu, Tung Ho\\nMain Dishes: Wontons, Steamed Soup Buns, Hand-Made Noodles\\n\\nWe didn't try any of the extra priced dishes since it was our first time here and we just wanted to get a feel of what it was like. They have a great selection of different priced items though so I'd be willing try those in the future. \\n\\nNot going to comment on all of those items, but they were all generally really good. \\nAs mentioned, we got two pot types and it's split in the center of one pot. Pretty neat. \\nThe meats came out fresh. Some of the vegetables came out fresh and cleaned, but some came out kind out needing to be cleaned a little more if you know what I'm saying. It's not so hard to rip and pinch out some of the mushy and darker parts of the vegetables we got, but specifically for the cauliflower, it was a little bit of a struggle. The wontons were suuuuppper tiny - guess that's why it's all you can eat. The steamed soup buns were good but I've had better. The hand-made noodles were also good. \\n\\nAll in all, it was good and I was very satisfied with everything. Things came out fast and quick. \\n\\n\\nSERVICE:\\nService was good. They were friendly but weren't really attentive. I guess they were transitioning to the night shift workers so some of the servers were sitting down and eating their meals, which I don't mind at all. It just made getting someone's attention harder. Now, what really bothered me was when they started cleaning... I actually don't mind them clearing tables and putting up chairs. I know what kind of establishment I'm eating at so I wasn't expecting too much but the sweeping though... That's a no go for me. That creates dust... and I'm still eating... Wasn't too happy about that. \\n\\nOVERALL:\\nAside from the sweeping, I was pretty satisfied with my experience here and I thoroughly enjoyed my meal. I'd give this place a 3.5 and round it up.\\nMeal is priced at $18.95 per person, children ages 3-9 is half off, anyone under the age of 3 can enjoy the meal for free with the exception that the child is accompanied by two other people. There is also a 2-hour limit. Also, they've also recently changed their hours and are opened up until 2am on Thursday, Friday, and Saturday. So if you're having late night hot pot cravings, this place would be a good place to try."},{"name":"Wings n Grill","address":"2883 N Decatur Rd, Ste 2883E","city":"Decatur","stars":"4","text":"I'm telling y'all these people wings are better than American deli, Buffalo Wild Wings or those other wing places!

It's located in one of the many food-based complexes along Alexandria Road next door to the better-known Claypot. As with most of these places, parking is an absolute nightmare - they even had a parking attendant who was essentially useless in alleviating the situation. \\n\\nAnyways, the restaurant itself is modern with seating for around 50 people. I had made a reservation but found out the place was empty. The waitress provided us with English ordering forms (thank god, since my ability to read Chinese is dismal). Some time was spent deciphering the menu since there are no detailed descriptions of any of the items. For example, Shanghai style dumplings (XLB) was code named \\"Steam mini pork buns\\". Combining the power of Yelp with my ability to read one out of every 10 Chinese characters, we ended up ordering 5 unique items.\\n\\nItem#1 - Beef Roll: Possibly one of the best I've had. Cooked beef with oyster sauce and green onions rolled in a soft, thin tortilla-like shell. However, my personal favorite is still at Long's Noodle house on Main street. [9/10]\\n\\nItem #2 - Green Onion Pancake: Flaky outside, soft and warm inside. This is a common item in a lot of dim sum places though it usually gets overshadowed by all the other tasty dim sum fare. It's quite doughy and not overly flavorful compared to the other items on the menu. However, in terms of how a green onion pancake supposed to taste, it's pretty good. [8/10]\\n\\nItem #3 - Steam Mini Pork Buns: (aka. Shanghai style dumplings) These were excellent. Thin skin, meaty insides, lots of juice. Six dumplings per order. [9/10]\\n\\nItem #4 - Pan Fried Pork Buns: Traditionally, these are puffy white steamed buns - here, they pan fry the bottom half leaving an interesting mix of textures. Filled with pork and juices, this was possibly the favorite dish of the bunch. [9.5/10]\\n\\nItem #5 - Leeks Cake: This is an Asian calzone filled with chives and clear noodles. The outside is crispy with a softer veggie-filled interior. They're about 8 inches in length and an inch thick. [9/10]\\n\\nThe service here is quick and efficient.

From the exterior, it's not particularly clear that it is a Mexican restaurant. Upon entering, its interior is so obvious that it is a Mexican restaurant. Its excessive use of cartoon fish and booths and tables that are a rainbow of colors can be a standard with Mexican restaurants especially hole-in-the-wall ones. \\n\\nBut that's what makes Alegria's odd. Despite the cartoon fish on its menus, its prices are a little overboard. An appetizer of oysters cost $18. They were certainly not worth this amount. You are better off going to Columbus Fish Market for far better oysters at the same price, and with an interior and dining experience that is reflective of the menu charges.\\n\\nIn that way, the menu is erratic. A fish taco combo costs $10. It comes with a couple very small fish tacos, rice, and beans. The rice and bean portions are both fairly small as well. The taste of none of that plate floored me, and I would feel better off going to Cazuela's on the Ohio State campus for a far better tasting meal at a similar cost with bigger portions. Yet, at the same cost you can get what's labeled as a \\"small\\" seafood broth on their menu. The \\"small\\" is actually a gigantic bowl. The broth is filled with crab legs, mussels, shrimp, and scallops. It's delicious, and at that cost, absolutely insane. I have no idea how huge the bowl is for the \\"large,\\" but it could feed a family of four. \\n\\nI don't have a menu in front of me so I don't know the specific names, but I would return to Alegria's but only to sit and get that broth, which is delicious, cheap especially given the cost of other items on the menu, and is such a healthy portion that you can take some home. But, it's this type of strategy on my part that could ultimately bury Alegria's.\\n\\nI fear that Alegria's will be yet another victim at this location. The price points on its menu do not match up with its interior d√©cor or the feel of the restaurant. The price points don't even match up within the menu itself as a massive amount of seafood broth is the same cost to you as miniscule fish tacos. The staff was kind and otherwise trying to make it a good place to come to. \\n\\nI liked Alegria's in a certain way, but the unevenness of its menu and decor ultimately hurts it. It doesn't lead someone to want come back to the restaurant, and if it would, it would be to take advantage of the menu items that would lead to the least amount of profit for the restaurant. If people want Mexican, they want it cheap and tasty. If it's going to be expensive, it better taste really good and be a beautiful dining experience. Unfortunately, Alegria's doesn't deliver in that way."},{"name":"Umi","address":"3050 Peachtree Rd","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Good food, they were out of almost every dessert even though we asked for it before we even got a table.

When I find a good place I tend to go back and try the whole menu.\\nCouple weeks ago my girlfriend brought her friend here for lunch. She knows the menu but her friend had a few questions. For some reason the cook I guess got frustrated and was abit rude. They overlooked it and sat down waiting for the food. \\nWhen the food arrived, it being her FIRST time asked if the extra items she ordered were already inside the ramen. Again the guy snapped at her saying no he was bringing them out. \\nBeing that we had been there a few times before my girlfriend left she asked the cook why he was being so rude today unlike previous times. He apologized and said he was stressed because they had so many to go orders and it was hectic. After that whole situation she said she was never going back. I on the other hand told her to chalk it up to a bad day we all have them. \\nFast forward to Friday. So this past Friday comes around and I suggest why don't we try it out again. She orders the salmon rice bowl I get the trusty spicy ramen. My ramen as usual was great but her salmon was RAW on the inside. Now you can imagine the look she gave me after convincing her to give it another chance. AGAIN!! I said \\"babe it's no biggie just call them and explain\\" \\"she refused\\" lol\\nSo I call and explain the salmon we received was raw. The lady I spoke to explained \\"we cook it for 4min on both sides\\"ÔøΩ?not sure if that information was meant to comfort me but she was polite and said she would remake the order. \\"We returned the first bowl\\" .\\n15 min later we go and pick up the new bowl.

The first incident happened about a month ago but I decided not to write about it since it has never occurred to me before - but it unfortunately occurred a second time : (\\n\\nFirst Incident:\\nA couple friends and I were stopping to get some late night pizza around midnight on a Saturday. There were a couple people sitting in the store already with their pizza but no one in line so we walked right up to the counter. My boyfriend, also being a regular, ordered rather quickly and stepped off to the side. My friend wanted to treat us all to pizza but we were all protesting and saying \\"No no - you don't have to, we can get it this time\\". This back and forth went on for about a minute. But then I heard the chef, who was leaning on the other side of the counter, say very audibly \\"hurry the f*ck up\\". We were caught a little off guard - like deer in the headlights off guard. In the end, we didn't order anything because the chef just didn't seem like he was in the mood to make more pizza. But we tried to give him the benefit of the doubt and say that he was just having a bad day. Needless to say, I decided to steer clear for a bit.\\n\\nSecond Incident:\\nAfter a month I decided to come back, I ordered a pizza, nothing out of the ordinary happened. I reassured myself that it really was a one time incident. So then I came back with a friend, who has a dairy allergy. Because of her allergy, she wanted to make some special requests on wanted on the pizza. She wanted \\"just pizza dough with tomato sauce\\". And when she got her pizza, it had cheese on it. We asked if we could have another one, and the cashier did give attitude and claimed that we did not specify. She did end up giving us another pizza but not without saying \\"be louder next time\\".\\n\\nSIGH. It's a real shame!

The guy working there was also very friendly on all of my visits."},{"name":"Casa Mia Cucina Italiana","address":"261 Washington St","city":"Marblehead","stars":"4.5","text":"Spectacular ordered lobster ravioli with shrimp scallops and also aronchini quick delivery  first time eating here and won't be the last!!!!!!!food is amazing!!"},{"name":"Cafe Java- Austin","address":"11900 Metric Blvd, Ste K","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"How have I neglected to write a review after eating here for about 4 years now?

Why? Because, it's the closest thing to sex. (Well, at least oral.) Forget oysters. Forget chocolate. Your new aphrodisiac should be this, and it could possibly make your nipples pierce through your winter coat.\\n\\nYes, even one that's filled with down. \\n\\nIt's perfectly sweet and savory. The meat is lusciously buttery and beautiful. You'll want to lick the entire plate, lay on your bed naked, and then smoke a cigarette afterwards. (Probably Marlboro Lights 100s.) A neat whisky is optional. Oh, and BTW, remember to wipe the juices off your face.\\n\\nBut seriously, my lady and I went with her brother and sister-in-law to Umi to celebrate our recent engagement (yeah, I put a ring on it), and it couldn't have been better. More about this restaurant:\\n *****\\nI. FOOD & DRINK\\nBasically, Umi serves as a refined izakaya amalgamated with a high-end club. Sort of like Japanese joints in New York. (Ooomp-si, ooomp-si, ooomp-si.) They have of plenty of tasty starters, a robust menu of both traditional and house specialty rolls, nigiris, sashimis, etc... Pretty much all things tasty, OK? What we devoured: \\n\\n*Edamame: AKA Chamame soybeans boiled and salted. They provided several generous portions for the wait, and I felt that it took me forever to finish these. (A good thing.) They were delicious, and fun for a group. \\n\\n*Shishitou: Grilled shishitou pepper with salt. Pretty good. \\n\\n**Rock Shrimp Tempura: Like the name says with ponzu sauce. I could eat this all day. Worth getting.\\n\\n**Black Cod Misoyaki: (See description in intro.)\\n\\n**Seared Diver Scallops: Smothered in soy ginger sauce with toban grill. Excellent. \\n\\n***Spicy Tuna Roll: Spicy tuna with green onion and cucumber. Delicious.\\n\\n***Eel Avocado and Shrimp Tempura Roll: At this point, I'm pretty freaking bombed on sake. But, it was pretty tasty if I remember correctly.\\n\\n***Kobe Beef Roll: Lightly cooked kobe beef with daikon sprouts, green onion, garlic, and ponzu sauce. Hmm. I wouldn't get it again, but it wasn't bad. I would've tried another roll, personally. \\n\\n****Otoro Nigiri: Yes! Fatty tuna, FTW.\\n\\n****Salmon Nigiri: Fatty, sexy, fish-a-licious. Yes. I'd eat it without using hands.\\n\\n****Uni Sashimi: Better than most places in the ATL. Fresh.\\n\\n*****Sake: Man, I don't know. I drank plenty of this cold deliciousness - with barely any aftertaste -- and it made for a great night.\\n\\nII. SERVICE\\nDespite having a reservation, we still waited 15-20 minutes for our table. (Not a big deal. We just chilled in that mini lobby area to the right of the entrance.) So, know that if you're going to make a reservation, because Umi is so popular, you'll probably have to wait a bit. Umi's staff acknowledges this frequent problem, and they'll gladly accommodate you.  \\n\\nRegarding their actual table service, they're very professional and honest when it comes to recommendations. They're also attentive, without being all up in your face. No qualms here. I just wouldn't make reservations here if you have to be somewhere later on in the day or night at a certain time.\\n\\nIII. ATMOSPHERE/ D√âCOR\\nLike I mentioned above, it's like a high-end izakaya/ club. The music is bumpin', it's dark, and you'll likely see a couple tryin' to snuggle up one another, a group of blondes taking group duck-faced selfies, or that one dude at the bar chillin' and eatin'. (That's usually me.) Nonetheless, everyone dresses fly, and you should bust out the hot black dress or those special occasion slacks that you wear every blue moon 'cause they're sort of tight. \\n\\nIV. PRICES\\nI would at least drop something north of $75 per person. I mean it's a high-end Buckhead restaurant with outstanding food and service. (So, it's pricey.) But you're paying for something more than just the food. You're paying for an experience, and this place is not for you if you're searching for great value. \\n\\nV. OVERALL\\nI had an amazing time at Umi, and our celebratory engagement dinner couldn't have gone better. Was it the sake? Does booming bass make me super happy? Or, do I just love really great food? Well, it was all of the above, and I can't wait to return."},{"name":"Papa John's Pizza","address":"10219 Se Sunnyside Rd.","city":"Clackamas","stars":"2.5","text":"The girls were very friendly and helpful.

The slices of pork belly are tender and soft, and the mushrooms taste sweet like fruit in the midst of a generous helping of noodle and just enough green. I'll be thinking about this ramen a lot until I have it again.\\n\\nMichael, one of the owners, was tending bar and was happy to share a taste of his favorite Japanese whiskey and mix me up a sake-lychee cocktail to slake the saltiness of the ramen. The cocktail was not too sweet and not particularly inebriating, which really felt like the right call.\\n\\nThe decor is charred wood, which creates an atmosphere that is at once casual and sophisticated. That suits a place with high-end whiskeys and ramen (I'm told that in Asia, ramen is more like a street snack rather than the centerpiece of a meal) quite well.\\n\\nI can't wait to go back and try the poke and other varieties of the ramen, though I also may never need to explore any other ramen anywhere after having the G-special.

You call- 9/10 the teenager who answers the phone puts you on hold- leaving you to hear them yell back and forth at each other over the phone. Then you have to repeat yourself 3-4 times to get your order heard. You go to pick it up (because I abandoned delivery a year ago- always cold even though I live less than 3 miles away), SOMETHING IS ALWAYS WRONG. They forgot a topping. They made you 2 pizzas instead of 3. One is the wrong size, your last pizza is still in the oven while the other two are cold on the rack, the pizza is completely undercooked, they gave one of your items to someone else, etc. \\n\\nThe place is absolutely pricey for what it is. To top it off the owner is as unfriendly as possible- to both his disorganized employees and openly to customers. I've been on the receiving attitude of his anger, heard him talk about customers while I'm standing there, and heard him argue with people on the phone while waiting to pick up. He doesn't seem to want the business.

After over an hour of being there, we finally received our food. The Druken Noodle was mediocre and an embarrassment. It took over an hour for a greasy plate of disappointment. The tom kha noodle soup was good but not worth the wait and disrespect we endured. Given the slow slow service, we intentionally requested our check early. We had to ask for our check THREE times before she brought it. This is my first and last time going to Basil Thai. I won't support an establishment that is so rude, tacky, and disrespectful.

Peanuts, cilantro, five spice, pickled egg, etc. \\n-twice fried Korean chicken wings. I'm not even a fan of chicken wings but these are gooood. So crispy, not sickly sweet like many other chicken wings are, and the peanuts give it the extra touch. \\n-miso ramen soup. The pork in it had a nice flavor to it and the noodles had a great firm chewiness to it. The broth was flavorful. \\n-beef haw fun (but with extra sauce)\\n-five spice calamari. \\n-my mimosa was perfect.

Three of us dined at Capa on Friday 10/24/14 and needless to say we were unimpressed.\\n\\nThe Good: \\nThe restaurant is beautiful, as well as the hotel. The location is \\"exclusive\\", which makes it feel special. It's on the 17th (top) floor of the Four Seasons Resort and you can watch the Disney fireworks from the rooftop deck. We were promptly seated and the server was attentive and knew his stuff. \\n\\nThe Bad:\\n We went in for a special occasion and I told the restaurant at the time of making the reservation that we were coming in for a birthday. The special occasion was never addressed by any of the staff, which you would expect at a restaurant of this caliber. Upon checking in with the hostess a simple \\"Happy Birthday Mr. _______.\\" would have been just fine. Not a big deal if everything else was spot-on. \\n\\n There is a difference between expensive and overpriced, this place is overpriced. For \\"appetizers\\" we ordered the \\"croquetas\\" ($8)  and the \\"pulpo\\" (octopus$14). For a Spanish inspired steak house the croquetas sucked. I've had better ones from a food truck. They reminded me of a frozen hors d'oeuvre from a grocery store. Three came in the order and they were smaller than my pinky. The consistency of the filling was essentially liquid, really no substance to it. The octopus was good, not great, again a very small portion. It's about the same size and shape as a ballpark hotdog cut into several pieces. If we had known both of the appetizers were going to be tiny we would have ordered more. \\n\\nEntr√©es:\\nOne ordered the \\"Pescado\\"  ($36) . Which was Yellowtail Snapper from the keys. It sat atop a bed of chickpeas and some other ingredients in a bowl. The fish was VERY fishy. I am an avid fisherman and have been fishing for 25+ years, so I know my fish. It honestly should have been sent back. \\n\\nA friend and I ordered the porterhouse for two ($100). With a side of mashed potatoes. We were going to also order the mushrooms, but decided not to because we figured we had mashed potatoes coming and a 32oz steak and we didn't want to explode. I literally could have eaten the mashed potatoes in two bites, again a tiny portion. The porterhouse for two comes pre-sliced and it was very good BUT the bone weighed at least 16oz so now you're splitting 16oz of meat between two people, so $50 for 8oz of porterhouse. If I had known that I would have gotten the 8oz filet ($48) which is my favorite cut of meat. \\nGot the churros for dessert they were probably the best part of the meal. Fried dough with sugar... You can't really mess that up. \\n\\nTwo entrees, Two tiny appetizers, one tiny side, one dessert. NO alcohol.  $200 + tip. And walk out still hungry?! \\n\\nIt's one thing to to spend a lot on dinner and walk out full and happy, but to leave dinner hungry and dissatisfied.

Last time there was so much ketchup and mustard on burgers that I thought I was drinking it straight from the bottles and not only did I not get extra salt in the bag, they didn't even salt my fries. I make a complaint to ubereats and nothing was done. So I order today and I didn't get any extra ketchup or onions and my mcchicken had so much mayo on it, it looked like some came in it and there wasn't a bit of lettuce on it and again the fries came unsalted and there was no salt in the bag. On top of that I ordered a tropic berry sprite because they said their normal sprite was out and when I received it, it was straight carbonation and no flavor. Now you're probably wondering why I didn't just fix this, but I ordered it from ubereats because I live quite a ways from any McDonald's and have no car.

Then you pick your gusto, which is sauce and salad. You can also elect to have your salad item on the side. Once our orders were taken we walked to the side and you can see the staff making your entree. Kinda like Chipotle, but until there you have already decided your toppings so there isn't a wait of \\"Do I want this, do I want that\\" etc.\\n\\nI got the wrap with avocado and tahini cucumber feta gusto.

Not worth a second visit."},{"name":"Dosa n Curry","address":"447 Somerville Ave","city":"Somerville","stars":"3.5","text":"Great place the food is amazing\\nSpicy and the rice is so soft and perfect\\nI came on a Saturday and the place was well lit and"},{"name":"Cold Brew Bar","address":"777 Memorial Dr SE, Suire 103A","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Wow!

Anyway, the avocado toast was AMAZING! Very filling so if you're hungry it's going to fill you up big time! The nitro cold brew was SOOOO good. I wouldn't order it with caramel again because it didn't taste like caramel at all because all the caramel got stuck to the bottom of the cup. The cookies were so great! Absolutely soft and tasted so good... okay for the chocolate and banana pastries it's a hard hard pass. SO dry! If it wasn't for those pastries this would be a five star review.

But the food on the ship was surprisingly good, and thus the reason for the 5 stars here. \\n\\nIt was not crowded at all, plenty of space to roam on the three decks plus the aft and fore open areas. There are tons of games to keep everyone occupied: shuffle board, ping pong, foosball, large connect four and a plethora of table board games inside. There was also a DJ with a decent sized dance floor playing a mix of pop songs--that was pretty funny to watch. \\n\\nOverall a pretty decent deal given the quality food buffet the almost 2hr time (including dock time) and a well maintained boat plus very friendly crew. \\n\\nWe would definitely be happy to do this again on our next trip to Boston!"},{"name":"Canoe","address":"4199 Paces Ferry Rd SE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4.5","text":"We have been coming here for years because we have always enjoyed the atmosphere and the food so much.

Many foods are prepared in a tajine. This is a clay pot in which the food and spices blend well with a hole on top for steaming to make it much more delicious. I love coming through Merguez because of authenticity. Let's begin the review.....\\n\\nLocation- Merguez Restaurant is located in Orlando on international drive. \\n\\nPlace- the restaurant is not fancy at all and simple. Looks more of a cafe. You can choose to sit indoors or out. The restaurant is located in a plaza that has huge stairwells outside and in front has romanic statues. The outside is beautiful. However as I stated inside is VERY simple.\\n\\nFood- I was able to go here plenty times as I cook some myself being my husband is Moroccan. \\n\\nTagine chicken- meat falls off the bone so delicious and tender. The paired rice really complements it. The taste is so delicious but hard to describe you have to try it out yourself. \\n\\nTajine kefta- meatball prepared in the tajine pot with tomatoe sauce spices and cheese and egg. Yum! Boiling fresh and hot paired with bread everything melts in your mouth. \\n\\nBstila chicken- chicken pastry with almond and cinnamon with powdered sugar on top. Trust me it's delicious! Thought he combination may seem strange. Very Crispy!\\n\\nBstila fish- shrimp with fish fillet wrapped in crunchy \\nwrapper with tomato and seasoning and cheese. Yum!\\n\\nMoroccan mint tea- the famous hot Moroccan tea with mint and sugar. Delicious and satisfying. Moroccan mint definitely complements everything and in tradition is a must after most meals. \\nThey also have sandwiches and almond sweets. All are yum! \\n\\nCouscous- Morocco's signature dish. With steamed vegetables tendered chicken and fluffy melt in your mouth couscous. The experience is a must!\\n\\nService- sometimes it can take a bit of waiting since they are packed and the food is prepared fresh. The servers are very polite and helpful. I never had a bad experience after many times of coming.\\n\\nPrice- everything is affordable nothing really over 13.00 for an item. \\n\\nI love Merguez!

As far as the food--it was excellent! Their french toast might just be the best I've had! The portions were very large so both times I ate there I had to take food to go. I ordered a side of avocado and it was probably the biggest side of avocado I've ever seen at a restaurant!\\n\\nThat being said, I'm giving them only four stars because while at non-peak times it is more relaxed, I visited when it was super busy once and didn't have the best experience we could have had. We were moved around from table to table and almost had too much interaction with the servers/host. When we were trying to get drinks we felt like we were cramped and in the way since servers were moving in and out of the kitchen, and it was just slightly stressful. \\n\\nI would recommend this place for a small group to grab breakfast or brunch.

We always look up and go out to the best restaurants in new cities, and this place was apparently the cream of the crop, so we had to check it out. We get here and the whole place is super custom and themed wonderfully. All the way down to the table legs being oars. So good.\\n\\nThings got even better as we walked down to our tables and we discovered that we got window seats where we had a beautiful view of the Chattahoochee River. The server gets us our drinks, gives us some bread, and tells us all about the daily specials they are offering. The bread was really nice, by the way. Super soft with hearty crust, and the butter was not too cold. It was perfectly spreadable. \\n\\nSo, we got two appetizers, (1) Charcuterie & Cheese Selection, Spotted Trotter Salumi, Canoe Pate, Seasonal Pickle & (2) Peppercorn Crusted Kangaroo, Arame Salad, Peanut-Miso Satay. \\n\\nThe charcuterie & cheese plate was solid. It was super solid. It was nothing to write home about, so unless you just really looove charcuterie, I would try one of their other super unique offerings. In fact, the only reason we got this was because their special appetizer (goat tacos) were sold out for the night. \\n\\nThe kangaroo, on the other hand, was absolutely great. It was served rare and it was super crusted with peppercorns, adding some heat to the mildly gamey taste. The Asian-inspired sides offered a coolness and a delicious peanut taste that set this off as a five star dish. \\n\\nFor our entrees, we chose (1) Slow Braised Rabbit, Kabocha Squash-Maple Ravioli, Pecan Brown Butter, Candied Garlic Jus & (2) a red snapper dish with English peas, a wild rice, and some green sauce on the side. I'm sorry for that horrible description. The dish is different on the online menu. \\n\\nThe snapper was good. The skin was crispy, and it went well with the rice underneath. The cook was perfect. It was moist and flakey and just a really good snapper dish. \\n\\nThe real winner of the night, however, was my girlfriend's rabbit dish. The rabbit tasted just like chicken, not kidding, but like, the best tasting chicken you'll ever have in your life. Such a deep flavor. Wow. The ravioli added the perfect sweetness to balance out the umami of the meat. There was some spinach in there, too, that was just cooked so well with the jus. I just can't. Six star dish. Get this, please. \\n\\nWe decided to split one dessert, the Chocolate Grotto, Salted Caramel, Pretzel Dust. Wow. This was good, too. This was a chocolate shell surrounding some salted caramel ice cream, super creamy. The pretzel dust added the texture needed to make this dessert perfect. This was the perfect way to top off the perfect meal. \\n\\nOverall, this restaurant is on a lot of lists out there on the internet, and honestly, I think it should be.

Even the dishes that don't fit my palate are, I can tell, well done. Whether you prefer curry, noodles, rice, or stir-fry dishes, Bai Yok will satisfy. And the fact that you often have to wait upwards of 30-40 minutes for take out (never trust the 15 minutes the quote you) only supports the notion that this food is well loved. \\n\\nThe atmosphere in the restaurant is still fairly lacking, and since the food can take a while (one cook gets backed up by lots of take-out orders), I always feel that I'm better off getting take out and going home to sample my way through the wares. \\n\\nI consider Bai Yok to be one of the most consistent and delicious Thai spots in Portland.

I was expecting a lot and wasn't going to settle for less. My standards when it comes to Korean food is pretty up there because I'm Korean and I grew up eating good Korean food. My mother had a restaurant, there are a ton of great Korean restaurants in Hawaii and Los Angeles, and in that sense I am spoiled. \\n\\nDu Kuh Bee is a little hidden place right next to Nakwon. The place is small, and by small, I mean only about 6 tables and a small bar, small. The menu is simple but ordering is not so simple. The guy who took my order barely spoke English and definitely did not speak Korean. It is a Chinese owned Korean restaurant which is the opposite of what I'm used to. Most times you'll see Korean owned Northern Chinese cuisine restaurants. Anywho, I was excited to try this place because they had jja jjang myun (black bean noodles) which is made with hand pulled noodles. I've yet to find even a decent jja jjang myun joint here in Oregon so I was excited for sure. So it was an order of jja jjang myun and dwaeji bulgogi (spicy pork) for me.\\n\\nThe food came out pretty fast. The portions were a bit on the small side and I worried that it wouldn't fill me up (I eat a lot). The noodles looked very fresh and very good but the sauce lacked any substance. It looked like just black sauce as opposed to a black sauce containing a bunch of veggies and meat how I'm used to eating it. The noodles were actually a bit cold and a little too hard and chewy. I'm assuming they were sitting for a bit and the chef just cooked up some sauce and poured it over cold noodles which is not how it's supposed to be. With the jja jjang myun I was very disappointed. The dwaeji bulgogi was actually pretty good but like I said, the portion was very small for the price. They use samgyupsal (pork belly) cuts which is the best way to make this dish with a bunch of onions. \\n\\nOverall, my experience at Du Kuh Bee wasn't as good as I thought it would be. I was sorely disappointed at the quality of the noodles. I'm sure if it was made fresh, it would've tasted better. The pork was good but the portions sucked. I spend $19 and end up leaving still hungry?! Not good."},{"name":"Cafe Java- Austin","address":"11900 Metric Blvd, Ste K","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"Wow food and service was AMAZING! visiting from Dallas and so glad we found this place !  definitely come and try it !"},{"name":"Prost Haus","address":"904 Granville St","city":"Vancouver","stars":"3.5","text":"Cool spot. Neat interior, definitely has a unique atmosphere/decor. It would get quite warm on a hot day, glass ceiling creates a greenhouse atmosphere. \\n\\nThe food itself was good, I had a bratwurst that came with fries and pickled vegetables. Fries were excellent, sausage just okay. I must admit I was expecting more sausage options (like WVRST in Toronto, which has around 20) but I think instead they are trying to appeal to more people - menu had 5 sausage options and then a lot of other options (main dishes, sandwiches etc). \\n\\nService was good although the restaurant was extremely quiet (5PM on a Tuesday) so I expect it to be quick. We asked for ketchup which didn't come until we went up to bar to ask again but we got it eventually. \\n\\nBeers are pricey but there's a good variety of european imports (draft and cans).

Sign me up! I love a good table-side performance, despite Husbae saying, \\"I bet it's some dude that's going to come out and literally shake a jar of salsa.\\" I said, \\"Nah! I bet he'll put some fresh vegetables in a shaker with some lime juice and voila!\\" \\n\\nLO and behold! This sad guy with one job comes out, stands still at the edge of our table, and whips out a jar of pre-packed salsa and proceeds to shake it. This is the middle of our adventure. Allow me to call upon the power of Quentin Tarantino to aid me in the writing of this adventure at Jack Allen's kitchen, which ultimately ends up in me almost getting stabbed. \\n\\nThe Parking: 9/10.\\nWhy is there even valet at this restaurant? We went at 5:45 on a Friday and found a nice spot, only to walk to the restaurant to see a valet? What kind of too-fancy people eat here? This place felt like an Outback Steakhouse on diamond-flecked steroids. \\n\\nThe Atmosphere: 4/10.\\nThis felt like an Outback Steakhouse on diamond-flecked steroids. I felt a little out of place, because everyone was dressed in blazers, golf attire, and other higher-end outerwear that I won't understand until I break $100K. The entrance of the restaurant was packed with socializing people. I could barely get up to the host. Can I mention how loud it was in there? I had to shout, not only in the social area, but also in the outside area, where we were seated!\\n\\nThe Wait: 7/10.\\nThe wait was fine. I was able to get some water to sip on while we waited outside. There were only three places to sit, but there were about 20 people waiting outside.\\n\\nThe Food: 2/10.\\nLet's put it this way, Gordon Ramsay would have an angry field day if he came to this restaurant. It was as if they had watched Kitchen Nightmares to help themselves avoid potential problems, but took the advice in a weird direction. They had too many workers all dashing around the tables, and they even had guys for just shaking salsa jars. The salsa, by the way, tasted like sweet, watery, smoky ketchup with pace picante mixed in. It was not what we expected at all. There was a strange tang at the beginning of the salsa, that wasn't quite citrus. It reminded me of those \\"Lemon Zinger\\" teas that have a bit of a tang at the beginning. It was not a good experience. \\n\\nThe chips, themselves, were awesome! They were cut to a nice size for dipping, because I usually break my triangle chips in half so I can dip them twice, for maximum coverage!\\n\\nWedgie Salad: 3/10.\\nThis looked like it could have easily had sparklers shooting out of the top of these onion slice, blue cheese chunk toothpick kebobs. The salad it self was difficult to navigate, the dressing was nearly flavorless (guys, Iceberg lettuce needs a lot of love!), and the toppings were sparse. I like the wedge salad at Red's Porch much better. \\n\\nHusbae doesn't remember what burger he got. He said that it was just a burger - 6/10.\\n\\nThe Service and almost Stabbing: 1/10.\\nThis guy was either spread too thin or he was very confused about where he was or how to function. Either way, he took longer than the time it took to eat to bring us the check. When we finally get it, we wait for him to pick up the card. When he does, he's a little frantic and starts leaning in to pick up some plates, and as he does, there is a knife in his fist, pointed at my head. I actually to dart myself backward to avoid being stabbed in the eye by this server!! It doesn't stop there, having moved back enough just to put an inch between myself and the knife, the server continues to jerk around and I have to actually avoid that knife 3 times. That is NOT good. NOT GOOD. He then hits my husband in the head with his other hand before leaving our table."},{"name":"Max & Erma's","address":"7480 Sawmill Rd","city":"Dublin","stars":"2.5","text":"Great place for dining in, but don't waste your time with carryout.

This place sucks, it does no service to Charles Bukowski, and I fear it may be the bleeding edge of turning Inman Square into Kendall Square.\\n\\nThe Catholic notion of sin and atonement says that sin puts the world out of order, and atonement is the process by which the would is put back into order. In that spirit, and in the spirit (but not imitation) of Charles Bukowski himself, let me just say this:\\n\\nBukowski used to be a seedy, divey place where the menu cursed at you, they had a lot of beers, and your shoes stuck to the floor. Now it has a sterile Five Horses-type ambiance, but way way less authentic. It feels like the owner revamped it to be generically \\"bar,\\" kept the name, and counted on the tech douchebag bros to keep the place afloat. No more Cambridge weirdos here, no more rough and tumble locals -- hell, not even the hip of Camberville would dare go near this nondescript cynical palace to capitalism named after one of its sharpest critics. Freaking gross. Will the entire world be turned into the South End? God help us.\\n\\nSure, they had a late-season glass of Smoke & Dagger for me, and a good but pointless \\"Dark Saison\\" from Idle Hands, and service at the bar was fine. These days, I look upon 23 draft lines as a burden rather than a luxury, a sign that a bar is trying too hard. Style upon unnecessary style of beer available to satisfy your most twee of hyper-local hyper-artisinal, hyper-bitter sensibilities, this masquerading as sophistication. The intolerable snobs from beeradvocate.com have convinced lazy bar owners that the road to riches is through more than 20 draft lines of microbrewed beer, all of which taste bitter, sharp, and piney. It is summer: I'll just take a Pilsner, please.\\n\\nI thought the crowd at this place might be similar to other bars nearby, people who live in the area, cool professors, people with one leg, and the odd couple on a date. A few weeks ago I was at a bar down the street, there was a live bluegrass band with an electric mandolin, and there was a dude with plugs in his ears, covered from head to toe with aggressive tattoos, wearing a spiked collar, and just totally into the folksy old-timey music. He was from Saugus! I liked that guy! He doesn't go to Bukowski.\\n\\nNo, I don't even know where they found these people in Cambridge. Un-reconstructed fans of Glen Danzig, tech dudes with huge dense beards and a disgusting sense of financial and sexual entitlement, bald old guys in suits hitting on waitresses, grad students young in their career as grad students who don't know better, and just generalized bros.\\n\\nDon't go here, seriously.

While not all the food is purely authentic, you get the chance to try multiple street foods of different countries in Asia including but not limited to China, Vietnam, Korea, Thailand, and Singapore.\\n\\nThe food here is actually pretty good but I feel it was a tiny bit overpriced for each of the items offered especially since you can go to an authentic family-owned business for much cheaper. I thought it was funny that nuoc mam, which is fish sauce, was disguised as \\"Vietnamese vinaigrette\\" on their menu but I guess many people wouldn't want to try the food if it has a fish sauce ingredient in it.

Previous visits included ordering from the lunch menu & their high tea menu. TWG has my favorite dessert of all time-Singapore Surprise.\\n\\nWith my most recent visit I immediately asked if they had it-when you walk by the dessert display case, you can see which desserts are available. I didn't see the Singapore surprise dessert & was on the verge of having a pity party for myself-because it's really THAT good. The server was extremely sweet and went to the kitchen to see if there was one available...in which they did!  We were sitting close to the kitchen and I saw some sort of cake wrapped in tin foil that appeared to be thawing on the counter...which did not bother me.\\n\\nFor teas I had the Singapore surprise (it smelled & sort of tasted like the dessert that I was going to order-it's a sweeter tea with hints of strawberry). I enjoyed it & could have had it without adding any sugar/milk.  My Bestie ordered the Night in Bombay which was really good! Hints of bergamot (which is normally in one of my favorite teas- creamy earl grey).  I would order this next time; however this tea tastes better when you add a bit of sugar & milk. \\n\\nWe ordered the following:\\n¬∑         The Foie-gras Terrine ($29) 4/5\\n¬∑         1837 salad: \\"...mesclun salad w/ a composition of a smoked duck \\n           breast and a foie gras medallion....\\" 3/5\\n¬∑         Cheese and Bacon Crepe: caramelized bacon, charlotte potatoes, \\n          cr√®me fraiche & onion jam accompanied by melted Swiss \\n    artisanal raclette cheese 5/5\\n¬∑         Croque Monsieur: 3/5\\n¬∑         Dessert: Singapore surprise 4/5\\n\\nOverall food: 4/5\\nService: 4.5/5\\nAmbiance: 5/5\\n\\nThe Foie-gras was delicious & the portion size was fair (for an entr√©e priced appetizer, you definitely got a good amount of foie-gras). I think this would be more appropriate for a larger party to share & for that much Foie-gras, more crisps/crackers should have been given (not just a little cracker per foie gras slice). Perhaps even some pickled vegetables would have been a nice addition to the dish.\\n\\nThe 1837 salad was a bit underwhelming for me. I was so focused on the smoke duck breast I didn't realize there was a foie gras medallion on top (so there was too much foie gras for the both of us-we were sick of foie gras, which never happens!).  I also did not realize/understand what smoked duck breast meant. I assumed it was a smoky-flavored pieces of duck breast (like actual pieces & not thinly-sliced cured meat). I didn't even realize I was eating duck, as it looked like super thinly sliced pieces of purple carrot. There weren't that many pieces & I think the reason why it was $29 was because of the foie gras medallion (which I did not need more of).  I wouldn't order this dish again.\\n\\nThe Cheese & Bacon crepe was hands down my favorite dish of the day. It was a good portion & flavors were good. I would either order this/try another savory crepe.\\n\\nThe Croque monsieur was ok, I've had it before, it's very basic & not that special.\\n\\nSingapore Surprise: as mentioned earlier in my review, I noticed some sort of cake being thawed out. This was definitely this dessert that they were thawing.  I think they likely have this dessert on site but it just depends on when they decide to thaw the dessert & whether they decide be serve it in their dessert display. I am pretty sure they thawed this dessert for me (which I absolutely appreciate and will come back to TWG again) so of course the dessert wasn't exactly perfect.  The flavor profile was perfect, but the texture was a bit too frozen in the center-it was like an icy slice of ice-cream cake.  I was very happy to have it, even though it wasn't how remembered it.\\n\\nOur server was very charming & attentive; however the only thing that I would suggest for the future is to properly space our meals.  We ordered appetizers (the foie-gras terrine & 1837 salad) to start. We ended up getting all 4 dishes within a few minutes of each other. There was limited space on our table and e couldn't fully enjoy the dishes as the warmer dishes were cold by the time we tried everything. That bothered me a lot but what can you say once all of the dishes have arrived?  Also the dessert arrived when we still had food left on our table (the foie-gras that we couldn't finish). I appreciate they remembered to put in a candle for my friend, but minor details like ensuring there is enough space\\nbetween meals is important.  \\n\\nOverall, I had a lovely dining experience.

They said NO!!  What???   I begged them to do it for me.  Flat out no.  Never ever go to GIOS roast beef.  Awful awful awful customer service.

Everything was amazing but the Fried Chicken sausage stood out the most. The collard greens the fried chicken sausage were served with were also very good.\\n\\nBeing from South East Texas and I had to try the Alligator Boudin, it was great. I do feel like they should try not serving it on a bun but with crackers and hot sauce like every other place in SETX or SWLA that serves Boudin. It was good regardless with the just the right amount of liver and gator. \\n\\nAll of the other sausages I tried were amazing and after a quick dip at barton springs my friends and I ended up coming back and each got our own serving of the chicken sausage.. unfortunately they were out of greens so I tried the German potato salad which was probably the best German potato salad I've ever had.\\n\\nI wanted to try to the snickers in a jar but they were sold out such is the store of my life.... and the only thing preventing me from giving them that other star.\\n\\nNow..

While they didn't have a carne asada burrito option, the steak that they did have was pretty respectable. Cut into slices rather than chunks, it was able to avoid being dry and worked well in the burrito. The burrito itself ended up being pretty solid, and I enjoyed how they heated the tortilla to the point where it had a little crispness to it, rather than the completely soft tortillas I'm so used to. The added perks here are the nachos and salsa that come with your order, and the wide array of hot sauces they keep. While I didn't find anything I'd consider a contender for the best carne asada in Massachusetts, I would definitely come back for a respectable and cheap burrito."},{"name":"Ball Square Cafe","address":"708 Broadway","city":"Somerville","stars":"4.5","text":"I did not like this place, and I will never go back here.\\n\\nI'd heard many good things about Ball Square Cafe, despite the owner's apparently ugly divorce from Sound Bites.

Despite that, we were not seated for 30 minutes.  The owner decided to seat a few parties of his friends (I should add that they arrived at least 10 minutes after us) ahead of my friend and me.  This would be forgivable if it only happened once.  Maybe twice.  But it happened three times, until all the tables were taken, and we were forced to wait.  The kicker - the owner made an extremely rude comment to my friend and me because we were \\"in the way\\" of his friends who were being seated ahead of us.  \\n\\nThe food is nothing to write home about.  I had an omelette, and my friend had a burger.  The place has more of New Jersey diner feel to it, both in atmosphere and food quality.

Out of all these, nothing really stood out, and nothing was really worth.\\n\\nThe chicken hearts were just normal. One skewer for $3 isn't unreasonable, but the taste was so average that I can't even remember it and wouldn't get again.\\n\\nChicken liver mousse was the best thing we got that night. Tasted exactly how you'd expect, which is nice. The texture was not as light as I had expected, and was a little harder than what I normally get with mousse, but the taste was good.\\n\\nThe Wednesday Supper Club came with the beer-battered fish and chips. The fish was super tender, which was nice, but also half batter, which wasn't great. The taste was pretty good though, but nothing noteworthy. You can get something like this in many other places for a cheaper price. Ginger cake is not really my thing, and I only took one bite, so I won't comment on it.\\n\\nThe wagyu sirloin was dry beyond belief. I tried one pieces after eating my own dish, and was tired from chewing. The taste was also subpar. Reminds me of a cheap steakhouse with well-done steak. Don't get this...\\n\\nLastly, the wild boar confit. This dish actually wasn't bad, but again, would never come back for it. Way over priced for what it was, and it smelled like fish sauce (unexpected, but not unpleasant for me).

After reading rave reviews we decided to try this place. We ordered the sushi deluxe and yakitori combo. \\n\\nSushi looked like something we would find at a Japanese supermaket in LA. The sushi deluxe was $34 for low quality 8 pieces of sushi and 6 pieces of tuna maki.  Shrimp sushi was the cheap cooked shrimp (ebi) instead of sweet shrimp (amaebi), what a disappointment!\\n\\nWhen server brought yakiyori combo my jaw dropped. Everything looked soggy and disgusting.  It is supposed to be charcoal grilled and crispy on the outside. I don't think they charcoal their yakitori here. Chicken smelled really bad with distinct poultry smell so I took one bite and stopped eating it.  I am not a chef but know how to get rid of poultry smell from chicken.  It was also very bland with no flavor and needed more seasoning. \\n\\nI don't understand how this restaurant has such good reviews.

The traditional Irish inspired pub fare was as expected.  \\n\\nFlatbreads were a popular choice with the classic margarita and the chicken Caesar.  If you like garlic and Parmesan cheese, try the Caesar.  \\n\\nAlso the Waxy, a burger with bacon, onion strings, cheddar cheese and lettuce, tomato and onion severed with BBQ sauce made for a filling, yet messy choice.  The Pub Burger was also chosen as a more traditional burger without all the added toppings above.  The fries were ample, but would have been better if crispier.  \\n\\nThe Sirloin tips were also a popular choice by a couple of friends.  However, they seemed to be lacking in marinated taste at $20.  \\n\\nI ordered the Peppered Chicken as a healthier option.  Boneless and skinless chicken breast grilled (I asked for the cream sauce on the side) with vegetables.  It was good, but the $17 price is a little steep...however, it is Lexington.  Salads with added chicken, shrimp, salmon, or steak tips are also an option that I may explore on my next visit.  \\n\\nOverall, the service at Waxy's was better than expected and the full bar was appreciated and put to good use.

My initial impression of the restaurant was good - the decor and ambience felt warm and inviting. Unfortunately, that was the end of all the positives. \\n\\nService:\\nThe waitresses and presumably the manager were incredibly rude. When we ordered our food, the waitress never even looked at us - she just barked out \\"next\\" while writing our orders and labelled each of us as a number and told us to remember that number to pay for the bill after. I have never had to do this in a restaurant before. For the rest of the meal, we always had to wave them over whenever we wanted anything and I think the only time they came to us on their own was to tell us to leave after we paid the bill. We also heard them speaking about us in Cantonese which did not seem very professional - fortunately we understand Cantonese and heard every word.\\n\\nFood:\\nThe late night menu looked attractive initially. I ordered a salmon aburi, a chopped scallop don, and fried oysters. The salmon aburi was good. The chopped scallop don had way too much mayonnaise and miracle whip. Even though it was pretty small, I had trouble finishing it because it felt so thick and heavy. The worst dish, however, was the fried oysters. It was around $8 and it came as 6 or 7 fried oysters. I ate the first couple and wasn't very impressed. I felt like I was eating mostly batter and a little bit of oyster. For the rest of my oysters, I cut them open and was not surprised to see that each \\"oyster\\" was at least 80% batter and the oyster within was just a spiced portion of an actual oyster! This was just complete dishonesty and I really don't understand why they did this. Customers aren't stupid and I think most would agree that it's better to have 3 full real oysters rather than 7 battered up fractions of oysters.\\n\\nValue:\\nI think the oysters speak for themselves. $8 is a steep price for fried batter. Overall, my meal including a beer came to around $21 before tax and tips... Considering that AYCE restaurants are around $18 for late night menus, this restaurant was just awful. I got worse service, limited food, and lower quality food for a higher price.\\n\\nBottom line:\\nAwful, dishonest business that will need to work hard to win back anyone."},{"name":"IL Mondo Pizzeria","address":"738 Huntington Ave","city":"Boston","stars":"3","text":"I absolutely love the value at Il Mondo - oftentimes I want to get multiple slices to substantiate a meal, but here one slice is delicious and suits me plenty.

Great atmosphere and very kind service here.  Super clean as well.  The only reason why I give this place 3 stars is because of the price of the draft beer.  I feel like the beer is over priced and does not motivate me to buy a second one while I'm there.  I'd rather buy a 6 pack of my favorite beer at HEB, serve it in a chilled mug at my house instead of breaking the bank with just one beer.

I grew up eating tacos at a place called Tamale House that was on Airport Blvd and I was hoping this was the same family. \\nUpon arrival i actually passed it up because the building didn't jump out to me, after circling around i noticed the sign.  Parking in the area can be found but its not necessarily the easiest or greatest.  Had to park about a block away and pay at one of those parking meters.\\nWe found our way inside and to the register to place our order.  The man at the front was very welcoming and helped navigate the menu and offered suggestions since this was our first time here. We ordered a chalupa plate, 2 tamales, a fish taco, dads fajita taco, chinita pibil taco, 2 Mexican cokes, and a beer, which came out to be a little over $40.  To start the tamales are huge.  They had good flavor but a lot of masa.  I feel that the extra masa made them taste a little dry.  I think you can get them covered in an enchilada sauce or con carne sauce.  If so then that would put them on point.  The chalupa was good, covered edge to edge with beans, meat, and toppings.  The fajita taco and cochinita taco were both stuffed with meat and had good flavor, although a little on the cold side.  For me the star of the show was the fish taco.  It was a big piece of grilled fish on 2 corn tortillas with spinach and a tangy sauce.  the fish was so big i could barely close the taco.  I used the second tortilla that was underneath and split the fish and toppings between the 2 tortillas.  The fish was hot and flaky with the right touch of seasoning. I could have eaten 4-5 of those tacos they were so good.  I might even go so far as to say these are one of the best fish tacos in Austin!\\nThe patio area is cool to sit on for and has some shade. My only warning is that there can be lots of birds in the trees.  If there are birds in the trees sit under an umbrella or run the risk of getting a surprise dropped on you.  All in all a great place. I look forward to going back and trying their breakfast and of course eating more of their fish tacos."},{"name":"Banger's Sausage House & Beer Garden","address":"79 81 & 81.5 Rainey St","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"First time trying poutine!!!

So I came to Tamale House around 11 AM on Friday and I ordered 2 Chipotle Migas & Queso (fresh eggs scrambled with pan-fried corn tortillas, queso and smoky chipotle salsa) breakfast tacos. The breakfast tacos are HUGE, one taco is more than enough, they use a good medium-sized tortilla, and this was my first introduction to migas, and the introduction was well received. It had a nice contrast of textures. Soft scrambled eggs with a crunchy lightly pan-fried corn tortilla, and bit of a kick from the smokey chipotle salsa and cheese all mixed together, my goodness, mouthgasmic. I don't know why LA doesn't do migas or breakfast tacos but we need to get onboard with it! I also had a Mexican iced coffee which I've never had before but I thoroughly enjoyed the cold brew coffee with horchata, so innovative, I'm not sure why I didn't think of that but from now on I'll have to make that combination.

Made a reservation for 2 for a Friday night but it didnt really appear that I needed one.   Not that the place wasn't busy but I'm sure it would have only been a short wait.\\n\\nThe interior is very simple, clean, bright.  Tables are a bit too close together which is just a pet peeve of mine.  I understand the need to utilize every nook and cranny in a restaurant for maximum profits but there is something about catching someone's backside inches away from you eating your meal too.  \\n\\nOur server was somewhat prompt and friendly I believe they could have been more attentive or faster though.   There was one moment where I  saw our server get a glass of wine from the bar for another table and oddly, the server stopped for a second to 'sniff' the wine.   Wasn't exactly sure what was going on with that but if you thought you might have gotten the wrong wine I dont think you should sniff it to check.\\n\\nOn to the food.   My friend and I got the tagliatelle and the gnocchi along with a side of the brussels sprouts.   They had a whole and 1/2 version or small and large whatever you want to call it and regardless of taste and ingredients....WAY overpriced for the portion size provided.   I wish I had taken a picture because had you saw the portions we got for the 'small' version alongside the price you would have probably laughed out loud like we did.   \\n\\nI would like to note that I have been in the food/restaurant industry for over 25yrs.  I have been in the front of the house, back of the house and done the books so not calling myself an expert but only that I have some experience.\\n\\nThe actually tagliatelle dish lacked flavor, the pasta itself was fine but the bolognese desperately needed some salt or something.   The gnocchi was tasteful perhaps a little on the bland side but if you're going to call it gnocchi with braised lamb, put some more lamb.   \\n\\nI can't say anything negative about the brussels sprouts side dish other than it was overpriced.  For $9 the portion size should have been at least another 1/2 amount more.\\n\\nOverall the food was ok, some better but for the price I just dont think it's worth it.

Food 3 stars, service 4 stars, total 3.5 stars.  (I also wish Yelp would let us give half stars!!!)\\n\\nA group of us came for dinner.  When we arrived early evening, only a few tables were occupied.  But after spending about 2.5 hours there, the place was packed, on a weeknight.  The restaurant is one huge spacious rectangle, with 2 large, impressive bars (makes me want to drink) and a gelato station in the front.  The lighting is a bit dim, which makes it difficult to read the menu.  The open kitchen sits in one of the rear corners.  And at the back of the room, there's a fireplace, which I hear is fully functional and roaring during the winter.  There is also a basement level for their dinner shows on specific days of the week.\\n\\nOnce we sat down, our server Emily was very professional, friendly and accommodating.  I had ordered a glass of wine.  The wine steward let me taste a little bit.  Luckily, she did because I did not like the one I chose.  She was more than willing to let me choose another.  Kudos!  A basket of bread started the meal, with olive oil dip.  Then for appetizers, we had a round of pizzas, listed in order of my preference.  The pizza crust is very good, thin and crispy.  The pepperoni had traditional tomato sauce but the overall taste was lacking.  The steak pizza was basically mashed potatoes on the crust with few pieces of beef on top.  Interesting but kind of weird on a pizza.  In the mushroom was Fontina cheese which added a little bit of creaminess but all the mushrooms were tasteless.  We also got a Margherita but I did not partake.\\n\\nNow onto the entrees.  We ordered eggplant parmagiana, rigatoni bolognese, sausage carvatelli, chicken alfredo, and seared scallops.  The eggplant was a thin flat piece instead of layers.  It was alright, nothing special, and it came with a pasta marinara.  The rigatoni bolognese had some meat taste but not much.  The sausage carvatelli just did not do anything for me.  I also don't like my sausage all minced up; I prefer chunks for flavor.  The alfredo was actually pretty good; it just needed more sauce to make it shine.  The yummy seared scallops came with a pesto risotto.  Scallops thumbs up, risotto meh.\\n\\nOne small issue I had was with the bussers trying to clear the dishes when there's still food on them.  Ask, then clear.  Not the other way around.  Although the restaurant looks good, especially the two huge bars, the whole restaurant is noisy.  It is so loud that I have a hard time hearing the person sitting right next to me.  Maybe I'll come back another time and just order some drinks, which I hope taste better than the food."},{"name":"Grecian Gyro","address":"3989 Lawrenceville Hwy","city":"Tucker","stars":"3.5","text":"When I first moved to Atlanta, I used to live around here and Tucker was not its own municipality but an unincorporated part of Dekalb County and Lawrenceville Highway was a wide boulevard with old school brick ranch homes sitting in stands of Southern pine and which led out to the sticks.  Then I moved to the north end of town, and ITP to boot, rarely coming back to visit my baptismal place to the metro Atlanta area.\\n\\nFast forward to an incorporated Tucker that has been on the up and up, with newer shopping centers and more choices in food, be they chains or ethnic cuisine, including Cuban, for example.  As I was motoring down Lawrenceville Highway, the colors of the Greek flag and the image of a Greek temple caught my eye, as did the word GYRO.  Solution:  pull in and take a look at what they have to offer, given that I was on an empty stomach.\\n\\nBasically, Grecian Gyro is a mini chain with a few stores in the metro Atlanta area and offers another option if you like Greek food but don't feel like eating it at a full service restaurant and paying what that would entail.  They offer stand alone Greek items and they offer the typical combination platters.  They also offer things you can add on the side, such as spanakopita.  Lastly, who doesn't like a triangular wedge of baklava ... on the cheap?\\n\\nI see the variability of the reviews and, taking a middle of the road approach, a 3 star rating can easily be had.  The food is somewhere between o.k. and pretty good.  My combination plate's gyro tasted just like all the ones you get all around the U.S. and Canada where the meat comes from that round upright contraption and, fortunately, they had Greek potatoes whereas some Greek places serve fries, which is unauthentic and generally pisses me off.\\n\\nIf I go into a fast food place and am dressed down, those at the counter should feel perfectly free to sass with me and they sometimes do, though not so much in the upper left corner of the country.  Bring it on.  Funny sass is good.  Friendly sass is good.  Clever sass is good, too.  However, being a sass and an ass at the same time is no good.  Here, the service was quick and those working when I patronized the store were fun folks - funny, friendly, and clever.  Not only that, the prices were reasonable.

My first visit I had a chimichanga, one of my traditional favorite Mexican dishes.  It was pretty good.  In looking over their menu, however, they offer so much more than other Mexican restaurants.   My latest visit I tried their Gran Fiesta Special.  YUM!  It's a grilled seafood dish with a tilapia filet, shrimp and lobster.   It was on a bed of steamed vegetables which included chopped broccoli and cauliflower, sliced carrots and diced tomatoes.  The dish was topped off with a creamy white cheese sauce.   The portion was quite large.

I had my fleece jacket on as well as my husbands jacket on.  I notices everyone sitting in the restaurant was wearing a jacket or fleece while seated.  I honestly think I would have been warmer sitting outside.   The next issue was the menu.  Almost everything is a la carte.  Most of the Steaks were 12 oz or larger.  The lobster was 1.25 lbs.  There is no chance I could eat that much food.  So I decided to order an appetizer and a side of cauliflower.  They brought me nearly an entire head of cauliflower.  My husband ordered potatos that came and were the consistency of chowder.  I think someone might be happy eating there if there were 4 or more people who could all share.  There was no light dinner or average size dinner that could be ordered.  It was also very expensive.  My husbands steak was $58.00 and his runny potatos were $12.00.  A 6 oz glass of wine was $17.00 and that was probably the least expensive wine on the list.  I would have been happy to pay a lot for a meal that was a complete dinner entre such as a petite fillet, a vegetable and a potato.  There werent any dinners that were listed like that.  So to get a balanced meal I would have had to order large a la carte plates to create that.  The cost woukd have been exhorbident and most would have been wasted.

DR has about a dozen tables and few additional high tops towards the back.  They seem to do a lot of pre-orders / take-outs as you enter the resto, there's an order and pick up counter facing you.

I ordered a soy chicken rice plate, deep fried tofu, salt and pepper squid and pork century egg congee. The squid was quite tasty, still had a crisp to it.  The tofu was a bit bland, but still enjoyable. The congee was actually missing the pork, but a decent congee nonetheless. What made me rate this restaurant a one star was for the soy chicken rice plate, and the rude waitress we talked to over the phone. As soon as I opened the box to my soy chicken, I was immediately disappointed and contacted the restaurant. Which made no attempt to resolve the situation but instead angered us even more by being rude and in complete denial. It was the saddest, driest, and smallest plate of soy chicken I've ever had or seen. I believe I got the left over scraps of chicken at the end of the night, which they probably thought was just barely enough to maybe fool someone into believing that this was a full order. They gave me a few extra pieces of yu choy sum (green leaf vegetable) as a attempt to cover the up the obvious disproportional chicken to rice ratio.  I got literally 6 scrawny pieces of chicken, not the meaty and juicy ones but the skin and bone parts, oh sorry I got one decent piece. I felted cheated, because if you've never had soy chicken rice before, there's literally chicken, rice and a couple pieces of vegetables and obviously the chicken is the star of the dish. Just wanted to also add, we called the restaurant and tried our very best to explain to the waitress what we received in the calmest way possible, however we were met with nothing but denial, frustration and disrespect. When we ask to speak with the manager she just made excuses after excuse avoid it from happening. \\n\\nI would sincerely have let everything slide and even be a returning customer if ONLY, the waitress on the other end showed a bit of empathy and respect, however none of that was shown."},{"name":"Cafe Java- Austin","address":"11900 Metric Blvd, Ste K","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"I have been here a few times now.

My thoughts have changed ever since I decided to try some new dishes and I noticed how great the customer service is.\\n\\nFirst, my go-to dishes:\\n\\n- Roti Canai. Do you love warm bread? Yes? Then take everyone's advice on Yelp and order this. It comes with one piece of Roti, but I suggest adding a few more and sharing with friends.\\n\\n- Fish Filet with Black Bean Sauce. This dish was not one that would have appealed to me by the name, but after having a Yelp event at Hawkers where they brought this out I'm hooked! Fear not- it does not taste like your typical Latin American Black bean dish. It's sweet and tart and perfect for those who are not huge fish fans because it masks any bit of fishiness that the dish could have. BIG FAN.\\n\\n- Grilled Lettuce. Right now Hawkers has a check-in offer for their grilled lettuce and though the dish sounds kind of boring, it's actually really surprising! The lettuce is grilled with some sweet and smoky sauce. This dish is a great, light start to a meal.\\n\\n- They have some great beers! Check the list and ask for recommendations!\\n\\nSo, about the customer service- it's GREAT! From the moment you walk in the hostess is always very friendly and gives you a good indication of the time if there's a wait. Luckily, I've never had to wait more than 10 minutes as there are constantly people entering and finishing their meals. \\n\\nWhat really struck me was how flexible the server was when it came to splitting the checks. I've been to a few places recently that struggles with keeping up with who ordered what and splitting shared dishes, but the server was happy to offer to split our shared dishes and the checks came out without a hitch! \\n\\nYes, parking can be a bit rough, but this is Mills50!

Pad Thai was of course delicious, the Tom yum was my girlfriends favorite and the curry laksa was mine. Might I add that the curry laksa was recently vote the best soup in Orlando!!\\n\\nPrices were reasonable and cheap for what was given to us. Appetizers range from 3 to 9 dollars and the entrees average to about 9 dollars. We ordered a Thai iced tea which was sweet, rich, and satisfying. It was 5 dollars but well worth it.

In the past, too many places call it spicy, but the capsaicin detectors don't move, at all. This sauce had a pleasant spice but nonetheless will clear your sinuses better than if you Hoovered them. Additionally, while sweet, the sauce wasn't overly saccharine, having tangy and savory notes. The chicken was tender, and of course, fresh.\\n\\nKimchi - This is a Korean staple I could not pass up. It was crisp, flavorful, and added a nice amount of crunch and freshness to the meal. However, kimchi has a unique flavor that isn't for everyone. \\n\\nShort Rib Soup - You know how you order clam chowdah somewhere and they bring it in an English tea-cup? Not the case... these soups are full meals! I had the short rib soup. This one is very intimidating. The broth is pleasantly mild, with flavorful meat, and other mild, pleasant stuff. What I found most surprising (and great) was the salt level... it was spot on! Too many of these kinds of soup way overdo it on the sodium chloride, not here.\\n\\nFinally, the Grilled Pork Ribs - Pure, sizzling awesomeness. You can tell by the dish still boiling it is fresh as can be. The meat slides right off the bone and is tender as can be.

They have a meat substitute item that they make in house called \\"kalebone\\" which is used in a number of dishes and I thought was pretty good, but very salty. I had it in their play on country fried steak, which was probably the best thing I had there. The mac and cheese is also vegan (I asked the waiter about the sauce which he said included nutritional yeast, but he would not get more specific than that) but I thought it seemed greasy.
