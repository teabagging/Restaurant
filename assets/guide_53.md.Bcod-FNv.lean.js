I had a reservation in the Chef's Gallery for 23 people.  They have a horrible event planner who does not return calls in a professional timeframe (2 wks out).  I had to be persistent in order to reserve our slot, which is unacceptable to me, because this isn't the industry norm.   I've regularly have big groups at various restaurants in Atlanta  (almost every 3 months) and I will say that this experience has been the worst I've had to deal with. That should've been a red flag of what was to come. \\n\\nWhen we arrived at Scales we were told to wait on the rooftop bar and a hostess will come and escort our party to our table, when that didn't happen, we almost missed our reservation due to waiting on the hostess, ( they have a strict 15 min grace period and would've charged our group a cancellation fee). Our group back tracked downstairs in order to meet our time slot.  Just poorly organized.\\n\\nFirst of all, certain items on the menu are great.  The shrimp and grits are awesome, but the ribs are chewy, and the chicken and waffles had a bad after taste according to my guests.  I'm the type of person who refuses to continually patronize a place with piss poor service, I could care less about what the food tastes like or who owns it.  \\n\\nOur food was delivered in groups of 5, with a party of 23 that left 18 people looking around for their plates and by the time the next 5 came, the first group was halfway done with their meals, and this continued throughout the dinner, so basically as a group we didn't eat together.  We asked if they weren't prepared for our group or did they only have one chef and what was the issue, because this was totally unacceptable.  The manager sincerely apologized and attempted to make it up with some champagne.  But the damage had been done.\\n\\n If you're in a large group and you're okay with being treated second class when you're spending your hard earned money, then this is the place for you.  But I refuse to deal with that and Scales 925 don't have to worry about me returning.

It just irks me when I read reviews from people and they have one dish that wasn't cooked to their liking.  When so many others give a place glowing reviews but you don't, then you probably have poor food tasting, your one dish was a one-off and a mistake was made (to which it should have been corrected by the staff and then you should gracefully accept an apology and not make a fuss about it), or you're a Yelp Elitist...which is ironically the worst group of Yelp reviews one can read on this app.  Never take a review from someone in Yelp Elite as plausible.

Since we stuck to the tapas menu, the server was incredibly helpful providing descriptions of the food and more importantly the serving size.  Three of us split small and medium plates of the five items above, plus the men folk had small bowls of the soup of the day (tres pescados).

He seemed to care a lot about us but then forgot everything. I don't expect a waiter to be on top of every little request, but it wasn't that busy.  It took forever for our waiter to come.  It was also kind of weird when I asked for extra napkins and then 15 minutes later he came over and said, \\"you're napkins will be right out\\" as if they were a steaming plate of enchiladas.  Ha!\\n\\n4. I ordered a migas taco which was sub-par.  I couldn't really taste any of the delectable tortilla bits which either made me think that the cooks either forgot to add them or the plate had been sitting there for a while so they were completely soggy. I will usually give Migas at any restaurant a second chance, but I would hesitate to order them from here again.\\n\\n5.

One of the items I chose was the sweet potato souffle which they listed as vegetarian and came topped with marshmallows (which are NOT vegetarian).  The corn bread and sweet bread we were served was very dry and disappointing.  The one thing I had that I would go back for was the tomato pie (tomato, ritz cracker crust, basil, etc).

We always like booth settings, so he reserved a booth for two.  The reservationist told him it would be no problem.  Well we drove in mega traffic for 7:00pm reservations.  We did manage to get there a little early, arrival time was 6:30pm.  We were told to stand to the side to wait on our waitress.  Our waitress took us to what seem to be outside.  We were seated right at what looked like pull down garage windows, the windows were all still up.  My husband immediately stated to our waitress that he ordered a booth.  She pointed to a seat that was right across from where we were to be seated.  It was at the edge of the table where constant traffic walks by, no thank you!! She told us to have a seat and she would check on a booth for us. This would have been a nice spot if we had not specifically requested a booth and if the weather was less breezy, but the temperature had dropped a bit by this time of evening.  Our waitress came back and stated they save the booths for larger crowds, really!!! The place is not overly crowded at this time at all, no one is sitting at plenty available booths as I look around, and this place basically denied a customer's requests.  I couldn't believe what I was hearing.  My husband and I were livid, we asked to speak to the manager who happened to be Thomas Gullo that night.  He continued to tell us the same thing.  My husband told Thomas it was supposed to be a surprise birthday dinner for me, which he communicated at the time of the reservation and was assured that it would be no problem to accommodate a party of 2 for a booth.  Well Thomas stood strong on having a \\"Big Party Only\\" sit at booth.  This was unacceptable service, I asked for his name and he gave me his card.  I told Thomas I am notorious for completing a restaurant and service review and I stated to him that I will be completing one to let everyone know what to expect when dining here.

I also had to send 2 plates back as they were not prepared as we requested (wasn't a small request-just to substitute a couple items due to allergies).\\n2nd time was tonight when we went for their evening happy hour.

My burger (ordered well done) was still pink enough in the middle to bother me. Then to top it off, 5 minutes into out meal (it was 930pm) they shut off half the lights, turned off the music and gave us our bill. I understand they had called last call but that was downright rude. I boxed the rest of our food....left the waiter a good tip and I left.

While she did periodically check up on us, the service seemed pretty slow. \\n\\nThe food was generally overpriced (coming to around $14 for a burger, drink and fries which was something of shame because it was actually pretty good. You could fill out a checklist and name your burger. I decided to name my burger The Benzel (my last name). It featured, spinach, gouda, bacon and mushrooms. \\n\\nThe burger was of reasonable size. The bread was slightly rubbery but the presentation generally looked pretty appetizing. The burger patty was high quality and the blend of toppings was very good overall. Having the option of high quality cheeses like Gouda were a really nice touch. The bacon was nice, thick and flavorful. It was obviously of high quality. The French fries were a tad too cold and were a bit too overdone with Garlic.\\n\\nAll on all, a solid burger in a good location of town with some nice organic/gourmet touches.

For my Daughter's birthday I took her and a few of her friends for lunch at a \\"special\\" restaurant.  They would have been thrilled with Cheesecake Factory but I thought this would be a great experience.  Mind you this was mid afternoon on a Saturday and the place was 1/4 full.  Here I go...\\n\\nFirst we were sat and it took a while for our strangely discombobulated waitress to come over.  Then it took a while for drinks after she made odd comments about my daughter and her friends.  She was trying to be nice but really seemed strangely off.  We couldn't decide what to order when she finally came to ask us the first time and then took forever to come back.  We finally ordered and the food took forever while we ate our frozen butter and cold bread.\\n\\nWhen the food did come we only received 3 of the 5 meals which were basically just dropped off on the table by the back waiters without clearing the bread plates.  They literally just put the food down in the middle of the table.  After about 10 minutes of the other food not arriving, with no sign of our waitress, we grabbed her and asked.  She went to check and came back to say she didn't ring in the meal right and the kitchen didn't make it (she held it).  It took around 10-15 minutes more for us to get a turkey club and pulled pork sandwich.  Still can't figure out what took so long since all they had to do was warm the pork and cook bacon.\\n\\nAfter dropping off the food the magical disappearing waitress didn't come right back to check on us.  If she had I would have told her that most of the bacon on my daughter's sandwich was way undercooked and my $17 pulled pork sandwich was nothing like described on the menu.  We did order pedestrian food but for the price they were charging I would have expected great quality and a little creativity at least.  I got pulled pork on a bun with cloeslaw and my daughter got a below average $14 club sandwich. \\n\\nWhen our friend finally did come by she asked blithely how things were as if they were expected to have been fine an hour+ into what was supposed to be a simple meal.  When I complained about the many issues she went to talk to the manager.  \\n\\nAt this point I would have expected the manager to come over given how royally messed up our meal was.  I am probably only saying half the things that were either weird or bad about the experience so far.  But no, the waitress came back and said \\"she told the manager she messed up\\" and they comped my sandwich and drink and offered us 1 free dessert as if the other 4 ppl were going to sit there and watch which, of course, we didn't want to wait for.  Oh yeah, when I complained about my sandwich the waitress tried to convince me to order a burger because they were better.  Again, we had been there over an hour with me and 4 teenage girls and she is proposing I wait for the slow as crap kitchen to cook me a freaking burger?  Even when I asked for the check she again tried pushing a burger on me.  Really?\\n\\nThe very capable waiter waiting on the tables around us cleared all our dishes and seemed normal and competent.  He was the only person there who seemed to understand that this was supposed to be a decent restaurant.\\n\\nNever saw the manager.

I go to folk art, right, and usually I get breakfast. It's not hard to screw up breakfast, so of course I think Folk Art is amazing. Their breakfast usually rocks my socks!! But the other day, I decided to venture off the breakfast menu. I decided to order the \\"Shrimp and Grits\\". I was excited!! Shrimp and Grits!?! This should be amazing!!!! Unfortunately, it was not. The menu read something along the lines of \\"Shrimp and Grits; with 2 fried eggs and some white toast\\". I was like, \\"oh, sounds good\\". BUT- when they brought it out, it was covered in a red sauce of some sort, and a bunch of onion and peppers. At first, I thought they brought the wrong dish. There seemed to not even be much Grits or shrimp! I didn't finish it, it wasn't bad, but it wasn't great either. I did order a \\"fros√©\\" as well though. So, I ended up paying near $25 dollars for a lunch I did not enjoy. My beef, in this post is not with \\"Folk Art\\" itself-the service is amazing and I am a huge supporter of this place, I love it. But my beef with this post is the miscommunication of the menu item of \\"Shrimp and Grits\\"! I highly, feel like it should have some more info on the menu about the dish. I hate to complain to the staff, which is why I didn't that day. I ordered what I ordered, I will ya for it.

I had the shio. I've always found Santouka's shio ramen to be the tastiest. I've eaten at several Santoukas, both in the US and in Japan, and prefer the shio. It had the texture, and greasy, fatty flavor of the pork bones that tonkotsu ramen is suposed to have, and it's got just the right amount of salt.\\n\\nThe chashyu actually tasted just like the chashyu at all the other Santoukas, so that is good, because I like their chashyu.

The noodles at the cambridge spot are not the same noodles served in Japan, or even in NJ. These noodles were thicker, and wavy, unlike the regular Santouka noodles that are thin, straight, and white in colour. These noodles have an eggier flavor, while the regular Santouka noodles are more delicate in flavor. These noodles were slightly over cooked, and got soggy in the soup quickly.\\n\\nThe service was very good, and the waitress very polite, and attentive.

They were so delicious.\\n\\nWylie's sandwich was the largest I have ever seen and his mountain of shoestring fries overwhelmed the small plate.  Either this sandwich needs to be smaller and the fries portion cut in half, or a bigger plate should be used.

Unfortunately, my wife and I did not have a happy experience.  We went on a Saturday evening about 7:30, and the restaurant was mostly full but the wait for an outdoor table on the patio was short.  Good thing, because the interior was cacaphonous -- the design style is a dreary art-deco warehouse that amplifies all conversations to the point of a low roar.  Quite impossible for table chat.\\n\\nI'm not sure why the patio is so impressive to some -- yeah, it's covered, here is a nice breeze from the ceiling fans,  and there are nice oak trees around the perimeter, but basically all you look out on is a short expanse of greenery and then Slaughter Lane, with traffic constantly whizzing by.   Great if you can't get enough road noise in your life.  \\n\\nWe had a couple of margaritas on the rocks -- quite large, and acceptable.  The tostadas were good, and the salsa acceptable but not more.   The appetizer menu is disappointing.  Not much to chose from, no quesadillas for example.  We picked an order of a half-dozen  pork tamales with chili con carne as our starter instead.  These came on a big platter and were on the bland side.  The rest of our meal was brought before we got very far with these, we could have used a bit more time to finish the first course.  \\n\\nMy wife thought the fish tacos were quite good, but my basic cheese enchiladas  with chili con carne sauce were dull.  The heat has been toned down to the non-existent side in accord with gringo tastes, I assume, and the cheese tasted processed.  I've had much better at other places in town.  Mexican eateries, especially those in the swanky parts of town, please -- don't presume that just because your clientele is mainly non-hispanic that they want bland food! \\n\\nWe were most distressed by the uptight yuppie diners around us.  Being old Austin types, we are still put out at the californication of our once  cheerful city.  There was a black stray cat hanging around the patio and we asked our waitress if it belonged to the restaurant.  Yes, she said.  So being animal lovers and cat owners ourselves, we hospitably offered the cat some treats from our plates.  In civilized  places  like France or Italy or old Austin, this would be quite unremarkable.  But in New Boomtown Austin, things are different.  Immediately came  squeals of protest from some other diners, prissily complaining that they had allergies to cats, they didn't come to eat with cats, their husband would have to go to the hospital, etc.  Melodrama city,  and put in very rude terms.  One wonders why they are outdoors at all if they're so afraid of  encountering some form of the natural  environment.  Then the wait staff and some manager type decided to chase the  now-scared cat around for the rest of the time we were there, causing a continual disruption on the patio.  So which is it, is the poor animal a stray, or is it tolerated some of the time?  There needs to be a better way to handle this situation.  The cat could be humanely trapped if it's a problem and taken to an adoption center (I'll volunteer myself).  But to terrorize it for being a hungry stray is needlessly cruel.  We were extremely put out by the whole incident, the attitude of the restaurant staff (except for a few sympathetic staffers), and the whiny complaints from what I assume are typical self-satisfied Circle C suburbanites.  I worry that the unhappy cat will be be made to pay the price for being homeless and unloved in Austin.   I doubt very much we'll ever return to Nuevo Leon after this bizarre experience, even if the food had been better."},{"name":"Hair of the Dog Brewery and Tasting Room","address":"61 SE Yamhill St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"awesome strong brews.  they had the best selection of beers, food (try the briscut) and atmosphere as a whole compared to the 3 other brewery's i visited on my trip to portland.\\n\\nseemed like an easy location to find and park."},{"name":"Poor Calvin's","address":"510 Piedmont Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4.5","text":"Review 1678 or whatever.

When we actually tried to get the other servers to help us they were unresponsive. In terms of food, we both ordered the smokes salmon dishes - one hash, one bagel plate. The smoked salmon was a standout on both plates but the bagel was a little less than fresh. The espresso was also a bit bitter and not in that great strong Portland coffee way.

When asked what bone marrow was, he shrugged slightly and said ...\\"the inside of the bone\\" ... thank you, I couldn't never figure that out. The server then told me that most people ignore his recos to eat the dish so he just stopped telling people. Wrong choice, dude. \\n\\nMy entree, the bar steak, a little more medium rare than medium, had nice flavor. The Brussels were good but a bit too salty and tangy for my liking. \\n\\nIt took reminders for him to bring  my friend the drink she ordered, and then dessert was below par.

Yes, the server actually told me this when I asked if there was something wrong with the dessert. If it's not the traditional red velvet cake, then yes, that would be a good bit of intel to help guide my decision.

I never experienced BBQ this good before.  Growing up and living in Houston, I've tried a variety of BBQ, but not like this!\\n\\nWhen I came to Austin to visit for the weekend, my friend and I knew we were going to get some BBQ but we weren't sure where.  We quickly turned to yelp and it led us to a place called Franklins.  We decided to stop by since it was close to our hotel and once our eyes saw the line, we kept on driving along.  Then I turned to yelp once again to look for another BBQ place and JMueller popped up and we drove along to this place.  \\n\\nWhen we arrived in the parking area around 11:30, we parked our car and as we started walking towards the line, I saw that the guy at the end was holding a \\"sold out\\" sign.  My friend spoke to the guy and the guy told him that he had to turn about 5 other people away because John gave him the sign to hold.  We started walking back to our car when John ran up to us out behind his smoker and told us that he thinks he may have some food for us.  My eyes lit up because I was not only hungry but craving BBQ because of the smell coming out from his smoker.\\n\\nWhile standing in line, we started small talk with a couple of people from the line.  They were telling us about how great this place was and telling us about all the other BBQ places in the Austin area.  \\n\\nBy the time we reached the front to order, they were out of a couple of things but we got to order, the brisket, sausage, the pork ribs, and the squash side.  OMG.  \\n\\nI never experienced sausage that was so moist that it created a hole in the strong white paper that serve BBQ on.  It was packed with moisture and flavor.  \\n\\nThe brisket was fantastic and a must order.\\n\\nWe took some of our leftovers to go back to Houston and hours later, wow...........the food was still good.  The sausage and pork ribs were still tasty.\\n\\nNext time I visit, I will definitely make it a point to arrive earlier so I can try their beef ribs.\\n\\nBest of all, the owner seems like a pretty cool guy.

We had fun, but I was a little disappointed, overall. \\n\\nThe restaurant is TINY, so you have to make reservations way in advance.  Because of the size, I felt like the diners were all packed in like sardines.  We had to sit at the bar, which I understand, but it is a little annoying to be squished at the bar right next to another couple for a special-occasion dinner. Especially when I made a reservation a month in advance.  Also, It was also so hot that I was sweating profusely the whole time. Not exactly their fault since it was June in Austin, but combined with the cramped quarters and the uncomfortable bar stools, it made for a pretty unpleasant dining experience. \\n\\nOur waiter (also the bartender) was nice and helpful, but service was pretty slow and we sometimes had to wait a really long time between courses (maybe we eat too quickly).\\n\\nHOWEVER, the reason we really came here was for the food and while the menu was really adventurous and playful, I cannot say that Lenoir delivered on all the dishes.  \\n\\nWe had the bread plate (flatbread with rabbit \\"boudin\\" and jam), a charred tomato salad with whey sorbet, octopus curry, fish (sorry, I can't remember which kind) with squash blossom and tom yum, buttermilk rabbit, antelope heart with dosa and a ginger pie with mint ice cream.\\n\\nI had a real problem with the salt levels of most of the dishes and conversely, I found the rest to be bland. My favorite dishes were the bread plate, the fish with Tom yum and the antelope hearts, but even the tom yum was too salty, in my opinion. It makes me sad to say, but none of the dishes were so good that it would make me return.  They were A LOT of components and garnishes for every dish which made for a pretty presentation, but I didn't feel most of the ingredients added to the overall flavors.  I can now say with certainty that I am neither a fan of whey sorbet nor their mint ice cream, but that's just a matter of taste, I suppose.\\n\\nObviously I'm no restaurant critic (wha??) and I think I may have had to high of expectations for this restaurant, but it wasn't my favorite to be sure.  I would say that if $150 for dinner is not a big deal, then definitely try Lenoir because it's a fun experience and concept, but  maybe don't pick this restaurant for a special occasion that you're splurging on."},{"name":"Via 313 Pizza - West 6th","address":"600 W 6th St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"I'm originally from the Detroit area (Warren) and I never knew we had a style till I ran across VIA 313. \\n\\nDetroit style basically means square pieces in a medium deep dish pan.

This was one place that I had on my agenda as a must do since I missed it the last time I was there. I first tried the original location on SW 3rd Ave. However, the line was waayyy to long so I went for the Davis Street location. Score! The line wasn't too bad at all. I felt like a kid all over again as I looked into the big window looking at all the different donuts that I could pick. By the time I got up to the counter I was so ready to order....I went for the Bacon Maple Bar and also the Memphis Mafia donut. \\n\\nThe Bacon Maple Bar is as good as it sounds. The crisp bacon offered up the perfect texture and flavor to the smooth sweet taste of the maple bar. Honestly, I could have eaten around 5 of these in one sitting. \\n\\nAfter wolfing down the Bacon Maple Bar, I dug into the Memphis Mafia donut which is a huge donut reminiscent of an apple fritter, except this delight has chunks of banana, cinammon, peanut butter. chocolate, chocolate chips, and peanuts. There were a lot of tastes going on, but it was insanely good. It was so sweet that I couldn't eat it all at once. However, in all fairness I did start eating this right after the Bacon Maple Bar so my body was probably in shock from all the sugar. \\n\\nBoth were good, but my favorite was the simpler Bacon Maple Bar. They have an extensive menu so the next time I am up there I am planning on giving the Voodoo Doll donut a try, and of course I have to get that Bacon Maple donut again.\\n\\nShould you go? YES! Just remember, if you don't want to wait in as long of a line consider the Davis location. There is also a parking lot in that location as well.\\n\\nI love you Voodoo Donut."},{"name":"Bison County BBQ Bar & Grille","address":"275 Moody St","city":"Waltham","stars":"3.5","text":"Not impressed with there BBQ.

In particular, my BF and I had our (awesome!) first date there, so I was anxious to go back again; when I got a new job, we decided to make a reservation at Backspace and celebrate over dinner. We waited until a Sunday, since we knew most places are crowded Friday and Saturday, and even made the reservation to avoid a hassle. I was looking forward to the veggies and the pizza. I am particularly fond of the house made ricotta.\\n\\nWhen we arrived, we explained we had a reservation, and were directed to a 2-top which was being imposed upon by a large party at the adjacent table. The other half of the restaurant was entirely unoccupied. After we moved the table so we could be seated without sitting on top of the adjacent party, we made small talk, during which time the two servers on the floor saw to the three occupied tables and ignored us. No \\"I'll be right with you,\\" \\"One moment,\\" nothing. One server went through a particularly lengthy introduction of a bottle of wine to our adjacent table, during which time the customer carried on and made a production about tasting the wine. Again, no one acknowledged we were waiting. After about five minutes, things between us headed toward awkward silence while we waited for the servers to acknowledge our presence, need for menus, etc. As a former server, I couldn't deal, and suggested we leave. We waited another minute or two, and again, no acknowledgement of our existence from the servers. Our neighbors got their wine and the servers exited, as did we shortly thereafter.\\n\\nSo we went to another high-end restaurant nearby... seated and greeted, water and menus within two minutes with an intro from the server.

I've had better buns as well, but it was still good.\\n\\nOne time I went the noodles were a little chewy but as it sat in the broth it got softer. Other times the noodles have been great.

The restaurant probably missed out on a full additional round of cocktails, at least 2-3 more bottles of wine, and coffee service.

The primary server must have had somewhere to go because the evening seemed rushed. \\n\\nThe food. Our NY Strip group universally complained of low quality cuts that were hard to cut, chew and swallow. The strips were compared to Outback or an all you can eat buffet.

Not epic, but not bad either. \\n\\nThe bottom line is that two of three choices were average to good with the NY Strip earning a \\"complete crap\\" rating.

We decided to stop by Union Oyster House for a couple of dozen oysters and a few beers and boy were we in for a treat! The oysters at Union are extremely fresh.. possibly the freshest I've had, ever. But although fresh, what they don't have, is variety. They only offer one kind of oysters, along with mussels and clams. We sat at the oyster bar and were able to watch the shuckers shuck away which definitely added to the experience. Be sure to order yourself a bowl of clam chowder, if that floats your boat. The chowder was creamy and thick with a perfect amount of clams and potato chunks.\\n\\nI'd have to say the only downfall was the realization of how expensive the oysters were at the end of the meal when we received our bill. HALF a dozen amounts to $14.00. Having ordered two dozen oysters, four beers and a chowder, the came to a bill of $110 including tip (way more than we planned to pay for a quick afternoon treat). I'd definitely recommend this place to diners who are willing to dish over a hefty buck."},{"name":"Mary Mac's Tea Room","address":"224 Ponce De Leon Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"This place is an Atlanta staple. When looking up places to go, this one was highly recommend. It's a big restaurant with a very sizable menu. From southern favorites like fried chicken to banana pudding. Our crew had a mix of dietary needs and it was easy to find something for everyone. I'm pescatarian and got the salmon croquet. The idea was better than the execution. The texture didn't work well and the flavor was okay. It came with two sides and I went the safe route and got mac and cheese and cheese grits. Two things any southern spot shouldn't have any issues with. The cheese grits were delicious, exactly what I hoped for. Unfortunately the mac and cheese had been sitting awhile and has developed a layer of water in the bowl it was in. Very disappointing. My friends got chicken and pork entrees and had no complaints.  The best part of the meal however was the dessert. Their banana pudding and the peanut butter pie were fantastic! I'd come back for that alone.

It's in the middle of a bunch of bars in Fanueil though, which makes going out afterwards easy.  Now it's just a problem of actually getting there that annoys me.

It has everything a pizza napoletana should.  The crust is thin, crispy, and charred on the outside with a delightfully chewy crumb.  If I hadn't had such a pizza before, I imagine it'd be revolutionary.  They do it just as well as any place I've been before, and better than most.\\n\\nSo why only three stars?  We split two pizzas, a roasted mushroom, ricotta, tomato, caper, and thyme pie (my choice), and an anchovy, gaeta olive, cherry tomato, and oregano pizza (my friend's).   The latter pizza sounds a little like deconstructed tapenade, but somehow the flavor combination struck me as a little odd.  I don't mind the white anchovies, but their flavor mixed with the warm olives made for a really eye-twitching kind of chewing experience.\\n\\nI asked and was informed that while the restaurant makes their own mozzarella, they get their ricotta from a farm up near Bryan.  I asked partially because the mushroom pizza had a great goaty tang, which I assume came from the ricotta.  It was truly great cheese.  Otherwise, the pizza was unremarkable.  The mushrooms weren't particularly flavorful at least in the context.  I pretty much had to pick them off if I wanted to really get a good taste of their umami earthiness.\\n\\nThe other reason I asked about them making their own cheese was that my water had a really strong flavor of goat cheese.  We were sitting at the bar, and by the time I actually got to drinking it, the tender was pretty busy, so I never really did get my glass changed out to determine if it was just that one.  At least half my own fault, though I think a clean glass isn't a high expectation."},{"name":"Mary Mac's Tea Room","address":"224 Ponce De Leon Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"9-27-2012\\n\\nBefore going to eat here, I wrote a friend who is a native Atlantan to ask  for a recommendation about the one place I should dine at before leaving Atlanta, and although she was not sure it was still open, she recommended Mary Mac's Tea Room.\\n\\nMy stomach still hurts from the adventure.\\n\\nThe food tasted like slop.  Don't go here.\\n\\nI ordered the cube steak, with visions of my late Southern grandmother's cooking dancing in my head.  The cube steak arrived raw.  I ate around the edges before I returned it to the server.  In an era of major outbreaks of food-borne illnesses, serving raw ground meat/beef (or whatever cube steak is made of) is completely unacceptable and a health hazard.  I could have just swallowed a vile full of ecoli, and it would have been the same.\\n\\nAfter the experience with the cube steak, I decided to play it completely safe and ordered the 4-piece fried chicken.  The batter was pretty insipid, but it was fried throughout and not raw.  So I counted myself lucky.  But it was overall very uninspired fried chicken.  I could have done better, and I do not even know how to cook.\\n\\nThe collard greens were passable. \\n\\nThe pickled beets were overly pickled -- both overly salted and overly sweet at onc and almost inedible.\\n\\nThe peach cobbler was overly sweetened and its dough was soggy.\\n\\n\\nThe bread was \\"biscuits\\" and \\"corn bread\\" in name only.  \\"Cardboard\\" may be a better description.

Sweet! They get a star for dealing with that with such great customer service and attitude. I'm not telling you this so you will try to get a gift card, mind, I'm telling you because they handled it so well. \\n\\nSo, we headed in there for brunch on a Sunday to see what we'd missed, gift card in hand. The vibe of Hall Street Grill is a little bit 70's and we have all obviously seen too much Restaurant Impossible or Kitchen Nghtmares, because we started talking about how we'd redecorate. The interior is a little dark and dull, a bunch of lighter paint and maybe getting rid of some of the outdated furnishings would help. We're not a big fan of linen tablecloths either, they're kinda annoying. \\n\\nOn top of the linen there was butcher paper on the table and crayons, so kid and I colored. Nice.( but 80's as husband pointed out). \\n\\nIt was pretty empty when we arrived at 11, sans reservations, but it filled up more by the time we left. Our server was great. I don't know her name, but she was on it with refills and requests, sweet and helpful. Just perfect service really.\\n\\nHusband had the cinnamon pancake special with bacon and a scrambled egg on the side. He ate all of it, but later noted his pancake was a little doughy in the middle. He liked the eggs, bacon, and his coffee just fine. \\n\\nBIL had \\"hangtown fry\\", an omelet with pan fried oysters and home fries. He was happy, said he liked everything. \\n\\nChild had ( from a great kid's menu, BTW, with lots of choices) chocolate milk, french toast with home fries, and a side of candied bacon. The bacon was ridiculous, coated in caramelly goodness. She didn't finish her food, but she was full and happy with everything, proclaiming it delicious. \\n\\nMy breakfast, smoked salmon on sage-Parmesan biscuits, with hollandaise and poached eggs and home fries, was very rich, filling, and kinda heavy. I did like it, but I couldn't finish it. I thought the biscuits were a bit overworked  ( Pine State and their perfect fluffy biscuits has spoiled me I fear) and a little too brown on the bottom, but I dug the Parmesan sage vibe and the poached eggs were perfect. They did the exact runny yolk thing they were supposed to do, which made me totally happy. The hollandaise wasn't too bad, I liked it too.There were onions and arugula that didn't add anything to the dish really, but I ate them anyway. The home fries, cooked with onion and red bells, were fine.Husband thought they were a little salty. I thought they were tasty. \\n\\nChild wanted to know why there were onions in a kid's potatoes, claiming most kids don't eat onions. This was debated with no resolution by the group. I do admit none of her little friends like onions either, but perhaps there are kids out there who don't mind them? \\n\\nAll in all, a very successful brunch. I think we would go back.

The first time was in 2006 for my sister's engagement dinner, the second time was last year for my 25th birthday, and this past Saturday for my sister's 30th. The first time may be my favorite because it was a new experience, but there was also crazy lightning that night and being so high up the lightning was close enough I felt like I could reach out and touch it.\\n\\nAnyways, the most recent:\\n\\nWe arrived shortly before our 6:00 reservation, and there was quite the crowd, which made me a little nervous, but it seemed most people were waiting for a spot at the bar because once we checked our coats we were seated right away. I was so happy there was a table big enough for five right up against the glass as opposed to sitting more in the middle of the dining room as we had the previous times: each of us had a clear view of the city.\\n\\nOur waiter came over, was very friendly and took our drink orders. We were promptly served, ordered regular water as opposed to bottled still water and listened to the specials. The chef that night was making a special aperitif, some kind of a butternut squash and honey concoction that I was skeptical of but was incredible. I would have ordered a bowl of it if I could. \\n\\nFirst negative: the sommelier dripped wine down my glass. It was pretty noticeable; the least he could have done was take the glass and wipe it. The wine was good, and an easy recommendation (Barbera D'Asti) for $40. I buy it locally all the time (for $14 but that's just how markups in restaurants work). \\n\\nOur appetizers: there was clam chowder (always delicious), spicy lobster soup (which received four thumbs up from my father and my brother in law) and vegetable tempura, a special that night. \\n\\nDinner arrived nicely paced after our appetizers and, again, was delicious. My tenderloin beef was tasty and the sides of garlic whipped potato and chimichurri were great. The portions are small when compared to Morton's and other restaurants, but the prices are more reasonable and really, are perfectly adequate.\\n\\nNegative number two came as they cleared our dinner plates. A busboy was behind me and taking things off the table. I felt something hit my right arm, but assumed I was in the way of his clearing, so didn't think anything of it. Ten minutes later my mother, sitting to my right, exclaimed in horror about \\"What is on your arm!\\" Turns out that the bump was the butter dish and the butter they serve with the (really delicious) bread. As it had been a couple hours, the butter was, naturally, melted, and was spread all over the sleeve of my new suit (see my review of Frank's Tailoring). \\n\\nShe wiped it off as best she could with her napkin but there was a noticeable stain. I took it stride but my father was really upset and brought it to our waiter's attention when he came to see how our meals were. He apologized profusely and sent a manager over. She asked what had happened, gave me her card and said that Top of the Hub would pick up the tab for my dry cleaning and comp dessert. She apologized repeatedly. The situation wasn't as catastrophic as my family was making it out to be because accidents happen, but what did bother me was the busboy must have seen what he did and didn't say anything or apologize. Did he think no one would ever notice?\\n\\nDessert was delicious (and free), I ordered the warm chocolate cake, and the evening ended on a high note. The waiter apologized to me personally that it had happened as we were leaving.\\n\\nI give it 4 stars for a couple of reasons.\\n\\nFirst the sommelier incident which isn't much of a big deal but is just something you don't expect at a restaurant like Top of the Hub.\\n\\nSecond is the butter incident.\\n\\nThird, their beer list is really....dismal. Our waiter actually apologized to me when I asked \\"What Belgians do you have?\\" and he sheepishly answered, \\"None\\". He and I laughed as he recited the list of imports, which was Stella Artois (great) Heineken (OK) and Amstel Light (really?) I was pining for a Duvel or Chimay or something, but the Stella was fresh and is always tasty.\\n\\nPeople say \\"you pay for the view\\" and, sure, you do, but the food has always been good each of the times I've been, and for the view you're actually paying less than you would for a meal at Morton's which is in a (nicely decorated) basement. This past time there were lots of pictures being taken, of which we were also guilty and which embarrasses me, but it's a great place for special occasions and special occasions sometimes demand photos.\\n\\nI'm planning to go back for a smaller-scale evening in January, and bought a gift card for my aunt and uncle as a combination Christmas, Birthday, Anniversary gift, so I have no trouble recommending it.\\n\\nWith an appetizer, entree and dessert expect to pay about $65 per person, then add on drinks / wine, which ranges from $35 to over $500 per bottle.

Hubby, Mother-in-Law and I were trying to agree on something for lunch.  We were in the mood for something a little different, so Antioquena seemed like a great choice.  It's a smaller, family owned business that serves Colombian food.  We were seated right away, and handed menus.  None of us have ever had the pleasure of trying Colombian food, so we essentially knew nothing about it.  I am Peruvian, so I was able to figure out what some of the menu items were (the cuisines have a couple similarities), but I was honestly expecting our waitress to ask if we had been there before or had any questions about the food.  Instead she asked us if we were ready to order even though she literally just handed us the menu.  We politely said we would need a couple more minutes.  About 30 seconds later, she was back again asking if we were ready to order.  We pretty much just randomly picked a couple things to share since we were being rushed.  I was nervous after the not so lovely service we stared out with, but really, after that the waitress ended up being pleasant enough.  For food, we split:\\n\\nBandeja Paisa\\nSkirt steak topped with a fried egg, sausage, chicharron, rice, beans, plantains, avocado and a corn cake.  O..M..G!! This plate was the bomb.com!  Whatever seasoning they had on the steak was perfectly flavorful, and it was nice and tender.  The sausage was just as good...I'd never tasted one like it before.  And then there was the amazing tid bit known as the chicharron...holy cow was that thing good!  Super crispy, yet melted in your mouth at the same time.  It was my favorite bite on the plate.\\n\\nPollo Encebollado \\nSauteed chicken w/ onions and peppers, served with tostones, avocado and a side salad.\\nIt was pretty good, but all three of us preferred the other dish slightly more.\\n\\nBesides the slight hiccup we had with service at first, everything ended up great.

Maybe a burger and tots won't rub you the WRONG way, but they're never that good. Pizza comes from a different kitchen and arrives at a different time. They do the best they can, but it still sucks. I had braised pork shoulder tonight and it was dry and fatty. Husbands fish and chips was bad. Fries were undercooked and dripping grease and fish breading was so crispy is cracked. Since they do so many functions, a lot of things are prepared in mass quantity, such as mashed potatoes, and ALWAYS fall short of what you hope/expect. You can tell this because they literally use an ice cream scoop to serve and plate the potatoes. (At least add some butter and chives to order to spice it up!).  \\n\\n3. The service is adequate. But if there is any sort of issue, drop it down a grade. Tonight, we were clearly unhappy and our server dismissed us and was scarce the rest of the time.

I figured it would come with fries or something, but it said nothing about fries, there are no fries on the menu, and there are a la carte sides next to it on the menu, so I thought, okay, (expensive) a la carte sandwich.  Both my friend and I ordered sides of onion rings to go with our sandwiches.  Not only did the waitress fail to tell us that the lobster rolls indeed DO come with fries, she also neglected to tell us that ONE order of onion rings is enough for at least 4 people.  So we ended up with ridiculous amounts of food (I mean SERIOUSLY ridiculous amounts of food), none of which was cheap to begin with.  I realize it's in her interest to rack up the total, but this was just lack of thoughtfulness or courtesy.  I honestly think she didn't even think about it.  It really should have been obvious to her that this would be too much food, and she really should have warned us.  I don't enjoy dropping almost $50 for a bunch of food I can't even eat (we couldn't take leftovers with us because we weren't going home right away, and our hotel rooms didn't have fridges anyway).  \\n\\nJust in general, our waitress was really goofy and scattered.

So, not to go against the owner's recommendations, I set out for a bottle of wine and returned.  I made a joke that I didn't know what I would do with the whole bottle, since it was just me, and the waiter assured me that he would save the cork and the bag, and that he would be happy to package it up for me.  Hmmm...really nice!  The owner came and made his recommendations, and since this was my first go at Bangladeshi food, I complied.  I started with a lentil soup that came with lime...spicy and delicious!  My entree was \\"#24\\" with lamb and the special rice (Basmati rice with peas, onions, and raisins).  Wow.  Phenomenal.  The dish that I ordered had lamb, spinach, and some of their homemade cheese.  It was creamy and rich, but not heavy.  Spiced, but not spicy.  All of the flavors complemented each other perfectly!  As if I needed another reason to love this place, they make all of their own sauces, yogurts, and cheese.  The owner informed me that they don't purchase any processed foods...they just make everything from scratch.  Alright, so at this point, I am borderline depressed because there was a tiny bit of food that my enormous stomach could not hold.  The owner talked me in to a homemade yogurt sweetened with honey for dessert (not on the menu) and told me that it would help with my full feeling.  As was expected...incredible (and I don't know if I was just blinded by love, but it really did seem to make me feel better).  To top it all off, because I was a new customer, the waiter brought me a 25% off discount coupon to be used between now and the end of February, UNLIMITED times Tuesday - Thursday.  ? Really?!?!  I love this place!  Amazing service (I had 3 waiters), unbelievable food, and I left with an $18 bill for appetizer, entree, & dessert.  I would have paid $40 for my meal...but the fact that I didn't have to made me respect the establishment even more!"},{"name":"Hair of the Dog Brewery and Tasting Room","address":"61 SE Yamhill St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Great beer, but really awful service.

The crust is probably my favorite part... crisp on the outside yet still chewy with  great flavor to boot. The sauce tasted fresh and lived up to the description on the website. Not too acidic like some places, just perfectly spiced and tasty. The mozzarella was also fresh, delicious, and clearly high quality. I couldn't taste a ton of the garlic but it was definitely there... I like more garlic than most people could tolerate so that's what I chalk it up to.The sausage was different; it was tasty but different than your average sausage found on pizza. It gave the pizza it's own originality that was kind of a nice change of pace. This place claims to use high quality and fresh ingredients.

The place was packed for sure. We didn't get the most romantic of tables. In fact, and thankfully they left not too long after we got there, we were seated very near a couple (the gentleman a very recent graduate of Le Cordon Bleu) with some sort of thick northern accents. They evidently thought the chef needed some tips so they had the GM brought over and proceeded to dissect each part of the meal for her, describing in detail what was wrong with their entrees. She graciously thanked them and the server took their desserts off their bill (I told you, we were seated close). They said things to the GM like \\"We're just trying to help you make this place better. We want to really like it here. Most of the people here probably wouldn't know any better, but people like me and her (gesturing to his companion) - we do.\\" \\n\\nAnd then they discussed how much they were helping amongst themselves and I counted at least 5 F-bombs. Class acts. \\n\\nAnyways, they left and a very quiet nice couple sat down. But onto our food.....We started with the calamari and the fried green tomatoes. The FGT were topped with shrimp and avacado and celery - it reminded me of a shrimp po boy. I'd give it 3 out of 5 noms. The calamari though? I'd eat that every day. It was drizzled in a sweet chili sauce, similar to what you'd dip spring rolls in at a Thai restaurant. Loved that. \\n\\nL ordered the scallops over gouda grits and I got the brisket empanadas with a side of the NY mac and cheese. We agreed I won with the empanadas but hers was very good too.

I came close when I discovered Chris' Little Chicago on South Lamar, but the environs (an overgrown field, which is both hellaciously hot and high on the allergen and bug factor this time of year) left something to be desired. Plus, I think Chicago dogs are best eaten with waffle fries, and Chris' Little Chicago serves theirs with seasoned fries.\\n\\nSo I was cautiously optimistic when I started seeing very positive buzz on Yelp and elsewhere about the aptly-named Frank. Frank's tagline, \\"Purveyors of Artisan Sausage,\\" hints at its upscale-ish nature, but happily, it doesn't take itself too seriously. The space is attractive, yet casual, and the pricing is surprisingly good considering its high-rent 4th and Colorado location - a Chicago dog runs just $3.75 and a small order of waffle fries is $2.50. Of course, you could easily exceed your food bill with a single drink from their awesome cocktail menu, but having that option available to you just adds to the experience, in my opinion.\\n\\nI arrived at Frank right during the busiest part of the lunch hour on a Friday. There were people waiting for tables, but the bar is first come, first serve, and I was able to immediately snag a seat there. There were two bartenders working; both were super friendly and attentive - as well as being noticeably inked - which lent the service a \\"cool-but-not-too-cool-for-you\\" vibe.\\n\\nIn addition to a more predictable range of dogs - the obligatory chili cheese dog, a plain dog, the Chicago dog, a beer soaked brat - there are a couple of more interesting offerings on the menu. For example, the Jackalope ($7.00) begins with an antelope and rabbit sausage and is served with huckleberry compote, sriracha aioli, and applewood smoked cheddar. Or, you could spice up a more run-of-the-mill dog by making it into a Frank Flapjacket - wrap it in corn batter and load it up like a bun. Better yet, you can \\"Pork It\\" by splitting it, stuffing it with white American cheese, wrapping it with bacon, and deep frying it. Because hot dogs aren't bad enough for you already.\\n\\nFor vegetarians, anything on the menu can be made with a veggie dog. They even offer veggie chili and a portobello cheesesteak.\\n\\nAfter grappling with the menu and my taste buds a bit, I finally decided to try a Chicago dog so I could have an apples-to-apples point of comparison. It arrived quickly (along with the side of waffle fries I just had to get).\\n\\nI'd say the Chicago dog is roughly comparable to the ones at Chris' Little Chicago. Delicious, to be sure, but not the best I've ever had. I thought the bun was a little on the soft side, and the dog itself was ever-so-slightly less firm than I like. Also, I don't think Frank's chefs quite have the knack for building a Chicago dog, which is an art unto itself. It is KEY that you wedge the larger toppings (the tomato, sport peppers, and especially the pickle) down into the cracks between the dog and the bun; otherwise, they have a tendency to fly everywhere when you bite into your dog. This was not done at all at Frank, so eating this dog was a bit of a mess.  Despite these minor issues, however, the dog was great flavor-wise.\\n\\nThe waffle fries were perfect. Crisp and hot, and they come with your choice of interesting dipping sauces (ketchup, mayo, peanut sauce, buffalo bleu sauce, punchy sauce, and horseradish sauce).

We were informed that there was a special event starting at 1:30, and would that be a problem for us - no it would not. We ordered and got our food, not feeling rushed at all. But then after our plates were cleared at 1pm, we were brought the check without an offer of desert. This was disappointing. I felt that they would have had plenty of time to provide this. We didn't make a fuss about it, but I felt like they just wanted us out so we obliged. Next time I would make a point of saying something.  Then later, I looked at the check and noticed we got charged for 3 large glasses of orange juice for $13.50.  Only 1 person got a full glass, and the other 2 asked for 1/2 or less.

You can easily see what a labor of love this is for everyone involved!\\n\\nThe concept is \\"International BBQ\\". On their initial, soft opening limited menu (not really that limited) are traditional choices like the pulled pork sandwich, Brunswick stew, mac & cheese and collards. The kicker is the addition of unexpected goodies like kale, spicy hush puppies, and a cuban sandwich. \\n\\nSauces include Memphis sweet (but not too and my fav), NC hot (vinegar based & not too hot)  Kansas City medium (smoky). \\n\\nI couldn't resist trying the cuban, which was not the traditional version but more of a panini. It included the required yellow mustard, was a reasonable size and quite good. \\n\\nSandwiches come with 1 side so I HAD to try the Mac and Cheese. No Velveeta here! It was very similar to what Mom made.  I also couldn't resist the kale, which had perhaps a touch of one of the sauces in the broth. Very tasty. \\n\\nHubby had the pulled pork sandwich, collards and Brunswick stew. The collards were prepared and spiced in the traditional way. Brunswick stew had a vinegar kick. The pulled pork sandwich was well prepared and very generous. \\n\\nUnlike many new restaurants, this one opened with its liquor license and so offers a good selection of wine and beer. On tap were 3 Sweetwaters: (420, Sweet Ga Brown and  Seasonal) and 3 Terrapins (Rye, Hopsecutioner and a seasonal). In bottles are Miller, PBR and Newcastle. They also offer the Guinness pub draught. \\n\\nAlso unlike many new restaurants, this one seems to be operationally in order. While a little chaos is to be expected in the very early days, here it was all hands on deck and all hands were busy and engaged. This is a good sign that they'll be ready for the crush of hungry Decaturites!\\n\\nWhat might be improved? I hope to see a dinner-sized salad on the full menu. The tea was weak--especially with ice.

Yep, no rush.  No surprise here, as Santouka is most definitely a found spot, with ramen being a hot dish of our current era.\\n\\nI had read that Santouka had recently added to their menu.  I figure that their combo offering was also a recent development.  I was all gung-ho on getting one of their combos which came with a size small of ramen, a soft boiled egg, and a choice of 2 appetizers or 2 rice bowls.  But when it came my turn to place my order, I suddenly noticed the words that tore apart my dream: \\"choose a soup flavor from\\" and only their 4 regular menu choices were listed.  Would they kindly consider substituting their Summer Special goma miso ramen, perhaps for a surcharge?  No.  *sniff*  Sadness.\\n\\nMy DC kindly offered to let me try his combo Cha-Shu Gohan (rice bowl topped with cha-shu).  Ultimately, given the taste and portion, I'm glad I didn't opt to order this myself at the a la carte price of $6.  The ground meat sauce rice at Taiwan Cafe is much tastier and for a more reasonable price point.\\n\\nMy ramen was fine with nice bouncy noodles, but not particularly outstanding in any way.  We did discover though the difference between the small, regular, and large bowls of ramen in terms of meat - the small had one slice of fatty pork, the regular 2, and the large 3.\\n\\nThe best bite of the evening, however, was the Takoyaki $5 fried ball-shaped Japanese snack with a bit of octopus inside; served with sweet sauce and sprinkle of nori & katsuobushi.  One order yielded five soft balls peppered with chewy pieces of octopus, each bite both sweet and savory.\\n\\n*** 2/2017 ***\\n\\nI couldn't resist order the TORONIKU PAO ZI (Steamed bun filled with sliced tender toroniku seasoned with sweet miso, onion puree and cilantro.)  Its appearance lacked that wow factor, as the slice of pork tucked in the bao was rather thin, though it was truly tender.  The steamed bun bundle was yummy thought a bit oversauced, and came sliced in half which encouraged sharing.\\n\\nThe GYOZA (Pork & chicken pot stickers) arrives as 5 pieces as an appetizer, but 4 pieces as a part of a combo.  The skin was thin and delicate.  The meat tender and tasty.\\n\\nI ordered the small TONKOTSU SHIO RAMEN (Our signature ramen; silky tonkotsu broth enhanced with simple salt flavor) in a combo with the SHIYAKE IKURA GOHAN (Rice bowl topped with grilled salmon & salmon roe) and an AJI-TAMA* (marinated soft boiled egg) $16.50. The fish eggs added to the flavor of the salmon rice.  It was a satisfying, meal for a chilly winter's night.\\n\\nFor dessert, they offer mochi ice cream bonbons in a choice of seven flavors for $4.25.

We tried a number of dishes and had an excellent meal. The food and menu is great! We had:\\n\\n-Beef Tartar- I've never been a fan of beef tartar because of the texture, but this had a very unique, more fine texture and was definitely the best beef tartar i've had. The runny egg complimented it perfectly. The whole table raved about this dish. It was refreshing.\\n\\n-Yellowfin tuna crudo- Very flavorful. The saltiness of the sesame and garlic was well balanced by the grapefruit. \\n\\n-Devilled eggs- I've never had deviled eggs like this before. They were soft boiled and I wouldn't actually consider them to be traditional devilled eggs, but whatever they were, they were delicious. The chefs here definitely know their way around an egg!\\n\\n-Charred Octopus- One of the house specialities that I was especially looking forward to. It was good but the charred flavoring was a bit overwhelming and sort of overtook the whole dish. The smoked potatoes were amazing though. \\n\\n-Semolina Begoli- My friend and I shared this as part of our main course and we loved it. It's a thick spaghetti-like pasta dish in a flavorful creamy (but not overly heavy) sauce. My only complaint here is that this was supposed to have snails in it and ours definitely had mussels instead. Maybe they ran out of the snails but nobody informed us and we were a bit disappointed since we've had mussels and pasta many times and were excited to try something different. \\n\\n-Chicken fried sweetbreads- My friend and I also shared this and loved it. The crispy texture of the breading was perfectly balanced by the tender sweetbreads. Good portion size too and I would definitely recommend this dish for a table to share. \\n\\nThe service had a few glitches which is understandable considering that it was the third night. Our waitress definitely knew the menu very well and was able to describe everything well and make recommendations. Towards the end we felt like she abandoned us a bit though. Also, when our check came, there was a round of drinks we were charged for that was not ours. The manager was apologetic and fixed it, but it took quite a bit of time to fix the situation, and we were really happy we checked the bill!\\n\\nThe ambiance is very modern and open so if you're looking for something warm and cozy, this is far from it. The large open space is a little strange, especially when it's not full. I'd love to go back and sit at the bar that looks into the kitchen.

She made reservations and that was very helpful, as parking is limited, but valet is reasonably priced and the wait time was not long, even with reservations. While waiting, I ordered a beverage from the bar, and Cody was extremely helpful, pleasant and provided all of the disclaimers upfront, as it pertains to asking about food allergies, likes and dislikes to other patrons at the bar eating. Our reservations were for 3, and we indicated it would only be 2 as my friend thought she couldn't make it; however, she surprised us and showed up to the restaurant anyway, and the host (Manager, Michael (I believe) scurried over to our table and said, \\"you told me there would only be 2\\",  and I said well I didn't know she would show up, and he seemed annoyed, although we had not ordered and had a table for four. Hmm, so you are bothered to have additional patrons. Fast forward, I ordered the lobster friend rice and waffles, which my friend indicated is a signature best dish for the establishment. However, my lobster dish was extremely, extremely spicy and I informed my server that I did not like the dish because it was so spicy. The server said, let me get my manager, and when he came to the table to address my concern, it was by far - condescending. The manager says to me immediately upon arriving to the table, \\"we don't return food, and umm, I don't know what to say to you\\", hunched his shoulders, and basically said, \\"you will have to pay for this dish\\" as if I was asking for something free. I replied, the dish is extremely spicy, manager reply, \\" we don't take food back because it's spicy, I said, \\"but I cannot eat that, it does not mesh with my taste.\\" I told the manager, I can pay for my dish, that is not a problem, and he basically dismissed me at this point. My friend, said, can she get something else, his response, \\"the kitchen is closed, and we don't take back food\\", and offered no other alternatives, or even to remake the same entr√©e. I was floored, and disgusted at the same time. While you may have a disclaimer on your menu, then your servers should inform patrons ordering certain dishes about the dish or ask questions, such as I observed Cody do at the bar. The manager, was basically RUDE, then told me, Calvin is the owner and he is in the kitchen, I am the manager, and I listen to everything and I run what is out front. Okay, but I did not ask you that, and you are telling me that for what purpose. Anyway, I would say, if visiting, be sure to ask lots of questions before ordering because the \\"manager out front\\" will tell you oh well, and the servers are not trained to provide you with enough information up front about the dish you may be considering ordering. I was really disappointed and offended with the approach and tone used by the manager.  The delivery was so appalling from the manager, the server even apologized to me, stating, that the manager can come off a bit harsh, and naturally that is not well receiving by patrons. I wasn't trying to get free food, sorry, you had that judgement about your patrons, but the least you could have offered, was to remake the dish for me at the least - perhaps with the chef not having a slip of the wrist by preparing the dish extra spicy. Oh yeah, he told me the kitchen was closed, but dishes were still coming out after he said that to me. When I inquired, and asked him about it, he told me the food was prepared for the staff working that day. Okay manager - fine! Continue to be rude.

Quicker then I could blink I was served the spring rolls but no sauce to dip them in so I had to request some from my server. The spring rolls were plated very nicely but most of them were warm and best and soggy. We were served the pho but to our dismay the salad rolls had not shown up. I was excited to try my pho because I heard it was a great place and as soon as I dug in I realized my broth just tasted like water... I searched for something to add to it from the table I realize there is no hoisin sauce so I ask my server for one as she turns over to the table next to us a practically grabs it from their hands, then we made a comment that the salad rolls had not shown up when the server yells at the kitchen loudly for an order of salad rolls, I see them serve two other tables their orders of salad rolls yet ours never came. The pho was filling so we chose not to bother asking for them again. All in all my pho was watery and had tons of noodles which may be a plus for some but limited vegetables and tofu. As we went to pay out bill they tried to charge us for the salad rolls and without an apology or acknowledgment for the mistake removed the charge. Needless to say will not be returning.

When I'm here, I usually settle for the crab cakes, which also are pretty tasty. (Though the menu states, if I remember correctly, that they're not 100% composed of real crab meat.) Still, I enjoy them.\\n\\nThe staff is very friendly and the place has a really cool vibe going on.

One of my friend's recommended the Top of the Hub as a must-do. I needed a fancy birthday dinner place anyways, so sure, why not. Reservations, done.\\n\\nFirst of all, I'm really glad I read some Yelp reviews before we went, because I wouldn't have known that you need to go through a mall in order to get to these elevators with a front desk that seems to only lead to offices instead of an observation deck and a restaurant. Why so hidden, Boston? Last chance to sell me souvenirs before I go? Well, it worked. I bought a plate at a souvenir store on my way to dinner. Are you happy?\\n\\nWe got up there, and I understood why my friend recommended this place. This place is 52 stories high (higher than the observation deck) with almost a 360 view of the city of Boston. Absolutely beautiful. Even with our reservations, we still had a 10 minutes wait, and when it was time, the hostess seated us at this little table that was really far away from the windows. \\n\\nOh, heck no. \\n\\nMy husband is going to have that amazing view with this dinner. It's his birthday, gosh darn it! I'm usually very easy going and don't complain, but I definitely flagged the hostess down and told her it was his birthday and I wanted a window seat. I think she copped a little bit of an attitude with me (probably b/c everyone demands a window seat) and told me it would be an additional 45 mins wait. Whatevers, I'm waiting. So we went back to the bar area, which had a really nice view, and enjoyed a cocktail. 30 minutes later, the hostess came back to us and led us to our table with a view, and she seemed much nicer this time. Maybe I just caught her at a bad time in the beginning, maybe bc I was already a bit buzzed, I don't know.\\n\\nI saw foie gras on the menu and jumped at the chance to order it (it's banned in California, and I'm sorry ducks, but I love foie gras). My husband had a lamb chop, I had a steak. I was on my second mojito. Balance was restored. \\n\\nTo be honest, the food was mediocre. I know my foie gras was just okay when I offered to give some to my husband, and I never share my foie gras. No, it can't be because I love him. I can't say I had a good meal, but the view was memorable.\\n\\nI would still recommend this place to any of my friends who decide to visit Boston, but probably just for drinks to soak in that amazing Boston view, without the mediocre food. All 3 stars go to the view."},{"name":"The Optimist","address":"914 Howell Mill Rd","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Did someone say seafood? Yeah I thought so. I have to be in the mood. It's taken me this long to be in the mood to try this extremely popular somewhat new addition to the fantastic food scene in West Midtown. \\n\\nThis is a large freestanding single level building. The ceilings are high and unbuffered so be prepared for energetic noise and don't go with people you want to have some serious conversation with. Go with people that want good food and enjoy the vibe.  There are a very few non seafood dishes for your friends who don't like the bounty of the sea.  Lots of attractive people at the tables and bars both.\\n\\nThere are two bars. The entry area bar is limited (ie no craft cocktails but they have their own thing going on so be open to it). Naturally raw oysters are there to be had. Save room for the creative menu awaiting in the dining room.\\n\\nIt bears noting the rolls brought to the table are an item that should be sold as a side order.  Semi dense yeast rolls with a sprinkle of crunchy flake salt on top.  Heck I'd like some with today's afternoon tea. Do you do take out orders, Optimist?\\n\\nMy kryptonite, fried oysters, are on the menu. Unfortunately for the other starter items the oysters put temporary food blinders on me so you don't stand a chance.  Smoked fish chowder came to the table too. The oysters were cormealy crunchy, not greasy but also not seasoned. I found myself looking for salt more than once even though I knew it wouldn't be on the table. The soup however had a wonderful delicate distinct flavor. A light chowder that is perfectly satisfying.\\n\\nDinner entrees selected were striped bass with a fantastically citrusy lime broth. Herbacious and fresh is the best way to describe it. Duck fat poached swordfish caught my eye. A rather ballsy thing to do but hey why not poach your fish in duckfat? It need not be relegated to roasting potatoes only. (My jar of duck fat in the fridge needs to step its workload up now).  My history of swordfish eating is not a pleasant one. It's ALWAYS been dry, flavorless and honestly just forgettable and certainly not worth the mercury intake.  This dish was as if an imposter fish was in place of what I knew swordfish to be.  A 2\\" thick  piece of lush moist flesh that was cooked to a perfection I have not experienced before (nor expect I will again).  Not even a whisper of gaminess that sometimes comes when duck fat joins to the party. I was impressed.\\n\\nI saw my beloved vegetable, beets, on the side menu and instantly ordered them along with the hushpuppies - beignet style!? what? sugar cane butter on the side too ?  Oh heck yes. This is fantastically naughty.  It hits your sweet salty addiction perfectly. The beets were small, cooked nicely and served chilled. I find chilled beets the best at showing off the sweetness while keeping the earthiness to a minimum. Another win for my tastebuds.\\n\\nPerfect service. Not too much, not to little. Just right.\\n\\nThere is no mystery why the Optimist is so popular. Definitely returning, though I may bring a pinch of salt with me next time to better enjoy my oysters."},{"name":"Folk Art Restaurant","address":"465 N Highland Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"2nd time here and forgot to leave a great review after first visit, probably because we were still in awe at how great the food, service and atmosphere.

Like so many married couples, my wife and I tend to fall into the same routine. We often hit a restaurant close to home and maybe a movie. But not having the kids for the weekend made us want to dress up and go out, maybe listen to a little music and have a great meal with skyline views. After pouring over many Yelp reviews, we decided to give Two Urban Licks a try. We could not have asked for a better night.\\n\\nWe arrived about a half hour earlier than our reservations and were pleased to be seated right away. I kept falling behind the host as we were guided to our table because my attention continued to be captured by the decor. Everything just made me want to stop and study it, from the cool metal wine barrel display near the bar, to the comfy looking seating w/huge pillows in the booth areas , to the exotic flower arrangements illuminated throughout. There was energy from the moment you walked in the door and it never seemed to let up, as lively conversations were going on throughout the restaurant (some very loud...lol)!!! The noise level here for conversation is well above average, so if you want a little more quiet, consider the outdoor seating on the back patio. Our table was just inside the garage door partition that separates the inside from the outdoor area, so we were able to have the best of both settings. Beautifully lit with glass blown oval posts on the outside and a view of the skyline in the distance made for a romantic evening. \\n\\nOur waiter was prompt and thoughtful as he checked on us often and ALWAYS had a refill in his hand. The band was playing, although our seating location in the room made it difficult to hear them, but we didn't care. We met a great couple seated next to us and had fantastic conversation all night. It wasn't a particularly  special night. No Birthday,  Anniversary or celebration of any kind... but it sure felt special to us. So we decided to order a bit more than usual:\\n\\nCALAMARI  - One of my favorite seafoods. I will order this almost 100% of the time if it's available on a menu and this was the BEST I've ever had!!! Perfectly cooked and flavorful rings with a sweet sauce drizzled over them made this dish a Home Run hit out of the park.\\n\\nSALMON CHIPS - Creative appetizer and full of flaky pink Salmon. Even my wife enjoyed it and she's not big on fish.\\n\\nFRIED TOMATOES - Usually something your Grandma would make, but Grannie never made 'em like this... WOW!!!! We were literally fighting over the last bite until I remembered I was on a date and there are no kids at home when we get back (wink)!!! \\"Here honey, I want you to enjoy the last bite.\\"\\n\\nCHICKPEA FRITTERS - Something my wife ordered to satisfy her lack of craving for meat turned out to be one of my favorite tasties of the evening. Who new something without meat could taste this dang good!!! They were a bit spicy for our pallets, but not overwhelming. Will likely order this every time.\\n\\nGLASS of Late Harvest WINE - Hoping to get her liquored up while I did some fast designated driving home. The wine was delicious, but not exactly worth the $12 charge for what was probably about 4 oz.\\n\\nSCALLOPS - Are brought to you medium and I really enjoyed them, but would probably have preferred them cooked medium well to well done. I like to have a crunchier sear on the outside. The Gouda grits were seriously awesome. I've never had grits outside of breakfast and was a bit skeptical, but I am now a believer. \\n\\nCARROT CAKE - it was everything I hoped for (this is one of my favorite types of cake). But what sent this dish over the top for me was the home made ice cream that accompanied it. The menu describes it as cream cheese ice cream but it tasted more like egg nog. AMAZING!!!\\n\\nAfter this meal, my wife and I decided we don't come to Atlanta enough. We travel all over the country & Caribbean to eat & play, but are going to make hometown dining a priority from here on out. I could kick myself for what we've been missing and can't wait to show out of town guest our new find!!! Easily my NEW favorite restaurant and looking forward to many more visits.

Bringing Southern Cuisine to the masses, both familiar and the uninitiated since 1945 when Atlanta was still just a medium sized Southern Town with a population of around 320,000.\\n\\nThis place has been on my radar for a number of years now and we have tried to visit on some of our trips to visit the Grandkids up in Marietta.

They were out and it was only a few minutes after noon. He ended up settling for the Chicken Pot Pie along with Fried Green Tomatoes and Potato Salad.\\n\\nI had the Meat Loaf, Fried Okra and also had the Potato Salad.\\n\\nThe Potato Salad was not what I expected and it was a disappointment. I like potato salad with a mayonnaise dressing and a hint of mustard and just a bit of pickle relish to give a texture contrast.  This Potato Salad was so overloaded with Mustard that was all you could taste with the exception of way too much Pickle Relish.  Those two items were all you could taste.\\n\\nMy wife ordered the Salmon Croquettes with Creamed Corn and Fried Okra and loved it.  Pittsburgh Girl finally eating like a Southerner and it's only taken 22 years. \\n\\nAt the end, she also ordered a Peach Cobbler to go so that she could have a midnight snack. Loved the Cobbler as well.\\n\\nI enjoyed Mary Mac's as did the rest of our party. With the exception of not having the Chicken and Dumplings and Potato Salad that was not what I expected, it was a great lunch.\\n\\nThe setting is very nice and reminds me of some of the older restaurants I grew up with back in the 1960's back in Asheville before the era of cookie cutter restaurants where each room was unique.\\n\\nService was very good and we will be back and next time we will take my other Son and  his family.

The wait for seating was long, and the atmosphere was casual, young, and festive. \\n\\nWe started off with the Ableskiver ($10), which is the Swedish version of pancakes that were served in an iron skillet with sides of lemon curd and lingonberry jam. Shaped like enlarged donut holes, each Ableskiver was easy to cut into from the slightly firm exterior to the soft and fluffy center. The lemon curd and lingonberry jam each rendered a refined airy sour and sweet flavors, so these pancakes were a complete hit. Highly recommend it, I wished I had the appetite to go for a repeat.\\n\\nMy Pytt I Panna with Smoked Trout ($13) baked in an iron skillet filled with cube potatoes cooked with onions, peppers, and smoked trout. The hash was then topped with two sunny side up eggs and pickled beets. Except for the lack of trout, the rest of the hash was delicious, hearty, and filled with good textures.

To give more information on how completely underwhelming this dish was would be pointless, so suffice it to say, ordering the meatball sub is an act that is of potential culinary detriment to the customer's senses and definitely an assault to the customer's finances. \\n\\nI can not recommend this restaurant."},{"name":"The Optimist","address":"914 Howell Mill Rd","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"I went there with a few friends on Saturday evening, and it was very busy.

We had the Spanish octopus as appetizer, not bad, likely our most favorite dish of the evening. I ordered the lobster roll as main, taste good, and I really enjoyed the bread. We were not super happy with the service because our waiter kept asking us to order something in every few mins, i.e when we were eating the seafood platter and the starter, we were asked to order the main a few times.

I liked to come for the goat curry, goat biryani, and rice pudding especially. All of a sudden, even on the weekend (which costs $13 a person), they never have any goat dishes. Everything has been replaced with chicken breast. No more shrimp either. Once the rice pudding was served with the consistency of water. Now no rice pudding is offered. Instead, some melted and bad tasting Oreo ice cream is on the buffet line. \\nThey used to bring naan to your table in a basket - now it's on the buffet line and distinctly older tasting. \\nWorst of all the service is bad now. There's one guy playing waiter to the whole restaurant and running the cash register himself. It can take 20 minutes just to get a glass of water. My last visit I ordered soda and was given water anyway. The soda never appeared. \\nI can't justify coming here anymore considering Hyderabad is pretty close by. The mother restaurant Flavors of India in Cocoa is still doing fine. Plus, their rice pudding has always been divine. \\nMalabar's cost cutting will be their demise.

She was apologetic and assured me that they would use my feedback for staff training and to better serve their patrons. I really appreciate when an establishment follows up on reviews, both critical and praise-worthy.\\n\\nOn to our experience...\\n\\nCame here for Father's Day. After taking our stroller to enough restaurants, I made a point to bring it to the hostess' attention so that we could be seated in an area with enough space. She asked if our daughter, who was in her stroller, was in the headcount for our reservation, a party of 4, to which I responded that she was not. After a deep sigh and eye roll from the hostess, we waited about 10 mins to be seated. My thoughts? It's Father's Day. Why would you have an attitude about a father bringing his 3 month old daughter to brunch in a stroller on Father's Day? The restaurant was crowded, and there were other strollers throughout, as one would expect... especially on Father's Day. Thankfully, the gentleman who seated us, was warm and very nice, so I was optimistic that the hostess had not set the tone for what was to come of our dining experience.\\n\\nOur waiter was cordial, but he could only answer one of our questions about the menu without asking someone else. He knew how many deviled eggs would come with the order (2 eggs, halved for $6), but didn't know what cut of steak was in steak and eggs (it was skirt steak, $19) or what Teeling was (Irish whiskey) in one of the espresso cocktails. My thoughts: It's steak and eggs, with steak being the star of the dish. How do you not know what cut it is? And yes, we could've googled the latter question, but he should have known. After waiting for him to answer these questions, we went with the following order:\\n\\nStarters:\\nDeviled Eggs, $6 - whipped filling with pepper and the prosciutto added the perfect touch of saltiness!\\n\\nCinnamon Rolls, $5 - HUGE! One is enough for two to share. Cream cheese frosting is the way to do it!\\n\\nSmoky Trout Dip, $10 - Yummy and chilled, perfect for outdoor dining. Loads of texture and crispy bread for pairing is the perfect match.\\n\\nEntrees:\\n\\nQuiche, $14: Gorgeous presentation, great herbaceous flavors, but overdone. The eggs were separating from the crust making it a chore to enjoy. Full of veggies, large portion.\\n\\nThe Duke, $21: Most expensive brunch option (it's a burger). My friend ordered this medium, but it was served medium well. Close difference in temperatures, but it's still a difference. I was looking forward to trying her fries...waaaay too much pepper! \\n\\nChicken Fried Chicken, $16: Our other friend ordered this. Hearty, savory, and delish per his tastebuds. Being from Chicago visiting the south, he was craving a buttermilk biscuit and evidently, this dish did not disappoint.\\n\\nSteak & Eggs, $19: The hubs opted for this dish and was very pleased with it. He ordered his steak medium rare and enjoyed bites mixed with eggs, white beans and chorizo with other tex mex ingredients. I tasted it and could see why he was happy with his choice.\\n\\nIf you can't tell, my main disappointment was related to the service, especially since we drove out of our way for King + Duke, which I chose over another restaurant, to celebrate my husband's first Father's Day. Two out of the four main dishes were spot on. The cocktails were great, from a classic Bloody Mary to the Portrait of a Lady -- a fruity blend of vodka and prosecco. The espresso cocktail that my husband ordered was also delish. This wasn't the one with Teeling. Speaking of which, my husband's cocktail was the last to be served out of all 4 of ours, such that he had to stop and remind our waiter about it. It seems our waiter forgot it along with all the other answers to our questions about the menu. Maybe he was new.\\n\\nWater refills were slow and we were seated outside which didn't make the delay ideal. Albeit, the outdoor space is large, shaded/covered, with fans, but it's like 90 degrees in Hotlanta these days. As I mentioned to Cara, this could have been a one off with the busy holiday crowd in consideration, but I don't have a previous experience to compare it to. She assured me that they'd love a chance to give me a more favorable experience to compare it to. Cara sent me a follow up email including her contact info. If and when we return, I'll be sure to provide an updated, detailed review."},{"name":"Reale's Italian Cafe","address":"13450 N Hwy 183, Ste 230","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"So I saw this place on a foodie Friday episode it's near my house and I thought well I'll give it a try.

Our host gave us a choice of seating arrangement, and we chose to sit at regular table instead of a high top.

She couldn't really decipher any particular flavors from it. The chips were crispy and delicious, and a fun way to hold us over.

Abby Lane boasts an impressive list of cocktails, and I wish I had been in the city longer to try more of them.\\n\\nFor dinner I ordered the margherita, with fresh basil, mozz, and garlic oil. I must say, I was expecting more from such an upscale establishment. The pizza was boring at best. I mean, it wasn't bad, but everything seemed bland and tasteless. The crust was blah. The sauce seemed to be crushed tomatoes with no seasoning whatsoever. Fresh mozz is tasteless by nature, and even the basil lacked life flavor-wise. It was the kind of dish that isn't bad enough to complain to management about, but you know you'll never order it again.

In the end, I decided to give the club 4 stars because the course layout is scenic and fun and the course was in good condition when we played. It was a great value and we enjoyed our round, but it was not without its fair share of problems.\\n\\nHeritage has three nines: Heritage, Legacy, and Tradition. Tradition is the club's newest nine. When we played, Tradition's greens had recently been aerated so we played Legacy followed by Heritage. From the tips, Legacy-Heritage measures 6,875 yards with a rating/slope of 70.6/138.\\n\\nThe scorecard is confusing because it shows all three nines, but only totals for Legacy-Heritage. Also, the individual hole handicaps on the scorecard don't make sense. I don't know what's the easiest way to explain it other than to say if you play Heritage-Tradition or Tradition-Legacy, you'll be scratching your head wondering while multiple holes have the same handicap. For example, Heritage No. 2 is the No. 2 handicap hole, but so is Tradition No. 1. Huh?\\n\\nOne thing I like about Heritage is it's not located too far from the city and it sure beats most, if not all, of the public courses inside the perimeter. However, Heritage is also a victim of its own success. This place is popular. It's the most crowded golf course I've ever played on, not just in metro Atlanta, but anywhere.\\n\\nI heard from a member that they schedule tee times 8 minutes apart here. That's fine, but for a public course that sees a lot of beginner and recreational golfers, that might be a bit too ambitious. I don't work in the golf industry, so what do I know? I was told to prepare for a 6-hour round and reviews on Yelp only confirmed the slow play.\\n\\nOur foursome was able to finish in about 5 hours, which I was fine with. From the 1st tee through the 18th green, there was always a group directly ahead and directly behind us. The course was very busy and they packed the rounds in good. Fortunately, we never had any major holdups and the foursome ahead of us kept pace pretty well.\\n\\nOur foursome paid $45.99 per golfer for a Saturday morning tee time through TeeOff.com. This was a good deal considering we would've paid $69 each if we booked directly through the pro shop.\\n\\nHeritage has a nice driving range with a couple different tiers. You hit off of grass as opposed to mats. Tickets for range balls can be purchased inside the pro shop. They have one of those machines where you punch a code into the ball dispenser to get balls. The practice putting green is also nice as is the short game area. Like the course, the range, practice putting green, and short game area were quite crowded during our visit.\\n\\nIt was so crowded that we had problems getting a golf cart for our 10:40 AM tee time. All the carts had been taken. The fellow handing the bag drop had to grab a partially charged cart from the garage. It was missing a windshield, scorecard, and pin sheet. When we pulled up to the starter, he gave us the pin position for the day, but it did us no good because neither of our foursome's carts had a pin sheet. The starter said he'd get us a pin sheet, but we never got one.\\n\\nThe course is very hilly with all sorts of undulations on both the fairways and greens. The greens were in terrific shape, comparable to a lot of private clubs' greens. The tee boxes were different. Some of them were pretty beat up. The fairways and rough were in alright condition. For the price we paid on a public course, I wasn't complaining. The course also has a lot of bunkers. Several of the bunkers had pipes sticking out of them, which isn't aesthetically pleasing, but at least they drain (unlike some other courses I've played on).\\n\\nOverall, I'd say the layout is challenging, but scorable for most skill levels. I'm not sure I'd recommend this course for a beginner or even too many recreational golfers due to several narrow fairways and hazards. The Legacy and Heritage nines surround a large pond. Those holes where water is in play (I think there's 6 of them) are especially beautiful. The clubhouse also has a scenic view of the water. The clubhouse has a bar/grill and a small pro shop. It's classed up, but still fairly basic.\\n\\nThe employees I've encountered have been polite, friendly, and helpful. During our round, I think we saw a marshal once, maybe twice. There was no food and beverage cart service.\\n\\nIn the end, I do recommend Heritage Golf Links. Just be cognizant of the crowds on the weekends.\\n\\nOther facts: Dr. J (Julius Erving) purchased this club in 2006 and renamed it Celebrity Golf Club. It foreclosed in 2010. In April that year, Affiniti Golf (now Mosaic Clubs & Resorts) took over and made changes, one of which was naming the club Heritage Golf Links. Yet another ownership group, Triumph Golf, took over in June 2015.

Seated immediately as there wasn't quite that many people in the restaurant. Ordered the Beluga Lentils, Tandoori Prawns, and Roasted Cauliflower dishes. The atmosphere is pretty Austin-like and the people were standardly friendly. Nothing too much to shout about.\\n\\nPeople are reading just for the food anyway, right?\\n\\nI'll first say that the Roasted Cauliflower was quite delicious. I had little to no complaints about it....except for the fact that if you wait too long to eat it, the chips will get a bit soggy. The whole dish tasted healthy as a whole, and quite flavorful. I don't think any of the flavors were strong enough to put off anybody, so if you happen to be coming with your kids and want them to eat their veggies, give them this.\\n\\nThe Beluga Lentils wasn't too bad either. Wholesome mix of various spring-like ingredients that could've been eaten separately or mixed together with the white cream. Up to you. Sort of basic though and kinda pales overall in comparison to the roasted cauliflower.\\n\\nThe Tandoori prawns were quite spicy and had a good amount of sauce beneath them...but with 3 prawns/plate at $18/plate, I'd have to give this an extremely hard pass. I believe that I could have made the same dish with just as much flavor (though I'd loosen it a bit considering how the spice was quite overwhelming and I could only taste faint hints of the actual prawn itself) for a FRACTION of the price. \\n\\nThe Roasted Cauliflower was $9 and  the Beluga Lentils was $14. In reality, $9 for cauliflower is pretty steep too, but the flavor profile of the dish was so good that I'm willing to let it go. For the prawns, it was just spicy. There was no depth of flavor and it tasted pretty immature in terms of the blend of spices put onto the shrimp. \\n\\nThe shining star of these dishes was the Milk Chocolate Semifreddo. It looked like this dish belonged in a $$$ level restaurant as it was quite beautiful and tasted VERY good. $9? Fine with me. This dish was worth every penny. Thick and creamy consistency and spot-on blend of liquid and solid ingredients to create a refreshing series of bites. HIGHLY recommend.\\n\\nI did come later just for dessert for the birthday cake ice cream and paid 6.50 (w/ tax) for those bars. They're a lot smaller than you think (like a third of an iPhone 6s per piece). It tasted...exactly like birthday cake ice cream! The bar itself was interesting in terms of texture and I applaud them for that, but that was the only thing worth noting about this dessert. I'm going to take a stand and not recommend the sandwich to anyone, as there's no crazy flavor that arises out of this dessert. I didn't have many bites of the panacotta but from what my friend told me, she though it was an extremely good pana cotta.\\n\\nEven though it's quite pricey for no reason, I think my next dining experience will be better if I just order more of the right things.\\n\\n8/10, would come again and recommend to a friend."},{"name":"Voodoo Doughnut - Old Town","address":"22 SW 3rd Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"Is it the donuts?

Me and my girl were already in and had made eye contact, and hell, what Asian food place doesn't have rats or mice when you get down to it?  Most...no all others actually hide their mouse and rat traps during the day so the customers that come in don't actually see them, but hey it's this guys place, let him do what he needs to do.  My girl really loves Thai food, so we stayed to try it.  Turrrrible decision.\\n\\nWe sit and the overly unattentive waitress finally decides to inquire of what we want.  I ordered the curry puffs and she ordered the chicken satay.  Terrible, just terrible.  The  puffs were like hot boiling mush, I actually squirted hot scalding oil on my girl when I bit in to one. Just drenched in oil and as tasteless as week old baby food that's been sitting out on the counter.  The satay shit, was, well shit.  I'm convinced this is what happened to the mice when he caught 'em with the mouse traps.  Old stale meat, tasteless and the watery crap they called peanut sauce was anything but.  \\n\\nNeedless to say we were disgusted, hadn't hardly ate any of it and wanted to return it.  We asked the waitress to take it back and that we weren't going to pay for it because it was just terrible terrible food.  We were willing to try something else, but she about had a hissy and started yelling.  Then out of the back comes this little guy that thinks he's allah or something.  He starts in on me about how can I complain about his food and that we're stupid for not liking it and that we'd have to pay or he'd call the cops.  I calmly tried to explain that this food was terrible, no beyond terrible, and that we didn't want it, hardly ate any of it and we'd gladly try something else.  He wouldn't relent, it was like I called his mother a whore or something.  I was getting to the point of just punching him, but my girl grabbed me.  I told the guy to F off and that I wasn't paying shit and if he wanted to call the cops, go ahead.  We stormed out with him screaming in the background and out on to the patio, pointing to his phone.  What a disaster.  I hate how it went down, and have never left a place like that, but if a place is so rude to it's customers, has no care about it's customers and their enjoyment of their food, do they deserve a dime?  To me hell no.\\n\\nI haven't written a review in a while, but when I heard what the little jerk off owner said about the tragedy in Connecticut, I felt compelled to come and give a review.

First, the sushi combos can either be 2 rolls or 3 rolls from a selection of 20 or so different rolls. The 2 roll combo is less than $10 while the 3 roll combo is a few dollars more. The rolls also come with your choice of soup or salad. All the rolls mainly come with 5-6 pieces and are pretty basic. For the rice/noodle combinations, you get to choose a meat and sauce style and get a full plate of food. It is a generous portion size and you also get the choice of soup or salad.\\n\\nThe service here is mediocre at best with minimal servers even though lunchtime can get pretty crowded. Each time I have ordered sushi, it takes awhile for the sushi to be made and the hot food tends to be made faster.

This wasn't the case here, the lobster was a nice compliment to the assortment of noodles.\\nLobster fried rice was great, though I would say here what I mentioned earlier. Lobster was likely a way to \\"fanci-fy\\" the dish. The fried rice itself is a great solid Asian dish. The deep fried lobster sort of butchers it a little. I really doubt deep frying a lobster is the best way to prepare it, the meat ended up being a little tough and dry. I would happily order the fried rice again if they had a fried rice minus the lobster option (hopefully cheaper too?)\\nThai curry was really colorful with the assortment of bright colored veggies. Outside of that though, it's a little difficult to hold a candle to Thai curries prepared at a good Thai restaurant.\\n\\nOne thing I will say is that I was glad to have stopped in for lunch instead of dinner, mainly because of the price difference. While I think the lunch prices are great and so was the food, it might be hard to give a 5 star if I was paying dinner prices for the same food. Not dissing the food, more for the price and value ratios."},{"name":"Bouldin Creek Cafe","address":"1900 S 1st St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"I'm so glad I found this spot.

The rude woman's response was \\"WHY?\\" Rolled her eyes at my mom and walked away. Really girl?! You wanna get upset over three pieces of watermelon that you have the guts to charge $1.75 for? Sit. Down. She never came back to refill our water or anything. Strike one.\\n\\nThe Korean sushi \\"chef\\" behind the bar glared at us and pretended to not speak English when we tried ordering from him, and yet I saw him speak with other paying customers. Strike two.\\n\\nMy second visit, I only went to do the AYCE lunch deal. Luckily there was another server that was slightly kinder than the other lady (who was still there). On this visit I witnessed a man come in and sit at the sushi bar. He ordered baked mussels and the \\"mute sushi chef\\" just grabbed some plate from god knows where and handed it to him. The man put it right back on the belt, rightfully so. He had another plate, didn't finish and left visibly upset. The Korean douche behind the bar disappeared within 10 minutes of me sitting down. I'm sure he recognized me from the week before. For about 30 minutes, there was no one behind the sushi bar making sushi or taking orders. With their strict one hour policy regarding the AYCE deal, I found this unacceptable. \\n\\nI also witnessed another lady request something with a little more avocado from the server. Her response to the PAYING customer was \\"you don't see anything on the belt with enough avocado?\\" I was so tempted to say something by this point but I held my tongue. The last straw was when \\"bangs\\" lady decided to come by and leisurely restock the ginger as I'm still eating. No \\"excuse me,\\" or anything. I get that servers have side work so I watched to see if she would finish her route and restock the ginger in front of the gentleman a couple seats down from me but she didn't. His was even less than mine. It suddenly dawned on me that this woman was trying to either 1.) get under my skin because I was visibly upset when she talked to my mom on the first visit one week prior or 2.) rush me to finish. Strike THREE. \\n\\nI asked the Hispanic sushi chef in the green chefs coat if that woman was the owner because my thought was \\"who has the audacity to act this way as a server and still be able to keep her job?\\" He hesitated before he responded and said she was the owners \\"best friend.\\" Reflecting back, I'm almost certain he bended the truth.

I would much prefer one of the many price fix brunches that exist in the South End or even the all-you-can eat brunch at places like Tavern in the Square.

This review will be limited as I only experienced the oyster bar for the weekend happy hour from 3pm to 5pm.  The restaurant is located off of Howell Mill and I recommend valet parking as there is limited street parking.  The oyster bar is nicely designed and you have a nice view of the folks prepping the food.  The rest of the interior and main dining area is attractive.  My server, Stormy, was on point.  He recommended the bakers dozen (13 oysters) for $12.  This comes with house made crackers and the expected sides of horseradish, cocktail, mignonette, etc.  I was thoroughly satisfied with my oysters!

Most food carts all share the same characteristics, they're known for their food and not for their fine dining ambiance. Something that I'd never expect, you know what you're getting with food carts, we are all okay with this.\\n\\nWhen I walked into the HVS, I was blown away by the fact that it brought together not only great selections for food carts but it also paired it with an amazing seated experience for after you picked up your orders. I'm used to more of the *find any place you can find to perch, even if it's not meant for perching* sort of situation, or if I'm lucky, hunger game sprinting to a wobbly plastic picnic table. I've seen some food cart pods stepping it up lately but not to this scale.\\n\\nJapanese, Cajun, Mexican, Thai, Chinese, Filipino, American etc.\\nDoughnuts, gelato, coffee, beers, wines, ciders etc.\\nVegan, meat, adults and kids options.\\n\\nI haven't been disappointed with any cart but I definitely do have my favorites.\\n\\n1. Adobo (Filipino cart)\\n* Their adobo chicken is so tender and marinated, I can't get enough of their sauce.\\n* Their pancit noodle dish (which reminds me of pad woon sen for you Thai dish lovers) is my favorite. It's LOADED with meats (shrimp, laupchung, pork, chicken) and is heavy on garlic (I love garlic). Silver noodles and green onions to top.\\n* I forgot what they call them but their crispy rolls are so friggin good. Not too greasy and tons of flavor.\\n\\n2. Mixteca\\n* Holy Mole!!! I've never been a huge fan of mole. It's always too sweet. However every time I passed this cart my taste buds would go nuts. It smelt so good. We ordered a mole tamale and mole taco. There was so much care and love in these two dishes, you could taste it, corny I know. The flavors were so deep and amazing. The presentation of the tamales were gorgeous and the actual tamale was spot on, the insides were so good and not dried out. Her garnish is perfect with some of the red onion kick and her hot sauce was on point, too. That taco though, probably the BEST TACO I'VE HAD. Just do it. Not Nike. Do this cart. Do that. \\n\\n3. Laos cart.\\n* Their steak dish with sticky rice is simple yet perfect! He cooked it perfect at medium rare, sliced it up and served it fresh (cooked just for us). Came with well prepared sticky rice, cucumber slices and a salsa sort of sauce. \\n* Their papaya salad with house made jerky was delicious. Little warning though, when they do spicy, they DO SPICY. Like, your face hurt and your tongue might be getting injured. Still good but that salad face slaps you with a burning flame of flavor. The jerky would have been better if the pieces were more consistent. Some were amazing and tender and others were almost crunchy. I'll give it another go. Flavor was perfect - just the consistency on cook was my main thing."},{"name":"La Hacienda Real","address":"12025 SW Canyon Rd","city":"Beaverton","stars":"3.5","text":"Um this place is usually crowded and no hate or offense but the bean dip is a little watery and after we paid we had to wait 28 minutes to get it back.. there's also a low variety of food on the kid's menu and it's the same one as last year.. no hate and no offense to this restaurant but I would like some improvements the next time I come back.."},{"name":"Davenport Diner","address":"40230 US Highway 27 N, Ste 240","city":"Davenport","stars":"4","text":"Good bacon, over easy eggs, hash browns, biscuit and sweet tea.

Well guess what, I do. Love. Really. And really, it was love at first sight! Sorry it took me so long to say it. I've been feeling it this whole time, I swear!\\n\\nMany many years ago we met. Back when I didn't know better and would try random restaurants in the Pearl without checking into them first.  I stopped in for tapas and we began our sordid affair.  I kept coming back, and often. As often as I could deal with your out-of-control dinner crowds.  The food and drinks are both astounding, too good to pass up.  The way you offer tapas in three different sizes, the amazingly authentic latin cocktails, the indulgent flavors, the tantalizing combinations, the gratuitous use of avocado... they all did it for me. \\n\\nThat all led to our romance, not one of convenience, but one I had to work at. I had to make reservations or wait, a long time.  I never held that against you. I know you are so good that everyone needs a piece of you, and I feel it. I want them to get some of you too. everyone deserves a taste so good. At least once.\\n\\nYear after year I snuck in a little piece of you for me here and there. I made it happen.  I told everyone I know that you are one of the best restaurants in Portland.  I sent people even when I didn't have the time or the tenacity to wrestle myself a spot in your bar for dinner. \\n\\nThen finally, yesterday, I discovered your happy hour.  That was it. That made me stop and say, I truly do, love you, Andina.  $2/$4/$8 tapas plates and $5 cocktails? Oh yes. I was always willing to pay regular price, but discounted? Wow. \\n\\nYour great service, your sublime food, your amazing cocktails, and all for an incredibly reasonable price at happy hour. I am won. \\n\\nThank you for your patience with me, Andina, and for always allowing me back in.  I promise I never took you for granted. And now you know how I feel."},{"name":"Santouka Harvard Square","address":"1 Bow St","city":"Cambridge","stars":"4","text":"So I have only gone once, and I will definitely update the review if and when I have a chance to get another bowl.\\n\\nI am rating 3 stars because I think this is the best ramen by far I have had in this area (its not nearly as good as Totto Ramen, but light years ahead of the two places in Porter Square.) \\n\\nI hope to try again, and my ramen was good, but there were a couple issues. First, the restaurant was just way too flashy and ornate for my taste. Ramen is supposed to be a casual, fun, laid back food experience. Here, the managers and hostesses were decked out in their Sunday's best (suits for the men, very high heels and dresses for the ladies,) and the atmosphere was uneasy, not the relaxed ramen shop ambience you would expect. \\n\\nBesides the atmosphere, the prices were much higher than I expected. First, it seems that the ramen comes in multiple sizes (which is good for people who don't eat a lot, I suppose) however, the price of the regular size was higher than other ramen places in the area (and in New York City.) And, of course, the portion size was smaller. You're given a couple very small and thin (though they were very tasty) pieces of pork, and adding an egg was a whole $2 (double Totto's price.) Considering the comments last year by the CEO that ramen should be \\"cheap comfort food,\\" I was a bit surprised.\\n\\nFinally, the food. Maybe it was just me, but my miso ramen tasted eerily similar to instant ramen. Of course, you should expect some similarity, instant ramen is a Japanese export just like Santouka. But the similarity here made me wonder about just what was happening in the kitchen. Are the noodles fresh? Is the broth made in house, or is a prepackaged base used? I did enjoy my bowl of miso ramen, but by the end, I was unable to finish off my broth (as I usually do) due to the saltiness. Way, way too salty. \\n\\nOne more point. The seating area is oddly designed. They chose to put two long, ornate tables in the middle of the restaurant, which forced strangers to sit awkwardly together. Using the small tables throughout the restaurant would have made more sense, as you could simply put them together for large parties. The small tables are a bit squeezed together. There was a funny, if awkward moment when our ramen arrived as there was no way for the server to get the bowls to our table. I think it took 3 people to figure out how and to and finally bring us our ramen (one of the servers snuck through and then the manager or someone handed him the bowls.)"},{"name":"Rossi Bar And Kitchen","address":"895 N High St","city":"Columbus","stars":"4","text":"I made a to go order this evening - fries made well done and the lamb lollipops.

I've tried Pips, Blue Star, and now Voodoo, and here are my thoughts. Voodoo totally has that 'old town' feel which is great. If it's late at night and you need some dough to soak up the booze in your stomach, look no further. These donuts are akin to a big, greasy, diner cheeseburger. Noone will mistake it for a culinary masterpiece, but when you are in the mood for it, it can be perfect. Voodoo isn't too expensive, the donuts are massive and messy, and some of their options are pretty tasty.\\n\\n Personally, of the three I bought, I could pass on the Homer (sickeningly sweet strawberry) and the hibiscus, but the oreo covered creation was actually really delicious.\\n\\nPersonally, Pip's and Bluestar are far and away higher quality donuts.

Eggs perfectly cooked, and some of the best hollandaise we've ever had.  Shaved asparagus + hollandaise = awesome.\\n- Applewood smoked bacon.  Again, perfectly cooked, not at all greasy, and with spectacular texture and flavor.\\n- Strawberry ricotta toast.  This one was a bit of a let-down.  The strawberries weren't sweet/ripe enough to balance out the flavor of the ricotta, and my wife thought that a little bit more honey would have really helped the dish.\\n\\nThe drinks were tasty too -- I had the OJ and she had a shrub, both of which were very good.\\n\\nThe atmosphere here, though, is almost suffocatingly hip.  We live north central and don't make it down to the east side that often, but it really did feel over the top.  It was tough not to do our best impression of Blossom Dearie singing the Dorough/Frishberg classic, \\"I'm Hip\\".  Super round glasses and festive yet perfectly pressed button-down short-sleeve shirts abounded, almost to the point that we felt out of place.

The driver apologized for the late delivery and provided me a free cannoli with compliments from the chef. I was totally fine with that. I immediately opened the pizza since I was starved, and was initially disappointed by the light sprinkling of fresh basil as I'd ordered a margherita pizza. But I  devoured anyway. It was good, not excellent, but I intend on trying one of their other types as this pizza joint has really good reviews on here. I'd give the pizza just 3 stars but the cannoli was excellent, so that's my extra star.

We got there and there was no wait what so ever, but the menus were a bit hard to understand. So our waitress, when she first came over, asked if we were ready to order. We explained it was our first time here, so she give us a whole breakdown of the menu, which was extremely helpful. \\n\\nBecause we wanted to sample everything, we tried 2 combos; 1 combo with fried chicken and the other with gyoza. The price of the medium bowl, an egg, and the side of chicken/gyoza was 16 a pop. This is where I dock a .5 star off. If you got JUST a bowl of ramen, with nothing else, its about $12. It kind of forces you to grab the combo, which I'm not complaining, but it just makes it a little bit expensive for ramen. So for 16 dollars each, we dove in. Our food took maybe 10-15 minutes tops to come out? It was really fast! All the reviews said they waited a long time so I'm glad that we barely waited at all!\\n\\nThe medium bowl of ramen was huge in my option. It was larger than I expected, with lots of noodles and broth. The pork on top, was delicious. It was melt in your mouth flavor, without having to chew any of it. The seaweed and bamboo shoots were a nice touch as well. Now I grabbed the fired chicken, and it was my 2nd favorite thing about this place. It tasted like fried chicken should ALWAYS taste. Crispy, a little salty, but juicy on the inside. MY god it was delicious. And at $6 by itself, its definitely worth to get the combo just for that.\\n\\nNow the best thing about this place was the egg. MY GOSH THE EGG. It was marinated in soy sauce I believe, and then partially hardboiled. Basically the inside of the egg is still a bit runny and gooey, while the whites are fully cooked. Next time I'm getting 2 eggs. Because screw it, it's delicious. The gyoza my boyfriend had was also very good, better than typical gyoza.

So you aren't really sure what you're ordering . . . unless you try to point to a doughnut that's spinning around in their little case (in which there are no names to label the doughnuts).

We enjoyed the Salty Sow and I'm torn b/w a 3 and 4 and find both unfair for various reasons. It's rare that I'm caught off guard by a place since I do so much research before checking out a place. Given incredible experiences at many other lower rated restaurants in Austin I took my friend's recommendation and the thousands of reviews and 4.5 star rating as gospel and didn't do too much exploring. \\n\\nNavigating charcuterie boards with my girlfriend is quite delicate and we didn't do so well here. I was super excited and hopeful and they even accommodated our adjustment in selections a tiny bit for her aversion to pate. It's entirely possible that I struggled a bit to fully enjoy the meats and cheeses because I was aware that my girl did not. The chicken liver mousse was nice, but tasted no better or worse than any other chicken liver mousse. The waiter sold the pastrami salmon quite hard and we graciously received a generous portion in lieu of the pate my girlfriend didn't care for. The serving of the duck fat fries was generous and they were good, but despite being quite affordable, they were not memorable. We enjoyed the side of the cauliflower casserole with parmesan. We had a hard time agreeing on what to order and since the fries and charcuterie left us so full, we were only able to muster two sides. The cocktails were surprisingly delicious ($8) and I found the Pig'roni to be exceptional.

I'm not going anywhere!\\" and swings one of his freakishly long arms at the worker. I swear his arms were as long as he was, like 8-12 foot long arms. If he hadn't been highly intoxicated, he would have knocked the worker out. \\n\\n2 customers start to walk over, clearly ready to help the worker out if need be, but it's unnecessary because the worker takes a fighting stance and proceeds to.... unbuckle his belt.

I guess the adrenaline was still coursing through the worker though, cause he proceeds to push the man in the back as he was leaving. I'd like to point out that the worker was 1/2 the height of the tall man, making him 4-6 ft tall.

While visiting family I had been hearing all week about this great French breakfast place we had to try before going home. I wanted to look them up prior but no one knew the name because apparently \\"Everyone\\" calls it the French breakfast restaurant.  So, you can imagine my surprise when we arrived to discover that it is NOT a fancy French breakfast bistro.  Aside from one french phrase written on the wall I didn't see anything even remotely French about it.  And by briefly skimming the other reviews no one mentions anything about being a French restaurant so I will concede that it's not the restaurant's fault that my husband's idiotic family assumes their nicknames are what everyone in Canada calls a restaurant.\\n\\nThat being said though, even for being a regular breakfast restaurant I don't understand what the big deal is all about.  I don't understand how so many reviews can say the service is so friendly and amazing.  However, I can't technically say that the service was bad because there was ABSOLUTELY NO SERVICE AT ALL.  Someone sat us, we placed our order at the coutnrer, we paid at the counter.  We received our drinks at the counter.  Those of us that wanted water had to go ourselves up to the station to get water.  And the glasses are so small I had to make like 5 trips to get water throughout the meal.  A server quickly set our plates in front of us and walked away.  Aside from the quick, unfriendly delivery of food our server never ONCE visited our table to get drinks, get water, or even inquire about our meal.  We ate, and then left since we had already paid at the counter.  Keep in mind this was about 10:30am on a Tuesday.  There were only  about 3 other tables there are four employees all just standing and talking to each other behind the counter.\\n\\nAs for the food, it was okay for the most part.  Nothing special but it wasn't bad.  My MIL raved about the beans and said I had to get them.  I took one bite and was done.  They weren't horrible but they tasted no different to me than a can of Busch's baked beans.  Maybe Canadians just loved baked beans more than Americans, or at least Chicagoans. My biggest pet peeve is that the menu says they serve hash browns.  Hash brown are SHREDDED potatoes that are fried in a skillet, with or without onions.  Served loose in restaurant and packed into a patty at fast food places.  What we received are o'brien potatoes or home fries.  They didn't taste bad at all, but it is very disappointing to think you are expecting hash browns and get served with home fries instead.\\n\\nOverall, I'll pass.

The waiter brought the receipt, showing the change, but no money. I had to ask for my change (this is $44 in addition to the $26 tip added to the check. There's no way he thought all of this was his tip). It took forever for him to return.

I came here September 2018 with an entourage of friends for my friend's 27th birthday. I had quite a few issues. First- it can be a little confusing to find the entrance if you have never been before. At the time my friends arrived it was well after dark and none of us had been so after our uber dropped us off we wandered around in the dark until we found it. \\n\\nSecond- it is very dark inside the restaurant and we did have to use our phones at times to see our menus. It was also incredibly loud inside. We had seats in the sort-of middle of the restaurant not too far away from the bar (very cool bar, might I add) but there was a live band playing and they were deafeningly loud. Our table of four had to shout at one another and I already have issues understanding people at moderate volume levels (I can hear, just not understand) so after awhile I gave up because I was asking my friends to repeat themselves multiple times. \\n\\nMy third problem is with some of the prices. I had the empanada appetizer and while it was tasty and the presentation was fancy, it was literally one empanada cut in half. For 11 dollars. One empanada. Ridiculous. My friends chose to order the salmon chips to split amongst themselves and they seemed to like them. I did not partake. We were also given a bread and ricotta appetizer that I will admit was quite lovely and we destroyed it in no time since we were very hungry.  \\n\\nFourth, my problem is with the food quality and the service associated with it. I chose to order the New York strip (which looks to have been replaced with the filet mignon on the menu). We waited more than half an hour for our entrees. My steak was incredibly fatty. I ended up cutting off more than a third of the steak because it was pure fat. I'm aware some people love eating the fatty bits but I am not one of them- I gag on them. The mushrooms that came with it were very delicious and I gave each of my friends a mushroom and each said they were amazing. But the steak was not good. I spoke up to the waitress and asked if all their pieces were like this and she said \\"Oh, New York strips are a very fatty cut of meat.\\" Uh. Not really... They have some fat, but not the point where you should be cutting off a third of the entire portion. She asked me if I would like a new one and I said no thank you as it had taken more than half an hour to receive our entrees to begin with and I was not about to add an extra delay to my friend's birthday party for a new steak, and at this point my friends were finishing up eating. She asked me if I would like to replace my entree and I declined for the same reason as above and also because at the time of our outing there was nothing else on the menu that sounded good to me (I hadn't picked the restaurant, so I had to work with what was available). \\n\\nFifth, after we spoke to the waitress, a man popped up at our table. Bear with me- it's exactly what it sounds like. A man suddenly appeared at our table and stood in front of me. He was mid 30s and dressed very casually- jeans and a short sleeve linen shirt, and said \\"Hey! What's going on?\\" I apologize if I stared at him because I had literally no idea who this was or what he wanted from me. I think I answered along the lines of \\"Hey..? Not much?\\" He then said \\"I heard you had a problem with the steak!\\" It dawned on me that this was a manager who had come to remediate the issue. Why did he not introduce himself? He had no name tag or anything- nothing to indicate he was a manager. I spoke to my friends after the fact and apparently they were all just as confused as me as to why a random guy would show up to make conversation like that. We had a good laugh after the fact, but at the time it was truly bizarre. He, like the waitress, tried to offer me a new steak or entree but I told him the same thing that I told the waitress about the timing. \\n\\nI believe they took a portion of my meal off the bill as an apology but I wasn't really impressed with the vibe of the place so I don't see myself coming back of my own choosing."},{"name":"Andina Restaurant","address":"1314 NW Glisan St","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"Great libations, easy paced dinner for 8.

The edges were a little tough and chewy, but the steak seasoned just fine. The chimichurri was a little overwhelming. I felt that the acidic taste didn't mesh well with the savory side dishes. The green beans were also tough, bordering underdone. The best part of the meal was the mashed potatoes. Creamy and savory, they saved the meal.

I took a friend and my sister here and was really excited to try the food, but all of us left just \\"meh\\".  Now I'm left wondering if I just had a terrible experience on an off night..\\n\\nThe atmosphere here is great - nice open seating plan and comfortable.  It was nice to be seated in the patio area where there was plenty of natural sunlight coming through.  The food smelled amazing!  I would still recommend making a reservation via OpenTable if possible, though they were not busy at all in the early evening on weekday.\\n\\nWe started off with an appetizer of calamari that was just any other calamari I've had with a more crispy batter versus those at like say, an Italian restaurant.  The batter/crispiness reminded me of the outside of a mozzarella stick.  It was drizzled with a pineapple mayo which tasted like honey mustard (which I was not a fan of) with a side of sweet and spicy sauce.  It was good, but nothing to call home about or anything crazy special that you couldn't get anywhere else.\\n\\nHow does a restaurant mess up plain ol' white rice?  Well, they serve you half-cooked rice that is still tough to chew.  We sent it back and they apologized to us for serving us rice from the batch that was \\"still cooking\\".  \\n\\nMy sister ordered a dish with all kinds of seafood in a curry-type based sauce - can't remember the name for the life of me but it's not on the menu on their website.  It had a nice flavor to it and had plenty of pieces of seafood in it - the tiger shrimp was my favorite.  Probably the best dish that evening.\\n\\nI ordered the lamb rack for myself, which was 3 pieces of super fatty, hardly-any-meat lamb.  The flavoring was mediocre and honestly, I can make better lamb chops myself.  The temperature was nice though - medium rare.  The broccolini was probably the best part of this dish.  The kale mashed potatoes were probably some of the worst I've had in recent memory - all three of us tried it and all agreed that it had zero taste.  Literally potatoes mashed with some cooked kale with no salt or butter or anything!!  Perhaps it really was an off night?\\n\\nThe crispy beef tips that my friend ordered reminded me of something I've had at PF Changs or Panda Express.  No joke.  It was so fried that there was hardly any beef left to chew.  All batter, no beef, and tasted like American Chinese food.  \\n\\nOur waitress was really nice and attentive, at least.\\n\\nUnfortunately I was just really not a fan of the food here - maybe I came on an off night or maybe my tastebuds just aren't used to \\"fusion\\" Thai food, but it really wasn't worth the price and you can get better food at a legit Thai restaurant like Thai of Norcross for half the price of less."},{"name":"The Chateau","address":"535 John Mahar Hwy","city":"Braintree","stars":"2.5","text":"My wife and I have occasionally dined here.

The restaurant itself is smaller than what I had expected given that a lot of people talk about hitting this spot up for outings. So expect it to be packed... at most times during its business hours.\\n\\nA few things first: the restaurant is located on Piedmont avenue. Easy to pass if you're flying down the street and not sure what to look for. It's located on the left side (Btw, Piedmont is a one-way street) in what was a house. There's a small amount of street parking. However, if you don't feel like searching for non-booting parking spaces you can go with the valet service which is still pretty small but at least you don't have to suffer the headache of looking for a place to park.\\n\\nMy recent visit to Poor Calvin's was for a Girl's Brunch Day around 1pm. After all these years, still packed. This can be annoying but is always a good sign for a restaurant. There is a small bar area where you can post up if you're waiting for a your entire group to arrive. Sidebar: you will not be seated until your entire party arrives. They also have an outdoor patio off the street.\\n\\nThe host was friendly and professional. He seated us and told us who are waiter was. Our waiter, Chris was cool. He made sure he answered any questions. Gave us recommendations of those us needing a little help deciding. And was very attentive. Actually, every waiter/waitress was very friendly. Two of us (one of which was myself) had the Crispy Beef. I was so tempted to order the Lobster Fried Rice since I saw a lot of that going to different tables. One person had the Chicken and Sweet Potato Waffle (another dish I considered). And another person had the Shrimp, Cajun Sausage and Cheese Grits. One of my friend's also ordered a potato dish that I unfortunately cannot remember the name of but it involves cheese and some other goodness that you want to ask about. Trust me on this.\\n\\nAnd you know you can't do brunch without drinks. We had Tiki Rum Punch and Peach Bellini's around the table. My punch could've used a little more rum in it but since I was driving I was okay with it. \\n\\nI'm sure to visit Poor Calvin's again without so many years between my next visit.

I didn't even notice until halfway through that it didn't come with butter, and I feel like that says a lot for me because I usually can't do pancakes or waffles without butter.

I did not have any problems finding street parking but we did make an early reservation. The lay out of the restaurant was awesome.

We were told to order the cucumbers salmon roe & buttermilk dressing appetizer. We did as we were told and wow was that delicious! We ordered the crispy polenta, escargot & watercress appetizer as well, mostly because escargot is a favourite of mine. I insisted on getting Luigi's meatball because, well hello, we kind of have to. The waitress suggested that we share one meatball since we already had 2 other appies. All three appetizers were absolutely amazing, and I would come back to this place for the appetizers alone. The polenta escargot dish in particular was something I did not expect to be so amazing- I've never had anything like it! \\n\\nFor our entr√©es, I chose the tagliatelle & Bison ragu bianco which was more on the salty side. I have had pasta in several parts of Italy, and during my travels I realized that true Italian pasta is quite salty! This makes it hard for me to judge true Italian pasta as I have not acquired this type of taste yet. Overall, the dish was a 3.5/5 in my opinion. \\n\\nMy boyfriend had the risotto which was on special. He was happy with his dish but not quite blown away.

Since we had reservations we were seated immediately. The restaurant is a hole in the wall place within a neighborhood in East Austin. From the outside you are probably expecting a diner, but it's actually a really nice restaurant.\\n\\nBecause we had a large BBQ lunch earlier we weren't really interested in anything too heavy for dinner. Our waitress was really great, guiding our choices towards things that were lighter, but filling. We ended up sharing the crab and avocado toast, beet hummus, fries, brussels sprouts, farm salad, and the whole branzino.\\n\\nFirst, our cocktails were really refreshing. They were strong enough and not too sweet. Some of my friends got served with the ombre straw, which was funny cause I always associate that with kid smoothies.\\n\\nOur foods were fantastic! I don't think there was a dish we out right disliked. Especially the branzino! It was herby and lemony and incredibly moist. Perfectly cooked with no fishy taste. It's all we could talk about. I'm also a sucker for brussels sprouts and these were a great spin on them. I've had them with balsamic to get that sticky acid, but here they used marmalade which tasted great. And they were perfectly tender and not bitter.\\n\\nDessert was also good. I did not enjoy the dirt cake. It just didn't ring to me as a composed dessert because there were too many components that you had to search for in order to get it in one spoonful. The tart was great, but just a tart. Nothing really stood out about it. The birthday cake ice cream sandwich was the star though! Having the sandwich part be raw cookie dough was probably the best idea ever!!!\\n\\nOverall it was a great dining experience. We were never rushed even though we were there for 2+ hours. Our waitress was fantastic making sure our waters were full and cocktails were replenished. She also made accommodations for our non-gluten friend.

The waitress told us she was sorry because she didn't see anyone sitting there. So there seems to be a lack of communication with the hostess and servers.

The wings were a decent size and had A LOT of sauce. I should caution the Level 2 is pretty damn hot! My son got the kids pizza which he really enjoyed. The kids chicken tenders meal had a lot of pieces which I was surprised about. However, he said they were kind of peppery.

Broder Cafe is located in Southeast Portland neighborhood filled with chill bars and intriguing restaurants.  The interior feels quite Scandinavian - wooden, geometric, and ornate with an outdoor patio.

They were very nutty and served with a zesty lemon curd and berry compote. I would have liked for it to be moister, but I am not an expert on Scandinavian pastries so perhaps they are meant to be on the dryer side.\\n\\nWhat blew me away was their baked eggs with goat cheese, golden basil tomatoes and squash.  It just melts in your mouth.  The herbed ch√®vre was incredibly creamy and served with a fresh walnut bread.  It was served in such an appetizing skillet dish as well.  We ordered a side of the Swedish pancake, which was super tasty with the scallions and had a crunchy texture.  The pancake went really well with their spicy ketchup.\\n\\nHaving been in Copenhagen and unable to eat their Smorrebrod, which is a traditional Danish open-faced sandwich with different topings, I was eager and excited to try Smorrebrod at Broder.

We arrived at 5:30pm on a Sunday, and there was only one table of two and a couple people at the bar. But once it got a bit later into the night, more tables came through to dine. The atmosphere is chill and relaxed, with remixed top 40 songs with a slight mix of oldies playing. I very much enjoyed the playlist. The decor is modern with touches of details that nod to the inspirations of the sea, such as the crate enclosed lamps hanging from the ceilings, and the wall made of oyster shells.\\n\\nNow on to the food! For the table of 7 we ordered:\\n-Yellowfin Tuna Poke - fresh, tender pieces of raw tune contrasted with crisp taro chips. Simply delicious.\\n-Salmon Tartare - salmon is my favorite type of fish, and it was served perfectly here too. Comes with a side of crispy potato chips to also contrast the buttery, tender pieces of salmon. \\n-A dozen oysters of mixed variety - Did not get a taste for myself, but the rest of the fam enjoyed it, no complaints!\\n-Prince Edwards Island Mussels Couscous - the couscous really soaked up the flavor of the mussels, very flavorful and perfect warm dish for a cold evening.\\n-Buttermilk Biscuit - flaky layers of biscuit + warm butter + gooey honey...what's not to love?! Love the mix of buttery, sugary, deliciousness all in one.\\n-ICOB Caesar salads and Lobster Bisque - to share. No complaints here either. Good and prepped us for the main entrees!\\n\\nFor myself, I opted for 3 side dishes as my main course. I got:\\n-Brussels Sprouts with horseradish cream and chorizo - WOW. I love Brussels sprouts, and this dish did it no wrong. Plus the chunky bits of chorizo made it that much better!\\n-Delicata Squash - sweet, soft, tender squash reminds you why you love the Autumn season.\\n-Crimini mushrooms - simply warm, delicious, juicy mushrooms that will fill you up. A nice portion too.\\n\\nThe rest of the family had these dishes. They loved what they got:\\n-Fish & Chips\\n-Lobster Roe Noodles\\n-Grilled Hangar Steak\\n-Grilled Swordfish\\n-Grilled Maine Salmon\\n\\nAnd to top off our evening, we got these desserts to share:\\n-Daily Ice Cream churned in-house\\n-Banoffee Pie\\n\\nWould I come back for a second round - yes!"},{"name":"Mary Mac's Tea Room","address":"224 Ponce De Leon Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"You only need to order the 3 piece fried chicken with fried green tomatoes and slaw.

We arrived about 2pm, business was pretty steady yet we were seated right away. Our waitress through obvious signs in her body language showed no interest in doing her job on that day. We placed our order, and I specifically requested a \\"plain burger with only American cheese.\\" Our orders came out all together from the kitchen, with our waitress quickly placing each plate in front of us then disappearing. I quickly noticed my burger was smothered in onions and other garnishes. I patiently waited for our waitress,, flagged her over, and nicely explained this was not the \\"plain burger with American cheese\\" as I had ordered. No apology, no empathy, the waitress immediately went on a three plus minute lecture on how it was up to me to fully explain what I wanted on and what I did not want on my hamburger. I said nothing, the waitress puled my plate away and stormed off. The replacement burger  came in short time, but before placing my dinner down the waitress again went into an excessive lecture mode on how it was my responsibility to state what I wanted and did not want on my burger when I place my order. For the waitress to lecture in that manner was so unprofessional, but for her to disrupt and do it in front of the entire table was beyond rude. We began to enjoy our meal and my wife realized she never received the side of grits she ordered. Again, we waved down the waitress, and my wife made a request for her missing order of grits. In a very efficient manner the grits were out from the kitchen, but as a walk by the waitress literally tossed the grits on the table, much like the paperboy would toss the paper on the front step. The grits landed, skidded a bit and all four of us could not believe what we just witnessed. \\n\\nAppropriately, the waitress got a very small tip based on her interactions with us. Possible it might of had been easier to endure the terrible service experience, had the meal been an amazing foodie experience. Overall the four of us agreed food wise The Friendly Toast was overpriced, portions were small, and the quality of the food was \\"ok\\" at very most. Again, food experience alone it was our first experience for all four of us, we will never go back, or would we ever recommend the restaurant - IHOP is so much more impressive. \\n\\nRegardless if the food was great, terrible or anywhere in between, I felt corporate at The Friendly Toast should of been made aware of the terrible service experience we encountered. The next day I attempted to find some corporate contact info through my web searches. Sadly, being  a privately owned company such details are not on the web, not even on their webpage do they list how to contact their corporate offices. \\n\\nI called the Burlington, MA location about 1:15pm to see if I could get a corporate phone number from the restaurant's end. A gentleman answered the phone, I made my request, and the response I received was \\"dude, we are really busy can you call back at another time.\\"\\n\\nFrom there I went to  The Friendly Toast's webpage, and amazingly there also is NO means to contact them from their webpage. I find this nothing more than arrogance, The Friendly Toast wants the customer's business but they do NOT want to be bother with the customer's interactions. Next, I went to The Friendly Toast's Facebook page and shared the exact same scenario as covered about. That was a few weeks ago, and I yet to receive any type of reply from The Friendly Toast. I attempted to allow them to address my situation, but it appears waitress rudeness is acceptable and they do not have time for me.\\n\\nso I post this to Yelp,in hopes no one going forward will have time for The Friendly Toast. Based on their non rely to my situation they feel profits are more important they patrons.

Our response was, \\"why didn't you tell us about the reservations over the phone and then we wouldn't have wasted our time\\".

How hard would it be to provide that information so that people wouldn't waste their time driving to a restaurant where's there's no chance they will get a table.

It looks like the bodegas from New York that notoriously sold illicit items and carried a faux inventory that just sat collecting dust. Entering Amir's, you are welcomed by a large cafeteria-type room with tables and chairs, shelves and drink cabinets. Most of the shelves and cabinets are empty but a few are stocked with juice. The place isn't kept clean. There were sticky areas on tables, halfway filled cups of tea left here and there, and it was generally unkept. \\n\\nI wasn't sure if they were still in business until a woman greeted me from the other side of a white wall separating the kitchen from the dining area. There is a small window in this wall, from which you are greeted and you order.\\n\\nIt being my first time here, I ordered what I figured would be familiar, quickly prepared, and delicious. And it was. I ordered the chicken and rice plate, anticipating something akin to the Halal I got in Manhattan so often. The food was done pretty quickly, and I took it to-go, not feeling particularly comfortable there. It wasn't until then that she offered me tea. I'm not sure what type of tea it is, but it's sweet and satisfying. I took a cup to-go with my food. \\n\\nI wasn't offered anything else, just the main chicken plate and the tea. At $10, I felt this was too much for too little. Reading here that most received soup and salad, juice, etc. - I can certainly say that this would have been welcomed. \\n\\nThe food was undoubtedly delicious. It wasn't spicy, and I didn't love the \\"hot sauce\\" offered, but this wasn't an issue. The jasmine rice was great, the chicken tender and delicious, and everything else ideally balanced. It was a great sized plate as well, and the tea was a nice compliment. \\n\\nI would recommend Amir's to anyone looking for this type of food irrespective of the ordering environment or with the intention of taking it out (to-go). It reminded me of some middle eastern foods I've had, as well as the halal food so readily available on NYC street corners. If you're in the mood for something new, or maybe it's something familiar for you, try this place.

I personally like to order a handful of tapas -- relaxing with a drink for an hour or two. The ambiance is perfect, upscale and I love the live music. It's a little bit of Peru in the heart of Portland's Pearl District.\\n\\nFavorite Tapas:\\n\\n1. Conchas A La Parilla - grilled diver scallops w/ crispy onions.\\n::: Absolutely delicious!!! Tender yet meaty, savory and so vibrant with flavor ::: \\n2. Esparragos Peruanos - grilled asparagus brushed with olive oil.\\n::: For such a simple dish, it's excellent and wonderful to balance out the many flavors of your plates :::\\n3. Jamon Serrano - plate of Serrano ham, aged 12 months.\\n::: I love this dish, the ham is rolled and it's thick cut and savory. A tad salty but perfectly so!\\n\\nFavorite Dishes:\\n\\n1. Conchas Del Senor De Sipan - quinoa-crusted diver scallops perched on top of wilted spinach and potato-parsnip pur√©e, with golden beet and crabmeat \\"cannelloni, and a duet of red beet and passionfruit reductions.\\n::: I love scallops, beets and crabmeat. Could I find a more perfect dish? Wonderfully matched flavors and textures. Visually stimulating and a riot in your mouth :::\\n\\n2. Dorado Al Rocoto Y Kion - roasted mahi mahi over a shiitake mushroom, smoked bacon, and bok choy broth, topped with slivers of ginger, rocoto, and scallion basted with smoking sesame oil, served with asparagus-quinoa fried rice.\\n::: Mahi mahi is a very meaty fish -- paired with these flavors it soaks up everything and is a delight :::\\n\\n2. Adobo De Cerdo - pork tenderloin quickly braised in the Arequipa style, with butternut squash and gorgonzola ravioli, green apple, and a tamarillo-rocoto uchucuta.\\n::: The pork tenderloin is amazing - very flavorful and tender. The flavors of the green apple really bring out the pork. Delicious!\\n\\nFavorite Drink: \\n\\n1. Sacsayhuman - habanero pepper vodka shaken with pureed passion fruit and cane sugar, served up with a sugar rim and a cilantro leaf garnish.\\n::: They're known for this one - it's pronounced 'A Sexy Woman.' :::\\n\\nFavorite Desert:\\n\\n1. Plato De Crema Quemada - three pots of creme brulee each highlighting a distinct Peruvian flavor.\\n::: These flavors are always changing depending on what's in season ... you can't go wrong with this desert :::"},{"name":"Pei Wei","address":"12913 Galleria Cir, Ste 101","city":"Bee Cave","stars":"2","text":"Pei Wei has really revamped their menu.

But overall the flavor of the chicken and okra was plain and bland. My friend ordered 2 a la carte chicken tenders and a plate of 4 sides. I saw her put table salt on her chicken tenders because there was so little flavor. The spiced apples were delicious and I could definitely taste the cinnamon.

Take for example the pasta, which was some kind of boxed, over cooked spaghetti with what tasted like salsa (?) as the bolognese, with dense, dry meatballs. \\n\\nThe duck--which should be rare, I agree, but this was undercooked flavorless meat, with a saccharine sauce of some kind. Chewy. Just wrong. \\n\\nThe fish and chips looked like something from an airport kiosk. \\n\\nThe positive thing I can say is the old fashioned was excellent. \\n\\nAlso, I will concede, you have your grandma from Milwaukee visiting in Portland, she will *love* this place. \\n\\nDo not recommend."},{"name":"Bouldin Creek Cafe","address":"1900 S 1st St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"Came here to try the jackfruit tacos and although the tacos were good, the guacamole stole the show.

First of all who pays $29.95 for basically Chinese food and Gordon Food Services desserts.  First the place was dirty the floor had food, plastic and outside debris.  When you enter from the back of the restaurant there were cigarette butts on the ground, on the black chairs and smelled awful.  The Buffet... first the plates were dirty, I mentioned this to a server who just grabbed them and began to dry them off, I said, no they are dirty there was some type of yellow sauce sticking them together.  There was one salad which was empty and the same server told the people in front of me they are working on it.  So as you go around the tall bar were the food was located, which many older people were struggling to reach and hold their plates... there was brunch items...yes it is 5:30pm and we have bacon, sausage, French toast and dried up eggs Benedict. So where is the dinner...Chinese food...spring rolls, crab rangoon, spicy chicken, lo main...then green beans, potatoes, shrimp and salmon that was picked over. Then at a carving station a piece of maybe 7 inch dried up roast and old ham.  The desserts as I said came from Gordon Food Services- cookies, baby cream puffs etc.  So for $250 for 6 adults and a 2 year old is ridiculous ! I could of taken the entire family to another restaurant and ordered off a menu and payed less for better food.  I use to really like J.Liu, but the last few times it has really gone down hill.

When there is a place as great as Starliner right up the road, it's hard not feeling cheated out of something awesome with mediocre food. Also, this review is about breakfast only - I have not yet been for lunch or dinner.\\n\\nI was shocked at how big and new the restaurant felt - it was HUGE, and was one big room. It was nicely decorated, but empty at 10am on a Wednesday. I guess that's not so surprising. The signage at the door and VERY prominent bar made me feel like it was more a sports bar than anything. The main menu seemed really intriguing, and I wouldn't mind going back to try it for lunch or dinner, but being married to breakfastwithnick.com, I was there to scope out the morning meal.\\n\\nThe breakfast menu was much smaller than I was expecting and was less inventive than I had hoped. I ordered the breakfast quesadilla with chorizo, my sister ordered some breakfast taco things, I forget what they were called, and we got the rainbow pancakes for my son. Our food came out quickly and was piping hot. My quesadilla was fine, but there was so much cheese on it I couldn't taste the chorizo. I dismantled the tortilla and scraped off about 4 ounces of cheese just so I could eat it. I also thought there were supposed to be eggs on it, but I couldn't find any. Maybe they were so mixed in they disappeared. My sister loved hers, and it was smothered in a spicy queso that I ordered a side of for my dish. My son's pancakes were standard, if not a little tough, and the only thing that made them \\"rainbow\\" were colorful sprinkles on top. The portions were giant, and we ate most of our meals, so that's saying something, but there was nothing special about it. Pretty standard, good, fare.\\n\\nThe service was great - and the server was very nice. There was no indication of how to pay, whether to leave it on the table or go up, but we eventually went to the register. I'm not sure if I'd go back, but it was not a bad experience. When Starliner is up the road and I crave that place 24/7, it's hard to not drive the extra 1/2 mile.\\n\\nA note on their website, which I checked out before going (I usually like to do that). It.

Two NY stripes were to be med/well, one of those was my husband's and he only tolerates a slight pink.  I was impressed  that he tried to eat it even tho another steak was taken back for a re-fire.  After 3 bites he gave up and went ahead and asked that they cook it more.  When it came back to the table he cut into it and it was still raw.  By this time he was done with even trying to get his steak cooked correctly.\\n\\nThe manager came out and asked if they could butterfly a filet for him and cook it to the requested temp.

Wasn't a deal breaker as we were with friends and was enjoying the conversation. But honestly when the bottle of wine was placed upside down in the wine cooler, you would think the waitress would ask if we would like another bottle. ( she never did). Since there were four of us, and we each had a glass ( and nothing else) it was not as if she would be concerned we were over consuming.  Had to ask for refills of coffee and water, it was like she was a deer in the headlights and was definitely in over her head. Just chocked it up to being new, and learning the job. Not a deal breaker but not impressed considering the cost of the meal. We just chocked it up to a \\"off\\" night, but it didn't prepare us for our next visit almost a week later. \\n\\nSo the second time, we were planning to go to another restaurant, unfortunately it closed early (9.00) so we decided to go back again to the blue canoe. Well this time the waitress we had  was on point and the food was excellent, abiet Portions were small ( I had the Piaaya which I found very tasty, but the  portion was extremely small for the price ( which I commented on the comment card hoping the next time I was, in it would be to my liking ) Over all we had a great time. But being one last couples in the restaurant portion, and being near closing what I was shocked to see, was a mouse ( or small rat not sure?), since my wife screams at any rodent in a 50 ft range, I decided to warn her. I tried not to let it ruin my desert and the evening up to this point. \\n\\nBut what happened next pushed me over the edge. As I am watching the one rodent,  a group of Mouse/Rats also came out looking for floor scraps, from behind the booth, Now 4 more of his brothers and sisters have joined their brother, all scampering around  looking for food. So now we have 5 of the little critters looking for food.\\nHorrified, I mentioned it to the waitress, and although she seemed slightly shocked ( hard to tell) she offered to move us closer to the noisey bar portion. So we could finish, our desert and glass of wine. \\n\\nAt which time, I watched the Mice/Small rats?? scurry all around the dinning room, ( luckly my wife had her back to it, ) So i mentioned it to one of the male wait staff and he to my horror, said oh yeah, they come out when no one is around!!!!, and since we are so close to the water it can be expected.  At which time, my wife finished here wine and we quickly left. Tried to find the manager, but it looked like he was having a good time behind the bar, and honestly i just wanted to get out of there, Meal was paid for at this time, no one offered to comp it, and honestly at that point, didn't care just wanted to get out of the restaurant. \\n\\nNot impressed, I will never go back, sorry but the thought of mice running around when no one is there, especially on the cutery, is disgusting!!!!. \\n\\nTired to phone the manager but talked to the Supervisor on duty this morning, and explained the situation. tough place for her to be in, but honestly placating me is the least of their problems they need to call in an exterminator. Asap!!!! \\n\\nAs of this moment I am still waiting to hear back from the manager, should be interesting if he calls. This happened on a Saturday night, but honestly It took me a couple of days to calm down, before I wanted to put this out there. In this day and age, having mice in a restaurant running around is not acceptable!"},{"name":"Poor Calvin's","address":"510 Piedmont Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4.5","text":"For an Asian fusion restaurant, Poor Calvin's is really good. I'm generally not a fan of Asian fusion cuisine. Asian fusion restaurants are typically mediocre at best. It's a cuisine that's so... 90s. But somehow, chef/owner Calvin Phan pulls it off. The food is actually quite delicious. His take on the cuisine is modern and it works.\\n\\nThe restaurant opened downtown in November 2012 in an old, humble building at the corner of Piedmont Ave NE and Renaissance Pkwy NE. It's just one block south of the Publix and post office. Free parking is located on-site, whether on the property's small lot or on the street. During peak times, complimentary valet is available. If you self park, remove/hide all valuables because the surrounding neighborhood isn't the safest.\\n\\nThey've managed to do a lot with the modest space. The interior is decked out in all sorts of one-of-a-kind decor and artwork. There are multiple nooks and crannies to explore and several different sections of the restaurant to dine in, including the bar which always seems like a happening place. When the restaurant is busy, it can get cramped due to the limited space. They've tried to maximize seating capacity as comfortably as possible. There's an outdoor patio, covered with umbrellas, with a rock/bamboo garden and an open flame.\\n\\nThe vibe is sorta hip and trendy -- I guess what you'd expect from an Asian fusion joint downtown. Dinnertime ambiance is dark and candle-lit. It can get loud in here because of the background music.\\n\\nPoor Calvin's serves brunch, lunch, and dinner. Brunch is served weekends, 11:30am-3:00pm. Lunch is served Tuesday-Friday, 11:30am-2:30pm. Dinner is served daily, 5:00pm-11:00pm. I've only visited this restaurant during dinnertime where I've tried a variety of dishes. There's a lot of seafood on the menu including lobster (e.g. lobster wontons, lobster mac & cheese, lobster fried rice). Overall, it's a good variety of food with a significant Thai influence (e.g. curry, lemongrass, satay). At dinner, expect to spend anywhere from $10-15 per appetizer and $20-30 per entree.\\n\\nHere's a list of dishes I've tried:\\n\\nStarters:\\n* Lemongrass Steamed Mussels\\n* Lobster Macaroni and Cheese\\n\\nEntrees:\\n* Ribeye Filet (certified Angus beef) - kale mashed potatoes, vegetables\\n* Grilled Lamb Rack (New Zealand) - kale mashed potatoes, vegetables, Thai curry\\n* Duck Dynasty - seared maple leaf duck breast, grilled shrimp, kale mashed potatoes\\n* Fried Red Grouper Thai Curry (wild caught) - seasonal vegetables, Thai curry, jasmine rice\\n* Fried Chicken (free range airline breast) - lobster mac & cheese, vegetables\\n\\nPresentation is outstanding.\\n\\nThe Lemongrass Steamed Mussels is a terrific appetizer. A generous helping of fresh mussels in a mouthwatering broth is served in a bowl topped with chopped scallions and a slice of toast. This is a great shareable app. Order one for every 2-3 people. The highlight of this dish is the broth, which is distinctly Thai in flavor. It tastes like tom yum soup, which is a spicy and sour Thai soup. The broth is so good, I'd drink it to the last drop.\\n\\nI'm allergic to lobster, but when I saw how good the Lobster Mac & Cheese looked, I just had to try it. Photo: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/poor-calvins-absolute-fusion-atlanta?select=RzCn_Gfz71hF3JrBo55X0A#RzCn_Gfz71hF3JrBo55X0A. Was it worth it? Yes. Creamy and wholesome.\\n\\nIt's hard to pick a favorite from the entrees because they're all really good. The tender Ribeye Filet is served hot and sizzling on a round skillet. Vegetables include kale, asparagus, and bright, slightly sweet Peruvian peppers. The ribeye has a bit of sauce on it and is absolutely scrumptious.\\n\\nThe Lamb is lean, nicely marinated and seasoned, and bursting with hearty flavor. Vegetables include kale, broccolini, and a cheese-stuffed red pepper. This dish is quite satisfying.\\n\\nThe Duck is from Maple Leaf Farms (Indiana). The duck is perfectly cooked and served pre-sliced, each slice topped with a fatty yet luscious piece of skin. Vegetables include crunchy bok choy and asparagus with a bit of cilantro.\\n\\nIf I had to pick a favorite entree, it would be the Grouper Curry. The grouper is nicely fried and resembles a large chicken tender. Both the high quality white fish and the light brown curry sauce are succulent. The curry is creamy and robust in its flavors. Vegetables in this dish include sliced zucchini, mushrooms, eggplant, kale, and cilantro.\\n\\nThe Fried Chicken with lobster mac & cheese is the entree with the obvious Southern take. The boneless and crispy chicken pieces come with broccolini, Peruvian peppers, kale, frisee, and cilantro.\\n\\nService is top notch.\\n\\nPoor Calvin's is on OpenTable so book your reservations through that service to earn free dining points good towards future discounts at any OpenTable restaurant."},{"name":"Launderette","address":"2115 Holly St","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Finally writing my overdue review for the Launderette. Came here with two other friends last month to try the highly rated restaurant. Let's start with the ambiance and decor, the ambiance is great/ super austiny and the decor is sleek with the cutest geometrical chairs at the bar! \\n\\nService was OK, but could be more attentive. Our server forgot to check-up on a few of our dishes so our dinner took way longer than expected (2.5-3 hours). Food and drinks were good, however some dishes definitely fell short. \\n\\nThe good: \\nFried oysters - absolutely delicious! Lightly battered and flavored well + topped off with the lemon coriander dressing was amazing. \\nThe soft egg toast - this was very good. A very fancy toast topped off with an amazing soft boiled egg. However, $14 is a little much for an egg toast. \\nKabocha squash - absolutely delectable! This was really good, did not think that squash could be prepared so well. A must order! \\nChicken thighs - this was crispy and a very juicy thigh. another great dish. \\nThe birthday cake - this is solely the reason why we came to try Launderette. This dessert is exactly what I needed! Loved the sweet cake flavored icecream! \\n\\nThe so-so:\\nThe charred octopus - extremely chewy + burnt = not good. Also for $18, all you get is one tentacle to share. I would not recommend getting this. \\nThe pork ribs + brussels sprouts were OK, nothing special to write about. \\n\\nOverall a good experience at the Launderette.

Additionally, they have wine on tap and free complimentary parking. My major problem with this place is that the food was sub par and mediocre. Our group of four came here for a New Years Eve dinner, and we tried various different small plates and entrees, listed below:\\n\\nSalmon chips - Decent flavor. Nice crunchy chip with flaky salmon chunks on top. One of the better items on their menu.\\n\\nArtichoke - Weird plating with just a cooked artichoke head with small bowl of mayo-type dipping sauce.\\n\\nEmpanadas - Two pieces. Good flavor but not worth it.\\n\\nBurrata salad - Very unimpressive. Burrata cheese was placed bread, making it very soggy, with bunch of random greens on top.\\n\\nTuna - Absolutely terrible. Supposedly sushi grade tuna. We ordered the tuna steak medium rare. The tuna came out chewy and tough. \\n\\nSea scallops - Nice polenta, grits with Gouda and tomato sauce with scallops on top. One of the better entree options as the sauce complemented the sea scallops very nicely.\\n\\nMahi mahi entree (replaced with Swordfish) - Unintended. I ordered Tuna but got served Swordfish, replacement for Mahi Mahi for the night, instead. I informed the waitress that it was not the tuna and sent it back but the waitress and chef was adamant that it was tuna. After tasting the tuna, I took my chances with the swordfish, which was cooked well but the fish did not go well with the other items on the plate. \\n\\nMac and cheese - Terrible. Terrible. Avoid at all cost. Seemed like they took boxed shells and cheese and put it on a plate.\\n\\nWhipped potatoes - Mediocre at best. I've had better at local diners. \\n\\nOverall, food was mediocre, average service,  and absolutely not worth the price. If anything, you are paying for the atmosphere and live music.

Damn Yelpers and their food pics...  lol  You will just have to take my word that my BFF loved his meal and Steak n Shake is now on his list of favorites...  \\n\\nNow for my meal...  The burger was straight up delicious. Kudo's to Steak n Shake for the Cajun Double Steak burger. The Seasoning was something that you might expect in the bayou and a dash of it on top of the bun is a nice touch. The American cheese and Cajun sauce worked well together. Best of all was the texture of the bun because it was still nice and soft but had a bit of crunch from the grill. The fries were perfectly cooked and the Sea Salt n pepper seasoning was a hit with me. \\n\\nFrom the time we sat down to the time we left, our server was a ROCK STAR. I can usually nit pick something the server missed but NOT this time. She not only knew the menu well but knew how to up sell. She had great eye contact the entire time and  always had a smile. She let me know she was still new but you would have never known it. You can bet I will be asking for you the next time Karen! \\n\\nIf you are looking for a gourmet meal, they are NOT the place to go BUT if you want a tasty burger and fries, great service in a diner setting...  Steak n Shake is a winner. I can't speak for the other stores in the area because this location has been consistent over the last 6 plus years I have been coming here.\\n\\nUPDATE\\nOK...  I could not resist coming back for lunch today and made a pig of myself...  My favorite server Rachel was working today ans as usual she spoiled me. As you can see from the pictures, the kitchen was not as picturesque in their plating BUT everything was delicious...  The staff have been busting their humps NON STOP since I arrived and it appears that the lunch rush is finally letting up some. \\n\\nLots of families dining here so this is DEFINITELY a KID FRIENDLY store..."},{"name":"Mary Mac's Tea Room","address":"224 Ponce De Leon Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Food, ambiance, atmosphere and service was amazing!!

I did not begin well. The friendly greeter informed us that there would be at least a 15 minute wait and suggested that we go across the hall to the Cypress Room, as we could expect the same service and menu. \\n\\nWrong! The Cypress Room was understaffed and to the point that we had to bus our own table and wait and wait, as did other like minded folks. Actually, there were a few that skipped to the head of the line, as the harried Cypress Staff had little help or clue what was going on, and were just trying (unsuccessfully) to make order from chaos.\\n\\nWe left and I headed back the the Courtyard where another employee bluntly told me that of course we weren't going to get good dinner service at Cypress! After all, it's only a Bar!. In other words, I was bearing witness to a common Portlandia idiosyncrasy (with thanks to the Animal House Movie): You Fucked Up, You Trusted Us!\\n\\nI immediately asked to speak to the Manager, as it was better to get out my frustrations regarding unacceptable service now instead online later. My Son took off down the hall out of embarrassment. :)\\n\\nThe Manager listened well to what I had to say. I made it clear that all I wanted was fair treatment and to wait my turn, knowing that it would come. She then got my name on the wait list, gave me a light buzzer, and within the originally stated 15 minutes (which I should have done in the first place), we had our seat. No Comps were offered, of which I didn't ask or want. \\n\\nOnce seated, service was fabulous and the food was very good. The Kid had Mac and Cheese (with Chicken) and I went for a Sausage Calzone. We washed all that down with Root Beer and Triple IPA respectively. The acoustics here were also much better than the Cypress Lounge, which was great for intelligent Father-Son conversation. \\n\\nThe Cypress part of the evening was easily a 2 Star experience, which redeemed itself to 4 Stars at the Courtyard. I suspect that McMenamins has a great business model here, especially judging by the happy crowds, not only at the Courtyard and Cypress, but at their other bars at the Kennedy School. But that's not really an excuse to let the hordes overwhelm the service model, is it?"},{"name":"Frank","address":"407 Colorado St","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"This is one of my new Fav. places in Austin!!! I am so glad I found this place on Yelp. This was our first beer stop of the night after our arrival into this great city. Nice draft and bottled beer selection. Our bartenders were extremely friendly, helpful and were slinging out fancy drinks all nights. After a couple of beers, we decided to eat something since we both knew a looooong night of drinking awaited. We ordered the mini corn dogs (with bacon ranch and the Mr. Doppelganger dipping sauces) and the Southern Belle hotdog...YUM! The super juicy hot dog was topped with fried green tomatoes and special sauce. I contemplated ordering either another hot dog or their infamous waffle fries but didn't want to chance getting lethargic.\\n\\nSo we had originally planned to go to Stubbs Gospel Sunday Brunch but ended up switching our focus back on Frank, especially after my eyes saw the reviews of their Red Headed Stranger! Let me tell you, all the awesome reviews are ALL TRUE! It is a bacon infused Bloody Mary garnished with a piece of deep fried bacon, jalapeno stuffed olive, a banana pepper, a cube of cheese and the glass is rimmed with their own special made spices =) OMG, it was sooo good, I texted my bf and told him I was having a love affair with a red headed stranger. Apparently everyone else felt the same way because the bartenders couldn't make enough of them! now, on to the food. They have a wonderful brunch selection. I ordered the fried chicken and bacon waffles....Yes, bacon waffles; the waffle batter is poured over pieces of bacon. Both the chicken and waffles were super tasty. My friend order their eggs Benedict with pulled pork on top of a huge cheddar biscuit, YUM! As much as I wanted to order another delicious bloody mary, I was just way too full........so I opted for the less filling glass of apple mimosa.......followed by a glass of pear mimosa (2 unique flavors that I had never seen before) \\n\\nI hated to say goodbye but can't wait to go back.

I made reservations for two at 7:30pm for a Thursday night to dine with a fellow friend and Yelper, Phong T. They offer complimentary valet parking. There is a small parking lot right next to the restaurant. There is also a few free street parking spots for up to two hours in front of the restaurant. The restaurant looks like a house that they turned into a restaurant and the space is somewhat small and cozy. There is outdoor seating in front of the restaurant. The decor is nice with small chandelier where we sat.\\n\\nSince it was Downtown Atlanta Restaurant Week:(July 18-26, 2015), Poor Calvin's was offering a prix fixe three course menu of $15 for Lunch, or $25, $35, $39 for Dinner. We opted for the $35 prix fixe three course dinner menu.\\n\\nFOOD:\\nDrink:\\n- LYCHEE MARTINI: for all those lychee lovers. When you take a drink, it takes like lychee at first and then you can taste the bitter alcohol taste.\\nAppetizers:\\n- DUCK WONTONS: These were good. I thought they were just a bit salty as duck would be. It comes with a hoisin dipping sauce that you wouldn't need too much of. The outside layer is a fried wonton wrapper stuffed with minced duck and veggies. \\n- LOBSTER MAC & CHEESE: This appetizer was good. It is a very cheesy mac & cheese. There were a few chunks of lobster, a mixture of mainly fusilloni pasta and a few bowtie pasta, and lots of cheese. It was served in a hot black stone casserole dish.\\n\\nEntrees: \\n- PAN SEARED CHILEAN SEA BASS: Phong T. had this entree. I was able to try a bit of the sea bass and it was delish. I loved the broccolini that came with it. There were artichokes in this dish as well. \\n- FRIED RED GROUPER THAI CURRY: Slightly crisp fried grouper that is placed on top of veggies and curry. The veggies were sliced green peppers, cucumbers, baby corn. The garnishes were bean sprouts, sliced carrots, and basil leaves. The dish comes with a side of rice. The dish was good, but I kind of wished I ordered the tiger shrimp and scallop siam stir-fry. \\n\\nDesserts: \\n- SUSPENSION CAKE: a slice of cake with many different components. The bottom layer is a thin layer of moist red velvet, In the middle of the slice, is a large one-inch of chilled cheesecake/cream cheese, and on the top is another thin layer of moist red velvet covered with a thin layer of dark chocolate. It was good, but a bit overwhelming for us with how much cheesecake/cream cheese was in the middle. I would say that this is probably one of their most popular desserts. \\n- TIRAMISU: a slice of tiramisu was placed inside a chilled wine goblet/glass. The tiramisu was bland and we only wanted a bite from it. We saw from other tables that they, too, did not eat more than a bite from their tiramisu.\\n\\nService was good. They were busy for a Thursday night. The host/manager was very nice as he visited tables and asked how the food was.\\n\\nOverall, the food was good, but it doesn't beat the Thai restaurants that I've dined at and frequent."},{"name":"Launderette","address":"2115 Holly St","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Breakfast is the most important meal of the day especially when it is accompanied with bacon!

I think Mary Mac's is an interesting experience. I was alone so found a seat eventually at the bar. The two bartenders were great. I loved the old fashioned crafted by my bartender. One of the best I've had. He also took my dinner order which consisted of fried chicken, fried green tomatoes, sweet potato soufl√©, and turnip greens. The diner sitting beside me suggested I order only the chicken wings. I believe she was correct in her recommendation. She eats at Mary Mac's regularly. And I noticed many others ordering only sides and wings or sides only. In my view the fried green tomatoes were really good. I liked them a lot. The turnip greens were a little too healthy. Where was the pork fat or other fatty meat infusion? But a douse of hot pepper sauce fixed them up nicely. The other sides were good but not memorable. I did order Mac and cheese to go along with peach cobbler. Indeed, I needed to take half of my order to go because there is no skimping on the serving sizes. The peach cobbler was peachy without the taste of cobbler if you understand what I mean. I certainly have had better. On a second trip my companion and I shared ribs and a ground steak. Let's put it this way, the meat is first quality to be sure. But there really was no wow taste in either dish.

We started to wonder if we were supposed to seat ourselves since no one even looked our way. Then the host finally walked to us in no rush at all.\\n\\nWe told him we had a table of 4 and the 4th wasn't here yet. We followed him towards the booths and he was unaware that they hadn't been cleaned off yet. He kept walking and asked us if a table would be okay. I asked my mom if she wanted a table or booth and she said we could wait for a booth while they cleaned it since we were waiting on my dad anyways. There were also multiple booths throughout the restaurant that were set up and ready. Since I work in a restaurant, I understand that there may not be enough servers for those sections on a Sunday evening, but the host did not explain that to us whatsoever. \\n\\nAfter waiting at the front for a few minutes, the host brought us to a table that had already been set up before they told us they were going to clean a booth for us, making this whole interaction redundant. He also only gave us 3 menus after us again telling him we had a 4th coming.\\n\\nAfter finally getting seated, our waitress came and took our drink orders. She asked if we had another coming since my mom ordered my dad's drink, and then said she would be right back with a menu. She never brought a menu and my dad and I had to share one when we were ordering. Being a server, that wasn't a very big deal; sometimes small things like that happen. \\n\\nWe put in an order for an appetizer with our drinks as well. After about 5 minutes and still no drinks, we started to look around for our waitress. She was standing around talking to some other waiters right by our table. She looked as if she had nothing to do and flipped over her long hair, which was not pulled back in any kind of braid or pony tail, and started touching it with her fingers. As a server with long hair, I always keep mine pulled back as health codes require. If I need to adjust it, I always make sure to do it in the bathroom, out of the customers' view, and ALWAYS wash my hands after. She then proceeded to get herself a drink of water and continue to stand and talk. \\n\\nA different boy brought us our appetizer and I asked him about our drinks. A minute later, our waitress brought our drinks to our table, as well as a huge attitude. The rest of the night was filled with no more problems other than her obvious anger and shortness towards us. \\n\\nAs a server, even with the most difficult customers, I at least TRY my best to be polite and respectful. All we did was ask for our long overdue drinks. Instead of a quick apology to us for the late drinks, as a smart server knows they should do, we got a teenage girl with an attitude problem for the rest of the evening. My dad tipped her much more than she should have gotten at 14%.\\n\\nThe experience would have been one star, but as a vegetarian I was pleasantly surprised to have a Beyond Burger on the menu, so that got the extra star."},{"name":"Poor Calvin's","address":"510 Piedmont Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4.5","text":"Excellent food.

One great thing about Voodoo is that they sell Stumptown Coffee to go along with your sweet treats. You also get to cross off 2 foodie locations in one go! The most well known is the Voodoo doll doughnut which is shaped like (you guessed it!) a voodoo doll. It is filled with raspberry jelly to emulate the blood. The doughnuts itself are yeast based and each doughnut is well decorated. I tried the voodoo and the Portland cream and they were just alright. The doughnuts itself are good but the glaze on top is too sweet for my taste. I also thought the Portland cream doughnut could use more cream. It felt like i got one bite of cream and that was it. \\n\\nThe decor of the place is extremely pink and really matches the name.

Yes, I have had two dishes here and they have both been good. Yes, many of the people that work there are nice and friendly, but its my run ins with one women that put such a distasteful note in my mouth that Ive been fuming for a few days now. I go to the Thai noodle house one day when its busy. Now being short ( my feet barely touch the floor) I'm the type to pull up an extra chair and put my leg up on it. Not my foot, my leg. I did this a few weeks ago and a woman ( who at this point had been giving very bad service) zoomed over and demanded I put my leg down. At that point I just got off of an 8 hour Starbucks stint on my feet and was just trying to rest my leg. I complied, thinking maybe they thought it was going to get busy and they needed the chair. I then went outside and did the same thing with the same results. It took almost 40 min to get our food. I was annoyed, but brushed it off as a momentary one time thing. Then came yesterday. Instinctively and not remembering the previous visits situation, I put my leg up, once again the woman zooms over , glares at me and demands I remove it. I do. About 30 min later I accidentally do it again ( at this point its just subconscious.) She zeros in and says loudly \\" I Told you not to put your leg up on the chair.\\" If I wasn't such a classy person I would have walked out without paying the bill. I was pretty well annoyed. Not saying that you should put your legs up every where you go-- but in a college joint with crappy chairs, its not hurting anyone. Wow, I can just imagine if i told someone at Starbucks something like that. The food is decent but the customer service is beyond repulsive.\\n\\n\\nOld review.\\nThe first time I went to Thai Noodle House was on my first date with a new guy. I ordered the pad Thai and found it not palatable.... after several other other attempts ( what can I say, I like to give every restaurant a fair trial..and this one was oh so close to my house at the time) I discovered the DWI - otherwise known as the C8. What is this deliciousness, you ask? Wide rice noodles in a sweet chili sauce with basil and sate. With chicken, pork, beef or tofu. Choices, choices! \\n\\nThis was delicious..and pretty damn addictive. I found myself ordering C8's from the road just to pick them up for take out. Seriously y'all....find your favorite dish here, stay true and spread the word.\\n\\nAdded tip: The parking does suck, so be prepared to maneuver around a bit.

We chose the place because it is open until midnight and I knew I would need food after teaching. I chose a 1/2 Slacker and salad. A Slacker is organic Pinto and black beans blanketing some short-grain, brown rice. You can get jalape√±os, tomatoes and cheese for a little extra. The whole nine yards will set you back $5.75. $8.50 is your bill if you have lavender lemonade. I don't drink coffee when the weather makes me feel like I live on the sun. I will have to wait for a better season to try hot beverages.\\n\\nThe young gentleman behind the bar was very kind, wearing a funny t-shirt and a sincere smile. The menu was grand and utterly vegetarian but not \\"health-food-crazed\\" vegetarian. The basic American cafe fare included omelettes and sammiches with vegan options. Human food without chemical fingers. I sat down with my lemonade, seemingly sweetened with honey or agave. It was sublime. The seating was a little cramped, but I'm not too big a gal, and sat in the mostly vacant, air-conditioned part. I pulled out my laptop while waiting. I was able to hop onto their wi-fi without any issues, no commercials, no fuss. That was enough to send me into paroxysms of joy, and my food had not yet arrived.\\n\\nWhen it did arrive I was almost unable to believe how delicious this humble bowl of rice, beans and condiment-goodness was. Every bite was more and more delicious. Could it have been laced with the drug that would soon allow Boulding Creek to take over the world? Possibly! Would I complain? Never! The meal was perfectly sized for one person and the flavour and textures could not have been closer to paradise. I was astounded.... and I am rarely astounded. I was thinking of asking for seconds, but managed to shake myself back into reality as my friends arrived.\\n\\nThey ordered some coconut limeade concoctions that were also divine and we sat down to our meeting. We were having a great time, laughing and getting lots of scheduling done, when a young woman with her laptop stopped at our table to say, \\"Um, I just wanted to let you guys know that this is a coffee shop. We are studying here, so, um, can you keep it down?\\"\\n\\nThe four of us were slack-jaw stunned.\\n\\nWe at least finished college with honours and most of us have lots and lots of graduate and post-graduate work, etc, yet somehow (or maybe because of those facts) our usual level of wit failed us completely. Clearly the girl was confusing libraries, dorms and coffee shops! Could it be that we missed some great change in the public sphere? No. Maybe the level of entitlement has simply jumped the shark in our culture. Sorry, Bouldin Creek, I had to deduct a star for letting delusional coffee-slurping students harass your food-buying customers who were laughing.\\n\\n\\"But is it irritating enough to take a way the star?\\" you ask. Actually, it does really get under my skin when other customers harass me for overly self-centred reasons (please see my  El Arroyo review). Drunk, disorderly and/or offensive is completely inappropriate in public. Children kicking your seat or running around screaming at the top of their lungs is also inappropriate in public. F-Bomb free laughing? There is no need to create an international crisis. \\n\\nIn spite of the trifle, I can't wait to try the next menu item. what will it be? When can I go to town next? Meanwhile I envy my husband, who is determined to eat there today, due to my unusual level of enthusiasm. Bring me a doggie bag, hon'."},{"name":"Bambudda","address":"99 Powell Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"3.5","text":"First home run during a great trip to Vancouver. After exploring the Gastown area for a bit, we decided to settle in somewhere. Came upon Bambudda and ended up holding it down for about 3 hours.\\n\\nIt's a cool looking place with doors/walls that open up the bar to the sidewalk. I love these type of set-ups because you can sit at the bar while feeling as if you're outside.\\n\\nThe bartenders were absolutely awesome and the drinks followed suit. They have a great alcohol selection first and foremost, add to that the fact that they're all about asking what type of drink you like and then making up something on the fly. My drinks obviously involved some kind of rum mixture and each one was absolutely delicious. Hence the reason why we stayed for 3 hours on a Saturday afternoon... It definitely gave the feeling of being on vacation as opposed just stopping at a cool bar.\\n\\nAfter hours of drinking, I ordered a plate of their \\"La Mein\\". It's basically Chinese Lo Mein, but cooked slightly different with a poached egg in the middle of the noodles. At first it threw me off a bit because it wasn't what I was expecting, but after a few  bites I was hooked it into it. It's not as seasoned as Lo Mein and has more of a natural taste to it. It was really good. Though it could have used a tad less salt..\\n\\nThis was a great experience and an awesome introduction to Vancouver. Definitely recommend this place, especially in the warmer months so you can enjoy the awesome drinks and good food in the open street setup."},{"name":"Bouldin Creek Cafe","address":"1900 S 1st St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"I've come here a couple times now.

It's cute in it's attempt to come off as quaint and the animal paintings on the wall depicting them as human beings is always thought-provoking and entertaining. We ordered some coffee (bottomless for $2.50) and it was delicious. We both drank multiple cups and then have been offered a fresh cup in a to-go cup. The coffee is enough reason for me to return again and again. \\n\\nFor the food, I've tried the veggie royale which was okay and plenty big, but the grilled cheese that Kermie got was 5 stars awesome. Best grilled cheese I've tried. The hummus plate was actually pretty good, and I'm quite the hummus slut these days. I've also tried the goyo taco (organic red & black beans, local tomatoes, sprouts & cheese) which I will totally pass on next time. Too much sprouts, but I gave it a shot. I actually really liked the tofu scrambler taco, and I will definitely get it again but add the veggie chorizo with it. I thought it had plenty of flavor without the salsa (which wasn't spicy anyways), but then again I've been on the \\"dark side\\" long enough that I actually TASTE food these days, versus covering it with so much unnecessary added calories. \\n\\nIt's always very interesting to me when people say meatless meals are bland. When you think about it, it's just how we're brought up and we're conditioned to throw salt and so much seasonings on things, that if you just took the time to actually taste the natural flavor of something, you'd be surprised to know how unique some things taste when you lose the salt, tobasco, etc etc. Maybe I'm just on another level these days...either way, I really like this place.

Our waiter was very friendly and also educated on the historic significance of the establishment. He took considerable time out to give us a sampling of the building and restaurant's historic interests and was also knowledgeable concerning our menu. We both ended up getting a bowl of clam chowder ($9.50) which came with a healthy sized hunk of fresh warm cornbread. Living near San Francisco, I'm picky about my clam chowders. This was some of the creamiest clam chowder I have ever enjoyed. Extremely well done.

We sat at the bar on the cute little booth seat. We were just looking for some evening snacks/ dinner and some time to relax. \\n\\nThe atmosphere of the restaurant is very unique and eye-catching. The restaurants colors are ones that you would not normally find. The colors are sort of reminiscent of Christmas colors but not quite. The decor is a mixture of quirky and nostalgic bar decor. The music was awesome. That night there was not a song I didn't know. They played lots of early 2000s punk and rock. It was nice to have such familiar jams on. It was just much a sing along between bites kinda night. \\n\\nThe staff were all super friendly. Our server was the bartender. She was very helping in helping us decide to get the breakfast quesadilla. Our food came out quick and delicious.\\n\\nThe food was amazing! We had gotten the vegan nachos with the impossible meat on top. You could never tell it was all veggie. The nachos were definitely something that I would come back for along with the other item that we got which was the breakfast quesadilla. The maple sour cream was to die for!!!  The quesadilla was definitely my favorite.\\n\\nMy favorite part about this restaurant is the friendly toast accommodates both vegetarians vegans and meat eaters under the same roof which is not always easy. It seems to me that most of their meals are designed to be able to switch interchangeably. If you picked a burger that wasn't veggie you could change it out for an impossible burger and still get the same burger without the meat.  Or if you have a dairy allergy they have vegan cheese.

Went here on a Saturday because of great reviews. Could not get a reservation so asked if walk-in was possible. Was told yes so arrived forty minutes before opening in hopes of getting a table. The first thing the greeter said was that they would seat us but our table was reserved for 6:00 p.m. so we would have to give up table at that time. We should have turned around then!!!!! Don't let the reviews tempt you to dine here when customer service is sub-par. My money is as good as the next guys and my table came with no discounts. If you can't provide every customer a five-star experience, don't seat them. When customers call, tell them not to come because you have given all the seats away to those who have made reservations!!!!! My fianc√©s' salmon was raw in the middle. We were simply told that they cook it to one temperature and that's how they do it - no apologies, no concern. He couldn't eat it and they could care less. When we ordered salmon at another restaurant last night, they asked what temp we would like it!!!!! I went to a lot of trouble to dine here and it was in no way worth it! When some businesses get popular  because of their yelp reviews, they throw customer service out of the window. This is one of those places.\\n\\nIn response to the response that management posted to my review, the lack of care for your customers continues. I had already waited forty minutes in your parking lot to be told I could eat there if I hurried up. You are not acknowledging that is a poor way to treat customers that are trying to support your business. Your waitress and manager did not ask about my fianc√©s' salmon. I had to summons them and report that it was not fully cooked. When checking online, we found govt guidelines suggesting salmon be cooked to 145 degrees, which yours was not. The waitress said, that's how we cook it and left the table. The manager said she would take it back to the kitchen but my fianc√© did not trust them taking his food back to the kitchen. If the food was fine, he would not have left the entire plate there. We had to stop at another dining establishment to get dinner for him. I am not trying to trash your business. This was our honest experience. I own the fact that we should have left after being greeted so rudely. You should tell people on the phone that you are booked and won't be able to service them well and that you only prepare salmon that is raw in the center before they order it!!!"},{"name":"XLB","address":"4090 N Williams Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"Good, but honestly don't know if I would go back.

I thought, random, but OK.  I then went to my friends place in Smryna that same evening, and guess where we went for dinner- The Crafty Hog.  What are the odds never hearing of it before?!\\n\\nMy friend was hungry, and he kept telling me stories of their pastrami.  How it was sooo good, but so greasy.  He literally said he would go to the bathroom minutes after eating it.  This was on multiple occasions.  With my judgment not being at 100%, this absolutely captivated me.\\n\\nMy friends brought their dogs, as they have a large outdoor area (with sand, just a heads up) complete with dog bowls for water, and carabineers to hold your dogs leash while you eat.  While I never actually went inside, I was impressed of the size outdoor.  They also had horseshoe pits as well.\\n\\nWe waited a few minutes before a server came (one of my friends did go inside to let the host know we were outside- as sign recommend we do). And took our drink and app order.  I just stuck with water (I already had a few drinks in me).  We ordered some pretzels, and a southern fry for apps.  For dinner, we ordered the \\"Tour of the Smoker\\" which pretty much had servings of- ribs, smoked wings, brisket, pork (pulled), chicken (shredded), turkey, fries, and 3 sides.   After learning about the pastrami, we also added 2 orders of it.  The tour feeds 8-10 people, there were 5 of us. LOL.\\n\\nThe apps came out, along with the drinks.  Here, they use paper plates and plasticware (at least for what we ordered with).  Since it was starting to get cooler there was condensation building up, there was only 1 other party outside.  But to me, the temperature was perfect.  We had to get a roll of paper towels too- they did not have them outside.\\n\\nThe southern fry was decent- it was a mix of fried pickles, peppers, and okra.  Nice mix.  The pretzels were great too- along with the dip.  The food came out, and I was shocked at how much came out.  It looked like a hotel pan of sides and a trash can lid of meat.  \\n\\nI started passing around everything, and noticed- the turkey was dry, and the chicken was dry too.  So was the pork.  I also noticed though there was no sauce- not sure if they had it on tables inside or not.  But some of the meats could have def been rehydrated with sauce.  The brisket and wings were solid.  I was told the ribs were too.\\n\\nThe sides were plentiful- we ordered the brussel sprouts, mac, and creamed corn.  The sprouts and corn were decent, did not try the mac.  I also did not try the fries either.  I was wondering though, where was the pastrami?  It never got put in, but they finally brought it out.  I think I ate my fair share of pastrami (more on that in a few).  We got stuffed, so put a few items in a box, paid, and went on our way.  Our server was really friendly, and wished me a happy birthday.\\n\\nOn our way home, my stomach started bubbling bad.  And then I got to my friends house- which I apologize I usually don't talk about this stuff, but this deserves a mention.  I started having gas.  To a point, I cleared the tv room, and kitchen.  The dog sitting on my lap started to get upset.  When I left, they even said, \\"Tom, you smell AWFUL\\".  My friend wasn't kidding about that pastrami.  2 days later, my eyes and nose are still recovering...\\n\\n3.5 stars here.  I liked the concept of the dog patio.  The sand isn't fun getting out of your car.  Meats were average, sides and apps were good.

I waited 15 minutes before they were edible and they had a good flavor (thus the two stars) and were filled with an orange cheese rather than cream cheese like you would expect. Still I ate them all since it was the only edible thing I received. I ordered a pepperoni calzone and asked them to add mushrooms. They didn't. It was in a puddle of grease that bled all the way through the cardboard box, which was surprising since it was undercooked yet somewhat burned (not sure how that happens). The cheese wasn't melted, the pepperoni was cold, and the inside dough was raw, as you can see in the photos. Additionally there was a tiny container of pizza sauce for dipping but it wasn't nearly enough for the whole calzone. It didn't matter since it was inedible and I had to throw it out.

Went on a Sunday night and the line was still out the door.

Oh and just a head's up, you may also come across some random homeless people in the vicinity. Now that the formalities have been said..off to the good stuff...them donuts, son!\\n\\nTried a few:\\nBacon Maple Bar - My fave of the bunch! Was a bit skeptical bc the 2 strips of bacon were just slapped on there...but my oh my - the tasty bacon + the maple glaze = complete and utter foodgasm! THE perfect blend of sweet & salty. While the maple bacon doughnut over at Blue Star was far more appealing to the eye, the Bacon Maple Bar from Voodoo was by far much tastier. \\n\\nOld Dirty Bastard - had to get it out of respect for it's namesake! A few bites were quite tasty..but after awhile too sweet for this fan.\\n\\nCaptain my Captain - aka the Captain Crunch doughnut. Thought this would be way to sweet..but mmm delicious. Loved the crunch from the cereal. Perfect with a nice cup of coffee!\\n\\nTriple Chocolate Penetration - aka the Cocoa Puffs doughnut. Ehhh..maybe we had a bad batch..but the cocoa puffs tasted a bit stale on ours. Pass.\\n\\nPortland Cream - yum! Is it blasphemy to say this is just like a Boston Cream doughnut? Hehe whatever you want to call it, loved the bavarian cream filling!\\n\\nThere's a little revolving case that shows most of the doughnuts available if you haven't seen all the gazillion pics on Yelp.

I was able to reserve the Fenway room and part of the lounge (for a room fee of $500, yikes, but totally worth it) for a group of 30 people.  We were also able to estimate our attendance and give a final count 3 days in advance.  By only offering beer and wine, we avoided the additional bar tender fee, and still had a very nice person serving the drinks from behind a table.  The staff was polite and helpful throughout the night and we were able to do a gift exchange and have a toys for tots donation table.  A live band began playing pleasant, but not too loud, music at 8:30...  oh, and of course the view was amazing!  \\n\\nCons:  By not having a traditional bar set-up, or perhaps just to make us drink more, I was not able to easily receive a status of how many beverages we had consumed throughout the night.  Also, the price per person for a reception menu is $45 (no drinks included).  This includes a stationary display (very small cheese and cracker plate) and 5 selections for butlered hor d'oeurves at 72 pieces each (we had Figs with Gorgonzola, Spring Rolls, Coconut Chicken, Asparagus wrapped in proscuitto, and scallops wrapped in bacon).  This is their pre-set menu, and was no where near enough food for a cocktail reception.  While the food was good, there were very small pieces and it all went quickly leaving people asking for more.  Being that this is a pre-set menu and is charged per person, I did not think I'd have to worry about having enough food to everyone. \\n\\nAlso, there are a few hidden fees to be aware of.  The administrative fee ($200 for us) takes care of set-up break-down after the party and even though gratuity is included, that line is very small on the receipt and there is a larger space for additional tip.   They validate parking, but it is still $12 in the Prudential Center lot.  \\n\\nI would love to have another event here, but due to the fact that I had to combine two months budget to pay for the drink tab and room rental fee, that likely will not happen unless it's another Holiday party.

Although, after reading other Yelp reviews about the cereal doughnuts being stale, I'll avoid those.

The lines are long, and most of the people that will be waiting on line with you will probably be a tourist, like yourself. The lines did move steadily enough, though, but it would probably help you and your fellow patrons if you had made up your mind about what to order before getting to the register. Which really baffled me: people would be waiting on line for 20+ minutes and only at the register, start to think about what to order.\\n\\nAnyway, this location seems to be a doughnut churning factory. The bf and I ended up getting one of their voodoo dolls, of course, along with a bacon maple bar, a Oh Captain, My Captain doughnut, and a buttermilk bar. I also got one of their coffees, which was a pretty good cup of coffee. We saw at one of the tables outside the establishment as the inside was way too packed with people to try to even eat our treats at. I tried the voodoo doll first, and it was a pretty good doughnut: the dough was fresh and yeasty, and the frosting, while being pretty sweet, paired well with the jelly filling. The bf loved his bacon maple bar, and the other two, we had the next day. \\n\\nWas it the best doughnut I ever had? No, but it was still pretty good. It's silly and maybe a bit overrated, but it's pretty darn Portland-esque, and if you're really bothered with the lines, you can try to go really early in the morning as it is open 24 hours on most days.

He suggested some of the more popular entrees and we proceeded with a bottle of wine for the table. \\n\\nI ordered the scallop dish based on my cousin's recommendation and the scallops were outstanding. Three scallops served on top of mashed potatoes and served with a crisp yuca or like vegetable.

Cooked perfectly- tender and crisp glaze on the outside. \\n\\nThe real dish of the night was the lamb shank! We all had to try the best looking dish and it tasted even better than what we expected.

Dinner took a very long time to arrive, more than 30 minutes to arrive while appetizers took 10 minutes max. Appetizer portions are quite small, each dish is good for about 1 person. For dinner, the $40 stew tasted mediocre but the ravioli and wellington were really great. The lobster mac and cheese was good but you could probably have better at Quincy Market. Dinner portions are however very filling. You won't need more than one dish per person. \\n\\nDessert was the star of the night. Impeccable and they come quickly. The creme brulee's coating had the perfect amount of crunch and was heavenly. The blueberry cake paired with the lemon sauce was to die for.\\n\\nWe were there on Monday night so the restaurant was only about 1/2 full. I noticed the white male waiter socializing a LOT more comfortably with customers of his own race just several feet away from us, which was unprofessional. However they were all female while our table had mix genders so hopefully it was just a boundary thing.\\n\\nOverall, other than the seafood stew all the dishes tasted perfect. Dinner took a very long time to come and the service was average. He came to check often enough but was guarded and showed bias for different tables.

We found an online review:  Price fix menu with three entree choices, one of which was a traditional Thanksgiving meal...roast turkey, dressing, mashed potatoes, rolls, cranberry sauce and choice of Thanksgiving type desserts...$65... at Gracie's, the Hotel Deluxe dining room.  When I called to book a table for two for 3 PM Thanksgiving Day, it was mentioned it was $85 per person, and they wanted credit card guarantee to hold the table and if I cancelled less than 72 hours ahead of the reservation my card would be charged the full amount.  How charming! I told her it was listed as $65 online, and to have the restaurant manager call me. \\n\\nThe next day I did receive a call from the manager, who said the online mention was from 2017 and the prices is now $85.  I asked her to describe exactly what the dinner included....she said there would be a choice of salads and appetizers, then choice of 3 entrees, one of which was a traditional roast turkey dinner with garlic mashed potatoes, gravy, green beans, dressing made with sausage, hazelnuts and chanterelles, hot rolls and a choice of three traditional desserts  I said we wanted absolutely traditional as advertised, and would there be a traditional sage dressing available without the hazelnuts and mushrooms, and she assured me they would have that as an option.  I asked if we could have mashed potatoes without the garlic and she said, \\"of course, we make them to order...\\".  I asked what wine(s) or beverages were included and she said all beverages were extra.  Again I said that was a very high price for that meal, so we expected it to be very special.  She assured me, it would be very special indeed.  I booked it  \\n\\nWe arrived a few minutes before 3 PM but the dining room was not open so we waited in the lobby of the hotel until 3:20 when they announced the dining room was open.  As we ordered the meal, we emphasized we wanted non-garlic mashed potatoes as promised by the manager,  but our server e said they'd already been made, only garlic available.  We asked to have traditional dressing, and she said not to worry they had a vegetarian option without the sausage  Oh well, too late to find another restaurant, but in hindsight, we should have left then.  Big mistake.  The entire experience was a disappointment...the cocktails and wine we ordered were grossly overpriced and one cocktail had to be sent back as it bore no resemblance to the real thing.  Salad was quite nice, however, a crab salad.  Bread basket wasn't hot rolls as on the menu, but regular yeast rolls, sliced bread and two small pats of butter.  The entrees were nicely plated but both were less than mediocre.   We had ordered two of the entree choices:  One turkey, the other prime rib.  The beef was spongy, tepid and tasteless and accompanied by the same sides as the turkey plating.  The greatly hyped traditional turkey dinner appeared with two slabs of white meat draped over a mess of what looked like pulled pork--the dark meat, one assumes.  A tablespoon or or so of tasteless gravy was drizzled over the turkey (a meal where gravy is traditionally a beverage, the gray gluey mound of garlic mashed potatoes was reminiscent of library paste, and barely warm served alongside a scattering of almost-raw green beans.  The traditional dressing was tepid, practically tasteless and anything but traditional.  The cranberry sauce was equally unremarkable--undoubtedly from a can of Ocean Spray.  Dessert, pecan pie for one, pumpkin for the other, what a surprise, was delightful.  Or perhaps we were so hungry, having barely touched our meals, we were glad to have something edible.  We ordered two cocktails, two glasses of unremarkable wine and one coffee.  The total bill?  $275!  And....a 17% gratuity was added, followed by a puzzling \\"service charge\\" of what we figured out to be the gratuity--just listed twice!  Our server was apologetic but said the service charge was the same as the gratuity.  We felt badly for her because she'd been very professional, but we would have left at least a 20% tip, but as the gratuity was already added, and the total was outrageous, we just paid and left.  It was special, all right, it was especially bad.  Over-promised, under-delivered is Gracie's.  Never again.  The next day, yesterday, still hungry for a traditional turkey meal, we went to wonderful old Huber's on SW 3rd/Oak in downtown Portland (where we should have gone Thursday) and for $20.95 each, we enjoyed the real deal--fabulous and every bit as good as your grandmother used to prepare.

The staff was bringing chairs from the restaurant and stealing cushions from other tables trying to reconfigure people to stuff everyone in.  The reality is the just didn't have enough seating for everyone.  '\\n\\nThe wait staff was nonexistent we waited in total 45 minutes to get some one to come and take our drink order. They had no advertised special and we were handed no menu for appetizers or even a drink menu.

That is why I am so surprised to be giving by CHLOE a 4. I came here with a friend for lunch and was pleasantly surprised by several elements of the expedience...the unique options, the taste, the aesthetic, and the service. \\n\\nSETTING: by CHLOE has a great overall aesthetic with modern seating, tables, light fixtures, and wall decor. In the window, you will notice the 4 hanging wicker chairs that are surprisingly comfortable. They also have outdoor season for when the weather is good. \\n\\nFOOD: For a vegan restaurant, I was pleasantly surprised by the variety of options they provided, including salads, burgers/sandwiches, and brunch. We asked what they recommended and so we ordered the Guac burger, which was a black bean-quinoa-sweet potato Patti with guac and chipotle aioli. The patty was spiced really well and there was a generous layering of guacamole. I also got a side of sweet potato fries which were on the soggy side but still tasted great. Perhaps my favorite things were the two dipping sauces they offered, a beet ketchup (which was on the sweet side) and a chipotle aioli. Both were unique options to dip our fries and the burgers in. \\n\\nMy friend works in design and he commented several times on how well-designed everything was, including the WiFi landing page (clearly something they pay attention to). \\n\\nI would definitely come back to by CHLOE"},{"name":"Rosie's Coffee Cafe","address":"2330 Sylvan Rd","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"RUDE MANGER ALERT  This was my 2nd time visiting this cafe.

I sort of made fun of people that went here, and every time I passed by and saw the long lines I shook my head and just couldn't understand it. The only time I would go inside would be if I had someone visiting from out of town.  In that way, I guess it's sort of like how many Orange County natives (myself) couldn't care less about going to places like Disneyland, but may get dragged there when visitors are in town.\\n\\nBut then I started noticing that wherever I go, a lot of Voodoo-like copycats have sprung up in other major cities. Visually, they all take a backseat to Voodoo. Some are better than others, and add in their own touches, but the influence is unmistakable. Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, right?\\n\\nSo, yeah it's cheesy in many ways, but it's still a strong 4 stars for the variety and originality.  Since my fave is the ODB (peanut butter + Oreos, mmmm) and I like to pretend to smoke the Maple Blunt (that's why we get this one, right?  the taste ain't much) the Rapper's Delight for $4.20 (which also includes the M&M - Marshall Mathers - doughnut) is a great deal.  After that, feel free to throw in something else random. I tend to shy away from the cereal-topping based ones as I feel they're sort of stupid.

Well, I finally made it there (still no gf) with a couple friends a couple months back.\\n\\nI was a little confused when we turned into what seemed to be the parking lot of a warehouse complex full of nice cars before realizing that was where the restaurant was.\\n\\nAtmosphere/ambiance/whatever:\\n\\nQuite nice. The restaurant is located within a warehouse and does a good job of balancing the character of the original structure with some modern detail. Aside: this restaurant-in-a-warehouse seems to be an Atlanta thing, which I'm becoming increasingly appreciative of. The interior is a little dim, but makes a nice use of natural lighting. Very comfortable interior, large open area, though a little bit of a maze. I say that because I got lost going to bathroom, but I'm awful with directions. \\n\\nOh, and the entire place smells amazing. \\n\\nFood n' Drinks:\\nVery good and also a very good value (despite me not paying for it). The calamari we had was well done-- the right balance of crunchy batter, and the squid itself was very fresh-- not too chewy or mushy. \\n\\nI had the swordfish. It was delicious. Yup, I think that about covers it. But for the sake of the review: very fresh fish and cooked very nicely-- moist and flaky, like a nicely cooked piece of salmon without the strong flavor. The other bits were nice complements to the fish, both visually and taste-fully. The greens were a bit of a palate cleanser and a nice crunch, while the pepper sauce was a lovely golden color, and provided a creamy peppry (duh) contrast to the fish. The fries were also nice.\\n\\nI got a drink as well-- something like an Old-fashioned which was quite good as well.\\n\\nTl;dr:\\nNice: great, want to go back and try other things\\nMean: great, want to go back and try other things"},{"name":"Mary Mac's Tea Room","address":"224 Ponce De Leon Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"This place was hands down the best soul food I tried in ATlanta.

The cook obviously did not know how to keep the tenderness of mahi mahi, which is not easy.\\n\\nAt least based on my experience, the cook's cooking level is significantly below average 4 star restaurants such as tuk tuk in Buckhead. If I have to give a rating to the tastes, 2.5 would be appropriate. I would say it is better than panda express but worse than Chief Chen. I do not mean Chief Chen is very good, on the other hand, I'd only give Chief Chen 3.5 stars. \\n\\nYes, Atlanta, unlike bay area of Cali, has very few good Asian restaurants.

There were to many onion rings. Clear impression I got is that there is lack of oversight to the proper method of frying food, and frequent use of old oil.

To get into the spirit we ordered a round of caipirinhas.   These are made with cacha√ßa (a rum like liquor), with sugar, lime juice and muddled mint; very similar to a mojito.  These were sweet, but delicious. \\n\\nWe sampled the salad bar, which was nicely appointed with a great variety of crisp, fresh salad ingredients plus several other choices like crab salad, beets and outstanding house-marinated mushrooms.  You always need to be conservative with the salad bar, because there's plenty of meat to try! \\n\\nIt's the typical churrascaria service, with roaming waiters with skewers of rotisserie-roasted meat, sliced to order tableside.

So we wound up here this afternoon to see what Laoshandong has to offer. We ordered a large size no. 2 (half meat half tendon noodle soup), large order of pork/veg dumplings, a cucumber cold dish and seaweed cold dish. The noodle soup was above average in our opinion, noodles could have had a bit more chew.. but the soup had a lot of depth of flavour and a nice sweetness, likely from lobok or carrots. The portion was huge, and the cuts of meat/tendon were very generosu as well. Overall the flavour is still not the same as what you would find in China, but fairly close for Vancouver standards. Cold cucumbers and seaweed were very flavourful and likely marinated overnight, I highly recommend ordering atleast one cold veggie dish to go with your noodles to cut the oil and strong flavour of the soup. Skip the dumplings though... the wrappers were factory made skins, much too thick, and the filling was not juicy or flavorful enough for our liking. Total bill came to $32 and we had dumplings leftover to take home, this place is definitely budget friendly and away from all the chaos of the Crystal Mall food court next door.

This should be under ambiance, but the music was so good that it needs to have its own section. A live band was playing perfectly fit blues and soul music. Old music. Not shitty 90's covers that you keep hearing everywhere. The band was so good that I would pay to see them.\\n\\n3. The food! Our food was delicious. Two people ordered the brisket and loved it.

It was a Saturday night, pretty busy and there were a lot of people there including the women's US olympic basketball team. The food is what everyone has said - amazing, presentation is great, pricing is good and a total must visit spot for a true foodie, I have nothing bad to say. \\n\\nThe service however was my main issue, our server was good- no complaints there, but the hostess was perhaps the worst representation a restaurant of this caliber can have as the first and last person you see leaving your establishment. The hostess stand is really small and very close to the bar where we were seated to await a table, there were two hostesses, one was slim and had long black hair, the other was shorter a bit rounder and had shorter curlier hair. I witnessed as did many others, one of the hostesses yelling at the other and giving major attitude in front of so many guests. The slimmer hostess looked to be new, but was the only one to welcome us and smile upon our arrival. I am not sure what she did wrong, but there is never a reason to yell and belittle someone in front of others. I know a few other patrons actually called the manager and spoke with him about it. I felt bad for the other girl, it was embarrassing and uncalled for. When we left the hostess we witnessed yelling seemed to be in a bad mood and said nothing to us as we exited the restaurant, no smile it was very cold. I say all this to say while dining out at four other restaurants the last week and a half, I never witnesses that not even once. The person who is the first and last you see, should be a factor in making you return to the establishment.

Since we were in a time crunch to make the airport we were quick to order. I went for the Tom Yum soup as a starter because anytime I see it on the menu I have to try it. It was delicious with the right amount of heat and spice, the only thing I wish it had was more protein as there was only one large shrimp in the bowl. \\n\\nMy friend wanted to try one of their signature cocktails, so she ordered the Lychee Martini. It was sweet made with kettle one vodka and a lychee and grapefruit liquor. \\n\\nThe stars of the show were certainly our main courses. We went with the Crispy Beef, and it was unforgettably good. We were obsesed with the texture of the beef, it had a nice crunch and were generous portions of angus beef tip. We also ordered a Chicken Thai Curry dish which was creamy and delicious with a good balance of spice to cream. Next time, because there will definitely be a next time, I will order the Pineapple Fried Rice, and the Fried Chicken with Lobster Mac and Cheese. \\n\\nAs if things weren't delicious enough, we decided we couldn't leave without trying one of their desserts. Without any pictures or anything except the description from our waiter, we went with the Toasted Pound cake, and when it was brought out we just about shed a tear. It was picture perfect, almost too good to eat. It was a house-made liquor ice cream on top of lychee pound cake and mixed with fresh fruit doused in a lime green sauce. I don't even fully know what we were eating, but it was so outstanding we didn't even care before we scarfed it down.\\nThe meal was excellent, one of my favorites from our trip to Atlanta.

Daniel, part owner, was very helpful and was seen walking around the dining room touching tables and visiting with guests in the parlor area that sells dry goods and groceries.  Great Sunday Brunch menu, second week into brunch, and running smoothly.  What sets it apart, after seeing guests walk in and walk out after seating, a fresh-homemade menu and simple.  For those of you that are expecting 30-40 choices, this is not it.  There are about 15 items you can order ala cart for 2.00-5.00 bucks.  Then below that, are special menu entrees and rotating flights and specials of the day.  We had fried chicken and waffles, dark meat requested. 4 out of 5.  The chicken fried antelope with gravy and scrambled eggs and corned beef hash and cheese biscuit with gravy, 5 out of 5 for a breakfast item.  The pancake rolled fresh handmade sausage with apple butter, 4 out of 5.  Only thing, keep ice filled in drinks!  Another young lady, walking the bar and grocery area, was very friendly and helpful  She mentioned the growth and ideas that they had were to open a full grocery and butcher shop in house to sell their house made sausage varieties to go.  The place is open 10-2am with a limited menu after 10pm during the week and saturday.  Their brunch menu cannot be found online, but I'll be back to try: plenty of their side dishes and the boudin cake and crawfish gravy, the shrimp and grits, the omellete of the day, the egg-chili cheese souffle, the other variety of sausages and all their savory alcoholic drinks, many infused with bacon or produce.

I finished all 3 and didn't feel full so I don't believe the value is there for the price.\\nBut to end on a bright note, this local business is working hard and I was greeted with a genuine smile.

We love getting types of fish that aren't too fishy like Cod, Halibut, and Grouper (this may vary based on what's in season).

We haven't been in awhile and were craving some good empanadas. We had bad service from that moment we walked in up until we left. We sat all the way in the back corner of the restaurant and our server was so RUDE and didn't listen to what we actually wanted. I asked for a CRANBERRY juice that is it which included FREE refills. She kept asking if I wanted Mora Agua. My friends and I said in BOTH Spanish and English ( I don't speak Spanish so my friend helped me out so she could understand ) NOOOO we said just REGULAR CRANBERRY juice which was $2.29. I got what I thought was cranberry juice and 1 refill. When receiving my receipt she charged me for Mora Agua which had NO free refills and she charged me for the second one which was $3.19. That was just the first thing that was wrong. On the menu my friend and I both ordered 4 empanadas which was $5.59 on the menu. Once I received my receipt for that they were charging me $7.00 for 4 empanadas! Ridiculous!!! When explaining this to the RUDE server she didn't seem to care and just ignored us snatching my receipt away from me and walking away. We decided to go pay up at the register. We explained to the cashier the price of the empanadas was not the price on the menu. She began to tell they don't have that special anymore for $5.59. We insisted she grab a menu and look. With an attitude she grabbed and menu realizing we were over charged so she adjusted our meals to the CORRECT price. When explaining about my drink she said she would only take one drink off but I had to pay the extra $1.00 I was charged for the first drink. Even though that isn't what we told her I wanted. I told the cashier but I asked for just cranberry juice nothing special. She told me in a RUDE tone. Look I am trying to help you out. Being that I have worked in the food industry, retail, customer service I feel she should have comp my drink totally or discounted the drink to the $2.29 price due to her server not understand from 3 people what I actually wanted! I feel this was VERY HORRIBLE service and I refuse to tip someone who was RUDE from the start, couldn't get the price of a meal, or the drink right. She seemed to busy to deal with us and just seemed to want to gossip. When leaving the cashier walked over to our server telling her that we all didn't tip and gossiping about us. Which we didn't care and won't be coming back. For whoever is running this place you need to change up the staff, the food prices, and the way your servers treat the customers as it is the customers fault they messed up.

Then my heart goes soft because my favorite weiner dog is named Frank, he is the best! Anyways, our service was EXCELLENT. Our waitress was really patient with us since 2 of us had never been there before, and the rest of us were being really picky on what we wanted to drink. Moonpie and I decided on some Mexican martinis with some don julio's tequila. Our waitress graciously went to bartender to find out how much it would cost since they didn't have one directly on their drink menu. I regret not trying one of their signature cocktails. However, the martini was decent. But I found it odd that our $8 martinis turned into $10 ones because on our bill they charged $2 extra to make it on the rocks?! WTF isn't it supposed to be easier to make being on the rocks? The beers were very reasonly priced for foreign ones, at least. Tecate for $3!\\n\\nWe proceeded to order a plethora of foods to try. The bill was over $100 for 5 people! Some of the things that I tried and can comment/suggest are: the chilli cheese fries (no sour cream thanks), the cheese fries (O HOW I LOVE WAFFLE FRIES!!!) and I my \\"entree\\" was the chili cheese dog. For a $4 hot dog, it looked pretty freakin good. I regret not  \\"porking it\\" though. My weiner was waaayyyyy tooooo rubbery! I'm surprised I didn't hear many \\" Thats what she said\\" since I complained way too much. It was hard to bite into and successfully separate the weiner from the bun. I then tried to cut my hot dog since it kept falling apart in my hands. No success there either. I felt like I needed some vamp teeth to cut the weiner. I ended up ditching the weiner and ate the chili, cheese and bun alone. Bummer. I almost said our favorite quote we love to hate on: \\"I really wanted to love this place,\\" but I'm not going to say it...o wait I just did.\\n\\nDan the man got some cream soda alcoholic drink that I refused to try, but apparently it was jam packed with alcohol since this light weight was totally buzzed after one drink. The fried pickles and spicy ranch were yummy though. My favorite of course was the waffle fries, the bowls of them were HUGE for a pretty good price. And I also tried the chocolate covered bacon (I was forced) and I must say as weird as it sounds to even eat, I didn't totally hate it. But I wouldn't order it, not being a huge bacon lover in the first place. \\n\\nCool spot to drink and have some appetizers at though. I will need to try a different hot dog next time.

It's been getting a ton of buzz, so naturally, I want to check it out.  My girlfriend chose this restaurant for her birthday dinner this past weekend.  We ended up being a large party of 10 - we had a couple of extra girls tag along, so we were very pleased the staff was willing and able to accommodate our last minute change and add two extra chairs to the table.  \\n\\nWe started with some wine.  I tried the Sauvignon Blanc, Giesen, Marlborough 2015, which was nice.  While we perused the menu, the staff brought out the yummiest rolls.  Perfectly soft  with a sort of crisp salty top.  YUM.  Several of the girls at the table ordered the kale salad, and they were all sort of moaning, so I take that as a sign that it's delicious.  Since I'm the non-seafood eater at the seafood restaurant, I anticipated my options being limited, and they were.  If you're not a fish person, your choices are a half chicken, a steak, or a few yummy sounding sides.  I'm never going to turn down a steak, and I'm glad I didn't.  It was cooked to perfection and very tasty.  I WILL try almost anything deep fried, and a couple of the girls ordered the fish & chips.  I took a bite of theirs, and I will definitely be returning so I can have it again.  It's a HUGE portion of fish on top of hand cut, seasoned fries, served with a delicious malt vinegar aioli.  I also had a bite of the mahi-mahi and liked it!  Maybe I'm converting.  We rounded out our meal with the hushpuppies, which are basically little donut holes.  SO. GOOD.  I kind of piggied out on those. \\n\\nAs for the vibe, the restaurant is a bit loud. We were at a large round table, and there was no way I could carry on a conversation with anyone other than the person on either side of me.  It's a gorgeous setting, though.  On Saturday, they had a beachy-ish band playing outside, which added to the fun vibe.  Service was good.  Our server did very well considering our large party.

Still, I love wings and was in the mood yesterday so I came in.  \\n\\nIt was busy at 1230 on a Friday, but not packed.  Service was a little slow because of that, but generally good, and friendly.  I started with the onion rings I'd heard raves about.  And- good not great.  Crispy, decent, but not amazing.  The \\"Woody's sauce\\" is creamy and slightly tangy, and again, nothing special.\\n\\nI ordered 10 \\"Hawaiian Heat\\" wings, which show as medium heat on their chart.  They arrived with a sticker that said \\"Hawaiian Habanero,\\" which made me sit up and take notice.  But- almost no heat.  Like, not noticeable, even less than the barely hot onion ring sauce.  Oh, well.  Decent size, meaty wings, well cooked.  The sauce was pretty much a sweet and sour.  Once again, good not great.  For a wing place, I was disappointed that they weren't better.  \\n\\nYou pay extra for celery, and the price for 10 wings seemed excessive.  Expensive for what you get.  But, it's not bad, and if you're nearby it's worth checking out.  It's essentially a sports bar, so come watch a game and have some bar food.  I like the drive-through idea, though it seems like a good idea to call ahead and pick up, rather than order and wait.  \\n\\nShout-out to the Crosswoods parking lots, with horrible \\"back streets\\" that either need repaved or blocked off.

I ordered the sampler. \\n\\nPros: Big portions for reasonable prices. \\nCons: All I could taste in the chicken and dumplings was pepper. The sweet potato souffle was more like whipped sweet potatoes with a lot of cinnamon. \\n\\nThey started me out with a basket of breads: yeast rolls (which smelled a little over-fermented), cinnamon rolls, and cornbread. The cornbread was not only savory, but pretty salty. Saltier than I was expecting in a savory cornbread. Nice and crumbly.\\n\\nLater they also brought me some pot likker (delicious) and another piece of cornbread.\\n\\nI got the appetizer of fried chicken livers, which was a huge basket. It would have been entree-sized anywhere else. Tasty and well-fried, though it had about a quarter of fried bits that didn't have any liver in them. Considering how much else I ordered, there's no way I'd have eaten all of it anyway, so that's not a bad thing. I'd say it's a good size to split with 2-3 people.\\n\\nEntree: I got roast pork, chicken and dumplings, and fried chicken. The fried chicken was pretty unremarkable, the roast pork and stuffing was pretty good and coated in okay gravy, the chicken and dumplings as mentioned above was seasoned primarily with pepper. It was a little gluey and the white chicken was kind of stringy. I realized I like the kind that's more like matzo ball soup, compared to this, but that's not Mary Mac's fault. The sampler comes with 3 pieces of fried chicken- breast, wing, and drum; everything else came in a sampler size. You probably get more food if you order a sampler for more people.\\n\\nVeggie sides: I got the fried green tomatoes (delicious), turnip greens (pretty good), sweet potato souffle (more like whipped sweet potatoes with cinnamon and marshmallows), and the fried okra (AMAZING). I'm pretty sure I could hear angels singing while I enjoyed that okra.\\n\\nDessert: I had the Georgia Peach cobbler. It was okay. Definitely tasted like cinnamon. I also ate the cinnamon rolls at this point- but they were kind of cold by then, since I had to plow through all that other food first. \\n\\nMy only complaint is that their service is too efficient. I went as a single person and ran to the restroom right after I put in my order, leaving my stuff on the table. I came back after a couple moments and my utensils were gone! Then the busboy said \\"oh, I was wondering whose stuff that was.\\" The server came by and said \\"wait, you cleared her food?\\" Yup, he'd cleared my food. So, points for getting my stuff out in a timely manner, but... \\n\\nI did wait about an hour (as they'd warned me when I walked in) and they were kind enough to refire my order when it got cleared away, and furthermore let me sit there for another half hour after they're supposed to be closed so I could eat the fried food I'd ordered, since it wouldn't survive traveling well."},{"name":"Buffalo Wings & Rings","address":"6325 E Broad St","city":"Columbus","stars":"3","text":"So, we brought 7 people here.

Full Moon is one of the few places I know of that has a play area and is advertised as kid-friendly. I talked this place up, stating how much fun my friends' kids had they last time we were there (which was true), and we were all looking forward to a judgment-free dinner where my nephew could play and we wouldn't have to chase him around as much.\\n\\nI was wrong about ALL of that.\\n\\nLet's talk about the ambiance first. It's fine... sort of like a cafe atmosphere with a little bit of kid-friendly stuff around. A giant wall chalkboard behind some of the tables (but not convenient for kids who may want to do artwork on the walls behind people sitting in front of it), paper covering all the tables with a cup of crayons on each table, and a small play area near the back that has a somewhat wobbly baby gate, and otherwise no fencing/blocking around the area to keep kids a little bit more contained. For some, that's not a huge deal, because they don't mind if their kid runs around a little bit... and I thought if ANY place would be OK with that, this would be the place. My nephew is only 18 months old, and is non-stop. So he ran around, and had some sort of toy with wheels in his hand, and ran through the restaurant. He was almost able to make it into the kitchen/staff area before my SIL caught him. She was scolded by a waitress, and the waitress said \\"We should try to keep the toys with wheels in the play area.\\" My SIL apologized, but it felt unwelcoming. It was fairly obvious that my SIL didn't give her son a toy and tell him to run around with it and take it anywhere he wanted, and it's not like we were going to let him set it up over near the waitstaff and scoot around on it. \\n\\nNext, the food. BAD. So bad. We ordered a tapas plate, egg rolls, pulled pork sandwich, fish tacos, and a pizza. The egg rolls and pizza were clearly cheap frozen items. (We know kids don't care about the taste, but if I pay $19 for a tapas plate, I fully expect it to taste great and be fresh. It was basically a small dish of canned chickpeas with some weird tomato sauce on them, a few pieces of toasted cauliflower, a few fingerling potatoes cut in half with mayonnaise squirted on top out of a bottle, and greens with two long chunks of old dry cheese thrown on top). \\n\\nThe fish tacos were full of something that looked like canned tuna, and my brother in law didn't eat more than one bite. \\n\\nI am not going to go into detail on every single dish, but the food was the worst I've had in a long time.

Valet line was long-that was probably a good thing! Even the valet told us we were going to be in for quite a treat. We started with a Rose Pino Noir that was fantastic (2 glasses later...). The rolls. The rolls. The rolls. Those rolls are the greatest things EVER. We joked they were butter with a side of bread-they are addictive and go down way too easily! \\nWe had the barrata toast which was delectable. The two fish dishes we selected were the Grouper and the Swordfish (without horseradish). WOW-the flavors; unbelievable! We order hush-puppies and cauliflower as sides. Best decisions we ever made! I know we ordered too much food, but we just couldn't stop ourselves! We brought a lot home; not because the portions were outrageous, but because we ordered too much and ate too many rolls!

I found myself gulping down water the entire meal, as the saltiness overwhelmed my palate dish after dish. \\n\\nI had the Chinese Sausage sub, while my husband ordered the burger. My sub was, again, too salty (I ate less than half of it), though I enjoyed the fried scallions for an extra kick. Even the side salad (sesame oil-flavored coleslaw) had too much flavor, as the sesame oil overpowered the dish. The burger was definitely the best food item we ordered. Unlike other reviewers, our burger was still juicy, not overcooked. The flavors were also more balanced, so you could actually taste several individual ingredients. \\n\\nMy cocktail (Marceline the Vampire Queen: bourbon, cherry, amaretto, sherry, lemon, egg white) tasted strangely like cold medicine, but I expect that was my fault for ordering it - this must be why I don't see many cherry-flavored cocktails offered.\\n\\nWhile the food was disappointing, I expect I will go back.

I came in on a Wednesday evening around 1845, and even as a single was very politely told that it would likely be a one hour wait for a seat at the bar and an hour and a half for a table. I of course opted to wait, and was blown away at how great the staff were. Everyone said hi as I waited behind the bar, the bartenders engaged those of us waiting in conversation, and by the time I was seated about 40 minutes later it felt as though I was sitting down at a dinner party that I'd been at for a time already. From there everything was great, and those of us at the bar had a lively discussion while the fantastic dishes kept coming. This is Southern Hospitality at it's finest. Star. \\n\\nStar 2: How were the portions relative to the cost?\\n\\nYes, I paid $34.00 for Lobster Fried Rice, and you know what? I'd do it again. My portion of rice included a full lobster tail that was breaded and deep fried, and apart from that the portion of rice could have served three people. Money well spent. Star. \\n\\nStars 3 and 4: How was the food?\\n\\nNot only was this dish a phenomenal blend of unique flavors and textures that came together in a way that was completely foreign even to a fried rice enthusiast like myself, but every single dish that came out looked incredible.

It was cold and chunky; not what I expected, but so incredibly flavorful (with a little bit of heat) that I could have eaten a bowl of just that and been happy. We also got the blue plate special and the grit bowl. The grit bowl was flavorful but I would say it was a tad too much on the bbq sauce, which overpowered the flavor of the grits. The blue plate special was perfection though. The meatloaf was a dense, thick slice of meaty heaven without a bread/filler feel. It came with side of mashed potatoes, which were good, but good lord, that choux-fly corn was the most impressive thing I've eaten in a while. We must have made a lot of comments about how good our food was as the couple sitting next to us got food envy and decided to place an order for the chunky dunk after they had already placed their order. They both ordered a burger, which they said was so good that they had gotten it the last 3 times they came, but they eyeing our meal like it was food porn.

I had the croque monsieur, a creamy savory blend of ham, gruyere, b√©chamel, and Dijon on a croissant.  It did tantalize the taste buds, but I found the application of Dijon on varying layers to be heavy-handed and distracting.  I also had a last minute replacement for my side of seasonal beans, which was the butternut squash soup.  It is a flavorful offering, a bit heavy on the pepper.\\n\\nMy hubby (aka Condiment Man) had the chicken salad croissant, which was the definite winner.  He didn't ask for extra mayo or any other condiment, which is as rare as a polar bear in Georgia!  It was a perfect level of moist and flavorful.  The croissant was a superb example.  This would be in my top 5 chicken salad sandwiches.\\n\\nFor desert, which we enjoyed first, we had a chocolate macron cake and the petit cake.  The macron cake was forgettable.  The petit cake, perhaps a French take on a strawberry shortcake, came close to pleasing.  However, it was a bit too chilled, preventing the texture from softening and being creamier, and the use of strawberry was anemic.  A room temperature serving with extra strawberry slices would make this a winner.\\n\\nI would visit again for the chicken salad croissant and perhaps to try one of their coffee blends with a new pastry choice."},{"name":"Arnette's Chop Shop","address":"2700 Apple Valley Rd NE","city":"Brookhaven","stars":"4","text":"Came across this place hidden in Brookhaven and I was very surprised.

I am not exaggerating when I say this is the best duck entree I've had to date. The smoked duck breast was tender and flavorful. The broccolini was a little too salty for my taste but had a nice buttery flavor. There was also a side of grilled lobster tail, which realistically did not provide as much meat as I expected. However, it was beautifully complemented by a sweet potato and beets mash which proved to be an unsung hero for the dish. All of it sat on top of a rich sauce which might have been the reason for the extra salty broccolini, but went well with everything else nonetheless. I would definitely recommend this dish. \\n\\nThe ambience seemed not to match the finely crafted food.

Very delicious! (a smidge on the salty side though)\\n- Banana pudding (dessert): because they make all their desserts in house and I'm a huge fan of banana cream pie back home, I had to try this and it did not let down. The custard is rich and thick and there's just enough bananas to go with each bite (not to mention the nilla wafers stacked in between each layer!).\\n\\nAll in all, I fell in love with the food, service, and overall vibe of Mary Mac's.

They have been able to sub out things for me and it's all still delicious and now, healthier! \\n\\nBut let's review some of my favorite non-gluten free stuff that's on the menu that I've had because that's what you're most likely to order: \\n\\nLove the french fries. Just the right crisp and texture. The ricotta meatballs were also delicious. I shared with a friend. I think we had the Burrata too but it wasn't as memorable. \\n\\nThe golden raisin, cashew and black pepper feta salad is delicious! One of my favorite salads in town. There just aren't enough places to get a good salad though and I wish there were more but this is pretty good for something I didn't have to make at home. \\n\\nFrom the brasserie, the grilled salmon sandwich is off the hook. Loved it. Huge.  Enough for two ladies to split and get a large salad and an app. I so miss it now that I can't eat bread.

They always serve my favorite, salmon, perfectly medium-rare when I order it. \\n\\nPizza? Well, I lived in NYC for 12 years and this is NOT New York style pizza. I'm not sure why C-bus spots feel the need to always say it's NY style when in fact, a NY slice requires it to be thin--no puff, okay?--foldable, and large. If it's good on its own merits, then great--but don't call it NY when it's obviously not. That being said, I haven't tried the pizza here yet because I've seen the pics and friends have told me if I'm expecting a NY slice, fuggedabouit!

I'm not a fan of thick, high in sodium broth like the ones at Sapporo Ramen. Their Tonkotsu Shio Ramen is their signature ramen, which consists of silky tonkotsu broth enhanced with simple salt flavor. The broth is made from cooking the pork bone marrow for almost a day.

The guy at the front told me they JUST changed the recipe and haven't updated the menus, but the new nachos doesn't have chicken in it.

Not to worry, but then the shell of the tortilla was quite hard and awkward-I don't recall taquitos being a harder shell.  Once you got through that it was fine.  Just not something I'd re-order.

There was an immediate whiff of rancid cheese, like a taleggio gone awry. My wife refused to eat it. She is a picky eater, so I assumed her claims were not valid and proceeded to eat 1/4-1/3 of the dish. Within several minutes I began to feel nauseas and agreed that something was wrong with the dish. Was it the chicken feet? We had never had them before and assumed they could potentially cause such an odor. The waiter stated this should not be the case. Was there actually taleggio cheese in the dish? The answer was no. We asked to order a fried egg with grits instead.  I asked that the hen, minus the half with the chicken feet, be bagged.\\n\\nSeveral minutes later the manager, Kaitlyn, came over. She stated she had talked to the chef and apparently there was something wrong with the dish. They had used a milk powder to help keep the skin on the hen crispy. Unfortunately, the milk powder had congealed into one strip on the hen and had curdled, thus causing the unfortunate taste and odor. \\n\\nWe thought she had stated that the entree would be comped, but when the bill came the replacement fried egg and grits, at roughly $15, had been comped instead. She stated she would not comp the ruined entree as some of it had been eaten and bagged., \\n\\nThe entire meal with drinks ran roughly $200, and we tipped the waiter 20% for a total of $240 as he had done an excellent job.\\n\\nUnfortunately I will not be returning here and will not be recommending this restaurant to friends  or family. For the chef and manager to admit the $85 entree had been ruined and not to comp it seemed inappropriate and a very poor customer service move.

It is a fun dining experience with a great story but the food is not all that. The best things include the fried green tomatoes, bread basket and sweet potato souffl√©. The mac and cheese was too clumpy and greasy. The grits were unacceptable; I took one taste and never looked at it again. The main attraction, the fried chicken, was dry, not flavorful, and not crispy whatsoever. All of which were recommended to me by the nice waitress after I told her I don't eat pork/shellfish.

I grew up in Vietnam and during my time of living there, Bun Bo Hue is my number one favorite Vietnamese dish and I have had so many bowls of it. My family is also originally from the city of Hue, where this dish originated. In Orlando, there is no other place that makes Bun Bo Hue taste as close to home as this place (aside from my mom's). It has the most flavorful broth and the different kinds of meat they put in there is what you would find if you ordered this dish in Vietnam. The chilli oil they have is perfect, spicy and flavorful. In a lot of Vietnamese dishes, what makes or breaks the dish is the vegetable. This place gives you plenty of fresh vegetables and I love that they give you shaved banana leafs, which is an essential veggie for Bun Bo Hue. \\n\\nI also tried out their Cha Ca Thang Long and it was also delicious. It has a very strong fishy taste, which I love but it may not be for everyone. \\n\\nThis place also has fresh coconut juice, literally you are drinking out of a coconut.

An extra star for the service.\\n\\nI've been to Union Oyster House once before for a work dinner and I remember liking the food. Maybe it's because I got lobster or because I wasn't paying or because the food was actually better then. It was no bueno today.\\n\\nI made a reservation for myself for lunch since Dine Out Boston week is ending. I wanted to have one last hurrah after dining at Del Frisco's and Capital Grille last week. This was my first lunch as I rarely go out for food during the week and prefer to bring lunch from home or grab something quick. In other words, I made this a special occasion for myself and it ended up being a sad, sad lunch.\\n\\nI walked in and was asked by the man behind the seafood bar if I wanted to sit there. There were some noisy ladies that I wanted to avoid, so I said no thanks and stuck with a booth table. I told the hostess that I had a reservation, but she didn't check because the restaurant was hella empty at 11:30 on a Thursday (RIP Open Table points). \\n\\nThe waiter stopped by pretty quickly with water and complimentary cornbread with butter. I had to flag him down for the Dine Out Boston menu and he didn't know what it was. A few minutes later, he had asked the right people and returned with the Dine Out menu. I had done my research online and knew what I wanted, but just wanted to double check that the menu was the same as it was online. It was! So, I was ready to order after 5 seconds, but the waiter didn't come back for several minutes.\\n\\nOnce he did come back, I was able to put in my order of clam chowder, fried oysters w/ french fries and coleslaw, apple cobbler and tea. The cornbread was meh. I'm glad it was free bread, but it didn't taste great. The clam chowder was fantastic (and I'm picky with chowder). It was rich and delicious. I would get it again. The fried clams, fries, coleslaw and even the apple cobbler were all practically tasteless! I was so disappointed. I love oysters so much and these were just fried pieces of air. The fries were ok, but nothing grand. The small cobbler (which is a fine size for lunch), came with whipped cream and was warm, but wasn't at all sweet. Even if it was mild in sweetness, but had a good granola crunch topping or SOMETHING... But it was flavorless and I pushed it aside.\\n\\nAs for the entree, I had a bit and asked for a box to wrap it up. I don't know why. I don't want to eat it again and my boyfriend doesn't do seafood, so... it'll probably just end up in the trash (where most of my cornbread, coleslaw and cobbler ended up). So sad. With tax and tip I spent $32 on a crappy lunch and wasted my \\"lunchtime treat\\" to myself. I would come back to maybe have more chowder or some raw oysters if I'm playing tour guide in Faneuil someday, but otherwise - I'll pass.\\n\\nI will say that the waiter was very friendly and mostly attentive. Even though some parts of the meal took a while, he kept checking to make sure I had everything I needed and was a smiling face. I appreciated it."},{"name":"Folk Art Restaurant","address":"465 N Highland Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"I tried this place for the first time today and was overly impressed. Went shortly after the lunch rush, so was immediately seated. Within a minute of being seated, Brittany took my drink order. The person who recommended FA to me told me that their cocktails are great, but it was a bit early for me. Chose a Fentiman's Rose Lemonade, which was just one of several interesting non-alcoholic drink choices. \\n\\nAfter bringing my drink, Brittany appeared again just as I had decided on my lunch selection. I ordered the Reuben which had kim chi in place of the usual sauerkraut and what I would guess to be a homemade thousand island dressing. I often choose a Reuben as a gauge of a restaurant's sandwich capabilities. In this case, I was not only not disappointed, I was amazed.
