The reviews were pretty good all in all. Unfortunately, the food just didn't warrant any stars at all. The customer service was okay but the food.....oh God no. The taste is bland at best. I had a Gordita with rice and beans, my husband had the enchilada and relleno. We ordered chips and salsa, too. The rice and beans were lukewarm on both plates (obvs had been dished up substantially before our orders were ready). The gordita was.......gross. It was made with carnitas, sandwiched between a mongo flour tortilla and liberally filled with cheese (I love cheese) but that was it. There was an odd flavor that i can't quite describe - like cream with a hint of tomato-but the flavorless kind. The whole thing was cut into pizza slices and garnished with sour cream from a bottle. My husband liked his relleno alright but ate one bite of his enchilada and spit it into his napkin. The refried beans were okay - you can't screw up refried beans from a can. Even the rice had no flavor. \\n\\nTo be fair, we are originally from Colorado, where Tex-Mex is king. But a little spice, maybe a sprig of cilantro, even cumin or chili powder - SOMETHING - would have made this dining experience closer to worth the $29 ticket (for just the food). \\n\\nThis is Mexican food folks. Even in Oregon, people expect a little warmth in the Mexican food - AND a little flavor. This food had neither. On the other hand, it's clean and cute, in a kitschy sort of way. \\n\\nIf the owner is reading this: PLEASE...own the fact that you're a Mexican restaurant-you can and should serve food with bold, rich flavor. Catering to a perception that Oregonians prefer mild is a big mistake. What you're doing is not pleasing all the people all the time - you're kind of grossing all the people out by selling your food short.

We had reservations for Saturday night - but when we got there the place was packed (with a mostly older crowd, but that's ok).   Even the bar was 1 deep at most parts.  We were content to wait, as not being in a hurry.   We eventually bellied up to the bar and enjoyed a nice strong drink.  We inquired only once after a time about our table (we were nearing 20 minutes after our reservation time) and were informed we just had to wait for some people to pay out.  No big deal, as I said.  \\n\\nHowever, the bartender informed us that the next round was on the house for our wait.  I mean, we weren't even the slightest bit out of sorts about the wait and here are free drinks!  I already love this place. \\n\\nWe finally get seated (and, I understand the place was slammed and being seated late was of no fault of C&S - it just happens).  Once we tucked into the plushy booth (which was part of the reason it took so long to seat us, I had reserved a booth, so I guess it's partly my bad) the hostess dropped by with a big plate of calamari and truffle laced potato crisp things, on the house, for our inconvenience.  We have NEVER seen customer service like that and we duly impressed with the effort to make sure our dinner was a pleasant one.  So, in addition to leaving a nice tip, I vowed to write a review praising their customer service.  I'm not going to review the place itself, being as the ethics of reviewing suggest getting comped goodies leads to a lack of impartiality (you know, cause I'm a professional and all :-p) but I will say they treat their customers well.

I have eaten at Kevin's other restaurant, Rathbun's and had a completely different experience.  Our waiter was fantastic, but the hostess sat a large table towards the end of our meal and his attention was elsewhere.  I was suprised at how eclectic the wine list was.  I usually expect to find the California heavy hitters on a steakhouse wine list, this was not the case.  This list was heavy with Spanish, Agrentina and even Italian wines.  I found my 6 ounce filet overly seasoned, but the sides were amazing.  My salad was swimming in salad dressing.  \\n\\nThe restaurant was completely full.   There was only one table in the restaurant open and the bar was hopping.  Not once did the owner/chef come to the table or walk throught the dining room.  As we were leaving I saw him sitting at the bar having a glass of wine.  That is fine, I am sure it was a long day.

Very tender and flavorful and no issue with the spice even for our most sensitive pallet. \\nMuu Sateh how can you have Thai without having pork skewers and peanut sauce. The teen agers liked this one the best I think it was because it was the least spicy if you didn't have the cucumber relish which was tasty if you can handle the heat.\\n\\nWe also had the special of the day which I can't remember the name or what the fish was but it was served with noodles and a mango salsa that was delicious but VERY spicy even for me and I grew up drinking Tabasco and eating the hottest dish's on the menu. \\nThe corn on the cob special of the day served with lime wedges was enjoyed by all present. \\n\\nThis location just happened to be on the route for the annual Worlds Naked Bike Ride which I must say was an added bonus, we couldn't leave because our car was parked on the route but to be honest I don't think we would have left anyway it was an experience and a sight to behold."},{"name":"Shigezo Izakaya","address":"910 SW Salmon St","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"Great happy hour specials and some pretty good ramen.

The bartender/server asked if we'd ever been to their Malden location and we responded that we had not. She was attentive and responsive. We ordered fried calamari as an appetizer. It tasted fine but a bit greasy. However my impression was that the cook didn't pay much attention to detail as all of the tentacle portions were cooked into one big ball that had to be cut apart. My husband ordered linguine with clam sauce and before ordering asked the server to confirm that there would be plenty of clams, which they did.  I ordered chicken marsala. The linguine w/clam sauce turned out to be spaghetti (not linguini)with very sparse clams. He asked for and received additional clams. My marsala consisted of a heaping plate of spaghetti with a couple of pasty chicken fingers and strips of ham buried inside and barely any mushrooms and no hint of marsala flavor.  It seems to me that if the cook had ever eaten either of these dishes in a restaurant themselves, they would know how awful the dishes they sent out looked and in my case, tasted. Long and short, I sent back the marsala and was mulling over getting anything different at the point. That's when the server told us that Pearl Street Caf√© is known for BBQ-hello, there is nothing to indicate barbecue focus from the name nor did the server mention this when she asked if we'd been to the Malden location. In the end, I ordered a pulled pork sandwich which was ok however the broccoli that came with it was soaked in garlic oil-not good. As we were getting ready to leave, a dj/singer arrived and played mostly obscure, boring (at least to me) 50's music interspersed w/a bit of Buffet and Rhianna.

It had started late the night before, and, like a dirty old man who just discovered Viagra, hadn't let up since. Tom looked about, the gray morning just coming alive with the bustle of suits, scenester tweens and hipsters that stumbled into and out of coffee shops with clockwork predictability. No sign of the target, but he wouldn't be hard to spot among this crowd, even if he was a Face; he had picked the wrong city to deploy his infamous \\"everyman\\" disguise. \\n\\nNo, Portlanders didn't know everyman. They never signed up for the everyman newsletter, nor gave much thought to listening to everyman music. Everyman didn't live there. PDX was the capital of the esoteric, a living monument to the human desire for non-conformity. In that, perhaps, there was a degree of assimilation, but that was a sociological experiment for another time...and another man. All Tom cared about was that the Face would finally be exposed, a plain sore thumb beating a painful red against this backdrop of amiable excess and stylistic abortions. \\n\\nHe thought back to that first encounter in New York. There was a city of convention, the kind of place that the Face moved about with impunity. Tom's investigation, a carefully cultivated labyrinth of contacts both willing and not, had nearly given him the keys to the Face's cell. He had not counted on the banality of the town, its willingness to promote the anonymous and hide the sinister behind curtains of uniform desperation - the Face had eluded him again. \\n\\n\\"Not this time,\\" Tom whispered to himself, his eyes scanning the busy intersection at Burnside and 10th. This time would be different; four different contacts all pointed to the same place, the same time. The Face would be here waiting for his buyer, and the MacGuffin would be with him. \\n\\nIt only took a moment more of scanning the milling throngs before his gaze settled on one. Perhaps it was the way that his steps were too careful, too precise and even in gait. Or perhaps it was the pains he took to keep his own gaze wandering in a conspicuously \\"normal\\" manner. Whatever it was, Tom focused on this one man. \\n\\nHis target. \\n\\nHe moved towards him, careful not to draw the Face's attention. He had come too far, taken too many wrong turns and encountered too many dead ends to let him get away again. This time would be different, this time... \\n\\n...but no, the Face looked up, startled from his careful act of normalcy. With a start, he raced across the intersection. How had he known? How did he... \\n\\n\\"You've been speaking your monologue out loud this whole time,\\" offered a disheveled man who had until then been handing out socialist newsletters. \\"I don't think anyone here DOESN'T know who you are now.\\" \\n\\nCrap. \\n\\nTom raced across the street, splashing through puddles, his exposition coming in short gasps as he fought to maintain his monologue and catch up with the Face. He watched as the criminal mastermind slipped into a nearby building. \\n\\nPowell's City of Books. I've got you now! \\n\\nOr at least Tom thought he had him; as soon as he entered, vertigo smashed him upside the head like a bug painting a windshield with its own special body paint. A wall of books and a mob of people greeted him, no more than fifty, perhaps, but it might as well have been a million - the Face had moved within them quickly, and the trail had gone cold. \\n\\nDesperate, Tom ignored the gawking stares of those who were within earshot of his exposition and raced as quickly as he could through the literary gullet of this colossal beast, looking this way and that, the faces of those he encountered blurring with the mental image he had held of his quarry. He ran through the halls, up the stairs, up, up, down, down, left, right, left, right...through the A section, the B section...he had lost him. \\n\\nRaising a fist towards the ceiling, Tom paused his diatribe long enough to let out a fierce cry of impotent rage. \\n\\n*pause* \\n\\n...and realized that this had been the Face's plan all along. Here, in this Kingdom of Literacy, amid the swarms of diverse people, the hundreds of thousands of tomes ranging from all possible subjects, a grand temple to humanity's highest form of expression, the Face had adorned his greatest disguise...for Powell's City of Books truly WAS Portland - all of its quirky grandeur, its accepting, intellectual heart, and it beat to the pulse of the learned collective that dwelled within. \\n\\nIndeed, he wore his glamour with the very ease that had granted him the moniker \\"the Fashionista of Disguise.\\" \\n\\nDefeated, Tom lifted his ego back onto its feet and sighed. \\n\\n\\"Oh well,\\" he huffed, \\"I wonder if Laura Joh Rowland has a new book out...\\""},{"name":"La Cantina de San Angel","address":"Walt Disney World, 1510 North Avenue of the Stars","city":"Orlando","stars":"3","text":"I love Mexican food.

Now I live far away enough from any location to only go there once a year, if that. Last night was such a night.\\n\\nTwo friends of mine and I, fresh from a trip to the nearby Aeronaut Brewery decided to walk over to this location to get us some wings to go. I ordered a DC-10, which is about a pound of chicken. This option is great because you can get two sauces instead of one. Fast forward a couple of minutes and we all placed our orders and waited... and waited... and wait. Then my friend's order finally came even though he ordered after me. Eventually mine came about fifteen minutes after that. No apologies or nothing from the staff.

I was super excited to get my two favorite flavors: Mustang Ranch and West Texas Mesquite, which are both dry rubs. I also paid extra for the celery and extra blue cheese which they were more than happy to nickel and dime me for. I knew that coming in though so I can't argue that. Excited, I got home, kicked my shoes off, turned on the TV and opened the styrofoam container. It smelled great but then I took a bite. And another. And then realized that this was so incredibly salty that it was basically inedible. \\n\\nIt tasted like salt. Salt and a bit of the dry rubs. It was so salty that it was almost as if I was chewing on ramen seasoning packets.

They've become complacent and frankly, even though their chicken is top notch, the sauces and dry rubs have become garbage. I'd be hard pressed to return again. It's a shame really as their various offerings are enticing and their sauces are varied and unique enough that it could keep people coming back for more. But not me, I've learned my lesson now.

As a fan of Nancy Drew, I really love collecting the older paperbacks that are no longer in circulation. So when I saw those 1930 vintage hardbacks sitting on the shelves, in great quantities? I literally went crazy. During my trip to Portland last summer, I probably spent half my time sitting on the floor on that one aisle sifting through all the books. The staff there had definitely begun to notice me after awhile! I even went up to the other levels (it is a HUGE store - a true \\"city\\" of books) and discovered a heckuva selection! The great thing about this place is that it's like a vintage book store. You can buy and sell! I had no interest in selling, but the fact that any person can walk in and sell their used stuff just makes it a haven for rare and out-of-print books! Prices varied. It depends on how hard to find the book is, but if it's a regular used book in good condition, you can get it for a superb price! The only thing that turned me off was that some things were hard to find and a bit disorganized. If you are a bookworm...this should be on your list of places to go in life!\\n\\nP.S.

When we got over to Pok Pok we were seated and waited for a while and worried maybe it would be the same service as we had earlier and we would be forgotten too but we soon figured that everyone ordering would have tons of questions of the very unique and varied menu. Our server was very helpful and gave great recommendations, my biggest disappointment was that the Cha Ca \\"La Vong\\" was sold out. I was really looking forward to trying it. So instead we went with the catfish salad which was incredible, along with the papaya salad,and the Hoi Thawt which was a broken crispy crepe with mussels and bean sprouts. My other half also loved the Vietnamese chicken wings. They looked so amazing I was so tempted to throw away my vegetarian (pescatarian) card for one of those wings. Our most pleasant surprise was that the GM came over and introduced himself and said he heard we had a bit of a bummer at the Whiskey Soda because of the oysters. We hadn't thought much of it because we enjoyed ourselves anyhow, but they gave us the papaya salad as an apology. We really appreciated the gesture and it made our experience even better.

Does it have the best food in Columbus? No. Is it authentic Mexican? Not really at all. The food here, however, is very solid, and it always has a great selection of draft beers. My friends are pretty big fans of the margaritas as well. They almost always have 7-8 of the Great Lakes beers on tap and then a bunch of other rotating taps in addition to those.\\n\\nThis place is definitely Tex-Mex, but some of the dishes are even pushing the line on that distinction, like the Wing-O-Rito. Take your favorite wing sauce that they have, and they grill up some chicken toss it in that and roll it up in a burrito. Sound awful? It's really not, and I had my buddy try it the other day for the first time, and he really loved it. It also helps when you've had some drinks in you. They also have Wing-O tacos, which is essentially the same idea, but  they throw in a large boneless wing in your tortilla. I'm a huge fan of the San Francisco sauce. The Southwestern sauce is good too. \\n\\nDon't get me wrong, you can get plenty of real Tex-Mex here if that's what you're looking for. I tend to get a little bit of everything. The Pick-a-Dippa is a nice little sampler for chips and salsa/cheese dip/guacamole. Pick 3, and I'm not sure if it's unlimited or not, but I really like the salsas.\\n\\nMad Mex is usually my little secret for watching noon or 3:30 OSU games, since they have really big TVs, and I can almost always get a bar spot, and it's never crazy crowded. It seems like an odd place to watch a game, but if you bring a bunch of people, you can almost have a private party to yourself. I probably shouldn't be giving that away. All-in-all, Mad Mex will always be a prime spot for me no matter how old I get, and I hope it continues to do well down in the ever-rotating restaurants at the South Campus Gateway."},{"name":"The Daily Catch","address":"323 Hanover St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"I live in the North End, and decided to finally give the Daily Catch a try.

My friends ordered regular, small Bloodies and the mix tasted much better in theirs. The Best - lets just call it The Beast - was insanely decorated, but (IMHO) needed way more spice. We added hot sauce. Between the toppings (which includes steak and a full boiled egg), the chili, and a few bites of my friend's Totchos (yum!!), I was full. \\n\\nA few other food notes about the other dishes that graced our table...the Midtown Medley was average.

I was really excited about this hotel because (1) it's a JW Marriott so I figured the service and amenities would be amazing, (2) the pool area is gorgeous, and (3) I was just happy to be going on vacation.  \\n\\nUnfortunately my first impression of this hotel was less than amazing.  Here's why:\\n\\nROOMS:  I reserved the room in April and requested a room with double beds.  I called about 2 weeks before the trip to make sure that our reservation was on file and that my double-beds request would be honored.  They promised it would.  I called one hour before I checked in and let the front desk know that we were running late for check-in and reminded them that I wanted a room with double beds...the girl at the front desk said that it wouldn't be a problem.  I checked in at 10:00 pm Thursday night and guess what?  NO DOUBLE BEDS!  How is that possible? The lady at the front desk suggested that I check with them in the morning and maybe they would have a room available.  So in the meantime they put us in Room 4009 with a king bed and a sofa bed.  There is no doubt that the room was beautiful, but a King bed is NOT what I requested.  We are two adults and one child and I wanted my daughter to have her own bed (not a roll-away bed or sofa bed as the front desk kindly suggested).  The following day I called the front desk and they said they could transfer us to another room with double-beds.  Perfect!  So we went to room 5009.  The room was gorgeous.  The bathroom was spacious and had a large tub and everything was clean.  However, there are 3 things they need to fix in the rooms (I noticed this in both rooms):  (1) there must be something wrong with the AC in the rooms because the neither room would get cold.  I had the AC at 65 the entire time and was sweating the whole night! (2) the shower doors need a better seal because the water gets out from the bottom and makes a huge puddle.  The bathroom rug was soaked the entire weekend so we wasted towels on soaking up the floor, and (3) the beds are EXTREMELY uncomfortable.  I have a bad back as it is and I woke up with a sore back every day.  Even my 8 year-old daughter was complaining about the bed being too hard.   \\n\\nSELF-PARKING/VALET:  We decided we would self-park as it's cheaper ($19) than the valet ($27).  My BF went out and when he came back the room card didn't work to get into the lot.  In fact, the card NEVER worked.  So the hotel was very accommodating and let us valet for the price of the self-parking.  Thank you!  (please read my update regarding the Valet services)\\n\\nPOOL AREA:  The pool is beautiful.  I have zero complaints about this because it's exceptional.  Extremely child-friendly and completely clean.  The service at the pool was great too.\\n\\nSTARBUCKS:  A Starbucks on site?  AWESOME!  The price?  Terrible.  This Starbucks bumps up the price because it's attached to the hotel.  A coffee and an apple juice should not cost $9.  But I'm a sucker for my coffee and I paid it anyway (shame on me.)     \\n\\nWI-FI:  No free wi-fi?  Anywhere in the hotel?  No?  That's crazy.  For the amount of money guests pay there the least they could do is provide free wi-fi.  C'mon now!\\n\\nCHECK OUT:  Check out was a breeze and the gentleman that helped me was wonderful.  \\n\\nWith the exception of the hotel room, self-parking hiccup, and the wi-fi and Starbucks rip-off, the hotel is great.  However, a hotel of this caliber should work with their customers requests a little better.\\n\\nUPDATE:  This update is related to the Hertz Car Rental onsite AND the hotel valet.  I received an email from Hertz today (7/1/14) with a copy of my invoice for car rental service.  The receipt was for DOUBLE what I was supposed to pay.  I rented a car for a day on Saturday, June 28 and was told by Shawn from Hertz that I could return the car to the hotel valet because the Hertz offices would be closed after 6pm. I returned the car to valet the same day (6/28) at 7pm.  I explained to valet that I was returning a rental and the guy said it was not a problem.  So today (2 days later) I called Hertz to ask why I was being billed for 2 days instead of 1 and Nina said that the valet returned that car yesterday morning!!!  I was already home in Miami yesterday morning.  When I told Nina that she said \\"well I have to go by what the valet wrote on the receipt and they claim you returned the car yesterday morning\\" I said \\"that's impossible because I checked out of the hotel on Sunday (6/29)!\\"  She had the audacity to say \\"it's your word against his so please call the Hertz billing center.\\"  So where was the car this whole time?  Did the valet forget to log it in?  Did he take it for a day?  WHO KNOWS!  So as I type this I'm on hold with the Hotel billing department to get a copy of my invoice so that I can send this to Hertz and they can figure out what happened.  WOW.  What a TERRIBLE experience with this hotel."},{"name":"Life Alive","address":"765 Mass Ave","city":"Cambridge","stars":"4.5","text":"I cannot stop raving about this gem. It's all I could ask for.

Different take on what I'm used to but nonetheless it was delish. My husband had oysters. Yuck. Hahah. He loved everyone that Nate suggested. Next I ordered the salmon which was caught that very day. Sooooo good. Omg. My husband ordered the lobster roe noodles. He had that last time and loved it so much he got it again and it did not disappoint. We were stuffed. The food outstanding. Nate then turns around and gave us a cantaloupe sorbet.  Which he foot the bill for. It was so very nice of him to do that.  Service impeccable. Amazing food. Highly recommend!!!

I am also a huge spice wimp - you can see the conundrum. I have been to Pok Pok two times and the first time I couldn't eat anything because we ordered randomly off the menu and everything was too spicy for me to eat. The next time we went we actually talked to the waiter and asked about spice levels of the food, they suggested what we should order to balance one spicy, one medium spicy, and two mild. It was absolutely fantastic. The food is incredibly delicious, the ingredients are fresh and flavorful. The balance of the spicy (and rice!) I was able to try everything and enjoy the diverse meal. We ordered their special (wing beans? I had never heard of them before, but they were blanched and tossed in a sauce) and I sometimes dream about them they are so good. \\n\\nOutside of the food, the atmosphere is cramped and tight - sitting at your own table but very close to every other table in the place. Oh, and the line to get a table is usually really really long. There are two options for this, you can get a table and then head over to the sister resturant Whiskey Soda Lounge and eat appatizers and drink delicous cocktails and other drinks while you wait. This is my favorite method, the drinking vinegars are really interesting and fun to drink and the appetizers are close to what you get at pok pok anyways. Second method is to make a reservation ahead of time (I guess this is kind of obvious, but hey, its the other option.)\\n\\nOverall, I am a big fan of Pok Pok. I know there are mixed reviews of the place, but truthfully it is one of the best place to get thai food that is not mainstream (how very hipster of me) and delicious.

You can tell that the MF owners went to great lengths to create a genuinely elegant but fun/accessible environment for diners. The one thing I'll add is that I felt a bit claustrophobic in that much of the natural light is blocked out, and they don't have outdoor seating. Even the front door is covered in wood paneling, which seems like an odd design choice. Then again, if you're aiming to create an immersive experience that's the way to do it.\\n\\nThey have an extensive Saki menu, and our server was knowledgable about what to order. We asked for something that was dry but a little sweet, and his choice was spot-on the money. Nicely served in a self-cooling carafe. They treat the sake just like the wine, with extensive descriptions and lots of choices.\\n\\nWe had the spicy tuna tartar, which was very good. my pal who dined with me doesn't like onions--scratch that; he LOATHES onions--and I found that to be an odd choice for tuna tataki, giving it more of a slight salad-y texture. But he wasn't bothered by it and neither was I. The dish was very good.\\n\\nThe lobster tempura dish is a favorite from back in the restaurant's midtown days, and I ordered it again. The dish is, once again, a home run--almost too decadent for its own good. Our nigiri was wonderful, too: yellowtail and smoked salmon were buttery and fresh. We both got the Crunchy Roll, which was also great.\\n\\nCouple quibbles. There was an army of sushi makers behind the bar, and the restaurant wasn't that busy. Despite those factors, service to the table was slow and inconsistent. our appetizer came out at the same time as the lobster dish, for example. An eatery at this level should have snappy servers and responsive service.\\n\\nThe restaurant itself would've been better suited to a street-side location, right on N.

Not even close to being crispy. So, they took the squid away. In the meantime our vegetables and rice got cold.

Obviously that would not work because then our squid would be cold.\\n\\nThe second batch of squid came out. At least it was drained. It was cooked slightly better but does not compare to any of the typical Salt and Pepper squid that is now so popular. \\n\\nGood Taste's squid was just pieces of squid.

However, the squid was very tender.\\n\\nThe vegetable dish was good, and cooked well.\\n\\nI would highly suggest that the owners take a trip across the river to Thien Hong and find out why their S&P squid is so wildly popular and consider that cooking method in their restaurant.\\n\\nWe will never order this again.\\n\\nHowever, we will go back as the other food we have had here has been nothing short of excellent.\\n\\nService today was also extremely slow.

I assume they didn't saut√©e the garlic beforehand to let the flavors come out.

Dad's filet was charcoal on the outside and undercooked on the inside; Mom's scallops were undercooked, and hubby's twin lobster tails smelled fishy and tasted awful.

Gladly advising how best to cool the fire from the boars collar with the mustard green and sticky rice.  A must have by the way if you like your boar spicy!  \\n\\nThe Vietnamese fish sauce chicken wings that so much publicity has been based off of definitely did not disappoint.  They were so good in fact that a second order was placed to take home for a late night revival.\\nThey were caramelized and cooked to perfection while resonating an enjoyable  and moderate spice.\\n\\nThe charcoal rotisserie chicken is also a great way to go and complimented very well with two very tasty dipping sauces.\\n\\nUnfortunately in my 3 trips since I have yet to deviate from my original order of Boars Collar, Vietnamese Wings, and Rotisserie Chicken.  They were that good.  One day soon I will add the curry noodle soup to my list...a top recommendation from the staff."},{"name":"Moonshine Patio Bar & Grill","address":"303 Red River St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"My favorite lunch spot.

The waitress who I believe is also part owner was very sweet and attentive.  I felt like I was being served at someone's house.  Two of my friends felt like she hovered a little bit, but that didn't bother me.  We had the basic salad, avacado salad, pheonix maki, ocean maki, Ramen (can't remember which one), kimchi pancake (spicy), and some other misc rolls.  Everything was made to order so took a little time.  This was nice for us because we were able to talk and eat slower.  The basic salad came with a grapefruit based dressing.  I couldn't taste the grapefruit but enjoy the taste of the dressing.  The salad isn't your typical green salad but more of a cabbage salad. I found it really tasty.  Some in our group liked it, but were expecting a green salad as apposed to cabbage.  The pheonix maki is awesome, and was served with homemade soy sauce which was really good! The ocean maki wasn' bad at all but not quite as good as the pheonix.  The kimchi pancake (it wasn't too spicy) was also amazing.  The avacado salad is also very good.  The weak part of the meal was the ramen.  I love cooking and have been trying to replicate some awesome ramen.  This ramen didn't have much flavor to it.  I can't say it was bad, just very bland. Overall this place is worth checking out.  Most if not all the food is amazing as well as the people who work there.

The pasta was actually pretty solid and the sauce was flavorful but nothing special. \\nThe Shrimps, Scallops and Broccoli in a white wine sauce was really weak. The fact that they charge $25 for boxed pasta with a few shrimp and scallops tossed in weak wine sauce is a shame.\\nBottom line: skip the tourist trap and mediocre food.

I thought it would be a good idea to call and ask them about what the wait time looks like. The hostess told me that its their policy to not give out estimated wait time over the phone due to number of customers can fluctuate. So I told her I just want a rough estimate (because I just ask Neptune at the North End and their wait time is 3 hours, if their wait time is less, i'll probably just go to Island Creek). I understand that they don't want to be responsible for giving incorrect wait time estimates but which restaurants don't have fluctuations on the number of walk in customers. I can understand they don't do that if its their grand opening month or something but if they still can't give estimates after being around for a while then maybe something is wrong with management. \\n\\nP.S.

It has kind of a 1920's kind of vibe to its decor. If I lived here, I'd see myself coming here for Happy Hour pretty regularly. It seemed kind of classy, but there were a lot of people in there dressed casually.\\n\\nWe shared some caramelized onion dip, brussels and broccoli, mac & cheese, and a burger. Everything was delectable. The dip was the perfect amount of sweet and salty, with caramelized onions mixed in. The brussels and broccoli were roasted and had this heavenly aioli sauce drizzled over them. The burger was perfectly cooked. And let me tell you about this mac & cheese, guys. I've had a lot of mac & cheese. It's my favorite thing in the world and I order it pretty much everywhere. It's not great for my waistline, but whatever, imma live my life. This was the best mac & cheese I have ever had. Ever. My friend and I are still talking about it. It was creamy and delicious, with just the right amount of sage for flavor. It had a crunchy topping, and the pasta was the perfectly al dente. I still dream of that mac & cheese. If you are ever at Barlow, GET IT. You don't know what you're missing.\\n\\nOur first bartender was great. He was very attentive and was great at recommending cocktails based on what I and my friend described we usually go for. I first got the Penicillin--a scotch drink with lemon and honey. It was awesome. You could taste the scotch, but it wasn't overpowering. If you like scotch but don't want to fully commit to drinking it neat, this is a great drink for that. We both ordered Old Fashioneds afterward, and they were great! We both live in Louisville, Kentucky, so we're admittedly kind of snobs when it comes to bourbon--especially a good Old Fashioned. There are so many ways to do it wrong. Barlow got it right! They didn't overdo it with simple syrup, so the bourbon shined through. And the most important component of a good Old Fashioned is NOT using a lot of cubed or crushed ice. It melts too fast and dilutes the bourbon. Barlow uses one huge ice cube instead--the right way! And they had a B etched into the cube for Barlow. So cute! \\n\\nThe only annoying thing of the night was another bartender took over for the first guy and she was pretty inattentive. It was hard to get her to do anything.

The fried oyster brioche slider was yummy too.  \\n\\nThe meal: I had the lobster roe noodles pescatarian (sans the short rib or whatever piece of cow they recommend) and they were some of the best noodles I've ever had.  Most places woulda just slapped some tiny lobster zygotes in some noodles and thrown 2 tiny pieces of lobster on top and called it a day.  But no, everything about this dish was perfection. Firstly, to my relief, there were no tiny baby lobster eyeballs peeking out of the noodles, as I had feared.  There were bountiful pieces of succulent, sweet lobster in the noodles, and a light creamy/oily sauce that was just the right amount of sauciness.  My favorite part was that they didn't skimp on the vegetables - there were fancy little mushrooms, sweet potatos, peas, yum yum yum.  Seriously, it was phenomenal.  \\n\\nThe dessert:  Decent but not quite as amazing as the other domains, 4 stars maybe.\\n\\nThe service:  Our server was really friendly and nice and not at all judgy about our inane questions: \\"So how do oysters work?\\"  (She told us all about how oysters filter the water and taste different depending on the water flow and whatnot.

At first glance, the place looked closed because the lights are set so low and evoke the feeling of dusk. The restaurant appears to be family run, and my friend and I were served by a really nice guy who we thought was the son of the owner. We were starving and the service was perfectly timed so that new courses were always filling our tables and our water glasses were never empty. But now to the best part, the delicious food.\\n\\nWe started with a fried eggplant dish with some sort of creamy topping. Amazing. I had a dish consisting of three types of kabob (sausage made from beef and chicken, chicken and beef). The side was made of a mix of potatoes, red peppers and onions. The spices were \\"Bedouin\\" and I was pleasantly surprised that my taste buds had never tasted anything like it before. A mix between Nepali, Afghani and Mediterranean, it was simply scrumptious. We shared a carafe of the delicious rose water lemonade with a hint of mint which went perfectly with each delectable bite. Even though we were stuffed, we went for the seven spice chocolate torte with two scoops of handmade ice cream and pretty much were in food coma heaven.\\n\\nSo, I really recommend this place as a romantic date spot, a gathering of 4-6 friends over a different kind of meal, or when you're in the mood for a food adventure.

I didn't check out the wine list.  Both nights I went, it was closer toward the end of the night, and they were offering their happy hour snacks.  I had the cheddar/gouda dip with sea salt chips.  The dip was good, very cheesy, and you get a nice portion for the price (I think it was only $6).  \\n\\nParking isn't great, but it's downtown Portland, parking isn't great anywhere you go.  The drink prices were commiserate with what I paid at nearby joints, which is to say they are likely a little higher than you'd expect.

The dining room is really classy and the tables aren't forced too close together, which is really nice when it's just two of you wanting a romantic evening.  George was our waiter and he was extremely knowledgeable about the menu.  He was also friendly and funny without being overly familiar, which I appreciated.  (Note to wait staffs: Don't pretend we're going to be new BFF's.  We're here for dinner.  You are here to serve us.  I'm about to spend at least $200 plus pay you about $50/hour.  Let's each remember our place.)  My husband had the lamb, which he loved, and I had the big Filet Mignon and a side of the mushrooms.  My steak was prepared perfectly medium-rare and even though I'm a big eater, I couldn't finish it.  It was delicious and I could cut it with a fork.  Next time we're going to either have the steak for two (which is a big t-bone cut tableside, which a lot of other diners were having) or I'm going to have the rib-eye.  George recommended the wine and it was wonderful, although now we're having trouble remembering which one it was.  I'm glad we trusted him with that decision because we are from California and very few of the wines on their list were familiar to us.  All-in-all, I highly recommend Kevin Rathbun Steak.

If it had been me, I would have moved quickly to get a rag and wipe down the table for the guest-- that is just good service. I was simply handed a wet rag with no, \\"here you go\\".

I was sorely disappointed to receive such lackluster, borderline rude service.\\n\\nI wasn't made to feel welcome and the cold, apathetic service means that I won't be coming back. I'm so sorry to have to give out my first one star review on yelp, and to a place I loved so much. But maybe it will help them make improvements to their service in the future.\\n\\nBy the way, the three people working were a girl with big wavy brown hair and hipster glasses, and a skinny mustached hardly gentleman with blue rimmed glasses.

My only regrets are 1) I don't live closer and 2) I didn't eat here sooner. \\n\\nI was inbetween jobs and decided to make the trek around noon one weekday to Slappy Cakes. I had tried coming here several times before but the traffic discouraged me on the drive in from the Couve. Luck was on my side.

It was different from the one they had online. It would be super if the online and in house menus were consistant.

I've never seen anything short of great service come out of Zach while bartending, he brings great energy along with talent and experience behind the bar. I've had him look out for me in multiple different scenarios and have always thought of him as one of the best bartenders I've ever been served by, very attentive and always the first one to grab me a drink. Working in the restaurant industry myself it's the reviews as vague as the one directed at Zach that bother me the most. Cask N' Flagon on the weekends is constantly busy with both Olivers and the main bar completely packed, the main bar is constantly 4 people deep with customers snapping and trying to flag the bartenders down as rudely as possible. There's also 3 or 4 bartenders on that one bar at a time, for someone to claim they sat there for 45 minutes not getting served sounds slightly suspicious to me. I don't know about anyone else but I know if I was standing at a place at a bar for 10 minutes without anyone noticing or serving me I'd most likely move to a different point of the bar. Being a frequent guest at this bar I've seen how rude and ignorant drunken young adults can be to the employees making it so they have to provide quick and good service while also being treated incredibly poorly by people constantly throughout the night. The fact that that review below was pointing fingers at Zach and only Zach seems slightly more vindictive and personal than a regular guest attending a bar, almost as if the reviewer writing it had more of a personal vendetta against Zach as opposed to a guest with a poor experience. If you weren't served for 45 minutes standing at the bar (that I know Zach wasn't the only one behind) I'm pretty sure that leaves roughly 3 other people behind the bar who never noticed you nor served you. Also, it was stated that on \\"multiple occasions\\" the person writing the review was ignored by Zach, if this had happened previously I'm just not completely clear on why anyone would stand near such a 'horrible' bartender at the bar for 45 minutes and wait for him to serve you if you had already had such a poor experience with him before instead of attempting to get one of the other 3 or however many bartenders attention instead of standing in the same spot you 'weren't being noticed' and then proceed to write a spiteful review.. If you don't make yourself noticed or move around a bar packed full of people trying to get drinks just like you I put part of the responsibility on you, the bartenders are moving as fast as they can and have people constantly yelling, snapping, waving, whatever to get the attention of whomever is behind the bar it's not simple to serve people in an exact order with a bar as packed as Casks is, they are human and they are apt to make mistakes once in awhile. Things like Yelp and OpenTable are really unfortunate in situations like this, I don't think it's fair that someone can take personal issues with someone onto sites like this and interfere and potentially threaten someone's job based upon their personal opinions of a person. Like I said before, Zach is one of the best bartenders at Cask and has constantly made me feel welcome time and time again and was a big part of me repeatedly bringing my business here as opposed to other bars in the city. I've never had anything but good service come from him being behind the bar, walking in Friday night to learn Zach was no longer going to be working at Cask was a huge let down but to then find out what it was that lead to this was the most unfortunate part. Instances such as this alleged one should be brought to the attention of management at the time of the incident as opposed to being written in a review however long later because there's no way to know whether or not the event even occurred or it's just a childish and immature way to get someone into trouble while attempting to embarrass them publicly. It's unfortunate that one seemingly selfish and bratty girls review could force an employee with excellent bar skills, high energy, and a great personality out of the company. I'm overall a huge fan of Cask N' Flagon as an establishment I'm just incredibly disappointed in the actions taken by the company based on one bad, not to mention incredibly vague Yelp review pointed at a bartender that has constantly provided me with nothing but an excellent experience and service over and over again."},{"name":"Island Creek Oyster Bar","address":"500 Commonwealth Ave","city":"Boston","stars":"4.5","text":"The food was great - other reviews elaborate wonderfully, and the Yelp reviews were a great guide for us as we were ordering. My one-star review is for the service, which was actually shockingly rude. I'm a graduate student in Boston and lived in the area for four years before that, and I brought my boyfriend here to introduce him to some New England fare and ambiance (we are both from California).  We had a reservation and arrived on time, but honestly our waitress seemed to have it out for us from the beginning. \\n\\nThe first \\"offense\\" we made was apparently to move one of the chairs at our table so we could sit next to each other (i.e. adjacent sides of a square) instead of across from each other. The waitress immediately swooped over, informed us with he haughtiest attitude ever that such things were not allowed, and glowered at us as we then just opted to sit on one side of the table together. I spent the entire dinner trying to get back on her good side as we politely asked about wines, menu recommendations, and desserts. \\n\\nHer attitude got worse and worse as she found out that we wanted to order a glass of wine instead of a bottle (gasp!), that we asked how many oysters came with an order, and if we could get a plate for sharing one of our appetizers. I've been to some very fancy restaurants in Boston, and at all of them I felt happy because I was paying for both great food and for sophisticated but friendly service. I left this particular experience mortified that I had chosen this place to introduce my boyfriend to Boston - this was NOT at all what I meant when I thought \\"east coast culture\\", and in my experience in the city it is pretty much unprecedentedly bad.

We placed an order of the eggrolls for an appetizer; they arrived quickly and were delicious.  The two of us split a main course as we weren't particularly starving (Eric having downed a humongous bucket of popcorn at the movies) and were also trying to save a little bit of cash.  We got the turkey club sandwich which came with french fries, both of which were very good.  The portion size was large enough that the half plate was filling for both of us.  \\n\\nThe best part about the experience though, were the \\"celebrity sightings.\\"  During the course of our dinner, Red Sox outfielder Jason Bay came in with his adorable daughter to grab his take-out, and pitcher Daniel Bard came in with some companions and was seated in the back of the restaurant.  While this is probably typical on game days, it was great to see some of the players in person.  Also, the waitstaff (who despite the somewhat upscale feel are allowed to wear Sox t-shirts on game days) were very nonchalant about serving the players.  The somewhat intoxicated woman sitting at the bar, however, decided it would be a good idea to make a scene and yell across the place at Bay, who waved and then left with his food.\\n\\nIn short...seems classy, but great food at decent prices (and quieter than the other Fenway-area bars)."},{"name":"Applebee's Grill + Bar","address":"12103 Collegiate Way","city":"Orlando","stars":"2","text":"We will never go there again.

Cheesy, garlicky, buttery noodles good enough for 2 or maybe even 3 people. Second, the crawfish was very flavorful.  You get about a pound I believe of each seafood. I suggest getting the shrimp over the crawfish as you get more meat and I think the shrimp had more flavor. The Cajun fries were yummy but nothing to come back for.

This evening, Madame Butterfly was on the menu.\\n\\nDinner tonight included my mother and sister plus 4 friends, totaling a party of 7.  This is about average for our quarterly visits.\\n\\nImmediately upon driving up to the inconspicuous red awning with small valet podium, my door was opened by a helpful young man who asked if my party would be attending the Opera after dinner.  I told him yes, we were, and he said he would have my car ready and waiting at the close of the show.  \\n\\nWhen I entered the restaurant itself, the Hostess came over to personally greet me by name and comment on how nice it was to see me again.  I asked if the rest of my party had already arrived, as they had, I was shown over to the bar area where they had gathered.\\n\\nI love the ambiance of Morton's.  Every girl knows how good lighting is critical for optimum sexiness, and the light (or semi-lack there of) here achieves a perfect mix.  Candle light on the tables, recessed lighting overhead, pin points highlighting the wines and art along the walls.  Most excellent.\\n\\nCocktails here are fantastic.  I tend to stick with a Grey Goose Cosmo, but I've had sips from one end of the drink menu to the other.  My friend decided to try the Palm Beach Passion, which was very sweet and delicious, and was enjoyed down to the last drop.  Her next adventure in Martinis did not fair as well when she ordered the Raspberry Gimlet, however. I will admit was not nearly as good as the description promised, as it turned out to be very tart, and she wound up having her boyfriend finish it. \\n\\nWith our first drink of the night finished, we were ushered to our table.  Impeccably set and perfectly located.  The waiters changed out white cloth napkins for black ones to match each outfit as to not leave unsightly lint.  A very nice touch I appreciate greatly, as I wear a lot of black.\\n\\nAs this was the first time at Morton's for several party members, it took slightly longer than normal to order.  I assured every last one of them that no matter what they ordered, they would be satisfied.  Decisions were at last made, including the orders for a fresh baked Molten Cake for myself, Apple Pie and Souffl√©s to be shared by a few others.  The hot desserts must be ordered with the meals, as they are then scheduled to come directly from the oven to your table when the appropriate time arrives later in the evening.\\n\\nMy Jumbo Lump Crab Cake (yes, that is singular) appetizer was as tasty as ever.  Other starter orders at the table included a myriad of salads, macaroni and cheese, onion rings, and two additional orders of the Crab Cake.  Forks were passed, samples all around, and each of the guests declared that theirs was the best.\\n\\nMain courses did nothing less than astound the first timers.  I do not believe I have ever heard more compliments on a steak than I did that night.  My filet mignon, butterflied, medium-well was perfect, though I've never had it not be perfect.  The side of steamed asparagus I had ordered was equally done to perfection, firm and flavorful.  Another smashing success accredited to the chefs.\\n\\nBy the time our desserts started arriving, we knew we were going to be pressed to make it to the auditorium before the first act started.  Although we loved our orders, we just did not have the luxury of time to sit and savor.  We had barely 15 minutes before we had to walk across the street and get our seats.  Sadly, we did not even have enough time to finish my beloved cup of coffee.  This would be made up for later with a trip to the Portland City Grill though.\\n\\nI can't say enough about Morton's.  The perfect date destination, a sure bet pre-Opera experience, and the best steaks I have ever had."},{"name":"sweetgreen","address":"372 Congress St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"Amazing healthy food.

The Bloody Mary's are wonderful, the menu is some what limited, but I end up getting the same thing every time anyway, because I enjoy it so much, (the eggs benedict, but the western omelet is great as well, I've had a few bites).  The service is above average and everyone there is very friendly.\\n\\nI have gone for dinner 2-3 times and the meal was very good each time.

Having no experience ordering oysters, I asked for help and received a curated selection of four such specimens, a culinary trip through the waters of Duxbury Bay that gave me a sampling of what I have been missing in California--though it did remind me of the oyster farms in Tomales Bay and Point Reyes. The clam chowder is not an entree-sized soup, and the buttermilk biscuits are more like croutons in shape and size (but not in texture), but it is wonderfully creamy and the pieces of bacon are large and deep with flavor.

No, I am not kidding.  \\n\\nWe fell in love with bucatini all'amatriciana when we were visiting Rome recently, to the point where the restaurant that served it became our neighborhood spot while we were in town.  It was that good.  When we returned to the US, I promptly found bucatini and got to work recreating the sauce as it blew us away with it's simple, yet amazingly savory and luscious taste and texture.  As an aside, I'm still perfecting my recipe.\\n\\nSo, imagine my delight when I was searching for a good place to try in the Pearl and I came across a fellow Yelper's review of their bucatini...oh boy, we must try this place!  We made a reservation for that evening.  \\n\\nOn leaving our cab, we were immediately greeted on the sidewalk by a gentleman asking if we had reservations.  Yes, we did!  We were seated at a two-top adjacent to the bar...I'm sure they didn't mean it this way, but it was a onus for me to be seated near the menu station as I am a dessert-a-holic and the dessert menu was within reach!!! Muahahahaha.  I love being able to plot dinner choices with an eye toward dessert.  \\n\\nI had no idea prior to entering Piazza Italia, but yes, Virginia, there IS an all-futbol-all-the-time channel.  Actually, pretty cool in combination with the futbol jerseys hanging from the ceiling.  Even cooler, everyone there that night appeared to be fluent in Italian.  Fantastic.  I am HOME!\\n\\nWe decided to split everything and ordered the Gino's salad, mushroom bruschetta (cannot remember the exact name) and bucatini all'amatriciana with a notion of saving room for dessert.  Gino's salad came out first.  It was a wonderful combination, and yet the peanuts in there kind of took away from the overall taste.  Not to knock Gino's tastes, it was just different that I expected (which is my bad).  \\n\\nNext up, the bucatini.  The kitchen was nice enough to split the portion and we each dug in.  As soon as the first bite hit the tongue, the talking ceased.  And nirvana was attained.  Mama mia.\\n\\nThe mushroom bruschetta never appeared, and after savoring the salad and pasta honestly wasn't all that missed (not to say that I won't be back to try it later...).  So, after overhearing the server sing the praises of the hazelnut gelato at the table next to ours, we went with that for dessert.  OH. MY.  Love in a sundae glass.  I am surprised the hubs and I didn't end up spoon-fencing over the last little bites of gelato.  He was quite the gentleman and my new name became Hoover.  After basking in the glow of amazing pasta, we decided then and there that we needed to come back to Piazza Italia.  We made a reservation for the following evening with our server, and left feeling truly blissful.\\n\\nNext night, we're back and we manage to nab a window side table.  Knowing that we were ordering the bucatini all'amatriciana again, we plotted our second dish.  After smelling and hearing of the pesto dish from the night before, we went with that.  However, first things first.  We started with a caprese salad this time and while the Roma tomatoes weren't in season, the mozzarella and basil were delicious and carried the tomatoes.  Okay, on to the main event.  Since we ordered two pastas, we had to make a choice when they hit the table.  Hubs nabbed the amatriciana and I got the penne with pesto.  Not such a bad deal, as it turned out.  The pesto was absolutely amazing.  We both kept alternating bites between amatriciana and pesto and back, until all the pasta was gone and we moved to Plan B and used the bread to sop up ALL of the sauce.  We were clean-plate-clubbers that night!  Amazing, amazing stuff.  \\n\\nI want to move to Portland to be near Piazza Italia.  That, or move to Rome, and Portland just seems much closer. :)"},{"name":"Sushi Kiku","address":"2770 Lenox Rd","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3.5","text":"Came here for the lunch buffet.

Mostly local  poets and the occasional song writer. It's a great way to tap into your creative side and wind down before starting the work week.\\n\\n Recently I found myself with a little EXTRA time on my hands during the weekday and thought hmmmm where can I go to relax and get some work done??? Instantly Java Monkey sprang into my mind, and I was on my way. (Note* Finding parking can be a pain, and those meters are ridiculous.  I just pay the $5 and park in the lot up the road and save myself the headache.) As I opened the door to JM the aroma of freshly brewed coffee welcomed me in and seemed to imply \\"you have found your safe haven\\"  I knew I was about to transcend into pure and utter relaxation. Kinda dramatic I know.... but true. The atmosphere can be described as simple, broken-in and cozy. Warm tones and art cover the walls and good music flows from the speakers. The place is scattered with an eclectic mix of people. Each in their own world studying, reading, writing, drawing and of course searching the net.  There is ample seating inside and there is a lovely patio out front, but if you have a large group the seating style might be a problem. Since I'm usually tucked away inside I set up post on the patio. I was pleased when I got my laptop up and running and was able to connect to the internet without having to pay a cent. Starbucks and others like it are soooo lame for charging!\\n\\nThe Monkey obviously has coffee galore, but they also have a variety of teas, juices, beer and wine to choose from. If I'm gonna be working & relaxing might as well have a beer right? And if I'm working, relaxing and having a beer might as well get some grub right? Right! The baristas are friendly and helpful, plus they ID me so that gives bonus points! The food menu is small consisting of salads, sandwiches and tasty items like warm brie cheese served  with apples and hummus served with pita wedges and veggies. I opted for a turkey panini with a side salad and a Sweet Water 420 to set the mood. \\n\\nThings couldn't get any better. As I whittled away at my work, filed my taxes and enjoyed my sandwich a gentle breeze passed by saying \\"This is how a real coffee shop should be. Don't you wish everyday could be a Java Monkey kind of day?\\" I replied with a smile and a swig of my beer.\\n\\n If you are looking for a laid back, offbeat, work/creativity inducing coffee bar with free net connections head to Java Monkey.

We live just outside of Tampa so this is our spot to go to when we want to stay-cay. What we enjoy most about the resort is the excellent service, clean bedrooms, balcony views, restaurants and variety of activities that are included in the resort fee.  \\n\\nArriving to the property you realize how large and well landscaped it is. The valets are always prompt and curteous. The large lobby is a great feature of the property, marble floors, a fountain and I do not know what they pump through the air conditioning but it always smells so good! Check in is usually a breeze, of the roughly ten times we have stayed, they have always upgraded our room to a lake view. There was one occasion where the girl checking us in was not feeling generous enough to upgrade us but we spoke to someone else and they did the following morning. \\n\\nThe restuarants are all great. Primo is the JW's main restaurant. I have noticed a slight decline in the food over the years but it is still a great meal, some dishes can be too salty, but if you pick the right dish, you will thoroughly enjoy it. Primo also has a great wine selection, alot of unique stuff that you wont find anywhere else. Service has always been perfect at Primo, never once have we had even close to a bad experience. If you play your cards right, they might let you taste a variety of their wines. They just opened a more casual restaurant on the property that has some nice craft beers on tap. Great place to drink a beer and grab a quick snack, though the beers are overpriced.\\n\\nOne great thing about the property is that you have access to the Ritz-Carlton just down the hall. At the Ritz is Normans, which is their flagship restaurant. I would highly recommend eating at Normans, we did this for the first time last month and it was fantastic. I had the Chef's Tasting Menu and it was nne of the best meals Ive had.\\n\\nYou also have access to the pool at the Ritz, if the lazy river is a little too busy for you, the Ritz is much more quiet. My wife and I will spend a little time at both. You cant beat the lazy river though, get yourself a drink and float around all day. The hot tubs are great as well.\\n\\nIncluded in your resort fee is access to the golf facilities. The Grande Lakes has a great practice facility. I generally spend my mornings at the practice facility for a couple hours then head over to the lazy river. If you forget your golf attire or clubs the clubhouse will provide you with clothes, shoes and the newest model of TaylorMade clubs. They have a nice gym and spa as well.\\n\\nAt the end of the day, hang out on the balcony and check out Orlando lit up at night. I recommend getting the highest floor possible as the views of the golf course, lake and city are great. The rooms are clean and neat, bathrooms are spacious with a shower and tub, the beds are very comfortable and clean as well."},{"name":"Gennaro's Eatery","address":"12 Blanchard Rd","city":"Quincy","stars":"4","text":"A family-friendly spot with generous portions.

What tipped me over the edge was the hostess I talked to tonight said \\"oh just ask for more broth it's no big deal\\". But when I paid the waiter charged me $3 just for extra broth. Look, nothing should be \\"free\\", but to scalp your loyal customer on broth is essentially saying your preference is not important to us, we're gonna count everything. If I ordered extra noodles of course charge me, an extra scoop of broth since you give less now is not cool. They could have warned me there was a charge!

For a girl who doesn't generally like biscuits and gravy, I was impressed with Moonshine's;  the gravy was a couple steps up from most I've had and believe was chipotle flavored.

It was good, different, and the sauce taste great with it.  The sausage comes with sliced fresh garlic and is homemade by the owner himself.

The simple burger has been revamped and rehashed so many times that the varieties of toppings and accouterments are endless. It has been lowered in quality and sold for bargain basement prices, slapped alongside cold french fries and discounted with processed cheeses. But that is not a  true hamburger, it is merely its over-processed counterpart. My motto has always been to keep it simple and if you can impress me with fewer ingredients of quality and substance, you will have an ideal burger experience to offer.\\n\\nI present to you, Moderne Burger. In a quaint strip of Broadway in Kitsilano, Moderne Burger has been making their burgers, fries, and milkshakes from scratch for years and they are a Vancouver culinary staple. Their simplistic approach brings forth the true meaning of a great burger. Simple hand made steak burgers made fresh daily. No preservatives to be found, no fillers to bulk it up, and no seasoning to distract from what the best burger stands for. They have branched out from beef to also offer a ground turkey, veggie, or wild salmon filet option as well.\\n\\n\\nA towering plate of fresh hand cut fries and our piping hot burgers are brought out to us looking devilishly good. The owner takes a moment to explain a tried and true technique for getting the most of your burger including handling instructions and an excellent tip to create a raft of fries below your burger on the plate. Resting your dripping burger on the fries allows the beefy drippings to fall between them and keep your burger bun crisp and dry. Your reward is beef basted fries that soak up the juice and flavor of your burger. The toppings are custom selected by you, mine was a bacon, cheddar, mushroom burger and it was loaded and amazing. The fries take me right back to growing up, when my dad would use an old tool that looked like a potato masher on its side and would slide the fresh garden potatoes into neat fries for frying. The only thing that could make my fry experience substantially better would be gravy. A homemade rich beefy gravy that would compliment the fries.\\n\\n\\nAside from the 50's diner decor and quaint airy atmosphere, there is one thing that makes a lunch or dinner here so worth it. CHOCOLATE CHERRY MILKSHAKE...amazing! Probably the best milkshake I have had in this city thus far. Exploding with flavor and a rich and creamy companion to my burger and fries. The perfect dessert style beverage to top this meal."},{"name":"Simha Authentic Multi Cuisine Fine Dine Restaurant & Bar","address":"5486 Chamblee Dunwoody Rd, Ste 13","city":"Dunwoody","stars":"3.5","text":"Dunwoody.

Naturally, I had pretty high expectations for this restaurant. In general, the experience wasn't bad at all: food presentation, selection, and service were all decent. However, the sushi quality just wasn't there.\\n\\nI came here a month ago with my family on a Saturday night. The place was packed but we only had to wait 10 minutes before a table freed up. The restaurant has modest decorations and reminds me the most of an Asian hibachi buffet. Food trays are displayed along the front wall of the restaurant, with a hibachi/ramen area towards the left side, sushi along the middle, and more varied selections (desserts and fried foods) toward the right hand side.\\n\\nThey do offer direct food preparation for you at the hibachi station, sushi requests behind the counter, and even a crepe station (!!). The hibachi station was average Asian buffet quality, and the handrolls you can request were pretty tasty (only way to get eel from the menu). The crepe station was so-so, the crepes were small and the toppings were too large and clumsy to fit inside them.\\n\\nOnto the sushi which I really didn't enjoy. The quality of the fish was just not fresh. The raw fish they serve doesn't have that fresh fish do. I hate to say it, a lot of the nigiri I tried tasted straight out of a cheap Asian buffet. The selection is pretty poor in terms of the sushi. I was hoping for more \\"traditional\\" nigiri rolls like sea urchin, chutoro, and maybe otoro. Even the eel sushi wasn't displayed unless you requested for it.\\n\\nThe quality and selection of the rolls are fine. There are probably 10 varieties of sushi rolls you can choose from, which is pretty nice. Since the taste is masked by all the sauce you don't really have to worry about the taste of the fish.\\n\\nI honestly prefer the non-sushi items more. They have a row of sashimi inspired trays that all were pretty tasty to eat, among them the mackerel and raw beef dish stood out to me. The octopus balls were fun to eat with all the toppings on it, but were fried way harder than traditionally done.\\n\\nOverall, I am disappointed. What's the point of going to a dedicated sushi buffet when the quality of the fish can't beat Chinese buffet sushi?

I was really excited for this spot out of all the restaurants we had bookmarked because Vietnamese food is life. Fish sauce is life! But not these fish sauce wings tho. These wings are wayyyyyyyy overpriced. The wings itself were good, but the fish sauce was disappointing and definitely not worth $16. There was a lot of flavor, but not the good kind. The fish sauce was very subtle. They were more like excessively salted honey wings. I found myself downing two cups of water there and getting up to pee multiple times that night. If they were called Pok Pok honey and salt wings, I wouldn't be mad. I'm just glad I didn't have to wait in line for this. Also, they ran out of mango sticky rice.

There is a full bar with very interesting cocktails and a number of imported and local beers and ales.

The interior was large and the pleasant enough, if nothing particularly remarkable. \\n\\nWhile I was somewhat tempted to cop out and go with one of their non-Korean dishes like the Pad Thai (which a dining companion said was tasty, by the way!), I decided to  do things properly and order something Korean. The list of lunch specials caught my eye--I'll never turn down a Bento box with lots of different elements--and after a moment of thought, I went with the pork bulgogi (it was the only spicy lunch box option besides the Kimchi stew, and I wasn't prepared for that). \\n\\nIt turns out, the pork bulgogi lunch box was an excellent idea. The pork was seriously delicious: the sauce was delicious with a bit of a kick to it and the cut of the pork was excellent (well-sliced and lean). The various elements of the bento box were also quite tasty--the ginger dressing on the salad was solidly good, the two little dumplings quite tasty, the fried rice not too greasy, and the California roll pieces nice and fresh. Others at my table enjoyed the Kalbi a great deal, as well as one of the Chigae dishes. \\n\\nAll in all, this was a very positive first experience...

I've done this before making queso at home (which can be fixed once you recognize the look/taste), but I can't believe that the queso is made fresh, in-house, for every order...? If so, then just another off day for the chef I suppose....if not, the recipe seriously needs some work.

They don't have cheap beers other than PBR, which I guess you can't be cool if you don't serve. I wasn't impressed, but I didn't leave angry.

I loved the chewiness of the noodles. The dipping sauce is much more concentrated than ramen broth, which allows you to get the flavors of it without drinking it.

It's 3:30 in the afternoon , you've got no plans for the evening and you spontaneously decide to have a drink after work at a place you've never been to. The drink's great, the place is great, and while at the bar, you hit it off with an extremely attractive stranger. Chemistry, sizzle and...the possibility of fireworks? Why not? You're on a spontaneous kick tonight. You give in and have one of the best nights of your life.\\n\\nBut wait! There's more!\\n\\nThe stranger is not only good but also seems to genuinely want to see you again. Can you say jackpot? Not bad for a spontaneous, spur-of-the-moment decision from your usual humdrum routine.\\n\\nWell, my experience at Bistro du Midi was the culinary equivalent of this scenario. Enduring another hump of the week, I decided to liven things up by going to this gorgeous French restaurant on the spur of the moment. It turned out to be one of the best dining experiences I've ever had.\\n\\nThe restaurant is beautiful in a simple, \\"less is more\\" d√©cor kind of way. The servers and wait staff are all attentive without being obtrusive, friendly without being \\"Hi, my name is Derek, this is my life story including why I want to be an actor and how I wound up being a waiter instead\\"-type friendly.\\n\\nAnd the food! Oh, the food! (The food is the sex part of the above analogy, in case you weren't sure.) The prawn appetizer came with the biggest, juiciest, most tender prawns ever, in a dried tomato and basil sauce so good, you WILL lick it up like a dog. I had the seared duck breast, which was perfectly cooked, accompanied by the lightest, fluffiest little gnocchi. My boyfriend had fall-off-the-bone tender lamb. Both entrees reached those physical heights--several times.\\n\\nThen dessert. If the appetizer was foreplay, the entrees were sex, dessert was the post-coital whatever-you-dos (cuddle, smoke) that make the whole experience complete. And boy did these complete. The frozen orange and almond cake was cold, refreshing, sweet, moist and flavorful. I think my boyfriend saw God when he had his first bite of the chocolate fondant--warm, gooey, perfectly textured. Finally, cocktails are under $15 (in the Back Bay? Inconceivable!) and I highly recommend the P√©quante if you like citrus.\\n\\nAsk to be seated by the window if you're going anytime soon. The view of the Public Gardens is always breathtaking, but right now, if they put you near the private room, you'll be surrounded by springtime dogwood blossoms lit up by subtly placed twinkling lights. Gorgeous.\\n\\nOh, and the part about wanting to see you again? The big homemade nougat pieces to take home--compliments of the chef. Damn right I'm coming back!"},{"name":"Moonshine Patio Bar & Grill","address":"303 Red River St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"All I have to say is wow!

Spaghetti. Oh my god, the noodles are salty. Why/how are the noodles this salty?! 1 singular cheese ravioli. SOB, it's wrapped in the same pasta as the spaghetti. Even the sausage was too salty or maybe it just seemed that way because I tried the noodles first. And their was the most pathetic little piece of chicken next to it. It was incredibly sparsely breaded. Like they started breading it and then decided it wasn't worth the effort, or maybe ran out of bread crumbs, not really sure what the deal was there. They somehow managed to make the small amount of breading added incredibly soggy. How did they get the chicken so soggy and wet? Did they cook this in the ocean? Is that why everything is so salty?

A few friends and I decided to take our parents out to dinner and decided on P.I.  Upon arriving, a notorious eater in our group decided on getting the special...I believe it was a lamb dish, which he promptly devoured.  The servers were so impressed at his eating prowess, they decided to bring another round.   After the second round was promptly devoured, they brought him a dessert.  Not only did they comp the second helping, they also didn't charge for the dessert.  \\n\\nAs a frequent diner, I've become familiar with a few members of the staff.  Commonly the servers are members of Ginos family with their strong Italian heritage.  Subsequently, the accents are a dead giveaway as to who is family and who is just ... \\"the help.\\"  I noticed that a former busboy was now serving.  While being the only blonde haired server, curly hair, converse sneakers, and American jeans, he was a dead giveaway as part of \\"the help\\".  After approached our table, he rambled through the daily specials in a thick Italian accent.  It's one thing to have an accent, it's another to put on an act.  His veiled attempted at emulating an Italian accent was so comical, the entire table could barely contain our laughter every time he approached.  Upon a return visit, it was confirmed that not only was our server, who I'll keep nameless, born and raised in a Southwest Portland suburb but also had no reason to put on such an performance.  It's not my place to complain about someone acting while still doing a good job, but if you are going to sell us the routine, at least wear some pumas and tighter jeans. Master the Euro look, and nobody will question it.  And If you want to get really serious with it, mix in the Milan Mullet.  Anyone who has recently traveled to Italy will know exactly what I'm talking about.\\n\\nNB: A few reviews mentioned poor service from the servers.  I have never once experienced poor service.  I've found the staff incredibly engaging from jokingly offering to poison a friends meal since he was wearing a jersey from a rival Italian soccer club to dancing with a date in the middle of the restaurant.

We passed and ordered the following instead:\\nCedar Plank Salmon\\nHill Country BBQ Baby Back Ribs\\nPimiento Cheeseburger \\n\\nThe server was a little slow getting to us for extra ketchup and refills through the hour we were there. The sweet tea had too much ice making it very watery. Also, the ribs were surprisingly too sweet and lacked BBQ sauce and none served on the side making it quite dry-also several parts were very hard. Now you get a lot of ribs so be sure to get a side or two (plate comes with complimentary side) to keep your mouth from being overwhelmed by the sweet taste and fat from the ribs.\\n\\nThe salmon and cheese burger were quite good, both giving likable tastes but for the $70 we paid after tax I was not thrilled or blown away.\\n\\nI wished there was more of a friendly atmosphere brought by the staff. The server gave decent service but still didn't feel personal enough-not checking in as much as we'd like for refills or to get more ketchup (since no bottles were available at the table) or asking the right questions about our experience like, did your food taste good or was it to your liking or how could we make it better? \\nAlso, the hosts are the customer's first impressions of your restaurant (besides the atmosphere) so put someone there that makes you feel at home and welcome, dare I say valued? When you drop $15-25 a plate you'd expect that kind of service.\\n\\nLastly, the seats were quite close so at times it was hard to have a conversation with my spouse. Expect to be seated near large groups inside and outside seating is maybe 4-5 tables so not much.

Saturday, 1:30PM at the bar, seemed a bit more casual and comfortable than the typical ambience I've seen passing by at dinner hours. I want to eat great seafood, but I don't want to be in a crowd of wannabe yacht clubbers. I was slightly disappointed at times, but I can't bring myself to put less than four stars because the oysters were truly the best I've had. I have to add a demerit for the staff, though. It was hard to identify which bartender would continue to serve us as they rotated around seemingly doing tasks to flip to dinner service. The bartender's banter was friendly but a little awkward at times. My partner and I were asked where we were from, and the ensuing conversation sounded like they were used to out of towners. You know, the typical grad student from New Jersey trying to tell you where the real hidden gems of the city are. Anyway, after some drinks, oysters, and a crab dip - the initially attentive bartender vanishes and we're trying to flag him down for round two and some entrees. I'm a bit more forceful getting his attention when I hear him explain to the couple next to us that they were ending the lunch menu to prep for dinner. Still not really beyond lunch hours and not noted anywhere on the menu or website. Get our entrees in, just a couple sandwiches which were pretty good - not outstanding. My partner had the crab cake sandwich which had a bit of a sriracha kick and a sweet, light taste. Not the typical Maryland crab cake. I went with the fried fish sandwich that I thought tasted just a little too much like a Filet-O-Fish. A few capers were hidden in the greens that set it off a bit, but fell short of leaving an impression for $16. But what really grinds my gears was that after a different bartender got our check, OG bartender comes back and picks up my signed receipt - I say thank you again, but he doesn't hear me - and seemingly examines it near the register. Yes we got a large amount of food, yes I paid, and yes I still tipped 20%.

There were 4 of us so we each ordered different drinks and they were all good. The appetizers (grilled octopus, tuna tartar, grilled foie gras) were also very good. Then the rest of the meal went straight downhill from there.\\nOur entrees (Mediterranean Sea bass, roasted chicken for 2, and mussels w/fries) took forever to come out. We knew the chicken took 45 min and that was fine but when our chicken was done it was brought out to our table to be shown then taken back to the kitchen to be carved up and this took another 30 min. When we finally got our meal, our fish was cold and everything else was luke warm with the exception of the French fries (only hot item). It seemed like the rest of our entrees were sitting around until our side order was being prepared. Oh and the roasted chicken was undercooked as it was pink when we cut into the thigh meat.  The fish was just awful so when we complained to our waitress about the cold fish and luke warm entrees, etc. she gave us an attitude and said \\"what do you want me to do about it\\". All of us were just stunned by her complete lack of concern but at least she had the common sense to speak with the manager. Anyway John (I think that was his name) came over and tried to make it up to us by not charging for the fish and giving us complimentary dessert sampler on top of the chocolate souffl√© we had ordered at the beginning. Overall our dinner for 4 of us cost around $340 and took 3 hrs. and by the end of the evening all of us just wanted to get out of there.  We should have just gone to Mistral as their service and food is always spot on. Anyway we will probably avoid this place for dinner but who know we may consider giving it another try for brunch as their brunch menu looked really good."},{"name":"Piazza Italia","address":"1129 NW Johnson St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Ambiance was delightful.

Today I got the pesto omelet, which also had organic spinach and fresh tomatoes as a part of every bite I took. \\n\\nAlso, I ate dinner at Counter Culture earlier in the week and had their new vegan/vegetarian pizza. The cheese - that Counter Culture makes in house - is something that I would travel far and wide to purchase. It's not oily like the tasty, but processed, Daiya cheese that some places/people are getting into these days. I've had dairy cheese on pizza, Daiya cheese and assorted vegan cheeses that they sell at Whole Foods...but the cheese that Counter Culture makes and puts on their pizza literally makes me want to eat one of their weekly special pizzas EVERY DAY. (I know the employees would think I was that weirdo eating pizza every day, but it would be worth it for my taste buds...)\\n\\nAlso...I must note that since I've tried to switch to predominantly a plant-based vegan diet, I feel so happy knowing that no animals were killed for what I'm eating. I mean, I got no beef with cows and pigs. And have you seen where a \\"free range\\" egg comes  from? I have. (Trust me, you don't want to be a free range chicken...) \\n\\nEating at Counter Culture and other vegan restaurants like this is a real treat. I expect 30 years in the future when all of our seafood is too full of mercury and toxins to eat...and when people start to make the correlation between heart disease and eating animal products, restaurants like Counter Culture will be noted for being way ahead of their time.\\n\\nThough I think if people really want to help the environment, they'll start digging on stuff at CC like the spelt biscuit and gravy and (one of my favorite items) the artichoke dip appetizer.\\n\\nINITIAL REVIEW:\\n\\nI typically like to get their omelet filled with fresh veggies, but today I got the tofu rancheros instead.

I can honestly say I have NEVER had a bad dish here. NEVER. Some of my favorites would be...ok this is hard, because it's basically everything...\\nAppetizers:\\n- The mussels. I sometimes find that the mussels by themselves are enough as a meal. They typically offer two different types, one in a white wine sauce and another that typically rotates. \\n- Tartare. The type of fish rotates, but it tends to always be made in a sesame oil sort of sauce. Delicious.\\n- Oyster sliders. Out of this world. Absolutely phenomenal. Heaven on a mini brioche roll. Drooling just thinking of it. \\n- Crab cake. Simply orgasmic. Must order it. \\nSoups:\\n- Clam chowder. They put mini biscuits in it. Need I say more?\\nEntrees:\\n- Honestly, never had a bad fish entree here. Their trout is usually my favorite, what they cook it with rotates often. \\nSides/\\"for the table\\":\\n- THE BISCUIT. HOLY YUM. HOLY.YUM.\\n\\n2) The bartenders are awesome. To say they are nice or awesome would be understatements. They are incredibly knowledgeable with both food and drinks.  I am particularly obsessed with the Air Mail cocktail. mmmm. They also have an awesome house Pilsner. Please don't go here expecting a Coors Light, because you won't get it. You'll get quality beers, instead. \\n\\n3) Their oysters are consistently of very, very high quality. The Island Creeks are STILL my favorite. NOMZ.

There were few people in the restaurant which we were excited about because we thought we'd get faster service. It took about 5 minutes for someone to finally greet us and when they did, we explained we had a big group and that we'd prefer a table. The server acknowledged the request, and then walked us to a booth. Thankfully it was the bigger one so we all fit (albeit, uncomfortably) but this was the first red flag. \\n\\nThe server didn't return for almost 15 minutes. When he did arrive, we ordered our meals in hopes to speed things along. One of the guys in our group began a timer once we ordered just to see. \\n\\n50 MINUTES LATER... They deliver our food. I ordered a steak salad and it was missing the steak. They brought the steak 5 minutes later and it was cold and severely overcooked. Another persons grilled shrimp were so old and overcooked they had to be returned. Another person had a wrong order and that had to go back.\\n\\nAll in all, this was a mess. The server was in the weeds with our one table, they kept making excuses but then cold food is delivered. We never were offered refills on drinks.

You just have to have a functional set of taste buds.   \\n\\nSmoothies and juice, you ask? Raw stuff?What's so special about that? There are about a bazillion places you can get a smoothie! \\n\\nDo other places have as diverse a juice/smoothie menu? No. I mean, you can get durian and papaya in your smoothies! Vegetable smoothies! Smoothies with cayenne and Himalayan sea salt! And all the smoothies, juices, and foodstuffs that they make and sell are vegan and raw, if you are so inclined.   \\n\\nMy personal favorites are the Manic Organic with spirulina and mint (they have smoothie add-ins for a little bit extra) and the Cosmic Trigger; however, I've been to all the locations and had a lot of their drinks. I've never been disappointed. \\n\\nThey sell kale chips, which are tasty. I haven't tried much of their raw/vegan food menu, but I adore their sushi. Coming from an avid lover of all things seafood, this is a high accomplishment. The texture and flavor, which is supposed to mimic spicy tuna, I presume, is really great. Not that similar to the real thing, but delicious in its own right. They serve it with a sauce that is both sweet and savory. I really dig it.\\n\\nMy only misgiving about this place is the perception that because it's got only vegan and raw things, it's far superior in health to other places. If you are getting a juice drink made only with fruit or vegetable juice, you're probably right. But, the other, admittedly delicious, smoothies have things like coconut oil, which has a ton of saturated fat. Also, a lot of the add-ins are interesting and some add flavor, but I think the health claims associated with them might not be entirely based in science. \\n\\nMy advice? Go to Daily Juice!

Some locations also offer protein options for your salad for about $2.50 extra.

We ordered a bunch of different dishes and each set of them took way longer than you would expect.\\n--- The tapas concept: hmm. This is what I'm confused about with this restaurant. The size of the portions aren't tapas style; they are small entree sized. If it were only two of us, we would have had enough with just ordering our own plate or two. You def. don't need three or four here. The size is just weird. I want the dishes to be slightly smaller so you can taste more, or slightly bigger to fill up on one.\\n--- I didn't like the sausage dish. The potato hash was luke warm, the sausage wasn't a great flavor. Also, not that this was part of the dish, but we ordered 6 items, and the sausage and cheese/honey plate were the last two to come. The cheese plate came, and then a few minutes later the sausage came. It was a strange order - would have been nice if they considered that and brought the dishes in a more organized way so the meal made more sense.\\n--- They don't offer to change out your plates and silverware. This is annoying when you have a strong dish like the bison short ribs with a great, strong sauce, and then they serve you cheese and honey. We had to ask for a new set up, which we got, but felt like we were annoying the server. \\n\\nPro-Tip: Expect a bit of a wait, but there is a pretty solid bar right down the street, and they'll give you a call when your table is ready so you can enjoy a drink without worrying about losing your spot in line (also a good!)."},{"name":"Pok Pok","address":"3226 SE Division St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"The chicken here was delicious but a little too salty for my liking.

Once a long time ago and the experience was not memorable.  The most recent visit, a week or so ago was so appalling, I'll never be going back again.  All of my SE Portland Thai love goes to Kuhn Pic's!\\n\\nSo get this...\\nThere are 6 of us and we all stumble through our orders (it's always fun ordering things that aren't in English).  We order a lot of food.  Also, first timers note they \\"season\\" their water with something and it tastes like corn tortilla chips.  Our appetizers come out no issues.  Main courses come out though and they combined multiple orders that different people ordered w/o us knowing.  So 4 out of the 6 are chowing away while 2 of us are still nibbbling on our papaya salad waiting hungrily for our main course.  When our waiter finally shows up and we say that we're still waiting for 2 dishes we discover that 2 shrimp orders were combined so one guy inhaled all of 2 people's shrimp and one dish was incorrectly given to another person and one dish was still missing.  So we get that straightened out but by the time the last person got their food everyone was practically done eating so we asked the server (a new one every time I swear) to box it for us.  The following exchange goes verbatim as follows:\\n*Server: Do you want to box it or do you want me to box it? \\n*Customer: It doesn't matter, whatever is easiest. \\n*Server: Weeelll, honestly it would be easier if you boxed it....I don't want to sound lazy or anything, but I am.  \\n*Entire table: Stares, mouths drop open in disbelief/confusion.  \\n*Customer: Uhhh OK?  \\n*Server leaves, entire table then looks at eachother and was like, WTF?  Who admits that they're too lazy to box up someone's food?  Maybe it came out wrong?  What the hell?  \\n* Approx 2 minutes later the server comes back out and says \\"On second thought, I'll go ahead and box that up for you\\". \\n* YIKES! We are NOT eating that~  Who KNOWS what she did to that poor food.  \\n\\nSo, as I'm sure you can imagine, my issue was the service.  All throughout dinner it was slow and confusing and not very friendly.  Two bonuses to this story:\\n(1) I get nauseous on the way home and throw up.  Nice huh? May or may not have been related to the food I ate, but still not a good memory that's attached to that outing nonetheless. \\n(2) A week later my boyfriend sees on his bank statement that they charged us TWICE for different amounts.  One for ours and one random number (that was higher).  When he called back to complain/get the situation fixed they argued with him relentlessly until they actually pulled out the paperwork from that night and realized they F***ed up and ran his card twice for two different tabs.  Someone got a free meal that night.  But c'mon seriously?  Why wouldn't you pull the damn paperwork out in the first place before arguing and ultimately making yourself look like an IDIOT."},{"name":"The Daily Catch","address":"323 Hanover St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"The yummiest meal ever!

Our waitress was there immediately and was very patient that it was our first time (we were dithering) and was very helpful.  I told her I was a vegetarian and complimented the diverse menu, and she even said they could omit meat from certain dishes to make them veggie also.  Awesome!\\n\\nThe wine list was quite nice and reasonable.\\n\\nThe bread was homemade and way too decadent, feeling guilty....\\n\\nThe house salad was $2.00 in addition to an entree and definitely worth the price.

Now I know why Weight Watchers says if you're planning on taking an overly large entree home, ask for the doggie bag right away.  Normally I'm a good bunny, but not this time, LOL.

Probably not, though there hasn't been a title yet that I wanted that I didn't find. But they are the anti-Amazon. I can come to Powell's and feel surrounded by books and book lovers, roam aisle after aisle, stairway after stairway, and always find something that draws my attention.

The bartenders were helpful and engaging, making us feel like we weren't in the way with so many people, not an easy task, since we were very much in the way of a lot of people. We sat for dinner at a big table in the middle of the dining area, and had an awesome time. Our waitress was awesome, extremely helpful with suggestions, always available, and even joined in on some of the playful banter that was being tossed around at the table. \\n\\nThe food was really great. We got a huge sampling of oysters, all I can say is I enjoyed all 6 or so of the varieties I tried (there are 15-20 on the menu). The chowder looked amazing, but I didn't try it. I had a lobster roll, which had a ton of delicious lobster meat with just a touch of mayo and seasoning, perfectly done. The roll was pretty big and tasty, but I was full enough by then that I just ate most of the lobster with a fork and took bites of the roll. The desserts were alright, nothing special. My buddy did get a french press looking contraption with his coffee, which was a fun touch. \\n\\nIf you're looking for oysters and a drink, this is a really cool spot to come to, right in the heart of Kenmore. If you're looking for a nice dinner, it's still a cool spot, but there's probably better food nearby.

It's really dark inside and despite the candle at each table, if you have poor eyesight feel free to whip out your phone for extra light.\\n\\nTo start off, my boyfriend and I each ordered a glass of wine and settled on the appetizer of the day, Lobster Crab Cake. It was small, but the flavor was HUGE! It was incredibly creative and I would never think to put those flavors together. There were 2 sauces on the plate: a creamy sauce that had a hint of nutmeg or cinnamon and a strawberry sriracha citron sauce. It went incredibly well together. There were nice chunks of lobster in the cake. The only con was that I found a piece of the shell in it.\\n\\nWe then ordered the Dry Aged Steak for 2, Jalapeno Creamed Corn, and the Mac & Cheese. The steak came out sliced and the server's presentation of this dish was unique and flawless. We ordered it medium, but I think it came out closer to medium well. Despite this, the meat was delicious and very tender. The Mac & Cheese was nothing too spectacular, but the corn had this really great smokey flavor that went very well with the steak.\\n\\nWe finished the night off with the Banana Ice Cream topped Bread Pudding. It was heaven. I would recommend this dessert.\\n\\nThe service was wonderful and our server was incredibly bubbly and fun. I do have some complaints about the server who seemed to be in charge of refilling the glasses. Every time he came to refill our glasses, he reached across the table and cut off our conversation.

The bread wasn't grilled that much, the cheese wasn't melty, it wasn't oozing with mayo.. you know. The typical unhealthy sandwich? And the worst part? The man chose pumpernickel bread.\\n\\n=/\\n\\nI would never choose pumpernickel bread because if you know me, I stay away from anything vegan, natural, and healthy cuz that stuff tends to be bland, grainy, gritty, and just yuck. But this time around I was pleasantly surprised to say the least. The bread was SO soft, moist, flavorful, but not overpowering. I still have no clue what pumpernickel is but can now proudly say I am a fan. The Vermont cheddar perfectly mild and melted JUST right! And the pastrami. Good LORD! It was more tender than slow cooked ribs and basically melted in my mouth. The only thing I didn't like were the pickles... they were a tad bland, but everything else made up for it.\\n\\nSam's is definitely one of my favorite places.\\n\\n*note: I went back everyday for the remainder of my stay in Boston and ate almost all the specialty sandwiches on the menu.

But here goes...\\n\\nI've been to Pok Pok several times and took awhile to get why people loved it so much.  Maybe I opted for some of their more boring dishes or was too cheap about it, but tonight I get it.  Finally, I get it.\\n\\nHere's how to replicate my experience:\\n\\nGet the Thai Iced Thea with lime juice (instead of the milk).  This was surprisingly awesome.\\n\\nGet the Muu Paa Kham Waan (boar collar meat).  This was the best dish by far.  I couldn't get enough of the meat with tangy and sweet flavors of a freshly made sauce.\\n\\nGet the Papaya Pok Pok, one of the best papaya salads I've had in town.\\n\\nPass on the Muu Sateh.  Not that they're bad, but the are forgettable after trying the previous dishes.\\n\\nOn the fence:  Kung Yak Phao.  They were good, but I thought a bit expensive at $3.50 per prawn.  It wasn't the standout dish, but it's not a common menu item either.  \\n\\nWe also got the coconut ice cream sandwich.  I wasn't super excited to see the sweet bun, but the filling was great. The ice cream itself was a little too icy, but the flavor was there.\\n\\nExcellent food.  The service was adequate.  They did a great job, but there's always a feeling that they're in a rush, which doesn't cut it for five stars.  It's a busy place, so there is their excuse.\\n\\nI'm mostly just glad that I finally get why Pok Pok is such a hit.

Upon opening a new location on Northside Dr. (conveniently right behind my job) I took it upon myself to purchase some of their notoriously yummy food.  My first attempt at placing an order here took place on a Saturday evening.  They were not terribly busy, and the parking lot looked nice and clean.  I placed my large order for myself and some hungry friends at home.  I remember thinking how clear the freshly installed speaker box sounded.  Upon arriving home I was missing an entire order of nuggets, straws, the sauces I had asked for, and one of the drink orders was incorrect.  For the record, the order was paid in full including the missing items.  I called the store and spent about 20 minutes on hold and weeding through the younger management.  Once I finally spoke to the manager, I was offered a free meal at my next visit. I ended up splitting the food I had purchased so that everyone would have something to eat.  Being a giver of second chances, I have returned to this Chic-Fil-A twice since the first occurrence. Both of these times (including the free meal) there was no sense of professionalism from the staff and the food was not to par.

Prices didn't appear to be all outdoors. Things were looking mostly up! \\n\\nUpon entering at 9pm, I was told by the waiter to make decisions fast, because the kitchen closed at 10pm. There's the stellar customer service! Whatever. We did actually make very fast decisions, and then waited 10 minutes for the guy to take our order while our paper menus lay closed on the table. \\n\\nThings we ordered included a chicken tikka masala, a lamb korma, broccoli naan, and kheer.

The broccoli naan, while novel (I've never seen it anywhere before), was soggy, but what are you going to do? \\n\\nMy main problem with this place (and you may find it frivolous but it freaked me out), was one of the waiters. Waiter #1 who greeted us had his hands full bringing our food over to the table, and waiter #2 was assisting him with naan, rice, etc. After waiter #2 put things down, he grabbed my napkin that was still on the table, unfolded it, and attempted to put it on my lap. My pulled-into-the-table, non-exposed lap. I grabbed the napkin out of his hand with a terse \\"No, I'm fine\\" before he could tuck me in completely. While I hope he picked up on my muted (but still hostile) napkin grab, he then did it to my mom too! No \\"sorry\\"s, \\"excuse me\\"s, no words at all. \\n\\nNever in my life have I been touched by a waiter at a restaurant. I don't know if it's a traditional thing that I haven't yet experienced or if it's just something this guy does, but I thought it was entirely inappropriate.

Too often when we meet an owner, they act like you are the lucky one being graced by their efforts and in all-too-typical Austin fashion, they run out of menu items, discontinue others, and make tons of excuses how it isn't their fault. Again, there have been exceptions. Counter to the common experience that we have had, J.T. is warm, friendly, and exceedingly passionate about the food that he cooks and the ingredients that he uses, always saying \\"I just got this x from so-and-so and you gotta try it!!\\"\\nA fantastic experience all around and only one small complaint - they are a little chintzy with the side sauces. I ran out of the undetermined but delicious fried pickle sauce after the first pickle and the caramel didn't make it to the end of the desert either. \\nThe owner being who he is, I bet he does something about that if he ever reads this.\\nxo"},{"name":"Chung Ki Wa","address":"27 Riverside Ave","city":"Medford","stars":"3.5","text":"Entrees were very good homestyle recipes made with fresh ingredients.

That being said, Cantina is atrocious. Before my trip, I researched favorite counter service options in Epcot and this place showed up time and time again, so I put it on my must-visit list. Big mistake! I should have surveyed Yelp instead, because the sentiments here are far more accurate. \\nBecause we had a late dinner reservation at Ohana that night, we ate a very late lunch this day (4pm). When we reached Cantina, it was fairly empty, except for the kamikaze birds dive-bombing the patio area. (According to other reports, this is usually not the case - because Mexico is the first pavilion people visit in the showcase, it's very crowded and difficult to find seating.) We ordered the chicken tacos and cheese empanadas. The girl at the counter was very friendly and helpful and smiled when I ordered everything in Spanish. So, I will give the \\"service\\" part of counter service its due. We got our food and easily found a table. That was where the pleasant part of this experience ended. We were promptly attacked by tons of birds, all desperate to get a piece of our lunch. They were relentless and annoyed us through the whole meal, despite the fact that we changed tables twice to move away from them. Most of the tables and chairs were covered in the messes they left and it was pretty gross - not the type of experience I expect at Disney, that's for sure. A cast member was trying to clean the tables, but it was a futile effort trying to keep up with the birds.There are signs everywhere telling people NOT to feed the birds, but people are stupid and feed them anyway, which is why they think harassing humans is perfectly okay. Stop feeding the birds, people! Duh!\\n\\nI hoped our food would be the saving grace of this sub-par outdoor dining experience, but it was equally bad. My chicken tacos were flavorless and used stringy, low quality meat. They looked incredibly pathetic - just some sad gray chicken tossed in a stale tortilla with no topping or anything. Weak and definitely not worth the $10, that's for sure. The cheese empanada was extremely strange looking (fried and covered in shredded cheese and guacamole) and whoever heard of a cheese empanada anyway? I realize that the World Showcase is not exactly the best place to go for authentic cuisine, but even mall food court Mexican is more tasty and authentic than this garbage. Yuck!\\n\\nThe only good part of this experience is that as we were leaving Epcot that day, one of the cast members approached us and asked us to review our Epcot experience. Well, what do you know - one of the questions was about our dining experience and we let them know how un-Disney like it was and how disappointed we were. I sincerely hope they work on this place, because it could easily be a tasty WS option.   \\nI would highly recommend eating at Cantina if you enjoy faux, low quality Mexican food and being harassed by birds while you try to eat your meal. There are way better options, in both the showcase and Future World, and I encourage you to try ANY of those over this place."},{"name":"Thai Wok Kitchen","address":"5000 E 4th Plain Blvd, Ste A101","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4.5","text":"Came here with a party of 6- everyone left satisfied and very full.

I, for instance, am vaguely agoraphobic and don't want to go anywhere *too cool* lest other patrons make fun of my shoes and pour gin on them. Or, more realistically, have a sanctimonious mixologist roll their eyes at me upon realizing I have no idea what I want or why my gin is a golden amber versus a silkily translucent I'm used to.\\n\\nBarlow, though, keeps me from drinking at home alone while watching David Attenborough-narrated documentaries about bears. Barlow's atmosphere is genuine, stylish, and utterly efficient. They offers quality libations but don't  hit you over the head with style or smugness--a trait all too common in PDX bars.\\n\\nI think the secret to this formula is twofold: \\n\\n1. Barlow's gorgeous signature menu. Try the Garden Variety, it's ingenious, delightful, and upon my first sip I feel truly happy. Usually it takes me at least one cocktail to feel happy! And if you feel the menu isn't up to snuff, I've seen the Barlow staff whip up enviable concoctions that delight even its most discerning patrons. Plus they use this cold science-y fog to chill some of their drinks and I am incredible entertained by this. \\n\\n2. The staff is here is lovely. They should actually be referred to as \\"The Talent.\\" The service: Marvelous. They are detailed oriented and friendly but still lightening quick.

Nathaniel, Mark, Molly, Matthew, Mariah, Lauren, and company all make my evenings a little sweeter. In addition to being individually delightful, they are knowledgable about booze. \\n\\nIn closing, if this review seems a little verbose it's because I have a lot of feelings but, trust me, they are genuine.

I was super excited. We got there in the late evening and waited an hour which was fine. They had a good system and we got in earlier than we thought. \\n\\nThe water tasted and smelled like old rice water? It was really gross. I couldn't drink it. We ordered the famous wings, of course, flank steak salad and the prawns with glass noodles. The wings were very flavorful, but extremely salty. The had a lot of good quality meat on them which was nice. They were yummy, but I think overrated. I certainly did not junk it was mind blowing, but I enjoyed them very much. \\n\\nThe other dishes were the main problem. For the prices I think we were totally ripped off and it was just ridiculous for the quality of food that we received. Maybe it was because it was later in the evening...who knows. The steak salad came with only five thin slices of meat covered in way too many slices of green onion etc. the waitress did not say it was spicy and it was over the top with green onion, Thai basil and mint flavor. It wasn't flavor but overkill of spices and no meat to enjoy it with! How can you charge so much for barely any food?! The prawn dish was even a bigger disappointment because we only got four small shrimps ( not PRAWNS in my opinion) and two lousy pieces of what they call pork belly. To me it seemed like cheap slices of pork belly from the Asian market that looked like they were boiled! The dish says they had long beans in it. Guess how many long beans we got?! ONE! This dish was even more pricey and it was terrible. The glass noodles were slightly over cooked and the whole dish had no flavor. The sauce they gave you to dip the \\"prawns\\" in was yummy so I poured that over the noodles. \\n\\nAll in all I was sadly disappointed in my first experience here and in Portland.

The wait was going to be an hour an a half (estimate for a party of 4).  We were informed that they have a \\"waiting area\\" at another spot near by.  I totally forgot the name of it, but it was a Pok Pok owned appetizers and full bar place.  This is where my friends ordered the wings.  We also had the papaya salad \\"fried\\" style which I thought was really a creative way of serving Thai papaya salad.  It was good.  We also had the bamboo salad which tasted like what I had when I was younger by my mom.  So far so good.  The drink I ordered was awesome too, and to add to that, the bartender waiting on us was super attentive.\\n\\nNow at the main restaurant, we ordered everything vegetarian so we could share.  My friends were trying to eat less meat anyway, so it worked out.  The food we ordered was okay.  The best thing we ate was the mushroom salad.  Everything else was okay and nothing was spectacular.  I was disappointed by the sticky rice which was just a microwaved prepared packed (which is standard for many restaurants serving sticky rice).  I was hoping based on the dishes they serve, the sticky rice would be freshly made.  Oh well.  At least now we know.

They cook to order, so it takes a bit longer but it tastes absolutely perfect.  The burgers are nice and juicy, with all the toppings you'd expect, and nothing more.   The milkshakes are made right there too, pretty much everything is.  Their preparation is as charmingly old-school as it gets.\\n\\n...As is the place itself.  Step in off Broadway and it's like you've just hopped out of the DeLorean after landing right in the middle of the 1950s.  It's that awesome.  I happen to love everything retro, so it scores major points in that aspect.\\n\\nThe prices are very reasonable.  I believe $10 gets you a burger and a huge plate of fries.  Can't go wrong with that.  Nothing on the menu is overly expensive.\\n\\nThe staff are always extremely friendly and helpful, and always make sure you're enjoying everything.  From what I've read they are the owners as well, so it's always nice when it's a family-run business.\\n\\nI happen to like crazy seasoned burgers with all sorts of weird toppings all over them so I often crave other things, but this place just makes a great basic burger, and sometimes that's all you want.  If I want to sit in a darkened room and have a glass of beer or four with my food I'll go elsewhere.  But if all I'm craving is a great burger for a nice price, in fun, relaxing environment, I'll go here.\\n\\nOne more thing, they close pretty early, I believe it's 8-ish.

Don't get me wrong. It was yummy. It just didn't blow my mind. What drew me to this place wasn't the line out front. (Nice try, Daily Catch! You didn't count on *every* restaurant on Hanover having a ridiculous line outside.) It was the unpretentious atmosphere of the restaurant. There is no separate kitchen. There are no hackneyed decorations. There are no long black aprons or waiters with ties. It was like seeing a seafood shack squished in between high end Italian restaurants. North Shore sea eats without the drive!\\n\\nMy mother was visiting with my brother and I wanted to take them out for some decent seafood without having to go to a chain like Legal's. Unfortunately, whenever any out-of-towners ask where the locals go for seafood, I tell them we go out-of-town. Boston might be on the Harbor, but the good stuff is outside the city. But I'd heard enough hype to try this place out.\\n\\nWe paid our dues in the line outside, like you would with any Hanover St. restaurant. We waited about an hour before getting in and shared a longish table with another couple. There are only a handful of tables in the joint. And you're not necessarily guaranteed a table of your own. So if you were looking to make out quietly in a corner, reconsider. The service was fantastic! Prompt, friendly, fun. The bread was average but gave you something to stem the hunger from maintaining a patient standing-and-waiting position outside while watching people eat through the windows. \\n\\nThe menu was extensive yet pricey. Oddly the entrees seemed to be the appetizers but served on pasta and double the price. I figured I didn't really need to pay $10 for pasta, so I just found a delicious app. Shrimp scampi. YUMMY. However, after my brother's pasta came, I was glad I didn't order it. I'm not sure if there was more pasta or more oil. It was like a pasta soup. My mother also got an entree (what it was is escaping me) that was on the rather small side.\\n\\nIn the end, it wasn't bad seafood.

Different flavors, textures, ingredients, and LOTS OF HEAT. If you have a baby palette be really careful and load up on the sticky rice. \\n\\nPok Pok has such great fresh flavors even I'm a little surprised they can pull it off in a bustling metropolis. Everything is very intentional and well thought out. Our server did a great job explaining how certain things were to be combined and the purpose of certain presentation. The whole meal could have easily been transported to a fine dining establishment without changing a thing on the menu. \\n\\nI will say as a matter of personal preference that I HATE sharing tables with strangers in the USA.

Glad he did!  We had the calamari as an appetizer. It was fresh, not over cooked and tasty. The only issue was that my husband wanted tartar sauce and they were out. I found that to be strange but we overlooked that. The sweet chili sauce was good with the dish. \\n\\nIn the South there are 2 things a restaurant should have ready for their customers to ask for SWEET TEA and tartar sauce.

Half of our party was there to put our names down, even though a table was ready pretty much right away.  They held that table for us until our whole party got there, which was really nice of them.  We got our own room, which is just outside the dining area around the back.  It was a very nice, intimate setting - although a bit drafty because it was basically a covered patio.  Our server was very nice and helpful.\\n\\nFood wise, we ordered: \\n-Regular and spicy fish sauce wings\\n-Rotisserie game hen\\n-Baby back ribs\\n-Water buffalo salad\\n-Pork belly ginger curry stew\\n-Khanom jiin naam ngiaw vermicelli salad\\n-Coconut & jackfruit ice cream sandwich\\n-Sweet sticky rice w/ durian-scented coconut & palm sugar custard\\n\\nI also had their Mango Alexander drink, which was amazing (more like dessert than an alcoholic drink).  I liked the Mango Alexander better than the Tamarind Whiskey Sour, but that's just personal preference.\\n\\nFavorites: their famous fish sauce wings, the pork belly ginger curry stew, the sticky rice with durian coconut, and their coconut rice.  Very, very delicious dishes, and the creativity / ingredient quality is there.\\n\\nSkip: the rotisserie game hen. It was a bit dry and it's not a very good dish for sharing.  Also the ice cream sandwich - tooo much bread.\\n\\nThe rest of the dishes were good, but I would probably try other things on their menu before reordering.  They have a pretty big menu selection, and many of their dishes sound great.  The style of food is not traditional Thai, but more Southeast Asian fusion with a gourmet twist.  I don't think it's really fair to compare Pok Pok to a hole-in-the-wall Thai or Viet restaurant; they just aren't comparable in terms of preparation and ingredient quality.  I think the price point at Pok Pok is well justified.\\n\\nOverall, I really enjoyed my meal at Pok Pok and would definitely come back."},{"name":"Din Ho Chinese BBQ","address":"8557 Research Blvd, Ste 116","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"Solidly good Chinese fare in Central/North Austin.

People either sure love them some ViVi or the word is getting out about it and they are interested in trying. I did enjoy the milk tea. I thought it was just enough sweetness and very flavorful. The cotton candy on top is just sweet like cotton candy.  There was a little smaller version of the milk tea with extra milk next to the big jar with the cotton candy, I guess to just fill up what you're drinking after eating the cotton candy. \\n\\nOverall, I did enjoy it.

We were very lucky that night, we parked right next to the restaruant, walked right in and got a seat. \\n\\nI did my usual stare-at-what-other-people-eating thing, and I liked what I see.  I ordered the Shrimp Cecelia - Large shrimp sauteed with mushrooms, spinach, prosuciutto, in an alfredo sauce served with fusilli.  I love the big big shrimp and alfredo sauce was great.  I'm happy with the portion (extra for lunch next day).  \\n\\nAlso, I purposely saved room for dessert - Tiramisu!! It was a good size that can be shared by two.  \\n\\nLove this even more that the price is reasonable.  Can't wait to come back here with my friends and family!"},{"name":"Island Creek Oyster Bar","address":"500 Commonwealth Ave","city":"Boston","stars":"4.5","text":"I decided to visit this place based on friends recommendations. I loved the selection of oysters, the best selection I've seen in Boston. The decor with oyster shells was impressive. Entrees selection was good but a little pricey. Great service and it was easy to reserve a table."},{"name":"Avana Sushi 3 & Seafood Restaurant","address":"589 Main St","city":"Reading","stars":"4.5","text":"Ordered delivery. Sushi was fresh and service was quick. All the sauces were included and folks were friendly on the phone. The best vegetarian rolls I've ever had. Definitely will order in with them again."},{"name":"Moonshine Patio Bar & Grill","address":"303 Red River St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"This review is for 4/22/07\\n\\nHoly moly, this place ROCKED! I had the Broiled rainbow trout with corn bread stuffing & chile sage butter. It was served with roasted rosemary sweet potatoes, sliced yellow & green zucchini with parmesan, and honey roasted carrots. Hubby enjoyed his cornflake fried chicken salad with mixed greens, bacon, & honey dijon. We had never ordered red velvet cake before so we ended the meal with that. Wow. If you visit Austin, this is a must!"},{"name":"Red Robin Gourmet Burgers and Brews","address":"250 Granite St, Unit 1094E","city":"Braintree","stars":"2.5","text":"I love Red Robin and have eaten at many locations but this one has consistently given poor quality food, frequently over cooking the burgers even when specifically asking for them to be careful with that. I would not recommend going to this restaurant. I have tried to give this location multiple opportunities hoping they had a slow learning curve after opening. However, I have yet to see any improvement and will not be back. \\n\\nRed Robin is a great restaurant...just not this location. Instead, drive 30 minutes longer to go to the Plymouth location-that one is run right!"},{"name":"Sam LaGrassa's","address":"44 Province St","city":"Boston","stars":"4.5","text":"OMG best roast beef sandwich EVER!!
