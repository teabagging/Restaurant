I loved the dark hardwood floor and high ceilings.  The waitstaff were great.  They were friendly, explained the menu, and checked back with me frequently.\\n\\nAs I sat down, I was provided with both a lunch and dinner menu.  Many of the items are the same on both menus, but as the waitstaff indicated, the dinner menu options are larger and more expensive.   From the lunch menu, I ordered the mixed vegetables (plus beef) and as an appetizer, the Sleeping Prawns.  \\n\\nAs I waited for my order, I pondered the rain outside and the pedestrians passing by with umbrellas.  Despite having lived in Seattle and Portland the bulk of my adult life, it has never occurred to me to own an umbrella.  \\n\\nThe Sleeping Prawns was the first item to arrive at my table.  This was my favorite dish - prawns, with slivers of carrot, wrapped in rice paper, deep fried and served with a delicious sweet/crumbled peanut dipping sauce.\\n\\nNext came the wontons.  I didn't per se order them, but they automatically came with my lunch.  Not so good.  The puffed up wonton shells were extremely tough.  And what was on the inside?  Mostly just air.  Seriously!  They were hollow, with so little filling I couldn't even taste the filling.\\n\\nMy Wok-prepared vegetables and beef then arrived.  I liked the square-ish china plate/bowl that the beef, rice and vegetables came on/in.   There was a brown broth at the bottom of the dish/bowl.   The beef was very sparse, but was okay in flavor and tenderness.  \\n\\nAs I've mentioned in other reviews, how well-done vegetables should be is entirely a personal preference.  Having said that, I was disappointed with the way undercooked vegetables in this dish.   Crunchy carrot, crunchy cabbage, crunchy broccoli and crunchy cauliflower.  Just call me Captain Crunch!

And everyone would probably be like, \\"Ugh, I can't believe you invited Chart House, so boring!\\" and then they would be nice to you in front of your face because they were raised right to talk about people behind their backs.  But I digress...\\n\\nI went for restaurant week dinner.  Luckily I had awesomely funny company or otherwise I would've been less impressed with this place.  I don't understand what they do different than their competitors, but whatever.  The location is the best thing it has going for it.  But just remember Chart House, looks fade...   Anyway, I don't really remember much about what I ate because it was semi-lackluster.  And it's not even my memory.  It's totally not me, it's you, Chart House.

Too many new cafes end feeling forced and pretentious, but somehow Crema pulls it off. Clean and kind of upscale feeling, but with very reasonable prices and warm and friendly atmosphere. The coffee is great (not bitter or burnt ala starbucks), the pastries I've had so far (birthday cake cupcake and a cookie) were excellent (not dry). Today I had the grilled cheese. I think the cheeses were gruyere and muenster, but I'm not exactly sure. It was anything but bland. Anyway, i love this place.

One breakfast out is enough to make me cranky but for a change it actually cheered me up.

All the eggs are free-range and the menu options are enormous, in addition to which there is a full page of specials. They have a number of bennies, huevos rancheros and a choice between waffles and (amazing!) stuffed french toast for a sweet breakfast. \\n\\nI went with the recommendation of the server and had the french toast, while my friend had the huevos rancheros.  \\n\\nBoth were super delicious - my friends huevos were two eggs served in a small, possibly house made corn tortilla, lots of cheese, guacamole, and black beans, as well as a large salad.  My french toast was a smaller portion but served with banana infused whipped cream and (real) maple syrup for no extra charge. Factoring in for the $1.50 most restaurants charge for maple syrup, and my $12 french toast was quite the deal, though I could definitely have eaten more of it. \\n\\nAll in all, even though I was reluctant to go here, Locus has pretty much nudged itself to the top of the pile when I think of breakfast for Vancouver.

My boyfriend and I WISHED we had splurged a little more to stay here instead of the Pop Century resort. Okay, splurged a LOT more. The lobby was absolutely gorgeous! \\n\\nThe restaurant is gorgeous as well. I don't think pictures do Disney justice..you really just have to see in person, and to also feel the ambiance. I'll try my best to describe. The main dining area is dimly lit, with a wall that changes color every half hour, to mimic the African sunset. There are \\"cranes\\" hanging from the ceiling, which supposedly bring prosperity I think? The hostess seating us explained all these little things about the restaurant as we walked to our table. Jiko also has the largest South African wine collection in the entire United States. Something like over 200 different wines.\\n\\nNow I can't comment on how \\"authentic\\" the food was since I have never been to Africa before. BUT I can say that it was delicious! Since we were on the Disney dining plan, we only ordered 2 entrees, 2 desserts, and 2 non-alcoholic drinks. My boyfriend got a glass of the Clover wine per the waiter's suggestion and said it was really, really good.\\n\\nRundown of the food:\\n\\n-bread with butter: it's this delicious fluffy slightly sweet bread served with a curry flavored butter. I don't remember what it is exactly, but it was yummy.\\n-duck: do yourself a favor and definitely order this dish here. it was AMAZING, my boyfriend, who has a lot of duck and loves it, says it's one of the very best he's ever eaten. Cooked and flavored perfectly, and served with these delicious little caramelized figs on the side. YUM!\\n-filet mignon: cooked a true medium as requested, and tender and juicy. Not the best I've ever had, but pretty darn good for Disney!\\n-creme brulee: very yummy, dark chocolate is swirled into it, which makes it a little more unique\\n-I had a cake with vanilla ice cream...it was almost like bread pudding, I forget, but it was yummy.\\n\\nWe topped dessert off by sharing a chai tea (chosen from a pretty extensive tea selection) and it was yummy! Served with honey.\\n\\nAlso, since it was a birthday celebration, the very friendly and knowledgeable waiter brought over the phone, and Goofy gave me a recorded birthday message.

The prices are a little higher than I feel the quality of the food is as well. As a starter we ordered the ebi gyoza,which was decent, but i felt it could have been fried just a little longer, as the outer casing felt a little soft and chewy, instead of it being more on the crispy side. We ordered Yaki Soba, Which I found to be not that good. It tasted more like chow mein cooked noodles. Yaki soba has a more distinct taste to it that makes it stand out more from your basic noodle dish, and this did not cut it. We also ordered the Raisukaree with chicken, as the waitress taking our order said this was one of their more popular dishes. I also have to say that this one didn't taste as good as I thought it should. And the amount of chicken in the dish was minimal to say the least.

The atmosphere there was much less cozy than the rest of the restaurant, with bad clangy acoustics, dead crickets on the floor, and a dank feeling.

We should have asked for another table but we were rain-soaked anyway from the walk from the car and just wanted to order.  We started with the fish cake appetizer and it was kind of rubbery and spongy and not very good.  For our main courses, my husband had Pad Thai with chicken, mother-in-law had the same but with shrimp, and I had Pad Puk with shrimp.  All three dishes were extremely mediocre, bordering on gross.  My daughter had the coconut ice cream, which was good.  Fast forward a few hours, my husband was throwing up all night and the next day.

We can only speculate. Good bands at this dance venue.  Biggest dance floor of any casino dance venues.  It was our view that one long-time server, a guy named Kash, has a big ego and a chip on his shoulder and gave some unrequested attempts at humour to one or more of the ladies in our group; which came off as an insult to her appearance.

Jiko is the best, bar none. On our most recent trip, we went to Jiko not really knowing what we were going to have. My wife made the reservation based solely on rave reviews she had read on the internet. Well, they are all true. First of all, the restaurant is beautifully decorated and the view out on the resort's gardens is gorgeous.\\n\\nNow the important part, the food. We started with the cheese plate and as soon as we each took a bite, we knew this was going to be an amazing meal. I am your basic Midwesterner and I have lived in Milwaukee so I know my cheese. I can honestly say though that this was the best cheese plate I have ever had. Absolutely delicious. For our entrees, I had the lamb loin and my wife had the shrimp curry. Of course, we both tried a little bit of each dish, and both were cooked expertly and were very impressive. The creme brulee was also very good, but the entrees were so good that we were still thinking about them during dessert. The one thing that I regret is that we did not partake from their extensive wine list. (We arrived early and I had already had some African beer from the bar which was good as well.)\\n\\nI know you might think that going to Jiko would be a hike especially if you are staying at another Disney resort, but you really should go.

Chicken a tad dry, but that's hard to control when you have to precook chicken for a day's worth and have to make sure it's thoroughly cooked.  I loved the creaminess that the avocado lent, and I'm thinking the words \\"avocado\\" and \\"pesto\\" oughta be combined.  Avopesto?  Pestocado?

Hubby ordered the pate.....yummmm....like butta......and I ordered the salad.  The salad was fine, with a poached egg, but it was kinda boring.  He then chose the trout......amaaaaaaaazing!  and I ordered the lamb......deeelish!!  For one neither was overcooked.  Nothing ruins a dish like overcooked fish/meat.  You should be allowed to call meat protective services for those establishments, honestly.  \\n\\nWe got to try our friend's scallop and I think they were the best I've ever had.  I mean large, firm, cooked to perfection fresh scallop....again like butta.  It was SO GOOD.  \\n\\nHubby chose creme caramel and I chose chocolate mousse.  The creme caramel was better, in my opinion, and the mousse was good - airy and chocolatey, but I wanted it a little bit more creamy I guess.  Just personal taste.  THeir desserts were nothing to write home about though.\\n\\nI loved it, but I think between the wait time and no reservations and no waiting area it may take awhile for me to come back.

As I wonder the streets of Portland, there's a Mexican place in every corner (shocker). But on a quest to find great street tacos, I stumbled across this place on my handy dandy PDX Cart app. It's not in a pod with other carts, it stands alone on Division located next to a thrift store. Hey for $1.50/taco, I ordered 4 different types just to see what this place was made of. Now I don't order the typical chicken or carne asada. I went straight for the buche (pork belly), cabeza (cheek), lengua (tongue) and pastor. \\n\\nWhen we arrived, there was no one and within 5 minutes a line had formed on a chilly day. That's a good sign as the two ladies are cooking up a storm in their truck. Finally it was time to judge these delicate tacos. First off, they packed those suckers with quite a bit of meat so that's good. Next, if you order lengua and cheek, it has to be super tender. If it's chewy then it wasn't cooked long enough. They passed this test and the lengua & cheek fell apart in my mouth like pot roast. The buche or pork belly was actually a disappointment. No pork belly should ever be dry! Luckily their salsas saved me from choking on this dry piece of meat. The pastor was decent. \\n\\nWell the good news is that with all the meat they put on a taco, you can you the bottom tortilla to make another one so I had a total of 8 oh my! Another point for them for having covered seating. And we'll add another point for their salsas & having grilled whole jalapenos...mmmm!

This was a very fresh tasting fish. The mint taste was quite strong depending on how you swirled it so if you're picky about your flavour profiles you might prefer the albacore tuna ceviche instead. The fish was quite smooth (think almost like sashimi) and the cucumber only added to the freshness.\\n\\nThe Morita Chili BBQ Pulled Pork Taco came with a mango papaya salsa y pinto on top. I liked the subtle grill lines on the taco which accentuated the presentation. The manga papaya salsa on top had a fruity tomato-y taste to it and was very enjoyable. This was a simple appetizer but felt very appropriate given its place in the 5 courses.\\n\\nThe Pan Roasted Bison Flank Steak came with Tijuana-style baby caesar and chorizo buttermilk kennebec mash. The mash here was wonderful. It was very buttery and the flank steak had a subtle crunch in every bite. It did come medium/medium-rare though so if that's an issue for you you'll want to specify how you want this flank steak cooked.\\n\\nFourth up was the Chia Seed Crusted Peruvian Scallop which came with pale ale chorizo pana frito coconut creamed corn y grilled chayote. The grilled chayote (cucumber-esque) was interesting and reminded me of a zucchini despite being a fruit. There was only one scallop included in this dish but it was indeed very juicy and the chia seeds on top gave it a micro crunch, sort of like crunching on ground pepper that doesn't have any pepper taste. Nonetheless, it was a healthy twist.\\n\\nFinally we got to the Ancho Chili Chocolate Brownie dessert which came with kaffir lime horchata, which chocolate ganache, and pecan brittle. This was a very unique dessert. Firstly the white chocolate bits had a licorice finish to it which changed the dynamic of the brownie depending on how you approached it. there were also mint and berries on top and so I felt a lot of taste buds igniting while I ate this. I don't have any regrets but I don't think I'd order this one again and sort of wish there were more than one option for dessert for Dine Out because I don't think everyone will enjoy this.\\nOverall, the food was very interesting.

We entered the restaurant and there was no seating hostess. It was by no means busy, maybe 4 other families having lunch. We waited and were seated by one of the owners (my guess since he wasn't in uniform, just had shorts, sandals, and a tshirt on). My family and I were seated by one of the cash registers and we immediately observed every server struggling with inputting orders. One server spent more time at the machine than covering her one table. My husband and I spent the next hour observing the staff running around looking confused and nervous as the 2 owners and what appeared to be a manager continuously stepped in to do the servers' tasks. One of the owners was running around in his apron, sweating and red faced while barking orders at the staff. I overheard him bad mouthing the servers to a couple who was eating in the bar area, commenting on their incompetence. My husband saw him grab a server, pull him around and snap at him to get in the kitchen cause his table's food was ready. He also continuously grabbed food from servers to serve them himself as well as took drink orders, answered the phone and sat guests, all while still wearing his dirty kitchen apron.  The atmosphere he and the other leadership (if you could call it that) created in the restaurant was chaotic and anxious. Our server was so nervous his hands were shaking when he brought us our drinks and then our food. We could see the other servers on edge every time one of the owners came into the dining area which was so frequently that they could have sent the servers home and served the guests on their own since they were doing it anyways. \\n\\nOn to the food....I wish I could say the food made up for what was lacking in atmosphere but unfortunately that wasn't the case. I ordered the Mahi wrap; it was tasteless, and the wrap was near burnt. My husband ordered the pork nachos and ate about 1/4 of them. I tasted them because by that point I knew I would write a review based on our experience. The nachos were soggy and the beans were dry and tasteless. We also received free chips and salsa; the chips were stale. The kids had pizza and macaroni, no issues there. They were plated on a frisbee the kids could keep, cute concept.\\n\\nWe knew going in that Mikki V's was new.

Jeni's has sort of ruined all other ice cream but Jeni's for me, so there's that. \\n\\nI was seriously craving some ice cream over the weekend, and after my friends and I peeled away from Joystick, we went for ice cream! Obviously, I'm pretty excited about it because I just repeated the word ice cream like five times in as many sentences. I'll admit, I do this very rarely. The markup for most ice cream places simply isn't worth the $5-$10 for a cup/scoop/etc. I mean, how a place like Coldstone can sell ice cream for like $6 is astonishing to me, especially when the ice cream isn't even gourmet or very good. I digress....\\n\\nThe Edgewood location doesn't seem to really have... Any exciting flavors. Isn't that the thing that supposedly makes Moreilli's a different kind of ice cream place? Their unusual, exotic flavor pairs that you just HAVE to try? Well, this place had something like 15 flavors that were all very (pardon the pun) vanilla. There were the requisite flavors: vanilla, chocolate, strawberry, butter pecan, chocolate chip, black cherry, and a couple of SLIGHTLY \\"different\\", but definitely not exotic flavors like salted caramel, spicy dark chocolate, almond butter, red hot, and coffee heath butterscotch. The final two flavors offered were cinnamon gingersnap (the website said this was offered, but I honestly didn't see it on the menu) and ginger lavender.\\n\\nI chose the salted caramel, because this is honestly becoming one of my favorite types of ice cream flavors, thanks to Jeni's. I will say that I tried the ginger lavender and didn't really find it agreeable. None of the other flavors really lept out to me, to I chose the salted caramel in the end. It's definitely different than Jeni's. It's got a much thicker, much saltier consistency. It was honestly pretty good, but I just wasn't super impressed. I think they may have put too much salt in it, which made the consistency stiff and the ice cream so salty I wished I had some milk to go along with it. Dang you, Jeni, for ruining all other ice cream for me!!\\n\\nBesides that, the store itself had very slow service. I don't think this was due to the workers, because they were trying to accommodate people as fast as they could. It honestly just looked like they were understaffed. Two people working at an ice cream place (and a third on the register) seems a little ridiculous in the middle of the summer. When we first came in, there were a couple of people in front of us, but they stacked all the way to the door by the time we finished ordering. We had a table at the very end of the restaurant, and I had to say excuse me to people who were waiting in line at the door. There were four of us, then maybe around 7-10 other people behind us by the time we finished.\\n\\nPROS:\\nDecent ice cream. A little more expensive than it was worth, I think.\\nAwesome location, within walking distance of a bunch of other stores.\\nParking wasn't an issue, since there were a ton of spots.\\nSmells like ice cream. \\nThey offer nice sample spoons. I think they were metal. It's a great idea, and I'm sure cuts down on wasted plastic.\\n\\nCONS:\\nUnderstaffed. They were trying to keep up with the demand, but there were two people serving almost a dozen people. \\nThe place was kind of... dirty. Paint peeling off the walls, the bathroom had hair in the sink. Ick.\\nWhere were some of the awesome exotic flavors people have been telling me about? Definitely not here.\\n\\nTHE VERDICT:\\nI would have loved to try some of the more exotic flavors that Moreilli's is so well known for, but these were just pretty much the kind of ice cream you could find in grocery stores. Perhaps it is due to this particular location, and what these locals like, and maybe they simply enjoy the tried-and-true? I also think they should consider hiring a few more people during summer. The lines could get really long, and managed to stack up to the door while we were there. I think you could be here for up to 15 or 20 minutes before ordering, on an especially busy day. You also need to factor in the samples some people do, which increases the wait time. And then, there are some people who feel so rushed they don't even sample all the kinds they would like to. Other than that, the ice cream was pretty good, but I don't think good enough to justify the price I paid for it. I'll probably stick to Jeni's in the future.

I am soooo glad I did!\\nWhat a fantastic experience! Dined at Teatro on a Saturday night at 9pm. It was pretty crowded but not obnoxious and we were seated promptly. The ambiance is on the darker side, with tones of blues emanating from the lighting. However, even though it was darkish, I was able to clearly see my date across the table and the food that I was eating, which is definitely a plus! Some reviewers have complained about the noise level. I don't think it was anything unusual for such a place. I mean, it is part of the atmosphere and experience, so it is to be expected. I had to be a bit louder for sure, but I certainly didn't need a megaphone!\\nOur server was Omar. He came over promptly to take our drink order and when we told him we needed a couple more minutes to decide what to eat, he came back in a few minutes, and did not disappear forever, which seems to happen a lot at restaurants when you ask for more time with the menu.\\nThe menu consists of smaller dishes for around $6 that are just enough for 2 people to share and sample. I love this because you can order and try a bunch of stuff without committing to one big dish. Such a great idea. And even some of the pasta dishes are available as an appetizer, so you can opt for a smaller portion of those as well.\\nWe ordered the crispy calamari, which came with a creamy white sauce and the usual cocktail sauce, but no lemon. I had to request lemon, which I thought was odd because usually with calamari, there is at least one lemon wedge included on the side. No biggie, though. The grilled octopus was full of flavor, grilled with onions and potatoes. The onions were kind of pickled, so it was a very interesting and savory combo of flavors. The sweet potato tortellini was very light, in kind of a broth, but also super tasty.

They brought the beef rolls first and we knew we were on to something great. I could have eaten just those and been happy-so good - a light, flaky crust filled with perfectly seasoned beef. Next came the noodles. My daughter just moved back from Hong Kong and I thought we had found the best noodles in the world from a particular street vendor there; these noodles were a definite rival. Delicate perfect noodles in a just-right chili sauce. The dumplings were last and just as tasty as everything else.

I was not offered chips (minus 1 point), but my food was seriously delivered in under a minute (I'm not sure if this is actually a good thing, but there's always meat lying around, and the rest of a taco is toppings...) complete with THREE homemade sauces.  The red and green were good, flavorful and not too hot.  Ignoring the guy's warning, I threw a dollop of the habanero garlic salsa on my tacos.  It had 2 phases: flavorful and JESUS CHRIST!  \\nI should mention here that I ordered al pastor tacos, which in the classic sense should be marinated then shaved from a spit Middle Eastern style, but there was no spit here.  The meat was pretty unremarkable (minus 1 star), well-marinated, but I like to see a vestige of flavoring in the pork, like a piece of onion or pineapple.  This tasted like carnitas.\\nOverall a nice little Mexican joint serving reasonably-priced, tasty treats.

We ordered the egg flower soup and it was very much like an omlet in soup broth (not what we were expecting at all), they noticed we didn't each much of it, asked if we liked it and when we said no, took it off the bill. I think its important to note that this place doesn't have the average americanized offerings, so if you like your sweet and sour pork to taste like a pork flavored lolly pop you probably should go elsewhere. The egg rolls could be better, the water needs to be pressed out of the filling prior to stuffing and frying to avoid the overly soft filling as it stands now. I would recommend the potstickers and the sauce they come with is not at hot as you would think and very savory. The pepper beef (has mushrooms and onions in it too), the pork with green beans, the chicken chow mein, are all very tasty and favorites. They also have a super spicy Szechuan menu in the back with more adventureous and hot fare. Worth a try if you like it hot! I'm very glad this place has such good service and is so nearby.

From start to finish, this was the best sit-down dining experience I've ever had in a theme park. Here's why:\\n\\n1) The experience: We expected a great experience, and Be Our Guest did not let us down. From the tour of the restaurant that began our night, to the chef coming out to take our order, to the ambiance, to the themed rooms, to the post-dinner meet and greet with Beast, this restaurant did not let us down. \\n2) The service: Prompt, attentive, quick, and not over the top. \\n3) The food: Surprise #1 was how good the food was. Real butter (no whipped \\"spread\\" full of hydrogenated oils!!!), fresh baked bread, perfectly cooked meats, and well-prepared sides all totally wowed us. I was totally not expecting this sort of quality food from a theme park. The \\"Grey Stuff\\" was a great dessert.  \\n4) The prices: Surprise #2 was the prices. While the main courses here were (of course) more expensive than those at quick-service restaurants around the park, they were not marked up as much above what I would consider normal restaurant prices as the food at the quick-service places were. In addition, the deserts and alcoholic drinks generally cost less than comparable items at nearby quick-service restaurants. Let me say that again: some things were actually LESS EXPENSIVE here than at quick-service stands a few steps away. Yes, the whole dinner cost more than we would have spent for a burger at a nearby food court, but the value was much, much better. Especially when youconsider the experience and quality ingredients. \\n\\nBottom line: if you can get a reservation here for dinner, it's well worth it."},{"name":"Mighty Fine Burgers Fries & Shakes","address":"10515 N Mo-Pac Expy, Ste 105","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"Checked out Mighty Fine Burgers for lunch today and came away unimpressed.\\n\\nIt definitely is an attempt to clone In N' Out in a Texas-sized way (bigger burger, bigger fries, bigger prices).

We were on our way to P. Terry's for dinner when we drove past Consuelo's. Husband pointed jokingly and said \\"Let's eat there!\\". I took a glance and was unsure if it really was somewhere to eat. After I said \\"YES!\\", he went around the block and parked. Now, parking is scarce here, as is the seating.\\n\\nWe walked in and were amazed that we were basically eating in the living room of a house. This didn't deter us, because we're believers in 'the smaller the kicthen, the better the food'. Boy were we right.\\n\\nThere's about 5, 6 tables. Only one seats up to six people, but they have no issue with putting tables together to accommodate more. Just a fair warning though :)\\n\\nWe sat down and the waitress (I like to call her Consuelo's assistant) could tell this was our first time. She explained the specials and what was really good (although I'm sure EVERYTHING is good!). She brought us chips and we ordered the Queso Especial. DEEELISH!\\n\\nHusband and Kiddo went with the usual water, I ordered the lemonade. DUDES! THIS IS REAL LEMONADE! At least, the way my Mom and \\nAbuelita (and pretty much any Mexican) make it. This was HEAVEN!\\n\\nWe placed our order, I went with the chicken enchiladas with tomatillo on top. I LOVE how you can order sides instead of having to forcifully get rice and beans. I got the refried beans (I am convinced only my Mom has mastered the art of making amazing refried beans) and the mango and jicama salad. MANGO AND JICAMA SALAD, Y'ALL!! There's about six different sides you can order besides the usual rice and beans. AMEN TO THAT! \\nI also ordered the kid's flauta for my son. He's as picky as they get, so this was truly a test.\\n\\nOur food didn't take very long, which in other restaurants that seats about 50-100+ would be a bit concerning. Seeing as how we were only one of 3 tables, it was only logical. Everything looked beautiful. \\n\\nWe carefully dug into our food, as if eating anything impeccably would ruin the deal. After our first few bites, it was on like Donkey Kong. My chicken enchiladas were out of this world. They reminded me of the ones my Abuelita would make. With each bite, I was taken back to my summers in Mexico and the grandiose dinners my aunt and Abby would make each night. Each bite bursted with the same love, care and taste as the food from the country I haven't visited in 3 years. \\n\\nI ALMOST CRIED. CRIED BECAUSE NEVER AGAIN DID I THINK I WOULD EVER EAT FOOD AS GOOD AS MEXICO'S (as GOOD as my Grandmother's!!) HERE IN THE UNITED STATES. It took everything in me to not run to the kitchen and hug Consuelo. This woman makes the SAME food as my familia en Mexico makes.\\n\\nGreasy? NO!

I had never been to Chez Nous and my girlfriend always wanted to go, so while we were in the area, we decided to go on a whim. The place was small and almost filled to capacity, but didn't seem overly busy as far as restaurants go. We didn't wait too long for a table, and one of the bus boys gave us our water as soon as we sat down!\\n\\nHowever, that's as far as the \\"service\\" we got at Chez Nous went. It took an extremely long time for any server to check-in on us (despite our table being right next to the exit area to the kitchen); we actually had to flag down a passing by server to go get us a server to take our order. The server we got (whom I'm guessing was the floor boss for the night by the way she dressed differently than everyone else) was very pretentious to us. My girlfriend simply wanted to know what their pate maison consisted of, protein wise, and she gave us an attitude as if we didn't know what pate was supposed to look like. When we finally got our pate, it literally looked like shredded pork you can get from any barbecue food truck--very disappointed in the pate.\\n\\nThe rest of our meal was what you would expect from a \\"three-dollar sign\\" restaurant. I had the beef flank off the prix fixe menu and it was ok. We didn't take any pictures of our food, but there's plenty to look at off the Yelp Chez Nous website anyway.\\n\\nWe had finished our main course and passing by servers quickly cleared our tables. And then we waited. Again. The servers again took a long time to come by and take our dessert orders. We had already mentioned to our server (still the floor boss looking individual) that we wanted the prix fixe option, but she still tried to be a used-car salesperson and sell us desserts that were more expensive. We put in our dessert orders and they were adequate--I had the mousse au chocolat, and it tasted like chocolate fluff or chocolate space ice cream.\\n\\nThe floor boss person server saw we were complete with our meal and left the bill on our table. That was it. No \\"is there anything else I can get you?\\" or \\"how was the meal?\\" Nothing! I would expect a three-dollar sign restaurant to provide a little more service than my local Whataburger, but it looks like these servers could learn a thing or two from THEM!\\n\\nOh, but if you know the workers, like this family group of 6 I saw at least two workers, including the floor boss worker, hugging as they came in, you'll be treated like family.

There was ample cilantro but little carrots or other vegetables to be found (if any). The jalope√±os were thin, long slices (for minimizing spiciness I suppose), lacked flavor, and there weren't many. The tofu comes as long, fried patties. Perhaps this is standard for many tofu bahn mis, but I would have liked something more like a crumble or thin slices, like I imagine the meat is in their other versions.

There weren't many reviews, but all the reviews were glowing and I had a hunch this could be that hidden gem I was looking for.\\n\\nI lied to my parents and told them that it's only eh, 10 minutes outside of the city center. (Not too far, right?) So we started driving in the direction of this restaurant. It started getting very residential... not in a slummy way, but not exactly the surroundings you'd expect to find a restaurant. This was fine by me, but I could tell my parents were losing their faith in my judgement and I felt a little bad about that... Eventually, we arrived at a little local strip mall at the center of this residential community.\\n\\nThe service was exceptional. The waitress kindly explained the menu, how it works, and what sort of flavors we should expect. We ordered the beef peanut butter soup with fufu, which had exactly the type of new zip of flavors I've been yearning for. It's got a tangy, rich, and smoky texture. It's likely to be a new experience for you, as it was for me.\\n\\nWest African food is fun, too. You mold little scoops with the fufu and scoop the soup into it. It reminded me of making and eating peanut butter play dough when I was a little toddler. It was also really neat to observe the locals handling the fufu with finesse and scarfing the food down effortlessly. \\n\\nI also highly recommend getting a side of the baku, which is sort of like fermented fufu, so it'll have that sour flavor you might be familiar with and love if you enjoy Ethiopian injera.

The server seemed unwilling to explain the menu, gave us a mediocre welcome, did not mention it was my wife's birthday (even though I went out of my way to write it in open table and call), took our order and literally disappeared. She forced me to have that awkward conversation with a server where you say \\"where were you\\" we've been looking around and could not find you. Are you overwhelmed?? I made it a little joke because I'm not a mean person. I let it brush off and didn't make a big deal. But....Then she went ahead took our order again and did not apologize, brought us our food items and asked if we wanted dessert. I said no, and she immediately asked if we wanted the check. She tried taking some of our food items when we were not done with these and our drink orders kept getting mixed up with the other couple on the opposite side. As someone that works in the service industry I value how important service recovery can be. Because things don't always go right and that's ok. The other server re-explained the menu, got a drink order for us and comped it. Then on our way out the owner surprised us by asking about our experience. We explained much of what happened and he was very apologetic about the entire poor experience. Assured us that this was not typical and asked us to please come back as he was addressing this isolated situation."},{"name":"World Of Beer","address":"3121 S Lamar Blvd","city":"Austin","stars":"3","text":"Best service I've had in Austin .

The wrapper was a little soggy and they weren't rolled well. The dipping sauce was awesome! My yasai yaki soba (no egg) was good, and I have it on good authority that the chicken teriyaki was decent. It was weird that the side salad came with no dressing. The yaki soba portion was big enough for leftovers, but the teriyaki was just right for one sitting. \\n\\nAs different people came to our table at different times, we got confused about who was our server. When my entree came out with meat in it, it was hard to get the attention of someone, anyone to correct it. The same happened when the check came and they had charged us for the correct and incorrect dishes. They were courteous about it, but the service was definitely lacking.\\n\\nWill I be back? Maybe...

I had originally planned on getting delivery, but while on CampusFood I realised that it was only two blocks away, though I had never noticed it. I looked it up on Google maps and, sure enough, it was right next to El Pelon. I'm guessing my singular interest in the Bald Man typically blinds me enough that I never noticed the bright blue sign and cutely-decorated Umi, which is literally right next door to El Pelon.\\n\\nI ordered a White Tiger (tuna, roe [tobiko, I think], cucumber, tampura bread crumbs,  rolled in white seaweed with what the menu mysteriously refers to only as \\"sauce\\") and avocado maki. The White Tiger had really nice texture. The roe, cucumber, and bread crumbs all added a little crunch, and the sauce, which was white a creamy like mayo with the tingle of wasabi, was interesting. The tuna was just okay, but it might have been a bit less fresh-tasting at ten than it would have been at noon. It's hard to mess up avocado maki but it wasn't anything special.\\n\\nThe decor was nice. Lots of wood with soft lighting. In order to add a little extra seating, they had put low tables and cushions in the twin bay windows. Aside from these tables, which could probably sit about six people, there were mostly two-person tables. There is a large TV over the sushi bar, which was on mute with the captions on and tuned to the Olympics. The entryway had patterned curtains hanging from it, which was cute, but made me oddly anxious: I like to see what I'm walking into. \\n\\nIt was a nice night so I opted to eat outside where I wouldn't feel guilty reading. Though my order was perfectly fine, the proximity to El Pelon had me wishing that I had just gone there instead-- though whether that is a mark against Umi or testament to my obsessive love for a good fish taco is hard to call. In all, it's nice to know that there's a decent sushi place down the street from me, but I agree with what another reviewer said: if you have the time to go elsewhere, you'll likely be more satisfied doing so."},{"name":"Taco Loco Mexican Grill","address":"44 Broadway","city":"Somerville","stars":"4","text":"I have been here for tacos on three or four ocassions and have never been dissapointed.

Then watch as the fountain lights up in glorious color.\\n\\nThere's a bit of a competition in background music.  Spice is playing their own outdoor soundtrack, but you can still hear the nice sound system surrounding Lake Eola playing it's classics.  Perhaps Spice should defer to that sound and turn off its outside speakers once the park starts playing?\\n\\nThe food is pretty good, actually.  Probably better than folks here have rated it.  I think it gets the rap sometimes for two reasons:  it's not particularly cheap for Millennials in this neighborhood, and also many people are simply ordering the wrong thing -- like the sushi, which is a bit over-gooed with sauces unless you request otherwise.\\n\\nBut let's concentrate on what's good, and that's the trendier items.  The baked brie is phenomenal.  I tend to compare all baked brie with the one at Eola Wine Company or a 310 location, and this one at Spice really measures up.  It's super mild and creamy with just the right fruit sides.\\n\\nIt's called Steakhouse but you need not ever try the steaks and still enjoy this place.  I've had one here, my go-to favorite, a thick rib-eye done blood rare with a Pittsburgh char.  That's also known as a \\"Black and Bleu,\\" and that's the ideal preparation to enjoy your steak if it's fully Prime grade, or at least a good enough Choice grade that you don't notice the difference.\\n\\nThe red and cool center should cut easily, not quite fork-soft.  And Spice again does not disappoint, much. The seasonings here are somehow off, and that's sort of a problem for nomenclature reasons, again, since it does have \\"Spice\\" in the name.   Seasoning a steak is not rocket-surgery by any means, so it's hard to see how this basic gets lost.\\n\\nThere's a reason I don't eat steak very much:  because, to do it right, there is just not all that much variation you can use in seasoning or preparation to make it well.  Made right, with Prime cuts, it's almost the same anywhere.  Heck, even Ruth's Chris (not my fave, but dependable) only uses salt and pepper on theirs.  So here we have a food that is rarely unusual, and relies on unique grilling methods, presentation, and variation in sides to be good.\\n\\nSo I don't come here for the steak, which I think does disappoint many folks.  Were I the restaurant, I would simply go with the name \\"Spice\\" or \\"Spice Eola\\" (perhaps \\"Spicy-Ola\\" as a play on phonics?)  And although the sushi bar is likely a form of revenue, it's not something I'd try again.  Sure, the sashimi is fresh and nice, but then, we're back to something that can't really be varied creatively, like Steak.\\n\\nGo here for the view.  Enjoy the fountain and the ample and nice wine selection.  Linger, then walk around the lake before the park closes.\\n\\nIt's at least worth a visit.

I have been noticing a marked change in the overall vibe, vis a vis my original review's suggestion that the staff need not yell back and forth amongst themselves like they're out partying while they're making my sandwich. It's all open so of course the voices carry, but now it's more normal, fun but conversational. Nobody's hooting or cackling. Today I finally felt social enough to talk to a young manager-looking man wearing the manager-looking shirt. Turns out he's the new manager. See, nothin' gets by me! I think he said Jordan is his name, and he started around 8 months ago. A couple minutes chatting and it's clear that this dude is the reason for the positive change. In addition to a more pro ambience, there have been some changes to the menu and some tasty salads and sandwiches can be had, though I haven't gone back to try some of the less fortunate dishes that have been disappointing in the past. All told, pretty good show, Panera. The outlets, though.\\n\\nUPDATE June 20, 2016: On the plus side, they finally ditched the bathroom code. However, more of the power outlets have died so it's a challenge to find a place to plug in and write. Guys -- GET AN ELECTRICIAN IN THERE, ASAP. \\n\\n*****July 11, 2015***\\n\\nI've got a love/hate relationship with Panera Bread in Coolidge Corner, Brookline. Or maybe it's more of a love/meh/hate relationship.\\n\\nThe love: Sunny, roomy, free wifi. I can usually find a table with an outlet for my laptop. Good iced tea, good coffee. Good A/C on scorcher summer days (no A/C in my home so it's a welcome relief) and best, it's not TOO cold, know what I mean? \\n\\nThe meh: Food prep, quality and ingredients is spotty. If you find something you like, stick to that. I like the Napa Chicken Salad sandwich and the Asian Chicken Salad. Other choices I have tried include the Fuji Apple Salad, Grilled Cheese, and Turkey Avocado sandwich. The Fuji Apple Salad is so weird -- the apples are dried apple chips, and I think the walnuts are candied. The grilled cheese -- a rare indulgence one looks forward to as being a warm, buttery, gooey, crispy-crusty comfort food -- was dry, on cool, dry, barely-toasted bread, and bland gelatinous cheese. Disappointing and a waste of the calories. The Turkey Sandwich was also dry and boring, and I usually love turkey & avocado together. They seem to have good bagels and baked goods but haven't tried those.\\n\\nThe hate: \\n- Those outlets? Not all of them work -- some of them are loosey-goosey when you stick your power plug into them. \\n- The staff? Okay, this is a risk since my face is pictured right on this review, but a note to the young manager lady who wears the manager-looking shirt -- BE QUIET and tell your staff to BE QUIET. YOU ARE ALL TOO LOUD. I have had to move my table from the back (near the kitchen) several times because there is a great social ruckus always going on, caroling, strident oblivious voices yakking incessantly about everything from boyfriends to school to what-have-you, cackling and hooting with laughter. You can't even hear yourself think. it's too bad because \\"the back\\" would otherwise be the quieter place to work, situated as it is in a sort of separate alcove.\\n-- Bathroom code? Ditch the bathroom code, it is entirely unnecessary. Go up and down the whole entire block, no one has a bathroom code. What's the point?\\n\\nAll told, it's convenient for a cool place to work or write with a so-so sandwich and iced tea, it's never too crowded so they let you stay all day (despite signs suggesting a 2-hour limit) and I'll keep coming back.

We decided we would go when we had a big celebration and the timing never fit.  Finally with my sister now in town and us expecting our first child in August, we decided to go to celebrate our April birthdays last night.\\n\\nI could not have been more surprised with the experience.   After reading the reviews and articles, I was expecting great things. It was far from that.   \\n\\nFrasca's focus on the Customer does come across from the moment you walk in the door. I had mentioned in our reservation that it was both my sister and my birthday recently.  When we arrived they said happy birthday.   When we sat down they perfectly placed two Happy Birthday menus in front of us.  We thought we were in for a good start.\\n\\nWe had waited about 15 minutes for our table to clear. They offered us complimentary wine and non alcoholic drinks while we waited.  Then when we sat down they gave us complimentary appetizer to also so sorry. \\n\\nThis was the theme for the night.   We sat down at 8:00pm and did not have our dessert until 11:00pm.   We only ordered the 4 course meal.   That came out to about waiting 45 minutes between courses. Totally unacceptable to me for a well established restaurant.  \\n\\nOn the high notes, our waitress was very very good. She started out by explaining the menu, asking about food allergies and making sure we were ok. She got our first glasses of wine and we were off.  40 mins later she came out with an extra round of wine for my husband, my brother in law and sister, apologizing for the delay, stating the kitchen was backed up with our appetizers.   Then finally the food came out.  The appetizer of Asparagus and Scallops was the best meal of the night.   The scallops were amazing.\\n\\nThen we were off to another 45 minute wait.  They came out with complimentarty small bites.  This was nice but two of the items on the plate my brother in law and I could not eat due to allergies.  I was a bit miffed as we had already told them of the allergies.  To our waitresses credit, she caught the mix up and aplogized.  She came back with something else for my brother in law.  Finally the Primi course came out.   My brother in law raved about the tagliatelle with pork and veal ragu.  The rest of the pasta dishes were good but not great.   One exception; the short rib in the risotto was very good.\\n\\nOur main course came out about 30 minutes after this.  A few times our waitress came out again to apologize.   My sister and husband ordered the Halibut, which they liked.  My brother in law and I split the steak.  I was hoping to be blown away but it was just so so and very fatty.    The biggest problem with the main course was the wine selection. All three of them had asked for the wine pairings with their meal. They first two selections were good but for the main, they gave my husband a red wine with his Halibut.  It was the same exact wine as my brother in law who was eating steak.   I was very surprised to see this and the pairing was really bad.  My husband did not like the wine but also did not want to raise an issue so he drank it.  I was disappointed as Frasca is known for their wine pairings but assumed this was a mistake. (but should have been caught)\\n\\nWe waited about 45 minutes for dessert.  At this point many of the diners who had been seated after us had finished their meal. Most had selected the 8 course pre fix dinner.   Seems this was the way to go.      We were presented with an  after dinner drink as another apology.    Finally the desserts came out and they were very good. The apple celery sorbet was awesome.  And my sister and I were very surprised to get little chocolates as a birthday gift.\\n\\nAll and all, we were left wanting more.  We expected not only good food but also good service.

From the moment we arrived they gave us a very personal experience.  Since I have food allergies not only did they bring out the chef (which is standard practice at Disney restaurants) they also had a different menu that shows menu items for particular allergies.  And to my surprise a lot of the items are dairy free, generally I assume most of the sauces have butter as a base but not here.  I tried the Taste of Africa and the Braised Short Ribs.  Both were excellent and came mostly as it is supposed to without any major modifications (which if you have dairy allergies, probably understand how great it is to eat the menu item as is).  My wife had the filet and it was equally delicious.\\n\\nThis place is fantastic but there is one draw back, it's at the Animal kingdom lodge.

Yes I said 179 days. I tried to get a reservation the first day I could (180 days in advance) and they were booked solid the whole week we were going to be there. Someone must've cancelled because I snagged a reservation for 9:25pm on the Friday we were going to be there. \\n\\nWe checked in for our 9:25pm reservation at 9:20pm and were given a buzzer. As we waited on the bridge quite a few people were trying to get into the castle and were told \\"sorry you can only come in if you have a reservation and we are booked solid for the next 6 months.\\" As you can imagine people were pretty upset. So FINALLY at 9:45pm we got seated. 20 minutes late and starving. We were seated in the ballroom which was very grand and beautiful. Our waitress was an older lady who acted like we were a bother to her for coming in at 9:45pm for dinner. She wanted to rush us presumably so she could end her shift and go home. Not off to a great start here. \\n\\nFood - I ordered the French onion soup as my entree even though it's on the app menu. My husband ordered the steak medium-rare. I was a little ticked they brought the soup out first instead of waiting and bringing it with the steak. Oh well. I was starved and ate it while it was hot. It was AMAZING. Yummmmmmmmm. Best French onion soup I've ever had and it was huge! My husband's steak came and it was overcooked. More like a medium-well instead of medium-rare. It tasted ok but the steak he had at Flying Fish Cafe was WAY better.\\n\\nDessert - My hubby had let our grumpy waitress know we were celebrating our 2 year wedding anniversary. She brought us each a little taste of \\"The Grey Stuff\\" for our special occasion. It was ok. It tastes like cookies and cream flavored whipped cream.

They serve coffee which is pretty good. Overall this place is a good value for a quick breakfast.

The night we went, they weren't particularly busy, and we were seated right away at one of the enormous booths. We started the meal with the bacon deviled eggs, which were okay...as advertised, they tasted like deviled eggs with bacon (although there was some unexpected tarragon action going on, as well). Deviled eggs aren't my favorite, but they were fine. \\n\\nThe main course was definitely the show-stopper of our evening, though. Each of us got a two-meat platter with two sides. He opted for smoked turkey and pulled pork with sides of fries and brunswick stew, while I chose the pulled pork and the 1/4 rack of ribs with sweet potato souffle and succotash. Both meals came with Texas toast and their 7 homemade sauces. \\n\\nBy far, the two standout meats were the smoked turkey, which was juicy and perfectly tender, and the parts of pulled pork with substantial bark. My goodness, that bark was so tasty that no sauce was needed. The ribs were also good, although perhaps a little *too* tender - I like a little bit of chew to my ribs. The pulled pork without bark was ok, but lacked that extra depth of flavor. \\n\\nThe seasoned waffle fries were fine, but mostly useful as a vehicle for trying the various sauces. The succotash was just okay and consisted of corn, edamame, and tomatoes, served chilled. The brunswick stew, which was the last thing eaten on the table, was underwhelming. It had a great savory flavor but was missing something that makes brunswick stew amazing. We weren't able to put our finger on it exactly...was it not sweet enough? not enough tang? Either way, it wasn't quite satisfying. The sweet potato souffle was a sweet, fluffy dream that could easily be the star of any Thanksgiving dessert table. \\n\\nThe sauces were all tasty, but the standout was definitely the savory sauce. The cherry Coke and sweet sauces kind of blended into each other, and the Carolina vinegar sauce wasn't vinegary or spicy enough in my opinion. The spicy sauce was also curiously mild. The other two sauces, the Alabama white and the Carolina mustard, were tasty but definitely niche flavors. \\n\\nThe service was friendly and earnest throughout the evening, and we spent most of the meal exchanging wide-eyed looks of delight as we put bite after bite of deliciousness in our mouths. Even with the few disappointments, I still think it merits five stars, and we will definitely be back soon."},{"name":"La Scala","address":"4199 W Dublin Granville Rd","city":"Dublin","stars":"3.5","text":"I had the pine nut crusted grouper.

Initially I only could get a reservation for two and thought I'd let my husband take our daughter as a special treat, but at the last minute I found a reservation for four people. We were so excited to take our daughter, thinking she would absolutely love it. Instead, it was like she was tolerating it thinking that we wanted to be there.\\n\\nFirst of all, despite all the work it took to get the reservation, when we arrived we were placed in a line that took somewhere between 20 to 30 minutes.

I have been a hardcore breakfast burrito lover for many years, and have tried offerings from almost all the top spots in inner Portland, but nothing comes close to the goodness that comes out of Pepper Box. PBC is a New Mexican style breakfast spot that is undeniably chile centric - no matter what you get, it's really all about that amazing hatch chile. For most items you get a choice of red or green chili, or you can get half and half (christmas) to try a bit of both. \\n\\nAfter trying almost their entire menu I have landed on the special breakfast sopapilla as my go-to. Its a fried quick bread filled with potato and egg, and covered with melted cheese and chile, and you can add one of their various meat offerings as well. Their \\"original\\" breakfast taco is a close runner up. With potato, egg, meat, cheese, and chile, on their house made flour tortilla, this is a basic taco that has everything you need and nothing you don't. Over the last several years (both at this location and the old food cart on MLK) I have consumed well over 100 of these and can't stop coming back for more. These tacos are highly addictive!\\n\\nOverall I always prefer their breakfast offerings over their lunch items, but there are a few lunch standouts like the chorizo burger and the green chile mac & cheese that can be hard to pass up. If you're looking for the best breakfast taco in Portland, you'll find it here. Remember, though, that this place is all about celebrating New Mexico's incredible Hatch chile. If you're not into saucy chile smothering your food, make sure to order it on the side. I, on the other hand, always ask for extra ;)"},{"name":"DD Mau","address":"1239 Pacific Boulvard","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4","text":"mau down\\n\\nI miss BMB, mostly their kimchi poutine - as delicious as it sounds funky.

Parking can be pretty lousy at times with the cramped lot but on this particular Sunday for whatever reason we were able to find parking.  I always order the hot and sour soup with noodles with a side of the spicy wontons. I know a couple years back they changed the noodles but now they offer several types (thin, glass, rice, etc). I always order the thin noodle, but I do miss the ones they used to come with previously. They've jazzed up the menu since the last time I visited (more pictures!). It looks like they did away with a lot of their appetizers, including my favorite deep fried squid tentacles. Nooo!

There's a great variety including crab legs, steamed clams, crawfish, fried frog legs, seaweed salad, kim chi, build your own noodles, salad bar, soup, dim sum, etc. There was also sashimi displayed on a cold pack and a poke-like dish with Mae Ploy and a nice variety of sushi including BBQ eel, my favorite. The Asian fried chicken was moist, and the egg custard was yummy. I thought everything was appropriately seasoned except for the fried rice, which was bland. The food seemed fresh, but this may vary between peak hours. What do you expect from a buffet though? To finish it all off, the soft serve icecream was creamy--not icy. \\nEverything was not perfect, but with the vast variety, you can find plenty of favorites to fill up on.

A large group of family were getting together. I suggested we all go to Borgata's new location. There was so many great food choices that we all wanted to taste. Our server suggested we dine family style on multiple dishes. That was a winning suggestion. Add in some great wine pairings, and this place was a complete hit.\\n\\nThis is the most recent location(2017), which we anticipated for far too long. There were all kinds of brand new plaza construction delays. No worries. We always had our E Dublin Granville location to feed our desires. 3 BIG changes here are the larger space, patio dining(see pic), and of course a full bar. One crucial piece missing is signage. This is not the businesses fault. It is the building developers design flaw. I do love landscaping and greenery, but the street lined young trees hide this beautiful new spot. The plaza is right on the southwest corner of 161 and Linworth. Spacious parking lot. Well lit for safety. \\n\\nApproaching the glass door entrance is a big arbor patio with tables & chairs to your left(see pic). Some twinkling light strands and mature vineing floral is going to make this a hot spot patio. Now you walk inside to see an open kitchen directly ahead on the far wall. The lengthy bar on your right, reaches out to welcome you. With a red brick front and wood top, it draws your eyes upward. There perched on a large overhang is a big chalkboard(see pic) with colorful chalk menu items. Black ceiling with exposed ductwork and lighting. These are the same iron and wood tables as the other location. Good call on that decor.\\n\\nThe service was spot on. They had great menu knowledge and suggestions. Beverages were continually filled, and plating cleared. Tough job for a party of 30. They did it all with a smile. There is no kids menu but our server did suggest a couple small pasta plates. The kids were eating off all the plates anyway. The portions are quite large to share. I think the kids were all quite happy, judging by the smiles.\\n\\nThe food here was consistent with the East spot. I think they are making sauce at one spot, for both places. Same with some of the other items. Everything is made fresh daily, or to order. We could see into the kitchen as they were pounding and breading the chicken for the Parmesan. I've previously tried and loved the fresh salad, pizza(see video), chicken parm, cavatelli, marinara, meatball, garlic cheese bread, and canolli. So I was all about sharing some Chicken pesto pizza, Gnocchi Alfredo, and that delicious Sausage stuffed pepper. That will be the first item I order on my next visit. What a fireworks of favors on the palette.\\n\\nThis location has a FULL bar. 6 beers on tap(see pic), and Borgata labeled wines from Camelot Cellars. Great Chianti style with wonderful fruity flavors. I admit I sampled many of the wines on the table. Pino Grigio. Barolo. A red Montepulciano which must of been good, because it was gone, and I only got a sip. There was a special seasonal wine in house that night. A cranberry Malbec that blew us away. I took home a bottle. It will be a great wine with the upcoming fall holidays. I bought it has a host gift. We'll see if it makes it that long. The restaurant does have a retail license for selling bottles out the door. \\n\\nAs you do go out the door, you can look down and see two footprints on the floor.

Since we're new to the neighborhood and don't know the good bunch spots, we decided to go in here with a friend one Saturday morning.  We should have looked more closely at the menu or asked more questions.  Apparently the only actual cooking they do at Colleen's is with a panini press or a microwave.  My brunch-mates both ordered eggs and I ordered a grilled cheese and soup.  When the food came, it was disappointing.  Microwaved eggs are tough and weird.  The soup had been microwaved too and tasted like it was from a can.  Even the toast wasn't toasted enough.  The only thing yummy on our table was my grilled cheese (thank goodness, bc if they'd messed that up I think I'd have to give them a 1-star review!)\\n\\nLike I said above, we'll probably try the ice cream again.

Every visit is as good if not better than the visit before.  It's amazing to see a restaurant not just sustain a high level, but continue to push the envelope.  Hat's off to Frasca!\\n\\nOn this visit, I sat at the bar by myself for dinner.  It's Boulder so I made quick friends sitting to the right and left of me.  I started off with the Salumi plate. It was loaded with Prosciutto San Daniele, Speck, and Salame plated with some horseradish and crispy yummy thin breadsticks.  They paired my salumi plate with a lovely Tocai.  Let's be honest, it doesn't get much better than a plate full of cured meats and yummy wine.  Actually, it does get better.  Next up was a half order of a dish called \\"21 Orders\\".  I'm not sure why it's named what it's named, but I can only guess that 21 is the number of orders you will want to eat.  Its Tagliatelle tossed in a cream sauce with house made sausage.  They paired this dish with the Molvia 2002 Veliko Bianco from Slovenia.   Another perfect dish and perfect pairing!    I wrapped up my dinner with the Pork Loin w/ Lentil Parsnip Ragu, Braeburn Apple, and Grain Mustard.  Another home run dish.  The lentils were cooked to perfection and the dish kept me thinking about skipping dessert and ordering another pork loin.  They actually paired this dish with two separate wines. The first was the Summerer 2005 Riesling Urgestein from Austria.  This wine played well with the apples.  The second wine was the Frontafredda 2001 Barolo from Piemonte. Once again they picked a winner.  \\n\\nUncharacteristically I actually skipped dessert because Mike Doughty was playing that night at Trilogy.  Unfortunately, when I arrived tickets were sold out and I was turned away into the cold Boulder night. \\n\\nThe decor at Frasca is warm, charming, and mountain modern.  The room is always buzzing with the sounds of wine being drank and food being ate.  The service is superb right down to the last detail.  That stems from the passion of Bobby Stuckey.  There aren't many owners out there like Bobby.  He's a well dressed man that would charm the socks off just about anybody. The best part is, he knows just about everything about wine, but presents that knowledge in a very digestible and casual manner.  I love this restaurant and I have sneaking suspicion that you will too.

The girl who took our order said \\"oh, they've been saying your name.\\"  They were saying it relatively quietly on the other side of the counter.  After it had sat there for more than 20 minutes not one person thought to go to the other side of the restaurant (its split in the middle by the line that you order in) to see if we may be on that side.  The bitch that took our order even looked at us at one point with a look that was like \\"I think that is his order but I don't want to say anything.\\"  We sat there with multiple employees walking by after sitting there with no food for 30 minutes and not one person asked us if the order might possibly be ours or anything else along the lines. All the while other employees were going on a man-hunt for someone that ordered a potato because they were staying there to eat.  Basically if you care about service at all, do not go here.  Do not go there if you plan to order to go.  If you do, make sure you sit close to the right side of the counter, otherwise you will not know when your order comes out.

That they're closed on Sundays. \\n2. The food. \\n3. That they actually train their employees how to provide \\"Exceptional Customer Service\\", or \\"ECS\\" as I call it. \\n\\nIt's rare that I'm not in a rush. Today I wasn't, so I was able to watch this one little thing unfold with appreciation. \\n\\nThe place was not overly busy, but they were understaffed. I only saw one employee, and boy was she hustling. She was clearly working with a purpose. I'm not sure of her name, but I think it was Sami (cute young blonde girl with glasses). \\n\\nSo here is the one little thing that she did that impressed me: Despite being run ragged, she took 2 seconds to greet me when I walked in. She acknowledged my existence, something 99% of fast-food and retail workers never do. I used to manage big-box retail stores - high-performing stores - many years ago, and this was something I taught INCESSANTLY. \\n\\nI watched her working for a minute, and admired her work ethic. I thought, \\"maybe she grew up on a farm and learned it there\\". But I know Chick-fil-A, like Enterprise Car Rentals, actually hires and trains people this way. So I was not too surprised when, with her hands full, a minute later, she turned to me again and said, \\"I will be right with you, sir, it will just be a minute\\". Clearly, she was well trained; clearly, she's a quality person. I know, because I'm an expert on this topic! \\n\\nMcDonalds used to be this way, back in the 80's, in my hometown of Sheboygan, WI. But Mickey D's is not this way anymore; which is why I now prefer Chick-Fil-A. Hey McDonald's - the menu isn't the problem.

Everything was on point, and the staff at the restaurant was extremely accommodating with all of our needs. My girls were sleeping when we arrived for our reservation, and they allowed us to bring the stroller inside, even removing chairs at our table so the stroller could fit. We were seated promptly, and were immediately greeted by both a waiter and the manager. Drinks were brought just as promptly, and we were able to hold off on ordering for the girls until they woke up, which was nice, as we never felt rushed.\\n\\nWe were given complimentary bread for the table, which was a nice touch. My mom ordered the calamari appetizer, and said it was some of the best she's ever had. I really wanted a Caesar salad for my app, but it wasn't on the app menu. I asked anyway, and they brought out an entire entr√©e size portion for me instead! The salad was delicious, but I couldn't even finish it because it was so large! Next, my mom ordered the Linguini Al Scoglio, but asked if they could use a white wine sauce instead. The manager checked with the kitchen, and informed her they'd be happy to make the switch. Again, my mom loved it and ate every bite. I ordered the Lasagna Verde, which came out full of vegetables and a delicious white sauce. It was fantastic, though again too much to finish!\\n\\nAt this time, the girls woke up, and the manager was so kind to take their stroller out of the restaurant for me so I could continue to enjoy my meal. I got the girls each a fresh fruit appetizer, which was one of the best kids' fruit cups I've ever seen! It had grapes, blueberries, strawberries, and raspberries. No cheap melon at all. The girls really like pasta and meatballs, and they were kind enough to leave the red sauce off completely and just put some butter on it. No messy clothes! I also ordered them a cheese pizza so I could compare it to our previous visit, and I am happy to report it was much improved. The pie was fully cooked, very cheesy, and with great flavor. They didn't eat dessert, though there were great kids' choices.\\n\\nMy mom got the Coppa dii Brutti Ma Buoni, a gelato and Amarena cherry sundae, which was delicious. She barely let me have a bite! I got the Gelato Frizzante, which was basically an ice cream sundae.

Also our server never quality checked and never asked if I wanted another drink.\\n\\nThen our table didn't get cleared for another 30 minutes. We moved to one side of the table, and one of the servers tried to clean the other tables. I can understand and respect that. But instead of bringing a tray to clear the table and then wipe it down, she put all the empty glasses in front of us. And then put garbage in the glasses and then cleared it after she was done setting the other table. This is by far the worst service I have received. Again I can understand if our food was delayed or the server couldn't get to us right away cause she was busy, but to treat us like a nuisance than a customer is so unacceptable. I did enjoy the trivia but it did not make up for everything else.\\n\\nApplebee's management I highly recommend looking into reviewing your training procedures in the politest way possible.

My favorite is the rare beef noodle soup, which I think is the best I have ever had. Now I've never been to Vietnam, but I have had pho in many other places including L.A., San Diego, Hong Kong and Boston, and I have yet to find a bowl of pho that is as tasty and delicious as Xing Xinh's (although the pho I had in HK was pretty close). I think their broth has such a depth of flavor that I don't see at a lot of places. The noodles, rice plates, fried rice, vermicelli bows and spring rolls are also super delicious. I had the Bo Xao Rau Cai (beef stir fried with mixed vegetables) once and it was the most tender, flavorful beef stir fry I have ever had. I have never had a bad experience here and the wait staff is always very friendly and attentive! The only down side is it's a pretty small place so it can get crowded, but their food it so good, I would sit on the floor and eat. I recommend this place to anyone who likes pho. They offer multiples kinds of soup/broth including vegetable (a favorite of my college roommate who is a vegetarian) and you leave feeling full for around $7/person."},{"name":"Shisha Lounge","address":"2369 N High St","city":"Columbus","stars":"3","text":"Go to shisha if you want to be seen smoking hookah.

BC Sushi is ridiculously cheap for an all-you-can-eat sushi restaurant on Broadway, especially with its late night rates (that start after 9:30 pm) and happy hour rates (between the hours of 4:30 pm and 6:00 pm). There are two different menu's available - Menu A (with additional items on it, such as sashimi) and Menu B (a basic menu without the extra items, making it a lower price than Menu A). You get your money's worth with Menu A if you enjoy sashimi, as this alone when ordered via a-la-carte is probably as much as an entire all-you-can-eat plan. The overall quality of the food is subpar, but it's kind of hard to have good quality food when sushi is just being mass produced for an all-you-can-eat menu, especially late at night.

I was excited to try this place out and I was ready to chow down like no ones business. So I ended up ordering the Chef Curry and added crispy tofu and lemon grass beef to it as well as a banh mi with the 7-spice chicken added to that. The food portions are hearty and I didn't finish both these items and for $20 bucks give or take, I'm thinking that's good deal and I had left overs. The curry rice dish and the banh mi I feel can be split amongst two people. So next time, I'll split the food, that is, if I want to go back. I was honestly disappointed with the food. Maybe the Asian in me prefers the Asian curries I grew up with and appreciates more the banh mi sandwiches made in the Vietnamese hole in the wall mom and pop shops.\\n\\nI think the ingredients in the curry dish are clean and fresh and was full of flavor, and I like how I got lots of sauce. My thing growing up was rice and sauce, so that deserves a hand clap. My only gripe is the rice was mushy and it clumped together, FAIL. NO MUSHY CLUMPED RICE PLEASE! Rice is the one big component of this dish, so to mess that up, is a big deal. The bread for the banh was nicely baked, crispy and soft, again ingredients were nice and fresh. However, much of the filing fell out as I tried to take a bite of it. I suggest with this type of sub roll, hollow out some of the bread if you are keeping these ingredients as chopped and bite size or instead of having the ingredients chopped into bite size pieces, to hold the filing in, long strips of the veggie's and slices of protein to keep most of the filling in the bread. Overall, I think I'm a traditionalist when it comes to my curries and banh mi. I like my curries and banh mi's the classic ways. Overall, I'm happy I gave it a try. Maybe one day I'll go back and give it another go. And maybe next time when I order the plantain chips with salsa I'll get them. I was told that they did not have containers to hold them so they can't sell them to me when I tried to order them today...BAH! But until then, this place didn't made the cut for me.

The brisket was so flavorful, there was no need to add any kind of BBQ sauce to it.  I've always felt that, with really good BBQ, meat should taste so good on its own that you wouldn't want to mask it with any additional sauce.  Well, that's how it was at Hog Wild today.  I was also impressed with their relatively large selection of side dishes.  They had some items that many other BBQ places don't have.

I don't think they consider themselves a sports bar FYI. \\n\\n1.FOOD:  They had a wide variety of food to choose from.  I had the french toast and it was awesome.  Very good and so was the coffee.  Good beer selecton too. The prices were not bad.  I believe $10 or below for their breakfast menu.\\n\\n2. SERVICE: Grant it there were only 20 patrons in the place in addition to a banquet room rented out by members of our military, but my service was prompt and I never had to wait for a re-fill.  In fact, the bartender was working the bar but also coming over to my table and she always gave me a cold glass for my beer when I was ready for another.  She was very nice.\\n\\n3. LAYOUT:  Very clean and new. The bar area consists of about 10 tables with stools (no backrests however).  It's not a large area by any means but adequate.  There are 4 flatscreens I believe in this area.  Next to the Bar is a covered outdoor area.  I did not go out there but I believe they had a tv and ample seating.  I believe Texas Tech Alumni rent out that room for all their games.  They have a banquet room and around the corner from there is the main seating area.  I peaked in there and they have booths and about 2-3 flatscreens.  There may have been some regular tables as well.\\n\\nOverall this is a nice place and I will go back to try their lunch/dinner menu.

My mother and I were taking a weekend holiday to go to Mickey's Not So Scary Halloween in Disney and we were very lucky to get our reservation. There was no luck on a reservation until about 2 days before our night at Disney. It was a perfect timing at 8:30pm because we had a whole schedule on what we were planning to do that evening. \\n\\nWe got to the restaurant about 20 minutes early and we went ahead and checked-in. Please note, if you're planning to visit this restaurant, esp for dinner, make sure to have a reservation! They don't let people into the restaurant, although I did hear that they let a few non-diners go in on certain times to just take pictures. The clock hit 8:30pm when I received my text saying that our table was ready and we were met by our seater who sat us in the Ballroom. I was very happy because the last time I was here I sat in the Rose Room. Our table wasn't the best location but I didn't complain. The table set up was beautiful with the napkins in shape of roses. \\n\\nSince this was our last evening in Disney, and my mother's first time at the restaurant, I wanted to make sure we had a really good meal. They don't have a really large menu, but all their choices makes it hard to decide what you're in the mood for. We started with the Mussels which were really good. The broth that the mussels were in made the mussels even better tasting! The bruschetta was a little soggy since it was placed directly into the broth but was still good nonetheless. \\n\\nAs for our entrees, I ordered the Grilled Strip Steak, cooked medium. I was in a major steak mood that evening, and I was completely satisfied with my whole meal! The steak was nice and juicy and the steak frites were delicious. The plate also came with beans that were crunchy and yummy. My mother ordered the Roasted Pork Tenderloin and she loved her meal just as much as I did! The cherry-mustard sauce really accommodated the pork very well. The presentation for both meals were very orderly and placed with care. I always like seeing how chefs put just as much effort in plating as they are cooking. \\n\\nSo what's a big dinner without dessert? Our server came over with the large tray with assorted desserts, but because we're at Beast's castle and we were there for Mickey's Not So Scary, we got the Grey Stuff and the Pumpkin Cheesecake. *sigh* Both desserts were just WOW! I literally could just eat the Grey Stuff by itself. Ours came on top of a creme tart of some sort (on some occasions I've seen it on top of a cupcake). The pumpkin cheesecake was creamy and it just melted in my mouth. I didn't care if I got a major sugar rush. It was all worth it!\\n\\nFor the full experience, we had a great time! The bill wasn't even as bad as I thought! \\n\\n1 appetizer\\n2 entrees\\n2 desserts (1 specialty dessert that cost $1 more than the regular desserts)\\n2 sodas\\n\\n= $100\\n\\nOur server was very attentive (unfortunately, I don't remember her name). We got to meet the Beast after dinner and we got lucky with no line! If you're a fan of Beauty and the Beast, I would definitely recommend coming here! All the dining rooms are beautifully decorated and  you can take all the pictures you want! Just make sure that you have a reservation and try to make it as early as you can.

We have eaten at Boma (African themed buffet restaurant at Animal Kingdom Lodge) several times (we live in SE Florida) and were always curious about Jiko. This trip was without the family, just the two of us, so we decided to try it out.\\n\\nWe explained to our server that my wife had issues with spicy foods and peppers; not easy at an African restaurant. He called out 'Chef Tom'. Tom, originally from NY, has been cooking at WDW for 20 years. Tom suggested the fillet (wife's favorite steak) but with different sides, selected from other menu items. A customized plate, just for her! Disney is known for this level of concern for dietary needs, and although our server was experienced and knowledgeable, (he suggested two great wines), having kitchen staff come out to discuss a diner's needs is really top notch.\\n\\nWe also shared the wild boar app, based on other reviews, and were not disappointed. I had the pork shank. OMG, a huge portion of wonderfully seasoned, fall off the bone goodness! We left very happy campers.\\n\\nEpilogue - We had valet parked our car (free for Tables of Wonderland members at all Disney hotels, when eating a meal). After waiting an extraordinarily long time to get our car back, the valet supervisor sheepishly came over and told us one of his people had forgotten to put our key on the key board, and had gone home. With our car key in her pocket! Although she was on her way back, the supervisor asked us to accompany him to the hotel desk to arrange for a \\"little something\\" to compensate us for our inconvenience.

The staff is always nice and the drinks are plentiful but if you make a big deal about having to wait, you'll just make yourself look like a douche.  I wouldn't consider the food to be what someone would want to line their stomach with before drinking obscene amounts of cheap swill... so eat somewhere else before unless you like paying for snacks.  \\n\\nUpdate:  due to the owner's childish and defensive tone below, I will reiterate what was said above.  Fresh ingredients aren't stale nacho chips with canned tomato made salsa.  Lots of places in PDX love to flash the \\"fresh\\" flag but if you look in their kitchens you will find shelves filled with canned goods.  The staff is always nice; no shade there, buddy.  Yelp is the platform where EVERYONE is a critic, by the way.  That's the point.  Your customers are regulars, one-timers and those who get dragged there by friends because they can't find a classier place to go on Wednesday.  You're 1/2 a step above a dive bar only dives have a brooding personality that keep people coming back.  Beulahland feels more like a nightclub for hair band roadies.  I never said the bar is bad.

I don't know if there's a new owner, a cook that started messing up in the kitchen, or if it's the tough economy and the owners are cutting corners - but for sure it wasn't the near four stars I would have given it the last time I was there.

I didn't wait long for the spring rolls, which were average but  the seafood noodle soup really hit the spot. The broth wasn't too salty, and the noodle to soup ratio was perfect.

Our waitress (Lizabetta) was phenomenal and saw we were struggling on what kind to get so should told us to pick four types and they would split it on the pizza. We ended up picking the artichoke and truffle, eggplant and prosciutto, spicy sausage, and vegetable; all were phenomenal especially the artichoke with truffle oil... TO DIE FOR. My only complaint on the pizza is when they said it was prosciutto I was expecting that it was going to be the prosciutto type of meat. I should have been smarter and realized they were just saying ham using fancy Italian words. When our three feet of pizza arrived we said \\"this is going to make a phenomenal midnight snack\\" The pizza never had a chance, we devoured it then licked the truffle oil off the pan.\\n\\nWe also got their fried veggie and calamari appetizer along with orzo balls.

The pasta was freshly made and the lobster sauce was sweet and savory. \\n\\nAfter wanting to go here for years I was impressed. The only let down would be the grey stuff. That's all anyone talked about but it tasted like a stale cookie with some icing on top. The triple chocolate cupcake was way better! During our dessert the beast walked out right behind us!

Full bar and good drinks but the only problem was there is no California wine.  All the wine here is from Italy.  Not bad though.  We sat down and the thing i love about this place is that you can order 1/2 orders of the pasta entrees.  So after we ordered the Arugala salad and enjoyed that thoroughly, we split 3 different 1/2 orders or pasta.  The bolognese was incredible!!! my girlfriend is a nut for bolognese and she loved it.  Then we got the parpadelle which had lobster and spicy red sauce over their homeade pasta.  All the pasta is homeade which is great!!! We were 2 for 2 so far with the 1/2 entrees.  Then we got the homeade ravioli, which was good but didn't compare the the other two.  We ended our night with the warm toffee pudding which was incredible.  I don't usually eat sweets but it was excellent.  Could have used a scoop of ice cream instead of the whipped cream but it was still excellent.

We all come to Magic kingdom to experience the magic behind its doors. Being a guest and dining at Be our Guest, as most people already know is very hard to come by as reservations has to be made months ahead of time. With that said we expect it to be spectacular. Of course the castle it resides in is breath taking and give you the feel like you were in the movie and truly feel like you're in the fairytale itself. But this is why I gave a 2 and not a 5. Their food, and not only the food but the price you ll pay for it. At first I kept my concerns to myself as I try wanted to let the truth be told in itself but after reading many disappointed post from other sites I wanted to make sure I put my two cents in to help other avoid this mistake. Again not to discredit the restaurant but to inform other individuals. Expect to pay $30+ per meal per adult. Their menu is limited and of par. I was not impressed at all by my pasta dish nor did my boyfriend with his pork dish and barely ate half of it. The cupcake looked very professionally and delicious ( esp the grey stuff cupcake) but was like any other cupcake you would buy at the store. We spent the money for the experience of being a guest there but I would not go back there again for their food. There are many other restaurants in the park where we spent as much if not more for amazing quality food and not regret it once so money is not the issue in this situation. It's the quality.

I went last night with my boyfriend, and the service was awful. There was no one to seat us so we had to stand their awkwardly for a while. We finally flagged someone down and were seated. Then we waited a good 15 minutes for someone to come take our orders. The restaurant is tiny and was not super busy, so we should not have waited that long. Finally got to order, and the waitress was horrible. I asked to explain some of the wines and what some of the things on the menu were, and she was pretty rude about it. I felt like she was looking down on me for not knowing how they prepared their food. If you are going to charge so much for food, make sure your staff is courteous to the customers. Finally ordered our food. By the way, took almost an hour to get it. We did the Fixed Price menu, and let me tell you, it is NOT worth $32 dollars. I ordered Pate, and I am not sure what I got but that was NOT traditional Pate. I am from Europe and that's a common dish we eat with out bread. So not sure what they were serving. My boyfriend got the flank steak, which was super chewy and very hard to swallow without choking. Worst quality meat. My salmon tasted very fishy so I just didn't eat it. I get salmon a lot, and this place can not cook their fish very well.\\n\\nThe waitress would not let us order our deserts at the same time we ordered our food.

The drinks are definitely very strong, so if you're a \\"I don't like the taste of alcohol\\" type of drinker like I am, you may want to stick to a traditional drink, like Sweet Tea with a splash of sprite. If you do order a specialty drink and end up not liking it, don't be afraid to ask your server to exchange it out.

I felt also like the wine situation was a little bit awkward - I'm reasonably well-versed in the different varietals/regions/general food matching guidelines, but don't consider myself a wine connoisseur by any means.  my boyfriend suggested that we both liked a certain variety of wine and listed a few he had tried and liked recently, to which our waiter responded \\"so do you prefer new world or old world?\\"  um, what?  I have no idea what that means with regard to wine, and feel like in a restaurant as nice as this they should talk with you a little more to gauge how much you really know about wine, and make a point to make sure you are comfortable rather than intimidated when choosing from an extensive wine list, rather than throwing out wine terms that I'm not sure you should expect the general public to understand.  we asked him to explain the terms and he did, he asked us a price point and we said under $100, and then said he had some ideas and would bring out something (he was mumbling as he walkd away so we didn't catch it).  I will echo others sentiments here that the sommelier (and waiter, actually) did not seem particularly concerned with whether we felt comfortable with our wine-ordering experience or selection, which I think should be key for a restaurant that prides itself on an extensive wine selection.\\n\\nwell we weren't sure at that point if he meant he was bringing out a bottle for us or what, but the next thing I know the sommelier shows up and we had to repeat everything we just said, and then had to tell him we weren't really sure if our waiter was coming back with a bottle of wine or if he was saying he would bring out whoever the sommelier was.  it got a little confusing for a bit but we ended up with a great wine and an even better meal.

They have different music playing out there that made it feel like a party. The scene is amazing; you'll be snapchatting during your whole meal. Loved the Bloody Mary and the bellini. Don't get a coffee - it wasn't that good and they spill it everywhere. Espresso was better. Safer too.\\nThe burrata is a MUST. They throw some crispy deliciousness in there that you're gonna love. The florentine benedict was pretty good, but had way too much spinach. I picked most of it off. The steak and eggs is delicious and a great portion size.\\nThe only thing holding this place back from 5 stars was how long it takes to get anything: a drink, an appetizer, a meal. Luckily it was a beautiful day so we enjoyed the scenery, but don't go here if you're in a rush! \\nOverall, we're happy to see this place in Eastie and will definitely be going back.

I would smoke dozens of cigarettes and drink too much strong coffee.  When they closed/moved, it felt like Austin was a little less like Austin.  I then found Flightpath hidden in a corner of Hyde park and felt happy again.  For years they were great for coffee and reading the Sunday paper with assorted characters.  I gave up cigarettes, but still maintained my coffee habits.  Then the Flightpath installed WiFi and became more of an office than a cafe. And again Austin felt a little less like home.  So the search continued until I found, hidden on a dirt road in East Austin, Cafe Mundi.  That's right, 5th street was not paved a few years ago and there was something damned adventurous about trekking down a dirt road in the middle of a city.  Now 5th street is paved over, and they have Wifi at Mundi, but this place still feels like Austin.  On any given day there is a crowd of slackers, artists, hippies, musicians, poets, bicyclists, kids, and oddballs.  They serve great coffee and great snacks.

The chicken was seasoned oh-so nicely, with a nice blend that makes you wish you could forget all the heavily salted junk you get at other places.

We sat down outside and a waitress came by and quickly grabbed the menus that were at the table. No hello welcome, no ill be right with you, nothing. Since we were confused if they were still serving outside I went inside and asked one of the waitresses (blonde), she seemed very flustered and not organized at all. She said yes but they were transitioning to lunch. I said ok, could I get a lunch menu? She said she'd bring it out but she was busy. I said well we are kind of in a hurry and could we get one now so we could decide what we want quicker? She passed my request onto someone else who obliged and by then I already had a bad taste in my mouth and it wasn't bitter coffee.

The small pizza I ordered was 13 bucks, and while it was delicious, I feel it was overpriced for what I got (10 inch pie).  The beer I ordered I feel should have been about a half to a dollar less than what I paid.  I was also unhappy with our waitress.

Alas.....the Mahi Mahi was dry, the macadamia did not encrust the fish, but rather sat atop it in a glob mixed with something tasting like maple syrup.   \\n\\nThe poor food was only a part of the awful experience.\\n\\nPaying the check turned into a fiasco.   We had called ahead and been told that any number of gift certificates would be accepted at once.  So, we enclosed the bill holder with the four cards and cash tip for the total amount to the waitress.  Twenty minutes later, only three of the cards went through.  Once that happened, the manger came over apologizing and charged us the measly $12 difference.\\n\\nRestaurant management 101:   If a mistake happens on the behalf of the staff, the GM or Manager will compensate.  He should have paid for that $12 out of his pocket and addressed the problem with his Superior later.  \\n\\nHad we not been gifted cards to go to Chart House, we likely would have stayed to our usual haunts with excellent food, service and atmosphere; but we thought, nice gift, let's give it a go.\\n\\nWe will always be sorry that we did.

It took awhile to realize who our waiter was (Joseph I believe), had to ask for bread/butter like 4 times, our daughters mac n cheese didn't come (apparently got delivered to the wrong table), ask for ketchup and never got it, and our medium steak was well done. And for some reason the food delivery staff member thought it was a good idea to put the ice cream dessert right in front of my 12 month old where she just slammed her hand on the dessert. There was plenty of room on the table for him to place it but he put it an inch from an infant-okayyy?! \\nOther than the well done steak, the food is just as good as the dallas location. The service was just a bit off. Maybe it was bc it was the dinner before Mother's Day, maybe bc it's still fairly new and they are still figuring things out.

And now after all this time, the day came. We entered the rocks and it was a magnificently themed facade going on. The people that sat you down rang out \\"The Master has a table for the Blank family!\\" and then handed you a little Lumiere figurine as you walked to your table in one of three great dining halls. We got seated in the main, grand hall, which was glorious. Chandeliers-a-plenty with snowy mountains out the window and the snow was visibly snowing. It was great. At a couple points in the night, Beast himself strolled through the dining hall giving everyone greetings and thanks for eating at his joint. The appearance and theming alone earned this place major points. \\n\\nNow, for the food. \\nFor the appetizer, we had the Assorted Cured Meats and Sausages plate (served with Cornichons, Pickled Onions, and Toasted Baguette). All of it was pretty good. I'm not one for fancy meat and cheese plates, but Brittany is, so I figured we might as well try it. The baguette was actually very above average for bread in general. The meats were good, the cheese was good, and there was a sweet tomato jam on it that I actually wish I had a lot more of even at home. So good. \\n\\nFor my entree, I had the Grilled Strip Steak (with Garlic-Herb Butter and Pommes Frites), cooked medium rare. Emphasis on the medium rare. The steak itself was the best one I have had in a very long time.The cook was perfect mostly, the fat was rendered so nicely, that it was edible and delicious, and just for flair, the grill marks were pretty nice, too. Very, very good steak. The green beans underneath were also probably the best green beans I have ever had, legitimately. They had such a great crisp to them and the seasoning was so on point. The garlic-herb butter was on the plate, but it honestly didn't add anything to the dish for me, other than a dipping sauce for the french fries, which were also very above average. \\n\\nMy girlfriend had the Saut√©ed Shrimp and Scallops (with Lobster, Mushrooms, and Seasonal Vegetables in a creamy Lobster Sauce). The lobster was shredded up and tasted like it was butter poached; very nice. The shrimps and the scallops were honestly the best cooked I've had in all of my time in Orlando. The shrimp has such a good bite to them and they were cooked perfectly. The scallops were also wonderfully cooked. These two items are so easy to overcook, but this place did them right, and they didn't taste like they were frozen. Perfect. Also, the pasta was good. So delicate and tasty; also obviously freshly made.\\n\\nThen on to dessert. We were so full that we only wanted to split one, and the obvious choice was The \\"Grey Stuff\\" (Chocolate Shell, Cookie Cr√®me topped with Lumiere's special \\"Grey Stuff\\"). The dishes had told us that it was delicious. The chocolate shell was a little jolting at first. It was a harder-than-expected shell that crumbled and kind of exploded when we first spooned our way into it, but once we got the hang of it, it was a really good dessert. Crispy and creamy and grey.\\n\\nI like to say that I don't like to hand out too many five star ratings, because then it just seems like I'm a pushover when it comes to these places, but looking at my own profile, it looks like I'm nothing but a giant pushover. Lol. Either way, even if I was the crankiest old man on the planet, nothing would be able to stop me from giving this place the five stars that this place friggin' earned."},{"name":"The Rock House Grill","address":"8145 SE 82nd Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"UPDATE: The owner contacted me and let me know that he still owns the cart.

The size was no bigger than 3.5oz and it looked like the restaurant piled extra rice on the plate to try to fill out the empty space.  My dad is not a big eater but he left the restaurant hungry after eating everything on his plate.  When a party of 4 pays a $400 tab, nobody should leave hungry or disappointed like we did.  My mother and I ordered the lobster.  The food runner delivered it and asked if we wanted our lobster cracked.  We said yes (because we weren't provided with any lobster crackers).  He disappeared.  5 minutes later our waiter came over and realized the mistake.  He took our lobsters away to crack them, but they weren't  returned to us for another 10 minutes and the lobster was cold.  By the time we were able to start eating our lobster, my father and my boyfriend had both already finished their meals.  The drink service was too slow.  Whenever we ordered new drinks they would take at least 15 minutes to arrive.  I dont think any of this was our waiter's fault.  The drinks on the tab were correctly listed as Absolut (and not gin) and the bar was slammed, but they need to figure out a way to speed up the drink service.  The food runner should not have delivered our lobsters without making sure they were cracked first, and the waiter was shocked and apologetic when the runner made this error.  Although the waiter was apologetic, nothing could make up for our horrible experience.  Also, The bathrooms were despicable with urine and toilet paper all over the floor and toilet seats.  My parents are from out of town and when they come to Boston they look forward to quality seafood and drinks. You won't get either at the Chart House...not unless they make some significant changes.  We went to Oceanaire the next night, which is owned by the same parent company as the Chart House.  Prices were comparable, but the quality of the halibut and oysters and the service was out of this world compared to the Chart House.  And...the bar served my dad the CORRECT drink on the first try!  We will never step foot in the Chart House ever again.  Oceanaire is our new \\"go-to\\" seafood stop."},{"name":"Teatro","address":"177 Tremont St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"The environment and the way Teatro is decorated with its high Italian ceilings, and the Service...are all excellent.

Monthly lunch with a good friend and this was my pick. The menu is what it is, and it is enough. They focus on what they do well, and that is fine. I had the smothered cornflakes with artichokes. Pretty yummy with a bit of a tang from the sauce. I skipped the corn salsa and I am glad I did. The corncake, artichokes, coleslaw, Mac and cheese, and sauce were more than enough in my bowl. Everything was super yummy. I also enjoyed a really delicious chocolate crinkle and a black cherry soda. Perfect for a Sat afternoon lunch splurge. My companion enjoyed her brisket bowl and carrot cake as well. Now, for the critiques...yes, it is expensive for what you get. I say either lower the cost or up the portion. I would be fine with a lowered cost as I felt it was enough food. My companion just wanted more yummy food. Parking is spartan in the lot, but just walk a few yards across Grandview Ave and you will be fine. The carrot cake was mildly disappointing. Carrot and cake. No other yummy adds - walnut, raisins, pineapple, etc. Okay, but not spectacular. But that is it. On the whole a really nice lunch. Good food, good service, and a nice atmosphere.

Smelled more like a hospital than a BBQ restaurant.\\n\\nThe food was ok, but the service was absolutely terrible.  At least for our table.  We came on a Saturday for lunch around noon, maybe 1/4 of the restaurant had customers so it was quite empty.  Our server, Lesley, was pleasant enough but incredibly unattentive and that led to cold food and a very unappealing visit.\\n\\nWe ordered three tapas for two of us, Lady Killers (fried pickles), Epinadas and the Cherry Cola ribs.  As I noted, the restaurant was perhaps 1/4 full when we arrived.  30 minutes after placing our order, we noticed that other tables around us that had ordered after us were already getting their meals.  We could not find Lesley to find out why our small plates were taking so long with such a quiet afternoon restaurant.  \\n\\nWhen we finally flagged him down, he explained that the fried food take longer to prepare and he would check on them.  Seriously?  He obviously doesn't know how restaurants work and that fried foods take the LEAST amount of time to prepare.  \\n\\n10 minutes later, we finally had the Epinadas and the Cherry Cola ribs. Of course the Epinadas were marginally warm and the ribs were flat out cold.  He obviously forgot our orders sitting in the back and then just served them.  And of course he immediately disappeared so we couldn't tell him about the cold food.  So we had to flag down a different server to take the ribs back to the kitchen, we ate the Epinadas because at that point we had been waiting 40 minutes.  The epinadas had a very good filling, only not nearly enough.  The shell was over half empty.\\n\\n10 minutes later (1 hour after we placed the original order) the fried pickles showed up, only Lesley didn't bring the dipping sauce.  When my colleague asked about that, he said, absolutely and he would go get it.  Why not bring the order and the sauce at the same time.   A few minutes later the newly re-heated ribs showed up.   The ribs were good, but not worth a 1 hour 10 minute wait.  The pickles were good but not worth a 1 hour wait.  \\n\\nTo top it all off, we asked Lesley (when we flagged him down) to get us some wet wipes so we could wipe off the BBQ sauce.  5 minutes later he still had not reappeared with them so we flagged down a manager to get them.\\n\\nReally bummed to have such a lousy experience because I literally live around the corner and was looking forward to having a good BBQ joint nearby.

He kept repeating, over and over, that \\"No Chinese cooks!\\" make his food, and other local Greek restaurants have \\"Chinese cooks!\\" which apparently makes them 'inauthentic and awful.' I cannot honestly say how many times he repeated, \\"No Chinese cooks!\\" My god man, give it a rest. Is he mentally unstable? Maybe, in which case this might just be crazy talk.

I was standing at the bar and the bartender was busy and said to me after several mins with cash in hand \\" are you ordering takeout?\\" I said no I just want to order drinks before I get seated so she just walked away and said nothing. Next came back never talked to us again. Well my parents  got seats at the bar so we sat the same bartender didn't say hi didn't give use menus. She was also taking Togo orders the place really needs to have 2 bartenders or just a Togo person. Anyway in the middle of the Togo order I guess it was long she threw the phone down and took the couples order next to us but still didn't say anything still no menus. So my dad asked the host to be seated outside. My dad goes and sits outside the host just pointed and said go there. My mom and I followed a few mins later sat there for a few mins my mom got up and went back inside and grabbed menus off the host stand. We sat at our table for a while and no one came over. A server saw us and said has your server come over yet \\"no wasn't sure if we had one\\" 1st timers. He said I'll get your drinks and find her. Well since my parents are kind of cranky at this point he said I'll just take your order too. He came back with Togo and silverware & cups and said \\"sorry we ran out of clean dishes.\\" My dad started talking about how the bartender was kinda rude how she threw the phone and ignored us. Well then the flood gates opened and the server unloaded and complained about her and how she makes him lose money every weekend. He also said she was the manager wow mind blown on that one. He said every weekend it's always super busy she always takes for ever only waits on the people she knows at the bar and never works the server well.

It's a French restaurant, but don't go looking for escargot, as it is Disney, so they serve very Amercian-friendly staples.  Think roasted chicken, pork chops, etc. for entrees and common French appetizers of onion soup and mussels.  To be honest (which is kind of the point of Yelp reviews, right?), if this review were on the food alone, I'd probably give it two stars, as truly, \\"meh, I've experienced better.\\"  Not that anything at all was bad, I just think perhaps I just had very high expectations for the food given the hype leading up to this restaurant's opening, but never really acknowledged that it is, in fact, a one-credit restaurant and not signature dining.  \\n\\nMy partner and I visited for the table service dinner and started with the seasonal salad trio, which at the time of our visit consisted of a green bean salad, a watermelon/radish salad, and a roasted beet salad with raisins and oranges.  Nothing remarkable about any of these, but a good choice as a light starter after being in the sun all day.  I had the pork chop for my entree, and much like the salad starter, I just didn't think there was anything memorable about the dish.  The chop was described as \\"thyme-scented\\" but I wished it were more like \\"thyme-rubbed\\" or \\"thyme-encrusted\\" as it was kind of bland.  Juicy and nicely presented, but bland.  The macaroni side was actually the star of the plate for me.  To end, dessert is wheeled around the dining room on a cart and guests choose from an assortment of cupcakes.  I do recall my very chocolaty cupcake being quite moist and delicious.\\n\\nDinner service is not a character meal per se, but the Beast does make an appearance.  He walked through the dining room and waved during our meal and you can stop and have a photo taken with him on the way out.\\n\\nTwo things bump this place up from two to three stars.  First, and perhaps the most exciting for all 21+ Disney guests is the availability of wine at dinner!  Finally I can eat dinner and then ride Space Mountain with a good buzz on!  Secondly, if you're a Beauty and the Beast fan, your jaw will drop at the decor of this place.  It really is like walking into scenes from the movie.  Absolutely amazing.  The atmosphere here really is more befitting of a signature dining restaurant in my opinion.  \\n\\nSo, to summarize, food is ok, just not remarkable, but this restaurant is certainly worth a visit simply just to see and of course, to unwind with an adult beverage."},{"name":"Taco Loco Mexican Grill","address":"44 Broadway","city":"Somerville","stars":"4","text":"Taco Loco is amazing.

The food is okay for the price. But it's a very good opportunity to check out the whole restaurant. You pick your seat unlike at dinner time. But if you want that prized table in the West Wing, you'll probably have to wait a while. They do allow you to walk about. If you're not down for spending some cash for your lunch and would like just to try the Grey stuff I believe you can. There was a couple next to us at lunch who only got dessert.

I have friends who do the right thing and book this when you're able at 180 days. Me? I slack off and end up having to check at random times of the day, and night. Dinner is the hardest time to book this restaurant. But when you do, and I believe in you, you will, it's probably the best character meets I've ever had. And the food is pretty good too. \\n\\nBoth times I've gone I've gotten the seafood pasta. This is my all time favorite pasta dish in the WDW resort. I crave it all the time after. I don't eat much pasta and I'm no expert, so this might be basic to you. But I love that it's cooked al dente and the sauce includes lobster and it's not too light or heavy. The scallops are my favorite part of the dish. They're so soft and tender and go so well with every thing. My boyfriend has gotten the lamb and the infamous steak. I'm not much of a meat eater but he loved both of them. \\n\\nThe grey stuff has changed since our first visit there. First it was chocolate mouse then it was a while chocolate tart. It's cute and I love the crunchy pearl sprinkle things it's topped with. It's definitely worth a try, ask the dishes \\n\\nWe've been lucky enough to get seated in the West Wing for dinner.

But there are ways to get around it if you really want to just see the restaurant itself. If you love Beauty and the Beast like I do, it's worth coming for dinner to meet the master.

Hoping that I had just caught this newly established restaurant on an off day, I decided to come back today for dinner. And to my pleasure, both the food and service was impeccable. I went with the same dish I had both previous times, \\"The OG\\" with chicken. \\n\\nI am retracting all the issues I had on my previous visit, let the dry meatballs since I didn't try them today, though I'm sure that was just a one time issue as well. \\n\\nThe restaurant itself is beautifully modern, the best fast casual restaurant design I've ever been in. The food is delicious, portions sizable, and prices are extremely reasonable. Even cheaper than most larger fast casual chains. The staff was extremely polite, especially considering they knew I had written a less favorable review after my previous visit. \\n\\nSince I'm in this area for dinner nearly every day, I will be sure to make Grainmaker a frequent stop. \\n\\nIf you're a fan of rice bowls or wanting to try some new flavors, I cannot recommend this place highly enough!\\n\\n --\\nOriginal 3-Star review:\\n--\\n\\nCame here for the first time last week and had a delicious reasonably priced meal. My second visit today did sadly not live up to the expectations set by my first visit. \\n\\nFirst, they seem to have two different sized bowls for their meals. Last time I got the bigger of the two, yet this time I was given the smaller. Why? Who knows, as both bowls were on the counter. She even grabbed the larger one, before switching it out for a smaller. \\n\\nThen I went to get the delicious chicken I had last time, but to no avail. At 6pm they were out, and suggested I get the steak instead. As I didn't want steak, I reluctantly settled with the meatballs. To my surprise I was charged an extra $1.50 for them, despite initially only wanting chicken. \\n\\nFinally, after starting to eat I was disappointed to find out that the meatballs were among the driest I have ever had. They even made me long for my old college dining hall food, which hasn't happened since graduation. \\n\\nThe jasmine rice was awfully overcooked, clumpy and quickly turned into a mush upon eating. As if that wasn't enough, I had gotten the bottom scrape from the rice bowl, clearly burnt and hard as uncooked rice. Doesn't seem to be a middle point here. \\n\\nOnly reason I'm not dropping them below a 3-Star rating is because of the great meal I had on my first visit. I'm hoping this is just an off day, though I'll probably never find out as there are plenty other dinner options in the area I'll favor over Grainmaker next time."},{"name":"Smokebelly BBQ","address":"128 E Andrews Dr NW","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3.5","text":"So good!\\n\\nWe went here for dinner on Sunday.

Chinese people are cheap, and this happens more often then you would think.  \\n\\nSo other signs of this being a bad place:  \\n\\n1) Environment and decor is horrid:  We're talking old, recycled red chairs and jade green formica table tops.  The environment had a very old, not clean, cheap feeling.  The Chinese waiters and what I presume the lady manager stared us all down as if we were doing something wrong the whole time (very unsettling).  \\n\\n2) And there were NO ASIAN PEOPLE!  This is not a good sign folks.  Only white people, who really don't know better and think Orange Chicken is divine Chinese food.  \\n\\n3) The nail that slammed the coffin shut, is when we received the check, I politely provided the Living Social printout ($10 for $20).  The male waiter looks at the coupon, then the older lady waitress walks past (I assume the manager), spoke in some non-descript Chinese.  The male waiter then translates back to us, \\"Sorry, we do not take the coupon during lunch hours.\\"  Embarrassed I apologized and provided a credit card.  However, while waiting, I looked everywhere on the printout, including back onto the online Living Social page w/ my phone and did not see any limitations.  I told the waiter this when he got back to us with the reciept, and he apologized for the inconvenience, and said he was new and he will \\"make things right\\", please come again.  Obviously the waiter was only trying to be polite as he didn't want to lose his tip.  \\n\\nRather then come again, I will never come again, and get my refund from Living Social.  Never again.

The negative aspects of this place are readily apparent, but are largely the result of this place's popularity.  The restaurant is tiny, and so waits can be long, with a very crowded inside dining area (though you can eat outside over at the triple nickel during nice weather).  \\n\\nThe food itself, however, is pretty damn good, and so most folks are willing to tolerate a bit of a wait.  Both biscuit dishes we ordered were excellent (I got the one with bacon and chicken), and I have to give high marks to the quality of the gravy here.  The stumptown coffee options were also a nice touch I thought.  Only down side was the hash brown dish we shared, which came with country ham.  The ham added a salty element the dish really didn't need, though we still scarffed it down.  \\n\\nService and low key ambiance were great otherwise, and I'm sure we'll stop by here again.

Usually I don't look forward to doing too much other than drinking rum and hanging with my family but Disney, specifically EPCOT, summoned me to a pizza review this year. Now I love me some Disney. I read about it on a fairly daily basis and I would say that I am a Disney geek. So I knew about their new pizza restaurant from NY restaurateur Nick Valenti Via Napoli about 1 year before it opened. Since I had joined up with this crew of pizza junkies on pizzahunt.net I was very much looking forward to visiting Via Napoli. I expected great pizza, especially for $16.00 for a 10 inch pie. What I got was a very different story.\\n\\nNow I tend to stick to a pretty consistent rating system. If the restaurant has wood fire or fire grilled in the description of the pizza section I am going to get the pizza Margherita. This is the amoeba of the pizza world. Simple, clean, and consistent in its presentation. Dough, sauce, cheese, a toss of olive oil, and basil (maybe tomatoes) nothing fancy. Via Napoli used the best in all of these categories but still fell way short on the overall pie.\\n\\nNow I am here with my family; wife, kid, mom, brother, and sister in law. We order a pizza Margherita and a white pizza with truffle oil, artichokes, and pecorino cheese. The service is excellent, thanks a lot to Francesca. The white pizza was great and very original. The Margherita pizza...not so much. The dough was the best part of the pie, Caputo flour and hand tossed roasted to perfection in an 800 degree oven. The sauce came from San Marzano tomatoes, but was ground and not milled. There were seeds in the sauce that added a little bitterness to it. Not a season ender but it definite put this pie on the disabled list for about a month. My biggest issue was the cheese and basil which was spotty and non-existent respectively. I mean check the picture. Disney must have been out of basil that day. 6 slices of basil, not 6 leaves...6 biased cut slices. Seriously. No added flavor to it for that nice ending punch that basil provides. The cheese was spotty and I felt a little robbed. But overall a poor experience on the Margherita side of things. The other pizza was great. Inventive, tasty, and gone like Lindsay Lohan's career (my brother's picture says it all). I would recommend it.\\n\\nFrancesca asked me how my pizza was and I told her lacking in several departments. She asked me if I could do better and I said yes. I actually asked her if I could teach the pizza chefs there. In doing so I embarrassed my wife and amused myself but hey, I like pizza and I think I know my stuff. Via Napoli please walk the walk. I wanted to love you. You had three giant wood fired ovens named after volcanoes and they made pizza, just not consistently. Do your job....make good expensive pizza.\\n\\nNow back to my rum and ignoring reality."},{"name":"Ah-Ma's Taiwanese Kitchen","address":"931 Monroe Dr, Ste A-108","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"This place is in a plaza with Trader Joe's, so there's ample parking, although it is a little hard to get a spot on the weekends, so I would recommend circling around.\\n\\nWe love coming here for two of the dishes, the lu rou fan (Taiwanese braised pork rice bowl) and the beef noodle soup. Lu rou fan use to be a childhood favorite of mine when I lived in China, and I was super excited to find it again in the States, especially when it tastes as good as this. It comes in a medium sized bowl, with ample rice, pork, a tea egg, and some cilantro. Although it was smaller than I thought, it really fills you up.\\n\\nThe beef noodle soup is equally delicious, and comes in a much larger bowl. The ratio of noodles to meat to soup is great, and it's extremely savory.\\n\\nSometimes, we order the salt and pepper chicken as an appetizer. It's good, but nothing to rave home about.\\n\\nThis restaurant also has baos. I tried one when we first came, but it's extremely pricey for a single bao that only tasted so-so. The baos seem to be more of a fad, and doesn't justify the high price\\n\\nI'd definitely recommend this place if you're in the Midtown area, but it is pricey.

You wait in line like you do for a ride and people guide you to the next open kiosk where you order your meal electronically on a touchscreen (so you're not going to get substitutions or anything like that).  Then you proceed to find yourself a table and they bring the food out to you in a rolling cart.  I asked how they know where I'm going to sit.  The cast member said, \\"It's magic!\\" :).  I think it had something to do with our magic bands though.  And sure enough, they brought our food to our table with complimentary pastries and real silverware.  The quick service food wasn't the typical pizza or hotdog.  It was really delicious food - we got the crepes, open face ham sandwich, and some fresh fruit.

When a restaurant or cafe makes a mistake, the customer should not have to pay for it.\\n\\nI did the math in my head again later and realized that I had, in fact, paid the right amount for the grilled cheese and iced coffee. So essentially, the barista messed up my order and made me pay a random extra fee that I never should have been charged (since the girl at the cash register charged me for the right two items in the first place). \\n\\nThe grilled cheese was also a flop. The bread tasted somewhat stale, the cheese was still chunky and unmelted, and the bacon had essentially no flavor and didn't add much to the sandwich overall. Since cheese is the main component of a grilled cheese, I usually like my grilled cheeses with somewhat sharper cheese. The one from Crema used a realllly mild cheese.\\n\\nThe iced coffee was fine. Their coffees are generally pretty hit or miss; I've gotten delicious cups that are rich and perfect with some milk, and I've gotten horribly acidic brews that leave a terrible aftertaste. \\n\\nUltimately, I am unsure whether I will be coming here again. I would like to say that I won't be, but since it is a change of pace from Starbucks and I live so close, I probably will end up here again at some point."},{"name":"Mighty Fine Burgers Fries & Shakes","address":"10515 N Mo-Pac Expy, Ste 105","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"Food:  \\n           The burgers are pretty good, nothing to write home to mom about, but they're pretty damn good.

Living the better half of my almost 30 years in Oregon City has not yet yielded me to find any of those places - until today. (\\"Today\\" being many months ago when I first drafted this review, oops) The waiter quite literally greeted 80% of the customers by name as they walked in and asked if they'd like their \\"usual\\". I had read a review about the \\"original cast iron stools\\" at the bar and knew I HAD to check this out. If you read the front of the menu, it tells you that It originally opened during prohibition in 1929 on 7th St as a candy and ice cream shoppe until 1935 when it moved to its current location as a bar and restaurant. The original liquor license issued to Hannah Howell from 1934 still proudly hangs on the wall above the table closest to the front entrance, along with a few other sepia and black and white photographs showcasing the joint in its original glory. Every time I've been in here (which has been easily 20 since first finding out about this place), Howell's has been full of mostly elderly couples and middle aged men enjoying their bottomless cup of coffee with toast and eggs. Walk in, seat yourself and either the older gentleman or the young guy will grab you some coffee and take your order. Menus are kept on the table so you don't need to worry about waiting on a slow server. I've heard the country fried steak is to die for but I haven't been able to steer away from the Farmers omelette that I order as a scramble with onions. Well then there's the sandwiches. Hence the name Howell's Sandwiches displayed above the old wooden door. The French dip is deliciois , but order it with onion rings. Mmm. The taco salad was mediocre I suppose but a ridiculously large proportion, then again I'm not sure any of their dishes are anything but huge. I'm not a tuna person but my sister orders the tuna melt religiously at our lunchtime rendezvous (rendezvouses? Is there a plural?) She says it's the best tuna melt she's ever had. A very vital piece of information? Breakfast is served ALL DAY. The bathrooms look like a scene imagined straight from a Stephen King novel, at any given time, there will likely be a perverted Santa Clause look alike peering through his spectacles and over his Sunday paper to watch you devour your food,  and the draft from the front door might be a little too cold for an icy December morning.

The spicy tuna roll didn't have that much flavour.\\n\\nWe then asked for the bill, and we paid with a credit card. Once we hand the credit card terminal back to the waitress, she points to the receipt that spits out and indicates that because they are a customer service business, they request that they be tipped a minimum of 10%.

My most recent visit, I used the Disney Deluxe Dining Plan.  I enjoyed the meat and cheese plate for an appetizer, and the scallops and shrimp in lobster sauce for my entree.  My scallops were so well-cooked and delicious, they cut apart nicely and were not at all chewy.  And of course, dessert featured the famous \\"grey stuff\\" (try it, it's delicious, don't believe me, ask the dishes!).  I don't care for the chocolate cake part of it, as I am not a fan of chocolate cake, but the \\"grey stuff\\" (which, if I recall correctly, is a cookies and cream mousse) really was delicious.  Our server was very attentive, had great recommendations, and was extremely polite.  \\n\\nAnd that's all before I've even touched the subject of the atmosphere.\\n\\nIf Disney knows how to do anything really, really well, it's atmosphere.  The main \\"ballroom\\" looks just like the infamous scene out of Beauty and the Beast.  The \\"windows\\" are made to look like you're in the mountains visiting the Beast's castle, and it looks like it's snowing.  My only complaint about the dining room is that all the tables are all squished together. I was lucky enough to visit just as Magic Kingdom had switched over to Christmas decorations, so the \\"ballroom\\" was decorated with garland and a beautiful tree because \\"the Beast loves Christmas.\\"  You can also visit the formerly forbidden West Wing, where you will find a portrait of the Beast as a human, along with the rose with falling petals.  Opposite that is a room that looks a bit like the inside of a music box, featuring a large rotating figure of Bell and the Beast dancing, and several portraits from the film.  \\n\\nAt the end of your meal, you can meet the Beast in his study and take photos with him.  I am not sure if that is only for dinner or not, but it is one of my favorite parts of it.  Yes, you have to work pretty hard to get an ADR for it, but for dinner, I would say it's definitely worth it.  Easily my favorite place to dine in the Magic Kingdom (as MK doesn't really have too much table service...I think Cinderella's Royal Table and Jungle Navigation Co. are the only ones in MK proper, aside from the fireworks dessert parties).

The food is fairly tasty, we came both times during the breakfast buffet (which is mega overpriced, but so is everything at Disney). It's like $75 to eat here for breakfast for two adults and one 3 year old child not including tip. My husband enjoyed many of their breakfast meats, they have some they hand slice and also bacon and sausage. I'm a carb fanatic so it was all about the Mickey waffles and pastries. I did eat scrambled eggs to get some protein in there. The kid loved the chocolate frosted donuts. No real complaints on the food aside from the price point.\\n\\nThe bad: The service. The 1st time we came we did not know they prefer reservations (reservations you have to give a credit card number to even secure). The hostesses were rude and kept referring to my husband as Jason, which is not his name. It was half dead in there and they had tons of empty tables (end of breakfast time) but they were so reluctant to give us one. I was getting fed up and said, \\"Fine, let's go someplace else\\" and magically (must have been Disney magic) they decided they could give us a table then. The servers are okay but the first one we had messed up my son's milk and gave no apology or offer to fix it. So we had milk sitting at the table he would not touch. Thanks for charging for that anyhow. The bill said they expect a gratuity of 18-20% FOR A BUFFET. I think they are trying to take advantage of foreign people's tipping concepts because 18-20% is not the normal tipping amount at American buffets. We tipped 15% and that was generous. Especially since the server got my kid's milk wrong. The second time we came back the server was better but he lost my husband's credit card. Which was a pain in the butt to have to cancel on vacation. Accidents happen but it certainly didn't improve our view of this place.\\n\\nWould I come back?

I think the queso is baked, which sounds potentially awesome but it's lumpy and sticks to the bowl everytime. In all honesty, I do love the skinny margarita because it's straight tequila and lime juice so you know you're getting actually what you pay for and I prefer my drinks more strong/sour than sweet. Though the service has been mediocre at best, usually messing up at least one item on the bill, I guess it's succeeding as one of the newer short north hot spots. And although cynical, I think Bakersfield will continue to improve in service and quality when the hype starts to die a little bit.

I feel that it lifts your spirit and it's soothing at the same time.  I liked it so much I got some to go. \\n2) December Rose - this is a stronger flavour tea with a slight astringent taste. \\n3) Take Me to Neverland - we both felt this was average. \\n\\nSavoury tier - sandwiches are good, just a little too salty for me, but not a big deal and still tasty. \\n\\nScones - we tried both the cheddar and citrus sweet. The citrus scone is twice as big as the cheddar for some reason. The cheddar is quite average, but the citrus scone was delicious. \\n\\nDessert tier - I didn't love most of the desserts (I'm not a dessert person), but my partner loved the cheesecake and cupcake with matcha Cesar and coconut shavings. \\n\\nWe would definitely recommend this place to our friends for the unlimited tea selection.

We sat at the bar for a good 5-10 minutes before being acknowledged, even though there were only 2 others at the bar. The bartender seemed more interested in making experimental shots and talking to servers at the other end of the bar. This trend continued all night. We were probably sitting for almost 15-20 minutes before he took our food order, and we never once said we needed more time to decide or anything like that.

I've ordered various noodle dishes off the menu a few times and the large servings are always fresh and delicious.  Constantly filled water glasses and teapots are always welcome.\\n\\nThe only reason it doesn't get 5 stars from me is that if you go later, the regularity of the service and quality/heat/freshness of the dishes seems to lessen, probably because they are so busy.\\n\\nThe best time to go, particularly on Sunday is between 10:30-11:30 as the lineups start after that.

Some of the veggies were on the raw side, and didn't add much, except a little needed crunch to help with the soft noodles. The flavor was okay, but I thought I needed to pick it up some with soy sauce.
