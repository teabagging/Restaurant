My cousin ordered the roast pork with cornbread gravy, broccoli souffle and mashed potatoes.  My fried chicken was kind of dry and bland.  Not impressed with it at all.  I had better fried chicken at Golden Daisy (chinese style fried drumettes) or Gussie's (SF SoulFood).  My sweet potato souffle tasted like a cup of sugar had been poured on it (just like the sweet tea, which tasted like super concentrated sugar water, no tea) and the Mac and Cheese had a weird consistency that reminded me of eggs.  Don't ask why.  My cousin's roasted pork with cornbread gravy was pretty good.  The pork was tender and the cornbread gravy had some pretty good flavor.  My cousin's mashed potatoes didn't come with gravy, so I got a side of gravy for my dried out fried chicken and she used that.  We ordered peach cobbler for dessert and although it was pretty sweet (like they added extra sugar), it was pretty delicious.

However, when we looked at it, the actual total was 128.00 with a $69.00 gratuity. ... Bottom line we paid 197.09 at the end. Looks like TI is getting jipped on the back end and the customers are getting jipped on the front end!

Well let's just say that Tony needs some serious training on the POS system and posting payments ( he posted our payment to someone else's bill, reversed it and recharged). Wells Fargo here I come as I know we will be double charged when it's all said and done.

She even gave us the happy hour price of $5 a glass even after 7:00 when happy hour was over!  For dinner, I had the spaghetti and meatballs and it was delicious!  I was expecting maybe 2-3 meatballs in this dish, but I was pleasantly wrong!  You got a generous portion of pasta and about 7 meatballs and it definitely filled me up.  Both the pasta and meatballs are homemade, which makes this dish taste fresh and very appetizing.\\n\\nMy second time visiting Nick's was just as pleasant as the first, but this time I went on my lunch break from work.  Our server was very cool and attentive.  We went for the create your own pasta dish.  Unfortunately what we were looking for was not a choice.  We wanted some penne pasta with alfredo sauce and grilled chicken.  The pasta and chicken were on the list, but no alfredo sauce to be seen.  Our waiter asked the chef if he could whip up some alfredo for us and he said no problem!  Our pasta was delicious!  The perfect amount of cheesiness to the sauce and was not runny.

We had our appetizer before our drinks and food was not far behind.  If you want to draw out your meal just wait to order your entree until after you're well through your app. People next to us got their app maybe 3 minutes before dinner arrived. This makes sense as they prepare a ton of the meals constantly, just something to be aware of.\\n\\nOverall I liked the place a lot.

Why? I judge them by how tasty their broth is, how well they cook the noodles, and if my meal leaves me wanting more.\\n\\nBroken Rice was able to impress me in several ways. Unlike many pho establishments, my broth remained clear even as I scooped out the last piece of meat. You know how most places have a cloudy looking broth as you finish eating? Never happened here. Did I mention how fresh the broth tasted? The noodles had the perfect rice noodle texture. It wasn't under or overcooked, and their presentation was appetizing.\\n\\nUnlike the conventional way of serving pho, Broken Rice does not have the two bottles of sauce next to you as you sit down. Rather, they have the sauces in a small dish on the same tray alongside your raw vegetables and pho. Since pho isn't their featured dish, I can't help but assume they make it fresh.\\n\\nThis place is clean, cozy, comfortable, and the staff are polite (they don't yell at each other in Vietnamese like most places do).\\n\\nFew changes that I'd like to see, however, are the spoons served with pho. Rather than metal tablespoons, it would be nice to have the conventional Asian soup spoon. The pho could use more meat and noodles (as desirable as the pho was, I was still hungry), and filtered ice water would be nice (the taste of tap water was evident).\\n\\nI'd definitely return because I yearn to explore their menu more.

Surprise ruined!! It didn't ruin the night, but that could have been avoided on their end. Then, after finally receiving our glasses of champagne, I was giving a little toast to my boyfriend, and the waitress interrupted me right in the middle to ask how the champagne was. Is this amateur hour or what?! We had put two small plates in when we ordered drinks, both of which were delicious, but I told her we'd probably order a few more things. She never came back to take our order, so we just asked for the check and left. Poor service, but excellent food! I would go back to order the things on the menu we missed."},{"name":"Chick-fil-A","address":"461 N Central Ave","city":"Hapeville","stars":"4","text":"I love this place.

My boyfriend and I went here on a Saturday night for a date and we were seated right away. I won a competition at work and had $200 to play around with. \\n\\nWe ordered Ray's Station wine, Running with the Bulls wine, shrimp cocktail, 2 8 oz filets, fries, asparagus, and a chocolate cake(to go). Whew. \\n\\nThe wines were absolutely amazing. My boyfriend raved about how much he  enjoyed his from start to finish. They both were very smooth. \\n\\nShrimp cocktail were the biggest shrimp I have ever seen in my life. I didn't know they came that big. They were so soft and the two sauces that came with them were perfect. \\n\\nOur steaks were phenomenal. The little cow (which we had no idea what it was) was a cute little touch. Both steaks were cooked perfectly at medium. The steak sauce we chose came in little bottles along with the steak to add to the dish as you please and the char on the steak was perfect. \\n\\nFries were amazing. They had a perfect amount of rosemary and salt. The ketchup was not my favorite but it was nice that it was homemade. The asparagus were just a little too thick for our liking but they had great flavor. \\n\\nI haven't had the dessert yet, but I assume it'll knock my socks off like everything else. Our waiter (the tallest guy there!) was great. Very attentive and helpful with any questions we asked. I asked one of the gentlemen where the restrooms were and he walked me all the way there which was nice! \\n\\nI am returning with a party of 20 in two weeks and I couldn't be more excited to give them the business, experience the food again, and show my family how awesome this place is!"},{"name":"Mizu Teppanyaki and Sushi","address":"809 Cypress Pkwy","city":"Kissimmee","stars":"4","text":"Awesome Sushi experience..

Sadly, I was pretty disappointed by the food, especially at its price point. \\n\\nLogistics, ambience, and service first -This place is packed, and it can be hard to get reservations during prime dining hours on open table without planning a few days to a week in advance. The service was fantastic and the wait staff was attentive and checked in frequently. The ambience is lively, and there was a cool band playing, but it was a little loud for a date night. The tables are crammed into a small dining space and we constantly had butts in our faces as people squeezed by. Romantic, right?\\n\\nThe cocktails were pretty, but disappointing, especially for being in the $10 range.  I am a big mint mojito fan, but the one we ordered was 90% ice and tasted like sweet mint water. The pisco sour was decent, but also full of sugar.  I would recommend sticking to the wine list.\\n\\nOkay, so now the food. I am mostly vegetarian (a weekend pescatarian :P) so we stuck to the seafood dishes. They have numerous small plates, a few salads and soups, and entrees. There are a couple vegetarian dishes, but nothing vegan, which was as expected.  The 2 highlights of the evening were the octopus and the crab and shrimp stuffed avocado. The octopus was very tender and the potato mash it rested upon was just delicious. The crab avocado plate did not skimp on the seafood and the combination was enjoyable. We got the grilled asparagus as well, which was good, but nothing special. For the entree, we shared a pescado al rocoto y kion. The fish of the night was halibut. The fish was prepared well but the broth was kind of just salty and one note and the bok choy was lukewarm. There were random hot chili bombs that would destroy my palate. The quinoa and asparagus was flavorful and served on the side so I ate it separately. After the disappointment of the cocktails and dinner, I was hoping dessert would be a redeeming factor. We ordered the chocolate cake, which was a good rich and dense torte. We also ordered the duo classico, a combo of two different rice puddings. The flavor was there, but it was a tiny portion and ice cold. I really wish it was served warm. It would've brought out the spices in the pudding. \\n\\nOverall, my date and I had an okay experience, but the food and drinks just aren't worth the hype or price tag.

I liked that the pork knuckles had more meat than fat trimmings and sauce to dunk it in making it less plain. The ban chan spread was pretty awesome IMO, since they're really fresh (none of that sitting in a jar for a long time rancid, ammonia smell). On top of the rice bowl with ban chan, I had the kimche jige soup noodles and that was simply slurpin' delish. I loved how the spicy, savory, sourness melds together.

The soup was spot on, loaded with bean sprouts, tofu, and surprisingly a large amount of tender chicken breast bits. \\n\\nWhile I was waiting, the owner told me their noodle supply is carefully selected to make sure it does not absorb all the grease and oil while cooking. After tasting the Singapore Noodles, I must say I agree with her. The noodles taste very refreshing and chewy, not soggy or greasy at all.  Unlike some cheap Chinese restaurants, the dish was bursting with  fragrance and flavor, yet the curry taste was not extremely strong. The portion was also great, with plenty of veggie, chicken and shrimps.\\n\\nI am very impressed by the history of Sun Tong Luck, and am happy to see they continue to serve the local whole-hearted.

The atmosphere is relaxed, the service is always great, and the food is always good.  \\n\\nTonight we discovered the happy-hour specials everyone else has mentioned here.  For $20 you get the dinner special plus your choice of two additional courses (appetizer, soup, salad, or dessert).  This has got to be one of the best dinner values in Columbus.  \\n\\nWe decided to split the fried Brie appetizer to start.  This was every bit as good as you imagine fried Brie would be.  The only complaint here is that the toast was a little burnt.  \\n\\nNext up were the salads:  I had the spinach salad and my wife had the caesar.  Both were well done but nothing really outstanding about either of them.  \\n\\nThe dinner was an outstanding lamb and duck stew.  The meat was as tender as could be.  The flavor was deep and rich.  It was immensely satisfying.  It struck me more as a fall dish, but given the cold, overcast weather tonight it was perfect.  If this were on the menu, I would go back for it regularly.  \\n\\nFor dessert we split the rhubarb tart with strawberry ice cream.  The filling was perfectly balance tart and sweet.  The crust was a little dry, but overall I'd get this dessert again.  \\n\\nBlack Creek is really close to getting a fifth star from me, it's just the minor complaints that really hold it up.

The cheese plate was good, the flatbread was meh, the cookies were awesome. I asked the bartender for a whiskey old fashioned, he gave me some fruity crap in a glass (not an old fashioned). \\nRight, the drinks and food were a mixed bag.. mostly the food lacked flavor and the drinks lacked alcohol. The cookies were still good. \\nSo it was a Tuesday night, celebrating a birthday. We were racking up a big bill and the place was basically empty. The manager at some point stood at the end of the bar and glared at us for a long while. Then while we were still drinking the bartender handed us one check for the group. Basically so they could hit us with the group gratuity. \\nThe manager was a total ass, and while the bartender was nice, his skills were not so good. \\nIts not like we ordered 1 cheap drink and that was it, we spent around $500...

First, they used to put 3 pieces of meat on the regular ramen (which is already not much) but now it has fallen to just 2 pieces, which is ridiculously stingy.

The hostess on the phone was very pleasant and said they were indeed open until 9:30, so we should come on in!

I said we would be there in 20 minutes, to which she replied, \\"see you soon!\\"  We got there a little before 8:30, but when we entered, the hostess said that the wait was around 45 minutes, and since they close in an hour, they are no longer taking names.  She then suggested we come back tomorrow at 11AM... which isn't really a helpful thing to hear when you're looking for dinner.  We left a bit annoyed.  This is precisely why I had called before we made the trip over.  We were trying to avoid a situation exactly like this.

I almost want to give it a 5 because of the impeccable service we received at the UYE last night (http://www.yelp.com/events/atlanta-buford-highway-uye-panahar-bangladeshi-cuisine).  Eleven of us braved the tornado watch and made it safely into the cozy confines of Panahar.  Despite the severe weather, the restaurant was very busy and there was another large party there as well.\\n\\nI have to give the staff a lot of credit (Mirza and Rabiul in particular).  They were great in accommodating our large group.  I arrived at the restaurant early and our table was already set up.  Earlier in the week, the owner, Mirza, emailed me a special menu for our group.  It was a multi-course Bangladeshi dinner for $22 per person.  I declined at the time after asking the UYE attendees whether they'd be interested or not.  When our entire group was seated, Mirza asked us what foods we'd be interested in trying (based on our taste preferences) and what price point we'd be willing to settle on.  So basically, everything was negotiable!\\n\\nWe ended up letting Tom C. do most of the ordering since he printed out their menu and did research beforehand.  We ate family-style and shared several dishes for $15 per person.  This was an excellent deal since each entree on the menu is $10 and up!  We were served a first course of soup followed by all the entrees at once.  Here's the rundown:\\n\\nFoods:\\nHalim - spicy vegetarian soup with pureed mixed vegetables and different kinds of lentils\\nChicken teek-ka - boneless white meat chicken marinated in 'Tondoori sauce'\\nBhoona maang-sho - meat stir-fried in a Korai (Bangladeshi wok) with onion, tomatoes, bell pepper\\nAloor jhol - mildly spiced meat with cubed 'aloo' (potatoes)\\nChanna begoon - garbanzo beans cooked with roasted pureed skinless eggplant\\nShaag bhaaji - chopped spinach suteed with roasted garlic cloves, onion, and other herbs and spices\\nDharosh bhaaji - sauteed okra with onion, tomatoes, and herbs.\\n\\nCondiments:\\nOnion chutney\\nAamer achaar - green mango relish\\n\\nAll the food was served with fluffy white Indian rice and naan.  Mirza described each dish and condiment to us and how they're best eaten.  He said to put the rice on our plate first and put the meats/vegetables on top, letting the rice soak up the sauces, and then eating it together with maybe chutney or mango relish on the side.  He also said the naan was good to use to soak up the sauces.  While our table was already familiar with Indian food, it was nice of him to take the time to explain.\\n\\nThe halim was a pureed vegetable soup, mildly spicy.  Good flavor and I enjoyed dipping my naan in it.  The chicken teek-ka (or \\"tikka,\\" however you prefer to spell it) was voted by our table as the favorite dish of the night.  Who doesn't like chicken tikka?\\n\\nThe bhoona maang-sho and aloor jhol were similar to me.  Both were mildly spicy meats in a brown sauce, but the bhoona maang-sho had more vegetables.  The combination of herbs and spices made these dishes somewhat aromatic.  I wasn't a huge fan of the channa begoon, but that's mainly because I'm not big on garbanzo beans.\\n\\nI had my eyes set on the shaag bhaaji as soon as it hit the table.  I love palak paneer (Indian) and this looked very similar.  We asked Mirza what kind of cheese was used in the shaag bhaaji and he said, \\"in Bangladesh, we only have one type of cheese: cheese.\\"  Ha, well it wasn't as good as palak paneer to me.  Not as creamy.  It did include a couple big chunks of what I think were the roasted garlic cloves.\\n\\nThe dharosh bhaaji may have been my personal favorite entree.  It was a simple sauteed okra and vegetables dish.  I love okra, so naturally, I enjoyed this dish.  The ingredients were tossed in various herbs.  This was also probably the lightest dish we tried.\\n\\nAs mentioned in the beginning of my review, the service was fantastic.  Napkins were folded for us, drinks and naan were kept filled, and our table was cleaned after our meal, while we stuck around to chat.\\n\\nUseful info: Panahar is BYOB with no corkage fee.  Min Y. brought a bottle of wine for some of us to share.  Thanks Min!  Also, as you can already tell from this review, this restaurant does great with large groups.  Just be sure to let them know ahead of time.\\n\\nWhen it came time to pay, we just stacked up all our credit cards and handed them to Mirza, who swiped them one-by-one at the register.  All the prices he quotes, including the ones on the menu, already include tax.  He also handed each of us 25% discount coupons for our next visit.  Jeez.

The veal itself was fine, but the sauce was overwhelmingly lemony and salty at the same time, and the side of fettuccine alfredo was no better than I could make with a box of pasta and a can of sauce. The breadsticks and salads our meals came with were okay, nothing to write home about. The cheesecake to go was eh too...kind of had a gritty texture.

The restaurant was nearly empty when we arrived, and it still took him a while to make it to us.  We asked him about a drink, and he just took the menu from my hand and read the description...which didn't answer my question.  We placed drink orders, and I was told that the beer I wanted was sold out.  I chose another beer - however, about 15 minutes later, they found some of the beer I originally wanted so they didn't bring me my 2nd choice.  It was warm.  It also took a very long time for the other members of my party to receive their drinks.  \\n\\nThe food.  My friends got the build your own burgers.  My boyfriend and I got the restaurant week food.  The salads took almost 20 minutes to arrive, and the entrees arrived about 2 minutes later.  That was really annoying, but I guess I couldn't complain because the salad wasn't really that good anyway.  My friends seemed to like their burgers, but the fries were soggy.  I got the lobster mac and cheese, and I think there were pieces of raw meat and definitely raw asparagus in it.  It was not good.  My boyfriend got the chicken and waffles but had barely any syrup when it arrived, so he flagged down our server (which took about 5 minutes...meanwhile the restaurant was still not busy) and asked for syrup.  About 5 minutes later he brought what appeared to be syrup----it was a soy sauce mixture.  My boyfriend had unknowingly poured it onto his meal, which was then ruined.  We had to flag down the server (again took a while) and instead of offering a new meal, he just took the plate.  He came up with some excuse that the kitchen had messed up, but a few minutes later he was standing behind our table with the manager and we clearly overheard him telling the manager that he had asked for the wrong sauce.  They refunded just $6 for the ruined meal...but my boyfriend didn't have dinner.  I was disappointed that the manager did not apologize or try to make the situation right.  \\n\\nDessert took another 20 minutes to arrive.  Meanwhile, all of our drinks were empty.  When dessert did arrive, I got the coffee and donuts.  The donuts tasted like crackers.  The coffee tasted like minty water.  My boyfriend said that his cheesecake was alright.  The server did not offer my friends dessert (ours came with our restaurant week meal), and after a few attempts to flag him (or any other server), they gave up on dessert.\\n\\nIt then took forever to get our checks.  Keep in mind that we arrived on MONDAY at 5pm and were not out of there until past 7:30pm---there was no reason for service to take so long.  It was not busy.

However, I found the food sub-par compared to other seafood I had while in Boston...and in general. \\n\\nThat said, it had a fun atmosphere because it was such an old building and I enjoyed the history. It fits into a trip to Boston well. So I guess you have to weigh your pros and cons. It's probably not the best meal you'll have in Boston, but it's a neat place to try out for the atmosphere.

Sometimes you have to wait outside since they cleverly have the place zone for about 12 patrons.  The seating is very limited and if you manage to get a chair, the person next to you may accidently take some of your fries. So the space kinda sucks.  The burgers I love.  I've had 2 black and blu burgers and 1 oyster burger and they've all been real, real tasty.  The oyster burger had a bit too much sauce but otherwise lovely.  Speaking of sauces, I think their house-made version of A1 they call A10 sauce is a good addition to your burger or as a dipping sauce for fries.  The house-made BBQ sauce is too sweet and I thought too runny.  Not that good.  I've had the Poutine all 3 times I've been and twice it was terrific and the last time, it was meh.  The gravy is nice thick and meaty and the cheese curds squeak against your teeth but if you're gonna pour the gravy on thick, you have to cook the fries a bit more or else if ends up a spongey mess which while still tasty isn't the desired effect.  The cafeteria-style service is also kinda ill-advised.  I see no value to not having someone serve me the food.  Especially if I want another beer, I have to wait in line again and then wait for someone to appear from the back, holler my name across the entire place and hand me a High Life.  If I want a burger in my neighborhood and have some money to spend, I'll be back.  If I want almost as good of a burger, actual service and not having to endure someone's elbow in my ear as I eat I'll go elsewhere."},{"name":"Mary Mac's Tea Room","address":"224 Ponce De Leon Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Been hearing a lot about this place in my 3 day visit to Atlanta & read great reviews, so decided to give it a try on my last day.

Our server says they're famous for the chicken & mac/cheese. Meatloaf was amazing! Dressing very good & so were the greens. I was kind of expecting a bone in chop but didn't matter. The pork was a wee bit over cooked & had no flavor. The very same for the fried chicken wing. Not even salt & pepper in at least the batter before frying. No flavor whatsoever, very disappointing. Lil season all, Lawrys, Tony Chacher's, heck, just salt & pepper goes a long way. The kicker was the mac & cheese. It was dry, again, lacked flavor & season & not even cheesy.

My normal instinct was always to avoid this place but they were smart they knew we would fall for the ol' $15 for $30 of overpriced \\"junk\\"-yard food. The burgers are thin and charred, a double is laughable. A triple would probably match an average pub burger in size (never in taste). I'm disappointed.

There will also be a highly anticipated Wegman's Food market and King's Bowling and Entertainment center along with other shops.\\n\\nThe Bancroft Steakhouse is part of the Webber Restaurant Group and focuses on farming and conservation.  Most of the produced used is grown locally in their farm in Groton, Massachusetts.\\n\\nWe arrived at The Bancroft Steakhouse just before 6 PM and were greeted by the friendly staff.  The decor of the restaurant was fun and hip with a cool urban vibe. \\n\\nIt was cool to see the bar stations where the bartenders create their masterpieces.  There were fresh garnishes and 20 bottles of different bitters.  I was very impressed!\\n\\nThe popular drink of the night seemed to be the blood orange sangria topped with champagne. \\n\\nSince it was opening week, we were able to reserve a semi-private area without any minimum requirement. \\n\\nFresh hot rolls served in a cast iron dish were brought to our table with creamy butter on the side.\\n\\nWe started off with a few different starters.  I love oysters so we split an order of the Local oyster platter with salsa verde and mignoette.\\n\\nMy favorite appetizer was the whole roasted artichoke with spiced lemon oil and charred squid.  I was a little disappointed that they didn't offer calamari but that distinguishes them from the other high end steakhouses.  Although the squid was not the main feature, it was perfectly grilled and tender.  It was the best grilled squid that I've ever had\\n\\nWe got a couple more starters to share.  I liked the prosciutto and bean dip but I could have done without the ricotta and mushroom ravioli.  The consistency of the filling reminded me of pate.\\n\\nI got the 16 oz. black angus bone in filet that was served with a cow shaped corn polenta.  Each steak entree came with a sauce or butter and I went with the bernaise.  The steak was juicy and grilled perfectly.  I got the shishito pepper \\"add-on\\" for an additional $ 4.00. \\n\\nMy friend got the sesame crusted tuna.  It was absolutely my favorite dish at the restaurant.  Typically I wouldn't order fish at a steakhouse but I think I will order it the next time I am there.  The sesame added a perfect texture to the soft sushi grade fish.\\n\\nA couple of other people at our table got the Bell and Evan chicken with swiss chard and carrot flan.  When the dish first arrived, no one knew what the carrot flan was, one person said it had the texture of mousse.\\n\\nSome people got the regular 8 oz filet with the Bancroft house steak sauce and raved about it as well. One person for the Colorado lamb chops and it looked amazing!\\n\\nEveryone LOVED their entrees! That was the first time that there was a unanimous vote of approval.\\n\\nSimilar to other high end steakhouses, sides were ordered for the table to share.  The grilled asparagus was good, the Yukon gold mash potato was OK but the creamed spinach was awesome!  The declious vegetable side dish was topped off with a sunny side up egg.\\n\\nI loved that the later two was served in individual All-Clad bake ware.\\n\\nThe rosemary french fries looked appealing so we gave it a try.  They tasted like regular fries topped with a rosemary garnish.  I was expecting hand cut fries with more peel on the potato.\\n\\nWe ordered some after dinner drinks; some of us got digestifs and the rest of us got espressos and coffee.  We were stuffed but had to try their dessert.  I was not impressed with their offerings.  The carrot cake sounded promising so we gave that a try.  Although the ginger ice cream was delicious, the sorbet and the carrot cake itself left much to be desired.\\n\\nThe chocolate cake was also underwhelming.  It was just OK.  Again, the ice cream was the best part.\\n\\nI will definitely be back again with my husband, my friends and probably be back soon.\\n\\nFor more dining room and food pics, check out\\nhttp://www.mami-eggroll.com/2014/05/the-bancroft-steakhouse-on-3rd-ave-in.html"},{"name":"The Bancroft","address":"15 Third Ave","city":"Burlington","stars":"4","text":"Nothing special here, it's fine overpriced steaks etc.  Looks like the have a nice bar with some tv's."},{"name":"Panahar - Bangladeshi Place","address":"3375 Buford Hwy NE, Ste 1060","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Holy smokes Batman!

My coworker M somehow convinced me to go grab lunch here. All was well until we spotted a woman driving the same car as his (a blue mini) on the other side of the road. We were trying to park, she was stuck in traffic. I desperately attempted to look everywhere else but whenever I snuck a quick glance, she ferociously tried to catch my eyes. I was too slow the third time and this allowed her time to smile and wave. I sunk into my seat and groaned. But M waved back, a bit too cheery for my liking. Five seconds later, she waved again and flashed her kool-aid smile. M explained later that this is a normal exchange between mini drivers on the road but at that point, I was asking myself, what the hell is wrong with these people? Is there something in the water of the suburbs that makes its inhabitants turn normal everyday living into a full blown cheese fest?

I've been to many a dive-y brunch place and never had coffee this bad before. A cardinal sin, but I had hope of redemption as the menu is full of tantalizing options. I opted for the Albina scramble.\\nSecond, the wait. Perhaps this is atypical as it was father's day, but our food took 45 minutes plus. Credit to the server who was kind and attentive throughout, but even drinks were taking a long time -- 10+ minutes for an americano, same for a mimosa.\\nThird, the food. Mixed reviews here--some members of our party were pleased with their meals; I was decidedly not. The potatoes were too dry and dominated quite a bit of the plate, and I had to ask twice for ketchup (after receiving the bland house ketchup the first time). The toast was completely plain--no butter or anything on the side, I had to ask for that too--and lukewarm at best. The scramble, which was marketed as avocado and chorizo, featured maybe 1/4 of an avocado sliced on top, and instead of the expected ground chorizo, huge pieces of room temperature sausage floating about in inconsistently cooked scrambled eggs. The runny eggs and  cold sausage did not make a good combo.\\nConsidering the multitude of brunch options available a block away, I'm not in a hurry to return to Equinox.

It starts with the crust. It's telling that their motto is \\"In Crust We Trust\\".

I also get their Greek Salad every time I visit. The veggies are always fresh and the salad dressing is great. The salad comes with garlic knots, which I find are good, but not garlicky enough for my liking. They're more like bread sticks in roll form. Still good, but not really \\"garlic\\" knots in my opinion. The ambiance is very hip and cool. It definitely fits the SoCo vibe. It's quite dark so it's great for romantic dates, but they still cater enough to families and kids (ask your wait person for pizza dough for the kids to play with!) with crayons and pictures to color. We liked the Hall & Oates coloring page. ;) They also have a cool metal ping pong table in the back next to the really cool outside seating area.

It was moist on the inside and crispy on the outside.  Next time, I might forgo the whipped butter, which added a salty taste that conflicted with the sweetness of the toast and the fruit.  Also, they did not skimp on the fruit!  I didn't get to try the omelette as i was struggling to finish my own dish, but the bf gobbled it up without a word.

You can't go wrong with a waffle and while their waffles are amazing, it still seemed over priced. However, service is excellent here and the atmosphere is beautiful.

Our table was ready for us right on time, and we sat right in front of the open kitchen, giving us a great view of the action going on there as well as throughout the dining room, which was hoppin' on a Wednesday night.  Noise levels can be a little distracting, but my friend and I could still have pretty easy conversation.   It's a great room to do some people watching.  I ordered 3 west coast oysters, which were delectable and buttery.  My friend had the smoked white fish chowder, which I tasted, and it was really delicious.  They ran out of the halibut entree I had my eye on, but substituted grouper with seared okra and baby heirloom tomatoes and a red wine demiglace.  Fish may have been slightly overcooked, but all of the flavors were amazing.  I had a side of wild mushrooms, which were rich and decadent, as well as the hushpuppies with powdered sugar and brown sugar butter, which are A MUST.  My friend had the monkfish, and it was also stellar.  The side of fried rice is an umami bomb in the best possible way - so much flavor happening.  Food is a little pricey, but the quality is definitely worth it, especially for a special occasion.\\n\\nWhen I mentioned it was my birthday to our server, he nonchalantly brought over a free drink for me, as well as a glass of wine for my friend.  The manager stopped by to wish me a happy birthday a bit later, also, and brought me ANOTHER free drink (and a free koozie that came with my beer!).  After we were stuffed full, our server surprised me with a complimentary birthday peach tart dessert with vanilla ice cream, complete with a lit birthday candle.  Thankfully, no singing!  Service could not have been better or more professional.  Our meal was borderline perfect.  I will not hesitate to come back to the Optimist in the future.

I've been here twice - once on a Tuesday (half priced wine-bam!) and once on a Friday. The size of the space leaves a lot to be desired, and the service on Friday was achingly slow. No fault of the servers or the kitchen - there were just way too few people working.\\n\\nThe food is decent-to-good. Tried the big seafood platter with a friend of mine on the half-priced-wine Tuesday, and most of it was delicious (particularly the crab). Well-priced at around $20 for the smaller portion, and easy to split as small meals for two people.\\n\\nWhen I went last night, I had the yellow fin tuna and a side of mashed potatoes. Although the lemon sauce and tuna was delicious--and very lightly seared, as I'd asked--the potatoes were almost \\"instant flakes\\" quality. Eep. And for $20, I'd expect a couple of sides or, at very least, some interesting garnishes, but it was basically as described: a plate of a piece of tuna, some lemony butter sauce, and a scoop of potatoes.\\n\\nOther than being slow for reasons outside of the staff's control, everyone who's waited on me, from the valet to the servers, has been overwhelmingly helpful and great.

The tables are close to one another so if you're looking to have a serious conversation or break someone's heart over dinner I'd suggest a different place because privacy isn't an option. I personally enjoyed it, it gave me the opportunity to view what other tables were eating and drinking. We started with the crudo and let me tell you, it was hands down the best I've had and my only complaint was it was gone too quick. We then tried the potato chips and pimento cheese which was ok nothing I couldn't do without. We opted for the whole branzino and the brick chicken along with a side of sticky Brussels sprouts. I really enjoyed the branzino BUT beware when you eat it because it's filled with tiny bones. It's almost impossible to eat but of course I made it work. I heard big things about the brick chicken and it was in fact good but not knock your socks off good. The Brussels sprouts were excellent, I would recommend those all day. We wanted to try the octopus because it's all you hear about but they were out by the time we got there. As for drinks my husband got the old fashioned which was amazing and I got the city lights which too was amazing. The only negative with my drink was the fact that it was only 1/2 full. I mean if I'm paying full price and getting 1/2 the product that's a problem. Lastly and most importantly let's talk desserts.

This flexible accommodation was the first sign of above-average service. I am not sure how to write a review that would do Andina justice. Of course, I write only of my own experience at Andina, but I am not sure how to do that experience justice, either. \\n\\nAt our seats it quickly took all of our attention to pronounce, decipher, and mind-savor all of the appetizers to entrees to desserts on that elongated menu. As a vegetarian, I asked for and received a veg/vegan menu that extracts only those VV items that are also on the regular menu. It helped relieve some of the choice-anxiety. \\n\\nWe aren't typically drinkers at dinner, so I have nothing to say about their wine pairings. However, I can never resist imbibing during a four-star meal, so I had the chicada morada. It reminded me of POM. And it was purple, so I was satisfied. Although I do wish the glass was larger. \\n \\nFor tapas, we honed in on the yuca rellena, croquets made of yuca, stuffed with mozzarella and cotija cheese, served huancaina sauce. Translation: a longitudinal-shaped fried delicacy (as if you didn't know what a croquette was), with a coating made of a south american tuber (yuca also goes by: cassava, manioc, tapioca root), and a filling of twin cheese both chewy and soft. There were two pieces, garnished with the huancaina, a creamy, mildly-spicy cheese sauce that is reminiscent of nacho cheese sauce, except  less orange and...undoubtedly, of superior quality (made with real cheese). They were promptly devoured. \\n\\nFor the main course? Obviously, I was caught in a love triangle between the (exactly) three veggie-friendly dinner entrees: the quisaya mama (a vegetable quinoa risotto), the hongos saltados (a sort of mushroom sautee with french fries and garlic rice), and the LOCRO SERRANO DE ZAPALLO ANDINO (I just copied and pasted that from the Andina website. Yea.) I had our punctilious waiter, whose lanky but not swanky presence formed the heart of our Andina experience, explain each entree to me in addition to several of the regular entrees, and he did so in exquisite detail. So much so, that I began to zone out. \\n\\nMy translation of his elaborate descriptions, I shamefacedly write, was something to the effect of: \\"now, we start this dish with a collection of finely-selected --- YUM -- basted -- locally-harvested -- YUM--from the eastern hilly regions -- YUM --- perched atop and drizzled with -- YUM -- pan-roasted to order with -- YUM -- stuffed -- YUM paired atop a bed of -- YUM laced with --\\" ... you get the idea. \\n\\nI went with the Locro Serrano. This was a generous bowl of thick butternut squash stew, chunks of cotija cheese and \\"Andean tubers\\" dotted about and encircling a cylindrical throne of garlic rice, itself which is crowned by a lightly-fried quail egg. The locro was warm, chunky, and colorful. The quail egg was rich; the rice lightly seasoned and paired well with the stew. Obviously. I savored each spoonful of my locro serrano, hearty enough for this California girl (I never appreciated soups and stews but have since moving to PDX). My locro was appreciated even more after knowing precisely what Locro Serrano meant. Ever the wanna-be polyglot, I asked and Mr.punctilious went out of his way to discover the answer for me. Locro is the dish (traditionally a pumpkin stew and there exist variations throughout different South American countries), serrano refers to the highland regions of Peru from whence this dish hails. \\n\\nWe ditched our postprandial plans to gorge on Salt and Straw ice cream in favor of the PLATO DE CREMA QUEMADA. We were presented with three bowl-ets of flavored creme brulee: vanilla bean, raspberry, and orange. Each brulee indeed possessed a unique flavor, the orange leaving the best impression on my taste buds. And that is all.

The Appetizer Platter, which consisted of Chicken Shingaara, Vegetable Shingaara and Pakoras. \\"Pakoras, pakoras, I absolutely lo-o-o-ove you\\". Very nice, great little sauces that complimented all that was on the plate.  \\n\\n2. Korma chicken: it was perfectly spiced for my chronic gastritis. For me, this was the absolute STAR of the night.

I completely agree with the description on their menu...\\"A rich traditional Bangladeshi dish, absolutely delightful.\\" Indeed.\\n\\n3. Niramish, which is an assortment of fresh vegetables mixed together. I wasn't that crazy about it even though it was good, but Rebecca was in love with it.\\n\\n4.

Delicious!\\n\\nWhen all these delights came to the table, we thought we weren't going to be able to eat all the food. Secretly, all of us were desiring some leftovers...but none were possible. We couldn't stop eating, it was all so good we even bypassed gluttony.\\n\\nYes, you can bring your wine. Yes, there were several tables with several bottles on (envy, envy). There was a girl that looked a lot like Rhonda C. I noticed when we were about to leave, and I was wearing my crocks, so that's a no-no when it comes to introductions, especially of that kind.

The most hilarious thing was that he smiled at us (like the guy on that male medicine commercial with the whistled background music), he smiled and smiled and played charming, but when he turned around he kept on barking orders to the other waiter in what I thought was bangla (I assume they were Bangladeshi...it would be logic, but who knows). Mind you, the other waiter was adorable.\\n\\nPrice wise, it was really cheap, even though they initially charged me $160 by error...it was $16 per person, can you believe that?

The service needs some serious work, There's was only one front of house staff member and she's very pleasant, but at times she's no where to be seen.

I've eaten there almost every day, and I've tried a lot of the menu. \\n\\nOverall, yes, the food has plenty of fat and salt. Yay! That's a big part of what makes a delicious, juicy burger delicious (or fries, or pretty much any of the types of foods on their menu). Some dishes:\\n\\n*The Cali Burger - the best thing I've eaten from the regular menu, and one of the only things I've ordered twice. The toppings are really well balanced and harmonious - lively, flavorful, by far the best avocado-themed burger I've ever had.\\n\\n*The Boar Burger - this was a weekly special, but so good I had it twice. I expected it to taste a bit like pork, but it really didn't. They were serving it with highly-flavored condiments - a spicy aioli and pickled onions, I think, both homemade - but it also had a succulent meaty taste. I talked with the chef about it, and he said they tried to spice up the sandwich because the boar meat didn't have much flavor, but I felt like it had loads of flavor (though of course the hot pepper and pickled onion added plenty.\\n\\n*The Blue Devil - excellent but even saltier and richer than most of the menu. I love Stilton (the British blue cheese), but I'd never had it on a burger before. Again, everything harmonized.\\n\\n*Hot Dog - very tasty. Meaty, grilled dog - really good. And they make their own relish. I don't like commercial relish, which is sweet and mushy, but this was great.\\n\\n*Fish Po Boy - the only thing I've had here that I didn't like. It just didn't all pull together like *every other sandwich*. The fish was too fishy-tasting, and the aioli was all pooled at one end of the sandwich (the last bite I ate, unfortunately, was swimming in it). I feel like it needed something else, but I'm not sure what.\\n\\n*Beet fries - YUM. loved these. The sprinkle of - I forget what herb, probably parsley - really worked well, and the fries were very light. \\n\\n*Fries with truffle oil and parmesan - this is one of their signature dishes, but wasn't my favorite. Better than most dishes with truffle oil, I'll say that. The other problem with it is that it has such a strong aroma that it can be weird if the person next to you is eating it but you're not.\\n\\nOther comments:\\n\\nThis place is clearly having a few growing pains, which seems to bother some reviewers a lot. The \\"standing only\\" bar is annoying, and I can see where beer drinkers really really need bathrooms. The service is generally friendly, but one time when I was in line the people on duty needed more time they just didn't acknowledge the people waiting at all - no, \\"Sorry, we'll be right with you\\" - which felt kind of rude. I'd also like something to drink that is non-bubbly, non-caffeinated, and non-ice cream (like lemonade). \\n\\nI guess Grass Fed also seems a little pricey to Boston reviewers, but when you use high-quality ingredients, the food is going to cost a little more. I saw one person say she'd rather go to Same Old Place or ... Doyle's, was it? That just doesn't make sense. The food is not comparable.

Second, I was definitely visiting on an \\"off night\\" and things were just not running smoothly for these folks when I was there. They seemed to be very short staffed and frazzled and this was fairly obvious from a customer perspective. They were out of napkins. We waited a while before being greeted or served. There was no music at all which made the atmosphere rather strange for some reason and we had to share our ketchup and pepper with another table.\\n\\nOn a positive note, the food was pretty good. I must praise a BBQ joint that acknowledges it's vegan/vegetarian customers. Burnt Fork offers BBQ tofu as a plate- with 2 sides, or as a sandwich with one side. I opted for the plate and ordered kale and fries as my sides. The kale was prepared like greens and was pretty tasty and the fries (which are organic and made in house) were also tasty. The BBQ tofu had a good texture and was not mushy. It would certainly hold up well on a sandwich. \\n\\nDespite the aforementioned imperfections, I would be willing to give Burnt Fork another try based on the food and the fact that the staff were all friendly even though it wasn't a flawless night for them.

We looked around and saw many of tables were empty and there really was no reason for anyone to be waiting at the door. We waited over 30 minutes to be seated at a table that was empty before we'd even walked in. When we finally had a server come over to us she had an attitude and quite rude , she took our orders and scurried off to do something else , our food came really quickly and dinner was fine until my boyfriend realized that his burger wasn't cooked all the way through. Luckily, they took it back without question and cooked it fully in what seemed like 5 mins. If you're in the area looking for somewhere to eat try Boston Pizza or Browns Social House across the street instead.

I didn't really care that much though because everyone was just so nice. When the bill came, the French onion soup wasn't on the bill. The lady sitting at the table next to us looked at me and said \\"you're welcome!\\" and I said \\"for what?\\" She then told me \\"French onion soup should never taste like that. It was burned.\\" I replied \\"whatever, I didn't really care that much because everything else was fantastic - but thanks!\\" So, I thought that was nice of them for acknowledging that there was something wrong with it and not charging us vs. us having to say something (although with everything else being as amazing as it was, I wouldn't dare complain).  I only had one glass of wine, but right before we left, I managed to knock the glass over and shatter it while it was still in my hands. The table next to us freaked out and kept asking me if I was hurt or cut. I tossed all the glass on the table and kept inspecting my hands wondering where I was cut. After all how could I not be cut shattering a glass in my hands? Alas, I cut through a nail - that was my only damage. Everyone was shocked and amazed. As I said, I was getting up to leave when this happened, so the server ran over and said, please just leave this and I'll take care of it.

Our server was Nick, who was very friendly and went out of his way to make our night enjoyable. He walked us through the daily specials and took the time to point out some new offerings on the menu. We were hooked by his enthusiasm for the fried ravioli that was the appetizer special. (He had just sampled it prior to opening,) I ordered the Lobster capellini, which was a new menu item and hubby went for the the linguine with clams.\\n\\nThe app arrived, it was a tower of crusted ravioli in a delicious red pepper, onion and tomato sauce with capers. The vibrant flavors of the sauce complimented the cheese filled ravioli. (pic) I should note, that the ravioli were crispy and not the least bit oily. We would order this starter again and hope it's available on our next visit. \\n\\nMy lobster capellini was delicious, the sauce was reminiscent of a vodka sauce, there was a slight creaminess to the tomato sauce. It was delish; nicely appointed with garlic, shaved parm and succulent Maine lobster claws. (pic) The capellini was cooked perfectly. Hubby was thrilled with his linguine, I sampled a bite of his and the pasta was once again, tasty and filled with fresh tender clams and garlic. (pic) There was a slight bit of heat from the red chili's this go around that we both loved. After the hubby sampled my capellini, we couldn't decide which we entree liked better and may just have to order and split them in the future, as they both were so flavorful and yummy!\\n\\nWe did miss the amazing garlic bread this visit. They've changed their bread basket to fresh kalamata olive bread and also sundried tomato bread with a small dish of cumin spiced eggplant spread.

At the end of the meal, he brought a Birthday cheesecake slice out to the hubby. (pic) While NY style, this was a lighter and creamy cheesecake- not too dense and thick. Hubby was very happy, and completely stuffed. On our way out, we bumped into friends who were on their way to Nick's. We recommended our meals and our server, Nick.

I didn't like the night time dessert menu. The chocolate cake was too dense and not chocolatey enough. The cheesecake had a rubbery texture and a cloying blandness to it that is like how I imagine shortening to taste, if it were eaten by itself.

My fingers were clearly straight up from my palms so that I didn't leave fingerprints OR place my fingers in the water. From behind me, a bartender yelled across the restaurant, \\"DON'T put your hands in the tank! Don't put your hands in the tank...mumble mumble...(to another customer) so hands on...\\" \\n\\nLet me be clear. I know there are people who would come into this restaurant and, without hesitation, try to touch or pick up a lobster.

None of the employees were rude (save angry lobster tank bartender), but they all seemed rather frustrated to be there at all. That is except for our actual bartender (a brunette, bearded gentleman) who was very kind, attentive, and quick. (We ordered cocktails and clam chowder at the bar during our wait for a table.)\\n\\nFor dinner, I ordered the Broiled Seafood Platter and my husband order the Shrimp Ravioli. We had the garlic mussels as an appetizer. The mussels were great. And my husband really enjoyed the ravioli. But my seafood platter, which had salmon, swordfish, another unspecified fish, shrimp, and scallops, was extremely overlooked. The shrimp was fine. As was the unspecified fish. But the salmon, swordfish, and scallops were difficult to cut , flavorless, and had a texture similar to dry chicken. If you've ever had these items (cooked well) before, you know this is far from how they're supposed to taste. It was also clear to me that no seasoning was used at all - even salt or pepper. The unspecified fish, scallops, and shrimp were all under a flavorless bedding of breeding, too, which was strange. I had to dig through the breeding to distinguish what was fish, what was scallop, and what was shrimp.\\n\\nI did send the dish back, which is the first time I've ever done that. And I felt horrible, but I was so disappointed. I asked my server to bring me just a bowl of clam chowder and she did. (The chowder is great!) My servers were very nice about me sending the plate back, and graciously did not charge us for it.\\n\\nOverall, I was pretty disappointed, especially since I had heard such good things."},{"name":"Poor Calvin's","address":"510 Piedmont Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4.5","text":"I've been to countless Thai restaurants all over the country because I can never get enough curry and I was looking forward to trying Poor Calvins to see how it compares to some of my favourites. Granted, the name doesn't scream Thai, but holy cow the curry dish does! I'm not saying it's an actual Thai restaurant, but I am saying it is amazing on all levels. The interior is beautiful and unified. It's very intimate, warm and trendy. There's so much visual interest (without being overwhelming), and the service was exceptional. \\n\\nThe lobster mac and cheese was insanely good. I had about 1/3 of it and had the waitress wrap it up for me so I would have room for curry! It was, hands down, the best curry I've ever had. The fried fish was a nice change from the usual shrimp or duck. It wasn't too spicy but the layer of amazing flavours made up for any spice I, otherwise, would have missed. It had a slight kick so I don't think anyone would be disappointed. I can say with high certainty that anything you order from the menu will exceed your expectations.

Those two flavors just did not go well together.  I also got the clam chowder which was  very good and on par with legal seafood.   \\n\\nThe steak was also not cooked to order.  After the waitress took our order, I asked for it to be medium well and she told me that they do not cook it to order.   At first I thouhgt it was strange but when I got the food I could see why.  It was more of a shaved meat.   It would have been nice if it was a nice piece of sirloin or rib eye that I could have to my liking. \\n\\nI think I will have to try it again to have a better sense.

My first thought was \\"great, polenta!\\" and then I tasted it.  We had no idea what it was until we asked our server.  WHY???  My chicken would have been great, but for this soupy, tasteless, goop.  The cauliflower gratin was soupy cheese and just unappetizing.  The desserts were down right weird - black pepper marshmallows just seems to be trying too hard. \\n\\nI will go back after a few months to see if their menu has changed.

The first thing you notice is that this place is much cleaner and presentable than your typical Pho places around time.  You know what I am talking about.. the dingy seedy interiors with decor that looks like you went into a time machine and landed in the 80's, tables that are sticky, with a pencil holder full of chopsticks and stacks of plastic spoons on the table.\\nIf that type of environment turns you off but you still want to enjoy a great Vietnamese restaurant, then Broken Rice is the perfect place to go.  The interior is very clean and presentable.  I actually felt very comfortable in this environment.\\nWhen I was handed the menus (place is so new, the menus are still printed on regular 8*11 paper!), I noticed that this place is also fully licensed and offers wine and beers.  Though I didn't order any, the beer prices are very reasonable and start at $3!  Heck of a deal if you would like to drink with your meal.\\nI ordered Uncle Hing's Chicken Wings (tamarind) and the Savory Crepe.  Both were very well made.  The chicken wings do take some time so if you decided you want them, order them right away before you order your meal to get it started.  They take the wings seriously and take the extra time to make it crispy.  The savory crepe was very well made - it came with fresh greens and herbs with a rice flour based crepe wrapped with sprouts, shrimp and an assortment of things that I don't quite remember.\\nI have subsequently went again to try the spring rolls and the house pho.  Again, both dishes were very delicious.  The spring rolls were perfectly fried and lacked that heavy greasy feeling that I usually get at other Pho places.  The Pho was also delicious.  The broth had a bit of home made taste to it and seem to taste a lot cleaner - likely a lot less MSG.\\nOverall, I think this new place is a solid choice and is a great addition to the Burnaby Heights menagerie of restaurants.

My husband thought the Mexican hot chocolate was the best donut he'd ever had - he loved the chili powder mixed in with the chocolate.  I'm allergic to chocolate so I had to settle for the more Caucasian donuts...the Mango Tango was delicious and the Viscous Hibiscus was creative although the flavour of the hibiscus wasn't very noticeable.  The pastry of every donut I had was light and not greasy or oversweet.  On our way out of town we picked up 2 boxes of a dozen each to take to our respective offices, and also had a Grape Ape and a peach fritter on the way to the airport.

The fried fish sami and hamburgers were unacceptable and tasted comparable to the food in the frozen food aisle at the grocery store. \\n\\nPersonally, if you ask me, this place has made me lose hope for the future of restaurants in Austin. If this is what the community is raving about, Austin is doomed. Maybe i should start to learn how to cook. \\n\\nTl;dr: Cool restaurant, ok food, overpriced and not worth taking your family to.

We wanted a booth. She said no. We moved on. Well, that was LAST year. \\n\\nToday, we were shopping at Mitchell Gold and asked for a lunch recommendation. The sales people at MGBW lit up about Andina. Well, this time it clicked for us. The hostess was very friendly and accommodating. We got our booth, got an attentive waiter, and got good food and drink.\\n\\nOur favorite small plate was the Pimiento Piquillo Relleno, which is piquillo peppers stuffed with cheese, quinoa and Serrano ham. Another delicacy is the Conchas a la Parilla, which is grilled scallops with a garlic lime butter sauce and crispy onions -- very buttery and delectable. Causa Morada was also tasty. It's mashed purple potatoes, infused with key lime juice and pressed into a cake with smoked chicken salad.\\n\\nIf you want a cocktail that's different than most any you have tried, order a Sacsayhuaman (sexy woman?), a habanero pepper vodka shaken with pureed passion fruit and cane sugar, served up with a sugar rim and a cilantro leaf garnish. It's not for everyone, but it's definitely for me. The flavor is a zinger. Our sales ladies at Mitchell Gold just about had o-gasms describing this drink. How could we not try it. Does the drink name really translate to sexy woman in Peru? That's what we were told.\\n\\nSo, how did a great Peruvian restaurant find it's way to the pearly white Pearl District? I don't know. Then again, I'm not sure how so many Japanese found their way to Peru. Perhaps we can meet up at Andina and discuss it over a Sacsayhuaman.\\n\\nWord of caution to those looking for cheap and massive American-sized portions -- this is not your place. Andina serves top-quality small portions, artfully presented -- much like Spanish tapas. \\n\\nI can't wait to take out-of-town guests to try Andina. This restaurant is worthy of its reputation.

I went to dinner at J. Liu's in Worthington last night. I don't eat out often, but I've been there a few times before; most recently about six of seven months ago. Although I've never been disappointed, Saturday things felt a bit off.\\nIt started with a waitress without a sense of humor. I'm not a professional comedian, but I've been told several times by many people that I'm a pretty funny guy. As she was taking our drink orders, two jokes flew over her head like clay targets out of cage at a trap and skeet shooting range.\\nI put myself through college as a bartender. It was a great way to get gas in my car and chicks in the back seat . I was feeling tropical, so I ordered a zombie. \\nShe left, and came back to tell me the bartender doesn't have three ingredients to make a zombie. Now, I know there are many variations of this drink, but the basic recipe is as follows:\\n1 oz. white rum\\n1 oz. golden rum\\n1 oz. dark rum\\n1 oz. brandy \\nPineapple juice and orange juice.\\nShake it like Elvis Presley shook his hips, and pour it into a tall highball glass. \\nTrickle in a dash of grenadine, and float a  1/2 ounce of 151-proof rum on top. \\nGarnish with whatever, stick a straw in it and serve. \\nThis drink has 4.5 ounces of alcohol in it. It's a kick-ass drink and it's delicious. But check out the ingredients. Nothing fancy. They're common ingredients found at any full-service bar. I'm puzzled about what three ingredients they didn't have. (I think the bartender didn't know how to make it.)\\nFor food, I ordered fried calamari for an appetizer, and Chicken Milanese for my entr√©e. I don't know if they hired a different cook since the last time I was there, but the food lacked the J. Liu zing I'm used to. It was OK. Just OK. The next time I go out to eat, J.

The service was slow, and inattentive,  we waited 30 minutes for water, while a little hungover, which is bad. And with only ten or so tables, two people should be able to handle it. When we finally got the food it was mediocre alone, and just shameful for the prices. \\n\\nI'm of the mind that a piece of meat on a piece of bread shouldn't cost 10 bucks, I would have gladly paid 3.99 for the small open faced sandwich with no sides, and probably would have been able to look past the skinny jean wearing, bad haircut and too much facial hair having hipsters who seem to love the place strictly because the close quarters inside make it perfect for forcing others to listen to their stories of France, and the newest obscure band that they love for the day. \\n\\nOh, and frittata is usually warm, preferably not over salted, also the bottom shouldn't be black. \\n\\nAnd when we told the waitress that our food wasn't satisfactory, she didn't offer to make good, just seemed to take offense, and let us know that they don't hear that very often, which i found hard to believe, then didn't speak to us again until she brought the check. By the way putting the check on a plate with a rock doesn't make it any easier to swallow. \\n\\nSixty bucks and and hour and a half later me and my 3 friends took the food we had paid for but hadn't eaten home and doctored it with cheese, seasonings, and care for the finished product, then it was edible. \\n\\nI'll say that if you care only about where you're being seen, in other words if you're a person who just goes out to say that they've been to the 'in' place for the week, and you don't really care about the food or service then you may very well love the Blue Dahlia. \\n\\nI personally would rather spend a Sunday morning in a place where people aren't so smug, and where I fill up on brunch and don't file out.\\n\\nI might be wiling to check this place out again, but only on a day when the place is empty and there can be no excuses for why a soft boiled egg\\ntakes 15 minutes.

The Optomist is lively and I must say a little loud.  We ordered cocktails and oysters to start.  The oysters arrived but they did not bring the correct number.  They were OK nothing special.  Also ordered the octopus, the server recommended the version that is served outside at the oyster bar.  It was SO tender! Outstanding, the best I have ever had.  The cocktails took quite a while to arrive.  They just seemed so busy.  That being said our server seemed to be rushing us. Next we ordered shrimp toast and a New England shrimp roll.  The shrimp toast was flavorful with some fresh pickled items.  The roll was not good.  Nothing New England about it other than the bun.\\nWe decided to split the duck fat poached swordfish and short rib.  The dish was good although it did now wow me as something really special like the octopus did.  It was a good idea for surf and turf.\\nAll in all I enjoyed my first trip a couple years ago to the Optomist better.  On that trip we sat at the oyster bar and hour waiting on a table inside.  There are items and drinks that you can only get there such as the punch.  It is open air and usually has entertainment.  I also do not remember the inside being so loud. I am talking about the music and people.  The dining scene on the Westside has gotten very trendy and hip. I am sure the Optomist has got to keep up.

The drinks were fantastic - I had the Taste of Bekaa and the Sultan's Elixir. Since I was there for a bellydance show and there was a packed room, I was impressed that she got all the food and drink orders correct, and I didn't mind the spacing out of the food since I was there to see a three hour show.  Also, she acknowledged that the food was taking a while to come out of the kitchen - and that acknowledgement is always nice.  \\n\\nThe band for these sunday  night dance shows is fantastic and the restaurant is a beautiful venue.

Starting off with walking up and down Mississippi. So I looked up good places near Mississippi for brunch, and that's how I stumbled onto Equinox. \\n\\nSolid reviews, a Yelp coupon that cost $10 but gave us $20 credit, AND online reservations (brunch is a big thing in Portland, so you never know if you'll be standing in a line) made this really a no-brainer to try. And I'm glad I did. \\n\\nThe service was prompt and courteous without being overbearing and checking on us every 5 minutes. Coffee was delicious (I drink my coffee BLACK). \\n\\nFood was very good, and I tried the biscuits and gravy. The gravy definitely had some type of different spin on it, so that was a nice surprise as it wasn't just \\"regular\\" country gravy like something you'd get at your average diner. Biscuits were a tad overdone, but still quite good! \\n\\nGirlfriend had the Equinox Bowl, which is a combination of all kinds of good things for breakfast. She enjoyed it as it was a nice mixture of flavors together. \\n\\nFood was just the right portion for when you've got things to do and see and don't want to enter a food coma. You leave full but not stuffed. I didn't have any leftovers, but my GF had a small box to take with her. \\n\\nAfter using my $20 coupon, the end tab for two meals and two coffees was $1.50. I tipped $6, so overall we only spent a grand total of $17.50 including tip for everything. WHAT...A...DEAL.

This is the original Voodoo Doughnut shop before they opened up the other location on NE Davis St.  \\n\\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz/voodoo-doughnut-too-portland#hrid:1oK1Tkx0OcdIAS26ldop8w\\n\\nAfter having my first cock and ball...*ahem* doughnut, I had to have it again.  \\n\\nWe decided to try out this location.  This location has outside seating versus the other location with indoor seating.  Street parking only other location has its only parking lot.\\n\\nSo this time we got my cock and balls and the voodoo doll with a pretzel stabbed to its heart.  The cock and balls actually had some cream filling in the shaft.  Oh ya my mouth was all over that bad boy.  Creamy goodness!!  The voodoo doll had a raspberry jelly inside...I'm guessing that's to mimic blood and guts.\\n\\nSo a little history for all of you if you don't know this yet.  The creators of voodoo doughnut created most of their doughnuts due to exhaustion and a hangover.  The cereal and doughnut and the maple bar with bacon was developed to due exhaustion and wanting to create a breakfast in one.  \\n\\nThe popular \\"pink doughnut\\" which was a pink doughnut dipped in Pepto and sprinkled with Tums was created for the drunk night crawlers needing something to go into their stomach.  Heck when you're that drunk, you're bound to try anything.  Hence the term \\"good things come in pink boxes\\"\\n\\nNow you're wondering what it means by \\"the magic is in the hole\\"? We'll that started because they decided to sell a Nyquil doughnut drizzled with Nyquil and a shot of Nyquil in the center.  Sorry folks FDA got a hold of that and quickly shut that bad boy down.\\n\\nI'm sure you are aware the man on the cover is a Voodoo Priest, and if you're a diehard Voodoo fan he can actually perform a wedding ceremony for you.\\n\\nSo there you have it...Voodoo doughnuts knows how to market their doughnuts (plus it really taste good).  There are 4 things society is aDICKted too...sex, caffeine, alcohol and drugs.  They've tried all of this once in their career and made it successful.  The cock and balls that retails for $5+ is basically two cream filled bars shaped in an interesting way and as a result they've sold millions."},{"name":"Kingmakers","address":"","city":"Columbus","stars":"4.5","text":"We had a double date here and had a terrific time.

Look on their website for the real number. Once I sorted that and got my reservation everything seemed promising. They were helpful because I had to changed the number of people twice. We got there at 8pm and were seated. The waiter came to ask for drinks but we weren't in the mind set yet because people were still trickling in and we were chatting (this was our mistake). From this point on, I guess the restaurant got busy because service dropped. \\n\\nOne person didn't get there drink. We had to ask for bread. And it was 9pm before we ordered our actual food. Seriously, it took an hour to order food. \\n\\nI didn't note the time it took for the food to come out, but it was a while.\\n\\nLike I said, in the short version, the food was amazing. It had decent portions where it just enough food (but sucks if you want leftovers). The only downside to the food - one person got the \\"pasta diablo\\" which was beyond spicy. She even asked the waiter how spicy it was and he said, \\"a little.\\" It was not. It was a lot. She returned it and got the Fettucine Alfredo without issue though.\\n\\nThe other stick in the mud was that they included a 20% tip because we were a large party. I was rather put off by this. I feel like 18% is customary in a large group situation - 20% seems a lot. Plus, I did not want to tip that much. It literally took 2 hours and 40 minutes for dinner. I like my friends, but 2 hours would have been acceptable. And to top it off, there was an issue with the 20% where one person was charged well over that. She was charged $7 off a $19 bill. That was luckily sorted for her.\\n\\nLastly, while the women's bathroom was fine, the men's bathroom didn't have a lock. It was just a one person. So the guys kept getting walked in on. We started sending guards for the door when the gentlemen had to use the facilities. \\n\\nI really wanted to like this place. I loved the food, but I was let down by the service."},{"name":"Duck's Kitchen","address":"111 New St, Ste D","city":"Decatur","stars":"4","text":"Best overall lunch spot in town.

Each lunch plate came with a choice of soup or salad, so we got one of each. Both the miso soup and the ginger dressing were fantastic, not too heavy or sweet. All of the sashimi was fresh, light, and had the perfect flavor. The salmon in particular was buttery and flavorful, and I don't think I've had salmon sashimi as good as that in quite a while.

The guy who working the register was short and terse with me despite my really short order.

So at least I wasn't being discriminated against but I noticed that this is a problem, more so since it's food service and I imagine they want tips -- if the food isn't redeeming, the customer service should somehow make up for it. The place wasn't busy so I couldn't quite figure out why they were pressuring customers into putting in their orders as soon as they put a foot through the door.\\n\\nLong story short, the food was unimpressive and I somehow left hungrier than I initially was. The burger was pretty bland, even after I doused it in bbq sauce and it fell apart as soon as I picked it up. I'm not really sure what is in the veggie burgers but the recipe should probably be revised.\\n\\nThe fries were soggy and bland as well. Not worth the $4.50 I paid for them at all. I also doused those in bbq sauce but, for the record, I've eaten stale carnival fries that are better. You can't put truffle oil on crap and expect it to taste good.\\n\\nAnyway, 2 stars for now.

Roast Chief went up 50 cents to $6.99, Chicken Bacon Ranch 30c to $7.29, Veggie Melt 50c to $5.99.  3 price changes in ~1.5 years.  My $5 lunch has crept up.\\n\\n*** 10/2014 ***\\n\\nThe Cheeseboy version of Thanksgiving in a sandwich - the Gobbler ($5.29/$7.59) - is back!\\n\\nSo I decided to get on over there for one.  Seasoned stuffing, tender chicken, melty cheese, and sweet fruity globs of cranberry sauce between toasted bread - yum!\\n\\n*** 10/28/2014 ***\\n\\nLooks like the change in concept made its way outside as evidenced by the new signage I noticed today.  No idea if the sign was slow in coming, or if I was just slow in noticing it.\\n\\nNo longer \\"Cheeseboy - Sandwich Meltery\\" it is now \\"Cheeseboy - Comfort Kitchen.\\"\\n\\n*** 11/2014 ***\\n\\nThe Build-Your-Own option I loved when they first opened is no longer being advertised.  And no wonder, since instead of the set price for an up to 4 veggie topping cheese sandwich with a dollar surcharge for an added meat totaling $5.49, they now charge per added topping.  So my test sandwich with turkey and cranberry sauce already surpassed $7, and I hadn't even named any veggies yet!  I wasn't sure what the current base price was, but it was a 50 cent charge for the sauce, and I think she told me it would be $1.50 for bacon.\\n\\nSo you can have it your way, but they'll make you pay for it.\\n\\n*** 12/2014 ***\\n\\nSadness - the Gobbler flew the coop before I had the chance to have just one more before its season ended at November month end.\\n\\nI finally decided to ask about possible alternative potato chip flavors since I don't actually like any of the ones they keep in stock... and was told that most people like them.\\n\\nAfter reviewing my photos, I realize I miss the Sun Chips.  I then checked out the Deep River Snacks roster of potato chips, and I wouldn't mind trying the Sweet Maui Onion, Mesquite BBQ, or Salt & Cracked Pepper as an alternative to the flavors they currently keep in stock.\\n\\n*** 1/2015 ***\\n\\nForget chips.  Got the soup instead - tomato.  Yum.  Veggie Melt yummy too, but given that it is winter, it wasn't a surprise that the tomato was more pink than red.\\n\\n*** 3/2015 ***\\n\\nHappy happy with my turkey turkey!\\n\\nMade my own for $8.74 with 5 veggie selections.  I think it was $2 for the turkey and 50 cents per topping, but don't quote me on that.\\n\\nPS - checked out the salads.  They look pretty good.  The small containers are deeper than the large, so for a higher topping ratio, I say go for the large.\\n\\n*** 5/2015 ***\\n\\nSo another way to order a turkey and vegetable melt is to take their Veggie Melt $5.99 and to add turkey for 2 bucks for a total of $7.99, or $8.55 after tax.  I also tried their new offering, the grass-fed Sirloin Steak Melt $5.99/$7.99 grass-fed sirloin steak, Muenster cheese, roasted red peppers, red onion, and Kickin' Bayou sauce on artisan white.  Yup, there's a kick in that sauce, but they gave me the option to have it on the side, which I was glad to have accepted.\\n\\n*** 8/2015 ***\\n\\nTheir new pork sandwich sounded great!  Fire-Braised Pulled Pork Melt ~ all natural premium pulled pork with aged cheddar, roasted red peppers, red onion, bacon jam, bbq sauce and mayo on artisan white $6.29/$8.29\\n\\nAnd it was good!  Even after I swapped out the onion for tomato and spinach.\\n\\nI'm also looking forward to trying their new Smores Melt dessert sometime... ($4.29)\\n\\n*** 8/10/2015 ***\\n\\nA new breakfast menu is now available - ALL DAY!\\n\\nThey handed me an invitation to enjoy a free breakfast, so I'll report back!"},{"name":"La Brasserie","address":"1091 Davie Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4","text":"Four stars for the quaint french ambience and pleasant customer service. \\n\\nThree stars for the breakfast poutine for a lazy Saturday brunch.

The outside looks somewhat nondescript off of Ponce, but entering is like walking into a genuine feeling southern home.  Moulding on the walls with framed photographs adorned all over the place, it radiates a homey southern hospitality, and if that doesn't work for you, the polite and friendly employees usually drive it home.\\n\\nThe parking is behind the building and they have a limited number of their own spots, relegating some to use the side street (Myrtle), which is unfortunately paid parking.  Or, if you're walking down Peachtree or Piedmont and tired of the same old cliche hip and modern McDouchetrants, it's not a terrible walk down Ponce to go back in time to a different period where people were still polite.\\n\\nThe dining areas of the rest of the establishment are warm and welcoming, with all of the rooms having that homey feeling.  Everyone who works there is very polite, very proper, well-spoken and friendly.  They are also very attentive, rarely let a drink go empty, and never give off that vibe of hating your guts when you ask to separate checks.\\n\\nI have never gotten bad service at Mary Mac's before.\\n\\nThe menu is full of traditional southern entrees from fried chicken, meatloaf, catfish to pork chops.  The portions are well, southern, meaning they're large, hearty and filling.  There is no reason anyone should ever leave Mary Mac's unfulfilled, because a combination of a dinner platter along with their hearty baked goods from cornbread, rolls and their famous cinnamon rolls will easily finish the job.\\n\\nThe quality is all excellent, and can't recall if there's ever been something I didn't care for.  The closest would maybe be that the smothered chicken had bones I wasn't expecting in it, but that's more my issue for not actually seeing the word \\"boneless\\" in the description anywhere.\\n\\nSurprisingly, for the quality and the quantity of food you get with your meal, the prices are reasonably positive.  You certainly get your money's worth for what you pay for.\\n\\nBottom line, this is about as easy five-star as they come.

We had reservations so we didn't wait long but just long enough to get a drink at the bar. The interior of the building is beautifully done. After 20 mins we were seated. It took a while for a waiter to greet us but hey it was extremely busy so I was trying to give the waiter the benefit of the doubt. We ordered the calamari which was great! Our waiter was not very attentive we had  eaten the calamari prior to even ordering our entrees. I wanted to order the burger and as soon as I said that he so rudely yelled \\"No, you can not have that!\\" and chuckled to the point where the two couples surrounding our table had looked over. At first I wasn't sure if he was being funny or what then he proceeded to say \\"we ran out\\". Ok so I order the Mongolian beef noodle stirfry which the waiter then questioned me and said \\"It's very very spicy can you handle it?\\" (It was not spicy at all by the way) and my boyfriend orders the lamb steak and we get a side of the Mac and cheese. Both meals were mediocre. The waiter came back he did not offer dessert I had to request the menu.

It should have been called whip cream Sunday because there was hardly any ice cream. $100 later for a nice dinner we were extremely dissatisfied with the food and service. We were there for about 2 hours. We had to find our waiter multiple times. At one point he even forgot to bring me the dessert menu and saw me and turned around to get it.

We had early 6pm reservations and called the reservationist to tell her we were running 10 min late. She advised that tables can only be held for 15 min. So, we basically rushed to get there only to find that the restaurant was only 1/4 full, at best. Next, they proceeded to seat us at the back of the restaurant. When we asked to be seated elsewhere (since the restaurant was basically empty anyway), instead of trying to see if she could accomodate us, the hostess tried to convince us that we didn't need to be moved. Although the place looks sophisticated and the food plated beautifully, I was disappointed with my appetizer and entree.  I always heard how awesome the south is with their bbq's and tried the ribs for appetizer. They were mediocre at best... seemed like the sauce was just brushed on last min... the flavor was definitely not infused into the meat. The entree was slighlty better (but was definitely forgetul since I can only recall that it was somekind of fish). The dessert, I will admit, was delicous. If you must visit the restaurant, go for dessert only- I ordered the choc bread pudding and my friend had the peach upside down cake and both were simply awesome. Out of my entire experience, I must say that the aspect that bothered me the most was the rushed service. By 7pm, the restaurant definitely started to get crowded, and it seemed that they were rushing us so that they could quickly turn the tables over. A soon as the waiter took our menus away, our apptz were already at our tables! We barely finished our apptz before they were quickly taken away and replaced by our entree. We tried to eat very slow after that, but even still- our dessert came within the hour. I have never felt so rushed in all my dining experiences. We literally had out apptz through dessert all served in less than an hour! Nevertheless, coming from NYC, I wholeheartedly believe in tipping the waitstaff at least 20%- and since he was cordial the entire evening and was probably only following management orders for quick table turnovers, we still tipped him 25%... but this is definitely not a place I would recommend."},{"name":"Marathon Taverna","address":"1735 W Burnside St","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"I've been to Marathon a few times now.

We each had two drinks each - I had the Berry Bubbly martin - really tasty, and the Belvedere Cosmopolitan - good, not as good as my first drink, though.  We also split  the calamari - we had originally ordered one plate, and it was so good, we ordered another - so tender, and the sauce was perfection.

Was it worth it?  I'm still not sure.  At least the company was great, because I met up with some awesome Yelpers for a UYE.\\n\\nGrindhouse is a cool place - I totally dig the scene.  There was some old vampire movie projected on the wall next to the bar and the TVs on the patio were displaying some good ol' campy Burt Ward / Adam West Batman.  This place definitely has its own unique look and feel and it seems to fit the burger-and-brews menu appropriately.\\n\\nI ordered a double beef burger, Dixie Style ($8 with pimento cheese, fried green tomato, carolina cole slaw, chipotle ranch).  On the side I got a basket of onion rings ($2.50) and a boozy shake ($8.50).  Yeah the price tag on those shakes is steep.  But it was also the highlight of the meal.  I opted for the El Duderino, which is essentially a White Russian in shake form.  It pays homage to the greatest movie of all time, The Big Lebowski, and it tastes f'ing fantastic.  Just tell your friends to be careful, man; there's a beverage here!\\n\\nThe burger was scrumptious, although somehow the fried green tomato got completely lost among all of the other condiments and the beef patties.  It was difficult to locate, much less taste.  The chipotle ranch sauce had a nice flavor though, and the pimento cheese was drool-worthy, so I'm not really complaining.  The onion rings were appropriately crispy and they tasted like you'd probably expect.\\n\\nI enjoyed my meal at Grindhouse but ultimately, I felt like it was overpriced by at least $5 or more.  Yes, the milkshake had booze in it and tasted just like a good caucasian should, dude.  And yes, the burger and rings were well cooked and tasty.  But still, it's hard to justify dropping that kind of coin on a gutbomb dinner.\\n\\nIf I'm ever with a group that wants to eat at Grindhouse, I won't hesitate to return.  But I doubt I'll seek this place out again on my own.  There are too many other great burger options in ATL where I know I'll get a delicious meal and pay far less."},{"name":"Armando's Pizzeria","address":"463 W New England Ave","city":"Winter Park","stars":"3.5","text":"Love this place dined here for the first time the other evening!

Portions are small and not filling, even for a lightweight like me. The seared rare tuna was neither rare enough nor tasty enough. I have never had a restaurant mess up rare tuna since a good tuna tastes delicious with minor seasoning. However the rare tuna here was underwhelming and lacked flavor. I also thought the scallops tasted too fishy-- it was not an enjoyable taste. The duck fat swordfish was also just okay. The fish and chips were pretty good, though you are paying $18 for pub food.

Though these flavors were unique and tasty in and of itself, it didn't pair very well with my breads and probably would not get it next time.\\n\\n- Tortilla de papa this dish was highly recommended by a friend for the flaky, but soft frittata. Though the texture was good, the flavor was lacking and I was quite disappointed.\\n\\n- Chicharones de langostinos was one of the better dishes. Normally I'm not a fan of quinoa, but they made it perfectly and so well seasoned I wanted more. The shrimp was cooked perfectly and married so well with everything on the plate. This is a must try if you like shrimp.\\n\\n- De Pulpo now this is the highlight of our meal and I feel like their signature dish. Normally I would have never eaten octopus as I'm not very adventurous with certain foods. I am so glad my husband insisted we tried it. I thought it would be a rubbery chewy mess, but this is far from it. The texture and flavors were so good I would have never thought I was eating octopus. This is a MUST EAT when coming here especially with their chimichuri sauce, yum!!\\n\\nFor the mains we tried:\\n- Seco a la nortena which our server recommended as a classic dish. Sadly, we are not fans of this classic lamb dish. The meat was a bit too soft for me and the flavors were not working. All I got was soft bland meat sadly :(\\n\\n- Arroz con pato which we were really excited about because we are all about good duck dishes. The duck was cooked well, the rice was on point and well flavored, but the yellow  sauce was too sweet for me and did not work well with the dish.\\n\\nAfter eating these two entrees, I wish I would have ordered the lomo saltado because I think that would have been a better choice. \\n\\nFinishing off the night with this Peruvian cookie which was ok. It was a bit sweet, but the flakiness of the cookie was quite nice.\\n\\nOverall, I think that they had way better tapas compared to the entrees.

I have only been to the Inman Park location a couple of times since (1) it's nowhere near where I work (for weekdays) and (2) I don't generally have two hours to kill before brunching on Saturdays and Sundays. The menu at the Midtown outpost is a limited version of the original (notably missing my fave, the corn cilantro pancakes), but it still has popular favorites like sweet potato pancakes, peanut butter stuffed French toast, curried chicken salad sandwich, and white bean chicken chili. Seating inside the restaurant is cozy but limited, but there are plenty of tables and chairs set up inside the lobby of the King & Spalding building (don't worry, BigLaw lawyers don't bite - usually).\\n\\nCounter culture coffee is mmmmm delicious (and fills the hole left in my caffeine-craving heart when Noon stopped serving weekday breakfast - sob!) and the bakery cases are always filled with delicious goodies including croissants, tartlets, biscotti, and - my personal favorite - fabulous little mini-cupcakes in flavors like red velvet, Oreo, raspberry, and lemon. There are even tiny little single-serving boxes to take one to go for a mid-afternoon snack.

The location is kind of tucked away, but the industrial setting makes it all the more fun. Dare I say, urban? \\n\\nI came with a small group so we shared apps and entrees. \\n\\nBacon - everybody loves bacon. These two strips were cut a little thicker and topped with pickled okra and peppercorns, but also served with some kind of honey dijon mustard. The bacon's delish without the sauce, but in the end, it's only good because it's thick like the pork belly slices at Korean BBQ. It only made me wish we had gone to a Korean BBQ place. \\n\\nScallop ceviche - I mistakenly thought it was mozzarella in some kind of balsamic/pesto sauce because that's what the scallops looked like. Plus, they were so tender just like mozzarella. I wasn't too impressed.\\n\\nCalamari - Kind of a staple app at most place. I like the batter the squid was covered in, but there was a little too much sauce. The sauce was a little too sweet. However, others in my group really liked it. \\n\\nLamb ribs - I enjoyed these ribs. They were so tender and flavorful that I mistook them as some kind of beef/pork rib because there was no lamb smell to it. It's a shame they're such small portions.\\n\\nPork Chop - This was the entree we shared which also had the dressed bread salad. My only complaint was that the pork chop was a little difficult to cut with our butter knives. We should've asked for a steak knife. The side of peach and buttermilk dressed bread salad was a bit unusual. It was tasty but you don't want to let it sit too long or else the bread really soaks up the buttermilk.\\n\\nDuck - This was more reminiscent of duck confit. The flavors are all offset well with the other textures on this dish like the sausage and oyster mushrooms. \\n\\nOverall, Two Urban Licks does an excellent job of making most of their items juicy and flavorful. I really like the space as it's so large that it can easily handle large parties, but it can still be intimate. My only complaint is that the live band can make it difficult to talk to people and whether you like it or not, you're going to walk out with the smell of bacon on your clothes. For some people, this is a good thing: my date couldn't keep his paws off me. Haha! \\n\\nI'd like to come back to enjoy the space and maybe try more dessert, but I think we picked out and tried out all the things that stood out to us on the menu."},{"name":"Blue Dahlia Bistro","address":"1115 E 11th St","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"All I have to say is: Egg Salad Sandwich.\\n\\n\\nSo amazing.

I had heard that they imported the pizza oven straight from Milan and that a pizza cooks in 90 seconds, resulting in perfect, crusty pizza. We got the pepperoni pizza and while the cheese was delicious, the crust was more on the charred side. Each pizza can feed probably a person and 1/2.\\n\\nThe beet salad is delicious. You won't want to share this little gem because you'll want to eat it all yourself! \\n\\nIt's a great little space off 6th Street for wine, dinner with friends, or date night and is affordable for the quality of ingredients they use.

Has a really cool upscale hipster vibe.  I have yet to be on the patio (I came in the dead of winter) but I definitely look forward to it!  The seating is lounge style which is great for big groups.  It gets super loud inside so I wouldn't say it is a great first date place or anything but one of the best for large groups!  The bar space is very large in the front of the restaurant before the open kitchen area, which is perfect when you wait for your table. The wine comes out on tap as well which is a nice change of pace!  \\n\\nThe food is great.  The salmon chips really are as good as pepole say they are. My sister and I devoured them.  I ordered the duck that was served with brussel sprouts and a hazlenut relish which was delicious.  My sister ordered the salmon which was served with bok choy and a teriyaki glaze..she enjoyed it, but it wasn't anything unique.  My sister ordered a dessert (I don't remember which one) and she loved it.  The presentation of the food here is great and contrasts excellently with the modern neutral color scheme.  \\n\\nWhy I am not giving 5 stars: \\nI had a reservation for a Sunday night.. albeit the restaurant was very packed for a Sunday night, we were told we wouldn't be seated til our res time.. which was ok - but instead of a buzzer they said they would call or text me - which I found odd.  I wouldn't complain if I was seated at my table time, but it wasn't until about 10 minutes after our table time that we were seated.  We were given an awful table - stuck between two large parties and had to squeeze between the tables to get to our seats!  However - the restaurant is so well done decor wise I let it slide.  \\n\\nOur service was not good.  It was very clear our waitress was new so I was forgiving.  But it did take away from our experience.  Getting a drink was painfully slow and just the wait time between ordering drinks and apps and entrees was pretty long.  She also wasn't as knowledgable about the menu as I would expect at a place like this but that's alright.  \\n\\nHowever with all that said, I will most certainly be back.

Smaller tables were off on the sides and corners that accommodate about 4-5 people. The bar area is separated from the main seating by a few tall narrower long bar tables (more like a bar rail). Bar area is at the left when you enter with a few large screen TVs mounted high. The ordering station is in the center of the bar and you queue up to wait your turn. A huge board system shows every beer on tap (including their own Pinthouse brews). You can order both food and drinks here. \\n\\nIf you're looking for just food - you can head to the back where large chalkboards show the different pizzas and other food (no beer orders here though). If you had a bar tab running - food ordered in the back can be placed on that tab. While you order peek over their shoulders and you can see the kitchen.  Soda machine, pizza boxes are to the right as are the restrooms and a couple of old arcade games. The right side of the restaurant also has a smaller bar and the doors to the patio for additional seating. (Incidentally you can see brewing equipment and kegs from Windows both outside and inside the restaurant - not sure if you can get any closer than that). \\n\\nBut how does the pizza and beer taste? Well - the beer is definitely good. I tried the Pinthouse Ale and found it easy to drink. But how was the pizza? For one it took about 10/15 before the buzzer went off for me to go retrieve the pizza. We ordered a Margherita pizza which came lightly sauced and with fresh basil and sliced cherry tomatoes (much sweeter than Roma's). The crust was somewhat thin (but not too thin) and not exactly crisp - but the pizza was easy to lift and slightly fold. Crust was not quite as chewy or dense as Homeslice and had nice bubbling at the crusty ends - it was almost pillowy. The sauce was a semi-sweet sauce with out any sourness or tang. Cheese was nicely melted without clumping or over oiliness. Definitely a good pizza. \\n\\nI can definitely say that I'll be back again to try a few other pies!"},{"name":"Frank","address":"407 Colorado St","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"We'd seen this place on a travel channel doco before coming to the states and knew we had to check it out.

And I ate a lot of pizza when I lived there.  Probably too much.  \\n\\nI'm the first to admit that most of the pizza you get around here sucks.

Then there's all the college students around here who come from places like Iowa, and are satisfied ordering from Papa John's or from local places that don't strive to be any better.  \\n\\nBut the majority of the pizza I had in New York sucked too.

To be fair, out of the five of us, she was the only one who got extremely sick and we all ate the same food family style, so I'm not sure why it affected her and not anyone else. My other friend had a mild discomfort in his stomach but nothing severe. Our guess is that she might have had a piece of bad ceviche.\\n\\nPutting the food poisoning aside though, the food here was probably the biggest disappointment during our weekend in Portland compared to the other restaurants we dined at. The food does NOT live up to the hype. The best part of our whole meal was probably the amazing colonial look and feel of the restaurant that took me back to the time I visited Cuzco before my 3-day Inca Trail hike to Macchu Picchu.\\n\\nWhat we loved:\\n1. The Sacsayhuaman cocktail - pepper vodka shaken with pureed passionfruit and cane sugar, served up with a sugar rim and cilantro leaf garnish\\n2. The crispy golden prawns deep fried with a quinoa batter - I could have ate the whole plate myself. Too bad this was the least Peruvian dish but tasted the best out of everything else we ordered!\\n3. Beef empanadas: These are flavorful but not the best I've had.\\n\\nMoving on to the just OK:\\n1. Both the the fresh fish ceviche and the mixto chorrillano were pretty standard. Nothing special and a bit too sour for my taste. \\n2. Beef tartar with the quail egg - Loved the presentation with the egg shell but did not stand out to me either. It was good though.\\n3. Avocado stuffed with crab - Kind of just tasted like the inside of a California roll to me. \\n4. The tuna sashimi served in mango-peanut salsa - The salsa was so heavy that it overwhelmed the taste of the fish instead of complementing it. The fish also had a weird consistency that made it taste like low grade tuna.\\n5. Duck confit - duck was mostly moist but had some dry pieces. Cilantro rice that came with it was a crowd pleaser even though I thought it was a bit on the sour side.\\n\\nThe horrible:\\nLomo Saltado - And this is why this place gets a meh 2 stars. How can you mess up the lomo saltado at a Peruvian restaurant?! Beef was tough and chewy. I liked the vegetables on the side more than the beef itself."},{"name":"LongHorn Steakhouse","address":"4809 W Highway 290","city":"Sunset Valley","stars":"3.5","text":"Food cooked to our request, delicious drinks, attentive service, cozy atmosphere.

It didn't taste any different from the Ball Park hot dogs from the grocery store. Luckily, the dogs are priced reasonably at 3.00 a piece. \\n\\nI left Frank thinking that I just went to a street vendor with a nice decor and a liquor license. They need to bring the drink prices down, and start getting more creative with their hot dogs...

Our waiter John was provided some good suggestions on where to start with the menu.  \\n\\nLaunderette is the sharing type of place.  So with 10 of us I pretty much got to try everything, which was awesome!  My favorites of the night were the potato chips and pimento cheese, chicken liver pate, parsnips, hanger steak, cauliflower gratin and the red snapper crudo. \\n\\nThe pimento cheese was creamy and a bit spicy while the potato chips were perfectly crisp and fresh.  The chicken liver pate was so smooth and the huckleberry preserves paired well with it!  I really haven't had parsnips that I can recall and these were deliciously different.  The hanger steak and red snapper were both my favorite proteins served.  The crudo had avocado with it and some other citrus flavors that were amazing.  The cauliflower gratin was maybe my favorite vegetable or dish.  It was simple, elegant and cooked perfectly.  It was something I could every day for sure!  The one dish I felt I could have done with out was the romaine.  It was just kind of boring.\\n\\nI had two cocktails with my meal - the green tea mule and the bird of paradise.  Both were tasty and delicious too! \\n\\nNow - the show stopper of the night in my book was dessert!  By dessert we were all full, but we wanted to try some anyway.  We decided to order 4 birthday cake ice cream sandwiches to share among the table.  I will admit this was hard.  I really wanted one for myself after I had the first bite.  John, our waiter told us it takes them 4 days to make one ice cream sandwich.  That is crazy!  They were so good! I love ice cream and cookies and birthday cake flavored stuff!  Don't leave here without trying this!\\n\\nLaunderette is the the cutest little spot and the perfect place for a girls night out for Kimberly K's birthday!

Gustav's has TVs often showing sports, while the Reinlander has (I'm told) men in liederhosen playing the accordion.  Gustav's might have kids running around, whereas the Reinlander probably not so much.\\n\\nWhen you come in the front door and are greeted by the hostess they'll probably ask you if you want to sit in the pub (Gustav's) or the restaurant (Reinlander).  If you want my $0.02, always choose Gustav's; prices are cheaper and if you want something a little fancier, I'd probably head to some place that's less cartoony.\\n\\nOverall Gustav's isn't great, but the food is consistently good and the prices are reasonable, especially on their Happy Hour or Late Night menus.  As the name and borderline cheesy ambiance indicates, Gustav's is all about trying to re-create a German beer hall, down to the dark wood beams in the rafters and in the tables and booths.\\n\\nThe reality it it comes off a little goofy, kinda like the Tuscan villa theme of an Olive Garden, and would actually be a bit more charming if it was a little more tongue in cheek, winking a bit at how corny the whole place is.\\n\\nBut what's not corny is the good food and beer menu.  There's a wide variety of draught German beers, as well as some of the usual micros, and you can order them by the glass, pint, stein (25oz), or pitcher.  Pints are not exactly what I'd call cheap, but it's nice to quaff a big stein of Optimator or Warsteiner from the tap rather than bottle.\\n\\nThe food is very meat-centric, but is consistently good.  Some of my personal faves include the apricot glazed rotisserie pork loin, the hearty burger on a pretzel bun, and the bier sausage.  It's always nice to start off with the swiss cheese fondue, and the lentil soup is also quite good.\\n\\nDuring Happy Hour/Late Night you can get a ton of great items in the $3-7 dollar range (fondue, schnitzel strips, hamburger, potato pancakes, sausages, salads, crab & shrimp cakes, etc).  The food is always prepared well, and at these discounted prices it's a great value.\\n\\nThe service though often leaves a lot to be desired; sometimes it makes me wonder if they intentionally provide lackluster service in the pub side to justify the higher prices for essentially the same menu  on the restaurant side.  The last time we were there it wasn't rude, but definitely not attentive, they forgot to bring us water, made us wait quite some time to get more bread for our fondue, and never offered us another round of drinks.\\n\\nGustav's is good enough for me to come back, but my advice would be for the place to not take it's German-theme so seriously - they've got to realize we're all smirking just a bit - and to pay just a little more attention to the customers after bringing them their first drinks.

These were delicious. The cheese was plentiful and oozing when you bit into them. The sweet Asian sauce seemed slightly mismatched with the fried cheese balls but overall they were great. \\n\\nFried pickles- served chips style rather than in slivers. These were pretty greasy and I had to use several napkins to wipe my hands with these (along with the burgers) but I guess that's what you expect when you're eating fried anything. They're served with a chipotle ranch dipping sauce which is tasty. \\n\\nSmokey brisket chili- these guys always do well at the annual chomp n stomp chili cookoff so I knew their chili was going to be good. The chili is a dark, rich color. I think there's both brisket and burger in the chili so it's definitely meaty (which I love). It's thick though so I can't eat an entire bowl of it.

I expect a lot more especially being located in Boulder.  This review is going to cover several consecutive visits culminating in my last visit last night.  Now to be fair, all these visits were during the night/closing shifts of the day so others having different experiences during the morning, noon or early evening times may be accurate.  Over the course of the last 3 months, roughly...I have been to Burger King maybe 5 or 6 times.  Each time and Im not exaggerating in the least, my order was incorrect. Missing items and or incorrect items each time.  Also very frequently receiving old food that has been sitting well past time that it should have been thrown away and often near cold.  On one occasion after picking up a large order of $41 for both me and my roomate and getting home to split the order to eat, AGAIN finding incorrect and missing items as well as very over cooked chicken fries and old inedible food.  I attempted on many occasions on previous orders as well as this one to call the number on the receipt to complain about the order but nobody ever answers the phone.  The last time with the $41 order we just wanted our money back and I went into the store the next day to speak with the manager directly.  She was nice enough but was only aloud to remake my food which at that time of day was just not an option.  She then attempted to contact her boss, who was unavailable and I was told to call a \\"Colleen\\" on monday.  I called and left a message with a secretary and Colleen called me back the Next day.  She then told me that the owners policy on refunds in that they dont provide cash refunds past the day of the order without prior contact started with management.  At which time I told Colleen that I attempted to contact the store after getting home and noticing the problems with the order but that nobody answered the phone and then made in person contact the next morning with a manager in store and then had to wait the entire weekend for Colleen to be available.  So through now fault of my own was forced to wait nearly 5 days before speaking with some one with \\"authority\\" to make this right.  Apparently Not! I made every reasonable attempt to address this but feel like they dont want to deal with their night shift problems.  They close early often and serve bad food.

A good place to have a pint, chat with friends, read a book, shoot some pool, eat some okay vegetarian food, whatever.  Relaxed crowd of usuals, a mix of regular Joes, tattooed 20-somethings, aging hippies, and dogs, everyone getting along just fine.  This Laurelthirst I give a \\"4\\", and it would be \\"5\\" except that they stopped carrying draft Guiness - so no black and tans - and I like meat.  \\n\\nThe second is the local music spot, and here is where I'm less enthusiastic.  The music is decent enough - I'm not as wowed by the regular bands as some reviewers are, some are fine but I wouldn't pay a cover to see them, not twice anyway.  But the problem is, on music nights the Laurelthirst charges a cover and is too noisy and crowded to converse or sip a pint.  So no nipping down to my local pub on those nights.  Curses!  \\n\\nBut I realize that my resentment at losing my nearby quiet pint a few nights a week really isn't pertinent to readers, so we'll stick with the \\"4\\".  The Laurelthirst is a good place, and on those nights already lost to music you should go there and have a good time.

The crab was cooked perfectly, and the beurre blanc was super rich and yummy. The hanger steak was a perfect medium, and the roasted cippolini onions were so savory and delicious- they were the best part!

With the mad music, plethora of crazy smells, awesome visual stimuli and interesting people to look at, Voodoo Doughnut offered Zoey a piece of baby paradise.\\n\\nAbout the doughnuts: instead of getting the cock-and-balls, because you're kind of an ass that thinks it's funny to order cock-and-balls, get the maple bacon bar, and 2 other donuts. The cock-and-balls is a chocolate-covered eclair arranged with other doughnuts to look like male genitals. I mean, you COULD get the cock-and-balls, but that's an S-Load of chocolate-covered doughnut and it's expensive-6$ and change.\\n\\nFor less than 10 bucks, we got 3 maple bacon bars, a glazed doughnut and an official Oregon doughnut. This is not bad at all for a tourist trap!\\n\\nThe maple bacon bar could have been better. There needs to be bacon in every bite. In contrast, I went nuts for Oregon's official creme-filled and chocolate covered doughnut. The official Oregon doughnut made me happy enough to award 5 stars.\\n\\nThe glazed doughnut tasted like a glazed doughnut. This is my husband's favorite kind of doughnut in case you were wondering. \\n\\nYou gotta back in to park, and good luck! Carry baby inside, don't bring a stroller.

We had made reservations a week and a half ahead of time which happily meant we did not have to wait to be seated. In past years, the food has been magical (except for one time when my cousin had to send her fish back). Service has always been hit and miss but this time I was very underwhelmed by both. \\nWhile seated quickly, our waiter took his time to get to us (it was late so not as crazy as it sometimes gets there). The water fillers were very attentive which punctuated the lack of visits by our actual server when it came to taking our order or checking on us. We were a little annoyed to see the price of our favorite dish had vastly been increased. We still ordered it anyway as it was what we came all the way from Vancouver for--as well as a $12 mojito that was more ice and mint leaves than alcohol.  They used to give you complimentary bread and a trio of fresh salsas while you waited, which is delicious. It was a nice pallet introduction for those who have not had Peruvian and we always looked forward to it. This time, we were a little surprised when that did not come and our food arrived quickly via someone from the kitchen...(maybe a little too quickly for quality fine dining). We flagged down our waiter and asked about the bread/salsas and he told us that it's an order item now but he would put it in. After finishing our meals it showed up...4 tiny slices of some kind of brown bread (used to be a white artisan of some kind) and about a tablespoon each of salsas. The bread was tasty in its own (albeit tiny and not nearly enough to scoop up the lovely salsas) but was strongly flavored which did not compliment or create that symphony in your mouth as it had before. So how much does this once complimentary bread now run you? $6.00. Our waiter never came back until we flagged him for the check.

The location is somewhat small and it was bumpin' on this Friday evening, which is a great sign. There is tons of outside seating but we wanted the experience inside. The thing that threw me off when entering is there really is no waiting room so you just kind of stand against the wall, trying not to get in the way before you are seated. It was a very short wait though which didn't make it a huge issue. There were also a shortage of menus so we had to share, not a huge issue, another good sign of a bustling evening in a new restaurant. \\n\\nWe were seating in the middle of the entire space and it was a great view of everything going on. It was especialzly nice to see all the dishes everyone else was ordering, YUM!

So, I suggested to just surprise us with a lovely cocktail that has sweetness but not overdoing it, complete success! We had lovely martinis that hit the spot. How lovely. \\n\\nWe began with the house bread and my favorite part with the breadsticks, a skinny, crunchy delight that had a lovely flavor. The roasted eggplant fondue that came with is was an absolutely nice surprise. It was robust in flavor and light enough to enjoy fully but not spoil your appetite. We also had the Bruschetta of the day which was a lovely mix of fresh tomatoes on the perfect Bruschetta bread, soft in the middle but firm on the outside. The Panzanella salad is a must try! European cucumbers, Taggiasca olives, toy box tomatoes, onions, rustic croutons, peppers, Gangi Dante punta oregano, pomodoro red wine vinaigrette... it's a salad experience not to be missed.

Or better yet--I'd rather have a game to laugh over and think about.\\n\\nThe selection at Kingmakers is humongous. Even your most magpie-like geeky friend doesn't have this many games. They regularly buy new games and rotate less popular stuff out in an effort to create a slightly different experience even for their regulars.\\n\\nSommeliers are the key to Kingmakers' pull. If you see an interesting but unfamiliar game, or if you haven't opened up a game like this since Chutes & Ladders, they are there to suggest and teach and be generally helpful. All of them know tons of games, from lighter fare for those just looking to dip their toes to hours-long epic strategy fests for those who prefer to jump in the deep end.\\n\\nThe rotating taps of beer and wine (not to mention a few cheaper options in cans) offer plenty of variety for me, and while they don't have a full menu, the snacks are great for a pre-meal appetizer or post-meal snack/dessert."},{"name":"Stoli Bar & Restaurant","address":"213 Washington St","city":"Brookline","stars":"3.5","text":"Yesterday, I had a hankering for Russian food and with promises of borscht and vodka, I convinced the last friend I can still call without too much notice and planning to join me on a dinnertime trek to the Cafe St. Petersburg in Newton Centre.  I once spent a year of exile in Newton Centre and wasn't keen on returning to that bourgeois Siberia of fashion boutiques and imperialist sport utility vehicles but where my appetite is concerned I'm all id.  Then I started trolling my trusty Yelp and learnt that Stoli Bar and Restaurant in Brookline Village was much closer and its location comparatively less annoying.\\n\\nStoli is a tiny and narrow space.  The dining room holds maybe about 12 tables but it felt cozy and not cramped.  The bar at the back of the room was minuscule and I assumed the three stools were there more for decoration than function.  A lamp on the bar added an interesting touch: A pair of legs in black fishnet stockings and a shade shaped like a red corset.  There was a time when I'd have wanted that for my living room.  The walls were painted a soothing creamy white that emphasized the deep red of the booths and draperies.  Something New Ageish and unidentifiable played over the sound system.  It sounded vaguely Elvish but I couldn't be certain.  \\n\\nWe were greeted by three very young, very pretty women.  They'd been speaking to each other in some musical, but slightly edgy, European tongue that might have been--I'm going out on a limb here--Russian.  One note in this lovely triad escorted us to a table.  I swallowed the urge to make a Boris and Natasha joke.  (\\"Beeeg trouble for meewse and squerrel.\\")  Sometimes I don't know what gets into me.\\n\\nWe started off with drinks.  The lady had to go all manly and order a horseradish vodka.  I chose a Bee Tini.  (Shut up!)  I looked at the menu and felt like I was back in my grandmother's kitchen: lox and blintzes and borscht and a host of unpronounceable items that were just various types dumplings stuffed with potatoes and meat, and seemingly everything served with a side of sour cream!  A basket of hearty black bread appeared out of nowhere.  We ordered appetizers and kept ordering until we got to the end of the menu, by which time the hostess rolled us out the door and onto the street.  Dinner for two with drinks and dessert came to a shade over $90, including the tip.  Not the cheapest meal but delicious from beginning to end.

We have been dying to try this burger joint since I heard amazing things from it from friends and from reading reviews. We both got regular cheese burgers and onion rings, and we were pleasantly surprised how fresh and delicious the ingredients were. The avocado on my burger was fresh, the raw onions spicy and crunchy, and the onion rings were cripsy and hot and fresh out of the fryer. We would've given the place a 5 stars----\\n\\nif it wasn't for the snobby attitude of the dark-haired hostess/cashier at the register. The whole time she just looked like she had better things to do than to take our orders. She didn't smile or greet us, just looked genuinely annoyed the moment we walked in. She was impatient and rushed us through our orders, by the way, the whole restaurant was EMPTY at the time except for a few people sitting at the bar. Why the rush?  We asked if we can have our burgers cooked a certain temperature, she replied, quite snappy-ly, that the meat \\"only comes in 2 temperatures, medium and well.\\" Okay. That's fine. No need for the attitude. It's our first time here for Christ's Sake. \\n\\nShe also told us that the burgers were \\"very thin and small\\" and thus, convinced my husband to get the more expensive \\"Double\\" version of the cheeseburger. When the food arrived, he almost couldn't finish his food b/c the patties aren't \\"thin\\" or \\"small\\", they're normal sized (like those you would get at Five Guys or Smash Burger). Upsale much?  She then further tried to upsale all the sides (which were somewhat overpriced) that we weren't really interested in and even tried to push a combo on me after lying about the size of the beef patties. \\n\\nAfter order 2 simple burgers and one order of onion rings, the hostess/cashier told us the total was around 20 dollars. We didn't order drinks, by the way, so the food was WAY overpriced for what seems like a casual burger joint. After my husband jokingly said, \\"oh wow\\" when she told us the price, she gave us the most judgmental, bitchy look ever. Which pretty much ruined our dining-in experience. \\n\\nFor future customers, the patties aren't small or thin. They're normal sized like those you would get at Five Guys or Smash Burgers. DO come here for the delicious burgers, but don't hold your breath for a hospitable or nice hostess/cashier.

That way its much clearer  and I don't feel jipped for paying for over priced lettuce and 2 slices of tomatoes.\\n Once you notice the settle upcharges for what other restaurants consider normal ingredients, going over the menu it leaves a bad taste in your mouth.....no matter how good the sandwich ends up being. \\n Hopefully they will reconsolidate their menu.\\n\\n Best of luck!"},{"name":"Hair of the Dog Brewery and Tasting Room","address":"61 SE Yamhill St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"The beer lives up, and their food is now equally noteworthy.

I was kinda surprised how small JINYA is, must get slammed at peak times. It was still even moderately busy at this hour. There was outside seating but no one was taking advantage of that since it was a toasty bright day.\\n\\nService: Attentive and polite. A glass of water appeared magically right after I was seated. My waitress was patient with me (coming back a few times after I was still deciding what to get) and answered my question about the ramen confidently.\\n\\nRamen: I decided on the Sprouting Up ($12.95) since it contained Brussels sprouts, and I love these things, and they aren't a common ramen add-in. The bowl came out pretty promptly (5-10 minutes?). You can add toppings for more money, but I kept it original recipe. The website informs me that the broth is simmered for 10 hours and noodles are aged for 3 days. Sounds legit. Both broth and thick noodles were quality. It was a pork-chicken broth, and there were pork slices, green onions, bean sprouts, and kikurage (a crunchy jelly-like dark mushroom I love). Listed as having spicy bean sprouts but nothing was too hot. Roasted Brussels sprouts were super. An egg, black pepper, and ginger rounded it all out.\\n\\nBathroom: Single person restrooms, with one for women and one for men. I didn't see a hook for a purse so that was a little annoying.\\n\\nParking: It's a strip mall, and parking wasn't a problem at all.\\n\\nConclusion: I need more ramen in my life, I've decided. JINYA is a fine place to help me met this requirement. Look for locations in Buckhead and Alpharetta (coming soon) too.

Despite it being a warm evening, it wasn't that busy outside - it was only 6:30, which is kind of early for a Saturday night I guess, so maybe it picks up later.\\n\\nThe waiter was friendly and kept the water refills coming (we'd already walked almost 4 miles at that point!).  The menu he provided didn't have pizza, and when we asked he gave us a separate pizza menu. with lots of options  We were told the pizzas were personal-sized, so we ordered two to share - one Capricosa (with ham, artichokes, and olives) and one Pollo Pesto (chicken, pesto, and tomatoes).  When they came out they were huge - definitely more than the two of us could eat!  The pizzas were good, not great, but good enough to take home the leftovers in a doggie bag.  Service was good overall.  At the end of the night we ran into someone who appeared to be the manager or owner, and he asked how our meals were and gave us an extra bag to help carry our takeaway pizza.\\n\\nAll in all, this was a solid but not memorable dining experience.  For pizza it was only okay.  As I saw other customers' entrees come out, the plates looked kind of sloppy.  The big plus was the outdoor seating and the fact that there was no wait on a Saturday night, but beyond that I don't think there would be a reason for me to return."},{"name":"Not Your Average Joe's","address":"4C Wayside Rd","city":"Burlington","stars":"3.5","text":"\\"Service was terrible.

Next, in walk two groups of young tourists wearing inappropriate clothes and bringing juice boxes to their table. Our table was dressed up, looking forward to a fancy dinner which we don't usually treat ourselves to, next to people who looked like they would be better off in a Friendly's. \\n\\nOur table proceeded ordering, 4 martinis, 4 salads/soups, and 4 entrees. My dad was curious about the cioppino and asked the waitress to describe it to us. To which she replied \\"it's a very light, small portion\\". Needless to say, he didn't order that. Our meals came out quite a bit later and they brought my mom the wrong entree, both my husband and my dad very dry bland pork chops, and me a \\"grilled eggplant and zucchini rollatini\\" on which there was no zucchini and instead LOADS of cheese and red sauce. \\n\\nOur waitress brought my mom out a soup while she waited for her meal, and about 20 minutes later, brought out her chicken, which was also very dry.

We said that we had reservations for the table but we were told that we had to leave for the other guests who were willing to pay for the dinner!"},{"name":"Andina Restaurant","address":"1314 NW Glisan St","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"Great food.

The trailer looks awesome, the big \\"Chicken\\" sign is pretty sweet. I love the whole set up. The service was really great, the woman who took our order was very friendly and helpful. The food was a big let down. The chicken was not very flavorful. The breading was chewy and soaked in grease. The coleslaw was served hot and was way over seasoned. The \\"Marty\\" which was advertised as \\"traditional grilled Mexican street corn\\" was overcooked and overpowered by the goat cheese. I'm going to give them a second chance because I might have caught them on a bad day or something. Honestly the price is way to high for what you get.  I hope they do well next time, because I love how bad ass the trailer looks."},{"name":"Wu Er by WOW Barbecue","address":"320 Washington St","city":"Brookline","stars":"3.5","text":"I feel like I need to start this review by saying it was clear and obvious it was week 2, and they were overwhelmed. That being said, i'm willing for bad service and long wait times, but to also have mediocre cold food???\\n\\nWe arrived to a packed restaurant and were told we would have a 40 minute wait, but we could order food at the bar. Great! Except, they had 1 bartender on staff for the entire restaurant! I felt bad for the guy who was about 6 drinks behind, while countless other staff just sat there doing nothing staring at him like it was his fault.\\n\\nWe had our food order put in right away, and about an hour to and hour twenty minutes our cold noodles finally came, followed by hot noodles with overcooked meat, followed by freezing/heavily drowned in spices skewers. I said something about the skewers, especially after they told us the lamb one my friend ordered was beef, and they said \\"really, have you ever had skewers?\\". What am I an idiot?\\n\\nIt is very apparent that they had friends leave 5 star reviews. I'm not saying this place will always be two stars, but until they work out the kinks and serve quality food, I won't be returning."},{"name":"Folk Art Restaurant","address":"465 N Highland Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"I've been wanting to try this quaint spot in Inman Park for a while and I wouldn't say I was disappointed,  but I also wasn't impressed. This is such a mixed review because I like this place but it's nothing to write home about.  My lobster eggs benedict was delicious and the hash browns were you typical bland potatoes. My friend had the dry chicken and flat waffle  (although the waffle was tasty) and the peach compote is an interesting spin. I appreciate the fact that they have their own signature dishes and drinks and I'd definitely come again!"},{"name":"Mary Mac's Tea Room","address":"224 Ponce De Leon Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"This place has a great southern charm with friendly staff.

I gave this place three different chances and it has been worse each time. I really want to support it because I love the concept but YUCK. The first time we got regular burgers and the truffle fries. It was ok - a little greasy but ok. The second time we ordered burgers with an order of kid's chicken fingers and the mushroom burger. The cf were so greasy they were dripping! My kid took about 2 bites and didn't want anymore and I couldn't blame her. Now the third time we ordered burgers and I was really hoping this place would redeem itself. We got take-out, got home and all of the burgers were blood raw in the center. I'm talking not cooked. So totally disappointing. I paid $24 for an order that was so bad I reasoned throwing it in the trash. Will not be back."},{"name":"Grass Fed","address":"605 Centre St","city":"Jamaica Plain","stars":"3","text":"I've been to grass fed 3 times and every time they've managed to mess up my order.  During my most recent visit, I specifically asked for no cheese or aioli on my veggie burger and when the food came out there was both on top. I sent it back and explained what I wanted, and when my second burger came out it still had aioli on it.  They finally got it right on the third try, but by that time everyone else had already finished their food. Definitely won't be coming back."},{"name":"Cheeseboy","address":"280 Washington St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"I ordered a grilled cheese sandwich with tomatoes and a small tomato soup on the side.

On a recommendation from of our sales rep, we came after working our showroom at Americas Mart.  We had a reservation, but we could not be seated until our entire party was present.  We were informed we could wait at the bar until they arrived. \\n\\nAt the bar, I tried two drinks: the Black & Blue and Key West Lemonade.  Although the Black & Blue is a signature drink, it was very average.  Underwhelmed by my drink, I asked the bartender to create me a fruity vodka drink.  He made a Key West Lemonade for me, and boy, was this drink good!  \\n\\nAfter the other two members of arrived, we were promptly seated.  Despite our large number, the server was very attentive to our needs.  We ordered two bottles of wine, both on his recommendation, several appetizers, and individual entr√©es. For appetizers,  we shared the salmon chips, calamari, and empanadas.  The empanadas were delicious, and both the salmon chips & calamari were good.  For the main entr√©e, I ordered the brisket.  Omg, the brisket steals the show. It is fork tender and comes with elote style corn.
