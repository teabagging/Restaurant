We're both hot heads and loved the capsaicin \\"high\\" and decided to order our dishes mala style. We selected two highly spiced entrees:Fresh Fish Filets and Napa Cabbage with Spicy Chili Sauce $15.95 (F05)\\nSpicy Handmade Noodles with Lamb $10.95 (Daily Special)\\nWhite Rice $1.98The Fresh Fish Filets and Napa Cabbage with Spicy Chili Sauce was hands down one of their signature dishes representing true Sichuan cuisine. Thinking about it makes my mouth water! With a scoop of the white fish filet, cooked napa covered in the thick mala gravy topped on my rice gave me the \\"high\\" with each bite. Thank goodness my dinner companion enjoyed the spice without either one of us breaking a sweat. I was worried it would be drenched in oil but to my surprise it wasn't swimming in it. The high was in the gravy plus a generous sprinkle of dried chili seeds and raw garlic on top. I did notice the next morning my fingers were a bit swollen probably from the excess sodium in the gravy. So worth it! The Spicy Handmade Noodles did not have the mala texture but served \\"dry\\" style. The handmade noodles were about  1/2\\" wide and had an al dente chew. The spice came from dried chilis throughout the dish. Baby bok choy also accompanied the sliced seasoned lamb. This was definitely a good choice to order along with a mala dish. For those who can't tolerate the heat, they offer plenty of alternatives. They list the spicy level with chili(s) icons next to the dish. Most likely, I'm sure you can ask the servers to make it as mild as possible. They automatically served black tea and water per request. The service was quick as the tables were turned around quickly. The interior was your basic Chinese restaurant which was located across the street from Burlington Mall. As our bill came with two fortune cookies, we paid using a credit card and started our dessert hunt.If you're adventurous or spiced challenged, this restaurant definitely earns a node for their authentic Sichuan style."},{"name":"Cuba 512","address":"6800 West Gate Blvd, Ste 112","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"I am very sorry to write this review because we have eatin here numerous times and I have also recommended it to several people.Today my wife and I, with another couple went here to have brunch.

The seafood is delicious and as fresh as you can get!

Easy, right?  The woman that took my order told me it would be roughly 25 minutes between the call and pickup.  I arrived 25 minutes later on the dot.  It takes me about 15 minutes to get home and while, yes, it's ridiculously cold outside in the middle of December, that's no excuse for cold food when I get home to eat, especially when I put the food in a container to keep the temperature consistent for the ride home.  The next problem - the prices.  The prices have gone up, quality AND quantity of food has decreased.  This is the same move that the airlines (and Panera Bread) have pulled and I don't know that I need to pay that much for mediocre execution on cold American-Italian food.  The other problem - the side of meatballs.  I opened the heavily saran-wrapped container to find a huge pile meat sauce piled into the Styrofoam along with ONE meatball.  I paid $5 for one extra meatball.  The meatball side being just that - ONE meatball - pushed me over the edge with this place.  I noticed a while ago that the prices had gone up, amount of food down BUT I was liking the food enough to say I'd support a local restaurant.  Not anymore.  I'm finished.  And this is after a few times over the years of coming home to realize that the meatballs were sometimes missing from my main dish.  Still, I was onboard because the food was just good enough.  Nothing spectacular, but good for cold winter nights when I don't want to cook.I CANNOT recommend this place anymore.  Cold food. Poor preparation (not on the cooking end) and assembly.  Higher prices. I'm kinda finished.  I have been going here for years and it's only fitting with the end of the decade upon us to call it a day and I'm doing just that - we're breaking up Gennaro's.

I don't live in Vancouver anymore, but head straight to Kokoro when I get off the plane to come back for a family visit. Here's what I crave from afar. Their tuna tataki is beyond belief.

And yes, I understand that Kukai is not THE BEST, MOST AUTHENTIC, EXACTLY LIKE THE BEST IN JAPAN Ramen shop. It's a solid \\"-A\\" player in Japan and here in the US too.  By \\"real deal\\" I mean not just good ramen, but a beautiful space, courteous staff and reasonable prices. After four separate visits and eating about half the menu, its pretty much exactly what I expected. So far I have had:\\nGarlic ramen \\nSpicy Ramen\\nShio Ramen\\nHot Tsukumen (pork and shoyu)\\nMiso Ramen\\nPork Belly \\nWings\\nTakoyakiThe noodles differ depending on the type of soup you get. But across the board, they were all cooked just right- \\"al dente\\" like I like it. The broth(we always got regular but you can go low sodium) was also great. There have been a few small inconsistencies which would be expected for such a new place. It was the soft openings after all(which I highly commend their measured, 2 week long, reservation -or sneak in at lunch - opening). On the service side, on one visit we were waiting upfront  when another group came in after and was seated first and we ended up sitting at the big table in the back next to the busy bathroom, when they got the much better spot. That kinda sucked but hey, again it was a soft opening and the woman that sat us was there all day. I know because I was there for lunch earlier and she was there and this was at like 9 pm and she was still going strong. \\nmy only two disappointments are totally personal preference and not a knock on the restaurant. First,  the soup was just not quite hot enough for my liking. Maybe ok right at first, but it didn't take long to get to the point where I wished I could reheat the broth.  I would imagine that this is so they don't overcook the noodles as they sit in the bowl maybe, but I would just like a hotter bowl of soup. Commendations on being consistent but next time I will just ask for it to be hotter in the first place and hopefully that won't be some catastrophic Japanese faux pas where the chef will need to hara-kiri himself in the back alley. Is that racist?\\nSecondly is the pork belly. Again, totally subjective here but it just doesn't do it for me. Too fatty/greasy even for belly and it was difficult to eat with chop sticks as it kind of unrolls into a long basically thick piece of uncured bacon. And just FYI Japanese people always compliment me on my chopstick skills... ;) I guess I just prefer the kakuni block-style.As far as the service is concerned, it is too early to tell. The vivacious redhead that seems to run the place does a great job. Some of the younger guys were a little out of sorts but I'm sure they will get into the flow soon enough. Other than that everything was just what you would expect from a better Japanese chain's US location and they are a wonderful addition to the neighborhood!"},{"name":"Panda Wok","address":"1390 Cherry Bottom Rd","city":"Gahanna","stars":"4","text":"Yum!

But since it was my first time and I was dining with a large party for a friend's birthday, there were a few snafus. But nothing that would ruin our experience.First of all, this place does not take reservations. I called about a week ahead of time and the person on the phone told me the best time frames where we were most likely to get a table (6-7pm) so I worked our dinner plans around that.   I arrived about 1/2 hour before most of the party arrived and the gentleman in the lobby advised me that they couldn't seat until half our party was there. So until then, we hung out in the bar and took advantage of the Happy Hour deals that lasted until 7pm. When half of our party arrived I checked back in at the hostess stand. There was a different person working and she had no clue that I had checked in earlier about the large table. She gave us an estimated wait time of about 20 minutes unless we wanted to sit outside . We decided to wait it out. It was a little aggravating , moreso because of the lack of communication from the previous employee at the stand who didn't even give her a heads up about our party. Poor thing was completely blindsided and a little frazzled. Thankfully we didn't have to wait too long for our table. I would say it only took about 10 minutes or so until our pager buzzed . The restaurant has fun decor' and a party vibe. And it's LOUD so don't expect to have deep conversations about life.  Lots of bright colors and a big statue of Elvis outside their front door (still not sure why) .  I know this place will be a big draw for tourists with it's atmosphere, affordability and monster size portions. Food was pretty solid. Chips and dip (basic salsa as well as the creamy jalapeno salsa) are complimentary and are neverending. There were a few times where we had to ask for refills. I wish those bowls of dips were bigger!!   I thought it was funny that they used big ice scoops to refill the chips bowls.    I ended up ordering the bean and cheese burrito plate which came with rice. You're able to pick a sauce to top and in my rushing I picked the Tex Mex sauce not realizing it was made with beef. I ended up having to push it off to the side and focused on eating the inside of the burrito. My fault ....and I just know better the next go around to read the ingredients much closely.   On the bright side, the burrito was massive and yummy but I could only muster a couple of large bites before I threw in the towel. I blame the chips and dip for this. Oh, and my frozen strawberry margarita. Manny was our server and I give him credit for handling a table of 10 crazy women (myself not included , haha) , their orders and requests. On top of that he had other large tables in the same room that he was tending to.   Bills were split amongst the 10 of us with no issues.  For a Tex Mex chain, this is a good one but plan accordingly for large parties.

I ordered the thai tea with fresh lime- lovely. Our waitress explained that you order a few things and then share them- basically family style.

The muu paa kham waan was also good, but we all agreed that when we go again we'd order the other two things and try something new for the third. We loved the coconut rice. My mom was hesitant about it which is why we also got jasmine rice. I'm glad we got both though because I love rice and they were both great. We mentioned it was my sister's birthday casually and at the end of the meal our waitress brought our mango sticky rice (which we ordered and paid for, just to be clear) with a little candle. So thoughtful and sweet! Our waitress was super nice and patient with us- we had no idea what to order and she guided us in the right direction. They were also so nice when we were leaving- the restaurant had also emptied out considerably so I think a late lunch here might be a good idea! This is another random note, and a little odd, but also the water here is so good (in my opinion, my mom wasn't a huge fan). We asked the waitress and she said the secret was pandan leaf.

Our server was a tad bit annoyed, especially with all the drunk girls talking over each other that I had to apologize on everyone's behalf. We had a lot of drinks that night.  Food portions are small too so we felt compelled to order at least a dish and a half for each girl that was there.  There were 6 of us.

Powell's shoves a book in the face of those people and says \\"come on over to the printed side!\\"  There is something almost romantic about the touch of a book.  I have always been someone who lives to read and although I do have a lot of Ebooks, I still have a fond affinity for an actual book.  Powell's not only has new books but it also has a large number of used books as well.  I think their used books are the most interesting and there is always a very big selection. If you are planning a trip they not only have books about the history, politics and languages but they also have travel books, maps and atlases. They also carry some items you might need for your trip such as universal adapters and passport holders.

I have been here several times now and can say, without equal that it is one of the best.All the Thai staples are on the menu, though I have reflexed to the Tham Yan noodle soup on my last two visits. The drunken noodles (pad kee mao) are tasty, but a bit under seasoned in my opinion. Phad Thai is hard to screw up, but I will say that they do well at not overcooking g their noodles so there is texture there and not the oversteemed mush you get at other places.But, should you want to start with a munchables, the pot stickers are small and delightfully full of flavor and Prime's your stomach for the yumminess to come.There is not a ton of seating here, but it seems to be enough for their customer base, which is not as robust as it honestly should be.

I think if I am ever in the Beaverton area, I would stop by but would probably check out their Izakaya items. The restaurant itself, is pretty pleasant. High ceilings, with an open floor concept, with seating at the bar. It's pretty spacious, but it can get crowded during busy times. We ordered the regular Tonokotsu and the spicy ramen. The pork chasu, is sliced wafer thin, and tasted as if it had been prepared a couple of days before hand. The broth could have been a little more flavorful, and if you're ordering spicy, their interpretation of spicy is on the mild side. I love their gyoza, it was served hot and crispy. A positive aspect is their pricing range,  everything including the soft boiled egg is included in the price, and your ramen bowl won't cost you nearly $20.

We told him we've never been there before so, he gave us a quick tutorial of the process and the different options. I love options but also i can be indecisive so, next thing I know, Troy's handling me little samples of my potential flavors. After trying a few fun flavors, I made up my mind to go with a scoop of the Dirty Bird (butter pecan ice cream with roasted pecan) & scoop of Cookie Monster (cookie dough ice cream with oreos & blue frosting). I had those two sandwiched between a hot fluffy glazed donut. When the masterpiece was completed, Troy handed it to me and it was HOT! But surprisingly, the ice cream was still frozen solid. The first bite was AH MAY ZING!!!!! And so were all the other bites to follow until it was all gone. I was quite sad... almost wanted to order another one but had to stop myself!I highly recommend this ice cream spot! Even on a cold day like today, 50 degrees, still worth the trip!

A Cuban sandwich NEVER includes mayonnaise!The traditional Cuban sandwich starts with Cuban bread. The loaf is sliced into lengths of 8-12 inches, lightly buttered or brushed with olive oil on the crust, and cut in half horizontally. A thin coat of yellow mustard is spread on the bread. Then sliced roast pork, glazed ham, baby Swiss cheese, and two or three thinly sliced dill pickles are added, then it's placed in la plancha and pressed until golden and the cheese has melted. \\nSometimes the pork is marinated in mojo and slow roasted before placing in the sandwich.\\nThere is a never ending debate whether to include soft salami in the sandwich. In Miami they don't include it, but they do in Tampa. In Cuba many restaurants included mortadella in the sandwich.

Unfortunately, Steel Toad exceeded my expectations and delivers a solid 3 stars (3.5 if that was possible).I think it is safe to say that with Tap and Barrel and Craft already in place, and Mahoney a short walk down the seawall,.. the Olympic Village has hit saturation with the brewpubs.  However, as I discovered, each has its strengths and weaknesses.Tap and Barrel has that patio, as does Mahoney and Sons, so in summer they are clear winners despite maybe not having as good a menu as Steel Toad. In fact, ST has the most extensive menu of all of them and the food is decent, so for winter time, it has my vote of the bunch. How else does it compare? \\nUnlike Craft the acoustics issue is less of a concern here.  To make matters better, on the night we were there they had live music (decent too, a duo of acoustic guitarists doing 90s classics) which was at a reasonable volume.\\nAlso, there is a dining room upstairs with a few interesting alcoves etc. making it somehow less barn-like than Craft despite what this place originally was.  And on the that note, I think the reno here was really well done,.. somehow it retained more than  just the beams, the original windows and much of the now visible wood frame adds to the vibe and is a nice contrast to the steel beer vats which have been nicely incorporated. Overall I like the vibe in here more than Craft but it is still that same sort of good pub food that is becoming too common.

This was my boyfriend's favorite of the night. I didn't try it though because I wanted to save room for the two entrees.Lobster Roe Noodles ($38)--braised short rib, grilled lobster, oyster mushrooms, brussel sprouts, pecorino--seriously, what is there not to love! As I read the menu, I literally felt like this dish was tailor-made for me--my favorite cut of meat, with one of my favorite seafoods, with my favorite fungi and vegetable--it sounds soo good in theory yet, somehow all together, it was missing one important ingredient: cohesion. All the individual components were good, albeit a little bland--the short ribs, tender; the lobster, generous and fresh; the mushrooms, mushroomy--but it felt like they were merely coexisting on a plate together rather than coming together to create synergy and make magic! There was a little hint of balsalmic-y tasting sauce drizzled on parts of the pasta but not enough to tie things together or to add more flavor. I guess I just expected a little bit more pizazz and pure joy in my mouth for such a highly regarded dish. Bouillabaisse ($36)--lobster, shrimp, halibut, littleneck clams, rouille. The seafood tasted fresh but there was barely any broth in the stew--again, just okay. It was a mere 3 hours ago but I'm having a hard time remembering enough to write about it.As the saying goes, with great power comes great responsibility--apparently this applies to pricing as well, because even though the food was not necessarily bad, the price to joy-in-my-mouth ratio just wasn't there for me. \\"Just okay\\" kind of sums it up for me."},{"name":"Pok Pok","address":"3226 SE Division St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Yummy!

First the wings.  The wings are fried super crispy and the sauce/glaze that they are coated with is super tasty.  They almost tasted like korean fried chicken, with that certain level of sweetness and soy saucy flavor, but probably kicked up a notch with the fish sauce.  The spicy version tasted roughly about the same to me, but perhaps with a smokier flavor.  Definitely not in the least bit spicy though, so if you are a big spicy lover like me, the original and spicy are roughly about the same.  The glass noodle dish came out piping hot and was equally as delicious.  The skin is still on the prawns, but they are de-veined and ready to eat.

With another four pieces of bread, these were enough for us two girls who had their lunch/early dinner at 3:30 pm.

If you don't know which appetizer to order or want to try a variety of calamari dishes, this is the one you should go for. The fried calamari was very crunchy and chewy. The lemon balanced out all the greasiness. Calamari meatball was okay. I loved the sauce and use it as the dipping sauce for the fries, but the texture of the meatball was grainy and not as chewy as other types of meat balls. Fried fish fillet and the fries were average: not good, not bad. The best of all was the calamari salad. I had it in other Italian restaurant at north end before, and this one was much better. The calamari was super fresh, tender and well seasoned. I found myself not a fan of olive, but for some magic for this salad I could taste the olive flavor from the salad seasonings, and I liked it! The aglio olio black pasta received a mixed opinion from we two. For me it was too bland, but for my friend she said the saltiness level was just on point. Luckily they have salt and pepper on the table. So after I added a little bit salt to the pasta, it became insanely delicious. The pasta itself was freshly made and very chewy. The grounded calamari had a strong garlic flavor and went very well with the pasta. This is definitely a dish that you should try.One advantage of sitting in proximity with other people is that you could learn what other people ordered.

You can order their recommended combos or customize your own, and the friendly staff is very helpful in advising on what makes a good combination.Another big Freshii plus: online ordering. I have my Fresshi account setup with my credit card info and all my favorite salads and quinoa bowls, including the combos I've invented myself. If I'm planning to eat lunch at my desk, or have only a few minutes to step out, I preorder and prepay for my meal and it's waiting for me at the designated time (I try to order at least 30 mins in advance so I don't have any trouble getting the pickup time I want.)Best of all: even though this is a fast-food chain, it's got terrific, friendly and personal service.

It might not be the fanciest of gyros, but they do serve up a pretty damn fine one, and when you pair it up with fries and a drink, the entire thing comes out to just around $6. Their fries are also seasoned very interestingly, and they give you quite a healthy -- or is it unhealthy...? -- whatever, what I mean to say is that they give you a crapload of fries in each order. And like I briefly hinted at before, Kismet is open late, so they've definitely rescued me on more than one occasion when I couldn't possibly eat another Clif bar to stave off hunger.Take the 3 star rating with a grain of salt. For what it is -- a late night food spot -- it's spectacular, and if Yelp were littered with nothing but those kinds of places, I'd easily give it 4 stars. But it is just a place for late night grub to me, so 3 stars it is. Don't let that discourage you from going though!Overall, Kismet's Gyro Combo is a phenomenal deal if your wallet is as empty as your stomach is on a Thursday night at 3am.

The best dish I've had here yet.That said, I will never get a pizza here again.  Went with the butternut squash and it just missed the mark on all levels.  Hardened pizza with kale, butternut squash, vegan ricotta.  The little flavor it had didn't jive with my taste buds or any of the others that ate it.

It was National Cheeseburger day and that sounded good. I had previously been to a Ford's Garage in Tampa area and had a great burger. I brought my parents along. \\nWe had a great server named Kevin, he was attentive and always made sure we were taken care of.\\nI started with a Pumpkinhead beer. They do it right by putting a rim of cinnamon sugar on the glass. It's the little things. We started off with the GIANT FUNNEL TOWER OF JUMBO PISTON ONION RINGS. They were crispy on the outside and the onion on the inside was firm not mushy. They had a nice flavor that was not too sweet like some onion rings. They were also very hot and were not sitting around. I like how they are served on an oil funnel. \\nI tried there new seasonal burger, it was an Australian Wagyu Beef Spicy burger. I subbed out the standard bun for a pretzel bun. This burger was awesome. The Wagyu beef does make a difference. It has more flavor and is tender. The burger was topped with fried jalape√±os, a spicy sauce and Pepper-jack cheese. This was very filling and probably one of the best burgers I have had recently.  They do not do regular fries. They serve Potato wedges and they are seasoned nicely and go well with the chipotle ketchup that is served with the onion rings. \\nMy mom had a Chop Shop Salad with Salmon. This salad is huge and they can swap the lettuce mix for romaine. The salmon that is added on is a 6 oz fillet.

Our 5:30 res was perfect for making it to the HOB for a Burlesque show at 7:30 on a weeknight. I had a martini at the bar while I waited for my dining partner. The olives are kinda special, not the Spanish vinegar mush balls that are a guilty pleasure for most folks. These were greener and not as salty, very nice. A cocktail from the menu (high pines) with gin, sweet vermouth, grapefruit and elderflower was a winner for my better half. And one that I am looking forward to making for us at home. The rest of the cocktail menu is a hit. A cocktail with mezcal and sherry is a gem, a spirit combo that I had read about and was thrilled to finally try. It is served neat and stays balanced until the end, something that I have found is a challenge for other similar mezcal cocktails that are go-to offerings by some bartenders around town which instead use the Punt e Mes or Campari. This one is better. \\nThe star attraction at ICOB of course is the shellfish and they did not disappoint tonight. Almost all are from the New England region. This is greatly appreciated. I find it unnecessary to ship shellfish in from places as far as Washington or even Japan in some cases. A feat that other restaurants can keep. I am in New England and will always prefer local seafood. We went through a dozen that included a few different Cape Cods, the namesake Duxburys, and a Point Judith, RI, which was our favorite. And we did something that we normally do not do, ordered 6 more!\\nMy previous sentiment on the locality of seafood is not supported in the entr√©e section here tonight. Out of about 6 selections there were only two from NE. A grilled salmon from Maine that my girl snatched up, which was fine. The pink lady has never been my favorite. If I had to take one of two sisters to a dance I would choose swordfish everyday, and twice on Sunday. So, I opted for the Cape Cod Monkfish which was fabulous. It came with a root veggie called salsify which was an education for me, a member of the sunchoke family. \\nFor sides we got the traditional Boston baked beans, very good. And a buttermilk biscuit that had been baked with a sticky honey glaze on the bottom that added the perfect sweetness to a baked good that sometimes carries the spectre of dryness with it. Not here!\\nThe wine list is also top notch. They were featuring wines from Germany that included a  Riesling that I tasted, but didn't like. But, a different Riesling offered did the trick, the Gaisberg, I think. Carla, our server was excellent with suggestions and taste pours. Since I am a fan of Mexican spirits a new Del Maguey mezcal called Tobala caught my eye on the desert menu of all places, so a taste was provided. It was every bit a shot of mezcal, but with a vanilla forward and finish that is exquisite. It looks like I have a new bottle to seek out for the liquor cabinet at home. And a glass of Viennese Veltliner was excellent. \\nDesert and cappuccino was competent. A chocolate torte that was diminutive, but good. And a banana pie that was nice. \\nThe service, fare, ambiance and price were all right on the nose. As a small aside, being a sound person I noticed that the speakers in the dining room need to be checked for a ground issue. A buzz can be heard, but likely only by professionals. \\nBut, the real buzz here is the offerings. We will definitely be back in baseball season."},{"name":"Moonshine Patio Bar & Grill","address":"303 Red River St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"Cool vibes and wonderful patio.

Overall it was a pretty good experience.Our viewing of Hobbs and Shaw was at 12:30pm on a Saturday afternoon, so there were maybe 20 people in the theater. We previously bought our tickets online and arrived 20 minutes early, which gave us plenty of time to print our tickets from the multiple kiosks up front and order food ahead of time. The ladies at the front were extremely nice and helpful explaining the process and handing us a menu.The lobby includes a full bar and seating area as well as one of those automated beer dispensers where you scan your badge and it pours you a glass. There was also a door that led outside to additional seating so you could enjoy a drink before the show.Being a new theater, it was extremely clean and easy to navigate. All the theaters are off of the same hallway. As we entered and found our seats, our server Dylan came up and greeted us. The seats are fairly comfy and recline but they don't allow you to lean back too much. The seats include a tray that swivels toward you with a button to call your server. I will say I greatly appreciate the setup of some seats having 2 cupholders in 1, which is helpful if you want water with your main drink. The prices are decent with appetizers, entrees, and desserts ranging from $5-$20. We decided on the pretzel bites, ahi tuna bowl, and the southwest chicken salad. Dylan was super friendly and chit chatted with us when we placed our drink order and food order. That was about the last time we really saw him though because other servers and food runners brought everything else out, like our drinks, food, and check.Food Review and Suggestions: Pretzel bites - please don't coat them in oil or whatever you had, the cheese dipping sauce just slid right off and it tends to get super messy. Southwest Chicken Salad - was probably our favorite thing out of everything but you could tell the chicken was super salty, and avocados weren't fully ripe so they were hard as well.Ahi Tuna Bowl - I may be a bit picky but the tuna was decently cooked instead of just seared which I'm not a huge fan of. I also thought the slaw was a bit overkill.. I don't know, I was just expecting something different... but overcooking the tuna is like a well-done steak, just a bit disappointingOverall I would say it was a good experience. Everyone was really helpful and nice, and the food was alright, but I'd like to try something different next time before I give a more clear rating. The burgers that some other guests had looked really good. According to some other reviewers here, I would probably suggest trying this theater during a slower time, you may have a better experience.**side note: the 2 in 1 Dyson sink/dryer was probably the coolest thing I've ever seen!

These are homemade balls of yumminess...lol! They offer a traditional ball, Mediterranean which is grass fed lamb, chicken Marsala, Sausage, Spicy Pork, Rueben Ball and Vegetarian/Gluten Free. Please note that as of yesterday the sausage ball is now gluten free and I must say it's very tasty.  I was told that their chicken and lamb come from the Halal Meat store which is right next door. Once you choose your style of meatball then you choose what you want to go with it. You can choose to have them \\"On Top\\" which means on top of one of their tasty sides like pasta or creamy polenta. If you're looking for a lighter option then you can choose to just have them on a bed of arugula. Or if you're wanting a sandwich then choose a Meatball Smash which is their version of a meatball sandwich. Once you've chosen your side then you choose your sauce of either pesto, roasted tomato, creamy provolone, Marsha mushroom and spicy pork sauce. They have specials Monday thru Thursday and since it was Monday I took advantage of the $1 Meatballs Monday Madness. You get a minimum of 4 meatballs of the same flavor on a bed of lettuce with a piece of focaccia bread with a drink purchase. I chose the Chicken Marsala balls. Oh my were they good!!! They were cooked perfect. Every bite was moist and flavorful. Oh and the Marsala sauce was perfect. Just what I imagined for a good Marsala. It was a nice brown sauce with ample pieces of mushrooms. I used my focaccia to soak up the remaining juices. Couldn't let it go to waste...lolWhile I was there, the owner gave me a sample of a new quinoa, pear, cucumber, black bean, cilantro and lime salad. I can honestly say it was one of the best quinoa salads I've had in a long time. He said that they are trying to add more vegetarian options to the menu as well as gluten free options. I must say that they are doing an awesome job so far. You can't leave without getting dessert. They offer homemade mini cannoli's and Gelato from Muse Gelato. I opted for the Cappuccino gelato. It was very good. My total bill came up to $11 which isn't bad for a decent lunch. It would have been less if I would have ignored my sweet tooth. \\nI'm looking forward to my next visit where I plan to try the Mediterranean and some of the different sides.You can call in your order if you're in a hurry or you can sit in and eat.

However even if we weren't dating, this would still be my favorite sandwich place.This restaurant opens at 11AM and my gf woke up at 8AM, craving their pastrami sandwich for breakfast. Being the supportive partner I am, I agreed to fast with her until the doors opened. We made our way down to Sam's around 10:30AM and all the tables were already filled with bags of catered lunches. We wondered around the financial district for a little and came back at 11:03AM, and to our surprise four other customers were already inside ordering and an additional customer was already eating. Needless to say this place is super popular, and also open only on weekdays so make sure you plan accordingly.My gf ordered the standard pastrami and I got the southwestern pastrami, with the addition of caramelized onions. Sandwiches here range from $14-$20+ for a platter (you get a side) but the value is pretty good since the sandwiches are super filling and the meat in no way resembles anything you'd find at a supermarket deli. Obviously with pastrami, you can count on a salty sandwich. However Sam's somehow keeps you right on that fine line of satisfying a salty craving and feeling like you drank the ocean. With that being said, the pickles taste much more like cucumbers so maybe light on the brine is by design?"},{"name":"Counter Culture","address":"2337 E Cesar Chavez St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"I went here today with a friend for lunch, and it was an average to good experience.

When we got here we put our name on a waiting list and had to wait about 20 minutes because it was pretty busy. The wait wasn't too bad. While waiting my husband moved the car to a parking spot that we didn't have to pay for. There is a parking lot close to the restaurant in which you have to pay to use.We were sat at a two person table and soon after our waiter greeted us and took our drink order. They offered sodas but they were not the typically coke and Pepsi products that you get at other restaurants. They also had alcohol and other typical drink options. My husband tried a soda and it tasted a little syrupy compared to the soda he is used to.Before ordering food we asked the waiter what he suugested. He was very knowledgeable about the menu and told us he had only been working there for a few days. I was impressed  that they prepared their employees so well. For food we shared the pretzel and cheese appetizer and I got chicken and waffles (I forgot what my husband got). The pretzels and cheese we're very warm and tasty. The chicken and waffles we're also very delicious, but in my experience you can never go wrong with chicken and waffles. I love the uniqueness this restaurant gives from the drinks to the food. The place has a nice vibe and our waiter was very knowledgeable of the menu. The only down side is the parking and it is a little pricey.

Can you just bring me a straw so I can drink that stuff straight? Never mind it's pure fat and would likely make me sick. It's worth the consequences. On the one hand, the steak doesn't need the butter. It's tender and well-seasoned (maybe just a tad on the salty side, but not enough to bother me) and oh so beautiful. Oh the other hand, when is butter ever a bad idea? (people on cholesterol drugs, don't answer that question)I stick to the filet mignon because I like my steaks rare. And they do it right at Kevin Rathbun Steak. The inside is a deep, lovely red and the meat just melts in my mouth. It doesn't matter how much of the complimentary bread I've had, or how much of the appetizers I've gobbled, I will finish that steak. I may pop like a balloon on the way home, but that steak is leaving the restaurant in my belly and not a to-go box. My SO sticks to the ribeye and it is glorious. Because of the higher fat content, you want a ribeye no colder than medium rare, and on our last visit, my SO noted that medium would have allowed more of the fat to cook into the meat. Like I said, I want my steak mooing, which is why I don't choose the ribeye, even though it's amazingly delicious. I am content to sneak a couple of bites from my dude's. I have sampled the dry aged cowboy ribeye. It was fantastic. I don't think my palate is refined enough to really get the difference between this and the regular ribeye. Or it could be that I only had a small bite of the former. But in any case, certainly a good choice. Let's talk about sides. They come in adorable dishes and are meant to be shared. I loved the jalape√±o creamed corn, garlic spinach, risotto, scalloped sweet potatoes, creamed spinach, brussel sprouts, and the twice-baked potato (for which the toppings change daily I think). Actually, those are all of the sides I've ever had here. Sooooo I love them all, I guess is what I'm trying to say. Somehow, I manage to cram dessert in as well. Have not been disappointed. Except for when they told me they were out of the salted caramel bon bons. Sad sad sad. The creamy chocolate coffee bar, however, turned that frown upside down. And then some. If we weren't so stuffed, there probably would have been a fight over the last bite. Wine list is superb. Have only tried one cocktail, the Old Irv, and it was sublime. Guys, I think I'm running out of adjectives, so let me wrap up with some bullet points:- Service is what you'd expect at this price point, although we did wait a bit for our steaks the last time we were here. \\n- Tables surrounding the bar are first come, first served. \\n- There is a giant painting of Kevin Rathbun in the dining area to the right of the host station. It is truly a wonder to behold and everyone should bask in its glory at least once during their visit. \\n- My homeboy KR has two other restaurants/bars on Krog Street. This one is at the very end of Krog. You will dead-end into a parking lot. If you make any turns or if there is any drivable street left, you are not in the right place (however, I hear Rathbun's and Krog Bar are very good, if you want to just give up there).\\n- Also, you're going to have to valet your car. \\nAll I need to do now is figure out how to have enough money to eat here every night. In the meantime, I shall dream of you every night until we meet again, my dear Kevin Rathbun Steak."},{"name":"Studio Movie Grill","address":"3204 Margaritaville Blvd","city":"Kissimmee","stars":"3","text":"I have the SMG Monthly Access subscription where you can see up to 4 movies a month for $18.99, so i come to this location quite frequently.The theater, bathrooms, and bar area are always clean and it way less crowded than say the AMC at Disney Springs.Service at the bar area if you come early before your theater is open is good, but once you are in the theater it's definitely hit or miss.

As for the food, let me walk you through my courses & excuse any typos- my fingers are probably sliding all over the keyboard because I'm drooling from the memories:Appetizer:\\nArtichoke francois- 5/5. Gooey egg battered artichoke served in a delightful lemony sauce. Good lord. This stuff isn't even fair & I wouldn't even call myself a big fan of artichokes.Dinner:\\nAvgolemono Soup & Horiatiki - 5/5. I am a HUGE sucker for avgolemono soup (AKA that lemon chicken rice soup), and it was executed perfectly. The horiatiki had big, beautiful fresh chunks of tomato, cucumber, onions & peppers, and was topped with essentially a half block of feta and oregano. I  was  in  heaven . Dessert:\\nRight when I thought I couldn't possibly stuff any more food into my body, we made a play for the grapenut pudding and never looked back. They served it like a sundae with whipped cream & cinnamon. There were no grapenut survivors.All I will say is give yourself a break from the trendilicious downtown restaurants we all know & love & trek out to the suburbs for some top notch, North Shore Greek food."},{"name":"Taste of Peru","address":"9521 S Orange Blossom Trl, Ste 117 A","city":"Orlando","stars":"4.5","text":"No Yelp reviews?...

One bit of advice, don't order timidly here... The one dish we didn't like was a fried chicken breast with rice.

The location is nice, clean and brightly lit. I'm not sure if it's bc they recently opened and still need to work out kinks in service, but my most recent experience had me scratching my head.Upon arriving at 5:45 on a Friday, the place was pretty empty, which was awesome for me because I was starving. I ordered my pizzas and the lady on the line wasn't super friendly and was quite stingy with the toppings (never had that issue with the Buckhead location). She took a ONE piece of salami and HALF a piece of ham, which she broke up to spread out on the entire pizza. Once I paid, it was about 5:50PM. I grabbed a seat by the bar and waited for my name to be called. Somehow, it took almost 30 minutes for me to get my pizza, which is ridiculous considering the customer right before me got theirs about 5 minutes after they paid.  Oh in the process, they somehow lost and refound my pizza.  It's just disappointing as the Buckhead location typically has your pizza ready to go all within 10 minutes.

Every time I come to this wonderful hotel, which is located on Central Florida (aka an extension of John Young) a couple miles south of Pointe Orlando, I always have a great time.My most recent visit for a conference was great. While I didn't stay in one of their rooms this time (everything was mostly sold out for the golf tournament and other conferences, although a friend of mine was able to grab a room for an awesome staycation), I did utilize various parts of the hotel experience. Walking inside the JW is like walking into a palace. They have beautiful architecture with lots of large open areas both inside and out. After dropping my coat off at the coat check, I walked over to their main bar and was able to grab a beer while watching the NCAA tournament games on televisions that were spread out over a several hundred square foot area. While many hotel bars have bartenders just looking to make money, the bartenders at the JW were friendly and willing to talk to me about my beer and fun things to do around the hotel.After finishing up with part of my conference, I walked through their hallways to look at all their various restaurants and stores (they have a full Starbucks inside the hotel), and then proceeded outside into their beautiful open terrace area. They also had a lazy pool that looked like a blast. After grabbing a couple drinks on the terrace, I walked over to their sister hotel: The Ritz Carlton. The ability to walk back and forth between hotels either through a (mostly) enclosed walkway or via a beautiful scenic route near their lake and golf course is something I haven't seen anywhere else in Orlando.Overall, the JW Marriott down on the Grande Lakes property is a fantastic venue that provides an excellent experience for anyone who visits. Whether you are coming for a conference, wedding (I saw several), or just to take a break from life for a couple days, the JW Marriott is one of those places you should visit when you get the chance."},{"name":"Nori Nori","address":"6690 Roswell Rd, Ste 2110","city":"Sandy Springs","stars":"3.5","text":"Came here last Thanksgiving on Thanksgiving Day with family.

The service was solid as well, having multiple visits by the waiters, but this may be because the location was not huge and they were able to constantly check on the service and needs of the guest. \\nOn the cons side, the size that I just mentioned was not large or overwhelming, so a large party looking to eat might have to be flexible to an extent. The variety was also limited to seafood, so if you were to visit this place, you would definitely have to have a taste for seafood.

I went at 10am on a Monday and had trouble finding a place to sit.  They don't have a lot of seating and a big group would probably be impossible to accommodate.

I ain't complaining!PROS - Just like Chiang Mai, they serve Northern Thai cuisine. Which means, you won't find Pad Thai in their menu, but the owner ventures out into other Thai street food items that you don't see everyday in a regular Thai menu. I know I'm echoing Chiang Mai a bit, but at Pok Pok, there are dishes you can't find anywhere else.1. Fish Sauce Wings - Finger-licking good!  The servers know this too and equip you with some wet wipes for your fish sauce wing adventure happy time. I have had them regular and spicy. At $13.95, it's a bit steep for 6 wings, but it's a great treat. I order sticky rice on the side or I won't leave full :( Oh -- and they can't do half spicy and half regular for your fish wings order, I'm not sure why (\\"omg sauce confusion!!\\" cried the big boss, in my mind) but they sympathetically say no (as if they also think it should be possible, but cannot due to big boss).2. Boar Collar - Distinct tender meat...tastes like grade AA beef but with fresh spicy flavors served with mustard greens in case you wimp out (like me). I also order sticky rice with this since the boar sauce pairs nicely with the sticky rice.3. Khao Soi (I got it with beef) - Compared to Chiang Mai's super famous Khao Soi, Pok Pok's version is ridiculously smaller (forget about sharing!), oilier, less flavor and just not as good. Oh and they skimp on the side condiments that go with their Khao Soi...CONS - Spendy, smaller portions than your average Thai restaurant and obnoxiously crowded (I suppose this is a PRO for them) at peak lunch and dinner times. Expect at least a 30 min wait-time during rush hour. POINTERS - I admit those fish sauce wings have a hold on me, but that's because I can't find these wings anywhere else.

The breaded chicken is pan-fried crispy on the outside and tender on the inside. Liked the pairing with capers and a lemon-butter sauce.

Very unique dining experience (got to show off some art skills to my son while making him pancakes...and of course, I let him make some too). Other food was decent, not anything superb and out of the ordinary, but nothing less than what was expected either. The biggest thing that brings our experience down to four stars is the price. A bit on the pricey side, especially when we're just given raw ingredients and do the work ourselves :p. But we pay for the experience, I guess. Blueberries were super expensive and we were surprised how small quantity it came in ...could have purchased a whole pint or so outside). It's basically done Korean bbq style, grill in the middle, but for pancakes :D. Pretty kid friendly even though having a hot grill in the middle is not very kid friendly. They had toys in the front that kids can bring to the table to play with (a bit dirty, but nonetheless helped entertain the kids) and had ikea high chairs! So my tiny baby who doesn't usually fit in the regular wood high chairs stayed still in his chair this time. Staff was super friendly and inviting and didn't mind the tantrums nor the extremely loud laughter from our kids (sorry to everyone else there with us). A fun experience, wish there were more like this!

FOOD:\\n*Littleneck Clams ($1.50/each) - Delicious!  The clams were fresh and served on a halfshell.  Served with a cocktail sauce and vinegar sauce.  Hot sauce condiments are on the table for your disposal.*Crispy Oyster Slider ($4/slider) - So good that one didn't seem like enough.  The oyster was lightly breaded and served on a small brioche roll and topped with a bit of greens and a few dollups of lime chile aioli.*Fried Ipswich Cllams ($15/small) - A must order!  The clams had a nice crisp and served with tartar sauce.  The small was good enough for two of us to share as an appetizer.*Lobster Roe Noodles ($32) - Good.  By the time my entree came, I already loaded myself up with appetizers.  I loved the fettichini noodles and the sauce that added a tiny bit of sweetness to the dish.  The dish consisted of braised short rib, grilled lobster, oyster mushrooms, and brussel sprouts scatted around the dish.  The lobster was tender, but I wasn't a fan of the braised short rib which was a bit too stringy.SERVICE:\\nThey were nice, but it was busy and the essentials were often missing.  I was served my entree, yet I had to ask for a fork.  My friend didn't get tartar sauce with his fish and chips and had to ask a few times before receiving it.WHAT TO KNOW:\\n*Reservations are a must.  For same day reservations on a Wednesday, we were only able to get 5pm reservations.  Reservations can be done on opentable.com.\\n*If you're not a seafood person, there are a few meat options available\\n*Large restaurant - good for groups.

I regret going here, when I spent a good amount of money and there are other great places around. Will never go back. Details: Took 10 minutes just to get menus. The waiter arrived, short and curt asking what we wanted. I remember they had specials so I had to ask...guess it's a secret menu. After ordering and about 40 minutes later...we get our food and mine was so cold. I informed the waiter and he was clearly annoyed that I was bothering him with this. He asked, \\"What do you want me to do? Heat it up?\\" Ahh, yeaaa, that would be great. When he later returned with the re-heated food, he left in such a tiff that he didn't check to see if I had a fork, which I didn't. We tried to flag him down, but he was gone. We eventually realized that he was standing down the street (we we're eating outside), leaning against the building with his back to us. Luckily, there was a clean fork on the empty table next to us, which we were able to grab since we were unable to get our waiter's attention. I would have also loved to order another drink, but we never saw our waiter again. Later, another waiter came to clear our plates and brought us the check.

I had half an hour to order and I let the hostess know, and she was very accommodating and nice. She let our waitress know that we were in a rush so everything was expedited pretty quickly. I scanned the menu and settled on the business persons lunch. I thought it would be appropriate since they are always on the fly. I got the Papelbon sandwich, which was grilled steak with some cheese and bell peppers along with my cup of chowder. I had some great chowder the previous day at Quincy Market, so I needed another taste to compare. The sandwich came out hot and toasty, but the steak was a bit chewy; otherwise, it was pretty good. The chowder tasted very different from the previous day's. This one had an old chowder taste as if it was actually made from ye olde ingredients. I read that very traditional chowders are made from sea biscuits or hardtack as a thickening agent rather than flour. The crackers themselves look old and stale, which is what this chowder tasted like. It was a lot thicker and had more of that bread-like, stale taste rather than the fresh clam taste. Anyway, the meal took about twenty minutes to come out so I only had ten minutes to eat. I finished in five, paid the check, which was under $10 (not bad for a quick lunch at a bar), and quickly headed over for the tour. Not a bad place, but the food wasn't too impressive.

With about 8 tables, the line can easily go downstreet. The North End is replete with great Italian restaurants, some good, a few that are very good.   Why else is the Daily Catch so popular?  The seafood is fresh here and think it may be the draw.  The  dishes I sampled were testament: the fried calamari was choice,  the shrimp in the scampi were plump and clean tasting (yet lacking butter garlic flavor), the squid in the ink pasta was delicious and tender, the pasta slightly overdone.   I loved the garlic cooked with chopped squid tho, even though  the pasta was just ok.   Overall, I was yearning for something with umpf, the palate to the plates here was standard Italian-American, less daring  and does not approach what it could be were this  a restaurant in Sicily or any good resto in Italy,  a real barometer we should emulate.

Imagine food so awful, so insulting to anyone who has ever eaten and enjoyed a burrito, that when you stand up and throw it in the trash after three bites, people at nearby tables actually clap their hands in applause.Yes, my meal lasted exactly three bites. I wanted to ask for a refund after the first but I told myself, \\"Hey, this is food court food, don't be so precious, Chef Ramsey.\\" After the second bite, I nearly gagged on an uncooked chunk of onion in the salsa--salsa which I asked them not to include with my burrito. After the third bite, I began to feel sick and threw the rest of it in the trash. $11 down the drain. Not a very expensive meal in the grand scheme of things but you can actually get a sandwich, drink and chips at the Subway down the hall for $8.50 and finish your lunch without wanting to projectile vomit.They don't even know how to roll a burrito properly, which isn't exactly rocket science. This disgusting, putrid pile of waste exploded two bites in and spilled all over my hands and the table. Thank God they gave me a napkin with my meal. Yes, napkin, as in singular, not plural. Glory be.What else? I ordered a Coke with my burrito, which was 75% ice and 25% soda. I actually like a lot of ice with my drinks but I can't help but notice this is basically another way of defrauding the consumer.I don't want to end this review without commenting on the incompetency of the staff. The imbecile working the register said \\"Hey, it didn't go through, let me scan your card a second time.\\" So he did. When I got home two hours later and checked my balance, sure enough, I had been billed twice. Thankfully Bank of America has built in system checks to make sure their customers aren't being defrauded, so I got an instant refund, but this is yet another thing that screams \\"DON'T EAT HERE, EVER!\\"So there you have it: a $22 check for 8 oz of Coke and three bites of a burrito you couldn't feed to a seagull.Oh me.

Our server was absolute trash. We had a large group of maybe 18 people but only 6 ordered food so not too much to handle. Top that off with no other patrons in the there but us. Our group were literally the only guests in the entire restaurant. So there was no pressure on the cooks or the waitress as it was dead in there. It took her forever to offer drinks or hand out enough menus. We all ordered small amounts of wings and one side, not hard. I had the honey teriyaki wings which were good and hot, but the waffle fries were cold. I ordered 2 Tom Collins drinks with Tito's, the 1st one was super small like a large shot glass, and the second was watered down, so I was upset. We had to constantly flag her down for straws, refilling the empty paper towel on the table, dipping sauce, empty water glasses on the table we had to beg for as we were eating parched with since none of our drinks came out timely. None of that made any sense, again we were the only customers in the entire restaurant and she only had our table. Feeling so strongly about the service, my end of the table intended to tip her zero dollars. It has been years since I've tipped zero dollars for anything that requires someone to wait on me. That said, she saved herself the trouble because there were six of us eating and we each were charged a $5.22 server fee, and I'm assuming that's their form of gratuity. No one made a fuss about it but we were all pretty upset that she just earned a $31 tip she really did not deserve. For my tab, that was like a 15% tip.

The butter garlic sauce drenched over everything was soooo delicious. Probably not the best for those \\"New year new me\\" resolutions but I have no regrets. The  only thing I will say on the cons side of this place is the wait time. They cook your food to order so I knew it would be some time but the location is really small and really popular so those two things combined made for a very long wait time.

Let me tell you...that Naam Jiim sauce was a game changer and highly addicting!  If you're a fan of salty flavors, you'll love this one.  The fish was perfectly fried and each bite that was coated with the seafood sauce was divine.  (5/5)-Kung Op Wun Sen: Gigantic prawn cooked with bean thread noodles inside a clay pot with pork belly and served with the legendary Naam Jiim sauce.  This dish was also very delicious and the dish was bursting with flavors.  This dish can easily be shared among two people.  Highly recommend this dish as well.

If you read any Portland foodie press, you know you have to order Ike's Vietnamese wings and they didn't disappoint. And for the portion size (six large wings) and quality, I didn't mind paying the price. We also ordered another specialty, Kung Yak Phao (giant prawns), which are served whole with the shell and head. It generated the comment above, since my friend and I are both Jen Lancaster fans.

No one at the register and the same barista I've ordered from countless times (wears little beanie homeless dude looking hats, scruffy looking like he's desperately trying to grow a bear yet is struggling) is at the espresso machine steaming milk.I go to the corner and say, \\"Hey can I get a double.\\" Then I paused as I looked at the espresso options on the little sign and say, \\"The expranza please.\\"Then I walk away to get my stuff so it isn't left unattended as i move to my new location nearer. If you've yet to visualize the scene in your mind, here's the gist: I don't see the point in standing at the register and waiting for him to finish when he can get to my double anytime he can and I'll come up and pay when it's ready (as I did) so I just ask him for a double whenever he gets to it and I go get my stufff and move it to my new location. No rudeness, no impatience, just a simple double espresso request.He gives me my drink, I pay and say thanks. He say nothing. (In retrospect, he grabs it from the side of the register and moves it to me at counter, which is not standard as they normally place drinks on ledge by espresso machine. I now wonder if my shot was compromised.)20 minutes later, I'm working at my laptop in the corner facing the window. This barista has come to lean on the table next to me and asks me if I have a second. I take out my headphones and look up, trying to process what's going on.He says something to the effect of, \\"I've seen you be rude to other baristas, and I wanted to bring it to your attention because we don't want to encourage that kind of environment here.\\"I'm a little dumbfounded, and I ask him for specific examples, which he's unable to give me any. Then I say, \\"So you think how I just ordered from you was rude?\\"He says, \\"Yes, I thought it was very rude.\\"I told him I wasn't being rude, I was just ordering a double as a regular like I do often. He told me that if I was going to \\"raise my voice,\\" then he would have to ask me to leave.Of course, this is lol considering i wasn't raising my voice in the least. He must have expected me to just apologize instead of challenge his accusations.I told him I'll be leaving and won't be coming back. He said, \\"Ok.\\"I sat thinking about it for a few minutes and realized that the other barista that was there this day had also been staring me down quite a few times as he walked by. I'm mean, straight up mean-mugging me. I thought it was odd but just assumed that was his natural demeanor or something.Then I realized that they must have been gossiping about me and that's why now my innocuous request for a double was construed as \\"very rude.\\"Now, I know that testimony of a he said/she said exchange is rarely accurate. You might assume I was rude or curt with him. I assure you I was not. In fact, I've never been rude or short or curt with any of the staff there even though they've grown increasing unfriendly the more I've been a patron, most of whcih has been recently because I'm assuming someone said something and they all gossiped to each other about it (the way places like this do, especially places like this full of hipster chain-smoking douchers).The fact that he came from behind the counter to interrupt me to tell me how i ordered was rude was unprofessional and boarderline scrap worthy. They lost a customer for life, one that had redeemed at least 8+, likely more, of those free drink cards (buy 8 and get one free).Perhaps these baristas should get their heads out of their asses and realize that their job is to serve the customer not expect the customers to serve them.The owner needs to come in and manage these employees. My advice as a business owner is to focus on the culture and set some standards for greeting and interacting with customers.My advice as a customer is to fire this twerp and make sure none of your other employees think it's okay to confront customers, especially over something as trivial as, \\"a rude order.\\"And to that barista, grow a set and be a man instead of a sensitive silly nancy."},{"name":"Dot Cafe","address":"1459 Dorchester Ave","city":"Boston","stars":"4.5","text":"Dot Cafe is a great place for breakfast.

I'll go again because I got a gift card and had one really awesome experience, while the other two were mediocre.1st visit:\\nLarger group of seven people, one with food restrictions. It was a Friday, late afternoon, early November, and the restaurant was sufficiently filled. Many ordered the chicken cordon bleu and were very happy with it. I ordered the salmon burger and sweet potato fries, and I really enjoyed it! The service was great, and we all agreed we should return at a later date.2nd visit:\\nGroup of two, and I was with one of the same people who were part of the previous seven. It was a weekday, mid-afternoon, just around the holidays. There was a small function happening by us, but there weren't many in the restaurant. Service was extremely slow, and we had to ask for bread instead of it being offered to us. I actually wonder if there was a problem with our waitress because the manager had to stop by to see how we were doing. Anyway, the first basket of bread had a hair baked into one of the rolls. I know this can happen, and things far worse than we know happen in restaurants, but even with that incident, my friend and I always felt like an after-thought. My friend had the bread with the hair in it, so they took her plate and knife away, and we had to wait more than 5 minutes before someone was in the vicinity to ask them for a new silverware set. Had they been short staffed? We gave the benefit of the doubt and moved on. I got the salmon burger and sweet potato fries again, and the meal was still good, but some fries were a little burned. Again, fine, it happens. I just got extra ketchup.3rd visit:\\nGroup of two, very busy Saturday night (dinner to closing, and there was some sport game in the tv). I was with a new friend this time. We got the fried calamari app, which tasted okay. It didn't taste too oily, and it had a nice crisp, but it was pretty bland, and it needed more sauce than was offered. I don't like super salty things, but this dish needed a little more salt, maybe pepper or something, too. Anyway, my friend and I each ordered a steak and cheese sub. I forget what side he ordered, but I got the trusty sweet potato fries. All of the fries were burned, and that is no exaggeration! Literally every piece was burned, and I don't like to send things back or complain because of things I read, so I just left them all where they were. I was appalled they even served it, it was so apparently bad! Guess what...I found a long piece of dark hair in my mouth from the steak and cheese. I was really hoping it was my hair, but I wasn't at all confident it was, as I don't typically find a whole hair in my mouth if I bite my own for any reason. I didn't want to make a scene, so I just spit out the bite, and I stopped eating. I took the leftover sub home because it was most of it and I was already wasting a whole side of fries. I warned my husband about the hair situation, and he's less squeamish about that stuff, so he had it. Oh yea, and neither my friend nor I, nor my husband later, were particular fans of their version of the steak and cheese. It was so bland tasting, just cheesy meat and fillings, but lacking any sort of discernable flavor, other than maybe a sprinkle of salt? I didn't know I was pregnant at the time, but I was, and that's when taste buds are heightened. Well, even with heightened taste buds, the flavor just wasn't there that day. At least the service was okay (still a little slow, but we were in no rush), and the server was very kind."},{"name":"Summer Moon Coffee - Buda","address":"316 N Main St","city":"Buda","stars":"4.5","text":"I absolutely love this place, their coffee, the coffee bar located in Austin, and their entire philosophy. We were driving back from San Antonio and my boyfriend mentioned that he was thinking about going to the Cabela's outpost that is in Buda. I told him there was a coffee place there that I had been wanting to go to and it was settled. We needed coffee and to do a little retail shopping.The place is tucked into what looks like a city center. It's cute and welcoming. Frequenting the Austin location means I know what I am getting (a half wintermoon iced latte) and a latte for him. They have shirts by the register and sell their coffee on shelves inside. I grabbed the one they use to make their coffee, Velvet Blaze. I generally like stronger coffee tempered with cream and sugar. I grew up drinking Vietnamese coffee and if you've ever had it, you know it's very strong yet sweet. What can I say, I know what I like.The barista was really nice and helpful. The coffee, delicious as usual. I love this place and can't for the life of me believe that this place isn't as popular as Cuvee or Blue Bottle. I know I'm not a coffee expert (I know a few though) and maybe my tastes aren't on a more \\"elite\\" level when it comes to judging good quality coffee. I love this place's philosophy though and their passion is evident. The barista asked me what kind of coffee maker I had and ground the coffee to the specification necessary to best enjoy its flavor (french press). These people are passionate and it's good to be in their company."},{"name":"Shigezo Izakaya","address":"910 SW Salmon St","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"I love sushi so naturally I try a lot of places in town.

But once I came here myself, I had to confirm it. The place is extremely bad.The theme of the restaurant was \\"New Orleans\\" and when I stepped in, it reminded me of Crab Pot, which is VERY popular in USA. I really don't like this mix of their theme. I think they should just consider the same theme.The service is not the best. Their operations is lacking experience. The host is also the waiter, and he is learning how to make drinks AT THE SAME TIME. The operations in the whole restaurant is just lacking, period. The service is slow, the menus were not taken away, there was no water served (the whole time we were there), the food was slow, the drinks were slow, some of the food was not available (which really puts me down, a lot especially when it's on their menu). The service just flopped. They need experienced operational staff there.The food is just terrible. We ordered the oysters, tuna poke, crawfish, and a ceasar. I am going down every little detail of the food.\\nOysters were not perfectly shucked. There was pieces of stone and shell in the oyster. I said to myself, okay the first one had it, that's fine, I let it go, but on the 4th and the 5th one as well? I might as well go into the kitchen and do it myself.... But the only thing was that the oysters were fresh, you can taste it.\\nThe Tuna poke was too small of a dish to even feature, it is just not good. Two chips with a little bits of tuna, and the dish was not appealing to look at. I was just UGH when I looked at the plate.\\nThe ceasar was terrible as there was no lime taste in it at all, the drink colour was very bright pink, no pepper taste at all, and the salt around the rim is white. That is not how you make a cesar, I felt like it was my mom who was in the kitchen making every single dish, with half par effort.\\nThe only dish that I liked was the crawfish. It needed to be more spicier, and there was just garlic at the bottom of the bowl.\\nI didn't feel like there was a proper chef in the kitchen. I felt like I should have just gotten back there and made everything myself.In the end, the food was atrocious, the drink did not make me buzzed, and the service was bad.

Vegan and vegetarian food options that are not only very healthy, but delicious as well.  In general, it's not the typical fast food vegetarian offerings.  My favorite menu items are the Goddess, the Lover, the Fool and the Rebel.....so most of the menu.        As far as beverages, I tend to go with the smoothies, though I've also had a few juices as well.  It's nice to find a juice bar that uses fresh and (mainly) organic fruits/veggies rather than fruit/veggie packaged juices, with added sugar and preservatives.  One of the first things you will notice when entering Life Alive is the stack of fresh vegetables for juicing.  That is a good sign from the start.  For smoothies, it is my understanding that all but one are vegan, which sounded too good to be true, but is.  My favorite is the Elvis Alive (and not for the name).  Others have complained about the price, but I think this is what you should expect for fresh, natural food.  You definitely will notice a difference in quality and taste when eating here.  Sure, you could save a few dollars going to a \\"faster\\" food place, but you'll also sacrifice in taste.  Plus, by supporting a business like Life Alive it helps increase the possibility that future restaurants will follow in a similar fashion, which is good for all of us.  I would add that the staff all seem cheerful and committed to their work.  I definitely appreciate the atmosphere, especially the recently opened downstairs seating.

The ones I like the best are squarish and cut from a pan - different but delicious!Ham & Swiss - so good. The dough is fresh, soft, a hint of sweetness - the diced ham and swiss cheese is abundant in this, almost baked into it but not - its hard to describe. The ratio of breading to filling is perfect, the swiss cheese is so creamy. Absolute perfection and probably my favorite one I have tried here.Bacon & Cheese - pretty dang good too. There is alot of diced up bacon and cheddar cheese. I think I just prefer the swiss cheese in the ham one better, but this is delicious all the same.Jalepeno Sausage & Cheese - the sausage in this one is huge and surrounded by that scrumptios breading.  Very good!Fruit Kolaches - I have tried a few different ones; Cream cheese, Apricot, and a Berry one. I loved them all, the filling and breading ratio, as with the savory ones - perfect. The filling delicous and not overly sweet, it compliments that soft breading well.  My favorite so far for the fruit ones is the apricot!The customer service is generally good here. It's a small Mom and Pop shoppe for sure and you can taste the love they have for their product. I have seen reviews state that these are not traditional - well, a real traditional kolache are the fruit ones - not those round ones made at the chain places - and they sell these. Another thing to consider, a true kolache is only fruit filled ones and the ones with meat - savory - are actually called klobasneks which originated by Czech immigrants that settled in Texas. Like so many foods we eat - originated from other countries but \\"Americanized\\"I have seen reviews complaining about not having vegetarian options - fruit kolaches do not contain meat -_-There really isnt too much seating here but thats fine with me because I like to take mine to go.  They have their day old selection but they do not taste a day old and the price is reduced - recommend for sure!  There is a large variety of sweet pastries as well and cookies.  The reason for 4 (no option for 4.5) stars is because last time I came and got a bag of the day old fruit kolaches, I was charged a lot less than this time for the same product.  Also, about a month ago I tried to stop in on a Saturday about 11:45 am and they just closed up as I was walking to the door and the sign reads they are open until 2.

I've been to their Stoneham location and absolutely enjoyed their delicious jambalaya, so I decided to try their shrimp po' boy here, which was JUST as good. It consisted of bite-sized, deep fried shrimp with lettuce, onion, and tomato. The finishing touch? A zesty sauce drizzle. It came with a side of Cajun fries (you can also opt for regular fries, too). I enjoyed this meal so much!!! The shrimp additions were super flavorful and not too crispy. The vegetable add-ons tasted fresh and the plentiful sauce was a great touch. It definitely added an oomph to each bite. The Cajun fries were out-of-this world good! There was a perfect amount of heat and spice to 'em and needed no ketchup or dips because you'd just mask the flavor. Everything was so filling!They also have sides, dessert, fried baskets, and seafood boils. I'd definitely stop by here again to try something else (or just get the shrimp po' boy again, tbh).

The chicken was grilled and roasted nicely, especially the skin, which was super tasty and ever-so-slightly crispy - plus there were multiple pieces of it too. If this wasn't already sufficient for my ever-voracious appetite, the sticky rice and papaya salad were more than enough to stuff me silly. Service is generally fast and efficient once you sit down, although it might take a while to clear empty tables and get folks moving in and out. There's plenty of room on the outdoor patio, which is nice on a warm summer day, and there also appeared to be more room inside.

I really like the simple white color scheme they have that mixes well with the small hints of purple furniture. Straight to the right of the entrance there is a small bench to take a nice IG photo with what I can assume is their motto in big black letters. Since we were quite stuffed we decided to share a dessert and ordered the 3 dessert combo they have consisting of 2 mangoed out desserts and 4 mango skin crepes. You might be thinking that's too much mango and I did too. But once you have that first bite of dessert you become mango obsessed. Now there suddenly isn't enough mango! Everything tasted great and when we were done we wished we didn't split it. The prices here are kinda of high, it's about $7 for a mango sundae of your own and our combo meal was around $20 I believe. But this is honestly nothing to consider once you have that first bite.

Reasons why it took me a few tries...\\n--I had to learn what I really liked. I was not used to the vegetarian fare variety. Once i did, it was all over. \\n--I am used to getting more food for my buck...typical american. But once i started taking my time with my meal, i felt more full and felt MUCH better than if i had over-eaten. \\n--Getting used to the \\"vibe\\". Friendly staff, lots of plants, dishes named \\"the goddess, the swami\\", colorful paintings on the walls, the \\"lounge scene\\" downstairs. Now I adore it. More specifics regarding the food...you can sub in and out different things...for instance, i usually sub out tofu (-$1) and sub in avacado (+1.50)...i don't think you can do more than three, but it is AMAZING because you can craft your dish exactly how you want. You can also ask for carrots and beets shredded instead of diced, which I think flows better in the bowls. Oh, and I highly recommend the bowls over the wraps. If you like a particular sauce (nudge nudge the ginger nama sauce) you can get that on your dish even if it doesn't come with it. The salads are amazing as well...try the ginger nama on it!Lastly, I have to say that even though I don't feel stuffed (which i now consider a good thing) after eating, I feel GOOD...energized in a sense...which i would much rather feel than a heavy feeling, a feeling likei need to walk off the meal, exercise, lie down and take a nap, etc...that is the other best part about eating here besides the tastiness of the food (the greens and sauces are amazing in case I didn't mention that).

I went to studio 27 for the first time several months ago. I wasn't expecting to be blown away, but I was expecting, at the very least, given its good reputation, location and price, to have an experience average or above. I found it to be overrated and well below average. The beginning was great. Time of appointment: 3:00 greeted kindly by part -owner who even took my coat. He spent his time upstairs and I think if he knew more of what happened downstairs in the basement where you get your hair done, he would be frankly appalled.\\n1. Washing debacle: Time of wash eventual was 3:45. I was bumped several times from the wash station as if other clients heads were more important.  I have never had anything like this happen to me before. I was told to move chairs literally I counted 4 times. At first  Michele -not a stylist-Detangled my  natural hair when dry. This was a painful experience and I could tell she did not understand my hair texture at all I asked her to stop. After afew more bumps from the wash station and still no wash 40 mins later. I was really confused and finally figured out that they had \\"no hot water.\\" I was not told this up front, instead when I finally got to the wash station she spent wayyyyy too long on the shampoo scrubbing  without water to just stall and I asked her up front \\"uhh what's going on, is there no water?\\"  Well it turns out that during my wash I had waited so long to receive another client had sat in the wash station next to me and started using the hot water and so we had to suddenly stop our wash mid wash, as if my head was a second class head!! And so after she was done the only option was freezing cold water.  So I told her to just please use the freezing cold water instead of me waiting whilst she aimlessly stalled and scrubbed my now very clean head. . I didn't appreciate why they wouldn't just tell me this up front from the beginning... or why I kept being bumped from my place for a simple wash. The whole thing was like a mystery that I had to work out and finally when I figured it out and allowed her to just use the freezing cold water, I could move on with the whole dragged on process..  I'm not sure why no one waited for me or offered for me to finish my quick wash or rinse process. I think I waited for 3 clients to be finally washed with ice cold water before I finally was washed at 3:45 by someone who seemed very uncertain about my hair texture, and who was very uncertain about what she was doing and kept asking questions about how to apply the deep conditioner, which left me feeling even more uncertain. Also they started boiling water for another client after I was done which she should have been offered to me. Maybe it's because I'm a student but i felt like a second class citizen at studio 27. They should treat all people with basics kindness and respect. I was shocked by the lack of basic standards here. Also hot water is such a basic necessity for a salon, let alone a Boston 5 star one to have in 2019.\\n2. After my quick 15min deep condition--also they forgot to turn on the steam for the deep condition until I asked if the thing was on---and a rinse with cold water. I was given a cap to sit and wait a while for a twist out to be completed- this was another client who had come in after me, but I guess there was a misscheduling because she was now having her hair done  before me with trudy.\\n3. Over 2hours after my original appointment time and only an easy wash and deep condition done, around 5:30  I finally got to speak more with my stylist. I'd originally wanted a wash trim and perm rod set but I'd been waiting for too long so changed my mind to do a trim, blow dry and press which I knew would be quicker. Trudy was very kind once I finally got to her chair but I'd just taken so long to get there and was frankly exhausted. She apologized and said they had her triple scheduled her  or something but I  didn't understand why I was the one who was continually bumped despite the earlier appointment tine.. maybe they don't care as much about new clients. Trudy had to re-rinse out my deep condition at the back, but was kind and professional about it and was sympathetic to how long I had been waiting for her to do something quite simple. I canceled my evening plans and finally finished at 6:40.Studio 27 sent me running back to my former salon, where  I get in and washed --without being passed around--by my actual stylist, within 5 mins of entering and with hot water at my appointment time. Out of 4 salons I've been to in MA, this is the only one that I did not like and can never go back to. This is my first negative review of any salon, actually my first negative yelp review in history. I'd advice students and newcomers to go elsewhere for much better service at a fraction of the cost."},{"name":"True Food Kitchen","address":"222 West Ave","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"Their website describes them as a \\"passionate collective of accomplished chefs, visionary restaurateurs and a renowned doctor of integrative medicine, who believe delicious dining and conscious nutrition can go hand in hand, without sacrificing flavor, creativity or indulgence.\\" We were sold and couldn't wait to check it out on our trip to Austin, Texas.

I don't think I'm the only one who has noticed that this Starbucks is slow because on a really slow wait time of 20 minutes usually the person in front of me or in back comment on how slow it is every time they come in.I could understand if a bus load of people came in and there were only 2 staff on but this is not the case."},{"name":"Moonshine Patio Bar & Grill","address":"303 Red River St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"I'm usually not one to pick a bar/grill for dinner but after seeing that Moonshine Patio Bar & Grill is the most reviewed place in Austin, we decided to stop by for a quick bite. The restaurant was actually much larger than I expected with a bar inside & outside (on the patio but still \\"indoors\\") along with additional seating in both places.The wait for a table was about 45 minutes so we decided to head down to the patio bar. If you're looking for something a bit quieter, I would recommend this space. It's fairly small so seating is a little difficult to find, but it was faster for us to get a high top there than wait for a table.We were quite hungry from having walked around all day and were told the sandwiches are large. I ordered the Backyard Chicken (pepper jack, avocado, poblano, onion, tomato, lettuce, BBQ sauce & mayo) and my husband ordered the Tender Belly (pork 3 ways, grain mustard, beer cheese, & pickle on a pretzel bun). As promised, the sandwiches were very large & delicious. The chicken had a good flavor and I enjoyed the subtle spice from the poblano pepper & the mayo (I ordered extra of this as a dip for my fries since it wasn't just plain mayo .. yum!). My husband enjoyed his meal as well, it was definitely a lot of meat with the pork 3 ways. It had a bit of smokey flavor from the pork & the mustard was complementary to that. Both items were very filling.Service at the bar was good. There was steady traffic & the bartenders were making drinks & helping customers quickly. Overall, a good choice for dinner. I would just make sure to give yourself plenty of time if you're waiting for a table or check the two bars for open seating. And an additional note - from what I hear, they have a pretty impressive brunch buffet on the weekend. Not certain on the details (cost, what they have, etc) but if we had more time, we would've probably gone there."},{"name":"Powell's City of Books","address":"1005 W Burnside St","city":"Portland","stars":"5","text":"Easily one of the best bookstores I have ever been to.

It is that magical.They also have cute novelty items and trinkets all around the store to check out. I wish I had more time to spend here (and the luggage space).

The charred avocado salad was also delicious, especially if you enjoy Asian food that uses fresh herbs. It has mint leaves and cilantro in the cucumber \\"noodles,\\" and is super flavorful and refreshing. The flourless chocolate cake was great, the warm cake and cold ice cream a perfect balance of sweetness (and the cocoa nibs provided a nice crunch).Skip ordering the edamame dumplings (the filling is not very flavorful and the broth is so-so) and the spaghetti squash casserole (aside from the cheese on top, this was just an average dish at best).Service:\\nFriendly and attentive, without being overbearing.

I was totally not in the mood for fast food breakfast so at first, after passing TSA and going across the monorail to head to my gate; I was adamant to find a Starbucks near my gate.  Turns out, I found something even better than Starbucks because I found this place.  This place is inside Orlando International Airport in between Gates 10-19 so if you're in this vicinity and want a nice Spanish breakfast that tastes homemade from your Spanish Grandmother's kitchen, then this it.  And if you don't have a Spanish Grandma, it's all good; try it anyway.  Considering that I had an early morning flight where foot traffic is high and the line was long; I got my food in 5 minutes after I ordered.  I ate a deliciously warm Cuban Sandwich with ham, eggs, melted Yellow American Cheese on a Cuban Bread toasted in a flat griddle along with a NesQuik Chocolate Milk (my childhood revisited me when I ate this sandwich so the Chocolate Milk was a must lol) and who doesn't love Chocolate Milk from NesQuik????The bread was toasted with a crunch in the outside, nice and warm on the inside, the ham was well fried as well as the egg and who doesn't love smothered melted Yellow American Cheese on their sandwiches????The environment is loud but take in consideration that you're in an airport so it's no fault of their own.  Now, you may wonder why I'm glowing in this review, yet I gave it 4 stars out of five?  Simple....everything costs more in the airport and you might frown on the $9.00 I paid for the sandwich and Chocolate Milk so their price became the victim of airport eateries and high real estate that forces the price to spike.But think about it, would you prefer paying $9.00 on the typical Burger King Breakfast or a Cinnamon Bun at Cinnabon or would you pay $9.00 for a breakfast that tastes like it came out of your grandma's kitchen on a Saturday morning?  Yes, Zaza wins.  Nonetheless, if you're at the airport, are in Gates 10-19 and you want something to eat knowing prices are higher, this is the place you should go.  Same prices are its fast food neighbors but they're not a fast food restaurant, they're a Cuban Cafe.And for the record, I'm a Puerto Rican who will never reject a Spanish eatery because all Spanish joints are similar.  While it was a Cuban sandwich, it tasted like my Puerto Rican grandma's breakfast cooking and that will always put a smile on my face.Happy Friday and Happy Eating guys.

Their polenta was made with chicken broth.  I was bummed about that one.I got the vegetarian meatball smash sandwich.  It was good, but upon picking up the sandwich, oil just poured out of it.  I applied a small amount of pressure to grasp the sandwich and pick it up, and at least 1 tablespoon of oil came pouring out of the sandwich.  I lived in San Diego for most of my life.  I am no stranger to greasy food (hellooooo taco shops), but this was something else.  It's almost as if they dipped the bread in oil before giving it to me.  It was kind of strange.  I love olive oil.. but this was too much.The thing we got from eating here is that they are taking whatever they can, rolling it into a ball, and calling it a meatball.The owner is a sweetheart and I feel bad not being able to give this place 5 stars, but I'm Italian and my dad owned Italian restaurants when I was growing up.. so I know Italian food.I would come back, but only if they started using Gardein vegetarian meatballs instead of the house made, or as another option.

First, the location is perfect, right in the same center as Alamo Drafthouse and Vox Table, so there is plenty of garage parking along with valet service. The interior itself is sophisticated, sleek, and dimly lit. The tables are arranged in a well spaced out dining room so that you're not too close to your neighbors which makes this an excellent date night spot. The service is impeccable - our server was well-versed in every dish on the menu, well spoken, and extremely nice and professional. My friend and I made reservations at the sushi bar. I love the layout of the sushi bar here - the seats are set back far enough from the chefs so that you can have a private conversation but still see the action. As for the food: oh boy. My friend ordered the tasting menu, a whopping 18 courses with a variety of their best dishes and desserts. Fortunately I had the pleasure of trying a few of those dishes, including the Uni Pasta and the green tea mousse dessert, both incredible. For myself I ordered the miso soup, seared salmon belly sashimi, Dragon Maki rolls, shrimp & vegetable tempura, and the seared moulard duck breast. The standouts for me were definitely the Maki rolls (best rolls I've ever had from anywhere) and the duck, which was served inside a red delicious apple with a sweet sauce that paired perfectly with the fattiness of the duck. Each dish was served on a beautiful, Instagram worthy plate. Come to Soto for an impeccable dining experience that you won't soon forget. The sushi combined with their unique dishes from the kitchen make for an outstanding menu that I'd love to return to and enjoy again and again."},{"name":"Life Alive","address":"765 Mass Ave","city":"Cambridge","stars":"4.5","text":"I came here once awhile ago for a meeting of my book club, and was pleasantly surprised by the bowl I got.

I ended up at Thunderbird, which was recommended to me by the friend I was staying with, when I needed to kill some time while waiting for her to become available. It was a nice place to spend an hour or so due to the relatively quiet atmosphere and the interesting drinks.During my visit to Thunderbird, I ordered a violet lemonade due to my love of all things purple, including lavender. The most unique characteristic of the drink is its vivid violet color (see photo). While I expected the drink to *taste* violet-y, I wasn't expecting it to *look* violet. If I was blind and wasn't able to see it's beautiful color, however, I'm sure I could have guessed it by the taste alone, which was lavender-y, but not overpoweringly so.The barista who made my drink was friendly and happy to elaborate on its composition, which I appreciated. The atmosphere was quiet and serene, with a few small groups and various individuals working on laptops. One thing that was rather challenging was the parking situation--I had to drive all the way around the block to find the lot, which was full due to its small size. Because the business across the street doesn't allow Thunderbird's customers to park in their lot, I ended up parking on the residential street beside the cafe.Overall, I had a good experience at Thunderbird and would definitely return for another violet lemonade--or other drink--when in Austin."},{"name":"Toichi Ichiban Japanese Cuisine","address":"5 Kendall St","city":"Brookline","stars":"4","text":"0.5 star- ambiance.

They had things like sweet potato breakfast bowls, to healthy greek salads, classic panini pressed sandwiches and, something I haven't seen, a yogurt bar that served not only sweet, but savory options to try out. If it wasn't a very cold day, I'd dare try a savory yogurt bowl. But I hadn't had breakfast yet, and the sweet potato bowl paired with a gluten-free cranberry muffin and an almond milk matcha latte sounded like it might warm my soul.

The matcha latte wasn't too sweet, the gluten-free cranberry was very moist, and the bowl was flavorful and filling.

I'm angry, obviously because no one is trying to make this right, and the guy tried to tell me I've changed my story. Began yelling at me and telling me they won't be refunding me because their product was perfect (even though I told him I bit into the chicken and it was raw). He told me I would just have to order something else. So... I'm disputing the charge with my credit card company and never ordering from these people again.

It is quite near regal cinemas though, so maybes a great dinner + movie combo. Fun atmosphere: Check. Atmosphere like a less stuffy Sel de la Terre, Burton's is a mix of old steakhouse and yuppie martini bar. Plus they have circle tables for the groups, and I love circle tables.Good prices: Check. Everything is pretty much is the sub-$20 category. Good food: Double Check. Great selection, and great food. We started with a selection of salads--I went for the beet salad. Great blend of creamy goat cheese, toasty walnuts and flavorful beets. Next up was entree. We tried the shrimp and lobster pasta, the chicken and wild mushroom ravioli, scallops (me), Burton's burger and Tuscan brick chicken.  All were absolutely delicious and we cleaned out plates. None of us went there intending to get dessert, but once we heard about the choices we had to try a few.

I chose where I'm going to live, partly based on the availiblity of good books close by. So, when I moved to Portland I was almost as excited about Powell's as I was about the Multnomah County library. After many visits to Powell's, I can't decide how I truly feel about it.Pluses- This is the biggest non Borders or Barnes and Noble books store I have ever seen. Just the amount of sections they have is enough for me to quit my job and move into the Powell's bathroom. I love that I can get pretty much anything I set my mind on at any time. I have had conversations or asked for help from around a half a dozen different employees, all of which left me more than satisfied. One time a dude actually spent a half an hour, crawling and climbing around all sorts of places looking for the book I was looking for- in the end he actually found it. I've also heard that the employees get promoted based on the knowledge the have of the section they work in, which I find believable and completely amazing.Minuses- I've noticed that, considering what  a well read city Portland is, there aren't many independent book stores. I don't know if Powell's got the stronghold on the reading crowd by doing a great job of stocking books or from Barnes and Noble tactics of purposefully going after the indies. Either way, I don't like it. I think the prices are a bit high on their used books- most used book stores sell their used book at half the price of what's printed on the book, while Powell's seems to be between 60 and 75%. Finally, my least favorite thing is the way the mix the used books in with the new. I tend to only buy new books if something amazing just came out (like Junot Diaz or Lidia Yuknavich) and don't enjoy spending hours trying to figure out which books are used and which aren't.All in all, in the 9 months I lived in Portland (during which time I bought around 5 or 6 books per month) 80% of my book buying occurred at Powell's, so I guess it isn't too bad."},{"name":"Commonwealth Restaurant and Market","address":"11 Broad Canal Way","city":"Cambridge","stars":"3.5","text":"I was back in Cambridge for work and stopped in for lunch.

And to be fair, it's based on one visit.  \\nI was one of a party of 6 that came here a couple of Saturday nights ago.The space is cavernous but really cool in soaring modern design.  I particularly liked the back wall which is  filled with oyster shells as a design element.  \\nBut the high ceilings and the vast main dining room  make it hard to hear and not enough attention it would seem, was paid to the acoustics. I kept craning my neck to hear my friends sitting across from me. \\nThere is a high energy vibe here which is compelling, but when it's hard to hear it quickly becomes annoyoing.We started with a few dozen oyster platters of various kinds served on trays of ice.  I've yet to meet a fresh, cold oyster I didn't love and these were no different.  What I don't get here on the East Coast in particular is why they are so pricey. For some each oyster was $3.50.  Ouch.  But nevermind, our table was in a festive mood and we ate our fill.Less successful was my lobster roll.  I don't eat these often but when I do, I expect that they will be honored in being cooked perfectly. You're certainly paying for a divine experience.   This was overdone and rubbery; the roll it came in, was uninspired and left uneaten.  Others in our party ordered various fish dishes like the Idaho red trout, the Virginia striped bass with shiitake mushrooms and a more local offering, the Scituate scallops.   I noted that everyone finished  their plates but I don't recall anyone exclaiming about the food unless over the din, I just didn't hear them.  .The wine list was good and my wine connoisseur friend ordered a couple of tasty bottles of white and a couple of reds for the table.  The wait service was attenitve and it seemed someone, not always just our waiter, was ever present for us.  Our waiter brought our table a platter of smoked trout with walnut pesto and rye crisps, on the house.  This was delicious.\\nAt the end of our meal, our waiter brought each of us a glass of port, also on the house.\\nNot sure what prompted these freebies but they were appreciated.Alas, good service and fabulous albeit pricey oysters still don't make a 5 star experience given some of the other negatives.\\nI had great fun with my pals, and enjoyed the exuberance of this place, but I'm not rushing back.  Given just how crowded this place was even for our 9:30PM  reservation, there are enough patrons that they won't miss me.  Others clearly love this place more than I did."},{"name":"Pok Pok","address":"3226 SE Division St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"I generally break down my restaurant experiences into three categories: (1) atmosphere/decor; (2) service; and (3) food. Pok Pok excels in the last category. In fact, some of their signature dishes were absolutely delicious. But the other two factors for me, and the overall experience, were a bit of a letdown.We arrived for a late dinner on a Saturday evening and were told that the wait would be about 2 hours. Using the NoWait app to check our spot in line, we did a little shopping and walking and came back when there were only a few people left ahead of us. We were then kept waiting for another hour, and were seated at about 10:00 PM after a 3 hour wait. I am always polite to restaurant staff, but the hosts were much more surly than they deserved to be when we asked about our table (we were the ones waiting outside in the rain, after all). Finally, we were shown to a table near the front of the restaurant, where our waiter was much friendlier and gave generally excellent service the whole meal.The decor here is awful. I guess the theme is supposed to be \\"generic beach shack\\"? Aluminum picnic tables, bare light bulbs, and plastic tarp walls. In my opinion, \\"cheap\\" is not the same as \\"authentic.\\" On this particular night, the inside of the restaurant was just like the outside but with less rain: cold, humid, and loud, and it dampened our enjoyment of the food.The food was mostly (but not entirely) really good, and the \\"hits\\" were spot-on delicious. We started with the famous fish sauce wings, which were perfectly cooked, tender, and well-seasoned. Would highly recommend these. The appetizer was so good that it set a very high bar for the rest of the meal. I had the boar collar entree, which came out cold (why?!?) but SO juicy and delicious, with an addictively good lime-garlic sauce on the top. It is worth noting that this dish is much smaller than you'd expect -- maybe 3 oz. of meat? You'll want to order something additional. If it weren't for small size and the odd cold temperature of the meat, this entree would have been the star of the show. I also tried the khao soi (curry noodle soup), but was more disappointed. It was average at best -- bland and a little watery, without much of note. I'd suggest trying a different curry dish.One additional note: food prices here are generally pretty reasonable for the quality and/or quantity. No complaints there.Overall, Pok Pok is the kind of restaurant I'd visit only if the wait time is 0-15 minutes and the weather outside is nice (because thanks to the plastic tarp walls, the weather outside is also the weather \\"inside\\").

I can say here gives me Taiwan Homey Feel.I ordered to go the first time, love their reusable containers that safe to put in microwave and I can use it again at home. I dined in the second time, even there were only 6 tables inside and some outdoor seatings, it's pretty quiet. Here what I ordered:1. Lu Rou Fan Bian Dang (Braised Pork Belly Over Rice Meal Box), every Meal Box served with minced pork over steamed rice, noodles, braised egg and seasonal veggies! \\n~ The minced pork was seasoning just like Taiwan, steamed rice was soft and hot, braised egg and braised pork belly were a bit dry but tasty. OH the noodles and seasonal veggies were to die for!!! Overall, Good. 2. Dou Fu Gan Lu Wei (Braised Dry Tofu)\\n~ Lu Wei is a traditional style food in Taiwan, may not have a strong taste for westerners but once you try it, you may like it. This Tofu tasted a little blend for me, maybe I become Westerner already. HAHA3. Niu Rou Tang Mian (Spicy Beef Noodle Soup), MUST TRY\\n~ If you want to know the taste of Taiwan, TRY THIS. The spices and seasonings they used in the soup were identical as in Taiwan. Beef was tender, noodle was just right. LOVE THIS! 4. Oyster Omelet\\n~ The traditional way to make Taiwanese Oyster Omelet is to add potato starch for special texture. With the hot sauce on top, it's just like home taste. Good, I like this! 5. Mi Fen Chao (Taiwanese Rice Noodles, Minced Pork, Carrots, Bamboo Shoots, Cabbage, Celery, Fried Shallot, Cilantro)\\n~ OMG, they provide this in meal box and it's SO GOOD, so I ordered it separately this time for a full meal. Al Dente texture with perfect seasoning. Remember Mi Fen has to be dry and Al Dente. MUST TRY!6. Taiwanese Shrimp Fried Noodles\\n~ Love they made it fresh with Wok and provided Wok Hei, it's crucial for Chinese to cook food in a wok, you can tell the difference. However, it's not specifically for my taste. If you want Taiwan homey feel on Orlando, you have to come here. The owner's so caring and friendly.

After \\"Jafar\\" mismanaged his reservation list, we were seated nearly 40 minutes after our reservation time.

A little bit of disorganization can be forgiven, however, the rude demeanor of \\"Jafar\\" cannot. While we were sitting at our table, I noticed him pointing at my family, rolling his eyes, and talking smack to the other employees. He then proceeded to annoy our table by sending himself and his employees over to our table to continuously ask us if we were done, even though we still had full glasses of wine and had already paid. It was an intentional act to boot us out of the restaurant. Had there been another group waiting for our table, we would have been considerate and left so they could turn the table; however, it was well after the dinner rush and there were no other tables waiting to be seated.

Growing up in a fishing village on the coast of North Carolina, my dad would go to the fish house and grab dinner off the conveyor belt as it was being unloaded from the fish boats that had just docked.  He would take his \\"catch of the day\\" home, wrapped in old newspapers, and head back to the old tree stump at the far end of our property where he had run a cold water line.  He would scale the fish, then head it and gut it, leaving these parts for the feral cats that lived in the woods.  In it would go where my mom would do her magic.  Flounder is my favorite and generally all mom would do was to shake a little salt and pepper on it, lightly dredge it in flour and then plop it into the the big cast iron frying pan where hot melted butter was waiting for it.  Out would come some of the most remarkable fish you could ever have.So when I go to a reputable, higher end seafood restaurant, especially here in Atlanta and see flounder on the menu, my mouth starts watering.Last week, better half and I went with friends, who have pretty discriminating tastes, to C&S Seafood on Cobb Parkway.  They arrived earlier than us and had grilled oysters, which they said were extremely good.  The main reason we were late is that we literally had to park in another shopping center's parking lot after spending fifteen minutes trying to find a parking spot in the restaurant's shopping center lot.  Our self proclaimed, new waiter, took 15 minutes to get our drink orders, another 15 minutes to bring them, and I had to chase him down to come get our dinner orders.The food was delivered promptly and was freshly cooked. HOWEVER, one look at my fish and it was clear that it was not flounder.  I mentioned this to the waiter as he turned tail and left without acknowledgement.  I tasted the fish, it was fine, much more like mahi mahi than anything else we could think of (everyone at the table tasted it and agreed it was not flounder).  Our friend jokingly named it Maui Maui Flounder.My husband called the manager over and said that \\"my wife did not get her flounder.\\"  The manager responded, \\"that is the flounder.\\"   A couple of moments later a kitchen helper appeared with a plate of raw fish which the manager announced was \\"flounder.\\"  It was about an inch thick and pinkish red and looked more like grouper than flounder.  I insisted that my fish was not flounder, that I had cleaned and cooked myself over 100 in my long life and I knew what I was talking about.  The manager said \\"I grew up in Baltimore, I know what flounder is,\\" turned around and very rudely huffed off.  No apologies, no nothing.  Not one, may we bring you something else?So we paid our combined $265 bill for four people and left.  Why cannot good restaurants just tell you, \\"we are out of flounder tonight, is there something else you would like\\" and be HONEST.  Why all of the LYING ABOUT SEAFOOD.  It has reached epidemic proportions!  What I had was good and perfectly eatable, it was just not flounder.Do not, do not order the flounder at C&S Seafood.

But the Lineage folks are so open to spending time talking about their coffees that you'll feel like a third wave expert by the time you leave. (Fact- I walked away with a black coffee and a smug look on my face- did everyone know how coffee-literate I now was?) Their coffees are the first I've ever happily taken with no sugar and no cream. The old adage stands true: Once you've gone black, you can never go back. The service is the real highlight for me though as I'm not really getting the subtleties that regular coffee-drinkers probably taste. As other yelpers have noted, a high level of service and a rather small counter comes a bit of a wait. But good things take time and your payoff comes when it's your turn and they start working to find the right coffee for you. TIP: If you get a chance to go to one of their public 'cuppings' (kind of like a wine tasting), jump on it! It'll give you an even better appreciation for the passion that these folks have for the beans that they choose to roast and brew!"},{"name":"Pok Pok","address":"3226 SE Division St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"I came when it was slow, so there was no line.

In the past when I've made decisions on the fly using what I'll call my \\"Man-Map\\" (using my brain or a hunch instead of researching online) and would usually get 50/50 results.  In the past few years when I've utilized Yelp to check out the reviews beforehand, it helps make things more transparent and predictable and relatively accurate.  Should, coulda, woulda. One late weekend night I finished some errands and was in the area of S. Congress and Hwy 71.  I haven't had Chinese food in a while but suddenly got a craving for fried rice or quality Chinese food.  T&S Seafood had been my reliable go-to option in the past but it's too far up north, so instead of logging onto my obsolete and slow smart phone I decided to revert back to my Man-Map.  Where should I go?  For some reason the Man Map directs me to continue on S. Congress - - more Chinese options there.  Okie Dokie! I finally run into the intersection of Will-Cannon and S. Congress, been here before, and there I see it - - China Emperor tucked away in the corner of the strip mall.  The \\"open\\" sign is still on, I go in to do the gemba and I'm greeted by a very nice lady.  The restaurant is empty, I see a buffet (ugh) so I ask if they're still open (yes), can I order something from the menu (yes), can I also do a gemba of your buffet (yes).  She's really nice, attentive, and eager to please.  Well the buffet was not looking that great - then again it is closing time, but the lady says they will make whatever I'd like should I go that route.  Thank you but I think I'll get the Combination Fried Rice instead - to-go.  The price:  $9.30 - - a bit higher than my expectations as it's close to what I've paid for at T&S (which is really good), so I'm hoping this will be just as good.......Food is out in about 15 min, a respectable portion size (large styrofoam to-go container filled) but when I got home and tried it I was definitely disappointed in the quality and taste - - it didn't come close to what I expected.   Somewhat bland, seasonings were off, I got some egg chunks, about 3-4 pieces of shrimp, pork, and beef, a couple of pieces of chicken.  For 9 bucks I was expecting more generous meat portions with better taste and quality.  I picked out the eggs, had a couple more bites, that was all I could handle, couldn't finish the rest. I'd say 2 stars is an accurate and fair account since the customer service she provided was very friendly and prompt, unfortunately she's not involved with cooking the cuisine.

I waver back and forth as to which one I like better. The Chipotle Pastrami is panini pressed so you get a nice crunch from the bread, a kick from the chipotle mayo and the good old pastrami in the center.The corned beef/pastrami sandwich duo is the best tag team around since beavis and butthead. This thing is so flavorful on a soft bread that just soaks up the russian dressing. It is a classic sandwich done perfectly. Unlike the chipotle pastrami sandwich, there is no panini press here so it's just a good ol' piece of rye.Both sandwiches are some of the best things I've ever had and would go back here again and again if I lived in Boston. Plus the prices for Pastrami are relatively cheap (around $10), which is a bargain for good pastrami like they have here. The closest thing I could compare it to is Langer's Deli in Los Angeles.Also, if you are lucky like me and my friend, the people who were sitting in the seats you are sitting in may have left a few french fries on their plate...it makes for a nice snack.

Everything else is not important for me. However, there is a lot of \\"everything else\\" at this place, like the singer who goes around tables singing Italian songs of the sixties (dimmi quando quando quando...); like the ongoing non stop display of soccer games on the two TVs (however last night there was no display of Cassano's genius against Estonia the previous day, it was just a local channel with plenty of MSL); like the waiters repeating loud Italian words (mamma mia, etc).... Some patrons have a ball for this \\"atmosphere\\".Back to food. I had (why not, it was the first item on the pasta list), good old bucatini all'amatriciana. I was really looking for some authenticity from this place who is ran by real Italians (people born in Italy), and has the reputation of a top Italian place in Portland. Well, I was disappointed. The bucatini were not cooked to perfection. I am not a fanatic for \\"al dente\\", but my bucatini have been in the boiling water for at least one minute too long... But even more important, the sauce was too overwhelming, there was too much sauce in the dish (as compared to the pasta), and this is not according to the spirit of real bucatini. The sauce per se was not bad; the tomato (too much) was quite good, and the pancetta was real pancetta, and the overall flavor was good. But I like to eat Bucatini (first) all'Amatriciana (second), not amatriciana sauce with bucatini! Too bad, and this is the reason for my rating.Everything else was insignificant, my son had rigatoni with bolognese sauce, but his comment to me was that the ragu' we eat at home (prepared usually by myself) is ten times better... and the final tiramisu was quite heavy...Oh well, I plan to go back again and specifically ask for pasta \\"al dente\\", and will see what happen...

Saw they had nice veggie options so chose to do brunch here with some friends.  It was actually packed when we arrived and the only seats available were outside.  Normally that would not be an issue but Austin was going through a crazy cold spell that came from Chicago so it was a bit challenging but we sucked it up and the beer helped warm me up thank God:)I was a bit disappointed because I was on a mission to have their Ruben Sammy because a few friends recommended it but they have this policy that on weekends that they only serve this limited menu on weekends only.  So I had to pick more brunch type items that still looked decent.  They did have some interesting specials like a buffalo cauliflower pizza w/ vegan tofu blue cheese, a farmers market plate with collards butternut squash and maple vegan sausage with baked beans.  We decided to split some items instead. One of them was the country biscuit bowl and the other their smothered potatos dish.  I also got a side salad just because I had a feeling these dishes were going to be on the starchy side.The food came pretty quickly considering it was packed.   First thought when it came was how large the portions were.  We are talking the dishes were only $8.50 per which seemed very reasonable. The potatoes were as a smothered array of black beans jallepenos a smoked cashew cheese and topped with sour cream (vegan) and broccoli salsa.   It was delicious but my only complaint was I think it would have been even better with a few corn tortillas to make a wrap.  The other dish was something I've never had before.  I've never seen biscuits and gravy vegan style before.  Well let me tell you the gravy they made was very savory and rich with the biscuits.  It 's not something I would get myself as I'm not normally eating this but it was fun to try.  Definitely comfort food for sure. Salad was basic but fresh and so reasonable at $3.50 and definitely complemented the other dishes.   By the way there are no salad options also on brunch menu except for this side salad.   Definitely recommend the double IPA from Haze County a local beer I never tried before.  Hit the spot.  Finally who can resist a little dessert expecially since they all looked interesting. I was going to get the soursop blueberry cheesecake but it seemed like it would put me over the top so I settled on a strawberry pistachio zucchini cupcake for $4.   Pretty darn tasty and a good end to my meal.  Service here is fantastic and I loved the casual atmosphere here.  They have a diner style bar that you can sit at so it's has a very cool vibe here.  So if I get back to Austin and revist I'm coming for the Ruben and maybe I'll hand out that last 5th star.

And the reviews speak for themselves to some degree, if you view the Yelp page from the computer and not from the mobile app, you can sort reviews by Japanese as well as English. Many of the Japanese reviews are for Yelpers that live in Japan, flew out here for other reasons (business/pleasure/whatever), and just happened to try this place. The 5-star ratings speak for themselves.And here's my take: This place's offerings are delicious. American-style offerings like the Karaage (fried chicken) and the Takoyaki Octopus Dumplings are just as great as their straight-from-Japan style tonkotsu broth ramen and shoyu ramen bowls.This place is so popular that even at 3 PM on a Saturday, there is a waitlist. Yes, even if there is no physical line present, all the tables are full because the waitlist reservations are real. So get in line!There is no Wi-Fi here, so start talking to your pals at the table. The interior is lit warmly, so expect to feel cozy and insulated from the often-times cold and grey Oregon weather outside.And for the non-meat eaters, yes, this place has both vegan and vegetarian options. You are included here!So come by! I love this place.

Most hospital cafeterias serve a captive audience, but the OSU Medical Center has quite a few choices including BistrOH, Wendy's, Panera, and Au Bon Pain.BistroOH is the largest of these eateries at the medical center. It's extremely busy at lunch, but there is a TON of seating.  The d√©cor in the seating areas is quite nice with a simple, clean, modern, and actually kind of upscale feel.  I have never had trouble finding a seat.  It's easy to connect to the free WiFi as well.They have quite a few food choices including rotating hot entrees, salads, sandwiches, and pizza.  They also bring in Fusian now and then.  Of course there are desserts and numerous hot and cold beverage choices as well.  Calorie counts are posted by all the choices on the menu boards, and they have a few electronic kiosks for quick ordering. On my most recent visit the hot entr√©e station was serving sliced ham, seasoned roasted potatoes, and green beans.  All were surprisingly good for a hospital cafeteria.  The potatoes especially were flavorful and well-cooked.  The ham had a lightly sweet sauce/glaze which was also quite good.  The whole meal with a large soda was less than $7.The staff (especially those manning the numerous cash registers) are always very friendly.  All credit cards are accepted.Overall, this is definitely an above-average hospital cafeteria!

The Foie Gras was about $10 a piece and the Wagyu roll was ~$25. I'm not sure if I ordered the wrong things, but I really wasn't a fan of either pick. The Foie Gras was overwhelmingly plain and underwhelming. The wagyu roll came out way too spicy to eat, but the sushi chef was kind enough to make me another roll. Even so, the roll just lacked something. It wasn't sweet or salty. There was just something missing to it. I normally finish sushi at restaurants, but I just didn't have a really good experience, so I took home 3 pieces to get my friend's opinion.

The rich flavors developed from the broth coats the noodles and is just simply so comforting in Portland weather. I have actually tried the majority of their ramen broths and they are all great.

However, they are really letting things slip. First of all, the food is not exceptional, but passable. Secondly, there are always flies in the restaurant, which is a big turn off. Third, almost every time I have gone to this restaurant, including non-peak times, like around 4pm, almost all of the tables are dirty. They clear the plates, but do not wipe down the table with a wet cloth, and crumbs and such are always visible. I've let these things go. But, the last time I was there, I observed just how lackadaisical they've become. There was only one other table besides the one with myself and my six-year-old daughter. After taking our drink orders (we ordered water) the waitress did not come back to our table until she brought our food, and I had to remind her about the water. We were eating chips and salsa (which is a little hot for my daughter) with no water. But, no biggie, people forget these things sometimes. But in the meantime, as she's bringing the plates out for the other table, she realizes after she puts the plate down on the table that she's dripped sauce all the way from the kitchen to the table. There is literally a trail of droplets of sauce all the way from the kitchen, about twenty feet or so of distance. She notices and says, \\"Oh, I spilled the sauce!\\" or something to that effect. It's sloppy, but a mistake that anyone could make. Again, no biggie. But! She did not clean it up. Ever. The whole time we were there. We were there for well over an hour as my daughter is a slow eater. Just a trail of red sauce on a white floor that remained there, totally visible while she was nowhere to be seen, probably sitting at the counter. She did half-heartedly clean it up in the kitchen portion of the trail, probably because someone told her to do it, but she only swept it with a broom, which just smeared the red sauce on the floor. Do they not own a mop? Or are they short on water or something? Tables not wiped down, floor not mopped. It really grossed me out. I said something to her when she came out later and started to slip walking on the sauce herself. I said, in Spanish, \\"That needs to be cleaned up!\\" She mumbled something in reply, but didn't clean it up. I almost went for a mop to do it myself. But this is not a good sign for how they are running the restaurant and the standards they have. I will think twice before going there again. I've never written a review before, but I was disturbed enough about this that I felt I had to. I hope they address the problem and raise the standards a bit.

Pho Basil delivered.I was ecstatic to see that Pho Basil was opening in the old Tom Yum Cafe space, but once I saw their very large menu, I was a little worried that they were trying to many different things too fast. After all, aside from the extensive Vietnamese offerings, they also have Thai, Chinese and Japanese menu items.I went on their opening night and on the following day as well. First take-out, then eat-in. I decided to use the one yardstick by which to measure a Vietnamese restaurant: the Pho.It was good. Better than good, in fact. The beef broth was more flavorful than usual, the noodles were ample and cooked just right and the beef, basil and sprouts were all delicious and fresh as well. I got a lime wedge, but no chili pepper. But take note: these guys put fresh bottles of Sriracha and Hoisin sauce on each table. None of this community stuff.For take-out, I actually had to pour some of the broth out. there was too much, but all of the other ingredients were just as fresh and presentable as the eat-in version.I also tried the shrimp fried rice. Yes, a generic dish that anyone can do, but also shows how they do the basics. I have to give it a 7/10. I like to know that the rice is fried, not just tossed in soy sauce. The sriracha beef was also very good.I also had the crispy spring roll appetizer, which appeared to be the generic supermarket ones, and they came out of the kitchen a little too fast. The chopsticks are the cheap, round wooden kind, whereas I prefer the generic plastic ones. Maybe they'll upgrade for eat-in. I'd also like to point out that if you're going through the trouble of pouring someone a glass of ice water, it might be a little classier if you'd provide a glass, and ice, with your sodas. That being said, the service was great on both nights. The staff are very attentive and responsive and know their business. The take-out was not problem-free, but was very satisfactory, even on their opening night, and compared to the surrounding restaurants, these guys can easily give anyone a run for their money.I'll easily become a regular customer.

Maizal, you can have all my stars! Maizal is a family-run business that takes pride in quality and authentic Mexican cuisine. Their menu consists of about 7 tacos, a few burritos, bowls, quesadillas and dessert. They don't have a lot of options, but I think that's great because instead they focus their time and energy on their core products and excel in creating them. I'm really into food bowls lately, so when I saw they had bowl options, I jumped on it. I decided on the pescado rice bowl (deep fried fish batter w/ rice, beans, poco de gallo and corn tortillas on the side). Their fish batter is made with chicharon, which adds the extra crispiness. I'm a huge fan. I also got one of their churros to go. It was the perfect sweet snack. House-made and warm, mmm I'm having dreams about it. Next time I'll have to try their churro ice cream (Vanilla ice cream w/ churro bits). Seems like the perfect pair. Maizal easily makes it into my top 3 favourite Mexican spots in the city.

As we looked up from getting our purses to get out of the car we saw them, chocolate pancakes with whip cream n peppermint chips sprinkled ever so gently across the top.  We looked at each other and knew they would be ours. We now had a clear objective. Our waitress was very cheery an took very good care of us. We ordered 1 plate of scrambled egg whites with wheat toast and one order of ham n eggs and hash browns WITH the chocolate pancakes. When they came to the table I was lucky to get a picture before my friend dug her fork and knife into the chocolate pancakes. It was at that moment I realized there may be very little chance that I would even get a chance to taste them if I didn't dig in right along with her. I held off convincing myself that she could go down in flames all by herself until I saw her finally slow down o the pancakes.  I finished with what I wanted of my breakfast and could hold out no longer I was drawn to them.  What a wonderful flavor of chocolate and peppermint with white chocolate morsels and a dab of whip cream on top oh and the drizzle of chocolate syrup. There was nothing left we had cleaned the plate. Next we're trying the eggnog pancakes. We so enjoyed our breakfast great company, good service and the food was good.

Though it's a little bit of a trek from Northeastern / Back Bay area, it's definitely worth it.You make reservations via email, which I strongly recommend, since it gets very crowded. You can also get there right when it opens, though we did that (since our reservation was right when it opened) and there were already people in line.The atmosphere is wonderful: warm and welcoming. We were seated immediately, and the first thing I noticed was that the tables were covered with blank white paper and there were crayons on the table. That was life-changing, I kid you not. I don't know why more brunch places (or places in general) don't do that. It's a great way to pass time while waiting for your food, and you get to release some inner creativity.The service is also fantastic. We had a hard time deciding what to get since everything on the menu looked fantastic. My friend got the lobster eggs benedict, my other friend got one of the french toasts, and I got a vegetable hash. I asked for no cheese on mine, and the waiter was nice enough to sub avocado for free (!!!). I also got a cappuccino and my friend got a New Orleans style iced coffee, which she didn't like but I loved.Everyone enjoyed their food, and I enjoyed mine immensely.

You can tell by the taste and the texture. That is an offense to meatball lovers and #meatballculture. As any lover of good Italian food should know, everything needs to be fresh, fresh, fresh. Respect the meatballs and the meatballs will respect you. I had heard about The Meatball Stoppe for a while now but only just recently paid them a visit. Their location is kind of weird. It's in a plaza off of Lake Underhill and the shop doesn't face the road. Also, the parking lot is a bit difficult to get into. But none of that matters because it's all worth it once you step inside. The Meatball Stoppe is a family owned business with a cozy atmosphere. The owners and employees are happy to chat with you about the restaurant, Italian lifestyle, or anything in general. The Meatball Stoppe offers a variety of ways you can have your meatballs served. There's the \\"smashed\\" meatball, which is kind of like their version of a meatball sub. You can get a bucket of meatballs, which is something I totally wouldn't mind doing one night. The standard order is the \\"meatballs on top\\", which gets you three meatballs on top polenta, salad, or penne pasta. I recommend the pasta because you get a little side salad with your meal anyway. Since this was my first time there, I went with the \\"Meatball Trio\\" option which basically just lets you choose three different types of meatballs for your meal. And, yes, they have a fair number of different types of meatballs. I had \\"Nonna's Traditional Italian\\", \\"Sausage, Peppers, and Onions\\", and a \\"Spicy Pork\\". For my sauce, I chose the basic roasted tomato sauce because any Italian place worth its weight should have great marinara sauce. Everything is fresh and made in house, from the meatballs, to the sauces, to the focaccia, and you can definitely taste the difference. The three meatballs were pretty big and filled me up nicely, the penne pasta and salad were delicious sides, and the focaccia was blissful when dipped in sauce. I had my order to-go, and they were pretty quick with it considering there were also a good chunk of people there eating in. Also, for those interested in eating in, they do have happy hour specials! Go get your drink on and wash down those meatballs!According to the menu, they also have specialty dishes liked baked ziti and several types of eggplant and lasagna dishes. Of course you can add meatballs to any of those. I can't wait for my next trip here. If you're a fan of meatballs, you should definitely consider eating here. If you're not a fan of meatballs, what are you even doing with your life? (Don't worry, vegetarians, they have vegetarian meatballs, so I wasn't throwing shade at you)."},{"name":"Pok Pok","address":"3226 SE Division St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"When my husband and I were planning a trip to the Northwest  we just had to try out some of the places from Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives. Pok Pok (saying that makes me LOL since pok pok in Filipino means hoe ) wasn't just recommended by DDD, but also from a lot of our friends. This Thai restaurant is COMPLETELY different from any Thai restaurants I know. Don't be expecting Pad Thai, Pad See Ew or Pineapple fried rice in their menu just FYI. Location & Parking: 3/5\\nSince the Pok Pok is located in the downtown area, parking can be a little hard to find. We had to park in one of the residential streets and walk down to the restaurant... in the rain Atmosphere & Ambience: 3/5\\nWith how busy and small it is, they had to make do with whatever room they had.

The brunch experience I would rate a 3.5/5 experience, and the dinner I would rate a 4/5 experience.The atmosphere is wonderful - staff is very kind (on both occasions I was amazed by how attentive and friendly they were), noise level is not bothersome, and the walls are furnished with interesting art! For brunch I shared a lamb belly with poached eggs  dish and the Croque Madame.  The lamb belly was mixed with potatoes and served with two poached eggs.  The poached eggs did not have much flavor, so I was a bit disappointed.  There also were only a few pieces of lamb, though the few pieces were tender and delicious.  The Croque Madame was nice, though not anything too special.  The ham stuck out too a bit too strongly for my liking.  Overall experience was nice though! For Dine Out Boston I tried the Arugula and Endive Salad, the Bavette Steak, and the Hazelnut Mousse.  The salad was perfect - light but tasty. I'm not even a huge fan of arugula, but I liked the salad.  The Bavette steak was also good, though it tasted as if the only seasoning they used was salt.  They really love to load on the salt here, as my friend commented about the Hake dish.  I do like saltier dishes though so this was fine for me. Now onto the highlight of the meal - dessert! I was blown away by the hazelnut mousse.  Having tried 3 desserts from three Dine Out Boston menus this past week, this was by far the best!  The hazelnut mousse was light but delicious (not overtly sweet), sitting atop some hazelnut crunch type of base (which added the necessary sweetness to the entire bite).  Occasional hazelnuts and two pieces of dark chocolate adorned the top of the mousse, and each bite made my tastebuds want to weep with joy. While I do not think this restaurant is perfect, a 3/5 also feels like not giving it the credit it is due. Thus I have settled upon a 4/5 rating.

The weather was wet and rainy, but this place is 6-10 minutes driving from where i live. I called the place at 10 pm to ask about my delivery and the guy told me that he should be there in 5 minutes. I finally got my pizza at 10:11 pm. As I expected the pizza was barely warm, soggy crust, and the cheese was forming that hardened exterior when its been sitting for about 20 minutes in a car. I guess i cant blame the place for making the pizza in a timely manner, but delivery is the other half of the job. I ordered the Elvis Pesto Large size and wish i didnt. I also usually auto tip 20% too, but i dont think i will be using that feature ever again. Would i order from here? Probably not, as my first impression and $25 bucks and over an hour wait time to get lukewarm pizza is probably as bad of a first impression i can get from a place. If the pizza was hot i would probably be more forgiving and focus on the quality of what i am eating but two slices in and i need to use a microwave to enjoy a pizza? The netting under the pizza in the box is a nice touch as it does help keep a pizza well ventilated and prevent it from being soggy.

It was the worst burger we have ever had.  The fries container was only half full.  Our chicken wings came 10 minutes after the rest of the food had arrived.  Service was very unfriendly.

Service is fast, if brusque. Parking is plentiful in the lot, and it's a great spot for groups. Puzzling that they don't do lunch specials but perhaps that's a sign that they get enough business at lunch as-is!  1) Fried Wontons - Unlike some places that fill them with cream cheese (shudder), these are filled with shrimp and minced pork, and are excellent one-bite appetizers.2) Chicken potstickers - Also excellent, crispy and heavier than the wontons.3) 2 Choice BBQ - Roast Duck and Chinese BBQ Pork - This is the restaurant's specialty, and it shows.  The duck is properly done, with a nice soy/five spice flavor, and the BBQ cha siu is sweet and tangy as it should be.  Extra kudos for serving it on a bed of white rice, some places skimp there.I need to add a couple of notes here.a) Chinese BBQ pork is fatty.  Like, pork belly fatty.  Complaining that it's greasy is a tad churlish.  When it comes chopped up and in fried rice it's been cooked more, that's why you'll find it firmer or 'less fatty' in there.b) Duck is fatty and bony.  That's the way duck is - there's no meat except on the breast and leg, and the grease comes from the layer of fat they carry to keep warm as they're waterfowl.c) Roast duck does not have the crispy, shiny skin you see on the 'hanging' ducks in the window.  Those are Peking (okay, Beijing) duck that come in the Beijing duck platter, which you have to order whole.What can I say, it's a delicacy that's tough to prepare, which is why you won't find it on the menu at Panda Express.4) Seafood Fried Rice - This is a standout, as it's a properly done fried rice - bits of charred fried egg, some veggies, good texture - and it's studded with crabmeat, scallops, and even bits of squid!  5) Singapore Fried Rice Noodles - I got this stir fried with BBQ pork, shrimp, eggs, shredded carrots and onions.  It's spicier, with a nice kick to it and a yellow look probably from turmeric.  Highly recommended, though I found this dish a little *too* greasy.\\nIn sum: Very good Chinese place, you need to check it out!Pro Tip: On the weekends, show up before 11:45 if you're not fond of crowds.  This place can fill up relatively quickly!"},{"name":"De Dutch","address":"657 W 3rd Street","city":"N Vancouver","stars":"3.5","text":"I seriously need a quick, reliable, convenient place to get some breakfast in the morning and while I thought this place was an option, it is not.

This way you're eating those delicious little morsels so much sooner!!!This trip I got a couple of Ranch Hands with Diablo sauce on the side.  The tacos were great and really hit the spot.  The meat was tender & seasoned very well, the eggs were still fluffy & light, and the tortilla was perfect.  I got some Diablo sauce on the side for these little beauties.  Now as a native Texan I love spicy food as much as the next, but being that I've never tried the diablo sauce because I just eat the taco plain, it was a great awakening for my spicy taste buds.

Love. Love. Now that I got that out of my system, was thrilled I finally got to check out Hey Love. A good friend was in town from CA and although he wanted to go to First Thursday, I vetoed the suggestion opting for the east side where the energy is better and you don't have to fight First Thursday crowds to beg for a beverage! He insisted on taking me out for a birthday celebration even though my birthday was exactly one month prior, but, Hey, Love, I'll never turn down a reason to celebrate me! My birthday, my choice, so we started the night at Altabira for some rooftop sunshine and dinner, then ended the evening at Hey Love. The bartender, Carla, was outstanding, letting us sample the smoothies and bringing me a sample of a frozen dessert covered in unicorn colored star sprinkles! She was attentive, informative, and added to the great experience. Since it was the pic of some tropical drink in a cactus shaped glass that drew me in, I ordered the Oaxacan Sunrise and it did not disappoint! Made with mezcal, passion fruit, lime and the strawberry slushee dusted with Hybiscus salt, and served in a glass cactus mug, it was outstanding! Did you catch the dusted in Hybiscus salt! So Portland! The drink was so good, I had two! On a hot summer night, this drink was perfection. My friend ordered the Utah Gimmie Two - a combo of Dole Whip and Strawberry slushees with alcohol. He loved it but switched to a dry martini for his second. A little too much sugar for him! We stayed about 90 minutes and if he didn't have to get up super early for a meeting, I would have stayed longer. The place was hopping with energy and I just love the whole 70s decor. There is no doubt that I will be back, often. Can't wait to check out their brunch, next on my list. And their HH where the slushees are just $6.

First of all - most of their pasta is not fresh pasta, only the black pasta is homemade. There are no reservations - you stand in a line outside waiting to get in, we waited about an hour and a half - needless to say my party was HANGRY by the time we sat down. Apparently you are not supposed to ask questions (such as \\"what is the wait time?) while waiting in line because \\"they get angry.\\" Once you get into the minute restaurant (which has family style sitting in a big table mostly - one of four tables) you are seated and presented with a menu as the single waitress struggles to get everyone water. Of course at this point every single patron is ready to order - a request to which the sweaty and overworked single waitress actually replied \\"I know.\\" Then the calamari came out and I actually snorted because it was so mediocre. After that wait you could've at least squirted the lemon on top. It was a bit too oily for my taste - then I saw the (again, single) chef grab a huge bottle of oil/butter and squirt about half of it in a pan to make our pastas. The squid pasta was outstanding, and the scallops were fresh and on point. But one of the pastas was utterly unremarkable and I can think of a dozen restaurants in Boston were you can get pretty amazing food and not be abused. The ego of some restaurants is getting old - you are not Le Bernandin dude - take reservations, and, FOR THE LOVE OF GOD, hire another waitress or your current one's gonna end up in the hospital from heat exhaustion.

While my experiences have run into some bumps in the past, those bumps have been rectified and I've been able to have a great time.This review will focus on my most recent trip to Exile. I showed up around noon last Saturday for another poker tournament. The restaurant is located in a plaza a couple blocks from the Florida Mall. When you walk up, you see a couple tables outside where people can smoke. While not ideal, I guess it is good to have a nice little area for people to smoke while visiting a bar.When you go inside Exile, you go into a place that really is a restaurant and lounge. The walls are covered with wood paneling that I think is a little out-of-style, but not to the point of taking away from the experience. They have a decently-sized bar and lots of tables in the front area, as well as a small and dark little club area in the back that you pass by to use the restrooms.While the venue isn't that pretty imo, the food is what makes this a relatively good spot. They offer a tapas-style menu with lots of fun and tasty options. Their calamari is some of the best calamari in the city, and I've seen other people actually get pretty excited about their salad and carnitas options. As long as you can order from their main menu (a side issue for poker events that has since been addressed), then you will get some good food.In terms of service, they usually only have 1 or 2 bartenders and 1 cook during the Saturday lunchtime events. While the bartenders are fairly nice and good about refilling your drinks, the food does take a little while to come out. Not the worst problem to have during a multi-hour event, but they might want to consider bringing in a second cook when you have 30+ people added to the normal lunch crowd.Overall, Exile is an interesting little restaurant/lounge that might feel more like you should come later in the evening for the lounge part, but actually is a place where you can get some really good food for pretty good prices. If you are down near the Florida Mall, stopping by Exile for some tapas would be worth your time."},{"name":"The Nook On Piedmont Park","address":"1144 Piedmont Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3.5","text":"The Nook is located right by Piedmont Park and is a very chill place to come hang out and grab a bite while passing through.

That being said, that may be the reason for their good reviews.Looking at the reviews, menu, and pictures, I really expected to enjoy The Nook a lot. But honestly, I was pretty disappointed. Their menu items are so unique and sound delicious. I ordered totchos because that's what they are known for and was very unimpressed. I've had better tator tots for sure. The tots were too crunchy for my liking and toppings were minimal. I felt like I was just eating a plate of bland, overcooked tator tots. I would've enjoyed more toppings for sure. For my entree, I ordered the Southern Comfort Stuffed burger. Once again, sounds like it has the potential to be amazing, and for $15, you'd think it would be. But I was very unimpressed. It had too much sauce on it that it overwhelmed the flavor of the rest of the ingredients, and there was no juiciness to the patty whatsoever. My friend ordered the Peanut Butter & Bacon dog though which he enjoyed. That being said, I'll still say that The Nook is worth checking out for the uniqueness of their menu. You won't find these things elsewhere. I still enjoyed my meal- it just didn't live up to expectations. I don't think their food tasted anything special nor was it worth the price. But it wasn't bad.

Please note that if you are looking for a cheap Vietnamese restaurant than you came to the wrong place, but I honestly didn't think their prices were too bad when you think about the experience and quality of the food. I ordered the beef stew and my friend ordered the rice dish with lamb. Both dishes were delicious. My beef pieces were so tender that they would melt in my mouth. My friend said she enjoyed her dish as well - I didn't taste her dish to give any quality review on it. Therefore, I will not comment on it any further. However, we did shared a generous sized banana crepe dessert together and it was OMG yummy in my tummy. When it comes to pricing, I don't think people who complain about the prices understand that Dunwoody is an expensive area, thus, you will not find Buford Hwy prices or quality here. The beef stew was a generous portion that came with a French bread ($14) and my friend's dish was around $14-$15. Her dish was large enough to count as dinner size. The restaurant had ample seating space with plenty of tables inside, but they also offer outside seating on nice days. I noticed that a few customers that came in that day must have been returning customers because they knew the servers by name and vice versa.

The kids' menu isn't the most amazing deal - the pizza is basically the same price as a small pizza, but it does come with ice cream and a drink. Again - I wish ALL kid menus would give a veggie with every dish, but that's for every restaurant.I really appreciate the menu variety. From make-your-own salads, to a huge selection of pizzas, subs, calzones, pastas, etc. - you can really find something for everyone. In fact, we've never even tried anything other than the pizzas & wings, because we like them so much! But I've seen some of the other dishes and they do look yummy. The live music on Thursdays & Saturdays is nice, and we appreciate that they encourage kids to get involved.The only reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5 is because the salads are SO.SMALL. We often order a pizza and salad and the small salad is teeny. Even the large salad is pretty small.

I opted for a salad with lentils, hummus, onion chips, pickled cabbage, lamb bacon, pepper sauce and hot sauce. Everything meshed so well together. I wished the hot sauce was hotter. The lamb bacon was ok, but it wasn't amazing and I think I'll try the brisket next time. At checkout, I was a little caught off guard by the $13.50 price tag. That was for just my salad. Nothing extra. No drinks. No fries. Just my lamb bacon salad.  Definitely a higher price point than I was expecting. I know the pita option was cheaper, but I didn't want all the carbs.  I mentioned this in my Short North Brassica review, but at checkout they ask for tips when swiping your card. They still do this and at a line-style restaurant (think Chipotle or Piada), I'm still not a fan. Yes, the staff was all helpful and polite but I don't like this practice.

What a terrific idea for someone like me who loves board games, but I'm quickly running out of space in my own home to put the countless (not as loved) games acquired. This is a fantastic way to hang out with friends and to TEST out games before purchasing for yourself. It's a reasonable price for $5 for weekdays and $10 for weekends and additional $2/person if you want to bring your own food and drinks. They also have a modest offering of their own snacks and non-alcoholic beverages. We tried the hot dog, which was nothing to write home about.I agree with the other visitors that their game selection is extensive but VERY UNORGANIZED. Is it so unreasonable to ask one of the staff members whether they had a LIST of the games they hand on hand? There is no rhyme or reason to how the games are organized. They're just stuffed back to wherever fits after the patrons are done using. -1 star for the chaotic mass of games to sort through. However, if you are unsure the staff members can help recommend games for your group to try. On the weekends such as when we arrived we actually needed to wait awhile before getting a free table for a group of 5-6. Part of the space was used as a makeshift educational/art workshop for kids in the back so some of the space was unavailable.Some of the games we played while there were Smarty Party/Pants (this is such a weird and dated trivia game), Dixit, Cards Against Humanity (ugh basic game that I don't want to play again) and a Map based location game that I forgot the name of.

As a college student with little extra income, I feel Powell's has a tendency to overprice their books. It is well known that internet sites sell books for fairly cheap prices. It is also known that selling your books to a store such as Powell's (or any used bookstore, to be fair) will net you very little money.

We were four for dinner last night and it was hard to decide what to try first - fish or fowl, scamper or hoof? All of the above? We tried the crispy pork belly, the chicken fried rabbit, the charred broccoli, the torched cheese, the brandade with salt cod, and the grilled octopus. As a bonus, within seconds of walking in I recognized one of the managers as a long lost friend from college. Hugs all around! The pave d'affinois (\\"mysterious french thing\\" my friend called it as we attempted to decipher the menu) was a melty cheese served with garlic, figs, and rosemary black pepper biscotti. I adore cheese, especially warm melty cheese, so this wasn't a hard sell. Didn't come with enough biscotti for the torched cheese though and this is one where I feel like you really want the biscotti or toast points or a tiny little pickle to set off those last bites. The charred broccoli was fantastic. I couldn't remember the menu description so after I tasted it I was convinced there was some sort of peanut paste but all I could see was the butternut squash puree. Thank you, Internet. It was 'smoked cashew crumbles.' The overall effect is broccoli with a delicate satay sauce. Trust me, it's delicious. I might actually at home try mixing butternut squash with my jar of Indonesian satay sauce to see if I can get a similar effect. The brandade (\\"other mysterious french thing!\\") was interesting. We all liked the chewy al dente pasta that came out shaped like large candy wrappers. We all liked the delicate salt cod filling. Nobody could decide if they liked them together. The grilled octopus was another winner. Way too tiny for a shared dish but flavorful and crunchy. As one friend put it, \\"this is the pork cracklings of octopus, in a good way!\\" I totally agree, they had this crisp pork rind texture that I haven't really experienced in grilled octopus. I like the traditional way but this was neat and different. Speaking of pork, the crispy pork belly was my second favorite dish of the night. You got one medium square of it, perfect crispiness on top, rich pork meat beneath, and paired with creamy grits and kumquats. I love pork belly but oh my, the kumquats. Were they candied or something? I don't know but I wanted more and they were perfect with the pork meat. Finally, the chicken fried rabbit was one of the juiciest morsels of meat I've ever had the pleasure of eating. I could have eaten this as my whole meal. None of the gaminess you think of with rabbit. Just tender tender juicy rabbit bites with the most perfect light touch with the breading. I can't imagine ever being able to make this myself. Which means I totally need to come back. But I don't think tapas would be enough because next time I'd be all like 'did you want a bite? well NO because this rabbit is mine!' Overall, portions were a little small for the cost and sometimes almost too small to share. This for me was the difference between 4 and 5 stars. Not all the flavor pairings worked but I LOVE experimental flavor pairings and I'd rather go somewhere where they're willing to take a risk so no drawbacks there. Nothing came out oily or cold or wilted. Servers were friendly and prompt. I say if you're thinking about it - Go!"},{"name":"Life Alive","address":"765 Mass Ave","city":"Cambridge","stars":"4.5","text":"Ok I had a lot of expectations for this place and was WILDLY DISAPPOINTED!!\\nAs a vegan, I love a good food spot with tons of options for me.

During restaurant week, diners are offered a three-course meal for a low price, in this case $38, which is wicked cheap in Boston.  There are two ways for a restaurant to approach this event.  One way is to look at the bottom line, and offer a menu that is inferior to the normal fare, but make some profit.  The other is to see it as a chance to offer excellently prepared food to people who may not have been to the establishment before, in the hope that they will come back for more.  Bistro du Midi chose the latter.  I have eaten there a number of times when it was not restaurant week, and know what the kitchen can do.Razor clams are not high end fare.  They are plentiful and cheap.  However they can be disguised to be a respectable part of a high end dinner.  This is what the chef did, turning the clams into a ceviche with a dressing of grapefruit, mint, and corn, and served in the elongated shell that gives the bivalve its name.  This was a brilliant, simple, yet sophisticated dish.  The appetizer I chose was listed on the menu as \\"Charcuterie selection,\\" so I was expecting sausages, and preserved meats of various kinds.  Was I surprised!  I was presented with a little rectangle of liver pat√©.  Not what I would describe as charcuterie selection.  This pat√© of what I think was duck liver, was possibly the best pat√© I have ever eaten.  It was not only delicious, but had an exquisitely silken texture that I had never experienced anywhere else.  We are off to a good start.The next courses for us were excellent hake with mushrooms, fava beans, tomatoes, and pistou, and a spectacular chicken breast with grilled and roasted eggplant, with a lemon verbena dressing.  I have had chicken at Bistro du Midi before, and I wish I knew how to duplicate it at home.  I suspect it requires two ovens, one moderate oven to cook the meat, and one hot one to crisp the skin.  However it's done, I'll be back for more.  Usually, when I go out, I want to have something I can't or won't make at home, and chicken isn't usually the star of the show in most cases, but it is here.For dessert, my companion chose a chocolate brownie, with milk chocolate cream, toasted marshmallows, and what the menu described as graham cracker rocks.  In other words, fancy s'mores.  The report was that it was delicious.  However, I rarely eat dessert, and asked before ordering if I could have a piece of cheese instead.  The chef's answer was \\"yes,\\" and I was given a choice if six, from which I chose a smoky bleu, which was so good I had the waiter write down what it was, so I could get some to eat at home.  This was one of the best experiences we have ever had in a restaurant.  The staff is cordial, friendly, and professional.  The d√©cor has changed over the years.  It used to be like having dinner at grandma's, with cozy sofas, floor lamps, and tablecloths.  The tablecloths are gone, but I like what they did with the room.  Some cozy sofas and floor lamps are still there, but much of the lighting comes from masses of LED candles, perched on the tables, window sills, and chandeliers.

I informed at least three of the staff members, yet when I passed by the next day and looked through the window, the books were still there. Could have been they replaced them with new books, but what they really should have done is threw them out of the eatery, scrubbed down the cleared area, and kept it that way. I have pseudo PTSD from this experience and cannot face eating here since then(2) on a similar theme, the employees do not seem well trained about food hygiene and cleanliness; many are sweaty and wipe their brow with the backside of their gloved hands; wipe on their clothes; without any clear glove changes. When handling so much salad type foodstuff, it's really essential to get this under control.(3) to go dishes: for some reason, whenever you order a platter to go, they back it in a tiny cardboard box that is by no means equivalent to what is received for dine in platters. They will insist that it is quantitatively identical but this is highly implausible, any I have seen many others frustrated by this issue.

Thai and Thai fusion restaurants are a dime a dozen in Seattle, and we have plenty to choose from. So to go down to Portland to eat at Pok Pok when there are so many other restaurants to try in this foodie city seems like such a waste of time and tummy space.To those of you want to wait forever (because they don't have enough staff to seat and serve you, but empty tables to spare) to enjoy average Thai fusion food cooked up by some white guy who had an epiphany on a trek through Asia, go for it."},{"name":"Moonshine Patio Bar & Grill","address":"303 Red River St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"We enjoyed lunch here our second day in Austin and it was an outstanding experience!This is upscale SoCo, with a rich menu of diverse options all tailored to perfection.  We began the meal with a special soup: gumbo with andouille sausage and rice, it was super spicy and flavorful without ever being greasy.  Next was the kale and artichoke dip with bacon jam and flat bread and it was indulgent in flavor; the bacon sweet and savory against the creamy goodness of the dip.  We loved it.  And for the entree, I had the blackened cat fish lathered with a bit of spicy chipotle and it was incredible.  Service was friendly, professional and attentive with only a small miss here and there.

How hard is it to get a Jameson and ginger ale right? One, maybe two shots of Jameson, over ice, and add ginger ale. I don't need candied ginger on a toothpick. I don't need a splash of citrus. I don't want anything, but....Jameson and ginger ale. It's that easy. Secondly, a friend ordered some strawberry concoction. When there is so much ice that you are fairly certain the liguid in a highball glass amounts to about a quarter cup...at 9 dollars, that's called a rip off. She didn't order a poorly made snowcone. She ordered a drink. Boo this place. BOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!(making thumbs down gesture)Go back to New York, and learn how to fix a drink.

If you're looking for authentic Thai food, I would say this place is as close as you can get. Not only did the tables look like the ones in Thailand, but the plates were the same too!! The food was pretty spot on to what I tasted in Thailand, which surprised me. I just say, the Khao Soi was so delicious that I wanted to order a whole bowl just for myself. This place is family style, so it is recommend to order as many dishes as there is people, however, I would recommend to order maybe 1-2 more dishes since they are pretty small.

My boyfriends salad was okay as well, he says how its described on the menu sounds better, presentation was nice though.I'm not sure how the paying process works in Austin but I know in some cities they don't allow split checks.

We sat outside on the heated patio which is definitely heated enough for the winter because we weren't cold. It makes for a great upscale lunch place if you're taking a client, etc., but isn't too expensive. There's a large range of choices on the menu and it's a great place if you're a vegetarian. We started with the edamame dumplings which are INSANE. Highly recommend. They were so flavorful and way more tasteful than I imagined they'd be. They also came out fairly quickly, even with the restaurant being packed.One of us had the quinoa burger which is highly recommended if you're looking for a more filling meal. I had the kale salad which was a bit more bland (felt like it was a bowl just of kale with a sprinkle of Parmesan cheese) however the dressing was citrusy and well-paired and the tofu was seared, crispy, and yummy.

He immediately greeted us & was ready to answer any questions we had.I knew right away that I wanted to try the lamb gyro. So before even looking at what else we may want to try I ordered one. After that we were trying to decide what else we should try, the owner then handed us each a falafel to sample. He then offered a bottle of water for my daughter because it was hot outside. I told him that we had water in the truck so she will be okay. He then told me that he wanted her to have it on the house! Right away I knew whatever else we ordered was going to be excellent!Their Gyro was one of the best ones I have had all summer! I've had Gyros in 3 other states so far. But this Gyro topped them all!

The rolls they put out with whatever tasty butter that was were sooo nice. Crisp on the outside, warm and chewy on the inside. MMM. Luckily they only brought out enough for each person, otherwise I would have ruined my dinner!For my cocktail, I got the special, which was the Passionate Kiss Martini (A romantic blend of champagne, strawberry puree, passion fruit syrup, white lillet and st. germain liqueur garnished with fresh strawberries). This was so tasty and rather strong!! Everyone else loved their drinks as well (one friend got the Blueberry Martini and raved about it).For my main course, I went with the Tuscan Brick Chicken (All-natural chicken breast seasoned and seared under brick, served over creamy risotto with baby carrots, snap peas and natural au jus). The chicken was definitely thicker than I expected, but it was juicy & delicious. And the risotto & veggies were PERFECT. I devoured the entire thing.3 people at the table got burgers and all 3 ended up sending them back due to under-cooking. My husband ordered his medium-well - when the waitress looked at it, she said \\"yeah, that's rare.\\" The birthday girl ordered hers medium and the waitress, after bringing it into the kitchen, told us the chef said \\"that's his version of medium.\\" They happily heated them all up though, and my husband - who had eaten a few bites - even got a completely new burger!! The 3rd person apparently got his back, with his bite taken out of it...1 complaint: They don't do anything for birthdays!! They did bring out a birthday cake - after I requested it - but didn't sing and charged us for the cake. :( However, the Gluten-Free cake they brought (with ice cream) was apparently divine.It wasn't too pricey, considering it was a large group and everyone got 1-2 drinks.I would definitely go back and am curious to try their brunch!"},{"name":"The Daily Catch","address":"323 Hanover St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"You know how in movies when someone finds a hungry orphan child and they give him something to eat and he's just gobbling it down all wide-eyed and crazy while guarding his plate with one arm and there's food all over his face?

Their boardgame assortment is pretty large but they don't appear to be in any particular order so just take your time and look for the game you want! The cashier will typically direct you to an appropriate table based on the size of your party. Staff has been pretty friendly in all the times I have visited -- sometimes there will be someone wandering around and checking in to see whether or not we need anything. I think if there was someone who would offer to help us find a game from time to time, that would improve everyone's experience drastically. I'm quite impressed with the restroom in the back of the room too. For a place this size to have only 1 restroom, it's well-kept.

This Indian restaurant is a great addition to the dining here in this city! If you're a fan of Indian... you'd really have to try it out for yourself - I am positive that you'll enjoy your experience at this location! I came on a Friday night and was expecting a wait, but luckily for us, the restaurant size allows for ample space and minimal waiting! My husband even commented on the nice romantic atmosphere which presents a \\"homey\\" feel for the location. A great aesthetic for date nights or just meals with your family/friends. As per usual, the meal starts off with the three chutneys and chips for the table. My favorite has always been the brown/sweeter chutney and the green minty one. This location did NOT disappoint! I found myself pouring the brown chutney all over the rest of my meal; it was delicious! Just the right amount of sweet. The green one was a tad spicier than I'm used to, but still very delicious. My husband and I ordered a plate of garlic naan for the table, butter chicken and lamb biryani to share with our friends. I was slightly turned off by the naan as it didn't have much of the garlic taste as I wanted. Some indian places truly add on the seasoning for peak flavor, but this wasn't my favorite. However, the main dishes allowed for all of the redemption because each bite was incredible. You can't go wrong with butter chicken, but I was very impressed with the biyrani. Tasted so fresh and the ingredients together added for a great balance of textures and spices. Overall, I've had better Indian food, but this place still blows my mind!

What they were really suggesting is that I get lost in a maze of books, first filled with amusement as small children ran past me in the rows and adults picked through hardcovers that were likely to sit on a shelf, unread, for years to come. At first, you'll be fascinated. Then, if you're like me, you'll become slowly irritated and grumpy, realizing that the signs only make sense if you stop to read them (which of course you don't want to do out of fear of looking like a tourist and *GASP* soliciting the unwanted but very needed help you seek). You will realize you are hungry, very hungry, and still lost between Astrology and Eastern Religions, now spinning in circles and looking for some guiding light to a larger section, perhaps a way out. You'll eventually give up hope, like I did, making a small nest in some corner out of ripped young adult novel pages and wait for a friend to find you. The noise of passing shoppers will be your entertainment as you pass the time. No one has found me, I'm in fact still in Powell's, in the rare books section, stealing wifi from the nice, though bland seeming restaurant across the street and writing this review.

This is especially true with dining \\"family style,\\" which you claim to be.

I loved Pok Pok in LA and I was devastated when it closed down so I was determined to come here in Portland. I was not disappointed. I had the spicy Ike's Vietnamese wings, boar collar meat, kha soi with chicken and the clay pot pork belly and prawns. They were all great. Wings - tangy and just as amazing as the dish in LA. Boar collar meat - my lord. My first time having boar and I'm in love. This dish has a little spice and lots of acid that takes away any gaminess of the meat. This was my absolute favorite dish to my surprise. Thinking of it is making my mouth water. Order some rice with this and eat it with the mustard greens it comes with. Kha soi - light but hearty. It was ok. The tender chicken makes the dish for me. Prawns and pork belly clay pot - oh my god. The prawn sauce that comes with this dish was so delicious I ate it with every other dish I had. I asked for 5 extra cups. The sauce really made the dish for me. The dish itself was ok but the sauce made it a stand out. I would definitely order this dish again for the combination of the sauce and dish together. Overall service was great and the food was amazing. My only problem with this place is that it's ridiculously expensive for portion size and what it is. Think ~$17 for all of these dishes. Overpriced for this kind of food.

The weather was glorious and of course, the seating spilled outside the restaurant.  Trusting Yelp after reading many reviews and after drooling at the posted pictures, I decided this is where our group should satisfy our taste buds.  We walk up to the location and notice plenty of people sitting on the concrete benches waiting for what seemed like a 20 person seater restaurant.  There is, what seems to be, a host standing just outside the door by a utensil cart.  He seemed a bit idle in the midst of the chaos inside.  I ask him how long the wait will be and he responds uncertain that it is an hour.  Ok, we leave, dawdle around Mass Ave., and I return as the boys are getting the last minutes of the Spain vs Italy game.  This time, there seemed to be no wait and more of a calm.The 'host' couldn't tell me how long we would have to wait and kept insisting that I wait for the manager to tell me the estimated wait time.  Time passes by...and by...and by...the 'host' tells me that the manager is almost coming out and that it is busy...\\nSo I wait...I catch a glimpse of the manager near the door, chatting for another 5 minutes with customers...I think to myself, once he's done, he'll pop out and tell me quick, then get back to his duties.  Nope...he finishes his convo and turns away into the restaurant abyss.So, I wait,...another couple waits with me.  I give them my account of the waiting game I've played and the woman goes in requesting that we be spoken to.  Another minute or two, the manager comes out with a 'Oh, what can I do?'...I tell him that I've been waiting for 15 minutes...he says something to the extent to imply that I lied...I leave...and am dragged back in 15 minutes...The boys really want to grab brunch there, since the crowd seemed to say something about the quality.  My bf tries to grab us seats once again...And even him, more patient than I, was not even spoken to for another 5-10 minutes.  He noticed the manager not even acknowledging him or others waiting at the door..., the staff were not bustling about as the restaurant had been, rather just gabbing in a group while patrons waited for some help.I wanted to like you Cafe Luna.

Normally I am rarely a steak in a restaurant kind of guy, however on the occasions I have to visit Rathbun's, I go completely crazy for it!  I digress beyond the food, the service is always impeccable, with appropriate care given to a diner's schedule and wants as you peruse the menu.  The bartenders have an amazing capability to either find a drink you will enjoy on the cocktail menu, or if you are feeling brave, let them create you something in whatever family of cocktails you enjoy.  The wine list is absolutely impeccable and the sommelier is absolutely spot on with wine recommendations if you can not seem to make a decision or are feeling like trying something new.  Moving on, the ambiance of the restaurant is hipster-swanky formal, allowing for a nice dining experience without being snooty or presuming.  To complete the experience, they have an awesome patio with a one of a kind restaurant fire place on the belt line, accessible by bike, foot, auto, or any combination thereof.     During the winter months they will light a fire which burns warm and provides for a welcome evening of cocktails and even food or cigars if you so choose.  Now moving back to the food!  For an appetizer the bone marrow is hands down my go to, it is rich, creamy, and full of amazing flavor, and my personal favorite, its totally shareable.  If you are really hungry, go for the Full Monty Seafood tower, which while pricey, is absolutely an awesome find in the city of Atlanta.  They always have perfectly cooked entrees, sides and a myriad of specials and even wine pairings to go with the ever evolving menu at Rathbuns.  Lastly, I respect a chef who will not only open and maintain a quality restaurant, but to spend time there, interact with the patrons, and continue to try and build the reputation for better the service to its customers.  I have had many a steak in the city of Atlanta, I may dare say this is the best I have ever had, I enjoy Rathbun's immensely.  The one complaint that I have is that it gets a bit loud so its hard to have a conversation, the tables are close together allowing for ease dropping, and its a tad dark in the restaurant.  Sometimes it is hard to read the menu or see each others faces.  Only reasons for the four stars, and its an easy fix, but I truly have nothing but high praise for the food, service, drinks, and business that Rathbun's is and continues to try and be!"},{"name":"Chuy's","address":"8123 International Dr","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"Creamy Jalape√±o Sauce!!!

We called to see if we could make a reservation but it's a walk-in place.  We walked in and saw there were plenty of tables available and the bar had some seats available too.

Also with the salsa was that Creamy Jalape√±o sauce.  As you can imagine, we went straight to the salsa.  At first I thought the other sauce was a Ranch dressing but being curious I tried it and WOW!  It definitely has some ranch in it, some sour cream, and a nice kick with the jalape√±os.  Best of all, this sauce is free, and can be refilled as much as you want, same with the chips.  They also have a half page with their other homemade sauces that you can ask for free of charge.I was pairing this with my classic margarita - big and strong - when my Quesadilla Deluxe came out.  Cut in 4 pieces, filled with chicken, onions, peppers, and cheese.  Side of Guacamole, pico de gallo and sour cream.

It's just so good.  The pasta and sauces are homemade and you can taste the difference.  Don't be fooled by the area or the strip mall because inside is a little gem.  The restaurant is small so make a reservation if you want a guaranteed seat, especially on the weekend.  As for what to order, there's really nothing that's bad on the menu but it's not \\"light\\" food.  There's lots of sauce and lots of cheese so this definitely isn't the place to go if you are on a diet.

The food is tastier than I expected (it's actually REALLY good), and Life Alive has done an amazing job transforming a video rental shop (long live Hollywood Express!) into a lovely, sunny, cheerful place that seems to blast R&B all day long.   The only downside to this place is that things move at a snail's pace - I love that the cashiers are friendly and sweet, but when there's a line of 20 people that snakes all the way to the door, they just need to move a little bit faster (this is compounded by the fact that they also seem to be taking phone orders).  And everything comes out REALLY slowly, even things that shouldn't be slow - like tea. Or a smoothie. Even at 9AM on a Saturday morning when the shop was empty, I still waited almost 15 minutes for a smoothie.

Lucky's definitely has an edge on the caf√© and beer. Whoever thought of elevating the entire grocery experience was clever. Caf√©s in grocery stores are becoming ubiquitous, but the layout of Lucky's Market and attention to detail (board games and comfy sofas) caught me off guard. I definitely see how this place can become quickly popular. I cannot recall if this location served craft beer in their caf√© like in Hunter's Creek. Regardless, definitely shop here to see how it compares to other grocery stores! I may offend some other grocery companies, but it's a cross between Trader Joe's and the frugal-friendly version of Whole Food's store that have caf√©s. Lucky's biggest competition has to be Publix,  though, as Lucky's seems to be popping up near Publix stores all over Orlando. I leave out one star as the customer service is mediocre. This is my first visit at this new location, which recently had a grand opening. It's pretty crowded and the parking lot was relatively full. I felt like the store was disorganized, but that may really just be me feeling overwhelmed from the crowd and getting familiar with the aisles. Overall, I'd still say 4 stars for again, the business model and variety. I'd still return there for sure, but concluding whether Lucky's rules over other grocery stores is still too early. I cannot say I am automatically a Lucky's loyal customer. Plus, I'm the type of consumer that just needs my food no matter which store at times.

Wonderful waitstaff. Incredibly fast in the kitchen. That said, we and many others were waiting for more than 40 minutes early in the evening on a weekday, while many tables were completely empty, especially the larger ones: empty the entire time we were there. Even some 4-tops and 2-tops were empty. Not sure whether that was because of limited available staffing, but with no explanation it gives the impression that management is trying to make the place seem more desirable by making people wait in front in conspicuous lines. Granted, we could have left, but we were originally told the wait was only 20 minutes. So by the time we had invested 20 minutes, we didn't want to lose out by refusing another few minutes... which wound up being 20 more. I would only recommend bringing someone who is willing to tolerate that kind of seemingly pointless waiting, maybe by having a nice conversation.

The vegetable biryni was my least favorite out of the dished that we had on account that is seemed as more of an Americanized quick cook rice dish. The tandoori chicken was amazingly cooked to perfection and the only thing I have to say about this is that its the most expensive item on the menu, usually cheaper at other places, but well worth the price if you want to give your tastebuds a treat. The chicken saag wala was very delightful as well to my taste buds. The Chana Masala was very good oddly had a glaze instead of a tomato paste look to it.

I love the \\"cook it yourself\\" style places too, however, we were more in the mood for the regular kitchen service.  The place is very cozy but was completely empty except for us.  Honesty though, it allowed our waitress to be completely focused on us, so we ended up getting VIP-level treatment.  She was very sweet and helpful too.  She took the time to explain a lot of the items on the menu that we had never heard of.  First off, the dumplings were incredible.  Maybe some of the best dumplings I've ever had.  They weren't packed full of filling like most dumplings, but they were packed full of flavor, which in my opinion, is way more important.  They were also flatter and lighter than most dumplings I've had, which made them very easy to eat.  They were perfectly crispy on the outside, and came with this wonderful soy-based sauce that was perfection.  I ended up trying the Kimchi-Tzigae, which was this awesome Kimchi soup with tofu, pork, and vegetables served in a hot pot.  I loved it!  I didn't think I was such a fan of Kimchi until I tried this.  It added so much flavor.  Honestly, this soup was outstanding.  It has a hell of a kick though (even for someone who loves spicy stuff).  I loved the contrast in texture between the pork, the tofu, and the veggies.  I got something different with every bite and it felt like such a nice surprise when I did.  Only downside was that since it was served in the hot pot itself, it took a long time to cool down enough to eat it.  Every minute I spent staring at the soup waiting for it to drop below the temperature of the sun was complete agony because it smelled so good.  I also had the LA Galbi on the recommendation of our waitress.  Very tasty short ribs.  Marinated and seasoned well.  They were a bit hard to eat with chopsticks or even a fork though, mostly because they came with the bone still in.  We ended up just getting impatient and using our hands.  Still very tasty though.  I ended up trying some of the sweet and sour chicken that my girlfriend ordered, and it was pretty spectacular as well.  Reminded me of Panda Express to be honest, but the chicken was high quality.  The sides it came with were really unique.  I forget what most of them were, but I do remember the Kimchi, Garlic Bok Choy, pickled Daikon, and some seafood thing with imitation crab.  The flavors were all pretty different from one another.  Don't know how much a liked it all, but I definitely didn't hate it.  I appreciate any restaurant that lets their guests try so many different tastes.  Dessert was just regular ice cream... nothing special.  They do have mochi, but they were out of the flavors that we would have liked to try.  Still, you don't come to a Korean place for the desserts.  We came for the great Asian cuisine and we certainly got that.  I'm really happy we tried this place."},{"name":"Piazza Italia","address":"1129 NW Johnson St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Piazza Italia is easily my favorite Italian pick of all time in Portland.

It is on the pricier side, sure, but I think it is worth it. Out of the banchan, I enjoyed the kimchi, bean sprouts and potato salad. My favorite meat by far was the #1. I did not care for the #6 because the cut was a bit too thick for my taste. Although our table had two grills, we only used one for the 6 of us. I am not sure if that is normal practice.

I was here on business, so I ate alone @ the bar & once again....AMAZING! The oysters were so delicious, the clam chowder (I ordered a half cup) continues to be the best I've ever had and I ordered the scallop entree. I don't ever eat scallops in my land locked home town & these were equally delicious (very buttery). The only downside to my experience on this occasion was that the service was not as good as I've experienced in the past.

We had a fun time -- you can definitely tell that each element of the space has been thought out (loved the chairs!)She got the spinach salad and I got the squid, and we split an order of fried risotto balls. (She's vegetarian so we held off on massive protein this trip.) On my end, the squid had a great texture. The risotto balls were a generous portion, though not as creamy on the inside as I was hoping. Dessert is pretty good, though. You can basically choose to combine a scoop of ice cream ($5), a carb-y dessert ($3) and toppings ($2). I think the real value-added is the baked good, but the ice cream definitely makes it more delicious. We split two sundaes - the banana chocolate chip bread pudding topped with naughty girl scout ice cream (peanut butter-nutella ice cream, thin mints stirred in) and apple beignets topped with cinnamon honey ice cream. The ice creams were excellent, and the apple beignets - with apple pie filling - came in a pair (which was great for sharing). I am of the undercooked school of bread pudding and thought it was a bit too hard (as were the beignets - but only a little), but my friend liked it a lot.Service was great when we started dinner, but the second half of dinner could have been better. We had to wait a while for the dessert menu and check - wouldn't have been as noticeable were it not for the fact that the folks next to us started eating 20 minutes after us and left 20 minutes earlier.The weird thing (as I think has been indicated before) is the pricing. My guess is that it's there so that menu prices are similar across the board, but it just seems like there's a significant amount of variance. Like you can get a pretty generous portion of skillet mac'n'cheese...or a side of broccoli that's half that size for $9 (to each his own?) Same thing goes for the market...$6 head of cauliflower vs $5 homemade pasta (also, it would be really awesome to have the pricing clear on the homemade ice creams and jams). As such, the current Yelp rating is missing a dollar sign.

If you want a sandwich, and want to spend a little extra on lunch, then this is the perfect place.These sandwiches are huge.  To quote the late Mitch Hedberg, \\"It's like a cow with a cracker on either side\\".  I have no problem eating just half of one for lunch, and saving the rest for an after-dinner gorge.There's a new sandwich called the Pastrami Diablo, and it's one of the best sandwiches I've ever had:  \\"Rumanian pastrami with monterey jack cheese, thin sliced bermuda onion, apple wood smoked bacon, chipotle mayo, bbq sauce, and hot cherry peppers served on a french round roll.\\"There's so much happening between two pieces of bread.  It's savory with the pastrami and bacon, it's cheesy with the... cheese, and somehow, with the combination of everything else on it, it has a big hit of sweetness.They have all the usual suspects you'd find in a sandwich shop.  All sorts of cheeses, all sorts of bread... you'll find anything you're looking for here.For the area, it's a little expensive.  This is more of a once-in-a-while place.  Both because the sandwiches are gigantic, and because it's more expensive than other lunch places in the immediate area (a sandwich costs around $13-$14).

I usually make 2 meals out of it. Plus, depending on the day of the week, they have certain discount specials. With your entree you can pick between a soup or salad. I always get their salad because it's soooo delicious. It's a nice house salad with balsamic vinaigrette, beans, tomatoes, onions, and pasta. They'll ask you if you want Gorgonzola cheese with it, and I always say no because it's an additional charge and they put on way too much (at least they did the one time I got it). The bread is always fresh and the butter is phenomenal. We usually get extra pasta sauce as a dip for our bread.Their pasta sauce is just AMAZING.

There was a time when devouring Mexican food was considered an inexpensive dining experience, that's not really the case anymore especially if you're pounding those delicious alcoholic beverages while pigging out on the free chips. I don't think there's a culture or business model that pairs food and alcohol better than a authentic Tex-Mex restaurant, this restaurant chain seems to have what some would describe as a cult following when it comes to some of their signature drinks and dishes. The super thin warmed tortilla chips makes any of the amazing salsas' taste that much better, for a starter add some queso blanco and a cold Dos Equis and you may not need an entr√©e. I love a lots of things here but the fajitas are so good, I prefer the chicken and steak combination with all the sides rolled in a in-house made tortilla. I usually grab a seat at the bar where the service is usually instantaneous and the alcohol always seems to flow a tad free'er.The service was outstanding and the food was as consistent as you'd expect from a successful chain no matter what type of food is being served.

The sizzling rice soup was it's typical flaccid white chicken, snow peas, mushrooms, and sliced carrots in salty white broth with a side of crackly dehydrated rice self. I'm not sure what my compulsion is about always needing to order this dish from every chinese restaurant. So basically what I am saying is the sizzling rice soup is respectable. The Singapore noodles were the star of my meal. My belly really dug the stir fried dish that had curry powder, rice noodles, chicken, shrimp, and mixed veggies.

I really liked the black panther flavor with activated charcoal, but ended up going with the chocolate fudge and Cookie Monster flavors with marshmallows. Loved both flavors! And the Cookie Monster was great because it made my tongue blue lol.  the sweet stack donut was definitely worth the experience, but there was no way I could finish the whole thing, I think the marshmallows was overload for me.

I stay at the Wynn Vegas twice a month, usually 3-4 days per visit, and dine at the Red 8 there once per visit.The decor is consistent between both locations. Clean, spacious, ample dining tables given the size of the casino. Location is near the casino floor, so it's not a trek, which is uber important to me, and the distance to the nearest bathroom is all but 10-15 feet from the restaurant entrance.Here's the thing to know about Red 8 in general. There is a small selection of great dishes (I'd say 25%) in either location, that is authentic, and definitely worthy of regular visits. another 20% are good. The remaining 55% are \\"meh\\". The trick is to know which 25% are the good dishes. Unfortunately, they differ for each location. I dined at the Red 8 in Boston 4 times over three 3 days to sample as many dishes as I could.Here are the best, or most authentic dishes I recommend for Boston:\\n - cold roast chicken in soy sauce \\n - dim sum (hargow, chicken feet, siu mai, pork buns)\\n - Shanghainese soup dumplings\\n - baby bok choy in scallop sauce\\n - Ma Po tofu (though it was a tad bit on the Szechuan spice side)The above-average or \\"ok\\" dishes were:\\n - Hong Kong style crispy seafood noodles\\n - hot and sour soup\\n - dim sum egg custard tarts (dessert)SUCKfest or \\"meh\\" :\\n - Peking Duck was chewy, oily (more than usual for the dish), gross, and the pancakes were unusually thick. I ate 2 because I was hungry, but definitely did not order this again after the first day. Then again, I'm REALLY picky about my Peking duck after eating this around the world for the last 20 years. If you're not picky.... it may be considered \\"average\\". \\n - Malaysian chicken satay (peanut sauce completely different from the more authentic Malaysian sauce in Vegas). HATED this.The service is rather horrible. Don't get me wrong on the staff friendliness. They are SUPER friendly. The problem is the wait time between order and delivery, as well as the time between server visits throughout the meal. Occasionally, a couple of ordered items on two visits, never made it to the table, yet appeared on the bill. Considering the high price of the menu, I expect better..... MUCH better.

On the other hand, the service was lacking, the recliners didn't recline very far back and the food wasn't fantastic. We ordered an appetizer, popcorn, drinks and a couple entrees. All of the food came out and we still didnt have drinks. We had to go down and get drinks ourselves after asking about them several times. Other people ordered after us and got their drinks first.

I ended up maybe eating 1/3 of it and just decided I couldn't choke anymore dry, sticky pasta down my throat.  The service was just fine, however, I sometimes get it through their drive-thru and EVERY.SINGLE. TIME they forget my piada stick or parmesan dipping sauce that comes with them.  I have to remind the staff, they insist that they're in the bag, but the bag is only so big and the piada stick is long and kind of bulky, so I would know if it's in my bag or not. I kind of wish they'd stop arguing with me each time I remind them that they're not in the bag - not like I'm trying to screw them out of a $2.29 piada stick!!  Truly, the piada sticks, tomato soup and cannoli chips are the only things I can support as \\"good\\" from Piada.

For being in such a high volume location they executed the menu in a very timely as well as tasty fashion. Our party of six showed up on a busy Thursday evening just an 1 1/2 before the Red Sox vs. Twins game next door. We only had to wait about fifteen minutes before they were able to get us seated and underway. The service was speedy and we were able to make it to the game and our seats before the first pitch. When walking by other tables I noticed some pretty impressive appetizers they offer an enormous swinging pretzel and cheese as well as a creamy buffalo dip in a bread bowl. I ordered the buffalo dip in a bread bowl for the table and it was a hit. Nothing was left. For my main course I had the Chicken focaccia club. I also tried some of my friends BBQ sandwhich and another friends turkey burger. The focaccia club was so delicious and prepared perfectly. Everyone's french fries came out piping hot and with just the right amount of seasoning.  My friends bbq sandwich was pretty good for a high volume restaurant and the burger I tried was good as well. They gave us a really good experience with fresh hot food in a timely manner. The menu is really large as is the restaurant so that is a feat. I'd really like to be able to make it back here sometime so I can try more menu items that looked tasty. The only thing I didn't like is that they require you to hand over an ID or credit card in exchange for seating buzzer. They say its because people try to run off with the buzzing coasters--but I honestly don't think it has to be as serious as to require the hostess hold onto your personal items.

I've had two bad experiences, the first being when I tried to get my hair dyed blonde and was told many different ways it couldn't be done, some of them being \\"blonde isn't for everyone\\" and my hair was too dark. I ended up finding a different salon where the stylists couldn't believe that was said. If you personally don't feel comfortable with your ability to do something, I'd rather a stylist just be honest than make it seem as if my hair is the issue and leave me feeling self conscious. My second visit was to get my hair straightened. I thought that was easy enough and wanted to try again with this place. However my hair looked more like a blowout than professionally straightened. Next the stylist kept saying I needed a treatment and a trim. Hey I get it, make the upsell. I knew it was going to be more money but I generally trust my stylists when they say my hair needs an additional service. However, when I said okay sure, she kept making comments about how \\"clients are coming in and just adding services and it's taking me longer.\\" Why did you tell me I needed other things done and then openly complain that you were doing the things you wanted to do???? She also kept complaining that my hair was too thick and she wasn't going to be able to get lunch. As she was straightening she burned my scalp pretty badly. I yelped and sank into my chair to get away from the iron, and she denied having burned me and chastised me for jumping. I ended up apologizing for her burning me and then explaining away that maybe it was just steam or something but a couple days later found a bleeding sore from where I was burned. So both experiences made me feel as if my hair was a problem, too dark and too thick, something I wouldn't expect from a place that prides itself on caring for natural Black hair. I have a sore and bleeding scalp and am honestly going to avoid this place in the future. It sucks because the stylists seem nice enough but for how much you pay I'd expect better skill. They also seemed surprised my hair was the blonde I had originally wanted to get from them while being so strong, trying to ask which of THEIR stylists had done it.

I think the pretzels should be served with the bacon dip as well. It's the soft pretzel sticks and it's pretty awesome. I recommend getting that for sure. The bring out their house made chips as well and those are delicious too of course. We ordered the chicken and waffles, the mac and cheese, and this pork pork sandwich special that was going on that day. The mac and cheese is really good, but very non-traditional, it has corn in it. But I really enjoyed that one the best. The chicken and waffles were good, but I feel like you can't go wrong there. The chicken are chicken tenders and you get 3 to the order. The pork pork sandwich was my least favorite, but it's not a normal item anyways so I should have known better. The red beans and rice side was really good and flavorful. The seasonal vegetables I felt could have been cooked a little longer, they were still a little raw. The cornbread is awesome just like the house chips. We got the peanut butter moose for dessert and that was amazing, and goodness the portion size on that is crazy for $5!

I definitely give this place 5 stars for service alone. She was awesome, never did my drink go empty. She had an awesome personality.

We have some of the best Thai food in San Diego and I rarely eat Thai food that is comparable.  We ordered spring rolls, beef Pad Thai and Chicken Cashew.  The spring rolls were delicious.  I love the variety of fresh herbs.  They didn't bring out any peanut sauce, which I am use to, but when I asked for some they gave me some.  The peanut sauce was delicious too! The cashew chicken was good, but my lease favorite.  The chicken was a tad tough and not as flavorful as I would've liked.  There was also very little cashews.  But, overall it was acceptable.The Pad Thai was delectable. It was full of flavor and very large portion.  I liked it so much I over ate.  ÔøΩ?\\nI recommend eating here if you want great Thai food.The service could use a tad more attention, but not enough to lower my rating.  The prices were also great.

When getting inside we were quickly seated and the vibe in here was very lively and the decor had a great modern touch to it. Upon receiving my food I was delighted by the way it looked and especially with the speed it came out it. It was less than 5 minutes after we ordered that we got our food! Our waiter was very informed and told us a little bit about the restaurant and the fact that they only serve anti inflammatory foods.The only thing that I was unpleased with was the size. After leaving here I was not full in the slightest. I had to practically eat another meal afterwards which defeated the purpose of paying $25 for the food. I specifically asked the waiter about which meals were the largest and based on what he said this was the most filling menu item so although it was tasty and healthy I don't know that I'd return any time soon.

I have to say that the staff was extremely courteous and friendly, and our waiter in particular was very kind. The service was pretty speedy and we were treated very well here. I definitely applaud the staff for being so awesome! However, I did not enjoy the food as much as I thought I would. We started with the meat pies as an appetizer, but they were more like pigs in a blanket than actual meat pies. If they had clarified that these were not the actual meat pies that you typically find in Irish cuisine then I probably would have enjoyed them a little more, but I was expecting something else. The entrees were good but very expensive, especially considering the other pubs around the area (Napper Tandys, British Beer Company) serve similar entrees for much less. It's definitely possible that we just ordered the wrong things though.The desserts did look pretty good, especially the donuts.

It would have taken too long to go home and all of us were getting to a \\"hangry\\" stage, so decision made to come eat here!The restaurant is clean and bright with comfortable seats, and our Hostess/ Server was really very lovely and attentive. As soon as we ordered, gratis iceberg lettuce salad was provided, but rather than the usual peanut dressing, there was this weird mayo-sesame dressing. I didn't like the taste of it as much, but my mum was a massive fan of it. I also wanted some more carrots components in the salad.  For our drinks, we ordered Thai Iced Tea. This was delicious, with tea and condensed milk ratio just right and to my surprise, it was served in massive red wineglass. I'd def order this drink from this restaurant again.Food-wise, from the menu we ordered: 1) Veggie Penang Curry - Decent balance of the coconut cream and peanuts as the souring agent + good amount of vegetables. Overall taste was similar to Penang Curries eaten at other local area Thai restaurants. 2) Veggie green curry - taste-wise for me, this curry missed the sour + savory elements, especially the tang of lemongrass, and was more sweet with the coconut milk dominating each bite.3) Tom Yum seafood soup - YUM! YUM! fabulously cooked seafood (that was not over cooked, which is a pet peeve of mine) and with the perfect balance of hot and sour taste elements. Fave dish for me and something I would order again. Really appreciated that the Hostess came and checked with us about the soup having chicken stock base, as we'd ordered veggie options. 4) Basil Snapper - another winning dish! Snapper was so beautifully flaked and the sweet, fresh, herb taste of basil absolutely complemented the soy marinade. I couldn't stop going back again and again, for just one more bite from this dish, even after I was getting quite full! Bonus was that the leftovers warmed up quite nicely the next day, and the fish didn't dry out. Another shout -out to our lovely hostess/ server - she noticed the dish she originally bought out to our table had the wrong fish variety, and took it back to the kitchens, and bought back the Snapper. Really appreciated that honesty!Overall, we liked the food, but the seafood dishes were definitely better in taste than the veggies dishes, so we do plan to come back, however will probably stick to more of the fishy options.

If you've ever been to Thailand you'll know that this is common practice there - the royals are EVERYWHERE. The staff are friendly and welcoming, and a tv in the corner plays a never ending series of travel videos showcasing Thai and other southeast Asian cuisine.Ok let's talk the food - it's incredible. Every entree is started with a side salad with house dressing. It has a slightly sweet tang, like a poppyseed dressing minus the seeds. Really tasty. Portion sizes for meals are good - you won't really need a starter, even with a lunch-sized portion. That being said, I always get one anyways - I can under no circumstances pass up the Tom Yum Soup here. Delicious hints of lime and a spice level that gives you heat without being overwhelming. Lots of chicken and big chunks of mushroom and onion. This is a hearty soup.For entrees, you can't go wrong with any of the Thai classics - Pad Thai, Drunken Noodles, Curries - choose what sounds appealing, it will be good!

The area filled up behind as I waited... very awkward. Food was mediocre... the technique used to present the food was interesting but the flavor wasn't there. You can put a bow on a present but doesn't help if the present isn't good. The dish I enjoyed  was the dessert but dessert is hard to mess up in my opinion.

The rest of the concoction was tasty, but it was overshadowed by the fishy flavor.Equinox Salad (4 stars): This salad was quite refreshing and tasty with the cheese and walnut vinaigrette.Swordfish (4 stars): The swordfish was cooked well--but may have been slightly overcooked as it was a tad tough in my opinion. Still, the flavors were there and we both enjoyed the dish.Scallops (4 stars): Again, this dish was very good, but not one of the best I've ever had--a decent portion size though.Overall, this place looks great and the food is decent, but I'll have to admit that I was a bit underwhelmed after seeing all the praise it has gotten.

Seasonal menu directly from local farm(s) which I believe the waitress said was Silverton. We drove by intending to head to another nearby restaurant and took a chance here. No doubt, this is a gem. Typical meat proteins are moved to the side in favor of changing the mindset for what a restaurant should / could serve. It's refreshing to  partake in the menu. Some highlights:1) chirashi - perfectly seasoned rice and fresh veggies of differing textures. Having grown up on traditional chirashi  and then trying this, it definitely changed how I felt about what can go into a cherished favorite. Meat doesn't always have to be the focus  as long as flavors pop - and here they really do pop. 2) bucatini - dressed in a rich yet light sauce and al dente noodles mixed with tiny morsels of shellfish. Not a large portion, but definitely a great dish. 3) robata - skimpy skewers, maybe worth a try but not something I'd order again. We got one of each - pork and shrimp4) crusty avocado - one avocado split and crusted. Savory and tangy, a good dish to share between two to start the meal.

The inside of Zed's is nothing like the outside. The architect and the interior designer never talked. It looked like they acquired the overstock of a 1990s hotel. All of the fixtures, furniture, etc was very dated and odd when compared to the outside. We started with some OJ and it came over ice which was odd. It also only had a coffee stirrer straw so it was difficult to drink. We ordered some chicken and waffles and a Zed's Breakfast over a waffle. The chicken and waffles wasn't mind blowing but it was okay. It sure looked pretty. The Zed's Breakfast was lackluster.

This is by no means merits 5 stars.Let's go through the reasons why.- The ordering style is basically like a McDonald's, only the menu is overwhelming for anyone who's a first-timer.  I mean look at it.  It looks like a million different items that you'd be gawking at, and effectively holding up the line.  You line up at the cashier, order what you want, and then sit down.  This is a Japanese McDonald's, from the way the workers are dressed, to the way you're upsold at the counter \\"want to make a combo with miso soup and a drink?\\"- As a first timer, I ordered the most expensive item the menu(a HUGE mistake) - the 8oz. Rib Eye steak.  So they advertise that this is CAG(Certified Angus Beef).  Well if it was(and you should be skeptical of these things), it sure didn't show in the taste or how well it was prepared.  The Rib eye steak was bland.  If it weren't for the extra sauces which came with my wife's Kobe Burger & Sliced Angus Steak combo, the meal was almost like eating steak but without any salt or seasoning.  After adding those sauces, OK it was pretty good.  My in-laws' meals turned out pretty bland too.  And once again those sauces saved the day.  Moral of the story?  Order the Kobe Burger & Sliced Angus Steak combo to get those sauces.All in all just an OK experience.  Oh dear Yelpers who gave this a 3-star, why didn't I listen?\\nOh was I a fool to doubt you guys.  Oh before I forget.  The portions weren't all that filling(a common sentiment echoed amongst other reviewers too).  You will depart just a shade above \\"not hungry\\".  Even though my order came with mashed potatoes, corn, and an egg(added on, yes it was extra), by no means was I full, nowhere close.  Everyone else at my table felt the same.  Long story short, the portions are on the slim side.Just get one of the combos under the \\"green\\" section in the menu.  It's much better value.

The flavor reminded me of my childhood eating this dish at my father's friend's restaurant in San Francisco. Like the menu says itself, the chilis help balance flavors so you can't really order it without spicy. I really liked it even though I was reaching for my water a lot. 4/5IKE'S VIETNAMESE FISH SAUCE WINGS ($15.75) - We ordered it no spice because my friend couldn't handle two spicy dishes (he was already sweating from the papaya salad). It's a little pricier and the portions that you get don't match the price you pay. However it's the dish they're known for so I definitely think it's worth a try. I don't regret it at all and I loved the flavor on the wings. 4.5/5KAENG HANG LEH ($15.75) - Our waiter mentioned that this dish's broth is like curry without the coconut milk. They slow cook the pork so it was super tender. I will say that some pieces were a bit dryer (maybe because they were soaked in the broth). Speaking of the broth, it goes great on top of rice and its sweetness is a nice contrast with the spiciness of the other dishes. 3.5/5I really liked how the waiter was educated on each dish's flavor profile and how they worked with each other.

Food was oily and with tons of garlic.Let's just skip the waiting and get into the real point. The server acted like a kid and rushed us to order about 2 min after we entered our seats. Told him we needed some time because you had to read the board on the wall for the menu. The chef was amazing to do a lot of cooking on himself and we could smell what is being cooked. But I definitely didn't feel welcomed by that server. He has been teasing with the wash boy and a piece of crumpled paper was thrown into my chest. I got no apologies but his handing putting on my shoulder. OK, I was OK with this kind of casual attitude. Now let's talk about the food. The chef did add a lot of oil and butter and tons of garlic to cook the food with a strong flavor. I am OK with the flavor but my pasta was too chewy. I lost my appetite after having my calamari scampi appetizer because the pasta was cooked in a same way with same spices to the appetizer. And I am sure that the appetizer has more content for your money. The pasta was 24 bucks and came with only tiny amount of diced seafood. We had clam and calamari combo linguini and the black pasta, both of which were too oily to be finished.Last but not least, I packed my pasta carefully in the paper boxes provided to avoid the oily sauces that I got the dry stuff only. The server helped me with the other pasta by pouring all the stuff from the pan into the paper box, which I appreciated but I soon found was a disaster. I took a Lyft and the sauce packed in the box provided leaked out and ruined my pants and coat. I have had that strong garlic smell all over myself for a whole evening. To be honest, I am a fan of food seasoned with garlic but this is just way too much. I decide not to go back and not to bring my friends. The food is way overpriced and you should save your money for better service and care. $ 80 for two people (yes I still gave the server decent tips considering that my friends were happy with their lobster) can get you decent service and food in Boston.

The soft boiled egg was perfect and expertly done.  Very impressed with that.  All the condiments in the soup were good except the type of nori they used had a strong flavor to it when I usually expect a bland nori in my ramen.  The noodles were okay; I'd say a little underdone and I personally prefer a slightly thicker noodle.  The spicy bomb is chili pepper paste.  It did seem that I got far less noodles in my bowl than the person I was with, as I was essentially finished in about six bites and had to order additional noodles (after which I still had a fair amount of broth left to drink.)The brussel sprouts had a great flavor.  They are heavily charred, and all that burned flavor went very well with the sweet apricot vinegar.  Charring the sprouts so much is definitely what makes that flavor really pop, however I must say it was a little over.  While the first bite was amazing, you quickly realize just how bitter it is, and also the vast majority of the sprouts are so heavily cooked that they really don't have any bite left.  The dish as is is too bitter and salty IMO to eat without rice or some kind of starch.  A friend and I could not finish one order of it.The service here is very well organized.  There was a long line outside of the restaurant, but they cater to guests by having outdoor fans and water.  Ordering and seating is quick and efficient.For the most part, service was great.  However, when I ordered, I wanted a chili bomb with my tonkotsu shoyu ramen.  I was told they only recommend the spicy bomb and 'fire in a bowl' for tonkotsu shoyu and I wasn't allowed to order the chili bomb.  I thought this was horrendously pretentious.  To boot, if you look on their website, they have a list of \\"Ramen Rules\\" that are just absolute nonsense.  Some pseudoscience behind the reason to slurp ramen, a dictation to restrict patrons to only using chopsticks, and an emphasis on \\"never share your ramen.\\"  It's a private establishment; they can do whatever they want, but I really don't appreciate this type of thing in a business involving service and hospitality.The decor of the restaurant I like a lot, however, the seats are very high and the tables are very low.  I'm not very tall and eating here was terrible for my posture.Portion sizes are fairly small.  Ramen, extra noodles, and a side and I was still rather hungry when I left.

Super fun to make with lots of add-on topping options like lemon curd, crispy bacon bits, fresh blueberries, chopped almonds, chocolate chips, real maple syrup, sausage, peanut butter, lavender honey, and lots more.Our little party of three arrived right after opening the day after Christmas and we were immediately seated; hint - no matter what day you go, get there as close to opening as possible because the waiting line gets long quickly. We each ordered a pancake batter: one buttermilk, one chocolate, one gingerbread (their current seasonal \\"flavor\\") and then we added on the toppings to put on or in our pancakes: goat cheese, lemon curd, whipped cream, crispy bacon bits, fresh sliced strawberries, chopped pecans (all the batters and toppings are enough to share with others). We also ordered some Loaded Potatoes from the \\"regular\\" menu which are basically home-fries topped with cheddar cheese, chorizo, sour cream, and green onions. We used the squirt bottles to make fancy hearts, spirals, pug faces, squares, our names, more spirals, and some plain circles with bacon and pecans cooked right into them. The three squirt bottles of batter and the six or seven toppings were plenty for the three of us, along with the order of Loaded Potatoes. The coffee is from Stumptown Coffee which is fairly decent coffee. There are a lot of other things on their menu as well, including things like a breakfast burrito, scrambles and benedicts, steel-cut oatmeal, if pancakes are not your thing,That said, I gave them four stars instead of five because of a couple things that are important to me when I go out to spend money on food: 1) the bacon bits were stone cold so they had to be added to the pancake as it was cooking to warm the bits up, rather than added to the top after cooking the pancakes; 2) our coffee cups and water glasses weren't refilled quickly (they sat almost empty for a few minutes before they were refilled and I had to ask for a water refill at least once) and once the place filled up, which happened quickly after our arrival, the waitress seemed to be stretched a bit thin, trying to take care of all of us at her station; 3) we needed more napkins (as evidenced by the whipped cream we managed to \\"spill\\" on our table) and couldn't get anyone's attention to bring us some. Other than these few relatively minor issues, the food was good (the buttermilk pancake batter is not as \\"fluffy\\" as the gingerbread or chocolate) and I'd go back again, if only to try a different batter and change up some toppings.

Just like the restaurant itself, our waiter was trying to sell an image, perhaps because there was nothing of substance behind the mask."},{"name":"Von Ebert Brewing - Glendoveer","address":"14021 NE Glisan St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"If at all possible, ask employees to take smoke breaks out of sight, instead of a few feet from the outside seating area."},{"name":"110 Grill","address":"170 Forbes Rd","city":"Braintree","stars":"4","text":"Check your bank statement if using your debit/credit card when paying.

Regardless of its a bean and cheese burrito or a super wet one on a plate, they tend to make them very hearty. The breakfast burritos can be really awesome and really whack depending on the mishaps.

The tacos aren't all that, especially with that semi-weak tortilla, but I their fried items (nachos, taquitos, etc.) are sometimes a good option for hungover folks.There is also a salsa bar for custom sauces and they have a massive thing for all their juices.

I like good food and I love Thai and always in search for best wings. \\nMoved form New York some time ago and finally went to famous Pok Pok. \\nJust to try THE FAMOUS Portland eatery. As often, I opted, being disappointing with way to many dinners, I opted for lunch visit with my spouse.\\nSimply order: Pok Pok famous Wings and Crab Meat Fried Rice.\\n1. Wings: On a plus side the wings were prepared very fresh, extremely hot (temperature),  appetizing meal. Cooked through and hot; nothing worse than any cold or undercooked wings! Speaking of temperature, large order size Pok Pok wings are fine! BUT. I like different type of wings, I like fish sauce, but to my liking the Pok Pok wings were a little bit overpower with fish sauce taste. Bit to fishy to my liking. \\nMy second and major problem I have with wings I was served, is their crunchy coating made of.. BUNRNT prices of garlic/ginger/vegetable. There is no excuse to serve BURNT vegetable in any cousin. Period. I ma not sure if the chef had a day of or something but, please, do not burn garlic EVER!!! I ate the wings with my spouse but the burnt garlic taste accompanied us till dinner (with few snack in between!). Yes the wings skin was perfectly crispy but I the garlic too!!!! Perhaps I got some bad, short  version of 'original recipe \\" but what I was served did impressed me very much.\\n2. Crab Meat Fried Rice.\\nExpecting some kind of powerful taste of wings we ordered  second dish on much melower side. Yes, much more mellower. Simply speaking the rice (tasted first, before wings!) had not much taste whatsoever. I understand that chef did not want to overpower delicate crab meat taste but there were no much crab meat anyhow. Yes, with a help of magnifying glass you could find a few extra small pieces of crab meat- if you try really hard. So the rice instead of mellow was plain boring and should not be served as separate dish in such form; acceptable as a side dish, not main.We have noticed many visitors in Pok Pok (cameras on the table) and in my opinion, Pok Pok today is a restaurant targeting such clientele. As even relatively new Portlander, I know at least 2-3 better Thai restaurant in this town, even if sometimes \\"less authentic\\".\\n Perhaps Pok Pok was once a grat place where food was prepared in more careful way. Unfortunately I got an impression that it is just a fast production for hungry and visitors/tourist reading about Pok Pok great past. \\n Or perhaps the Real Pok Pok moved to New York leaving Portland location unsupervised and on its own power of inertia. Let's see  how they do in New York but I doubt if they survive NY competition if they served similar quality food to what I/we tasted.\\nThere is absolutely nothing I would like to come back to Pok Pok for."},{"name":"Pok Pok","address":"3226 SE Division St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Love Lol Pok's wings.

I visited Powell's more because I couldn't fathom a bookstore that encompassed an entire city block. The place is so big, they even give you a map. Trust me.

Purchase board games! Naturally. Powell's has an impressive collection.

What's totally clothes that they have a map that you pick up at the beginning of the bookstore and also spread out throughout see if you do get lost you can check out the math. The staff are super cool and friendly and nice and helpful. If you have any questions they usually know where to point you and if not I'm sure they would ask somebody.Pricing is the same as any of their bookstore they do have some still sections but there's just books everywhere.The only reason why they don't get five stars is because the bathroom is pretty gross for such a nice bookstore it really was, rundown and kind of gross I went into a couple stalls none of them have toilet paper."},{"name":"Payal chaat house","address":"12877 80 Avenue, Suite 101","city":"Surrey","stars":"2","text":"The service was really good and fast here!\\nWe were in and out within 30minutes.

The entire dining room appears to be a storehouse for Grandma's collection of crappy bric-a-brac. There is stuff EVERYWHERE. 3. The food is cheap. And you get what you pay for... The Country Fried Steak was obviously frozen. The mashed potatoes seemed like they came from a bag as well. The black eyes peas were mediocre. The onion rings tasted like fried shrimp. All of the condiments brought out to the table when our food came were Wal-mart brand. Seriously.I will give them points for a couple of things, however...

Huge chunks of potatoes with a nice creamy broth makes for a legitimate chowder. Their pizza, muffins & corn bread are always fresh out of the oven. I also love how they add new items each month based on their current theme. I believe this month is Italian, so there are different pastas, antipasto, minestrone soup and more.

Decided to try it on a whim, while scoping out my new neighborhood. Had heard good things about the family that owns it, and the 96-year-young matriarch who was the friendliest hostess around. She was't there the night I went. Too bad, she may have made the experience worthwhile.  As I pulled into the parking lot, there were a few pick-up trucks parked not nearly as between the lines as they should be. Several patrons (I assume) were huddled around the entrance way, smoking up a storm, giving me \\"the eye,\\" as I walked passed them to the entrance. Upon entering the place, a \\"unique\\" aroma wafted throughout, slightly reminiscent of a downtown subway platform. I attributed it to one or more the guests I witnessed outside. I grabbed a seat at a tall, two-top just outside of the bar rail, and next to one of the function/band areas. No band that night. The lights were dimmed in the band area, but guests were still sitting there. A table of youngin's was across from me, and their loud and frequent use of the \\"F-bomb\\" and other choice words rivaled any cable movie. Once the waitress arrived, she was pleasant and somewhat apologetic about the noisy table next to me. I ordered my food, and the only good item were the onion rings, when I covered them in ketchup. Everything else was either over cooked or just not flavorful, at all. The salad was not that fresh, and the surf & turf was bleh. Even the water tasted a bit off. I tried to enjoy myself, taking it all in. However, as soon as I finished my meal (which I woofed down in order to facilitate my rapid escape), I left. I think I spent less than 35 minutes, total, from sitting down, ordering, learning some new words, and eating in there. The decor, wasn't anything speak of. I've eaten and had drinks in many an unsavory joint (don't ask). This ranks right up there. I would unfortunately classify it as a \\"dive.\\" Now, I like some dives. And had I anticipated this being a dive, I might have lowered my expectations to enjoy it more, before going in. Disappointed, to say the least. I'm sure the family is very sweet. I know they do great charity work for Weymouth, and THAT alone deserves a great review. Perhaps it was an off-night all around.

To be fair, I didn't want to come here, I wanted to have it delivered but my mother thought this was a more reputable establishment. Oh Mom.Before I came to the building, this would have been a 4, but, here's the thing, when you come TO the building you have too much time to think. You stand in line, waiting. Don't take in the room, there's nothing to look at - they aren't wasting a dime on the decor. We placed our order, she handed us the receipt and then said, \\"I owe you $14\\" ummm, ok. So we sat. While you're waiting you think of all the things you could be doing other than sitting in an uncomfortable chair while everyone but you (I'm not exaggerating, I think they actually forgot to start our order) gets their food. The woman who placed her order after us made a joke about how odd it was that we were waiting before she left with her food. At this point, we've been waiting about 30 minutes, and my Mom is done with the nonsense and asks about the food and this girl casually says, \\"Ms. ---\\" they're starting your order. Wait what?!

I walk up and say, \\"We need our change\\" she looked at me with a confused face, which I kind of understand because - a lot of time has passed.

Ma'am, if you don't stop giving me reasons... in any other situation I would have actually snapped. But, I live up the street and know this isn't the place.

I'm really not sure what theme they're trying to pull off here. Their prices are on the steep side, and, the selections aren't that appealing.  I expected more flare on the menu given the decor and prices.  $12 for a chicken fried anything is crazy, but, their chicken was good.  Just not $12 good.  $38 for Lamb Lollipops?  Me thinks not!   I went in today for lunch.  On the lunch menu you get a choice of five starters ranging from $5 marinated olives to $12 chicken wings.  Soups and salads ranging from $5-$10, nine different sandwiches and entres, with the Cucumber BLT being the cheapest at $8.  They have five sides to choose from including fries for $6!  I ordered \\"The Burger\\" for $9. I added cheese, which cost me $1, but, I didn't find that out until the check was presented!  Not cool.  Don't slip charges into my bill.  My waiter was nice, and, it is the Holidays, so I overlooked it this time.  Instead of fries, that, accompany the burger, I opted for the $2 upcharge for the smoked bacon mac-n-cheese.  The mac-n-cheese, as a side item alone is $8.  It was pretty awesome, and, if I go back there again I will stick with that.  As for my $10 burger?  WTF!!??!!  Big disappointment!  The patty was good sized, but, it was bland as all get out and slightly over cooked.  The veggies were room temperature, and, the onion was scarce. Why do some establishments treat the onion as if it is an endangered vegetable?!  Seriously!  Onion brings flavor to the burger, IMO.  My first bite into the burger was gross.  For some reason my burger had a messy bowel movement that ended up all over my hands and fingers, and, on my plate (check the pics).  The bottom bun got all soggy and gross, I eventually got disgusted and gave up on it.  My waiter came by and offered to box it up for me.

The rest of the dishes were average at best because they really lack flavor.

They're named after the New York town they were originally harvested in.  They were pretty much like any ordinary raw oysters I've had from the East Coast.  Served six to a plate, over ice with lemon and a couple sauces.  These oysters were big, but not plump -- more long and flat.  Cold and absolutely fresh and delicious.The Pimento Stuffed Bacon Puffs were served piping hot.  Don't eat them right away or you'll burn the inside of your mouth.  These little suckers were like a mixture between a puff pastry and a sandwich overflowing with melted cheese.  Smoky flavor with a slight kick.The Purple Top Turnips were served in a black cast-iron bowl.  The turnips were cut into thick, hearty slices.  Juices welled up at the bottom of the bowl.  Crisp roots.  Combined with the greens and mushrooms, this was a very flavorful vegetable app.The Baked Escargot was heavenly.  The chubby little snails sat in a bath of butter with deep-fried strings of shallots on top to add some texture to the dish.  This was an intensely rich dish with \\"melt-in-your-mouth\\" qualities.Out of the three steaks I tried, the only one that wasn't dry-aged was my favorite: the NY strip.  Wasn't expecting that.  The NY strip was tender, juicy, and flavorful.  A wonderful steak all-around and one of the best NY strips I've tried.The Dry Aged Steak for 2 is sliced at your table.  It's the right amount of beef for two people, especially if you order apps and sides.  It's about the same size as the 22-ounce Dry Aged Cowboy Ribeye, which comes bone-in.  If you're really hungry and all you want to eat is steak, then the Cowboy Ribeye should do the trick.  It can also easily be split among a couple people.  The kitchen will split it for you.Both of the dry-aged steaks were tasty, but I thought they were a little overseasoned.  Some bites were salty, especially around the bone.  All cuts of meat were nice and thick and cooked to temperature.  The strip was still the most tender.Do order the Black Truffle Butter and put it on everything, most importantly the steaks.  It's rich and highly addictive.As for the sides, my favorites were the Roasted Cauliflower Risotto, Roasted Brussels Sprouts, and Traditional Creamed Spinach.  These were all great and full of flavor.  Brussels Sprouts appetizingly charred.  Creamed Spinach was heavy.  The Sonoma Mushrooms came loaded with a lot of sauce.  Other sides were good.George was our server and he was friendly and knowledgeable.Complimentary valet."},{"name":"Mango Mango Dessert Atlanta","address":"5177-A Buford Hwy NE","city":"Doraville","stars":"4","text":"This is a super cute dessert cafe that I always try to stop by whenever I make my trip to Atlanta.

As someone who is visiting the Nantasket area in search of a delicious lobster roll, this restaurant disappointed ten-fold. Why? Because after a 40 minute wait and a wholly unpleasant encounter with the rudest manager I've ever encountered. We never made it in to eat.\\nLet's begin with our initial call to reserve a table. Complete and utter cluster f**k. We phoned at 5pm on a Friday night requesting a table for dinner. The hostess informed us that she would not take a reservation for our party, but that they were not busy and had no wait. Our party, which included 5 adults, 2 newborn babies, and a toddler, were at the front door 10 minute after this conversation. We were immediately told to wait for the next available table. They were fully aware of the size of our party during this time.So fast-forward to 5:30pm. No table. No information. A disinterested hostess standing next to a confused busboy. My brother-in-law spots the aforementioned disinterested hostess produce at the hostess stand a crisp white sheet of paper entitled 'Waitlist.' She proceeds to write our party's name on the waitlist - mind you, our party had been waiting at that point for nearly 30 minutes. So a half hour after we arrived, they BEGAN a waitlist. Fast forward to 5:40. We ask for an update on our table. The hostess informs us they are still \\"figuring out\\" if it \\"would be possible\\" to set up a table to accommodate our party. We then were asked if we had checked in on THE THIRD FLOOR. Keep in mind, we had been waiting at the reception area within eyesight of the hostess stand for the last 40 minutes. NO, of course we did not check in on the 3rd floor. Had we known we had to check in on multiple floors to eat at the same restaurant, we would have done so.  At that point, we should have left. No self-respecting eatery would have such ridiculous rules about how to \\"check in\\" beyond the hostess stand. But, there were sunk costs - we had already been waiting for 40 minutes. Finally, the general manager / owner / local witch appeared before us to explain to the situation. But rather than simply offer an apology to established customers, she instead decided to offer her best excuse as to not only why we had to wait, but why she COULD NOT SEAT US PERIOD. She did not offer a solution, but here is a direct quote: \\"I think you need to leave now.\\" After we informed her we had been waiting for an hour, she told us it was because the restaurant was not functioning properly due to an event and the a/c being broken. LIKE. I. CARE. At this point, I just wanted a damn lobster roll and for this witch to shut her mouth. I wasn't there to be HER therapist; she is the MANAGER of the restaurant! My cousins and I are not anger management therapists, we were just seeking a place to have dinner on a summer night. This place did not deliver.

Do ya?This location varies for me between a 2 and a 4 star dining experience. The food is pretty consistent at lunch (we have never tried it for breakfast). The soups are hot with a variety to choose from, and the salad bar has all sorts of fresh ingredients that you can put together in any configuration. I especially like their dressings. The housemade ranch is really versatile and delicious.So if the quality of the food is consistent, why does it feel like you're spinning a roulette wheel everytime you walk through the door? One word: tourists. This location on International Drive is either mostly empty and ignored or the hungry hoard from the theme park descends to wreak their wrath on the unsuspecting. Today, for example, as we were progressing through the salad bar line, the woman ahead of us told her daughter no less than 12 times to stop playing with the food. The mother was clearly exhausted and wasn't in the mood to actually discipline her child. I went to the drink bar 3 times during this visit. Every single time, a child pushed ahead of me in line, once with parental encouragement.Obviously, there's nothing the restaurant can do to fix the bad behavior issue, but it is interesting to note how understaffed they are at the busiest times. Tables remain unbussed. The salad bar looks like a hurricane hit it.Overall, a good spot for fresh, healthy food for lunch and dinner, but be aware of the insanity you may be walking into."},{"name":"Morton's The Steakhouse","address":"213 SW Clay St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"The food was absolutely wonderful I had oysters on the half shell and the miso marinated sea bass superb flavors.

We tried dim sum and at this place its all marked on the form. There are the usual items and they were surprisingly very well done. It was a lot better than I remembered when we use to come here all the time. One of my favorite dishes is the stuffed eggplant with shrimp paste. It was made to order and not soggy drenched it sauce. It held its structure and was piping hot. I found their turnip cake was also seasoned very well and doesn't need additional soy sauce but a little dip on the table side hot sauce is a nice touch. Remember to ask them to pan fry it longer so it gets a crispy exterior. The rice paste was also silky in texture and not doughy and thick. The one where the rice paste is wrapped around the fried dough is one of my favorites because its give your mouth lots of different textures at the same time. I would totally come back here when were near by as its kind of out of the way but we'll try."},{"name":"Pok Pok","address":"3226 SE Division St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"We came to Pok Pok expecting good Thai food, but also a little weary because EVERYONE recommends it...could it really live up to the hype?  Well, it did.  We got here on the early side (5:30 PM on a Saturday) expecting a massive wait.  In reality it was ~20 mins. Lots of little shops and cafes to browse while you wait. We got to sit upstairs in the converted house - fun, cute, intimate. Our waiter was AWESOME (Michael).  We are fairly familiar with Thai food, but his recommendations made our meal next-level awesome.  We started with Thai tea - we did the tea + lime juice instead of evaporated milk.  I think this was the best Thai tea drink I've had.  It comes bottled, made by Pok Pok, and I am now going to do some searching to see if we can order it online. Oh and their starter spiced peanuts are delicious!\\n \\nFor food, we ordered 3 dishes for 2 (hungry) people and it was the perfect amount of food.  We started with their famous wings, and decided to go spicy.  These are NOT Thai spicy, and really it just adds a nice kick.  They were delicious - unlike any wing flavor I've had before.  They come with some lightly pickled vegetables.  We had two main courses to share. First was the Khao Man Som Tam.  ORDER THIS DISH.  As I mentioned, we are familiar with Thai food (from time in LA and time in Thailand).  We know that we cannot handle real Thai-level spice.  And we know (with reaffirmation from Michael) that this spice lives in the papaya salads.  So Khao Man Som Tam is perfect.  You get some papaya salad (spicy), some delicious meat, vegetables/cabbage, and rice.  Now I will say, we ate the papaya salad on its own as well as with the accompanying meats, etc and the spice was not the \\"make you sweat/cry\\" that we've experienced elsewhere.  BUT it was still quite the kick/punch, and I do not think we would've survived a full plate's worth.So next/last we had the Khao Soi Kai. We were looking for a mild curry and this was perfection.  It was so flavorful, and I don't really know what to compare it to because it's nothing like the Thai curries we've had elsewhere (we love those, but this curry had some unique spices/flavors).  We opted for chicken (and it's a HUGE bone-in piece).We loved our Pok Pok experience, and can't wait to come back for another visit."},{"name":"Powell's City of Books","address":"1005 W Burnside St","city":"Portland","stars":"5","text":"This place is enormous!

If you check out their website, there are more detailed lists of recommended reads from employees- freaking awesome.Also appreciated the mix of used and new books, as well as the inclusion of different products (cooking gear in the cook book section, kids things in the Rose Room) other than books available for sale. There are some adorable animal hand puppets, if you have a kid's birthday coming up- I suggest the peacock or the alpaca. You can get me one too, if you'd like.Even some more obscure sections had tons and tons of inventory to pick through, and everything was all so very organized! There are computers available to help you locate specific books by category/section and location within the physical store as well, which is a huge help even though they didn't have the econ book I was seeking.Downside to this place is the chaos during construction, the lack of nearby parking (many spaces has 15 minute limits which isn't even enough time to go through the checkout line, from the looks of it!), and the fact that such a ginormous store only has a single bathroom- and the line, of course, is horrendously long."},{"name":"Lineage Coffee Roasting","address":"3201 Corrine Dr","city":"Orlando","stars":"4.5","text":"It was late in the morning and I was cold, so I thought coffee would help.

Salt and Straw is right down the street so that kept us busy for a while.Overall, Pok Pok was dissapointing especially with all the hype it gets. While the flavors were somewhat unique, the food was incredibly salty and somewhat pricey. Ike's Vietnamese Fish sauce Wings:\\nThe fish sauce flavor was definitely there. Unfortunately, the wings were the most excruciatingly salty part of the meal. Perhaps good if you want to eat this with a bowl or two of rice. This really overpowered my taste buds and made it tough to taste. The wings were a touch crispy. The meat itself was fairly juicy and tender though! Without the saltiness, this would have been decent but I still would have expected a crispier wing.\\nKaeng Hang Leh:\\nThis was a small pot with 4 small pieces of fatty pork. Two of the pieces were half fat, the other two were fairly lean. A chunk of the pork was tasty and moist, but other parts were very dry. I'm not entirely sure why. The stew went with rice decently in moderation since it was overly salty as well.Papaya Salad:\\nFairly standard papaya salad. Has a nice kick from the peppers.

We ordered the cinnamon French toast, pumpkin mousse stuffed French toast, sausages, corned beef hash and homefries along with the cranberry pomegranate mimosa. The pumpkin French toast was amazing. One of the best things I've ever eaten. It was enormous and I polished off the entire plate which is not something I normally do! It was thick cinnamon swirled French toast with pumpkin mousse in between and caramel drizzle. Phenomenal.  The corned beef hash was also fantastic! It sounds weird to love corned beef hash but you have got to try it. The sausages were equally as amazing. Not sure how they season them but we ate the sausages in about 30 seconds. The potatoes were good, and the mimosas were ok. Tasty but not very cold so the flavor didn't really pop but still worth trying. I'd absolutely come again.

However both were not the case for when we ate these wings. They were salty but not unbearable. They had a nice sticky yet crunchy exterior, and still juicy interior. The size of the wings were also good not like other wing places which seem to find wings from tiny chickens.Thai tea with evaporated milk: 3/5\\nI like my Thai tea more on the heavy creamy side (similar to how pho restaurants make it), so this wasn't a big hit with me. I can see it for people who like less heavy cream and more on the tea flavor.Papaya salad: 4/5\\nThis was my boyfriend's request and he really enjoyed it. It came with a fish sauce dressing that complemented the salad well. The salad itself had strips of papaya in it. Overall it was refreshing and fresh which balanced out the fried aspects of the wings we ordered.Overall = 4/5\\nThe place had a nice set up with Whiskey Soda Lounge so it made waiting so much easier.

I never get it because I had been to this place couple times and never got those crazy feelings about the pasta here. First of all their sauce was super bland. Second, noodles were saggy not chewy. Third, the dining environment was not that pleasing - kind of dirty and loud. I did enjoy their aglio olio squid ink pasta and yes the flavor was great but I don't see why it is so special. I def had better pasta in LA or somewhere else. I also tried their scallop linguine with red sauce and I gotta say their red sauce was so plain. I was so shocked that how bland the sauce was. However scallop was super soft, big and fresh which I really enjoyed. The service was fast and great since there was only one old lady serving everyone. Also there is only one chef making all the pasta while another person handle cleaning. I would say I like the fact that pasta was served in a frying pan so  it was still warm and fresh when its served. I LOVE their fried calamari. The frying part was not too thick and calamari tasted fresh. I actually like their calamari way more than their pasta dish.

As soon as I walked in on a busy Saturday morning, I was immediately overwhelmed with the pastry options - I wanted everything! Eventually my boyfriend and I settled on splitting the morning bun - a fresh, flaky, sugary pastry filled with chocolate/hazelnut spread. As you can probably guess, it did not disappoint. In addition to the pastry I ordered a hot latte and he got a hot mocha. The staff was very polite and helpful and I loved seeing sustainable practices through the use of mugs, dried spaghetti as stirrers, and silverware being used.Now, all I can think of is what pastry I will get the next time I go back!"},{"name":"Sushi Kiku","address":"2770 Lenox Rd","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3.5","text":"This place has become the fall back since it's right down the street.  The people and the sushi chefs are friendly and nice.  Eating at the sushi bar is great cause you get to see what he's doing and sometimes he'll give you a taste if you've never had something before.I've had lots of things off their menu: Vegetable Tempura (good but I've had better), Dynamite (not bad, just bad for your heart with all that oil/butter), Soft Shell Crabs (very light batter and crispy goodness), Tako Su (small amount of octopus but if you were going to get wakame anyway, you might as well get this cause you get the octopus, vinegar cucumbers, and a big pile of wakame for about the same price as just getting the wakame salad).The sushi/sashimi is good and they have decent prices as well.  Mr. Sushi Chef (Kyu) says they have it flown in from many different locations and he always tells you what is good and the freshest items they have.  The live scallop they had was super tasty and uni was especially buttery the last time I went.  Rolls are rolls, but I still like them.  They make normal rolls that people know, but some specialty rolls too.  My favorite is the Viagra Roll.  No little blue pill here . . . . . They also have specials just about every night.  The ones I can remember: Tuesdays are 1/2 off wine and sake (they have fruit infused ones - woohoo!), Wednesdays are free sake bomb at 9PM, and Saturdays are 1/2 off cocktails.  There's also a night that's 1/2 off beer and a night that's 1/2 off appetizers.I've gone to the place enough that they keep my chopsticks behind the bar for me.

She wanted us to order a drink right then and there without having a chance to look it over (while sharing a menu). We asked for just a minute to decide, and that's when we lost her. She would walk past us numerous times and not make eye contact. We'd raise our hand to try and motion for her, and she'd stare strait ahead and not acknowledge us. We'd then call her, \\"Ms, Excuse me, Hi\\" nothing worked. IT TOOK AN HOUR TO ORDER A GLASS OF WINE. At this point we were laughing about it, because it was just ridiculous! My friend and I hadn't seen each other in a few years, so we were occupied catching up and chatting, but we were hungry and thirsty (she never got water and I never got a refill). I had to get out of my seat and tap on her shoulder for her to acknowledge me. Crazy. A young guy brought our wine (a Pinot grigio and a moscato) and said \\"here are your wines.\\" We asked which was which and he said \\"they are both white, I don't know.\\" We sipped the wines to determine who's was who's. Unreal. We asked him to send our server over so we could order food (app and entrees) because she's never come by in the past hour. She did, begrudgingly, and we ordered the kale and artichoke dip app and our entrees. Both the app and the entrees came at the same time, almost 2 hours after we got there. There's not a lot of room on the bar ledge and we didn't want the app with our meal, so most of it went to waste. The app was good, Id say a 4/5. My chimmichuri steak was good, a 4.5/5. The grits, which were supposed to be amazing, were just so so. My friends salmon was good.Overall, the food was pretty good. The service was god-awful and because of that, I'd never return."},{"name":"Counter Culture","address":"2337 E Cesar Chavez St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"This isn't a Give a Vegan Restaurant 5 Stars on Yelp type of review.

Everything vegan on the Island or in the City is super expensive. Counter Culture was pretty great for its food, its ambiance and its price points!This is what we ordered: raspberry kombucha (homemade by a local Austin company and sold by Counter Culture and a few other places too); raw flaxseed cracker brushetta with pesto (so good!); a tempeh reuben (very good, my wife's favorite of the meal); and a raw kelp pad thai with a ginger garlic cream sauce.I ordered the raw pad thai over the mac and cheese to try to be healthier (we had just gone to the brewery down the street), and I wasn't expecting much from it since I never had kelp noodles and figured they were gross and tasted like the sea. But I can make mac and cheese at home and I wanted to try something different.It was awesome. Easily my favorite thing at Counter Culture and my body appreciated it also. The sauce was creamy and really good, not as spicy as our waitress said but it definitely had a kick.This place got really busy too, another great sign. The waitress (Abby, I think her name was) was really awesome and very helpful. She was a vegan too, which made me trust the place even more.

Does anyone at either even care? This location, is without doubt, the most poorly managed and poorly run Panera of any one I've ever been in. The food is always inconsistent, the coffee station is always a mess and always out of the two basic coffees, light and dark roast. The staff is being poorly led by management, and when a faithful regular customer such as I complains, they do little if anything to address and resolve the complaint. They are not at all about customer service or customer satisfaction and retention, instead, they are only about the money customers spend and nothing more. I just tried to resolve a problem with a recent visit through the Corporate Consumer Relations Department and was told that they could do nothing more than a $10 gift card (less than I spent), as that is all that the Framingham manager would approve. I actually threw all the food and drinks out and went across the street to Starbucks, a far superior experience, both in food quality and customer service. I will never walk into this location again, and based on the numerous reviews I've read here on yelp, I'm far from the only one that feels this way. It's too bad that Panera Corporate doesn't care, and it's even more obvious that this Franchisee doesn't care.

Ike's Vietnamese Fish Sauce Wings are rad. Man, they are SO good. I have 3 different kinds of fish sauce in my house at any given moment so I'm a big fan. The wings have a softer breading--due to the generous tossing in the fish sauce...sauce. The half chicken is a good size and was easily shared between the two of us; it was tender and moist, but was made even bettah by the dipping sauces (tamarind and something else.) I wasn't a real fan of their Thai tea. I was glad that it wasn't crushingly sweet, but the vinegar they add...I wasn't keen on.I really liked the Pet Pha Lo: Duck leg in brothy richness, including a duck egg. It's reminiscent of hot clay pot. I had it with coconut rice--which is great here. The sticky rice, however, is not how I like sticky rice.

Also, the filling is not overly salty as I've had at other places. The dipping sauce with the chopped green onions accompanies the dumplings perfectly. The mushroom tofu soup was perfect on a rainy night. Again, it was flavourful without being overly salty. The shortribs were tender and delicious. One order comes with 3 pieces of the shortribs. The tofu soup comes with rice and banchan- bean spouts, potatoes, kimchi, and pickled radishes.  The food takes a little longer to arrive but it's worth the extra time.

It was early, around 5:30 on a Friday, and the dining room was fairly empty.  I sat at the downstairs bar.  FYI - you can order food at the downstairs bar but not at the upstairs bar.  I took my sweet time pining over the menu, ordering each course independently, and savoring each and every morsel.  I started with a nice glass of cabernet and the mushroom and ricotta toast, which was garnished with a beautiful field of micro greens and edible flowers.  Then I moved on to two roasted oysters swimming in spicy gojuchang, and finished with scallops and kimchi dotted with citrus and gojuchang sauces.  Overall, it was a wonderful meal.  Veritas has a prix fixe tasting menu, but I stuck with the a la carte menu this time, which has a wide variety of price ranges to suit everyone's needs.  I thought the ambiance in the dining area was warm and comfortable--I didn't see any of the 80's lighting that other reviews mentioned (perhaps this is only upstairs in the cocktail bar).

Finally, the lady at the counter was extremely friendly so extra points for that.

Finding one that caters to the plant-based and meat eater is near impossible! But Austin didn't disappoint with True Food Kitchen.The atmosphere is a mixture of casual but upscale. Like a good pair of black jeans that can be dressed up or down based on the occasion. The menu was elegant, offering thoughtful, health conscious offerings with a close attention to flavors. The menu concept is seasonal with winter staples like root vegetables and hearty bowls accompanying standards like pizzas and sandwiches sure to please any carnivore.But how would they actually enjoy it?I tried the Kale Aid refresher. It was a strong kale, ginger cocktail with seltzer water. I think \\"refresher\\" was an unfortunate word choice because while I was invigorated by it's potency, it wasn't mellow like I expected. But as Kale juices go, it was a quality drink. Just strong. We shared the hummus and pita chips (which were soft pieces of pita, not the crunchy chips). The hummus was garnished with cucumbers, tomatoes and feta cheese in the middle (so ask for no dairy if you don't want the cheese). I love hummus and this was *really good* hummus. My dinner guests had the Margherita pizza and grilled chicken salad- and both were pleased with what was served. I took a chance on the ancient grains bowl with tofu (you can also pick steak, fish or chicken) and was pleasantly surprised with the flavorful combo of sweet potatoes, savory quinoa, saut√©ed mushrooms onions, and slice of avocado.

My husband wanted to check out Vittles due to their constantly packed parking lot and hole-in-the-wall appearance. I find little dives a little cringe-worthy, but that's just me. It took a minute and several lungfuls of second hand smoke before we found the non-smoking section, and sat in a tiny booth under dangling Christmas ornaments. We placed our order for breakfast with a friendly server, and asked questions like \\"is the corned beef hash from a can or made fresh?\\", and started entertaining ourselves by reading all the knickknack signs and t-shirts for sale. Then we waited. When we were done waiting, we kept waiting. We waited for 45 minutes for our food and unfortunately had to ask for to-go boxes and the check as soon as they set the plates down. I snagged a bite of fried potato from my plate (because I was starving and now running late for work), and of course it was cold. My husband also reported that his corned beef hash was most definitely not made in house. Bummer. I drove all the way to work with the taste of grease still in my mouth and nuked my cold omelet and potatoes in the break room microwave. Vittles has two huge rooms of tables. The restaurant was full but not overly busy. I'm not sure why it took so long to get our food, but my guess is that the kitchen was in the weeds or couldn't handle the capacity. Sorry Vittles, but with so many other breakfast joints to explore, this non-smoker probably won't risk another cold omelet."},{"name":"Powell's City of Books","address":"1005 W Burnside St","city":"Portland","stars":"5","text":"Everything.

Just a heads up- there is no pad thai, fried rice, or anything like that here.We ordered 4 dishes:\\n-Their famous Ike's Vietnamese fish sauce wings ($15.50) for about 6 pieces. This was so salty and way overpriced for the amount of meat on the chickens. If you order this, you will definitely need to order a side of rice to go with it.-Papaya pok pok ($9.50) - basically a papaya salad. I've tried a few papaya salads and this one was not very good. It was salty and a little spicy.-Neua Naam Tok ($15.50) - this was a spicy flank steak salad and the portion is so small!! It was also so salty and when we were served it, it was strange because it was neither cold or hot, just room temperature. -Kung op wun san (16.50) - glass noodles, shrimp, and pork belly in a hot pot. This was not too bad but the portion of noodles is so little for the price. Overall, I didn't have a very good experience here. Everything was extremely salty, and if you do eat here, definitely order some rice. I think that you should save your money and try somewhere new.

I had the turkey club. I would not recommend this, but my waitress recommended it over the chicken quesadilla. The wheat bread was thin and, although toasted, still soft. The turkey was lack luster at best. It reminded me of low level deli meat, not like a Boars Head but more of a Walmart brand. And there was way too much turkey, a mountain of the stuff that overpowered a zesty sauce and avocado, which probably would've been delightful had they not been hiding in the turkey mountain.

We also shared the farro salad. Again. Delicious. And then the check came. What?!? Under $25? Is this even the right bill? It was fantastic.

Now they are spread across the city.  Lucy's is all about the fried chicken and they cook it fantastic.  Quality seasoning, breading and cooked tender.   You can also grab chicken & waffles, tender, sandwich, salad, or you even have the option for a burger.  Lucy's does not skimp on the sides, so just order one.  Fully stocked bar and that is where you walk up to place your order.  Several Austin local beers are served here.  Plenty of seating and a nice patio.  Huge playground area for your kids to enjoy. I like how they offer several different hot sauces to go with the food.  I will say Lucy's certainly excels in fried chicken.  It is cooked well, seasoned right and has great taste and texture.  The sides taste great and I even ordered a waffle on the side.  One reason I like this place it stays true to South Austin styling.  It isn't cheap fried chicken (avg meal prob around $15) so lets be clear, but it certainly has a superior better taste then an average fried chicken spot.

If you loveeee garlic, green goddess is for you. The rebel and adventurer are quite similar but I personally liked the rebel because of the added flax oil that makes the ingredients creamier and easy to chew. I've also tried the carrot cake and golden sunrise smoothie. They are both SOOO GOOD. The golden sunrise was my favorite because it is so flavorful. It's sweet with a tumeric punch. I've ordered through postmates twice and came into the restaurant once. If it's your first time, I would suggest going to the restaurant and eating the bowl while it's hot. The ambiance of the restaurant was earthy and natural. Plants are settled at every corner. You order at the register, get a number, and find a seat either upstairs or downstairs.

I couldn't see my steak and Im suspicious that thats part of the plan. It costs an addition $13 for a baked potato if you like a potato with your steak. Forgot what the fishy caesar cost but all I can say, is that there isn't enough value here for how much you pay. Ring Side is comparable in price but our experience there exceeded this by far.

First, let me just say that my husband has been a part of the Landry club for years and we regularly go to the partner restaurants (and very much enjoy our experiences), but this is the first time I've been to this location.Went here a little while back right before a theater show across the street at the Keller Auditorium (and when I say *right* before, I mean we had 5:45 reservations before a 7:30pm show time... i.e. in theory we had plenty of time). Fast forward to well after 6pm when our table finally got our menus, courtesy of a rather snobby waiter who said things along the lines of \\"I assume you know what desserts take longer and to order them now if you want to be out of here on time\\". He didn't acknowledge me when I said no and asked what they were... I just moved here so really, how would I know? That was the first of several times I was ignored over the night.I did end up having a few questions about the drinks/menu, but the waiter was hardly there to be found (despite being a 60-70% full restaurant... it's before 6pm on a Friday, so not overly crowded at all). I kept trying to ask one of the million bus boys and water-fillers, but they didn't seem to know. No biggie, but then where is someone who does??Finally we were brought bread in a hunk. Literally, a huge hunk the size of almost a basketball that was uncut. Trying to cut this in any sort of tasteful manner at a 'fine dining' establishment was nearly impossible. The butter was great but only enough for about 3 \\"slices\\" worth of the bread. I asked for some more butter but that didn't arrive until nearly when the meal did. So we all felt awkward pulling at this lump of bread like cavemen (one simple knife was not doing the trick at all). Fast forward nearly an hour after we first sat down and we finally got our food. I'm not a big red meat person so I ordered the shrimp pasta (along the lines of shrimp scampi). Apparently the waiter \\"assumed\\" again, because I was given a steak knife for my pasta. I just wanted to trade it in for a very large spoon to twist up the pasta on, but again couldn't locate the waiter. I ate what I could but the shrimp was highly rubbery and burnt and the pasta sauce was rather bland. When I finally found him, I asked for my spoon and also my bread plate back (for the shrimp tales) most everyone else at the table was done. This is nearly 7pm. Based on the timing of the rest of the night, the fact that I wanted dessert was trumped by the fact that we wouldn't be able to get it and make it to the first half of the show, I decided not to order. Bottom line, the servers were hovering when you didn't want them there and invisible when you did; the food was unimpressive and the experience was not something that will lead me to be back."},{"name":"Kevin Rathbun Steak","address":"154 Krog St","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Dined here 5 years ago and it was the BEST steak I've ever had so we decided to go back for our anniversary.

I entered the restaurant this evening and instead of being greeted, she looks at me after putting away the menus.  I tell her we are a party of five. She gruffly tells us we need to wait bc she needs to set up our station.  Ok, maybe she had a bad day ? Did I disturb her while she took her sweet time putting away the menus?  I wait with my party.  Then enters a older Caucasian gentleman and she greets him.  Not sure what her deal is? Maybe she doesn't like the non-Caucasian people? Maybe he's a regular ?  Maybe she doesn't like Asians?The meal itself was excellent and our server was friendly.  She joked with us the whole time and made the meal somewhat better.  She recommended my uncle the tortellini carbonara. It surpassed my chicken parm by leaps and bounds. It was very rich and satisfying. The cream sauce was delicious.

The menu is the same for lunch as dinner but most items are priced a few dollars cheaper. I'd assume the portions are the same, our lunch portions were substantial.Since we were really hungry we started with the fresh rolls, $3. Surprising, I think these were better than any I've had at the other Vietnamese restaurants on Colonial. So fluffy, fresh, accompanied with nice presentation of a radish flower and peanut dipping sauce.For our entrees we both ordered from the stir fry section. My fianc√© ordered the Pra Ram with pork, $8.95. His dish came with a good portion of broccoli, zucchini and carrots. The peanut sauce was perfect. I went with the Prad Priew Waan with chicken, $8.95. It's essentially sweet and sour but not breaded and fried. I definitely like the semi more healthy option, the dish had peppers, pineapple, tomato, cucumber and carrots. I ordered it medium to hot but it wasn't spicy at all, I think with this sauce it won't really be to spicy.Both dishes came with a small salad to start, I was so excited for this, I think I was just really hungry but I'm use to South FL restaurants always giving a side salad with your entree.

Period.This was not a planned visit -- a random choice after finding ourselves roaming the Coolidge Corner/Harvard Street neighborhood looking for dining for 5 -- including kids.  Since pizza is always an easy sell for the young ones -- Prairie Fire is where we went.  We walked in without reservations and were seated right away -- around 6-ish on a Thursday. I was attracted to the look of the place -- clean lines -- architecturally  minimalist fit out with floor to ceiling windows.  It looked as good from the outside looking in as it did the other way.  The fact that PF offers wood fired baking only added to my interest because where there is smoke -- there is more flavor -- and I so like smokiness in my food.  The menu is shockingly brief actually -- so I figured the chef must have plenty of confidence in his choices -- this being a brand new joint just several months old -- and in doing so PF is putting it all on the line.  That said -- most everything we ate was well seasoned and well prepared -- and mostly beautiful to look at too.My start was not auspicious though.They ran out of my favorite dirty martini gin (Bombay Sapphire) and they don't have proper martini glasses.  Drank mine from what looked like a wine glass.  Need better olives too -- but I quibble.  These are details that can get worked out.  Also, the focaccia served gratis (I had to ask for this) was not crusty -- mushy actually -- unlike the best versions of this bread -- it just needs more oven time. But the wine list is decent -- and we enjoyed a good Barbera by the glass. Foodwise -- we started with oysters -- a dozen raw and another dozen baked in the wood fired oven.  They were spectacularly fresh and briny -- meaty and perfect in every way.  If I had to choose I would say go with the wood smoked version -- still on the raw side but with amped up flavor from the smoke and yummy char marks on the shells.  The de minimus seasoning -- served over mounds of damp salt -- was all that these bivalves needed -- with cocktail sauce on the side.The other starter I really liked was the crudo special -- raw fluke topped by shaved watermelon radishes and roasted maitake mushrooms.  This was a spectacular presentation and ate like sashimi with attitude.  You could taste the smokiness in the mushrooms and the fluke had just enough acid and seasoning to make it almost like ceviche. We also ate their two signature pastas -- the squid ink campanelle with lobster and the special gnocchi with duck ragu.  The gnocchi were soft pillows -- melt in your mouth tender with a nice pan sear -- topped by chunks of duck and shavings of parmigiano-reggiano.  This was excellent.Squid ink pasta is more of an aesthetic thing -- I never did quite get the subtle flavor that the ink imparts -- especially after added seasoning and lobster takes over.  But it looked great in deep gray colored earthenware  with plenty of lobster chunks.  Very satisfying dish topped by crispy bits of what tasted like sauteed garlic and panko for textural interest. Our boys ate a margherita pizza which for me was the only food miss of the evening.  The dough was too thick and not charred through as you might expect from the most authentic versions of this kind of wood fired pie.  Too chewy.  But the dough flavor was good and the marinara and mozzarella toppings authentic enough.Top Tip:  This is a trendy new place so expect to pay $50-$75 pp for the fit out and the vibe plus drinks.  For my money -- it is worth a look if you like rustic Italian with flair and ambiance matters."},{"name":"Sam LaGrassa's","address":"44 Province St","city":"Boston","stars":"4.5","text":"I got the Pastrami Diablo and it was excellent.

Piazza Italia is way up there on the authentic Italian carb lovers scale. I've been driving past this place for quite some time and a friend and I decided to make reservations for lunch.  Just so everyone knows they close between 3-5 PM to get ready for the dinner rush.  Parking is always a bit of a challenge but that's the Pearl. Family owned and located in the Pearl, this place is always busy so I suggest reservations.  The place is small and intimate.  They do have a few tables open during the good weather months outside on the sidewalk which is nice.  The interior is just that of a cute little Italian Caf√©.  The ceiling is covered with autographed soccer jerseys which is the owners passion.  There are TV's with soccer playing. The smells are delicious, real and give you that homey feel.  Also, the waiters are very good looking... and \\"no\\" I wasn't imagining that.  :-)Since we had a reservation we were seated immediately and provided with water and a drink order taken. The waiter was very nice and very prompt.  We received their delicious crusty Italian and wheat breads with an olive oil and spice mixture for dipping.  The bread was delicious as well as the dipping sauce. We ordered up a Lasagna (baked pasta with beef, veal and b√©chamel filling $13.50) and a Rigatoni Bolognese (rigatoni pasta with slow cooked pork/beef sauce $12.75).  FYI salads are a la carte.  There is an extensive wine list as well. After eating bread like crazy for about 10 minutes (so good) our entrees came.  Mmmm...melt in your mouth goodness and they looked as good as they tasted.

Waiting long hours to eat here would have made me an extra grumpy cow.We had big plans for dinner, so decided on two dishes, rice and beers.  The wings were flavorful and so was the pork belly/shoulder curry.  Sticky rice is definitely a must with these dishes.  The portions were a bit laughable but at least they were tasty.  However, after a few bites, the salt/sugar/fish sauce just overwhelmed everything.Afterwards, we figured that their dishes were overpriced by about $3-5 each.  Seriously.  Maybe it's because we live in the SF Bay Area and can get super yummy Asian food on the cheap?  I dunno.  It's a cool concept and the ambiance kind of transports you to an eatery in Bangkok (music, utensils, colorful string lights, etc).

She put the water glasses in a big communal pile in the  middle of the table and we had to pass them around.

There was no mistaking that he was politely speaking to the waitress saying \\"excuse me\\" 3-4 times and she ignored him. Once again we got up and took a soda out of the fridge.Same issue with chop sticks. I asked for some while making eye contact and she turned away in the middle of my sentence and ignored me. I found some difficult to use metal ones on the table.When it came time to pay the bill we needed a 3 way split. 2 groups of 2 and one on their own (one of our six didn't order).

A year and half later, we finally made our way there!  Unlike other reviews, there wasn't a wait and there were probably 2 other tables in the entire restaurant.  The woman behind the host stand told us that the host will be right with us and proceeded to play on her phone for 5 minutes in front of us until the hostess arrived (the girl on the phone ended up being our server) and should've been our first red flag.  The hostess sat us at a table and our server ignored us for another 10 minutes and was quite rude when asking for drink orders.  She left and ignored us for another 10 minutes.  We finally ordered our dinner and it didn't take that long to get food to us.  We ordered two plates and a side of rice for 2 adults.  The plates were extremely small and overpriced, the food was pretty delicious.  Summary:  overpriced, small plates, bad service- but decent food.  We probably won't return due to the rude service we received but it was an interesting flavor experience."},{"name":"En Fuego Cocina Mexicana","address":"131 Rantoul St","city":"Beverly","stars":"3","text":"I am so disappointed in this place.

I was shocked and could not believe it. I confirmed with the rest of my family and asked Gene what this looks like to him. He apparently claimed it was part of the vegetables and asked someone in the kitchen who claimed it was part of the fish bone. It's sad that no one working there could confess that it was a worm. just own up to it and be honest!!Anyone who would have seen it could tell it was a worm. I know what I found and saw. The food here is definitely not worth the price either. STAY AWAY from the Cajun Oysters too. They were not properly cleaned and when i cut one open, there was a smell green poop looking paste inside which looked like poop. The taste and smell was disgusting. Again I asked Gene our server what it was and he had no clue. I filled out the survey and handed it to the manager. She was courteous and empathetic towards our experience.

I still think the buzz is overrated.  We waited an hour and a half for a party of 6 at around 7:30 pm. I don't mind long wait times when the food justifies it, but it did not in my experience.SERVICEService was weird. Attentive check ins, but we asked for cilantro on the side twice and they put it in the dishes anyway. We'd understand if we were told that separation was not possible given the cuisine. Instead, we were assured it could be done and it wasn't.Moreover, our server came by to explain for a second time that we were supposed to squeeze the lime over our catfish when he noticed we had not gotten to it yet. I don't know why he felt the need to do this. It was as if he were afraid that we were not familiar with limes. (He was never rude about it.)FOOD ORDERED- Fish sauce wings, regular and spicy. They were extremely crispy, but they destroyed my taste buds with their sheer amount of sodium. The wings tasted overwhelmingly of fish sauce, which masked any complexity that might have been present. The spicy wings had a gentle heat which amplified the saltiness.- Kung Op Wun Sen (prawns and glass noodles in a clay pot). If there were any other meats, I don't recall because there were so few. Our scant amount of shrimp were overcooked. Worse, the glass noodles were bland and dry like the Sahara. They stuck uncomfortably to the insides of my mouth and I almost choked on them. The cilantro dipping sauce on the side was good, but I didn't understand how that was supposed to relate to a clay pot dish with noodles. - Cha Ca La Vong (fried catfish on vermicelli noodles). The lime and basil were refreshing, but the pineapple sauce contributed no flavor. It actually made the noodles very slippery and greasy feeling. Additionally, the catfish didn't taste like any special spices. The saltiness was fine, but I noticed you get far more noodles than fish.- Broken Crepe. The flavor profile was okay. I liked the bean sprouts, but the mussels were overcooked and the egg crepe became soggy very quickly. Why order something fried if it's not going to stay crunchy? The salt level was okay, only a fraction too light.- Coconut rice, an additional $2.75 per bowl, was more coconut scented than coconut flavor. I expect a can of full fat coconut cream to be dumped into the rice if I'm paying extra for this.- Pork belly curry. Tender pork but again extremely salty and not a lot of pieces in the portion. The curry didn't taste like any Thai or Asian curry for that matter. It was more like a soy sauce braising liquid.- Durian sticky rice. I don't like durian, but I was critical of this dish due to the durian having no scent. It was a dull yellow brick on top of the rice. It did not resemble fruit or have flesh/pulp. I want to give them the benefit of the doubt, but how can you pay for durian and not have a strong and pungent durian? The rice was good though, salty and sweet.- The free water was absolutely fantastic. I am NOT joking. It tasted as though it was soaking in a coconut shell for days, and I noticed it immediately when I took my first gulp. 10/10"},{"name":"Border Caf√©","address":"32 Church St","city":"Cambridge","stars":"4","text":"Food is great and simple...that's what make the Border Cafe so special.

Proof's in the pics - all sense of texture tossed out the window on account of a bread foul. Flavor was there (save the pork), but gimme that press, folks!The real ding came from the roasted brussels sprouts, which were completely boiled to mush and bitter as hell.

Its spans all the way to the back with an outdoor eating area and another separate small house. Surprisingly, our wait wasn't too long (~10 mins) with the rush of the SXSW convention event nearby but our food did take awhile before coming out. Luckily they give you popcorn as an appetizer first. Popcorn was on the saltier side due to the seasoning. We opt to order the pimento cheeseburger with fries and the steak fajita salad. I've read reviews of people really loving the food, but to me I thought the food was average. The food overall was good but nothing too special or rave worthy for me. The cheeseburger was like your average cheeseburger, but the patty was very fulfilling. I thought the steak fajita was on the dry side but it's a unique take on a salad as a whole. Overall, I would've given the food 3 stars but the service was good throughout the meal. Our waiter was courteous, friendly, and checked back often. Also, it's pretty unique to dine in a place like this. They have a long history dating back to the 1830's and it's one of the oldest commercial buildings in Austin. Once was a parlor and a saloon with several businesses occupying the space in the past. Moonshine is the second restaurant to open up here and Waterloo comes from the Waterloo settlement in 1800's. So, with the history I would say this place is worth a try if you're in the area. They have other food options too and there's a extensive list of drinks options. I hear they also have a brunch buffet on Sundays? No legit parking lot though so I guess\\npeople do the valet option or park somewhere else.

I'm not vegan or vegetarian, but I'm trying to eat healthier while I'm on the road for work. Counter Culture is a great place to eat,  even if you like a good steak. I had the Mac and cheese, beets and sweets, and the bbq jackfruit. Everything was great!  The broccoli in the Mac and cheese has good texture, not mushy at all. The beets and sweets were delicious, these will definitely go on the menu at home. The jackfruit was surprisingly good - I could probably eat that as an entree. Service was casual and prompt. The parking is a bit of a hassle, but a short walk never hurt anyone. Prices are good, expect $20-$25 with tip. Oh, they also notate soy free dishes, do big plus there. How are people still falling for soy?I'd go back."},{"name":"Pho Dai Viet Restaurant","address":"4279 Roswell Rd NE, Ste 206","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4.5","text":"From the family of Pho Dai Loi, Atlanta's best pho restaurant, comes Pho Dai Viet. This is North Buckhead's first truly authentic Vietnamese restaurant. The business' official grand opening was January 11th, 2018.The restaurant opened inside busy Chastain Square (Publix shopping center). I've never been to this shopping center when it's not busy. That said, while the parking lot is often congested, I've never had a problem finding a space. If facing Publix, Pho Dai Viet is in the back-left corner of the plaza.As a big fan of Pho Dai Loi on Buford Highway, I was very interested in checking this place out and seeing how the restaurants compared. I think the pho at Pho Dai Viet is just as good as Pho Dai Loi. Also, Pho Dai Viet's meat quality is arguably better. However, Pho Dai Viet has a smaller and simpler menu, so you can't get all of the ingredients here that you can get on Buford Highway. One example, which is one of my favorite pho ingredients, is tripe (beef stomach), so that was a bit disappointing for me.One way to describe Pho Dai Viet is it's like a classed up and more simplified version of Pho Dai Loi. It makes sense given the neighborhood. The menu isn't as adventurous. For example, a couple of my favorite dishes at Pho Dai Loi, pho dac biet and com dac biet (special combination pho and rice entrees), aren't available here nor is bun bo Hue (a noodle soup made with beef, lemongrass, pig knuckle, and congealed pig blood, among other ingredients). Fortunately, the menu still offers some good stuff.The menu features fried egg rolls, fried shrimp rolls, and fresh spring rolls (each 2 for $5), banh mi sandwiches ($6 each), pho and beef stew (bo kho) in two sizes (medium $12, large $14), vermicelli noodles (bun, $13), and rice plates ($13-15). As for beverages, they offer a decent amount of Vietnamese drinks like fresh lemonade with club soda (soda chanh, $5) and coconut juice (nuoc dua tuoi, $4) along with smoothies (e.g. avocado, mango, taro) with tapioca (boba). The prices here are a bit higher than what you can find on Buford Highway, but again, given the neighborhood, it's no surprise.When ordering pho or vermicelli noodles at Pho Dai Viet, you can choose up to 3 different kinds of protein to add to your bowl. Each additional pho protein costs $1.50.I had a large bowl with eye of round steak (tai), well-done flank (nam), and brisket (gau). In hindsight, I should've added beef meatballs (bo vien) too. One of the folks at our table got those and they looked delicious. The pho tasted great. The broth was excellent -- clean, fragrant, and full of flavor. The meat quality was very good and among the best I've had in Atlanta. The brisket in particular was tender and savory. I noticed my bowl wasn't loaded up with as much meat and noodles as Pho Dai Loi, but sometimes, I think Pho Dai Loi can give you too much. The bowl becomes heavy and dense and the flavor profile of the broth changes. It's a fine balance and I'm not complaining either way.Customary pho sides include raw basil, bean sprouts, culantro (cilantro's cousin - I'm happy they have it here), jalapeno, and lime. I like to throw everything into my bowl and use hoisin and Sriracha as dipping sauces. Sometimes, I put the sauces in my broth too. The sides were fresh. Another item I tried was the grilled lemongrass chicken rice (com ga nuong xa, $13). This dish consisted of broken jasmine rice and two pieces of chicken breast that are served pre-sliced. Sides include cucumber, lettuce, tomato, pickled carrots and daikon, and Vietnamese fish sauce (nuoc mam). I thought this dish was A-OK. It's fairly straightforward and relatively healthy. Chicken breast isn't one of my favorite meats, but Pho Dai Viet gives it nice flavor and cooks it just right so it's not too dry. I love the finer consistency of the fragmented rice - it tastes more delicate - and the fish sauce is a must. Pour it over everything.My friends have gotten the chicken pho (medium, $12), coconut saute chicken (also made with chicken breast, $14), and vermicelli noodles with shrimp ($13). The coconut saute chicken dish is more like a chicken chunk stir-fry with other ingredients like onion. It's prepared with coconut juice. It looked tasty. The vermicelli noodles come with lettuce (beneath the noodles), crushed peanuts, fried shallots, and pickled carrots and daikon. Everyone enjoyed what they got.I also had a Vietnamese iced coffee with condensed milk (ca phe sua lanh, $5). Each order comes with its own individual single-serving-size coffee filter. You can see the layers of condensed milk and coffee and must mix them together yourself. The coffee was quite sweet and quite strong. I really like Vietnamese iced coffee. This was one of the sweetest and strongest I've tried. It was good, but I think I would have liked it more if it was dialed back some.Service was terrific. Our orders came out in a reasonable amount of time and we were well taken care of."},{"name":"Avalon Pockets","address":"3564 Tanja King Blvd, Ste 2","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"I decided to give this place a second chance as the first time I visited I did not have a great experience. After reading some of the other reviews it appears that they have changed ownership which in my opinion is for the better. When I arrived I was nicely greeted by a gentleman who I assume is the owner. I reviewed the menu and decided to get the Almond Rice. Since I have never tried this particular dish I wasn't sure what to expect but I was willing to be adventurous. I decided to take my order to go so I waited probably about 10 minutes before my dish was completed. You're probably wondering what is Allmond rice. Well it is a lot of rice mixed with bits of chicken, almonds and peanuts and different Mediterranean spices. It is served with a side of freshly made Taboule , two fresh pieces of kibbeh and a side of Tzatziki sauce. I didn't know what to expect because the last time I visited the food was not great at all but I was so surprised after my first bite! I haven't had Taboule this good since leaving home where there is a huge Lebanese and Greek community. The Kibbeh was cooked perfectly. It even had pine nuts inside so this is the real deal. It's pairs nicely with the homemade Tzatziki sauce. Now how do I describe the rice? It's not your typical rice dish. It has a very nutty and hearty flavor which is a good thing. They gave so much that I literally have enough rice for the next three days!Their menu consists of several different Greek menu items from salads to Gyros, chicken Slovaki, hummus etc and desserts. Since I didn't stay to eat inside I'm not sure whether or not they serve beer and wine. They do have approximately 8 to 10 tables with chairs and the TV so you can bring the family and sit and watch TV. It's truly a family-style restaurant. They have daily specials that appear to be pretty reasonably priced. I'm really happy that I decided to get this place a second chance.

Otherwise... this is a one-star review for the manager in particular.My children took me to One Bistro yesterday for Fathers Day brunch.  Party of six, with a reservation for 11:15.  We stood right next to the hostess's podium, and yet she somehow forgot us until 11:22.  When she \\"noticed\\" six people blocking access, she brought us to a table, but could only find three menus.  Several minutes later, she returned with three more menus.  Of course by that time, we had already shared among ourselves.  Our excellent waitress, Arcely, took orders quickly.  And then... the long wait began!The open kitchen was apparently unprepared to provide things as simple as eggs Benedict, waffles, pancakes, in any kind of efficient way.  We watched four cooks bump into each other for quite a while.  At 12:25 pm, Jemo, who apparently is the manager, came to our table with the most insincere apology I've ever heard.  And when asked how much longer, he became somewhat beligerent.  When pressed, he mumbled \\"five or ten minutes,\\" and walked away.  A table nearby, who it appeared waited even longer, were told by this alleged manager, \\"Well, this isn't Denny's.\\"  No kidding.  Denny's would have had us fed and out the door in less than an hour!  We did get our food just short of the promised ten more minutes.  Good food, but not worth the wait!Overall, an unfortunate experience.  Perhaps if Jemo were more interested in managing, instead of spending all his time leaning over the open wall into the kitchen, apparently contributing nothing, things could have been different.  With the number of options in the area, we won't be heading back to One Bistro any time soon."},{"name":"Slappy Cakes","address":"4246 SE Belmont St","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"After reading a guestbook at an Airbnb, we decided to try out Slappy Cakes after everyone said this was a great place to go for breakfast.

The ensalata bomba salad was a particular stand out- deliciously acidic and herbaceous with a perfectly balanced vinaigrette. I could eat this salad every day and not get bored. Don't be discouraged by small portions of meat. You will be full of yummy vegetables.I recommend saving room for dessert. The salted butter semi-freddo was incredible and interesting in the way that makes you want to keep eating it forever. If you are a panna cotta fan as I am, the milk chocolate was also mind numbingly good with perfectly popped sorghum on top.This is a new and hot place that lives up to (and exceeds!) the hype.

There is nothing wrong with the latter and I have had many good American Chinese meals but Chinese cuisine is infinitely more complex and varied than the way it is usually represented in the U.S. This is a small restaurant that serves authentic Taiwanese food (see the menu photos). If was in a group larger than 4-6 people, I would consider eating at a bigger restaurant instead. Be prepared to encounter dishes with bone-in meat, good amounts of fat, and other odd bits like pig ear and beef intestine. You could play it safe and not order with that much authenticity of course, but if you want authentic food, that's what you might get.Orders are taken at the counter, the food is made to order and then brought to your table. The service was friendly. I ordered the Zha Dou Fu (fried tofu) and Zha Yu Pai (fried fish filet). My daughter had the orange chicken. Each meal came with some noodles, veggies on the side (mainly broccoli), white rice and a soy egg. The portion sizes were definitely sufficient for lunch. The food did taste good but I honestly had higher expectations. My veggies were a little overcooked and soft, my fried fish was good but seemed like it could have used some kind of sauce. I tasted a piece of my daughter's orange chicken and it was just a tad more sour than I prefer.I would consider coming back to this place because they do have bunch of other things on the menu that sound interesting and tasty. In hindsight, we should have probably ordered some more authentic Taiwanese dishes for a more exciting eating experience."},{"name":"Powell's City of Books","address":"1005 W Burnside St","city":"Portland","stars":"5","text":"A book store actually cool enough to be considered a tourist trap.

Look up your lunch options in advance and check reviews. I was thrilled when I came across Fish Bowl Poke and learned that it was just a few minutes from my meeting. They have 4 locations in Georgia ( Sweet Auburn, Downtown, Toca Hills, and Hapeville). This location is opened Monday through Saturday 11 to 8pm. There are a few free parking spots in front of the restaurant or you can locate free 2 hour street parking. Fish Bowl provides Hawaiian fresh pok√® (raw fish salad) at a reasonable price with great service. This location is fairly small and recently opened, there's a few tables located inside but if you're claustrophobic I recommend getting it to go. I was immediately greeted as I entered. I had read reviews online so I knew the process. You pick up a laminated menu card and select your options, its very simple and also eliminates or reduces error since it's not a poke bar. You select your size, base, protein, marinade, toppings and aioli.I selected a regular bowl for $10.95, which includes 2 scoops of protein. I love spicy so it was not a difficult choice, I selected spicy tuna and salmon, brown rice and salad, spicy soy, spicy aioli and all toppings. The wait was pretty quick for a lunch time order to go. I also ordered an ice Vietnamese coffee.Food - Beautiful presentation and most importantly it tasted very fresh and just overall delicious.

Wasn't a big fan of the sweet potato texture on the ceviche because it doesn't taste like Peruvian sweet potatoes, but everything else on the dish was great.The anticucho (cow heart) was prepared well and yessss I definitely recommend you give this a try if you are feeling ADVENTUROUS, It's authentically delicious! Restaurant was well maintained with clean bathrooms. It has an interesting large tv on the outside sitting area. The service was a tad bit confusing we kept having two different ladies come to our table often. Definitely a casual place to visit and fairly priced."},{"name":"What's Pho","address":"5840 W Irlo Bronson M Hwy","city":"Kissimmee","stars":"3","text":"Super-excited when I recently saw this new restaurant pop up on the 192 strip near Old Town in Kissimmee. When you live in the area, it's a lot more convenient than making the trip up to Colonial in downtown Orlando. And they're open late...which is awesome!Service is fast and the staff is friendly. The food is tasty but a little more pricey than a regular Pho joint. And it would be nice if they had lunch specials. I ordered the Pho with meatballs, sliced beef, and tripe and it seemed to be missing the extra plate of lime and fresh basil and sprouts, but I see it in another reviewer's photo so maybe it was just an oversight. Looking forward to returning and checking out the Thai options on the menu.

The ONLY reason I didn't finish all my food was because I possibly couldn't. I don't even like French toast - and this was phenomenal. The pancakes were some of the BEST I've ever had. They were light, fluffy, with hints of lemon and a little bit of sweetness. The service, the food, the cleanliness, the location, there's parking - this place hands down a winner.

Honestly--it was a joke. I couldn't wait to get out of there. The waitresses were swearing and applying lipgloss in front of me at the bar. Not to mention the food was a huge disappointment. As far as money spent in relation to quality of food served--this is the most I have ever dished out for such an uninspired and mediocre meal. After they brought out the wagyu beef roll with wiki that tasted like cheap watery mayonnaise, I decided to cut my losses and get the check mid-meal. Then when the check came, they'd inadvertently charged me for things I didn't even order. Do yourself a favor and go to Uchi or Uchiko instead.

The curiosity of this interesting albeit strange flavor was part of why we ordered it. The dessert was good and the ice cream was surprising, but still a little weird which prevented us from finishing it.

Maybe for about 2-3 hours. \\nThis just seemed weird to us and not fitting of the restaurant.

The food here is sub-mediocre, but the service is the worst. When I walked in with a party of 5, the restaurant was maybe half full at best. We waited 30 minutes just to be seated and then waited another 10 just to order. For a party of 5, we were given 1 small bowl of rice and charged $3 just for another small bowl of rice. The food came out in a timely manner, but the taste was far worse than what we paid for. For $12 per bland dish and flies wandering around the table, this is easily a place I will NEVER visit again. I also strongly discourage anyone from coming to this restaurant unless you wish to waste both your money and time.After eating a meal that should have been fed to my dogs, my party was charged a 15% gratuity without consent. The bill that was brought to our table included the generous tip without taking into account the service and quality of food this establishment provided us.

Pretty much exactly what you'd expect a boozy horchata to taste like - creamy and delicious with a bit of cinnamon spice. I'd get that again for sure. The chicken was good, but not Earth-shatteringly good. It wasn't really seasoned well and the skin was just sort of crispy. It was tender and juicy though. The rice however, was terrible. It was super dry and seemed undercooked or just really dried out with absolutely no flavor. Without any sauce to put on it, it did nothing for the dish and I barely ate any of it. The skewers were okay but the meat was a little dry. I don't think I'd go here again, unfortunately.

On this event they were giving us tastings of red or white wine or craft beers.  They also serve craft beers, freshly made juices and other refreshing beverages including their minty lemonade.  On my next visit I mixed it up and got the bowl with chicken, carrots, beets, red onion, cauliflower, and kale with the tahini.  My other half got a pita with brisket, kale, carrots, cucumber, beets and their homemade hot sauce.  We split an order of their delicious French fries.

For breakfast taco's they feature five varieties of street tacos, and, they have four different grab and go varieties.  I was in a hurry, so I grabbed a chicken chorizo(notice there's no comma between chicken and chorizo!),egg and cheese, and, a sausage, egg, and cheese.  Both for $2.29 each.  The chicken chorizo is out of this world amazing!!!  I enjoyed that taco so much I phoned the manager and told her about it.  As for the SEX, it could have used a bit more filling.  More shell than filling is not always a good thing.  Check my pic on the SEX, you decide.  Also, I think both taco's could've used a bit more cheese.  They use white cheese, and, it works, just need a little more of it.  These guys offer some tasty looking tacos, wraps, salads, chicken tortilla soup, and, sides.  They also have a kids menu.  You can get the whole bird for $14, or half for $8.  The chicken is rotisserie, and, it's what they use in the chicken chorizo.

A white guy opens a Thai restaurant that has more dishes and flavors on the menu than the typical pad thai take out Thai joint, and the white hipsters that make up 80% of Portland's population go absolutely nuts. They taste fish sauce for the first or second time in their lives and think it's a revelation. Somehow chicken wings marinated in fish sauce and salt become a famous dish.The cocktails here are pretty good, I guess.I think it's pretty telling that Andy Ricker tried to expand Pok Pok to NYC and LA, and couldn't make it in either city. Pok Pok NYC closed after 6 years in business. Pok Pok LA closed after less than 1.5 years in business, which is totally unsurprising to any Angeleno.

I visited while in town for work on a Tuesday evening. No reservation and I planned to dine at the bar. Upon arrival, the bar was full with after work crowd. I like how it appears they don't cram in seats at the bar allowing each pair of two to have space and room to enjoy their time at the bar. I grabbed a seat at high top table in the bar area. I was really hoping for a seat at the bar and that one would open soon. Service at first was odd. I almost felt the bartenders where like \\"how do we take care of this one person by themselves\\" type thing. I dine out alone often when traveling so I am used to sitting solo. After the servers got me set up at the table,  service flowed more like one would expect at $$$$ steakhouse. And finally, when a seat opened, I moved to the bar for the remainder of my meal.  I ordered a filet and twice baked potato. The filet was their 6 oz and it was fantastic. Probably one of the best I have eaten. The potato was ok, not great but not horrible. With my meal, I wanted a glass of red wine. I couldn't decide between two so the bartender actually poured me half glasses of both. Fantastic. Funny thing, another guest had ordered drinks for him and some friends. He was obviously struggling to carry them to wherever he was going, so I offered to help. I wasn't gone more than a minute, when I came back another bartender had cleared my seat, pouring out my wine. She was super apologetic but obviously more concerned about pre-closing then noticing my phone sitting next to the wine. I appreciated her offering to pour more wine, but frankly what I had was from fresh bottles and had opened up. What she poured wasn't as fresh or at \\"that\\" stage. I was also sips away from being done. \\nTo sum this up, food was overall great. The steak was the highlight, and it should be.

Overall the evening was up and down. The service is really under par for this style of restaurant and wait staff had a super strange setup. There were 4 ladies refilling waters and removing plates and one waiter for the ENTIRE restaurant. I attempted to ask one of the ladies about the fish of the day because the waiter was swamped. No clue the type of fish or how it was prepared which was fine but surprising on such a busy holiday. As the ladies refilled waters they refused to do so without our party handing the glass over to them which kept interrupting our conversation. The tables aren't big so we chalked it up to inexperience? Our waiter finally came over and we ordered the lobster and escargot for appetizers. I took the opportunity to ask about the fish of the day. Thankfully he knew it was corvina but when I asked how it was prepared he said it was done so in their own special way. I asked for clarification, was it fried, baked, saut√©ed? He had no clue....Obviously I couldn't try that dish, it was too mysterious. Our appetizers came out promptly, the lobster was good and very fresh. The escargot was mediocre with barely any garlic but cooked to the right texture. For our entrees two of us ordered the filet and two the NY strip. All of the meats came out perfectly cooked and we found the sauces they came with to be unique and tasty. The potato au gratin side three of us ordered were undercooked and inedible which was a disappointment since it looked good. At the end of our dinner we again had to hand each plate to the staff one by one...ugh. It took over 30 minutes to get our check after they cleared our table which was frustrating. Overall we felt the food was good enough to return and try other dishes. I just hope they adjust the way they service the customers in the future."},{"name":"Mango Mango Dessert Atlanta","address":"5177-A Buford Hwy NE","city":"Doraville","stars":"4","text":"Mango Mango Dessert provides the highest quality of mango desserts.

And saying I didn't want anything sweet, I thought it could be challenge.But no! A splish of this, a splash of that and voila! He poured this lovely orange-pink-ish cocktail in front of me called a \\"paper plane\\" -- bourbon with citrus bitters. He pulled out a fresh lemon and added a nice, thick slice of zest into the drink -- but not before swirling it around the entire rim of the glass, which gave an extra citrus-y kick on my lips as I sipped.*Likely the most amazing cocktail I've ever had.* And I don't know if I even need to go into how good the food is. I'm in love with the fact that they print their menus daily and offer different seafood/fish entrees based on what's fresh and local.I would recommend everything we ordered:1.) Raw oysters -- my first time having these and I was a big fan. Great flavor and super fresh, nice selection.\\n2.) Cocktail shrimp -- HUGE and unbelievably fresh, crisp and tasty.\\n3.) Buttermilk biscuit -- holy mother of Aunt Jemima and Betty Crocker. You must order this. No questions or carb counting allowed.\\n4.) Halibut -- amazing, amazing sear, beautiful beautiful white fish. Perfect flavor in a light sauce with porcini mushrooms and peas. Delightful summer dish.\\n5.) Salmon -- The succulent flavor in this thick cut of salmon was unlike any other I've ever tasted. Cooked medium rare and perfect, had an amazing aroma and just melted in your mouth. Served atop lentils and roe, a great match.On top of all of that, our server was friendly, attentive and never once left our water glasses empty (he knew it was hot out and we were drinking water like crazy).The best part of the hospitality? We were sitting there for nearly 3 hours, eating, drinking and enjoying ourselves when the restaurant really started to pack it in. Tables were full, there wasn't an empty seat at the bar and people were clamoring to get on a wait list for bar seats ((the vultures started to come out, circling the bar and asking people who have their bills in hand if they're going to leave)) -- but not once did we feel rushed or were asked to give up our seats for people who were waiting. We left once we were finished and the bartender put a \\"reserved\\" sign in front of our seats almost immediately, before a vulture couple could sit down. I knew they were crunched for space and needed to turn more tables over to accommodate others, but I was glad they didn't do it at the risk of making us feel rushed.So thank you, Island Creek, for giving my first visit to Boston a memorable culinary experience.

The waiter asked the hostess in the front and she said no sorry that table is reserved. Our waiter was awesome, he went over the menu and recommended things for us. We ordered drinks and  food- steaks of course- and sat rather uncomfortably- there was barely any room for anyone to put there elbows on the table, and that's when we saw a couple - 2 ppl- get seated in the booth that could easily fit 4. My boyfriend was agitated and went to the manager and asked him if when someone makes a reservation, do they get a choice of tables, he replied no, so he asked why we could not have switched tables since the hostess can see that us a group of 4 shouldn't be crammed into the tiny table when we could have easily just been seated at the booth. The manager didn't really give an answer and we kind of were back where we started. Our bill was over 500$ so we definitely didn't get the service that we paid for.

Main course for my wife was the chicken thighs with whipped potatoes and baby carrots, which she loved.  I opted for the short ribs, with root vegetables and gnocchi.  Talk about delicious.  I have made and tasted gnocchi in the USA and Italy and nothing compares to these.  Perfect texture and firmness while being light as can be.

So I ordered a Thai grilled chicken, even if this dish was way overpriced, still it was tasteless, but not only that, it was not even fresh, I could tell that it had been roasted first then frozen and then warmed up, it was cold and not fresh and tasted awfully. I then ordered some other appetizer, hoping they could be tasty, same thing, tasteless, old, and cold and minuscule portions.But even if the dishes here are tasteless and cold and most of them are previously frozen, they are overpriced, and the chefs are not even Thai, they are American, I do not understand why everybody thinks the food here is great, I am still shocked about the lack of taste of their dishes."},{"name":"Tso Chinese Delivery","address":"3909 N Interstate 35, Ste E-5","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"I do regularly order my lunch from this place and I can't stop ordering it.

It dwarfs its competitors in sheer size & scale and pleased to see so many Asians packing this place out.The buffet, or buffets, I should say... are broken out into 6 different areas, all with massive amounts of food.* Far corner leads off with traditional Japanese seafood, meat, and vegetable dishes\\n* Next plentiful oysters on the halfshell and crab legs. Enough value alone to justify the price of dinner. Also have many ceviches and cold vegetarian dishes in this row (eggplant was phenomenal)\\n* Middle is at least 4 types of sashimis and all the good salads (seaweed and others) This buffet also has your dressings (ginger, wasabi, sweet/sour, etc.)\\n* The fourth is all the custom sushi rolls and nigiri. Fantastic creations that rival many of your mainstays like Ra and better sushi houses. Runs the gambit with respect to seafood and plenty of high end roe sushi as well\\n* The fifth station is a hot bar with chicken and beef skewers, soups\\n* The sixth station is the dessert bar with fresh fruit, yogurt, small cookies, and a soft serve machine with vanilla or green tee ice cream. Also a crepe station too!Have to say I was impressed. Even at $30 for dinner, well worth the money for the quality and variety of the food. Green tea ice cream was very well done and had the right leafy flavor of a Gyokuro Imperial.

Oh that's only for phone orders, no matter how many people are in line. So I decided I'd come back later.At 4pm, the place was sparse. Finally, I'd get some tacos and a margarita, right? Well, after waiting at the front desk for about 5 minutes--where not a SOUL was working and I listened to the phone ring non-stop without a single worker answering it--I had a CUSTOMER tell me I could order at the bar. Thanks, customer!  So I go to the bar. The bartender is making a drink and without even looking at me, says \\"I'll be with you in a minute.\\" Then she goes and serves everyone else--I get it, I'm not your only customer--but it seems to take an awfully long time to get to everyone else.

What if a white person posted such an idiotic review, stating something like, \\"This would have been a nice place, if only blacks hadn't moved in the neighborhood and started hanging out there, thus disturbing the long-established European culture.\\" Which is exactly what you were saying, in reverse. Your own racism is sickening.\\n...I almost felt a bit disrespected having a white guy tell me, a Black woman, about the culture of East Austin. Maybe he was referring to its current and longstanding status of being heavily gentrified.I prefer diversity in all spaces. Including my coffee shops. It's sad to see East Austin lose its deep Black history to overly monotone and singular coffee shops that caters to the increasing white population.I said all of this to say that I would recommend this place for people who can go about their lives without noticing that there is only one Black person in the room or that everyone else is white like them.

I'm always so happy and excited to patron vegan places and give them my business over others.It was a toss up between a few things on the menu, but I opted for the Southern Baked Seitan with the jalape√±o cornbread and potato salad sides along with a lavender lemonade.The seitan and gravy were so dang good. Almost thought I was in back woods Georgia for a second when the savory goodness met my tastebuds. It reminds me of a similar roast my grandma made long ago before I took the vegan path. The cornbread was dry like a southern cornbread should be, and paired perfectly with the gravy. The potato salad was a little less exciting, but still pretty good and not mushy. The lavender lemonade was not my favorite, it was pretty bitter and had too much of a lavender flavor instead of just a hint.As for the staff, everyone is super sweet and very accommodating. Lisa, a newer server, was incredibly charming and helpful. Overall I'd definitely say check it out.

The less amount of people in your group, the quicker you can be seated since I saw a party of four and more that had to wait. Our table was small and we were very close to the table next to us. We ordered Ike's famous fish sauce wings (Aahaan Phiseht) and (Nuea Naam Tok) spicy beef steak salad with a side of sticky rice. I can see why the most popular dish is the fish sauce wings. It has a lot of flavor and the chicken is moist as well. Beware though because it was salty. The spicy beef steak was solid but it's portion is small and not worth its price. I can order atleast two dishes at a Thai restaurant in California for its price. The sticky rice comes in a sandwich bag that is half filled only (the price for this is not worth for this).

I felt like I was at a club and they were trying to get a line out the door, even though it wasn't busy inside, for show so that people would look and wonder what the hype was about. Lol.. or.. they didn't have enough waiters/servers yet and they were trying to stagger the guests so that the kitchen isn't backed up. I'd probably guess the latter option. We sat down fairly quickly after we arrived. Our server was friendly and made some amazing suggestions. They give you some popcorn during your wait so you have something to occupy yourself with. We ordered the special - fried green tomatoes and shrimp. Yum yum yum! This started the meal off right! The fried green tomatoes were battered well and crispy, oh so crispy! The shrimp had a smokey taste to it and the sauce was phenomenal. The bf was scraping the sauce off the dish and eating it alone! That's how good it was - we scraped the plate clean! We also ordered the chicken and waffles and the 5oz steak and eggs special for the day. The chicken and waffles was delicious, especially the waffles. The waffles were made out of corn meal and tasted like sweet corn bread molded into a waffle! It was delicious and gritty! I loved it. The chicken was ok - a lot more batter than chicken, though they do use small pieces of chicken breast. It was crispy, albeit a bit too greasy, and the chicken was juicy inside. It came with a white gravy that was pretty good as well. The chicken and waffles together in the same bite went really well together! The steak and eggs was the most disappointing dish of the day - a 5oz sirloin over cooked and dry. I tasted smoke and the meat wasn't of high quality. Pass! The grits that came with the dish were really good though and you get two eggs your way with a green Chile sauce. I'd skip this dish and get a burger or something cause the burgers looked fantastic! The rosemary fries were just what you would expect, nothing special as well. They couldn't make lattes even though they had a cappuccino machine and there were multiple parties requesting it. They ended up pouring milk in a house made cold brew and it wasn't very good.Overall, I liked the atmosphere. The brick walls made it feel like a southern farm house. The food was mostly good, minus the steak and eggs. I don't know if it'd be worth a long wait but without one, I'd come back in a heartbeat.

We decided to opt out of dining in and order food to go (which would take 60 minutes instead) so I can't comment for the aesthetics and vibe of the restaurant. Got home and as soon as I bit into it, I knew I made a big mistake by not ordering rice. It's a tad bit too salty for my liking. The flavor was good but the saltiness was over powering. Thank goodness there were pickled vegetables that helped.  The size of the order was pretty generous too. My bf and I thought we could finish an order each but were too stuffed midway.Overall, the popular dish did not live up to the hype.

We came mainly for their famed Ike's Vietnamese Fish Sauce Wings, which weren't crispy enough and overly salty with tough skin that was difficult to chew. I ordered them spicy and could barely taste a hint of spice. Anyone who grew up eating this dish like we did would agree that it is way overhyped here and definitely not worth the $15 for 6 wings. The one redeeming dish for me (and the reason why this place gets 3 stars instead of 2) is the Kai Yaang - their tender roasted game hen stuffed w lemongrass, garlic pepper and cilantro that comes with sweet chili and tamarind dipping sauces. You have to get this with a side of their coconut rice - so fragrant, fluffy and just the right amount of sticky. We also tried their Oregon berry som, which comes in a variety of other seasonal flavors and is essentially a vinegary soda - really strong vinegar flavor and not my cup of tea, but worth trying. Our waitress recommended it as a refresher that pairs well with the fried wings, but it just made me even thirstier by bringing out their saltiness and I found myself almost chugging Thai tea in between bites. Overall I'd say this place is underwhelming and overpriced but if you end up going, get the game hen and steer clear of the fish sauce wings.

The chicken is higher quality than what you normally receive at a fast food joint and the biscuits are light and fluffy and really absorb the hot pepper jelly perfectly.

The sea salt crystals were prominent and there is nothing better than a delectable sweet and salty cookie situation.

Atmosphere - It gets pretty crowded during dinner and it was Friday so I just went with valet. Lunch valet is $6 and Dinner valet is $9. It's probs just easier to valet since parking is really hard to find on the weekends. Service - They won't seat you unless everyone in your party is there so make sure no one is running late or you'll be pushed back on the wait list! Our server wasn't the friendliest and I wish we had someone else. He just didn't seem happy to serve us. I got called out for canceling my drink right after he wrote it down on his note pad...it didn't even make it to the bartender so wasn't sure why he was so cranky. There's like 8 other people at my table that also ordered drinks. It was also my friends birthday and when he brought out the cake, he forgot to put the candles in. And when he brought it out, he rolled his eyes and asked me who it was for and where he should put it. Food - I got the tender belly burger with a side of macaroni cheese. The mac & cheese wasn't hot at all and tasted like it's been sitting out for an hour. The tender belly had 3 diff styles of pork. A little over the top with the amount of pork.... even my guy friend who also got the same thing wasn't a fan of the tender belly. Will I Return? - No. It was my first time at moonshine and I most definitely won't be coming back unless its for a friends bday event.

Wait for a party of four would have been 3 hours so we decided to get togo. The ike's vietnamese fish sauce wings are probably the thing they are best known for. It's similar to like korean fried chicken, but with a heavy dose of fish sauce that makes it even more salty. I personally like salty, but mots of my friends felt like it was too salty. The papaya pok pok is very spicy, so much so that my gf who loves spicy also had trouble eating it. The baby back ribs that we ordered never came. Instead we got some noodle dish that had some pork and shrimp instead. We were craving more meat and received more carbs. This was a HUGE disappointment. There isn't any seating nearby for togo. Your best bet is to eat near the benches at Salt & Straw. I feel like this place is overrated, but if you enjoy chicken wings then just the wings are worth a try."},{"name":"Pok Pok","address":"3226 SE Division St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Pok Pok is one of those quintessential must-visit restaurants in Portland that entail a long wait time, and I do mean lonnngggg. When we got there we were told that the wait would be 1 1/2-2 hours but since we were determined to try Pok Pok we decided to deal with the wait time. Pro tip: go wait at Whiskey Soda Lounge only a few blocks away. It is owned by the same management company as Pok Pok so they will coordinate with the restaurant and hold your table for you while you finish your drinks and head back over.We of course ordered the Vietnamese Fish Sauce Wings (spicy). I guess I'm one of those weird people that are indifferent to chicken wings so I didn't expect to be blown away but these were amazing and completely different from any traditional wings. Super flavorful with the right amount of heat. The wings have this amazing sweet and salty flavor and are fried to perfection. Warning: SUPER messy. It's inevitable, we had to make a few trips to the bathroom to wash our hands throughout our meal. Also ordered Da Chom's Laap Meuang and the Kai Yaang to share. Kai Yaang was my favorite dish out of the three. It's a charcoal roasted whole chicken that is stuffed with various spices and herbs and served with dipping sauces. It's pretty simple but the execution was unique and delicious. The chicken was unbelievable tender and flavorful and the dipping sauces took the chicken to the next level. Laap Meuang is a spicy minced pork \\"salad.\\" It's described as a salad in quotes on the menu but is definitely anything but. It's more of a minced pork mixture with various herbs and spices and is served with a mixture of greens to eat alongside the pork. Greens are pretty necessary because the pork is very flavorful but heavy and extremely salty. It definitely requires a lot of rice and greens to balance out the extreme saltiness.Liked the overall ambiance of the place and the tent-like construction of the restaurant. Our waiter was very nice and helpful at answering our questions.

She's O.G. from the land of the pepper so she expect this to be teary-fiery-hot and was left underwhelm with the spice level. The chicken looking a bit dry qq. She said it was flavorful but she was not happy with the dish. She also ordered a bunch of to-go dishes and commented on the tiny-whiny portion that is the Ca Kho To. Ouch! Maybe they made it in a tiny-whiny clay pot.. that would have look cute, but for the price...not so much.I shall comment though that they are very much willing to make my meal a pure vegetarian/vegan dish if I wanted: as in minus the fish sauce and the egg if wanted. I ordered tofu for yolo, and they were kind enough to ask if I was vegetarian! Very nice to have a place that care about your dietary need.  I'm giving it a 3, but I still have hope for the place.

The goat cheese with the chicken is a delicious combining, and the pepper jelly that goes with it is perfect with the biscuit and chicken. I ordered the BAM!Yo-yo which is their version of chicken and waffles. The chicken is tender and seasoned pretty well. The waffle has cheese in the batter along with bacon, and they top it with honey butter with syrup. The waffle was damn near melt in your mouth and the honey butter made each bite even better! I tried their coffee and the maple tap flavor was pretty good, especially with their maple simple syrup. I may purchase some of their coffee the next time I visit.

If you're looking for something that can be shared between two individuals then I would definitely go with the country lamb.  It is succulently juicy and fall off the bone tender.  It comes with veggies, rice and the regular lemon potatoes that many greek restaurants offer.  When it comes to appetizers I tend to lean towards taramasalata when I go to Greek establishments and they make sure that this caviar spread pops in your mouth and pairs perfectly with the fluffy soft pita.  The moussaka is a heavy and very filling option which includes delicious decadent layers of all the good stuff that's typical like eggplant and beef but Anatoli puts a bit of a twist to the dish by adding pork and zucchini as well.  They also have a vegan version of this which fills you up with a potato aspect instead of meat; it may not be equally delicious for us meat eaters but for a vegan it definitely is.

For only 76 dollars, we had Uchi/Nobu grade sushi. We were so pleased and our server told us the training that all 3 chefs had and continued to educate us in a way where we were engaged and not bored. They ended up comp'ing our dessert which was a lovely touch on top of an already 5 star meal. I can't recommend this place enough. In Austin, I am guilty of spending high dollar just because some place had good lighting and a trendy backsplash. Soto is not that place....but is the place where you will have a meal that is well worth 400 dollars for under 170 dollars.

I heard they were fantastic, and as a biscuits and gravy connoisseur myself, of course I wanted to try them! Biscuits and Gravy: you receive two large biscuits smothered in the sausage and rosemary gravy with a side of their home fries. The texture of the biscuits was perfect, and they actually had a great flavor on their own. The gravy was heavenly and incredibly flavorful. The home fries were perfectly cooked. And to top it off, they had Secret Aardvark hot sauce, which is a necessity. As we were leaving, we picked up a huge slab of their coffee cake, which was well worth it!!

However, then the mains came out.I had the Lechon Asado (pulled pork) and my husband the Arroz con Pescado y Vegetales (rice, fish, veggies). In their favor, the portions are yuuuuuge! I don't think it's possible to walk out of here hungry and my husband's dish could have easily fed an entire family. When my plate arrived, I took one look and was a bit worried. Around the pork, grease was pooling and the entire plate was gleaming with an oily sheen. Once I started eating, the pork did taste good, but every bite was heavy with fat. My husband had the same issue. Fish, veggies and rice seems like it should be a light dish, but the entire bowl of rice had the same, greasy shine and the food suffered.

At previous Atlanta meetings, we've eaten at Bones (where George H.W. and Barbara Bush sat at the table next to us), Chops, Ruth's Chris and Capital Grille. This time, we tried Kevin Rathbun Steak. Only one of us had been here before.I'd have to say it wasn't what I expected in a premium steak house. For one thing, in the main dining room the noise level was so darn high it was almost impossible to talk. Tables are jammed together. Most of the patrons looked like they had headed out to Applebee's but had made a wrong turn into this $125-a-head eatery. Kevin Rathbun's is the very opposite from the clubby atmosphere of, say Morton's or The Palm, or even the wonderful old-time Manhattan steak house atmosphere of Sparks or the old Brooklyn feel of Peter Luger.I guess I'm just not Atlanta enough to appreciate the Kevin Rathbun atmosphere. It's obviously wildly popular with real Atlantans.As to the food, sure, it was fine. A couple of us had what our waiter said was a special ribeye offered that night, \\"the best, most marbled cut of the ribeye.\\" It went for $6 an ounce, and both of us had the 10-ounce cut. That was a mistake, as it was much too thin, medium rare.  I should have had the 16 oz. strip rare and charred for about the same price. One of us had the regular ribeye, also 10 oz. for $30-something, and at least it was thicker. Another member, trying to eat healthy at a steak house (probably not possible), had the caesar salad and the salmon. My vodka Gibsons were great, cold, dry and large, and they helped. Another in our party had a gin martini and noted that it wasn't cold enough, which is the greatest sin a bartender can make with a martini. My escargot appetizer was \\"baked\\" with the snails not in shells but in a buttery, herby sauce without much garlic. The sides, especially the mashed potatoes and creamed spinach (all the sides are $9.50 each) were excellent.Nothing to complain about in terms of service or our waiter.However, at our next Atlanta get-together, for our steak dinner I suspect we'll head back to Bones."}]`),E={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:O},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:6,poemsData:z,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.poemsData.filter(i=>{const e=this.searchQuery.toLowerCase();return i.name.toLowerCase().includes(e)||i.city.toLowerCase().includes(e)||i.text.toLowerCase().includes(e)}).slice(0,this.visibleCount):this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(i=>setTimeout(i,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},R={class:"search-container"},j={class:"card-container"},N=["disabled"],D={key:0},F={key:1};function L(i,e,s,f,n,r){const u=p("PoemCard");return a(),o("section",null,[e[3]||(e[3]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"üéâ Restaurant Reviews ü•≥")])],-1)),t("div",R,[e[2]||(e[2]=t("span",{class:"search-icon"},"üîç",-1)),b(t("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=h=>n.searchQuery=h),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[v,n.searchQuery]])]),t("div",j,[(a(!0),o(y,null,m(r.filteredPoems,(h,g)=>(a(),k(u,{key:g,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),r.hasMorePoems?(a(),o("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:n.isLoading,onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=(...h)=>r.loadMore&&r.loadMore(...h))},[n.isLoading?(a(),o("span",F,"Loading...")):(a(),o("span",D,"See more"))],8,N)):w("",!0)])}const H=c(E,[["render",L],["__scopeId","data-v-7f1ae6dd"]]),Y=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"glossary/32.md","filePath":"glossary/32.md"}'),G={name:"glossary/32.md"},K=Object.assign(G,{setup(i){return(e,s)=>(a(),o("div",null,[I(H)]))}});export{Y as __pageData,K as default};
