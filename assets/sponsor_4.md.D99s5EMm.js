So, after a long day venturing around Austin and partying at Lake Travis, we made it here an hour before they close on a Sunday evening. Its been possibly five years since my girlfriend last ate here, so trying to locate the restaurant itself was a little more difficult then usual even though our gps led us to the location. The restaurant does not have a sign on the outside so I drove past it twice until we decided to pull into the parking lot and checked out a building with the sign that says \\"China Town,\\" I believe.

The sauce that comes on the side ofthe roll is what she digs. We ordered 2 right off the back as well as a Spider Roll. For myself, I just made my life easier by ordering the Sushi/Sashimi combo. It was comprised of 7 pcs of sushi, assorted pcs of sashimi, and about 3 pcs of a sushi roll. All was very good and delightful.

Expect solid, good food; friendly competent service; pre-assembled but reasonable salads, salad dressing in a plastic cup on the side, only one fork and knife for butter, salad, and steak (this isn't one of those pretentious places that replaces your cutlery between courses, or sweeps the table completely free of all crumbs before dessert), etc.\\n- Dinner follows a loaf of fair white bread with cold, but real, butter pats in foil.\\n- Yummy Clam Chowder was creamy with plenty of clam.  (Warm the butter on the soup saucer, next to the warm bowl)\\n- Blue-cheese dressing worth the extra 35 cents.\\n- Prime Rib = Heaven.  The au jus makes it even better.  Medium Rare = tender delicious pinkness\\n- Loaded baked potato was good, as were the mashed potatoes.  Next time, will consider asking for loaded mashed potatoes!\\n- Ask what the Vegetables are, bc hubby got the Butternut Squash, and it was quite tasty.  Buttered, brown sugar, mashed loveliness.\\n- Chicken Supreme was lovely tender fried breast, with creamy gravy that paired well with mashed potatoes.  Came with a surprise cranberry sauce on the side.\\n- Marinated Steak Tips seemed a teensy bit stringy to me, but the hubby loved the marinade and preferred them to the prime rib (blasphemous & inflammatory!)\\n- Parking available directly behind the restaurant and also behind Verna's.\\n- Even if it doesn't look like it, the food is more filling than we expected - in a good way.

I've had several things off the menu and really nothing stands out. \\n\\nWhen you walk into Rusan's at Buckhead Tower you'll be greeted by an over-enthusiastic host as well as sushi chefs (who surprisingly look asian) who say, sorry i meant scream, something in Japanese. The first time i went i was like \\"oh wow thats neat...\\" as you go more often then you'll realize its more like \\"oh wow thats kinda annoying...\\" especially if you bring a date or want something of a quieter evening on the town with the misses (or mister if thats your thing). The decor is nothing special but its well organized and pretty clean. Nothing overly japanese about the whole establishment but everything is tastefully done. The service is quick and adequate and for me they got everything right. Now onto the food. The prices are right on par with your avg sushi restaurant with rolls teetering around $5-$12 depending on content and entrees around $8-$15 again depending on what you order. I had the \\"Protein Bomb\\" which included several cuts of sashimi, some rolls, and some sushi, and a salad this set me back around $17. Not bad. The quality was on par but nothing spectacular. The one thing that does save Rusan's is the fact they have a \\"value menu\\" of sorts. There's a few pages in the menu where they offer some choices for under $5. This could be pieces of sushi, rolls, or skewers of meat of some sort. This really isn't anything special nor is it filling but its an interesting concept that I hadn't seen anywhere except maybe NYC. \\n\\nAll in all if your looking for a mediocre sushi restaurant that might disappoint then you've found your place with Rusan's otherwise venture elsewhere. On the other hand if your buddy has a birthday be sure to go to Rusan's they have this thing where they pretty much embarrass the birthday boy/girl by putting on this whole obnoxious dance and song.

I was working with Maggie Warren - don't know if she still works there. She was incredibly hard to get a hold of on the phone (was never in and did not return calls), so I eventually asked for her email address and started communicating via email. Emailing worked better at first, until she stopped responding to that too. We were pretty much ready to sign the contact, but since we couldn't get a hold her when my mom was in town looking at places, we ended up going with Tavern in the Square since they were much more responsive and easier to work with. She never did follow up, and a day or two before the wedding I got a call from someone else at the restaurant because we apparently still had the date on hold from 11 months earlier."},{"name":"Hale Pele","address":"2733 NE Broadway","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"Hale Pele has a rum map where you sample various rums from around the world.

Good food and creative drinks.  As with other reviews, service is very uneven.  Also, the place is LOUD!  Because of its seating arrangements (long tables sitting many people) it often draws big groups on weekends. The last time we were there, there was a rowdy (and very drunk) large group sitting in the middle of the restaurant and absolutely upping the noise level so that no one else could maintain a conversation.  Two of the people especially were very drunk,  swearing up a storm, dropping F-bombs, etc.   It felt like a frat party!  Several tables (including ours) said something to the wait staff about it but nothing was said to the noise makers.  Given that restaurants make most of their money on drinks, and the group was continuing to order MORE drinks, the staff had no incentive to do anything about it.  We (and other tables) decided to cut short our stay, order our bills, and leave.  I'd recommend Yakuza if you're looking for a girls or boys night out some where you can get wild and crazy.

We decided to find a restaurant within the hotel since there are not many restaurants within the surrounding vicinity. Based on the 3.5 yelp stars, I didn't have high expectations. \\nThis place exceeded expectations! It was like a Ruth Chris experience. Service was above and beyond great. Our server was Krian, honestly one of the best. He was very knowledgeable about the menu items, giving impeccable descriptions of many of the options. Must be a true foodie to be able to make food sound so good I could visualize everything quite well. His recommendations did not disappoint. We ordered the seafood sampler for our start with blue point oysters, gulf shrimp and lobster. The cheese platter was scrumptious. We ordered the Buzz Cheese with hints of coffee and lavender, so unique and delicious. If you love blue cheese...it's one of the best I've had, Smokey with a perfect creamy texture, not to overpowering. The steak I ordered was the center cut. It was one of the smaller steaks,  for me I can't eat more than 6 to 8 oz so a perfect size. It was very tender and done just right, a 2 inch or more thickness. It was a steak lovers dream. The sides we ordered were creamed spinach, asparagus and South Carolina grits. The grits were unlike any other grits I've ever had and in a good way. There is a whole history to these fine grits that Krian was telling us about. The texture was more coarse, like hominy grits. Good of you like grits. Last of all the dessert souffle was a delightful choice. Ordered the chocolate and vanilla, both were so decadent, warm, gooey, creamy, melt in your mouth kind of dessert. \\nAgain, a special thanks to our server, Krian for making the night so enjoyable and a very exceptional steakhouse."},{"name":"Harry Buffalo","address":"6150 South Sunbury Rd","city":"Westerville","stars":"3.5","text":"This is an awesome place to go to watch popular sports events.

She accidentally asked for a 'grande' and the young man at the counter got a complete hipster attitude and said \\"I have no idea what a grande is\\".  I was so taken back by how snooty he was about that, that I decided not to order a drink.  I get why he would say something like that because you don't want to be run of the mill like the biggest chain coffee in the world.  You want to be edgy and different, not associated with the mundane coffee of the masses.  All it did was make him look like a spoiled rotten child.  Being that both my friend and I are from Seattle, at one point the big coffee chain WAS the local joint.  The only reasons I would ever go to the big coffee chain is for convenience and the fact the mediocre coffee drinks they offer are always consistent. So yes, your counter help made his point.  Perhaps he could have said \\"we do our sizes differently\\"  Or, perhaps laugh it off and say 'wrong place'.  He may think he's a coffee snob but he picked the wrong ladies to be a snob to. To top it off...he got my friend's drink wrong...but we decided to just leave.  Perhaps checking the attitude of your coffee snob baristas might be a good idea.

Omg -- why am I just now finding out about this place. \\n\\nMy family of 4 ventured to check out Canton Cook II thanks to Yelp! \\n\\nWe arrived on a Friday night around 7 -- pretty packed but we were seated immediately. We started with the vegetable egg rolls. Omg - hands down the biggest, tastiest egg rolls I've ever had in my life. No seriously. I took a bite and wanted to slap somebody. \\n\\nFor dinner, we ordered the bean curd with vegetables ($10.95), saut√©ed snow pea leaves ($13.95), general tso Tofu (not on menu, but they happily prepared it -- also don't remember the price), and a side of plain fried rice ($3.95).  Everything was delicious! I would give the general tso Tofu the edge over the bean curd with vegetables; however, I would still order both again.  One small thing I frowned about was charging $3 for hot tea -- but whatever, it was delicious and hit the spot.  Our total was $50 and we have leftovers for tomorrow. \\n\\nService was excellent.  Water was always refilled without our glasses ever being empty. \\n\\nI had to take my son to the restroom and appreciated that they were well kept with hot water at the sink. \\n\\nSo yeah guys -- check this place out. Even if you don't live nearby, come visit. You won't be disappointed.

The same friendly server who used to take care of us way back when took our order. I swear our full order was on our table in not more than 10 minutes. And it was as good as I remember.  Three of us shared 35 wings (hot garlic & mild garlic) which comes with celery and their famous blue cheese dressing.  We also ordered a basket of curly fries which we like to drench in the white vinegar that sits on every table next to the Ketchup. When we asked for another basket of fries they were on our table and piping hot in about the time it took her to walk to the kitchen and back.  Warning!  This is not health food! So don't order mild garlic wings if you are going to be upset about the garlic butter sauce dripping off of them. The wings are not huge or grilled. But they are what Buffalo Wings are supposed to be; delicious!  And don't expect a 5 Star atmosphere. Looks like they've put on a fresh coat of paint since I was there last. But the carpet is the same. Some might prefer tile but the carpet cuts down on the noise which is needed since they stay pretty busy and serve a lot of families with kids.

I scouted the reviews here beforehand to see what the consensus was about it, and I'd say that the reviews here are a little overenthusiastic but only just a little.  What impressed me the most was the emphasis on South Indian cuisine and what seemed like an enormous menu compared to the usual Indian standard fare.  There were two solid pages of dishes neither my wife or I had ever even heard of, and the typical list of kormas and vindaloos and such almost seemed like an afterthought, something tacked on to keep the unimaginative diners coming in.\\n\\nDeciding to be explorative, we ordered the mixed veggie appetizer sampler, the vegetable chettinad, and the kozhli varuvad (a chicken saute).  The appetizers were a mixed bag; some bland spring rolls, typical samosas, fried paneer with tikka sauce and peppers, and little potato cakes called aloo tikki.  The paneer and the potato cakes were great, but the other items were a little greasy and plain.  The entrees were totally new to us, and the veggie chettinad was excellent; the chicken was also good but not great.  Definitely not the absolute best Indian food I've ever had, but very good and with so many dishes to choose from it will be worth going back to try more.  One ding: we asked for \\"medium\\" heat, but neither dish had any hotness to it whatsoever.\\n\\nWe were there early, so for a while we were the only customers and had as much attention from the servers as you could possibly want. \\n\\nI will definitely want to try the lunch buffet, since that seems to get the best reviews."},{"name":"K-Bop","address":"2002 Guadalupe St, Ste B","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"We stopped in for a quick lunch.

But let's face it, this place isn't exactly convenient if you live in the city.\\n\\nAfter a swift reminder from miss Tanya F., we headed out last night. In addition to the tamales, she had heard the fish tacos were on point.  I was somewhat surprised (though I shouldn't have been) by the restaurant's appearance. Essentially it looked like every other suburban tex-mex joint I've been to.\\n\\nThe food falls on the better end of the suburban tex-mex spectrum, but I don't think we were wowed by anything. The chips and salsa were completely ordinary. The tamales had smoked brisket, which is a welcome addition compared to typically braised meats, and were quite moist. Most often, in Atlanta, tamale masa is entirely too dry and that was clearly avoided at Los Hermanos. However, the masa was mushy/doughy with absolutely no bite. It more or less fell apart and sublimated into the filling. Definitely not a bad tamale, but a lot of room for improvement. It's also nice that they give you some spinach and lentil soup (don't remember ever getting this in a Mexican restaurant) as part of the tamale plate. For tamales, I still think Bone Garden can't be beat.\\n\\nThe fish tacos were pretty good, but served in flour tortillas (would have preferred a corn option). The fish was slightly over-fried but nice and crispy, just a little dried out.\\n\\nThe portions were huge (even the tacos) - it's starting to seem that the further you head out of town, there's an apparent trade off between quantity and quality. Overall, it's an OK place to stop in if you're in the area, but definitely not destination dining.

There are a lot of positive things about this place that I think previous negative reviews overlooked.     Some people complained about the food, and because I did not order any significant food dishes (I did split a pizza, I don't think that counts, but it was a good pizza!)  I did not rate this place 5 stars, but if later i have a good dining experience I will definitely return and update my review!\\n\\nHere is a list of everything I liked about Winflo:\\n\\nFirst of all, this place is incredibly charming.  A historic home site that is preserved and great attention to detail and decoration- inside and out.  Great wood floors when you enter the establishment.  Feels cozy inside.   Not like some of these new places popping up on S. Lamar that have absolutely no personality or charm whatsoever.\\n\\nThey even went out of their way to keep the large old oak tree out front- it looks fantastic!  It is all lit up for the holidays this time of year, worth checking out.\\n\\nVery convenient easy parking nearby- on the same block there is a free retail parking garage you can use, or you can utilize their valet parking.  It's less than a block folks- get out and walk - you live in Austin!\\n\\nLots of outdoor patio seating area, and some pretty serious-looking outdoor propane heaters to keep you nice and toasty for the winter season.  And that huge tree out front- who would not want to have a glass of wine sitting under that tree?\\n\\nIt's downtown- not quite walking distance to the Congress Ave area, but still much more accessible than if you were at some establishment say out on 360.\\n\\nGood wine selection of wines from ITALY - it's an Italian restaurant if you missed that part.  The good news is there are lots of diverse wine regions in Italy to order from.   Now a bad part of this is don't expect to see any wines from outside Italy, such as your favorite winery from Napa Valley, any Malbecs, etc.\\n\\nGood service at the bar at least.  They let you have a taste of the wine before you order it- I really like that!  I think all places that serve wine should offer this.\\n\\n  I look forward to having a proper meal here in the future and update my review, but for getting a drink after work or just a place to meet up with friends to begin your evening downtown, Winflo is definitely a place to put on your list to visit!"},{"name":"Watershed on Peachtree","address":"1820 Peachtree Rd NW","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3.5","text":"Well, if you had expected to have the same feeling and food as the original Watershed in Decatur, please don't.  \\n\\nFood for the brunch menu was heavy and not very southern 'comfort'-ing.

After finding out that the extra large Bbq salad is only made with tasteless / non- nourishing iceberg lettuce, I opted for a rib platter. The ribs were cold, fries only partially cooked & garlic bread slices were cold & stale. The bonus is that my dogs had a great meal afterwards. My friend said the pork sandwich was ok but passed on the underdone fries. I did enjoy the baked beans but they were only lukewarm as well. We were too disappointed to try dessert.

I have yet to have a bad experience with a waiter or waitress.  They are very attentive and helpful when I cannot decide on which meal to simply destroy.\\n\\nThe menu continues to whoop Olive Garden's ass.  I enjoy the variety of items.  I have yet to be disappointed with a meal.  While you decide they bring you bread and prepare a dip for you.  The dip consists of some herbs and garlic and are covered with olive oil.  Which is pure heaven.  Can someone please wipe the drool from my mouth please?  Thank you!  My sister turned me on to dipping my bread in their lemon butter sauce.  So give it a try if that is your thing!  My parents also love ordering appetizers as well.  I have tried their calamari and fried zucchini.  Looking to wet your whistle? While I am not a wine drinker, I would definitely try their great assortment of wines.  \\n\\nSo what does the WeatherMan recommend food wise?  Well I am glad you asked.  I first got hooked on their lasagne.  Then I experimented with other meals like the chicken bryan, sirloin marsala, chicken marsala, and just recently the spiedino di mare.  LIke I said, I have yet to be disappointed.  Even the side items are good.  Whether it is the mashed potatoes or vegetables.  I enjoy their chicken soup with it as well.  Don't get a salad to often.  \\n      \\nI think you have probably realized the massive man crush I have on Carrabbas.

The shrimp were lightly breaded, everything had just the right amount of lemon and garlic, and the linguine was perfect. \\n\\nMy husband's baked potato was very good, the scallops somewhat tough, and his prime rib looked like a gelatinous mess, but I think all prime rib looks vile. He enjoyed some of it but the rest went home to our very satisfied dog. \\n\\nAll this came to just $62, less than our gift certificate, so we also ordered apple crisp, a brownie sundae, and a hot chocolate with Baileys.

No, they're not closed down.\\n\\nTheir food, service, ambiance is very very authentically Japanese.  If you're homesick or find yourself missing that amazing ramen you tried while touring Japan, give this place a try!  This place isn't trying to be trendy.  It sincerely feels like a small family endeavor!\\n\\nI've tried nearly all their ramen combinations and their donburi.  I recommend them all, but they are definitely known for their noodles and broth!\\n\\nTheir ramen is generously portioned and richly flavored.  I highly recommend you add the ground garlic and sesame seeds that come with all ramen orders.  It adds a lot of depth and it's sad to see the tiny condiment dishes go untouched!\\n\\nI also highly recommend their harumaki!  They're deep-fried crispy little egg-rolls full of melted cheese, bbq pork, and kimchi!

Sometimes though, I'm in the mood for a really great sandwich.  Yes, for some crazy reason I tried a flatwich at a pizza spot but was pleasantly surprised at how good it was.  \\n\\nI went for the Italian flatwich which had the right balance of meats, veggies, and dressing.  On this particular day I threw all self restraint out the window and also ordered fries, which had the right size and crispiness to make them perfect for dipping in ketchup. If you're familiar with the Atlanta institution that used to be Everybody's Pizza (now closed), they also had fantastic sandwiches and this was reminiscent of that.  So, if you need that Everybody's Pizza sandwich fix than I think you'll be pleased with the versions available here.  \\n\\nIf you want to add an appetizer, I also had the brushetta and found it to be delicious as well. The service is always friendly, and I enjoy the modern decor with high ceilings as it separates it from being just another pizza location.  There are also some TV's around to be able to catch sporting events should you want to hang out to enjoy cheering for your favorite team.

Never again.  \\n\\nWe called ahead for a 6pm table and were told \\"we are not taking reservations tonight...blah, blah\\"  We went online and booked a table for 4 + baby on Open Table.  \\n\\nWhen we arrived on time at JM Curley (which is how you enter Bodies, though I recommend that you don't), they appeared to be confused that we were there even though we had a reservation.  They left our complete party standing at the host stand for 15 minutes without comment or apology.  We were completely ignored.  The staff acted as if they didn't want to serve us.  For the record, we were nothing but polite on the phone and in person. \\n\\nThe wait was long enough and uncomfortable enough that I went across the street to see if Stoddard's had room for us with in intention of gathering my family and abandoning our mediocrity-fated dinner plan.  Alas, they had finally sat my dining companions before I returned to lead them across the street.  \\n\\nMy father and I asked for sparkling water.  Without us asking, the server removed my step mother's and father's water glass and gave my father and I new glasses and filled them with sparkling water.  Now my step mother has no water.  We kept the glasses arranged correctly on the table.  There never seemed to be a point in time where we could comfortably correct the issue; so my step mother, a water drinker, muddled through with no water. \\n\\n\\nThe menu is short on selection and long on overpriced slabs of meat.  I say overpriced because my $50 NY Strip was not even as good as what I prepare at home in a hot skillet with sea salt.  I have no issues with a restaurant charging $50 for a steak, but that steak had better wow me.  My steak was cooked to correct temperature, but served cold.  Not luke-warm, not tepid, COLD.  There was a slab of seasoned butter on the steak; not a drop of that butter melted.  The slab of butter was still refrigerator-hard at the end of the meal.  I thought about sending the steak back, but didn't want it to end up in the trash, so I ate it cold. Other items were served unintentionally cold as well.  The 2 Filet Mignon's were ordered medium rare and but were served under extra rare (my father, who I have seen eat raw hamburger declined declined to eat the center of his steak).  \\n\\nThe coup de grace was dessert.  We were asked if we were interested in dessert of which they only had one option, a brownie Sunday.   We asked for 2.  We were excited to try them, as the restaurant had demonstrated that they were very good at serving cold items.  The server returned to inform us that the restaurant had no ice cream.  It was 7:15pm on a Sunday night!  Clearly they had not sold out that night.  Poor planning.  \\n\\nThere were points of light:  the biscuits served with butter were outstanding, the mac and cheese served in a skillet was good (hard to mess this up), my wife's cocktail was interesting, flavorful and well composed and our actual server (not the rest of the staff) was welcoming, personable and handled most of the meal well (except otherwise noted).\\n\\nOverall, this was a disappointing experience and not an inexpensive one.   We were not made to feel welcome (I don't need to be fawned over but simple acknowledgement would be nice). and we were served mediocre fair that was improperly prepared and served cold.  \\n\\nIn short, go for drinks, eat somewhere else."},{"name":"Hale Pele","address":"2733 NE Broadway","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"It absolutely pains me to write this review. I really wanted this to be a spectacular tiki experience... but it wasn't.\\n\\nOk, I understand that I went to an opening night of a re-imagined bar. I've been to a few bar openings in my years. But this was painful. My boyfriend and I were huge fans of Thatch (which included all the tackiness of the place and the reheated but very delicious nature of the pu pus) and we were really looking forward to what Mr. Reynolds was up to the last few months.\\n\\nThrough the windows, you could see that he did some major renovations and he did a very nice job. The decor was just about the same as before, the tables are no longer bolted to the floor, the bar has a nice new top and it was just a comfortable setting. Though one thing was dearly missed, the large Tiki Bar sign that was proudly displayed outside for years... this treasure was from the Jasmine and it is sad that it wasn't there.\\n\\nBut... an easy going attitude and willingness to overlook a few hiccups on opening night was only going to go so far.\\n\\nOpening night, we waited patiently outside in line to go in. They made considerations due to our party being fairly large at 5. The gal tending the door was pleasant. It actually didn't seem like were were outside for very long.\\n\\nWe finally got to go inside and were seated at the far end of the bar, just under the hut.\\n\\nBut once we got to the table, we waited. It was only a little bit before a carafe of water and glasses appeared. About 15 minutes pass before we are visited by our waitress for our first round of drinks. She seemed attentive and began taking our orders. Folks in our party ordered: A Suffering Bastard, a Nui Nui, a Fogcutter, another Suffering Bastard, a Volcano and someone ordered some food. She does swing by at one point afterwards and offers a Mai Tai due to the bar accidentally mixing an extra. That's nice, a few of us share it. Hmmm, so far so good I think...\\n\\nThen we wait. 30 minutes go by.\\n\\nI finally speak up (I rarely do this due to being shy, but at this point we are seeing others get seated and getting their drinks before we do.) Our waitress doesn't apologize for the long wait and instead blames the bar for the mess-up \\"the bar has a backlog of orders that was 30 minutes long.\\" Um ok, but how long do we have to wait? Too late, she's off again. Someone at our table starts looking for Mr. Reynolds, she does make eye contact with him and motions at our empty table, he would then just look away.\\n\\nTwo of our party then decide that they want to leave. So they go up to the bar to cancel their order as they have other plans elsewhere. Once up there they are told that their drinks are being made right that moment. So they return to the table.\\n\\nAnd we wait again... 10 minutes go by.\\n\\nTheir drinks finally make it to the table. Followed shortly by the rest of ours. The Nui Nui that I had was good, though I could taste the powdered cinnamon as it was caked on the top of the drink, which is my only complaint. The Fogcutter that my boyfriend ordered was so sweetened by sherry that it was cut with water halfway through. The Suffering Bastard(s) were quite tasty. The Volcano was also quite tasty, but there was quite a lot of ice at the end.\\n\\nOne thing was missing, the order of food. We again remind our waitress when she walks by with the bill (for the two who were leaving.) She made another excuse about there being a printer error for the order. Ok, fine... at this point it seems like she just flat out refuses to apologize for the delays. \\n\\nThe food finally arrives and the member of our party who was eating mentioned the sausage was good, but that the rice was cold, hard and undercooked.\\n\\nWhen the time came for us to get the check, instead of waiting for her to bring a printout to us, she was presented with a credit card immediately. We knew how long the wait was before we'd see her again (at least 15-20 minutes.) We waited another 15 minutes for the final bill. On her way back to our table, she made a quick step away and the credit card went sliding across the floor. The person closest to it picked it up and she didn't say more than a \\"thanks\\" before presenting it to the owner. \\n\\nFrom what I could gather, our waitress seemed kinda green, she was really slow at gathering orders, getting drinks, and making sure her customers were happy. Just her entire demeanor was condescending when it came to our table though. I didn't feel like she genuinely cared about us as patrons. I didn't appreciate that there was no apologies made at all as a consolation.\\n\\nI kept looking at my boyfriend throughout the evening and he just seemed sad/inconsolable about this whole thing. Someone with us said \\"you can never go home again.\\" and that statement really came true that night. We are going to give Hale Pele another chance, but we are going to wait a few months to allow for any of the opening jitters to work themselves out.

WE got a variety of small plates to start. The farm egg wasn't cooked properly (the whites were still a bit raw). The polenta was very bland. and the mushrooms were soggy. This was especially disappointing because this was the dish I was most excited about eating.  The Scallop, Pear crostini, carpaccio, and pork meatballs was all decent but certainly nothing special. The lobster risotto was pretty bad. The white wine wasn't cooked out. Most of the rice was overcooked, and was bland. It tasted as though someone poured a glass of wine in to a pan of leftover risotto. The lobster was cooked properly but bland.  Then came the pork chop. The Pork was good on its own but they killed it with balsamic vinegar. The dish was very out of balance. The Squash was very acidic, the radicchio was bitter. There was nothing to even it out. The garnishes ruined what should have a nicely grilled pork chop. The beans were quite nice but the highlight of my meal should not have been my side dish and it wasn't that much of a highlight at that. We didn't get dessert because I refused to be disappointed by another dish. The service was good but was bordering very dangerously close to pretentious. Helping with wine selection is one thing but a lesson of how the Italians raise their grapes differently is not necessary. I also know how to eat. Please don't tell me to cut the poached egg and let the yolk mix with the polenta besides how else did you think I was going to eat it.  \\nI talked my wife out of going to another restaurant because your menu looked great.

I'm a pretty conservative eater so I stuck with items I knew. I enjoyed the \\"dumplings\\" and \\"chicken strips\\". The \\"chicken strips\\" aren't exactly like most restaurants and it seemed that they were made with the dark meat rather than white meat and they aren't as \\"meaty\\" as you'd expect. My friends each ordered different pork ramen and they each offered me a taste of theirs and both were delicious! The next time I visit I will order one of the pork ramen for sure!

This establishment is very small and \\"hidden\\" if you don't know where to look. Here is a couple of hints to make your visit more enjoyable: you can make reservations, which sounds odd to do for this sort of place but they fill up quickly once they open their door promptly at 6 pm nightly.

The burgers are as good or better than other popular burger stands (e.g. Flip and Yeah!), but cost about half as much. Its hard to call Ssam burger the definitive burger king (ha) because its a somewhat niche type burger, but given that I can get two burgers and two sides for the same price as one burger+side at Yeah! Burger (which I love, don't get me wrong), it will be hard to go anywhere else from now on.\\n\\nI ordered the Kimcheese, which sounds weird (kimchi, ssam sauce, and cheese?), but as other reviewers have noted, the kimchi isn't as sour as regular kimchi, and when combined with the ssam sauce, the flavor brings a fantastic combination of sweet, spicy, and a touch of that sour kimchi flavor we all love.\\n\\nThe burger patty is definitely in the saltier end of the burger spectrum (mmmm...burger spectrum), which could be a turn off for some, but its no where near the salt-stravoganza that you'd find at Flip. Still, I left the meal with a bit of a salty feel in my mouth. But now I'm just nit picking, because the beef was cooked and seasoned to a near perfect, juicy perfection. Again, as good or better beef than any other burger stands in town.\\n\\nFor sides, I got the lotus chips and glazed sweet potato fries. Holy cow, the sweet potato fries are amazing! If you only get one side, get these. I don't know where they're buying their sweet potatoes, but I've never enjoyed sweet potatoes so much. The glaze is lightly sweet, but not overbearing. I think the sweetness goes really well with the saltier burger. \\n\\nThe lotus chips are also amazing. Thin, light and crispy, with a subtle flavor that is hard to describe, seasoned with salt and pepper. Really, you should get two sides so you can have both these and the sweet potato fries.\\n\\nI can't wait to come back. I'm thinking of ordering another burger right now.

(all good things).  \\n\\nI ordered \\"yesterdays chili\\" (that what is says on the menu) with onions and cheese.  it was good. albeit microwaved, but hey it's yesterdays chili. also tried the clam chowder, which was also good.  \\n\\nEntrees consisted of: steak tips.  which came out cooked as ordered with a baked potato and some assorted veggies. the meat was very very chewy.  almost dangerous, but tasted ok.

Chicken parm,  pasta was cooked correctly but not drained well, so my dish while looking great turned into a soupy mess.  next was 2 pizzas both were fine.  there are better choices for pizza but these \\"bar pizzas\\" were fine.  \\n\\neverything was very reasonably priced. @ 10 for the chicken parm, the pizzas were 7.

The food came out a bit slow for about 5 min and boom, the meat came out every 2-5 min. The plates that you eat in are small but it's so you get a small amount of meat each time they come by so you get to sample everything. And I got full no problem, and I can eat. The also had 2 ladies in full Brazilian dancer outfits of some sort and it was really awesome. I would recommend this to everyone that loves meat, and an overall good experience.

I don't hold that against them, though, since most brew-pubs are zany at 6 pm Friday. \\n\\nTheir burgers come with caramelized onions, which are amazing, their fries are delicious, and their pizzas are surprisingly good. They also are the origin of my most favorite beer, the CBC Pumpkin Ale, though oddly, if you order it in-house, they do not rim your glass with cinnamon and sugar. The Sunsets both carry it, and they both rim your glass.\\n\\nThey had an outdoor fireplace, which I didn't use, but I really liked it because it made the whole area smell like Vermont, or camping.

This Sonic sprung up not that long ago, so it's relatively new. I was really excited to have one so closeby, because I like Sonic every now and then but don't feel like driving very far for fast food. But I have to say that this was my worst trip to Sonic so far.\\n\\nI've always felt that while Sonic is fast food, that it was a little better quality than places like McDonald's and Burger King. Their food just looked and tasted better. And it's a little more expensive, but worth it. Not so tonight.\\n\\nThis Sonic is close, but in kind of a bad spot. It is right on Olentangy River Rd., and it shares it's driveway with Kohl's. If you've ever been there, you know that it's kind of a weird entrance. So we get there and decide to go through the drive though. How Sonic works is that you can't eat inside, sort of like Rally's. But at Sonic you can pull up to a parking space with a menu and speaker for ordering and sit in your car and eat. They'll bring the food right out to your car like was popular in the 50's. I think it's pretty stupid. Why would I want to sit in my car and eat if I didn't have to? I always opt for the drive-in option and just take my food home. But Sonic does also have some tables outside in the front. But obviously that wasn't working for anyone in the middle of winter.\\n\\nThe drive-in line wasn't long, but we couldn't really see the menu until we got up to the speaker because it wasn't very big and they didn't have any along the way so you could decide ahead of time. They have a dollar menu now, which I think is awesome, and I ordered the dollar burger, fries and a junior sundae. Healthy, I know. But I really don't eat fast food very often. I was with my sister and her husband so together we had sort of a big order. The woman taking our order had to repeat it like 3 times. But it sounded like she got everything, so off we went to the window. It was just shy of $20 for all our food.\\n\\nWe pulled up to the window and a guy took our money and gave us our change. Then we had to wait a minute or two for our food. The first thing out was my sundae. It was so tiny! But the guy tells me that the lid just sat on the top and didn't really shut, so I take it and hand it to my sister so I can get the rest of my food. She drops it. But she managed to save most of it and then she figured out how to put the lid on correctly. It did, in fact, snap on. Why the people working at Sonic couldn't figure that out, I'll never know, but that was really annoying. Then we got our bags of food. I had my sister go through the bags and make sure we had everything before we drove away. And they actually didn't screw up our order at all! I was surprised about that. So we drove off, but didn't get very far. Going out that driveway that's shared with Kohl's sucks. That stoplight never ever turns green! There was a huge line of people waiting for the light. We must have been sitting there for 5 minutes and it still didn't turn. Finally, everybody just started turning right. We did too, and the light was still red as we drove away! So it took us a little longer to get home than usual. They really need to do something about the entrance to this place, especially now that it's shared by 2 businesses. It's so frustrating.\\n\\nWe got home and everybody started to eat. I felt bad, because I had been telling them that Sonic was really good and they'd never had it before. But this was not so good! All of our sandwiches looked so sloppy and like they were just thrown together. My burger had the smallest beef patty, and it was overcooked to the point where it was crunchy around the edges. Their dollar burger also came with just pickles, tomato, lettuce and onion. There wasn't much flavor to it. My fries were soggy and flavorless. My sister and her husband liked their food, but weren't too impressed by it. They each got a Bacon Cheeseburger Toaster, that had cheese and onion rings on it, too. My sister gave me her onion ring because she hates them and that was good. Their onion rings taste sweet. I like them, but I can't eat very many of them. My sister also got tater tots and my brother-in-law also got a breakfast burrito and they split popcorn chicken. They liked it, but their burgers looked awful because they were so smashed and sloppy. I felt bad for suggesting Sonic. My sundae was really good. That was the only thing that I really liked, but it was just so tiny. But it was just a small version of a really quality sundae, topped with crushed Reese cups, whipped cream and a cherry. Delicious!\\n\\nI think that I will go back to Sonic because I like their food from time to time, but this location was pretty bad. I'm not sure if we just happened to come on a bad night, but it was quite disappointing and my burger was just bad. Add to it that it was a hassle to get out of that place and back onto the road, and I'm pretty sure that I won't be coming back to this Sonic again."},{"name":"Buckhead Bread Company","address":"3070 Piedmont Rd NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3","text":"So so, the place is a little dirty inside.

I am a bit of a BBQ snob - not because I know what the heck I'm talking about when it comes to \\"proper\\" techniques, etc. (I actually don't), but because I simply love the stuff and have eaten enough of it all over the country (and the local places as well) to have gained some remote sense of what's out there. Separately, my wife is a die-hard fan of Top Chef, and well, she's been plugged into the news about this place for a while, so it was just about time.\\n\\nFirst things first, the biscuits... They were as heavenly as anticipated based on other reviews (and Instagram photos). The honey butter is - for sure - a nice enhancement. As a new offering, you can now separately order strawberry jam to go with it, and I highly recommend it.\\n\\nOn to the \\"basics\\": ribs, brisket, etc... One (or more - I can't remember) review here mentioned how the meat does not taste as smoky as at other places. When I first read this, I wasn't sure how it would play out. After visiting, I can confirm that it's definitely true and can now see what others were talking about. It's not what I'm used to at the other local places I visit, but I really liked it. The meat had enough hints of smoke while allowing the natural flavors to dominate, much more so than at other BBQ places.\\n\\nWe had brisket, ribs and pulled pork, and everything was delicious: the brisket had the right blend of fat and lean meat, the ribs were fairly lean and meaty - yet tender, and the pulled pork just melted in your mouth (it was a bit fattier than I'm used to). Indeed there are three sauces to choose from, but the meat was so tasty, that I didn't even remember to try any of the sauces (though my wife did, and she enjoyed all three). We also tried the fried chicken, and it was tasty and well-executed, though it definitely took a back seat to the other meats.\\n\\nThe tray system, with meat(s), two sides and cucumber salad is very practical (and fits the d√©cor/setup of the restaurant very well). I've never been crazy about cucumber salad, yet I enjoyed every bite of this one. For sides, I had BBQ ranch beans and coleslaw. The beans were very tasty. One little trick I tried, for what it's worth, was to mix-in some of the onions from the cuke salad. This was quite a success (and if you try it and like it, remember whose idea it was).\\n\\nLast, and definitely not least, everyone was very friendly.

Thank god (or Terry Turner) for Copious, which is a wonderful new restaurant in the tradition of the city's best offerings. A couple highlights worth noting. First, the head of house is the sort of old-school ma√Ætre d' that breathes life into any great restaurant: he's laid back and funny, has encyclopedic knowledge of all the wines (and they have a very good wine list) and food on the menu, and he remembers what you like and can guide you to what's new on the menu that's likely to match what you want.  (Why restaurants hire former cheerleaders as their \\"hostesses\\" is beyond me.) Second, they have an actual pastry chef! Probably most people skip dessert these days for the simple reason that dessert--which is the part of the meal that's supposed to leave you grinning from ear to ear--is often fairly boring and not worth either the $ or the calories. At Copious, the desserts are actually awesome, with the blueberry milk cake being one of those that you'll crave for weeks after trying it.  Finally, the rest of the menu has some real knock-outs: we've loved the (almost) Rigsby's-quality mushroom risotto, the unctuous smoked brisket, and an umami-packed butter bean burger that puts another Columbus favorite's veggie burger to shame.

Both were tasty, but the pastor was especially flavorful. Took one star off bc the pollo was just a bit dry and not quite the crunchy treat I expected from a fried chicken taco.

I don't usually write reviews when I have a bad experience because I work in the industry and I get it, however I have never been so disappointed in restaurant service. So the server approached us and warned us that they were extremely busy that day so he suggested we put our order in together, including the app that we wanted, OK no problem. Even though the restaurant was pretty empty there were quite a few large parties so I know that was the reason why the kitchen was supposedly backed up. We waited about ten minutes before we even got our drinks and during that time another server saw us and asked if we would like some bread while we waited. That was great, she was attentive and noticed we were waiting. When our drinks finally arrived, our food followed shortly after, however out app that our server suggested be put in with our meals never came out. About 15 minutes later we assumed the app wasn't coming and we began our search for our server (whom never checked to see how our meal was going).  At this point my husbands beer had been empty for about ten minutes as well. We informed the server that part of our order was missing and he looked puzzled so he went to rectify the problem. When he finally came out with our app my husband had to ask for another beer (he clearly wasn't going to). Now, let me just say this, the food was great and the drinks were great. Everything was great, except the service. Other servers walking by paid more attention to us than our server did. I could be wrong, but I was watching to see how many tables he had and the only other one I saw him approach was the one next to us, which it seemed like they may have had a similar experience. We heard them ask for the check THREE times before they actually got it. He never checked up on us or asked how everything was, he wasn't apologetic, and I got the impression that he felt like he didn't need to do much and was just going to get his tip. The nail in the coffin for our visit was when he dropped the checked and didn't say a word, not a \\"sorry,\\" \\"thank you,\\" or \\"have a nice day.\\" Nope, just dropped the check and turned his back and walked away.

(by the way, adding cheese is another 90 cents. really?? i can get extra cheese on a large pizza at my favorite pizza joint for only 1.25, and i guarantee it's a heck of a lot more cheese than i got for 90 cents. i don't remember how much extra it costs at 'the guys' burger joint, but did you know you also can ask for extra cheese and you only get charged once for cheese?) i wasn't too thrilled about the cheese price and was afraid to see what lettuce, tomato and onion, fries and drinks (only one size is available) were priced at.\\n\\nwe only waited 4 or 5 minutes for our food, which was served hot. we were given a number after we ordered but a young lady served us, so we were confused about whether there is supposed to be a server or not. a manager-looking guy came to our table about 2 minutes after we got our food to see if it was ok. we'd hardly taken a bite of the burgers, and the fries were way too hot to even hold, let alone bite into, so we just nodded politely. i LOVE hot fries and these were HOT! these taters have a coating on them that tasted great, too. similar to the flavor on the fries at checker's, but much better fries. the buns were great, too. very fresh, lightly buttered and toasted. oh, and our burgers were all made correctly! that said, it doesn't make up for the dry, severely overcooked, almost tasteless meat. thank goodness we had tomato and condiments on the burgers to give them just a  bit of moisture because we would have choked otherwise. we weren't asked how we wanted them cooked, so i'm not sure if we had a choice. they needed to be cooked at least 1 minute less on each side. they still would have been well done but at least not quite so dry. hey beth, the 'guys' serve them well done AND they are moist and a bit juicy. you might need to check them out and then check out the problem in your edgewood store. the total for all of us was $26 and change. we felt that was way too much, especially considering the meat issue. \\n\\nthe place appeared clean, but our table and a couple others didn't seem like they had been more than wiped off. after eating, i went for a drink refill (do-it-yourself) and spotted a medium-sized roach on the counter near the utensil holder. ICK! i nearly lost my lunch, literally. i realize you're going to have bugs where there is food, but this place has only been open a few weeks, for pete's sake!! there's a big selection of beers, which we opted out of since we had a child with us. but i have had good beer and equal or better burgers at a bowling alley i worked at in college. seriously. and sadly, i can't justify going back even if only for some fries. those fries, the fresh bun and the sweet young lady who brought us our food and later cleared our empty burger baskets when we finished were the bright spots of an otherwise unfavorable visit. she's also the only person who smiled nice and warmly and seemed to be happy we were there. the manager-type guy was nice, but then we didn't see him again. the young lady had said bye as we were getting up from the table, but no one else bothered to look up or say bye or thanks when we left. and they know when you enter and leave because of some noisy bells on the door. \\n\\nbeth, get in there and clean up the place, clean up the workers' act and basically clean house. and take a clue from the 'other guys.'  sorry, but you don't do it better. not even remotely close to being 'as good.'  oh, and can you please do something about that 50s music that was playing? love the music but you're not operating a 50s diner. if you're going to try to be hip, play some hip tunes! and please get someone to clean and disinfect the kids' play grill toy and accessories after one or two kids have played with them. they were so nasty we couldn't wait to get the little one home to get all the germs off her. we'd never have let her touch them if we'd noticed earlier how sticky and greasy they were!\\n\\nwho wants to bet this place won't be open at the end of the year? who wants to bet the 'other guys' will continue to make a killing? i'll gladly drive another 12 minutes or so for their food any day."},{"name":"Island Fin Poke Company","address":"1450 Tuskawilla Rd","city":"Winter Springs","stars":"4.5","text":"By far the best store this space has seen!

Had read a bunch of reviews and decided to give it a try. The 2 women who served were friendly and knowledgeable and let you take your time - they really made the difference. The cream biscuits with the honey butter were warm and crunchy and not great for the person trying to stay away from bread (me). I literally asked to take them home and they were kind enough even to pack up the butter. I had the summer salad - good but not the best; husband had the wedge - better - a little kick to the dressing that elevated it. He had the prime rib which they are apparently known for and it was worth it - a huge portion, extremely tender. I had the tenderloin which was also tender but was a bit overseasoned and salty unfortunately (though melted blue cheese helped). We had the mac and cheese as a side - I am a M&C afficiando and this wasn't my cup of tea. Though I love goat cheese, it needed a bit more oomph (cheddar or something?) as it was bland, and I was not a fan of the carmelized onions - just gave it a weird sweetness. Too full to do dessert so can't comment! Great speakeasy type music. I would recommend this place for a different type of steak dinner experience than your run of the mill big ones in Boston.

Entrees are acceptable, but I tend to find their appetizers very tasty (especially their wings, crab rangoons, and scallion pancakes...all classics for late night anti-inebriation food). Their porridges also aren't bad. Their drink menu though, is all around pretty good, and if you (and a friend or two) are up for it, have a scorpion bowl, which the general Cambridge public speculates is a shot of every alcohol known to man, lots of grapefruit/orange juice, and a dash of purified holy water.

There was no wait at 2:30 and we were warmly greeted by the co-owner Michael and seated immediately. As recent transplants from the San Francisco Bay Area we have been making our rounds at various brunch places Oakwood Bistro, Fable, Fable Diner, Bel Cafe, Yew etc so we can find our regular place. This place is a contender. We ordered the Chicken Karaage Hash, waffle, vegan hash, side of potatoes, side of fried chicken and the oyster chowder. I really appreciated that our food came out hot especially my chowder. The chowder was piping hot and had a thick pat of truffle butter in the middle. The briny oyster pieces were perfectly cooked and were cut into nice bite sized pieces so you were able to fit all the ingredients (crisp tender veggies, bacon and creamy broth) into one spoonful. The well balanced chowder was excellent and the portion was more than enough to serve as a stand alone lunch. My daughter's waffle was fresh with a crispy outside and and tender crumb inside. The whip cream on top was dense and creamy and complemented the waffle well. She didn't even ask for much maple syrup which tells me she really enjoyed the flavors. My semi vegan foodie son who only eats delicious often has trouble finding vegetarian brunch options.  We were thrilled to order the vegan hash for him. It has an nice arrangement of veggies and the sauce was not too rich.  He enjoyed it but what he really liked was the side of fried chicken. It was crispy, juicy and so tasty! It really takes something really delicious to get my reluctant meat eater to eat meat. He said, \\"this place is better than Fable!\\" My husband quickly polished off the chicken karaage so I didn't have a taste.\\nWhat truly shined for me were the drinks we had today. When I stole a taste of my husband's lemonade I had the food critic moment in Pixar's Ratatouille where I was instantly transported home. The lemonade reminded me of our favorite brunch place back home. It was sweet but not too sweet, pleasingly tart with the full aroma and fragrance of a tree ripe lemon. While the lemonade was a lovely reminder of home, what blew my mind was the cold chocolate milk. I am a huge fan of chocolate milk and have never tasted one so delicious and well balanced. It was served at the perfect cold temperature and the deep chocolate flavor punctuated by the wonderful malty caramel taste. It was like drinking the most delicious chocolate bar. \\nI felt the food portions are larger than other fine dining places and the quality ingredients really make the price of the food more than fair. We took home leftovers. We also enjoyed the music, the attentive service and our overall experience. I also wanted to note that the potatoes heat up beautifully in the microwave and taste wonderful. The buttery taste and tender not crispy exterior really allowed the flavors of top quality potatoes really shineI I wish Breakfast Table every success and will be back again soon.

The hostess was very sweet and the waiter enthusiastic, helpful and attentive. The ambiance was very nice. However, the food was very disappointing.  \\n\\nMy friend and I split a meal with 3 meats: pork belly, pork ribs, and pulled pork. It comes with some bread, pickles, and onions and two sides. We chose the coleslaw and the baked beans. We also ordered fried green tomatoes on the side.\\n \\nThe Good: The pork belly and the fried green tomatoes were very nice. The fried green tomato came with a smoked jalapeno dipping sauce and it was delicious. The tomatoes were nice and crispy and the sauce was decadent. The pork belly was good. It was tender and flavorful. \\n\\nThe Meh: The pulled pork, coleslaw, baked beans, and pickles were ok. The pulled pork was good and tasted better after we put some of the vinegar-based bbq sauce and hot sauce on it. It wasn't dry so that was good. The coleslaw was more of a cabbage salad. One inch by one inch squares of red and green cabbage in a light mayo dressing. It was a good foil to the fattiness and something different, but I would not really call it the traditional coleslaw. The baked beans had good flavor but it needed to be cooked longer for my personal taste. The beans didn't really take on the flavor of the liquid around it. The pickles were not very crunchy. \\n\\nThe Bad: The onions that came with the food was soggy and tasteless. Pickled onions in a bit of vinegar and salt or even just fresh onions would be better. The ribs were absolutely awful. It was dry. Very dry. It was almost jerky like. It has a nice smokiness though.  I'm not sure how they could serve it.  You can tell it was tough just by looking at it.  \\n\\nThe Sauces: There was a hot sauce, a vinegar-bbq sauce and a red tomato-based bbq sauce. The hot sauce and vinegar-bbq sauce were good. They have a nice tang but not overly so a hint of sweetness. They were great on the pork-belly. However the tomato-based sauce was kind of weird. It had an almost varnish-like smell to it. Maybe it's just me being weird, but that's what it reminded me of.  \\n\\nI know it just opened recently and they are probably working out the kinks. It seemed like quality control was just not there completely. Also there was the brisket that seemed to look pretty nice and juicy. However, this is no excuse for their other disappointments. \\n\\nA quote from the Boston.com of the proprietor:  \\"There's going to be a sensibility about the food, and a thoughtfulness. My hope is to delight and surprise people.\\"\\n\\nThere certainly was sensibility, though it was more directed towards the restaurant space than the food. There was definitely a lot of thought that went into the decor, the atmosphere, and the training of the front of the house. The waitstaff were a delight. And I was definitely surprised, but not in a good way about the quality of the food.  \\n\\nIf you have been to Fette Sau in Brooklyn. This is Fette Sau's disappointing little sibling.  However, it's only been opened for a few months. So hopefully this little dweeb will grow up to kick it's big brother's New York butt in a few months and offer Boston another good place to get its BBQ fix."},{"name":"Stauf's Coffee Roasters","address":"1277 Grandview Ave","city":"Columbus","stars":"4","text":"Oh Stauf's...where do I begin?

I recommend the road runner and the Marilyn mon-roll. There's something about the temperature of the rolls that made it really awesome.

There are not really any value buys, this removing CMC from great pub contention.\\n\\nWith that being said stop on buy for some great beers and great service, just take it easy on the food."},{"name":"Austin Java","address":"1206 Pkwy","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"Many, many Austinites love the Austin Java Company. Although I'm not as enthusiastic about the place myself, I can see why it has a following. This original location (of two) on the corner of 12th & Lamar is always crowded, always friendly, and always fast. Although Java is technically a coffee/tea shop, they present more like a casual restaurant with a vast, semi-expensive menu of brunch, lunch, dinner and dessert. Additionally, they have a beer and wine list, a kid's menu, and weekly specials. Phone and online ordering, delivery available.\\n\\nThe back patio here is a hot spot for brunch, with a partially-shaded, partially-sunlit set-up. It's a nice spot for soaking up some noonday sun as you catch up on your Chronicle reading, or indulge in a quiet chat with friends. Great for families, great for couples, great for small groups. Some evenings they play old movies on the back wall, some evenings there is live music instead. \\n\\nDespite my positive remarks, I give Austin Java three stars. Although my friends love the food, I've never been impressed by a meal here and the prices are a bit of an additional turn-off. I have nothing against the place, but it would not be my first pick.\\n\\nDefinitely worth a visit."},{"name":"Watershed on Peachtree","address":"1820 Peachtree Rd NW","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3.5","text":"Cost: $15-20/person\\nAmbience: Farmhouse-industrial feel, elegant\\nService: Excellent\\nValue: Excellent\\n\\nWe came here for the Wednesday night fried chicken after hearing so many rave reviews about it. It did not disappoint!! Also, the mashed potatoes were the best that I've ever had. \\n\\nFried chicken - $16\\nWe didn't realize how big the portions were, so we actually ordered two of these for the two of us, and we ended up taking one portion home. Each portion comes with two biscuits, and four pieces of chicken (thigh, wing, drumstick, breast; basically half a chicken). The fried chicken is fried in butter and ham hock lard, and it is amazing! One of the best I've had in Atlanta. The chicken is lightly breaded and super flavorful from the buttermilk brine. If you like your chicken extra crispy with a lot of crunch, this might not be the chicken for you. \\n\\nMashed potatoes\\nSo good. My husband and I agreed that these were the best mashed potatoes that we have ever had. They were creamy, fluffy, buttery, flavorful, and just heavenly. No gravy needed. \\n\\nSummer squash salad\\nThe salad was very pretty and tasted fine. I wasn't blown away, but it was okay. The crispy garlic overwhelmed the dish a bit, and there wasn't enough of the strawberry vinaigrette or dressing to balance it out. \\n\\nOverall, I'd definitely come back for the fried chicken and mashed potatoes!"},{"name":"Grays","address":"301 W 6th St","city":"Vancouver","stars":"3.5","text":"My star review is based solely off food and service.

But we were delighted to find a really nice and cozy interior, and a menu that held too many yummy dishes to order just a couple of tacos.

We all experienced the Salvadorean pupusa for the first time that day, at both places, and agreed the one at Cactus had a better casing, but the bean pupusa at Cancun was very edible. The beef enchilada was incredibly delicious, although it resembled an open faced hard shell taco more than what we think of as an enchilada.

People had started to leave, so I was lucky enough to find parking on the main drag.  Hadn't planned on going here, but saw it, heard of it before, and decided to give it a whirl.\\n\\nA couple years ago I was in Austin, TX, and had many BBQ options; stepping into this place was a throwback to that trip.  Mason jars for your water & soda beverages, a nice touch.\\n\\nI was a little taken back by the prices at first glance.  $20 for 1/2 chicken tray seemed a bit steep, but considering the location, they need to charge a premium.  I ended up getting the pulled pork tray, with the broccoli casserole and cole slaw.  My wife ordered the brisket sandwich without sides ($12), and we split the two I got with my meal, which was the right choice.  Had I read the reviews here first, I probably would have ordered a biscuit, but I passed, as there was plenty of food a comin'!  Portion sizes on both were good.  As mentioned above, splitting the sides was best for us.  \\n\\nAmbiance - They definitely go for the southern BBQ look and feel.  We arrived just before the sox game let out, so it was mostly dead to start, and standing room only with people out the door when we left.  Very basic amenities.  Did get very crowded and loud.\\n\\nQuantity - Portion sizes were good, both of us left full.\\n\\nQuality - Southern style BBQ.  It was good.  We weren't looking for high class.\\n\\nValue - Price isn't bad, a little steeper than I was thinking heading into the restaurant (just looking for quick/cheap eats).  Because we split the sides I received with my tray, everything evened out, if we both ordered trays, it would've been $25 each meal, plus drinks, which isn't bad, but I was thinking $15 a plate walking through the door.\\n\\nService - Probably the biggest challenge.  A waiter stopped by our table shortly after we were seated, but he didn't end up being our waiter.  Our actual waiter stopped by and took our drink order, then disappeared for 5+ minutes.  Placed our order, and the food came out in a reasonable amount of time.  The waiter checked on us a few minutes after the food was brought out, but never came back (and didn't get refills for the rest of the meal).  We had to flag him down to get the check, and it took him 5-10 minutes to get it to us.  It did get busy, so it's not entirely his fault, but this drop in service did impact the experience.\\n\\nOverall - I'd give this place 3.5 stars, rounding up to 4.  If they shaved a couple dollars off the price, namely the biscuits ($10 for 4 biscuits) & sides, I would give it a solid 4.  If in the area, I'd go there again, but I wouldn't go out of my way to get there, as it's a crazy busy area."},{"name":"Diesel Cafe","address":"257 Elm St","city":"Somerville","stars":"4","text":"Great cafe for chilling or working out of -- the counter at the front might lead you to be unaware of the huge amount of space in this place, so there's very little chance of not being able to find somewhere to set-up.

Since we were going to the Fenway theatre, I suggested Longhorn, since it's right there, and given my friends' penchant for running late and our ability to have a dinner last three hours, I decided on the closest possible restaurant to the threatre. Ding ding ding! We have a winner! This place is adjacent to the theater. Not only that, but we found out when we were getting our bill that they sell vouchers at the restaurant that you can redeem for movie tickets. The vouchers are only $7 (cheapest price you will find anywhere... it's regularly $10.75 at the theatre and even the student or senior discount will still set you back $8.50). The vouchers aren't restricted, so you can use them on a newly-released movie. That was pretty awesome.\\n\\nI am a big fan of steak tips and will order them just about anywhere that I can. That was no different here. I figured a steakhouse would have good steak tips, right? WRONG! The tips were BLAH at best. I asked for medium rare and they were more of a medium. They were not flavorful at all and the tips themselves were tiny. They were more like steak morsels. My friend got a chicken sandwich that barely covered the bun (however, her Mojito was served in like a full 20 ounce glass! That was a nice surprise there). Oh, and they forgot to bring us bread, even though we asked for it. \\n\\nThe one thing I will rave about is the dessert. We got something called the Chocolate Stampede, which was two pieces of this delicious layered cake of 7 different kinds of chocolate, with whipped cream, vanilla ice cream, and chocolate sauce. It was absolutely to-die-for! The three of us could only finish half of it because it was so huge!

The sizzling shrimp now only comes with around six shrimp, which is a bummer, and you no longer get bread and hummus at the beginning of the meal, which just feels cheap on their part (since they are most likely making up whatever the bread and hummus costs them with the new higher prices).

There was also a magazine mounted at the entrance that showed the bartender winning GQ's most inventive bartender award.\\n\\nWe did manage to get into the restaurant, which was really interesting since the decor made it feel like you were eating in a museum (I think it actually is a historic mansion). There was a limited drink menu from the bar and the drinks were excellent. They have a \\"special\\" food menu that's not listed on the website and I don't know if they give to everyone, but ask for it as it has the authentic stuff. Highlights for food were the Kung Pao chicken (I think it's labeled chicken with peanuts on the \\"special\\" menu), and the fermented rice wine dessert. The chicken was one of the best I've ever had, sweet and savory. Don't be too afraid of the sichuan peppers. They're more numbing than spicy, it's an interesting sensation. The fermented rice wine dessert (I think it was called rice ball dessert or something on their special menu) was a favorite. It had soft and chewy sweet rice balls in a broth that tasted like warm sake. It was amazing. We also had the double cooked fish, which was a fried fish cooked with leeks. It was OK, not something I'd order again.\\n\\nOne con is that the restaurant looks unimpressive from the outside. You might drive by it thinking it's just a \\"regular\\" Chinese restaurant.

I got sausage instead of the side, and while there was a 75 cent upcharge, I got four patties which I couldn't even finish. \\n\\nAt $4.50, the frozen margsmade with real fruit  (got me a strawberry swirl) are post-workout perfecto.

I'll have to agree wholeheartedly with Stephanie J and say this place is overhyped. \\nBased solely on the 101 reviews here that average 4 stars, we ventured into this S. Lamar hole in the wall. I can overlook just about anything cosmetic when the fare is THAT good. So sorry to report that the food  was just  mediocre.\\nBecause the food wasn't great I cannot help but comment on the cosmetic issues of the decor and the general ambiance of the place. The parking is bizarre. The AC was not functioning properly. The interior walls are in desperate need of a good scrub-down and a coat of paint. Trim issues abound. I couldn't help but look around before we were served and think  surely the food is better than their maintenance?\\nWe ordered an appetizer (sopecitos) and and entree (cochinita pibil) to share.  I was less than impressed with the sopecitos. The corn \\"cake\\" tasted like it was pre-made and warmed over on the grill. Very chewy and old. The toppings were also just so-so. \\nThe cochinita pibil was a little better. The meat portion of that entree was really actually very tasty. The 4 small pieces of plantain were also pretty good. The white rice that accompanied the entree had a nice flavor but about 10 percent of the rice was either old and hard or just undercooked.  The black beans had a great flavor and the portion was very large in proportion to the rest of the dish....but they were  room temp. Bummer. The chips and salsa that were served upon being seated were very good. Warm chips and just piquoso enough salsa.  The house margaritas (on the rocks) were very weak. \\nThe ladies room experience was just a continuation of the poor maintenance experienced in the dining room. See photo. \\nOverall, not a great experience. I can take the sparse decor and the rough-around-the edges feel of a local hole-in-the wall IF and ONLY IF the food makes up for it. This just didn't do it for me.  Must mention that the price of the food is also on the higher end of what I'd like to pay for Mexican food.

When asked if we could perhaps receive some kind of discount for the unexpectedly doubled wait time, she stammered about Maki Madness already being a great deal, then offered \\"I mean, the poor guy got a ticket.\\"  At the risk of sounding like the ultimate unfeeling jerk - don't you often have to do something wrong to get pulled over?

I got my pizza back hairless at 8:45pm, 15 mins before we were supposed to get the boot. The manager never even came to the table. Just awful. \\n\\nJhaleel really wasn't personable and each time he had to come to our table he seemed pained. He came more towards the end to shuffle us out because \\"they\\" (they regulars) were there.  I think someone learned that his mom was a manager or owner and prompted him to hurry us.\\n\\n There were 15 empty tables when we arrived and at least 4 when we left. The ambiance was nice, but the restaurant was extremely cramped. Like don't be obese and expect to pass easily cramped. It was some kind of special night as it was the live band's last show of the year. I won't likely be back, as I like to digest my food after I've eaten it. It wasn't a good experience.

The bar was dirty and sticky and after we asked the bartender to clean it, she used a bar rag that had and left that old bar rag smell;  drinks were served in dirty glassware and something was swimming in it - parsley? Mint?    Food was served, we had to ask for utensils, had to ask for condiments, on the way out, i used the rest room - it was filthy and didnt even have a paper towel to dry my hands.

Then again, somebody has to pay for Mickey's digs so why not us.  As we were walking around the boardwalk, I was surprised and excited to see a celebrity chef owned Greek restaurant triumphantly emerge, like Poseidon, from the sea of predictable and boring theme park dining establishments. I politely coerced my dining companions to give it a try.  There was a 45 minute wait (on a Friday evening), but hey lines are part of the theme park experience, right?  So, we just grabbed a drink at one of the bars to kill time (mission accomplished for Disney!) and we returned.  We were promptly seated and greeted by a friendly waiter.  The food was average and not what you'd expect of a celebrity chef.  Also, some of the twists on favorite Greek dishes fell flat, especially the Pikilia (Greek dip sampler).

They graciously accommodated, and sat us in a very comfortable, very chic booth. This is where things stopped being good and started going downhill.\\n\\nIt was clear our server was either new to the restaurant or new to serving in general, which very much influenced and impacted our overall experience. He arrived to take our drink order and when one person in our party said she hadn't decided yet, he delayed entering our drink order, for several minutes, until she had decided vs. entering what he had at the time and bringing things to us. We ended up waiting for 15 - 20 minutes to get our drinks, including a cup of coffee, which didn't leave a good first impression.\\n\\nOther reviewers are right in that the portion sizes are very large, and in many cases, could easily be shared. In general, our food was just OK. The omelettes were more egg than filling, saved primarily by the home fries, which were the highlight of our meal. The people in our party who ordered the skillets were expecting scrambled eggs, but they arrived as if the eggs had just been cracked into the skillet prior to being brought to our table - not even the egg whites were completely cooked through. The monkey bread was good, but didn't live up to the explanation of being ooey and gooey.\\n\\nWe had to ask our server multiple times for refills of water and coffee, and when it came time for the bill, I personally had to lay out for him how to split up our checks - when he should have been the person who had kept track of who had ordered what.

Every bite I took required me to bite through skin and copious amounts of fat.  I do not enjoy half fat/half meat wings.  Some may, but I do not.  Thinking that this was just one or two wings out of the bunch, I proceeded to work on the rest.

The person that I was with agreed with my assessment as well.  \\n\\nAlong with the wings we also ordered a quesadilla.  The waitress (or perhaps cook?) forgot about the quesadilla, so we had to ask after a while, \\"Are the quesadillas still coming out?\\"  The waitress said yes, but after about five minutes, she brought it out and admitted that it was forgotten about.  Happily, she gave us the quesadilla for free, which was nice.  \\n\\nA friend bought the fireballs, but it looked pretty messy with tons and tons of sauce all over the dish.

Every single time has been excellent.  Service is sometimes great and sometimes just ok, but hey, they get busy.  Plus, any time you come into a place with attitude, expect to get some back at ya.  To the high maintenance folks out there: servers get less than minimum wage, and even with tips it is not enough to wipe your yuppie ass, even if you do order omakase.  \\n\\nI was lucky enough to grow up in the paradise of the Pacific Northwest, and regularly ate and caught fish all over Oregon, Washington, Alaska, Hawaii, Canada and California.  Although I am no fish expert ala Jiro-san of Japan, my experience has taught me a little about fish.  Also I have worked at many restaurants, including a Japanese owned sushi place in Portland, Oregon.  And I sometimes make my own sushi at home.  When you get down to it, sushi is simply about the fish.  All the other stuff is just fluff.  Although I do enjoy when the \\"fluff\\" includes Yebisu!!  Musashino is the closest to the better places out west.  \\n\\nBTW, good sushi is never cheap.  Expertise in selection, procurement, and preparation can't be learned in a couple of years at a cooking school.  Good sushi is the result of high level professionalism and passion.  Consider that a night for two at a new release flick with drinks and snacks easily and quickly reaches $50.  Or look at the price of a good quality steak dinner.  Good beef is a little easier to come by than good fish, is not as tricky to store, handle and prepare, yet will still set you back a similar amount.

Start by walking to the back left, where you will find a thinly staffed bar and order yourself some shots. You'll need it to survive the bad music (seriously, why can't they just play the music from the second floor) and crowded floor. It's a pretty small space that seems even smaller with the ring of people who stand around it staring. Not dancing, just staring.\\n\\nAnd when you've finally realized that the music won't get better and the DJ won't play your song no matter how many times you ask, it's time to stop by the first floor.

Because I'm not fond of pork belly, I steer away from it & order the Tonkotsu ramen. It's just as delicious with leaner roast pork rather than the soft, fatty pork belly.

The cloudy, white colored pork bone broth is savory & filled with immense flavor while the noodles are cooked perfectly. The bowl looks small but the portions are far from it.\\n\\nThe hot dish appetizer of bok choy is good but why must you cut off the leaves, Yuzu? That's the best part about bok choy. It was still tasty but it would've been more succulent if the leaves hadn't been removed.\\nAnother hot dish appetizer to try is the agedashi tofu. It's several large chunks of lightly fried tofu bathed in a broth much like soy sauce but lighter in flavor & less salty. A sprinkle of diced, green chives top it off should one desire more flavors in their bite.\\n\\nFor everyone out there, especially Dorene S., Yuzu does accept reservations as well as walk-ins. They open at 6:00pm but fill up very quickly due to its small sized venue & because of this reservations are recommended. If you call before or after business hours then leave a message to reserve your spot. They will return your call just an hour or so before opening & I've never had any problems with it.\\n\\nYuzu is located in a strip mall on the opposite end of Best Teriyaki.

I've never tried their food or personally spoken to anyone that works here. But I've experienced their customer service which is off the charts. The GC got delivered on my friend's birthday (today) so she ended up with something in time.

The prices were a little off-putting, but I had a taste for a steak, so I finally decided to pull the trigger.\\n\\nI was greeted warmly as I entered.  I was alone and decided to sit at the bar.  Quiet, clean, dark wood.  Looks like a steakhouse.  It was early in the dinner hour and it was Monday.  Still, it was surprisingly empty.  \\n\\nI asked for a beer list and was disappointed to see a very sparse selection, but I was here for steak, not beer, so I cut them some slack.  I ordered a Terrapin Hopsecutioner on draft, which I thought would pair well with the steak that was in my head, but I was told that they were out.  I reluctantly settled for a Sweetwater 420.  Not a good start.\\n\\nI ordered a 16oz Delmonico steak.  In my experience, it's a rare restaurant that doesn't overcook a steak ordered Medium Rare but, at these prices, I was confident that wouldn't be an issue.  Nevertheless, I took pains to explain to my server that I wanted it cooked between Rare and Medium Rare, just to be safe.  She suggested 'Rare plus', which sounded like a good enough description, so I went with that.  I then discovered that the steak was served ala carte, so I added an $8 'loaded' baked potato (!!!).\\n\\nI've grown accustomed to priming my taste buds with a salad, but, since I neglected to order a salad course (dinner is ala carte), the steak arrived a bit quicker than expected and I had to dive right in.  Not a major fail, just an unexpected adjustment.  \\n\\nThe steak had a very prominent char - just the way I like it.  Unfortunately, the char came across like a burnt layer of heavy seasoning, in which only the salt survived.  I couldn't quite pick out whatever else might have been in there.  Sadly, 'Rare plus' was not much different than the overcooked Medium Rare I awkwardly tried to avoid.  It was more of a 'Medium minus'.  My server asked if the steak was cooked to my satisfaction, and I told her that, in hindsight, I should have gone with my gut and ordered it Rare.  She seemed ready to offer to replace it (I'm guessing), but it was far from inedible, so I preemptively declined (I try hard not to be 'that guy').  That said, it doesn't appear that they skimped on the quality of the beef itself, which certainly helped mitigate the overcooking.  Butter was a bit heavy handed, but it didn't hurt anything, so I won't dwell on that.  The potato was cooked perfectly, but otherwise unremarkable, though it seems 'loaded' may be just a word on the menu.\\n\\nThe meal was far from a disaster but, at $60+, my expectations were a bit higher.  Judging from many of the reviews, my experience may, indeed, have been a fluke but, at $60+, ...\\n\\nI'm glad I went, if only to satisfy my curiosity.  I may give them another chance, I may not.

A quaint little store that puts me in mind of an old general store.   Not sure of a certain flavor or roast, I told them what I was looking for - a light to medium roast, not too strong on flavor, low acid - the clerk gave me a good selection to ponder, so I fell back to the old sniff test, the one with the best smell.    \\n\\nI broke out the beans this AM, ground them fresh and with the coldest water available brewed a pot.

The Creole sauce was enough to ensure each bite of chicken and vegetables was a burst of spicy goodness. \\nOur server, Lindsy, inquired as to whether we had been there before and we mentioned we were visiting from California for our anniversary. Next thing we knew, she thoughtfully brought us a complimentary dessert of their Chocolate Peanut Butter Crunch Bar. Although we were completely stuffed from dinner, this delicious mini portion was not to be passed up. Lindsy even had a sweet congratulatory message written on the plate.

It was here that I first tried carnitas. Perfectly succulent, tender chunks of pork rendered in fat then fried to give them a somewhat crispy, rich deliciousness. Other than a few double-doubles animal style at In'n'Out this was all I ate for the remainder of the trip. Upon returning home to Boston, I started up a new job in Harvard Square and found myself in line at Felipe's. What did I see?? Carnitat! And man, I have to tell you, they are every bit as good as the ones I was having withdrawl from. The super burritos are pretty much perfectly executed - and it's the combination of the superior \\"featured\\" ingredients (carnitas, chicken, steak, chorizo) and all the little details that hands-down separate Felipe's from the local pack of fugazi, imposter burrito/taco joints. You can have the Pro's behind the counter assemble your freshly steamed tortilla with any number of fresh side items: the fire roasted corn, vegetables, and cilantro/onion mixtures are truly expert and the salsas and sauces are even different that most places around (as in they didn't come out of a jar!!!). All of these items are miles and miles better than any chain burrito place (...you listening, boloco? qdoba? chipotle?). Do yourself a favor and try anything Felipe's has to offer (if they have a special, get that TOO) - but if you want to try what I consider to be the Holy Grail, ask for a Super Burrito with corn, salsa, and cilantro then throw on some of their habanero sauce as you work your way through it. Quite simply hand-held culinary perfection."},{"name":"City Landing","address":"255 State St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"Just had dinner at City Landing last night for Valentine's day with the boy. We arrived an hour before our 7 pm reservation and they were still able to seat us right away. Props there for good service. \\n\\nOnce seated, we were offered water and our waiter brought our bread. I'm a huge bread person and their bread is very subpar ...and I wish they had an olive oil dipping of sorts instead of just butter. But this is just me being really picky...\\n\\nAnyways, on to the food! We ordered the spanich and ricotta dumpling which isn't shaped like a dumpling, like I was expecting. If it had been crispy on the outside, it would've been a 5/5 but it was more mushy. However, the flavors were great and I LOVED the mushrooms and herbs on top. Delicious.\\n\\nFor entrees, we got the nova pizza and the day boat scallops. The pizza was much smaller than I expected (after viewing the pics on here and their website). But it was still a pretty large portion for one person. It was really yummy but at the same time was very rich due to all the salmon, capers, and oil. The scallop dish on the other hand was mediocre for me. The scallops were definitely fresh but mine we'rent cleaned thoroughly and had small grains of sand. I'm also very picky with my scallops and like a very good sear on each side, which these didn't have. I would say a 3/5 for the scallops. The mushroom ravoli though was incredible and I finished it all. \\n\\nThe portion sizes are decent and we were nice and full afterwards.

If I could compare it to anything in the U.S., it'd probably the equivalent to the hamburger:  It's cheap, fast, familiar, and found at just about any self respecting chain or Mom & Pop restaurant.  Of course, just like any place that serves hamburgers, some places are better than others.      \\n\\nAnyway, back to Musashino.  The ramen, I believe, is only served during lunchtime on weekdays and they have at least three different varieties available.  I sampled the Miso (fermented soy bean) variety.  \\n\\nThis is a \\"Hokkaido style\\" ramen that comes with egg noodles, corn, sprouts, fish cake, dried seaweed, and pork slices in a miso broth.  The ingredients seemed pretty typical, although I've seen this type of ramen served also with or without a pat of butter on the top in Japan.  This particular version does not.     \\n\\nOn to the evaluation.  Three things I look for in judging are the quality of the broth, noodles, and the pork slices.      \\n\\nBroth - 7/10 - Actually, this was much better than I expected.  It wasn't too thick, nor too watery--just the right consistency and Miso flavor.  \\n\\nNoodles - 5/10 - I'd be very surprised if these were made in-house.  The texture and flavor weren't great, but they weren't horrible either.  Average.   \\n\\nPork- 3/10 - Surprisingly, the pork slices (which is really the best part of the ramen soup) were not pork at all but rather beef brisket!  It didn't actually taste as strange as I thought, and the brisket was rather tender, but the substitution of the original ingredient (which isn't noted on the menu) and the fact the meat had a very smokey flavor resulted in the low score.  \\n\\nOverall, I give Musashino a 6/10 score for their ramen.  If you've never had this dish before and are feeling somewhat adventurous, this is a decent introductory to a Japanese staple that's often hard to find outside of Japan."},{"name":"Tony Roma's","address":"8560 International Dr","city":"Orlando","stars":"3.5","text":"Nettes Ambiente, freundliche Bedienungen.

I had heard good things from work colleagues, especially since they have a vegetarian/vegan and gluten-free menu. Being a vegetarian myself, I was excited to know that I had lots of options rather than always having to order the pancakes. I ordered a cup of the tomato bisque and the vegetarian butternut squash pizzetta. Our waitress even double-checked to find out if I wanted the vegetarian or the vegan version of the pizzetta.\\nThe soup was great! Artfully poured and delicious. When the pizzetta came out, I basically dug right in. With the second bite, I realized I had just chewed a piece of bacon. Blech. When I notified our waitress that my pizza was not vegetarian, she quickly took it away and said she would have a new one made for me. Maybe 15 minutes later the meat-free pizza arrived. My friends had all finished their food and I had lost my appetite.\\nI've been vegetarian for a year and a half, and I go out to eat pretty frequently. Even at restaurants that are not known for being veg-friendly, I have -never- been served meat by accident. I'm surprised that we weren't comped my meal, but I guess I didn't act as outraged as I should have. Mostly I just felt disappointed and a bit betrayed. If you try to be a good veg-friendly restaurant, maybe try a little harder to not serve me meat."},{"name":"Centro Mexican Kitchen","address":"950 Pearl St","city":"Boulder","stars":"4","text":"Centro contacted me following my last post and invited me to come back to retry their restaurant.

They have changed their menu, fewer items and a lot less interesting selection. The pricing is ridiculous compared to the quality and quantity of what you get.\\n\\nWe arrived at 4:58pm and with all the doors open, we walked right in and were rudely told it would be a few minute and to waist outside. They could have said it in a much nicer manner. The hostess, throughout the evening seemed surely and unhappy which reflected in her dealings with customers. Our waitress was very nice, though.\\n\\nIt was happy hour, so I ended up having two of their drink specials and they were very good...a Union gin and cucumber cocktail with an Asian spice on the rim @ $6 each.\\n\\nThe ribs and fish hand roll were part of the happy hour menu. Ribs were good and we each had four ribs. The spicy tuna fish roll was very average and, sadly, didn't taste very fresh. Then, off the main menu, we had the tuna prosciutto because it sounded interesting. The tuna is cured/dried so a bit on the chewy side and the Asian pear was twice as big as the tuna. This dish had five pieces for $16. The yellowtail sashimi was by far the best dish with a ginger vinaigrette and shiso. Six pieces but still very small in size @ $14.\\n\\nOur bill was over $80 for the two of us and it just wasn't worth it.\\n\\nThen the final straw is their policy on charging the customer 5% of the bill for a 'health and wellness charge' so they can provide health insurance for all employees. Raise your rates to cover your employee health plan...DO NOT EXPECT US TO FOOT YOUR HEALTH INSURANCE PROGRAM AS AN ADDITIONAL CHARGE ON OUR BILL.  If you want to make a political statement against ACA then do so in big, huge lettering so I can turn around and leave before we sit down, order a drink and THEN see the small print on the bottom of the menu.  Finally, we had to deduct the amount out of the overall bill charge so we could tip on the actual food/service.  This was insulting!\\n\\nFood was average, service ran hot and cold, and the pricing for what you get is way off.

You might as well be in your run-of-the-mill New York sushi place (except for the clientele, which give the whole charade away in an instant).  In this sense, the decor is actually a little cliched and forced.  They may be trying a little too hard to cultivate a \\"modern\\" \\"cutting edge\\" aesthetic, and this effort is a bit out of place in context of the surrounding neighborhood.

Perfect ripples of milk froth and espresso.

Topped off with a dollop of cold whipped cream and a sprinkle of cinnamon, like one of the best things in the world needed help being any better. \\nIt was nothing like I ever had before, and I went back with family just two days later and they were completely out of it. Instead, I went with their hot caramel chocolate, a liquid version of a chocolate turtle.

They're open until 10 on weekdays and midnight on weekends, so a good study spot for after-dinner productiveness. \\nBut sometimes on weekend nights, you see people having fun and hearty conversations. And then when you find yourself there studying, it can make you feel a little sad inside. Good for people watching and white noise."},{"name":"Elevation Burger","address":"2525 W.

Very trendy in the heart of historic Grandview station. \\nThey change the brews and dark roast on daily basis, from Sumatra Vienna, to Ethiopian, to Kaldi's, etc... They mainly use imported Guatemalan along other premiums.\\nThe best aspect of Stauf's is the amazing friendly staff. They play pretty cool indie music too.

I thought it would be a fresh option. It wasn't. When we walked in it smelled like old fish. The prices were high and the bowls were very small. Nothing about what we ordered tasted fresh. I tried very hard to like this place but ended up spitting out my chewy old tuna and rotten cucumbers.. threw it away and went to Panera next door. Do yourself a favor before you eat here, google this great place called Lemonshark. It's a much better representation of what this place is trying to be. Finally, the staff should focus their time on improving their food quality rather than attempting to discredit any negative reviews."},{"name":"Hale Pele","address":"2733 NE Broadway","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"From the outside this place is pretty unassuming. In a quiet part of Broadway with not much around it. It's easy to miss if you aren't paying attention. The inside however is bursting with mise-en-scene. The decor is strictly nouveau tiki and will take a few years to build up that seasoning of a well crafted tiki bar like Tiki Ti in LA or even Alibi up here. However it does have a sunken bar which is a definite plus. There is also a thunderstorm that goes off every hour a la Amazon Cafe. \\n\\nWhat you really come here for is the dranks and they definitely deliver. The menu gives homage to the originator of the drink which I think is fantastic, especially for the tiki beginner. The spirits and mixes are top notch and delicious and in true tiki fashion, it only takes a few drinks to do you in. However, they are definitely on the pricey side so be forewarned. They also have beer on tap and at $4 for a pint of micro, it's well priced. The tall boys are a $1 more then they should be though. Another great thing is that you can get anything fire, even a tall boy!!

Tucked away behind the cruising Whole Foods, The Haven is dark and inviting (?? even romantic in that eclectic way?) -- from the antler adorned light fixtures to the picked veg, slab of oat bread, and generous pat of salted butter immediately placed in front of me as I sat down, I was charmed.\\n\\nAlthough it bills itself as pubby/Scottish, it's completely feasible that even the fussiest eater will walk away happy -- the apps range from traditional smoked fish boards and haggis/neeps to a chilled tomato soup and tasty little salads. For mains we went non-Scottish -- scallops for me and trout for my pal -- the scallops were perfectly cooked, and word on the street is that the trout (which came w/ a deep-fried egg on top!) was equally banging.\\n\\nService is friendly and unobtrusive -- I obviously fell in love when the hostess and I bonded over our adult passion for glitter -- and we weren't rushed at all. Oh, no full liquor license, but they have a billion beers and some nice lil cocktails, though all of them were a bit sweet for my taste -- all I really wanted was a bourbon on the rocks.

Essentially you DIY your bowl of noodles - picking your own soup, type of noodles, and your choice of 2 toppings. \\nI tried the laksa soup base, with instant noodles and tried their recommended fresh fish slices and beef tripe. There weren't that many pieces of beef tripe and fish slices, probably 3 of each which was decent. Love the laksa soup base - really rich in flavor. The bowl of noodles also comes with a lot of cabbage which I like. \\nOriginally I was thinking the egg waffles probably suck since they are only charging you $1 for it and they were all premade, but nope, surprisingly they tasted good! Reminded me of the egg waffles I had in Hong Kong - crispy and slightly crunchy, but soft inside and not soggy at all. More on the sweeter side.\\nApparently the Hainanese chicken rice was one of their specialties, which was slightly disappointing though. The chicken meat was smooth and tender, boneless, but lacked a bit of flavor. It did come with sauce but the sauce wasn't too strong in flavor either.

Large and rustic with granite tables, woven seats, and wood beams exposed plus bakers dressed in white aprons and caps similar to those seen in Parisian patisseries overseeing the production of an ample selection of breads, sandwiches, entrements, and pastries it seemed at first glance that St. Honore would be the sort of place I'd love and yet from my first encounter with the monotone server to the part where I had to wait fifteen minutes for their signature pastry to be plucked from a case and placed in a box the experience was less than ideal.\\n\\nMoving past service issues and the dreadful logistics of parking, the four selections from St. Honore ranged from decent to exemplary and beginning low working towards high this started with another lackluster Almond Croissant - something I found quite common in Portland - this one with an excellent crunch to the shell but enough frangipane that it essentially constituted frosting, turning the interior into a sort of sweet pudding and negating any semblance of nuance; something I hope the local pigeons didn't mind when I left more than half on the street.\\n\\nMoving next to a pair of my favorites, both decent but neither astounding, a canele de Bordeaux would prove to be a bit too soggy, though nicely flavored, while the kouign amann was actually textbook in texture - the layers all nicely separated and shattering to the tooth - but a bit too sweet, thus hiding the butter tones of an otherwise fine attempt.\\n\\nFinally, and perhaps most appropriately, the last bites of St. Honore would come in the form of a picture perfect St. Honore - each of the lacquered choux balls filled with creamy custard, the base layer flaky and topped with fresh whipped cream, and buttery tones deftly balanced against the sweetness.

First off, the important stuff...they had fresh fish and tasty sushi.  That is the big plus, however, what makes me cautious, is when a restaurant offers selections from multiple nationalities/cultures/countries.  Usually the quality and authenticity of these dishes suffer.  I had the Vietnamese noodle soup, which were decent.  The edamame was tasty.

It was hard to spot simple vacationers, but I hear it gets better during peak travel months, but note this hotel is a conference center through and through. \\n\\nAnyway, we started off with some mojitos, which were really yummy. For entrees, we had the pappardelle pasta with mushrooms and scallops, as well as the butternut squash ravioli with lobster meat. The first dish was a little lackluster even though I'm a big fan of all three: pappardelle pasta, mushrooms and scallops. I think everything tasted okay, it was just more an issue with texture. The pasta was pretty cold and tasted stale - not what I was expecting at all. The ravioli dish however, which was highly recommended by our awesome waiter Brian, was heavenly!

This totally hit the spot. Made with slow-braised short rib with porchini mushroom cream sauce topped with grana padano-- divine! The rib was moist and flavorful, it melted in my mouth. Pasta was cooked al dente and soaked up the sauce well.

Ocean wise lingcod was beer battered and topped with shredded cabbage, chipotle aioli, fire roasted tomato salsa, pickled red onions and guacamole wrapped in a soft tortilla shell.

Again, we were offered nothing but a small apology (note to manager: at least offer to throw in some cookies, dude). The sandwiches sucked overall.

The stove was usually manned by the owner, who's personality made you feel as though you were dining in his home, not at a restaurant. He was even known to occasionally handed out meatballs to patrons while they waited- it's the little details such as this that go a long way! \\n\\nThis brings me to my most recent experience, and the only word that comes to mind is \\"underwhelming.\\" It would be unfair to say I had poor service, but once again it just didn't go the extra mile that I had grown accustomed to from their staff. It's almost as if once the former owner left, they lost their passion for the place. The food finally arrived and this is where we really became disappointed. The shrimp scampi consisted of 6 small shrimp, more fit for the portion on a children's menu. The raviolis were overcooked, leaving my oversaturated cheese filled pasta very limp in texture. \\n\\nTo be honest, I'm not sure how fair this review is, as it's biased based on the excellent establishment that once was \\"Victor's\\".

At one point I was left with a water glass at low tide and I had to flag him and ask for a refill, which should not have happened.

The chicken Bryan was awesome but I love anything with goat cheese. The steak on the Johnny was amazing. It was cooked perfectly, tender and juicy plus the sauce was outstanding.....it didn't have as many mushrooms as it usually does but man was it good. I paired it with the garlic mashed potatoes which were seasoned perfectly and creamy. The shrimp in my husband's dish was fresh and had a great taste. All in all, I would go back today and order the same thing if I could convince my husband to go again. Highly recommmend! Way better than some other italian restaurants!

Until yesterday we had never been disappointed.  \\n\\nWe arrived at Haiku around 3pm on Saturday afternoon.  There were no patrons inside and about 5 tables filled at the patio.  After being seated we waited for almost 10 minutes for the server to great us.  He asked us for our drink order which took at least an additional 20 minutes. He brought my sister in law and I the wrong drinks and completely forgot my husbands.  My sister in law who is a vegetarian ordered the vegetarian fried rice.  The server gave her chicken fried rice.  Chicken.  She's vegetarian.   She doesn't eat chicken.  Therefore the vegetarian request.   So she had to wait for that to be corrected.  The remainder of our service was sub par through our meal.  When he finally brought our checks my brother and sister in law's was incorrect.  He took that back and fixed it.  He then billed my credit card for their meal.  He didn't realize this until I had already signed the receipt.  He took it back, had to void out the first transaction and then re-billed me.  Since this occurred on a Saturday the \\"voided\\" transaction won't drop out of my pending charges until either Monday or Tuesday.  As a result I have an additional $98.00 being held out of my account.  \\n\\nEssentially, although the food was great, the service and number of mistakes were so terrible by our server that the $137.00 bill I received at the end felt like a slap in the face not to mention the additional $98 that I was incorrectly billed.  Needless to say that although we have loved Haiku in the past we are no longer lovers of this establishment.  We have been to many Sushi restaurants and Asian Fusion restraints throughout Columbus.  There are many great ones out there with food that is just as good or better and who's service has never disappointed."},{"name":"The Lobster Stop","address":"723 Washington St","city":"Quincy","stars":"4","text":"I ordered the large clam strip box, a single lobster roll and the lobster bisque.

Boy, was I missing out! This place is awesome!\\n\\nMy boyfriend and I were up in the Polaris area today and decided to stop somewhere for lunch. We went to BJ's to finally give it a try. It's located right by the Polaris mall so if you're out shopping it's right there. But, you have to drive back in these little service roads to get to it so it's a bit confusing. You can see it from the road but it's kind of difficult to get back there! parking isn't bad since they have their own lot.\\n\\nIt's a really cool looking place inside. There are some brick walls and the rest of the walls are painted really bright colors - green, red and gold. There is also very dark wood paneling throughout the dining room and it looks very classy yet casual. The ceiling is unfinished and you can see the pipes but it fits the atmosphere and doesn't come off looking cheap. It's a really comfortable place - we felt like we could have hung out there all day. There was a big TV right by our table that I was sort of watching, and TVs were here and there all over the place. There was also a huge screen behind the bar with several different TVs showing several different channels. This looks like a great place to come and watch a game and sit at the bar and enjoy some good food when you're hungry. The place is also very big and spacious. The high ceilings make it seem bigger than it is, maybe, but it's just a comfortable space.\\n\\nMy boyfriend spotted the Avocado Spring Rolls appetizer as soon as he opened the menu. We both love avocado so that appetizer choice was a given. Our waitress came by and got us some waters and we put on our order for the spring rolls. And when they came out...yum! They were stuffed with avocados and surprisingly filling. I could only eat two pieces. It also came with this Asian-style sauce to dip it in. It was very sweet, like there was honey in it, and the consistency was like honey as well. Those were the best spring rolls I've ever had, and they were very high-quality since they really were packed with avocados. So good!\\n\\nOur server was also very nice and there was no wait to be seated. The place wasn't very full - just a few tables here and there. Not bad for a Friday afternoon.\\n\\nEverything else on the menu looked so good. The deep dish pizzas looked amazing. They also had burgers, sandwiches, wraps, pastas and desserts. My boyfriend decided on the California Burger and I chose the BBQ Chicken Chopped Salad. The wait wasn't very long for our food, and we didn't even notice anyway because we were in avocado heaven with those appetizers.\\n\\nWhen our food came out I couldn't believe my eyes. My salad was HUGE! But first, my boyfriend's food. His burger was served on bread and there was more avocado, pepper jack cheese and southwestern ranch. It was delicious. He also got a side of fries with his burger and chose the wedge fries. They were very seasoned and I liked them a lot.\\n\\nBut my salad! It was a very hearty helping of lettuce topped with chicken, tomatoes, onions, corn, beans, jicama (which is a Mexican vegetable, I believe, that has the consistency of somewhere between an apple and a water chestnut, but tastes slightly sweet - it's good!), and cheese. It was tossed around in BBQ sauce and southwestern ranch dressing and then topped with a heaping helping of fried onion straws. It. Was. So. Good. And needless to say, there was no way I was eating the whole thing. It was so big, but oh so delicious! It was so full of flavor, too. It was topped with cilantro and every bite was so delicious. And oh my gosh I love onion straws for some reason. I was very happy after eating this salad. Sometimes when I go out to eat I don't want to get a salad because they can be boring, but this definitely was not. It was filling and so delicious. I'm sure it wasn't all that healthy, but it was worth it. I mean, it was pretty much the only thing I was able to eat all day besides the spring roll appetizer so that's not too bad!\\n\\nWe ate until we could eat no more and I had to get a box for the rest of my salad. My boyfriend managed to clean his plate. I just finished the rest of my salad a little bit ago for dinner and I am full all over again. Two meals!\\n\\nBefore I left the restaurant I stopped at the restroom to find it very clean and well stocked. There were plenty of mirrors and I think about 4 stalls or so. This place is really nice!\\n\\nThe prices weren't too bad, either. They are typical for the area. But I feel like the amount of food served makes this place a value for your money. My salad was easily two very filling meals. And they also looked like they had a very interesting beer selection at the bar. I think they also brew their own beer! I can't wait to try them.

We sat outside and the weather was a perfect set up because their patio is so nice.  Great start so far!  The service was splendid and our waiter did what she could to accommodate my food allergies.  I ordered the 4 course meal for $29 and so did my brother.  It came with Salad, Liver Pate, Ravioli, and Lamb Leg.  I am not the biggest fan of Ravioli and that was the only dish that I did not want to want to eat because sometimes strong cheeses do not taste to appetizing to me....so I asked if there was anything else that I can substitute instead.  The waiter asked the kitchen and they told me that if there are no substitution allow on the prefix menu.  I asked for an exception and was denied.  This was a real downer considering a place of this magnitude could not accommodate such a small request.  Other restaurants have been much more understanding and went above and beyond...not here.   My girlfriend ordered a beet salad, and my brother's girlfriend ordered pasta.  I thought it was just me, but I felt my food was a bit underwhelming and uninspired.  The best thing I had there was the salad.  I've had much better liver pate else where and the only give you 2 crackers to eat with a huge chunk of pate.  I'm not sure what I was supposed to do w/ the rest of the pate? The ravioli then came next and I had to sit there and look at my brother eat it all since I could not substitute it for something else....i mean anything, even if it was just pasta and marinara sauce or some more bread with ketchup...seriously.  Then the Lamb Leg came out...this was the worse course of the night, the lamb was really dry for both of us and not seasoned well at all.  The veggies that came with it were really mundane.  After 1 hit and 3 misses, we opted out of dessert.  We could not waste anymore money here.  My brother everyone agreed that it was one of the worst meals we ever had overall.  We will not be back or recommend.  Be more flexible about your prefix menu, allow substitutions if asked.  You are a first class establishment and you should take your customer's request like one.  Care more about what is going on with your food.  Just because the prefix menu is a bargain for your clients, does not mean that you can serve your clients subpar food.

Thinking this was an established Italian restaurant that is known to serve decent pizza, we thought we'd give it a try.  Besides, how can you mess up basic brunch food?  \\n\\nI'll tell you how, and this is just how Amelia's did it:  1.  Be v-e-r-y slow.  As in, don't serve any food for over 30 minutes (I'm serious);  2.  Be completely inattentive, and fail to offer any explanation as to why a simple omelette and fried egg dish would possibly take more than 1/2 hour, when there are only two guests in the restaurant.  When asked about the delay (after 25 minutes), act annoyed; 3.  Serve the wrong  and unappetizing food, also without explanation.  On a menu with just 5-6 options, you could at least attempt to get two of them right.  \\n\\nShame on you, Amelia's.  Maybe this is a decent place for dinner, but I'll never find out, nor do I care.

We were told to go to the Riptide for good food, but when we parked outside the Riptide and saw the cast of sketchy characters outside smoking, we decided to try Joey D's instead. I wish I had taken my chances on the Riptide. \\n\\nThere was no one in Joey D's, so we took a seat at the bar/counter to watch the TV. Even though the chairs were meant for high top tables, the counter was so high I felt like a little kid at the dinner table. The menu said try their famous lobster roll, so my fiance ordered one, but unfortunately they were out of lobster. So he tries to order a budweiser to wallow in the absence of lobster, but the only beers they had (out of a 6 or so bottled beer selection) was corona or mich ultra. He settled with the corona. \\n\\nSo we ordered dinner - I got a tuna melt with onion rings, my fiance got the spaghetti and meatballs. I will mention at this time, that the same friendly guy who took our order was also cooking in the back. While he was cooking some other cook showed up, but it was confusing if he was just showing up to work now, or on a really long smoke break. If we hadn't been the only people in there service would've definitely been slow. \\n\\nMy tuna melt came and it had fries, not onion rings. The waiter was really nice though and got on it right away and even brought us a few garlic knots to make amends. Well the garlic knots were cold and tough, so didn't really make a difference. My tuna melt was awful, The tuna was cold, and the bread had been lightly toasted and then cheese slapped on so it was more like a tuna sandwich. No other fixins, the cheese was not melted so i just had a few bties & waited for my onion rings. the onion rings were pretty good though, so that night I just had onion rings for dinner. \\n\\nMy fiance said his spaghetti & meat balls were alright. I had a bit of his meatballs though and I thought it was not good. The only positive for this place was the onion rings and the friendly guy behind the counter.

But for me it did fall short in terms of taste.\\n\\nI am not a brownie person per se, but I do love bakeries and I wanted to check this place out because I thought it was a cool concept. They have over 20 varieties of different brownies (which includes blondies) and they have savoury options such as sandwiches and quiches. If I do eat a brownie I definitely want it to come with a nut or some type of savory component to cut out all the sweetness that is typically involved in a brownie, and so I went for the peanut butter brownie (especially since I love peanut butter). The sweet cashier warmed it up for me; I love how they have that option available, it really sets a place apart for me. It was warmed up to just the right temperature, was nice and soft it didn't taste old or anything but the only complaint I have is that it just tasted like sugar. And in their defense, again I'm crazy about brownies but it  really tastes like I was biting into sugar. \\n\\nAnd I hate to say that because the service was great. The girl was super nice and helpful. After talking to her, I did find out that the restaurant is a Brazilian chain (which I was not aware of). On top of that the place was so clean, it was in a nice location (nice and new) and it had a good setup. \\nI don't want to completely write off this place because I did only have one item; maybe some of the other options that do not have as many sweet components (the peanut butter brownie was covered in peanut butter icing in addition to the nuts) will not be as sugary. Therefore I am open to giving this place another shot. And if you do like brownies I would recommend this place because I believe you will find something that you like."},{"name":"Centro Mexican Kitchen","address":"950 Pearl St","city":"Boulder","stars":"4","text":"I liked the sound of the breakfast Latin Kitchen Hash when I heard it in passing one day long long ago (despite not having any idea what it actually was) so  I'd been meaning to try it for breakfast.\\n\\nAnd I finally did.  Ordered it blind, without looking at the ingredients.  Luckily for my tastebuds, it consisted of mostly sweet potatoes, blackened shrimp, fried banana, AND (note that the menu omits this info) tons of spicy-ass peppers.  The peppers were very valuable - they kept the meal from being too sweet.  I'm not a sweet-breakfast person and I needed the kick of serrano to cancel out the sweet potato.  The bananas were fantastic as well, and I'd recommend enjoying them as a side dish rather than mixing them in and making everything even sweeter.  Shrimp wasn't blackened - at all - and I could have stood more of it - but it was quality shrimp.\\n\\n$12 for a breakfast dish is kinda insane, but I was able to get about a meal and a half out of it.  Once you get a drink you're looking at $20+ per person before it's even noon, which makes me uncomfortable, but if you're okay with that... just expect it.\\n\\nI'm going to mostly stay with happy hour (or dinner, on special occasions) when it comes to Centro from now on, but if you're sick of the benedicts, omelettes, scrambles, and skillets that the remainder of Boulder breakfast joints serve up, (and you don't want to wait in line at Lucile's for 7 hours) let Centro break the pattern for you.

I went here with a group of 4 recently and was widely castigated by the group for my choice. The food was at best uninspiring, in a older place with poorly updated ambiance and ok service.\\n\\nWe went during dinner and had some Yelp recommendations. (I try to only go to places that have at least 100 reviews and Yelp four stars. I may have to delve in deeper before making choices.) First, the menu is a typical American-style Chinese restaurant. Although there are large groups of folks who would seem to know the menu, it's a diverse crowd. (There are tables of Chinese families dining in so that was a plus.) However, the age of the menu, both the actual paper and its contents was concerning.\\n\\nWe order a Tsing Tao, that comes out at the end of the meal. (OK a little confusion perhaps.) And then the egg plant and Worshue Duck. Both were tastless and uninspiring. The Worshue Duck was fried duck, but without any flavor. The egg plant had hints of what was proper flavor -- though cooked to a pulp. Both dishes came out very quickly, but not hot, suggesting they had been made previously.\\n\\nThe meal was described by others at the table as disgusting. My stomach was quesy in the restaurant. \\n\\nThe ambiance is old, which is not necessarily a bad thing. The food is just not great. \\n\\nThis is the odd thing: It's packed and highly reviewed. So how to explain that? Most reviews are several years old and may not reflect the food. Also, I'd have to believe that they serve different food to different folks. There's no way that the tables of Chinese families I saw could possibly bring guests with food that poor. (And in tasting the food, I could believe that someone knew how to make them.)\\n\\nThe problem is that my meal was the worst I've had in a very long time.

Doesn't anyone else find that kind of eerie? And the fact that a place like this smatters their walls with reviews in other states (Do I really give a shit what Arizona thinks of your food?) makes my case all the more obvious. I mean, it's one thing to franchise in a state (Whataburger; Beck's Prime); it's an extension of the local mentality and in many ways a source of state pride (all my lame Texas friends that moved to Boston go through withdrawal for the Whataburger).  It's also one thing to just admit you're ultra global (any number of national fast food chains). But to try to give off  the whole  local/underground/homegrown image AND promote the fact that you're stores are written up in the Delaware Observer and Kalamazoo Gazette? Very contradictory.\\n\\nAll this in mind I still gave it a chance. I liked how they give you fresh sliced jalapenos and green peppers for free on the burger, but thats about it.

Remembering we had discussed going to Watershed before, I suggested it for dinner.\\n\\nMaybe the menu we looked at previously was for brunch or a different occasion, but I distinctly remember it being a New Orleans-infused spread, with etouffee and gumbo on the list. The menu on the evening in question was Southern fare.\\n\\nIt was relatively early (maybe 6:30 or 7?) and the dinner crowd had not really begun to arrive yet. The restaurant was mostly empty, and the bar area was barren. The area of the dining room we were seated in included smaller two and four tops with chairs and banquettes. We were seated at the smallest table right next to a rowdy party through the rest of the space was unoccupied. The parties seated immediately after us that were also pairs were sat in booths and roomier tables for some reason?\\n\\nWe were starving, as we'd both come straight from work and ready to order right away. While I understand this is a white tablecloth, finer dining establishment, it took prompting to learn what the specials were for the day, and politely stopping our server several times to place our entire order as he would rush off as we ordered one thing at a time.\\n\\nTo start, we ordered the farmer's cheese fritters, deviled eggs and a salad. Everything was delicious, but the fried cheese plate was a bit artful--the presentation was pretty, but we both found it bizarre that three cheese balls were served on such a large platter with so much garnish.\\n\\nWe both ordered cocktails from the seasonal menu. She ordered a gin spritzer and I ordered a bourbon and shrub concoction. Hers tasted fine (light and fruity), but my cocktail was a bit off? I expected a tart apple-tinged flavor with sourness from the vinegar and some warming spice, but I couldn't draw any of those flavors from it--it was oversweet. Plus it was in a martini glass for some reason.\\n\\nFor the mains we had the pulled pork and the chicken and dumplings. The pork dish was a hefty portion, and filled a large dinner plate to the brim once all the fixings were added in. The meat was well seasoned, but a bit dry. After the fancy presentation of the cheese appetizer, the plating for the pork was incongruous--while I understand the items in question could not be plated beautifully (pulled pork, beans, collards, slaw), it looked slopped onto the plate and ran together as some parts were juicy and others dry. Why not separate dishes for the runnier dishes?\\n\\nThe chicken and dumplings arrived in a large soup bowl and was excellent. The broth was a touch too salty, but the flavors were delicious and everything I could have hoped for. I found that it had a slight coconut flavor, though, which I couldn't shake. Not sure if that was intended or if my taste buds were thrown by some added spice or seasoning. For chicken 'n' dumplings connoisseurs, be aware that this is a clear, not creamy broth.\\n\\nOverall our experience was a bit weird, and the food itself was just ok. I'd like to come back and try the fried chicken one day, and perhaps a dessert, but maybe sit at the bar for those days when I am HUNGRY and ready to chow down."},{"name":"Urban Flats","address":"55 W Church St, Ste 128","city":"Orlando","stars":"3","text":"Wine down is the reason for going here....I haven't eaten at the restaurants before.

The Clover Food Lab truck was there on Sunday and I was able to enjoy a delicious chick pea fritter sandwich!\\n3. It's clean. A lot of times when there are outdoor markets, the ground will often become littered and dirty because of the amount of people passing through. Maybe this is because the times I have been it wasn't too crowded.\\n4. There are little shops nearby and open art studios to check out. Not all the studios are open on Sundays but there are always a few interesting ones to see.\\n\\nOverall, the SOWA open market is a great way to spend a Sunday afternoon.

While our meals were good, I don't think the overall experience justified the price tag.\\n\\nWe wanted to go to Lolita but it had a 45-minute wait, so we decided to walk down Newbury to see where else we could go. Stephi's had no wait and we were quickly seated outside, which was great since it was a nice night.\\n\\nI ordered a Texas Mule, which was somewhat like a much-loved by me Moscow Mule but less strong and more watermelon-y. Not bad, but not worth $13. She ordered sangria which she said was good, but again, I think $13 is steep for a glass of sangria with a lot of ice.\\n\\nI don't eat meat when dining out, so I ordered the Spinach Ricotta Ravioli. The description sounded wonderful and I was excited to try it, however, my order came out wrong and I received a pasta dish with broccoli rabe and sausage. I decided not to send it back because I know it'd just be trashed, and I hate wasting food. It ended up being very good, I just wish I would have gotten what I ordered. My friend ordered the half chicken and said it was really juicy and flavorful.\\n\\nThe service throughout the evening wasn't bad, it just wasn't that good--our meals took a very long time to come out, which is annoying when you're seated at 7:00 and don't eat until 7:30-ish, but our waiter did come out to apologize. Also, I noticed I was charged $21 for my dinner, which was the price of the Ravioli I had ordered, but dish I received was $20. It was only a dollar so I didn't bother saying anything (I'm not that cheap), but it kind of put a bad taste in my mouth. My share of the bill including tip was around $45, which for me is pretty expensive for one drink and a entree I didn't order.

Their manufactured corporate charm is absolutely shameful in comparison to Stauf's, and is absolutely laughable when it comes down to it.  With Luck Bros' standing firmly by it's side, Stauf's stands tall and proud on the plateau of coffee greatness in Columbus. Some may ride Stauf's for having that snooty, too-cool-for-school coffee house feel to it, but an iPod'ed 24 year old with perpetual 5 o'clock shadow and a penchant for all things indie such as myself will rarely ever feel out of place. The dining room is one of the largest I've encountered in the Columbus coffee shop scene, and the music here is markedly phenomenal. Whether it's piped in from a satellite or is being played off one of the barista's iPods is uncertain, but in the half hour I spent here while taking a break from an afternoon bike ride yesterday I heard music from Andrew Bird, Portishead, Burial, and Thom Yorke, to name just a few. \\n\\nAs for the coffee, I opted for a mint iced mocha, which may not have been the most adventurous of choices given that the intention of my visit was originally to test the mettle of this much talked-about Grandview hotspot. Pedestrian or not, it was damn good. Not only that, but it also came out in a fraction of the time it normally takes a Cup O Joe to make a similar drink. I found this to be rather curious, as they are owned by the same company and I assume they share many of the same ingredients. \\n\\nAnother very cool feature that I doubt I'll ever utilize is the extensive retail area in the front of the store. Everything from roasters to grinders to titanium infused travel mugs is on display here, as well as barrels of fresh coffee beans from every corner of the known universe. In other words, this place is truly a coffee nerd's wet dream come true.

I had a friend who was visiting from Australia, who was extremely excited for some good wings and Canadian food, as she is a Canadian and hadn't had Canadian food in over a year. \\n\\nOur servers seemed to be nice and did apologize that our food was taking longer than expected. We didn't really see the restaurant being that busy, the inside looked empty, but the patio was busy. We ordered fish tacos and the wings. When they came out, the fish tacos and the fries were cold, and the wings looked really weathered and shriveled. We mentioned the fries first to our server, who didn't say much, but apologize and say \\"Everyone is really busy back there\\". This stunned us, as we have all worked in the restaurant industry to never say that you are \\"too busy\\" to ensure quality food is served, no matter the wait time. We felt secondary to whoever was getting first class service and food. Finally a second server came and apologized profusely and made sure we got a second round of fries. \\n\\nMy friend who ordered the wings thought she would just suck it up and eat the shriveled wings as she was starving. It wasn't until she came across a less than appetizing wing with a bone cracked and sticking out of it, that she completely lost her appetite. When we showed the server, and asked her for another order, she laughed and said \\"I'm sorry about that, but I guess it reminds you, you are eating chicken.\\" haha what?! I cannot help but laugh at this. We could not believe this kind of response. When someone orders chicken wings, I think we are aware of it being a chicken that we are eating. The stupid comment was not needed, just an apology, and a new order would have been appreciated. Again, working in the hospitality industry, you should never make a guest feel like it is their fault as to why the food your staff has served them is cold or unappetizing.  \\n\\nAt the end of the meal, we waited awhile before we received our bills as our server had said her manager was going to look at the bills, and take care of the food that was cold and of poor quality. Once we finally got our bill, we did not receive any sort of discount, or acknowledgement of the bad food and service. I was not looking for this, but to come to our table and say that your manager is taking care of something, and then they don't is bad service. Shows how much yourself or your manager cared to have our return or referred business again.

I went at lunch and all of the tables were full (there are only about 8-9). \\n\\nA note about allergies - I was eating with someone who is gluten free and they said they did not think the sushi rice was GF, which was unusual, so they brought a bowl of steamed rice for her. Maybe they just weren't sure so they were airing on the side of caution? They also do not have GF soy sauce, so BYOSS if you need that."},{"name":"Austin Java","address":"1206 Pkwy","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"BEST breakfast place in Austin!

My mom and I were in yesterday and it was horrible.\\nFirst we came right at 10 when they open.  We waited in the parking lot until about 10:15.  A server drove in and let us in.  It was all dark and kind of spooky inside.  We walked through the dark and were seated.  We were served tea that tasted good but was more like soup than tea with all the big hunks of leaves in it.\\nThe server told us there would be no carts because of other staff being stuck in traffic.  \\nThis was a bummer because I had invited my mom to lunch because I thought she would enjoy seeing all the food whirling by.\\nWe ordered about 5 plates and they were overly greasy.  One had a hair deep-fried on the tofu plate.  When I told the server I didn't want to eat that plate she was a bit argumentative that there was nothing wrong.  She finally held it up to the light and said ok and took it away.  She said she would take it off.\\nThe bill was high and it seemed like she didn't take it off.\\nThe place is pretty grimy too.  I have a toddler so we were walking around and there is dirt and grease everywhere."},{"name":"Rolling In Thyme & Dough","address":"333 W Hwy 290","city":"Dripping Springs","stars":"4","text":"Truly, my favorite restaurant of all time. If I was to have one last meal, it would be here. The ambiance is everything you would want in a small town bistro, and the food is incredible. The customer service is always so great and the owner Fabienne works so hard and is always so welcoming. To die for drip coffee and always delicious pastries and oatmeal.

But I have to give this place a HUGE negative review for their treatment of locals.  \\nLet me say first that my mother and I were the FIRST customers to walk into this restaurant over 10 years ago. \\nWhen I say to eat at the bar, the waiter asked me for my room number.  I told him I was local, and he said, in order for him to serve me, he had to take a credit card IN ADVANCE , and charge it for $150!!!  All this because I am not a guest???\\nSHAME ON YOU MARRIOTT!!! Its disgusting that you think so little of locals that you do this to people. \\nWell, guess what, you also just ticked off a well known member of the meeting industry.  Not only am I going to share this here, but I'm going to share it with 5,000 members of the meeting industry. \\nWhat a piss poor way to treat people."},{"name":"Toji Korean Grill House","address":"4615 SE Hawthorne Blvd","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"Great place and so fun to take the family.

Perhaps the quality has gone downhill over the years....or maybe I just didn't realize it so much before.  I ordered the vegetable omelet - it was served with the eggs on the bottom, then the veggies and finally topped with American cheese (of all the cheeses to choose from- why???).  I also found the choice of veggies odd- carrots and eggs....hrmmm....My boyfriend ordered the french toast which was made with white bread- with cinnamon on top - instead of mixed in with the batter.  He found the dish rather tasteless and bland.  \\n\\nUnfortunately, I spent the rest of our meal convincing my boyfriend - 'no really, it used to be good back in the day, I swear!'.
