When we informed our server that we'd be using our LS coupon, he informed us that it included a complimentary order of hush puppies when redeemed before 2:00 pm.  He brought those out shortly and, although neither of us is a fan of hush puppies, we tried them and really enjoyed them.  The coffee was hot and good and our server did a fair job of keeping our cups full even though the full house kept him pretty busy.  \\nMy wife chose the veggie omelet (pretty tame choice) while I went for the fish and grits breakfast...fried tilapia with some very tasty grits (prepared just right) and eggs OE.  We savored every bite and spent a very relaxed morning reading the newspaper and catching up on FB and Yelp (WiFi).\\nWhen the check came, I was stunned to see that we had only rung up 2/3 of our coupon allowance.  I decided to save it for a later date (we shall surely return) and paid cash for the great breakfast and service.

Again, our agreement was SERVICE from 5-8pm. No food was served until 7:20 pm when my husband and I were finally given food without an apology from the employees.

He just replied \\"Should I call you when you get back?\\" I said no, I want to talk to you asap. To that, he never again responded. After the honeymoon was over and we were settled back at home I emailed him again requesting the amount owed for having only 60 guests in total and I requested more of a reimbursement on top of that for terrible service and arriving so incredibly late.

Light soup with mild flavors to warm you up.\\n-- Sichuan Thousand Chili Chicken: Yep, a whole bunch of dried chili peppers mixed in with amazingly crispy, fried chicken pieces...like the best popcorn chicken ever. Has a nice zzing to it and mixed with garlic and ginger, which were great to munch on as well.\\n-- Sichuan Broth Braised Fish: Very delicate bites of fish, soft, flavorful, as it's absorbed the broth it's been simmering in.\\n-- Sichuan String Beans: Mixed with stir-fried pork and garlic, this was amazing. We demolished this plate easily.\\n-- Dan Dan Noodles: The hand pulled noodles are a nice touch. You can appreciate the difference as the noodles have a chewy texture and more substance than processed ones. Tossed with peanut sauce and spice, this was a great dish.\\n-- XLB: Pretty thick skin. Broth was OK, but not very rich. Not my favorite compared to other XLB places I've been to.\\n-- Scallion Pancakes: Don't get these. Thick, doughy, greasy. Not good.\\n-- Beef Rolls: Basically, a crispy beef burrito with a sweet glaze inside, hoisin sauce? It was OK, I just like crispy things heh\\n\\nSeems to be a popular spot though, so would expect to wait.

I attempt to always give them my coffee/bakery business because they are locally owned and conveniently located near my apartment in GP. \\n\\nI went in to the shop about a month ago and got one of the best sandwiches I have ever had. It was basically a BLT with turkey and I added avocado. When I went into the shop Monday, 3/24, I told the woman at the counter exactly what I had the last time and how much I loved it and their establishment. I was under the impression that we were on the same page on how to replicate the sandwich, but after I left and was on my way to work, I opened my sandwich box only to find a BLT with turkey bacon and no avocado. I called them to see where things went wrong and the woman on the phone was not even sincere with her apology and acted as if she didn't remember me being there less than 5 minutes beforehand(there were only two people working there at the time and I know it wasn't the other lady). Although I was pretty disappointed, I ate my sandwich because I was hungry and just let the situation go. \\n\\nI am an optimist and believe that people make mistakes so of course I gave them another try today, because yet again I was craving that amazing sandwich. Again I told her exactly, word for word, what I wanted on my sandwich, explained to her what happened the other day and at the end went over again what I wanted. I get home and there is mustard on the tortilla of my wrap. I am a fairly picky person and I am aware of how obnoxious it is because I am in the service industry as well, but I always compensate for my high maintenance and am very patient because I know my orders take extra time. The problem is I do not eat most condiments and they usually completely ruin my appetite. When we first discussed that sandwich all I heard that would be on it that I knew I wouldn't eat was mayo which I asked her to leave off. If she said mustard I did not hear her, but never the less I reiterated that I only wanted turkey, lettuce, tomato, bacon, and avocado on my wrap, nothing else. \\n\\nI find it incredibly aggravating that two times in a row I have purchased food that I did not want and this time will not even eat.

We live five minutes drive from the restaurant, I know because I've driven it myself and I just checked google maps because the manager made me think I was crazy. Being as close as we are it is surprising that the delivery always takes over an hour to get here. Today we ordered online from Foodler and asked for the sauce of the chicken parm sub to be put on the side knowing it would be soggy otherwise. After it was delivered we checked the bag and no sauce. I called the restaurant to tell them this and the manager answered the phone in a rather unpleasant tone, made me wait on hold while she inspected the online order, and after reading the instructions of \\"sauce on the side\\" back to me from the order, proceeded to tell me I lived too far away and the driver wouldn't want to make that trip. 5 minutes away people, I'm serious! But okay, you don't want to bring me my sauce, fine, this dry sandwich is now inedible, ok, I will figure something else out, just give me my money back. Nope. The manager proceeds to tell me that they didn't charge for sauce anyway. Not the point, I can't eat the sandwich! And I'm sure the cost of the sauce is figured into a chicken parm sub anyway. Then she says, you ordered online, you have to call Foodler because they have your money. Really?!?!? So I called Foodler, which I use all the time to order food, they pleasantly listened to my situation and said they needed to reach out to the restaurant. When the nice customer service lady came back on the phone she said the manager was willing to credit $.50 to my card for the sauce. Are you joking?!?! The Foodler lady gave us a credit because she thought this was ridiculous as well and had witnessed first hand how awful this manager is. This manager clearly does not know the meaning of customer service. She is rude, not empathetic and should not be running a business.

It's expensive. But....the selection and overall quality of the food are superb, and if you are not staying at the AK Lodge, it allows you the added bonus of the \\"attraction\\" of touring the hotel and its gorgeous property. I like saying hello to giraffes after dinner! And taking in the creative decor in the public spaces (and the Hidden Mickeys!).  I do not normally like buffets, esp expensive ones, because my stomach cannot consume my money's worth. Here, and being with a 17 year old adventurous male eater, the cost wasn't that much of a problem. 17 year old consumed more than my share plus his. And...I love that he will try most anything. \\n\\nI am a health conscious eater, and there is plenty of choice. The nut encrusted salmon was moist, unlike most salmons sitting under heat lamps. Fantastic! The watermelon rind salad was one I remember from coming here years ago - fresh ginger - yum! The beef roast was just beef roast - until you added the African style condiments, one of which packed quite a punch! The herb roasted chicken was moist as well. Really excellent quality. Didn't care for the gumbo soup, and the peanut soup looked intriguing - but I don't care for peanuts. My husband would have loved it if he had been with us. Alas, he was freezing at home up north....\\n\\nTo make this worthwhile you really have to try new things. If you're not an adventurous eater it may not be worth it for you (they have plenty for the young eater). Stay away from the regular items that you find at other restaurants and make this an experience. I liked the small sizes of the desserts (tartlets that were tiny, so you could have just a taste). The raved about Zebra Domes were too sweet for me, but OMG the passion fruit dome's tartness made me go back for another! \\n\\nWe had great service and conversation with our waiter Paul as we were there fairly late. It's noisy but we had a quiet table. I took away one star only because the cost is indeed so high for the volume of food I consumed.

There is a lot of seating for when it does get busy though. They have a wide selection of donuts you can pick from and each donut is roughly under 2 dollars. I got the original glazed donut and the glazed chocolate cake for 2.50. The glazed donut was fresh which made the dough super soft and it also had the right amount of sugar it wasn't too sweet or too bitter. The glazed chocolate cake didn't even taste like chocolate to begin with and it was really dry and crumbly which made it really messy to eat. My boyfriend got the maple bar and a sprinkled chocolate donut for around 2 dollars. The maple bar wasn't anything special it tasted like an average donut you would get at any other store. The sprinkled chocolate donut also tasted average but it was still good. Overall I think that Krispy Kreme is really overhyped and that if you go you should get the original glazed donut over anything else.

Ok, maybe that's not fair. It looks better than a Bennigan's as far as pub feel goes, but not a WHOLE lot better.\\n\\nAnd the looks are where the magic kinda ends. The bartendress was very distracted and due to that and some issues with the draft beer lines, I waited for no less than 10 minutes for her to pour me a beer. And once I ordered food, I waited for another 5-7 minutes until I saw her ring it in. Yes, there were other people she needed to take care of, but my point here is that she just kept getting side-tracked and losing focus. \\n\\nSo, after waiting for 20 minutes (in a nearly empty place), I finally received my Chicken and Mushroom Pie. It's like a cross between chicken pot pie and shepherd's pie. And this makes me happy, since I don't eat red meat anymore, and I miss me some shepherd's pie!\\n\\nWell, the piped-on potatoes looked great. Nice effect. The problem was that they decided that, instead of filling the boat with stew and then covering that with potatoes, they put a smattering of the stew to barely cover the bottom and heaped massive amounts of potatoes on top. So, I had potatoes. Lots and lots of potatoes. Occasionally upset by the emergence of somewhat decent chicken and veggies in cream gravy. Plus, I find it kinda ridiculous when places still use crappy white mushrooms when I know it's possible to get Cremini's at the same (or sometimes at a cheaper) price.\\n\\nI also paid a little extra to try their Curry Seafood Chowder (soup of that day), which was just okay. Not very thick, decent amount of seafood, and practically NO curry flavor that I could detect. \\n\\nI did what I could and doused the whole plate in Tabasco. I still didn't feel like finishing it. I wanted a shot of Jameson to finish the meal, but they were out of all Irish whiskey. \\n\\nSo, i may go back to see if some of their \\"authentic\\" cuisine (including Jerk chicken and what appears to be an Awesome Blossom takeoff) possibly can redeem my opinion of this place.

This excruciatingly long 2-hour marathon dinner started with a stroll into the Be Our Guest restaurant with the kids.  \\n\\nThere are 2 rooms - the main ballroom and the West Wing - and the inside decor is neat, reminiscent of the castle in Beauty and the Beast.  The ballroom does have a bit of a cafeteria feeling, reminding you that you are in a \\"mass produced fine dining experience\\" which I find to be a weakness of Disney dining in general.\\n\\nWe were initially very excited to sit in the West Wing with the rose, ripped curtains, thunderstorm (with portrait changing from prince to beast every 7 minutes).\\n\\nThe excitement level slowly waned as we were trapped in the castle by our evil waiter (won't tell you his name but it rhymes with \\"leg\\"). He did not cast a spell on us.  He did, however, take our drink order and then talk to the table next to us for 10 minutes about how he ran a 5K once.  The evil waiter then brought our drinks after our food, and in a final evil deed, let our dinners sit for about 20 minutes before we flagged him down for our check.\\n\\nThere is nothing an evil waiter likes more than a captive audience, and he took advantage.  He told us several times that he had tried (all 5!) items on the menu.  His knowledge of wine was exceedingly crappy, but he liked to talk about it.  His tables (all 3!) were subjected to his nonstop yapping and little actual serving.  Oh, and did I mention he ran a 5K once?\\n\\nOver the course of the dinner, we saw the portrait change nearly 20 times.

Not great, but not bad either. \\n\\nThis restaurant is quite peculiar because the d√©cor is rather dark. Dark walls, dark floor, dark furniture, dim lighting...Maybe it's an ode to how dark the jajangmyeon sauce is. IDK. Regardless, it is spacious and clean which is a plus!\\n\\nService additionally is fine. We had no problems getting our order taken! \\n\\nSo the real reason why this is 3 stars is just that, with everything I've ever tried, nothing has ever blown me out of the ballpark. \\n\\nJajangmyeon is good--generous amount of noodles and vegetables hidden within the sauce. The flavor is not too sweet or salty. Beware: this dish can get really messy. The problem I had with it was that the sauce is too watery. I found the consistency not thick enough which I guess is good if you like your sauces slippery, but I prefer something thicker.\\n\\nThe Tangsuyuk was probably the thing that really disappointed me last time I came. Portions are HUGE and are perfect for sharing between five people! However, the tangsuyuk was just flour and sugar. That was literally all the taste in this dish. The meat was fried really well, but the sauce itself was just so nasty. I could literally taste flour when I tasted the sauce which is just a shame. I really recommend going for the spicy version of the tangsuyuk because that tasted infinitely better.\\n\\nOn the other hand, the Yukgaejang was soo much better. The broth was spicy and complex. There's not much vermicelli in this dish which you actually don't miss much of since you'll be full drinking the broth. If I were to come back, the yukgaejang would be the only thing I order probably.\\n\\nOverall, nothing really blows me away, but what I really like is how inexpensive food is here. Most other Korean restaurants are closer to $15 - $20, but Buk Kyung can stay below $12 per person quite easily.

Inexpensive, unpretentious, and exceptionally good. (Ironic that none of the three apply any longer.)\\n\\nIn a \\"bizarre coincidence\\" of \\"unknown origin,\\" the original Legal burnt to the ground during the grand opening of the new, hoity-toity, white linen Legal Seafoods at the Park Plaza, leaving me chuckling every time the hostess would ask \\"smoking or nonsmoking\\" at the new joint.\\n\\nAnyways, at Twin Seafood you'll find no white linen, no hostess, and neither hoity nor toity. You'll find a very friendly host and owner in Justin, who's personality more than makes up for the plastic cutlery and straight-from-the-bottle soft drinks you'll have on one of the 4 bare tables in this tiny spot.\\n\\nOrder at the counter from an array of fresh fish and shellfish - on display in the counter across the room - choose your beverage from the cooler and grab a seat. \\n\\nGiven a choice of Spicy Crab, Haddock, or Clam chowder, I asked Justin which he would serve if he were being judged strictly on one cup of soup. \\"Half haddock, half clam,\\" he replied, I accepted, and shortly thereafter had one of the tastiest bowls of soup I can remember. This cup of soup was as good, if not better, than any soup I've had in the smoking or nonsmoking section of the aforementioned seafood behemoth. My dad opted for the Spicy Crab Corn Chowder and it, to, was quite good.\\n\\nNext up, grilled Tuna, medium rare for me, Salmon for dad, and Coconut Shrimp for mom. All three of us were quite happy with the meal. Theirs came with a salad, mine with rice pilaf, and all three with a thimble full of cole slaw. Good cole slaw... just not much of it. Justin came back with a bottle of malt vinegar and told us to add a shot to the slaw for an extra flavor boost. Nice touch. (Want more slaw, on the plate, not in the little plastic cup!)\\n\\nMy Dad said it was one of the nicest pieces of salmon he's ever had, my tuna was grilled perfectly and seasoned only slightly, allowing the fresh flavor of the fish to shine through. Although the coconut shrimp was not prepared on premises, the shrimp were large, moist, fresh tasting and delicious.\\n\\nTwin no longer serves beer or wine, although when I asked, Justin joked (I think) about rustling up a Coors Light if I really wanted one. I told him I had asked for \\"beer.\\" Be aware that the place really warms up - kind of hot, actually, during the late afternoon when the sun pours in through the west facing windows; some blinds and a better air conditioner would be a nice improvement\\n\\nAll three of us ate very well for about $55.

We were lucky to sit in Belle's dinning room, it's quieter than the other 2 ballrooms and it's surrounded by framed pictures of belle and beasts life together.  It's a pre fixed menu where you get an appetizer, entree and dessert. It feels like you are sitting inside the castle with belle and beast. \\nI ordered the filet, my sister the lamb chops and my mom the pork chops. The appetizers were salad, and cheese plates. Dessert was a trio of small sweet treats. Everything was delicious and totally worth it. \\nHaving dinner reservations gives you the unique experience to meet the beast and take pictures with the master of the castle. This is pretty cool given that he is not out for any other dinning experience but dinner. You will not see belle so just keep that in mind. \\nOnce you are done you can walk around the other dinning rooms such as the grand ballroom where the replica to the movie is uncanny as well as the west wing where you can see the enchanted rose. \\nThis experience was around $300 for 3 of us but the food, ambiance, experience and service was well worth it.

I called the 800 # for Disney and asked for clarification and she said they only have the Beast at dinner, but then corrected herself and said they don't have the Beast at any of the meals.I was still confused because there was a couple yelp reviews in the last two weeks stating people saw the Beast at dinner.\\nAnyway, I proceeded with booking my lunch reservation knowing that we weren't seeing any characters. We had an 11:15 reservation and were told right away to walk in the restaurant.We then proceeded through the doors and were immediately funneled to the right to wait to order food at a kiosk. The wait was only 5 minutes so it was not brutal.We ordered 2 grilled cheese sandwiches for the girls and I ordered a ham and gruyere. The ham & gruyere was ok, although I opened up the sandwich and the amount of ham they put in there only covered half of the bread.I had a taste of the soup that came with the kids' grilled cheese and it was actually good.We ordered 3 masters cupcakes (the grey stuff). The grey stuff basically tasted like a cookies and cream fluff but with no cookie bits.The chocolate cake underneath was actually good.It didn't taste like every cupcake you would buy at a grocery store.It was nice and fluffy.\\nWe had no problem finding a table in the main hall although I encourage checking out the other rooms before choosing a table.One room had a statute of Beauty & the Beast spinning around and another was super dark with thunder and rain,but also had the wilting rose.\\nOverall, it's one of those places you can say you did for the experience but wouldn't go back.Not because it was terrible food, but because you've been there, done that."},{"name":"Sillari's Pizza","address":"97 Medford St","city":"Malden","stars":"4.5","text":"Sillari's quite possibly serves the best pizza in Malden, here's why:\\n\\nThe crust is crunchy.

Although we love Indonesian food, there were none of the standard vegetarian offerings, so we ordered from the Chinese menu. We got crispy spicy tofu, spicy bean sprouts, and szechuan tofu. \\n\\nAll of these are dishes we have had multiple times at multiple restaurants so we certainly had some expectations. None of the dishes were all that good. The crispy spicy tofu was the best among our choices, but it was VERY greasy and did not have nearly enough onions or jalapenos. The spicy bean sprouts reminded me of LaChoy- not at all what I expected. Rather then being a dry stir fry of bean sprouts, onions, peppers, and garlic, they were mixed with carrot shreds and smothered in a white sauce, with a few half slices of jalapeno peppers here and there. We have found that szechuan varies greatly by restaurant, but it definitely was not good at this one. The mushrooms were canned, the tofu was sparse, and the sauce had zero spicy flavor. \\n\\nOverall, it is just-BLAH. We will likely give Lily's a second chance, but we will not be rushing back for seconds."},{"name":"Hokkaido Chinese & Japanese Buffet","address":"5737 W Irlo Bronson Memorial Hwy","city":"Kissimmee","stars":"3.5","text":"This was my first visit the restaurant is between McDonald's and machine gun America at 5737 West Irlo Bronson.

First, the crushed tomatoes with dried pepper that they mix in does not pass for salsa in my book.

Don't get me wrong. In regards to the decor and atmosphere I will happy call it a 5 star experience. The ball room is utterly fantastic. Visions of snowfall and distant mountains through the windows, and gorgeous chandeliers help transform the space to a far away French castle ruled over by the Beast. The West Wing is definitely reminiscent of that in the movie, and it is cozier and quieter than the expansive ball room.\\n\\nWe felt very lucky to have reservations here for dinner ON MY BIRTHDAY! It is exactly what I wanted for my birthday dinner, and I would definitely recommend dining here if you can score a reservation and/or are willing to wait in a long line for lunch. The experience of dining here is well worth it, but I must point out that the food doesn't fully live up to the hype of the most talked about new Disney restaurant. \\n\\nFrench onion soup may seem like a perfect way to cozy up in this beautiful space and behave very French, but please note that it is made with a vegetable broth as opposed to a meat one, and therefore it has VERY little flavor. It was far too mild, in our opinion, and didn't live up to our standards for French onion.\\n\\nMy sister ordered the steak as her entree. Although the steak itself was nicely cooked and tasty, her fries were inedibley salty. I have heard that some of the food can err on the salty side here, but her fries were unforgivably salty. It's a shame.\\n\\nI opted for the pork rack chop. It was super delicious, juicy, and cooked exactly as I had requested. The jus that was served on the side was delicious too, as were the side dishes. I was happy with my meal, but it didn't live up to the standards of some of the nicest (read: Signature) restaurants at Disney. Especially considering the inconsistency of the seasoning, etc.\\n\\nOn top of that, even though our waiter was very nice, he was quite visibly overwhelmed, and even forgot to bring us The Grey Stuff, a special dessert reserved for those celebrating special occasions (which we were). I kindly mentioned it once he hastily dropped off our check and he apologized for forgetting and brought it over to us moments later. It's not a huge deal, but considering I had heard the service here would be top-notch (it's in a castle after all), I was not too impressed by this oversight. \\n\\nAll in all, I think everyone should dine at Be Our Guest at least once. The experience overall is fantastic, the decor is beautiful and quite magical, and the food is pretty good. Although I loved our dinner here overall, I'm not sure I would freak out if I was unable to secure a reservation here again in the future."},{"name":"Mighty Fine Burgers Fries & Shakes","address":"10515 N Mo-Pac Expy, Ste 105","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"Surprise surprise.

I heard that table service was a bit slow, but I always think table service at bars is slow.  I had no problem getting drinks quickly when I went directly to the bar, which is what I would recommend if you are Type A.\\n\\nDrinks:  I and all my companions that evening found the drinks to be more than adequate, nay some even said the Long Islands were a bit TOO adequate and there was probably some carpooling at the end of the night. I partook of some VERY strong margaritas made with my favorite brand of T, by an extremely capable gal in Dorothy braids. Just to detail the level of service here: to make my beverage she hand-muddled the limes, poured in the tequila and her marg mix (which was fresh), shook, asked if I wanted salt, then offered me the drink with a caution of, \\"Please let me know if you like it, I don't add sugar to margaritas (me: As well one should not!) so let me know if you think it's too sour.\\" And waited attentively for my reaction even though the bar was three deep. I thought it was great, though I did ask for a splash of OJ.  Then every time I came back (oh, did I just admit I had multiple of these?), she remembered my preference. A small detail, but cool.\\n\\nDecor:  Very pretty dark room and lovely patio.\\n\\nNote: There's no sign out front, but a painted mural of a guy with a helicopter backpack. It would be nice if there was a small \\"600\\" painted somewhere so you would know you were in the right place right away.

She guaranteed that these were the best Tacos in Columbus. Was she right?  Let's find out!\\n\\nFirst and foremost...no complimentary chips! That is always something I look for when eating Mexican.  Regardless, we ordered a basket along with Guacamole. She said we should have gotten Queso as well but we didn't listen.  We also partook of a pitcher of Margaritas.  The Chips, Guac and Margs were great!  Chips were greasy made so that's a plus. The Guac was creamy and fresh with good flavor and the Ritas were tasty and strong!\\n\\nBut what about the Tacos?  These Tacos were phenomenal!  I had in order of favorite: 1) Shrimp 2) Al Pastor 3) Fish 4) Short Rib While all were excellent, the Shrimp Taco here was one of the very best Tacos I've ever eaten!  The slaw and sauce were out of this world and the shrimp itself was large and just perfect!  The Pastor was very good but not the best Pastor I've had (inside or outside of Columbus.) I was looking for more flavor and a bit more crisp for my liking.  The Fish was above average and very tasty while the Shirt Rib just lacked much flavor at all and required some doctoring up with their Green sauce.  Speaking of, they offer a Green Cilantro based sauce and a spicier Red sauce.  Both are great additions to the Chips/Guac and if you need a bit more flavor.\\n\\nOverall, Bakersfield was a great experience with quick service, quality products and friendly staff. Were they the best Tacos in Columbus?  I'm not sure I'm ready to answer that just yet. However, I will reiterate, the Shrimp Taco was one of the best Tacos I've ever had as stated above.  Was there room for improvement? Sure!

Everything was just normal. It wasn't anything to rave about, but it wasn't bad either. The deviled eggs tasted fine, but I wish there was more of a mustard taste in the filling. I feel a bit partial because I love my personal deviled egg recipe. \\nThe mac and cheese tasted a little bland to me. It was the type of mac&cheese that tastes more of pasta than of cheese. I love my mac to be very cheesy and gooey and thick, but this just missed the mark. \\nI had a taste of their sweet potato souffle, and that was really good! Some sweet potato dishes can be overly sweet, but this was the perfect amount of sweetness. \\n\\nWhat gives it the four stars was the service. Our waitress was very friendly and offered help since it was my first time there.

For example, the last time I went there I had a entree-sized Gorgonzola and Pear salad.  The salad was composed entirely of chopped, unappetizing romaine lettuce, a few gorgonzola crumbles, and three chunks of pear.  The chicken that topped the salad was supposed to be \\"pecan-crusted\\" but honestly, it just tasted like regular breading.  I could not taste or even see anything on the chicken that resembled coarsely chopped pecans.  Also, the price of the salad came in at a whopping $12.50.

We shared a 1/2 meter pizza and easily finished it with 3 people.  The crust is thin and crispy.  The sauce was delicious and the pepperoni was yummy.  It did not take very long for the pizza to get cooked, from what I've heard it only takes a few minutes in the oven because it's so hot in there.  I was told that the pizza dough was basically flour and water, but it tasted way better than I was expecting.  Guess those authentic ingredients (flour flown in from Italy and water is made to match that in Italy) make all the difference.\\n\\nSeeing as how I am dining with food allergies, I was expecting it to be a challenge because I normally have trouble making my requests for my food allergies in the restaurants that are in pavilions that don't natively speak English (so any country other than United Kingdom and Canada).  For example, in China no one there understood what I was asking or even knew to get a chef or manager that could speak English (I don't blame them just an example of how hard it is to eat in some of the countries).  But to my surprise the manager that came out didn't speak English natively but was able to handle my situation and she explained everything clearly on what I could eat and even any types of possible contaminations.  We asked mainly about the pizza (I have been wanting to try the pizza since I heard of this place) but also asked about the pastas and she handled it phenomenally.  They were able to make a 1/2 meter pizza, half with cheese and half without (I've posted a picture of the pizza up).\\n\\nBottom line, the pizza is amazing.  The service is excellent.  I can't wait to go back and try the other food like the pastas."},{"name":"Be Our Guest Restaurant","address":"Magic Kingdom Dr","city":"Orlando","stars":"3.5","text":"Magic Kingdom has so many quick service restaurants but they all kind of blend together in terms of food.

Really neat and \\"magical\\" feature.\\n\\nFood: as I mentioned earlier, Be Our Guest stands out among the quick service options in the Magic Kingdom.  The main reason for this is the food.  Many unique options to choose from but I decided on the roast beef sandwich with fries.  Large portion of beef topped with arugula and a horseradish cream on a really nice roll.  At $13 dollars, this sandwich was worth it as I left full.  To top off the meal my family split the \\"grey stuff\\" cupcake that was very good even though I'm not sure what it is haha. \\n\\nOverall: really nice addition to the dining options in the Magic Kingdom.

I really like the atmosphere, although many of my coworkers find it a bit snobby and unfriendly.

I kind of get an alternative, hipster, gay-friendly vibe from the place, which is similar to my college experience so it makes me feel at home. The food is a little pricey, but if you order smart (soup, quiche), you get a filling meal on the cheaper side. The soups are always changing, but always delicious and come with a delicious piece of homemade focaccia. The food is for the most part consistently good, with some things being stellar and a couple things coming up a little short. I was unimpressed with a cupcake I had there, so I've avoided those. I once got a slice of cake from the refrigerated display case and felt like it tasted a little like the fridge, which was unfortunate, because otherwise it would have been great.

The ingredients are creatively used and fresh. To top it all off, I usually really enjoy the music they are playing.

The food was bland and nothing special at all. I got the Mary and her lamb breakfast sandwich, and that was 9$. Cheese was free. I gave him a 1$ tip because it is a business and he is working. The food is way over priced for what he is trying to do, more business would come about if he lowered his price, because then we could lower our standards. Yolk is on Woodstock right next to this gyro/American food truck. I waited, very anxious to taste the lamb and duck egg with house made pickles and on an English muffin. About 6 minutes later (which is a fast wait time) I got my sandwich and drove home which took about 8 minutes. I got home and unwrapped the goodness, took one bite and wanted to spit it out... I thought maybe it was just a first bite new taste thing, it wasn't. I took a few more bites and immediately wished I had gone to the food truck next door. Egg was cooked all the way through, lamb was not spicy at all. (It's supposed to be a spicy lamb sandwich) and I'm a wuss if I go above hot sauce when I go to Taco Bell.

I will give the staff an A for effort, it was a busy Sunday morning, but they were hammering out orders left and right. Since the place is small, they need to if they want to keep it going.

The location is surprisingly (or perhaps unsurprisingly) a lot nicer, located in a very strip-mall part of Austin rather than nestled in the North Campus neighborhood. The only downside of this is that you miss out on the coeds in their summer dresses. Oh well; it ends well.\\n\\nWe came here on a Friday at 10, and the place was still packed. Instead of waiting, we found a small table on the patio. There were 5 and we expected 2 more to join, so it would've been a tight fit. When our waiter came up, he immediately asked if we would be more comfortable at a bigger table. He even went as far as to ask another party (of 4, seated at a table that could fit 8) whether they would switch. Strangely (or perhaps to be expected), they declined. Maybe they were waiting on others; I quickly forget. Back to the waiter; he was incomparably nice, making small talk and always checking on us. 5 stars for him alone.\\n\\nThe meal was as always, nostalgic and delicious. I went with my standard Migas Enchiladas with Chili Con Carne sauce (a-ma-zing dish, if I say so myself) complemented by 6 or 12 glasses of Mexican Martini (handy tip: ALWAYS upgrade from the house tequila; it will make your nights and mornings so much better).

After learning to write a few Yelp reviews, I'll get down to the nitty gritty of this particular experience (I've been once before a year ago, sans Scoutmob):\\n\\nFood:  The food had promise, but because I chose to mosey on in at almost 3PM on a Sunday, most of my food seemed to be dryed out and reheated.  When I was sat, I was served promptly with a basket of piping fresh cheese bread, garlic toasts, and asked what meats I was interested in.  At the dinner price, you have about 18 options.  After browsing the menu, I selected:  ribeye, bacon wrapped filet, lamb, top sirloin, and chicken drumsticks.\\n\\nThen I quickly realized the above question was because the place was completely empty and I came at suboptimal hours.  Any buffet connosieur will realize that coming at non-optimal serving hours is a death sentence of non-freshness.  This was definitely the case here.\\n\\nI received about a meat every 3-4 minutes, and the service was spot on -- polite and always coming with something, refilling the drinks on time, and nonobtrusive.  Again, I had asked for everything to be served at medium, but I suspect reheating caused this really greasy meat to be served at well-done.  The cuts seamed about Sams Club quality, so I think proper treatment could have elevated it, but it's hard to justify this encounter at around 30 bucks.\\n\\nRibeye: tender.  Filet: dry, bacon gamey due to reheating.  Lamb: nonexistant -- didn't get served it, although I asked for it towards the end.  Top sirloin -- salty:  if you don't want your meats resalted after slicing, be sure to specify (common at these brazilian churriscara's).  Chicken drums -- delicious, and I suspect these were fresh off the grill.\\n\\nThe salad bar had several selections, and seemed to hold up well during off hours.  I sampled the caeser salad with house made dressing, asparagus spears, potato salad, jerusalem salad, and several fresh olives.  Very nice.\\n\\n\\nService:  The people here are awesome and friendly.  This is a solid 4 star service experience.\\n\\nPrice:  It worked out to be fine with Scoutmob and gratuity included.  I had a lot of food.  However, come during a peak hour, as the food wasn't very fresh and without the coupon, not worth the original price.\\n\\nI'll return with a friend with some reservation -- but I'll come back on a Friday at 9PM and hope the place is packed.  Right now, I'm on the edge, as I could save up about 15 more bucks and knock out a dynamite lunch at Fogo.

Before i get to the full story i'd like to highlight the fact that my friends and I speak 3 languages (arabic, french, and english).  after 3 minutes a lady server comes to give us or mexican martinis (at that point we were strictly speaking in arabic) she handed us our drinks, we thanked her (that part was in english), she left. 20 minutes after our initial drinks order not one server came back to our table but then we were surprised to find the manager at our table telling us that \\"our night is over\\" because the other waitress that served us or mexican martinis overheard us say that our server was and i quote \\"a fagotty ass mother f*****\\", first of all we had been speaking arabic the whole night and we did not even talk to our server let alone bad mouth his sexual preference this was purely racist and premeditated, we did not bad mouth our waiter if anything we were too busy conversing in our own topics and neither trudy's nor the people that work there really mattered to us at that point, in all cases i was very quick to tell the manger that we did not say ANY of these things at all, what is bad is the fact that the manager did not even bother to check with us to see if we even said any of these things he just presented us with the bill ordering us to leave, needless to say we were all very disappointed in how things went and i do not deny that i did give him a piece of my mind and i was at that point rightfully upset, to where the manager offered to take our order and stay there. but it was too late we were very offended and decided that the best course of action was to pay for our drinks and just leave. honestly this feels beyond racist we were using a different language and were accused wrongfully i may add of saying things that we would never say not now not ever, all of us like trudy's for the past 4 to 5 years it has been our hang out spot and we have never witnessed something as horrible as what has transpired tonight.

There was no wasabi with the sashimi, (we ordered the sushi, but the waitress was not very good, and didn't' get the order right, but I'm reviewing the food right now, not her) My friends's son was served an overpriced steak salad that consisted of giant undercooked slabs of tough steak plopped on a plate, with bland, unseasoned vegetables served in small bowls on the side. My other friend had a bowl of ramen that was pricey but poorly seasoned, with overcooked noodles. It really stunned us, that every single thing we ordered was bad except the edamame, and the greasy gyoza (my friend's ten year old son liked them, because they were oily. I didn't try them).

Being that we were drinking we also decided to take advantage of there  1/2 price appies.  \\n\\nUnlike the drinks the appies are limited, so while it's $5.50 for any of their martini's you can't order the sliders for half off.  They do; however, have a reasonable selection.  We had the buffalo chicken flatbread and the fried calamari.  The flatbread was good (I'm not a fan of flatbread in general) but the calamari was great. Lightly breaded and they serve both rings and legs. The cocktail sauce is awesome, extra spicy. \\n\\nWe've also been on a Tuesday for their $5 burgers.  This makes for an uber cheap date if you go after 5 p.m but before happy hour ends.  Two drinks, two good sized burgers and an app for less than $30. Hard to do this anymore.  The burgers come with choice of fries or tots but you can swap this out for some of their other sides.

A neighbor & I decided to check out all the hype the other morning. Now I'm not actually a donut person but have been known to enjoy a Voodoo & and Psycho Donut (California version of Voodoo) a time or two.\\n\\nThe interior is stark: lots of white, almost operating room clean, but serene. The donuts are behind pretty glass display cases but there aren't trays of them like in normal donut shops. What you see are a half dozen or so donuts artfully arranged on little white trays. Seating is also a little different. There's a long communal table in the middle of the room, counter seating at the windows, and one small table for two. The folks behind the counter are all super nice and are patient as you Oooo and Ahhh over the displays.\\n\\nThat aforementioned Blueberry Bourbon Basil donut was on display and looked delicious but the Meyer Lemon & Key Lime curd-filled donut caught my attention right away: brioche shell filled with a tart, buttery citrus curd, and dusted all over with powdered sugar. But ouch, $3.75? What sacrifices I don't make for Yelp. Add a small coffee for $3 and voila, $6.75 (actually more when I put a tip in the tip jar) for a small coffee and a one donut. My friend opted for the Cointreau Cr√®me Brulee donut, ($3.75) now THAT was impressive: their signature brioche shell is filled with thick vanilla custard, and then torched-fired by hand to create a crisp, smoky candy shell. A pipette is filled with Cointreau (orange liqueur), that you squeeze into the donut yourself.\\n\\nWill I go back? Probably, if friends or family come to visit and want to see what Blue Star Donuts is all about, it is worth a visit at least once. But at $35 a dozen, I'm not sure if you'll find many Blue Star Donut boxes showing up at work on \\"Donut Day.\\" I did thank the ladies behind the counter as we left for letting us sit for 2 hours over coffee and a donut."},{"name":"Avalon Diner","address":"16106 Marsh Rd","city":"Winter Garden","stars":"4","text":"Nice local breakfast joint.

They have a lunch time bento deal as well until 4pm most days.\\n\\nMy main dish I order is the Udon. Gami has the one of the best and most deluxe udon noodle bowls for under $9! I go for the Chicken Udon - packed full of ender pieces of chicken and topped with veggies, enoki mushrooms, fish tofu, and panko pieces. Lots of flavour infused into the broth and the udon is always chewy and perfectly made. All of this goodness is held in a stone bowl which keeps a lot of the heat, so no cold udon until your last slurp.\\n\\nI enjoy their rolls as well. I recently had their Piggy Roll - fresh ingredients and good flavour and texture combos. Their Grilled Salmon Cheeks are a super good deal too - if they don't sell out first! Lots of soft, tender meat and grilled with lots of good flavour.\\n\\nService is pretty efficient and pleasant considering how busy they can get.

They were nice about it, and gave me two donuts to replace the one Maple Bacon.  \\n\\nI ended up with a Blueberry Cake, Mexican Hot Chocolate, Coffee Coconut Cheesecake and a Cinnamon Vanilla.  The Blueberry Cake is pretty sweet and tastes like Fruit Loops.  It was my favorite of the four.  The Mexican Hot Chocolate is a little dense, but has good flavor and just the right amount of spicy heat.  The Cinnamon Vanilla was the lightest and fluffiest of the four and reminded me of a churro.  My least favorite was the one I thought I would like the most.  The Coffee Coconut Cheesecake sounds like it should be awesome, but the texture was really off and the flavor didn't work at all.  \\n\\nI will return to Blue Star to try the Maple Bacon because it looked amazing, but I'm not as excited to return as I thought I would be."},{"name":"Chin Chin - Howell Mill","address":"1715 Howell Mill Rd, Ste C-16","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3.5","text":"My friend and I came here for lunch and it was great!

Otherwise, the workers were unenthused.\\n\\nThe ingredients looked fresh, albeit not the best grade. ie. the salad were generic leafs, the tangerine isn't the tiny and super sweet kind, and the jalape√±o slices were gigantic. Most of the preparation were mediocre - the scallops weren't well-drained, and the rice was most definitely undercooked and under seasoned.\\n\\nNone of the items were labelled, which would've been fine if a) the workers spoke better English, b) the glass separating you and the worker isn't 7 feet tall and sound-proofing. It's like you're constantly yelling to talk to someone across the glass who doesn't really want to talk to you.\\n\\nWhile some of us are particular in what goes into our poke bowl or are poke connoisseurs so we know what to put in, it would still be nice for a poke shop to come up with some of their own combinations. Every other poke shop I've been to have themed a few bowls and obviously they're tried and true so you've got a taste profile going. This place, nothing. So if you're totally new to poke you might create something kind of weird.\\n\\nOverall, this place is safe to eat (read: not going to make you sick), and it's a convenient location if you work around the area and is on a time crunch.

I went up and got my coffee, but finally had to ask a server why folks who were seated after us had gotten their food before we did.  She acted like I was asking her to give up a kidney and said she'd check on it.  Shortly after that, another server came by with our food and it was cold in some places, lukewarm in others.

We were immediately seated in what I can only describe as the Italian family restaurant that time forgot.  The tables and booths along with paper placemats filled with interesting factoids from the old country were probably there when the place opened. The collection of pressure gauges, copper pots, hot air balloons and other assorted wall decor seemed random but interesting.  The menu offered all of the classic favorites, as well as a few offerings for those that forgot they went out to eat at an Italian restaurant.  So for those still reading this review I appreciate your patience. We ordered the fried ravioli appetizer. It came with 6 ravioli and a cup of the House marinara, nothing to see here folks, keep reading. My wife ordered the pasta sampler, while I decided to try a couple of things that any good Italian restaurant should be able to pull off without too much fuss, the spaghetti with meat sauce and a personal sized pizza with pepperoni, sausage, and onion.  The salads arrived and were nothing fancy but clearly had been assembled by hand, I know this because of the huge browning core found under my pile of lettuce. I'm an eater so that was simply chalked up to human error, removed and prominently left at the edge of the table. It was collected quickly without any commentary. Too bad I had my speech prepared!  Our meals arrived in about 25 minutes, and I immediately noticed the large portion size which made the price tag seem more reasonable, and thrilled me as a rather hearty eater. The spaghetti with meat sauce was just that, MEATY and delicious.  It was better by a wide margin than the pizza. Now I recognize that pizza like hair color preference is a very personal thing so I will just say it had plenty of delicious toppings, a reasonable amount of cheese, way too much corn meal on the bottom of the crust for my liking and was severely lacking sauce.  The pasta sampler my wife had was huge, and judging by her lack of meal time conversation (almost never an issue) and the fact that she took much of it home and finished it today for lunch it was a winner.  So in closing if you want a great Italian meal and are not interested in sitting with the bust of the pope or having to choose between soup or endless salad then by all means give Villa Nova a try, it certainly won't be the worst meal of your life and who knows maybe you will get inspired to start your own copper pot collection."},{"name":"Great Harvest Bread Company","address":"316 Walnut St","city":"Newtonville","stars":"4.5","text":"This place has great paninis and an awesome selection of bread.

You can pick from 3 Beauty & Beast inspired dining rooms. For breakfast I would recommend the middle or one to the right as the left one is just too dark for breakfast.

Since I first moved to Austin it was one of my favorite Tex-Mex places. Mostly because of the people watching and great breakfast foods. Also, like most people I love the cardiac plugging Stuffed Avocado. \\n\\nOver the years that I have been here I have slowly found better, more authentic, more friendly, and faster service in the local Tex-Mex places. The problem is that we have a billion choices and the feeling I get from Trudy's is that they take for granted that we chose to eat at their establishment rather than one of the others. I won't argue that the food is generally tasty. In fact the brunch is great and they have some decent drink specials. It just doesn't make up for poor service, long waits, super loud atmosphere, mediocre (at best) salsa, and overpriced enchiladas.  Not to mention on our last trip when they finally brought us chips and salsa (15 minutes after sitting) that they had maybe ladled enough salsa for 5 or 6 chips. Really? Our party of six is obviously going to need more than that. Then when we got our plate with double rice (no beans) the rice seemed to about the same serving size as the salsa. Just not good enough. \\n\\nIt's sad to say but the food doesn't justify what you have to go through to actually get the food. Slowly, slowly I am drifting away from being a fan and the next time I visit they will have to do something drastic to get me to change my mind.

Thanks Lime for saving the day!\\n\\nVenue: Lime is located right next to the movies in WinterPark. It's a pretty decent size restaurant. A good amount of seating but not tremendous. They have all of their menu options on display above the order counter so you can decide while you wait. I was actually expecting Lime to have table service. They have margaritas, beers and more so it made me think the setting was a little more intimate. I must admit I was a little thrown off. \\n\\nService: The staff was super pleasant and accommodating when I asked for sauces behind the food prep bar. I really like their interaction with their customers. Well trained.\\n\\nFood: We went with the chicken quesadilla and fish tacos. I like the way Lime displays their food. It comes in a little tin food tray and you get tortilla chips with your order - really cute and theme oriented. While waiting for your food you can hit the drink fountain or sauce bar. They have a ton of different salsas.\\n\\nIt took about 10 minutes to get our food. I was a little surprised it took that long for it being so fast-foody. I thought it would have come out much quicker BUT it was hot and tasty. I wouldn't say my quesadilla was full of flavor but it did it's job. I utilized the sauces which helped give it a little zing. I got to sample the grilled fish taco too. I'm not sure how I feel about grilled fish in a taco shell...but it was still ok. \\n\\nOverall: Lime was pretty good. Definitely a commercial Mexican spot. It could use a little more flavor maybe in their meat marinades. Otherwise it was a good experience.

Totally a nonchalant little eatery that has now blown up in a small-nationwide favorite, certainly a dark horse in the fast food world. I believe that if you can make it to a fairly health-conscious, food-loving city such as Austin, you can classify yourself in the big leagues.\\n\\nAlongside their favorite frozen custard or Butterburger, they are pulling out far too many stops for a humble eatery such as your neighborhood burger joint. But this is cool. They are claiming hand-battered cod and one of my favorite non-foods in the world: cheese curds.\\n\\nThis is how you know it isn't just some Texas burger joint. Texans don't typically fry hunks of cheese, pliable enough to hold integrity in the high heat of a deep fryer, encased inside some hey batter, batter.\\n\\nNow, though they don't specifically use meat from one cow (reminiscent of some horror stories from Mickey D's--where you may get upwards of 100 different cattle's bodily intramusculature proteins in one small patty), they do bring in meat from the Midwest. This makes the Butterburger just all the better, simply knowing that you are getting somewhat regionalized meat. That oughta count for something. Along with this, they keep the burger simple, and satisfying. Nothing special, I will note.\\n\\nAll in all, a worthy addition to the burgers found in the ATX, but nothing to write home about.

Although I do not know much about Vietnamese cuisine, I think it's decent choice for something tasty and something that can really fill up your stomach. \\n\\nFor Pho, I ordered the #21 Pho Tai Nam, which is the Rare Beef and Flank Noodle Soup. I thought it was decent overall, the beef flank tasted really well with the Hoisin and Sriracha Sauce mixture I created. I thought they were really generous with the noodles, but I wished they gave a little more beef strips. I thought the Pho here is only slightly better compared to the Pho served in other Vietnamese places in Chinatown. It's still a great choice for a really cold day, especially during the coldest parts of Winter.\\n\\nI also had the #2, Goi Cuon Tom Heo, which are these spring rolls with shrimp and pork inside, and for less than $5, you can have a really tasty and filling snack if you are hungry. The vegetables inside were fresh, and I really liked the peanut sauce they gave me to dip. Shrimp was decent, but the peanut sauce made a tastier difference in the flavor. \\n\\nFor rice dishes, I had the #64, the Com Suon, which is this Grilled Pork Chop with rice. I think this is probably the best version of the dish I had in Boston's Chinatown so far. I don't think I had Vietnamese styled pork chop this tasty since eating at a Vietnamese-Chinese restaurant in Los Angeles almost five years ago. They gave me plenty of meat, and it was really tasty, fairly tender and went well with the rice. The salad was pretty good, the vegetables could use some more freshness and the vinaigrette made a huge difference in the flavor. They also provided soup, another great bonus and another reason why Xinh Xinh's version of the dish is better than New Dong Khanh's version.\\n\\nFor my third visit, I ordered #54 Bun Bo Nuong Cha Gio, which is the Grilled Beef and Fried Spring Rolls with Vermicelli for dinner. I did not think it was worth the extra $.55 compared to the version without it (#49), because there were only two really tiny spring rolls. The noodles were freshly hot, right out of the stove, but needed some flavor. Fortunately, the vinaigrette they provided made a difference in the flavor. The beef was pretty good and tasty. Vegetables were cold and fresh, also tasty with the spearmint and peanut flavors, and even more tastier with the noodles and the vinaigrette. I was decently full after my dinner and felt that I had plenty of energy in my body to take on the rest of the night. I think the Vermicelli dishes are a great alternative to Pho, especially during the warmer months.\\n\\nPrices are very fair. As for service, I though the Pho, the spring rolls, and the Vermicelli dishes came in pretty quick. If you want tea, they serve the tea in a glass, so you may have to be careful when picking up the glass. Overall, I think this is a decent choice for some decent Vietnamese food in Chinatown.  I would definitely come back but I would only order the Pho if it is a really cold day, and I would order the Vermicelli dishes during the warmer months. Keep in mind that this is a somewhat small restaurant, and large parties may have trouble getting a table."},{"name":"Zaxby's Chicken Fingers & Buffalo Wings","address":"1885 N John Young Pkwy","city":"Kissimmee","stars":"3.5","text":"The online ordering service is awful.

I'd never heard a thing about it but it bills itself as \\"East African and Mediterranean\\" cuisine, so we thought it would be up our alley.

(No other customers ever did arrive, by the way, save for someone walking through who seems to live in an apartment above the restaurant...I guess the only way up there is via the dining room??)  The place could use a little work to make it more cozy but we were still comfortable.  \\n\\nI'm a vegetarian and there were plenty of options on the menu for me.  We split a vegetable chipati appetizer.  The grilled bread was delicious and it was stuffed with a vegetable mixture, which was good but I could tell they used that cheap old-school frozen vegetable mix (you know, cubed carrots, peas, and corn) in it, so that made me somewhat less enthusiastic about it.  My entree was sort of average (a spinach and vegetable mix, again frozen) but with delicious basmati-type rice.  My husband had the goat which he said was tasty but with lots of bones. \\n\\nOh, and like another reviewer mentioned, it is CASH ONLY.  This would have been helpful information to know at the beginning of our meal, but luckily there was an ATM in the bar downstairs.\\n\\nAnyway, if the vegetables weren't frozen I would have given this place 4 stars.

Perhaps because they were right - Austinites seem to be flocking to these things, whether or not the vittles are actually worth eating.\\n\\nFortunately, Crepes Mille isn't relying on sassy packaging to carry it for the long haul.  Yes, its Airstream environs are painfully cute, all shiny and silvery, adorned with saucy little Orla Kiely curtains.  But happily, the food that emerges from its retro-adorable interior holds its own.  Jennie C and I shared a \\"pork floss\\" crepe and a \\"special\\" crepe.  The \\"pork floss\\" is actually something I grew up calling \\"rou song\\" - a dried, shredded pork that's very light - as if you'd made very coarse cotton candy out of shredded jerky.  It was mixed with some sort of brown sauce that rehydrated it somewhat, then wrapped in a fantastic, perfectly-prepared French crepe that worked with the pork mixture surprisingly well.  The \\"special\\" crepe was supposed to come with pandan leaves, mango, sticky rice, and chocolate syrup, but I didn't see anything in ours that looked like a pandan leaf (this is after Googling pandan leaves, as I previously had no idea what those were).  I think they may have been out of them when we arrived.  Nevertheless, it was also wonderful, with generous amounts of fragrant, lusciously-ripe mango and delightfully sticky purple rice.  Asian-inspired crepes - who knew?  Crepes Mille did.\\n\\nService was very friendly; we enjoyed chatting with Por (I am not sure whether I spelled her name correctly) and the other folks serving up the crepe deliciousness.  I snapped photos of their menu and hours, which came out terrible but are useful enough that I posted them above.  It's my understanding that they'll be adding a few things to the menu soon (for example, the pork floss isn't on there, and I believe they're adding some kind of brisket crepe, as well).  As for the hours - open until 3 a.m. on Friday and Saturday - woo!\\n\\nThis is one Airstream that deserves to stay in business.

Really no excuse for that - you can go to phil's, p.terry's, mighty fine, and get much better fries - so this is one thing where i'd just start from scratch.  Also, the pricing is a little high - the basic price isn't too bad but the extras are 50cents or a $1 and so if you add bacon and avacado, you just bought a $10 burger. \\n\\nOn the positive: everything else about this place is great. its clean, lots of TVs for sports, great outdoor deck for nice days, and the staff are super friendly.

I am really regretting it. I'll tell you exactly why my experience deserves a two star rating but I apologize in advance for the long winded explanation; it's completely necessary. \\n\\nAs I mentioned briefly, my roommate and I ordered food online through Amazon prime now for delivery. It arrived on time so no complaints there. \\n\\nWe ordered the chicken shawarma sandwich and the Habibi mezza.  Instead, we received the lamb shawarma sandwich and the Habibi mezza. No big deal. If the sandwich was for myself, I would have ordered the lamb anyways. \\n\\nMy order was the Habibi mezza which consists of kafta, lamb and chicken shawarma, falafel, humus, baba ghannouj, tabouli and grape leaves. My order was missing the lamb/chicken shawarma, and the baba ghannouj.  No big deal. Mistakes happen?\\n\\nThe tabouli was great. I enjoyed everything but the kafta. It thought it was overcooked and dry. \\nAt this point, if my experience had ended here, I would give Habibi a solid 3.6 star rating (if that's possible).  However, the experience isn't quite over. \\n\\nDo take note, I'm writing this review at 1:45 AM. I've been up for about an hour with cramping and deep pangs of pain within my bowels. I've been to the restroom twice now and I'm hating life. I haven't eaten anything else this evening so I assume the Habibi mezza was the root to my agony.

Oh yeah, there was bitching involved. I really tried not to make it an issue. Hunger is like a hangover. Every sound, every innocent bystander, is magnified and made harder to handle when you're in the thralls of either one. And the restaurant had a few large parties to contend with. My complaint has little to do with the wait, but the wait didn't help.\\n\\nBecause you don't give hungry bitches an unnecessary amount of attitude. When your customers order three salads and see two on the platter, you don't placate the hunger by answering their (polite) question about the number by pointing at each present salad and counting, \\"One. Two.\\" Thanks for the counting refresher, but that came off as somewhat rude. \\n\\nThe unnecessary attitude surfaced again when the hungry bitches walked to the register to pay and were shortly informed that we should have waited at our table. Since that worked so well while we were waiting on the food. Two bitches paid with their cards, and this bitch had cash for her portion and asked for change. The register handler's response? \\"Are you a customer here?\\" Because I like to waste an hour of my time withering from hunger, being summarily ignored and challenged by servers, all without the intention of paying for food; that must be my motive. \\n\\nWith prior reviews, I've made exceptions for dubious customer service. If the food is good enough, you can excuse someone having a bad day. That wasn't the case here, unfortunately. Past encounters with Ethiopian cuisine have never yielded such pungent spongy bread. While I really liked the mushroom stew and spicy lamb, the flavors of each dish got kind of swallowed by the overbearing sourdough-ness. Also not conducive to enjoying the food? Having an empty water glass despite the roaming servers looking at the glass as if they understand that something needs to happen to it.\\n\\nCertainly the other reviews tell a different story.

The only thing I wouldn't recommend is their avocado eggs benedict--the hollandaise sauce is very lemony and not my favorite.  Since I am a regular I usually go for the complete meal because it has free coffee--on any combo breakfast meal you can substitute the sides for fruit (although their home fries are divine!) and for your toast you can get biscuits or a croissant.

Grainmaker is a wonderful spot. I came here initially because I was meeting up for lunch with a vegan friend, and Grainmaker is extremely vegan- and veggie-friendly. But it's good for us omnivores too! I've been back several times and have enjoyed every bite. I usually get a bowl because rice + protein + veggies is my very favorite lunch combination, and you can build your own bowl or go with one of their premades (both the OG and the Chef Curry are delish, and if grains aren't your thing, you can substitute crushed cauliflower for rice). All the ingredients are super fresh, responsibly & locally sourced, and made in small batches, which makes for an uncommonly high-quality \\"quick bite\\" experience.\\n\\nThey do a lot of takeout (be sure to check out their online ordering ahead option!), but unlike many other lunch places in the area, there's also ample seating, especially if you had upstairs a little before or after the noontime rush.

I'm not a Vancity local, so I wasn't bottle-fed on this joint like some, but that being said, it fits the bill for Caro-friendly eateries in all the ways that matter.\\n\\nLet's start with the food. They have an entire menu, but I think everybody comes here for the steal of a deal: the breakfast special just shy of three dollars. What? Honestly, what can you really get for $2.95 in this city, in this day and age? Well, let me tell you. Forfeit your loose pocket change, and out comes a breakfast that will definitely leave you feeling full. Two eggs, bacon (or sausage, whichever you prefer), potatoes, and two slices of toast with a packet of strawberry jam. All the empty spaces on your plate (and in your tummy) filled in with greasy deliciousness, the perfect meal to warm your belly for under five bucks.\\n\\nThree bucks, big deal, right? There's plenty more cheapo eats to be found in this burg, so what does Bon's have that gives it it's fifth star?\\n\\nUno: All day breakfast. Whoever decided that breakfast should only be served to early birds as a reward for getting up at the crack of dawn should get a smack. I should be able to roll in and order skillet-fried carbs and animal parts, no matter the hour. And strawberry jelly. It kicks raspberry jelly butt eight days a week.\\n\\nDos: Portions. I've said enough on this topic. For a three dollar breakfast, it's legit.\\n\\nTres: Price, price, price. Not only can you get for yourself a tasty meal for the change you found under the couch cushions, unlike a lot of places that start out inexpensive and slowly raise costs as popularity grows, Bon's prices have remained unchanged for years.\\n\\nCuatro: I don't know if everyone will agree with me on this one, but this place has charm, in a ghetto kind of way. Brightly colored walls, movie posters everywhere, graffiti all over the place; it's grotty in a way that gives it a cool, all-kinds-welcome, dive-y, neighborhood hangout sort of feel that I really enjoy.\\n\\nCinco: Lastly, no stomach ache! No matter the price or portion, I DO NOT want to be going down on a toilet at any point in time, ever. With that being said, any greasy breakfast is sure to give you a little indigestion no matter where you go, but the doubled-over, green gills sick that I always feel after eating at IHOP is unacceptable, and I was glad not to relive that memory after eating here.\\n\\nFive shiny stars, five good reasons to give Bon's a visit.

However, I am capable of being swept away by reeeeeeally good ribs, and these aren't it.\\n\\nWe ordered a full rack of Illegal Ribs.  They were slightly overcooked overall - better in the middle, but on the ends there was char everywhere.  At one point I asked Dan, who was trying to cut into something on his plate, \\"is that bone or meat?\\"  Never a question you want to have to ask at a BBQ place.\\n\\nTo me, sauce is very important unless you have the tastiest dry rub on the planet (I have yet to try a dry rub that's tasty enough for the ribs to be eaten sans sauce).  Luckily, the Rib House knows that and offers four different sauces on the side.  We decided to get a plate with all four of them.  Unfortunately, the sauces were all pretty lackluster.  The mild was actually my favorite because it had the most flavor - sweet and with a little kick.  This surprised me because usually I like spicy things.  But the spicier sauces relied solely on hot peppers to get their point across without even bothering with other flavors.  Plus, neither the spicy or the 'fire' was very hot.  Dan, who is wimpy about hot peppers, could slather his ribs top and bottom with spoonfuls of 'fire' sauce without blinking an eye.\\n\\nWe had the fried okra on the side, which was pretty fantastic.  I love okra, and I wish it were more mainstream so I could just buy it in the store whenever I wanted and drop it in the deep fryer, like it was served here.\\n\\nSpeaking of sides, though... all right.  Here comes the patented Hannah Price Rant.  Full slab of ribs = $22.  Wouldn't you think if you spent $22 on lunch, sides would come with it?  It's like going to get a hamburger, paying $12 for it, and then not getting fries with it.  It's like going to get enchiladas for $20, and then not getting beans and rice on the side.  That's just crazy.  Sides don't come with your ridiculously expensive slab of overcooked ribs, so plan your bill accordingly and don't fall out of your chair like I did when the total came to $40 for a shared slab of ribs, a side of okra, and a slice of pie.\\n\\nNext time I crave ribs, I will be happy to wait until I visit Chicago again and eat at Ribs 'n' Bibs - whose $17 full slab comes with fries, slaw, and bread - and whose ribs taste AMAZING every time."},{"name":"Blue Star Donuts","address":"3325 SE Division St, Ste 1","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Don't get me wrong, these donuts are great.

I tried DIY remedies, but I think that I came to dislike 24-hour sessions of KLBJ-FM more than the racoons did! Then I spoke to Don of Rodent Relief. He came out - everything he told me and the answers that he gave seemed like he was knowledgeable, open and honest.\\n\\nI signed the contract with him on April 6th, and it was one of the best decisions I've made in a while! My house was a difficult situation for him (or any exterminator). The house was built in 1959. The maximum height of the attic is less than 3 feet, and there is no plywood down - just frame, sheetrock and insulation, and the entrance is about 11\\" wide. In other words, going up to set traps was not a viable option.\\n\\nDon set traps on the roof and on the ground, and after a few days he caught a raccoon! Unfortunately, raccoons are quite intelligent, and the other one would not go into a trap, no matter what tastiness it was baited with, or were it was placed. He figured out that they were accessing the attic thru the north gable of the roof, and constructed exclusion devices,first on one, then the other gable after we figured out that they were using BOTH of them. A day or two after the second was made, they were all gone, so Don sealed up the gables - problem solved!\\n\\nWhat really impressed me was that, thru no fault of his own, this lasted for almost 6 weeks. Thru it all, he made trips to the house pretty much every day (if not, it was because I told him not to). Don's perseverance thru this amount of time was very professional - not only was he very friendly, he made no complaints whatsoever.\\n\\nIn closing, I can only say that I was VERY impressed with his services and knowledge, and would totally recommend his services if you are having pest issues."},{"name":"Trudy's North Star","address":"8820 Burnet Rd","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"Trudys is my favorite spot on Monday's!

Good way too start your meal. Healthy too!! 4/5\\n\\n- Hu Tieu Kho (Thit): Dry Tossed Noodles (Meat)\\nThis is done perfectly with just the right amount of sauce for you to mix the noodles and the rest of the ingredients, I really like the Grilled Pork and also the crispy pork rind which gives the dish its unique character!\\nThe glass noodles they us is done just right! El dente! I would love to see if they can also provide a choice with Egg Noodles instead! (I may be asking too much here!) 4/5\\n\\n- Pho Hoang: Beef Pho\\nThis is the Pho that introduces me to the World of Pho back in the 80's (yes, I am from the era when Pho is still a novelty ethic food that the rest of the population still don't know even how to pronounce it!).\\nOne sip of the broth and you are transformed back to the original flavour of this shop's most famous items when it was still Pho Hoang! The use of spice will be considered strong in today's Pho scene, but in its own way, this is how it should be, robust and not shy of us of flavours!! Thanks for keeping the family tradition!  In addition, all the beef in the Pho were amazingly tender and flavourful, the Pho noodles were done again el dente! Order it to share so that you can have other dishes!! 5/5\\n\\n- Cha Gio Man: Spring Rolls (Meat)\\nClassic Vietnamese flavour, served with fresh purple shiso, basil, lettuce (wrap it around your fried spring rolls and dip it into the sauce and you have the most flavour explosive appetizer!) and a very very refreshing and tangy dipping sauce! 4/5\\n\\n- Bun Bo Hue: Spicy Beef Noodles\\nYes!! They have Pork Hock in this dish!! That has become a rarity now when you order Bun Bo Hue, most places give up including this, which makes this particular noodles unique. So again thank you for keeping the tradition! Soup is tangy, with all the spices that makes Bun Bo Hue, I just added some extra sliced chilies and I'm in heaven! 4/5\\n\\nOverall, I was expecting a more \\"Fusion\\" type of food, but I am pleasantly surprised that all the dishes had been \\"updates\\" especially with how they are displayed (great selection of plates, bowls, dishes, and bamboo containers!!) but were able to keep the \\"soul\\" intact! \\nI also noticed that one of the owner (brother) is extra attentive and carful with all the aspects of the restaurant; making sure all the table settings were placed properly, making sure all the dishes from the kitchen is presented perfectly etc.  I am very happy to see that such a young restauranteur is so dedicated to his craft!!

The dessert course, a tiramisu, which can be a fairly pedestrian choice at most restaurants, was a delight. Bobby and Danette Stuckey make every guest feel special.

Our reservation was at 11:45 but the service was incredibly slow and we didn't end up leaving until 1:20 pm. \\n\\nI ordered the lamb burger with sweet potato fries. The lamb seemed a bit on the greasy side. I also thought it strange that the server didn't ask me how I wanted my lamb burger cooked but it had a bit of pink in it so it wasn't over cooked. Overall, a decent sandwich but not for the $15 price tag. \\n\\nAs for the service, our waiter was a bit slow. Part of our table received drinks while the others had to ask for their waters. Some of us got napkins and utensils while some had to ask. Not impressive for an upscale steakhouse. \\n\\nLooking back, I didn't see many business people. Mostly couples or ladies meeting up for a girls lunch.

Chez Nous is BORING.  Yes, I said it, BORING.  I went there for the reviews on here and left disappointed.  I've not only made better myself ( especially the mains ) but I've been served better, and had far tastier for MUCH cheaper. I left wondering if what I had was good or was I just wishing it was good so I could justify the price tag.  \\n\\nSo, lets break it down, the starters.  Escargot, well prepared and worth it, salmon rilette, for the price and the taste, I would've preferred two slices of salmon nigiri.  Soup!  This they did very well, both soups were very well made and tasted  how I wish the rest of the meal did.  Mains, I had steak in some sauce with a \\"hint\\" of cognac.  Yeah, hint is right and while the meat was cooked well it was very plain, very, very plain.  My partner had salmon in another sauce, with dill, and again, while prepared well it wasn't the least bit interesting.  Oh and in case you're wondering, their salmon is obviously farm raised as it was so lightly pink as to almost be white.  As for veggies, come on guys a few twigs of asparagus or some haircot vert wouldn't kill you.  But you insult my pocket book with a few thin carrot slices, some deep fried potato puff things and a half of a small tomato with a bit of garlic and olive oil that just happened to fall under a broiler for a bit.  Dessert, oh boy, now here is where we should get some impressiveness, but no.  The custard was the consistency of a cold hard boiled egg with caramel sauce.  The custard itself wasn't flavorful and left it all up to the caramel which itself wasn't that flavorful either.  The chocolate mousse was firm, but may as well have been chocolate folded into cool whip, it wasn't really that interesting nor that good.  Now, the sum total for all of this, with no wine ( and that's another thing, talk about a shallow and over priced wine menu ( and to hell with a $20 cork fee! )) was not only more than it should be, but was far more than completely sensible.  I feel positively FLEECED of my money after going here.  Prix Fixe is under $30/person but not by much and yet I've had a better service experience and much better food PLUS a bottle of wine for damn near half that price per person. \\n\\nSo, my fellow Yelpers, I feel fleeced, bored, and stupefied.  If you think this is good French bistro food then by gods you need a palette check.  This was dull, uninspired and I frankly won't go back.  The food wasn't poor, the service wasn't poor, and the restaurant sure as hell isn't poor ( $8.00 for creme caramel are you serious? ).  But for what I was charged I want some inspiration, interestingness, and a dining experience. This appears to be one of those \\"Austin institutions\\" that people are unwilling to speak out against, so let me be the first.  DON'T BOTHER.\\n\\nAddendum: parking, oh god the awful parking.  On the street, no valet, and no validation for any of the parking garages.

I had such high hopes for this place as everyone seems to absolutely love it.  I'll start with the things I did like. First, the beer was AMAZING and that is an understatement. Usually when I try a flight at a brewery, there are one or two on the menu that aren't up my alley, but there wasn't a beer they served that wasn't off the charts fantastic! Although I didn't see the brewery when I first walked in, I was happy to learn that everything is brewed on site in the basement. It would have added something to the atmosphere to be able to see their facilities, but what comes out of it is proof enough that they take great pride in what they brew, and they are darn good at it! \\nAnother thing I liked were the grilled wings. They are unique, and well done. In fact all the food they serve is high quality. I was disappointed with the pub chips, they look great, but only taste ok. There were many things on the menu, however, that are fantastic. They also change their menu frequently which is quite nice. \\nUnfortunately, that's where the positives end. One might think, great beer, high-quality food, what's the problem? Well my biggest complaint were the out of control gnats. At any given time, there were in excess of 10 flying around our food. Every other bite of food I was swatting away gnats. Chew - swat - chew - swat - chew - swat, swat, swat. It didn't make for an enjoyable time. \\nSecondly, the atmosphere leaves something to be desired. While I know breweries are loud, this one is excessively so. There are many TVs to catch the games, which is nice, but it is cramped, loud, and the servers are very very busy which leads to longer than desired wait times. In addition, like I previously mentioned, the brewery facilities themselves are hidden which makes the entire brewery lose that extra something. \\nIn the end it is just your run of the mill restaurant with some really great brews."},{"name":"Frank's Noodle House - Beaverton","address":"15950 SW Regatta Ln","city":"Beaverton","stars":"3.5","text":"We've eaten here several times in the past few months, and haven't had a bad experience or dish.

Zenbu is so close to my house that I can almost throw a rock with my order wrapped around it from my front door and hit one of the owners in the head.\\n\\n2. I've gotten to know the owners by name and I like them a lot.\\n\\n3. I eat there all the time.\\n\\n4. I gripe about Portland's lack of quality sushi places all the time. On Yelp. And yet when I finally find a place I think is great that happens to be two blocks away, I don't bother to review it.\\n\\nOn the other hand, I've been kinda getting grumpy about reviewing on Yelp for free. Not that I'm the Ernest Hemmingway of business reviewing or anything but I'm a decent writer who usually gets paid to do this sort of thing and lately I'm realizing that I'm just giving it away on this site for nothin'. But Zenbu is exactly why I write reviews on Yelp. Not to help Yelp build a bigger whatever it is they want to build or to help them put together an IPO offering and make a buttload of cash but to do my part to support small businesses of great quality on their road to success. \\n\\nZenbu certainly deserves that. Great, inventive but accessible sushi that is both consistent and surprising on a regular basis at a price that's impossible to beat without putting your health at risk.\\n\\nIf you're looking for fancy, high-status digs with which to impress a date, go elsewhere. When you're in the mood for the best sushi Portland has to offer from two laid-back but efficient fellows in a food cart setting that won't drain your wallet, go to Zenbu and I can guarantee that no matter what you order you'll get what you came for."},{"name":"Blue Star Donuts","address":"3325 SE Division St, Ste 1","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Delicious donuts and wonderful service!

I had some of the Consuelo's \\"famous\\" enchiladas.  Again, they were good, but no better or worse than the tens of other TexMex places in town.  The chips tasted like they came out of a bag--a good bag, but a bag nonetheless.  I didn't care for the salsa, which was a stringy, refrigerated tomatillo-based soupy mix.  I will say that the prices were fair and the portions were large.\\n\\nParking was frustrating--they only have about 10 parking spaces, but according to the server, you can apparently park next door at Upper Crust.  I didn't know that until I was already seated, and even then, I don't know that I would actually park at Upper Crust for fear of getting towed (there no signs at Upper Crust re Consuelo's parking).  The atmosphere was poor, with about 5 small tables in a room smaller than my living room.  It was warm in the room, and it wasn't the kind of place where I wanted to linger.

Especially if you like yeast vs. cake doughnuts, you GOTTA come here! This now makes the list of my go-to places in Portland.\\n\\nTHE WAIT: None on a Sunday afternoon around 4pm. There was a steady stream of people coming in, the seats were mostly full but a table always opened up for anyone who just came in. One couple was in line before us, and the vibe here is so chill - I was taking a long time deciding between everything that looked awesome and I asked if they wanted to go ahead of us. They were just like \\"nah, we're just hanging out\\". \\n\\nTHE SERVICE: The guy at the counter was great. He loves everything about doughnuts and all the flavors here. Of course, that makes him a great enabler, but he didn't mind me agonizing over what to order (and I ended up getting 4 flavors) and was great at explaining what was popular, what were his faves, and what goes into specific doughnuts.\\n\\nTHE COST: $13 total for 4 doughnuts.

What made it stand out so much? The quality of the bacon. On top of, of course, their fantasticly soft, airy, and moist dough. The bacon - wow! - I didn't realize what bad quality bacon toppings have been on other Maple Bacon doughnuts I've tried (those have been stale, dry, hard). This bacon was.. soft! Fresh!

Unfortunately, I couldn't much taste the orange or the cointreau as there was so much else going on! The extra crackle from the caramelized sugar up top was nicely done, the filling was thick but I wished could've been more creamy/smooth.

I endorse.\\nWhat I liked about  Sixty2 on Wharf was the way the menu was set up. There are only a few entrees to chose from, a few appetizers and also some small plates, but that offers enough options for sharing. The wine list included 1.5 glass pours in the $10-13 range as well as an adequate selection of craft beers. The atmosphere was rather rowdy on a Saturday night, though it was mostly a crowd of people closer to my parents' age.\\n\\nThe dishes were hit or miss. The pork belly with a horsradishy cranberry based from the small plates menu was excellent but the veal was rather disappointing. My entree of cod was fantastic but small. The highlight of the meal was the toffee pudding desert..oh my, more please. \\n\\nIn summary, a good option for a dinner in Salem.

Yah, I know I'm weird, but I love pasta!!!!!\\n\\nThe baked pork chops came and they were in two large deep ceramic bowl.  The pork chop was pounded breaded and fried, covered in tomato sauce, and baked with a cheese mix on top.  The pork was really tender and still held up some of the crispiness even under that tomato sauce.  Bravo Dragon Lord, but I gotta say the one with rice that my GF got was actually much better than mine.  Some places bake the pork chop on a bed of plain rice, but this place fried their rice with egg and Green Giants premium blend of vegetables!  I hate frozen vegetables, but in fried rice it's a match in heaven.\\n\\nA large bowl of food plus a drink for 9 tax and tip in is a steal, but like I said I came during the off hours and I think regular price is around 8.50ish before tax.

Very pleasant, helpful and made light conversation while showing us to our seats. The servers were also great, being very upbeat and attentive to all our needs throughout our stay. The patrons were all well dressed, being in business casual or dressier attire. Everyone had larger groups in attendance and most people were laughing or at least appeared happy throughout the stay.\\n\\nFood: We started with the crab stuffed mushrooms which were delicious. They came out rather quick and were not too hot, leaving me to believe that had possibly been pre-prepared, but they were delicious nonetheless. I had the stuffed scrod for my entree and was again pleased with the selection. The fish was cooked just perfectly and stuffed chock full of crab meat. The potatoes were well seasoned and hot and I thought the meal was presented quite well overall. My friend also ordered the prime rib and was very pleased with the dish. Although not the best cut he'd ever had, it was still cooked to request and well seasoned. We finished up with the Chocolate Lava Cake. Typically, this takes 30 mins to prepare, so you have to order it ahead of time. We were fortunate enough (at least I believe) to get one that had been earlier prepared. It was delicious. The cake was rich and moist, the bits of toffee added a sweet topping and then cold ice cream against the warm cake was a delightful mixture. \\n\\nCocktails: I ordered a spicy cucumber cocktail to start with my appetizer and found it to be only half full, for one and also to be strange in the blend between sweet and spicy. Would be better if the pepper were not so overpowering in the drink. Also, maybe work on not spilling half the drink on the walk to the table.  A half empty martini glass is less then exciting. \\n\\nOverall, I would say this was a very good experience.

He's always very friendly and pleasant, and willing to go out of his way to get something for me if it's not out (usually cutting a slice of something off a whole cake if the single piece is out).\\n\\nMy favorite is the dried shredded pork buns, melon buns, and the red bean buns.

The ambiance was nice, not too loud or overwhelming, but my issue lies with the food and the price. I ordered the Chinese Chop Salad which was delicious on its own, but I wish I hadn't ordered chicken with it. First of all, the chicken was an extra $5 because I had absolutely no idea how large a large salad was (it's real big, unless you're sharing or want leftovers order a medium) and the price for protein goes up with each size. However, the chicken was disgusting and looking back at the experience I wish I had had the guts to ask them to refund me for it. It had the texture of boiled chicken (not at all what I was expecting), was seasoned with just some pepper which you couldn't even taste, was COLD, and you could tell it had been cooked in advance and then stored in the refrigerator (it had that second day chicken taste). I was expecting grilled chicken, as that is usually what you get on a salad when you order it with chicken. On top of that, it was just shredded into chunks and laid on the outer rim of the plate. In hindsight I'm glad that it was presented that way so that I didn't have to pick the chicken out, but it was just really bizarre to have a rectangular plate with this giant salad and a chicken \\"border.\\" In total I paid $17.25 for a plate of chopped greens and some terrible chicken. Definitely not worth my money. Maybe if I hadn't added the $5 in chicken I would have considered it worth it.\\n\\nI also want to add that while the personal pizzas that were coming fresh out of the kitchen looked delicious, I would absolutely not recommend ordering a slice from their little pre-cooked pizza window. All of the pizzas looked several hours old (the cheese had gone translucent like it does after it's melted and then cooled, and the other toppings looked dried out)."},{"name":"Panera Bread","address":"299 Harvard St","city":"Brookline","stars":"3","text":"I am writing this review because, as a former employee of the Panera bread at arsenal street, who went on to work with at risk youth and injure my brain in the process, I was unpleasantly surprised at the customer service that I received when I came to order lunch today at this Panera.\\n\\nMy brain injury makes high-pitched noises an issue for me.  Normally Panera is a pleasant, low-key place to be.  Also, having worked in a Panera before, the environment is familiar to me, and I always appreciate the customer service (especially at Arsenal st).  \\n\\nWhen I walked in the door today, the first thing I noticed was this high-pitched noise, that I soon figured out was coming from the toaster behind the cash register by the bakery. It really hurt my head. While plugging my ears, I asked the person at the register, once she called on me, if she could slow the toaster oven down or even turn it off for a little bit (I figured this would at least allow me to order food and leave and then she could turn it back). \\n\\nShe said she didn't hear anything. I informed her that I had a brain injury, that noise, especially high-pitched noises, are an issue for me, and asked if she could just slow it down or turn it off.  Her response was that she didn't know if she was allowed to adjust anything, and so she proceeded to take my order.\\n\\nThat struck a nerve.  Having lived with this brain injury for almost a year now, I am TIRED of the way people don't recognize it as a legitimate issue. People bend over backwards in customer service to accommodate someone in a wheelchair or someone with a visible physical issue. My brain hurts.  It hurts ALL THE TIME.  Im sorry that that means you have to adjust your toaster ovens settings so I can order my food, but I still have to eat too.  I deserved to be able to function in society, and, with just a little help, I can.\\n\\nThe lack of even acknowledging that I had a legitimate issue, was insulting.  In the moment, I brushed it off and said \\"That's okay,\\" but inside I was angry. If that had been me behind the counter, I would have said \\"I'm not sure if I'm allowed to touch this, but I can go ask my manager if you'd like.\\"  Maybe I would have asked if there was anything else I could do to help (side note:  it was shortly after 1 o'clock, and there was only one person in line behind me, and three people at the registers, so it wasn't like I was taking up a ton of time or there was an inability for someone to remedy the small situation).\\n\\nI just would appreciate it, if there was some more training in going the extra mile.  No one in customer service should ever say \\"I don't know,\\" and ignore a customers request.  At least train your people to say, \\"I don't know the answer to that, but let me figure it out.\\"  And then ask follow-up questions to make the customers experience a positive one and accommodate wherever possible.  That's the difference between stinky customer service and customer service that makes the customer feel valued.\\n\\nI would also like to add, that I'm not someone who likes to draw attention to myself. People with injuries often aren't. They don't want other people to have to feel burdened by them. So if someone is asking you to accommodate them and they're not doing it in a rude way, do not insult them by completely ignoring the request that they worked up he courage to voice."},{"name":"Afghan Chopan Restaurant","address":"12888 80th Avenue, Suite 104","city":"Surrey","stars":"4","text":"Excellent food, and authentic flavour.  especially the meet cooked with rice (it just comes when you order the big meal for 2 or family size) as well as minto!"},{"name":"Sweet Carrot","address":"1417 W 5th Ave","city":"Columbus","stars":"4","text":"Sweet Carrot may be my new favorite place in Grandview.

I don't know if it went under new management or what but something has changed for the worse and this place now blows...just take my word for it so you don't put yourself through the pain and frustration that my friends and I did.\\n\\nSo we had 6 people in our party on this occasion. Our waiter was horrendous: we asked several times for more chips, side items, and refills on our drinks and each time it took yelling across the table multiple times for him to understand us and then a wait of about 10 minutes. We were getting frustrated with waiting so long for everything so we decided to leave shortly after our meal to try another bar. Well, needless to say, we waited another 15 minutes to get our check and then we had to split everything ourselves (apparently no waiter at Trudy's has good math skills or half a brain so they make their customers do most the work when the check comes) including the tax. Okay, whatever, that's fine. We gave it back to the waiter to process. He came back (after another 15 min had passed) showing a balance of $50 saying we didn't split the gratuity. Wow, our bad. First of all, we didn't realize the automatic 18% gratuity would be added on a party of 6 (apparently it's parties of 5 and over)...he never mentioned it but come to think of it, that explains a lot on why our service was so bad. He knew he would be getting an automatic great tip just b/c the size of our party so he didn't worry about providing us good service!! Great customer service standard going on here!\\n\\nSo even after calculating the added gratuity into all of our payments, we were still coming up $20 short on the bill...the waiter got the manager involved and the manager tried (note TRIED) to explain it to all of us where the extra $20 was coming from. He kept talking to us like we were idiots and completely in the wrong...somehow I don't think \\"the manager is always right\\" is the saying...or maybe it is at this establishment!!! My husband agreed to pay the additional $20 (even though we still had no idea where it came from or why we owed it) just because at this point it had been 45 min just dealing with the check issues and we were completely ready to get out of this slimy place. On a positive note, I figure $20 was better and cheaper than bailing my husband out of jail for giving the manager a fat lip...it was probably the best decision of the night to just eat the cost and LEAVE this crap hole. DO NOT GO HERE...unless you want to get horrible service, eat mediocre food, and be treated like an idiot....And to give this review even more weight, this is the first negative review I've ever written for a company so you can tell how upset I am about this experience."},{"name":"Paris Baguette","address":"581 Massachusetts Ave","city":"Cambridge","stars":"3.5","text":"We went for the cronuts.

The veggies in the gyro were fresh and better quality than I usually get at food carts.  The lamb had the best spices (cardamom?  nutmeg?).

We tried a handful of other cocktails and mohitos, all of which surpassed expectations.\\nThe food was the biggest surprise for me-I hadn't eaten all day and was very hungry.

The regular afternoon tea is $30, or $35 to take home 50 grams of loose tea of your choice (normally $7).  \\n\\nThe reason why this place gets 5 stars is because while other tea places will refill your teapot with water - Neverland allows you to get a fresh pot each time brewed with new leaves, and you can change your tea each time!  That was seriously the highlight, because nothing sucks more than to be stuck with a pot of tea that you're not too crazy about.

AND - they even offer London Fog latte as part of the \\"neverending tea\\", so you could have this as well!  With the flexibility in trying different teas, the price is still $30 :) \\n\\nAside from that, the atmosphere is super cute, with teacups hanging from the ceiling, cute chairs, mismatched teacups, everything is bright and white with big chandeliers.

If this is true, then why is it time and time again that I keep being disappointed?  Am I expecting too much from a burger joint?  Well, I guess the problem basically lies with spending nearly $15 bucks for a burger, fries and a drink.   It's all about the Washington's baby!  If that much greenery is going to be laid down on the scenery, then I better get a damn good burger.  \\n\\nSadly, in the 5 trips I've taken to Mighty Fine, I've yet to be impressed.  The restaurant itself is kind of cool and since it's owned by the folks from Rudy's BBQ, you can expect to crawl through a small line and hear lots of random yelling from the cooks/servers.  The tables are all laid out in giant picnic style, so expect to sit with strangers and share a conversation or two.  The last time I went, it sounded like the couple next to me were breaking up ---talk about uncomfortable.  Pick a more private place dork!  Anyway, the food is ready and I hear \\"Ronolfo\\" being yelled out.  Not sure why it's difficult to pronounce \\"Rolando,\\" but everyone in Austin always gets it wrong.  I refill my drink at the soda station and heading back I notice that my frikin' fries are all crumbs again.    EVERY TIME I come in here, I get frikin' crumb-fries...what's up?!  I've noticed other Yelpers having the same issue.  Are they supposed to come like this?   I put a few condiments on my burger and it tastes pretty good.  The tomatoes and lettuce are fresh, so is the burger meat.  I just can't find a distinctive or original taste to my burger.  What is the big deal?  Is everyone in this town to whiplashed by Mickey-D's that we think any burger other than that is excellent?  Maybe so, but I've had much better burgers at about half the price.  \\n\\nOverall, I think the burgers are good but just not worth the outlandish price.

I was hoping for a bit more variety, but the bulk of the menu items are pho, fried rice, rice bowls, or vermicelli bowls -- so fairly standard Vietnamese dishes that you can get at most pho places for about half the price.\\n\\nI ordered the spring rolls (Cha Gio) as a starter on the server's recommendation. They were typical spring rolls, but came with basil and lettuce to wrap them in. It wasn't anything special, and the greens didn't really add to the flavour of the dish in my opinion, just made the experience a bit more out of the ordinary.\\n\\nFor dinner I had a vermicelli bowl with tofu (Om Bowl), and it was pretty much what you'd expect except that the sauce wasn't flavourful enough so I ended up leaving most of the vermicelli behind as they were just dry noodles. My friend got the Vietnamese Crepe (Banh Xeo) and enjoyed it. One hiccup in the service was that the main dishes came out well before we were finished our appetizers. I like to have about 10 minutes in between dishes to digest, but we had to finish our appetizer quickly so that the main dishes didn't get cold just sitting on the table. Also, I had asked for a fried rice to take home for later and they brought it to me on a plate, also well before I was leaving. That wasn't a big deal because they boxed it up right away and I could microwave it at home since it had to sit for a while, but this is to say that the service wasn't exceptionally good. \\n\\nThe drinks were the shining point for this place. The drink menu mainly consists of traditional drinks with an Asian twist, and they have some good non-alcoholic options too. I got the Ky Lan Sour, which was a nice twist on a whiskey sour. \\n\\nTo sum it up, the food here isn't anything special and you could probably find better tasting Vietnamese fare for cheaper at a regular pho place.

I also tried the carrot cake donut which was good but again not what I was expecting from a donut. They have several interesting donuts like the fried chicken donut which mixes the sweet and savory experience.

You can't. \\n\\nI'm really sad to write this as my husband and I have been frequent patrons at this restaurant for the past year. I would have normally given them at least 4 stars, but after this week I can only give a 1. I will start off saying their food is good, usually pretty quick, chips and salsa are amazing, and margaritas are on point. It's our spot. We love going to Los P's. However, I've recently become very disappointed in the lack of customer service, especially for a frequent patron. Sunday night I tried to call in a to-go order, but the background noise was so loud they couldn't hear me so I drove by to order to-go. After a 35 minute wait, which was abnormal, the waiter swiped my card and then proceeded to another computer to swipe it again. I pulled up my bank account and told him it already charged but he insisted he had to swipe it again to get the receipt. Needless to say, the next morning I was double charged. I went back that night to get my refund. I was told no one there that night could help me and that I would \\"probably get my money back\\" but to \\"come back in a few days.\\" Literally that was the first answer I got. I had to push to get a manager on the phone, and they called the owner who told me to leave my name and number and come back in 2 nights for the refund. So I did. I came back as he said, even called 2 hours ahead of time to let them know I was coming. And he wasn't there and so they said they could not issue the refund and I'd have to come back again the next night. Again, I had to push to get the owner to do the right thing. They got him on the phone with me and almost made me go to the other location, which I refused to do. He finally authorized them to give me cash back. The very next day, he got the second charge removed from my account and called me back to say it wasn't his fault and asked for the cash to be returned that he gave me the night before. To me, this is just terrible customer service. This will be the 3rd time I have to spend my time going over to their restaurant for an issue that was their fault. If it were me in his position, I would have comped the whole meal. \\n\\nI did not get apologies, only excuses - They had new machines, the owner was called over to the other location (which if that were the case, he had my number and should have called me so I didn't take the time to come that night), they can't just issue a refund because of the books. He denied he told me to come back that night for the refund and it's not his fault. Etc etc. I am disappointed with the lack of customer service the owner sets forth for his establishments to say the least, especially because they know we come there frequently. I said they could give it to me in a gift card- I didn't care! I just couldn't keep coming back night after night begging for them to refund my rightful money that they took. And then the owner had the audacity to call me to get his money back - the first time he reached out to me. The whole situation was handled very unprofessionally. The waitresses seemed to  try to do their best after I kept pushing for a solid answer. I think the waitresses hands were tied. It's the owner who should have a better system in place for customer relations and train his workers how to better handle these types of situations. We will not being going back. Our frequent business was worth $17.84 to the owner I guess. He didn't even seem to see his fault or that he needed to go above and beyond to make it right. I hope he learns from this, but it looks doubtful."},{"name":"Be Our Guest Restaurant","address":"Magic Kingdom Dr","city":"Orlando","stars":"3.5","text":"Went here for lunch and wow - so delicious!

It's domestic, and while it has a harder shell it is much easier to crack with the cracker and the meat comes out way easier. It's a sweet delicate meat and one of my faves. If you are new to crab, try it, is easier to eat than the others. Lot less work and far less common.\\n\\nI like that Joe's gives you a variety of flavors for their pots and buckets, and they don't precut the legs because that ruins the taste and texture.

When you consider that the nearby sandwich franchises charge pretty much the same price, or that the bowl of lettuce at the salad bar will cost you more, you realize that DD Mau is actually fantastic value given the other options in the area.\\n\\nA simple unassuming shop tucked away on Pacific, DD Mau has a trendy, hipster-approved interior and young, friendly staff who are efficient at getting the line-ups of people in and out. Although there is seating inside, most people order their food to go.\\n\\nThe main item on the menu is banh mi. Served on long, skinny baguettes (your choice of white or multigrain, the latter costing $0.50 more), there are two menus to choose from. The regular menu features banh mi for $7 (before tax): lemongrass chicken, the classic with cold cuts, BBQ pork, honey garlic beef, and lemongrass tofu. The second menu features ever-changing specialty banh mi - crispy roast pork, crispy BBQ duck, and in some cases, meatball. Speciality banh mi cost a few dollars more. \\n\\n\\nOn my first visited I ate  the crispy BBQ pork on multigrain, but I found the multigrain too heavy and I wasn't a fan of the flavour of the crispy pork skin. Also, the flavour of the pork and the marinated veggies wasn't a win, despite having enjoyed pork banh mi in the past. However, the real winner on my second and third visits was the lemongrass chicken on white. Sounds bland, sure, but it's a tasty combo. Made with grilled chicken chunks (actual pieces of white and dark meat, not unlike chicken skewers), it's flavoured with sweet chili sauce and served with marinated veggies, cilantro, and jalapeno. The peppers add the spice I crave, while the veggies add the sour notes, which mix rather nicely with the sweet notes of the chicken. I'm a fan.\\n\\nWould I travel from elsewhere in Vancouver just to eat at DD Mau? No, probably not. Would I compare DD Mau to the hole-in-the-wall Vietnamese restaurants in East Van? No. This is a Yaletown banh mi shop, and it must be experienced with this mindset. However, if you find yourself seeking a cheap lunch in Yaletown without compromising on quality, you won't go wrong with a banh mi at DD Mau."},{"name":"O'Charley's Restaurant & Bar","address":"1425 Polaris Pkwy","city":"Columbus","stars":"3","text":"My husband and I have been dining here every other Wednesday for about a year and a half since our son was born. We enjoy the entree salads as well as the free pie Wednesday's! We were upset to find that when we dined this past week our sever informed us that since were were dining with a child and O'Charley's offers free kids meals, that we had to chose whether we wanted free pie or a free kids meal, but that both promotions could not be offered at the same time. While I understand the idea and was shown that it is on the kids menu, I find it absurd that because we are dining with a child we are not offered free pie like other diners. Next time we will be those people and bring our own kids food  so we can get free pie! After speaking to the manager, we were given a free kids meal and our pie to go. Needless to say we didn't ask for it to go, but apparently that was a sign to get out. I think all families with kids should go on Wednesday's for free pie and see how rude it is to decline pie to families with kids who order a kids meal , but offer to the rest...ridiculous...also putting it out there that we have dined here at least 17 times...ordered the same thing, 2 entrees, 2 sodas, 1 kids meal and 1 kids milk(we pay for the milk).

It was topped with a blueberry frosting with some bits of blueberry and a crunch, looked like cereal. Definitely my favorite out of the 3. \\n- Beignets - this was fluffy and doughy on the inside. It was topped with powdered sugar and was just right. \\n- Mexican hot chocolate - this one was a cake donut and topped with a Mexican hot chocolate ganache. This one was a bit on the overly sweet side.\\n-Coffee - just regular cup of joe. Nothing spectacular but still good with the donuts\\n\\nParking is a little tough, especially if it's a busy weekend.

(and the fact that Upper Crust across the street's cheese slices just don't cut it anymore for real pizza lovers).\\n\\nUnfortunately, the regular cheese slices don't hold a torch up to the bar that Angelo held. I really didn't like it that much, and rate it a 3. However, the Sicilian slices, which are prominantly displayed, are a step up. They are actually pretty good, and depending on what kind you get, rate about 3.5-4. \\n\\nThe subs are not bad. The cheese-steaks are not the chopped steak style you see in most places, but more of 'steak'um' style, which are larger pieces of thinly sliced steak, which are a throw-back to the ones I had in highschool, so I had a bias on eating these, and give it 4 stars. \\n\\nWhy do I rate it 4 stars overall? I love the service and the new decor. Unfortunately Angelo left the place a little too 'old school' for Newbury Street (would have looked fine in the North End), but this renovated place is super clean, comfortable, and the owners are just fabulous. They even kept the old original signs as part of the decor, which means they respect tradition, and that alone was good enough for me to decide become a regular again. \\n\\nGreat value, they deliver in the neighborhood, and while they close at 9pm daily (unfortunately), they do push it to 10pm during the summer.\\n\\nNow... if they can just get their regular cheese slices up to par, I'd give them 4.5-5....."},{"name":"Chile Verde","address":"4852 Sawmill Rd","city":"Columbus","stars":"4","text":"At one time I would have said Chile Verde was my favorite restaurant in the city, bar none. It's still up there, but I was torn between four and five stars on this review.\\n\\nThe food itself is typically in a class by itself compared to places like El Vaquero, etc. I highly recommend the BBQ Grilled Fajita Burrito (the sauce is a bit spicy, a bit sweet and a bit smoky), the stacked enchiladas (a newer item - the blue corn option is a must) and any of the combos with tamales and rellenos. The regular salsa is delicious, and on the weekends there are typically featured salsas ranging from tomatillo to mango to black bean and corn.\\n\\nThe key point on the food is - it alone will make you swear off the massive, numbered menus of Las Margaritas, El Vaquero, and every other genericized/Americanized Mexican restaurant in the area.\\n\\nThe drinks are OK for what they are - no beers on tap, and I'm not a huge fan of margaritas, so I'm likely not the perfect target market for their alcohol selection.\\n\\nThe service and experience would have made it five stars easily when my wife and I first started eating there - we are definitely recognized regulars, having gone around once or twice a month for over five years now (almost as long as we've lived in the northwest part of the city). For the first three or four years, the hallmark was consistency - we absolutely never had a bad experience.\\n\\nI suspect that a couple of factors have started to impact that consistency in service: Increased popularity putting strain on the restaurant's capacity, and attention being diverted by opening the Gemini Place location. While service is generally still very good, over the past couple years we've had a handful of \\"just OK\\" experiences (mostly around timing) and one awful experience (wrong/missing orders, timing, refills).\\n\\nTom, the owner, is frequently out and about among the tables and is very helpful and attentive to needs - I'm just concerned about the \\"scalability\\" of the concept (e.g. there's only one Tom, and it's tough to replicate the fantastic core of the wait staff).\\n\\nOverall - still amazing, but with slight concern that it may be trending down on some aspects.\\n\\nOne last note - just from my personal experience, avoid the Dine Originals or other Restaurant Week-type menu features, and stick with regular items or their regular features (any features with chorizo have been amazing)."},{"name":"Thai Passion","address":"620 Congress Ave, Ste 105","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"Prior to eating at Thai Passion, I hadn't eaten a whole lot of Thai food.

My order was the same every week: A super Sonic breakfast burrito combo with no sausage.  I got the tots and a large ice tea with the combo.  The large ice tea raised the combo price a little. Over time I began to dislike the oil the tots were cooked in.  Maybe my personal taste changed, maybe they changed the brand of their cooking oil or maybe they don't change it often enough.  Whatever the reason, the oil gives the tots an unpleasant taste.  The thing that annoyed me enough to stop my Saturday morning trek to Sonic was that every week for my exact same order I was charged a different price.   Granted it was always within about fifteen cents, but that's not the point.  If the cashiers cannot get the price right, how much extra money is Sonic raking in each day? One day I ordered a small tot with the combo even though it comes with a medium size.  The order rang up as $1.00 more then usual.  I asked why and was told that it was because I ordered a small tot.  So, it was $1.00 more for LESS food. Hmmm  I just took the medium tots and threw some away.  I hate to waste food.

This was recommended to me by a lovely friend who came here a few weeks before me. She said it was comparable to other afternoon teas that's offered in the Kits area. After my visit I can say she is correct.\\nThe place had a mix of European and modern kind of atmosphere to it. Like the counter, where they serve the food and etc had a modern vibe to it while the rest of the place is very European with their furniture and decoration.

I believe each one is a different.\\nWe chose the menu that was 30.00 and we got to try unlimited amounts of teas. They make each pot of tea separately so that the tea leaves don't sit in the pot for too long.  Sound pretty awesome right? I also had the buy 1 get 1 free coupon from the entertainment book. So, it made it even more awesome. Even without the coupon I would still come and tried it out. \\nService alone was nothing special at all. They seat you down, take your order and checked up on us a few times. It wasn't busy at all when we went. There was us and 2 other tables being occupied. We did go on a Monday at around 1:30.\\nI would say the afternoon tea set itself filled us both up for a reasonable price. I love the tea variety that they offer. I had the vanilla ice cream flavored one and I loved it. I would recommend it with others who like vanilla flavour and black tea. It's a great combination of both. \\nOverall, I would say it's a place that I would recommend others to try out and I myself will probably go back again someday.

Every time they visit me in Atlanta, they want to go to Fresh to Order.  My 8 year old niece and 3 year old nephew love the fried chicken with mac 'n cheese.

I think I may have just found my new go-to spot for a great, healthy meal.\\n\\nI came to Fresh to Order for dinner tonight after my workout looking for a dinner that was 1) vegetarian and 2) healthy. And Fresh to Order superseded my expectations in every way.\\n\\nThe menu features a variety of vegetarian options from their Black Bean burger (which I've got to try on my next visit) to their salads and even vegetarian sandwiches. I decided to go with the Tomato and Mozzarella panini with Caesar salad as my side. My food came out about 5 mins later and my sandwich was clearly.. made fresh to order! I was expecting a half sandwich, half salad kind of deal but I got a full sized sandwich and hearty portion of salad. Not only was my meal plentiful but it was DELICIOUS! Also on my plate was a small croissant with an icing drizzle that made for a perfect treat after your meal. All of this for less than $9.\\n\\nNot only is the food great but the service is excellent! An employee named Trey provided 5 star service in sharing his personal recommendations as well as later following up to make sure that I was enjoying my meal.

Dooon't bother bringing your luuuunch...sleep a little laaaaate and get uuuusssssss. For real. This happens. It is a delicious haunting rather than a terrifying one.\\n\\nThe appetizer Wonton Soup is the best i've ever had. I'm a sucker for a good dumpling/bun/gyoza/wonton...i can't resist the good ones. You could say my life is what happens in between finding perfect versions of the aforementioned stuffed starches. This soup, despite being an appetizer, has a lovely broth with slices of chicken, sizzled garlic, cilantro and i think a bit of lemongrass. The wontons are fairly plentiful, and the filling is wondrous. It really is good...but i really only get it so i don't feel like a giant pig and order two servings of the spring rolls.\\n\\nNow let's get down to the really important bit - the Grilled Beef Fresh Springrolls. Oh. My. Gods. The grilled beef is effing amazing. I'm really picky about meat - i am morally opposed to grisly, flavorless beef and pork. I already feel bad about eating them - so they might as well be mind-shatteringly delicious when i do. So the beef is marinated in some gorgeous sauce, lovingly grilled, and the rolls themselves are like lovely backup singers, amplifying the magic. The fish sauce that comes with it is very nice - but becomes downright drinkable/bathe-able with the addition of a healthy glurg of chili sauce. \\n\\nThe other thing i got i don't really count - i believe it was a Rare Beef Super Spicy Pho or something or another...but i was trying to be a bit adventurous that day and get something new for once. This pho was ok. Heck, it might have been amazing, but it wasn't my beloved. I went into it expecting not to love it, but i really did like it more than i thought i would. So that's something right there. Sometimes it is hard to strike up a good balance between fiery hot and still tasty, and they managed it - but it was a little bit greasy. So my complaint isn 't exactly a complaint. It just wasn't my magic Spring Roll level of lovin'. Can't fault them for that. \\n\\nThe staff is always super nice, and have my order ready to rock when i get there.

Our server Isi asked for our drink orders, just water until we had enough time to look at their drinks, and he told us he would get us the chef. After a few minutes he came back took our order and realized the chef had not visited us yet, and went to get him. The Chef, Greg, was amazing! He walked us though the entire line and broke down everything that could be devoured and the things to avoid. He was absolutely AMAZING. Several times during the meal, our waters or alcoholic beverages ran out and Isi did not promptly refill water or ever come by to see if we wanted more to drink. Isi was probably one of the worst servers I have ever had and I could tell he did not want to be there.\\n \\nThe Food- I was not impressed with the food. I enjoyed the Pork Shoulder, Spice-crusted Beef Sirloin (I had to specify I wanted Medium Rare because a lot looked over cooked), the Broccoli and the Zebra Domes so that was basically all I ate other than fresh fruit. For the price, I was not impressed and would not recommend dinner. but it seems as if most people on here really liked their breakfast.\\n\\nOver all I will not return for dinner again but Greg was the highlight of the experience.

I wish I hadn't.  All of a sudden I felt like one of those morning show hosts who takes a bite of something terrible and has to be polite about it before they cut to commercial break.  All I could muster up was a slight head nod and a \\"hmmm\\" as I frantically searched for something else to take the taste of dank basement air away.\\n  \\nI pointed to the Breakfast in Bed (coffee/caramel ice cream with Cinnamon Toast Crunch cereal pieces) hoping for a better outcome.  It tasted delicious but I couldn't go for the al dente bits of cereal.  Before I could ask to sample the Sweet Potato Waffle Cookie I noticed that there were now seven or eight customers in line behind me.  One had her arms crossed and was tapping her foot.  \\n\\nThat was my cue to order so I went with a scoop of Vanilla with toppings.

All of the \\"About Us\\" and \\"About the Chef\\" text really makes it feel like a pretentious sort of place. Perhaps our experience at Absinthe previously may have added to that sense. To my surprise, Brick & Fire was not pretentious at all. It looked and felt like an old pizzeria that had been given a fresh coat of paint in an attempt to make it feel like more of an Italian restaurant. The kitchen is open like most pizzerias, and there is a drink fountain along the wall next to the bathrooms, and there are children's coloring pages hanging on the wall - but the decor and lighting feel like they're trying to make it a little more romantic.\\n\\nWe joined another couple who ordered a bruschetta appetizer while we ordered the tomato caprese salad. They loved the bruschetta which was piled high. Our caprese was tasty, though we were a little surprised at the tiny balls of mozzarella. They were fresh and delicious, but hardly enough to get a bit with each tomato slice.\\n\\nFor our entrees, we ordered a greek pizza, a four meat pizza and a white pizza. It was thin, light and garlicy - without too much grease. We all took home leftovers. Each personal pizza is enough for two reasonably sized meals. \\n\\nPersonally, I'm not a big fan of how they offer and serve pizzas. It's like California Pizza Kitchen - you can't just get a slice or two. You have to order an entire personal pizza (which is more than a meal), or a large pizza. Sure, you can bring home leftovers, but sometimes you don't want to. Prices were cheaper than CPK, and the quality better, but I still felt like the dinner was a little overpriced.\\n\\nOur waiter was friendly and attentive. Drinks were constantly being refilled, and without being asked, he brought a water to our friend who had declined another beer. Despite being almost closing time, no one seemed put off by new guests arriving.

I don't think one could get full from just one HH item, but probably 2-3. Average cost however is 3-4 dollars. Since my fiance and I like to go all out big, we ordered nearly one of everything on the menu, skipping several regular samplers such as stuffed grape leaves, falafel, etc.\\n\\nFirst round was our spinach lentil soup- very hearty, good sampling, and great flavors. I think it was 1.99. My salad came out, and the dressing was very fresh, greens in crisp condition, and plate size good. Brian ordered the hummus with fresh Pita, and I really liked the hummus. \\n\\nBefore the other rounds of noms came out, the owner/manager came out, and brought our drinks- I had a vodka with fresh peach, Brian had a strawberry lemonaide with booze... the latter, could get anyone in trouble. Tastes like pure candy, very good. My drink did dabble with tasting slight burn of cheap booze, but the fresh peach offset that very well. \\n\\nWe then had our little seared lamb plate, (The dish name escapes me) along with the chicken. Very moist, very flavorful. We had a lentil and rice dish brought out, I don't think I would order that one- I felt like that was missing something to find it intriguing.  Our lamb skewer, and then our seared tuna skewer came out- and those were a great finisher to our sampling adventure. \\n\\nFor 3 drinks, all that yummy food, and very warm, welcoming service even during a stressful time with traffic from the parade: 50 dollars.

Not exactly brunch music, and it was pretty loud for only having a total of 6 guests in the entire restaurant, but whatever.  \\n\\nWe noticed right away that the brunch menu was different than it was online, since they didn't actually offer pizzas or flatbread during brunch. Mimosas were actually $2, not $1 as they were advertised on Yelp. I ordered the quiche, which was more crust than filling and slightly bland because of that. The arugula salad it came with was fantastic, but a dish shouldn't really be known for it's side salad. I ordered some bacon and it was tasty and crispy, but really greasy. Boyfriend had the three eggs plate. The toast it came with was more like slightly grilled bread. We asked for some jelly to accompany the grilled bread, but they said they didn't have any. Our waitress was nice, but I felt like the service was a little slow for how few patrons were in the restaurant.

The $5 cocktails were a steal.  The Nasturtium made with Dolin blanc vermouth, Domaine de Canton ginger liqueur, Bonal Gentian-Quina, and lemon peel was sweet but interesting, with a little bit of a bite.  The Bourbon Renewal was a stronger, more straightforward drink, with Maker's Mark, lemon, cassis, and bitters.  Both were well-constructed cocktails that I wouldn't have complained about for double the price.\\n\\nI will gripe about the food, though.  It wasn't bad, but I felt, improbably, that I was ripped off by a happy hour.  The $3 fried chickpeas were nice, with a dried popcorn-like appeal.  The daily charcuterie, though, was not even worth the $5.  The meat portion of the board consisted entirely of five thin rounds of finocchiona.  The rest was just baguette, pickled shallot, cornichon, and mustard.  Granted, the five little slices of meat were good, as were the accompaniments, but the board felt a little ridiculous.

On the one hand it's great to see that they have so many different flavors. It's even greater to see that they have some pretty unique toppings.

They're like passionfruit juice in a little cellulose skin that burst when you bite into them like a gusher. Super fun. The taste gets kind of weird if you chew too many of the skins, but a great idea for a yogurt topping. I'd previously only seen it at boba (bubble tea) shops.\\n\\nWhat bothers me though is the price. So many places in California will sell for 32 cents/oz and so I know these guys are just capitalizing on the lack of competition here in Oregon. That's the way it is I guess.

Gosh, what could be better than three none-productive-paid-hours spent stuffing your face with high end cuisine,decadent sweets and premium coffee?? Not much, honey!! With a table for seven, most of us ordered the fillet Mignon ( a fatty, but good enough to hit the spot). One co-worker had the mushroom crusted tenderloin with pasta, unfortunately, before we leave the restaurant, she became sick. We suspect the mushroom crust was not edible after all, perhaps old. I have been pretty good to stay on my diet for the past eight months, so I opted to try the grilled salmon; a la cart!  Goat cheese pasta and cedar smoked grilled salmon. When our orders arrived they brought me a teriyaki glazed salmon, well as good as it looked and smelt, I could not eat it. So, I had to wait another 20-min for them to prepare another one, fresh and plain. By the time it was ready, I was full from the crisp house salad with homemade vinaigrette  and the goat cheese veggie pasta! I must say, when I took it home and reheated the salmon, I was very pleased with the flaky texture and  cedar smoked flavor, I actually enjoyed it cold! Now back to the lunch...we tried EVERYTHING on the desert menu, and they were  ALL GOOOOOOD!  You will have to look them up, but my favorite was the baked chocolate cookie with hot fudge...mmmmmm! Accompanied by a fresh cup of breakfast blend coffee, I was on cloud nine! I would probably only recommend this place for sweets and coffee.

Unfortunately, they do not do a spicy veg broth, but despair not - their heavenly spicy paste can be ordered (one bowl, or two, or three...) to add to the default broth to give it a kick, which adds to the already fantastic flavor.\\n\\nTrue story, I came to Happy Lamb once with my partner and his coworkers, and as the only vegetarian, ended up sharing my broth with everyone at the table because they abandoned their pots to take large helpings from mine after tasting the veg broth with spicy paste!\\n\\nThe last time I was here, I forgot my card in the little folder after signing the bill, and the staff kindly held onto it until we could go get it."},{"name":"Ah-Ma's Taiwanese Kitchen","address":"931 Monroe Dr, Ste A-108","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Never tried Taiwanese food, and I've been missing out.

If you choose dine-in, after you put in your order you can grab a seat and an employee will bring out the food to you.\\n\\nIf you self-order and choose the take-out option, I guess you just kind of stand around awkwardly while waiting for your food. They do have a computer screen showing which orders they're fulfilling, but it's only at the pickup station, so it's not very helpful.\\n\\nI'm not sure if the self-ordering is supposed to streamline things, because it seemed very hectic. You do have the option of ordering through a person, but the person who attends the cash register wasn't there half the time.\\n\\nMake sure you take inventory after you get your food, because for the 5-10 mins I was waiting for my food, I saw multiple people come up and say they were missing things. I'm so glad I did, because when I received my order and checked it, I realized they didn't give me the Sriracha Mac sauce I ordered, but instead gave me Sweet and Sour sauce.\\n\\nWhen I finally got someone's attention, before I could tell them that they gave me the wrong sauce, she said, \\"I don't have Mac Sauce.\\" This is really annoying, because if they knew they didn't have it, they can tell me and then ask me what sauce I'd prefer instead. But rather, their employee took the lazy way out and just gave me a different sauce and hoped that I wouldn't notice. I told her she should have told me that they didn't have the sauce I wanted. She didn't offer to give me a different sauce and just took the Sweet and Sour sauce away. If you ask me, it seems kind of racist to just replace Sriracha Mac sauce with Sweet and Sour. Just because they're both Asian inspired doesn't mean they're interchangeable.\\n\\nBtw, this McDonald's does not have free kiddy cones with purchase. If they do, it's a mystery to the employees.

Their customer service usually sucks like they can't handle big parties (everyone in your party has to be there before you get seated and one time they had to seat our large party at two different tables because they couldn't figure their shit out). Since I'm aware of the customer service issue, I called ahead to see if they would be able to seat a party of 16. They said yes, just call the day of and let us know what time you are coming in, and we can place you ahead on the wait list. (They put you first on the wait list once you arrive). So I called at 9 am on Saturday and let them know we would be coming in at 11 am with a party of 16. We waited for 50 minutes before a table was ready, but since we waited so long, the manager bought us some queso which was AWESOME and never happens!! My 4 year old daughter ordered the cheese quesadilla which comes with beans and rice and most of her cousins ordered grilled cheese which comes with french fries. When she saw that everyone else got french fries, she started to throw a fit saying that she wanted some, so I asked the waiter for a side order of fries. They brought them out, and actually comped it from my check just to make our day better, or maybe because she did want the fries and not the beans and rice? I'm not sure why but it was amazing!

Drelyse is inconsistent. That bothers me. When it's good, it's spot-on. And when it isn't... well.\\n\\nThe Boy and I returned to Drelyse after a month. I don't live in Columbus so I was pretty excited about our pilgrimage. I called in advance to check that they'd be open when we arrived, and the person who answered the phone said \\"Yes of course\\" and seemed bemused and slightly indignant. I explained that the last time I'd tried to come by, they had closed their kitchen--it was an hour earlier than their supposed closing time. He retorted that that must have been a Sunday; I said no, it was a Thursday evening, but no matter, I was on my way. But he wouldn't let it go, and kept talking about how I must have been wrong. I kept saying, \\"Okay, no worries,\\" but no dice.\\n\\nWe arrived at the restaurant. The TV was on and really loud; there were maybe two other patrons there. It made talking difficult. Admittedly, eventually we asked gently whether the TV could be turned down a tad and they did. So that's good.\\n\\nWe ordered quite a lot of food--including our favorites, the vittambua and the goat stew. I asked for my food not to be too spicy.\\n\\nThe vittambua came out. Not very good. I was so disappointed; I rarely eat sugar (except to eat Jeni's ice cream; omg) and when I do, it has to be worth it (have I already said Jeni's? Jeni's!) The vittambua wasn't. Fine. Whatever.\\n\\nThe food comes out. I start eating. I bite into chilis. The food is spicy. The dude swings by to ask how things are and I say this is too spicy. You know what he does? He starts talking. \\"Oh, no, this is not spicy! It can't be. I told the kitchen.\\" I said, \\"Look, I just bit into chilis.\\" He said, \\"There are no chilis in there!\\"\\n\\nOh my god. Just say \\"oh no, so sorry\\" and take it back.\\n\\nNope. He leans over and looks at my plate and says, \\"Oh, it must the *salad* that's spicy--that has chilis in it sometimes. But she [presumably a cook] picked the chilis out.\\" Oh. So now you admit that there are chilis in the dish. And you're telling me it was made with chilis that someone picked out by hand, and not effectively. Well, that's appetizing.\\n\\nIt was just a bit much for me and I wasn't in the mood to confront, so I said, \\"Don't worry about it,\\" and turned back to my food. But, as with the phone incident, our man wasn't done. He walked away still saying, \\"But there are no chilis in the goat stew. I told the kitchen...\\"\\n\\nI was relieved when he went away. For a second. Because then he came back! And he said, \\"But Indians eat spicy! You don't eat spicy? You Indian, right? Man, Indian food is so spicy. They really like their spicy!\\"\\n\\nNow, here's what. I'm as American as I am Indian. I can handle more spice than many and less than others. Indian cooking varies a lot and it isn't all hot. And none of this matters because I asked for something non-spicy, and you brought me something spicy, then denied that it could be your mistake and insisted that I was wrong, and then you return to basically be completely insulting (and ignorant).\\n\\nThe Boy placed a hand discreetly on my knee, and I closed my mouth instead of telling him what I thought. I picked around my meal as best I could; we finished and headed out.\\n\\nHere's the thing. I like good food. I am totally fine with a hole-in-the-wall. I can even make peace with slow or forgetful service. But I have a hard time when there is disrespect involved, and I felt that I was disrespected. I don't know that I want to go back. I might--who knows, the food might be good again--and the dude might leave me the f*ck alone. \\n\\nThe Boy, by the way, got very different treatment. He's Nordic-looking, so the dude assumed he didn't know how to eat with his hand. That's not unfair. The Boy demonstrated and the the dude was delighted, clapping him on the shoulder and extolling his praises. And his food was fine. And my food wasn't bad at all; it was quite yummy, only it was f*ckall spicy and I had specifically--well, you know that story.\\n\\nSo there we are. Come on, Drelyse. Get your act together.

Plus, this place gives you a LOT of opportunity to customize how you want your burger. \\n\\nI ordered the turkey burger with swiss cheese on wheat bread. After you order and pay at the counter, they give you a pager to let you know when your food is ready for pickup. Once it's ready, of course the pager will light up and buzz, you go to the counter and pickup your tray of an undressed burger open faced. They have a \\"salad\\" bar or toppings bar where they have fresh romaine lettuce, iceburg lettuce, tomatoes, pickles, onions etc. and they have a condiment section that has about 6-8 sauces you can put onto your burger. If you ordered a combo or french fries on the side, they also have a seasoning \\"rack\\" that is in the same area where you'll pick up your burger. Seasoning rack has a variety of flavors that you can put on your fries (or anything you desire really). This is what I love about the place. \\n\\nAnyways, once you've picked all your toppings into your burger, you can fold it and start chowing down on your delicacy. They also serve custards and milkshakes, but I haven't had the craving to get something heavy like that. We also got a bacon cheeseburger and it was just as amazing, if not more.

As a two sugars and three creams in my coffee gal, the fact that I could happily drink this cup of joe without any adulterations was amazing.\\n\\nTomato Avocado Wrap: Creamy, lemony packed solid with amazing fresh flavor. I would walk there every day for one of these if I could afford it. \\n\\nGrant Park Pocket: I've only had this for breakfast but if you're like me and loved Hot Pockets as a kid then you will totally get what I'm about to say.

It was hiding behind the fruit, as if it were ashamed of itself, which it should have been as it was a very stiff, extremely sweet little blob that had been overworked until all the freshness of the cream and the tartness of the lemon and lime peels mixed in were obscured.

Six customers ahead of me walked out the door without buying anything, and I was the seventh.\\n\\nThis is indicative of poor management. If you're going to be open another 9 hours that day, good planning and execution of inventory means you take the time to make enough to satisfy demand for the day, including a meaningful analysis of the demand for different options. Then, you won't be seeing sales walk out the door. By my computations, they lost at least $50 in top-line revenue in the five minutes that it took for the seven of us to decline to purchase their two remaining flavors.

But the truth is, Bakersfield is actually pretty fairly priced, especially if you don't go in to get totally drunk in the process. The tacos are a little bit more expensive than I would normally like to pay, but they are a little bit fancier than just your average taco.\\n\\nThe real selling point for me was the torta, in part because I feel like a torta is a solid meal-unto-itself. Their torta doesn't disappoint: it's nice and hearty, with some spice that gives it flavor, but not so much so that it will drive other people away because of the heat. The short rib was the one I went with, and it didn't disappoint. \\n\\nTo be sure, they don't give you a ton of food either. People who are used to Mexican places that give you a day's worth of food at a single meal will likely be disappointed or at least confused by this place. As for the alcohol, it's fairly priced too. Decent selection, not too heavily marked up.\\n\\nAnd I'm not somebody who usually invests a lot in the decor or atmosphere of a place, but something about Bakersfield is nice. I imagine it's hard to sit and talk on weekends because the place is probably jumping so heavily, but at least on a weekday night it's nice and conversational. The music is also good, or at least it was when I was in there. Country and western songs, but actual good songs as opposed to just the chart-topping crap you suffer through elsewhere.

It was good, I would go again. To and from breakfast, we noticed Sweet Carrot and wondered what it was. Typically my curiosity gets the best of me and I Google/Yelp search immediately. For some reason I didn't and went on my merry way.\\n\\nFast forward to the next day. My bff that doesn't know it, Guy Fieri, is on the tv. Where is he? SWEET CARROT. Good sir, why didn't you tell me about them two days ago!? Where were you Guy??? I didn't have time to slow down and take a look around! That's your job! I just go where you tell me to, but you took too long! \\n\\nI immediately vowed to visit before the end of the year.\\n\\nExtreme fast forward to this past Thursday, which was 4 months after low key salty Stephanie's episode. My sister and I were going to lunch. I knew exactly where we were going. We went straight to Sweet Carrot right after a quick Target run.\\n\\nWe walked in before the lunch rush, which I was super pumped about. Although not in a business district, I assumed Sweet Carrot still received a large lunch rush due to its tv time. I was correct in my assumption; 10 minutes after we ordered, there was a line out the door.\\n\\nThe menu at Sweet Carrot is small. You have your choice of protein over either corn cakes or Mac and cheese, or you can make a salad or sandwich out of it all. The employees are very welcoming and are happy to assist you with creating the perfect combination. I knew immediately I needed the artichoke and Mac and cheese, but my sister wanted a moment to figure it out. Once we ordered, we were given a number Noodles & Company style. \\n\\nThe food didn't take long to come out at all. We dug in immediately. It was amaaaaazeballs. I was nervous because aioli on top of Mac and cheese sounded overpowering, but everything blends together effortlessly. I felt like I was hitting umami. It was creamy and savory, but the artichokes gave it a textural difference that it would have been desperately missing had they'd not been paired together. My sister also enjoyed her items, but found it to be \\"too greasy\\" for her taste. My first response was THIS IS AMERICA WATCHU MEAN TOO GREASY!? I eventually rationalized my thought process and listened to her. She had wished she ordered a sandwich because her particular combination was too rich for her.\\n\\nWhatevs Alex you're 17, you haven't actually lived yet.\\n\\nThe cheesy potatoes we ordered on the side tasted like a ramped up hash brown casserole from Cracker Barrel. You could tell they use fresh cheese for their potatoes, and it didn't need a lick of seasoning. The portions were perfect for me; like my sister, I thought our food was very rich. I loved it, but I know if I had too much I wouldn't be able to handle it. Plus the little cast iron plates are so cute!\\n\\nI ended up order brisket over corn cakes to go for my dad. The busser/cashier was so helpful and brought out my food to me so I didn't have to move. He was so nice!

It's also really affordable for the quality .. also 10% off for take out orders. So because of all of this, expect it to be very busy all the time. For take out expect there to be a line up of people just waiting to pick up their food - not because they are slow and inefficient, but because it is really good sushi at good prices and everyone knows that. If u watch the waitresses, they may not have time for small talk or extra smiles, but they are taking phone orders at a lightning speed at the same time as putting through payments for takeout orders and dealing with a packed restaurant, at the same time as calmly keeping track of the line up that is forming out the door. When we do sit down to eat here the food comes out fast but is still great quality. Come earlier to avoid the crowd and of course they don't take resos. Just put your name on the board and wait so u can see why it's so damn busy all the time! Also, if u like to stay awhile and chat they don't encourage that.. they will be coming around a lot to take your used dishes and pretty much looking at you to leave soon for a quick turnover.

We had to ask them if they were ready to take our order. While trying to order, the server was curt and rude and didn't listen to what we were saying. She didn't put the ingredients I wanted and didn't take the time to listen to me. While I waited for her to prepare my order I went to the restroom, which was in a filthy condition. Sticky floors and no toilet paper (I had to wipe with hard paper towels). When I returned, our burritos were still not ready...and the pupusas weren't even on the grill. We thought about just walking out. When we finally got our food it was subpar to say the least. Greasy and messy presentation and overall not appetizing. My bowl was half empty, and the few veggies she did through on (at the end when I asked) were lettuce and cucumbers which felt like they had been out all day. For a restaurant that says \\"always fresh\\" they did not meet up to their standards. The rice and meat were over seasoned and did not go together at all. Finally the pupusas...were both burned and greasy. We didn't eat those. Overall our mistake cost $25.00. It was definitely not worth our time and energy. Never again!

Ordered the baked goat cheese appetizer ($9.50) and it was good, but a lil on the pricy side for 4-crostini's.  The salads were served next with a light dressing.  The field greens looked to be very fresh which is more than i can say for alot of places.  \\n\\nWe split the beef tenderloin and trout entrees.  I think the beef is probly the better of the two.  Steak was seared well on the outside and cooked to specification (i'm always surprised when that happens).  Peppercorn rub was tasty...slightly on the salty side, but I'm a fan of sodium.  The trout in the white cream sauce was a little bland for me.  no other herbs visible.  It tasted fine, but i would probly opt for something else next time.  The sides were the same for all the entrees:  sauteed green beans, potato gallette type things, and pan seared tomato.  Sides were average I'd say.  But all the ingredients were very fresh.  \\n\\nDessert was caramel custard and a crepe with apple filling.  I thought the custard was really good...served cold and it had a very flavorful caramel taste but wasn't overly sweet.\\n\\nOverall, i think for the price, it's a good deal.

You will see a lot of that.   This place is fine dining quality yet most people are very casual. It's all okay cause everyone's tired after all day at the parks.  Need a reservation and there's free parking after you show your reservation to the parking attendant. \\n\\nThe restaurant is inside animal kingdom's lodge. Very gorgeous, woodsy, elegant rustic design.  They have live music and African drum shows kind of in the main foyer, not entirely in the dinner room.  You can definitely hear it throughout the place.  During the musical show, I believe African women are dancing to the beat of the drums. Please don't get upset if I get some ethnicity facts wrong.

We arrived late in the evening and probably missed a lot of things going on inside and had no time to explore.  \\n\\nThe food is wonderful.  I had pork belly - it was extremely juicy and fall of the bones, melt in your mouth.  The sauce reminded me closely of Vietnamese hoisin sauce.  Lots of Asian flavors and I love it.

Amaaaazziiinngggg!!! We loved everything on it! If you like chocolate mousse, get this! \\n\\nA couple things that lowered my rating: \\nMy drink- it was sweet, light and fruity.   Too sweet and Tooo light.  Almost like there was no alcohol and I was drinking fruit flavored sprite.  I was quite disappointed with it, I didn't finish it.  \\n\\nSecond, Most of the plates were a bit too salty.   Some were inedible and was returned (my friends pasta side).

I can't remember verbatim.  But I do remember spending almost $100 on myself.  that was sharing an appetizer and dessert with my friend.  \\n\\nI normally reserve that price point for Michelin restaurants.

The ribeye sandwiches weren't bad, although I don't know why they bother asking how you want it cooked since it doesn't seem to matter. One of the three plates came with no au jus for some reason.  All three of us enjoyed our sandwiches, and the au jus was unique and surprising.\\n\\nThe \\"pesto garlic fries\\" (available over the standard fries for an extra $1) sounded too good to pass up, but in reality they were cold, soggy and limp, as if they had been tossed in this garlic pesto concoction and then left sitting out for a couple of hours. The flavor wasn't really there either.\\n\\nMy wife's mahi sandwich was boring and dry; she took a couple of bites and got a box for it, intent on dousing it with hot sauce at home in an attempt to make it more palatable."},{"name":"Xinh Xinh","address":"7 Beach St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"Not bad, not bad.

It makes an impression and reassures the customer.  And the lack of cleanliness in the dining area here makes me question everything that happens a Los Jaliscienses.  \\n\\nIt's interesting, because you can see the kitchen from the dining area, and the kitchen appears to be clean.  But there are parts of the dining area that look like they haven't been cleaned since this restaurant opened years ago (and the first Yelp review is from 2008 so that's a long time!).  \\n\\nUp until today I've only ordered through the drive-thru.  Breakfast tacos are quick (most of the time) and delicious.  I love their green salsa.\\n\\nBut today the line at the drive-thru was long so I decided to go inside to place my order.  While waiting I looked up.  The light fixtures were covered in dust (I've uploaded a pic) and the air filters were so filthy it looks like there's no way air could even pass through them (you can see part of an air vent to the right of the light fixture).  Now, I realize the ceiling is really high so cleaning those things can't be easy, but it's clear that no one there even looks up or considers a clean dining area a priority.\\n\\nAlso, while I waited, and waited, and waited, a dining-room customer sent his plate back because his food was cold.  Not sure what happened in the kitchen, but he eventually left without eating because his second plate was also cold.  I'm not sure if they re-cooked and the food got cold because the kitchen staff had the back door open on a cool morning or they just stuck it under a heat lamp and it never heated up.  Either way, poor guy left hungry.\\n\\nI mentioned my wait earlier because I was surprised it took so long to prepare three small tacos, which by the way are $2.69 from 7am-11am, but only for two of the same ingredients in all three tacos (each additional ingredient is 35 cents per ingredient per taco).  Well, it took so long because the kitchen staff didn't prepare my order.  The wait staff finally realized I'd been waiting wayyyy too long and brought it to the kitchen staff's attention.  I then waited while the kitchen staff gave the wait staff some attitude.  It took the cook about 3-4 minutes to prepare my tacos, but I'd been waiting for about 20 minutes before he even started!\\n\\nAll in all, I'm just not sure I can go back here.

A terrible experience, and the worst restaurant I have ever been to.\\n\\nMy wife and I used to go to Sala Thai when we lived downtown, and Chada Thai since we moved to Coquitlam.  We have been looking for a new Thai place since the food at Chada Thai has really gone downhill in the last few years.  We were excited to see a local Thai (actually Thai / Vietnamese) restaurant with such good reviews, and thus went last night.  It was so unacceptable that we ended up leaving and eating dinner at another restaurant.\\n\\nTo start, there is a ton of parking and the place looks really nice.  I thought it was decorated far better than average.\\n\\nWe ordered the small Tom Yum Soup (seafood) $6.99, the Green Papaya Salad with Shrimp $10.99, the Basil Chicken $12.99, the Vietnamese Curry Beef Brisket $13.99 and a side of 'coconut' sticky rice $3.95.\\n\\nThe soup was very thin tasting, with none of the bright flavours that usually come with Tom Yum soup.  There was very little spice, and while 'pleasant', the soup was very boring.  I did like the little mushrooms, and the seafood (fish, squid and shrimp) were cooked well.  This soup was the highlight of the night.\\n\\nThe papaya salad was flat out horrible.  Thai food is fresh and bright, with strong contrasting flavours and good heat.  This salad had absolutely none of that.  This was a pile of soggy papaya and carrot with just a bland dressing that had been on the salad for far too long.  There was no texture or rigidity to the papaya, in fact I could not even recognize it as papaya.  It seemed more like soggy daikon than anything else.  Clearly this salad was made early in the day, either before lunch or perhaps even the day before.  I HATED this salad.\\n\\nThe basil chicken looked and smelled good, and the chicken was pretty nice actually, but he sauce had an odd taste, similar to food that has been saved in plastic for a long time.  This may have been from the canned bamboo shoots, or perhaps some other part of the sauce, but whatever it was, it made the dish pretty bad.  I did not like this dish.\\n\\nWe tried to stop the other items, but we were too late.  The 'coconut' rice came, and other than having never been within 45 feet of any part of a coconut, the rice was pretty good.  I do like sticky rice, though I think think this rice was not \\"Thai rice\\", maybe Vietnamese.  The curry came, and I tried a bit of it, and it was flavoured ok, but extremely heavy.  I may have ordered the wrong thing, as to be fair I have never tried Vietnamese curry, but I do love the spices of Vietnamese food.  I thought the flavours would be more like this braised pork dish I made after watching a show on food network:\\n\\nhttp://www.sbs.com.au/food/recipe/28/Braised-pork-with-egg-and-coconut-juice-%28thit-heo-kho%29/\\n\\nWe described our problems with the dishes, asked to send the salad and the chicken back, and to pack up the curry.  The server (actually, to this point the server and the hostess/manager had been very nice) made the classic \\"bad restaurant mistake\\" of deciding to try an point out how I was wrong, and their food was in fact good.  This never works! \\n\\n\\"Have you had Thai food before?\\" \\nwhy, yes we have actually, many times in fact.\\n\\n\\"Where do you usually go, our food is very authentic and popular\\"  \\nWe used to go to Chada Thai, but it isn't as good as it used to be (the chef unfortunately passed away a couple of years ago).\\n-(what I really wanted to respond with was \\"oh?!  authentic and popular?  I was wrong, I really like it, thanks for letting me know I was just ignorant!  I feel so much better now)\\n\\nThe server agreed that Chada Thai had slipped, and now \\"lots of their customers come here\\".  This may be true, but nothing about this conversation is about me and my experience with the restaurant.  The conversation is useless and self serving.  Far better to apologize for me not liking the food, and get me on my way.\\n\\nA couple minutes later, the server returned with my bill.  I had been billed for the entire meal (over $50) and had eaten hardly any of it.  I went up to the counter, and said \\"you have billed me for the whole meal\\".  Her response was \\"Yes\\".  I pointed out that this was unreasonable, and was able to \\"negotiate\\" to only pay for the soup, the rice, and the curry that I was taking out.\\n\\n$30.

It is a not big, flamboyant, trendy, coolest, latest, hippest place to be seen, with prices that can fly one to Japan and back.  There is a real cozy feel that reminds me of the little holes in Sasebo, Japan, during my United States Naval stint. Where mamasan, papasan, and their kids took care of us like we were their own country men and women. All it takes is one visit and the staff, let me rephrase that, the family takes over and extends that gracious hospitality it takes to separate a good restaurant from a great restaurant. They are not razzle, dazzle, click your heels and bow, with the efficiency of a five star professional operation. However, they extend warm, genuine, sincere, gracious hospitality in every step of service.\\n\\nInside of the restaurant presents a clean, cozy, comforting, warm space. With hanging lights, soft woods, easy colors, a fish tank, tables, sushi bar, banquets, and booths. The booths offer semi privacy while the tables create a stage to showcase the wonders of these very precise and thoughtful  chefs.\\n\\nTuna Tartare--cubed tuna mixed with avocado, spicy sauce, topped with masago, black tobiko, and scallions; surrounded with a garlic ponzu sauce, and sesame oil. (description different from menu)\\n\\nTo enjoy this beauty, mix it all up or nibble one morsel at a time. I prefer the whole experience so I mix it all together and then drink the sauce. No I don't. But I would like to. Perfect balance of citrus, sweet, tangy, spiciness. The silky texture of the avocado adds a whole different flavor profile to the raw tuna. Excellent combination.\\n\\nDuck Roll--duck strips, cucumber, scallions, wrapped in a thin pancake; served with hoisin sauce.\\n\\nNice spin on the traditional peking duck. Thin strips of duck eaten with a bun, dipped in hoisin sauce. Surprising how duck and vegetables wrapped in pancake can work so well. Great roll. Nice textures all working in harmony.\\n\\nBBQ Whole Squid--grilled whole squid with chef's special sauce.\\n\\nVery few, if any, restaurants in Orlando serves this dish. The squid tastes like it was just plucked from the ocean, skinned, dipped in soy sauce, grilled, cut and served. It is fresh, crunchy, chewy, and full of flavor. The dipping sauce of sweet soy and citrus adds just enough moisture to make the pieces succulent without drowning the squid flavor. The smokiness from the grill could easily invoke a feeling one gets from watching an episode of Andrew Zimmern: Bizarre Foods.\\n\\nNo Name Special Roll--tuna, salmon, yellow tail, mango, avocado, wrapped with soy paper; topped with escolar, tuna, salmon, masago, black tobiko; in a kimchee ponzu sauce.\\n\\nNo name, because this is what happens when one lets the chefs use their creative talents. Pad dow! Amazing...Fresh, clean, light flavors all combine to make a wow summer mouth party. The use of kimchee to add another dimension to ponzu sauce was brilliant. \\n\\nTheir maki menu is not very basic and neither over the top. It is a good combination. Far too many restaurants use California Roll as a base and just top with several different combinations to create more rolls. That is a very lazy and dull way to build a menu. Then there are those who go so over the top that the flavors just don't work and the rolls looks like a pile of crap. Sushi like everything Japanese is about the subtleness of balanced flavors. Mikado has achieved this balance on their rolls.\\n\\nTrio Sashimi--5 pieces of tuna, salmon, and yellowtail sashimi. I changed up this combination  to include mackerel.\\n\\nThe sake selection is lacking in variety and scale. There are basic wine varieties and selections that rounds out the menu. This is still a simple restaurant that focuses on the food and service.\\n\\nThe Orlando location has built a reputation of consistent, friendly, genuine service, and superb food quality. The feeling one gets here is like going to someone's home and being fed and treated like a family member.

Save yourself the aggravation, skip the Groupon \\"deal\\" and just go to Fogo de Chao if you are looking for a nice Brazilian steakhouse experience.  Our family loves Fogo, but live in Gwinnett, so we decided to make a reservation and give this place a try using their Groupon special instead of driving to Buckhead as usual.  The place is basically an Asian style light buffet packaged as an \\"authentic Brazilian\\" steakhouse.  The greeter had an immediate attitude when we told them we were using a Groupon and proceeded to tell us what the total bill would be with tax and mandatory 18% gratuity based on the full price (without discount).  She then spent  5 minutes trying to find our names in the reservation book even though there were only 3 tables occupied in the entire place.  The salad bar was a lightly stocked Asian buffet and the hot bar had 3 (yes three) items on it. The wine selection is a joke.  Instead of placing a basket of rolls/bread at the table, they come with the basket, and ask you to choose a roll (that was a first). The waiters are supposed to continuously bring selections of meat to you based on your card color (red or green).  The waiters initially came to our table for about a continuous 20 minutes regardless of card color and then that was it.  We notified the server, who said they would be be out shortly.  Meanwhile they were serving another table that was newly seated.  After waiting for about 30 minutes, we asked to speak with an owner/manager.  The owners, who are not Brazilian, tried to stay behind the scene guessing to keep the authentic facade.  They never apologized for their sub par service but instead made every excuse about why we went for so long without service.  Summary: This is place lacks customer service, lacks authenticity, food is mediocre, owners are frugal and try to cut corners.  Even if you're not Brazilian, if you open a Brazilian style restaurant, honor the culture and do it right."},{"name":"Red and Green Brazilian Steakhouse","address":"5979 Buford Hwy NE, Ste B1","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3","text":"Used a groupon for 4 @109.00.

Delicious!\\n\\nThe prices are affordable and you can have a meal for under $10-12 including tax and tip. It is possible to order a bunch of dishes to share. The only con would be the fried oil smell of the new place, though the additional parking is an improvement over the old location.

I think that they were a bit on the conservative side in the amount of gravy that was placed on the food, but nothing really to complain about.   The biscuits are very dense, but that is a good thing, especially if they were a bit more generous with the gravy.  These biscuits are made to be flooded with a viscous liquid, so ordering a biscuit with no sauce (as one of my dining companions did that day) may leave you needing a refill or two on the Stumptown.\\n\\nMy wife had the same dish with honey and pickles.

They brought us the pot of broth and no one helped us turn on the stove/heater.  I end up turning on the stove without the staff's assistance. They placed lots of ingredients in the original milky broth. The meats and vegetables are all very fresh. The staff mixed up on one of our orders and forgot to bring an item we ordered as well, until I reminded them. Place is very busy and our server is mostly busy running around helping other tables.

The place is always packed at lunch time leaving you no where to sit or sometimes even stand when ordering.

Then I'm left with the choice of some vegan hippie slices, cross my fingers and hope they have more meat slices coming out, or walk out the door and go somewhere else. \\n\\nWith that all out of the way, the pizza is great.

The dish comes with hummus, baba ganouj, one grape leaf, one falafel, a spinach pie, something they called zattar pizza, tabouli, a yogurt/creamy dipping sauce, and a HUGE pita.  Admittedly the falafel was cold by the time I got back to the hotel, but it had good spices so that's a plus.  The rest of the food is what it should be, super fresh, well spiced, perfect textures.

The waitstaff, owner, bartenders, hostesses, foods and drinks are all a step above what you expect at a locally owned and operated dining establishment.  This is a great place for meeting friends, dates, and for groups.  The happy hour is great.  They make your salsa right at the table and you select mild, medium or hot.  There is a bean dip served with the chips and salsa that is out of this world.  The menu is 10+ pages of an excellent variety of interior Mexican cuisine, Tex-Mex dishes, and American entrees.  If you are lucky, you will meet the shot guy (aka the GM) who wears his shot glasses in a strap across his chest and serves up some top shelf tequila with lemon-lime soda in a shot as a gesture of gratitude for dining here.  If you have a large party, call ahead and ask for the tables by the bar where they will arrange them for the size of your party.  On Friday nights there is a mariachi band as well for your entertainment.  The band is not annoying and usually spend only one song per table unless you request them for more songs.  Parking is plentiful.  I can't think of any reason to give less than 5 stars.  The lunch buffet is a value worth trying as well!

You don't get charged a glass fee when you order an individual margarita so why is a pitcher, WHEN YOU ARE POURING THE DRINK YOURSELF DIFFERENT?! Also, no where on the menu does it say this.

I was left thinking to myself...are we getting second rate food now the buffet is over? I came to understand that by better food he was probably meaning more food for your dollar. The buffet is about $17 or $18 per person,  and a regular dinner dish is about $14-$18 per person.\\n\\n I also personally found the owner's attitude to be a bit to the point and presumed most would read his demeanor as cock y (especially from reading previous comments), but again I believe it was a cultural thing- because service was great nonetheless. He was just really assertive about his food and extremely confident that theirs is the best around- as he proceeded to tell us that a millionaire who travels all over the world looking for the best hummus always ends up coming to Aladdins for the reigning chickpeas :) I must admit, the hummus did live up to his hype. It was VERY good. My husband was clearing the bowl and he normally hates hummus. As I remained open to the experience,  I actual came to enjoy this forward, yet kind owner. My husband and I just really got the feeling that this food and the restaurant is his pride and joy-his baby.\\n\\nI ordered the vegetarian platter and the food was delicious and fresh. Lovely salad, great hummus,  I enjoyed the spinach pie (with touches of grapeleaves in there I believe), and adventured with my palate to the other creamy-like sauce to the right of my platter (tabouleh?? Can't remembef if that's it). The second sauce was a bit strong for my palate. My husbands meat platter included lamb, chicken, and a few other tasty choices of meat. He wanted to try quail, but they didn't have any until Tuesday they said. I found the food fresh and authentic. The meat, for  9:45/10pm was flavorful and absolutely satisfying.

Then for dessert, it was an order of baklava (3 pieces, each a different flavor), and Aish el Saraya (something I still don't totally understand what it is made from), a most delicious dessert. \\n\\nIt was one of the most enjoyable and delicious meals I have had around here. The hummus was smooth, creamy, and full of flavor. A touch of cayenne on top.  The pita was oven fresh and perfect for dipping. If you have not had labaneh/labneh, GO HERE JUST FOR THAT. It is a tart, thick yogurt sauce that I would call similar to a thick tzatziki. But much better.

I asked a server if we could trade for a different soup so he got the beef stew instead. My husband loved the stew, he was impressed with the amount of beef in proportion to vegetables. The Reuben had a hearty portion of meat and balanced well with the sauerkraut. Salad bar had many fresh greens and veggies to choose from. We enjoyed the selection of pickled items also available.

The food was good, for the most part, which is why I'm even giving two stars.\\n\\nI ordered from here for the first time through Eat24.  The delivery time was 40-60 minutes.  It arrived in 1 hour and 15 minutes.  \\n\\nFirst thing I noticed was that all the round containers of sauce in the bag were topsy turvy and that there was brown sauce covering everything in the bag.  Somehow all the brown sauce spilled out of my container of chicken and broccoli and got on EVERYTHING.  There was a pretty good sized puddle of sauce at the bottom of the bag.  This sucked because I no longer had much sauce for my chicken and broccoli or my fried rice (both of which tasted yummy, btw).  It also sucked because I ended up having to clean a wet, greasy mess off of everything and off of all my kitchen counters.\\n\\nThen I noticed the missing items.  I was missing my entire order of wontons, the brown sugar sauce for the fried tofu (they sent peanut sauce instead, the container of which was not covered correctly.  However, it did not spill out and into the bag because the sauce was already a solid when it got to me), no straw for the tea (which I specifically asked for), and no fortune cookies.  \\nSpeaking of the 3 Herb Tea, it tasted fine, but no different than any other black tea and the cup was not full.  It was a large cup and the top 1.5 to 2 inches were empty.\\n\\nI got on Eat24's chat and let them know which items were missing.  I also asked for a cup of brown sauce to pour over my chicken and broccoli.  Eat24 were very nice and said that the restaurant would be sending the missing items in 15-20 minutes.  We were starving by then, so we ate most of the fried tofu with the peanut sauce, which was fine.  \\nWhen the items arrived (25 minutes later), the only sauce they sent was a small container of thin, pungent, very spicy sauce.  I don't think this was the brown sugar sauce or the brown sauce for the chicken and broccoli.  By that time the chicken and broccoli and rice were cold, and I ended up eating them dry-ish. I actually spooned some of the sauce from the bottom of the bag onto the food.\\n\\nThe Eat24 chat person was sympathetic and said they would try to get Java Noodles to do something for me.  They ended up comping the order of wontons.  Wow.\\n\\nBut the food was pretty good so I might give them a second chance to redeem themselves."},{"name":"Villa Mexico","address":"296 Cambridge St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"DUDE.

The woman who was working the service station where the Quinoa was located told us that Quinoa is a great source of protein, B and E vitamins and calcium\\nJungle Juice- A combination of lemonade, pineapple juice, guava juice, orange juice, and papaya juice. AMAZING!\\n\\nThe food at Boma is so much better than most buffets I have been too. \\n\\nThe service here was phenomenal as well. Our server, Pam, was super friendly and attentive. She answered the many questions I had about their food. She also never got tired of bringing me refill after refill of their wonderful Jungle Juice. Pam even got me a large cup of it to go, which was awesome.

I've eaten with a couple different people and they've all had good things to say about it. I've had a couple different dishes here: #69, #70, #31, #43, and #46. My favorite has to be the #43 (Beef Stew Noodle). Below is a brief review for each menu item.\\n\\n#69 (grilled pork with steam rice) - Portion is just right if you're not starving but still want a decent sized meal. The pork is tender and better then most pork chops I've had around in Chinatown (I'm looking at your Taiwan Cafe and Dumpling House).\\n\\n#70 (grilled lemongrass chicken with steam rice) - The portion is always very large. It's almost a quarter of a chicken. The chicken is very well seasoned, it's almost an explosion of flavors. If you don't eat it with rice it might even be too overwhelming, but hey, that's why it comes with it. \\n\\n#31 (curry chicken vermicelli soup) - I was bracing myself for something super spicy, but it wasn't. For me, personally, I thought it was fine that it simply had a curry flavor rather than the spiciness of curry. Perhaps for other who are looking for something hot, they might want to ask the chef to make it spicy or go for something else.\\n\\n#46 (yellow noodle with roast duck) - The soup was not bad, a little bit on the light side, but still pretty good. The duck meat was decent, but not a winner in my opinion. I think I may be biased in this regard, but my idea of perfect duck always includes a crispy exterior. The idea that the skin \\"used to be\\" crispy is heart-wrenching for me. The waitress said it was a popular dish, but it has got to be my least favorite.\\n\\n#43 (beef stew noodle) - My favorite dish so far in Xinh Xinh. It is reminiscent of a classic Taiwanese beef stew noodle in the color and the texture of the beef, but having a completely different flavor. The soup was dark brown, swirling with the pure essence of beefy goodness. The beef was very tender, while maintaining the integrity of it's structure. I cleaned out every scrap of meat, drop of soup, and probably floating pieces of bone marrow in that bowl.\\n\\nConclusion\\n\\nI have to say it is the best Vietnamese food I have had to date. Highly recommended. It is super cheap and the portions are usually very large. I'm surprised that it's not packed during lunchtime everyday, probably because it's all the way in back of Chinatown."},{"name":"Tito's Burritos Mexican Flavor","address":"1921 SW 6th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"I'm starting to think that you just can't wrong no matter which truck you choose on this street.

Burritos you can anywhere in the world.  But tacos like this are difficult to find.\\n\\nAfter the taco, I got a burrito.  It's a pretty healthy size and will definitely fill up a natural appetite.

I had the Kitchen Sink salad, and there wasn't anything unique or spectacular about the salad.  The waitress billed the dressing as totally yummy, with a lime flavor, and it was really bland with no taste of lime in sight!  It was also small.  My friend had the shrimp and avocado tacos, which were SUPER small for a lunch portion.  I would have sold it as an appetizer, not an entre.  My soda water with lemon was $6.00.  Did I mention my soda was $6.00????  And no, there wasn't any vodka in my soda water.  \\n\\nThe wait staff can wear whatever outfit they want, so it is hard to tell who is working there or is a customer.  The hostess was wearing an extremely risque outfit (at least I thought so), better suited for the evening on a street corner.  For two sodas and two lunch entres, the total bill was $45.00!!!  For lunch!!!  \\n\\nThe Yard House down the street may be a chain restaurant, but I can't say I have had one bad meal and everything there has been worth the price.  The Happy's menu also has entrees with cutsie names that you can't tell what they are unless you ask your wait staff what it might be.

Not the disaffected, you-have-to-know-our-culture thing that could put people off and that I was led to expect from sifting through some of the writing here. I even had to ask about ingredients because of an allergy and the person at the register did a triple-check to verify where soybean oil is used in their kitchen. He actually went back into the kitchen area to put his own eyes on the packaging for their fry oil to see what the ingredients were  - thereby saving me a very unpleasant experience. For that, I give them a serious gold star. For soy allergy sufferers: at the moment (June, 2010) they do use soybean oil for their fry oil. I am hoping that more businesses go the way of the pod on 12th and Hawthorne and start using rice bran oil or similar - after all, supporting the soy lobby isn't really what we want to be doing in a local place. /editorial\\n\\nAside from that, I'm a Portlander, so totally OK with waiting in lines for food and restaurants that are more about indoor counters than dining rooms. Some of our very best food comes from this sort of format. There is a Stumptown nearby and you can get a nice drink to go and sip while you are waiting. No problem.\\n\\nThe friend chicken and cheese sandwich that my husband had was really wonderful. Great flavor combination, nicely presented and we didn't think it took very long at all to get our order. On a Sunday afternoon at abt 12:30! I know we lucked out on the line length, but still, our order came out quickly from the time we placed it at the register.\\n\\nThe reason for three instead of four stars is actually the biscuits themselves. Not bad, certainly, but a tad overworked and not quite cooked long enough. For a buttermilk biscuit recipe, these should have been more tender and flaky. Instead, they were a little rubbery/pasty as noted by a couple other reviewers. Perhaps they are using more buttermilk and less butter in the recipe - that would account for some of the texture. The biscuits are better than most places in Portland where really, there is a sad lack of good biscuits. \\n\\nYes, it's worth it if you like the venue/the venue suits your needs. I suspect that the big sandwiches are the best thing about the menu. I will try a plain biscuit with butter and jam once more to see if they are more in the heavenly realm I had been led to expect by the buzz. If so, I will certainly revise my rating to 4 stars. It should be 3.5, really, to give appropriate credit for the quality of service we had."},{"name":"Paris Baguette","address":"581 Massachusetts Ave","city":"Cambridge","stars":"3.5","text":"Paris Baguette brings back memories of home.

Sure it seemed expensive for an appetizer but I was splitting it between 4 people so $6 a head for a starter is way reasonable.  It arrive and it was the size of those overstuffed sushi boats, except with Italian food.

Well this ragu definitely gave the Crespelle a run for its money.\\n\\nOk back to Teatro.  So my other half decided to order the Mushroom Ravioli, and consequently loses her plate.  I can't begin to describe how tasty that dish is.  The earthiness of the mushrooms was tamed by the creamy sauce, that was accented, ok more like doused, in some sort of sweet wine reduction.

Since I don't like things cooked in peanut oil, I did not like the fries.  I ordered my burger medium rare, and they cooked it as requested.  It had a lot of ooze factor.  Yep, I liked it. It was a very good burger.  They have limited toppings as compared to the other burger places nearby.  The shakes were good too.  If you order the big burger, fries, and a shake, your bill will be over $11.  The second time I went, I tried the chopped chili cheese dog.  I did not like it, and I am not sure why; it could be the chili or the chopped dog but something was spicy hot but it wasn't to my taste.

I sat down before I saw the 2.5 yelp rating, it was too late to run. It looks chic from the outside but the wait for food is ridiculous and the food is lacking in flavor. We sat down, it took a waiter about 10 minutes to great us. We ordered our food which was only appetizers and had to wait 30 minutes for the food to come. Usually they give everyone chips with salsa, we had to ask them after 20 minutes if they could give us some chips and salsa, it was like they forgot we were there. They apologized for the food taking so long.

When we walked in, I was transfixed by the display. Blueberry bourbon basil! Mexican Hot Chocolate! Lemon poppyseed buttermilk! It was hard to only choose one from the amazing selection of freshly baked donuts that were sure to melt in my mouth. I chose the Blueberry bourbon basil on the first day and I am glad I did. The cashier said that it was one of their best-selling and definitely one of the more unique flavors. The blueberry frosting had basil mixed within it and when you bite into it, the blueberry flavor is overwhelming but afterwards, the basil slowly creeps in, giving it a nice and smooth bite. My dad got the lemon poppyseed buttermilk, which was absolutely delicious and light. After posting these donuts on Instagram, I was asked to bring some back, so I came back a second time and of course, I couldn't just not get a donut for myself. I got the Dulce de leche hazelnut, which I found to be okay but a little too sweet for my taste. Still, this place is fantastic and you need to come here. Do not bother going to that other famous travel channel donut place, the line is gigantic and their donuts are overrated.

I did not visit the shop (wife picked up an assortment and brought to our rental) and did not pay the bill.  Had I paid the bill I may have been less inclined to give 4 stars.  Their motto is \\"quality over quantity\\" and their prices do bare that out. \\nI think we paid a lot for our 8 or 9 donuts.

The pizza has the essence of home cooking and does not have the commercial taste which you get in other pizza chains. So for food this place gets 5 stars. However I had a very weird experience few days back which is very not this place. The girl at the counter was rude and there was no sign of a slightest smile. I don't expect anything but yes I do want to feel welcome in a place. When the bill came out I told her that there is a discrepancy in the price of the wings. She had charged me more than what was written on the menu. Instead of rectifying it she started telling me that what my system says this so I can't help it but if you have issue I can call my manager. Well manager was very courteous and he apologized and rectified it, stating that our prices have recently changed. Is is even logical or legal to overcharge than the menu prices? It was afternoon and I was really thirsty and so I asked for a glass of water. I was the only customer in the restaurant however was told that would have to get it myself from one corner. Didn't find the water since the container which had water also had a paper pasted which said, lemonade and out of order.

This is one of the best hot pot places I have ever been.  There is a huge staff and they are running a fast paced production in there making sure everyone has water, enough brother, the food they ordered etc.\\n\\nInitially, I had wished there were other broth options to choose from, but the spicy broth was incredibly favorable.  We ordered way too much food for two people but we really enjoyed it.  One thing I think they should work on it teaching new people how to do hot pot.  We told them we had never done it before, but they did not give any instructions.  They just kind of dropped off the food and left.  \\n\\nThey were giving away their most popular meat for free and it was delicious!  We got the house meatballs -- which were kinda creepy and were difficult to know if they were finished in the middle.  The head on shrimp was good, but difficult to eat without prior experience.  The enoki mushroom order was huge and I was very happy about that.  You must get the lamb dumplings!  They were so delicious -- but they were kind of cold by the time they came to the table. \\n\\nReady to turn the rest of my friends into hot pot eaters!  I will bring them here.

High ceiling, open bar, the ambience is great! We got seated immediately on the 2nd floor when arrived at 12:45pm on a Friday. I've ordered 2 items from chef's recommendations:\\n- Mirai special chicken on rice $13: it's like teriyaki chicken with immitation crab meat on rice, topped with some lettuce and spicy mayo. Large portion and taste great. But I feel sauce is lil too much and it got heavy and greasy in my last few bites. It's good to be shared and mixed with some light sushi/salad.\\n- rainbow roll $10: It's like how an ordinary rainbow roll is. No surprises there in both good and bad ways. Not sure what's so special that makes it to chef's recommendation though. \\n\\nFew things they should consider:\\n1.  Add some picture to the menu especially on items that are lack of descriptions.\\n2. Put a buzzer on second floor as music could get louder downstairs and waitress are less attentive to upstairs. We didn't get our tea until we asked for it and we had hard time getting their attention to get the bill.\\n\\nPros: a lot of selection from menu, big table that can seat up to 8 ppl\\n\\nCons: lack of service on 2nd floor, +$1 to get nigiri sushi seared (other places generally cheaper)"},{"name":"No.1 Beef Noodle House","address":"4741 Willingdon Avenue","city":"Burnaby","stars":"3.5","text":"If you want Taiwanese style good beef noodles. This is the place to go. Besides beef noodles, they have rice & noodles dishes. The menu is extensive with several side dishes that they offer. Service is good & fast with attentive & friendly staff. They have many varieties of bubble tea & they have specials after 9pm. \\nOne of my favourite is the house special beef shank noodles, lots of meat, best to eat with chilli sauce (upon request), the other is a rice dish with sour mustard veggies with meat sauce accompanied by Taiwanese style sausages.\\nThe beef noodles is yummy, soup base is good, noodles has a nice chewy texture. Since bubble tea is half price, I chose a green matcha milk tea with grass jelly ( there are many different kind of add-on for 75 cents). We also ordered a side of crispy fried tofu accompanied by their special tofu sauce. The sauce is da bomb! You can literally dip anything into it besides the yummy fried tofu. If you are not too fond of tofu, I highly recommend that you try with the sauce. They go very well together. As I said... this is my usual go to place for a meal. Parking can be a challenge as they have stalls allocated for each restaurant & it is in a small mall.

I went there for my birthday dinner- upon walking in I was taken by surprise the location and on how beautiful the restaurant itself was. Me and my boyfriend were seated immediately with reservations which was great, however, noone asked us what we wanted to drink or even gave us water! After about 30 minutes my boyfriend asked the waiter what was taking so long and he 'forgot' about our table. Great response. We were seated next to a party of 10 so that's probably why but that is no excuse. Our drinks finally came 10 minutes later but still no water! Inexcusable. By then we were ready to order but immediately after he put our drinks down he tended to the party of 10 and laughed and joked with them. I got the waiters attention and we then put in our order- we ordered a few apps and an entree for each of us. 15 min after that we finished our 1st round of drinks and again couldn't find our waiter/get his attention for another round. My boyfriend being in the restaurant industry himself went to go ask the manager why we were getting treated so terribly needless to mention it was my birthday dinner and the manager came over, apologized, and mentioned that there was a bigger party next to us so 'maybe' the waiter was overwhelmed. Definitely didn't seem like it. I shook my head at the manager and said what terrible service even coming from you. 20 MINUTES LATER they come with the apps- so in total waited 30-40 minutes just for the apps. They were good- but not amazing. Another 20 minutes go by and only my boyfriends entree comes, it gets better because they forgot to fire my entree! Are you kidding me? 30 minutes later my entree comes and it is mediocre at best. The manager actually comes over and apologizes about the confusion but no waiter? He didnt even run the food to us- so annoying. I told the manager that this was the worst dining experience I've had in a very very long time and he should look into firing and rehiring a better staff- I even asked for his boss's information. To top it off my boyfriend bought movie tickets and we missed the whole movie because of how long the meal took. NEVER GOING BACK.
