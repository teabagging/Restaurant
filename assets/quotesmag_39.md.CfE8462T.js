So odd! She also waited until the restaurant cleared out completely to clean up all the dirty tables.

Flavors are very earthy and unconventional.  Emphasis on visual presentation is top notch, the best I've ever experienced in any restaurant anywhere.  This was one of the most thought provoking dinners I've had so far.  Credit must be given work to meticulous preparation, creativity of ideas, and a lot of risk taking.  In my opinion, the food here is challenging.  This is a dinner you will remember and think about often.\\n\\nWe began with our first amuse bouche.  This resembled a Japanese 'mochi', and I suppose might have been a re-interpretation of one. A very delicate, lightly crunchy, powdery meregue shell was on the outside, savory center with roe. Fun use of  'yogurt powder'.  Very good & varied play in textures.  Haven't had anything like this.  Best amuse bouche of the 3.\\n \\nSecond amuse bouche resembled a graham cookie.  sesame seed replaces chocolate.  ok dish, I didn't find this particularly interesting or delicious.  Visually quite boring.  Probably the least impressive part of our dinner.\\n \\nPork jowl w hazelnut oil.  hardened like bacon cookie topped with cheese.  This was like eating a peanut butter snack.  Fun dish.\\n \\n'Almonds with chicory, almond curd and lovage' \\n\\nwas my gf's first course.  These are not conventional almonds, but resemble giant sprouts and have a very earthy flavor to them.  The flavors of the dish resemble something you might pick from a garden, and randomly try when you were a kid.  sorrels a tad citrus-like.  this is a pretty good summer feeling dish.  everything is very light.  excellent presentation.\\n\\n'Green strawberries with smoked cod, young pine and baked mussel jus' \\n\\nwas my first course.  The cod is served two ways.  Some of the cod is pulverized into a fine powder.  The other portion is cut and almost cooked lightly.  pickled strawberries.  I believe the pine is prepared in way that almost resembles a sherbet.  There's a lot going on here.  Nice play w temperatures.  It's clean tasting & refreshing.  flavors are sublte.  Dish is very complicated (to me) and difficult to define.  Pretty good, and very interesting.\\n\\n'Ground Anemone: pine nut gravy, morels, rabbit sausage and nettles'  \\n\\nThis was the best dish of the evening, and one of the best I've had.  My gf said it best, when the flavors and textures remind you of a forest.  Flavors are very earthy and savory, yet not at all heavy.  The rabbit sausage carries the predominant flavor, yet does so in a delicate manner, accompanied very well by the other ingredients.  Looks like a trippy mushroom.  Amusingly eerie but attractive presentation.  Excellent dish.\\n\\n'Squid with charcoal vegetable pur√©e, sorrel and mint'  \\n\\nThis was very well prepared squid, cooked 'a la plancha' (grilled on metal surface).  Squid was amazingly tender and delicious, and the preparation was much more straightforward here.  The sauce made from a vegetable ash has a thicker consistency, with subtly sweet and bitter flavors (maybe from the sorrel).  It was an interesting alternative to perhaps using squid ink.  Good dish, but more conventional relative to other dishes.\\n\\n'Chinook salmon, ramps, smoked fat, bouillon of toasted fir'.  \\n\\nThe very well prepared salmon takes center stage here.  It's cooked very lightly and the center is, close to, if not rare.  To me that's perfect.  Fish is very delicious.  This would be a great dish if the fish was served as is.  The sauce is pretty light here and complemented the salmon well.  I was not too keen on the layer of (probably smoked fat) and raw mushrooms that were added.  I did not feel they added anything interesting or enjoyable to the dish.  I felt that the dish was more complicated than it needed to be, but nonetheless very good.\\n\\n'Lamb collar with wheat berries, wheat grass, buttermilk and wild leek'  \\n\\nwas a more hearty dish.  meat cooked pleasantly moist, has a sticky, chewy texture, not unlike pork belly.  foam is fairly thick and has a more broth like quality.  flavors are more conventional here, but with an interesting twist, and nonetheless very effective.  It was the most heavy, and a good progression before dessert.\\n\\n'Beets soaked in rye whiskey, malted ice cream, sorrel and bavarian malt'  \\n\\nBeets here are prepared in a way almost to resemble candied prunes.  I believe that the malt, or sorrel (chef seems to love this ingredient), or maybe something else is used to create a granita-like substance.  The flavors here blend in extremely well and is robust.

But now I totally get it.  The service was outstanding and the knowledge of food and wine from Brandon, our server, was very much appreciated and helped with our decision making, especially for the lovely wine.  We ordered the Gruyere biscuits to start and two orders of the venison for our entrees.  The biscuits were warm and melted along with the sea salt butter on our tongues.  These biscuits also had a slight bite at the end which was nice.  The wine Brandon suggested was the Carmichael \\"Sur la Pont\\" Syrah, a red wine that was bold, but not too sweet or dry, perfect combination for our meal.  (Note: I found that it was a much better deal to buy the bottle then to buy by the glass.  Not all bottles are offered by the glass, but if they are they are a quarter of the full bottle price.) \\n\\nNow, the main event, the venison.  I ordered my entree medium and it came out tender and so lovely.  It was served alongside a fig and chanterelle mushroom salad with a pine nut puree decorating the plate and adding a perfect combination of flavor with the venison and fresh figs.  Though a more \\"gamey\\" thought of meat, the flavor was very light and I can't get over how tender!\\n\\nAfter entrees, we were both pleasantly satiated with wine and food, but we couldn't resist the dessert menu!  We opted to share the bread pudding with nutella ice cream, and although we didn't find the ice cream to be that impressive, the warm decadence of the bread pudding with rich chocolate and fresh hazelnuts inside was the perfect ending along with our last glass of wine.\\n\\nThe Ravenous Pig has been the best restaurant I've been to in Orlando.

The restaurant name turned out to be very misleading as well, persons with \\"ravenous\\" appetites may be disappointed by the pricey small portions.\\n\\nFirst of all, go to the website before going to the restaurant because the menu changes monthly and not all items have mass appeal. For example, when I went in June, half of the entree options were fish and the others were fried chicken, flat-iron steak, leg of lamb, or rib-eye (ranging in price from $24 - $38). I applaud their fresh, locavore methods, but  I can't really say that anything on the menu greatly appealed to me. We were forewarned by the attentive waiter that the starters and pastas were small portions ($11 - $22), and that they were out of the steak tartare.\\n\\nWe ordered the Gruyere biscuits ($4), the oft-raved about Pub Burger ($12), two Gatherer Salads ($6 ea.) and the Southern Fried Chicken ($24). The biscuits were delicious, but hardly enough to satisfy. The salads were outstanding in freshness and flavor. My companion's Pub Burger (which is often a contender in many of the local \\"Best Of\\" categories) was the biggest disappointment of the evening. The blue cheese was overpowering and the truffle oil fries were limp and flavorless. My chicken was good, but not $24 worth.

It's really good and extremely filling. I also tried a pizza that is similar to meat lovers and it's also really good. \\n\\nThe environment is kinda grungy. When you step in there, it almost feels like you're in Little 5 points. On Friday nights they have drunk bingo which is usually fun. They give away prizes like gift cards and coupons for the store. Every time I've been there, it's been tough to find a seat. It's a seat yourself establishment you have to walk around and try to find a seat or hover around a table that you think is going to be wrapping up soon so you can swoop in and get the table when they leave. It's also usually pretty smokey in there which I'm not a big fan of but if you're a smoker, you'll probably love it.

Last night I had an unbelievably bad experience. Bear with me, the story has a punchline-- I squeezed in at the crowded bar to get a beer for myself and a friend (this was to be our first) when a large bearded bro sitting next to me started aggressively bothering me. First he asked me if I knew \\"this f*cker over there\\" and pointed to a guy across the bar I'd never seen before. I said no. Then he ridiculed the way I was breathing (???). I asked him what the problem was and he said \\"I think you're trying to f*ck\\" with me.\\"  I could tell he was wasted and I'm non-confrontational but I stood my ground and tried to ignore his taunts until a group of people left on the other side of him so I moved over there. As I waited for the bartender there the dude loudly told his friend how much he wanted to kill me. He said it over and over again, deliberately so I could hear it. I finally ordered my drinks and when the bartender delivered them, this guy reached over and grabbed them both. I was shocked for a second, told the bartender they weren't for him and reordered. The bartender then told me he could no longer serve me tonight. I said \\"WHAT?!\\" and he awkwardly repeated the line. I asked why and he replied, \\"That's the order that's been passed down to me\\". Yep- turns out tubby aggro is THE OWNER OF DOTS.

The front counter employee was great, she was friendly and seemed very competent and efficient.\\nNext impression:  eh...went to grab coffee, all airpots were cold but one.  We let the counter person know, she thanked us and snagged em to replace with fresh coffee.  I filled my cup with the one warm (but not exactly hot) coffee, went to put half n half in it;  empty.  So I took it to the counter, and it was promptly refilled.  As I'm doing that, a family member went to fill her cup with the last warm coffee, after half a pump it was gone.  We just laughed and felt bad to have to give yet another pot to the counter person, but they handled it very well.\\nFood impression:  overall, we all had the same thought--it was good not great.

Beef tongue, Flounder Fillet, napa cabbage, fried tofu skin (this is a must!), pumpkin, and udon/spinach noodles. \\n\\nNight time prices are about 22/23 bucks per person and the only difference is that it has some extra seafood like salmon and meats like rib eye. Not really worth the extra bucks to spend to eat at night but up to you of course!\\n\\nPST, you can order a side of green onion and garlic to add onto your hot pot sauce. It makes a difference in the flavor. The pots are on either electric stoves or a gas stove if you are sitting on a fold up table.

I wish I could give this place 3.5 stars. The hotel is beautiful. Our room, on the 26th floor, had amazing views--including Epcot, and Magic Kingdom, which meant we saw the fireworks show every night from the hotel room. Seriously, the view is great. We would sit on two comfortable chairs, and just look out the windows for a long time every morning.  In the bathroom, there is a TV built into the mirror (awesome). The soap is in the shape of a duck. Everything was in really great condition, and of very high quality. We splurged on the \\"club level\\" perks, which meant a concierge service (supposed), a nice continental breakfast, and a 5:30pm appetizer spread. The gym in this hotel is better than any I have ever seen at a hotel--it's awesome. -- The negatives of this hotel revole around the service. Everyone is polite, and everyone is incapable of helping with much anything. For instance, we paid for the \\"concierge\\" service, which is non-existant. Examples: We have a bellhop bring our bags up when we arrive. He shows us the room, and says \\"Is there anything else I can do for you?\\" I answer, \\"Yes. I am noticing there is only one robe in the closet. We need a second rope.\\" Bellhop answers. \\"Oh, just call downstairs, and they will send you up another robe.\\" My thought \\"Can't you just get me another robe, bellhop?\\" .... Example #2. Our concierge sees us, and asks us about our stay. We tell her that the cabana we rented by the pool isn't attached to our room's bill, and it would be great to have that fixed. Her answer \\"Just call the desk.\\"   I call the desk, and ask about the cabanna. They put me on hold for 5 minutes because it's not their department. I eventually hang up and call back. I describe the situation to the next attendant. He says that the department that can fix our cabana problem is closed. I ask for a second robe and a corkscrew. He says that he can send up a robe, but the corkscrew needs to be requested through room service, and there is an additional fee. \\"would you like me to forward you to roomservice?\\" What the heck. No.   -- Later, the next day, we meet with a concierge and request a corkscrew, \\"I'll send one right up to your room.\\" \\"really? Thanks!\\" It never arrives, but housekeeping does knock on our room at 10:30pm (yes, 10:30pm) for our turndown services. We were already in bed.  --These are just a sample of customer service issues at this hotel. Trust me, the list goes on.

Since the overall review of this business will be poor, I'll start with the good.\\n\\nProduct:\\nThe product or food is good. Please, understand the difference between good, great and excellent. The food is good in a sense of a desire for southern soul food. It ranks near the top of the list for best in the city. However, the food is not great or excellent as you'd get from someone's grandma's kitchen.\\n\\nPeople:\\nThe people who work there are cordial at best. No one is exceptionally friendly or overly nice. I must say, most of the waitresses are polite. However, you do get a sense of attitude.\\n\\nProcess:\\nHere's where Busy Bee is subpar. There's so much I can write here, but I'll just give the skinny. The cafe has outgrown their current location. There's no reason for a business that's survived decades not to expand. The ordering process is a zoo, and that's me being nice. It takes at least 10-15 minutes to order. Multiply the wait time by 2.5 if you want to dine in. Their POS (point of sale) is unlike anything I've ever seen. Scenario, I order a couple of dinners to go paid and then realized I was overcharged. Here's the caveat I was refunded for my original purchase and then recharged for the correct amount. So the problem is my bank is holding roughly 200 dollars for a \\"mistake.\\"\\n\\nOverall, the food is decent the people and process are horrible. No one is accountable or display any empathy.

I'm not going to say that El Oriental de Cuba is the best Cuban food that I've had because it's not, but for being in Boston, this food was authentic and good. It's hard to fake Cuban cuisine. Every restaurant in Boston seemingly has a \\"Cubano Sandwich,\\" but no place gets it right. The second that I opened the menu at El Oriental de Cuba, I knew that I could order the stuff that I really like.\\n\\nFor my meal, I started with a croqueta. It was nice and cripsy and had little chunks of ham, just the way that I like it!\\n\\nMy entree was a Palomilla steak with white rice, black beans, tostones, and maduros. The palomilla was a little bit dry and served with cooked instead of raw onions, but it was still very flavorful. The black beans had just the right amount of seasoning and the rice was salted perfectly. The tostones were cripsy and the maduros had that sugary coating that they get when they are perfectly ripe and perfectly fried. \\n\\nThe service was very good. Immediately after I finished ordering, the waitress suggested that I have a Materva with my meal because I sounded like I knew my way around Cuban cuisine. She suggested it right before I ordered it on my own, so I appreciated the attention to detail. Everyone in the restaurant was smiling and attentive.\\n\\nTo reference another review, I have experienced \\"the majesty of truly good Cuban food,\\" and while this isn't as good as the \\"greats\\" in Miami, El Oriental de Cuba will give you a tasty introduction (or reintroduction) to Cuban food."},{"name":"Palio Dessert & Espresso House","address":"1996 SE Ladd Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"3","text":"Very good place to study, work, meet or simply enjoy time in great ambience of this cafe!

As you enter you will see a large coffee/sandwich bar that is in the center of all the seating... There is a menu board and a drink list hanging above - really high, you will have to crane your neck a little to view all the options.  I have tried the chai latte a few times - i don't drink much other than water or tea, but every so often i love to try chai - i had a great experience with friends in seattle - nothing ever compares, but I can imagine I am there again when I drink other chai's.  This particular one is nice, but all the spice/flavor seems to be sprinkled on top of the foam, once you get past that there is little to tickle your palate as you go further.  \\nI have also tried a sandwich - it was the willow - and this is a curried tofu with sprouts, apple, lettuce and whole wheat bread.  They asked if i would like it warmed, and of course i do.  The sandwich is stuffed with sprouts, romaine lettuce, curried tofu and has a few thin slices of granny smith apples.  Since there is so much as you pick it up you lose half of the curried tofu  -  it is a messy sandwich, which isn't fun; it would be better in a pita.  Also, the romaine lettuce took up so much real estate that it is hard not to lose the filling, plus the lettuce has very thick, white veins that should be removed, too.  On top of it all the sandwich and the tea cost almost $15.  There was a little sticker shock, but I am not sure I would go back for food if a sandwich is that expensive, i guess I assumed that being in somerville it should be closer to $10... wrong. Finally, I had my laptop because of a meeting later that afternoon, and was curious if there was wi-fi, they have it if you want to pay for it.  You can sign up for a membership, pay per day and per hour, if i remember correctly.  No thanks.  I think that, like some meters in west concord, ma you can push a button and get 12 minutes free to entice shoppers to park and go for quick trips and i think that if you are spending money there you should get a free amount of webtime - say 30 minutes for every $10 you spend.

We had made a reservation so they should have known and prepared.  There were long periods of time when the waiter could not be found and other waiters ignored the table when called.  If they are going to extort the tip they should at least be fair and do 15%.  If they had provided good service I would have added to the 15%.

[long pause]\\nM: Tomatoes... ricotta... olives and peppers. [Thinking she already had the olives and peppers on lock down.]\\nC: OK, so tomatoes, olives, ricotta... and what else?

[Now self conscious and wondering if I look like a person that would eat a whole salad and a large pizza]\\n\\nNow I hand her the card I am paying with and she hands me back the slip to sign and a capless Sharpie marker. Now, for those of you that know how long my last name is, I would like you two explain to me how to sign my name on a small credit card slip with a dull Sharpie. I mange to make a large black blob on the signature line and sit down to wait.\\n\\nThe salad is ready and the shout over to me informing me of this fact. The person that took my order looked at me oddly since I wasn't getting up to get it. I said I also had a pizza, at which point her face went blank and she then squinted a little, tilted her head to the side, and said, \\"What kind?\\" I then looked at her blankly an in my head said, \\"Really? REALLY?!\\" I then started naming off the toppings and she turns and looks through the slips. \\"It's coming,\\" she says.\\n\\nThen a guy calls out my pizza a bit later. I go up to the counter and see a rather small box. I ask, \\"This is a large?\\" He then informs me that the pizza before me is a medium. I then tell him I ordered a large. He then looks at the slip and tells me that I did not order a large (which is an amazing feat for him to know for certain since he wasn't around when I ordered). I inform him that I most certainly did order a large since it was for three people. \\"Well we charged you for a medium,\\" he flat-out tells me. \\"But I needed a large,\\" I reply. After a long pause, he says, \\"If you really want, I will make you a large.\\" Since he made it sound like such a chore, I declined, telling him I didn't have time. Thankfully, I had a You've Been Yelped card in my pocket. I plopped it on the counter and left.\\n\\nI get the salad and pizza home and not only is the crust undercooked, the cheese isn't melted and the vegetables are still raw. The salad was rather nice with an assortment of leafy greens. It would have been nice if I had gotten the correct dressings that I ordered.\\n\\nI am very disappointed and underwhelmed. I wouldn't even have minded the fact That I had to turn my oven on and cook my pizza when I got home, but the lack of customer service and incorrect order just made things suck all the more.

Yes we're ladies, and yes we WILL destroy and enjoy some chicken wings!  Anyway - I pull up my Yelp app and it seemed that the best chicken wing places were a bit too far for our hungry selves to stand.  So where do we decided to head?  Flippers.  Pizza AND wings?  Amazing combination and conveniently located in SODO.  The three-star rating wasn't too impressive, but sometimes you just have to try something out yourself, right?  It was a Friday night and the place was packed; mainly large families, which is understandable because Flippers is a reasonably priced place.  Everyone looked so pleased, so happy to be at Flippers so we were sure we'd made the right decision.  We were seated in a booth and after a bit of a wait, ordered some wings and pizza and another friend ordered a pasta dish.  \\n\\nHunger pangs were seriously biting our bellies, so when the wings arrived we were more than eager to get going!  Only the wings were not crispy, they were soggy and not too hot either.  The server, most pleasant server I've come across (shout out to Alfred!), noticed something was wrong and we told him the dilemma and need for crispy wings.  No worries, Alfred's on it and he takes them back to the kitchen.  They return and they're STILL not crispy!  We have one each and the plate is left, sitting there, taunting us with saucy, soggy wings.  Alfie returns and apologizes, but has our main dishes to make-up for the wings.  Presentation was fine, the pizza looked nice and edible, but after the first bite I knew.  I knew I was going to be grumpy, I knew I was going to raise a stink, I knew we would leave Flippers hungry.  The pizza we ordered had our taste buds waiting on an explosion of flavors that would include sundried tomatoes, garlic, and veggies galore.  First, they didn't use shredded mozzarella, but sliced cheese to cover the pie.  The pizza too was undercooked and soggy and there was no distinct flavor except for tomato sauce, bland tomato sauce.  Major bummer.\\n\\n(Al)Fredo arrived, smile gleaming, and noticed everyone's food still on the table.  \\"Boxes?\\"  And with our look he knew.  I gave my commentary on how he had been an amazing server and that we were just out of luck with the food.  He gave us a percentage off the tab and a coupon for a free pizza.  We thought about asking if we could switch the free pizza for a free dessert since it probably wasn't made in-house and that would give us some hope for it being decent, but we opted to hit the road and find a dessert destination elsewhere.  On our way to dessert, my mind was so clouded with disappointment... I ran a red light.  It caused a chaotic outburst and then unlimited laughter.  I blame Flippers.  I'll be billing for emotional distress.\\n\\nMoral of the story: never choose convenience over distance!"},{"name":"Oppa Sushi","address":"185 Harvard Ave","city":"Boston","stars":"4.5","text":"Dope sushi place.

The servers are always so friendly and never seem like a request is too much, and as someone working in the hospitality industry, this is impressive to me. I always start with the spicy garlic edamame which has great flavor and a nice kick. My favorite roll is the Mardi Gras roll which is a good amount of filling and topped with spicy crawfish--yum! They have great happy hour specials, although you can only get these if you dine in so unfortunately I don't get to enjoy. My boyfriend is allergic to seafood so he typically eats the hibachi steak dinner which is delicious. Some slight cons for me: price because of course good sushi costs money. I can't justify spending $40 on a takeout dinner for myself so I typically get one special roll and one basic like the eel roll.

The small bits of apple inside of the apple cinnamon dough really come through with a strong cinnamon-sugar-apple flavor, which would have been enough for a 5-star appetizer.  Add the maple glaze to that and this thing got elevated to new heights.  The Cinnamon Roll was not on the Donut Holes level but it was still delicious.  The ginger and nutmeg come through and that caramel glaze makes each bite packed full of sweet deliciousness.  The Chimichanga was huge had an awesome taste.  It has a great mix of fresh ingredients, and when you add the goat cheese sour cream to that, it's quite the dish.  My Enmoladas were special.  The chicken mole inside of the tortillas had a great balance of sweetness and subtle heat that gave you different hints of flavor each bite.  This with the avocado salsa, cotija cheese with eggs on top forced me to finish the plate even though I wasn't hungry.  It tasted so good I couldn't stop.

The drunken wings were excellent--this is a great place to get wings without ending up covered in sauce. I was really excited to try the Brussels sprouts, but they were inedible. There were about three sprouts, charred on the outside and saturated with some kind of oily sauce.

It now has a dining room with the sleek modern look of a 21st Century eating place, complete with a wall-mounted flat screen TV often tuned in to a sports channel.  Other big differences between my high school days and now are the PRICES.  In 1965, a burger cost about 25 cents. . .and there were no \\"large\\" burgers at all.  However, even these days, I can still get good value from my McDonald's experience.

But we finally got the chance.  Right after the last Christmas eve service at my beloved Northland, we gave the pedal the metal treatment and roared down to Winter Park from Longwood, scattering frightened cyclists and pedestrians along the way.  So when we arrived before 9 o'clock to meet our daughter and her friend there, we weren't merely a mite peckish - we had BECOME where we dined! (You know: \\"rav______ ___\\"!)\\n\\nEven though they did not (could not) give us a reservation, the place was more than half empty when we got there.  Our daughter had gotten a table on the pub side - not as cozy as the dining room, but not obnoxiously loud either.  With it being so late, we quickly ordered the Charcuterie to share as a starter, subbed craft beer for wine, and looked through the scrumptious menu.  The beers were all great (smuttynose and a white ale of some kind); I ordered the Czech pilsner for my wife, thinking she doesn't care for heavier beers that are on the bitter side.  This one had a little more hops in it than she liked; so if you're not into that, avoid the pilsener.  \\"This has been a PSA for non-beer-drinkers...\\"\\n\\nWith a place as hyped up as this, there is always a risk - what if my expectations were set too high?  What if my taste and taste buds weren't manufactured to the same set of specs as my fellow Yelpers?  That'd be awkward if there are 4 gazillion 5-stars against my lone double-star!  \\n\\nMy fears were allayed even with the arrival of our charcuterie.  Decked out on a butcher block, our waiter took great care to explain everything we were about to devour (\\"the wild boar from which this salami was made was captured on October 9th at 4:16 in the afternoon in a forest 2 kilometers north of...\\") - it's all very nice, but we all felt like saying (well I did, anyway), \\"SHUT UP, Harrison, and let us EAT!!!  \\n\\nTime and a fading memory prevents me from proffering a blow-by-blow of all the delicious cured meats and terrines and pates that were snapped up only slightly more ceremoniously than a kill on the Serengeti - there were no menacing growls, nor claws flashed, and no teeth bared: just purrs from this contented pride.  At $23, it is on the pricey side for an app - not bad to share among 4 people price-wise, perhaps, but then it's not QUITE enough, especially when EVERYTHING was so good.\\n\\nDinner choices were 2 chestnut-filled gnocchi, an arctic char, and duck breast.  Sampling pretty much everything left no doubt: here's a high-quality, creative kitchen that knows a thing or two about making delicious meals.  From the texture of the dumpling on my duck to the delectable sauce the gnocchis were bathing in, everything exudes confidence and pride.  I was almost sorry that we didn't linger for dessert - the ladies didn't want any, can you believe?\\n\\nWe'll be back.  Now if I can make Sundays go away altogether!!  No wait, that would mean no church and no Sunday School...

The food is also very fresh, and each dish tastes slightly different every time you visit.  We especially love the Chiles Rellenos and Burrito Jalisco.  As soon as you're seated you're given warm tortilla chips and homemade salsa.  They have a full bar that is also inexpensive.  Their margaritas are delicious and only $2 during Happy Hour (4p-7p, Monday-Thursday).\\n\\nOutside of just the food, their service is fantastic.  You never wait long for your food or to be seated, and your drink never gets more than half empty. \\n\\nThe word has been spreading about this great place pretty rapidly, and they can be pretty crowded on Friday or Saturday nights.  I would avoid bringing kids after about 6:30 on a Friday or Saturday, it gets a little loud and crowded with drinkers.

Pretty generous serving as well - 4/5\\n\\nSliced lamb - Just average. Probably the same quality as you'd get as the all you can eat places. 3/5\\n\\nPork neck - This was a big let down. The meat wasn't very tender and the thickness of the slices didn't help.

Fish was super fresh and well cut with no discernible fishiness - 5/5\\n\\nVeggies and other stuff - Definitely a step above the all you can eat places. Veggies were fresh and looked it, compared to some places where it looks dark and old\\n\\nPork rib soup base - This was fantastic!

Same with another old couple.\\n\\nAnyways, we just wanted to test out their congee (jouk) so we ordered two kinds.  In hindsight, one order was more than enough.\\n\\nWe had the:\\n\\n- BBQ duck congee ($7)\\n- Shredded pork congee ($7)\\n- Chinese deep fried donut ($1.50)\\n\\nBoth were good but I preferred the bbq duck congee over the shredded pork.  Came with a bit of green onions.  Cheap and tasty jouk! Would like to have tried other dishes that is on the menu (which is extensive to say the least) but that's all we ordered.  I like how it's open pretty much all day and night!

It caught my eye because I had seen the concept being done in Manhattan and heard that it was here as well. To set up the review I have to first set up the process to get in the door. First things first, the concept is simple, it is an all inclusive meal ($100) that is reservation only, prepaid, and open only on Fridays and Saturdays. For the planners out there, this is perfect stuff. The inside is as if you are in the owners home and everyone sits at a very large table, think Thanksgiving dinner! The ambiance is great for a date or friends, as well as an opportunity to meet new people. Probably best to sit next to each other, since the table is rather large. \\n\\nOn to the food. When you get there around 7pm you will wait around 30 minutes to be sat and will be treated to an aperitif and small plates of appetizers to nosh on while waiting. At this point maybe the newness of the concept and the experience, I was already loving it (you can only do Sandlake/WP/DT for so long before you need to shake it up with tourist stuff!). The service was properly spaced and somehow with essentially a party of 22, it seemed to proceed seamlessly. For the first course I had a rare beef and horseradish selection on top of greens. It was excellent to say the least and the wine pairing was great. That was followed by grouper, tastily prepared spicy and with an accompaniment of mushrooms and squash. I really liked them both, but I loved the beef! Aaaah then my favorite, the cheese course............ I do not remember what the cheeses were anymore and did not want to totally dork out and start taking notes in phone, but the cheese, desert and wine pairing ended the meal on a high note. \\n\\nI will go back and take more detailed notes on the food but suffice to say you can tell that the owners have taken time to create a unique experience for us restaurant fatigued Orlando-ans, with great food and service. I think the place must be relatively new, since there has been no reviews yet too, so go check it out - preferably on a date!

As a vegetarian, there are a lot of great options.  I highly recommend the Teriyaki Tofu/Vegetable Bowl, but my favorite (and what I order all the time) is not technically on the menu.  I always get Tofu Yaki Udon, which is simply delicious.  Just ask for it.  If you're not a vegatarian, I recommend the beef or chicken Yaki Udon.\\n\\nHowever, I do have to say that I'm a regular customer, so I'm pretty miffed that they won't reduce the price even though tofu is obviously less expensive than meat.  Unfortunately, even at $9 dollars and change, I keep going back... again and again and again.  I'm going to miss this place when I move to NYC in a month.\\n\\nThe people are really nice.   In fact, I walk in and I don't even have to say anything, they see me and just jot down my normal order.   I do admit that it's not always the fastest service, but it's not really that slow, either.  HOWEVER, I know that if you have problems with your order and/or if you don't like your order... they are not good at dealing with it.  I've never had an order messed up, but I've witnessed it with other people.\\n\\nFinally, the sushi is not the best ever, but for the price... it's impossible to beat.

It can't get much better than that! We were able to get a table for 2 without a wait on a Friday night (although it was a snowstorm), and the restaurant was still pretty crowded. The ambience is nice, as the lights are dim and there are antiques throughout, which go well with the overall theme of the restaurant. We started with some wine, and there is a very nice selection of Italian wines. We weren't exactly sure which wine to go with and our server brought us a taste of two different wines, pretty hefty size pours to try. She provided us with recommendations for our appetizer and entrees, and helped us navigate the menu. We started with the Shrimp Grand Marnier ($13), which came as four jumbo shrimp, lightly egg battered and cooked in a sweet orange sauce and served over orange slices with crostini. All I can say is DELICIOUS! My husband and I both ordered off the specials. I ordered the Haddock Francese ($21), which was egg - battered haddock pan seared in a lemon white wine sauce and served with tomatoes, artichokes and capers. Instead of risotto I subbed for mixed vegetables and was given a nice portion of carrots, zucchini, yellow squash, and spinach. The meal was light but flavorful, exactly what I was looking for. My husband ordered the Miguel special, although he ordered it with veal instead of chicken ($22). The Veal was breaded with panko crumbs and panseared in a wine reduction sauce, cooked with three types of mushrooms and served over a bed of homemade gnocchi. WOW is all I can say. The Veal was perfectly tender, the sauce was sweet but savory and the Gnocchi was light and pillowy. The portion was huge and even my husband couldn't finish it.

I prefer Bamboo Grove and Kirin in Richmond but you're paying substantially more for a slight increase in quality and service. CNH has many specials throughout the day. I always order the Snow Pea Leaves in Garlic. Fresh spicy, salt crab is delicious but pricy. Reg crab is roughly 3lbs and sells for $15-21/lbs depending on season and is satisfying for 3 people. Deep Fried Squid with Salt & Chilli is also good but make sure you order a light healthy green dish to go with it or drink lots of water to cleanse the salt. When I'm sick or miserable from the rain I go for their congee. Dried Oyster, Preserved Egg & Shredded Pork and the House Special Seafood are my usual. The Steamed Chicken with Ginger & Green Onion is a traditional fav and great when you're sick as well. The Thai Fried Rice is excellent with a variety of seafood but I didn't find it very spicy despite the \\"chili\\" symbol in the meaning.

That's hardly a crime and they were both still very nice, but in a top-notch food town like Portland, that just doesn't quite cut it.

We got there just in time for Thursday's trivia. \\n\\nAbout the Trivia: They do trivia differently from others I've been to. There's 6 rounds of trivia and in each round they'll give you three categories. Your team decides how to set points to the question from 1, 3, 5 points in the first half and 2, 4, 6 in the second half. There's a half time rally question where you can get a lot more points added to the score. At the end there is a question that can be answered correctly either as a written answer or multiple choice. If you don't get it right you get docked points. We did really BAD but it was fun :)\\n\\nFood was good for bar food. Loved the chips! We also got some chicken wings... I thought the regular medium hot wings were the best over the others we tried. Service was good too. But we thought the waiters came to see us just about the same time the questions to the trivia were being asked. So convenient for them.. but at least one of our team members was listening for the question at all times... again it didn't matter since we did so poorly, haha. \\n\\nOther things: They have indoor and outdoor seating but most of the people were eating out, probably to people watch. They have trivia nights on both Tuesday and Thursday. They also have a bunch of other things going on throughout the week. I guess you can also take a Fur bus to some baseball games.

If you are looking for mexican/ texmex, this is not the place! First, they sat my family of five at a booth for four. When we asked for a table instead of a booth the hostess told us that because 3 of my party were kids, we could have a booth. Ok, odd but we were starving and just wanted to eat. We ordered 3 kids plates and some fajitas for my wife and me. After two glasses of tea we finally got some chips and some stuff that I guess was supposed to be salsa. It was like eating a pepper jelly of some kind instead of a salsa, no spice at all. Ok, not my kind of thing but the kids ate the chips while we waited for our food. Once the food finally came, the kids food was cold and the cheese was hard and looked like a tortilla with a piece of cheese and some pace salsa on top. Our fajitas came, or at least the meat did, we had to ask twice for the sides and tortillas and when they finally got around to it, they brought us 3 tortillas for 2 people and wanted to charge extra for more! Over all the worst dinning experience I have ever had. This place was far from busy, maybe only had maybe a third of the tables taken. We asked for a manager and told him the issues we had. He was apologetic but failed to offer any realistic solution.  Free desert won't save cold food and lazy service.

The overall experience and prices were less desirable however. I'd only been in this location once before when it was 8 on State and the set up of this place just makes it terribly noisy as it was built for the sound of a movie theater. Our waitress was nice but seemed a bit overwhelmed as there were times we didn't know where she was. Ordered beers, good local craft selection,  and she came back with both and one of them was partially full as the keg had just blown. We were offered to have the beer and order another at no extra cost which was great. Menu is petty standard for bbq with ribs, chicken, turkey, pulled pork, corn bread, greens, etc.  I feel like some of the prices are a little steep but they are very generous portions. If you just want good Q without any frills you can get it cheaper elsewhere. I ordered the half chicken platter with brisket baked beans and collared greens (platter comes with 2 sides).  Other meal was pulled pork with broccoli and Mac n cheese. This is where the service started to get bad. Another server came over and set down plates and walked away. Never asked who had what but just at them down. Wouldn't have been a big deal but it wasn't our food. It took a few minutes to flag down our server to inform them of the mistake. When our food did arrive the other order didn't have broccoli but mixed veggies. When we asked about the mix up we were told that they had run out and we were supposed to have been informed by our server (I think this was the manager we were speaking with) and they gave us the closest substitute. Big problem as that person has food allergies to onions. He was very apologetic and offered to remake the whole platter but we didn't find it necessary but to just  replate the food and asked for cornbread instead. We now had to wait another few minutes to get this plate back out. Finally able to eat and the food is GOOD. Beans were great, Mac n Cheese excellent, chicken moist, and cornbread more like a moist cake texture which I really liked. I was not a fan of the greens however as they must've used cider vinegar which gave an overpowering sweet and vinegar taste. Overall I'd give food a 7/10. When we asked for the check we got it and it still had the beer on there (didn't order another one) and not even an offer of a discount for the vegetable mix up.

The flavor was terrible - very basic pork taste, no spice or herb in the dumpling. Sorely disappointing experience. The menu isn't big at all, and most everything was overpriced. Do yourself a favor, take the Red Line to Park Street, walk over a few blocks to Chinatown and get yourself some authentic, huge, flavorful soup dumplings.

Poor service.  Bad food (ex: bones found in fish sticks)\\n\\nThe first thing that enticed me about Ranch 616 was the ambiance.  It was the first warm night in Austin and they were already playing live music on the patio (in February!), so i figured this place had to be great.  The inside is retro and ecclectic- which is becoming the standard in Austin as opposed to unique.  But i digress- on to the dining experience.  \\n\\nIt was terrible.  The service took forever.  When the waiter finally came to take our order- all he said was \\"Do you know what you want?\\"  As someone who is easily influenced by the power of suggestion, he lost out on us ordering drinks of appetizers.  I was immediately put off by his haste.  When the food came, we sat without silverware until we could flag down a bus boy to bring us some.\\n\\nI ordered the fish tacos.  Who would've thought you can mess up fish tacos in TX?  The fish was fried (strike 1), with BONES in it (strike 2!  Bones?  in fish sticks?  are you kidding me?!) , and they were doused in the (extremely spicy) chili lime aioli.  Not to mention they were served with onion rings.  Someone needs to inform their chef that onion rings and fish tacos do not go together.\\n\\nThe esposo ordered the pork tenderloin.  Although the description sounds good- the flavors just don't work.

That's the only thing that saved it from falling into a one star rank. But let me tell you right now, that I won't be going back to this place. It's just not worth the \\"savings\\".\\n\\nThere were glaring clues that this place would not offer very good sushi at its cheap price and the shabby exterior and interior. It usually just shows that the owner doesn't care about restaurant. I don't know why I didn't stick to my gut feeling. I guess, like other people, I had a slight hope that maybe, just maybe, this one would be the hole-in-the-wall that was an exception. \\n\\nAnother alarming thing is that this place has a strangely fishy smell. It wasn't delicious fish-smell. It was a fishy smell, mixed with a vinegary smell and one of rice... It's hard to describe.  It's not a pleasant smell. Anyway, I'll just leave it at that. i\\n\\nAbout the food then, at $5.50 you do get 18pcs sushi combo with miso soup. But the soup is cold and tasted gross. And the sushi comes half wrapped with hard rice and pieces that fall apart or stick to other things. I am not sure if this is because there was an assistant and it wasn't the owner who made my food, but that's not really an excuse. The combo isn't very good. You get two 6 pcs rolls of a decent size (like regular Cali rolls) but you also get 6 really small kappa rolls. \\n\\nAlso, I didn't get any especially great service that other reviewers were talking about. It almost looks like sushiboy is having a bad day because I didn't really get one friendly smile the entire time I was here. Also, I guess I am a little upset that we got our food slower than the people who ordered after us.

When I was in middle school, I had to take a school bus, and in the afternoon, my bus driver always took the Greenlawn exit from 71 - which runs right next to Thurn's.

I got the veggie kind, it came with rice, black beans, onions, peppers, queso fresco and avocado. The mojito sauce was creamy and garlicky, reminiscent of a tzatziki with cilantro in. This thing was GOOD, the best thing I ate here by far(not that anything was bad here)\\n\\nVenezuelan tequenos: who doesn't love a good deep fried cheese stick from time to time. This was firm, white, savory cheese(could have been Oaxaca, mozzarella, string cheese, ect) wrapped in very slightly sweet dough and deep fried.

The black bean and cheese was my favorite, followed by the beef then chicken, which was a tiny bit on the dry side as shredded chicken often is.\\n\\nPicada-Colombian style: Meat mountain hooray! Steak was juicy and flavorful, not sure what cut of beef this was and it did have a fair amount of gristle but there was still plenty of edible beef. The chorizo was nicely spiced and pretty mild, no gristle detected here. The chicharron was good, these home style pork rinds are not for wimps though. The skin layer was crunchy, the fatty layer was mostly melty, sometime chewy, most pieces had a jerky like layer of pork meat. The yuca was great, they were a lot like thin oven fries. The tostones were not my favorite a little dry and slightly lacking in flavor. All in all its a solid dish, a bit pricey but it's enough food that 3-4 people could easily share it as an appetizer/tapa.\\n\\nSteak pinchos: Steak on a stick with chimichurri and few grape tomatoes. Not sure about the cut type here either but it was definitely higher quality than the beef in the picada, as reflected in the price to meat ratio.

When we brought this to their attention, the server seemed apologetic in an \\"oh no, I'm sorry you don't like it\\" way, but didn't offer to do anything to fix it. Since we didn't want to create a stink, and we enoy their miso soup, we inquired about the possibility of getting an additional soup in lieu of the undrinkable tea-drink. The woman just timidly said that all orders are final and that they have zero-exceptions for fixing or swapping foods. Even when we explained that what we were given was not what we ordered (since they told us about the lack-of-bubbles after we had paid) and had offered an alternative, she said that her hands were tied. When we asked if we could speak to a manager about it, she nervously looked like she knew what was about to happen. \\n\\nFive minutes later the manager/owner came out to our table. We politely explained what had happened and she basically told us that all ingredients are subject to change at any time, and if they have to substitute ingredients, that's their right, with zero rights to refunds or advance explanation. I asked her if this was true for everything, and if I had paid for tuna and they ran out, would they give me my rolls with Imitation Krab instead? She basically said yes, that was her right (and I believe she probably would). She then rudely reiterated that if we wanted another soup we could stand in line again and pay for one.\\n\\nWe finished our meal in disbelief of their (lack of) customer service skills, and left. Needless to say, we don't plan on wasting more of our money here, and would suggest that you don't either."},{"name":"McDonald's","address":"2875 SE Powell Blvd","city":"Portland","stars":"2","text":"Mac is back!

The green tea...they use leaf...which means it probably cost them $3 to buy the entire canister of tea leafs, in which they charge that to their customers. Dont order any of their damn ramen either. If you're craving ramen -decent ramen, go into HMART right down the street and eat at the food court there. Not only is it cheaper inside HMART, but you at least feel like you ate your moneys worth.

But I'm getting ahead of myself.\\n\\nAfter an evening of walking the seawall with two out of town guests we stopped in here for a few drinks.  We were seated inside facing the patio.  Not long after we'd settled in a group consisting of two over the top drunk girls and the men who they were \\"escorting\\" were seated on the patio.  They caught our attention immediately and it was clear that the girls had drank way too much already and needed to leave.  The two girls proceeded to slur loudly at each other, paw at each other and disrupt everyone's evening. One of the girls decided to take her breasts out and place them ON THE TABLE.  We watched as every other table on the patio cleared out.  Another table requested that the manager speak with them.  We overheard General Manager Scott tell them to try and calm down a little and that if they came back tomorrow he'd buy them all caesars.  After he left one girl spat out some food she was eating and threw it into the street.\\n\\nThe section we are sitting in has cleared completely by now, except for us.  My two friends go into the bathroom where they find the two drunk girls.  One of them decided to pee with the bathroom stall open and then walk out with her pants down and flash her vagina at everyone.\\n\\nWe've had enough now and request to speak to the manager.  And this is where it gets really really crazy.  Scott comes over and introduces himself.  We explain that these people are out of control and need to leave.  He tells us that he's not really working right now, and that he's taken his tie off and was just sitting at the bar.  He's talked to that table but what more could he do? Oh I don't know... HOW ABOUT YOUR JOB? All three of us told Scott stories, breasts on the table, how rude and loud they were, and seeing one girls vagina in the bathroom. Scott's response is - \\"well whatever happens in the bathroom isn't my problem\\".  And then Scott told us that one of the men at the table was a regular.  We repeated to Scott that their behaviour was unacceptable and that he was also doing an awful job as a manager and we'd be complaining. \\n\\nScott came back a 2nd time to argue with us again about how he did make an effort to calm them down, and again bringing up that one of them was a regular.  Then he finally went and told the drunk table to leave.  Which the drunks didn't take well and called us crazy as they obviously knew we had complained.\\n\\nThen Scott came back a third time to inform us that he had comped our bill - the first responsible action as a manager. \\n\\nIf he had diffused the situation from the beginning none of us would have gotten upset.  Thanks Scott for treating the three of us as inferior because we hadn't frequented your restaurant on a regular basis.   Had Scott not spoken to us in this manner or excused the behaviour I would give The Hurricane Grill another chance.

Already perturbed, I was hoping the food would come out sooner. It took an hour and 5 minutes before our food arrived from when we sat down. I'm usually pretty patient but no one should not be waiting over an hour to get a simple brunch item that can be made at home in 10 minutes. Also, keep in mind that during this whole time, we have not eaten anything and our waitress ignores our table the entire time, tending to other tables without batting an eye at us. Luckily, a different waiter came to refill our water twice so we weren't dehydrated. \\n\\nFrom my seat, I watched as 2 girls who got a table at the patio area 20 minutes after we arrived got their menus and orders taken within a matter of 5 minutes. They also got their food a lot faster than us and were paying the bill around the time we got our food. Perhaps patio people get better service because they're closer to the front. Perhaps we were hidden and forgotten in the back. In any case, it was frustrating. Someone who I assume was the general manager came by to apologize for the kitchen being backed up and I informed him we had been waiting an hour. He apologized and came back to say my entree would be deducted. That lessened my annoyance a little bit but our waitress wasn't aware of this so she brought the check with all items on it. She of course quickly had the check fixed.\\n\\nIn all, the food was decent, the service was subpar, and the outright disregard for our needs as customers was fully experienced.

The kibbe was prepared with layer of soft and tender pumpkin stuffed with spinach, sauteed onions, soft chickpeas, spices and topped with another layer of pumpkin then baked making for a delicious and very filling dinner. The dish was also served with a side salad drizzled with a flavorful mustard vinaigrette dressing! I have to say this pumpkin may have just made the list of my middle eastern favorites. I might even willingly endure the trip to BC  again just for this dish (yes it was truly that good).\\nIn the end all the hassle ended up being well worth it, as we left  the restaurant happy and very full!\\nSabra is a family owned restaurant open for lunch and dinner and is moderately priced. The restaurant is a bit more upscale  in atmosphere and pricing compared to some of the smaller middle eastern restaurants I frequent, but it's definitely delicious. The restaurant offers a $10 lunch buffet that I definitely suggest, it's very affordable plus you get to try a little bit of everything and who doesn't like that. However, do be warned expect to be absolutely worthless and ridiculously full of food after finishing your meal. The food is just too good and not finishing your meal just seems wrong.

The server did have a laptop out (no lie) which seemed a little inappropriate, but he was still attentive. My dining companion and I split the Dumpling Room and fried pork style, as well as a dessert dumpling. The savories were juicy and the sliced ginger and scallions on top were great. Apparently they recently they got rid of soup dumplings. The sweets fried up nicely and provided prime sinful eating. It all comes down to price/portion parity, even two more savory dumplings per order would have been enough.  \\n\\nIt wouldn't have been been such a big deal, but if they can offer $1 dumplings after 11PM and assumably turn a profit then its a simple indicator that they're a marked-up game.

The restaurant located right on Pearl, the space is very open, and the whole place has a very appealing visual aesthetic. Would 10/10 recommend this place- great service, great food, great beer.

Coming in a long compostable box, it was immediately clear that these poutines are well-equipped for takeout. Upon opening the box, I can't say it was the prettiest scene inside but that's poutine for you. The cheese curds were not as squeaky as I liked, and I think there should have been more gravy. The small amount that was present was pretty good, but that just increases the agony when you get to the dry parts of the poutine. As for the toppings, I think the pulled pork tasted better than the bacon mushroom. The pulled pork had some juice to it while the bacon mushroom just tasted pretty charred. One box for each of us wasn't enough to make either of us full, so if you do dine here for a meal consider getting a Jumbo size instead of a Regular ($4 more). Compared to Belgian Fries or Smoke's Poutinerie, I think the gravy is much more generous at these other restaurants and I would have enjoyed Frites' poutines more had there been more gravy."},{"name":"Karl's Sausage Kitchen & European Market","address":"1 Bourbon St","city":"Peabody","stars":"4.5","text":"I've been having a really bad week, and somehow discovering this gem completely washed all my bad feelings away.

I've been dying to try this out for years. \\n\\nEnter Cathay Pacific Restaurant. It is unlike any Chinese restaurant I have been to before. There's a lounge inside but it felt more like a nightclub. I didn't go but there was a dress to impress sign, a live soul band and a crowd of clubbers outside and in. They even had karaoke. Wooooo~.\\n\\nNow don't get all excited. Cathay isn't fancy. It feels like 1 AM in Reno or a cheap 24 hour restaurant in Vegas. I might even say its like a Chinese Denny's. The service was excellent and the food came out fast. We got a Pu Pu platter and an order of Peking Ravioli. That's another thing in Massachusetts. The names of the dishes are different than in NY and CA. Peking Ravioli is dumplings and pot stickers. The Pu Pu platter had everything from spareribs to chicken wings and fried shrimp. It was great.\\n\\nCathay Pacific also has a bunch of themed drinks. From scorpion bowls to drinks in tiki gods, its a full on Polynesian bar! Our friend's mai tai was wrapped in a lei. Talk about festive!\\n\\nThe overall feel of Cathay Pacific is like being at a carnival buffet. There's corn dogs, funnel cake, pop corn, and cotton candy. You can have it all as an appetizer. You eat it all. You get distracted by games and music. And then down everything with a giant lemonade and then go for a deep fried twinkie. That's pretty much what Cathay Pacific has to offer. All the junk but it is Chinese food.

At the end of the meal I tried to brush things off and order a last beverage but it took several minutes until I decided to just cancel it.

They didn't even have guacamole. Can you imagine a Mexican style restaurant without guacamole?  I mean there is a huge ethnic market right up the street...they could have walked 5 mins and got some. The salsa was way too watery (it wouldn't even stay on the chip) and the fried plantain patties we got as an appetizer tasted like they were cooked the day before or longer. I never had something so bland and dry. I ordered a chicken quesadilla which actually wasn't bad but the rice was super sticky and hard (I had one bite) and the beans were in a teeny tiny little bowl (I swear it help no more than 10 beans).

I've been there twice now: once on a Saturday date night with my husband, and once again last night with my parents. Suffice it to say they're still talking about the meal this morning and how outstanding it was. It's incredible you can get food like this without driving to the North End and paying three times as much.\\n\\nYou would never guess that this corner lot location in East Lynn with a blinking neon 'open' sign houses a warm, cozy dining room with a rural Italian feel. The lights are low (but not too low to read your menu), the colored glass chandeliers glimmer, and the cream colored plaster walls complement the dark wood floors and trim. It's a small dining room, but it's not bad to be so close to the neighboring tables when the other diners are exclaiming in delight that this is the best meal that they have ever eaten (I'm not kidding). \\n\\nIt's a pretty standard Italian menu, but everything I've tried is excellent. Appetizers we've had include antipasto, mussels marinara, and Antique Table clams. The dishes are beautifully presented, and I guarantee you will be asking for extra rounds of bread to soak up the marinara sauce. The shellfish are cooked perfectly -- they don't have that weird rubbery texture, they're just tender and delicious.  \\n\\nWe've tried several entrees now. The eggplant parmesan is declared by my father and the neighboring diner to be the best they have ever eaten. Baked haddock, which sounds so boring, is completely transformed into flavorful, perfect flakes of white fish. Gnocchi Basilico and orechiette with sausage have their own distinct and rich flavors, tomatoes flavoring the gnocchi, and broccoli rabe contributes to the orechiette. The gnocchi was browned a little bit on one side for extra flavor, and the tomato sauce is complex and interesting. My mother offered a piece of her Lobster Ravioli, with big chunks of lobster inside, but I didn't want to stop tasting my own gnocchi and it's superb sauce.\\n\\nFriendly and attentive service -- your water glass will never be empty, and your placemat never becomes too dirty without being replaced -- a full bar and a nice wine list, great ambience, incredible food -- and it's in Lynn! This is worth driving out of Boston for. Just go, give these guys some business, they deserve it and you won't regret it.

I then notice there is only one \\"hot box\\" of food and realize the order is short. I tried to explain, but I believe it was lost on the gentleman. They were nice enough to give us two side hot chili sauces, which I later realized was because the order was not spiced at all. So all in all for $20 and a simple togo order I ended up with a box of soaking wet salad and barely enough mild pad thai for us to share.

They have good food, attentive service, a fun atmosphere, decor that's on the groovy-Austin tip.  They have a great outdoor space with occasional live music, and a location that is near-impossible to beat.  I've been here dozens of times.\\n\\nSo why the mediocre star-count for this review?\\n\\nThere are a few things that need to be addressed at Ranch 616.  We were there on a recent night with a large party, and while solid, the food didn't live up to the heights I know it can.\\n\\nTo start on a positive note - the service was expertly handled by one extremely busy waiter.  He was on top of everything, and made the night a breeze.  Many kudos to him - I hope the guy who picked up the check gave him a good tip (I bet he did - I happen to know this fellow).\\n\\nBut the food?  I believe the menu needs some major refreshing.  It hasn't really changed at all since I moved to Austin almost a decade ago.  The \\"divorced trout\\" and the gigantic fish tacos and the huge chicken fried steaks - that once seemed like fresh and innovative takes on Texas classics -  now just seem dated and boring.  The menu relies too much on the deep fryer (which is fun in small doses, but this is overkill) and is really heavy handed with the sides and garnishes.  Each dish is just kind of a mess of stuff on a huge plate.\\n\\nOur appetizer was a large plate of fried stuff - there were jalapenos, french fries, bacon-wrapped shrimp, oysters, etc. on the big platter, with multiple types of ranch dressing.  OK for a starter, if not a little heavy.  I found it a little boring, except for the truffled french fries.  Truffled fries are always welcome at my table.  The Caesar salad, once one of the best in Austin, was a gloppy, salty mess with no lemony tang.  It wasn't tossed, and was entirely overdressed.  A dreadful dish.\\n\\nWe had many glasses of wine, they have a great house Pinot Noir that was going down all too easily.\\n\\nMain dishes were an improvement on the starters.  I had the special chicken breast.  It was fine, but like most other things on the menu, it came with PEPPERS and BACON and CHEESE and SHRIMP and MASHED POTATOES.  Not that it wasn't tasty, it's just overkill.  It took some work to find the actual chicken part.  My partner got a ribeye that was THE SIZE OF YOUR HEAD served on top of CHEESE ENCHILADAS and MASHED POTATOES with THE OPTION OF A FRIED EGG ON IT.  It was really delicious.  But it seems like the only thing you can order here is a SUPER TEXAS VERSION of regular food.\\n\\nWe skipped dessert (how could you eat dessert after a meal like this?), and left with full bellies and hard-working livers.\\n\\nThis place gets 3 stars because it's got great service and perfectly good food, but it's turned boring.  When the whole meal is shouting at you to TASTE ME AND LOOK HOW BIG I AM, any idea of delicacy or sophistication is lost. I know that the over-the-top Texas diner thing is their calling card, but it could use some revitalizing. I hope, instead of leaning on these tired gimmicks, Ranch can rediscover its creative side sometime soon.  It is falling behind in an increasingly competitive food city."},{"name":"Presso Coffee Bar","address":"2020 N Mcclellan St","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"Cute place but clearly designed with the intention of being posted to social media.

Fried Okra was super crispy and good amount of  batter. We had the banana pudding for dessert, it was probably the most disappointing of the dishes because it was all cookies and was likely made this morning b/c the cookies hadn't gotten soft yet but it was still very tasty and a great way to end our meal.

Now I know why.\\n\\nTo start, this place didn't really get the greatest reviews on Yelp. That's okay though because Mexican food is pretty hard to mess up right? Wrong.\\n\\nI began by ordering a Dos Equis on draft. Never in my life have I been so disappointed in a beer. Never mind that it was served in a Sam Adams glass, that was the least of my concerns. This \\"beer\\" didn't actually taste like beer. In fact, it didn't taste like anything at all. My water had more flavor than this beer. So so sad.\\n\\nMy girlfriend ordered their house margarita which should have been the only redeeming quality of this place considering that their website domain name is bestmargaritas.com. I don't know how much they paid for that domain name but it's clearly false advertising and a waste of money. It tasted more like sour mix more than anything else and Selma even had to ask if there was alcohol in there. What is happening right now?\\n\\nOh gosh the food. By this point, I forgot we even ordered the food. We got the enchiladas because we wanted to play it safe (even though Yelp told us not to). I got the pulled pork enchiladas and Selma got the steak. The sauce was really overpowering. \\n\\nAny finally, if that wasn't bad enough, our friend ordered the steak fajitas and instead received chicken. Our waiters response was \\"it's going to take too long to cook the steak.\\" At this point, all we could do was laugh at the whole situation.\\n\\nThe best part was when the bill came. It was probably the kitchens fault that the order got messed up but he still tried to charge us for the steak and put up a fight when we asked to simply have it changed to what we received, not what we ordered.\\n\\nMy 1 star yelp review was pretty generous given the tragedy that unfolded that evening.

But I'll round up to 4.  Great food and lovely service, but pretty overrated and VERY overpriced.  This is not the best food in Orlando, by any stretch. But it is pretty damn good:) My meal peaked during the appetizer course. Jason and I shared a charcuterie plate that was FANTASTIC. The chicken liver mousse was incredible, though Jason thought it was too strong and bordering on rancid (in other words, not for all palettes:)). I love the fact that all their sausages and meaty wonders are made from scratch, and they are well paired with some great stinky cheese.  Grilled bread and fresh pickles round out an exquisite eating experience. I plan to get this as an entree next time and have a true 5-star meal. And also, I'll get some of those delicious gruyere biscuits (yum). Now, on to the hit-and-miss main courses.  I had a steak, which was perfectly prepared--but it was pretty small and not over-the-top delicious.  It came with a root vegetable mash that was the best thing on the plate. Jason had the enormous, slightly unfortunate Pork Porterhouse.  Yes, I know it's sacrilegious to diss one of the PIg's most beloved entrees, but it didn't quite work.  In its defense, it's an ENORMOUS slab of pork, and it is cooked to absolutely perfection.  The texture of this meat--and the care and technique that went into it--should not be overlooked. However, the smokey flavor was so overpowering, it made the dish taste like really high end deli meat.  Seriously, the flavor reminded me of smoked turkey you buy in a plastic box at Publix.  What a shame!  Had they limited the smokiness and focused on the flavor of the meat itself, this would have probably been one of the best pork dishes I've ever tasted.  It was served with an adventurous-sounding gratin of turnip greens, dusted with a green-tea powder.  Interesting, definitely...but not something I really wanted to keep eating.  Their beer selection is great, but the cocktail I ordered was overpriced and didn't live up to its namesake name.  When I read the words \\"bacon-infused bourbon,\\" I expect an actual bacon-y taste from the PIg's signature cocktail.  Sadly, it just tasted like regular old hooch.  I will say, however, that it WAS a strong concoction and definitely did the job.  We will absolutely go back, but will probably order off the less-expensive pub menu. It's just not worth it to pay $30 or more for food that doesn't wow me.  Don't get me wrong. It's a great place.  Just don't expect Top-Chef mind-blowing, and look for a way to save money while there...going all out (this was our who-cares-about-a-budget Valentine's meal) might lead to disappointment.

Once you arrive in the parking lot you can't help but to Encompass the amazing smell of the smokers. Walking into the establishment you are greeted by smiling faces and wonderful employees. City Barbeque has an award-winning slab of ribs that is to die for. The sides that are available are there slow cook collards, the smoked baked beans, the amazing potato salad that is created with redskin potatoes, and make sure you save room for dessert. I was told by the restaurant owner that when it comes to eating their ribs a fork is not needed if you ask for a fork then you will be politely told that it is at the end of your arm, hands only. I give this restaurant a 5-star rating for the customer service, the great food, and the amazing atmosphere. City Barbeque go check it out........."},{"name":"Jonae's Island Twist","address":"4775 W Irlo Bronson Memorial Hwy, Ste B","city":"Kissimmee","stars":"3.5","text":"I love this place!

The restaurant is pretty sparsely decorated and has an overall \\"bare bones\\" feel. Service is laconic.\\n\\nOur table started with the seaweed salad and the fried tofu, both of which were pretty bland. For ramen, we shared the #2 spicy miso ramen and the #8 spicy veggie ramen. We actually really enjoyed both of them because they had nice broths and good toppings. Two main issues: too little broth and the noodles were too soft. The bowls weren't even close to being full.\\n\\nWe would have given Kanji 4 stars because we did enjoy the ramen, but the value here is off. Why are you charging Tatsu-ya prices (even a bit more) when you're giving less broth in a pretty dull space? 3 stars."},{"name":"Tuscan Kitchen - Seaport","address":"64 Seaport Blvd","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"I visited seaport tuscan kitchen jan 27 2018 and had a horrible dining experience.   We ordered the octopus appetizer which was incredibly small, not enough for four people to sample,  smaller than  my baby finger.  We also order the cheese board for 28.00 that had very thin pieces of meat, certainly not worth the money.   All the portions of the food were  ridiculously small for the prices.  My gnocchi had 7 piece of pasta with very little boar gravy underneath probably 2 tablespoons, more like a small appetizer. Ridiculous for how much pasta cost.  My brother ordered the veal chop with a side of broccolini.  He ordered it medium.  It was put on the table practically raw, it looked like it was put on the grill and turned once, then on to the plate.  It was uncooked/raw.  It was taken back to the kitchen.  The other meal was ossco buco , there was no shank, a tiny piece of bone with nothing on it.  My husbands plate looked like he had ordered only root vegetables, very little meat in the dish.   The  veal chop was brought back to the table, by this time,  all 3 of us were already done eating... and the veal chop  was still raw,  my brother  could not eat it.   We flagged down the waitress who took it back, by this time he lost his appetite.  He ended up eating broccolini for dinner only,  by himself,  as  the 3 of us, were finished with our minuscule meals much earlier.   At the end of the night the manager stopped by for a minute, and said he would take the veal chop off the bill......  Really it was inedible....   and my brother ate a few trees of broccolini by himself for dinner...     We are Italian and were looking forward to our dining experience  at Tuscan Kitchen, however, it was unacceptable for a high end dining experience....  if Tuscan Kitchen's are planning on faring well in Boston.... the establishment must change their  practices.  I look forward to hearing back from the management of tuscan kitchens,...."},{"name":"Porcinis Italian Restaurant","address":"68 School St","city":"Watertown","stars":"4","text":"For those of you wanting to get straight to the point, the food here is great, service is great, but the redhead hostess with British accent made us feel cheap for using an Eversave promotion, totally missing the point that these deals are meant to attract new customer to the restaurant.\\n\\nFor a more details, read on: \\n\\nMy boyfriend T and I discovered Porcini restaurant because of  an Eversave deal (we bought 2 Eversaves at the same time). The restaurant had good ratings on Yelp, so we decided to give it a try.\\n\\nWe were seated on a patio, which was decorated like a countryside yard and had a very nice cozy feel to it. Our waitress (also hostess) was a redhead with a British accent. She was polite and clearly took pride in restaurant and her job, and it was very nice to see. T ordered a glass of wine and a tomato-based risotto with meatballs, while I had a roasted half chicken with veggies in a simple sauce. The risotto was not what T expected, and he did not finish it. I am not a fan of risotto at all, but I tried a meatball and it was delicious.  My chicken was just perfect! Flourless chocolate cake with white chocolate layer was good. \\n\\nWhen we asked for the bill, T opened his mouth to say we have a coupon, but the redhead interrupted him with a snappy \\"Oh, yes, I know, I could tell as soon as you walked in the door\\". WHAT?!? What exactly is that supposed to mean?!? We were caught totally off guard with this unexpected turn of generally pleasant and attentive service, and both felt very offended. We are not the kind of people that repay rude attitude with same, so we just paid the bill (which had 20% gratuity automatically added because of the coupon) and left.\\n\\nIf the restaurant does not want customers to use Eversaves , why would they participate in the program in the first place? Restaurants get exposure and, hopefully, new customers through such program. This is their chance to attract clients that may not have ever discovered or tried that restaurant otherwise. It's their chance to earn our loyalty! Well, not with that kind of attitude!\\nI said I'll never go back there, and we should just get rid of the second coupon to that place, but T suggested we give them another chance, and at least get some entertainment out of the redhead's antics.\\n\\nWe went back two weeks later, and, surprise-surprise, the redhead greeted us at the door with \\"Oh, do you have another coupon\\"? Me, tongue-in-cheek: \\"Yes, could you tell as soon as we walked through the door?\\" Redhead: \\"There aren't that many people using coupons, so I could guess who has them from our list\\". T and I exchanged a look of guilty accomplices and giggled - how much worse can it get? The redhead did not disappoint: \\"I don't expect you will be back after using this coupon\\". T: \\"What makes you think that?\\". Redhead:\\"Oh, I just have a feeling\\". T: \\"Well, if the food is great and the service is pleasant, then why not?\\" Clearly, she did not get this hint.\\n\\nDespite numerous empty tables we got seated right next to the kitchen and cash register, where there is a lot of noise from the kitchen and constant waitress traffic. The redhead left us and a lovely Andrea brought us water. We asked to be reseated in a more cozy area, and she obliged.\\n\\nThe phylo pastry appetizer with wild mushrooms and cream cheese was heavenly, and I had a glass of Rose. T got another special of chicken breast with capers and artichokes, and it was a bit tangy for his palate, but still good. My steak with blue cheese and grilled vaggie was cooked perfectly medium-rare and was absolutely deliggtful!  \\n\\nThroughout our meal I watched redhead buttefly between all other tables chatting up the customers, joking, taking pictures and laughing. I overhear dher saying the she recently got promoted from a waitress to a hostess because of her people skills. Bwa-ha-ha!!! Guess which table she did not stop by? Yes, ours. That was ok, as Andrea was attentive and pleasant, with no trace of redhead's attitude.  At the end our our bill was only discounted by $20 instead of full $40 value of Eversave, but Andrea quickly corrected that.\\n\\nIn summary, we could have recommended this restaurant to \\"full-price-paying\\" customers on the basis of excellent food and good service from Andrea. However, if you have a coupon of any kind, be prepared for the redhead to make you feel cheap and unwelcome. We are certainly not planning on being back there, since the redhead has clearly missed the point of earning new customers through promotions. Condescending attitude can spoil even the most amazing food!"},{"name":"Dots Cafe","address":"2521 SE Clinton St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Some hits and misses on this visit--overall, a decent dining experience I'd actually give 3.5 stars. My partner and I went for the late-night happy hour food menu (11pm-1am), which requires you to purchase a drink.

My partner got the French Lemonade. We were fairly warned, but the anise taste of the latter's \\"dash of Pernod\\" was still more overwhelming than expected.\\n\\nFood: \\n--The Thai Chicken Skewers (HH $4) were well-flavored on their own, but I thought the peanut-ginger (?) sauce that accompanied it was too salty. The chicken itself was a bit rubbery. But, again, $4. \\n--The Chicken Wings with Chinatown sauce (HH $5) were on the sweet side, which my partner and I enjoyed, with a lot of meat on the bone. The small veggies (shredded carrots, lightly-pickled cucumbers, unidentified also-shredded third party veg) that came with this dish and the above were a nice \\"garnish\\" to the chicken. \\n--The Trio ($6): good side salad (greens, some shredded carrots, and our chosen honey goat cheese dressing, which was mild and didn't necessarily taste like either of its named ingredients), pretty terrible soup (loaded baked potato, really watery, really un-hearty), and great grilled cheese (lots of cheese, maybe colby jack).\\n\\nAtmosphere: dark, not too noisy, \\"retro.\\""},{"name":"Mattie's","address":"811 W Live Oak St","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"The property is gorgeous.

For $30, I got a nice big salad, a petit filet mignon (4 oz) with sauteed green beans and potatoes au gratin, and a huge vanilla creme brulee that I shared with my husband and we still could barely finish it! The filet mignon was so tender, like beef marshmellows (if that sounds yummy to you), the potatoes were not too mushy and perfectly cheesy, the creme brulee was served with a big bowl of fresh chantilly cream (a dessert from heaven!), and the salad was very fresh with candied walnuts and dried cranberries. The walnuts were a little too candied for my taste because there was so much sugar on them, they were a bit hard for me to chew. \\n\\nI love the ambiance of the restaurant as well, but it's really the great food and even better service that brings us back time and time again. Our waiter was super helpful, jovial, and he gave us 10% off just because it was our anniversary! \\n\\nIf you're looking for a place to celebrate something special, I can't think of a better place to go!

She explained that she was taking the orders, cooking the food, and making deliveries. This is obviously not a sustainable practice for this employee, the restaurant, or for a person or business that orders food from this place regularly. Beyond the poor staffing and strained service of this place the food is also substandard. They are consistently out of lamb (a staple of Mediterranean food), the salad is always overdressed ands has to be drained before eating it, and the meat is over salted and over cooked. While many people like to eat overdressed, over salted, and over cooked food I prefer healthier options. In the future when the office staff orders from Poppin Pita I will be eating somewhere else."},{"name":"Vij's Restaurant","address":"3106 Cambie Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4","text":"Consistent Quality Experience!

Yes, 8AM sounds early but if you can get yourself out of bed, you will be rewarded with bottomless coffee and some of the most satisfying breakfast that the city has to offer. My go to is the Veggie Pesto ($12) and the bottomless coffee ($2.75). This combo will leave you well satisfied for around $15 and the amount of food you get is well worth it. \\nThe veggie pesto is just as good every time I go. Sweet potatoes, onions, whole garlic cloves, and mushrooms scrambled into a generous serving of eggs. You then have the option of potato cakes or grits (Pro Tip: You can get a little bit of both) and a biscuit that requires you to smother it with the homemade raspberry jam that'll be on the table. The coffee comes from Portland Coffee Roasters and is a very balanced medium blend that lends itself to endless sipping for the duration of your meal. \\nEvery time that I have gone here (more times than I can count), the food has consistently exceeded my expectations. The service is always very friendly and the atmosphere is casual. Every time that I go, I tell myself that I'm going to try something new, but always end up with the veggie pesto, barely finishing it, and remembering again why I love this place so much.

Delicious salsa verde, great chips & yummy margaritas. Crispy tacos were also great. Incredibly nice service, very friendly, good people.\\n\\nThe bad: They don't serve refried beans with their meals, The salsa that came with the chips, while fresh, was neither spicy enough nor salty enough. They serve potatoes as a side dish instead of Spanish rice. The rice they DO serve is white rice, which is weird for a Mexican restaurant. Finally, and this is a temporary issue, they are horribly understaffed for the crowds they're getting too much for the staff they have. Dinner took 90 minutes for what should have been a thirty minute meal at most. But that's easily solved.

We were all greeted with smiles as we walked up with the pooch and were seated immediately. The staff was very welcoming and they made the dog feel very comfortable by petting him and telling him how cute he was ( he loves to hear that). Shortly after we were seated our waiter came back with a dog bowl filled with water which made him very happy on this hot day. \\n\\nOur waiter was awesome, he offered many drink suggestions I decided on a feminine version of the Moscow Mule which was delicious. We both decided on light meals since the alcohol provided a decent amount of calories. I ordered the Caesar Salad and  added grilled shrimp, and my friend had a salad with chicken added on. The lettuce was fresh and the Caesar dressing was creamy with a good flavor, I enjoyed every bite of my salad. My friend said she also enjoyed her meal.\\n\\nOverall, we had a great experience.

That's how we decided to go to Rooster's -- after all, it is a fun and casual joint.\\n\\nWe went on a Wednesday Evening -- so it wasn't too packed, and the place was alive with some action. The waitress was quick to seat us, and was able to get our drink orders and appetizers within a relatively quick amount of time. \\n\\nThe place is as traditional of a sports bar, mixed with the Americana-theme restaurants as one can get. It definitely has the feel of a campus sports pub, but also has the feeling that it really is a local joint. What surprised me is unlike other wing places, it felt like it belonged in Columbus -- it belonged near campus, and that, in no way, is a bad thing.\\n\\nWhile the food was pretty bland, we didn't do ourselves the favor of going there to get wings -- we were on a appetizers-only trip. Now had I had the wings...I probably would have had a completely different story to tell you. But as it were, it was just a good place to get a couple beers and discuss what we had been doing all of our lives. \\n\\nI would like to go back to Roosters, if for no other reason, because it is, in fact, a fun and casual joint. When its quiet, and just serves as a good old fashioned sports bar, it really hits the spot for a place to hang out and have a little chicken. However, I'm not sure I'd want to see it when the Buckeyes are playing...as it definitely has the potential to get real crazy, real fast..."},{"name":"Chick-fil-A","address":"7700 Spine Rd, Rm TS3-3","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3.5","text":"Supremely incompetent staff and an absolutely terrible location.

He finally got up and asked me what I wanted to drink. Server came to my table and I ordered breadsticks with extra garlic butter. They came out perfect. I then ordered Ricotta Meatballs. These came out and the meatballs where completely dried out as was the ricotta. I took 1 bite and slid the food aside.  When I was getting up, the manager asked how was the food and I told him it that the meatballs were horrible . He couldn't have cared a less. He never bothered to get up and come look at them or offer to correct them. I can accept food that is poorly prepared but I can not accept a manager who just doesn't care. \\nSide note: apparently this is the managers last day at this store.

My son ordered the pulled pork and pronounced it the best he'd ever had.  My steak was cooked to perfection (medium rare); the brazed edges designed to spice up, but not overpower, the exceptional beef.  It is served with a hollandaise which can change up the tastes.  The thinly-cut potato fries are spiced with truffle, which added an amazing after-punch to each morsel.  Vinegar softened them, but ketchup seemed criminal.

We had 8pm reservations and arrived on time and they actually seated us immediately, I find it disturbing that any restaurant takes a specific time reservation and than makes you sit around waiting for a table. Our hostess told us we would be waited on by 'Blanca' and she arrived quickly and introduced herself to us. We began by ordering drinks my wife had a Cosmo and I had a Sazerac, both were excellent so were going to come back simply to sit at the bar one evening and relax. I also ordered a nice Malbec to go with my meal which was a perfect accompaniment to my steak. \\n\\nBlanca began by offered suggestions on appetizers and small plates and we each chose the French Onion soup, it was a hearty soup full of flavor and the Gruyere cheese on top was delightful. Our small plate was their Lobster Tempura, at times this item could be a disaster but Fleming's made it to perfection. A very good portion of lobster with a side sauce, this dish could easily be consumed with ease by 4, for two there was a lot and that was a good thing. For our mains my wife ordered the small filet med-rare, and according to my wife was cooked to perfection. As ordering a steak has become a nightmare for me, not to spoil our night my wife asked Blanca if their chef could make steak 'Pittsburgh\\", she answered yes and commented that it was charred with a rare center, I asked if they could prepare it  \\"Rare Plus\\" which is slightly past the rare stage and perfect for a Pittsburgh steak. When the steak arrived to my table, it was easy to see that it was Pittsburgh, it had a nice layer of char that you can hear when you ran your knife over it, the inside was perfect a little past rare. I was floored that I found another restaurant in Orlando that actually knows how to prepare steaks, so now I have 2 options for a steak.  \\n\\nWe finished our meal with a great desert, their Chocolate Lava cake. I had never ordered such a thing but have seen it often. Its paired with a vanilla ice cream or fresh whipped cream, the whipped cream was a better choice for the chocolate as the ice cream overpowered the delicate nature of the cake. \\n\\nWe extremely enjoyed our dinner at Fleming's and will be return soon. As I'm well aware this is a chain but our experience was over the top based on what we've come to expect from most Orlando restaurants. Maybe this particular location away from the tourist caters to a more personal clientele of locals and their specifics, but overall I would have say Fleming's is worth it for any occasion."},{"name":"The Matador","address":"1438 NW 23rd Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"The Matador was pretty good, and I wanted to give it 31/2 stars, but it will not allow it.

About a few minutes after we had decided what we wanted to eat. The bartender, a female with a crescent moon tattoo on her left arm, walked over to us and asked us what we wanted. We told her our order and then she told us that the happy hour menu was not available. I explained the menu time discrepancy and she told us the only menu we could order from was a later night menu. And then she handed it to us. She was clearly having a bad day, and was not friendly. She did not offer us a drink or even water. We sat for about 10 minutes thinking about the new menu of only tacos for double the price of happy hour. The bartender never returned and never offered us anything to drink. (We were the ONLY people sitting at the bar and one of only 3 parties in the bar). So, we yelped a new restaurant. Called ahead to make sure they were serving food. And we left.

The soft boiled egg was a bit overdone without much yolk to work into the salad.  For the entree I had the Bone in Short-Rib.  This was fantastic.  Perfectly done, nice glaze.

My sister ordered the lobster bisque which was more of a low country stew. It lacked flavor and tasted so fishy that it was impossible to eat more than a few bites. It was practically lobster water. She also ordered a large gatherer salad. The salad wasn't horrible - the dressing was nice but the granola in the salad was a stretch. My mom had the shrimp tacos.

When it comes to strictly donuts and nothing else, my favorite chain is Krispy Kreme.  And the Krispy Kreme I usually go to is this one.  It's located across the street from the West End Mall and about a block from the West End MARTA transit station.  It's in a predominately black neighborhood that has a few really nice apartments close to the transit station but a lot of lower-income areas close by.  \\n\\nI've only purchased donuts there and have not tried their coffee.  The restaurant is clean, has a drive thru, a lobby entrance and is open daily from 5 am until 11 pm.

I do remember going there last year and seeing a political candidate campaigning inside but even then it wasn't that big of a deal.  The last time I was there I bought a dozen assorted donuts (four with chocolate frosting, four with pink frosting, and four more with raspberry filling for a little more than $11.  \\n\\nPeople in Atlanta are always debating which is better:  Krispy Kreme or Dunkin' Donuts.  For me, I prefer Krispy Kreme (and it's not even close) when it comes to donuts.  For breakfast sandwiches, I like Dunkin' Donuts.

We met up at Ginza and while it's in a terrible area of town and the outside is less then impressive, let's face it, I'm here to eat so who cares what the neighborhood looks like if the restaurant's good. \\n\\nOne more note about the area before I move on- it's just like any other Orlando neighborhood; a mixed crowd near some less-than-savory characters. I suggest parking on the street as the back parking lot isn't well lit, well-paved, or from what I can tell, well-monitored. The inside of the restaurant, though, is really nice, cool decor, decent vibe, spacious. Enough about looks, I'm here to eat!\\n\\nThe food was very good- I do find it hard to tell the difference between the meals at the hibachi grills, they all kind of taste the same to me. That's not necessarily a bad thing, though. No complaints here about the food. I had the filet and chicken combo for...wait for it...$18.50. Yes, that's filet MIGNON and chicken. With the soup, the salad, the rice and noodles (anyone else wonder why rice AND noodles?), and veggies. Awesomeness. \\n\\nEven though we were there for Easter, the restaurant still offered a great special my friend took advantage of- $13.95 for chicken, steak and shrimp plus all the sides and apps mentioned above. VERY big portions too- I had enough food to take home for two additional meals. Yes, the food still tasted good as leftovers (which almost never happens with hibachi). The menu is definitely reasonably priced and while I didn't try any, they also offer a full sushi menu. \\n\\nThe service was...an experience. Everyone was very friendly, but what a poorly managed wreck! I don't blame the servers, it didn't seem there was any organization whatsoever. With only 1.5 full hibachi tables in the restaurant, you would think 3 servers, 2 hostesses and the manager? owner? could handle 12 guests. That, unfortunately, wasn't the case though. Before I rant, I want to say thank you to our head server Justin, who definitely redeemed the experience and had common sense, a great personality and memory. Ask for him.\\n\\nEveryone else though? W-O-W. I've seen problems in restaurants when there's a dedicated server to a table, and team serving.I couldn't quite tell you what was going on at Ginza, though we were asked at least three times from three different people what we wanted to drink, eat, etc. 12 PEOPLE! The staff wasn't busy, they were standing around watching, so why were we playing table-tag with the food and drinks? I like attentiveness, but this was ridiculous. Pick a table and serve it, or everyone in the restaurant take 1 person at the table or figure out SOMETHING. The other issue was that the same servers would come back after they had already taken our order and try to ask what we wanted again...and never bring it. All very odd. \\n\\nSuggestion to the owner: Promote Justin, and organize yourselves. Even great food at a good price isn't going to continually keep me coming back to chaos. You can't fully understand the confusion unless you experience it. I hope it was just a one time thing (perhaps they thought training an entire new set of staff on a quieter night was a good idea?). \\n\\nAll in all, A- for food; B for effort; D for service (Justin, A for you); B- for the environment; A+ for pricing."},{"name":"Tony's Fish & Oyster Cafe","address":"1511 Anderson Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"3.5","text":"I went to this restaurant today to satisfy my craving for fish and chips.

The price is not exactly cheap, but still reasonable.

The yam fries fortunately were quite tasty - crispy and mildly sweet - and well worth the extra $2 substitution.\\n\\nHalibut ($11.99):\\n4/5\\nThis was much better than the salmon. The fish was juicy, better-seasoned, flavourful, and most importantly, did not have any fishy smell whatsoever.

In the beginning, we ordered a bottle of wine before deciding on our food. The wine was alright but would've preferred a more extensive wine list. We ordered the foie gras starter to share and it was great(this is where the only star comes from, strictly from the foie gras starter). It was rich and melt in your mouth, we thoroughly enjoyed it. The night went downhill from here.\\n\\nThe Mrs's ordered the rib eye and I ordered the veal. The veal was nicely cooked but the flavor was bland and was lacking any type of flavor. Her rib eye was an absolute disaster, it tasted rubbery and overcooked. The flavor was alright but the cut of meat was horrendous. After cutting the rib eye right in the middle, it was clear to us that the meat was cooked medium-well, instead of the medium-rare that we've requested. We flagged the server and the server flagged his manager to come talk with us. We told the manager what was wrong with her rib eye and the manager was adamant that there was 'nothing wrong' with it and that they 'serve the best rib eye in Vancouver', and how 'that's how rib eyes are suppose to taste like'. The manager had an extremely pretentious snobby attitude and talked to us like we've never eaten at a 'good' restaurant before. \\n\\nAfter insisting there was 'nothing wrong' he reluctantly took the rib eye back and came back 5 minutes after and said 'there was nothing wrong' and 'the chef and I both tasted it and it tastes fine but maybe it was slightly overcooked'. He admitted it was 'slightly' overcooked but it was still 'fine'. He wanted to give us our rib eye back, which we suggested to order another thing on the menu since it's now been touched by the chef and manager, and it's now cold. Again, he reluctantly agrees. \\n\\nIt definitely made the rest of the dinner uncomfortable since the manager kept trying to argue with us that nothing was wrong with their rib eye and that's how its suppose to taste. I definitely will NOT be coming back to Au Comptoir. The food was well below average and their manager had a very snobby and pretentious attitude. I understand that you can't cook a steak perfectly every time but when you're arguing with the customer and admitting it was overcooked and STILL continue to argue that it's 'fine', that's just bad service.\\n\\nThere's too many good restaurants in Vancouver.

I got the ribs with grits and greens. The ribs were good with a noticeable smoke ring although I found it odd they don't mention on the menu whether they are spare or back ribs (it appears they only offer spare). The grits were solid but unremarkable. The real low point were the greens which had so much vinegar they were nearly inedible and rendered the greens and pork with no unique flavor of their own. Similarly their BBQ sauces which appeared not to have HFCS (a good thing) lacked any real depth of flavor and all tasted very similar. \\n\\nMost disappointing was my mothers brisket platter - it had a very small portion of grey, tough brisket.

If you're not a morning person, my suggestion to you, don't work brunch. Our server was a newer server with lack of personality and menu knowledge. I have been in the service industry for 10+ years and I understand its almost impossible to know the answer to every question a guest may ask in the beginning, but something as simple as knowing if its possible to change the way an egg is cooked should be the first thing you should know pertaining to the brunch menu.  Lack of menu knowledge=unapplied server, someone who doesn't really care about their job. I ordered the eggs beny and the Canadian bacon tasted like it had been frozen and then thawed out (freezer burned). The singer also seemed tired and unenthusiastic and was smoking cigarettes the whole time in between songs.

I had their Pineapple Sweet & Sour Pork on Steamed Rice (which I upgraded to Fried Rice for an extra $2.5) and their B.B.Q. Duck with Noodle. The food was actually quite good, and the prices are reasonable given the quality and portion sizes. Unfortunately, what really soured my experience was the rather poor service. Since I was a single diner, I had to share a table with a few other diners, which is understandable as they have mainly large tables at the restaurant. However, they were quite slow in cleaning the tables, and I found myself sitting with a pile of dirty dishes from a previous diner right next to me. Moreover, the staff were very inattentive and never checked once on our table other than to bring the food. One of the other diners that I was sharing the table with asked for her bill and I swear she waited probably 15 minutes before the server finally arrived with her bill. I seriously felt sorry for her. All in all, while I really did like the food, the lackluster service prevents me from whole-heartedly recommending this place.\\n\\nPineapple Sweet & Sour Pork on Steamed Rice ($12.50 + $2.50 for fried rice):\\n4/5\\nThe pork was very good: it was tender, meaty and quite crispy wihtout an overly thick batter. The sauce was thick, and had a good balance between sweet and tangy. I got the dish with fried rice for an extra $2.50, and although the rice was quite tasty and had a nice savoury flavour, I actually don't think that you need to have it as the sauce was very flavourful and probably would be better paired with plain rice. Although a bit on the pricier side, the portion that they provide is fairly generous, and given the quality, I do think it's worth the cost.\\n\\nB.B.Q. Duck with Noodle ($10):\\n4/5\\nThey have two versions, either the the noodles in soup or with the soup on the side - I had mine with the soup on the side. The noodles had a very nice bouncy texture.

I usually order the bowls which you can opt to have with different meats but I wanted to try something different since they have such a large menu, well that's when things started to go wrong.  The first menu when I opened the first page was nasty with old food splattered on the pages to the point I couldn't read what was behind the splatter. I didn't let that discourage me, I simply requested another menu. Well if that wasn't bad enough the second menu was just as dirty. Now my stomach is starting to be upset by the visual I had been provided with twice. My girlfriend gave me her menu to read which wasn't clean either but it was the best out of 3. Now needless to say after the menu ordeal I still ordered what was familiar....the shrimp bowl. The food arrived looking delicious as ever and I'm ready to dig in. I unfolded my silverware and my fork was dirty with old food stuck on it. Now I'm really trying my hardest to not be grossed out by my experience so I go get a second set of flatware myself since my server had gone off to get his other customers food and low and be hold the second set was even worst. I'm not sure how either of these things from the menu to the silverware get over looked other pure neglect and poor housekeeping.  We showed the server things we had experienced and requested Edgar to express our concern to management. When Edgar returned with the bill we asked had he conveyed our concerns to management,  he said he did. He said she stated she was busy and couldn't come upstairs to speak with us but we could come downstairs to see her (I believe her name was Niyella. Probably not correct spelling).

My friend was choking and later was sick on the stomach and had headaches from the fumes.

Thermostat worked very well and kept the temperature exactly where I wanted it. There are multiple lamps so you can adjust the lighting as you wish. I also loved how they have these automatic sensor lights which turn on as you go near them - no need to fear tripping all over the place when you go to the washroom in the middle of the night!\\n\\nI had a corner room on a top floor, so in the beginning it was almost shockingly quiet. However, I realized quite quickly afterwards that the walls were far from being even remotely soundproof. A group of girls took the room next to mine, and all night I could unfortunately hear snatches of their conversation. Needless to say, I did not have a good sleep.\\n\\nAmenities (fitness centre, pool) are all pretty awesome as well. Unfortunately I was stuck most of the time in the Convention Centre - which was not as nice. In particular, at some times of the day it would be FREEZING inside some (but only some) of the rooms.

You could tell that all the staff had been trained in customer service and were super friendly and informative. Even during periods when the hotel was busy and hectic, there were employees around every corner to help out with a smile. There was however one notable exception to this rule - HOUSEKEEPING. I found them pretty rude, and somewhat incompetent. A few time during my stay I came back to find that the towels had not been replaced. Then I had to call several times to ask them to replace the towels. This took about an hour. Not fun.\\n\\nThe only other gripe I have is that the hotel is way too big (just kidding).

I noticed the menu had not changed since my last visit in June, it is changed only seasonally.  I was hoping that mid-week (Tues) would mean a wait-free experience, but it was not to be.  We didn't arrive until after about 7:00pm due to an afternoon city tour and ended up waiting in the lounge for about 45 minutes during which I imbibed not one, but two Leeloos (Bombay East Gin, Aperol, passionfruit, lemon, cherry; $12.50).  All prices are in Canadian Dollars.  I also had the chance to try some of the infamous passed while-you-wait complimentary appetizers I've been hearing so much about: pakoras, papyri chat (x2), cassava fries with spices (x2).  All yum!  My friend and I each ordered an appetizer-- Jackfruit (in black cardamom and cumin curry, $13.50) and Eggplant (in thick garlic and yogurt curry, $13.50), but sampled both.  We got our initial naan with chutneys, and then asked for a second to ensure no waste of a single drop of the curries.  At this point, I was pretty well satisfied, so decided not to order a main, but my friend ordered the Grilled Vegetables (on semolina noodles and lentil pilaf with kalonji curry, $19).  A third round of the warm, pillowy naan was requested and brought- all still complimentary!  I quaffed 2 glasses of that tasty Pink Elephant rose (a 2014 from Okanagan Valley, BC, $12) with dinner!

The tray of chips and sauces (3 kinds, so no squabbling) came out immediately and the kids were instantly happy. Parents too because it was tasty. We also typically repetitive stress trying to keep the kids quiet and civil... Basically we try to be considerate of others by not being noisy. But there was a mariachi band. On a Tuesday no less. So not only were we entertained but the music drowned out any level of loudness my children contributed. \\n\\nSpeaking of the mariachi band, they were both very good and very nice. They asked us if we wanted a song. The kids couldn't think of anything for them to play so the did the chicken dance.   in hindsight, we should have asked if they could play Remember Me from Coco. \\n\\nThe food... Was fantastic. \\n\\nI ordered the fajitas (no regrets) and my husband the chili  relleno which he very much enjoyed. The kids split a quesadilla and some beans and rice. It looked good but they were so busy eating, so we didn't ask. We even had to get a second plate of beans and rice. \\n\\nIn all it was both a great meal and experience.\\n\\nOther notes: \\n- Outdoor seating was available, but it was just too hot that day for us.\\n-the whole place is painted with sugar skulls and Frida Kahlo.

Plus, the people there are very nice. Rebecca is the manager and always comes by and asks if everything was ok. The ambiance is wonderful. So you're probably wondering why I gave it 4 stars this time? Honestly, I still loved the meal, but can see that they are starting to make noticeable changes to the menu and don't think they're necessarily for the better. You see, I love the food here so much and expect it be so great, that any change MUST maintain that level of quality. Perhaps I'm being unfair, but its almost as if the restaurant has defined its own expectations. There are THREE noticeable changes I saw being made and will list them herein detail:\\n\\n1. Bacon on the Wedge Cobb salad: typically, when you order a Wedge Cobb, it comes out with a lovely wedge of lettuce, bacon, onion, tomato, and AMAZING blue cheese dressing and a CHILLED FORK. Why is the fork chilled? Because the salad is BEST COLD. The bacon has always followed this rule - cold and crispy. However, for some reason they have no gotten rid of that and serve it with THICK, STEAMING bacon. The bacon is so thick is resembles a steak. The salad is no longer cold and chilled. The bacon isn't seamless and hidden in the chilled contents. Its oozing out steam in an otherwise chilled salad. To me, this change makes no sense. The chilled crispy bacon was amazing - if it ain't broke....\\n\\n2. Thin fries??? No. For the past few years, Fleming's had the BEST FRIES IN ORLANDO. No joke. The fries were seasoned perfectly and the perfect texture (moist, but not too moist and the perfect thickness. But now, all of a sudden, they are ultra thin??? no no. Again, as with the bacon above, why change a perfect thing??? \\n\\n3. On special occasions, they used to give you a cute box with chocolate truffles inside.  They know give you a cute box with...pieces of carrot cake inside.  Still yummy, but nowhere near as nice as the chocolate truffles were.  Just my 2 cents :)\\n\\nPlease know that #1 and 2 above aren't deal breakers - I still love the place and will keep going there. But its no longer as dominant a place as it was. I can only hope they undo these changes. I told the manager (not Becky) of these issues and he said \\"good eye, yes those are 2 recent changes we've made to the menu\\". I tried as politely as possible to communicate my dissent. I suppose we'll know in the future if anyone else agrees with me, if they go back"},{"name":"Bob Likes Thai Food","address":"3755 Main St","city":"Vancouver","stars":"3.5","text":"Very nice very nice!

Evidence of their approach to service: (1) When I called to see if they were open, they told me immediately that they were in \\"test\\" mode so patience would be necessary, instead of being unaware or uncommunicative on that front; (2) on the phone, when I arrived, and at the table, I always felt like I had each person's full attention and like I was not being rushed when they were working with me; (2) Patty Chen herself came out of the kitchen to say, genuinely kindly, that today was not a good day for folks who only had a half hour to grab lunch since she wasn't going to cut corners on the quality of the food; (3) waters and menus arrived with a delay, but the latter arrived immediately when we asked for them.\\n\\n--Food--\\nI'm not a dumpling connoisseur, but I am a huge, huge dumpling fan. In short, they were way tasty. The \\"soupy pork buns\\" were not soupy (which I didn't care about, and the waiter(owner?) mentioned that fact when we ordered) but were our clear favorites. The kimchi pork tasted, deliciously, like chorizo. The House dumplings with pork and shrimp were great, with chunks of shrimp in them.  Three plates (of six dumplings each) for two people was just about right for lunch. I desperately want to try to Nutella and banana dumplings, and hope that they eventually expand their menu beyond maybe 10 current dumpling options, to cater to repeat customers.\\n\\n--Ambiance--\\nVibrantly patterned red and white wallpaper, big windows, metal chairs.

On the rare occasion that I buy lunch at work, though, Panera usually wins.\\n\\nToday was a trainwreck of a morning, so I didn't have time to pack lunch, and on my way to work, I decided I would try Chipotle. Especially after watching \\"America's Next Great Restaurant\\" and hearing Steve Els talk about his Mexican grill chain, I was tempted to put this place to the test against my favorite burrito joint. \\n\\nChipotle was everything its CEO and founder promised and more. The location was clean. The menu was insanely simple. All four service staff behind the counter were pleasantly friendly and cheerful. \\n\\nThe ingredients looked fresh, and I had the choice of customizing my chicken burrito several different ways: salsa, beans, rice, cheese, sour cream, lettuce, guacamole... all kinds of options. I opted for rice, no beans, cheese, sour cream, mild pico de gallo salsa and guacamole (at an extra charge). Everything was bundled up efficiently in a substantial, but extremely well-wrapped, burrito. I was in and out in under five minutes -- including the time it took me to ponder the menu. This Chipotle location certainly has the system down to a fine science.\\n\\nI walked out extremely pleased with my experience and anxious to get back to my desk and devour my (hopefully) tasty lunch.\\n\\nMan, it was tasty. My burrito was extremely satisfying and slightly spicy. I think it was gone in the same five minutes it took me to purchase it.\\n\\nFinal verdict: Chipotle is a good option for a quick burrito fix. I thought it was slightly overpriced (compared to my regular burrito haunt, Anna's Taqueria), but the ingredients seemed to be slightly better quality. It didn't feel quite as authentic, but the service was definitely friendlier and less chaotic.

I'd had my eye on this bright yellow truck after passing it quite often on my commute. I was just waiting for the right morning to check it out. Today, I finally stopped by, and had a great experience. \\n\\nThe service: A+\\nThe two women working were so friendly and gave me some guidance about popular menu items (Corned Beef Hash and The Wrap) as well as the patience as I took a while to decide. I ended up going with The Wrap ($8.50), a chocolate dipped icebox cookie (1.50) and a coffee ($2). \\n\\nThe food: B+/A-\\nThe Wrap is HUGE! It could easily be split between two people and I enjoyed every bite of it (for both lunch and dinner). The Wrap is stuffed with potatoes, onions, peppers, cheese, 2 eggs, pulled pork, and wrap sauce. All of these flavors were delicious and each added something to the the wrap as a whole. My only complaint is how greasy the wrap was. I could see how this would be a great hangover meal but it's a little much for a casual, quick lunch. I would have preferred less grease and maybe a little crunch or crispness on the potatoes. That being said, the pork was tender, the cheese was flavorful and the sauce complimented well. All of this is well wrapped in a 12\\" white or wheat tortilla that could sustain your hunger for a day or two. \\nThe cookie was soft, not too crumbly, and I loved the chocolate coating. I actually got a couple extra of these for housemates to try for breakfast tomorrow morning. \\nThe coffee was strong and reminded me of good old diner coffee. It was serviced hot and had a great boldness to it to wake me up on a stormy afternoon. \\n\\nOverall, I'd recommend everything that I had at Hash It Out. The Wrap is a great value, the cookies and coffee are solid and the service is excellent. I love supporting carts that treat their customers like friends and family and are generous with their prices and portions. Hash It Out belongs here and is worth supporting."},{"name":"Maudie‚Äôs Hacienda","address":"9911 Brodie Ln, Ste 900","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"I used to place Maudie's as one of my top fajita factories in town.

(She was fine by the way.  Service was average.)\\n\\nWhat I got was a plate of peppers and onions with some large chunks of tough, sinewy beef and forgettable sides. \\n\\nThe beef wasn't charred per typical fajita preparation. Rather it tasted like it was sitting in a bin waiting to be plated. Then the few pieces I got were huge. They were not cut on the bias and I had to chew and chew and the sinew would not let go of the meat. I don't know if they've switched to a lower quality of meat but even if they at least cut the meat into small strips and grilled it correctly, it would have yielded to my teeth. \\n\\nInstead I take awkward bites of my fajita taco and the meat won't cut so it comes out all at once, then I chew and chew only to have a super unpleasant swallowing experience. \\n\\nMy date's meal wasn't much either. That's a  $40 mistake I won't make again. \\n\\nSo long Maudie's. Lupe Tortillas has better fajitas anyway.\\n\\n(Note: Although posting it today, I actually did write this the day after going.

Because I have no idea what dim sum is.\\nI am not cultured, I am not well traveled. I am a poor girl from the hood. Not everybody gets frequent flyer miles.

I also had the Thai Tea which is super awesome. Its uber sweet and kinda spicy. not tooooo spicy like eating a chili pepper, but like it might have a little hot spice... maybe cayenne or chili powder..... idk. Someone give me their recipe please. It is very warming even though its on ice.\\nand of course I had the seseme balls. I would take a dosen home if it wouldn't cost 15 bucks. so I only got 4 not knowing if they would be big or small. They were kinda in between. I think 5 bucks is a lot of money, but since I was full and ended up taking two home, I think 5 bucks for 4 is good.\\nPersonally everything..... other than the tea was somewhere between bland and flavorful.  So half a star off for bland and another half a star off for the 12 bucks that i spent on my lunch. should have been no more than 10 bucks, but that's a personal problem i guess. I'll be back though.

We also had to witness one of the cooks screaming at his coworker which was uncomfortable to say the least. The food, however, was fantastic which is why we gave it another try about a month later - we understood that the place was new and needed to work out some kinks.

The lettuce was fairly large sizes that were hard to eat, not very fresh due to the brown spots and obvious bug bites in the leaves and did  not appear to be well washed prior to serving.  The parmesan tuile tasted musty and could be either attributed to a lack of freshness or a poor cheese quality.

After searching and searching, I found Alfredo's and saw its favorable reviews, and off we went. \\n\\nI was hesitant about Alfredo's because of its location and appearance. Its on Cheshire Bridge which is more known for clubs, sex stores, and tatoo parlors than great restaurants. Also, the outside is a average brick building with no adornment, and only a small awning that tells you its name. But it had such good reviews that I thought we'd try it anyway.\\n\\nThe ambience inside is exactly like an old-school New Jersey Italian restaurant, at least that's what my partner told me, I having no experience with such things. It reminded me more of my grandmother's basement with wood paneling, pictures covering every inch of wall space. Me being used to squeaky clean Italian chains was taken aback at first, but then it grew on me. I loved how cozy and familiar it felt, not sterile and whitewashed like most other places. Also, the menu has nothing exciting or brand new. Its basically most Italian dish staples like lasagna, spaghetti, etc. but I don't care about those things as long as the food tastes good.\\n\\nThe service was AMAZING! From the moment we entered to the moment we paid the bill the same guy waited on us and was very prompt with anything we needed. And that was the beginning of the amazing.\\n\\nAs others have said, the garlic bread was amazing and fresh, not just thrown into an oven and served. We had the calimari as an appetizer, and it was addictive. Crunchy and served with fresh lemons to squeeze on top and marinara. Yum!\\n\\nAnd then for dinner, I had lasagna while my partner had a pesto pasta that had prosciutto and mushrooms. This was the best lasagna I had ever had. Made simply with no extra ingredients, it was just prepared perfectly, with creamy cheeses and flavorful marinara. Mmm!

If you don't know what that is, then you're not a native Texan! It's basically the food you would serve if Willie Nelson, George Straight or Ann Richards came over for dinner; a delightfully Texas twist on a mash up of southern and Tex Mex cuisine.  You want enchiladas, it'll come traditional or the cowboy way (with chili). Craving tamales? You'll get'em wrapped in banana leaves and served with arroz, borracho beans and crema. How about Frito pie? It won't come in an open bag of fried corn chips, but in a big 'ol bowl layered with homemade chili, pico, jalepeno crema and shredded cheese. Frog legs, seafood, quail and burgers all served up ranch style.  Stay for dessert as the fried pie of the day is to die for!

I have been a fan of Banzai since its original location was on the Drag.  It's not the best sushi ever, but has great value.  The miso is yummy, and the sushi pieces are generous in size.  I dream about their salmon skin roll (\\"Crazy Roll\\")- it is to die for.  I would have never ordered anything with salmon skin (that's usually the part of salmon I avoid), but had a friend insist that I try it.  The salmon skin is crispy and crunchy with eel also inside.  I am also a fan of the Shrimp Tempura w/ Basil Roll- who would have ever thought of putting basil in a roll?  It adds a very delicate flavor. \\n\\nThe only thing that I've had there other than sushi was the shrimp and vegetable tempura, which was also pretty good, but not anything super-special or different from other places.  I've never gotten any of their bowls, so I can't speak to those at all. \\n\\nMy husband and I generally order to go- 2 rolls, 6 or so pieces, 2 misos, a seaweed salad, and edamame and spend roughly $45.  It's certainly a fair price in comparison to other sushi restaurants.  Then pair that with a nice bottle of sake and you have a dinner that you could have spent $120 for at another sushi restaurant.

It was pouring rain, and there was little cover or room inside to wait, so we wandered over to Fuel  for a coffee(different review coming on that).  It actually ended up taking an hour ten or so to get a table. Well they seated us at the bar, which we would have preferred not to, because my husband's bad back, but there really wasn't a choice. The bar stools were larger and more comfortable than we thought so that was a pleasant surprise. Hooks for your jacket. Very Dog friendly which was great. Little dogs seated with their owners at the table, dogs drinking out of bowls, Adoptable dog pictures on the wall, a doggie menu. Very cute touch. The menu was interesting and the food coming out seemed large. I ordered fresh squeezed OJ , and the tea coffee and water were all self serve which was nice.  I got the Salm I am with the cheesy grits  and tried the veggie gravy on the side, my husband got the veggie pesto with potato cakes. Our waiter was good, friendly, fast. The food was quite flavorful , fresh and tasty. Was it a good brunch? Yes, but was it the best I have had in Portland? no, but it was good. Lots of salmon in mine and the gravy was made right .  The potato cakes were nice and crispy.  The cream cheese was freshly made and there were really nice large cloves  of  garlic in both of ours. The biscuit was good to great  on the inside, but  I found it a little too crisp on the outside/ top ( they should put a damp towel over them in the oven while they sit, I think) but it was good.

We ordered alot because it was a buffet and we didn't finish all of it then the staff began talk bad about us in chinese. I guess, they believed we couldn't understand. Overall, it is a good place for seafood if you don't mind the flies. I'm never going back to this place. The price was reasonable for the portions you receive. Its around $20 something per person because they charge $20 then also for the soup."},{"name":"El Patron Mexican Restaurant & Cantina","address":"12167 S Apopka Vineland Rd","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"Good food, and lots of it.

By the time we left there was six groups and service was still good. It's a small place so expect a more intimate setting than a big noisy bar.\\n\\nWe ordered the soup of the day, which was minestrone soup, which was very good. It was veggie with no ham and one of my guests said they would have liked to see some tiny chunks of ham. I explained that I believed it was a vegetarian version. Two of the soups were warm and the other was hot. I didn't mind as I didn't have to wait for it to cool off.\\n\\nThe bread and oil dip came out and I avoided it, but every one else ate it up. We had the eggplant ravioli which was extremely tasty. Our pizzas were cheese and the Antica pizza (the house special) which comes out on fire (flambe). The one thing I would prefer is a pizza stand to keep the pizza off the table but I'm guessing they are going for a theme here. There wasn't much room on the tables with all the dishes, glasses and other items.\\n\\nThe pizzas were all very tasty and as previously stated, all real cheese with home made sauce. It was really good. However our pizzas were very soft in the middle and we all mentioned that even though the taste was excellent we would have liked to see them cooked a little longer to get the center crispier. It could be the style of the pizza which comes out thinner than normal pizzas you see locally.\\n\\nFor desert we had a strawberry tiramisu which was very yummy. I sampled a small portion which was all I could get from my daughter who fenced every one off with her spoon as we tried to get seconds or thirds. \\n\\nBeers are expensive at $3.50 each, but having one with the pizza was good.\\n\\nService was great and I believe the owner came out a few times to check on us and the orders. I really like the intimate space provided. I don't like loud places and I prefer a more personable vibe. There wasn't any loud music playing and we didn't have to talk loud to hear each other. The high backs on the booths block a lot of the talk from the other patrons.\\n\\nFor those who read my reviews, yes, I ate gluten pizza, but it was the first time in a very, very long time and I'm paying the price for it right now as I type this review.

Yet again, bad. Everything was horrible. The waitress came to take our orders and to bring the bill. Other than that- nothing. I sat for 25 minutes with an empty glass waiting for her to stop and ask to bring me another and did not once. I literally had NOTHING to drink my entire dinner with. We ordered the bruscesetta for an appetizer and it was soggy and bland. Waste of money.  Then I ordered the veal and my husband one of the specials for the night- braised short ribs. His were bland and tasted like they had been sitting for a while. Mine were just bland and kind of mushy. With a $75 bill there should have been at least SOMETHING remotely worth eating. After two bad meals and some very bad service I will not be returning to Porchinis and suggest you find another place for dinner as well.\\n\\n\\nI trust the Phantom Gourmet. The show has never steered me wrong, so when it says that a restaurant is good, I trust it. The service at Porcini's was good, so was the bread and dipping sauce, but that was about it. My husband has the veal scallopini and I hand the osso bucco, and both were mediocre. Literally three entire bites of my osso buco were straight fat. Disgusting. The rest of the plate was bland and mushy. My husbands veal was similar in lack of quality. We ordered the creme brulee to share and found it to be nothing like any quality brulee we have ever hand. It was sweet and lemony, tasted nothing as a traditional creme brulee, and lacked the traditional sugar layer on the top of the custard. Again, disappointing. With a house bottle of chianti the bill totaled to $86, although it should really not have been any more than $60.  This was a disappointing visit, and surprised me since the Phantom had given it such a great review.

We ordered drinks, which took longer than they should, and our server didn't come back to take our order until at least 10 minutes after the drinks arrived. My boyfriend and I each got the prix fixe Dining Month menu, and we got the first course pretty soon after, but then we waited 45 minutes for our entree, with no check-in from our server or update on when the food would arrive. In fact, our server was so aloof during the entire meal that he either was completely stoned or just didn't care. Or both. I ordered the Duck, and it wasn't great, especially since I was ravenous by the time it arrived. Dessert came with the prix fixe menu, otherwise we would've skipped it by how the evening was going. By the time our entrees were finally cleared after, this is a surprise, waiting for awhile, we waited another 15-20 minutes for our dessert to arrive. Overall, we were at the restaurant for over 2.5 hours for what should've been an hour meal, max. The food was sub-par and our server was the worst I've ever had. Swank gets a 0 in my book.

Until I started eating. The mesquite smell that greets you when you walk in the place is oh-so inviting -- enough to raise the hopes of any steak lover. The live music (a guy named Carl plays on Wednesdays and Fridays), added a nice country-western touch to the atmosphere....Not that the atmosphere needed an additional country-western touch, but the music was pleasant just the same. I'm telling you, the smells and sounds were promising - they fool you into thinking you are about to have a great dining experience. And then you're seated and the service is wonderful, and you're still feeling really good about everything. And then you read the menu and it gets you excited, so you order an appetizer (fried bacon-wrapped stuffed jalapenos). And so the disappointment begins.\\n\\nDon't get me wrong, the stuffed jalapenos were okay, but they were boring and underseasoned. The Shiner Bock beer batter had absolutely no flavor and the goat cheese stuffing was just ho-hum. But I must say, the corn salsa that comes alongside was refreshing and quite tasty.\\n\\nAnd then came the steaks. When my ribeye arrived, my expectations were raised once again - it looked juicy and delicious. Unfortunately, the meat was tough and I had trouble getting through it. The whipped sweet potatoes were cloyingly sweet, yet the poblano mashed potatoes were way too subtle. \\n\\nThe one high point of the meal was the Caesar salad. It comes with cornmeal croutons that I found unique and delicious. The lettuce was fresh and crisp and the dressing was full of flavor. It was nothing like any Caesar salad I've ever had - a really pleasant surprise.\\n\\nI am willing to give this place another shot, but I won't get steak again.

I guess I must be. \\n\\nThe ambiance was perfect. Small and intimate but with large windows and a view of the busy street nightlife of portland. I was brought water almost instantly. I took a look at the menu and narrowed down my choices. I started with the cocktail. A restaurant needs to have a strong cocktail. And swank did not disappoint. \\n\\nI had the sparrow. It was yummy, granted anything with whiskey wins me over. The sparrow had an orange peel as a garnish and was light plum in color. This truly was a beautiful drink . Not only did the deep times of the Wiskey hit the pallet but my nose was on a constant high when drinking. Although the the taste and the smell are very different they seem to compliment each other. I was in love . \\n\\nFor starters I asked for the sea salt and  pepper calamari. It was exquisite. I'm very picky with my calamari but the blend of spice and citrus paired with the fresh octopus left me wanting more. It was a tad salty but to each their own. It was topped off with sea salt and a spring carrot and spinach finely diced into a sauce. \\n\\nFor my main meal I went with the seared duck. It was my first time trying something new and different . My waiter made sure that I try something that the house calls a signature dish. When it arrives the proportion was nice and perfect for a first time duck critic. Lol. There was a well ban aced of cheese on the plate to go with my dick as well as tossed baby cabbages and what seemed like grits. The proportions where small but extremely flavorful and fulfilling. \\n\\nFor desert I decided to try the olive oil cake. I wasn't sure if this was going to be good or not as I also have never had that. When I asked the host about it she seemed to not have an answer for me. I took a risk and went for it. To my surprise the cake was actually four portions of mickle sized croutons. Slightly disappointed but over all the ap and the main made up for it . \\n\\nWill I return next time I'm in Portland?

It's almost impossible to not have to wait for a buffet meal at Disney without reservation.  Often times they don't even take walkin.  There's almost no good quick service meals in the park.  We stayed at the Contemporary so we came here twice for convenience.  For dinner, we ordered the kids meal pasta with marinara and chicken nuggets.  Then we had their appetizer sampler of crab cake and fish tacos and a salad with steak.  The service was extremely slow for dinner.  We waited over 30 minutes to get any food.  The appy was mediocre.  I barely tasted the breaded fish in the tacos since it was probably sitting around getting soaked in tomatoes and mayo...  the steak salad was decent, the pasta marinara had added sugar in it for sure.  it was no wonder that my kid usually a pasta lover took only one bite and decided she wanted the grapes and bread with butter instead.  chicken nuggets were better than mcd.  I would've given this place a 1-2 star for dinner.\\n\\nWe then came here for breakfast buffet and at $20 per adult it was a good deal in disney.  No characters or fancy castles, just fresh hot breakfast buffet with good variety.

The hotel has a great location right next to Sea World.  The hotels is very large, the inside lobby area is well kept with a bar area and small restaurant.  They have nice landscaping and pool area for the kids.  There was a small line in at check-in but it moved quickly.  We checked into our room and we had a King size room with couch, his and her sinks, and balcony overlooking the foyer and inside of the hotel.  The bed was comfortable but it did not have the extra pillows or towels as requested.  The issues arose on our second day of our three day stay.  My wife and I left around 9 am, on Saturday morning.  We came back to our room between 5 to 5:15 pm.  When we arrived at our room we found our room had not been serviced. I called housekeeping and spoke to a young man named Pedro.  I advised him of the issue with our room and explained to him that my wife and I had been gone almost all day and came back to get ready for dinner.  Before I could finish my explanation, he abruptly advised me that they had until 6 pm to have our room cleaned and told me to be patient.  I advised Pedro that made no sense to me since check-in is at 4 pm each day and the fact that we paid for a room all day Saturday but could not enjoy the room due to the lack of room service as paid for.  Again, Pedro interrupted me and stated they have a list that they go by and they do not deviate from the cleaning list.  He advised me since I had checked in the day before my room was NOT a priority as the incoming guest rooms were a priority and our room would be gotten to when they finished the list.  I advised Pedro that when we left the housekeeper was two doors down from our room and she saw us leave our room. Pedro then came to our room after I told him we were not leaving since we just came back to the hotel.  He did not knock but rather used his key and walked into our room.  I again in a stern voice told him barging in my room was unacceptable and knocking is the proper etiquette of any hotel.  I advised him that we paid for a room and they have failed to provide the service in which we paid for which was a clean room with clean towels, wash clothes etc.  Pedro again reminded me of the policy of Marriott that they have until 6 pm to have rooms cleaned.  My wife and I were barged in on two more time by Pedro without knocking and the last time he had another housekeeper with him.  This time when he barged in I was in the process of undressing.  At this point, I got angry and requested he meet me at the front desk so we could speak to the hotel management.  Pedro never showed up.  I spoke to the front desk Manager Michael Mathews and he did not even know who Pedro was.  He then spoke a couple of minutes on the phone with Pedro to find out the hotel housekeeping manager was not on site but would be back later and would come to speak with me regarding this issue and have it resolved.  Mr. Mathews tried to cover for Pedro stating he thought I wanted to speak to the manager of housekeeping even though I told him I wanted him downstairs.  Needless to say, I never spoke to the housekeeping manager, Pedro never came to the front desk and Mr. Mathews did nothing to resolve this issue.  Due to the lack of attention by Mr. Mathews I contacted Marriott by Facebook.  They told me they notified management at the hotel.  I advised them I had already spoke to the Front Desk Manager and no action or resolution had been made.  Then again at 11:35 pm I got another message from Marriott on Facebook to speak with Tim Ryan, another front desk manager on Sunday before we checked out.  My wife and I spoke with Mr. Ryan and explained to him what had happened.  He did as Pedro did and advised us of Marriott's policy.  Other than that, he did nothing to bring resolution to this matter.  Our room was never cleaned Saturday night of our stay.  It should be noted when my wife and I left for dinner on Saturday night we counted 6 room still being cleaned at 7:30 pm. We had a dirty room all day Saturday until we checked out on Sunday morning around 9 am.   A couple of things to remember before you book:  Your room will be the last rooms cleaned if you stayed the night before at the hotel.  The management of this hotel seems to lack leadership required to operate this type of hotel.  They also lack problem solving skills since they never resolved our issue.  Parking at this hotel is $22 a night if you self-park and $32 if you Valet park plus tip.  The check in line can be long at times, each time we left a minimum of 5 people were waiting to be checked-in.  Traffic around the hotel is very dense and bumper to bumper since Sea World is next door.  It appears housekeeping is extremely understaffed since they were still cleaning rooms at 7:30 pm.  You certainly don't get what you pay for since we couldn't get a clean room.

The whole atmosphere had a Vegasy feel. The hotel entrance was impressive and airy. Even though it was late at night, you can hear the loud crowd and the thumping bass echoing from the bar area next to the restaurant as you enter the granite lobby. The restaurant area was actually a little quieter once you walk around the bar, and it had outdoor seating looking over what I assume would be the wharf.\\n\\nThe decor was classic French Provencal country completed with a big chandelier. Lighting was dim, a little romantic-ish. They put on some kind of late night down-tempo mix when we were there so kind of balanced out the stately interior. There was no strict dress code although most people were looking nice in their night-out outfits.\\n\\nAs the name suggested, the menu had dishes that paired honey into the entrees. I'm sure they were probably good, but I didn't want anything too heavy that late at night. Our friendly waiter Tom brought out the after-midnight menu that had some soups, burgers and sandwiches (that same menu for the bar area). \\n\\nWe had a shrimp cocktail appetizer and a burger and a grilled focaccia. 5 jumbo shrimps presented on an ice block filled in with ice chunks, the shrimp meat was a little tough. We could've done without it. The burger and the sandwich were mmm mmm good.  Meat patty for the burger was grilled as rare as legally possible in Boston (which is not too rare btw). Presentation was nice with a little flag of thinly fried cheese encasing a parsley leaf. The grilled focaccia was deliciously filled with melted Brie, prosciutto, and tomato basil compote, none of which overpowered the flavors of the other. The shoe string pommes frite rounded out the meal.\\n\\nAs someone else already mentioned, Miel is not cheap. Location, setting, design were all nice. Service was good and unpretentious perhaps because there weren't too many customers around.

The Frog legs were the first frog legs i ever eaten. I was worried that the buffalo sauce would mask the flavor of the frog, but i could surprisingly slightly taste the frog flavor. The pickled celery and blue cheese combination was definitely BOLD flavor. They were decent. For dessert, we ordered the masumoto peach and blueberry cobbler and replaced the vanilla ice cream with blackberry sorbet to please both our palettes. Very satisfying. \\nUnfortunately, I don't live in Orlando!

There are several things on the menu I've not tried because I tend to order favorites but I fully intend to try them...and Liver 'n Onions is next! (Hard to find most places).
