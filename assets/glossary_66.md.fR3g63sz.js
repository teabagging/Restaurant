Not every one of my experiences there has been perfect but I still give it 4 stars because most of my visits have been 4 or 5 star visits. There were times when the kitchen was slow when it first opened or the times I've had something on the menu that wasn't as good as some of my other experiences but they have fixed the kitchen issues and I've never had anything I've complained about. \\nTheir burgers are absolutely the best thing they do in my opinion. They offer unique varieties of burgers and I've enjoyed even the simplest one. The Rise and Swine is amazing, a mouth watering burger topped with ham, bacon, cheese, and a fried egg is such a great combination you won't be able to put it down.\\nIf I stop in for something \\"small\\" I always get their Blackened Tuna Nachos. Seared Blackened tuna on a bed of their crab Rangoon dip on top of fried wontons with guac and microgreens on top. Truly a masterpiece of flavors. In reality though it's not small, their portions are large enough to share with several people. \\nWhile I've had less of their sushi than I have their burgers, what I have had has been really good too. It's always fresh and made to order if their is something in a roll you'd like to leave out, their chefs have always allowed it.\\nOne of the best ways to enjoy their menu if you're not sure if you want cow or fish is to order one of their bento boxes. Be warned though it is a huge amount of food. It comes with a choice of a couple sushi rolls, a burger slider, a light refreshing Asian cucumber salad, edamame, and sweet potato fries. So much food but so good! \\nThey do not disappoint with their unique drink menu either, offering a variety of house cocktails and a good selection of draft beers. They do have happy hour as well. This restaurant also offers a selection of hand made milk shakes that I can't really compare to anywhere else in the area. They offer adult milk shakes that have alcohol in them and also specialty ones that don't. The rice crispy treat milkshake is like heaven in a cup.

With somewhat higher expectation than usual, we left the place a little disappointed. Nonetheless, we think it's a decent place to eat if you happen to be near by. But we definitely won't go out of our way to a sleepy town called Belmont just for this.\\n\\nWe ordered the lamb teriyaki, bamboo shots, scallion pancake, lion head, dan dan noodle, ma po tofu with meat.\\n\\nThe lamb teriyaki was fried well and the ingredients they used totally masked the usual lamb favor. This is good for people who otherwisely don't like lamb. But as someone who likes lamb, I'd prefer a small trace of lamb favor and perhaps a little moist inside the meat. The meat was a bit too salty,which reminded me of the typical style that you'd find in a local restaurant in Beijing. So in a way, the preparation is pretty authentic.\\n\\nBamboo shots was terrible. I had better ones almost everywhere else.\\n\\nThe scallion pancake was pretty good. Lightly fried and puffy. Not oily and gave a mild scallion favor. It is one of the better treatment you can find in Boston. It can rival some of the naan you can find from a better Indian restaurant.\\n\\nThe lion head was prepared with vermicelli in a special gravy sauce. I love this method of preparation. It could have been a very nice dish if they didn't double up on the salt or try a little harder to mask the raw pork meat favor. \\n\\nThe dan dan noodle was too salty. We didn't finish it and didn't bother to pack it home.\\n\\nThe ma po tufu was good. But we got it with meat and it seems like the meat is just as salty as the meat from the lion head. It somehow discredited an otherwisely fairly good dish.\\n\\nOverall, I feel like this restaurant is pretty authentic. It reminded me of what's eating at a local restaurant in China is like. But it certainly lacks refinements and balance. I probably shouldn't expect so much for a low budget meal. \\n\\nSo in assigning an overall rating, I'd give it a 4 stars from budget price perspective.

Kid friendly and reasonable accommodating in that regard.  The staff was quite reasonable with us.  Their dishes were tasty overall, and a few were quite good sauces in the classical sense.  My main problem was that most dishes had a bit of pepper and were too spicy for kids for sure and bordering on too much spicy for me in the following sense.  Now I actually like spicy food, but that is when I ask for it.  I find no point in making foods spicy that don't need to be.  It hides the taste and there is no logical reason to do it beyond a touch to tickle the mouth very lightly.  Normally, American food these days is getting more spicy for not good reason --- although it does hide less than excellent cooking but that was not the case here.  So I felt like it was just a pointless exercise of \\"hey let's make it spicy because\\" which it the most annoying thing ever.

About 20 minutes after we ordered brunch, the server returned to tell us that she'd just been notified by the kitchen that they were out of turkey burgers.  By this point, we'd expected to receive our food (not have to reorder) as brunch dishes typically come out pretty quickly and many others around us had received food and finished eating.  During this time, she'd also refilled our water glasses 2 or 3 times and gotten us a booster seat for our 2 year old, so I definitely knew we'd been waiting for some time and were starting to wonder where our food was.  When she notified us they were out, my husband simply changed his order to a gyro.  After waiting about 5 more minutes (not long at all for the second order I admit), I called the server over to ask if she could discount our bill due to the significant wait overall.  She looked very puzzled at my request so I simply asked to speak to the manager.  (AT this point, I really thought this would be a non issue).  When Mira the manager arrived, she told us that our order had been put in at 12:05 (which was only about 10 minutes ago at that point). I told her that the second order was likely placed then, but the original order had been placed approximately 30 minutes ago at this point.  I called the server over to clarify and asked her to tell Mira how long it had been from the time we placed our original order until the time we were notified they were out of turkey burgers and she said \\"about 5 minutes\\" - a BLATANT lie.  Obviously, she had forgotten to put in the order until 12:05 which is why it was 20 minutes before she found out they were out of turkey burgers.  This really incensed me.  She could have very easily admitted that she'd forgotten to place the order which resulted in a much longer than normal wait given the fact that she was also unaware of which entrees were out for that day when she took our order.  To make matters worse instead of focusing on the customer service issue at hand, Mira kept talking about what a great server she was and even talked about how turkey burgers take longer to cook (COMPLETELY IRRELEVANT since you're out of them!!!!).  Also, we immediately found a bug in my husband's food (which could have been due to the fact that we were outside admittedly).  We've patronized this spot for years and to be fair have had good service (even from this server) in the past.  It's so unfortunate that something that obviously was an honest mistake was handled so poorly by the server and management."},{"name":"The Cowfish Sushi Burger Bar","address":"Universal Citywalk - Orlando, 6000 Universal Blvd","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"Hidden upstairs at CityWalk, this place is the ultimate find.

We arrived twenty minutes before our reservation celebrating a birthday on a Saturday and found it busy, but not overwhelmingly so. We checked in, told them about my date's birthday and requested a candle for our dessert and were told it would be about the twenty minutes we anticipated before our table would be ready. No problem, margaritas at the bar would tide us over we figured. Problem is, it took fifteen minutes to order them. Now I understand the dining room was full, but the bar was not. And for the money we paid for the margaritas, ($14 each) they were not (a) strong or (b) good. They even put salt on mine after I specifically asked for no salt, and received an evil sneer from the bartender for pointing out her mistake. As we sipped our drinks, we watched our reservation time come and go, and after twenty minutes PAST our reservation time, I decided to go to the host stand and inquire about our table. The host told me that our table would be available soon. I returned to the bar. Twenty more minutes later, I went back to the host stand for another quote, this time the host rudely told me they were busy and would get to me as soon as they can, but that he had no control over the tables and when they would leave. I understand this, but (a) you don't have to be rude and (b) a time estimate would be nice. We decided to try the tapas at the bar while we waited some more, and for a dollar, they were not memorable and served lukewarm. At least they were only a dollar. Finally, one hour after our reservation time, we were seated by the rude host, who we later learned was the GM, with no apologies made or other retributions offered. I am not out for free stuff, but seriously, this is a bad start to our dinner, which we are over an hour into without being sat. Our server approached us and we ordered a bottle of wine, which they were out of. We tried another bottle, which they were also out of. The server recommended a third bottle, which we later found out when we got the bill was twice the price of our other wine picks. We ordered apps, the tuna roll, bland and fishy tasting, and the empanad, which was cold and not worth $13. Our first entree choice was out for the evening, so we decided on the tuna and the duck. Our entrees, the tuna, gritty and bland, and the duck, overcooked andcold, did not prove much better. Pretty much every food we ordered was served lukewarm to cold, and all of them should have at least been warm. We don't even remember the desserts we ordered, but I do remember the first two tequilas we tried to order with them were also out of stock. The manager came by and asked how everything was and we told him the problems, as our bill at this point neared $220 for two. I also reminded the GM, who I originally told about the birthday candle, about the neglected birthday candle in my dates dessert. He told me that they were very busy and said that they try to look after as many people as they can, however, some things do get overlooked. Like someone enjoying their experience in their establishment. No further apologies were made. Needless to say, we paid the bill and left.

It's on the short list of places to eat that have a twitter feed to monitor the line (@franklinbbqline).   It's a 4+ hour wait for BBQ (If you're lucky and get there at the right time, you're probably looking at 2-3 hours on the front end, or maybe less for the scraps on the back end.  There's clearly the \\"buzz\\" factor that adds to the wait.  But in the end, the food delivers.  Does it deliver enough to justify the wait?  That's up to you decide, but here's my take - this is the best BBQ I've had.  Hands down, top to bottom - the best brisket, the best pork ribs, the best pulled pork, the best smoked turkey, and the best hot link.  The cole slaw was alright, as were the beans.  I'm not a BBQ expert, particularly when it comes to Texas BBQ, but I've had a decent share of good BBQ over the years.  \\n\\nMy first taste of Franklin's started around 3 hours into the wait, when they passed out bites of hot links with bread.  That's when it all began feeling real, and the anticipation really started to begin.  A crisp casing surrounding a peppery sausage with a smoky finish. \\n\\nAfter that wait (got in line around 9, served just before 1;30)   this is what we ended up with - 2 lbs, brisket, 2 lbs pork ribs (the 2nd to last order), the last 1/3 lb of pulled pork, a 1/2 lb of smoked turkey, and a few hot links.  4+ hours of waiting, and we just got served in time to try everything on the menu.  \\n\\nThe brisket here is everything you would want - perfectly tender, nice smoke ring, great bark, and the smoky flavor that lingers in your mouth.  not too salty, and seasoned enough to complement the meat, but still allowing the natural flavor of the beef to come through.  \\n\\nThe pork ribs are a bit firmer.  Didn't seem quite as meaty as the St. Louis cut I'm used to but definitely not the overly tender Baby backs either.  A perfect mix of both.  Tender and fall off the bone, with a nice meaty bite to it.  The rub seems a simple black pepper rub, just enough to add some a bit of flavor that complements the natural flavor of the pork and the smoke perfectly.  \\n\\nLike I mentioned earlier, we got the last scraps of pulled pork, but even then, it was soft, moist, if not a bit too moist.  Lacked a bit of smokiness but mixed perfectly with the hot sauce.  The turkey is highly underrated and in more prominent supply, so if you go and arrive late, don't feel baad about getting the turkey - it's a stellar option.  Tasted brined as the meat itself had a nice salty flavor to it, and the turkey itself has a nice smokiness to it.  \\n\\nI wish that I could go back to Franklin's but have to wait the wait again - 4 hours seems excessive and it's against my general principle to wait for anything that long.   I'm glad I did it, but I'd be hard pressed to do it again.

I truly love bbq, and have no issue driving several hours outside of Austin to find it.  I've heard people rave about Louis Mueller's bbq, which I think is good, but nothing special.  Generally though Austin is a bbq void.  Most of the bbq in town was subpar to places like \\"Smitty's\\" \\"Kreutzs\\" \\"Opies\\" \\"Snows\\" and \\"Coopers.\\"  No longer.  Austin now has, not only the best bbq in Texas, but in the United States.\\n\\nI'm sure all of the reviews discuss the line, and there are probably no exaggerations.  If you want to be first in line show up at 10:00 am for the 11:00 am opening of the restaurant.  If you show up at 10:30 you'll wait at least an hour to get your food, after that it could be up to two hours.  If you have the time, it is worth it.  Bring something to read, or be friendly and chat people up in the line.  Often, the staff will come out and sell beer to people in line.\\n\\nThe offerings are: brisket, sausage, and ribs.  Try all of them, but whatever you do, you cannot pass on the brisket.  It is the house specialty and the reason this place is so deservedly popular.  The owner is a young guy and he personally cuts the meat on every plate.  They could cut down the line substantially by adding another meat cutter, but I think he likes to see the line and I think he is very interested in detail.  I can't completely fault him for that, it is good business to have a line going out the door every day, but that is little consolation when you have been waiting an hour and a half.  Despite that, by the time you get the food you completely forget about your frustration.\\n\\nI have no idea what he does to the brisket but it is perfect.  He also boasts three different types of sauce.  I am not a huge bbq sauce fan, I prefer perfectly seasoned meats and sides, but the \\"espresso bean bbq sauce\\" is worth trying.\\n\\nIf you have the time, do not miss this place."},{"name":"Alden & Harlow","address":"40 Brattle St","city":"Cambridge","stars":"4","text":"Puny Portions.

I could survive on nothing but sushi and soup, all day every day.  When my boyfriend asks me where I want to eat, he qualifies it by saying \\"No sushi or soup.\\"  Because that's what I answer every time, without fail.  In fact on this particular day - the day of Ramen Tatsu-ya's Grand Opening - I had eaten nothing but sushi and miso for lunch, and I was craving more soup for dinner. \\n\\nI talked Quani C. into accompanying me, and we arrived close to 8:30 to a line that was still out the door.  By the time we made it the counter my stomach was crying out for sweet ramen.  We each ordered a beer, some gyoza, a slider to share, and for ramen I got the #2 and she got the #1, the \\"original.\\"\\n\\nGyoza and sliders came out first, and both were amazing.  Gyoza could have stood to be cooked just a hair longer for extra-crispness (and one of them had a cold spot in the middle), but the flavor was sooo good.  The slider made my tastebuds sing!  If your friends don't like ramen, drag them along anyway and make them order two sliders.  Or a slider and gyoza.  They won't be disappointed.\\n\\nRamen Tatsu-ya is pretty serious about ramen, so serious in fact that they have \\"rules\\" (more like guidelines) about the proper way to eat ramen.  One of the first rules is that before tasting, you should smell the broth and let it \\"run down your spine.\\"  After the requisite jokes about what a waste it would be to pour ramen down our backs, we dug in.\\n\\nThis is where Quani's experience and mine start to diverge, I think - I won't speak for her, but IMHO, her #1 ramen was just not as flavorful as #2.  I highly recommend the #2.  There's something soy-based added to the broth that gives it real ooomph and richness.  I suppose if you do order the #1 you can add one of the \\"bombs\\" which I'm assuming add more spice to your chosen ramen.  I may try that next time.\\n\\nYeah, it's hot as hell in there.  The A/C is a 90 lb. weakling.  I hope they remedy that in short order.  Also, if you're expecting to share a slider, have fun trying to cut it with chopsticks, 'cuz they don't have knives.  Did you know Quani is actually quite adept at cutting things with chopsticks?  I didn't.\\n\\nSome things they could improve on:  an easy way to order another beer without having to stand in line again, or fight through a crowd at the counter.  If you plan on drinking beer I'd recommend bringing cash, so that maybe you can flag an employee or slip through the line without having to go to the register.  Or hey, just be classy and order two at the beginning and bring a koozy.  Purse-koozies are never a bad idea.\\n\\nAll in all, a very welcome addition to feed my SOUP, GLORIOUS SOUP! addiction.  And it doesn't hurt that it's about 7 minutes from my house, either.  :D"},{"name":"The Cowfish Sushi Burger Bar","address":"Universal Citywalk - Orlando, 6000 Universal Blvd","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"Have eaten here two times and both times I have received outstanding service and absolutely delicious food.

I always hope when I go in Newks that they have the loaded baked potato soup to dip with my sandwich. My wife got the Newks favorite salad which is a very generous portion size of salad. She loves that salad and she also got a soup which was lobster bisque soup in which she also enjoyed. If the soup didn't taste funny they would have gotten a 5 star.

So they came midway through our Chicken bites and we barley had room for the puppies.

That's what hubby and I did when we visited last week. We got ribs, chicken wings, pulled pork, sliced brisket, tater tots and slaw. As far as the meat goes, he loved the ribs and I loved the wings. The ribs were seasoned with dry rub only as far as I could tell and weren't particularly sweet (no caramalized bark). But the chicken wings did have a light layer of sauce on them, which had a bit of a spicy kick, perfectly balanced by the creaminess of the ranch I dipped them in. The girl working the register suggested I get the sliced brisket because of it being more moist. But I have to say that wasn't the most tender or most flavorful I've had. The pulled pork seemed comparable to most others I've tried. I would recommend covering it with just a tiny amount of BBQ sauce (it's on the vinegar-y side) and slaw. That slaw was creamy and sweet, just the way I like it! And last but not least - those tater tots!!

Ok sure, it is BBQ sacrilege to boil your ribs, but I am pretty sure that it how Matt's does it.... I have actually done this at home, but not to their degree of excellence.  I think they sauce the ribs next and finish them off on the grill.  That explains the lower smoke flavor.  It may not be to the liking of BBQ purest, but when it is tasty, I really don't care.  The ribs also come with a side of sauce, but you really don't need it since they are already fairly sauced.

We let him know how we were looking forward to the table-side service, and he told us he'd make it work.  Before we knew it, he brought out several plates and a wood bowl.  He brought all the ingredients right to our table and explained each ingredient and began the Caesar process right on the table!  During the whole time we were there, we were the only table that got the table-side Caesar.  Valentines Day may be one of the busiest days in the restaurant, but he was willing to take the time to perform the table-side show!

THIS IS WHY I CAME TO AUSTIN.\\n\\nI mean...I came to see my friend and we were just craving ramen! And well yeah...\\n\\nI had heard of Tatsu-Ya first when Time Out named it the best ramen in America. Mind you, that was two years ago. Trying this spot has been two years in the making. It didn't help that Southwest's magazine confirmed that Tatsu-Ya makes legit ramen on the flight in. It induced a near panic in me and my need to try it. My friend had already been here a few times and agreed that the food was fantastic.\\n\\nMy second day in Austin, we made the trek over for an early dinner. She insisted that if we eat here, we're doing it early because the line gets ridiculous. She was not wrong, as there was already about 20 people in line when we arrived. Luckily you can buy drinks to hold you over when you get inside. \\n\\nThe restaurant is fast casual and trendy; certainly not the atmosphere that you would expect to dish out authentic ramen. Order at the counter, take a number, and hope you find a seat. The employees are pretty good at only letting enough people in the restaurant that they have seating for, but they're only human so I did notice instances where diners were waiting a few minutes before being able to sit. \\n\\nMy friend stuck to the pre-made veggie option, but added an egg. On the other hand, I went a little cray cray with a make your own tsukemen that had all the original ingredients plus a chili bomb, extra garlic, Brussels sprouts, and kikurage (mushrooms). We waited for what seemed like an eternity, but in reality was only probably 10-15 minutes. I'm just an impatient mess when it comes to food, I apologize.\\n\\nWhen it arrived, oh was it beautiful! I've had ramen at a lot of places, and almost all have been delicious, but making ramen look appealing is a true art form. For all the times I've ordered ramen, I'd never ordered dunking ramen. Being the uncultured swine that I am, I got annoyed two bites in and just dumped all that yummy, creamy broth straight into my noodles and toppings. There was no shame. There were no regrets. What was created was this thick, rich, comforting bowl of happiness. I plowed through all the noodles (I ordered extra because, again, no shame) and the rest of the umami perfection that was presented before me. I found myself full, but with enough room to enjoy various alcoholic beverages throughout the night.\\n\\nThe two-year Mecca to trying this ramen is finally complete.

We arrived an hour before and there were only two parties ahead of us. Once inside, we found seats by the bar and enjoyed a delicious Pina Colada in their signature glass. It was HUGE and only cost $10. Refills were half price. Three appetizers arrived to hold us over and they were quite tasty. Then the pre-show started to give us the opening to the storyline. The first mate, Mr McGee corralled everyone by color and introduced us to our pirate. Once inside the show, we were seated right in front of the stage, which is shaped like a pirate ship and is completely surrounded by water. We were immediately served sodas in large cups and the server asked if we would like a complimentary beer. Then salads were served with choice of dressing.  It was fresh and the bowls were big. I wanted ice water and my server came out quickly with it. The pirates were singing some songs to set the atmosphere. Next came our delicious meal. We chose the chicken and we received a half chicken each and baked to perfection. It came with mixed vegetables and seasoned rice.  There was so much food that I couldn't even finish mine. The show consisted of acrobatic and gymnast acts. The pirates were very entertaining as were the gypsy and the princess. At one point, they brought all the children on board. My 6 yr old daughter got up and started to go the wrong way but the pirate took her gently by hand and led her to the front of the pack of kids. She was dressed as a pirate and the Captain admired her outfit. They all had a great time. Then dessert was served; chocolate iced cake with whipped cream. There was a lot of action and singing and the actors stayed in character throughout the show. The server suggested a tip of $5 per adult and $3 per child. I thought it was quite reasonable for the great service we received so we gave him the full amount. After the show, the pirates brought us all back to the pre-show area and it turned into a nightclub scene with dancing. All the young people enjoyed it. The bartenders handed out boxes to carry the glasses back in and the gift shop provided us with bags. We absolutely loved it and we cannot say enough good things about it.

Typically quick service. We will be back in the future!"},{"name":"Aria","address":"490 E Paces Ferry Rd NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"I've lived in Atlanta since 1996 and over the years I've visited Aria a handful of times and it always remains in my Atlanta Top Ten restaurants. This Saturday evening (Valentine's Day weekend) we dined with another couple who are just as into food and wine as we are, which in itself is a treat! Our friends provided three bottles of wine for the evening, and we were honored that they shared such great selections with us!\\n\\nOur first wine course was a Kosta Brown Sonoma Coast Chardonnay (2011) which paired well with the crab. I'm not a chardonnay fan but man oh man, this is one I really enjoy! It's a perfectly balanced wine for me -- a bit of oak, a hint of buttered popcorn and bright fruit makes it one of the only California chards I'm actually enthusiastic about. \\n\\nSince all four of us are into food sharing, we started with two appetizers for the table. The seared foie gras was like none I've ever had before. Rich, slightly crispy on the outside and creamy and velvety on the inside, it's small but divine. The vanilla braised apple and black pepper gastrique on the plate brightens the dish with a bit of acid and sweetness. I could have licked that gastrique right off the plate! (You'll be glad to know I didn't) :) \\n\\nWe also had the crab cake appetizer which was quite good too. An appetizer is always better when it comes with a great accompaniment on the plate and the napa cabbage and apple slaw was the perfect complement to the texture and flavor of the crispy fried crab cakes. \\n\\nAfter the appetizer course, the four of us decided to have two additional courses, each being a split entree. We love sharing multiple courses because you get so much variety! \\n\\nOur server George poured our second bottle of wine (Aston Estate Sonoma Coast Pinot Noir 2011) and it too was crazy balanced. The nose was an amazing combination of bright strawberry, dirt and a hint of pot smoke (which is very common in coastal Pinot Noirs, especially in Anderson Valley and Mendocino County) and the palate was similar. Enough fruit to make it juicy, but enough earth, acid and a bit of tannin to give it structure. Definitely a Pinot for grown-ups. ;-) \\n\\nOur first split entree course was the mountain trout -- it was soft and delicious and I swear, the vegetable set-up was just as delicious as the fish. Our friends shared the pork belly two ways and it was bigtime yummy, especially the fried portion. Simultaneously melty and crispy, the flavor was pure pig Heaven. FYI if you haven't had pork with Pinot Noir, give it a try, it's a great combo. \\n\\nAfter our first entree course was finished, George poured our third wine (Clos Apalta, Casa Lapostolle 2005 from Chile) which had been decanting since about 2:00 pm, as the restaurant kindly allowed us to drop off our wine & decant it for us hours before they opened their doors. What a special gesture that we so appreciated! \\n\\nThis wine is terrific and even after decanting for four hours, continued to open up nicely on the table. Nose of salted yeast bread and a subtle hint of green pepper it was rich and delicious!\\n\\nFor our second split entree course, we all opted for braised beef short ribs. The kitchen kindly split each course of entrees for us, so each one arrived at the table beautifully plated, which is SUCH a nice touch that means a lot. When our split entrees arrived, we were shocked that the plates in front of us each held just a half-portion; usually a half-portion is like three bites of food, but not this one! These halves were very generous. \\n\\nThe short ribs were ridiculously good. Rich, buttery, melt-in-your-mouth, nearly falling apart hunks of cow in a gorgeous demiglace, alongside a fluffy bed of potato-celery root puree and yummy root veggies. What could be better? Bonus: this dish paired wonderfully with the Chilean cabernet! \\n\\nOH yes I almost forgot... we tried the cabernet just before the entrees arrived, we all agreed that it would ROCK if combined with the foie gras appetizer, so since it was a holiday weekend and a special occasion, we ordered a second round of foie gras which arrived halfway through our entrees. We were right - the combo of the fat of the foie with the cab was super duper. \\n\\nWe don't typically order dessert but it was Valentine's Day weekend so what the heck. Live on the edge. We shared the warm Ch√®vre cheesecake which was NUTTY good. (and not just because of the hazelnuts on top) - tangy and only the *slightest* bit warm, it was yum-o-rific. The apple tart with vanilla bean ice cream was delicious, (that's not my kind of dessert but it was definitely good!) The surprise dessert the chef sent was the standout. The menu calls it tangerine panna cotta \\nw/ tangerine sorbet however my palate felt it was a vanilla panna cotta with tangerine-passionfruit sorbet and tangerine gelee. Either way it RULES! \\n\\nOverall the meal, the service and experience was one of our best ever and we want to thank Andres Loaiza, the General Manager for a wonderful night!"},{"name":"Se7en Bites","address":"617 N Primrose Dr","city":"Orlando","stars":"4.5","text":"So home and ridiculously charming!

Upon reflection I should have just waited. This restaurant has sushi, hibachi, and hot pot food. I only had the sushi so I can't comment on the other foods. However I will say the overall atmosphere of this restaurant is depressing. The place is falling apart. The seat cushions have holes in them and the back of my booth was so wiggly that when the person behind me sat back in his seat, the booth lurched forward and I got pushed into the table. When you enter the restaurant, behind the hostess desk are restaurant licenses and permits framed and duct taped to the wall. Just the shabbiness of the overall decor made me very nervous to eat sushi here because I figured that if they have the low-level and care of their restaurant it could extend to their food as well. Ultimately I had mediocre Maki roll with shrimp tempura in it so I wouldn't have to eat the raw fish there.

We tried the Texas fries (beef brisket, barbecue sauce, cheese, and jalapenos), fried dill pickle chips, and them hot wings for appetizers, and were blown away by how good everything was. I had the babyback combo for my entree which was this huge slab of mouthwatering ribs where the meat falls of the bone, several slices of juicy beef brisket, mac and cheese, collard greens and a slice of wonder bread to soak up the meat juices.  I doused everything with the house barbecue sauce and dug in as best I could.\\n\\nVerdict: I felt like I had died and gone to barbecue heaven, and so did everyone else. Alas, my metabolism has leveled off, and I was full a fifth of the way in. No worries though, I made sure to pack everything up for a mandatory midnight snack tonight. The collard greens stayed at Fox Bros though. It must be an acquired taste, which I haven't acquired yet.

It's watermelon pieces with little bits of tapioca, all submerged in coconut milk. Definitely a great way to end the meal. \\n\\nI definitely would recommend Hei La Moon to any tourist visiting Chinatown. Do note though, i think Hei La Moon is a tad pricier than China Pearl.

Right when you think you can finally take a break before your actual meal comes, another basket arrives, hot fresh and crispy.  The salsa's good, and the guacamole is one of the best deals for guacamole anywhere!  For two bucks you get a big bowl of it.  Usually in DC the guac is like $4 for a tiny sample cup.  Anyhow, I ordered the eggplant baked with bubbling cheese on top.. it's not really waht the menu makes it sound like.. it's more like eggplant cutlets with a cheezy sauce.. still good though.  Don't hold your breath on the side of mixed vegetables, but black beans are good and the dish overall was great. :)  And the whole meal for 3 people.. at this restaurant.. was only $30!!!

However I wanted to share a few critiques for improvement. First off the prices to portion ratio is a little steep. I found the food to be delicious but the prices will keep me from visiting as often as I'd like. They do serve high quality food but there's a ton of nearby competition so i would hope they will consider adjusting their prices accordingly. Also I'd recommend providing a standard menu. The plastic paper ones we were given that came on a clipboard was very odd and didn't go with the restaurant at all. But the food came out fast and our waiter (who also doubled as the host) was very friendly and funny.\\n\\nHere are some thoughts on the individual food we ate:\\nLocal mixed green Salad- Someone on a prior post said they didn't like the salad dressing but my friend and I both thought it gave the salad a light and fresh taste. And the fried Kale in the salad bumped up the flavor even more! We both thought it was delicious\\nHot Italian sausage- very good as well but the name is misleading . It was mostly polenta with a few pieces of sausage. It was a solid dish but I could have done without the bits of cherries in it \\nEntrees- I ordered the flounder fillet. It was good but after a while of eating it I found it to be a bit heavy in my stomach. Less sauce might have helped. My friend ordered the haddock but after a while thought it was too oily. I liked eating the crunchy snap peas that came with the haddock\\nBread pudding- i have a terrible sweet tooth so this was my most favorite thing I ate. It was warm but crunchy on the outside and my friend and I demolished it quickly. My main critique though is that eastern standard in kenmore has a DIVINE bread pudding dessert which is a bigger piece, comes with ice cream, and is a $1 cheaper than moonshine's dessert\\n\\nAll in all I really like this place and hope to be back soon"},{"name":"Se7en Bites","address":"617 N Primrose Dr","city":"Orlando","stars":"4.5","text":"Love, love, love Se7en Bites!

The Turkey actually stood up to its pork counterparts. Even the sides, which I usually ignore, kicked ass- try the baked beans with pork and screw your low carb diet.

My family and I know barbecue and take it very seriously. While in Austin, we had a chance to stop into Franklin's. Sadly we missed out on the ribs, turkey, and pork, but had a chance to try the brisket, sausage, potato salad, coleslaw, beans, lemon chess, pecan, key lime, and bourbon banana pies. The brisket was tender and the sausage was tasty, but I personally think that they lacked flavor. I personally don't like fall apart brisket, but I appreciated that it was moist. To me, I think the mustard potato salad could have used a touch of mayo and more salt and seasoning. The beans needed more salt and less chili powder. I feel bad about giving such a hallowed place 3-stars especially because we only tasted 2 of their five meats, but because they are known for their brisket, I thought I would go ahead and share my thoughts.\\n\\n***UPDATE: I had to update this review and change it from three to four stars. We took quite a bit of our order home with us to Arkansas (and Memphis for me) and where Franklin's has everyone beat is with how their meat tastes the second and even third day.

To make things more exciting I also asked if the chef could make me a kind of sushi that wasn't on the menu. I was pleasantly surprised when they said they could make me the yummy Quail Egg Sushi (raw quail egg on a bed of fish roe and sushi rice). Both the Katsudon and the Quail Egg Sushi were excellent!\\n\\nThis Thanksgiving weekend, a friend and I visited Hana again and sampled their other sushi, their salads and their chefs selection of rolls.

It might looks tempting but avoid at all cost. My family and I came in and decided to try the King Kong Ice Cream which was the 24 scoops for $99. We first asked if we could eat it outside, the lady in the front who at that time we didn't know was the manager told us no. So we decided to eat inside the restaurant, but while waiting for a table the host told us that she didn't see why would couldn't sit outside, she sees people do it all the time. Ignoring that red flag, we went ahead and sat. Our server was great 5/5, but while eating the ice cream we realized that there weren't any gummy bears, toasted marshmallows, and slices of bananas which was something they promised to have in the $99 ice cream bowl. We were too busy admiring the presentation of the ice cream and decided to even noticed or say anything about it. 10 mins into eating the ice cream, we realized that they we're mainly vanilla and not only was it mainly vanilla, it did not look like scoops of ice creams but instead it looked like they just grabbed a block of ice cream and put it in the bowl. We called for a manager who instead of coming out, was standing by the server stations just laughing and talking to other servers. It took him 20 mins to finally come to the table. When he did come the the table, I explained to him what we we're unhappy about and we don't need any discounts we just want to tell you the problem and was hoping maybe he would sympathized & do something else about it. And he immediately had an attitude. He told us that he physically saw us flip the ice cream over so that we can get a discount. Lucky my little brother was recording the whole experience of us eating the ice cream for his vlogs, and we offered the manager to watch the video to prove that we did NOT flip the ice cream over. He denied and said he did not care to watch the video because it was \\"physics\\" . Another manager came out which was the lady from the front who told us we could not eat outside came over with a smirk on her face and asked us what was the problem. We explained to her about the situation & again she also had an attitude and told us \\" I know you're only complaining because you don't want to tip the server so I'm not going to argue with you guys. There is nothing wrong with the ice cream. I made it myself\\" ( which by the way, we tipped the server $20 and I feel like her saying she \\"made\\" the ice cream was a lie or else she would have mentioned that from the beginning instead of mentioning it towards the end of the argument.) Now I work in a restaurant business and that is NOT how you talk to a customer. That was extremely disrespectful to assume customers are \\"flipping ice creams\\" and \\"not wanting to tip\\" and to say it to their faces? After that my uncle had enough and decided that we should just leave. Apologizing to the server, we went ahead and left and will never come back again. And with this being such a big company like this, I expected better, maybe they felt like they didn't need to give every customer their best service because they were making so much money but that is not an excuse.

The chips and salsa were okay - not my favorite, for sure, but I am a very tough critic of chips and salsa. \\n\\nOne poor unfortunate soul ordered the fish tacos and those were the fishiest smelling tacos I have ever smelled in my entire life. It was bad, y'all. I love fish and I don't mind fishy smelling food because, again, I love fish, but this was rank. As in why did they even serve that?

No. Is it delicious? Questionable, but it is worth having...or splitting...at least once. The sugary doughnuts start off delicious but soon become a bit overwhelming and obviously sticky. It didn't take me long to arrive at tackling the burger with a fork and knife.

I was intrigued...  I should let you know that I am not much of a burger eater, it has been a while but I figured I would try this place to kick off the new year.  I was initially curious about trying the custard, but I didn't want to shock my system too much so I just tried the hamburger pattie.  I found the place really easy after I googled the address and saw that it is located on Brattle street.  It was such a nice day there was even a small table on the sidewalk with a few customers enjoying their late lunch.  As you walk in you quickly realize that it is a small place that has a loft seating area, but at the entrance you will find the menu board hanging that gives you options of either a single or double burger/cheeseburger adn a lot of garnishes.  Plus they also offer salads, sandwiches and a lot of side dishes like french fries and onion rings, etc...  I chose to order a single cheeseburger with avocado.  It only took about five to seven minutes for it to be served, and I was able to grab a stool in the window while I waited.  As I watched the flow and vibe of the people I noticed that even in the mid-afternoon there was a steady line of five or six people, plus there was little available seating.  My cheeseburger arrived and I didn't want to put anything on it the first time other than the avocado I ordered, but if you are looking for garnishes there is a garnish mini-bar by the door with a wide selection of sauces and garnishes, including the basics like ketchup and pickles.\\n\\nThe pattie was served on an oval plate, like in a cafeteria and at first glance it is big enough without being obscene and not so small i feel that I am not getting my value of the money spent; which was about $5.50.  The bun is soft with a slight crust so an improvement upon the standard grocery store burger buns, but not so much bun that you loose the burger.  The avocado I ordered appeared to be about half an average size placed on top.  I was very hungry since it had been seven hours since I had eaten but I tried to slow myself down.  It was a very juicy burger and the pattie was a medium-rare.  I also think that they put there own \\"special\\" sauce on top, too.  Overall, i was very pleased with the burger and glad that they didn't cook the burger too long, I enjoy a little pink in the center.  \\n\\nIf I lived near this place I might go back to try one of their sandwiches or possibly a salad simply to support a well run small business that appears to be making a good product.  I am intrigued to try their custard, but that my have to wait until it warms up, I am not someone who craves frozen treats in the middle of the winter.

You will often find my cheap-ass self there before 6:30 pm on a Monday-Friday to take advantage of their notable happy hour special. So I was thrilled when they opened one just two minutes from my house in Westlake. What's notable about happy hour, you wonder? The food is great, and portions are really sizable for the price (perfect for sharing). I usually get the meat and cheese platter and a tartine. The egg salad tartine is one of my favorites and I also love the smoked salmon/cream cheese tartine. Honestly, two dishes here, shared, are enough for two reasonably-sized, reasonably-hungry men. Wine is as cheap as $3/glass during happy hour. Can good wine really be $3/glass? Will it make you forget that glass of red you had at a Loire chateau during your honeymoon? The answers are, in order, probably not and definitely not. But, hey, it's just fine. If it sucked, I wouldn't drink it, believe me. I'm also happy to report that the outdoor terrace in Westlake succeeds. I was worried about that since I love the gravel-floored, tucked-away courtyard at the original location. I was especially worried about the heat since it catches the evening sun. But both times I've eaten on the courtyard it's been over 100 degrees and, with the aid of fans and misting machines and giant screens, it's been no problem. Of course, if you can't take the heat, there's ample seating inside. Also want to mention that in the Westlake location the three times I've been there a woman---not my server---has come around and asked me how everything is. I really love that.

First, the interior is beautiful and exactly what I like in a place of fine-dining--muted lighting, minimal music and intimate little areas here and there. I especially like the seats when you first enter, several \\"two-seaters\\" (one person in a booth, the other in a chair) next to an intimate but somewhat spare bar. There was a statue of a dog that was speckled with what appeared to Jolly Ranchers, but I could be mistaken. Strange dog aside, five stars for the interior and vibe.\\n\\nFood: This place has a great wine list, both by the glass and beyond. The menu is interesting in a good way--it's not arranged in the traditional \\"small plates at top, entrees in the middle and desserts at the end.\\" Instead, seafood is grouped in one category, with those in BOLD PRINT being entrees. Same goes for meat entrees. I ordered a braised lobster small plate with some type of broccoli puree. It was decent enough--lobster was not very tender, but you can't expect too much if you're not a coastal restaurant. I then ordered a slow-cooked pork dish (Berkshire?)--this is the not so good part. First, two other dishes I wanted were no longer available (I got there at about 10pm), so I got this one. It was served with a glaze that was overly rich/sweet and eventually made me a bit nauseous. There was some ravioli on the side filled with spinach and cheese that was wonderful...wish there was whole plate of it. Overall, food was three stars.\\n\\nService: Good enough. Server had a contrived personality and seemed a bit scripted, but that's probably more a reflection of present society than Aria itself. He was competent enough--no complaints.\\nOverall: three stars, dictated mostly by the food. The only other nice place I've been to Atlanta is Eugene, and I would put Eugene firmly ahead. Strangely enough, I could see myself coming here again, though.

Basement restaurant close to Harvard Square, inside had a very cool vibe with different seating arrangements and bar seats. \\n\\nSmall plates that concentrate on thoughtfully sourced American food, many of the dishes are different combinations of veggies so definitely a great spot for vegetarians since most options don't have meat. \\n\\nThey're well know for their secret burger, but they only serve 30 a night, so at 6:30 pm on a Friday night, they were already out (dinner starts at 5:00 pm). Instead of bread and butter, we got some sort of pickled turnip with sesame. Very strong in the vinegar/pickled flavor so I wasn't a huge fan. We started with the blistered cherry tomato toast and heirloom tomato salad. The toast has a bit of spiciness to it and overall tasty, and the heirloom tomato was fresh, and the flavors and textures all went nicely together with the oil, basil, and crispy kale. \\n\\nNext we got the lamb's breast and the grilled duck hearts. Wasn't able to taste the lamb, but the duck hearts were superb and if you like anticuchos, it's basically the same juicy, tender flavor. Everything else on the dish was just extra and combined well, but didn't stand out; the cherry oil just felt like I was eating marinara, but overall really glad with my selection. \\n\\nDessert was sweet spooncake and bread pudding with salt ice cream, Now, I love salt, but it was almost too salty and had an interesting aftertaste. The pudding without the ice cream wasn't great but it just wasn't a dish I really enjoyed. The spooncake was made with corn which was a cool twist on typical desserts and the raspberry mousse paired well with everything. \\n\\nOur waitress was fine, didn't really like that they gave our check in the middle of our dessert though.

Like seriously almost perfect.\\nMy wife and I were celebrating our son's first sleepover and someone else's house, and decided to \\"do it up\\" (well, for us, anyway). We ended up spending more than we've ever spent on dinner for 2 (almost $100 including tip - I know, probably a weekly occurrence for many out there, but not for us), but it was worth every penny.\\n\\nOne of the main reasons we don't go out much is that my wife has about a thousand food allergies (gluten, eggs, dairy, soy, yeast...), so it's hard to find a place that will accommodate everything. However, we checked in with them before making our reservation, and the chef assured us that there would be several things on the menu for her to choose from.\\n\\nWhen we first sat down and perused the menu, my wife was initially a little disappointed - the thing she failed to mention was that she's also not much of a seafood fan, and pretty much every entree that didn't have something she was allergic to was a seafood dish.\\n\\nShe ended up ordering the Steelhead - I went with (what I assume to be) their signature \\"special\\" chicken dish. We started out with the roasted vegetable salad, which, from the description on the menu, I thought was pretty much going to be a plate of roasted root vegetables. Instead, it was a nicely presented plate of some (very lightly) roasted root veggies with a generous helping of fluffy greens on top, with a vinaigrette. While it wasn't knock your socks off amazing, it was plenty good and a very nice starter.\\n\\nAs someone below mentioned, the cocktail menu is quite brief - however, as long as what you get is good, I think it hardly matters. And what I got was probably one of the best drinks I've ever had. It's called the Biter, and it's a concoction made with Gin, Chartreuse, and some other stuff that I can't remember - but WOW it was amazingly good. And STRONG. I really didn't feel the need for any more than one!\\n\\nOur entrees came out fairly quickly, and after tucking into her fish, my wife proclaimed it the best fish she'd ever had. She generously agreed to give me a bite, and I have to agree - it was SPECTACULAR. Perfectly fatty and flavorful with a lovely spice crust, perfectly cooked, just awesome. The chicken was excellent as well (although to be honest, I couldn't tell much of a difference between the \\"confit\\" leg and the \\"roasted\\" breast - but no matter, it was all delicious). The farro risotto that came along with the chicken was also very impressive.\\n\\nI also ordered a plate of the house pickles, (fennel, carrot, rhubarb, onion,  celery, egg) which went really nicely with the hearty flavors of my meal. Dessert was salted flourless chocolate cake for her and a scoop of salted creme fraiche ice cream for me. The cake was great, but the real surprise was the ice cream - an amazingly delicate and totally delicious flavor.\\n\\nOverall the ambience was great and the service was mostly spot-on (the only minor misstep occurring when the server forgot to bring my pickles - but no big deal in the grand scheme of things). All in, we had a wonderful experience here and will DEFINITELY be back (especially since we live within walking distance - and the menu changes weekly)! If I had to pick my favorite things out of the meal, it would probably be 1) my cocktail, 2) my wife's fish, and 3) my ice cream. But like I said - it was ALL fantastic!"},{"name":"Fox Bros.

We had been waiting to try out the dinner for a while but didn't want to go during peak tourist season, so this night worked out great for us.\\n\\nTIP: They are currently running a deal for Metro Orlando residents for families of 3 or 4. The price for a family of 3 was $74.95, but the price for individual adults was $58.95. I called the reservations line and asked if we could have the family of 3 price even though just two of us would be attending (since that would save us $45). They laughed at first but then said that was not a problem.\\n\\nThe doors opened at 6pm with a speedy check-in service and quick entry into the facility. You are greeted for a quick photo-op with a pirate before you settle into the bar/pre-show area. Appetizers were brought out when the pre-show began at 6:45pm which ranged from roast beef to pasta to veggie trays; generally the buffet style food was a step above your standard \\"free happy hour\\" fare.\\n\\nTIP: Hold off on buying booze during the pre-show. Although there is a full service bar, the prices are very high. 12 oz domestic bottled beer was 7 bucks, 24 oz domestic draft beer was 14 bucks (with $6.50 refills). Keep in mind, 2 rounds of beer (or soda) are included with your meal once you are in the main show. Also, the prices inside are cheaper. I purchased a 54 oz pitcher of domestic beer for 12 bucks, now that's a good price for just about any bar in the area.\\n\\nThe pre-show was entertaining, though the mostly British crowd seemed unimpressed with the jokes and acts. Audience participation helps make the pre-show more inclusive, but the acrobatic acts really are the only thing worth seeing. \\n\\nOnce the pre-show is you are ushered into the main dinner theater, which is impressive to say the least. A full size pirate ship is located in a large indoor pool with all of the ropes and ladders you would expect. The audience is broken up into one of six different ships surrounding the main ship with seating being banquet style with five rows in each section. All of the seats face the center of the room, so no issues with fighting for a good view. We sat in one of the VIP sections close to the stage because of the low attendance that night (no additional charge), but the seats behind us had just as good of a view.\\n\\nThe first course was a choice of garden salad or creamy veggie soup; we each had the veggie soup. The soup was poured from a pitcher, as expected when in mass production, and it looked like something out of Oliver Twist. Surprisingly enough, the soup actually tasted pretty good though a little too much salt for my taste.\\n\\nThe second course was a choice of pork loin or seafood medley; I took the pork and the wife went with the seafood. Both meals came with a chicken leg, steamed veggies and mashed potatoes. The pork had a nice, cream sauce, a little dry, but average in taste. The chicken was good, seasoned and cooked thoroughly. The wife said the shrimp in her seafood were average in taste with too much butter to add flavor.\\n\\nThe last course was a choice of deserts, but due to the pitcher of beer I purchased, along with the beer shared from our neighboring guests, the only desert I remember was the apple cobbler. The cobbler was very good, served with a side of ice cream.\\n\\nI would rate the food as better than average based on the fact that they are cooking for a couple of hundred people each seating. Just like cruise ship food, every meal won't be the best ever, but you can expect the food to be good.\\n\\nThe real value in the evening was the show. As mentioned previously, we were part of the orange ship and our pirate, Andre, made the evening very interactive and enjoyable. He made rounds through all of the tables talking to people and trying to get us involved in the show. I had volunteered earlier in the pre-show, but Andre was able to get the wife to help out in hauling treasure and raising flags on the ship. The main show was very good, not Blue Man or Cirque, but very good for the value. It can best be explained as a Pirate circus with a variety of acts from trapeze to trampolines to rope swings. A mix of humor and music add to the show; adults and children seemed to have fun.\\n\\nOverall I would rate the food as good, the entertainment as very good, and the overall experience as very good. Considering we had dinner, drinks, and a show for under 80 bucks, I would recommend this place to others."},{"name":"Aria","address":"490 E Paces Ferry Rd NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"I agree with Annie R.

The cornbread is good, I prefer cast iron, but the ridiculously good honey butter spread made up for it! For my entree, I had the eggs benedict. It was also good- personally I thought it would have more spices or unique flavors for a latin themed eggs benie, but it was somewhat standard.

When the waitress brought their correct order she removed our plates from their table and went back to the kitchen, my husband stood up to see what would the correction be(my husband is a retired chef) and YUP, he was right, they added more food and proceeded to bring the touched food to our table, needless to say, my husband told the waitress that had been deliverd to another table , she shook her head and said \\"but I had this recooked\\",  oh boy, hubby was not happy and come to find out the server was the manager.

Luckily we only needed a table for 2, so it was convenient to be seated either at the outside patio, at the bar, or at a regular table (whichever was available first). \\n\\nMy boyfriend and I shared the Chicken and Waffle with a side of their sausage country gravy. Typically I never care for the Chicken and Waffle entr√©e, it's usually just one fried chicken (bone-in) on top of a waffle. Can't I just do the same with ordering Popeyes to-go and making a waffle at home? Screen Door has set the standards high for this dish, it comes with 3 pieces of chicken breast (no bone). Their chicken's fried skin is seasoned with enough flavor to leave you satisfied with every bite. Crispy, salted well, and highly addictive, I found myself loving the fried skin more than the chicken meat itself! The best part was slicing the chicken breasts into pieces and dipping it into their popular country gravy side item. This was ultimate combination to complete the Screen Door brunch experience. The waffle did not stand out in comparison to the other items on my plate, however it was different to see that it was made out of sweet potato.

Yes, it's worth it. Yes, you should definitely do it\\n\\nLook, if you're going to come to Austin for BBQ, you have to go to Franklin. You have to get there super early, and grab a spot in the line of people sitting, standing, and sleeping on the ground and wait patiently until this place opens up. Don't worry, the business has kindly supplied folding chairs for folks who get there early. If you get there later, you can sit on the sidewalk. The line is very social. It's a bit like tailgating. People bring drinks, someone brought a box of donuts and shared it, almost everyone is drinking coffee because gosh darn it's early.\\n\\nAbout a 1/2 hour before the doors open, someone from the restaurant will come out to the line and read out the BBQ meat that's available that day. Plan your order before you get in because once the doors open, the line moves very quickly. You walk past the meat counter, place your order, then order your side, and someone lays it on a tray (or packs it in paper and bags it). \\n\\nDefinitely get the brisket, it's tender, smokey and perfect. The turkey is ok for variety but if you don't care about variety, get double brisket because it's just so good. Also, the pies are so good.

Not only did they forget about the order (it took a very long time and a different waiter to finally bring it to us), but they did not replace the dressing! Lastly, we decided to get the fried mozzarella appetizer. This was maybe the best part of the meal, and I would highly recommend! Overall, olive garden offers a lot of food at a very good price ($11) but it might not be the best place for quality of food.

The fried green tomatoes with goat cheese had a great crisp/tang to them. As evidenced by 3/4 of the group ordering the fried chicken: it's not to skip. It's so juicy and tender, and adding in a forkful of mashed potatoes with honey-thyme jus drizzled over makes for a perfect bite. I'm not the biggest fan of collard greens, which the dish comes with, so I subbed a salad instead (loved how flexible the staff was with this!).\\n\\nAt the end of our meal, we ordered the banana pudding to go, because we were all far too full to eat it there. We dug in after we had a little breathing room; I don't normally love banana-based desserts, but the slight crunch from the brul√©e really elevated the dish for me with the varied texture.\\n\\nLemonade came in cute individual glass bottles that our waiter poured into glasses for us.

General Gaus chicken was the worst I have ever had and I had it in Nashville at 4am drunk.  It had absolutely no chicken in it...all batter.  It was covered with some pink stuff that permanetly stained the table and couldnt be bleached off.  Funny thing sesame chicken had exact same sauce but had a couple seeds on top.  The Beef Teriyaki was mushy and I LOVE beef teriyaki.  Pork Fried Rice was dry and tasted like it was cooked 3 weeks ago.

A week of on and off rain. \\nGot in at around 7:45am. Parking wasn't too bad. A fair bit of street parking in the area. There's also a lot attached to Franklin BBQ. At this point, there's maybe 50 people ahead of us (expect this number to go up since some members of the parties will come earlier to hold spaces for the rest of their squad). Was told by the server that I was likely in the 1pm eating zone - she wasn't too far off as I was eating at around 1:30 - 1:45pm. The server also takes initial estimates so they can inform people in the back of the line if they can expect brisket. Apparently, the turkey is a hot commodity! Done by 1pm and done before I was asked for my estimate. \\n\\nThe Wait: bring a lawn chair, snacks, beer, and fun vibes. It's going to be ~5 hour wait regardless of when you come on a Sat. They also provide lawn chairs to borrow if you forget yours or are out of town. There's a CVS 1 block away for snacks/other goodies if needed. \\n3 pokestops in the area to definitely help pass the time. They also sell cans of beer for $4 for you to enjoy in line. \\n\\nThe food: Came for the moist brisket, stayed for the beef ribs. Was definitely the best brisket I've had. Worth the wait? Maybe. But luckily, they serve up beef ribs on Saturday and wow - so good, so moist, so fatty, so well charred and seasoned on the outside. My mouth waters now just thinking about it.

Waiting in line was similar to tailgating, as you could BYOB and talk to others around you, however, Franklin barbecue stresses that this is a family environment and people can't get out of control. As we waited, Franklin also provided cold water and someone walked around selling beer and koozies in case you did not bring your own. \\n\\nWe finally got to the end of the line around noon.

I also find their business model of \\"once it's gone, it's gone\\" insulting.  I'm pretty sure that Franklin's, just like all the other restaurants I've ever been to, could buy enough food to cook so that they didn't regularly run out before the end of the day if they really wanted to, but instead they use their exclusivity as a marketing ploy, and because they're located in Austin it works.  Needless to say, I am completely unimpressed.  I would not recommend anyone waste their time here and I will not be returning."},{"name":"Guilder","address":"2393 NE Fremont St, Ste B","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"Literally I can't with this place.

The decor is awesome and the ambience is great, however we were sorely disappointed.\\n\\nMy husband and I met 2 of our friends on Saturday night for dinner and drinks.  It seemed like our server was brand new, or just couldn't handle the number of tables in his section.  We ordered drinks (a Sapporo and 2 Fuzzy Momo Bellinis), but we were never brought water.  It took our server over 15 minutes to bring over the Sapporo and when we asked about the Bellinis, he said the bar is really backed up and it would be a few more minutes.\\n\\nWe didn't see our server for quite some time after that and we were all thirsty, so my friend had to go to the host stand and ask for waters.  We tried asking other servers as they walked by, but they just seemed to ignore us.  After waiting another 15 minutes for our drinks from the bar, my friend finally just walked up to the bar to get our drinks.  When he got up there, he was told the Bellini machine was broken and they couldn't make our drinks(not a big deal because things happen-just wish it was our server who told us that and we didn't just waste 30 minutes waiting for a drink).\\n\\nOur server took our food order around 8:45ish, when our reservation was at 8:15, so we have been waiting close to 30 minutes to put our food order in.  We ordered Edamame and Shishito Peppers.  About 20 minutes later our Edamame was brought out but not the peppers.  The manager came over to talk to us, since we had to go to the host stand to ask for water.  He tried to smooth things over, and by that I mean by throwing his server under the bus saying (Yea I think he's just overwhelmed by his section and I'm working him too hard) He asked if there was anything he could get for us and we told him we were waiting on Shishito Peppers.  He proceeded to tell us that they had just sold their last peppers, so we would not be getting part of our appetizers.  He recommended a different appetizer, I believe it was called The Hot Mess, which everyone seemed to enjoy, but still wished they had gotten peppers.  We had to ask them for napkins and utensils, as the table was not set.  The napkin that my fork and knife came out of was disgusting.  I could not tell if it was mold growing on it, or if it was just stained, but I lost part of my appetite.\\n\\nI ordered Chicken Teriyaki and they split 3 rolls.  The chicken teriyaki was brought out first, lukewarm, and was made incorrectly, so right away I asked the server to take it back.  One roll of sushi was brought out at a time and when my chicken teriyaki was finally brought back out to me, everyone else was finished eating their dinner.  I wouldn't have minded about the wait for my entree because mistakes do happen in the kitchen, but it was honestly the worst teriyaki I had ever eaten in my life.  The sauce was not a traditional teriyaki, in the dark brown color and stickiness.  The flavor was very bland and it really did not look appetizing.  I was extremely disappointed.  Our waters were only refilled when we asked for more water, instead of our server keeping an eye on our table and filling them without us having to ask.\\n\\nWhen we were ready for the bill, our server brought it out.  I looked over it and it was wrong.  The 2 Bellinis that we had ordered but could not have were on there and the appetizer that the manager suggested was as well.  That appetizer should not have been on there since what we originally ordered we could not have.  I explained everything to our server and he said he would fix the bill.  The Bellinis and appetizer were taken off, as well as 50%, because of all the trouble we had with our entire experience (that was probably the only thing that the manager did properly the entire time).\\n\\nA dinner that should have taken about an hour, turned into an almost 3 hour dinner.\\nWe will not be returning."},{"name":"Stubb's Bar-B-Q","address":"801 Red River St","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"Texanisches BBQ wie es im Buch steht.

It was clearly just chicken and mashed potatoes and trust me, this was not a mere helping of the two elements.

I saw two people share this very dish that I am describing but for a big guy like me, I thought I could take it down myself......I failed.\\n\\nI had a good portion of the big piece of chicken left which made for a good breakfast the next day.

Is it on your list of places to eat at?\\" And my answer was always, \\"I hear they have great drinks, but I don't know anything about their food.\\" Alas, she was curious, and after a rough week of work, my girlfriend decided to treat me and we went to Lonesome Dove last night.\\n\\nTop to bottom, everything was exceptional. The decor/ambience/atmosphere was classy and upscale, but at the same time pulled back with really cool signed guitars hanging on the wall.\\n\\nI regret that I don't remember our waitress's name, but she was just about 8 months pregnant, and she was an excellent waitress. She was super kind and friendly, great energy and very knowledgable about the menu. Her baby is due on my birthday, and she should name him megazord, because that's what I want to name my future baby and my girlfriend tells me that that's a stupid idea.\\n\\nAnyway, back on topic. The drinks were fantastic. At the end of our meal, our waitress gave us little recipes cards for the drinks that we had there, so that we could make them at home. I just thought that was a neat little touch. One of the cocktails I had was called \\"The Willie\\". It was a whiskey, vermouth, cherry mix that came in a dome with smoking woodchips. As the waiter pulled the dome away, smoke billowed out and the drink was infused with said smoke. I felt like I was drinking whiskey next to a campfire with willie nelson. It was awesome.\\n\\nMost importantly, and why you're probably reading this - the food. I had the green light from my girlfriend to go for the tomahawk wagyu ribeye at $112, but I really just didn't think that was necessary. I got the black garlic crusted wagyu skirt steak. You read that right, skirt steak. Normally the cut reserved for fajitas because it's not respected. The steak was sublime. She had the stuffed tenderloin, and it was maybe even better. They say that's their most popular item, and I understand why.\\n\\nWe also had the mac and cheese, the fois gras sliders (which i could have eaten about 30 of, they were above perfect), elk carpaccio nachos, blue corn lobster hush puppies, a grilled baby octopus salad, and a plate of various meats (like a charcuterie, but not quite, because the meats were cooked instead of cured).\\n\\nOverall, 5 stars, and I rate this place up there with my local favorites, Uchi, Kuneho, Barley Swine, Odd Duck, Counter III 5 Seven (or however it is stylized), and Swift's Attic."},{"name":"Eastland Sushi & Asian Cuisine","address":"16519 SE Mcgillivray Blvd","city":"Vancouver","stars":"3.5","text":"Great sushi.

I would give this place 2.5 stars if I could, but I'll bump it up to 3 since it's new.  One for the ambiance/decor, one for the service, and half for the food/drinks together.  Ultimately, you'll have a nice time if you're looking for a fancy-feeling place in Allston to have a few drinks at, but if you're looking for tasty Asian cuisine, try the many better places just up the road towards Harvard Ave.  Shanghai Gate, for instance.  Detailed review below:\\n\\nAmbiance:\\nDecor is great.  All the details inside are really nice, with a great mix of tables, bars, and lounges.  It's a pretty dark restaurant with lots of red lighting, so the feel it gives off is expensive yet risqu√© and not all that classy.  I guess similar in feel to Lolita or Red Lantern.  It definitely transports you to a higher-end environment, when compared to its location (a block farther out than Harvard Ave. on the B line).  Regarding the crowd, business was slow around 5pm on a Saturday, although it seems like the type of place that would pick up later at night.\\n\\nFood:\\nSSC brands itself as Shanghai street food and traditional Chinese fare.  Hilarious.  This place is American-Chinese food through and through - which is fine, sometimes you just need that pu pu platter - but branding yourself as traditional is a flatout lie.\\nA) Crab Rangoons ($8) - best thing I tried; gives the typical crab rangoon a classy upgrade by really stuffing the wonton skin full with chunks of crab meet.  Nice job.\\nB) Firecracker Short Rib Noodle Soup ($10) - ...no Chinese short rib soup comes with meat that isn't still on the bone.  Chinese people know that the meat next to the bone is the best part, yet the waitress rather proudly told us they trim it off.  Hmm, fine.  That being said, the meat IS very tender and flavorful, easily the best part of the noodle bowl.  The noodles, heaven forgive them, are LO MEIN noodles.  That is NOT the right type of noodle to be using in Chinese noodle bowls.  They were spongy and chewy and altogether unpleasant.  The rest of the bowl was just spicy broth and broccoli - mediocre and nothing to write home about.\\nC) Lion's Head Noodle Soup ($10) - ...sigh, if you want a really good lion's head for about 1/3 the price, go up the street to Shanghai Gate.  SSC's lion's head meatballs were strangely chalky tasting, not good at all.  Otherwise, same complaints as above - they utilized the spongy lo mein noodles, and the soup tasted a little like chicken broth + soy sauce.  Nothing that exciting.\\nD) Chinese Donuts ($7) - now this was impressive.  This takes the traditional post-banquet Chinese dessert of mantou (sweet flour buns) dipped in condensed milk, and gives it a spin.  They fry the mantou, dust it in cinnamon and sugar, and serve it next to a generous scoop of ginger-flavored ice cream.  This was a pretty neat dessert, I'll gladly admit - and truly unique and fusion while remaining tasty.\\n\\nMy BIGGEST complaint about the food is the raw egg that came with the noodle bowls.  Normally, Japanese ramen places (or even Korean bibambap bowls) crack a raw egg on top of the bowl before serving.  That's fine, as long as the surrounding food (broth or rice) is HOT enough to actually cook the egg.  The broth in the noodle bowls was slightly warmer than lukewarm, perfect for eating right away but nowhere near hot enough to cook the egg.  As a result, my noodles ended up coated in egg goo and tasted pretty disgusting.  There was no way to cook the egg, so I ended up leaving most of my bowl (outside of the meat and broccoli) uneaten.  If you're going to do the raw egg trick, keep your soup PIPING hot, like they do in real Asian restaurants.\\n\\nDrinks:\\nMy girlfriend got the Chi Chi ($12?) - pretty much a non-slushy pi√±a colada.  It was strong-tasting, although the cup was OVERFLOWING with ice.  By the time she finished the drink, she wasn't even tipsy, just slightly buzzed - not a good sign for an Asian girl with very low tolerance.  That being said, she said it tasted pretty solid.\\n\\nService:\\nGreat, albeit a little overattentive.  We were literally the only guests in the restaurant, which is probably why they kept checking up on us so often, but they almost seemed too eager to clear our plates and ask us to place additional food/drink orders.  Otherwise, no complaints.  Food came out fast, fresh, and hot.  (Sidenote: I did ask a waitress about the difference between a Tsingtao beer and a Yanjing beer and she told me she thought one was Chinese and the other Japanese...  Totally wrong, and also tells me nothing about the difference in taste, but they're new so hopefully they'll learn the menu quickly.)\\n\\nKey takeaways?  Come here for the decor, for the ambiance, for the expensive underground feel (think rich opium den).  If you're looking for good Chinese food, head over to Shanghai Gate.  If you're even looking for good, reasonably-priced AMERICAN-Chinese food...go somewhere else.

The variety they offer in the buffet style table is a little limited but they are ok.  There's usually a few vegetable items and pasta items.  As for the meat selection, it's decent and they do offer the chicken hearts which i do love but I think your best bet is to come here during peak hours (dinner) to get the best quality of BBQ meat.

I like to think of it as a lazy man's lobster because I don't have to work hard to enjoy the lobster meat.

The service is genuinely warm and they recognize and appreciate their regular customers. \\n\\nThe menu is fairly standard in terms of North Indian food- not a lot of surprises, but good solid quality for what they do offer. The pakoras and samosas are always hot and fresh (never feels like leftover from the lunch buffet, which happens at some places) and the entrees are rich and hearty. Two people can share an entree if you supplement with some bread and apps. Otherwise, you get lunch leftovers the next day- and they do an excellent job packaging up leftovers. The entrees runs 10-15 a person, but like I said, North Indian food is pretty rich (especially the cream sauces) so you can easily get two meals out of it, so it is pretty reasonable.\\n\\nI also really just love the folks that work here. They are genuinely friendly- it isn't fake and stupid service like in some corporate joints. When he says \\"It's good to see you!\\"\\nhe really means it. \\n\\nI don't know why Indian food is generally so pricey in the US. We've lived in South Asia and I know that this stuff is actually not very pricey to make (although it can be time consuming), but this isn't a problem exclusive to Punjab Cafe.  I will say, after coming here for 6+ years, I'm kind of wishing for some new menu items - especially for the veg menu. What they have is great, but I'd love some daily or weekly specials for something out of the usual offerings.\\n\\nIn all, there is really no real alternative to Punjab Cafe in Quincy, Braintree, or Weymouth. The few other options don' hold a candle to the quality and service here. If you want Indian and aren't up for the schlep into Cambridge, this is the place to go. Even with the sparse competition though, these guys haven't gotten lazy and I respect and appreciate their continued commitment to quality and service."},{"name":"The Cowfish Sushi Burger Bar","address":"Universal Citywalk - Orlando, 6000 Universal Blvd","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"So when we got to this place it was pretty nasty outside and they were not far off from closing up shop.

The broth had really great flavor, chashu was melt in your mouth piece of meat but not as flavorful as I anticipated, egg and noodles were perfect. I ordered a cocktail also the Sugrdog that was grapefruit juice, sake and mint. It was refreshing. \\n\\nMark got the Mi-So-Hot which is a blend of miso based tonkotsu soup with ground pork, napa cabbage, bean sprouts and egg. This is a spicy, creamy soup. It was all so heavy. The broth was heavy and then all the stuff in it.\\n\\nFor a small place it has lots of seating. It seems like a big community space. The decor was really nice. You really get the feel that you're in a Japanese place eating ramen. Even though I don't know what places actually look like in Japan but this would look like a nice version. We sat in a row of high tops. My only suggestion is putting hooks under the table so that you can hang your purse. I was sitting in a stool without a back I draped my jacket over my stool and sat on it and then I had to put my purse on the floor.

We told him we seriously do not want it, but would be happy to just get the check for the kids meals which while definitely not great were worth paying for. He then disappeared again. The manager then came over to tell us he had comped our entire bill, which we appreciated and thanked him for. I tried to calmly give him feedback about what the issues we had were and he was entirely condescending and short. We never got angry, we never raised our voices or even our tone.

After we finally brave the crowds to experience brunch on the scene, then I'll reconsider and write again to determine whether or not this truly is \\"As good as it gets\\" 5 star.\\n\\n\\nFirst, I and my entire group absolutely love their catfish. And their pan-fried chicken. The pullet of course is SO hyped I thought a let-down was probable, if not inevitable. Alas we got a huge order of it, and it was devoured instantly, as were the creamy, buttery taters and chicken gravy. Damn, how is it that ANYONE south of the Mason Dixon line lives past the age of 35, eating such victuals, even occasionally? After multiple trips through the south, and long before I discovered the Screen Door, I came to recognize southern cooking not as regional cuisine or even \\"really, really good\\" regional cuisine, but a gift from the heavens, bestowed on humanity for the ages. Screen Door does a very nice job bringing we in the PNW a very reasonable interpretation of that divine gift...\\n\\n\\nIf lovin' Screen Door's brisket is wrong, I don't never, ever wanna be right. Like crushed velour, it tickled the senses, tickled the palate, then tickles your fancy. This is precisely the sort of slow cooked mastery that enables you to savor the meal hours, and perhaps even days later. Take a nice hot shower, or steam sauna, and you'll experience the meal anew, erupting through your pores....\\n\\n\\nI also loved Screen Door's vinegary, spicy, ham-infused Collard Greens. I for one am someone who never tires of eating his greens! SD's dirty beans and rice are also top notch. The mac n cheese, while good and even note-worthy, suffers from the saturation in the market we now see; EVERYBODY has what they think is off-the-chain mac-n-cheese. Very hard for anyone to separate from the pack and distinguish themselves w/this dish--- though my personal favorite @ the moment remains Pepper Box, w/the chorizo. Lawd a-mussy!\\n\\n\\nScreen Door's pulled pork and deep-fried pork chops are odd dogs out on the menu. Didn't care at all for either.... there are natural human limits, vaguely understood and forever unseen, but known by all of us instinctively to protect us from certain lines that just should never be crossed.  Will I get much resistance, or flak, for stating outright that deep-fried pork chops are just NO... not just a skirmish on the frontier, but a flagrant violation. It's sort of reminiscent of recent, very disturbing news stories about how numerous other countries are fully immersed in experimentation, cloning human-animal hybrids. Some lines you just DON'T cross, capisce? It's like tampering in God's Domain.... allow me to step AWAY, so the coming thunderbolts don't deep-fry me, too!    ;p\\n\\n\\nSomeday soon we'll be coming by for that unbelievable brunch I've heard and read so much about.

And boy were we surprised! \\n\\nWe shared the streak frites and the Boston Bibb salad. \\n\\nThe steak frites come with an 8 oz steak and thinly cut fries topped with a house mustard. The steak was cooked a little more than I normally liked, but it was still very good nonetheless. \\n\\nI normally shy away from foofy type salads because of the degree of difficulty. I don't like paying 16 dollars for a salad that tastes like it came out from underneath a weed eater. \\n\\nBut this salad tasted phenomenal , as none of the ingredients overwhelmed any of the other ingredients. The salad itself had green leafy lettuce, blue cheese, walnuts and a fennel vinaigrette.\\n\\nThe slight bitter of the greens, the sweet of the walnuts, the savory of the bits of blue cheese worked all in harmony with the slight tanginess of the vinaigrette. The overall taste was diverse, nuanced, and at the same time understated.\\n\\nThe restaurant itself was quiet and the lighting was low, but not so annoyingly so that you couldn't read anything. The tables and walls were decorated with woods and corks in such a way that it had a bit of a winery motif.\\n\\nAs far as value is concerned, you're getting food that's on par with a tasty n alder but without the high prices of downtown establishments.

Stopped by a couple of times since the creation of their new menu, which is pretty much the same as the old except now they serve poutine and the burgers once again no longer come with fries.  As for why my rating has dropped I am going to blame it on the \\"extras\\" and not the burger.  The cockshake was the saddest, with a ton of cash forked over for what amounted to a very small amount of liquid.  No problem for me as I mostly just ordered one to see what it was like, and in the end it is not liked by me.  They have rotating flavors and if you are a liquor kind of person you may enjoy it, but I didn't find the milkshake base to be very good either.  Having fancy drinks that I don't enjoy is not enough to knock a burger place down a star, but side dishes that you eat is.  The new poutine menu gives you lots of choices (all named after Portland neighborhoods) with both meat and veggie friendly options.  I went with an order that hard gravy, cheese curds, and pastrami.  The parts all tasted fine (the gravy was pretty weak), but together it didn't gel.  The curds were cold and pretty scarce, whereas the pastrami was in big chunks and the fries were all soggy with the gravy that was too liquidish and not flavorful enough.  Mostly my three friends and I just poked at it and decided that next time we will stick to just regular fries (which are pretty good).\\nSo what do you do?!?!  In truth I come here (and will continue to come here) for the burgers.  The fact that I now know to never order a cockshake  isn't that big of a deal to me, but the poutine not being very good actually cut me deep (emotionally).

We continued to order brunch and did find the frittata very good.   When I knew that the boys wouldn't hang any longer, I asked for my portion of the check along with the birthday girl.  The waitress made quite a scene saying that this was not at all an option.  I asked if I could speak with a manager and she said that she would.

I can honestly say it was one of the worst (if not THE worst) dining experiences I've ever had.  \\n\\nI might first mention that we arrived on a Sunday night at 6pm...there was virtually no one else in the restaurant at this time, except for 1 or 2 tables.  the one saving grace of the night is that we were seated almost immediately by one of the waitresses.  however, before we sat down, she informed us (very rudely) that they weren't accepting credit cards for the night and would only take cash.  ok...? \\n\\nshe then proceeds to sit us at a dirty, uncomfortable looking table, and my friend asks if we can sit at a booth instead.  she tells us that the booth is for 4 people, and therefore we can't sit there, even though the table she wanted to seat us at was ALSO for 4 people.  I've worked as a hostess at a restaurant, and can assure you that you should NEVER tell the customer that they can't sit somewhere they want...it's just bad service and any waitress should know that, especially considering the restaurant was virtually empty at that point....\\n\\nshe then gave us menus and came back a little later for our order.  we asked her about a dish that we couldn't find on the menu (a chicken and pasta dish), but had ordered it last time we came and were both craving it.  she told us that was the special, but didn't tell us what it was called, or how much it costs and never even told us what the other specials were (we heard a different waitress reciting the specials to another table behind us, so she was definitely supposed to tell them to us). \\n\\nwe placed our order, 5 minutes later she comes back with what looks like 2 day old bread that tasted even worse than it looked.  she also didn't bring us that yummy hummus that is supposed to come with it.  i had to call her over and ask her for it, but she said (again very rudely) that they didn't have any...she didn't offer us olive oil or anything.  i had to call her over AGAIN for olive oil, and she says \\"i'll have to check if there's a bottle available\\"...huh??? you're an italian restaurant, you should always have olive oil available, and she should have offered it to us in the first place instead of bringing out old bread with nothing to dip it in... at this point, my friend and i are livid, but also ravenous, so we continue to wait for the food...\\n\\n1 hour goes by, and nothing.  how long does it take to make a pasta dish??\\nshe finally brings out a ravioli dish (along with 2 conspicuously dirty white plates) and we tell her it's not the one we ordered. she tells me \\"yes it is\\".  uhhh, no it's not. she asks \\"then what did you order\\"? as if she thought i was lying... we told her the special. she says \\"oh ya\\", and leaves again. she clearly never put the correct order in, and we feared that it might be ANOTHER hour until the right dish is served to us.  \\n\\njust when we thought the night couldn't get any worse, a table behind us asks our waitress for some bread. her response is: \\"i don't want to serve you any bread, because it's day old and not fresh. we're going out to the store to buy more\\"....she says this RIGHT BEHIND US. as if we weren't gonna hear her????? we get up immediately, disgusted, angry, and hungry.  who actually tells a customer that the bread is old, and that you are going to buy more? aren't you supposed to make your own bread? or if you do buy it, shouldn't you at least PRETEND you make your own and not tell customers you're going to buy more?? ughhhh\\n\\nwe got up out of our seats (she saw us leaving and didn't show the least bit of interest)...my friend called the restaurant 5 minutes after we left, and asked to speak to the manager.  the bartender answered and told us that the manager almost never comes to the restaurant (which explains why the waitress acted as she did), but she would give him my friends name and number and he would call her back. that was almost a week ago, and still no response from the manager.  he clearly doesn't care about the quality of his restaurant or wait staff.\\n\\ni might also mention that when we called, the bartender was trying to make excuses for the horrible waitress, by saying they were understaffed that night.  however we got there at 6pm, and there were only a few tables seated and at least 2 waitresses, so it's kinda hard to buy that excuse, especially since we only ordered 1 simple dish.  she didn't seem flustered, she was just flat out RUDE. no way to treat your customers...will definitely NOT be returning here again"},{"name":"YumDiggity","address":"209 Edgewood Ave","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Took my 9 year old daughter here for lunch.

This fairly new eatery was open for lunch and with a reservation, we were quickly seated upon arrival in a spacious eating area with large windows, providing a view of a downtown Austin street. This restaurant's location in downtown Austin was ideal in taking a stroll afterwards to scope out the other nearby hot spots. The inside is cozy and welcoming with an upscale cowboy-style interior. Our booth seats were very comfortable. On to the menu: It was nice that many of the dishes were small and enticing, which allowed for multiple dish pairings. We ordered the veal meatloaf and the beef tenderloin skewer. To start off, we were given several types of bread in a bread basket. My favorite was the cheddar jalape√±o cornbread! For our main dishes, the meat was tender and the portion was quite large. The vegetables were seasoned well and tasted fresh.

The ribs so tender that the meat falls straight off the bone. The sausages are snappy and filled with so much flavor and oil. It's definitely the best Texas style BBQ I have ever had. The briskets are dipped straight into pan grease collected from the cooking process before served. Is it worth the 4 hour wait to eat it? Debatable. I don't regret it but I don't think I will wait this long for Franklin's again. While the cult following around Franklin is impressive, it's deathly greasy and frankly a little sicking. As you eat, you realize the level of grease saturation in these meats, which no doubt makes it taste delicious, but it's a little overkill in my opinion. \\nOne person in our group had instant diarrhea right after the meal, I wanted to puke about 2 hours after the meal and felt pretty sick from my stomach rebelling from my abuse. \\nWhile Franklin's is no doubt delicious, I don't think it's worth the insane wait and should be enjoyed in moderation."},{"name":"Hey Cupcake!","address":"5530 Burnet Rd","city":"Austin","stars":"3","text":"Need a smile?

The food is great but the staff needs help. They've just openness so I'm hoping they are able to fix the issues. \\n\\nI'll start with the positives. The food is delicious. I've been three times and, sadly, I've gotten pretty much the same thing each time. But... That's because it's delicious!! The protein power plate has grilled chicken (cooked perfectly) with caramelized onions and it's over a Greek slaw. Pretty much that is shredded cabbage with vinaigrette and feta. It's so friggin good!\\n\\nTheir side Greek salad is good - nothing special - but a good basic salad. Their chicken and orzo soup is your standard chicken noodle soup. Instead of egg noodles there is orzo, and just a little. I barely had any. The ingredients were fresh  and you could tell everything was hand cut and homemade. Or else they did a heck of a job faking it! My only negative about the soup is traditionally it's a lemon chicken orzo soup. This was not. No lemon flavor to be had. \\n\\nThe areas where they have room for improvement... The staff needs to work out their kinks. The first time I was here I watched plate after plate being sent back to the kitchen. Nothing wrong with the food, just not the right orders. They've also run out of stuff 2/3 of my trips. After waiting 45 minutes my first night (it was a total disaster that night) hey told me they were out of what I ordered. No containers the second night (my to-go order was wrapped in tin foil and no lid for my drink). They are also stingy as heck on the homemade limeade. It's $3 and no refills and they will fill the cup 1/2 way with ice to save from having to add more drink. Then they will leave 2 inches of space in the cup after adding the drink.  (I'm pretty sure it's a rule or something to leave that much room in the cup.) I was a brat and griped both times and they added more of the drink, but come on... \\n\\nLike I said earlier, they are brand new and have some kinks to work out, but it's definitely worth checking out. The food is fresh and delicious!!\\n\\nUpdate - chicken pita is delicious! I asked hem to add some of their slaw, and they did, and it was just a sandwich version of the protein power plate. Absolutely delicious!\\n\\nUpdate x2 - the steak kabobs are terrible! The meet was super tough, super chilly, couldn't cut it with a fork and knife easily. It hurts my Jott you too. Way over salted. The potatoes were good, but the other vegetables were undercooked. Almost raw. Out of all of the other entr√©es, this is the only one that does not come with a side of Greek salad.

Jake's had only the etouffe at lunch. My nice waitress mentioned that they had a crawfish boil normally in the evening and she'd be willing to ask the kitchen if it was available. I said I'd like to try it and was really glad I did.\\n\\nWhen it was served, I was delighted to see such a classic dish. Crawfish in the boiled broth, roast potatoes, a couple of mini corn on the cobbs in a silver bowl along with two slices of garlic bread. I tied my bib around my neck and started cracking away at the shells. It was messy. It was something of a chore.

Food is great. Red brick exterior with a Rustic decor. Flat screen tv's showing sports channels. Heaters on at the outdoor terrace and a nice fire going in the outdoor fire pit. Family of 8 had no line, no waiting, so awesome! It seemed as most other popular eats were either closed or with hour long waits. We enjoyed their most popular dishes as reviewed by other Yelpers. Sweet potato nachos were my favorite! If you don't like spicy, have them put the sriracha sauce on the side. Next favorite were the fried chicken tenderloins. Yum! Crispy & moist! Our group also had the sublime doughnut burger. They enjoyed it but they all preferred the chicken! It was on point. Mac n cheese side was good, not amazing. The loaded fries were a hit! They are topped with pulled pork amongst other stuff. I had a the kimchee pork plate. Delicious meal! The pork was tender and nicely seasoned. The rice was my favorite. It was a moist, red beans with rice flavored with, I think, curry. So yum! I enjoy the not so average flavors in my meals so I really enjoyed it, Couldn't finish it, though. Was already halfway full from the appetizer. Also, enjoyed a nice cup of coffee the waiter freshly brewed for us.

I'm a vegetarian so I normally shy away from restaurants such as this because they normally serve your trypical chicken wings, burgers, and beer (which I'm not a huge fan of).  But, between the portobello-stuffed ravioli, soups and salads, veggie burgers, and tofu Buffalo wings (strange but true and actually delicious), the only problem I normally have is deciding!  The beer choice is pretty extensive as is their mixed drink menu.  I definitely recommend their Long Island Iced Teas, but make sure to have a designated driver that night, as they are strong.\\n\\nI agree that the service leaves a little something to be lacking during peak hours, like Friday and Saturday nights, but when I went for a Saturday late lunch, the staff was perfectly attentive.

The lady never looked at me and then threw 2 hot sauces in the bag. I asked her if I could have 2 more. She did not say or look at me and grabbed one more. I again said, \\"Can I have one more\\", and she rudely turned around  and went to where more were being assembled. I could see that some sauces were just sitting there without the tops on. I could not see what she was doing but when she brought one more, she dropped it in the bag and handed me the bag rather roughly and then let out this evil laugh. It's just hot sauce...but the way she acted made me worried she did something to the sauce so I did not eat it. I realize it is hard to get or keep decent and stable employees in Austin but it seems they could do better. I will never go back there.

There was 17 of us and service was seamless. The birthday girl made 12:30 reservations. We all slowly trickled in and Austin took our drinks orders as we all came in. I enjoyed the Mettle Mimosa (Rose Cava with OJ). It was delicious! It wasn't to sweet, blended nicely and it was a pretty color. Once we all got there and were settled he asked if we wanted come appetizers. He suggested a few plates of Fries and Crumpets. We all said yes. We were a mixed group of people from San Antonio, hungover party goers of SXSW and just some normal folks that fall asleep by 10PM because we're grown up and don't party as much as we used too. The Fries were perfect. They were hand cut fries, just the amount of crispiness and it had the most amazing Aioli. We also had a few plates of Crumpets with jam and butter. It was best describe as a fat pancake without the syrup. I enjoyed it very much. It was fluffy and slightly dense. The butter and jam was a great  compliment to the food pillow going into my belly. \\n\\nAustin finally took all our food orders and as expected it took awhile but we all enjoyed the drinks, conversation and appetizers. I noticed early on that Austin was very meticulous and organized when he was taking our orders. He was counting the seats and writing down accordingly. The space is beautiful. There's huge windows allowing light everywhere which was really nice. We had 2 cloudy, rainy days so the sun was a welcome surprised. They have a really nice outdoor space as well to enjoy dining al fresco. When we were waiting some of us got a little toasty and one of the diners started using the birthday girl's card to fan her self. Right before our food arrived we finally felt the air kick on. Thank goodness! It was starting to get uncomfortable. \\n\\nFinally the parade of food started to emerge from the kitchen. My friend to the left of me including half of our group ordered the Fried Chicken gravy, adorable mini biscuits and pickled jalape√±os. I didn't get a taste but man did it look scrumptious. I kept hearing comments around the table at how juicy it was. I ordered the Shrimp and Grits that had a poached egg. The shrimp was cooked perfectly and seasoned nicely. Andouille Sausage had just the right amount of spice. Grits were so creamy and perfect almost like a creamy polenta. The egg was absolutely perfect. It brought tears to my eyes as I broke the perfect yolk on my grits. I wish this portion was double the size and I really wanted to lick my bowl but that would be inappropriate. Plus there would be 16 people awkwardly looking at me. \\n\\nNow the hard part the check. The birthday girl asked the server if he could split our check and he said he already had it all organized with gratuity. He just needed to know who was taking apps. We all pretty much volunteered so he said he was sprinkle them throughout. It took a moment for him to bring them up but I think it was because he was printing up all the checks out. I could hear the familiar sound of receipts printing. This place is so pretty, food was great, service was good.

The 3 shrimp app was served after we received our entree.....everything was put on the grill at the exact same time, some things were over cooked and under seasoned.

The location is still as charming as ever. Outdoor tables, inside dining room, a nice little bar space, even a room in back with comfy couch seating.  But what on earth has happened to your service?\\n\\nMy party of six met Saturday for brunch.  We had made a reservation here on Yelp and our table was all set up and waiting for us.  So score one for that!  But that's also sort of where the service ended.\\n\\nFirst, part of my group had silverware wrapped in cloth napkins; a couple of us didn't.  So I asked for napkins and was handed a stack of paper cocktail ones.  How do you napkin your lap with little square cocktail papers?  When I explained I wanted a regular napkin, my waiter just looked confused.  So I got up and went over to the server station myself to get them from another employee there.\\n\\nFor that matter, we had to ask for just about everything.  Straws (again, I needed to go help myself), silverware, refills on fountain drinks, butter for biscuits, our bill at the end, etc.  There was just no thought put into serving us at all.  Was it easy enough to ask for these things?  Sure, I guess.  Was our server nice enough?  Sure, I guess.  But it didn't really seem like he cared about our experience.  The biggest part of dining out is the dining *experience* and to have all these things overlooked was just super disappointing. \\n\\nI guess that's how I'd sum Apres Diem up in one word:  disappointing.  \\n\\nI wish the food could have made up for it.  I ordered the scallops and shrimp with grits.  Now, the scallops?  Those were delicious!  I'll give them that.  But the shrimp was rather overcooked and rubbery, the biscuit super tiny and cold, and the grits just lukewarm as well.  You can tell in the picture that cold cheese was just tossed across the top of it all; it was still cold and hard where it didn't land on the grits.   I mean, come on folks.  This isn't even trying.  \\n\\nThe one thing that is good here are their drinks.  I had the Breakfast of Champions (I've had it before; it's still just as good) - and YUM.  And they are currently offering an array of coffee cocktails; a companion had one of those and claimed it to be delicious.  So, hey.  There's the explanation for my second star.

The tasting menu doesn't come in any particular order so you are always surprised to see what is up next. There is something special about not having to decide what to order and just tasting items that the chef chose. Also the spacing between the dishes were on point. There was just enough time to appreciate the dish, anticipate, and be ready for the next upcoming dish. Dishes that really stood out is the mushroom soup, trout, quail, short rib, and cheese plate.

The ribs were falling off the bone and delicious, obviously I should have known that was their specialty (duh it's in their name). The chicken was also amazingly tender with a nice smokey flavor. Both plates came with 2 slices of standard white bread and bbq sauce. The sauce was very good, with a bit of spice but not overwhelming. I would highly recommend both the ribs and chicken, but would suggest steering clear of the pork. The sides were good, but not great.

The interior is dark but inviting with a late night lounge type feel to it. It can be a little loud for dinner patrons but perfect for a night out with friends.\\n\\nThe food is absolutely delicious. However - it lacks variety and can be especially difficult for vegetarians or people who do not eat pork to find something on the menu that they can enjoy. That being said, the menu is creative and every bite I had was delicious. I was hesitant about how the pork arancini would taste but it is hands down the best arancini I have ever tried and was a great appetizer. For my main meal, I shared the steak frites and clams with pork belly with a friend and we ordered the brussell sprouts as a side. The plates are small and they recommend you share for a full meal which we did but the pricing is expensive for the portion size. The clams were alright and a little on the salty side but I am not a big fan of clams as it is so take that with a grain of salt - no pun intended. The steak frites on the other hand was very good and for someone who doesn't really like brussell sprouts, I couldn't get enough of those at W&N - they were just that amazing.\\n\\nThe cocktails - named after beautiful famous women - were great (definitely mixologist concocted) but similar to the food, they were expensive for what you get.  \\n\\nRed was our waitress and she was awesome.

If you come on the weekend, especially for lunch, expect a wait.  The best BBQ items to get here are the beef brisket and the baby back ribs.  Both are tender and flavorful.  The ribs do \\"fall off the bone.\\"  I'm not a fan of the pulled pork.  While the pork is pulled in thick chunks - probably by hand, which is more authentic - the meat is drier than I'm used to.  They only have one type of BBQ sauce at each table (sweet Georgia variety), hot sauces, and a roll of paper towels.\\n\\nTheir cornbread is very good.  Yummy and served in big pieces.  The fried pickle chips, served with ranch dressing, is a good appetizer.  Mac & cheese can be hit or miss.  It's made with shell pasta and is drowning in creamy cheese.  I was disappointed in the fried okra.  Their fried okra is unique in that the okra is breaded and fried whole, as opposed to being sliced into traditional, smaller bite-size pieces and then fried.  A lot of people comment that a dish might be too greasy, but their fried okra wasn't greasy enough!\\n\\nBe sure to ask about their daily specials.  This last time we went, they had a special Fritos side, which was Brunswick stew with chopped onions and shredded cheese on top of Fritos, served directly inside a Fritos chips bag.  They also had special entrees like country fried steak.  The prices seem a little high for BBQ, but they make up for it with large portion sizes.  Unless you come hungry, you will probably end up with leftovers.\\n\\nThe restaurant has both indoor and outdoor seating right on DeKalb Ave.  The parking lot is small, so if you can't find parking there, you can park along the neighborhood side street (Elmira).

The guy who was frying the fries started spraying degreaser all around the inside of the deep fryer. Even if there were two fryers, he was spraying from high enough up that some of the degreaser was clearly going into both sections of the fryer. \\n\\nWe asked what the chemical in the spray bottle was, and the staff told us it was degreaser. When we asked if it was safe for consumption, they said it was not.\\n\\nI'm giving two stars and not one star because I am optimistic that the employee made a mistake and normally Clover's food does not experience contamination from inedible cleaning chemicals. Also, they were really understanding about remaking the fries. That being said, I did see the other staff look over and even ask what he was doing, and then allow him to continue.\\n\\nClover has a great atmosphere - the herb wall in the store was beautiful, as were all the wooden surfaces - and the place in felt clean and minimal. There are also crayons provided for doodling. However, our experience was ultimately marred by our concern over the health safety of the food we were consuming, and we both could only eat a few of our fries (even though they tasted quite good) before tossing them out."},{"name":"Screen Door","address":"2337 E Burnside St","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"If a Southerner or you've spent time in the South and you go here expecting a least a small taste of the South, you will be disappointed.

We waited like 20 minutes for this order and the people seated after us got their order shortly before ours (we ordered way before them). The corn-dog was good but not great. My daughter's hot dog looked like the kind you'd purchase at an department store, you know, the kind you'd get on the machine that rolls them around. Fries were good.  I did only have one item off of the menu, but I cannot imagine waiting around if there was a line out the door to get in.  I'd head down to Avondale Pizza in a minute if I had to wait at all. \\n\\nThe decor and cleanliness were outstanding. Our waitress was pleasant. One thing I did not like (and I hope the owner reads this), is the condescending/sarcastic tone the person running their social media has taken with a few of the followers' question/suggestions. Here's an exchange from a FB user: \\"Visited yesterday - waited an hour for a table and another hour for our food.

I've been here about a million(ish) times, both for weekend brunch and evening tapas and I have not had a single bad experience.\\n\\nFirst of all the food is insanely good and very reasonably priced. The tapas at the bar are only 50 cents from 5-7 during the week, and only $1 the rest of the time. You can either do a combo plate of all of them, or if you're a picky bitch like me you can mix and match. I highly recommend the bacon wrapped date, the chorizo, and the duck confit, although really they're all delicious. And even though they're small and inexpensive, the kitchen staff still puts in so much attention to detail and they're always beautiful. Brunch is also amazing, lotsssss of food and really good options. If you are hungover make sure you get the breakfast burrito. You might still be hungover afterwards but it will at least make you feel like a Real Human again. You can tell the ingredients are super fresh and everything is v v yummy.\\n\\nOkay so ALSO the DRINKS. Masa's bartenders are all incredibly talented and knowledgeable, so the majority of the drink menu are things that the staff have created themselves. The drinks are all super creative and use really unique ingredients. I personally am allergic to tequila so I miss out on a lot of them, but my best friend always gets tequila drinks here and she's loved them all. But basically all I have to do is tell them what I'm in the mood for and I get a delicious drink. BONUS: if you order a High Noon they will literally light an orange peel on fire in front of your eyes and drop it in your drink and it's the coolest.\\n\\nAnd finally, the main reason I love Masa is the staff. Everyone is crazy friendly and I always feel welcome whether I have my shit together and just got off of work and look like an adult person, or I drank way too much the night before and kind of vaguely found some matching clothes to put on and half brushed my hair. I'm nosy so I am constantly asking the staff what they're making or what they think about specific dishes, and they're always really happy and excited to talk about the menu. Special shoutout to my boy Raul who is the world's #1 greatest bartender ever, and that is not an opinion, that is a fact.\\n\\nOkay the end go to Masa right now immediately!"},{"name":"Croissanterie La Marseillaise","address":"1138 Granville Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4","text":"Had the chocolate almond croissant and it was superb.

On that note, stringy pulled pork that doesn't come on a sandwich really doesn't do anything for me, major turnoff. Perhaps I'd feel better if I tried it in that context.

You can't make it vegetarian, because the BROTH is cooked with meat.

I have never heard of vegetarian Ramen. In Japan, vegetarian usually meant ...just seafood. So, if you want to eat traditional Japanese food that is vegetarian, stick to Buddhist Monk cuisine i.e. \\"Shojin Ryori\\". I don't think there are any Shojin Ryori restaurants in America...but you can see what I'm getting at.\\n\\nThe place itself is small and cozy, reminds me a lot of the style of actual Ramen shops in Japan.

The problem was that my husband's entree came with a \\"little extra\\" side dish- there was a hair ball - not a hair but literally a clump of hair mixed and stuck to his ratatouille and potato dish! We did not take a picture as we had absolutely no intention of posting a negative review. However, in light of the lack of effort to remediate the situation I am posting this. First when my husband asked one of the waitresses to get our waiter she questioned why? Upon seeing the hairball she apologized and took his plate away to replace it with a new meal. Now mind the rest of us already had our entrees. Our waiter did not immediately follow up with us nor did anyone offer to take my plate in back to keep it warm until my husband's meal was replaced. So I waited and when his meal came I ate Luke warm food. Not a huge issue but what shocked me was that management did not follow up with us and nothing was said to us. We paid our bill (in full with tip) that's fine as we ate the food. Again in the end no one came to follow up about the issue.

The buzz isn't unwarranted, food-wise, but the supply-demand imbalance and limited hours make it tough to actually buy the product. It seems that both the proprietors and their fans portray the line as a fun part of the experience. Well, what happens if you don't work in Austin and have a three-hour lunch break? You could go on weekends when the lines are even worse.\\n\\nI arrived at 11:06 and was outside in the cold until 12:23. My half hour on the indoor stretch of the line was pleasant by comparison and I got my food around 12:55.\\n\\nI went with a half pound of the universally acclaimed brisket and pushed my boundaries by topping this off with a quarter pound each of pulled pork and turkey, plus a quarter pound of ribs that I upgraded when realizing that was just one rib.\\n\\nI tried both fatty and lean brisket. They weren't severely different, meaning the lean version will please meat fans but not necessary health freaks. My favorite brisket joints include Louie Mueller in Taylor, Texas and (regional sacrilege) NYC's Hill Country. Franklin's may the best-ever in silky smooth juicyness. If it falls short of a 10.0 it's because the smoke quotient could be higher. \\n\\nThe ribs were the juicy, somewhat fatty kind. As with the brisket, I loved the peppery surface area. The pulled pork was the least memorable of the meats; it could just be that I'm biased and didn't like the mixing of barbecue metaphors, with Texas style used on a more southeastern meat. But whereas the brisket doesn't need any adornment, the pulled pork serves as a fine canvas for the barbecue sauces.\\n\\nBarbecue lore often dismisses sauce, yet the trio at Franklin were excellent. The espresso one is the most publicized, and it's certainly innovative, but I found myself more hooked by the dark Texas-style \\"sweet\\" sauce which was actually quite spicy, and the light red vinegar-heavy version, which grew more incendiary with each taste.\\n\\nAnother review referred to the turkey as the sleeper hit. This turkey is good you might think it's pork. I don't know what they did do it but if you think turkey is too boring to get a barbecue joint, you'll be surprised.\\n\\nI spent a long segment of my wait contemplating whether to get potato salad or beans. I knew there was no room for both. The consensus on the sides is that they don't compare to the meat, but I got the beans, which were very appealing.\\n\\nIn summary, there are many excellent items at Frankin, but be sure to plan ahead and free your calendar."},{"name":"South City Kitchen Midtown","address":"1144 Crescent Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4.5","text":"Came here for brunch after graduation.

The dish reminded me of shrimp and grits but elevated to another level.  The Shrimp was seasoned well and grilled to perfection.  It was awesome! \\n\\nKwame ordered the Chicken and Shrimp fajita entr√©e which he enjoyed.  Everything was made from scratch including the tortillas, guac, and refried beans.

The atmosphere is fun (when your not being pushed around while waiting for a table-which happens quite often) and the staff, 95% of the time is extremely friendly and accommodating. I do have to say their demotion from a solid 4-star status is primarily based on being hugely disappointed today when I tried to arrange a birthday dinner for my husband and about 30-40 of our friends in a couple weeks. They take reservations under no circumstances! What can I say-I'm bitter. But thishas seriously been a  drawback when choosing a location for social gatherings. If you've gone there on a weekend night you know how crowded the extremely small bar/waiting area can be. If you haven't experienced the holding pen-BEWARE. I was told we could stand around and they would seat us as soon as the entire party arrived but frankly the thought of that arrangement completely stresses me out!

I have made my rounds of several places in town, and Fox still has the overall edge in my opinion. They may not have the best sauce in the city, but their pulled pork and beef brisket slap down the competition. The mac and cheese has no equal and the sides in general are top notch. If you liked fried pickles and jalapenos, come in for a basket and then move on to the Texas fries or Lopez. The Texas fries are essentially fresh cut fries topped with beef brisket, cheese, jalapenos and bbq sauce. The Lopez is a tater tot mountain covered in their tasty Brunswick stew. Even the grilled pimento cheese is awesome here AND they have a full liquor license.

We are both sushi aficionados, and so we were justifiably skeptical about a restaurant that served raw fish and beef in the same place. But the reviews of Cowfish were kind, so we decided to give it a shot. \\n\\nThe hostess on the ground floor told us the wait would be twenty minutes, so we put our name in and ambled around the lake. After 40 minutes we checked back with the hostess and she told us our number would be up soon and could go upstairs. The hostess inside the restaurant told us after the staff cleaned off some tables they would text us shortly. About fifteen minutes later, both of us were visibly frustrated. The hostess eventually decided to seat us before any text ever came through. \\n\\nI had a feeling that ordering sushi was a suspect idea and I was right. My friend and I ordered three rolls: two sushi rolls and one \\"burgooshi\\" roll. \\"The King's Roll\\" was a mess. It was deep-fried and overloaded with topping. There was more cream cheese in each bite than there was tuna. No part of it seemed fresh. \\n\\nWe ordered a second roll, this one less elaborate: the spicy yellowtail. It was rolled sloppily and seemed like it came out of the frozen section of the supermarket. It had an acidic taste. Usually, when you have good yellowtail, it's very light and even. I was afraid to finish the roll for the sake of my health.\\n\\nWe decided to stay away from the raw stuff. It did not get better. We ordered the Taste Explosion roll from the \\"Burgooshi\\" hybrid menu. I didn't know what \\"Burgooshi\\" was, and I am no better for knowing now. The roll was stuffed with hamburger meat, wrapped in rice and seaweed, and with something inside that tasted more like Heinz 57 than spicy mayo. A tomato and jalapeno sat lazily on top, drenched in a \\"pesto\\" sauce that was more like a sour green goop. To call it bad would be an understatement. It was inedible.\\n\\nOverall, my counterpart and I left most of our dinner on the table.

After my appy there was quiet a wait. There was a large group of people there, and the waitress told us that this was the reason for our long wait. I am a very patient person so when I start getting annoyed, I know it's an unreasonable wait. Finally our food came out.... but wait! We ordered the lamb tajine, not the chicken...... We sent it back, and about 10 minutes later we were given the lamb tajine-if only our meal had come out this quickly from the start.... The waitress asked if we would like a new side dish of rice, and of course we said yes, as our first dish of rice was already cold. The food was okay but not amazing, and the long wait and inconvenience made it less enjoyable. When it was time to pay I asked if we could get a discount- yes that's how annoyed I was at this experience. The waitress said she would ask the manager, who said no, due to the fact that they switched our dishes after the mistake and gave us extra rice (but who wants extra rice anyways.....)\\n\\nOverall I'm not going to come back.... if you can't offer me a discount or a free dessert after I spend 1.5 hours in your restaurant to eat a simple dinner, then it's certainly not worth coming back for."},{"name":"Sonsie","address":"327 Newbury St","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"Ugh.

I asked \\"is this wink and nod?\\" and she said \\"yes\\", then silent.?!   I asked if they had room for dinner for 2.  She said, \\"we are booked until 10pm\\".

The duck was good, but lacked flavor or much sauce/curry and did not come with any rice or anything, just duck and brussels in a bowl ($22).  The lobster was described as a large dish made from a 2lb lobster.   This dish was an entree to feed 1 person, more like a 1 1/4 lb lobster.  Good but nothing special.  For $52, I was disappointed.

We did deal with a charming lady as we were leaving so the bad service does not extend to all staff but it would not be enough for us to go back.\\n\\nAs for the food, it was average at best, definately not worth the $80 per person advertised for the tasting menu that we had. You can get much better food at other Chinese restaurants for a better price and service. 3 of the courses were just your average run of the mill dishes - spinich in broth with tofu skin; soup (my mum makes a better one) and coconut jelly (what a joke, they say they are fine dining yet they serve an item you can get at any dim sum place, no twists or anything different, and dont get me wrong, I actually love coconuy jelly but I was expecting something a bit more original for $80). The Kobe beef ribs was ok but small and the salad was too citrusy. The one dish that I liked was the curried abalone but it was basically chopped up abalone in the sauce they use for portugese baked chicken rice - nothing overly original. \\n\\nThere are a lot of better Chinese restuarants around town than Zen.

If you didn't get enough protein out of this meal, you definitely didn't order enough (pounds).\\n\\nThis is a fantastic place to come in a group and get your hands dirty.  Be prepared to wait in an extremely long, slow-moving line out in the heat, and COME EARLY because they only sell until they run out of meat, which is usually (1:30-2PM before they close up for lunch!!!)\\n\\nI'm not from Texas, so I can't say I have much to compare it to, but I love that the barbecue isn't just various types of meat all buried beneath gallons of generic BBQ sauce.  Each meat has a different flavor cooked right into it that really taste amazing. \\n\\nLet me tell you, I was so confused as to why each group of people carrying a tray from the front counter would have literally a half loaf each of sliced white bread on their trays.  I have never in my life imagined eating barbeque with white bread, and it sounds like such a dry combination, but with so much protein, you definitely need some carbs to balance it all out (...and soak up the excess grease). \\n\\nTips for newbies: \\n1.  Be prepared to order in pounds\\n2.  Be prepared to wait in line\\n3.  Get there early.  We got there at 11:30 and by the time they took our order, one of the meats was already sold out. \\n4,  Try everything!!! but sausages had the BEST flavor, pork ribs fell off the bone, and brisket was so tender!\\n5.

Screen Door is so well-known that it's hard to even mention Portland without this restaurant coming up in the conversation, so I'm glad finally to have gotten the chance to eat here.\\n\\nThe restaurant is easy to find. Right at the intersection of Burnside and 24th (or just look for the blue and yellow building with a line of people outside). We came in the early afternoon, around 1:00, and the estimated wait time was only 25 minutes. It actually turned out to be a few minutes less than that, and we were seated by a friendly hostess right by the window. The ambience of the restaurant reminded me of a bright country farmhouse: exposed wood beams, ceiling fans, medium-brown woods for the furniture and floors, and wall decorations consisting mostly of screen doors (of course) and shelves filled with mason jars of pickled vegetables. The noise level is medium, making conversations easy to hear without yelling but not so quiet that you feel like others are listening in. Service was excellent. Our server was attentive and professional and had great suggestions for food. \\n\\nWe ordered a whole bunch of different items so we could try them all. Each dish is huge, with very generous portions and nothing looking too fancy. I'm pretty sure nobody ever leaves here hungry. I would most highly recommend the chicken and waffles, biscuits and gravy, and the praline-covered bacon (drizzled with maple syrup). The chicken and waffles were the star of the meal - really good seasoning in the breading, perfectly cooked juicy chicken, a large delicious waffle, all covered in maple syrup and stacked high on the plate. Biscuits and gravy were simple and hearty, with a creamy, generous sausage gravy over 2 freshly made biscuits cut in half. The bacon is 2 or 3 large slices, fried to medium crispness, and then covered in chopped pralines and maple syrup - great as a side dish to share. And again, the portions are all very large. At the end of the meal my stomach hurt from eating so much, but it's really hard not to when it's all so delicious.\\n\\nOverall, I was thrilled that Screen Door lived up to the hype and totally delivered an amazing meal. This restaurant is one of the best brunches available in a city that takes brunch very, very seriously.

I'm a HUGE ramen fan, and have been wanting to try this spot for so long, but the weird hours and huge lines (plus the fact I live south) has been a huge deterrent.  \\n\\nBut that all changed yesterday.  Ramen Tatsu-Ya is now open for lunch and, since I work not too far away, I decided I had to make the trip.  On to the review.\\n\\nTatsu-Ya offers a few different kinds of ramen soups, but only one during lunch:  A soy sauce and chicken stock blended base, popular in Tokyo. \\n\\nBroth (5 out of 5): Absolutely delicious.  I pretty much finished the entire bowl, which is sort of a rarity for me.  That's just how good this was.  What made it so good?  The broth was light, but had great salty and savory flavors going.  Ground pepper added a nice kick, as did some fresh garlic (which I added for $.50).  \\n\\nNoodles (4 out of 5):  I don't believe Tatsu-Ya makes their own noodles (few in America do), but I was impressed.  The flavor and body was good, maybe a tad less firm than I prefer, but delicious.  I was a bit disappointed with the amount of noodles I was served, so if you're really hungry, I'd opt for an extra serving.\\n\\nPork (5 out of 5): Excellent.  Perhaps the *best* chashuu pork I've had outside of Japan.  It's fatty, tender, flavorful, and falling apart.  Like the noodles, I just wish they gave you more!  1 piece just isn't enough!\\n\\nI had very high expectations for Tatsu-Ya coming in to this and they were actually exceeded.  It's great to see Tatsu-Ya, along with Michi Ramen a short distance away, elevating ramen from a bargain-bin item at the grocery store to the complex and savory dish that's revered in Japan.

They let you order from a counter and your food is then delivered to you.\\n\\nFood came or extremely fast, at a detriment sadly. The Chashu Bowl we got tasted ok, however it was cold...Not a good sign. The Chashu had a decent flavor but tasted dry. We then received our Tsukemen (dipping ramen). The noodles were cooked well, however for charging us $14, we had one piece of Chashu and half an egg (places in LA we usually get a whole egg and two pieces of Chashu). The piece they gave us again had decent flavor but tasted dry. The dipping sauce was the worst however. It literally tasted like In and Out dressing watered down and oily. There was no flavor whatsoever. The thing that made it catastrophic was that the Tsukemen sauce was COLD. Seriously guys...you need to make sure the food is hot before you serve it to people...especially in Tsukemen the sauce needs to be hot. \\n\\nIf you're looking for a trendy place to have some Ramen, Ramen Tatsu-Ya is ok.

The only complaint is the wait time to get into this place sometimes, because it's that popular and that pleasing to groups who can't make up their minds. \\n\\nSushi has always been pretty amazing when it comes to a theme park restaurant. Each unique roll is a treat unlike what you can get at a normal sushi place, which is a great departure and makes the experience memorable. The burgers are absolutely ridiculous in both size and flavor, which makes them perfect for people who dislike sushi. The menu is a great play on fusion cuisine, while still providing separates for those that only want one style of cooking.\\n\\nDrinks are well worth their price as they both taste amazing, but also are perfect pours.

The entire time they acted as if it was our privilege to dine at their extremely empty \\"soft opening\\" restaurant. There's a 13 dollar all you can eat lunch special- dont bother. The service is so slow you won't even get your moneys worth. \\nThe waitress took the alacarte menu as soon as we sat down without asking if we were getting the AYCE special, the first red flag that we were getting ripped off. We had to go get one ourselves and when we told the waitress we were ordering alacarte she seemed very annoyed with us and would not return to take our order. 20 minutes later we get the waters we asked for when we sat down. They are so cheap that when we asked for straws they had the nerve to ask \\"how many do you need?\\" for a table of 3. It's frickin straws.\\n From this point on our waitress was very rude with us, all but throwing down our plates when they arrived. On top of that, i ordered a few BBQ items for the little grill in the middle of our table. She came over 10 minutes after we ordered and told me in a condescending tone that i had mistakenly ordered off the BBQ menu and so she left that off our order. No \\"what would you like instead\\" or anything, just that she didn't include that in our order because i guess she assumed i was a dumb tourist. I knew I was ordering off the bbq menu, which I told her, but then just changed to a rice bowl so i could have some damn food. I suspect she left off my whole part of the order because they didn't want to turn on the grill! \\nAnd here's the kicker. When we finally got the check, we found that she had added a 15% gratuity for herself to it! On a table of three! We asked the friendly table next to us that was leaving and they had no such service charge, likely because they weren't white tourists. When we asked her about it she pretended like she didn't understand us, until we pointed out their sign saying they would apply a service charge to tables of more than six and we were only three. We didn't even get AYCE which would have been a lot of dishes, we got three rice bowls and a few appetizers! She said something angrily in chinese before fixing our receipt. Honestly i don't even trust this place with my credit card info.

Ironically, this was the complete opposite of what our experience was going to shape up to be.\\n\\nWe were seated quickly, and had questions for our waiter who didn't seem to know answers to anything at all. I ordered an Earl Grey tea, and asked for steamed almond milk to make it a latte. Waiter said that they couldn't heat the almond milk, even though they had it, which I thought was weird. We asked about the pastry of the day which he didn't know, and asked if the Cinnamon Rolls ($4.50) were ready, which he also didn't know. After a long wait for the drinks, he still didn't ask about the pastries or the roll, which we eventually did get, but was caramely and unimpressive.\\n\\nFor our meal, we ordered the Signature Sandwich ($6.50) with a side of the Home Fries ($4), and the Lox and Bagel ($15), which I asked for with extra capers. The sando came with no egg, which was wrong, and my bagel had no extra capers, and had lox literally pooling in olive oil. When the waiter came to check on our food, we asked if the signature sando was supposed to have an egg, which he stammered a yes, and shuffled off to get it fixed. WAY too long later, he eventually brought the right sando back to us, but by that point my husband was both annoyed and bored with waiting any longer.

Thank goodness there was a nice breeze outside or I wouldn't of stayed in line for soup. The inside is pretty small and all the seating is shared even if you filled two seats out of a table for four. My husband ordered the #1 while I ordered the #2. If you want your broth spicy, they charge an extra buck for a dollop of spicy paste. It was kind of weird that they just didn't have this as a condiment on the table...We also ordered the spicy edamame which all you yelpers recommended.\\n\\nThe ramen was quick to come out and both the broth and noodles were excellent. The pork belly was also excellent and melted in your mouth. The only complaint with the ramen was that my #2 became pretty salty as I continued to eat it. It was the shoyu i ordered so it may just be me. \\n\\nI was pretty disappointed in the spicy edamame. It came out when we were already done with our ramen. It looked like everyone was getting their appetizers at the end of their meal so maybe they were short in the kitchen. The edamame was undercooked and the spices didn't really go together well. There were jalape√±os in there and for some reason it reminded me of those pickled jalape√±os you would get with nachos...haha.\\n\\nNext time I will try the #1 as my husband loved it."},{"name":"Grass Roots Cafe","address":"N Mississippi Ave and N Fremont St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Ellis makes the best burgers!

For the last couple years I have dragged my wife to almost every BBQ joint with a score of 4 or better in the magazine. We have been to Louie Mueller in Taylor, Black's in Lockhart, Snow's in Lexington to name a few. We would have gone to Franklin sooner, but I am not much for waiting in lines for 5 hours. I had been trying for months to get a takeout spot and the opportunity finally came this past Sunday. We ordered the brisket (of course), ribs and a few links. The staff was really awesome, sweet as a Fredricksburg peach. I love all of the Americana type theme they have going and especially they gnome at the counter...total Austin! So the que...the bag was seriously heavy with five lbs of BBQ in it. When we got to the place we were staying my first thought was wow that is a saturated piece of butcher paper. I am not used to having that much saturation from rendered fat. However, I don't think that many places (even the famous ones) use as high of grade marbled beef as Franklin BBQ, so I won't knock it for that as I am not used to that. The flavor of the brisket was nice and salty and peppery. I felt like the smoke didn't have those subtle nuances of caramel and toasted nuts like Blacks or Louie Muellers, but it was still melt in the mouth goodness. The espresso sauce that comes with the brisket was really great. The coffee helps to bite into the fattiness of the brisket. The sauce is thicker than the one they sell at HEB with the same name and much better. Now the ribs were not what I was expecting. They are the standard Texas full spare ribs. The rub seemed to only be of the dalmatian variety similar to the brisket. I didn't detect any granulated garlic, barely any paprika or the usual suspects at other restaurants. The flavor was akin to a piece of peppery jerky from Buckies. It was interesting but not my cup of tea. There was also a lot of unrendered gristle at the tips of the ribs. It is also kind of odd that they leave the silverskin on the bottom of the racks. The classic Texas sauce that came with it was way too cumin forward but still tasty. The links were kinda blah but my three year old son gobbled them up. I really hate not giving Franklin 5 stars but I would be dishonest if I did. I think a lot of the hype about this place is the limited supply and the 5 hour wait. I think after waiting in line for that long a Nike shoe with BBQ sauce would be awesome. I respect Aaron Franklin for starting out with nothing and becoming a national celebrity from his hard work. I love the style of this place and the Austin vibe, but I hate to say it but there is better Central Texas BBQ out there."},{"name":"Fox Bros.

The meat was tender and flavorful on its own - throw in your mix and match of sauces, and the result was fantastic.  The cucumber-tomato slaw that accompanied the meal was tangy with a nice onion overtone.  The meal came with a peach crisp for dessert.

Anyway, this place seemed to be on the up-and-up, good average reviews, trend was holding steady at about 3 or 4 stars (don't remember).  The egg drop soup, despite the peas, was okay.  The shrimp fried rice was too greasy and too salty.  I had to choke it down with some Sriracha and some mild curry.

The sign outside is visible which is what drew my friend and me in for a late lunch on a rainy day. We walked in to a quiet, but nice establishment. It was fitting to be called a bistro because of the decor (dark wood tables and chairs). There were a few customers at the bar with a bartender tending to them. We noticed a cook in the open \\"window\\" behind the cashier stand. The bartender greeted us and said we could sit anywhere; being that my friend and I are kind of on the loud side, we opted to sit in the corner away from the bar and where there were lots of light coming through the big windows. The lower half of the windows have frosting decor which gave it a cool feel. A few minutes went by and the bartender/waiter finally came by with the menus. He lowered the lunch menus and Happy Hour menu just a few inches from the table then dropped them. (The Happy Hour menu slid to me. I guess it's like sitting at the bar and having a glass of beer slide down the counter top to me? Weird.) I used to be a waitress and that's not normal. I didn't understand the behavior. He murmured the lunch specials over his shoulder because he started to walk away before even finishing a sentence. My friend ordered two BLT sliders and I got the BLT2 (on toasted wheat bread). My friend was happy with her sliders, but my \\"toasted\\" wheat bread was burnt. Not a little over toasty, but BURNT. Seriously, I could not believe that the cook/waiter thought it would be okay to serve burnt bread to me for $7 plus tax!?? They need to watch an episode or two of \\"Kitchen Nightmares\\" and apply some good lessons from Chef Gordan Ramsay. I may return for another try as I have an office space nearby in downtown Vancouver, but Charlie's Bistro needs to figure out their standard of quality in both food and service. P.S. I ordered a Coke, but it didn't have enough fizz so it was kind of flat and had so much syrup that it was all sugar.

You show me a person who likes fried raw watery cucumber and I'll gladly hand them a dish of Stubb's okra.

She tells me that of the most recent two beers, one actually was a Stella and that I will have to pay for that.  I remind her that of the three Barcas we ordered, we received two Stellas and one Barca and that I will happily pay for what I ordered.  She says that there is no possible way to change the bill, never apologizes, and simply says that I can tip her $2 if I please. I tipped her 15% which after checking with a lady who used to work as a waitress, said that the tip was excessive given her shameful service.  \\n\\nI don't care about $5 and I'm not looking for any fancy service, just a friendly beer with some friends.  I feel like at any other establishment, a reasonable waitress would've realized her mistake (which was a tiny mistake in the grand scheme), mentioned, perhaps brought the proper beer afterward and certainly corrected the bill to reflect our orders.  None of us were looking for handouts and we certainly aren't cheapskates.  We all left so surprised and reflected back to when we were trying to find jobs in the restaurant/bar industry.

I get it pretty much every time I go and it is always exactly what I am craving: tender, juicy, and packed with slow cooked flavor. Of course, then I drench it in the soul fire or pit boss sauces (or both). The most recent time we went, we tried the fried Mac and cheese which was outrageously decadent, but very worth the calories. My boyfriend is very health conscious and often gets the smoked chicken salad (though he steals his fare share of my sandwich.) It's a very healthy option if you are trying to watch your weight but want that distinct smoked flavor. BBQ sauce makes for an excellent dressing as well.\\nWant  to know something else really rad about this place? You can wash down all that delicious smoky BBQ with a nice cold **$2.50** pint of PBR. This may be the cheapest price in the city, which is truly a special find in a place where happy hour Is outlawed. Truly a  mecca for cheap beer lovers and BBQ alike. \\nMy only gripe with this place (though I continue to return anyways because the food is so darn good) is that service is always a bit spotty. Always friendly and well-meaning, but a bit absent-minded  and confused. On three separate occasions, our waiter forgot one or two aspects of our order and had to put it in late after we did not receive it.

In this case through Uber eats. The food was delivered fresh, tepid, which is not necessarily the restaurants fault but a combination of what the food was like when they received it, the carrying case that the Uber eats person kept it in and how far you live from the restaurant. I'm not usually very critical there. Lastly, the staff.  I see many comments on here about the staff being less than stellar, in this case I one hundred percent agree. They have blocked off all desserts and drinks because people keep messing up the order. The way to handle that issue is to make sure that your staff is providing all of the necessary components to the driver. If someone calls in and request that they be given special consideration for a drink or dessert order, recognize that this is a repeat customer and you should probably make an exception. That stunk that you didn't do it and my opinion has declined as a result. No mas, there's a recurring theme here, your staff needs some lessons in customer service. otherwise I find the food delicious most of the time.

The waffle was not too sweet and the twist of sweet potato gave it an interesting flavor which complimented the entire dish.

Easily shareable between 2-3 people.  The selected malbec paired nicely with the mussels.  Next, I had the chicken rigatoni with chorizo.  It too was a large portion size.  The pasta was cooked perfectly and tossed in a delicious cream sauce. The chicken and chorizo added a nice flavor to the dish.  On other occasions, I have tried their sandwiches  (all very good).

Five Guys, Wendy's, Burger King, even McDonalds have much better burgers. \\n\\nThat being said their fries are phenomenal- shoestring type fries prepared to excellent crispy goodness, Also had a vanilla shake made with Hagen Daz ice cream- really really good.\\n\\nSo burgers NO but fries and shake a resounding Yes."},{"name":"South City Kitchen Midtown","address":"1144 Crescent Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4.5","text":"We were visiting from LA and a few friends told us to meet there  for lunch.

The wheat bread is sliced thick. You can choose chips or another side and of course upgrade to fries for an additional fee.

I have a friend who refers to the product as \\"Chicken Valvoline\\", but it's always been a guilty pleasure of mine. \\n\\nWell, this month, the push is on for the new \\"wrapstar.\\" It sounded good, so I decided to take the hike and give it a shot.\\n\\nOh, dear. The person at the counter (whose nametag said, \\"manager\\") was downright curt, the prices were well higher than I remembered them, and the much-vaunted wrapstar was essentially an extra large twister with salsa and corn chips inside.

I may be crazy but I submit that the beef fajitas here could be some of the best in the world.  They are at least the best I have ever had and at around 12$ with sides, they are an awesome value. What makes the fajitas unique are the mixture of Tex-Mex and cajun spices, and what tastes like home made tortillas, truly a match made in heaven.  Having said that the rest of the menu is pretty descent, however  being that this is a Tex-mex / Cajun menu a lot gets offered but a little is missing.  As an example, the fish tacos are tasty fried but lacking a key ingredient - shredded cabbage.  I asked for it and they don't offer it.  I often see this with restaurants that have expansive menus, they often miss out on small details.  No matter, the margaritas are inexpensive, the chips and salsa is unlimited and the service is super brisk and friendly! This is a \\"go-to\\" place for a college budget first date, or to take out visiting family or coworkers! Just stick to the basics, endless chips/salsa, Fajitas, and Margaritas or iced tea.

Only major problem is choosing between lamb, chicken or beef and what toppings to have - they offer several styles of donair and even have the maritimer sauce, if that is your thing.\\n\\nOnly  problem is that they experience quite a rush during the lunch hour and I've only ever seen the owner working the counter by himself.  As much as he'd like to serve everyone, it is quite impossible and it can get a bit frustrating and confusing with people coming and going.  Sometimes people call in orders and seem to be jumping the line when they breeze in and step in front of those who are standing there patiently waiting.  It makes me wish that he would implement some sort of system where those who are there in person could place order and leave and come back but he didn't seem to be open to that idea.

If I could I would give this delicious ramen spot 3.5 stars. As a ramen lover, there was a lot to appreciate in this meal but not without some flaws. I thought the dipping sauce was a bit too oily. It hit my stomach hard. The noodles for the dipping were very soft, almost how I'd want spaghetti not ramen. There was only one piece of chasu pork and half of an ajitama which for the price seemed like not quite enough.  The noodles for the hot miso were very thin, which looked appealing but when eaten I thought the noodle got lost and couldn't hold the broth well. The apps were all fantastic though. Perfect portions and bold flavors. As for ambiance, I didn't like the rushed feeling walking in. I felt the pressure to choose quickly and not ask questions, even though we'd gotten there before the real serious lines ever formed.  Gotta say I went in with an open mind but prefer other up and coming ramen spots. If interested in another pristine ramen place in Austin, check out Michi Ramen.

The condiment bar has a good selection of tasty additions including pico de gallo, lime wedges, and jalapenos, and they are meticulous about keeping it stocked and fresh. I also enjoy the tea (half sweet and half regular) in a giant styrofoam cup. Finally, we almost always get the oreo-topped chocolate pudding. Yum.\\n\\nThe decor - you've got your share of funky old signs and such on the wall, baseball trophy's sitting on top of the TV (usually has a game on). The music is invariably country, but you have to acknowledge the consistency of the music with the overall experience, even if you don't particular like country music (if you don't like country, you might be a hipster..just sayin).\\n\\nFinally, even beyond the food and decor, there's good people here. They're friendly and they're nice to my crazy kids when I'm just about out of energy. During the summer of 2009, when I'd been laid off and money was tight, they ran a special where kid meals (which included a big ole piece of chicken and pile of mac n cheese) were a dollar with the purchase of a regular meal. I was able to bring in my three hungry munchkins and feed them and myself REAL food for under $20. That's cheaper than Thundercloud (my other go-to place).\\n\\nGive them a try.

Most of the brunch items come with grits, score! There are like three benedict variations on the menu, double score! Chicken and waffles and Shrimps and Grits, triple score! How do I choose?\\n\\nTo start I made a reservation at 1:30 and two out of four were there at 1:30. We requested a patio table and they said they would get one ready. About 15 minutes later, I went back to the host to advise we changed our mind because we didn't want to wait any longer and was told that they do have a patio table and they would get us right out. So I am a little confused on what actually happened for those 15 minutes. \\n\\nThey start you off with a complimentary basket of corn muffins and biscuits. They were room temperature but moist and good. I went with the smoke roasted beef benedict with red mule grits. Presentation was lovely, but I think I would have liked a larger serving size.   Or maybe I am greedy, but that neither here nor there.  Moving along, the brisket was tender but it definitely could have had more of the smoke flavor. One of my eggs was over poached but I didn't want to make a fuss since we had some other issues at the table.  The grits were good, I added some cheese but I definitely wanted a larger portion!!  Some of the dishes came with the grits in a separate bowl and looked to be a larger serving then what they spread on my plate. Overall my dish was okay.  My friend had the lump crab benedict and our dishes looked pretty much the same except her eggs were fine but her grits were cold and clumpy. So she had to request another order of hot grits. Another friend ordered the BBQ Pork Benedict. She was able to have her eggs fried rather than poached. We did notice that the BBQ pork had no BBQ sauce, so I am not sure if they are going for flavor rather than the sauce? Not sure. But my friend requested some sauce and it kind of took a while and her plate got cold. BBQ sauce should not take that long. So she requested a fresh plate and requested the sauce be on the pork.  Well the kitchen got a little happy and poured BBQ sauce all over the eggs. She didn't mind, but I think it was a little unnecessary. If the dish does not come with BBQ sauce, I feel like the waitress should have mentioned that only because when I hear BBQ I think of sauce as all of us at the table did as well. \\n\\nThe service was okay and the food was okay.  I have tried the Vining's location and that was a 5 star experience.  Although none of us ordered the chicken, the plates of chicken coming out looked delicious!!!! Not sure what happened here but  I left wanting more of something else."},{"name":"Screen Door","address":"2337 E Burnside St","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"Wow, the portions are huge here - we made the rookie mistake of ordering 1 dish/person, when we could have split the chicken and waffles and been more than satisfied.

However, that is really all it has going for it. Their brunch items sound delightful on the menu and make it hard to decide, but when presented, the items are nothing special. The Hash, linguistically enchanting, is an uninspired mixture of prime rib and homefries, nothing like the crispy, carby delicacy of my dreams. Freshly squeezed orange juice is a six dollar double shot of barely chilled Tropicana, and receiving excellent service is waiting longer than 30 minutes for our order while twiddling our thumbs.\\n\\nA guest should never have to get up and find a server to ask where their food is once, much less multiple times.

She most certainly did not take steps to resolve the issue at first contact, and should be trained on customer service techniques, as her current ones are appalling.\\n\\nSonsie is not worth your time, even to try.

My friends and I were all Asian, a few Chinese, so the waiter immediately began to speak in rapid Chinese, which sort of threw me off. However, after we sat down, the service was quite terrible. The food was okay, but I discovered that I was not a fan of Chinese cuisine. Since that was more my personal preference, I decided to just sit and smile and be polite. I was then eating part of a dish, but then found a hair in it. Okay so that happens, but I decided to not leave a tip because frankly it was disgusting.

Whenever I have high hopes for a place (see: O'Sullivans or UBurger to start) I'm severely disappointed. I read \\"best of\\" lists or read a great review on Yelp or plain old word of mouth that gets me excited for a burger, but 9 times out of ten it's just not very good. Christopher's has all the accolades, in fact, Food Network recently claimed it to be the best burger in Massachusetts. But it's painstakingly average, it's a pub burger and no more. I love the location, it's Cambridge, and the Porter Square area, and it brings back fond memories of culinary school for me as we used to frequent here for a drink or four after a hard day in the kitchen. Walking over to Christopher's last night we walked by my alma mater and saw some hopeful culinary students in class, ah the memories. I was excited to be back in my old neighborhood and I was excited because I was so sure we were in for great burger. They list a few different options, but to be fair and consistent, I have to keep ordering the same thing, a bacon burger for me and the English burger for Nick (marinated in Ale, topped with cheddar, bacon and served on an English muffin). I immediately know I'm in trouble when presented open-faced, there is a good inch between the meat and the space to the bun, too much bread will be a problem. The burger has grill marks on it, and of course my preference is griddled, but I'm open-minded, unfortunately the meat, while relatively tasty, is totally dry despite being cooked properly. (no easy feat) The fries are good, pub fries basically, but seasoned good, if not a little skimpy on the portions. The burger is supposed to be six ounces, but it doesn't feel six ounces, and the biggest problem really is the bread. It takes a couple of warm-up bites to get through the first layer of bread to even reach the meat, even then it's a struggle, it's way too big a bite while still being cheap with the meat. (again, no easy feat) It's totally average, and a huge letdown. Nick claims to barely pick up any hint of the Ale, his cheese is not fully melted (surprise surprise) and he also faces the same bread problem. Despite having a cool neighborhood feel, it's quiet enough that you can actually have a conversation, and the menu at least boasts several options for everyone, it just isn't very good, and certainly not very memorable.

You can tell that their food was good when they were still busy at 2:30pm on a Tuesday afternoon by the number of soup bowls around the cafeteria.  You can also tell what kind of soup people buy by the type of bowls.  I really wanted to try their clam chowder but they didn't have any available.  I settle for their chicken pot pie soup.  The soup was very flavourful and the chicken was juicy. It actually comes with a side of spring mix salad with balsamic vinaigrette.  The salad was not as exciting or memorable.  Had there been a fresh homemade bun or bread stick on the side it would have made more of an impact. Overall, it was delicious soup but definitely pricey at ~$11 for a bowl of soup at the food court.

It was a tad bit overdone (but maybe I'm not good at ordering flesh yet)...and there was a lot of bun. The fries were crisp and satisfying.\\n\\nIt was a \\"meh\\" experience (realize I will only eat a burger about twice a year, if even that, so i was looking for an ecstatic experience)...\\n\\nHOWEVER i recently returned to Foster Burger and partook in the veggie burger.

One of my favorite brunch places in Boston, and I'm the kinda gal who would eat brunch for every meal ever. This is a little different than the standard American classic breakfast of eggs, bacon, and toast. Everything here has a little mexican flair. But you will love every second of it.\\n\\nFirst tip, always make a reservation. We usually go on Saturday mornings when they serve a prix fixe brunch, and it is always super crowded. But with a quick reservation online, you are all set to go. The place is very chic looking with booths and tables. At times, it's a bit crowded, but I can't say it's ever taken away from the experience. The service (aside from one time) is always excellent. And the food... let me tell you about the food.\\n\\nYou always start out with a warm basket of cornbread that will make your insides melt. It comes with a side of three different spreads. The prix fixe menu has a bunch of great choices. You can start with either a caramel empanada or a fruit cup (fruit is fabulous). You get unlimited coffee or tea and a choice of entrees. The huevos rancheros are amazing. The eggs are a bitty runny, but its delicious. The chorizo is also incredible as well as the homefries. \\n\\nAlthough I don't drink tequila, I've heard the margaritas are to die for here. The bartender was nice enough to make my mimosa with cranberry, instead of orange juice. And the servers never have a problem bringing us more corn bread. I *love* this place, and I highly recommend giving it a try for brunch. The closest T stops are Tufts Medical Center (orange line) and Arlington (Green Line)."},{"name":"Bandini Pizza & Pasta","address":"3107 N Lombard St","city":"Portland","stars":"3","text":"I've been craving pasta lately and had not tried this place yet, so I ordered some pasta online to pick up.

Plus the delivery charge was only a dollar. Score! \\nFood was delivered hot, despite the last minute change. The pasta was very tasty and filling. Boyfriend got the chicken parm, which looked/tasted amazing and was covered in a generous amount of cheese.

We boarded our Limes and scooted right on up to the outdoor bar where we were promptly greeted with menus.\\n\\nThe atmosphere at Milestone 229 is just fabulous. The outdoor bar has wonderful views of Bicentennial Park and downtown in general. I have to say that the restaurant itself is a bit pricey, but the happy hour menu is fantastic. Beer is $4, cocktails and wine are $6, and there's an assortment of what they call \\"happy food\\" (mainly appetizers and pizzas from the regular menu) for only $6 as well. So, why the three stars? I'll break down everything we tried below...\\n\\nDrinks:\\n- Blackberry Bramble: On the menu it claims to have vodka, blackberries, lemon, and simple syrup. I didn't taste one lick of vodka and the execution came off like a watered down, less bubbly version of La Croix. Pass!\\n- Red Sangria: Fantastic. One of the better sangrias I've had in the city. It was rich and flavorful and I'd definitely order this again.\\n- Milestone Mule: I only tried one sip, but it was delicious. I'm not a huge mule fan but I would recommend this if mules are your thing!\\n\\nFood: \\n- This is where it gets a little tricky. You'll see my photos attached contrasting the two pizzas we tried. My friend ordered the meat pizza (Bye Bye Miss America Pie). It was nothing to write home about, but was a solid meat lovers pizza and we both enjoyed it. On happy hour pricing, it was definitely worth it! My pizza on the other hand (Cherry Tomato) came out completely undercooked to the point that it was inedible. The dough was raw (barely browned) and there was honestly just way too much cheese on it. I took two bites and didn't have any more. It was such a disappointment, especially when I noticed other people around me ordering this pizza and having theirs look much more edible than mine. It must have been a fluke, but consistency is key, especially at a restaurant as nice as this one. This isn't your corner bar. If I had paid full price for this pizza ($13.25 on the dinner menu!) I would have been upset to say the least.\\n- Four Snacks: My friend and I agreed that this was the star of the show. Four different tiny appetizers, and they were all delicious. I especially loved the pickles! Absolutely would order this again.\\n\\nMy first trip to Milestone 229 was...confusing to say the least! Parts of the experience were amazing, and other parts just fell short.

Get over yourselves.  $14 for three measly pieces of fried chicken (one wing, one thigh, and half of a chicken breast) .... $15 for one piece of catfish.  Entrees are a la carte and if you want sides to go with your protein, it will be an additional $5 - $10 per individual portioned side.  It's clear the restaurant pushes the family style for $42 but not having the ability to pick our own apps and sides steered us away from going the family style route.  Not to mention, $42 was pretty steep for fried chicken and a few sides.  While the food was good, I would not say it was worth the $60 we paid for fried chicken, catfish, Mac and cheese and mushrooms.  We will likely not be back.

I couldn't decide if the story was meant to be geared towards adults or children, but then again I don't think the actors really knew either.  10 minutes into the show we had to leave, it is loud, the actors mics were way to loud, the sound effects were way to loud, there just wasn't anything this show really had going for it.  The only reason we made it 10 minutes into the show was because it took us 5 minutes deciding on how our group of 8 was going to exit the theater.

It won't kill you to park in the overflow lot across the street and walk 80 yards for one of the best meals around.\\n\\nNow, for the food:\\n\\nMr. Meat-Eater selected the pork chop dressed in pear brandy demi glace, and I, being a lover of the Omega-3s and having made the choice to go to a seafood grill, chose the seafood sampler plate. My plate had a good portion of fresh salmon dressed in a mango salsa, an excellent crab cake, and a piece of breaded cod. Alongside were some vegetables and mashed potatoes.\\n\\nI'm not sure why all the seafood places around here serve mashed potates with fish. In the part of the world that I am from, seafood is served with rice. I have a sense I am being dragged, screaming and kicking, into the world where the potato rules. Oh well. The mashed potatoes were actually pretty good. I just don't get the combination with fish at all.

Jackson eating that \\"one tasty burger\\" on the wall when you walk in -- so atmosphere and decor get 5/5 stars.\\n\\nThe first time I went we sat at the bar and Josh walked us through the menu and answered our questions about the ingredients etc. Now whenever we go and Josh is working we'll go sit at the bar to hang out with him.\\n\\nI had to try the onion burger and it did not disappoint. How could it when you have onions two ways on one burger?! I went with the bf and we decided to also split the All the Way which was delicious due to the plethora of artery-clogging meats and cheese. The hot dog tasted great and I loved the casing -- definitely worth the extra couple bucks considering the size and quality of the dog as compared to Spike's for instance. They do have a challenge to eat something ridiculous like 3 of the \\"All the Ways\\" to get on their wall of shame. \\n\\nAlso keep an eye on the wall for rotating beers and burger specials. I'm often tempted to order two different burgers because the combinations are all so good but beware, it's more food than you might think in conjunction with a 50/50 and/or a shake.\\n\\nThe second (or third?) time I went I tried the spicy jalapeno which may now be my favorite burger fixture they have. So spicy, but so good you can't stop eating it! I also had the Big Kahuna --inspired by the fictional fast-food chain from \\"Pulp Fiction\\" -- and it was pretty solid. I would order it again at some point after going back a few times. The beef tastes of quality although I'm not sure what their lean/fat ratio is... could possibly use a bit more fat like an 80/20 given the small size of the burgers; however they are always juicy and well cooked (unless you're an idiot and get it \\"well\\").\\n\\nI have a slight issue with their onion strings... just not that inspired, a little hard to eat especially if you dip them in anything, and they can get mushy if they're not piping hot. Their fries are pretty good, but maybe they should offer a waffle fry instead of the onion strings (just stick w/ the rings). Other than that small complaint, the overall food, service, and quality is excellent.

I'd been wanting to try it for a while. Many consider it in recent years the mecca of the Texas barbecue scene. The place that most any other place worth anything gets compared to. So i had pretty lofty expectations. I'm a big fan of Killen's barbecue in Pearland. So for this place to be truly as good as the hype indicated; it would have to be an absolutely mind blowing culinary experience. For it to be worth it in my opinion Franklin would have to blow Ronnie Killen's barbecue juggernaut out of the water. My friends and i rolled up to the place at 7am on Saturday 12/31/16. To my surprise there were about 30 people in line already. I heard people started showing up at 6am regularly. But this many?! Word on the street was the first guy in line showed up at 5:45am. So we sat in the lawn chairs available at the place. Then we waited......and waited....played cards and waited. Spoke with other people in line, and waited. I walked out of line and took pictures of how long the line was. Then i got back in line and waited some more. After 4 hours finally 11am came around. Once the doors opened it got moving. We were at the front of the line, ordered, and seated at our table by 11:30am approximately. I had a 1/2 pound of brisket. I asked for some fatty brisket and some lean. I also ordered a 1/2 pound of pork ribs. I also ordered a personal size order of cole slaw. The lean brisket was very good. Fatty brisket isn't really my thing usually. Not all pitmasters can render the fat and the meat in a palatable manner to where the fat and the meat seem to bleed into each other. Franklin's moist fatty brisket was ok. I've had better. The pork ribs were also very good. The barbecue sauces were alright. The slaw was ok. My verdict. Franklin's... Was it good? Yes. Was it worth the 4 hours i waited in line for this food? No. It was a nice experience, just to get it out of my system and form a personal opinion about this place. For me, Franklin's does not live up to the cult of personality it commands in recent years. Franklin's is good. But Killen's is better."},{"name":"Kiwami Ramen","address":"2700 W Anderson Ln","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"Bad music and mediocre food, look elsewhere to spend your money.

The chili on the dog was very tasty, though I think I'll be dousing it with hot sauce if I try it again -- I'm a fan of grub that bites back; the dog itself was nothing special. The tots, on the plus side, were not at all oily as you might expect at most places, but I wasn't sucked in by them overall. They became my condiment experimentation station; I think I tried most of the bottles in the basket.\\n\\nNone of this is to say that there was anything wrong with the food. It was good.

We took a couple of Snapchat and Instagram worthy pictures and were on our way. It wasn't too hot outside but because I did spend a little too much time with taking pictures mine preemptively melted (heads up). We did find that the cones do give off an oil when warmed up by our hands. Not a big deal but it does make you feel messy even before any of the ice cream drips. \\nAs far as price goes you pay for what you get - each of ours cost $5 each. Was it worth the experience? Yes. But it's not a place I'd go to religiously but only if I were in the mood for it. \\nThe space doesn't really allow for more seating nor does the outside so be prepared to stand or head out.

I'm very surprised this restaurant only has three stars; I really think it is more deserving of four stars or maybe five stars. When ever I go there the place is over flowing with people, it's quite popular amongst the locals and Simon Fraser University is just up the hill is a frequent destination for hungry college students. The sushi is very affordable; I pay roughly $6.00 for a rainbow row. All though the rainbow roll has egg in it, rather than the traditional crab it's still pretty good. \\nThe Awesome role, on the other hand is absolutely delicious. You have your soft and creamy crab filling in the inside, the crab gives it a great texture and flavor! On the outside the role is drizzled with two delicious sauces (that I don't know the name of) and salmon and green onions on the top. The roll is sweet but salty. What makes this roll look especially unique is the fish flakes that are covering the top if the roll, although I'm not too crazy about the taste of the fish flakes (they taste fishy) the light flakes add a texture to the roll that is out of this world. It also makes the roll looks very appealing to the eye, the roll its self looks very unique. \\nBesides the actually taste of the sushi my favorite thing about this place is the price. You can easily go out for a sushi dinner and pay less than $10. When I eat there I usually only spend about $8 (including tip). As far as I know you can't make reservations a head of time, this is especially problematic if you plan to eat here in the evenings especially on a Friday or Saturday night, however I was just there Thursday night, and we had to wait a good 15 minutes before we could have a place to sit. \\nAs far as the staff goes, they are pretty average. They don't go above and beyond their line of duty; they just take your order and refill your drinks as the night goes on. They aren't rude, but they aren't especially friendly or talkative either, I guess you wouldn't expect them to be, it's not a fancy restaurant or even a nice restaurant.

Worst service I have ever had in Austin.\\n\\nWe had to sit outside because inside tables were either occupied or reserved (we had called earlier trying to reserve a table but because there were only four of us, we couldn't). That's alright... It's Austin, it's late October, it was pleasantly warm, not too hot. But the tiny glasses of water (that we had to ask for) were being emptied rather quickly by us, and not topped up regularly at all. Several times I was really thirsty.  Why why why do these hipster joints give you water in small 6oz(?) glasses? It is a hot town, we need water!\\n\\nMy friend , who has food allergies, had a few questions re the menu, which is a bit confusing. Our waitress could not have been less interested. Eventually we got the answers. Another friend asked if there were any specials and she said no, it's a new menu, they're just working on tweaking it. I noticed that there was a soup and a vegetarian pasta on the menu, but we were not told what either of them might be. One of my friends ordered a cocktail and when the waitress brought our drinks, she put it right behind his elbow. Luckily he saw it before he knocked it over. \\n\\nWe had asked for our food to be brought at the same time, but it arrived in stages, and my entree was completely left out of the line-up. The waitress claimed no knowledge of it having been ordered. By then, I was really disliking the place and told her, never mind, I'll just make do with the salad they had brought, which I'd ordered as a starter. She then made lots of excuses, babbled on for a while, offered to have them make another entree (no thanks, we had waited long enough) and just stood there talking for ages before we basically had to tell her to go. She then returned twice apologizing more, and apologizing for the way she had handled the initial apology, offering a free drink or something. No thanks, no thanks. We just wanted to eat and get out. My friends kindly shared their entrees with me. She comped my salad. Her attitude was awkward, disinterested and flat.\\n\\nLike I said, there were many times during the meal that we needed our teeny tiny water glasses filled up. Thirsty, frustrating meal.

I've eaten here twice in the week since it opened and am happy to report that the same great favors we enjoy in East Austin are now available right in our own backyard.  \\n\\nAll of the food I have ordered (or tasted from my dining companions plates) has been very good.  The nicoise salad that I just never could get to the East side often enough to enjoy is just as good as I remember.  The tuna was perfecttly seared and the veggies were all very fresh.  One meal even featured a blue potato, which I thought was fun for a little change.   The pasta salad special was vey good and the prosciutto and mozzarella tartine might be my new fave on the menu.  \\n\\nThe list of wines available by the glass is short but quite impressive.  As a white wine drinker I normally consider myself lucky if I have any option other than a California Chardonnay.  I was thrilled to find lots of wines from around Europe and several different varietals.  And the wine prices are great.  I think my vinho verde was $6 for a glass.  And it wasn't even happy hour.  \\n\\nI do hope that they expand the dinner menu to include a few of my favorites from the East side location.  Particularly the Coq au vin.  \\n\\nThere were a few unruly kids around, this is Westlake after all.  While there is a children's menu, the menu is a bit too sophisticated for kids and I could understand why the kids at the next table were pitching a fit about not liking their meals.  But I loved mine!  I am so excited that there is finally a place to have a drink and a great salad in a quiet adult atmosphere right here in Westlake.  I think this may be a weekly occurrence for us."},{"name":"Eastland Sushi & Asian Cuisine","address":"16519 SE Mcgillivray Blvd","city":"Vancouver","stars":"3.5","text":"Favorite local shushi bar.

The menus is limited, and the distinction between the appetizers and entrees is somewhat fuzzy. Prices can be surprisingly high so make sure you ask before agreeing to order the daily special. For instance, we work shocked to learn that the \\"Trout Cheeks\\" were $45 as compared to the regular-menu Steel-head trout at $19.   Best to order the hand-crafted burger which is limited to approximately 20 orders per night and is excellent. Craft beer on draught selection is rather small considering the pub-like atmosphere although the craft cocktail selection largely compensates.  BTW the Trout Cheeks were excellent, if not a tad overpriced.  Dessert options are a paltry two or three items; apparently table turnover is the strategy at play.

A Doner Kebab for 5.99 will make a lunch or dinner and you can add the fresh cut fries for only a couple of bucks extra. The lentil soup is enormous and can be had with or without the house made sausage and is a meal on its own.  House made sausages are available in four types and come with saur kraut and potato salad.

Everything was tasty and hadn't fallen prey to the \\"all desi food is orange and bland\\" thing which is basically every other desi restaurant in the US. The lamb and chicken were tender and moist which made the dishes even more delicious. I do think the spice level could have been higher which is why I'm not giving it 5 stars - if they could add an option to make it spicier then that would really cinch it for me. The palak paneer was good but it wasn't as creamy and heavy as I like- I prefer the kind that is so rich that you feel sick after hehe.

I'm I the only one who thinks that is the stupidest question to ask? Hello, to be called a gyro that means the \\"bread\\" is a gyro! They didn't even have gyros. Then when I switched to a Cuban they asked me what I wanted on it!... It's a Cuban... They should know what comes on a Cuban, it's a sandwich shop. Never eating at this place again.

Somehow I decide on here. Called in the order for the fennel, arugula, and radicchio salad. aka the appetito salad. I also had added a side of grilled chicken. The girl let me know it was going to be 15 min. Ok, great. \\n\\nCame in at around 8:25 and was nicely greeted by one of the servers who asked me if I called in the salad to-go order. She gave me my bill and I payed and waited for my food.  The restaurant seemed about half full, not that busy. As I waited by the front counter, a few of the servers was chit-chatting about how orders had been 30 minutes late, entrees coming out before appitizers, etc. \\n\\nAnyway, 8:30/8:35, still no salad. I'm thinking to myself, how long does it take for a salad. A waitress asks me if i'd been helped yet and i let her know i'm waiting for my order. Off to the side, the salad guy STARTS making the salad. Eventually another waitress comes by and is told the other waitress I've been waiting for my to-go salad order for a long time now. They continue to banter (as if I'm not standing there) about how the grilled chicken took a while, the salad cook said he wasn't even told about the salad, etc etc. Clearly, there is so much disorganization in this place. Not to mention they shouldn't be talking about all these problems, in FRONT of a customer. \\n\\nFinally around 8:50, my salad is done, one of the waitresses is holding the box in her hand, and asks me if I've paid, I say yes, and she asks me again if I've paid. She seemed as if she'd had a long night, and her mind just really wasn't there. She hands me salad container, and I ask her what salad this is. She says Chicken Ceasar?? I let her know I didn't order a ceasar. She says calmly, \\"sorry, oh I didnt even look at the order, I didn't take the order, I was just trying to help out.\\" She looks at the ticket, and says, \\"oh you had appetito salad, this is it.\\" Clearly, I can see through the container, there was only mixed greens and romaine lettuce and the grilled chicken (that I order separately) on top. I ask to see the menu, and i point to her the description of the salad, and no where does it say, romaine lettuce. Then another girl comes over and asks what's the problem and she proceeds open the container, and says, \\"I don't understand, what's wrong with it??\\" They once again, they continue to banter to each other (as If I'm not there) as to IS or ISN'T this the right salad. \\n\\nFinally, having had enough, I just tell the girls, to give me a refund. They agree and the girl, asks me for a receipt!! O boy. My boyfriend standing there the whole time, asks, \\"Who is the manager?\\" We find out his name is Jay, but he isn't there. By the end, I receive a sincere apology for the confusion, but almost immediately, before I even turn to leave, they continue to discuss other customer issues.  \\n\\nDue to the lack of leadership, organization, communication, menu compitancy, Appetito lost a sale and lost a customer for life. I don't know what is going on over there, but I don't think they can last much longer if this is an example of how they run its business."},{"name":"Red Lobster","address":"4010 West Vine St","city":"Kissimmee","stars":"3","text":"Stopped in on a Sunday and our waitress was named Daisy.

We arrived slightly before 9 and decided to wait in the reception couch area while our table was being prepared. A few of us went to the bar to order drinks while we waited and were promptly asked for our IDs, no big deal. I showed my fianc√©e's and my ID to the bartender and he gave me my IPA and Sangria. We then brought our drinks back to the reception area and were waiting and mingling when a waitress came up to us and asked to see all of our IDs again.  We were a little surprised and showed her our ID again. She then informed us that she needed to see a credit card with all of our IDs because we had North Carolina Licenses and \\"Boston had new rules where you had to show two forms of ID when you were from out of state.\\" Well my fianc√©e did not have her credit card because I was going to pay for things that night. So I ran back to the hotel and grabbed her credit card. After coming back to the restaurant, I noticed that my fianc√©e was without her sangria and apparently the staff had taken her drink away because she didn't have this second form of ID and that they would \\"take it off the bill.\\" Well too bad I had already paid cash.  My fianc√©e then spent the next 10 minutes trying to find the same waitress who took the sangria away so that she could get the drink back. After about 15 minutes she finally gets her drink, meanwhile it is now 9:45 and we still have not been seated for our 9:15 reservation. I am obviously somewhat irritated now, when the Manager comes by in his cheap Men's Wearhouse suit and acting like he runs the Italian Mob in Boston asks to see our IDs AGAIN!!! What a piece of you know what. After about another 5 minutes we were seated at our table.\\n\\nWe then had a halfway decent dinner and our waitress was a real sweetheart, but she did ask to see our IDs for one final and fourth time.\\n\\nNow on to the food. A friend and I started with the bone marrow oysters. The oysters were delicious; however the bone marrow was nowhere to be found and is somewhat misleading. For the main course, I had the grilled duck breast which was very good and the rice that accompanied it was excellent.  Several people at the table had the bronzini, which they said was also good.  I tried a small piece of the Hand Cut Pappardelle, which also had very good flavor.  The goat cheese ravioli was okay, but nothing to write home about. My fianc√©e had the chipotle chicken pizza, which was one of the worst things I have ever tasted. The chicken tasted like it was from the rotisserie at Walmart with no taste of chipotle and was just put on top of the pizza.  My fianc√©e then had the chocolate bread pudding, which took an extra 25 minutes to get after we ordered it. I am not originally from NC, but that was not bread pudding.  It was just a crappy chocolate cake with little resemblance to a true bread pudding that you would find in the south. \\n\\nOverall, I would want to give this place 2 stars, but since I was carded 4 times (I am 31), half the food was good and the other half was awful, and it was loud and hot; I have to give it 1 star (the kind of rating usually only given to Long John Silver's Big Catch plate).

The rib is served on a large plate and the eggs over easy on a second smaller plate sat inside the larger plate (yuck-- the bottom of the plate was ON my rib), plus the eggs were as cold as the plate. At least sit it IN the warmer, please? For 15$, i could do a lot better. When we ordered, the waitress repeated everything back to us wrong, we corrected her, then she brought the orders wrong. Eesh. We heard her apologizing to the other tables nearby for their wrong orders.

All that said, the BBQ is darn good and despite what others may say, there aren't too many places around Austin at the same level.

The biscuits are the 2nd best I have ever had only behind Mothers Restaurant in NOLA.  I started with the Se7en Benedict and it was great. the flavors blew me away and having the biscuit instead of the muffin was a great touch. The fried green tomatoes were a unique taste and perfectly went with the meals. The savory vegetable bread pudding was almost like a souffl√© that it was so fluffy.
